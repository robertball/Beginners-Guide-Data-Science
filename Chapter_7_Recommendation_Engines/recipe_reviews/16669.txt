I have made this several times and it is very good. I use a deep fryer and it doesn't come out greasy. The dipping sauce is very tasty and I usually spice it up with more Worcestershire sauce before serving.Just follow the directions and you'll do fine.

These were great fingers.  Really good!  They were crispy outside and juicy inside.  I don't have a deep fryer, so did them on top of the stove in hot oil.  No problem!  And the dipping sauce was a wonderful complement.

I have always loved fried chicken tenders and this is the perfect recipe!!! - some quick help tips are, you dont have to use tenders, you can use chicken breasts, boneless or debone at home (deboning your own saves $$ and thats all tenders are, the "filet" cut of the breast thats been deboned and they charge an arm and a leg for) then cut into strips.  put flour in a zip lock shake a few pieces at a time, lay them out and when done then dip in egg and -- italian bread crumbs are great, but if you're out: try crushed corn flakes, ritz crakers, saltines and my favorite, croutons and put those in a zip lock as well shaking just a piece or two at a time to cover. lastly, for those of us who dont trust deep fryers, you can use a skillet - but to make a bit less greasy and this will work for your deep fryers too- put tray of breaded tenders in the refrigerator for 1/2 an hour or so, get them a bit cold. I also use a mesh splatter cover on my skillet  - by the way.... this way makes great regular ol' Fried chicken too!

I have made these 3 times now. They are a little time consuming but worth it. If previous posts didn't care for these, they either didn't follow the recipe exactly OR didn't make the accompanying sauce! Alone, I'll admit these are just so-so but the sauce is yummy - and in addition, the leftover sauce is good spread on sandwiches. I did add a bit of garlic powder to the breading (as some had mentioned) and about 1 T. Italian dressing to the egg mixture. Also, I don't have a deep fryer so had to fry in a skillet but didn't seem to make a difference. These are good leftovers as well and my boyfriend likes to add them to his salads. Yummy 5 stars from me but don't forget the sauce!

I had never fried my own chicken tenders before, but these turned out great!  They did need a little more flavor so I added seasoned salt to the bread crumbs and they tasted really good!  Thanks!

I added my own italian seasoning to regular bread crumbs and used buttermilk instead of water in the egg wash. I fried this on the stovetop and it worked just fine. I just "drained" them on paper towels, then set the tenders on cookie sheets on a deep baking pan and baked them for 15 minutes at 350 degrees to crisp them up. I made only a half recipe of the dipping sauce which was good as we didn't really care for it but the tenders were good. Great husband/kid pleasing food.

This review is for the chicken only as I did not prepare the sauce.  I give it high marks for ease of preparation but it could use some salt and a little more kick.  My kids really loved it and I will make it again.

This were good....I have used a different chicken tender recipe for years and was glad to try something different for a change.  
I do have to admit that I like my own for more flavor, but these were good as well.  Thank you for posting.  I will use again when a change is needed.

Best deep-fry batter I've ever tasted!  It works great for anything:  fish, shrimp, pork, chicken-fried steak, or chicken parmesan.  The bread crumbs are what make this crunchy and delicious.  I like to lightly freeze the battered pieces before frying.  This keeps the batter from falling off the chicken when you fry it.

This was very good, I did add some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. Also, for me 2 quarts of oil is really scary. I put about 1/8 of an inch in the bottom of the frying pan.

This was absolutely the BEST recipe for chicken tenders - I used some kick A** home grown horseradish that added to it - but in my deep fryer (T-fal) I only had to cook them 3 minutes per batch.  
My husband thinks theses are THE BEST - (which makes my life easier!)

I suppose if you wanted to completely obliterate the taste of the chicken you could add more spices but, as is, the recipe is delicious. Prep is really quite simple.  I cut up 2 large B/S breasts to add to the package of tenders to make up the 24 pieces and after putting the flour into a brown paper bag, added the chicken tenders, closed the bag and shook it until all pieces were lightly coated.  Proceeded from there to egg wash and then bread crumbs.  Frying a few pieces at a time ensures the oil will remain at temp and all pieces will come out crispy.  I made the sauce early in the day while chicken was thawing.  I can see using that same sauce with chicken wings.  We loved it and I'm certain this will be an encore presentation!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Love it!!! Came out amazing.  I used hot chili pepper instead of cayenne pepper.  Tasted really good just with ketchup.  I don't have a deep frier so I used a regular pan with a lot less oil (about 1/2) and I was completely satisfied.

Wonderful! First input I have is that I used (brown) rice flour instead of all-purpose. Makes it crunchier and less goopy. Also used Panko breadcrumbs. I cut up chicken breasts I had so they were more like chicken bites than tenders and cooked quicker. I left out the cayenne pepper because of the kiddos but I'm sure my hubs would have loved it. I did make the dipping sauce even though I sadly didn't have horseradish on hand. Awesome dip! As tipped by another reviewer, I will keep this in the fridge ongoing for sandwich spread. Thanks so much for the recipe!

First time I made chicken tenders and it really came out tender and yummy. Though I add some ingredients aside from the original  and thought you might like to try it. Since I only have the Italian Style breadcrumbs (progresso) I add 1/2tsp  seasoned salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4tsp onion powder (this is per 1cup of italian breadcrumbs)  and I also add 1/4tsp of paprika to 1/2 cup of all purpose flour. Seasoned the chicken tenderloin with a little bit of salt before you start with the coatings procedure.

These chicken tenders are great. Even easier than making the horseradish sauce is to use Ranch dressing to dip them in. Or use any favorite dipping sauce.  They were great with fries and a salad.

The sauce was fantastic!  Reminded me of Sizzler Malibu Chicken sauce but more flavorful (I used light mayo and  it was still good).  Since I was making for a fewer servings I used 1 tbsp each mayo and sour cream.  Added about 1 tspn each of horseradish and yellow mustard.  Then stirred in a generous splash of worcestershire.  I sliced up a chicken breast instead of buying tenders which worked fine.  Put flour in plastic bag for shaking and then coated in buttermilk followed by bread crumbs.  I added Tabasco to the buttermilk and some ground pepper to already seasoned bread crumbs.  Let them rest for a few minutes before pan frying in  1/2" of peanut oil.  I'd never used peanut oil before but the breading was pleasantly crispy and the meat very juicy.  Only cooked for a couple of minutes.  Will make again.  It was very easy.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I only gave this 4 stars because I made some adjustments. I did not have seasoned bread crumbs so I used plain and added my own herbs. I also added parmesan cheese into the bread crumbs which I would NOT recommend. The cheese gets too dark. I turned the fryer down to 365 and cooked for only 3 minutes. 6 minutes was way too long. I kept the finished ones in a warm oven while I fried the rest in small bataches.

Made the dipping sauce for this recipe tonight.  It was great with our deep fried chicken tenders.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing.  It is a keeper!!   Didn't use the breading recipe because my husband was alreading in the process of deep frying the tenders when I ran across this recipe.

This was my first attempt at making friend chicken and it was sooo good. I cut the recipe in half and pan fried them, then used the grease to make gravy. I also added some ketchup, garlic and pepper to the sauce. Yum!

I am a huge fan of chicken tenders, but these were disappointing. They were very bland. The basic recipe is ok, you'll just have to experiement with some spices to give it some flavor. Would not make these again.

This was a hit with my husband especially!  They remind us of our favorite Chicken Tenders at one of our favorite restraunts "The Cooker."  Tender and juicy, flavored just right.  We dipped them in Hellman's new Honey Mustard sauce which made a perfect match!  Plus, it made enough that we have leftovers for the next night!

Boyfriend and I made these last night and they turned out perfect.  Light, crispy, not oily.  We ate the leftovers today and they were still crispy, not soggy.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Seems like the breading would be really good on fish, too.

I did these in my new deep fryer and they worked great.  Used the tenders on a salad.  Next time I will add a little more spice.  My family loved them but can't make to often because they are fried in grease after all.

These were really good.  The ckicken was really tender and moist.  I did add some garlic powder to the breadcrumbs.  Deep fried for about 5-6 minutes (but my fryer may have been hotter than 375).  Will make again.

Coating the fingers with breadcrumbs and then frying at 375 degrees resulted in burned breading.  I baked the first batch for 7 minutes, the second for 6 minutes, and the third for 5 minutes trying to avoid burning the breading, but every single one was burned.  I was trying to make my own chicken fingers to avoid buying the overpriced Schwans tenders, but there is no way that my 2 year old will eat these.

These are really excellent! I've had fun playing around with the spices, italian spices or crushed red chilies have all been good additions. They are truly chicken "TENDERS." My picky 4 yr. old will even eat these.

really great go to recipe for frying chicken. I swapped Cajun Seasoning for the cayenne pepper it has a little more flavor instead of heat. And used half and half to mix in with the eggs give it a more thick consistency.

This is a great recipe for a chicken sandwich without the sauce. I made this along with the buffalo chicken recipe and it was really good, we wasn't crazy about the dipping sauce. We prefer honey mustard because we don't like horseradish sauce. The next evening we had this chicken on sandwiches and it was great. My picky 2 yr old loved it. Next time I will substitute the bread crumbs for Panko Bread Crumbs (Parmesan Herb) they are great for a crunchy chicken.

Great recipe for crunch! Sauce is good but without the sauce, it's really, really bland. Needs something? I've only made once so I would love to make again with some spice additions. Great crunchy recipe though! Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent! I added a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt and an 1/8 teaspoon of cumin for a little more flavor -- and just because my family loves garlic and cumin.  These were a big hit with everyone!

Loved this recipe! Nice and crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Though "6-8 minutes" was much too long. 5 minutes was what I did and they came out just right.

I love chicken tenders, and this sauce is awesome!  I used spicy brown mustard and reduced it to 1 T, and added about one teaspoon of honey and a couple dashes of extra hot Texas Pete.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was very yummy!!  I have never made chicken fingers before (hot oil and I are not good friends), but this one was extremely easy, and hard to get wrong.  Instead of bread crumbs I used Ritz cracker crumbs, which turned out great.  I also added a little garlic powder to the crackers like other reviewers.  We don't own a deep fryer, so I added about 1/4 inch of oil to a pan and flipped the chicken once or twice, and that worked great.  We have a little family, so I only ended up making 5 chicken strips--you can definitely scale this recipe to the size you need.  Overall, great chicken fingers.  The sauce is a MUST!  Very good!!  We will be making these again!

First time I tried these and they came out fantastically! I read some of the other reviews and chose bits and pieces to work with- an extra teaspoon of Cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of garlic salt to the breadcrumbs, and seasoning the chicken itself with salt, pepper and garlic salt seem to have worked wonders, and added just enough spice to make this perfect for me. I didn't bother with the sauce- these were good enough to eat plain. Easy to prepare, fry, and delicious to eat!

Nice & tender, very easy to make! I didn't have any horseradish on hand so I didn't make the dipping sauce but they were still good without it.

Made this for the first time last night. It was really good, crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. I have a stove top deep fryer and cooked them in peanut oil. The breading was a little bland, next time I'll add a little garlic powder and onion powder. The sauce was very good. I will be making this one again.

I made this recipe for dinner today, I love the flavor of the chicken, I also made mac n cheese and homemade fries, I made strawberry lemonade homemade too. Very good dinner. The sauce is yummy , but I prefer ranch dressing.

Fantastic! I just made these tonight, with a bit of a modification. I added an extra egg, and I double dipped...flour-egg-breadcrumbs,flour-egg-breadcrumbs. I also pan-fried at 5/10 heat (let it heat up all the way first) with about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil. About 3-4 minutes per side was perfect. The chicken was juicy, and I swear it's quite near any of the best chicken tenders that I've had at a restaurant. I didn't opt for the sauce, but instead used some Texas-style BBQ sauce, which was perfect for me. I will definitely be making this again!

These were great! I marinated them in butter milk mixed with cajun seasoning for 2 hours. Turned out tender and delicious! I didn't make the horseradish sauce, but i did make ranch dip. MMMmmm Mmmmm!

My family loved these tenders.  For a healthier meal I baked them instead of frying them.  I cooked them 25 minutes and turned them midway.  The dipping sauce is delicious but the recipe can be halfed; there was way too much leftover.

Excellent. I skipped the egg step & it was still delish. I mixed the flour/bread crumbs & spices (added extra spices) and threw the chicken in. It was so easy. I used the leftover coating on French fries. Thanks!

Horrible. I set my deep fryer to 375. The chicken burned within 2-3 minutes. I turned the heat down to 350. The outside cooks okay in 6-8 minutes but then the inside was raw.

made these for my family tonight and we all just loved them. Used my electric skillet set on 4oo, 3 min. each side. So juicy on the inside and wonderfully crispy outside. Only thing I changed; I used Pepperidge Farm Herb seasoned stuffing after crushing. Just because I had it in pantry. It was the perfect blend of seasoning for chicken. Great Recipe. Thanks for sharing

Love the recipe I cooked mine 5 min 30 sec and they are juicy and tender . I used filtered grease so they do appear darker.  Also I used blue cheese and sweet baby rays for dip. I'm going to try the the sauce next time . 5 stars.

Awesome recipe!! i rinsed the checken then Rubbed on some paprika and sprinkled a bit of salt and it came out great!! To make about 10 strips you only need a cup of the Italian bread crumbs. It was delicious! I used a frying pan and added enough oil to cover each chicken strip on about med-high heat. It fried quickly and it was delicious. The breading did fall off a bit when we ate it though.

I made this incredible recipe in a pan with vegetable oil about 2 inches deep.  It turned out incredible and not greasy at all!  The sauce was good.  I also used crushed Cheez-Its instead of breadcrumbs since I didn't have any and it was deliciously crunchy and flavorful and juicy!!! You can definitely taste the black pepper and cayenne but it's not overpowering, it's amazing!!!

The only thing I did differently was I used mayo with a little milk to dredge the chicken instead of egg.

I have made homemade chicken fingers for quite a while.  My only suggestion...if you're looking for REALLY flavorful chicken fingers...use the pre-seasoned chicken tenders.  They are not as inexpensive as regular boneless chicken breasts, but, they impart a wonderful flavor in the chicjen fingers.

Very crispy and delish.  I added garlic powder, mustard and salt to the bread crumbs, and then I tossed all the tenders in a large baggie with the flour mixture and after dipping them in the egg mixture, I tossed them in a large baggie of the bread crumb mixture and into the hot oil.  Instead of water, I added some diet Sierra Mist to the egg mixture.  I didn't have any horseradish on hand, but I did have a honey mustard dipping sauce that I used.  I am eager to try the sauce next time!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This chicken recipe could use some more salt to the mix or something with a little more flavor for those of you who dont like the majo tasting sauce.

Tried this recipe because it was the first one to put up when I did a google search.  I am so glad I did.  My kids loved it and so did I.  Used Panko breadcrumbs but didn't change anything else, this dish was incredible!!  Thanks for sharing.

Loved the flavors.  This was such a simple, easy recipe, and the dipping sauce was marvelous.  My husband really enjoyed it!  The only thing I changed, because I'm gluten intolerant, is using gluten free flour and corn flake crumbs.  I also cut the recipe in half because it is just the two of us.

I made these into nuggets using the same recipe. Because they have to cook so long, new oil is definitely recommended. I will make them thinner next time to shorten cooking time. They were really crispy and delicious.

Love this recipe! They came out so delicious and tender. I did add about a tsp more cayenne to the breadcrumbs and about 1/2 a tbls of garlic salt and I read that some people said they were a little bland so I seasoned the chicken with some salt, pepper, and season salt before adding them into the flour and such. My husband and I don't like horseradish so we didn't make the sauce but they didn't need it! Paired it with a cheese pasta. mmmm mmmm I LOVED them!

Love this recipe, and especially the dipping sauce. We keep a bowl of dipping sauce in the fridge at all times, and we dip almost everything in it (we are a dipping family!).

Made this last night at the request of my youngest daughter. It was a HUGE success!! The whole family loved them. I let my daughter make the sauce but we were out of horseradish so we added honey instead for a honey mustard dipping sauce. Will definitely do again with all the ingredients. Thanks for a family favorite!!!

This seems so basic, but my family RAVES about these.  I got a request from my husband to make them last week.  He doesn't often request anything special.  They're must right.  I don't even make the sauce.

I accidentally put the bread crumbs and the flour and the spices together, and I used 2 TBSP beer instead of 2TBSP water with the egg mixture - this chicken was awesome!!  It was very tender and I could taste some kick to it - just enough.

Okay so I'm actually reviewing the dipping sauce. I made my usual tenders and then used this dipping sauce, which I added about a TBSP and a half of ketchup to. With the addition of the ketchup the sauce tasted like the dipping sauce at the Outback.  Thanks, this sauce is a keeper!

Very good! I used plain bread crumbs instead of italian and instead of the cayenne pepper, I used a palm full of cajun seasoning. Turned out great, I did not make the dip sauce to go with it though. Very tasty, will make again. Loved the cajun seasoning!

Very tasty! I did not make the dipping sauce as I was serving with spaghetti. Also, I pan fried in olive oil as I do not have a deep fryer. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Next time I will serve as an appetizer and I will definitely make the dipping sauce.

I probably should give the sauce 5 stars, but the chicken needs help. I think it should say 1 T. of cayenne instead of 1 t. These need some zing, they are just too plain. Also, I ran out of egg first and had to add another (so 3 altogether plus 3T water). I still had about 1/2c. flour leftover. The first batch burnt the coating @ 375, yet the inside was raw. I turned down the fryer to 345 and altho they took longer, they were @ least done and didn't burn. But, still very bland. I also added garlic to the coating, but it just didn't help. Plus the breading came off the chicken. The sauce rocks though. My children liked, but didn't rave about them. I'll keep looking for a good tender recipe, but the sauce is a keeper. Thanks!

Yes.  Very good.
I didn't have italian bread crumbs so I used plain, and instead of water with the egg, I used italian dressing.  Don't know if that really helped it but it was good!

My son loves these. I use Captain Crunch cereal crushed up in place of the bread crumbs. I had them like this at Planet Hollywood a few years ago and they were delicious. It gives them a bit of sweetness!~

These were great.  This was the 2nd time I've made these but the first time I didn't make the sauce, because I didn't too much care for the mustard and horseraddish. But this time I made it, only used about half of the mustard.  The sauce definately finishes off the dish.  I would give this 5 stars but I dont' really like the breading, maybe next time, i'll just use more flour with some italian seasoning  instead.

This was delicious!  Made this today with modifications.  Took the advice of others and I seasoned the chicken itself using Lawry’s Seasoning Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper and Red Pepper Flakes.  I smothered chicken breasts in mayo, then refrigerated and allowed it to marinate for a few hours.  I then floured, dipped in eggs (used heavy whipping cream instead of water), then the bread crumbs and pan fried in the stove.  VERY juicy and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Would definitely make this again.  I loved it!!!

Used 2 TB of mustard and horseradish (instead of 3) and it was my kind of flavor!

Really needed more seasoning.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and kosher salt.  Hubby liked (always a good sign).

I used gluten-free flour and gluten-free bread crumbs.  Didn't put enough spice in it.  Needs at least 3 if not 4 eggs, not the 2 listed.
.
Cut breasts into fingers.
Drop chicken into flour.  Coat well.
Drop into eggs.  Coat all sides.
Place on breadcrumbs, then pour additional breadcrumbs over the top to coat.

I think this is a great, super easy recipe that picky people of all ages will enjoy. My only complaint is that I wish there was more flavor to the recipe. My boyfriend and I felt it was a little bland.  Next time I make this recipe I will definitely be adding for seasoning.

I have made this before and it is an easy and quick meal. I add extra worchestershire and horseradish to the dipping sauce, because we like spicy foods.

Texture wise - these are perfect. Crunchy and juicy. Definitely lacks flavor though and is rather bland (the reason for 4 stars) .

I will most definitely make these again but I will add additional seasoning, maybe salt and garlic powder as others suggested .

Made this for my fiancé’s kids who don’t like sauces so I added a little garlic and onion powder (1 1/2tsp of each)to the flour mix.  The pickiest kid I’ve ever met called these the best chicken strips he’s ever had!

This is the best fried chicken tender recipe I've found. The only change I made was with the dipping sauce. I only use the mayonnaise, sour cream, and Worcestershire sauce (I'm not a horseradish person). So good.

Tried this out on a whim. My fiance loved it and so did I. We ate 2nds and 3rds it was so good. 
I didn't use cayenne pepper or turmeric but used curry powder instead. Also made a batch with rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs - quite tastey indeed. Juicy and succulent

This was a great basic recipe!  I didn't have bread crumbs or panko, but I did have some leftover cornflakes and they worked great.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce.  Kind of bland in my opinion, so will have to read up to see if anyone made any changes.  Family loved it!

Added grated Parmesan to bread
Crumbs also salt and garlic powder. Was delicious. The sauce
Was also an added bonus especially if chicken is a little dry.
Will definitely cook this dish again.

Tenders were great. Good breading and flavor. Cook times at 375 in a deep frier were only 4 mins so that was way off. The sauce I found to be bland. Next time I'll use a Chipotle ranch dressing. Based on bland sauce and inaccurate cook times, I gave it a 3.

Tasted good, the only difference I made was using Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs.

One star removed for cooking time in recipe - 375 degrees in my deep fryer only took 3 minutes, not 6-8, which caused the first batch to be WAY overcooked and almost burnt.

These are better than the local, popular chicken chain.  The filet's are tender and delicious.  Use  your thermometer and be sure to not overcook.  We liked the breading but would use 3 times the Cayenne next time.  The dipping sauce was ok but a little too tangy for us with 3 T mustard.  I'll stick with homemade ranch next time.

This recipe is my mainstay for "Fun Food Night" and picnic time. Not very caloric and the horseradish dip was the best. One change. I used lowfat yoghurt for instead of mayo for the dip, eliminated the sour creme and used lemon juice instead. Next time, I'll include a bit of the sour creme. I also didn't deep fry–didn't need to, the shallow skillet was fine.

I followed direction precisely.  The bread crumbs were scorched before the inside of the chicken was done.  I cooked more dipping it twice  in flour with no bread crumbs, and it turned out much better.

I didn't really care for it.  I added extra spices, whatever I had in the kitchen but the breading was too hard.  I switched from the deep fryer to the cast iron skillet so I was able to control the browning a little better.  I wanted something with a crunchier crust but the wasn't it. It's ok though and since I didn't make the dip to go with it, it's probably my fault :)

I was out of red pepper, so I used cajun seasoning and it came out great!  To save time, I used Thai sweet chili sauce for the dip, and my kids enjoyed it with barbecue sauce.

Really good, crispy outside and tender inside.  I did however first marinate the tenderloins in salted water to which I added hot sauce and red pepper flakes.  That sat for about 4 hours, then I let them dry on paper towels.  This adds flavor to the chicken itself.  Dish cooks up fast and stays nicely in a warm oven.   Rave reviews from my picky eaters!!

These are very good and really are quick to make.  I used chicken breast cut in strips and my bad, didn't read the recipe fully and mixed the flour and the crumbs together - it worked out fine.  Might add some more spices next time, slightly on the bland side but they were crunchy and good.  We used our own sauces so can't judge the horseradish sauce but will try it next time.

really delicious!  It looked like they were cooking too long in the oil for 6 minutes, but I waited for six minutes and they came out beautiful and juicy.  I didn't use the sauce, since I didn't have the ingredients required on hand, so I used buffalo wing sauce.

I gave this a 5 stars, because it was good.  The only issue is that the cooking time is way too long if you have a regular chicken breast sliced into tenders.  2 min 30 sec to maybe 3 mins is probably the longest cook time at 375.

The dipping sauce was good, but the chicken fingers were very bland, even with the addition of more cayenne and some garlic salt. Next time I'll either marinate or at least salt & pepper the chicken first.

Amazing recipe! I followed directions & used the ingredients listed except I went with 1\4 tsp cayenne to keep the heat minimal so it wasn't too spicy for my 8 & 9  year old daughters, I used panko bread crumbs & pan fried my family loved dinner & after having 2nds & 3rds they brought me empty plates with smiles & full bellies.....haven't made the sauce we use BBQ but honestly the chicken is even awesome w\o sauce...

I loved this recipe. I will for sure make it again. They were really tender and easy for a beginner cook like me. I really don't like to cook but I'm in need of a variety of dinner ideas so I wanted to try this recipe based on reviews. Excellent!  Next time I think I'd add a bit more salt cuz I like my tenders with a bit of saltiness. I also pounded my chicken to try and make it all equal size so I wouldn't burn it like I've done so often.

We will make it again.  We did not use a deep fryer but a cast iron skillet then put it in the oven to crisp it up.  It needs more salt and pepper for flavor.  Overall, we will make it again, but will play around with the seasoning.

I didn't make the dipping sauce as it doesn't appeal to our tastes.  By themselves I found them a bit bland.  My boys just dip it in ketchup anyway and I found some sweet/sour from McDonalds!  Anything that my picky kids will eat is ok by me!

We only had 6 chicken tenders, so the original breading and sauce was too much.  I halved the ingredients, and I could have even made a third of it and been okay.
I added 1 Tablespoon of Honey to the sauce, and it added a nice light sweetness to it.  This sauce seems like it would be good on hamburgers too.

They were very very good and easy. My 18 year old autistic son made for a school cooking assignment. Will probably pan fry w less oil next time.  Can you bake them?  He is not a sauce person so we did not make that and limited the spice. I like this site.

delicious! very flavorful despite the low amount of ingredients. used paprika instead of cayenne because we're wusses when it comes to spicy, and added a little italian seasoning and garlic powder. was really good! picky fiance loved it. didn't expect them to be that crispy; just gotta make sure the oil is really hot.

I do not like horseradish so i omitted that ingredient and I added a 1/2 tsp of chicken seasoning along with the spices called for in this recipe. It is delightful. I baked mine in the oven and it came out just as good as fried only I used no skin chicken breasts. I plan to make this again and more often from now on.

Simple easy fried chicken. I didn't bother with the dipping sauce, we are not much for sauces. And I did a splash of milk instead of water but it was FANTASTIC! Delicious, juicy and quick. Also I used a wok to fry them up.

We didn't like the horseradish sauce at all, but this recipe made the most tender and crispy chicken strips I've ever had. Delightful!

Have not tried it, was wondering if instead of frying them, it could be done in the oven and eliminate some of the calories from the oil.

We're used to very fluffy, Chili's type tenders...so once I made the breading for this I was sure it would be bland. The sauce tasted weird too. HOWEVER, once the whole thing came together we couldn't believe how incredible it all was. Interesting mix but just perfect for each other. Five stars!

The sauce was outstanding. I make it regularly now to use as a pretzel dip. The chicken tenders recipe was good as well, however I used chicken breasts cut into strips. They only took a couple minutes to deep fry, though, so you might want to keep an eye on your chicken! Thanks for sharing!

Very tender and tasty. I used a regular frying pan and crisco because I didn't have deep fryer. If you like spicy, I changed the sauce. Added honey to taste to the sauce,  converting it to a Honey Mustard sauce. Used Hot and Spicy prepared horseradish for an extra kick. Also, garlic salt, ground pepper, and a dash of tabasco. Served tenders with toothpicks holding sliced prepared Jalapeno peppers on top. Yummy! We will do this again for the Super Bowl!

This recipe along with the dipping sauce was awesome. The only thing I did different to the sauce is only use 2 tbls of horseradish and we didnt have worcestershire sauce so I used a little bit of A1 sauce in place of it. Turned out great!!

This is an awesome and very easy recipe! I used italian-seasoned breadcrumbs with romano cheese in it because that's what I had. I also added more cayenne and some garlic powder to the breading mixture. The chicken was beautiful and the sauce is amazing!! I did the sauce just as the recipe goes and it was great. It would be really good on a turkey sandwich. :) Thanks for this new staple!

It does take a little bit of time and it is fried, but I decided to try it anyway. I usually don't fry anything unless I have too, but I am pregnant and craving fried food. These were great. I did it stove top and also used italian dressing instead of water with the eggs. I also used sweet and sour dipping sauce from this site instead. Good stuff.

Pretty good recipe, though the temp was a little on the high side.  My chicken tenders were definitely too dark and I didn't come close to the 6-8 minutes (I was right at 375 using a frying thermometer).  They still tasted good though!

This recipe was good.  Both of my kids loved it.  It just needed a little more spice to it.  I added some garlic and hot sauce seasoning.  Fried it in electric skillet and turned out fine.

I gotta say my kids loved this, and my 5 yr old is a picky eater. My husband also liked it. I loved the fact the coating stayed put and it looked like I ordered them at a resteraunt. I used breadcrumbs and put some cayenne pepper in it. Not too much because the kiddos, but it was good. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using it for my fried chicken from now on!

I actually ended up using Italian salad croutons, just crushed them up in a big zip lock bag. Also used a little more cayenne pepper and  some season salt. A good recipe because I believe you can add whatever seasoning that works for you.  Cooked quickly in a deep fryer at around 375 degrees. These were a big hit with everyone. Will definitely make again!

Very good.  The sauce is awesome. I didn't have horseradish, so I used chinese spicy mustard sauce in lieu of the horseradish and mustard and it turned out great.

Yup, just made them they look great now for the tasting... should be very good, I also used a dash of water and a dash of Italian Dressing in the egg batter for the chicken tenders, only thing was, I only had 8 tenders, so next time I would use 1/2 of what it calls for, but never the less great recipe, and I hadn't a clue before how to make these, so this is my 1st time. Thanks!

These turned out excellent.  I added some garlic powder in the italian bread crumbs but they are real good.  I would make these again.
