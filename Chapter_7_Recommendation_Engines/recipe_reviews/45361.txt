This is REALLY good.  I had a little trouble with the cooking time and temperature though.  20 mins at 320degs and the fish was still raw.  I upped the temp. to 350 and cooked it for another 20 mins or so and it turned out great.  I've made it twice now and the second time I wrapped it in foil and cooked it at 350 and in 25 mins it was done.  I also make extra sauce to put on poatoes or rice because it is sooooo good.  I didn't use salmon I got a really good deal on basa (a white fish) and it was perfect.

This recipe has got to be one of the BEST I've ever used when preparing salmon!  The only variation we use is substituting Dijon mustard with Dijonnaise.  We did this because we had no Dijon mustard in the fridge and it turned out SO great!  I can't brag enough about how insanely delicious this meal is!  We serve it with salad and Lipton Sweet and Sour noodles.  I have to agree with the earlier post regarding using fillets instead of steaks.  We buy the fillets at Sam's/Costco and cut them into small portions and that works just fine for us.  Just make sure you lightly coat the dish with Pam to keep the scales from sticking.

Well. I can't believe this one hasn't been reviewed yet!  This is a wonderful recipe and I used halibut (SO plentiful on the West Coast) and it was fabulous.  Accordingly, I wouldn't change a thing and will be making this again--often.  Thank you, Patricia!

The salmon fish steaks were sooo good. I prepared the salmon in the dish w/ the souce on top 1 hour before baking to marinate them. I will be making this recipe again.

This was very yummy. I reduced honey to 2 Tbsp and sweetness was just right. Next time I will definately let the salmon marinate for couple hours so that it gets more taste from marinate. Cant wait to try it on grill too. Thanks

Absolutely fantastic!  So simple, yet so delicious.  The salmon came out moist.  I added some fresh dill to the top of the salmon prior to baking. Thanks, Patricia!

This was great! I used lemon pepper instead of just regular pepper.  Used this recipe on mahi mahi and hubby thought it was fantastic.

Tasted way too sweet. Not sure about that low oven temperture. Upped mine to 350 half way through, didn't look like anything was happening.

This is basically how I usually bake salmon.  The only difference is that I add a little thyme, and I bake it at 400 for 15-20 minutes.  Placing foil or parchment paper in the pan makes the cleanup easier too.  Great recipe~

Thank you to Mommy lov. A recipe that is followed and rated helps us know if it is a good one. When everyone changes the recipe which one do you then know to follow. Rating means you RATE what the recipe calls for not what you changed it to be??? Keep it simple and RATE the recipe OR make up your own recipe and add it to the menues!! Thanks again!

For those of you who've had trouble with cooking times......buy an oven thermometer...oven temperatures can vary from the true temperature by 50-75 degrees....in my electric oven I have to  set the temperature to 400 in order to get the temperature to 350.....and the oven will beep indicating that it is up to temperature even though it's only up to around 200 degrees......so I've found that having an oven thermometer to be very helpful.

This was excellent.  I used 1 lb of salmon cut into 4 pieces.  My fiance loved it.  350°F at 30 minutes worked for me, plus 4 minutes under a 500°F broiler to finish off the top.  This cooks from the bottom up, so either flip it, or broil it to finish cooking the top.  I poured all the sauce in the pan and then poured the remains over the rice we were eating.

We love salmon, fresh, wild caught, and eat it at least once a week. I've fixed salmon like this from time to time. It always is good. Because we don't like dijon mustard, and use either yellow mustard or hawaiian mustard. Fish needs to be cooked according to the size of the fish. The tail end will be much thinner than a center cut slice will be and will cook much faster. The tail end is also more flavorful. Check your fish often. It can become overcooked and dry very quickly. It should be moist when it's done and flake easily. Delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing. Oh, a little bit of breadcrumbs, or hazel nuts or other finely ground nuts is good sprinkled on the top.

This is great! I was out of dijon so I used spicy brown mustard. I also soubled the sauce to have some to go over the rice. I'm very glad I did. My husband gobbled down 2 pieces, I was wishing I had made more so I could have 2nds myself. My grandson's fiancee who loves fish and is very picky even made more sauce on the side because she liked it so much.

I have been making this recipe for years, however, I always put a top layer of crushed pecans pressed into the honey/mustard (I use a little less mustard that this recipe calls for).  Then bake as indicated.  Excellent!

This was a very layered flavor, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I would cut down the honey next time. I made it with cod, cajun mustard and followed other advice and cooked it in foil for 25min at 350.

Used whitefish and wished I hadn't. This didn't work for me at all. I took about 3 bites and couldn't eat it. But probably would have been better with salmon or a similar fish.

We liked this recipe!  A nice change from our usual salmon with lemon & dill.  I used 6 oz. fillets and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Definitely grease the pan!

Wow! This is the best recipe I have ever used! The meat was a little dry, so I mixed chocolate syrup with some butter, and it was a great topping*! This is great for children!
* Best if served ice cold! Mmm!

I thought this was delicious, and very sweet and tender. I did bake it at 350 for 25 minutes to get it fall off the fork tender. Next time I might cook the sauce separately, since it was carmelized and almost hard by the time the salmon was done.

I made this pretty much as stated, taking in to account others who said to "marinate" it for an hour or two.  (I did 2-3 hours) and it came out perfect.  I upped the oven temperature to 425 and it was done in 20 minutes.  Will definitely make again (and again).  I thought the ratio of honey to mustard was perfect.  (I may have used slightly more lemon juice as I didn't really measure and I love lemon)....

I baked the salmon fillets at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they turned out flaky. I only used 2 TBSP honey so  the dish wouldn't be too sweet.

The rating of 3 is only for my personal note, as the sauce had that sweet and sour flavor which I am not a fan of, however it did taste better than I expected, but I'm going to stick to garlic and citrus flavors for my fish sauces.  This recipe is very easy and I'm sure is a 5 star for people that like the sweet flavor on their fish.

I'm giving this 5 stars because after trying at least 10 other recipes for salmon, this is the first one that my boyfriend and I would be willing to have again. If you do not like sweet honey mustard sauce, you will definitely not like this recipe. It's on the sweet side (but not overly so), so if you want something more mustard-y, you'll need to add a little more mustard. I doubled the sauce because I wanted the salmon to literally cook in the sauce, not just have a glazed top. I ended up baking it at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes just because I was using the oven for something else, but I think it would have been better cooked longer at a lower temperature like the recipe calls for. I also think it would be better marinated for a few hours in the sauce. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I have made this for years, but I add bread crumbs and chopped pecans during the cooking.  Also bake uncovered at 400 for about 15 minutes using salmon fillets.  I just eyeball the honey/ Dijon amount, but keep it at a one to one ratio.  Delish........

It was okay -- I think I prefer this type of topping as a glaze rather than a sauce.   Definitely drop the honey to 2 Tbsp unless you want it extremely sweet.

This was great. I used halibut instead of salmon which worked well.
One reason I gave 4 stars though was because the cooking time was off. I needed to bake for an additional 10 minutes and increase the temperature to 350.

This was a very delicious recipe. I followed the recipe except that I put French's french fried onions on the filets before putting them in the oven. Give it a try.

A simple, yet well-flavored recipe.  The flavors complement each other and prevents the fish from overpowering the dish.  I served the fish on a bed of spinach fettuccine.  I made this dish for my parents and they could not stop raving about the taste (including my mother who is not a big salmon fan).  Prep and cooking times are very accurate.

We loved this recipe, one of the best Salmon recipes I have tried!  The only thing I do differently is marinate the Salmon for a couple of hours in the sauce.  That way the flavor goes all the way through.  It is wonderful though!

This recipe was great!  Instead of separate parts of honey and dijon mustard, I used 3 tbsp of a ready-made honey dijon mustard (French's) and added pureed garlic and onion.  My family loved it!  Best of all, it was so easy to follow.  Thanks for the recipe.

Sauce is way too sweet.  Tried it with hake, which is not as heavy as salmon, but I still think you can do with half the honey, maybe a touch more lemon.  Kids enjoyed it, though.

This was a big hit with my husband and I loved it too. Have made it twice already!  I used a nice fresh piece of salmon but it would be great on any fish.  Quick, easy, and very gourmet.  Don't overcook it.  Fish should just flake but still be moist and tender.  Enjoy

Really delicious! I want to try wrapping the fish in foil next time so see if that cuts down on the cooking time. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used 4 tilapia fillets. The recipe as stated made a little extra sauce. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli! I definitely will make this again.

This was definitely easy to make but I wasn't too keen on the flavor.  I'm not sure what about it is causing all the rave reviews.  As per other reviewers I marinated the fish in the sauce for an hour before cooking.  I baked mine (trout) at 400 for about 15-20 minutes (was cooking french fries at the same time so needed a hotter oven) and it came out flaky and moist, but the flavor just didn't do anything for me.

Excellent.  I used a tiny bit less honey,and the first time I didn't have Salmon and thought I would just try it over my catfish. I have cooked it several times now with Salmon and other fishes.  It is great on all I have put it on.

My boyfriend loved it, I not so much! I don't like salmon at all so don't take my dislike seriously. Had to use English mustard as we don't have dijon so I only used a teaspoon. Aded chili powder to add a little more flavor and alot more pepper. Will cook again. Thank you for posting this recipe.

this recipe is really good.  I used normal mustard, not dijon, added way more pepper, and a little more honey too.  Turns out very sweet and spicy (due to extra pepper)...will definately make again sometime...

This was very easy to make and family enjoyed it very much.  I am not very fond of fish, but the sauce on this recipe help  hide the fishy flavor, will definitely make again.

Loved this! Even my husband who doesn't like fish loved this recipe. Next time I will do it with Salmon filet, the steak has too many bones for me.

I used a white fish rather than salmon and used 2T. Dijon, 2T. Honey and 1T. old fashioned Dijon and cooked it for 15 minutes at 400. It was fabulous.

I made this using cod filets.  I baked them at 425F for twenty minutes.It was really good.  Making it with salmon for my hubby to take to work tomorrow.  This was easy to make after being at work all day.  I served it with baked sweet potatoes, and a fresh tossed salad.

I was looking for a new way to cook tilapia and thought this recipe was worth a try.  The flavor was very pleasing and I'm looking forward to trying the recipe as written with salmon.

We were going to grill our salmon, but that fell through at the last minute. Found this very simple recipe and decided to give it a try. Had a nice balance of sweet and savory. I will keep it in my rotation. Thanks

AWESOME recipe! this was so quick & easy, everyone loved it. we eat a LOT of fish, especially salmon so this was a great new (and super convenient) way to prepare it. the second time around, i also added bread crumbs on top when i baked it and that was a nice, simple touch to a simple dish. i would also recommend putting a dash of garlic salt in with the sauce just to give it a tad more flavor.

I made this tonight, and it was delish! I didn't have time to deal with preheating the oven, so I just pan-seared it on the stove. Hubby loved it too, so I'll be making this again!

I made this delicious dish today. I usually do not look at too many recipes for fish as I have a standard way of doing mine, which is very simple. I thought why not, looks good. WOW! It turned out to be the perfect dish. I did add ½ teaspoon of dill seed. I will make it again for sure and pay more attention to other recipes for fish. Thanks for keeping me humble. LOL

First, the honey mustard sauce was great! But, I don't think it paired with the fish we used which was some type of frozen ocean fish. The fish seemed to taste a lot fishier than when I've made it differently in the past. I would definitely pair the sauce with some chicken or pork, though!

Hubby rated the taste a 4, I think 5 + 5 more for speed and ease! For three fillets of tilapia I added a bit of breadcrumbs and some dill is needed. 350 for 10 minutes, baste again and flip for 10 minutes on other side = yum!

This was so good.  I used 4.5 oz. salmon steaks and cooked it for 40 minutes and it was perfect.  My two and 4 year olds who refuse any fish ate it and the two year old asked for more even!  What a great way to work more fish into our diet.

VERY GOOD. I REALLY LIKED THE SAUCE.  I ADDED A LITTLE MORE LEMON JUICE. ALSO I THINK IF YOU COOK IT AT 325, YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE IT 25-30 MIN. TO BE SURE IT IS COOKED.  I MIGHT DO IT AT 350 NEXT TIME.

I've used this recipe for years!  A variation that I use for a kick is instead of dijon I use Chipotle Mustard, and marinade the salmon or halibut for about an hour, and grill or bake it.

I used only 2 tbls of honey and salted my fish (Orange Roughy) with a little sea salt. It was delicious. I have never had much success when preparing fish, but this one was great! My husband loved it.

My mixture was too runny to really stay on the fish. So the flavor was pretty mild. The edge pieces that sat in the sauce were better. Out of four of us only one thought it was really good.

I first made this fish about a year ago and it was the first time I tried to bake any fish. It is really easy and quite tasty with rice pilaf and mini-carrots! We always cook it for a fast healthy dish.

I really don't think this recipe deserves any stars as it ruined our perfectly good salmon.  Yuck.  The dog enjoyed our dinners though.

for a "trying a new thing" this was an excellent. My husband and I are trying to eat more fish.  We were fighting over who was going to get the last piece.  It is really good on the grill wrapped in foil too.

Really good.  I'll make this again but I'll pass on salmon steaks. Too many bones to pick through while trying to enjoy this truly delicious fish.  Saving to do again with filets.  Thanks for posting this, so easy, so tasty!

I used regular  mustard and sprinkled the fish with Parm cheese. Cooked it for a total of twenty minutes. It was perfect. Next time I will roll the fish in bread crumbs after  glazing it and add Parm cheese after it comes out of the oven and add some cayenne because I love  spicy!

I tried this recipe and it was fantastic. My hubby went back for thirds. I didn't have dijon mustard, but I used yellow mustard. I will try marinating it next time.

This really needed a pinch of salt, and about a tablespoon less of the honey. It was quick and easy, but really bland.

I enjoyed this!  I rarely make salmon, so this was a stretch for me.  Trying to make more fish (husband's request).  He and I both enjoyed it, but our picky 8 year old could barely choke it down.  He is VERY sensitive to what he calls "spicy" foods - but really, he just prefers things very bland.  Our go-to dinner rescue for him is to let him use ketchup on whatever he likes, but even the ketchup didn't help this for him.  I enjoyed the robust flavor of this - I think it's mostly from the mustard - but beware supertasters or parents of supertasters - it's a strong flavor, so not for everyone.

Great Fish!!! Turned out a little on the soggy side but I think if i let the fish marinade longer (overnight) and then shake off more of the juice before cooking it would have been perfect!! Good recipe

It was good. Not as strong of a flavour as I thought it would be, but tasty.

definitely too sweet, so I put a little less honey, took the advice from one of these comments and put a little mao, and I put whole grain dijon mustard in there and made it totally yummy and pretty too. I foil baked it at 425 as recommended from a commenter. It was pretty good! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good...made just as in recipe. What made this nice was it did not overpower the salmon. We used salmon we caught 2 days ago and it just let the meat speak for itself. We used the BBQ vs the oven and it was easy and simple to prepare.

This came out really good. I made a little crumb topping out of lite butter and plain bread crumbs and threw some parsley flakes on for color. Yummy! The salmon was nice and moist. My boyfriend liked it a lot, too. I did have to turn up the heat a bit to get the top toasty. Very good, easy recipe!

This was really good but I took some advice from other reviews.  I cooked it for just over 20min at 350 and I made double the sauce.  I precooked some diced potatoes and added them to the baking dish to finish cooking with the fish.  I Poured sauce over the entire dish before baking.  Next time I will precook the potatoes longer and I will definately marinate the salmon for at least an hour.  The sauce was runny enough that it didn't stick to the salmon well and marinating it in a tight plastic bag would have helped the flavoring.  Sauce tastes great on potatoes.

This was a great recipe. It was really easy and tasted great. I actually used it on catfish fillets, and it was really good. I bet it would taste good on chicken.

This was so easy!  I wasn't sure how a honey mustard sauce on salmon would taste, but since it had great reviews I figured I would give it a shot. It was delicious and  the fish was very moist.  We ate it with brown rice and green beans.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  The only change I made was I used salmon filets instead of steak.

Quick & easy and tastes great to boot!  I used talapia and marinaded the fish for an hour prior to baking as suggested by others.  I also cut back on the honey by 1 Tbs.  The fish was moist and the mustard sauce did not over power the fish.  I will be making this recipe again.

I didn't have salmon, so I used perch instead. I thought the flavor was a little much, and my husband (who's not a mustard fan) didn't like it at all. 

Plus, it made way too much sauce for the fish (maybe my fault since perch is smaller than salmon), so I thought it was soggy. 

Probably not going to try this one again.

Super easy and very good tasting. I would reduce the baking time a bit...I should have taken mine out about 5-8 minutes sooner. But was delicious, especially with a little extra fresh lemon on the side.

I reduced the amount of honey, and used lemon pepper as well as regular freshly-ground black. I used the '10 mins per inch of thickness' rule, and they came out perfect. Thanks, Patricia!

Good recipe. This was my first recipe using fresh salmon and I was pleased with taste. I used only 2 Tbsp honey and it was sweet enough for my family.  I let it marinade for about an hour and baked it in foil for easier cleanup.  Also adjusted for longer cooking time(about 45 minutes) and higher temp (350-375). My husband said it was good and he is not a fan of salmon. Will make again but am going to try some other recipes to compare.

This recipe is fast, easy and delicious.  In addition to the pepper, I added 1/4 teaspoon of Sambala Chili paste.  Gave it an added "kick".  I would definitely make this recipe again.

My husband LOVED this recipe!  Everytime we go out, he now has the salmon, to see if it can compare.  He's had salmon with a citrus butter sauce, salmon with a peach/apricot sauce, so many fancy salmon dishes, & he still likes this one the best!  I do agree with greasing the pan, though.  Definitely left some scales behind!

This is our favorite way to prepare salmon. I add a sprinkling of Panko bread crumbs over the top for some crunch. It's so simple and delicious!

I very often, like most other reviewers in AR, change recipes. This one, however, I made as is and it was great! I might suggest that the thickness of your fillet may dictate time and temp. for baking.

I spread the other ingredients over the salmon, then put everything in a plastic bag. I left this in the fridge for 24 hours then cooked it on the hob.  I used my new copper pan. Incidentally  I cooked  it with the skin on which kept the  fish intact, it was FANTASTIC.

This is good, inexpensive, and certainly easy.  It is not, however, anywhere nearly as good as other salmon recipes on this site.  I would make it again.

Very fast and easy.  A bit too sweet.  If I make it again, I'll use  maybe 2/3 the honey and broil it for a couple minutes at the end to create a bit of a crust on top.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I bought fresh, wild caught salmon. Had the other ingredients at home. Served it with fresh vegetables. Absolutely delicious, light, nutritious and simple to make.  I will be making this over and over again. YUMMY and EASY!

Also, had no problem with the cooking directions. I know every oven is a little different. Mine is a gas oven - baked this at 325 in a glass baking dish uncovered.

I thought this was delightful! I used another reviewer's recommendation to reduce the honey by one tablespoon, increased the oven temperature by 100 degrees, and cut the cooking time in half. I didn't have any Dijon mustard and used stone ground instead. Delicious!

This is an easy, no fuss recipe! I doubled the honey mustard mixture. I also added salt and a bit of garlic. I cooked a little longer than the 20 min at 350 degrees. I made extra honey mustard mixture so that I could use some for my salad. Great dinner!

I made the sauce as written even though I'm not terribly fond of salmon. I did increase the oven temp to 400 degrees as my salmon steaks were large. It was delicious! My husband and I both loved it. I will absolutely make this again.

I have made this recipe twice, once with white fish fillet & once with chub salmon. We preferred the white fish - it was the first time I knowingly ate chub salmon, and it's possible that that's what I didn't like so much the second time. I eyeballed the honey and mustard - probably used a heaping tablespoon of each.

Turned out great and the sauce is wonderful. Instead of baking it in a baking dish, I put it in individual parchment pouches with lemon slices under it at 350. I'm definitely making this again!

this dish was fantastic, I cooked the chicken with some taco seasoning and when it was almost done I added the mushrooms just so it would grab the a good flavor.  It turned out great.  I did add more cheese than it called for.

I'm not that great of a cook so I didn't change anything. I used salmon that was caught in Lake Michigan and frozen since last fall. I think salmon is good, but my wife is nuts about it. I had qualms of it measuring up to her standards. She raved about it over and over. It was quite good! I'll be passing it on to my fellow Lake Michigan fishermen.

This is my new favorite baked fish recipe...so easy and so flavorful!  We used a salmon fillet instead of individual steaks so the cook time was much longer, but I made the sauce per the recipe.  The combination of sweet from the honey and spice from the mustard really accented the salmon.  We're trying to add more fish to our diet and this recipe definitely makes that easier.

My four kids and husband really enjoyed the sauce. After pouring sauce over fish I added dill and let sit for a half an hour. This recipe is a keeper.

fantastic, used mahi mahi on a bed of potatoes and fresh vegetables and wrapped in foil in the oven. Excellent when I don't have time.

Pretty tasty.  I marinated the salmon in the sauce for about 30 min to an hour before I cooked them.

this was easy and fast. i used salmon fillets and accidentally used as much lemon juice as honey/mustard (don't ask) and it came out great anyway!

So easy and very good.  Company worthy.  Only changes - I used only 2TB of honey like another review, and cooked at 400 (with a fan oven) for 20-25 min.  I cooked it in an oval glass Pyrex, which let the sauce bubble up around the fish.

Honestly the glaze is tasty, but I found that it buries the taste of the salmon.  I don't recommend this for your expensive cuts. This is a nice way to get kids to try salmon since it has a sweet glaze.  I personally will try again but only with my cheaper cuts.  Note if you don't like the "fishy" taste, you might like this dish.  However if you like tasting the actual fish, you may want to try something else.  All in all, this is an 'OK' dish.

Boo.  :(  I'm sorry to say I did not enjoy this as much as everyone else did.  I followed the recipe exactly how it is, but it did not cook completely at the time/temp stated and I just didn't enjoy the taste.

Made it with a white soft fish (merluza) and it is much lighter than salmon.  Excellent recipe, very easy to make.

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever used - and really easy!!  I baked in a smaller dish to keep the fish more moist - but increased bake time by 9 minutes. FANTASTIC.

Very easy and good.  I'm not usually a fan of salty/sweet, but this was a nice medium. More a hit of sweetness with zip of mustard. Family ate it up.

Not bad. Fish turned out rather good but I added some dill and oregano (which goes surprisingly good on salmon) to the honey mustard mixture. Also I wish the sauce had been a little more paste-like, as it quickly ran off the fish and into the pan.

This was pretty good, but to me the honey/mustard didn't quite go with fish.  My fiancee really liked it.  I used tilapia, cut the honey by 1 tbs and sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  I am going to try this recipe with chicken.

Easy and delicious.  I baked my thick steaks at 400 F for 25 mins.  Very moist and tasty.
