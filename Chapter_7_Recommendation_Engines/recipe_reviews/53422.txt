I was a skeptic but with several pounds of leftover turkey, I was willing to try this recipe.  It was quick and tasty.  Heating the turkey in the onion/butter mix was just the ticket to removing that "day old" refrigerated taste I find turkey gets.  I also added parsley to add some colour as another reviewer suggested.  Finally, I didn't have turkey gravy so I used a tin of Campbell's chicken broth and omitted the water called for.  It turned out creamy and good!

I hate to say this because it may scare away some perspective users but this was a classic cafeteria meal to me and I LOVED IT!  It was a gooey turkey and gravy stew that tasted great over white rice.  Nothing fancy but great comfort food.

sorry McCormicks, but I changed things around a bit, due to what I had on hand. Made this last year, prior to the holidays; using 2 skinless / boneless chicken breasts, cubed & lightly browned. I sauted 4 chopped stalks of celery & a small amt of chopped sweet onion in a small amt of canola oil, then added the chicken, along with a dash or two of poultry seasoning. Added a can of turkey gravy, and leftover peas and corn I had in the fridge. Tummy's that are sensitive to spices & onions should have no problems and those, like myself with high blood pressure to lower the sodium and bit. Plus the extra celery helps combat the sodium side effects. Hope someone finds this version tasty and helpful. :)

This was actually pretty delicious! I added a chopped carrot to the celery and onion, doubled the turkey, and then threw in some parsley (which, with the carrot, added some colour to an otherwise "brown" meal) and then served it over wild rice. Yum! My brother was over for dinner, and he said it was fabulous. Very comforting food, warm and savoury!

OK I guess. Very easy & healthy, but bland. My little girl ate it, but a little grudgingly. I would advise adding some spices to liven it up.

This was tasty!  I added more turkey, because 1 cup wasn't going to fly at my house.  I also added chopped carrots to the celery and onion saute and added some frozen peas at the very end.  If time is short, I'll bet you could just add some frozen mixed vegtables at the end  and it would still taste great.

I enjoyed this for a quick fix weeknight meal, especially since we had leftover turkey meat.  I had never tried 'packet' gravy before and I'm not too keen on it.  Pretty good recipe for leftovers, but not for guests.

wow, this simple recipe is very delicious! i only made two slight modifications, first being to use 1/2 c. milk with l 1/4 c. water (because we buy 2% milk) & second was to increase the amount of turkey to 1 1/2 cups. i served this over brown rice. thanks mc cormicks!

When I cooked this at home the only remark was fantastic over and over again.  At first a new recipe is "oh no" but after tasting it nothing but raves.  Thanks for being there when I needed a new idea for an old favorite.

extremely easy to make.  great way to get rid of all that excess turkey.  i have to agree with the last reviewer--it is a bit reminiscent of cafeteria food, but we found it a very hearty and comfort dish.

I make this at least once a month.  Great go-to meal.  You can use chicken as well and it is just as good.

Sooo good! I wish I had more turkey to make this again! Maybe I'll try it with leftover chicken.

This is a great wasy to use up leftover turkey and gravy(instead of the gravy mix) Instead of the seasoned salt I used garlic powder, tyme, marjoram, rosemary and a little S&P.  I also added green beans and forgot the milk.  Still was very good...  thanks

This was alright, but my family didn't really care for it.  I followed the recipe exactly - it just wasn't a hit.  I've been asked not to make this again.  Sorry.

I made this for the first time just a few days after Thanksgiving when everyone in our family was getting tired of leftover turkey.  We LOVED it.  DH said it was a definite keeper.  I just wish I'd doubled the recipe!

This was tasty but not pretty. I added dried tarragon for flavor and 2 diced carrots for color. Added parsley on top but it was still really brown and ugly looking. But the tarragon helped with the flavor.

DH loved this, but I thought it was bland.  It wasn't bad, just not very flavorful.  I added frozen mixed vegies; next time I'll just add frozen broccoli as I don't care for peas.

A quick and simple recipe.  I think my family would have preferred it over pasta I think.  I did add peas the cram some veggies down the kids!  :-)

Great recipe for leftover turkey. My family loved it. I used my leftover gravy and added basil. But will try McCormick gravy if i don't have any leftover gravy.
