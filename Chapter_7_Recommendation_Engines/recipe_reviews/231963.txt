I used 2 packets of splenda instead of the 1 cup of sugar and added black pepper and itallian seasoning to the vinegarette. was a hit at the BBQ Potluck.

It was too sweet for us...way, way to sweet!  Cut the sugar in half and it's perfect.  I used all green cabbage as that is what I had on hand.  I wouldn't let it sit for any more than an hour--it started to lose its crunch.  Will make again....thanks!
