I don't have the biggest sweet tooth in the world but I'll never pass up a good peanut butter cookie and these was more than just good, they were excellent. I also added more P.B. then called for. Just a hint to avoid the sticky and messy job of measuring the peanut butter: If a recipe calls for l cup of peanut butter, fill a measuring cup with one cup of water and start dropping spoonfuls of P.B. into the water until the water level reaches 2 cups. The P.B. won't mix with the water and you'll end up with a perfect cup.

HELPFUL SUGGESTION AFTER TRYING THIS SEVERAL TIMES:  This one is okay, but nothing like the rest of her recipes that I have tried ...which ROCK your tummy!!!  I tried this trusting I'd make my many guests happy.  They ate a few but weren't impressed.  Made a different one from this site for a potluck of 300 people, and they said they were SO MUCH better (joey's)!  Update: Following the suggestions of others below, I did this again because I'm always wanting to bake ...and it's still nothing special and not the desired consistency I like in a pb cookie.

Well , I really did not think this recipe sounded that exciting, but my kids wanted Peanut Butter cookies so we tried it and we loved them!!! I altered the recipe, as others suggested, and used 1 cup of butter and no shortening, I added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour. They don't flatten too much when cooking so you can put a lot on one cookie sheet. I baked for 9 minutes and they don't really look done, but they are. They turned out PERFECT!  These were delicious! Great with a glass of milk. I made half plain and added chocolate chips on top of the other half. I posted a picture if interested. Thank you for this recipe...it's a keeper!  If you liked these, try the Peanut Butter Cup Cookies recipe.

Mmmm, tasty! I didn't have any butter or shortening on hand, so I used margarine instead. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. The cookies didn't really spread (probably because I used margarine), but I actually liked the crispiness of the ridges. In addition, I used natural creamy peanut butter, which doesn't have any sugar in it (unlike Jif and Skippy), so I would recommend natural PB if you prefer a cookie that isn't too sweet. I think next time I'll try crunchy peanut butter for a little extra oomph. :) By the way, I posted a photo of the finished product in case anyone's curious.

While these are good, and there is certainly no tweaking necessary, I only rate a recipe five stars if it is absolutely outstanding and somehow sets itself apart from others. I added two chopped King Size Mr. Goodbars and loved it. Again, good recipe, just not extraordinary.

Yay Ms. Sigg! I have tried all of your cookies and you never let me down!:-)  For this recipe I did make some adjustments though. I added about 1/2 cup more of peanut butter. I also added half creamy and half crunchy and that really added to the cookie! Loved it!  Lastly, I put a layer of chocolate chips on half the batch right before I put it in the oven. Mmmm, perfect with a glass of milk.:-) Thanks again! Ally
2-25-07 Made again today on a rainy, gloomy day. They were STILL amazing!  I added milk chocolate chips and 1/8 of a cup of cocoa to the last half of the dough. Yummy! This made for a great lunch (cookie dough and all!):-)

Wow, totally yummy!  I only tried this recipe because I thought if your snickerdoodles were that good, these have got to be okay too.  Sooooo yummy.  Thank you.  I did add a little more peanut butter but still my arms are raised as I bow to you and say "I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy".
All hale the queen of cookies, and please post some more.  Yummy!

I only  rate and review a  recipe  if  it  is  either  really good  or  really bad, and  this one is  REALLY GOOD! Best  PB cookies ever, and mine  looked nothing  like the photo, mine  were  perfectly  round professional looking cookies. They  look and taste like  they  come  from a fine  bakery. Thanks  for  sharing  Beth, these are awesome !

Don't even try another recipe!! This one is just too good. Boyfriend ate the entire batch in less than 2 days and was glad when I didn't want the last two cookies left in the cookie jar. I did as the others mentioned and added another 1/2 c. of PB. This was a big help as just a 1/2 c. of PB would have not been enough.Also do as instructed and take out after 8 minutes. You may not think they are done, as I did, but the will soon finish cooking after being taken out of the oven. All I got to say is no other PB cookie recipes even comes close to this one. EXCELLENT!!!

All I can say is excelent recipe Mrs Siggs, moist and yummy!  I made these cookies in a mini muffin tin and pushed a peanut butter cup into the center of the cookie after it was done cooking. It was a hit, they did not last long.

I finally found the BEST peanut butter cookie recipe. My picky husband who loves peanut butter cookies loves them and even I like them and I am not a big peanut butter cookie fan. I made the recipe exactly as written, however, I reduced the temp. to 325 and I baked for nearly 30 minutes. I should also add that I use my 1/4 c. measurung scoop to scoop out a ball of dough to make a larger cookie which comes out to 4 x 4 inches when baked, which is why I bake my cookies for a longer time. Everyone loves the larger cookies and I get many compliments on them! I only bake 3 or 4 at a time and freeze the remaining dough balls for another day when we want fresh cookies.

i think these are great cookies!  I used 3/4 C. crunchy peanut butter and the remainder creamy.  I did not level the cup off so I probably had a little over a cup of peanut butter.  I press the cookies down with a fork dipped in sugar.  I ALWAYS bake cookies on parchment paper...ALWAYS.  I just think they cook more evenly and  you don't have to grease the pan.  Also, I ALWAYS undercook cookies.  I take them out of the oven while they are still "puffy" on top.  This makes for a much softer cookie.   After I take them out of the oven, I let them sit on the pan until they are firm enough to transfer to a cooling rack.  One little hint if you want that "just baked" taste, pop the cookie in the microwave for about 7-10 seconds before eating.

Pretty good!  I left out the butter flavored shortening  and I added a 1/2 cup more peanut butter.  It needs more peanut butter flavor and less of a "butter" flavor! :)  Thank you, will make again!

These were pretty good, but I felt they could have used a little stronger peanut butter flavor.  I added chocolate chips, but other than that I followed the recipe.  One major thing that would keep me from making these again is that, even though we kept them in a sealed Ziploc bag, they got hard after only one day.

Don't let the photo fool you!  These are by far the best peanut butter cookies that I have made or eaten!  I, as well, used 1/2 cup of butter in place of the shortening as well as an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter; they are just amazing.  Next time I make these I think I'm going to put a few peanut halves on top to see how they turn out.  Try these, you WON'T be sorry.

These are the best peanut butter cookies!  I did add an extra 1/2C peanut butter and 1/4C flour.  They were soft and chewy and very peanut buttery.

Very good cookie! I will cut back on the white sugar a bit next time because they were a little sweet for my tastes. Overall, they came out well with the right amount of chewiness (which, IMO, is the missing factor in most PB cookie recipes.) The only modifications I made was to use all butter (I didn't have shortening) and added a little extra peanut butter and flour as recommended by other reviewers.

This recipe is phenomenal. I'm picky about my peanut butter cookies because they can often come out dry or just not right. Mrs. Sigg's are amazing and perfect. I don't like the crispy, crunchy texture of most pb cookie recipes. I love that these are chewy and perfectly sweet and not too peanutbuttery. I made this without changing the recipe at all. (besides using 1cup of butter instead of 1/2 shortening) I did, though, only keep in the oven for 9 minutes. As another reviewer posted, they will look like they're not done, but let them sit for 2 mins and they are exactly as chewy as you want them. Of the hundreds of cookies I've baked, I think these are my favorite. Definitely my Go-To pb cookie recipe. Even those who are not usually fans of pb cookies loved these when I brought them into work. High recommended recipe!!!!

These are awesome!  By far the best recipe for peanut butter cookies.  Check out Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles on this site also.  You won't be disappointed.

This was good, but not quite there for me. I think this would have been perfect with double the peanut butter and leaving the shortening out. I also had issues with my cookies "cracking", too. Not a huge deal. I did use double-chunk peanut butter. It was the only change I made. I liked that this did not need to be refrigerated--I have impatient cookie eaters and waiting was not an option. 350 for ten minutes with a couple minutes resting on the sheet was just right for me. NOTE: I have to stress to those who don't know this already, use a name brand peanut butter. I can't tell you how many times I made a peanut butter cookie using a cheap or store brand peanut butter and had it either come out greasy or the dough was crumbly and gross. Save yourself the time--use a name brand peanut butter.

These were good.  I rolled them in sugar like someone suggested. Very good.  I had a problem with them cracking, other than that I am happy

Best peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever used. The cookies came out perfect. I used all butter because I don't use shortening and added half a cup of extra peanut butter as other reviewers stated. Perfect cookies and even better several days after baking. MMMMM

These were very easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  I did substitute another 1/2 cup butter, softened for the butter flavored shortening because I didn't have any.  They were great.  I cooked mine for 8.5 minutes per batch.

These cookies are delicious!  I substituted regular shortening for the butter shortening; everything else was as written.  When baked for 8 minutes, they came out soft and chewy inside, light crunchy outside.  When baked for 10 minutes, they came out nice and crunchy throughout but not hard.  (I like 'em crunchy, my kids like 'em soft.)  After a few days in the cookie jar, they all had softened but still tasted good.  These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  Thanks!

I have been looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe for a long time..I finally found it with these. Very simple recipe - cookies are soft and moist. I did increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and watched my timer  (8 minutes)to avoid overbaking. They did seem under done when I took them out. After a few minutes left on the cookie sheet, they are PERFECT!
Great Recipe!

These cookies are fantastic! I have eaten or made enough peanut butter cookie recipes in my life, to have tried quite a lot of recipes. They are typically too greasy, sugary, and even too floury. These had the perfect balance of flavors. Only change I made was subbing more salted butter to replace the butter flavored shortening. I baked them on parchment, and they took between 10~11 minutes. After they cooled they were still chewy and I liked the way they kept a nice round shape. I changed the servings, to 12 from 48, and it yielded 16 cookies using a cookie scoop. I would make these again.ty

I always rate a recipe after I make it as is, before I make any changes.  As it was written, I agree with others that it has very little flavor and is very dry.  I would not make the original recipe again.

I've made it several times since then making changes.  Not surprising, when I made it last time it was pretty close to my original recipe that I've used for years.  Yes, this is a sweet recipe but if you read the ingredients you'll know that.  We only make cookies once a month in my household because cookies are usually supposed to be sweet.

Here are my changes:  I use all butter. I also use 1 cup of chunky peanut butter and 1/2 cup creamy.  I really think that its important to use a good quality peanut butter for the best taste.  I cut the sugars back to 3/4 cup each and added 2 T. honey and extra vanilla, about 1/2 t.  I also add 1 t. baking powder.

I think it's important to say that not over baking these is one key point. They still look a bit under done when they are ready to come out.  My oven takes 9 minutes for that perfect stage.

Pay attention to the peanutbutter you use, some of it is to oily. We use the "reese" brand when we can find it and make sure to sift your dry ingrediant's together before adding to the wet mixture, then follow it exact just watch your oven bake times and you will have outstanding peanutbutter cookies!!

These are the most deicious peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten. I grew up on peanut butter cookies & these are better than mom's. (Don't tell my dad). I would have been much chubbier if her's were as good as these. The only change I made was using 1 egg. I don't care for eggy cookies, so I only use one in all my cookie recipes.

I was not sure fresh baked BUT I left them 4-5 days and O M G they were delicious. I used 1 TB ball, rolled in sugar, flattened with fork. Some we put 1 chocolate chip in the middle.  They flattened down to a crisp sugar cookie depth and this made them SOOOO good. 
I used all butter flavor shortening. 2 TSP of vanilla--I find adding more vanilla to recipes makes them sweeter without extra sugar.

My family L-O-V-E-S these cookies!  They disappear before they can even cool down.  The peanut butter taste was subtle, so I added a couple of tablespoons of chopped peanuts to the last batch I made.  I've used this recipe 3 times in the last 2 weeks.

Although I have an allergy to peanut butter, I used the soy-butter "tastes just like peanut butter" substitute.  These were a bit floury, but satisfied my craving for a soft and crunchy pb cookie!

Great recipe but I did have to alter a bit for hubby's diabetic diet... I used part oat flour, part agave syrup along with half the called for ingredients...  After making the first batch the kids complained not sweet enough so I rolled the rest in sugar then baked; I remember peanut butter cookies as a girl; my mom used to let me press them with the fork.. :)

Very good peanut butter cookie recipe. I made some with the criss-cross pattern in them and without and the ones without were so much better. They were so moist and soft. Will never make that pattern in the cookies again. It flattens them and makes them hard.

These were actually just average peanut butter cookies. If you already have a peanut butter cookie recipe, stick with what you have, as these were nothing special and were really kind of plain.

My husband loves peanut butter cookies. He's begged me all week to make them. I'm so glad I made these! They are wonderful!! The best I've ever made. The right balance between chewy and crispy. I had to make one minor change, but I don't think it would affect anything either way. I only had 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter, so added 1/4 crunchy to make the difference. The extra little chunks of peanut are wonderful. So the recipe, as stands, is a keeper!! Thanks

I am in love!!! I was a bit apprehensive to make the recipe as is, because of all of the reviews but I did and I'm glad. I don't know why people are saying that they are hard but mine remained soft and moist...yum!!! I don't think that this recipe would benefit by adding more peanut butter because the ingredients just all work, anything more or less would create a different product and you have to taste this cookie to know just how good the original recipe is. A defenite addition to my recipe box!!

I used 1 cup of margarine, more like 1½ cups of crunchy peanut butter, and lowered my oven to 350 (the first batch had somewhat dark bottoms, but were still tasty). It made just over six dozen cookies for me. These were REALLY good (and very similar to my normal PB cookie recipe)... With the crunchy peanut butter, they tasted very much like the packaged Dad's Peanut Butter cookies, if you have ever had the pleasure of trying them. Thanks, Beth!

Oh WOW!...I made these...took them to church...thought I would have some left for my husband I to scarf down later...was I wrong...*laugh*...everyone LOVED these cookies...We don't eat white sugar or flour...so I substituted wheat pastry flour for the flour & Rapidura sugar for the white & brown sugar (used 2 cups) and they were great AND healthy!!! I also halved the peanut butter (used organic)...1/2 a cup crunchy & 1/2 creamy...was delicious...also added milk chocolate chunks (Endangered Species Chocolate bars from our local health food store)...these were AWESOME, healthy and GONE!!!...Thanks for sharing Beth...*smile*

Both my husband and I were disappointed in these cookies. I read all the wonderful reviews, but we didn't care for either the texture or the taste. For one thing, I think they need more peanut butter. Thank you, but I will continue my search.

This recipe is wonderful and loved by everyone that tried the cookies made.  Only thing that was done differently was that I used 1 1/2 cups of creamy peanut butter instead of 1 cup and a little extra vanilla (I don't measure vanilla, I just put in what looks good, lol).  Either way, my son is wanting me to make another batch as he has found a new cookie favorite.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Well well Mrs. Sigg, 4 for 4 of your delicious cookie recipes now exist at my house!  We loved these, they taste just like my moms.  I baked them for 8 minutes, took them out of the oven, topped with a hersheys "hugs & kisses" (for Valentines day) and popped them back into the oven for 2 minutes.  Perfect!  Thanks for the great PB cookie recipe!

I have been looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe and I think that I finally found it.  I made these with Hershey Kisses and they tasted really good.  If you make the cookies with Hershey Kisses, this is my recommendation as to how to make the chocolate soft and so that it never hardens.  Bake the first batch of cookies, without the Kisses, to see how long they take to bake in your oven.  The next batch, put them in for two minutes less than they need and don't criss cross the cookies with a fork.  Pull out the cookies and put a Hershey Kiss in the center of each one.  Bake for two more minutes.  Let cookies cool.  The chocolate will be nice and soft and will never harden completely again.

These were great.  Not too sweet, not too soft or hard, plus not too flat and just fluffy enough. I did as the other reviewers said and added in an extra 1/2 cup of flour & 1/2 cup peanut butter (crunchy).

I baked these cookies with the kids.  We had fun and they turned out delicous!  I substituted regular shortening and added a  bit more butter.  I also added about a half cup of extra peanut butter.  I did not have baking soda so I used baking powder.  Even with all the tweaking of ingredients they turned out great!

While the flavor of these cookies is great, I was hoping they would be chewy and moist.  Instead they were more delicate and melted in your mouth, like a previous reviewer mentioned.  (Not a bad thing.)  I think I was just hoping for a different texture.   But thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good recipe, but I am still looking for the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe!  These didn't seem to have enough peanut butter taste, instead I could really taste the butter flavored shortening.

Definately worth a FIVE and then some!!!! This is absolutely the BEST cookie recipe I've EVER tried...and at my age, I've tried an awful lot of them!!!! The only thing I did differently was to roll them in decorative sugar before flattening them with the fork. Thanks for sharing Mrs. Sigg.....all the rest of yours are amazing as well!!!!!!

Very easy & quick to make.  I cut this recipe in half and used brown sugar only, regular shortening and a little more peanut butter.  I baked for exactly 8 min and they came out soft & soooo yummy.

Followed recipie to a T and didnt really care for it, but thats just me. They just didnt WOW me. They do make a good cookie but I like mine with more of a peanut butter chewy taste rather than a crunchy taste.

These cookies were delicious.  Exactly what my husband and I were looking for.  I was trying to decide between this recipe and a couple other ones that were rated highly.  I didn't use shortening because I didn't have any but they turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I actually didn't use peanut butter but substituted Sunflower butter because my daughter has allergies.  I cooked them for 8 minutes and let them sit on the tray and then transferred them to a cooling rack.  I let them sit out overnight to cool and when I woke up they were still soft in the middle.  The 'peanut butter' taste was really good too.  This is going to be my husband's new favorite recipe.

SO good.  After a failure with chocolate chip cookies, I was nervous making cookies from scratch.  I was between this and the Classic peanut butter cookie recipe from this site.  I chose this one, and had to use a cup of butter because I didn't have any shortening.  I also used a little more than a TSP of vanilla extract... on accident... and added 1/2 C. peanut butter (reduced fat) per suggestions of reviewers.  These were SO yummy!  I froze 18 and baked approximately 18 more (I ate so many, I'm not sure how many I baked!).  Anyway, these are amazing.  The next day, they were crunchy, so I popped them in the microwave for about 20 seconds for three and they were like fresh!  Fabulous... I think I'll make these every two weeks :)  Next time, though, I may use one egg and one egg YOLK to make them a bit chewier.

These cookies are beautiful, with just the right amount of peanut butter flavor.  I've made them plain, and with chocolate chips, which makes them even better.  I also replaced the shortening with butter, and used a little less than called for. Delish!

These were very tasty cookies, crispy around the edges and soft in the middle.  The recipe make exactly 6 dozen 3 inch cookies.  The dough was very soft, so I left them in the fridge overnight and baked them in the morning at 350 for 8 minutes.  I find that 375 is a little too hot for cookies and they tend to burn.  Very tasty.  I also rolled them in sugar and then dipped my fork in sugar before I pressed it into each cookie. Very tasty.

Excellent peanut butter cookie...I add about a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, because that is what Mom always did...adds a little something extra.  I love the fact that it is half butter and butter flavored shortening.  I do the same for my chocolate chip cookies, and chocolate-chocolate chips cookies.  If you use all butter, your cookies will be flat.  Great cookie!!!

DELICIOUS!! I have tried a few different PB cookie recipes and so far this one is far the best. I read quite a few reviews before I made them and I did take the advice from one of the gals that made a few adjustments. PERFECT!! So moist. I used 1c butter, no shortening, additional 1/2c pb and additional 1/2c flour, I baked them for about 8 minutes. I didn't grease the cookie sheet, they were good. Recommend to the bakers that want to try something different :)

Excellent recipe. I used the Jif w/ honey type peanut butter and thought it could have used a bit more peanut butter... however that's my own personal opinion and luckily it can be adjusted per individual tastes. Keeper for me :)

Just made these cookies and they are delicious. I also used 1 cup butter and no shortening, and 1 1/2 cups of PB. Didn't flatten out like others and stayed soft with a slightly crisp outside. Very good. Thanks Sigg.

Loved these.  Made them as directed, but used crunchy peanut butter because it's what I had.  I also dipped my fork in sugar to flatten them.  May try some mini-chocolate chips in them next time.

These are wonderful!  If you take them out at 8 minutes or a little less, they are nice and soft.  They will be really soft, but will set as they cool.

These were *really good cookies. The only thing I changed was to use all butter instead of half shortening (personal preference)They have a great peanut butter flavor, and I'm just really pleased with how they turned out. I made half of them into peanut blossoms. I got approximately 6 dozen good sized cookies out of one batch.

These were awesome!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I substituted butter, and they still turned out really good.  I'm not a cook by any means, but these were easy to make (just a little messy).

These are very good. I made one change because of allergies. I changed the shortening and the butter with coconut oil. I added a couple drops butter flavoring. I know this sounds like a wierd switch, but this cookie can be made dairy free with great results. 
I have a child that can't have dairy or soy, so no butter or shortening. I was really happy with the end result of this recipe.

Awesome recipe! The cookies are moist, soft, and flavorful. I used creamy peaanut butter and the cookies came out fantastic. The cookies don't spread out much, so feel free to fill up your cookie sheet. I dipped my fork in sugar before criss-crossing the cookies for some added sweetness. Enjoy!

I made these for a coworkers birthday.  My husband LOVES chocolate chip cookies - but could not keep his hands off these!!  He actually said they were the BEST peanut butter cookies he's ever had. I can't wait to see what my coworkers think. I did make some changes by increasing the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, and rolling them in sugar before baking.  WOW!! YUMMY.  I will be trying all of Mrs. Sigg's cookie recipes!

Great peanut butter cookies!  I did find them a little crumbly, not quite as chewy as I would like, but the flavor was very nice.  I also added 1/2 extra cup of peanut butter, and I rolled a few batches in sugar, and topped some with milk chocolate chips.  This one is a keeper!  Way to go Mrs. S!

I decided to give these cookies a try, more so for my family than for myself, as I am not a huge fan of peanut butter in general.  These were FABULOUS!!!!!!!  I just polished off two cookies and had to write in.  I did put the dough in the fridge prior to forming into balls as others had recommended, and baked them for 8 minutes as I prefer mine softer.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great new cookie recipe!

You are my new hero Beth! I have made 3 of your cookie recipes in the last 2 days and they are all excellent! My favorite is the oatmeal raisins....but they are all impressive. These are yummy, big, soft, peanut buttery goodness. Keep baking so we can all enjoy your successes.

I somehow lost my families favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.  It was a sad, sad day when I went to make peanut butter cookies and couldn't find my recipe.  I did a search here at allrecipes and came upon this one.  It sounded a lot like my old recipe.  My family loves these cookies and this recipe has successfully replaced my old, lost recipe.  We like these cookies just as they are, but I have added semi-sweet chocolate chips and peanut butter chips along with using chunky peanut butter too.  Those cookies turned out great also.

Excellent cookies!  Made exactly as written, well except I used all butter since I didn't have butter flavored shortening on hand.  They came out great.  Definitely use a fork to press them down and make the "criss cross", I didn't do it on the first batch and it definitely affects the texture of the finished product.  I used air bake cookie sheets and as suggested by another reviewer, 11 minutes was about right on the center rack of my oven.

I'm not a very experienced baker, but I really liked the way these turned out. Taking cues from previous reviewers, I upped the PB by 1/2 cup and cut back on the flour by 1/4 cup. I also added a bag of chocolate chips. The resulting batter was a bit too wet to roll into balls until after it was refrigerated. My oven's a little wonky, but the best batches - provided you like chewy cookies - took 11 minutes. They were just slightly brown around the edges and looked really pale in the middle. still, I trusted it and sure enough, they worked. My only comment is that it's hard to gage how peanuty the flavor was because the chocolate chips kind of overwhelm the flavor. Not that I'm complaining...

i made this with a little extra peanut butter and would cut down on the salt and sugar next time. i found them to be a little tough and more crispy than i like my cookies. i cooked them for precisely 8 minutes and anything more would have been burnt. my coworkers seemed to enjoy them, but for anyone who likes soft, chewy cookies... i highly suggest you move on with your search.
overall: crispy texture, a little on the sweet side, a bit too salty, good peanut butter flavor.

This is one of the worse peanut butter cookie recipes I've ever used.  The cookies don't even taste like peanut butter.  Save your peanut butter and keep searching for a better recipe.

the recipe produced delicious cookies...just like mom's!  the only addition my family enjoys is an unwrapped chocolate kiss added to the center as they are removed from the oven.

I don't bake cookies often and have a problem with underbaking or overbaking.  Regardless, we didn't feel these cookies were as great as everyone says.  It does need more peanut butter flavor and I used crunchy peanut butter, which was good.  We are looking for a more cakey-like peanut butter cookie so I will be trying more recipes.

These are very good cookies--however, I think they need more peanut butter because the peanut butter taste was a bit lacking.  I did use 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. regular crisco (not butter flavored kind like the recipe calls for), so maybe that is why?  These cookies spread out more, do not hold the crisscross shape well, and need only 8-8 1/2 min. in the oven.  Make sure your hands are slightly damp before rolling and the dough won't stick to you as much.  Beth's recipes are awesome, but for the peanut butter cookies...sorry, Beth, but I think Jif's recipe is better.  (the milk, more vanilla and all shortening make a HUGE difference in taste).

I used Kirkland organic creamy peanut butter and it worked out great with this recipe.  I also dipped the balls of dough in a bowl of sugar before I marked them with a fork.   Which is a necessary step / staple  that was missed in this recipe.

One of my favorite cookie recipes. I used 1 cup of butter and no shortening. (Just because I didn't have any on hand) I also used 1/2 cup Skippy Natural creamy peanut butter and 1/2 cup Skippy Natural Crunchy Peanut butter. I also added peanut butter chips. I would not change a thing. Cooked for 8 minutes and they were perfect! Great recipe!

Excellent! The only pb cookie recipe I use. I reduce salt slightly, by one quarter (use 3/4 tsp. instead of 1 tsp.).  In my oven, these bake for nine minutes and produce a cookie that's crisp on the outside and chewy inside.

These are very good, but it wasn't the kind of peanut butter cookie I was looking for.  I ate one just after they cooled off from the oven and they practically melt in your mouth.  The next morning they still melt, but have a little more chewiness to them.  I added another 1/2c peanut butter simply because others had suggested it.  I was looking for more of a chewy cookie ... something that felt like it had more 'substance' to it, but these are great if you're looking for a light, melt-in-your-mouth pb cookie.

This was delicious! I used a cup of butter and left out the shortening.  I also baked for 9 minutes even though they don't look done, they are. Like others suggested add extra peanut butter.  To avoid measuring the peanut butter I just used one whole 16 oz jar (measures out to about a cup and a half). These are great cookies!

I have an extremely picky Sis-in-law and she has a particular type and taste of Peanut Butter cookie that she will even eat.  I have tried countless recipes for Cookies and haven't found a good one yet......until this one.  She loved them.  I thought that they were perfect because you have the slight crunch when you first bite into them and then you share that joy with a soft chewy cookie.  I love that combo.  Finally I can stop trying different recipes.  This is a winner.  Thanks Mrs. Sigg's!!

My family loved these - even my picky eater daughter (who doesn't like peanut butter) admitted she loved these cookies!  We used 1/2 cup margarine & 1/2 cup unsalted butter - because that's what we had on hand and they tasted great!

Great cookies.  The only substitution I made was to use regular shortening because I didn't have butter flavor.  They were wonderful and cooked up nicely.

These cookies must have been tasty because when I looked in the cookie jar two days later they were all gone but no one knows who ate them. I did not have a problem with them becoming hard later as other reviewers did. They do have a strong butter taste so maybe next time I will use 3/4 cup of butter. I will make them again.

I made these cookies looking for ALOT of PB flavor,  I did not get that but can add to the recipe so I won't down it for that.  The cookies are hard, then some gave me a trick.  I wanted soft PB COOKIES,  I made the cookies, the recipe is a good one, then added two sliced of bread to the bags I stored them in!  The got really soft and the boyfriend considered them a home run!  10/10.  Take the recipe and make it your own!

These Biscuits were a hit at my house!  I used someone's suggestion of an extra 1/2 cup of PB and flour and all butter rather than shortening.  Sweet and crunchy (I used crunchy PB).

YUMMY! I switched out eggs for 1 tsp active dry yeast to 1/4 cup warm water per egg. I let set up while I mixed all first ingrediants together leaving the eggs to be placed in right before the dry ingrediants. I used 1 cup (2 sticks) Can't Beleive It's Not Butter for the butter and shorting and I baked at 350 degrees for 7 to 8 minutes as I like my cookies to be on the soft side. they turned out so wonderful! Thank you very much for sharing. My son is allergic to eggs that is why I had to switch the eggs out and he LOVED them!!!

Made these rather unexpectedly for cookie platters. was out of oatmeal an had already mixed the wet. This one seemed the most favorable available. Well, they were alright. My dad didn't even finish his, an he loves pb an choc!! [[had added peanut M&M's]]. My mom said they were 'alright..fine'. Hmm. I don't think I'd make them again..although people ate them when they were set out so idk..Four that reason I'll give it 4 stars

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! Once they've cooled the cookies are soft, but not so soft that they fall apart while you're eating it. Perfect! This will be the peanut butter cookie recipe I always use.

I really don't have any thing to compare them to because I am a new baker.  At the suggestion of others I added more peanut butter (at least 1/2 cup more) and since I didn't have shortening on hand I used butter.  They were YUMMY!

My first day on this site and the first recipe I tried. Normally I like my cookies and biscuits quite crunchy, so next time I won't make them quite so 'chubby', but they are so moreish! We added a few chocolate drops to the top of half a dozen just before putting them in the oven, which was nice too. All in all, a really easy recipe that tastes great! Thankyou :)

I tried this recipe because I absolutely loved Mrs. Sigg's snickerdoodles, but have to admit that I was disappointed with the results of these peanut butter cookies.  My family agreed that they were "just okay" do to a lack of overall flavor (perhaps to do using shortening) and peanut butter taste.  I went back to my old recipe, which contains a cup of butter and two cups of peanut butter, and everyone was much happier.

Very good.  I added an extra 1/2 cup each of flour and peanut butter.  This made a lot of cookies(if you make small 1 1/2"-2" cookies you will get about 8 dozen).  My family loved them.

I loved these cookies.  I am not a peanut butter cookie person but I got to admit these are great.  I did add dark chocolate chips just because I love dark chocolate but regular milk chocolate would probably be better.  Instead of greasing the bottom of the cookie sheets I used cooking spray. When I took them out of the oven I didn't think they were done but once cooled they were just perfect.

I was looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe that was easy to do. I came across this recipe and tried it. I did only one thing different to them I added some peanutbutter/chocolate chips to the mix. Only because I was going to make them with Hershey Kisses, and Didn't have any on hand. So, I thought I would try them with chips. I'm glad I did cause everybody liked them. This is a keeper =) =)

I'm sorry, I normally would never give a one star or a negative review, but like some of the other people on here, I was very disappointed with the way these turned out.  I'm always trying to find the perfect recipe and with all the 5 star reviews I thought this would be it. They were really gooey and liquidy so trying to do the criss cross was almost impossible and they just stayed way to airy.  I followed the ingredients with a few of the modifications like all butter, an extra 1/2 cup of flour and peanut butter, but still came out very "bland".  I used to cook the best cookies and told my husband so..he has yet to see that this is true. I guess I really know how to pick em'. Again, sorry for the negative review, but I was just very disappointed.

I find these to be very good peanut butter cookies.  I thought they were a little bland the first time I made them, so this time I used chunky peanut butter and they are much better.  I also added another 1/2 cup of flour.  They stayed a little thicker and chewier with the extra flour.  I like to roll the balls of cookie dough in sugar before I use a fork  to make the criss-cross pattern on the top.  Overall, a real keeper!

Man, I thought with over 375 reviews, most being 4-5 stars these would really rock the house. They're pretty average to us. Maybe less than. They fall apart, very weird texture and consistency. And, the first cookie sheet was pretty bland so I added some peanut butter to the rest of the batter, that helped but not significantly. I'm adding chocolate chips to some now, maybe that'll liven things up!  If you haven't tried these, keep looking for another recipe, this isn't 'THE ONE.'

My aunt asked me to make some peanut butter cookies for her classroom b/c they were having a party. I came across this recipe and i noticed while reading the reviews that Mrs. Siggs has more cookie recipes out and they all have outstanding reviews. Thats when I knew this was the recipe to go with and boy was I glad I did. These are by far the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. And everyone loved them!! Thanks Mrs. Sigg! I will be trying your other cookie recipes!  OH P.S. - Use natural peanut butter! and add peanut butter chips at the end if you want it really peanut buttery lol

I've finally found the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe! These cookies are sooo good. Soft and chewy not crumbly like other recipes that I have tried. It has the perfect amount of pb flavor the only thing I changed was that I used crunchy pb. My family loved them.

Wow! These taste just like the Nutter Butter cookies!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We LOVE them! Just remember to pull them out at 8 minutes, any longer and they'll be too crisp. I also thought I messed them up because by accident I added the salt and the baking soda to my creamed butter and sugar but they still tasted wonderful. You can not mess these up and they are delicious!

These cookies are great, but EXCELLENT with the following few changes.  I found the texture to be much better with regular shortening, not the butter-flavored type.  the butter in the recipe makes them crispy already.  I also use CRUNCHY peanut butter, and add mini peanut butter cups unwrapped and cut into quarters.... YUMMMMMMY!!!

This is one of the best peanut butter cookie recipes I've ever had.  I put a heaping cup of peanut butter into them when I make them, and for even better cookies with less mess, I make them in the food processor.  If the dough seems oily in the food processor, don't worry.  They will still turn out wonderfully.

This is an excellent recipe! I rolled the dough into balls and did the criss cross with a fork but I sprinkled the tops with a course sugar. They were wonderful! Rave reviews!!

FANTASTIC! Thanks to Mrs. Sigg, I have been using this recipe exclusively for years and finally decided to write a review. These cookies are the ideal peanut butter cookie. The texture and the flavors are remarkeably good. I have been known to increase the peanut butter by approx 1/4 cup, sometimes add Reece's Piences and have a preference for chunky peanut butter. However, the base recipe is flexible enough for customizing. Anyway, Thanks Mrs. Sigg, you have had a hand in many happy cookie memories! : )

This recipe is fabulous, and one of my husband's favorites! I like to make them bite size...they make more cookies, and people feel better about taking one at work because they're smaller :o).

Mrs Sigg's has another 5 star cookie in this recipe.  But ofcourse I took it too another level- First I used 2 sticks butter(no shortening-didn't have) and added 1 1/4 cup peanut butter(per other reviews) and instead of 2 1/2 cups flour-I did two cups flour and 1 cup oatmeal(blended into powder)....Now that is one heck of a peanut butter cookie!!  Thanks for the share!

These are great.  I love the snickerdoodle recipe from Mrs. Sigg as well.  I don't add any extra peanut butter as I like them as they are--I don't like a really strong peanut butter taste.  These are great with chocolate chips too!

I made these cookies for my nephew for graduation. Peanut butter cookies are his favorite! Must I say he stated "Auntie these are so good, and I'm not sharing them" (lol) Good thing I tried kept a few of them for my household. 
I too took the advise of others and added about 1/2 cup more peanut butter and about another 1/2 cup of flour no problems with sticky dough! I baked them for about 11-12 min. we like them cripsy, but still soft in the center. And the rest is history!!!!! Thanks Mrs. Siggs!

These were great.  As per other reviews I used all butter and lots more peanut butter.  Also, I used No Sugar Added Peanut Butter and they were still very sweet.  Make sure you have plenty of ice cold milk on hand!!!!!!

For Father's Day, I told my husband to pick anything that he wanted for me to bake, and he chose peanut butter cookies. I normally don't make peanut butter cookies, so i didn't have a recipe for one.  I chose this recipe and added the additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter as well as rolled them in sugar before baking.  They were fantastic!  My husband has already had 6 - and i just made them!  Awesome recipe - thanks!

I made these on a whim today, and I was very pleasantly surprised by how much everyone liked them. They are just a little too sweet in my own opinion and I might alter the sugar just a little next time.

Mrs. Sigg knows her cookies. I have also made her snickerdoodles which are awesome! These are great!  I also added about 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I think I will cut that back next time.  After they cooled they were a little on the dry side.  I will definitely make again.

Great cookies !  I only had 1/4 c (1 stick) of butter, so I substituted butter flavor Crisco.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of crunchy peanutbutter for a more "peanutty" taste.  Keep these in a ziploc bag with a piece of bread or two and they'll stay soft.

Do make these!!! The best peanut butter cookies I have ever had! I followed recipe except I added an extra half cup of peanut butter because too often the cookies I make do not have a stong enough peanut butter flavor. Adding the extra made these perfect!!! This makes a bunch so is great for a crowd and you will get great reviews!!!!

Don't be fooled by the picture...I think someone got a little mixed up and that is a pic of choco chip cookies made w/margarine or somethin...NOT THESE!  These are perfect, beatiful, extremely delish PB C's....not flat at all! (of course I rolled mine in sugar for a special touch, and also, didn't have butter so used shortening, plain kind but go figure I had some butter flav that I added to compensate.)  Best PB C's our family ever ate!

These are unbelieveably good!! I don't usually have trouble staying out of cookie dough, but I am constantly eating this one!! I put chocolate chips in mine and it was wonderful. I will make these over and over. I am going to try making chocolate star cookies from this recipe. Thank you!

I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter cookies, but these are pretty good!!  I used all butter because I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, and I also added some leftover mini-chocolate chips that I had on hand.  These will be gobbled up pretty quickly!!

Disappeared very quickly...I ate far too many, but simply couldn't help myself, they were so yummy!  I made no revisions to this recipe and the cookies were delicious.

I followed the directions exactly, and added milk chocolate chips (like others have done).  The chocolate was a great addition, and I will definitely be making these more often.  

I generally don't like making cookies (too much work), but this was simple recipe, and didn't require that much effort.

Now these are some yummy cookies! I compiled advice from some of the other reviews and my cookies turned out pretty darn fantastic! Here's what I suggest. Add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter, add a bit more flour  (1/2 cup-ish, they're less sticky that way) and roll the cookie balls in a bit of sugar before smooshing with fork. I added a chocolate chip to the center of each for some flair!! I will write this one down in the old recipe book. It's a keeper!!!

I gave the cookies 5 stars because my youngest son does not care for peanut butter that much and he ate 5 out of the first dozen. I added chocolate chips 3/4's a bag. My whole family including myself would still be eating the cookies if I let us.

Wonderfully light and fluffy!  Before this recipe, I had always found peanut butter cookies a bit boring, but these were terrific.  (I added half a bag of white chocolate chips to mine.)  Keep a close eye on them the last couple minutes of baking though, don't want those bottoms to get too dark!  The finished cookies are worth 'babysitting' the oven for.

Very good and very easy to make.  My son loves p.b. cookies and gave these a big thumb's up.  I compared and these seem to be the exact recipe, only doubled, that came out of my old Better Homes and Garden Cookbook.  I left out the salt as there is plenty in the p.b. already.

Very good cookies made them exactly as the recipe demands. The Dough wasn't runny at all, it may be because I sifted the flour or because I added extra crunchy peanut butter. They stay soft and ofcourse have a great peanut butter taste. The pictures don't do these cookies justice.

I also thought of making ice cream sandwiches from these cookies just put icecream in the middle and drizzle with chocolate that hardens on the outside.

These cookies looked great and the texture was perfect.  I had to add more flour, too.  Next time, I'll nix the salt. Probably turned out salty because I used margarine instead of butter flavored shortening.  I'm going to try again tonight (with margarine, no salt)!

Great peanut butter cookie.  I added milk chocolate and peanut butter chips to mine.  I can understand the reviews that stated it needed more flour to roll the dough into balls. I just refrigerated my dough for 30 minutes or so, and was able to roll them without adding flour.

These cookies turned out SO good!!  I used regular shortening as that was all I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I refridgerated the dough for an hour at least, so stickiness was not a problem.  Rolled them in sugar before baking.  Baked for exactly 10 minutes and they were delicious!!  Huge hit with my children and husband as well!!

I was looking for a really good peanut butter cookie and decided to try this recipe - look no further!  These cookies are wonderful - crispy edges with soft centers and fantastic peanut butter flavor.  I hid them from my kids so I could eat them all myself! I must note that my cookie dough came out very "fluffy" so I couldn't roll the dough into balls or mark the cookies with a fork, just spooned the dough onto the cookie sheets, so the end result wasn't as pretty but still incredibly good. Make sure you don't overbake! Thank you Mrs. Sigg!

This excellent recipe is identical to the one I grew up with, but thought I'd lost. (I found it immediately after finding this one.  Go figure.)  Although this is a very forgiving recipe, a better way to deal with sticky dough is to chill it for about an hour before rolling into balls instead of adding extra flour.  That way your cookies will stay light and chewy.

Great recipe! I made minor changes.  I used (2 and 1/4 cups)whole wheat flour instead of regular with virtually no change in taste! I added a bag of milk choc/peanut butter chips.  And finally, I used all natural peanut butter; all with a terrific outcome!

I don't like peanut butter cookies, but everyone that had one thought they were fabulous!  I used regular shortening because it is what I had on hand. I baked them for 11 minutes and left them on the cookie sheet as recommended.  I didn't have any difficulty with the cookies getting mushed or breaking apart.

These cookies are delicious.  However, if you are using air-insulated cookie sheets, I suggest cookie them for 10-11 minutes, instead of 8-10.  Great recipe!

My boyfriend LOVES peanut butter, but I'm not a big fan. However, even I LOVE these cookies. They just melt in your mouth. Instead of crossing the top of the cookie I  added a little Hershey Kiss into the center of each one as soon as I got them out of the over...WOW!! Totally Scrumdidly!

Mrs. Sigg i don't know if i should thank you or say shame on you.  I am now in the kitchen once a week baking cookies.  These are a big big hit. Everybody wants some so that don't last long at all.  But i am not baking in this heat more than once a week!!  i didn't change anything just added a bag of chips, they come half peanut butter chip and half chocolate chips; nor did i criss cross them with a fork(chips made that imposible)  anyway thanks again!

Can I say one word? AWESOME! Everyone I know loves these cookies...even my husband that doesn't like peanut butter that much. I made a few changes, as suggested by others too: roll in white sugar before placing on cookies sheets (this is how my mom made them years ago!) and use the fork to "flatten" the cookies or else they will stay in the ball shape since these don't really flatten on their own. Add semisweet chocolate chips for an even more sinfully delicious cookie! I also use a whole 18-oz jar of Skippy creamy peanut butter, since its close enough to a cup.

Added on 6/10/05: I use this recipe on a regular basis now and people KNOW me for it! They always request this when I have to bring something. ("Did you bring those Peanut Butter Cookies?")

I don't really like peanut butter cookies, but I wanted a change of pace, so I tried these, and boy am I glad.  These are wonderful cookies; the texture and taste are fabulous (I used 1.5 cups of peanut butter).  Also, since I'm a chocolate lover, I added a cup of mini chocolate chips--it's a good combo!

Yum Yum Yum!!! These are sooooooo good.  I made the adjustments that were recommended in the other reviews and they turned out absolutely perfect.  I increased the peanut butter to a cup and a half and the cookies have the best peanut butter taste.  Also, I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, so I just used regular Crisco and the turned out fine.  I also rolled the peanut butter balls in granulated sugar before criss crossing them on the cookie sheet just because that's how my dad used to make them.  A wonderful recipe, I won't be using any other!  Thanks Beth

These cookies weren't too greasy or too hard. I left them in for about 8-9 minutes.  Texture was good and recipe made a good looking peanut butter cookie.  Next time I make them I am definately going to omit the salt as I could taste it.  I even used less than what the recipe called for.  I didnt have the butter flavored shortening so i used butter instead.

GREAT COOKIES!!
This is one I will hold onto. I use butter flavored Crisco instead of butter and crisco. It never hurts to add a little more peanut butter either. Thanks for a great recipe.

I had to pop in and let everyone know how good these cookies are!  Not your ordinary, everyday peanut butter cookie, these are really special.  They are a breeze to mix together and turn out moist, chewy and absolutely irresistible to peanut butter lovers.  I made them extra large and baked them a little longer because my friends and family love big handfuls.  Thanks for coming through again, Beth.

I made these for my aunt, who likes her cookies crunchy.  I overbaked them about 4 minutes and let them cool completely. They were perfect!  I also baked a few at the time suggested and they were great for me, as I like my cookies chewy.  The only change I made was using all butter instead of  butter flavored shortening.  I will definitely make these again!

Turned out awesome!!!  I doubled the recipe because I have teenage boys in the house.  They turned out great!  I used all natural peanut butter and I used likely about a half cup extra just because I like a little extra peanut taste.  Other than that, the measurments are all spot on.

I made a few changes...I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup Canola oil.  I did not use any shortening.  I added 1/4 cup Dutch cocoa and 2 heaping tablespoons of ground flaxseed.  U went under just a bit on the flour.  The cookies are wonderful!  So soft.  Don't do longer than 8 minutes in the oven.

I followed all the directions to the letter, even to the size of the cookie.  I was very disappointed.  I have to agree with a couple of reviews about the cookies tasting strongly of the shortening.  Also they were soft to begin with but after a half an hour they were getting pretty hard.  Dunking them helped.

These turned out well but I found that they cook much better & look prettier if cooked at a lower temperature. I did the first batch as directed other than added the extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter & with the 2nd batch I baked at 350 in my convection oven & the edges didn't crack & the color was consistent.

These have a good flavor. If you want a chewy moist cookies then these are not for you. They are flaky and dry. I like them but  I don’t know if I’d make them again.

Soft and rich flavor.  I didn't have shortening so I just used butter.  I increased the peanut butter to 1 ½ cups, added extra ¼ cup of flour. I had to try a couple different variations to get the cookie I was looking for. The end result was drop cookies instead of flattening them with a fork , I felt they turned out better.  I baked  @ 375 for 8 ½ minutes.

Perhaps it was because I used all butter and not half butter and half shortening, so it could be my fault. Anyhow, the cookies were really light and airy and not really the denser texture I was looking for. They did not take the fork marks well, even after putting the dough in the freezer for a bit. I had to spray Pam on the back of my fork! :)

I have made these quite a few times and I always get compliments on them.  I really am not a peanut butter cookie fan but once I made these, I am.  I will continue to make these until I can't anymore.  I love these cookies!!!!

I have made these  awesome peanut butter cookies 5 times already, and shared them with family and friends. They all loved  them. They also wanted the recipe. Ive made peanut butter cookies for as long as I can remember and this recipe is hands down the best cookies I've ever made. They are really delicious,,!

I made no changes. It made way more than 48 cookies - probably 5 1/2 dozen.  These are not soft chewy cookies but are crisp and flavorful. I had to bake them for about 11 minutes and I turned the tray at about 6 minutes to cook more evenly.

Best peanut butter cookie ever.   Just added more peanut butter.   Take out of oven at 7 or 8minutes.   When cooled they are perfect.  I also baked mine on parchment paper for an even bake

My family and I loved this recipe. I was inspired to do this recipe because my family and I love those Reese's Piece's cookies they have at Walmart in the bakery section. So I made this recipe and added the Reese's Piece's on top of these cookies. They were delicious tasted like peanut butter and butter. I would make again the only thing I would change is to cut this recipe in half because this made about 40 cookies and they were nice sized cookies too and they lasted my family about 2 1/2 weeks.

I have tried several good peanut butter cookie recipes, however THIS recipe tops them all. I will search no  more. My 10 year old daughter wrinkles up her nose in dislike when she hears that I am baking peanut butter cookies. I tried to tell her that she would love them if she would just try these, and finally succeeded in getting her to just take one bite, and I would eat the rest. She grabbed the cookie back from me for a second bite and decided that yes, this peanut butter cookie was delicious and totally edible!! LOL Score 1 for Mrs. Sigg's recipe and me. 
We love honey-roasted peanut butter, so that is what I use, but that is the only difference I make in using this recipe. 
Thank you, Mrs. Sigg and Allrecipes!

Using half shortening for the fat changes the texture-makes them softer. I roll the cookies in plain sugar before they go on the cookie sheet and get "forked." It adds a bit of extra crunch. The flavor is just what I wanted from a peanut butter cookie. Loved them!

This is my go-to recipe for peanut butter cookies. I use regular shortening because I never have the butter flavored on hand, and I cook them for about 8 to 8 1/2 minutes. I've given them to my friend who owns a bakery before, and she thought they were terrific!

Used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup lard.  Best peanut butter cookie I ever ate!  Couldn't stop eating the raw batter while the cookies baked! Just uncooked them ( the 8 minutes ) and they were soft and chewy.

Just made this for the second time.  Not a fan of butter flavored shortening so I used all butter.  I also rolled the balls in sugar before stamping them, kept the fork from sticking and gave a nice crisp finish to the outside,  Thanks, Beth!

I was looking for a good PB cookie to convert to a nut free recipe using Sunbutter and after sifting thru many, I saw one by Mrs. Siggs. I knew this would be the one to try as her Snickerdoodle recipe is delicious. I wasn't disappointed. These cookies are great as well. My only substitution was to replace the PB with natural, creamy Sunbutter. I baked them for 8 minutes on air bake pans, let them sit on the pan for 5 mins. to cool and then watched them disappear.

Bake for 8 minutes and they're soft and chewy. An excellent peanut butter flavor. I did roll them in sugar before baking and did not butter the pan. No problems with sticking on a sheet covered with aluminum foil.

Of all the peanut butter cookie recipes, this was by far the best. Though, it can be VERY time-consuming... I highly recommend this recipe! To make it even better, sprinkle some sugar on top and heat it in the microwave for a bit!

I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter per other suggestions and cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I chilled the dough for about an hour. Don't know if that made a difference as I have never made these before but have read that it may help. All in all they were great. Will make them again.

The best peanut butter cookies ever! I added chocolate chips, it's not dessert without chocolate around here. Other than that, no changes. I used my 1/4 cup ice cream dipper to make 36 perfect and generous cookies.

The flavor was great. However, I found it too easy for these cookies to get crispy. I prefer my cookies soft and chewy. I had to hover over these to make sure they didn't get over baked, which would happen quite quickly. I would rather have a recipe that is a little more forgiving. I'll keep looking.

I found this recipe several years ago on All Recipe's.  My boyfriend LOVES them (says it's his favorite cookie).  Made cookies with my daughter this past weekend, and her husband loves them, too!  Only thing I do differently is I use parchment paper.  Oh, and I do NOT use butter flavored shortening, I use the regular unflavored type.  Fake butter tastes fake!

This has been one of my favorite recipes for years. I substitute butter or margarine for the shortening, and add a bag of semi-sweet Nestle chocolate chips.

Thanks Mrs. Siggs!!!! Thanks to you, this is one of the all time recipes in my household now. My brother will come in the minute they come out of the oven, because he can smell them all the way from three stories above in his room. I tried dipping them in chocolate and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!! I can't thank you enough. They work for parties, Sunday afternoon and more. MY brother and I LOVE eating and making them. Can't say that I've ever heard a bad comment about them in THIS home!

Turned out great! I added slightly more peanut butter since I didn't want to measure it out. Cooked perfectly for about 9 minutes in my oven. Nice and soft! Just the way we like! Thank you for the recipe.

I love this cookie. I am a fan of a chewier peanut butter cookie vs. crumbly and this was perfect. The only thing I changed was that I used all butter. I also dipped my fork into flour to make the criss-cross pattern easier. I baked these on parchment paper for 9 min and they baked up so nice- picture perfect! Will be my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe from now on. Thanks!

Mrs. Sigg, you must know my Mom because these are her recipe exactly. Yes, the recipe sounds boring but they turn out perfect every time. Melt in your mouth or in the cup of milk, these are our family's favourite cookies.

This is the good old standby recipe for PB cookies. I haven't made these yet (I have saved the recipe, however), but I'd just like to say that I've been baking for fifteen+ years and my experience has been to never mix the dry ingredients into a cookie dough with a mixer. You should always fold them in with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. I've found that if you do mix the dry into the wet, it makes for a tough cookie.

Just made these and I thought they were okay. I followed the recipe except I used all butter since I did not have shortening. I also chilled the dough for an hour. I found that baking them 7.5 minutes made a cookie that was not overly crisp, and I like crisp cookies. They don't have a strong enough PB taste for me. I think the suggestions of adding another half cup of PB is a good one and I will try that next time. I'm sure every one of these cookies will be eaten.

My family loved this recipe. I increased the flour by 1/2 cup and the peanut butter by 1/3 cup. I also added PB chips because my family loves peanutbutter  (choc chips would be great too). The cookies turned out soft and were full of flavor. They were hit with all my guests!

I made these last night for work today.  Every single person said these were the best peanut butter cookies they'd ever eaten!  Success!  I did not have enough white sugar, so I did 2 cups of brown sugar and then sprinkled white sugar on top before and after baking.  Delish!

Absolutely, hands down, the best peanut butter cookies.  Bake for 8 minutes.  Remove them even if they don't look done and let cool a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing.  Chewy centers....so good!

I really liked these cookies! Added 1/2 cup of PB, as a lot of you have mentioned to do. A little trick: in order to get a perfect criss-cross shape with the fork, bake the cookies for 2-3 minutes and then take them out to do the shape. The cookies would have had the chance to cook a little and harden, leaving them looking perfect!

I just made these today and my husband thought I bought them at the store! He said they were the best peanut butter cookies I've made and don't lose this recipe. I did like other suggested and added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/2c flour. I also added peanut butter chocolate chips. This cookie did not flatten out. They were crisp at the edges and chewy in the center.  Do not over bake them.  I took them out just as the edges were starting to turn golden.

I made a half recipe with just the 1/2 cup butter and no shortening. They were really good, just what I want in a PB cookie though they did spread out a bit too much making them a little thinner than ideal for me, but I think I could solve that by refrigerating the dough for a little while before baking. Nothing to complain about in the taste, although I do think I wouldn't use any shortening even if making the full batch. I'm just not a fan of shortening in cookies, I always taste it.

These are the perfect peanut butter cookie as-is.  The taste and texture are incredible.  Works well with shortening and butter or all butter.  I find that at 9 minutes they're still a touch doughy in the very middle, so next time will cook them for 11.

These were pretty good.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions with using all butter and adding an extra half cup of peanut butter and flour each.  Baked these for 9 minutes and dipped some in chocolate after they had cooled at let them rest for 30 minutes.  Simple!

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.  Thank you for posting these:) I did not change the ingredients at all, I thought this recipe was perfect as is. Eight minutes is about right for these cookies.  They may not look done when you pull them out but will finish as they cool.

I scaled this recipe to make 24 cookies.  Classic peanut butter cookies are my husband's favorite kind of cookie.  I try and find different recipes that I think he will like.  He loves them all.  If they have peanut butter in them, he loves them.  These are no different.  They are soft, chewy, with just that little crisp around the edges when you bite into one.  Will definitely keep this one around for those peanut butter cravings.

I followed the recipe exactly and although they were good, I agree they were missing some peanut-butter flavor.  Next time I will follow the suggestions and add more peanut butter.  Still a tasty cookie tho!

This recipe is right on!  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception.  I used regular shortning in lieu of butter flavored.  Dough was somewhat sticky, so I wraped tightly in plastic wrap & put in freezer overnight.  Used a melon baller tool to scoop out.  These cookies came out delectible, melt in your mouth.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft & chewy on the inside.  I lined my sheets with parchment paper for easier cleanup.  Hubby & all  who tried loved these. Baking times for the most part are precise, although I did have to increase baking time by 1 - 2 minutes on a couple of the batches.  Great recipe!

I made this and the only change that I made was to add 1/2 cup more peanut butter. They also weren't as chewy as I had hope but none the less they were by far the best I have made so far!

These turned out exceptionally tasty!  My daughter has dairy allergies, so I had to make some slight alterations.  I substituted the butter shortening for 1/2 cup oil, egg replacer for the eggs and added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  They were yummy, as good as I could expect for having to alter them as much as I did.

These cookies are the hit of the home.  I found the tip on adding more peanut butter and adding equally more flour plus cooking them for only about 9 minutes has turned out the best.  I always make enough to take to work and EVERYONE LOVES THEM.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is always a treat for my family and friends when I make these.  A little addition I sometimes do also is add a mini peanut butter cup bought from Trader Joe's in the middle of the cookie before baking.

I loved these as well as everyone I shared them with.  I did increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and used regular shortening as that's all I had on hand.  Perfect for the rainy Sunday.  Thanks Beth.

These turned out much better the second time I made them.  They are delicious and my kids devoured them.  My mixer gave out on me the first time i made them so i didn't get them mixed very well, because of that the batter was sticky and hard to handle.  This time they mixed up perfectly and weren't sticky at all.

These are BY FAR the BEST Peanut Butter Cookie YOU WILL EVER EAT!!! The combo of Butter Flavored Crisco, and Butter, make these cookies. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and increase the Brown Sugar to 1-1/2 cups. Bake for 10 mins, get a cold class of milk, and get ready for heaven!!!

I don't like chewy cookies, so i use shortenings, instead of butter & shortening. For extra touch, i also added one teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Bake it in 160C for 20 mins. The cookies came out light, moist, and crunchy. This is definitely the perfect texture in peanut butter cookies for me! Many thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe and the "extra" half of egg caused the dough to be super wet, so I added 3/4 cups of quick oats.  This made a great peanut butter oatmeal cookie.  Super moist and yummy! Highly recommended.

By far the best Peanut Butter Cookie. This makes a nice batch -approximately 50 -  of good sized cookies!   I have been making good peanut butter cookies for many, many years but after trying these, they will become my best peanut butter cookie recipe.  I made exactly as written. Baked for 9 minutes; the cookies were still soft the 2nd day.

I love baking and this is my favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies, though when if i leave them in for 80-10 mins they tend to burn so i prefer 5 mins works best

Very good, tender cookie.  I added 1/2c more peanut butter and flour as previous reviewers had done.  I think it still needed more peanut butter though, we're peanut butter addicts over here :-)

Better than Grandma's! I made them for a meeting my dad was having with some of the players on his softball team, and there wasn't one left! The only reason I'm giving this four stars is that I added some more peanut butter, and left out the shortning, which turned out to be unecessary. Also I halved the batch and only ended up with 20.

After 4 years of looking, I finally found my perfect peanut butter cookie recipes. (I don't like soft cookies, I like crispy ones) They end up crispy, flaky and very peanuty flavored. I used the recipe exactly plus maybe 2 TB of peanut butter and and overflow of the tsp of vanilla. I even overcooked one of the batches and they were just as good.

Delicious! Again, a cookie recipe that can make soft and chewy or crispy yet moist all from the same recipe. Usually it is either/or. Worked beautifully!

This recipe makes a very large batch of delicious peanut butter cookies. I reduced the salt because I prefer them that way, but otherwise the recipe is perfect!

I just finished making these cookies and I made two small changes. I figured since I only had chunky peanut butter on hand and I would have chunks of peanuts in the batter, I would go ahead and add 3/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips. I normally won't rate a recipe if I've altered it, but I had to rate the dough that this makes. It's awesome to work with, it holds it's shape very well. I used a pastry cutter to make my criss crosses on the tops, just because I think the fork method smashes the dough too much. Yum!!!

Very good!  I accidentally used all butter instead of shortening, and they were just fine.  Perfect blend of sweet and salty.

This is the peanut butter cookie recipe I have been looking for!  They were crispy on the edges, soft in the inside.  I brought them to a family gathering, and brought home an empty container and lots of compliments!  My only tip is to chill the dough slightly, maybe 15 minutes or half hour, just for easy handling with rolling them in sugar.

Geez, I was really disappointed!  After mixing the ingredients, the dough was still very smushy.  I added 1/2 c more flour and 1/2 c more peanut butter (Jif). After 11 minutes, they were still raw. My oven is calibrated and correct and I have no problem with other baking recipes.  The flavor was great - just don't know why they were mush.

OH. MY. GOSH.
First of all, peanut butter is my weakness. I love anything peanut butter...accept peanut butter cookies. For some reason, they're just not my fav. Usually. The only way I'll eat them is with a Reese's cup in the middle. So, of course, I did that with these. But, I found myself enjoying the cookie more than the Reese's cup! IT'S AMAZING. 

First off, I didn't use shortening, I used all butter. I also didn't flatten with a fork, I just left them in balls. I cooked them for 8 minutes. As soon as I took them out of the oven I stuck a Reese's cup in the middle and pressed it down as far as it would go. Then I waited about a minute and went back and swirled the melted chocolate around to make it more smooth.

They were gone in 24 hours! And this makes a LOT of cookies. I think I counted 37. Amazing!

I am a lover of all things peanut butter! And these do not disappoint. Great peanut butter flavor, moisty, chewey, and better than anything you'd buy in a grocery store. This will for sure be my go to recipe in the future. You also might want to try Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles, those are fantastic as well.

These cookies are everything that everyone raved about, delicious!!! I did take the advice from another reader that she added chocolate chips to half the batter, excellant choice. Sooooo Gooood! And two kinds of cookies with one batter. Thankyou Mrs. Sigg

I love this recipe! I made it just as the directions said to only I added about 2 cups of Reese's peanut butter chips.  The cookies were so moist and chewy! Usually I don't care for peanut butter cookies but I made these for a bake sale and was very disappointed that we completely sold out! I will definitely be making these again and again!

I did an unofficial taste test between these cookies and Joey's Peanut Butter Cookies on this site. I followed both recipes exactly and this recipe won by far. It is now my go-to recipe. They were moist, soft, and big. Really good!

This peanut butter cookie is OK. It was tasty and baked nicely but for my taste I prefer a cookie with a lot more rich peanut butter flavor.  There was not enough peanut butter in this cookie for my liking.

I wanted to figure out which of two recipes was better (this one and Joey's Peanut Butter Cookie- both highly rated on this site) so I made them both and took them to school. While the other one was good most people seemed to prefer this one (same amount of peanut butter but more sugar). I'll keep both however as each makes a decent cookie. Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were phenomenal! I actually created an account simply to write this review, that is how amazed I was. One piece of advice, for optimal chewyness, keep cookies in for less time, they come out perfectly.

I did everything the recipe called for and added a 1/2 cup of extra peanut butter and flour as recommended. I didn't think they tasted that great, they were bland. Maybe I'll try adding even more peanut butter if I decide to make these again. I'm giving these cookies 3 stars. They weren't bad, but they weren't great either.

This recipe really fills the bill when you're craving good, old-fashioned peanut butter cookies. I used regular shortening and all-natural chunky peanut butter (that's what I had on hand). I baked them at 375 for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. The texture is just the right mix of crunchy and chewy. For best results....have all ingredients at room temperature before mixing.

I thought this was a good recipe for peanut butter cookies.  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, I use organic, so the only thing I will do different is add a little more butter.  They were a big hit a my husbands work.

There is only one word to describe these cookies...fanfreakintastic!!! These are the best I have ever eaten, made three batches this weekend alone and they just disappear. My entire family loves them, my niece requested these instead of a birthday cake. Thanks again Mrs. Sigg for another great recipe!!

I've had better cookies than these but figured I'd review them anyway.  On behalf of the recipe I did follow other reviews and made a few changes.  I halved the recipe (still made 40 cookies) and used 1/2 c of butter, 3/4 c of peanut butter and 1 1/2 c of flour.  I added mini chocolate chips to half of them.  These didn't have a strong peanut butter flavor despite adding extra pb.  I'll still be looking for my go-to recipe...

I followed the  recipe exactly and the cookies came out  really bland and not even sweet. The cookies themselves were really doughy and I kept them in the oven for an extra five minutes! When I ate one I couldn't even finish it, with no flavor whatsoever and no "crunch" at all. It tasted similar to soggy bread! The cookies didn't "spread" as they were supposed to either, they stayed on the pan like little cakes. I would have given this recipie two or three stars if the dough had tasted good, but even that was flavorless. It was hard to shape into little balls because it was rather liquidy. I won't make these again, I had to throw away all four dozen. This was a complete waste of my ingredients and valuable time. I was incredably disappointed because I made these based on all the rave reviews, I don't get it.  As I said earlier, I followed the recipie exactly!! I'm 100% positive I didn't leave anything out as I checked the list twice after coming out with the liquidy dough.

Well, according to every member of this family this is the best PB cookie we have ever had. I also added the extra 1/2 cup PB and flour but otherwise nothing was changed. My son called them addicting.

These were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made!  I did add a little more peanut butter and used real butter instead of crisco.  I also left them in 2 minutes longer so they would be a bit crunchy.  I added a hersey kiss on top of half the batch for a hint of chocolate!  These are by far the best I have ever made!

This recipe is awesome.  I have never had any luck with peanut butter cookies.  These were delicious!  The only diffence I did was I used all butter instead of butter crisco. Enjoy!

circumstances forced me to make this recipe with some significant modifications and they were still to die for. we only had whole wheat flour, only had lt brown sugar only, and only non-hydrogenated margerine (no butter or shortening). i added a touch more p.b., a pinch of molasses to make up for not having brown sugar, and sprinkled tops with lt brown sugar. fantastic! and even sort of healthy.

These are the perfect peanut butter cookies!  My whole family loved them!  They turned out to be the perfect texture.  I don't generally like peanut butter cookies, but couldn't stop eating these.  I rolled them in baker's sugar before baking.  Sooooo gooooood!

My daughter helped make these, and she was so proud because they came out of the oven looking beautiful and they tasted great.  We used 2 sticks of butter and just a little extra peanut butter.  The cookies came out nice and soft, with just enough peanut butter flavor but not too much either- just perfect!

A good PB cookie recipe.  They looked perfect and tasted good, but were a little on the crisp side while I'm a chewy cookie girl.  Other than that, this is a good recipe.

These are ok, but more like a PB sugar cookie. They didn't go over well in my house so I probably wont make these again.

I have been using this recipe for years. We use natural peanut butter. My husband who does not like peanut butter cookies can't keep his hands off of these. A big hit with the entire family. Thanks for another great one Mrs. Sigg!

This was my first attempt at peanut butter cookies and boy was I glad I read the reviews for this recipe before I tried it.  I used 2 sticks of butter, 1 1/4 cups of peanut butter and an extra cup of flour (way too watery without it).  They had great flavor and didn't get hard before the bake sale at my husband's office!  Yum!!

I doubled the recipe but used 4 1/2 cups of flour and 3 cups of peanut butter.  I've gotten rave reviews from my husband and co-workers.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were good but not outstanding. There's a cookie place where I live that is just amazing. Maybe if I'd never had their cookies, these would be a five. Not enough peanut butter for my tastes. For that many calories, I didn't feel they were worth it. Mine also didn't stay as soft for as long as I like. I even put them in the freezer for about ten minutes before baking. But a decent recipe and one I've gotten requests for. I will still look for that perfect peanut butter recipe though.

To my surprise I ended up liking a different recipe that only requires three ingredients better. I increased the pb, but I felt there wasn't enough of a peanut butter taste. They were still good to eat though.

These cookies are absolutely delicious!!  They are exactly the way I wanted them to be - soft and chewy and so full of flavour.  I changed the recipe very slightly by using only butter (instead of the butter flavoured shortening) and by adding more peanut butter because we like our cookies to be very peanut 'buttery'!  This is an excellent recipe that I will use forever!

Sooooo yummy!! I added pb chips too!! My boyfriend's a pb lover and this got his approval. He also used to work at a frozen custard place and suggested mashing a couple I under-baked (on purpose) into vanilla icecream - YUM!

As a newlywed and baking my husbands favorite cookies for the first time, you helped me win his heart! He loved them.  The only alteration I did was I added 1 cup of the butter crisco (b/c I ran out of real butter) and they still turned out wonderful. Thanks Mrs. Sigg!

Very good PB cookies! DH loved them because he likes his cookies a bit cakey. Peanut taste could have been stronger, will add another 1/2 cup next time.

Very good cookie, but I am still looking for the "ultimate" peanut butter cookie.  I used all butter and an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter based on reviews.

Fantastic! I had a peanut butter cookie recipe that I loved and always used, but I decided to try something new! I am so glad I did!! 
These are excellent cookies.  I followed other reviews and added around an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter.  I used Reese's brand.  Try these, you will love them!!!

These are FABULOUS!!!  I had to use all butter (no shortning in the house) and they were just to die for!  I was concerned after 9 minutes of baking because they looked so light - however, I pulled them out after 10 minutes (I live in the mountains and therefore my high altitude definately changes some recipes) because the recipe cautioned against overbaking.  They look lighter in color than I am used to, but taste Oh-So-Much better than I am used to, as well.  After the first batch came out, I stuck some chunks of milk chocolate on top of each cookie in the second batch; these were also yummy!  I have frozen some of the dough in little balls just so that I will have these on hand for unexpected company ... and with the best of the fishing season just starting, we get alot of 'drop in' friends.  Thanks so much, Mrs. Sigg - I'm going to make these again and again, and will watch for more of your wonderful recipes!!

This recipe is really yummy. Just make sure that you got the temperature right and not overbake it otherwise it gets too chewy inside. I lowered the amount of sugar to 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar and it still came out good. JIF creamy peanut butter will be great for it too. Thanks Mrs Sigg!

Really good PB cookies!  I halved the recipe, using all butter out of necessity.  Used half creamy PB and half crunchy PB then stirred in 3 bags of M&Ms left over from a school candy sale.  Rolled into 2" balls using about 1/4C dough, then flattened slightly with a drinking glass.  Baking the cookies for 9 minutes produced a crunchy edge and soft middle ~ yum.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe. My husband pronounced them "perfect". 
I used  unsalted butter and butter flavored Crisco, & Jiff brand creamy peanut butter.
I baked 1/2 of the cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet for 8 minutes. They were crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. The batch I baked in this manner for 9 minutes burned. :( 
The other 1/2 of the batch were baked on a baking stone and took about 8 1/2 to 9 minutes to bake and were softer without the crispy edges. 

Thank Beth! This will be my new pb cookie recipe.

Yummy - smooth, rich.  I halved the recipe, used butter and no crisco, skippy natural.  I guess I like the heartier chunkier pb cookies like the ones at whole foods - these were very good though if you like the smoother cookies.

This is my favorite recipe for Peanut Butter cookies. I have used this recipe for awhile and have never had a bad batch of cookies. You can never go wrong with these :)

Yum.This is the perfect recipe. I used 1/2c butter in place of the shortning and they are soft and chewy. I also mixed in mini chocolate chips for half the batch and they are great both ways!

These cookies were just what I was looking for in a peanut butter cookie.  They were soft and chewy and peanut buttery without being overpowering or losing their sweetness.  My mother's only complaint was that I didn't use chunky peanut butter.  But she can never have enough chunky peanut butter where I am definitely a smooth fan.  Not a bad suggestion though.  An awesome cookie!

Wow!! We used 1 cup of margarine instead of the butter and the shortening. I also added a bag of white chocolate chips and we followed the recommendation to bake for 8 minutes for soft cookies. I will definitely be making these again!! Dee-licious...

I made these for Christmas this year and everyone thought they were great.  I added extra peanut butter and salt as suggested, and instead of doing the fork imprint I pressed Hershey Kisses in the middle (when the cookies came right out of the oven) because my husband loves peanut butter kiss cookies.  He thought they were great but actually commented that it was too peanut buttery for him.  Of course this has no reflection on the orignal recipe because I added the extra peanut butter, just thought I'd mention it to anyone else...maybe add additional peanut butter to taste as you are mixing the batter??  Just a suggestion.  Good recipe though!

These were OK, nothing special. I would not take these to a party or serve them to guests.  Suitable for the kids, I guess.  My husband seemed indifferent towards them, and he loves peanut butter.  Sorry will not make these again.

Amazing and simple! The cookies are perfect, not too hard or too soft. All I did differently was add an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I will make these often.

Great, easy recipe.  I had Country Crock (TM) in the fridge, and used that instead of butter/shortening.  We also added a dollop of jelly to the top before baking.  Delicious!!

Wonderful cookies!!  Instead of using shortening, I used all butter and cooked them at 325 for about 8-9 minutes.  I've been looking for a great recipe like this one for a long time!  Thank you Beth!!

These were close -- but not quite -- to a favorite PB cookie recipe I used to make years ago (but lost the recipe). Only substitution I made was to use a cube of margerine in place of the shortening. These were generally soft, and I prefer a crisper cookie, even though I baked them for at least 12 minutes.  The flavor was great, though, and my kids and I gobbled them up. The recipe makes a lot of dough,and since we make our cookies on the small side, I decided to save myself from eating too many cookies and froze half of the dough. Will be an easy cookie making day next time.

I made these last night; they were good but didn't exactly meet my expectations. I followed the recipe as directed and didnt change the ingredients, and somehow they came out kinda greasy. If I don't find a better recipe I will try adding more flour next time.

These cookies were pretty good. I used all butter instead of half butter and half butter-flavored shortening. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies turned out soft and chewy. Rachel doesn't normally like peanut butter cookies, but she liked these! Stacy thought they were pretty good too. After I made two cookie sheets worth, I added about a cup of prepared Hershey's brownie mix to the remaining third of the dough; we ate brownie mix for dessert the night before. The third batch, with the addition of the brownie mix, was also pretty good. It wasn't really a vast improvement, just a different flavor. At least that's what Rachel said. We would make these cookies again, if we still had too much peanut butter. Sometimes, we all buy peanut butter by mistake. So we need recipes to use it in. Good cookies.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I would change is before baking, stick the dough in the freezer for about fifteen to thirty minutes, or ten before you bake, and stick it back in the freezer when you're not using it. I also made my cookies a little bigger (about the size of a golf ball), so I had to cook them longer. And I rolled the balls in sugar before pressing them with the fork tines. My family bsolutely loved the cookies!

I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had half a cup of brown sugar left, and I wish I didn't have to do that because the cookies are all gone already!!

These cookies were, by far, the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted.  They were AMAZING.  I didn't change the base recipe but (since I didn't have chocolate chips) I added a chopped up Milk Chocolate Bar which gave it the best flavor and kept it nice and chewy.  I also added Peanut Butter Chips.

I would make the recipe again in a heartbeat!!  In fact, I think I'm going to make it NOW!!

this cookie was ok. it was a little chewy but turned out a bit crispy on the outside edges. i was looking for a fatter cookie this one flattens out when baked. oh it also rolls out much easier when  the dough is refridgerated for about thirty minutes

These were pretty good. I think I used the wrong kind of peanut butter.  I bought organic and it had an odd flavor.  Next time i'll use something sweeter.

Wonderful recipe!  The cookies came out just perfect...light with a little crunch on the outside and a nice peanut butter flavor that melts in the mouth.  I really liked using the combination of the butter flavored crisco with real butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were very good however I was wanting something more chewy.  They cooked up nice and puffy but you couldn't see the fork marks because they cracked kind of like a snickerdoodle - other than that they had a very good flavor.

I have been making peanut butter cookies for years using a variety of recipes, but this beat them all hands down. My nephew made them with a little help from me and I had to tell him not to share so many with the neighbors because I wanted to have more for me :)

I should start with the fact that Beth's recipes are awesome! Most of hers have now become my standards! However, these were just not great for me. I was really excited to try them based on the other reviews, but I've never had a flatter cookie. There's just nothing to them. I followed the recipe exactly...no substitutions...nada. It was a really humid day here today, so I will definitely try again and re-rate them, but for now, this just isn't "it" for me. :-(

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  Baked them for 10 minutes in my gas oven and also added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Totally awesome! For the "stickiness" I saw none, but I used a cookie disher and they were just fine.

These are great.  I used whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup of the white sugar.  Instead of adding more flour (it needed a bit more), I added 1 cup of oats.  My family loved these, will make again and again!

Delicious!  I only made 1/2 the batch and it only made 12 cookies...unless you plan on making bite size cookies, then they will only make about 1/2 of what is stated.  Anyhow, I used all butter since I had no shortening on hand and I doubled the peanut butter and added a bit more flour.  I found that the cookies tasted much better when I added some crush roasted peanuts to the batter, better flavor and nice texture.  Will be making again, THANKS!

These cookies are fantastic! I had read the reviews about needing extra flour but I did not, maybe because I used whole wheat flour instead. They came out nice and chewy. My kids love them. This is a keeper.

Fantastic! I had the extra flour ready, but didn't need it, even on a rainy day in Oregon. After looking again at the reviews, it seems like those with children didn't need the flour and those without did. I suspect that batter sampling may be the cause. My 5 year old and I vigorously tested each step of the process and hence didn't need any extra flour. So, if you (and your helpers) do quality control testing as you mix, you probably won't need additional flour. The recipe is outstanding as it stands!!!

These were ok. My cookie dough came out too sticky to roll into balls so I had to add more flour. I thought these were OK but my husband absolutely loves them. Maybe it's just a matter of different tastes! Next time I'm going to add some peanut butter chips.

Made this cookie exactly as the recipe stated and on my first batch i found that the dough was a little sticky and once cooked they turned out sort of flat. I then added some more flour probably about 1/2 cup more and then they seemed to hold up better. So other than that though they were excellent. Nice and moist.

We loved these!  Absolutely the best.  The only change we made was to use just butter instead of butter and shortening (don't want the transfats).  Anyway, anyone who's tried them has asked for the recipe.  Outstanding!  Thank you Beth.

OH MY GOSH!  These cookies are sooooo good!  I am thrilled that I finally found a great peanut butter cookie recipe.  They are soft, but have a nice crisp edge.  Perfection. I followed the recipe and they were totally TONGUE-GASMIC!  Even the dough (c'mon we all try it) was fab.

These are a very good moist peanut butter cookie as long as you don't leave them out to cool to long .If you put a piece of bread in the container before you close it it will keep you cookies moist longer.

Pretty good!  I could find Butter flavored Crisco so I just used all butter.  But, they still came out pretty good.  My husband and kids ate them all.

Very Good Cookies!  I was hoping that they wouldn't be as dry as so many other peanut butter cookies, but they were.  Nonetheless, the were very delicious, besides.... we dunk our cookies in this house anyway, so that took care to the dryness.  4 stars to Mrs. Siggs! 

(OH! A good tip I figured out, while criss-crossing my fork on the cookies.  I found that the fork stuck to the dough, so I dunked my fork in water every third cookie and it took care of it!)

Every kid loves these cookies!  I can not keep them around.  They are very easy to make.  My 9 year old said "Mom, how did you make these, they're brilliant?".  I used all butter instead of the butter flavored shortening.

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for one that I could use with Hershey's Kisses and this worked perfectly.  I formed the dough into balls and placed in a mini muffin pan, baked 8 minutes, removed and immedidately pressed a Kiss into the cookie, returned the pan to the oven for exactly one more minute.  They were devoured by my family.  The recipe size is perfect for a Family Size bag of Kisses.  Thanks!!

These taste great but they needed more cooking time than the recipe said, they were basically raw with 10 minutes in the oven and 2 on the pan (and I have a new oven that is pretty accurate).

I made these for christmas.... I the dough into balls, then rolled them in sugar and pressed chocolate stars into the middle.  The insides of these cookies stayed SO moist, they were awesome.  I took a tin of cookies with me to work with about 30 of these in it.... by our first break there were only 3 left!  People must have been sneaking into the breakroom to eat them!  I knew the recipe was a keeper when I overheard another employee talking about how great the cookies in the breakroom were.  The peanut butter flavor in these is incredible.  Thankyou so much for sharing this recipe, I will definetely be keeping this one and using it again!

Without hesitation, I can say this is THE peanut butter cookie recipe to add to your 'keepers'.  I'll pass this one on to my daughter when she goes out on her own, it is more than worthy of being an heirloom recipe.  
I only made one change to the recipe, using all butter instead of butter & butter flavored shortening.  I was just blown away by these....the texture is PERFECT, the taste is right on the money and they are extremely easy to roll into balls.  Bravo, Mrs. Sigg!

These cookies are delicious.  I just made them and I actually goofed and they still came out well.  I misread the recipe and only put in 1/2 cup of PB.  I'll definitely use the full cup next time, but The batch was definitely not wasted.  My husband was just leaving for work as they came out of the oven and he took half of them for his co-workers.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful cookies!  Just be careful if you're using a Pampered Chef stoneware cookie sheet!  Twice as I was putting the cookies in the oven, some just slid off the cookie stone, onto the bottom of the oven (what a mess!).  But these cookies are the best pb cookies ever, better than my Mrs. Fields cookie recipe, I def. would make again :)  Thank you !

This is by far the best Peanut Butter Cookie recipe I have come across, ever.......For people who want lower fat and lower calories, I used the fat free shortening/butter replacement that is made with fruit juices and used 90% fat free peanut butter (with the oil drained off).  My son, the 10 year old critique, said this morning "These are good and that is a compliment mom".  His eyes light up after taking one (1) bite.

I have never been able to make peanut butter cookies.  They always turned out wrong. This recipe turned out perfectly.  I melted some milk chocolate chips and dipped 1/4 of the cookie in the chocolate and put them in the refridgerator to cool (just like Mrs. Fields) and they were GREAT!!!!

Made these this weekend for my honey. He loved them. The only change I made was that I made them into thumbprint cookies and added a dollop of jelly.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised at how good these cookies were.  I've used Mrs. Siggs Chocolate chip cookie recipe and had had wonderful success with it.  My Daughter's new Father-in-Law is a peanut butter cookie fanatic and said these were the best he'd ever tasted.  Thank you for another wonderful recipe Mrs. Siggs.

This was the perfect cookie recipe for my tastes, I love cookies that are soft and chewy, not crumbly or crisp.  I ALMOST followed the recipe exactly but because of previous reviews I added an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter and only about 2 1/4 cups flour instead of 2 1/2.  I added chocolate chips and these cookies disappeared so fast!  I will make them again and again!

These cookies are wonderful!!!  I substituted 1 1/4 cup of the flour with oatmeal....used 1 cup butter instead of 1/2 shortening.....and did the 1 1/2 cups of PB, as suggested.  Thank goodness I divided up the dough and froze it because I've already had about 6 cookies. They are very moist...The absolute BEST!!!

Really good peanut butter taste.  The cookie stays soft and chewy.  I did use the 1.5 cups of peanut butter.  I had to bake them for 10 minutes.  Hubby loved these.

I used 1.5 cups of crunchy peanut butter, spread the dough out into a jelly roll pan, and baked for about 15 min.  At first it seemed way underbaked but was moist and chewy and so yummy when it cooled!  I spread white frosting over the cookie and topped it with a layer of chocolate cake & covered the whole thing chocolate frosting.  That was one delicious and fun birthday cake!!!

I made the dough into good sized balls and even though it took 4 minutes longer to bake, they turned out picture perfect and wonderfully soft and tasty.  It was so much fun to watch everyone try to gobble the larger sized cookies.  This recipe is a major crowd pleaser and very easy to make.  I'm crazy about peanut butter and this is the first creamy peanut butter recipe that's completely won me over.

These are the BEST!  I don't like pb cookies, but made them for a bake sale.  They were delicious.  I made one batch plain and one with chocolate chips.  I must say, the chocolate chip ones tasted just like a peanut butter cup when they are warm out of the oven.  The cookie itself, warm and peanut buttery, and the chips give just enough chocolate to make it divine.  I will definetly put this one in my EXCLUSIVE recipe journal!

These cookies are deserving of 5 stars!  Very delicious and creamy instead of a "cakey" cookie which is what we like.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception I used 1 1/2 cups peanut butter -- so good!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  This one is a keeper.

This was a great recipe - one suggestion though, add semi-sweet Nestle chocolate chips to jazz this recipe up! We had a taste test and the chocolaty ones were the winner.

INCREDIBLE! Sigworth's recipes are awesome! These cookies are incredibly tasty but not too strong, easy to make, and will definitely make anyone who tastes them say "mmmmmmmmmmm."

Very good cookie.  I did not give it the full 5 stars as my husband and I prefer a chewier cookie.  Will try taking them out of the oven a minute or two earlier next time (we are at a higher altitude, so maybe this is an issue).

These cookies were really good.  They remind me of my grandmother's peanut butter cookies.  I used 1 cup of Butter Flavored Crisco instead of 1/2 c. butter - 1/2 c. Crisco.  I always have better results using the shortening instead of butter.  I will use this recipe again.
