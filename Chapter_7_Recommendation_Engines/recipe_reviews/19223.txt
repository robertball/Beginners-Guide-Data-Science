Oh my word!! These are soooooo good!!! I made them last year and will make them again this year. Just be sure to use a nice Port and not a cheap brand, as the cheap ones tend to have a sour bitterness to them. These are good shippers too, which is important to me as my family lives 3000 miles away. I suggest, however, that you wrap each square in plastic wrap or waxed paper before shipping, as they are so moist they may crumble in transit.

Try this recipe!  My mom makes these every year, but I lost my copy and couldn't reach her to get the recipe.  I am so glad your recipe was here because I made some and I'm taking them to my son's place for Christmas eve.  I recommend using an inexpensive tawny port wine because I think it is more mellow and more black-cherry-like than the plain port wine.  Try to chop the walnuts really fine or buy the finely diced walnuts to save time.  This is my favorite Christmas cookie of all.  Not chewy to me... more like a moist piece of cake. They should be cut in small pieces because they are rich.  Great recipe.  Thanks for providing it here.

I substituted pecans for walnuts due to a family distaste for walnuts. My husband said this was his favorite dessert thing I have ever made! I definitely recommend the red food coloring. Otherwise, the glaze is somewhat unappetizing in color.

I substituted a mix of cranberry and lemon juice for the port. 

The batter baked for 25 minutes before setting (pulling away from the edges of the pan and a toothpick comes out clean). 

The end product was much softer and cake-like than expected; I was expecting something less crumbly and closer to a brownie consistency. The squares were delicious, but tasted like nothing more than brown sugar, butter, and walnuts.

I won't be saving this recipe =C

I was planning to serve these with port after an Iberian wine tasting we are hosting. Iâ€™m glad I did a trial run before hand. These were impossible to serve as bars since they just crumbled into pieces when I tried to cut them. I took the crumbles and filled mini muffin cups and froze them. Popped them out and put them into a freezer bag. I also scraped off as much of the frosting as I could as it was an unappetizing Pepto Bismol color. I will serve them in custard cups with a warm caramel sauce and hope for the best.

I followed the recipe to a T and I think there is something wrong with it.  The flavor was there but the texture was a disaster.  The "bars" just fell apart even after setting up for a day.  Maybe there should be 3/4 C flour instead of 3/8, or two eggs?  It needs more binding.
