This is an easy and elegant recipe.  I added blueberries to mine and a friend said "On a scale of one to ten this rates a twelve!"  I didn't have trouble with the peaches discoloring but I covered mine with plastic wrap almost immediately.

Add top layer of peaches at the last minute or they will discolor
