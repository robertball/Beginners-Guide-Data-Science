I will certainly make this dish again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will make one modification - the pork should come out when the internal temperature is closer to 145 - 150.  If let rest, it will still rise to nearly 160.  Leaving it to 160 as the recipe described dried out the meat more than I typically prefer.  Searching through USDA requirements 145 is sufficient for a pork roast to be medium cooked (as opposed to 160 - well done).  

As a side note, I served this with grilled pinapple instead of the traditional apples/applesauce and it was a huge hit.

This recipe is fantastic!  I place the spices and garlic in a bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil and mix well, then cover the top of the roast with this mixture.  It couldn't be any easier, and is soo yummy.

My husband works at a country club in metro Atlanta.  He said that he thought the chef at the country club made the best pork roast, but said that this recipe beat it hands down!  Easy, Quick, and makes you look like a pro!

This roast was quite good and very easy to prepare.  Even my picky two year old ate it, but I had to tell him it was chicken.  I rubbed the roast with olive oil to help the herbs and garlic stick to it.  This one's a keeper!

Loved this! - made it twice so far with boneless rib roast.  Incredibly quck to prepare (great news as a busy mom!) and even my meat-hating 3-yr old eats it with minimum fuss!
I did a 2lb roast last night, so turned the oven temperature down a little and let the probe determine when the meat was done.
Like another reviewer, I combined the herbs in some olive oil before rubbing them into the meat, and also added some Stones Ginger Wine to cover the bottom of the pan - what was left at the end of cooking time made a nice glaze to pour over the meat when I served it.

I assumed that I would give this 4 stars.  After seeing how easy it was to make and how juicy it was, I changed my mind to 5 stars!   I used a bone-in roast and it will still perfect!  The seasonings are perfect.

Very good flavor and easy! I just roasted some potatoes with it and made a green salad on the side. I even didn't have sage (oops...thought I did), though I had poultry seasoning that has it in there so I used that in its place and it tasted just fine.

I had my doubts, but wanted something for company on the 4th.  Everyone loved it! My husband said that it was the best I have ever made. Guess that makes it my new "go to" recipe for pork!
The only change I made was using powdered garlic instead of fresh, so it would mix with the other spices in the rub.
P.S.  Always roast your pork 'face down', (gravity) and dont trim off that small layer of fat on the bottom, thats what keeps it moist.

This recipe was sooo yummy!  It needs 6 stars!  Between my husband and my father-in-law dinner time sounded like this, "hhhmmmm, yummmm, mmmmm, this is sooo good!"  Very easy, very simple, very good!  I served this with rolls and glazed carrots.

Made this tonight, with red potatoes and ginger honey carrots(from the site). So lucious and moist! I LOVED it, as did the kids... the husband not so much, but that is b/c he actually likes dry pork!! So in this case his opinion isn't important. This was juicy, tasty, and had a great flavor.

The whole family loved this! I lined a 9 x 13 pan with heavy-duty foil, leaving plenty of foil extending over the edges to wrap-up around the roast. Then I placed the roast on the foil, and pour on plenty of olive oil. Topped with the sage, marjoram and salt. Tossed in some quartered red potatoes, onion and garlic cloves. Rubbed the oil and herbs over all and wrapped it up tight. Baked at 350 for about an hour until it reached 160. I made gravy out of the drippings, with lots of whole milk, and salt. Delicious!

Awesome!  Well I had no sage so I used part thyme and part rosemary with great results.  I added a bit of olive oil to make it stick better.  Took way longer to cook though and I only had 1.5 lbs.  Could be my oven though.  Anyways, def a keeper!

Made this yesterday in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours, then down to keep warm until dinner. I tossed quartered red potatoes, onions and carrots in the slow cooker and plopped the roast on top. I did cut the roast in two pieces for quicker cooking.  I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was moist with a wonderful flavor.  This is my go to recipe now for roast pork.

Made this tonight. I had marjoram but no sage, so I used 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning instead, and subbed 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder since we didn't have fresh. My fiance took one bite and told me if he didn't know anything else about me he'd marry me for the roast alone! I've been crazy about my mom's pork roast my whole life, but it has been usurped!

Pork Roast was great. I would probably get a little more generous with the salt, but other than that, the spices were perfect. I also took the pork out once it hit 140 degrees and let it rest until it reached 160.

Made this with a 2.5 lb. loin, kept mixture same amounts (poultry seasoning instead of marjoram, and adding 2 T EVOO). Very tasty, cooked in less than an hour! I know, not a true rating since changed, but wanted to put the info. out there in case it can be of any help to others!

Everyone loved this roast!  I also added the herbs with olive oil then did the rub.  Covered it with foil and baked for 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees.   It was juicy and fork tender.  This is going into my regular line-up.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I served it to guests and they all loved it.  I mixed the spices in olive oil like suggested, put wine in the bottom of the pan.  I made a sauce with the drippings, added little honey, ginger, brown sugar, soy sauce, molasses, and katsup.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and honey ginger carrots both recipes found on this site.  It was a huge hit!

Whole family loved this.  Used Canola oil (didn't have Olive Oil on hand) to hold the rub together better but yum!  Have used this on beef roast and chicken too with just as tasty results.

This recipe rocks!   I am a busy dad that tkes turns cooking to help out, and this one is easy, and very, very tsty.  I took one of the commenters advise and mixed the spices into about 2 tbsp of olive oil.  Other than that - just get ready for a mouth watering roast!!

I always follow the suggestions on a recipe which is why I love this site so much but this recipe didn't have any major changes to it.. It says alot about a recipe when it's 5 stars and no one really changed anything. This was FANTASTIC!!!! I over ate b/c it tasted so good! I made my roast on a rotisserie so I did add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil just to help the seasonings stick to the roast and I didn't know what "rubbed" sage was so an online search told me to use 3/4 teaspoon of ground sage in place of it. I'll try rubbed sage next time now that I know what it is but even the way it was.. it was Amazing! Thanks!!!

Like most other reviewers, I changed this up a bit.  I added not quite 2 tablespoons of EVOO to the dried spices and rubbed onto the meat this morning.  My roast was about 2.25 lbs and I used the whole amount of spice.  Cooking time was WAY off.  I used a digital thermometer and set it to 150 (what I cook this roast to).  It took 2 hrs to hit 150 and after standing for 15 minutes, it hit 160.  The flavor near the surface of the meat is exceptional, but that is it.  Next time I will make 2 times the spice rub mix and mix half with EVOO and inject into the meat then use the rest as a rub on the outside.   Would be great on a pork tenderloin (just only cook to 145).

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe was so easy, it was in the oven in less then 5 minutes!  I added 3 teaspoons of olive oil to the spices and coated the roast.  I had a 1.5 pound roast and I still used the same amount of spices from the original recipe.  It still had to cook for over an hour, even though it was a smaller size, but it was moist and juicy.  I put some large slices of onion in the pan and they were tasty too!  Highly recommended recipe.

This as a simple delicious recipe. I discovered the meat was still frozen yesterday when I turned it over to put the rub on, so I finished putting this rub on and then put it back in the fridge for tonight's dinner instead. So all my husband had to do was to take this from the fridge and put it in the oven and Voila! a couple of hours later, we had a wonderful dinner. I even used powdered garlic. Excellent easy recipe! Thanks for sharing this Edie.

This tasty and tender loin roast received rave reviews  from my family when I made it last month.  I was in a rush this week, so I just threw another pork loin in the slow cooker with the same seasonings and a few veggies - big mistake!  It was dry and barely edible. Even the veggies I added weren't nearly as good as the ones I roasted in the oven last time.  Don't cut corners... use the oven and a meat thermometer for a perfectly cooked roast.

Good flavor. I did as some other reviewers did and mixed the spices with some olive oil to make it more of a "paste." I would take it out of the oven at 155 degrees next time, as the temperature will continue to rise a bit. We made it with herbed roasted sweet potatoes and it was delicious.

Simple, but delicious.  Had to cook an extra 20 minutes to get the pork to a high enough internal temp. Followed the advice of others and drizzled the roast with olive oil to help the rub stick. Added some ground pepper to the spice mix, as well. Cooked the roast with medium sized chunks of potatoes (tossed with olive oil and sea salt). The roast and the potatoes were done at the same time and both had fabulous flavors.

One word... WOW! This was truly great! My roast was 1.74 lb & I used the full amount of herbs/seasoning given in the recipe for the 4lb roast & boy I'm glad I did! I also mixed the seasoning with olive oil then coated the roast... It was better than I expected! (barely made it to the table, haha!) I made mine with garlic green beans and oven roasted carrots with honey. A great meal!

This seemed so simple that I was a little sceptical that it would stay moist.  But it did - it was absolutely perfect.  The only change I made was to use fresh herbs because I have them in my garden.  (They were dried after a few minutes in the oven.)  I would recommend this to anyone but especially to beginning cooks - you'll get lots of compliments for this.  I served it with a pale brown gravy, applesauce and mashed potato.  Yummy!

Delish! I used a 2lb loin, kept the seasoning amounts the same, and added 2 tbsp olive oil and a 1/2 tsp of cracked pepper. Like many, I used a probe thermometer and took the pork out when it reached 145. It rose to a bit over 160 while it rested and was still very juicy. Next time I will definitely serve this with gravy. Yum!

This is fabulous as is......juicy with awesome flavor. The last time I made it, I added 1 tsp onion powder, simply because we are nuts for onion. It wasn't any better.....I mainly did it to satisfy my husband's onion cravings, but it was good. Thanks so much for sharing, Edie.

Made this recipe for a family dinner - everyone raved about how delicious it was.  The only thing for me was that one hour twenty minutes only got the roast to 140 degrees internal temp.  It ended up taking an additional 20 minutes to get it to the 160 degrees.

very good pork roast.  I never made one before, but after trying this recipe, I will definitely be doing it again.  I followed someone elses advice, and chopped up some garlic and added it in with some olive oil.  Very good.

This was quite good, and it smelled wonderful while it was in the oven. The pork came out juicy and tender.

I didn't have any marjoram, so I used ground thyme instead. It was moist, tender and very delicious. I have to try it with the marjoram next time.

I've been afraid of roasts because if you blow it, that's alot of $$$ wasted but this!!!  I now buy a long pork loin roast, cut it into 3 or 4 smaller sizes and use this recipe.  It's not just the flavor, it's the tenderness!  I, too, remove it from the oven when the internal temp is 145 degrees.  Truly fork tender, no knives needed!!!

SOOO TASTY! It was tender, juicy & so flavorful, but I think that was due to the fact that I also sprinkled dried rosemary & thyme & a little garlic salt on it too! I drizzled a little olive oil on first before I rubbed the seasonings in. It was heavenly! My son ate thirds!

This recipe was perfect. I opted for just over a pound of roast and it took about  1  1/2  hours. Great flavorful roast, it was juicy and went great with sweet potatoes.

I usually leave the meat cooking up to my hubby but I decided to give this one a try.  I have to say it was simply amazing.  Even my son said it was the best he had ever had.  I took others suggestions and used evo to help mix up the spices, other than that I didn't change anything.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

So easy and delicious. Added a bit of olive oil to make it an easy rub all over the meat. I had a 2.3 pound roast and put it in the over for 1 hour. Meat thermometer was still low, so I left it in another 20 minutes. By then, the roast temp said almost 170 and I thought it would be overdone. But I let it sit about 30 minutes and it was outstanding (we do like it on the well-done side, though not dry and tough)! I've had trouble with pork roasts before, but I've finally found a winner.

AWESOME!!!  Made recipe as is, the only thing I might change would be to let it marinate in the fridge a little before roasting.   I also did take others advice and used a little oil on the roast to make the spices stick.

Thawed a 5lb bone-in roast and decided on this recipe.  Mixed the seasonings with 2T olive oil and rubbed it onto the roast.  Let it sit on the counter for an hour or so to marinate and bring the temp up a bit, then roasted.  Added some baby carrots and quartered red potatoes to the bottom of the pan.  Came out really good!

This roast turned out tender and flavorful. I cooked with a lid on and did some substitutions for sage(as I had none) and I also used a variation on the balsamic roasted red potatoes recipe by Bev Bosveld w/ some carrots to fill the space around the roast. The two recipes went together perfectly and were great as leftovers.

I know alot of people have said that reducing the temp made this dish more juicy but I did it to the full 160 and it was amazingly moist and juicy. I am not used to cooking with fresh garlic so I thought that the whole head of garlic was a clove.... but after it cooked it still was not over powering.. it was amazingly delicious and pleased everyone. I would recommend this to everyone.

This was a great roast pork. I used the tip of using olive oil and putting all the seasonings in the oil, then smearing on top and sides. I used a digital thermometer and took it out at 145. It was perfect after sitting for 5-10 minutes

This was a great recipe and reminded me of my grandmothers pork roast.  I cooked this in the crockpot for 6-8 hours on low.  I also added about 1/2 bottle of Guiness to the crockpot.  I used a pork shoulder, which imparted more flavor, and more meat juices.  This allowed me to make a great gravy with cornstarch that went so well with my sauerkraut and potato dumplings.

Made this pork roast for a potluck at work.  It was delicious!  I used a slightly smaller roast (3.3 lbs) and cooked for an hour and 5 minutes.  It was juicy, fully cooked and tender.  I added potatoes and carrots but cooking them the whole hour was too much.  I really do suggest throwing some veggies in at the 30 minute mark so soak up some of the delicious juices.

This is excellent. I did not have Sage so I added poultry seasioning and it still is so good. I also put more garlic into the roast as we love the taste of garlic. I will use this recipe always now. It is great and my family loves it. Melts in your mouth and the taste is excellent.

This roast is superb! Not only is it easy but very moist and flavorful.I forgot to put it on a rack but it didn't matter. I did not have the Marjoram, so I substituted poultry seasoning as another reviewer had suggested. I also sprayed the roast lightly with olive oil to help the spice rub stick a little better.

Awesome!  This recipe was amazing!  My husband took a piece while he was cutting it and exclaimed...YUM!!!  The only thing that I would take note of is that it takes alot longer to cook.  My roast was not quite 4 lbs, and it ended up taking 3 hours (at that temp) to bring it up to an internal temp of 145 degrees.  I did let it rest, it came up to 160 degrees, but  I will def put this on in the middle of the afternoon next time.  We ended up eating later than we normally do.  It was worth the wait though!  I served it with cresent rolls and roasted red potatoes.  I will definately serve this again!!!  :)

I just made this tonight with a 2lb pork roast. I didn't have any sage but took another reviewers suggestion and used poultry seasoning. I placed all the spices in a bowl and added some olive oil (as another reviewer suggested too) and it kind of made a pesto sauce that I put on top of the roast. I also added some water in the bottom of the roasting pan.  I thought this had excellent flavor and also tasted very yummy with a side of applesauce.  Will definitely make this again!!!  Thank you Edie!!!!

Delicious! Used a 1 1/2 lbs. organic pork loin roast so I cut the spices in half but used 2 large cloves of garlic., minced  I roasted for 50 min. at 350.  It was very juicy and the seasonings were a flavorful blend with the pork. Definitely a keeper and very easy to do!

I made a smaller roast than  the recipe call for but it was still raw when I took it out.  My brand new thermometer read 170 degrees but the juices were still pink... The seasoning was also awful.  I'll stick with my crock pot pork roast. Tender and flavorful.

Made this tonight, followed the 2 tbsp olive oil rule and mixed all the ingredients together.  Cooked for 1 hour 50 minutes simply because at 20 it was pink.  Paired with boulangere potatoes and a pinot = amazing.  Was told it was outstanding by my guests!  Used a 3.32 pound roast as well for reference.

I couldn't believe that a recipe this simple was this good! I followed the advice of others and used olive oil to make a paste, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Unfortunately, my dinner guests were late and it was slightly overcooked, but it remained juicy and moist.

Hands down this is my family's favorite way to have pork loin.  I've made it many times with great results.  Perfect just as written, no tweaking required.

My roast turned out extremely juicy, which made me very happy. The flavor of the rub didn't excite me too much, though. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The only other thing I would say is to take that roast out at about 150° and then rest it. I took mine out at 150° and it was SO juicy.  Longer than that and it will probably be dry. These are the reasons I only gave 3 stars.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I needed something quick and easy for surprise dinner guests.  Smelled wonderful baking, and I definitely only cooked it to 145 like one of the first reviews said.  It was moist, juicy, and flavorful!  Served with a potato dish and a nice green salad.  People loved it!

Pork roasts have always been my great failure in cooking.  It's either beyond dry or tasteless; in a word HORRID. I tried this technique and recipe tonight and it was sensational! I can't say pork roast will be on our table once a week (I think my family is still a little scared LOL) but it will be more frequent than once every blue moon!

Made this last night for dinner. Husband liked it, although he is not a pork lover. The flavor was very good, and it was easy to make. I made a few small changes. Added olive oil to rub to make it stick and help roast to brown. I also made a few slits in top or roast and added garlic and some of the rub to them. Roast took about 2 hours to reach a temp of 150, but I had a 5 lb. one, so that was to be expected. Let it rest for about 10 minutes, and it was done perfectly. Roast was still on the dry side, but this seems to be the nature of pork. I will make this roast again.

This was delicious!  The only change I made although it may have been signifcant was that I put a tblsn of garlic oil in the mix and made a paste.  Rubbed it all over and I let it marinade for a few hours.   The whole family loved it.

From the reviews, it sounds like a 5 star and from my experience from this site, and my cooking experience this is a great one.  I have not made this, however, this year I have to make two Thanksgiving dinner, on Thursday, it will be the traditional dinner and on Friday, it will be this pork roast with homemade applesauce, fresh green beans and rolls.  Thank you for a great pork roast recipe!

Just tried this for dinner today....YUM!  I decided to cook is slow overnight in the crock pot.  I also used the oil with the seasonings.  My family raved about how good this was and my husband is already planning for the next time he has friends over.

Was hoping this would be 5 stars, but it didn't work well for us.   Followed recipe exactly as written.  It was okay, but certainly not great.  Flavor was bland.  Improved over next day or two but still not going to be making it again.

This was amazing!  Super easy for a busy single mom and BOTH my kids loved it!  That never happens so finding something they will both eat is wonderful.  My son is not big on meat and he asked for seconds... and thirds!  I followed the suggestions of coating the roast with oil and used garlic grapeseed oil.  YUM!  Had to add that I have made this multiple times over the past few years and it continues to be a favorite!  I serve it with rice and a veggie; it also makes great leftovers!

This roast was easy to fix and turned out moist and delicious.  I did follow another's suggestion and added the spices and garlic to olive oil, then slathered the mixture over the roast.  I will definitely serve again.

Very good.  I used a 2 1/2 Lb. roast & the only thing I changed was adding 2 garlic cloves & the timing. This most likely would have been much better if my Jenn-Air oven didn't leak heat, it took about 2 hours until it wasn't bloody in the middle.  I sure would like to replace that Jenn-Air.

What a delicious way to make a pork roast.  I don't often use sage or marjoram - the combination with garlic was very tasty.  Tasted great right out of the oven and again the next day right out of the fridge.  Thanks for posting.

Cooked this for my mom for her birthday.  First time ever cooking for her and this was a big hit.  My 8-year-old niece said it was the best "chicken" she had ever had.  My only change was using rosemary infused olive oil and black pepper in the rub.

Fast, simple, very flavorful. Added a bit more than double the listed amount of garlic (something I do to everything this side of dessert) and lightly scored the meat's surface. Ran internal temp up to 140 and the roast was as moist as any . . . succulent, actually. This one goes into the permanent file & thanks for sharing!

I guess I don't really use the "recipe" just the cooking directions.  I have found it easier and tastier just to rub Montreal Steak Seasoning all over it and bake the meat, fat side down.  This has become a staple in my kitchen.

I rubbed the roast with some olive oil before applying the seasonings.  I used extra seasoning; I made a half recipe and only had a 1lb 6oz roast.  I would definitely make this again.

This is the only roast pork recipe you will ever need!  It is well loved by everyone, thank you for posting! Comes out perfectly everytime and is a juicy, tender roast.  I make this often because it has become hubbys favorite...The only thing I do different is mix the garlic and seasonings with a little extra virgin olive oil to make a paste to spread on.

Very good.  And I am tough critic.  I had already prepared the seasoning w 2 T Olive Oil and told my husband to put in the oven.  He added a little water, a bay leaf, some more salt, some Lawhon's dry seasoning.  Had to put it back in the oven for a few more minutes after slicing a few pieces. A little too much pink for me when it came to pork.
