I followed this recipe exactly...and it turned out great.  Hubby and I loved this and used this for a great side dish to our dinner.  I loved the idea of noodles and lettuce together...Made a great dish.  Thanks for the recipe...it was great.

Absolutely great.  This is a full meal.  I added sweet red pepper, cubed jack cheese, olive and quartered boiled eggs and it was fantastic. I will definitely make this for company.  You'll get raves - I promise.

While the tortellini stay kind of bland, a little pepper fixes that.  This is a really delicious salad, that I will pass on at lunch tomorrow!!!!!

We loved this!  I had never had tortellini on salad before.  This is also good with any type of salad dressing that you like.

So good. I didn't measure the dressing, I just added enough until it looked like enough. I also added cheddar and monterey jack crumbles as someone suggested. The only thing I may do next time is cut each tortellini in half before tossing with the salad. Otherwise, a keeper!

This was surprisingly good.  I thought the flavors wouldn't mesh, but it was good.  A nice change from boring lettuce and tomato salad that I usually have.

Excellent!  Didn't use the tomatoes, and added chicken from other reviewer's suggestions.  Used Newman's Own creamy classic caesar dressing.  Will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy and my husband couldn't stop commenting on how good it was.  Like another person suggested I added chicken to give it a little more substance.  I also tried it with both Caesar and Ranch dressing and both were wonderful.  This will become a regular for us.

I took this salad to a school function and everyone loved it! Definitely use a high quality dressing. I also added the dressing and fresh ground pepper to the tortellini while warm and then chilled for an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients. This is easy and a keeper!

This is spectacularly delish!

I brought it to a potluck this week and it was GONE!  

And I made enough for 30 people.  

I can be lazy, so I bought a dressing in the produce section called "Royal Caesar", very garlicky but once its on the tortllinis, its perfect!

I registered just to give props for this!

Based on other reviews, I marinated the tortellini ahead of time in a ceasar vinegarette.  I also used a creamy garlic ceasar dressing and omitted the tomatoes, everyone seemed to love this salad!

This was yummy, but not very gourmet, if you will.  Quite filling.  Serve right before eating so that the dressing does not make everything soggy.

I liked the concept of this salad, once I modified it slightly.  After cooking the noodles I mixed them with the dressing and let it blend over night then added the tomatoes, cheese, and some chopped zucchini.  Instead of mixing it with the greens I rested them on a bed of the lettuce also adding quartered hard boiled eggs and the croutons.  Delicious.

Such a great way to mix up a Caesar salad.  I loved that it was so simple to throw together and it really would be okay as a stand alone meal.  FYI - dried tortellini works just as well as the refrigerated kind.  Also, make your own croutons (garlic crouton recipe can be found on this site and is fantastic) and the salad is even better.

My wife really liked this and said she would give it a 5.  I thought it was way too light to make a meal of, and it could use some seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  I would give it a 3.  So, since I'm the one doing the review, I'm gonna give it a 3.

This was pretty good. I enjoyed having the tortellini with it. The salad dressing was somewhat overpowering, so I will probably add less next time. Overall, I enjoyed this recipe!

Superb! I added olives and chopped red pepper as well. This was a hit at a Labor Day potluck! Was asked for the recipe. This salad eats like a meal, very satisfiying.

I made this for dinner tonight to accompany my chicken and it was the star of the show. I loved this recipe and so did my family. It's pretty filling too. This would go really nice with a hearty soup and some bread. I found another keeper!!

A fabulously delicious salad!  I chopped my own romaine lettuce since it's less expensive than buying the packaged lettuce and I used onion/garlic croutons instead of the Caesar-style croutons.  I will definitely make this one again and again.  I took it to a potluck and it was a big hit.

This recipe is great.  I brought it to a picnic and it was the only thing that disappeared.  I would suggest it to anyone who likes caesar salad.  The pasta adds some substance to the salad.
