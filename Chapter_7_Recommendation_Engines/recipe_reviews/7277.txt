You CAN make flowers!  I use this frosting recipe (slightly altered) on all my personal and retail cakes now.  Not too sweet, light and fluffy and holds color and flavor well.  To make flowers, etc, put the frosting in the fridge (best in a stainless steel bowl) for about 20 minutes, then beat on medium for about 15 seconds - viola!  However, if you have warm hands like me, you need to be able to work a little fast.  Once finished, refridgerate cake until an hour before serving.  Unless drastic temperature change, colors won't bleed and decorations retain shape.  HINT: add just a tad bit more flour to the cream mixture.

This recipe has unreached potential. Spreading consistency was nice. However, the flour was noticeable in my first sample taste of the frosting. Also, I didn't use the butter extract because I don't like artificial ingredients. However, the large amount of real 
butter was overwhelmed by the shortening. I'm going to try the recipe again but with only 3 tablespoons flour and with butter in place of some of the shortening. Also, I doubled the amount of vanilla. I would also add at least 1/2 cup more powdered sugar. The recipe is a great starting place, just needs a little refinement.

This was very close to what I was looking for. My friend is a professional baker and award winning designer. She has a "top secret" French Butter Cream frosting she uses and I have been trying to find something close. I think this is as close as I am going to get!

I used regular butter (I did not have unsalted on hand) and butter flavored Crisco. There was enough to frost a 2 layer 8" round. It was smooth and creamy. 

It was not stiff enough to decorate with, unless whatever was not in the bag was put in the fridge. It was way too soft for flowers. I combined it with a regular shortening based buttercream for decorating. (I chose a basketweave on the sides and roses on top.)

Thanks so much for a great recipe! 

P.S. It is wonderful on carrot cake. :)

This frosting is so light and fluffy, you might think it was made by angels! Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I used butten instead of shortening and reduced the flour to 2 Tablespoons. The result was heavenly! I wouldn't hesitate to make this again and again and again!

Sorry Kristen, we didn't like this at all.  We actually ended up throwing it away and making a batch from a different recipe.  Not sweet enough, not enough flavor, flour mixture was funky, too heavy on the butter & shortening.  Don't waste your time and ingredients on this one.

My husband's family doesn't like traditional sweet buttercream frosting, but I didn't want to deal with whipped cream for a variety of reasons, so I was looking for a buttercream recipe that tastes more like whipped cream.  I made this recipe with the whisk attachment on my Kitchenaid, and it came out much creamier and smoother than regular buttercream.. great consistency.  However, I would NOT say it isn't as sweet.  I did use a little extra powdered sugar since some reviewers said to add more, and I think it was overkill.  Icing the cake was very easy, especially for perfectionists like me who are never satisfied with the way it looks.  It didn't crust over and I could re-smooth it over and over.  I frosted the cake 2 days before my son's birthday party and put it in the fridge, took it out for a couple of hours the day before to decorate it (with regular buttercream), and then took it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before serving.  The frosting tasted the same as it did the day I made it.  I will definitely use this recipe again, with a little less sugar and maybe a touch more vanilla. I changed the servings to 18 to make sure I had enough to frost a 2-layer 9x13 cake, and I had about 1 cup left over. Great recipe - thank you!!

I really wasn't happy with this frosting. I assume the flour is added to give structure in light of there not being enough sugar for the large amount of butter/shortening. The lack of sugar, butter/shortening overload, and funky flour texture/taste, combined with the half cup of cream, makes this super soft, very greasy, and not nearly sweet enough (I have zero sweet tooth, so if I'm saying it's not sweet enough, there's a problem). And not to be nitpicky, but French buttercream is made by beating a sugar syrup into egg yolks, then adding softened butter. This isn't it.

I have used this recipe dozens of times and LOVE it!  Everyone I serve this to is impressed by the texture and taste. I like a more whipped cream flavor so I always make the following changes: #1 - Omit the butter flavor extract and increase the vanilla to 2 tsp. #2 - I also add 1/8 more whipped cream to recipe to boost cream whipped cream flavor. Some popular variations I've done: Add seedless strawberry jam for an awesome cake filling or reduce shortening to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup cream cheese (MUST be room temp) to give more stability for many layers. To better transport the finished product I'll refrigerate or freeze prior to moving it.

Wonderful Recipe.  Used the suggestion for butter shortening and the buttercream was a hit.  Used this recipe to fill, ice, and decorate sister's wedding cake.  I had several professional bakers at the wedding compliment me on the buttercream.
Thanks!

This is an amazing icing.  It does the trick everytime, for every birthday cake and it tastes wonderful.  The only advice I'd have is to put the milk/flour in the microwave in increments of 10 or 15 seconds and mix in between or else you end up with a chunk of flour goo.  Otherwise, it's amazing.

I reduced the flour to 2 tbs instead of 4 tbs and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp and it came out perfect. Make sure you beat the mixture for the specified amount of time to ensure the frosting fluffs up. If you don't have an electric mixer of some sort I don't recommend making this frosting.  There was more than enough frosting for a two layer cake (and I'm pretty liberal with my frosting spatula!) so I whipped the remaining 1/2 cup whipping cream into the mixture and it'll be perfect for a fruit dip or angel cake frosting.

This is a pretty good tasting frosting. It is not too difficult to make. It is a very light fluffy, almost whip cream, type of frosting. It is not the best that I've ever had, but it is better than the premade Betty Crocker icings and the Wilton recipe icings.

We made this frosting and it tasted great!  It was hard to work with once it sat overnight.  Next time we try this we will frost our cake right away.

This is a very light fluffy frosting. Also turned out very runny, where I had to add lots of icing sugar to make it a bit more stiff. Good for basic filling and covering cake, but not good for decorations :(. Didn't add butter extract, and was buttery enough as is. If the flour/cream mixture comes out doughy, just add milk or cream a bit at a time mixing well until creamy frosting consistency. Not a bad frosting, tasted great, just not so good on consistency. To avoid floury taste, make sure you "cook" the cream/flour mixture in the microwave. In other words, make sure it's in the microwave long enough to simmer a little. Thanks!

I love how smooth this frosting is and it's not too sweet.  Used this on a sour cream white almond cake with raspberry filling.  Happy with the results.

I used this frosting to decorate and frost a wedding cake. It was absolutely wonderful.  Everyone raved about the cake.  I liked the fact that it is not real sweet.  Will definitely use again.

The end result was very good on my chocolate cake.  However, I cut the amount of shortening in half & would use even less next time. I ended up tripling the amount of sugar to mask the crisco taste.

I have never received so many compliments on a cake!  Everyone was just amazed at how light it was.  Not too sweet!  Absolutely perfect!!  I used it as the base icing and borders on my daughters first birthday cake.  Even with the regular decorating buttercream (which is quite heavy) on top of it you could still taste the cake!! I was a bit worried because it was an VERY humid day and I was afraid with the cream it would seperate or melt, but it didn't at all!!  Winning recipe that I will use from now on!

Lighter than what I normally think of when I think of buttercream, but that's exactly what I was looking for in this case. I used this on a wedding cake and got rave reviews. Great for those looking for a less sweet, lighter buttercream!

This butter cream tastes amazing.  I did, however, make some slight changes to the recipe.  I use half and half instead of heavy cream and cook it on the stove.  I tried in the microwave but I found that it was sometimes lumpy.  I use all butter and no shortening (we love butter!)  It is fiddly to get the temperature just right for piping but the taste more than makes up for it.

Made this with the"White almond wedding cake" recipe on site, for sisters wedding, Best cake and frosting I've ever done on a wedding cake to date! Tip: Make sure the flour/heavy whipping cream mix comes completely cool before adding so it doesn't get"soupy" on you, don't use butter flavored crisco, and reduce butter extract a little & add a little more vanilla instead. Can't wait to try the chocolate version of this :) Can't wait for a reason to make this again, very happy, also only use unsalted butter. thanks all recipes!

I *LOVE* this recipe! It has become my absolute favorite.  I find most buttercreams too sweet and gritty.  This one is just perfect.  I get rave reviews everytime I use it!  Thank you for sharing Kristen.

This recipe is close to a french buttercream used by one of the local bakeries.  Not too sweet but very creamy... if you like really sweet icing this is not for you.  The only change was that when I microwaved the whipping cream and flour, I stopped the microwave to mix as advised by another reviewer.

I tried making this frosting. After reading all the reviews I thought it would be a terrific recipe. I was wrong. I could not taste anything but the shortening which was revolting. I ended up throwing it in the trash can. If anyone decides to make this recipe.. I recommend finding an alternate solution or add less of the shortening

I followed this recipe exactly as written but something went wrong somewhere. While the icing tasted great, the texture was a greasy mess. It was impossible to work with. Kept adding powdered sugar to get it to thicken up but to no avail. And when I tried to add food coloring (the gel kind sold in cake decorating stores) the color did not take.  I ended up adding cream cheese to it and using it as fruit dip.

I made this frosting for my son's Sponge Bob cake and it turned out great. I used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening. I hate baking with anything but real butter; however, for cake decorating, this one worked for me because it has a mix of both.

this is not a true french buttercream icing. french buttercream incorporates egg yolks, therefore has a yellow tint. this is more of a simple buttercream. nonetheless, a good one.

I just finished making this recipe to frost a "barbie cake" for my daughter's bday party (the doll's skirt is the cake).  I love this frosting because it's light and airy.  I didn't alter the recipe at all, except to double it.  My only advice is to make sure your butter is at or near room temperature so you don't get lumps.  Also helpful to use a heavy stand mixer, as the extended mixi

So much to love about this recipe!  Fluffy, but rich tasting, goes on beautifully, sets up well when refrigerated.  I didn't have butter flavoring so I used almond and it was terrific.  Next time I will try cutting the shortening as some others suggested.  Thanks for submitting.

I'm giving it a 2 stars because the flour mixture was lumpy, but I liked the taste so I will try making it again.  I will also try microwaving the flour mixture in 10 sec increments like someone else had suggested and hopefully it will make the mixture smooth.  I also added some 'drinking chocolate' powder that is 57% cocao and it tasted great.

I made this buttercream recipe today and it was outstanding. I have been taking a cake decoration class and absolutely hate the taste of the buttercream that I have had to use. My kids don't even like it. So when I came across this one I had to try it. It was easy to work with and very smooth. It frosted easily and made a nice border and filling for my cake. I did follow the recipe exact and probably the key to success is beating it for as long as they suggest. Not even close to being a runny frosting. I will use this recipe from now on and use a different firmer one for the flowers. I put the entire cake in the fridge and when it was chilled the frosting was firm on the cake. Great whipped cream taste.

I used the butter flavored shortening as suggested by another review. The frosting was really good and I personally like this type of consistency, I did not find it lacking in sweetness like others. I did find it a little too rich, I agree that the shortening could be cut down, it gave me a stomach ache.

This was good, very close to a recipe I lost.  Doubled for a 2 layer cake and also added extra powder sugar, and no butter extract.  This is a very rich frosting.

Very easy to make, very easy to work with.  It made enough icing to frost and fill a 2 layer 9" round cake and do some decorative accents on the top and sides.  
Took food color very well, too. I'm extremely pleased with how easy this frosting was to work with. It did stiffen up nicely when cooled. 

The flavor was good, for buttercream.  The kiddos loved it.

I cut this recipe in half and it turned out great. I decreased the mixing time by half. I used salted butter because I didn't have any unsalted and it didn't affect the flavor. Very, very good, I was licking it out of the bowl!

This is one of the BEST frosting recipes ever and I have already tried it with lemon extract for a lemon cake recipe.  I use this recipe regularly and it is a must for the dessert section in your cookbook!!!!!! I like the fact that it also makes cookies easier to store in your freezer since it hardens well (but thaws equally nice) ~ not all sticky like some frostings which can result in a less-than-appealing looking cookie when you take them out.  Thanks so much!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!!!  It's great for those that don't like the traditional buttercream frosting due to it being too sweet.  This is sweet but it's not over-indulgingly (sp?) sweet.  Those that are complaining about the shortening taste, you should try using butterflavored shortening.  That is what I used and I thought it was perfect.  I used it to frost a 9" two layer cake and had plenty left over.  Try it, you won't be dissappointed!

Excellent, smooth texture! I used 3 Tbsp. flour and added an extra 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and  I substituted margarine for the shortning.  VERY easy to spread, and it was so light and fluffy!  Not as sweet as "typical" frostings, which I liked. This is a keeper!

I don't like canned icing, and so I decided to make my own for my son's first birthday, and I loved this light creamy icing. It was also very easy to make (I never made icing before and it turned out perfect) As others said, it spreads very easily and is good for decorating. I did use a little extra sugar, just because I didn't feel like measuring exactly.  My father in law said "it was alright" but I think he likes the really thick, sugary icings. So, if you are like him this recipe is not for you:)

I am an avid baker and my mother made and decorated cakes for a side line, which I have done also. My daugher-in-law wanted a Red velvet cakes with buttercream frosting, so I chose this one. I am so glad I did. It is the best icing recipe that I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and try this. I did add vanilla butternut flavoring instead of butter flavoring, only because we love that flavor.

This recipe was not sweet at all.  It frosted beautifully and looked great though.  It just was not sweet enough for me or for my family.  (Even though I more than doubled the powdered sugar it called for.)

Very good recipe. Easily frosted 2 dozen cupcakes with tons left over. I didn't use the butter flavoring and it still turned out very good.

This recipe is GREAT!..I followed it exactly and everyone loved it.  I used it for the bottom half of my son's Elmo cake.  I stored in the fridge overnight and took it out an hour before I served it.  Big hit!!

I am getting into the cake business and have taken classes on decorating.  I recently had a request for this french buttercream icing and (as the young folks say), OMG! This is fantastic! It's light, flavorful, easy to work with on wedding cakes, and coupled with a butter recipe that I'd handwritten, and can't remember where I'd gotten it from, it is the very best recipe for frosting I've ever tasted.  The texture and flavor surpass all others. That is why my first stop when looking for recipes is with this site.  Thanks!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, the buttcream recipes I have tried before are good but not this good! I didn't have any whipping cream so i used evaporated milk instead and it was awesome!

This is my new go-to frosting recipe!  Some other reviewers complained about the consistency, heaviness of butter, and lack of sweetness.  Well, to each their own, I guess, because it is for those reasons I thought this was a great recipe!  I felt it was plenty sweet (without being too sweet like a store-bought buttercream) the buttery flavor was delicious, and this recipe decorates incredibly well.  If you like a lighter (not on calories, of course), fluffier frosting, this is for you!

I did not care for this AT ALL.  Most of my guests said the frosting had a greasy flavor or like eating butter.  Appearance-wise this frosting looked fine, but we were very disappointed by the flavor.  Will not make again.

This is much better than regular frosting! Results are just like what you'd get from a bakery. Be very careful with your microwave, or you'd end up with cooked doughy stuff instead of a milk and flour paste. (I use milk instead of cream... it works fine.) Instead of shortening, I use margarine.

This would be a great recipe for frosting soup. Not sure what went wrong, followed the recipe exactly. Maybe the microwave was for too long? I mixed for at least 20 minutes (constantly watching) until it started separating.

This recipe was ok.  A not so sweet buttercream.  If I made it again I wouldn't use shortening and use a lot more powdered sugar than called for.  It does get a too greasy flavor.

Fluffy and light. Much better flavor and texture than decorator's icing. I did not find it greasy or too buttery at all. And it piped nice borders and lettering. If you pipe roses, be sure to refrigerate because it is a soft icing that will lose its shape in warm weather.

Best frosting recipe hands down!  Especially if you're not a big fan of the kind of frosting on supermarket cakes.  To those of you who said it tasted like shortening, have you  checked your expiration date.  You shouldn't taste it unless it's rancid.  When you open the can it should have no smell.

This frosting is more like a whipped topping consistency.  Not the type of frosting I was looking for, but does have a nice light flavor.  Would be great on a cake, not on cookies as I had wanted.

Everyone loved this frosting; my mother even called and asked me how to make it!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I don't like to use shortening, so I used extended butter instead (oil, water, butter & lecithin) and omitted the butter flavoring (didn't have any!)

The shortening taste is out front.  It gives it a greasy texture and after taste. I did use less shortening and added more sugar to mask the taste.  The frosting wasn't fluffy or light. The recipe makes more than enough to frost a 8" cake. Have to say my children really liked it.

I tried this recipe last weekend.  The texture was great as compared to other Buttercreams that aren't cooked.  I thought I did something wrong because it was not soupy, but it came out good.  The only thing I would do differently the next time is no butter flavored extract.  Made it too sweet or something.  Great recipe!

Thanks for this recipe. It is the best frosting I have ever had.  My whole family raved about it. Excellent on cookies.  I used orange food coloring in it and made everyone I know Halloween cookies. I will definitely use this recipe for all occasions.

Great frosting!!! smooth and delicious, easy to spread as silk, not too sweet either. I also used 3 TBSP of flour only and heated cream/flour mixture in saucepan 1 minute only instead of microwaving. Used less shortening and increased butter by 1 TBSP., increased confectioners sugar by 1 TBSP. My husband who is a frosting expert LOVED IT!!!

This icing was very light and not too sweet. I made my sons a dinosaur cake by piping method 
and also spreading all over the cake.  It is important to follow the directions precisely and have the butter room tempature.
My guests just raved about this cake!

She came across this buttercream frosting recipe the other day and has made at least a cake per day since. It's a good thing we have family to give all these cakes to lol. She says it's fluffy and structured enough to do what she wants it to and that it doesn't bleed like a lot of other frostings do. In my personal opinion, it's delicious. The only modification I've seen her make is to add a pinch of salt.

This is a great recipe.  Like a lot of others I cut down on the flour used and used butter flavored shortening.  If you are looking for a sweet icing, this is not for you.  This is a very light, creamy buttery icing, and I will make it again!

I love this recipe.  It tastes light and fluffy like whipped cream but it's stable.  It has just the right amount of sweetness for me and has gotten rave reviews from friends and family.  I made exactly as directed and found it necessary to refrigerate it just a little in order for it to hold its shape when decorating.  I was able to do some simple piping and swirls.  Probably not the recipe for doing fancy decorating but for taste, it beats every frosting recipe I've tried hands down.  I've made it several times now.

I just made this frosting for the first time and it is AWESOME!  I never made French Buttercream Frosting before but thought I'd try it as I'm trying a variety of frostings until I find the ones I like.  I followed the directions as is, using both 1 lb of butter and 1/2 c butter flavor margarine, and whipped the dickens out of it in the mixer to make it light and fluffy, even added the cream and 4T flour together and thought it just fine.  What I love about this recipe is how easy it is to frost a cake!  I frosted my two layer cake after having just finished mixing up the frosting and it went on sooooooo smoothly!  I was even able to make hard edges on my cake and smooth away the frosting lines, something I hadn't been able to do before.  This is definitely a keeper!

I was very excited about this recipe after reading the reviews.  The frosting came together beautifully and spread perfectly.  However it was very greasy for my taste and not nearly sweet enough.  Back to the drawing board to find the perfect buttercream.

This reminded me of a recipe I used years ago but the flour and liquid were cooked on the stove to make a paste and if not caught in time would have a burnt taste. Because of all the review "stars" I decided to give it a try. It was very easy and had a great texture to it but I detected a slight floury taste. I plan on making it again but as some of the reviews suggested, I am going to add less flour and use more butter/margarine. Has anyone tried 1/2 the amount of cornstarch in place of the flour and what were the results?

Fluffy and smooth consistency.  Be sure to fully cool the flour and milk mixture before adding to the butter and sugar mixture. Put in the freezer or refrigerator for a few minutes to speed the cooling time. This isn't an overly sweet frosting, which is why I like it. The frosting balances nicely with the cake and any fillings (I used lemon) that you may use which are plenty sweet. I would suggest increasing the vanilla flavoring, I used about 3 teaspoons. Wonderful recipe!

My birthday boy (3) usually eats the icing and nothing else but even he did not like this icing! It did not taste good at all and I felt so bad for him because I was trying so hard to make him a nice birthday cake. It wasn't nearly sweet enough and it was incredibly bland. It was very fluffy which made for a slightly insubstantial texture, detracting further from the total lack of sweetness and flavor. I didn't have a need to pipe it so I can't say for sure, but I would think this would be a very difficult consistency to decorate.

I thought this was a great icing recipe. I cut the batch in 1/2 and then split it for coloring. Had a good flavor - and nice texture. I like the texture of buttercreams made with shortening, but hate the flavor, so this was a nice mix for me. This will be a standard icing for me.

I loved this recipe!  It wasn't too sweet and it was light and fluffy.  For a twist, I folded in some melted white chocolate and it was a hit!  It won't work well for decorating and may not get really smooth, but it tasted great.

I LOVE IT!!! Beats out any of those super sweet blah buttercreams.
I've always liked european buttercream better than american as it's not insanely sweet.  I wasn't sure how the flour would help but it really does all go together.  Thanks Kristen for sharing!!

Very nice results with this recipe, and the birthday crowd all agreed!  However I used the unsalted butter as stated, and had to add some salt because it was too bland. Maybe that's the way the French like it, but not me!

This frosting is wonderful!! It has more of a texture of whipped cream. I used it in place of whipped cream in the recipe for Black Forest Cake. The fact that it is not so sweet is a hit.

It is creamy , with just a hint of sweet.  I used salted butter.  Instead of regular flour, used Wondra.  Also used butter flavored crisco and in addition to vanilla, added a touch of rum flavoring.  This frosting tasted like it was from a french bakery!  Not sure why, but did not take nearly 10+ whipping time...was light and fluffy within 3-4 minutes!

I used this for a cake I made on Valentines.  Perfect texture.  Flavor was pretty good, just a touch of sweetness...perhaps I'd try adding a bit more sugar next time and use a bit less flour in the flour/cream mixture.  This might offset the flour-y taste I detected.  But over-all, a recipe I will use again.  Thanks!

I made this recipe twice over the course of two days.  The flavor is excellent; I think the butter extract really helps.  it was the perfect sweetness for me, kids and other adults.  Unlike other frostings, the texture was very smooth and light.  It was NOT gritty from confectioner's sugar like some recipes are.  The first batch came out perfect.  The 2nd batch, however, had lumps of flour even though the cream/flour mixture was smooth going into the microwave and coming out.  I used it anyway, and by the time I served it at room temperature the lumps had disappeared completely.  I would love to understand the chemistry behind the flour but I'm just happy it was smooth and creamy by the time the kids tucked in!  I love cake and frosting and this is the best buttercream frosting recipe I have found.

This was a really great frosting recipe.  I decorated my son's birthday cake with it and the colors came out well and it was a nice, not-to-sweet, fluffy frosting.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that, like some others, I didn't like the shortening taste.  I added more sugar to try to mask it, but it didn't help that much.  Maybe I will try the butter-flavored shortening next time like some suggested.

This was a great recipe.  I split the frosting up and added different food coloring to pipe onto the cake to decorate and everything turned out well.  It was the first time I actually successfully decorated a cake!  This was an easy recipe to use.

I love this frosting!  I followed the directions and it came out great!  Sure wish I had an electric mixer, but even with a hand mixer and almost 20 minutes of mixing it came out amazing!  The only problem I had was after I had whipped it up, I decided to add my food coloring - the color was there, but it looked a little "grainy."  Never the less, it tasted awesome and the cake turned out beautiful.  Oh, I did make flowers with it just fine.  Used a pastry bag and popped out some daisies with stems & leaves - it was easy!

I have been looking for a recipe like this for years. I remember my mom making icing that was creamy but not too sweet. This was perfect. a nice sweet topping for cake (and probably cookies too) but not too sweet. I could see adding different flavour extracts and colours to make it good on a great variety of cakes and cookies.

I was hoping this would be the icing bakers use, it wasn't, but it was very close.  It is very light in texture, and the taste is very good.  Although I was initially disappointed, I am now glad I found it.  Excellent for borders,and detail, but not for flowers. Thanks Kristen for submitting it.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL! I ALWAYS ORDER STORE CAKES FOR PARTIES, BUT NOT EVER AGAIN. THIS IS MUCH BETTER. I ALMOST RAN OUT BEFORE I FINISHED ICING THE CAKE, BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTED TO EAT IT. IT'S JUST RIGHT NOT TO SWEET.

This frosting is fantastic!  It was perfect for my rich chocolate cake.  I found I it tasted best when it was slightly chilled.  I have had lots of requests for the recipe since serving it.
