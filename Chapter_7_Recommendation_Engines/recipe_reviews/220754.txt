This dish was very good.  I like rutabaga anyway, but adding cheese just brings it up a notch.  I made a smaller quantity with just one rutabaga and I still have enough leftovers for a couple more meals.  It could become a one dish meal with some diced ham added.  I will make this again.  Thank you.

This was my first time eating or cooking rutabaga. It was absolutely delicious! I added a little bit more garlic but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I have also learned that dicing rutabaga is one of the best workouts you could ever do--they're hard to cut!!

Love this recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

The second time I made it, I didn't have any milk, so I substituted with unsweetened almond milk. The sauce turned out just as well as with dairy milk. My fiancé could not tell the difference. I boiled the rutabaga and placed in buttered dish as instructed, and added chopped frozen green and yellow beans, carrots, broccoli, and thawed chopped spinach, tossed to mix well. Sprinkled the veggies with red pepper flakes, and then poured the sauce over. Topped with seasoned bread crumbs and added some parmesan. Baked for about thirty minutes. My fiancé loved it, and said he preferred the added veggie version.

Thank you for this recipe :)

Will definatley make this again. My husband was thrilled with this dish! He had 4 helpings! What I plan on doing next time : making the cubes smaller (about 1/2") and adding whole kernel garden corn. We had corn on our dinner plates as well and ended up getting it mixed in and it was delicious! Overall, this dish was quite simple to make. Thank you!

Coming from the Upper Midwest, I love Rutabagas; mostly ate them in pasties.  This is a great comfort side dish with almost anything German.  Next time I'll use more cheese and a 1/2-1 C. less milk, maybe add some half-n-half.

I tried this in my brother's home. I like it, my brother was less enthused I told him let's keep trying rutabaga recipes until you find one you really like.Let's keep trying new vegetables and new recipes to add to our repertoire. I will keep trying

I don't like rutabagas that much plain but this was delish! I accidentally over boiled them but they were still really good.

So delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add more cayenne.  Otherwise, the recipe stayed the same and we LOVED it!

This was surprisingly yummy!  The rutabaga mellows with the boiling and baking—plus anything in cheese sauce is pretty wonderful!

I substituted the milk and bread crumbs with instant milk and a mixture of corn chips and pretzels. I used 4 cups of rutabagas and 2 cups of parsnips. Other than these i followed the recipe and it is really delicious! Try to serve it immediately.

I could eat this everyday!  I boil the rutabagas for at least an hour.  I don't think you can over cook them.

Not bad. I used more rutabaga and carrot than what was called for. This is a tasty way to use veggies, but I think I'm taking points off for not being a casserole type person. Plus who needs to cover everything with cheese in order for it to taste good.
