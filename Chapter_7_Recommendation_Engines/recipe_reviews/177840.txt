did not really like it this way. However, using the same ingredients (but using cheese slices)  I made some changes. First I found that slicing the chicken lengthwise and putting the ham and swiss in between like a sandwich and then browning it and putting it in a baking dish and putting the soup over the top was as easy. I baked it covered for 30 min. and then uncovered for 10 min. in a 350 oven. This recipe is a frequent flier in our house.

Quick and easy but not the real deal by any means. The sauce was ok and the chicken tender and in a pinch I would probably make it again.

I loved this, the only thing I think it needed was to be a little more juicy I guess, the noodles were a little bit dry, kind of stuck together. A little more soup would have cured that.
