I made these fries using olive oil, fresh minced garlic, pepper, creole seasoning, and parmesan. They were fantastic! These are now my go to oven fries.  Both my kids and husband loved them.  Thanks for sharing!  I served them with patti-melts for dinner. Delicious!

Delicious! I used evoo instead of the veg oil, some dried basil b/c I didn't have fresh on hand and I may have used a bit more cheese than called for (I used freshly grated). These crisped up nicely and had wonderful flavor. I will be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe!  Goes good with olive oil or coconut oil.  If you want to cut the baking time (which is what I prefer to do), just boil the potatoes for a few minutes then finish in the oven nice and brown, yum!

Oh my gosh! This is wonderful! I used canola oil and a little infused olive oil. I also used Italian seasoning instead of fresh but it still tasted great. My husband was actually licking the bowl I used to mix it all up it was that good. Thank you!

The combination of seasonings is great! My advice is to use parchment paper for lining instead of foil. You’ll avoid sticking and burning and will end up with crispy baked fries. And to make the process faster you can precook the potatoes. I do 1-2 minutes (depending on the size) of pressure steaming in my instant pot??

Loved these fries!!! Didn't use quite all the salt and pepper. After the cooking time I placed them under the broiler to brown them a little. Just perfect.

Oh my gosh! These fries were amazing! I had never made homemade fries before, and I was kind of worried about how they would turn out.  But, they ended up being delicious. I did make a few changes, though.  I used less salt, omitted the basil, and added a dash of chili powder and paprika. I also only needed to cook them for 28 minutes, so be sure to check them frequently.  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe, Holleta!

I am convinced that this recipe was meant to have maybe 1 teaspoon (or less) salt and pepper rather than 1 TABLESPOON! 1tablespoon salt for 2 potatoes cannot be right....Ridiculously salty as written. On the positive side the combination of flavors is good...so alter the salt and pepper and you’d likely have a 5 star winner.

I used dry basil and skipped the parm. They turned out pretty
good but not as crispy as I would have liked. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper.

Delicious but way too salty. I also will be cutting back on the oil as well. Fries didn't crisp up the way I wanted to. Good recipe, just needs a few minor tweaks.

I used chopped garlic because I had no garlic salt.  This worked fine.  I found them tasty.

I used about  3/4 the salt, 3/4 the garlic and about a fifth the pepper.  It was still too salty.  So, if I make this again, I'll be tweaking the seasonings.  Overall I liked the fries and they went along well with the burgers.  They were a nice mixture of crispy and soft, too.

This recipe is PERFECT for warding away vampires, kisses, and door-to-door salesmen. I'd recommend cutting all the spices in half, at least, for less garlic breath. Otherwise, very good; if you like softer fries, this is definitely the recipe for you; they fried up nicely in the oil on the aluminum foil, crispy Parmesan seasoning but soft inside. Cleanup was a breeze, too - just wrap up the foil and done! But yeah, cut the spices in half.

Baked longer than indicated hoping to get them crispy, but after 45 minutes they were still soggy with oil.  I think maybe the oven should be hotter??? The seasoning was delicious, though.

Good.  Make sure you use garlic powder, not garlic salt.  Has tons of potential!  Broiled the last 5 minutes or so for more crispness.  I sprinkled with cayenne and made a siracha aoli.  I like a kick!

I had all the ingredients on hand so I tried these. I used about half the garlic and it was still pretty strong. But it was good and I will probably make them again.

Tasty alternative and also to avoid frozen french fries. 
Decided to decrease garlic salt to 1 tsp. Cooking time for my oven required an additional 10 minutesto the 35 minutes, to make them cripsy on the outside.

Followed the recipe exactly. It came out so spicy and salty that we couldn't even eat it. I will try again but will cut the salt and pepper to half or less.

Loved this but a little too much salt and pepper for us so I will either add another  potato or just decrease to 2tsp each.  Loved the crunchy exterior!

I was out of Parmesan and I changed seasoning to a TBSP seasoning salt. I omitted pepper and basil and they were still amazing

Kids loved theses fries!!! I thought they were just a little bit greasy so I'll cut back on the oil next time. I also used nonstick foil which may be why I could use less oil. Overall a hit in my household and I will use this as my go to recipe for homemade fries. Thx for the recipe!
