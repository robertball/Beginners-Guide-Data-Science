This was delicious! I used Mexican veggie ground which gave it a kick of spice but not too much. Also added a bit of milk and butter to the potatoes. Will be making again :)

We made this as the main dish for our vegetarian Thanksgiving this year, and it was absolutely delicious! The only changes we made were that we omitted the creamed corn and used HP Sauce as we were out of Worcestershire sauce. It was wonderful, we'll definitely be making this again!
