I used sugar-free regular cherry jell-o because the store I shop at didn't have black cherry jell-o.  I also used tart cherries & Cherry Coke & half the nuts the recipe calls for as others have suggested.  I made it in my Tupperware jell-o mold & it turned perfect.  Everyone loved it.  I think I will experiment using cranberry jell-o for Thanksgiving & maybe try it with orange jell-o, Sprite & mandarin oranges in place of the cherries for a citrus salad.

Really good. It's a nice gelatin mold for Thanksgiving or Christmas because it has a deep, dark reddish color. The cherries and pineapple make a tasty blend.

I knew my Mom had used this recipe several times to carry to potlucks, and it was always big success for her.  I needed to fix a nice congealed salad for a large dinner at my church. This is the one I used.  I scaled the recipe for 16 people, and used a 9x13 pan. I did as suggested in other reviews, and used less pecans. It turned out great!

This was super-easy.  Even using sugar-free gelatin and diet cola, it tasted good.  The gelatin seemed really firm to me though--is it really supposed to be a 6-oz box of gelatin?

Very yummy. Now everyone wants the recipe! We made it with bing cherries in syrup but next time I will try cherries in water b/c it seemed a tad sweet to me. But everyone else thought it was fabulous. Will absolutely make again!

This, with the addition of one package of cream cheese, coarsely chopped, has been a tradition at our Christmas table for many years. It's so good! And here I was thinking it was a secret family recipe! :)

My family did not much care for this one- had to really encourage them to taste it, and they are not picky. We all agreed to the nuts (even cut in half) were very overwhelming. I guess we have to keep shopping.

This was very, very good. Following other reviewers suggestions, I chopped up the cherries. I also used a 3 oz pkg of Black Cherry Jello and a 3 oz pkg of Cherry, because that's all I had - it turned out well. I also omitted the nuts, because we don't care for them, and it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious dessert.  You wouldn't think that a recipe with so few items could be so good...but believe me it is. We only had 1/2 cup of pecans available and even for someone who loves nuts, pecans especially, they were plenty.

My aunt made this on Christmas Day and it was GREAT! She used walnuts that day instead of pecans, but she said it is even better with pecans.

Absolutely one of the most fun and flavorful recipes I've tried.  And it was delicious!  I used a beautiful and intricate bundt pan from Williams-Sonoma, and I didn't think it would come out whole but it did!  It was a big hit with everyone! Thanks Andee!

This version is okay, but is a rip-off of a much better recipe containing cream cheese.

I suggest those who like this try the REAL Coca-Cola(tm) salad. You won't be disappointed.

This was a hit at my last Christmas dinner!  I was a little scared about how it would turn out with the coca-cola in it, but I decided to try it anyway and it was the talk of dinner.  It was Yummy!!!!!

I made this for our family holiday gathering.  It was a huge hit!!  The only change I made was to leave out the pecans.  I love pecans, but not every one is fond of nuts, plus I was afraid the nuts might get soggy.  Really an easy and wonderful recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe is very good and easy to make. The pecans add a great texture to it. Add the cool whip topping right before you serve it because after a few hours the cool whip begins to harden and has a butter after taste which isn't very good.

I couldn't taste the Coke that was used in making this salad. It tasted like it does when using water instead of Coke. Next time I'll use water in the recipe and drink the Coke. I omitted the nuts.

my husband loves this recipe.  I have tried it with pepsi as well but prefer the coca cola.  My husband doesn't like nuts so I make the recipe for him without and the recipe for guests with pecans.  Spraying the mold is probably the most important part to success of the recipe.

2 star with the nuts, it would have been a 4 star without them!

I'm not really a gelatin salad fan but this was very good.  I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it.  It's also very simple which is nice when in a hurry.

This is great and very easy. I used to have a similar recipe that used cherry pie filling. Couldn't find it and came across this version. Loved it

Great potluck recipe and soooooooo easy.  Like some other reviewer's I reduced the nuts to about 1/2 cup. Also cut the cherries in half before adding them.  Did not have black cherry Jello so I used wild cherry which worked well.  I used regular Coca'Cola.  Everybody wanted the recipe.  Thanks so much Andee for a simple but excellent recipe.

This was not very good.  I proudly set it out at Thanksgiving dinner because it was very pretty.  My in-laws told me how they were really looking forward to trying it as they love jello molds.  Everyone took one bite and pushed it aside.  The combination of flavors is not good.

I seem to be in the minority here, but I thought this jello salad was terrible!  The flavor was just not good!  It had a strong coca cola flavor (and I love coke) which in my opinion didn't mix well with the rest of the flavors.

My wife made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was excellent.  Did not get to taste too much of it as she ate most of it. Did use only 1/2 of cup of pecans.

This recipe has been in my family for years (at least 3 generations) as well.  It's easy to make and Thanksgiving just isn't Thanksgiving without it!

We use canned dark sweet cherries instead of fresh bing cherries.

Very good.  My Grandmother made a cherry coke recipe that I always loved.  I was feeling lazy so rather than dig up her recipe, I used this one which is slightly different, but just as good.  I used diet Wild Cherry Pepsi and regular cherry jello. I think I prefer my Grandmother's version, which has less pineapple.  I also always leave out the nuts.  Don't like them in this salad.

I used canned, whole dark sweet cherries instead of bing cherries and it was delicious. Next time I will chop up the cherries so there's some in each bite.
