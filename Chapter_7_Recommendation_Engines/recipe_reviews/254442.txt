Review from 7/7/16Man, these are awesome! They are so simple to make too. The whole family enjoys these so,  I keep a container in the freezer all the time now. During the warm/hot months they are so refreshing and filling, right out of the freezer. They are also great for road trips when kept in a cooler. Thank you, Alli,  for the wonderful recipe. **UPDATE** 9/9/16 I make these all the time and have found that, when using a mini food processor, I get better results grinding the cashews before adding the other ingredients. They seem to hold their shape better even though larger bits of cashews was nice, they fell apart easily. Keep these in your freezer for those "I need something sweet" moments. Trust me, your kids will grab these instead of candy. These are the true LifeSavers!

Loved this base! My food processor took a bit of a beating, but it worked out great. I added a bit of vanilla and maple syrup to help it stick together.

These are delicious! I had to make a few alterations- I didn’t have cashews so I used half almonds and half walnuts. Also I added a little more flax meal than suggested and a few dried cranberries to lessen the sweetness. And I added some almond milk to help my mixer out. 
They are a little sticky so mine don’t look perfect. But I don’t mind. 
Tastes great! Perfect protein bite.

These are very good.  Paleo-friendly, which was what I was looking for.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making these often.

I made them for my husband and he liked them.  He did say it seemed like a lot of work for the amount you got.  I thought they were different and I liked them.  I did have trouble getting them to stay together.
