Flavor yes, consistancy no.  Too mushy.  Don't know if it needs more crackers or more time in the oven.  Maybe one can of cream corn and one regular one drained?  Will try to work with this.

Loved this recipe...now one of our new favorites!  Using the previous review, I decreased the milk to 3/4 cup and increased the saltine crackers to 23.  I did bake approx. 20 minutes longer. Perfection.

This really is a great recipe. These proportions seem to be for a family that likes a creamy casserole. Doubling up on the crackers won't be near too much. Taking out about 25% of the milk is best if you are not draining the creamed corn. It's enough bacon but a few extra slices never hurt anyone :) and don't be afraid to overcook it. You are going to want that firm bite. I cooked this for ages, you really can't overcook it, as long as your poking it every 10 minutes or so after the first hour. 

Thanks for posting this recipe, it's really fun to play with and customize.

I decreased the milk to 3/4 c and increased to 25 crackers.  It was a perfect consistency--and well enjoyed!
