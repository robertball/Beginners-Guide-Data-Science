Great sandwich that's a savory combination of sweet and spicy! I would have never thought to pair turkey, pepperjack cheese, and strawberry preserves but this defintiely works and is a nice departure from your "run of the mill" turkey sandwich. I used light pepperjack cheese and low sugar Smucker's strawberry spreserves. I'll definitely have to remember this one for leftover Thanksgiving turkey! Thanks Snowspiral!

I can't believe I forgot to review this!!!  I made it for the first time two months ago and haven't stopped making it since!  This is a great lunch item and has been my dinner a few times as well!  I love spicy/sweet stuff and this was phenomenal!    Thanks so much for sharing! :)

Wow!  These flavors go so well together!  Next time I might just spread the preserves on the inside.  Super yummy though!

We absolutely love this. I generally use at least 2 slices of cheese, it helps the meat adhere to the bread. I serve it with hot pepper jelly now, but I have served it with both raspberry & strawberry in the past. These are SO GOOD! Like a monte cristo without the work. (Or the deep frying.)

I ordered this in a restaurant, but it had swiss cheese and it was great.  I've made it several times at home since with whatever flavor jelly & cheese I have available.  Pepperjack & raspberry was tasty, as was mozzarella & grape!!

Delicious sandwich. I strongly recommend leaving the preserves as a dip on the side rather than spreading it on the bread; I made that mistake the first time I tried this and it was still good, but it's MUCH better as a dip. I don't bother with the butter, though. Quick and easy lunch or dinner!

Spicy is right. This was an excellent sandwich. My son liked it better without the strawberry preserves, I liked it better with, but I am a strawberry fanatic so I love anything strawberry. The sweetness of the jam was perfect at cooling the heat from the hot peppers. This was delicious! Sweet and spicy. Thanks, it's a winner!

We mix the strawberry jelly in with some plain yogurt.  I've put that mixture in the sandwich between the cheese and turkey and/or just used as a dipping sauce.  Ends up being like a monte cristo.  We have this often.

I thought this was fantastic, and my husband did too. We both thought it sounded a bit weird, but once we tried it, we were both hooked. It's a really interesting taste but it goes together fantastically.

I love having this sandwich for lunch.  As suggested by another, I spread the jam on the inside of one piece of the bread.  I usually don't have pepperjack cheese, so I use reduced fat swiss, sprinkle some crushed red peppers on the jam, and then put it in my George Foreman grill.  No butter needed.  It's delicious - thank you.

I thought I was the only person that did this!  I didn't have the right stuff for a monte cristo so I improvised and made this!  You beat me to the punch, lol.  These sandwiches are the BEST.  It's a quick "brunch" for dinner thing!  Love it!

This sandwhich is delicious as is, and has copious possibilities for modifications, e.g., add spinach and red onion, a slice of Havarti w/the pepper jack, the sky is the limit. Make sure to melt cheese and toast bread well! Yum!

Too sweet. And kids didn't like the butter. Banana sandwich with Granny Smith apples were better appreciated.

What a great combination!  I didn't have pepper-jack cheese, so I used some shredded colby jack cheese.  I sprinkled some on both sides of the turkey to glue the bread to the meat.  Also, to give it the missing kick, I used some horseradish.  It was delicious.   We will definitely be eating this again.

I believe this is a great new idea but I must have had too thick of slices of turkey because we just couldn't taste the pepper jack cheese even though I put a 1-1/2 slice on each sandwich.  I will say the strawberry jam on the side was nice.  I will try again but I'll put more cheese or less turkey on next time.

I just got don't with my sandwich and I really enjoyed it. I was a little worried about the jam and pepperjack cheese but they really compliment each other.
