More prep than I originally anticipated. However, we liked it and will make it again.

Would make it again.  Didn't have bourbon so we used rum.   It was great!

First, the Bourbon was mentioned in the Title of the recipe, but not in the ingredients list or how much! However I added 1/2 Cup per 3 lb cut of Pork.
I also added 1 teaspoon Cumin to this recipe.  It turned out fantastic!

Took awhile to prepare, but came out alright. I will probably make again with some modifications. way too much thyme for my taste. Not a fan of thyme anyway, I halved it for my first time cooking and it was still a bit overpowering. I think I will try to use 1/4 teaspoon or replace with rosemary. Had really good flavor with the bourbon.
