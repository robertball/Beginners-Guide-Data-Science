I am new to canning and gave this recipe a try.  It is delicious!!  I ended dipping my bread in it, but I know I will love it as a pasta sauce, pizza sauce or for just dipping bread into.  I may even try making soup with this.

Made this for the first time in 2010.  Fantastic, but if I were to add one thing would be a little garlic.  We used it as a spread over cream cheese and spread for wrap sandwiches.   I have added it to me yearly canning schedule

This is good, but not to die for. It just tastes like roasted bell peppers, and is a whole lot more work than just roasting them as needed.

Phenomenal!!!! We spread it on sandwiches and they taste like something extra special. Both my husband and I love this and will make it every summer--whenever we can get plenty of fresh red bell peppers. Really great recipe. And easy to do. I do a LOT of canning and this is my new favorite.
