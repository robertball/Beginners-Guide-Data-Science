I made these cookies for a co-workers birthday and everyone at worked raved about them! I used a chocolate instant pudding mix along with a cup of chocolate chips, which created the best double-chocolate cookies ever!  This recipe is very simple; the cookies turn out soft and chewy.  I strongly recommend this recipe!

are you supposed to make the pudding before you add it in? i did it without and the dough was so dry and sticky. the cookies didn't taste much better. for the second batch i added some extra milk to make it more moist, and this batch was still very bland, but was much more moist. i used bisquik mix, applesauce instead of oil, and the biggest box of chocolate pudding i could find (which was only 2.1 oz).  if i ever make this again i will make the pudding before hand and then fold it in to the mixture. i had such high hope for these, so if someone can tell me what i might have done wrong, i would love to give these another shot!

These turned out great and they were so simple.  There is another variation of this type of cookie on this website that uses all oil and no milk and they are really greasy, this recipe is much better.  I used lemon pudding and white chocolate chips for something different and they were delicious.

great cookie for little effort!  I substituted banana pudding and peanut butter chips with some pecans thrown in.  Definitely worth the experimentation.

I only gave this 3 stars cause there are just too many chocolate chips. Good recipe, but I made it again and cut chips down to 1 cup and added a cup of pecans. Going to substitute chocolate pudding and use peanut butter chips and peanuts this next time.. is important to use the right amount of pudding in recipe and oil, otherwise the cookies will be dry..

Tasted like, and had the texture of, a vanilla biscuit.  Which I actually wouldn't mind with a cup of coffee now and then.  I do think there is hope for  this recipe, I just think it needs sugar to be considered anything resembling a cookie.

I followed this recipe exactly using pistacio pudding. didn't knead the dough or make them as cut out cookies, just drop cookies. These are the BEST cookies I've made in a long time and couldn't be easier to make. Thanks!

Good start. I wanted to make cookies, but was out of flour so I found this. I did add sugar and am glad I did. The batter didn't taste enough like a cookie for me without it. They went over well at work.. devoured.

These are pretty good. It took no time at all to bake them. they are more like a scone than a cookie, but honestly i think that is what i really like about it. My kids 3 and 5 years old loved it. I have made two kinds, white chocolate and pistachio and I look forward to trying other flavours.

I'm T2 diabetic, so I try to cut carbs wherever possible-always on the lookout for recipes for cookies, cakes, etc that I can reasonably alter to fit my dietetic needs. I made these cookies with sugar-free pistachio pudding mix, sugar-free applesauce instead of oil, and skim milk instead of the ingredients originally listed.  I had to add a couple of packets of Equal sweetener, as the mix was a bit on the bitter side.  I added about 1/2 cup of finely ground walnuts to the mix as well.  I have to imagine that I didn't get the exact same taste as one would with the original recipe, but I got myself some cookies-and that's a good day for me, lol.

I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla since my pudding mix was old and the large size box (rather than 2 small) and added mini chocolate chips till they seemed the right ratio.  I'm estimating a little more than half the bag called for.  I would make these again, changing both the pudding a chips flavor.  Double butterscotch appeals to me.  Thanks for the recipe.
