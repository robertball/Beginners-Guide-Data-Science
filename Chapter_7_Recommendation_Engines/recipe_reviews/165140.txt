Very good recipe. I just finished making it and wow can I tell you it tastes amazing. I will def. make it again. I made it low fat by using applesauce instead of butter and I used skim milk instead of buttermilk. I also used lemon juice instead of lemon peel and about 1 cup of blueberry's instead of 1/2 cup. YUMMY!!!
