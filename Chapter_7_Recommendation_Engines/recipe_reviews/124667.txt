Because of the liquid in the bottom of the pan, the dumplings had too doughy bottoms for my taste.  After baking 35 minutes, I took them out of the pan and put them onto a dry cookie sheet and baked for another 10 minutes.  That made them much crisper for me.  (The photo I submitted was taken before re-baking them.)

This was absolutely delicious!  I used 4 granny smith apples, 1 "Grands" biscuit can (makes 8), and halve the rest of the recipe.  Put it in the oven for 40 minutes and YUMMMM!  Oh, I would recommend putting alumium foil on the 9x13 pan for easy cleanup!!

These were a really great treat! I think it's safe to say that you can easily halve the: sugar, water, butter & vanilla mixture and wind up with the same tasty result. I thought a lot of it would bake off or soak in, but it didn't so five minutes prior the timer going off, I used a baster to suction all of the liquid from the pan. This allowed the bottoms of the dumplings to cook up nicely without being soggy. Next time, I'm going to coat the apples in a cinnamon/sugar mixture before wrapping in the biscuits. Either way, they were delicious! Keep an eye on the baking time. Mine were done at about 28 minutes.

These we very good. We used apples from our apple tree so we had to sweeten the apples a bit so they weren't as tart! I would recommend not using as much butter on the bottom as it calls for! Biscuits have enough grease! All in all Delicious!

Delicious!  I reduced the serving to 8, used a package of croissant rolls that was already in the fridge, and reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes.  The apple halves had to be diced a bit to fit.  What an easy Sunday breakfast!  Even my super picky 2 yr old loved them!

I have made this three times now and I am a huge fan. I made it the first time around the holidays and it was like Christmas in a roll. I used granny smith apples.  Word of caution though: green apples are often smaller than red apples and too small apples means too little filling. I did use Jr. biscuits for my smaller green apples and this worked out well.

I cut this recipe by a third for a Sunday morning breakfast. My husband loved them! So easy and delicious. Definitely a great way to use up those fall apples!
