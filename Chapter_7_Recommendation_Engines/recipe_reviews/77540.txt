Great dip! If you don't want it runny you should allow time for it to cool some. I put mine in the fridge for about 45 minutes & it had set up some...perfect for dipping w/out too many drips. Made this for the grands w/ marshmallows banana chunks strawberries & grapples (grape-flavored apples)...great snack that really made them happy. Thanks once again Pam!

This was very good. I was hosting Euchre night and the ladies liked it. Great with so many things graham cracker sticks pretzel stick and chips pineapple banana strawberries apple slices. Be sure and allow the time to make it then refrigerate.

This dip wasn't that great. It was hard to get all the caramel to melt in and then the dip was really thin to dip fruit in. It's also very very sweet.

I made this for a dinner party dessert and it was a big hit. I served it with strawberries grapes apple slices and plain cookies. Another reviewer mentioned that the dip turned out runny and overly sweet; I will say that this seemed to be the case when I gave the dip a taste after taking it off of the stove. But after letting it cool to room temp and then chilling in the fridge for a few hours the dipping consistency was perfect and the taste was caramelly goodness. I'll definitely make this again.

This is good but it doesn't have as much caramel flavor as I expected. I think next time I'd try a little less chocolate or maybe milk chocolate.
