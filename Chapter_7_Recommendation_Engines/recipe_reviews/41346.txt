Don't be fooled by the long list of ingredients. This recipe is so easy to make. Awesome weeknight dinner! My family loved it.

I really liked this recipe, even though I had no caraway seeds! The best part for me was that I had only three things to clean up after it was finished! Next time I will add less water and more flour mixture. I like my goulash closer in consistency to stew than soup. I will definitely make this again!

This recipie just doesn't work, if you cook as described.  The flavor is nice, although the pepper is a bit over-powering.  I don't mind it though.  However, you need ALOT more flour than called for.  I kept adding and adding, and it just never got thick.  Finally, I threw in the towel, and served it soupy.  I was afraid after adding over 1/4 cup flour that it would start to taste floury.

I thought this recipe was very good and so did my son!  After reading the other reviews I decided to cut the water all together and add 2 cups of beef broth instead of one.  I ended up cooking it about 1/2 an hour longer, due to a laundry catastophe, but nonetheless it came out tasty.  We like our goulash a little saucy than most so I actually cut down on the flour and next time I might as well omit it.  I hope this review helps.  Every family has different taste, adjust it to yours.  Happy Cooking!

My family loved this dish.  I did not put in the caraway seeds and instead of 2 tsp. of flour I put in 1 1/2 T of flour.  This is a dish I will definetly do again.  Infact I will do up several batches of the sauce and freeze.  All I'll have to do is boil the pasta and then heat sauce and stir.

Delicious!  Just like the name says, I found it very easy to prepare, although I let it simmer for a while longer than called for.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of beer for some of the water, and reduced the water overall by 1/2 a cup.  Definitly a keeper!

Too much liquid for a true goulash, otherwise OK.  When adding the flour, it helps to take it off heat as sometimes you'll make unpleasant little dumplings otherwise. 

If you have the time or can find it, this is better served with Spaetzle or another potato and flour pasta as it helps with absorbing the liquids better than cooked pasta.

Easy compared to what?  Others that reviewed this are right.  Way too much liquid.  The water does need to be reduced and you need to use cornstarch vs flour, although I don't think it matters much unless the water is reduced.  Made as is DOES NOT WORK! Way too soupy.  Something is just wrong with this.

Delicious! I've never had goulash before so I don't know how it compares to a traditional recipe, but we sure enjoyed this one. My two-year-old inhaled the pasta! After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to thicken mine with cornstarch rather than flour so I could add a lot without ruining the flavor. Served with homemade black bread, yummy!

Not bad, can also make it with ground beef. I added a little hot sauce to give it a zip!

This was good, I didn't add caraway seeds, left out the extra water, and added a little more flour to make it nice and thick.  Had a nice "comfort food" flavor.  I liked it a lot more than my boyfriend did, he prefers my original recipe, but he thought this was still ok.  I'll probably stick my old recipe for his sake, but this one was a nice change of pace for me!

Pretty good for an easy week night meal.  I added grated carrots with the onions and green pepper and peas at the end for extra veggies and left out the water and flour at the end.
