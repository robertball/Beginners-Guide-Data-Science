I brought this salad to work and got rave reviews! I did alter the recipe somewhat, though. I added one pound of shrimp, chopped cucumbers, diced fresh tomatoes and dill weed.  Very good!

Good recipe but with the changes I made, very similar to one I already own.  I added 1 green bell pepper, chopped, 1 cucumber, peeled and chopped (I would have added 1 chopped tomato but I didn't have any on hand) and 1/2 tsp of dill. I'm not sure if I will make this one again (ONLY because I have my own version) but if I did, I would use a different noodle.  The angel hair was very difficult to serve...I'd rather use rotini or bow tie.  Overall, very good with my changes.

This salad was simply the best! I did substitute garlic ranch dressing for the ranch called for in the recipe.  Also took the advice of others and added dill.  Cucumbers and tomatoes added to the taste and presentation. Delicious!

I've been making this salad on a regular basis each summer for the past two years. Everyone I make it for raves. The longer it sets in the fridge the better, as the ranch flavor soaks into the pasta. I've also made it sans shrimp as quick and easy side dish for BBQ'd or grilled meat. A couple of times I substituted cold chicken for the shrimp (a great way to use up leftover chicken) and that's also delicious. Spring is here, and I'm getting a hankering for this salad again so time to stock up on the angel hair pasta and ranch dressing!

I have made this a few different ways now, I do not like it with the angle hair, or the garlic ranch alone. But loved it with the elbow pasta and a combo of garlic ranch and orignal I also added crab, celery, bacon , green onion, pepper, and dill. very good but needs more than the orignal recipe.

After reading other reviews...I modified the original significantly.  Fat free Ranch worked great (WAY too much fat in regular Ranch), adding Feta cheese was a good idea, doubling the sauteed in butter and garlic Prawns and adding the garlic butter was really good.  I also added some Broccoli, and used a different pasta. Hopes this helps other low fat food buffs.

This recipe is delicious.  I made the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing from the packet (instead of bottled dressing).  I also recommend breaking up the pasta before cooking it.

This is especially good when made with ranch dressing made from the packet, it just seems to have more flavor that way.  I added celery to it.

In addition to the other review suggestions( add dill, chopped cucumber, green peppers, roasted red pepper, more shrimp) I also added some crumbled feta cheese I had on hand. Without the additions, the salad would be too bland. It's a good basic recipe though. Husband enjoyed it- a keeper that's so easy.

This recipe was pretty delicious - I added a little more salt and black pepper because my ranch dressing seemed a little bland, and voila!  Also added chopped tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as a bunch of fresh dill, which made it taste even more refreshing.  Great salad.  There were no leftovers from a doubled recipe (it was a side dish at a 5 person dinner).  p.s. - i sauteed my shrimp with a little butter, garlic, and lemon juice to make it more flavorful.   UPDATE:  I now make this salad the following way:  Salad ingredients include 1 lb of any type of pasta, 1 lb shrimp, 2-3 tomatoes, 2 cucumbers, bunch of green onions.  Dressing includes 1.5 cups lowfat plain yogurt, 1 tbsp mayonnaise, dry ranch salad dressing mix, to taste, 2-3 cloves garlic, chopped fresh parsley, chopped dill.  Prepared this way, it's the most amazing and refreshing seafood salad you will have ever made.

I used Garlic Ranch dressing and added MORE shrimp.  I also broke up the pasta in small pieces before cooking like others recommended.  I was asked for the "recipe" by EVERY woman at the party.

this made a quick & tasty lunch - i added halved cherry tomatoes and a dash of lemon juice. i also used ranch dressing which i had made earlier from the powdered pouch, it has a thicker consistancy than the bottled version and coats the pasta better. thanks for sharing.

I'm giving this a 4 star because I took other peoples advice and put cucumber in it.  I think it was too much that is all I tasted.  I may make this again but I will do exactly as the chef said.  It was just ok.

This is an excellent recipe! I bought a shrimp ring and was looking for recipes to try. I'm not a fan of angel hair pasta, so I used egg noodles. Also, I did not have green onions, so I used a regular white onion and I used ranch dressing from a packet.  I chopped up the shrimp, a small white onion and I cooked them together with a pat of butter for about 4 minutes.  I do recommend letting it set in the fridge for at least 30 mins.  Thank you for the inspiration! :)

I added cucumbers and a few extra tomatoes....I used the Kraft Garlic Ranch and noticed that the shrimp runs about $10 for a 2lb bag frozen.  I bought it, but also got some Scallops.....$3 for 2 pounds and it was just as good!!!!!!  LOVE this recipe, I made a LOT of extra and it went to work with the wife, It was demanded that I give up the recipe ;)  Thx!

I made this recipe for a Baby Shower serving 30-40 people, and I got numerous requests for the recipe!  I used Litehouse ranch, and used the advice of other reviewers and added tomato and cucumber.  I didn't add extra shrimp as other suggested, but I would suggest that.  The 3rd time I made this, I used a different ranch and I did not like it at all!  So the type of ranch you use definitely affects the flavor.  I've tried this dish right after making, and it really is best after it's sat in the refrigerator overnight.  There really is more flavor, and it gives the noodles a chance to absorb the ranch.  Some people say it tastes slimy;  this is true if you try it right after mixing--the ranch hasn't had a chance to "condense" with the noodles.  Definitely very easy and very delicious!  I can see this working well with bacon or chicken instead of shrimp.  For a large group its supereasy to increase portions accordingly.

I made this recipe for my twins' graduation and it was a big hit.  I substituted imitation crab meat for the shrimp.  Not only was it a great hit, but was so easy to make.

Didn't care for this....the ranch dressing overpowers the other flavors, and I didn't care for the angel hair pasta in a salad (too starchy.) Not as good as the Shrimp Vermicelli salad.

When making this recipe I definitely took the other reviewers advice. I used the packet of Ranch Dressing instead of the bottled Ranch Dressing and it turned out great. I didn't add the milk to the powdered Ranch Dressing recipe as it calls for since I didn't have the 30 minutes to allow for it to thicken. I just added the Mayo to the powdered Ranch Dressing. I did add both red and yellow sweet bell peppers and cucumbers. I also took the suggestion of fresh dill. It gave it the extra bit of flavor that had everyone going back for seconds. I used the bow tie noodles as several suggested and was the perfect consistency and texture. I would next time add two/three cans of baby shrimps instead of just the one. As the baby shrimps did get hardly noticed. I also added a bit of lemon juice for flavor and I would defiantly make this again as it was very easy to do on short time.

Wonderful, fresh dish (considering I didn't have shrimp or ranch dressing.) I used bleu cheese dressing and it still tasted great.

Pretty good base idea, but it did need jazzed up a bit.  I added some finely diced celery and a chopped green pepper.  1/2 teaspoon of dill really brought it together.

This is a great 'foundation' recipe. I took advice from others and used bow-tie pasta, caesar dressing, 1/2 cup EVOO, 1 tomato and 1/2 cucumber. Sprinkled 1 tbsp of Bay Seasoning. Big hit.

tried this last wk, as i was loking for other pasta ideas.  was okay, but all the stuff like peppers, shrimp & green onions sank to the bottom-just slipped thru the angel hair.  guess i'll stick w/ rotini or shells for my pasta salads, tho i imagine it would be great warm.

This did NOT go over well in my house.  My husband called it slimey and said it reminded him of fake brains at Halloween.  I was not a fan of the uncooked green onion, biting into one make the whole bite taste overwhelmingly of onion. Bummer cause it sounded so good.

This was really good and easy to make. The only thing I did differently was I replaced the green onions with mushrooms, sweet onions, and brocolli. I suggest this to everyone.

I amke this for all my company functions! I would advise if you make it the night before and you take the salad somewhere. Take a half a bottle of ranch dressing to pour into it just before serving because it does soak up alot of the dressing overnight. But it is such a hit wherever I take it.

This was good but I don't think the shrimp went well with it. I think this would be so much better with chicken.

This was very good but I too used Italian dressing. I just don't care too much for creamy pasta salad. Anyways, it worked well and I added some tomatoes, celery and green olives too!

I used a pound of salad shrimp and a pound of crab meat.  YUMMY!  I did break the pasta up before cooking it.  I would use less pasta next time because we ate it for 3 days and still threw some away.  I'll definately make this again.

This is a good start recipe.  I added a pkg of seafood chunks in addition to the shrimp, some dill, fresh parsley, feta, etc.  It tok A LOT of dressing tho.  I used a whole bottle plus.  It was great, don't get me wrong.....but the original recipe would have been very bland.  Super idea tho....and easy to make your own.

This was wonderful!!! I didn't have angel hair pasta so I used large elbow macaroni. I don't care much for shrimp so I didn't add it. Like others I too added dill and garlic then added fresh ground pepper. I think that next time I will add crispy bacon and peas!!!

Excellent! I've made this on numerous occasions. My mother loves it, so I make it whenever she comes for a visit. I snap pasta in half prior to cooking (easier to mix and serve), and add parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper to mix.  Definitely a keeper.

This salad was a big hit.  I doubled the amount of shrimp and I would still add more shrimp next time or use less pasta.  Definitely good to break up the pasta.

I used original ranch dressing instead of bottled and added several frozen packages of small shrimp and it came out delicious, i would prepare this the day before; the pasta absorbed the dressing and it tasted really good.

With a few alterations, this was a superb pasta salad I used regular spaghetti noodles (didn't have and angel hair).I also changed a few of the seasonings. A great side dish to go along with the fish we had.

This was just what I was looking for. I would break up the pasta first and make less of it. It needed some zing so I added some dill spice. Perfect for the perfect occasion.

This is alright, but what I thought made it taste better was a few different kinds of bell peppers and instead of ranch dressing I used Italian. Yummy!

This was a simple, good salad recipe.  I lessened the amount of ranch dressing slightly so it didn't get too heavy.  It worked fine using light ranch, too.  It could use a little extra kick of some kind, though.  Maybe I'll follow the advice of others and add some dill.

This was a hit with the kids.  It served a big group of people and everyone raved over it.

I made this recipe for a BBQ and people loved it. I did change a few things for this salad. The first time I made it I thought it was a bit bland. I added chicken, like someone suggested, instead of shrimp, cucumbers and cherry tomatoes from my garden. I also made it with a Tuscan Family type dressing instead of ranch. Big hit and will make again.

I am on a low carb diet, so this recipe is off limits, except when I want to cheat alittle and this is worth it.

The shrimp and ranch flavor went well together.  I used whole wheat rotini pasta and added tomatoes and green peppers.
