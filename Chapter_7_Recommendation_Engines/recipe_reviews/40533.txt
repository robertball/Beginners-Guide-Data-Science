Excellent recipe, just like the Rohtkole you find in the best German restaurants.  Add a bay leaf or two for really authentic german flavor.  Froze well in my foodsaver and reheated better than the first time!

This was very good....almost as good as "rotekohl" that I have had in Germany.  The only thing that I did a little different is that I added 1/8 of a cup more brown sugar.  It was just a little too tart for me...really nice change to plain ole' saurekraut!

This is an excellent recipe!  I've worked with it twice now.  I had an awesome crop of cabbage this years thanks to my husbands ingenius irigation device.  Therefore I have adapted the recipe just a bit to acomodate canning the cabbage.  First I increased the recipe by 6.  Also I added 1 quart of my homemade applesauce which does include some sugar and cinnamon.  I used cider vinegar because it is not quite so strong, and I added caraway seed, ( about 2 Tablespoons) to the recipe.  I do not add the butter because I am canning the cabbage and sometimes giving it as gifts to my husbands Checz family. The butter though should be added upon heating as it does add so much to the flavor.  An excellent recipe, and I do find it to be too tart.

Very good! Took the advise of previous reviewers and used apple cider vinegar. Only used half the amount of vinegar called for. The full amount would be overpowering. That is the reason for the four star rating.  Using half the vinegar makes it a five star!! Will make often.

This is absolutely wonderful!  But...
I prefer to add the apples after the cabbage is cooked.  Otherwise the apples cook down and become pasty.  The spices are perfect!!  Thank you!!

Just great!  If you've never had it make it.  Cut the vinegar in half and used balsamic vinegar instead.  Put it in a crock pot on high for four hours.  So good (great with the Sauerbraten).

If you're anti cabbage-slicing:  I used one jar of red cabbage (drained), 2 Granny apples, 1/2 cup of white wine vinegar and 3/8 cup of brown sugar.  Mmmm...I will be making this one again.

This was a fabulous recipe!  It tasted like it came directly out of an authentic German restaurant. I used cider vinegar and reduced quantity to about 2/3 cup since my husband is not a fan of vinegar.  He wasn't planning on eating it, but actually admitted he liked it!  It is such a nice variation to your typical green beans, corn, peas, etc. & fairly healthy for you.

Way to vinegary for me.  I would cut the vinegar in half next time and maybe double the brown sugar - as I noticed on other recipes.

Great!  My husband and I are huge cabbage fans and since coming back from Germany, I've been looking for a traditional rotkohl recipe.  This is it!  I modified it slightly (I don't believe in rating recipes that I've changed, so no worries here), just enhancing the flavor of the cabbage by using about 1/4 c. apple juice and 1/2 cup water instead of all water, and crumbling a few slices of bacon into the finished product.  Since I'm on a dairy-free diet, I left out the butter at the end and added a dash of olive oil for some creaminess.  My husband ate half the pot all by himself in one sitting and the left overs were gone in a day.  Served with brats and a green salad.

Oh I just love red cabbage..so much better than the stuff from the jar! This is a great recipe..I just tweaked it a tiny bit. Used 2 apples and added a diced onion which I sauteed in butter first, then added everything else. Instead of white vinegar I used apple cider vinegar just because I love the flavor of it so much more than white. I also added a bay leaf and some caraway seeds and cooked it all for an hour and a half. It was surprising not to see any salt or pepper listed as part of the recipe..definitely needs both. But overall a wonderful comfort food side dish that went really well with pork tenderloin and roasted acorn squash. Thanks for sharing..will make again!

I'm giving this 5 stars for fulfilling an essential need for making red cabbage. In my area of Germany, we called this blaukraut. I'm sure this is authentic, but personally, I'm not big on spices in vegetables. I left them out except for a pinch of allspice and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I only used 1 granny smith apple, since that's all I had. Added an extra tbsp of vinegar, and like another, about an additional 1/8th cup of brown sugar, and left out the last tbsp of butter. In my opinion, the dish didn't need it. I cut the cabbage by hand, and as it was a little thick, I cooked this about 2 hours, til it tasted right, though definitely better than what comes out of the jar. Do not overcook. In the end, somehow it had a rich taste without the extra butter, so like I said, I didn't add it. I'm sure I'll make this again. My husband loved it, and it tied together well with rinderrouladen (beef rolls) I made from another site. Thanks.

I have to admit, I was a bit sceptical about a sweet and sour cabbage dish, but I'm glad I tried this one. This is a far cry from your average boiled cabbage. I normally try things according to the original recipe first, but I decided to go with apple cider vinegar per some previous reviews instead of the white vinegar the recipe called for. I still used the full cup and didn't  find the taste overwhelming, in fact the cabbage turned out to taste more like a tart applesauce. I actually enjoyed the flavor. I will definately be making this again.

A rainy day altered our menu yesterday and instead of using my red cabbage for a slaw I decided to make this.  It was a huge hit with my elderly dutch parents.  They filled their plates with it and asked to take the leftovers home.  I made it with 1/2 the vinegar as others suggested.  And I made it in the crockpot, so it was super easy.  I'm going to make a big double batch of it to freeze for my folks soon.

I made this for an Oktoberfest themed dinner party; it was the second most popular dish on the table next to the meat course! Several of my guests said they had never had a cabbage dish they enjoyed before this! The only thing I added was a teaspoon of caraway seed, which is a natural source of simethicone...I feel like it's really a requirement for anything involving cabbage for me and my family. But its flavor is pretty subtle, and in this case it didn't clash with the other spices at all!

This is good- just like what we had in Germany.  I didn't have regular white vinegar on hand so I used part white balsamic and part red wine.  I didn't add the full cup- just used 2/3 cup.  I was a little light-handed with the spices (because I didn't remember German red cabbage having those flavors) and I loved it.  The spices added a lot without really tasting like themselves.  Used 2 McIntosh apples and one Gala.  I did peel them, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

A keeper -- Husband came home from work, saw the purple gook and doubted it -- after 3 helpings, he said, "Keep this one!" I served it with mustard porkchops (1 T mustard, 1 T lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, salt pepper) that went great with the tangy cabbage. I cut the cider vinegar down to 1/3 cup and cooked it in a heavy skillet (minus the water) as I didn't have 45 min. to let it cook.

Can you say WOW?  
Words cannot describe this.  I knew I would be busy today so I prepared this yesterday in a casserole and refrigerated it overnight.  I used about half red wine vinegar and half distilled vinegar.  I had a few already sliced apples so I left the peeling on (healthy) and chopped them up into really bite size pieces. 
Shreded cabbage topped with apples topped with brown sugar and spices, pour vinegar and water (maybe use less water next time) top with pats of butter.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  I didn't preheat, just placed in cold oven turned to 
350 degrees, covered and let it cook.  It had time to saturate and cook itself with the vinegar.  I dont remember for how long, but until it fills the house with that wonderful aroma.  Arita Droog, way to go!!!!!!!  This would problably be good with regular green cabbage as well!!

This was delicious! I simplified it even more by using  1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual cloves, cinnamon and allspice.

If you like sweet sour red cabbage this is it!  Fantastic.  I make a batch and freeze enough for  my husband and myself in  food saver bags.   It is a wonderful side dish.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used only half the vinegar called for. It was good, but a little too tart for me. I added an additional 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and it was much better.

This recipe is soo easy - especially if you use a mandoline to shred the cabbage. I was concerned when the volume of liquid didn't cover the cabbage and apples but it cooked down just right. It's tangy and the apples add a little something sweet and a different texture.  I served it on top of this recipe and it was super tasty. The only thing missing was roast pork!

This is a great. BIG NOTE: If you make too much,it freezes REALLY WELL. I found some that I froze a year ago (!!!) in tupperware, defrosted, heated & served w/Apricot-Glazed Pork Chops... perfection!!

Wow, very surprising. I made this recipe for an Oktoberfest party. I made it the night before and then warmed it up in the crock pot. I did add a little extra sugar to balance the vinegar (thanks previous posters!) I had reservations about how this was going to turn out, (not very familiar with cooking red cabbage) but it was very tasty.

Great recipe, but I did do some tweaking after reading reviews. I used 1 1/4 cups of water, 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, only I omitted the butter, only two tablespoons of brown sugar, and two Fuji apples. I was looking for a recipe similar to my Mother-in-Law's red cabbage, and this came darn close! With my changes the recipe was still sweet, but had a nice tartness to it. I would have made the recipe as written, but I made the changes so it was more diet friendly. I'll definitely be making this again! Next time I might try it in the crockpot to save time in the kitchen after work.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe, but just realized I didn't add butter at the end...that sounds strange, though, so I don't know if I missed out. I didn't have time to cook this long enough, so it was a bit crunchy. It also made a TON! Next time I would chop the apples into very very small pieces-I found it strange to have big chunks mixed in, but I liked the flavor. I might try using apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, too. Not quite what we get in restaurants here in Germany, but close :)

Great recipe!  I tried it regular the first time and changed a few things the next few times such as apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and I add some lightly cooked onions to it as well.

Very nice! Perfect with bratwurst and mashed potatoes. The vinegar definitely comes through, but I don't find it to be a negative. (I used 2/3 cup apple cider vinegar). You can also taste the apples and cinnamon very strongly, and the cabbage taste is only a subtle note (I used green cabbage, but it works fine too.)

I love this recipe I follow it just like it is and turns out great everytime.  I love it but still the rest of my family isn't into veggies that much. I'll even reheat leftovers.  The apples make it really good and I would not leave them out...

I really like this recipe! The only thing wrong is it was a little too tart for our taste. Next time I will shred a bigger cabbage. Otherwise, delicious spicing and I love the apples.

This was good, but next time I'll cut the recipe in half at least. The taste is strong and unusual - it's not something for leftovers. My kids didn't like it. I used an older food processer to shred the cabbage. It would be better shredded very thin.

Loved this one.  Just smelling it cook brought back memories from long time ago when my mom made this.  Only thing missing is the onion.  Didn't put the cinnamon.  Poked the cloves into the apple (usually you poke it into the onion to retrieve it easily).  Added more apple as I love the taste tart apples bring to this.

After reading the other reviews, I used cider vinegar and added caroway seed.  It smelled wonderful while cooking, but I ended up tossing it out because it was too tangy for us - too much vinegar.  I'll try it again with much less vinegar.

Delicious, I didn't have cloves or allspice, so I used just the cinnamon and some nutmeg, diced up some leftover ham and threw it in for a great light dinner. I should note, I used a huge head of cabbage, but used other ingredients in the amounts written in the recipe. Recommended, we are adding it to the regular rotation at my house.

We loved this! Was looking for an alternative to cooking cabbage and this is perfect and very easy to make. I used pumpkin pie spice in lieu of the allspice and it still worked okay. Highly recommend!

I used apple cider vinegar as suggested by other reviewers and less than the recipe called for. I also added onion, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. I tasted it halfway through and it needed salt to bring all the flavors out. I would make again but add the apple further into the cooking process. Served with Dr Pepper BBQ ribs and cheesy potatoes.

This tasted very authentically German, served with roast tenderloin of pork. Here's a tip that came in handy: I only had whole cloves, but they ground to a perfect texture using my little coffee bean grinder. I omitted the apples because I didn't have any on hand, but added some apple sauce instead and I think it was an acceptable substitute.

Delicious.  Will definitely make again.  My cabbage was on the bigger side.  I used 1 c. of water and 1/3 c. brown sugar and left the other measurements the same.  Served with an authentic German meal. Perfect amount of tartness to compliment the heavy kartoffelkloesse

Fantastic. We like it without apples and I did 1 cup water. 2/3 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup brown sugar to make it a bit sweeter :)

Holy cow - this has turned into my new favorite side dish! And I pick red cabbage out of my mixed salads because I don't like it. This is a perfect side dish - tasty and easy.

We loved this!  My kids went back for thirds!  I did reduce the vinegar and used apple cider vinegar because that's what I had.  Maybe next time, I'll add a little bacon!  We had it with honey-mustard ham tonight and it was de LI cious!

So tasty.  I love the spice mixture in this dish.  Only used 1T of butter and 1T olive oil.I used raw cider vinegar, about 3/4 cup.  I added one half onion thinly sliced and waited to add the apples after cooking cabbage/onion mixture for about 8-10 minutes then just cooked about 5- 10 minutes longer.  I like it al dente.  I didn't use any water.

This is a great recipe if you particularly like red cabbage. I used MacIntosh apples which get soft but don't disappear. Be careful not to overcook it or it can get mushy.  That's its only negative (if that is a negative) but when done right it tastes great!

This was delicious hot or cold the second day, and even better the third day.  The first night I found it too vinegary and crisp.  Maybe I needed a longer cook time?  I added extra sugar and bay leaves.

Delish! Will never buy prepared red cabbage again. So easy. Left out the apple, because I didn't have any on hand and it turned out great. Thanks for a super recipe. Oh, I added a couple bay leaves.

Very good, but not as good as the red cabbage from our favorite german restaurant.  I doubled the recipe, but I used way too much cabbage I think.  Even so, I think the vinegar was too much and overwhelmed all the other flavors.  I will try this again as a single batch and see if I can get a better balance.  Pretty good, though.

As others suggested, I used less vinegar and more brown sugar.  I used 4 T brown sugar and 1/3 cup vinegar.  Both my husband and I loved it.  A great recipe!! This recipe reminded me of the one my mom made many years ago.

This was absolutely delicious! Our dinner guests talked about it all the way home - along with the German Rouladen and Spaetzle also from this site my hubby and I made it with. I did use apple cider vinegar and 1/2 cup less according to the reviews, I also neglected to peel the apples but they were chopped up so fine you couldn't even tell. Yum!

I thought this recipe had a bit too much bite for my taste.  I'll use less vinegar next time.  I used White Balsamic vinegar.  My dh liked it more than me.  The kids didn't like it at all.

This recipe is very similar to one that an older Dutch women used to make me when I was a kid. A little bit more tart but I guess it would depend on the size of cabbage. I would put a little more sugar and a little less vinegar next time.

Excellent red cabbage recipe.  Followed the recipe, but cut it in half. Will definitely be making this again.  Excellent with pork and lamb

I would have never thought to pair apples and cabbage until now. Never having eaten this before, I invited friends over that has had it.  This recipe was so easy to follow, and they said the taste was spot on.  I LOVED it!

I started with four bacon slices chopped and 1/2 cup of sweet onion chopped and fried them until bacon was crisp and onions softened ( about 2 or 3 minutes) and then followed the recipe. I did use Apple cider vinegar and only 1/2 of what was called for. I also doubled the brown sugar. I used apple juice for 1/2 of the water to cook the cabbage.  The basic recipe is good and my changes were an attempt to duplicate the flavor of my German Mom’s red cabbage.  Came out very close but I suspect the difference was in the cabbage itself.  The cabbage she used was a variety with more loosely formed leaves and this one had a tightly formed head and was difficult to slice.

Delish.......made mine with apples and red onions. This time, I added some Asian sesame marinate to it at the end. Goes great with pork, salmon......added some on top of my turkey burger. ??

8.26.18  I’ve made a number of red cabbage recipes on this site, and this is a very good one!  It’s pretty mellow with the white vinegar, and I just might try cider vinegar next time just for a bit more tang, but still,  it had a good balance of tart-sweet.  This one’s a “no-brainer” with pork, and that’s how it was served today.

Delicious!  This is so simple to make and tastes so great. I love vinegar, which is why I was looking for a traditional German Red cabbage dish, and this certainly didn’t disappoint. I will make again and again!

Very tasty. I did make a few changes: I sautéed one small onion with the butter before adding the other ingredients. I also used 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, and I added about 1/2 cup golden raisins that I wanted to use up. Everything else was per the recipe.

Simple to put together and SO delicious. The only change I made was to use apple cider vinegar instead of white.  Tart, sweet, and savory. A perfect accompaniment to our German themed meal with spaetzele and sausages.

I made this to accompany bratwurst w/onions & peppers and sweet potatoes.  It was delicious-as good as red cabbage we had in Germany and Austria!  I used apple cider vinegar - next time, I'll cut the vinegar in half and either use some apple cider or juice, or up the sugar a little to balance the sweet and tart. Thanks for the hints! This is a delicious and simple recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

I have used this recipe for our church’s Oktoberfest for several years. I have gotten so many compliments on it - I’ve been told numerous times it’s the best they’ve had - but the one think I’ve heard from Germans is - it’s very authentic. That and it smells like autism when it’s cooking!   Expand great to serve 80 as well.

It was far too vinegary for us as well.  We had to double the sugar, and we doubled the apples as well.  It was certainly easy to make. If I use this recipe again I'd halve the vinegar.

Easy to make and I agree w/ other reviewers that it tasted like what you might find at a German restaurant. Delicious and will make again. Thank you! I used 2/3 c. apple cider vinegar, as suggested by others.

I hadn't made this in 40 years.  It was tasty.I doubled the recipe but only 1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar. No cloves.I didn't want to spend $5 on a little jar.But the allspice and a couple shakes of cinnamon was enough spice. I used a food processor to slice it thin,and the texture was great.

I cooked it on high in my crock pot for 1 hour then turned it down to low for 2 hours. I also added about a cup of raisins. Turned out good & I froze left overs. Would make it again.

We loved this red cabbage and apple recipe, but I only used about a third of the suggested amount of vinegar.  It was delicious hot, but was also good as a cold leftover.

I did not make any changes to this recipe except using the apple cider. I knew it needed to be prepared the day before, as all cabbage recipes should. 
Excellent! It reminded me of my years spent in Heidelberg!

I hate to leave a review on a recipe that I didn't make exactly as written, because then it's a review of a different recipe. However, I had to improvise because I was somehow out of apples.  I added about 1/8 of a cup more brown sugar to compensate for the sweetness the apples would have brought.  This was an easy recipe that came out well.

Delicious recipe!   I loved the spices, but used very little clove, as it is also contained in allspice.   Very easy to make.  Will definitely do it again.  I served it with homemade smoked sausage.   Perfect!

I loved it but I also used apple cider vinegar(about half of what the recipe called for)-I would also cut back a bit on the cloves for those that don't care for the taste of cloves. But this is a wonderful recipe and definitely make it ahead of time.

I really like this dish, but as others have mentioned, I found it a little on the tart side. What I might try next time is using a little less vinegar, and perhaps trying half balsamic and half regular vinegar. I think using all balsamic might be a bit too strong and sweet. I love the spices.

I did like this, but the vinegar taste was a bit strong.  I am going to try it without the vinegar because I believe the rest of the ingredients would really POP without it!

Loved it.  I took the advice of others and used apple cider vinegar and bay leaves. I think there was something missing, though.  I used half the amount of vinegar as recommended by others, but I ended up adding more in for a total of about 3/4 cup.  It still tasted a bit bland, so I added salt and pepper.  Make sure you cut it in thin strips per the recipe. Looking forward to tasting it on day two.

I agree with meandmsjones:  less vinegar, more sugar.  With changes it became a four and a half star recipe.

I used the apple cider vinegar after reading the reviews. I didn't have any cloves and only used two red apples. Had to simmer for over an hour to get the cabbage at a good cooked texture.. Very good and we'll make it again.

It was tasty.  I took someone's advice and halved the vinegar, also I substituted white wine vinegar.  Anymore than 1/2 a cup would have far too tart.  It was tasty as is.

It was a bit more tart than expected and I'm not sure it was a good side for sauerbraten. I'd reduce the vinegar a bit in the future. Thanks for sharing!

Super-easy AND delicious!  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this, as I do not typically care for cinnamon in my sides and entrees.  Perfect blend of flavors and quite lovely!  Thanks!!

It is very vinegary but I like that flavor. I had three heads of cabbage to use, so I tried this recipe with some of it. Glad I found it!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I usually throw an extra apple in because we like apples.  If there ever is any leftovers it is not much and by the end of the night someone will polish it off as a snack as they watch tv.  I always wanted to see how the flavor would improve in a day or two but we never get past day one!

Great basic recipe! I did half white vinegar and half apple cider vinegar. I used two apples and half a small red onion. I added extra brown sugar ad left out most of the dry spices. Keep it simple and add later to taste. My boyfriend always loved the Kuhne brand out of a jar but I think he will enjoy this fresh version much better!

My mom and I had something like this years back at a German restaurant. When I saw the recipe while searching for low sodium options, it reminded me of it. Only thing I added differently, was about a cup or so of apple juice near the end to sweeten it up a little more. Otherwise, it does have a vinegary taste. The next day, it was even better!! It's even tasty cold! I think it would be great on hot dogs or hamburgers in place of relish!!

Easy to make and tasty.  Would be great with sausage.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of white vingegar, and used half the amount.  Added a bit of salt as well.

I liked that it was a different way to serve red cabbage. It wasn't bad, just not my favorite. Maybe it was too sweet for my liking. If I were to cook again, I'd use less sugar AND less vinegar as others have suggested.

This is the absolute best red cabbage recipe! I used apple cider vinegar and added a little mustard but wow this recipe is insane. I also find it's best to add the apples in after the cabbage has cooked a little.

We used this recipe for an Oktoberfest we did for one of our clients and this was very easy and the taste was great. We did not cook the apples to mush which was a plus they loved the appeal to their palate.

Cold or hot this a nice side dish. Let it cook for the correct amount of time to get right softness. Next time I will cut the vinegar in 1/2 and see how it tastes. We are also thinking this would be great on a hot dog.

This is delicious. It was exactly what I was craving and went perfect with my chicken sausage. I did make a couple changes. I used a 1/4 cup honey instead of brown sugar and I added a small chopped onion. I'll definitely use this recipe again :)

Excellent!  I used 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar.  During cooking, I added an additional 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  My allspice was whole, so I doubled the amount, bagged it in a coffee filter and dropped it in the pot.

Awesome recipe.  I have to admit I was a little concerned while I was cooking it that the spices would be kinda weird, but it went very well served on the side with the German Rouladen  from this site.  The flavors were awesome together!!!!

Very good but like others said, I will have to cut the vinegar in half. I also added some fennel and 2 bay leaves as others suggested. It was good, edible, but a little too vinegary even for my German tastebuds lol

Looking for a dish to bring to an Oktoberfest, I found this recipe and decided to try it because of all the positive reviews. I adapted it by using apple cider vinegar (and half the amount), adding 1 cup of brown sugar instead of what the recipe called for, adding an extra apple (I used 1 Gala, 3 small Granny Smiths), using pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice (might be the same thing?) and using more of all the spices than listed...and added a dash of salt. The cabbage I used was about 6in. in diameter and the yield was quite a bit. Anyway, people loved it!

This is absolutely delicious. THE BEST! I followed Carolynn's suggestions because I too was going to can the cabbage. I used cider vinegar instead of white. I tripled the recipe as I had 3 cabbage heads. I only used 5 apples. This is the genuine, authentic taste that has not been "sugared" down for American palates! YUM!!!

This was wonderful and so easy to prepare! I served it with a cucumber salad and creamed beer brats over spaetzle noodles. It made a perfect german dinner.
Don't forget that german beer!
