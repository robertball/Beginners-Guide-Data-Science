I was searching for my mother-in-law's recipe for canberry salad and found it here.  This is a real favorite for any gathering at any time of the year.  Women and kids in particular seem to really enjoy it.  You can also make it with cranberries that you have frozen, whole, in the bag, so that it is possible to make this for a summer barbecue or block party.  Not just for Christmas!

My great grandmother also made this recipe and I never thought I would see it in someone elses collection. haha My grandmother always added 1 ground navel orange (Sounds strange I know but added it, it is wonderful!) and only a cup of grapes that were cut in half. Always a good Christmas recipe!

My mother used to make this for holidays when I was a child.  It's an old favorite.   After crushing the cranberries in the blender, she would also add a cup of grated apple instead of the grapes (it tones down the tart cranberry flavor, but grapes would probably do the same).

This is about like my mom's cranberry salad which is our family favorite. Ours is a little different.  We only use 1 cup sugar, no marshmallows and the whole container of a small cool whip.  Delicious!

Very yummy.  My grandmother used to make this and it is so good and very forgiving if you want/need to change the ingredients.

This is a must have at holidays.  I make my own whipped topping with whipping cream, powdered surgar and vanilla to add to the recipe.  This is usually one of the favorite salads at holiday time! Very Good!
