I made this as a dip for vegetables. I used reduced fat sour cream and homemade taco seasoning mix. We loved it, especially me. I especially loved dipping cucumbers into it. I will make this again, for sure, but next time I will try it with homemade pickled jalapenos instead of green chile peppers as other reviewers have suggested.

Delicious. Be sure to add 1/2 cup mayo and chopped jalapenos, as other reviewers have suggested. Best if chilled overnight. Big hit!

WOW.  This was the easiest thing ever (no lie - 5 minutes).  Per the advice of other reviewers, I added 1/2 cup mayo and some chopped jalapeno peppers as well.  I also used HOT taco seasoning.  My guests loved it just as much as I did!!  I will make this again and again!

I made this for a cub scout camp out. Everyone loved it. I put in a little bit of jalapeno instead of the chilies. Gave it quite a bit of spice. Had alot of people ask for the recipie. I also put in both the cheddar and monterey jack like previously reccomended. Next time I think I will put the mayo in too to make it a bit creamier. Also I think I will use the chilies instead of the jalapeno. It was also very easy.

This dip went really well.....just a couple of things I might change for next time,,,,I used jalepeno's instead of the green chili's...that was good....I did add mayo and some parmesan cheese, but maybe next time would use chedder plus monterey  jack??  Plus I used one package of regular taco seasoning, and one of the hot seasoning,,,the hot one was too hot for me,,but everyone else liked it...I think next time I will just use the regular seasoning and add tabasco sauce...but all in all,,everyone said it was really addicting and delicious!! I liked that it was so easy- and would probably taste better sitting over night!! Thanks for this recipe!!

At an office get-together at a colleage's summer home, I was the "It" girl - thank you to "Beth" - I may have landed a date with a cutie down the hall. After reading a lot of reviews, I subsitituted the green chilies for jalapenos - very spicy (and sassy). Also, I made it the night before, definitely gelled together well. I've been invited for future parties....

I brought this dip to an office potluck and several people asked for the recipe. Next time I will try some of the other reviewers' suggestions and add jalapenos instead of chilies or hot taco seasoning, and maybe some mayonnaise. It was good as is, but it's always fun to experiment.

My friends loved this recipe.  I tweaked it a little after reading several other reviews.  I used diced jalepanoes instead of the diced chiles.  I used hot taco seasoning instead of mild taco seasoning.  I added about a 1/2cup mayo since the taco seasoning was more than an ounce.  And finally I added a few tablespoons of shredded parmasean.  I made it the night before and served the next day.  This is a hot recipe.  Everyone wanted to know how I made it.

Delicious, everyone always rants and raves when I bring this to potlucks and gatherings. I substitute plain low fat greek yogurt for the sour cream so I don't feel so bad eating half of the bowl by myself. I also omit the green peppers and add sriracha to taste for some kick!

So, so, so good. I followed the advice of other reviews and added the 1/2 cup of mayo. My kids tend to shy away from things too spicy so I stuck with the green chile peppers as the recipe said. We all really liked it. I served it with tortilla chips, but we ended up dipping veggies in it, too. I can see so many possibilities with this. I have some left over that I'm going to use in a black bean burrito. Yummy!! Thanks for sharing. We'll be having this as a regular snack in our home.

I followed a lot of suggestions in the reviews.  I added diced hot jalapenos instead of green chilis, 1/2 cup mayo, only about 2/3 of the taco seasoning packet, and a little tabasco. I also added some extrs shredded pepper cheese.  It was by far the most popular dip at our family reunion.  People where eating it with tortilla chips and fritos scoops as well as using it as a spread on their burgers.

Made this for Superbowl, didn't go over very well at all. The Taco seasoning was WAY too overpowering.

I used this for a wedding reception with good results.  I substituted canned chopped jalepenos and added mayo and parmesan cheese to the recipe for a different texture.  It got rave reviews!

I made the hotter version using chopped jalepenos instead of chile's and hot taco seasoning, and it was a hit even with the tough guys.

Wonderful!  I did this recipe for my sister'd bridal shower (which happened to be held on Cinco de Mayo).  This recipe was a great hit. Everybody wanted to know how I made it and was amazed at how easy it was.  My children loved this dip as well.  Hint: for spicier dip, use diced jalapenos instead of chili!

I have made this recipe as-is on many occasions. It is so quick and easy to make. It is great to add on to my menu if I need just one more small appetizer. It always goes quickly.

Love this dip!  Served it as an appetizer for Christmas and what a hit.  Everybody raved about it.  I did take the suggestion about using jalapenos instead of green chile peppers (1/2 can), using 1/2 pkt taco seasoning mix and adding 1/2 c. mayo.

Delicious! I did add 1/2 cup mayo as suggested by others (I used light sour cream and light mayo), and I used a whole can of chopped green chilis. This came together VERY quickly. I made it the night before to allow the flavors to blend. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

I used this recipe for SuperBowl, it was great.  It was gone before we even started eating.  The only thing I changed, I added salsa to it.  I meant to use jalepeno's as suggested but didn't have any. So I went with the chile peppers and it was good.  Thanks Beth.

I made this for a food day at work, and I think it's a good dip. I got many compliments on it. I am giving it 4 stars because while it tastes great, it doesn't look very appetizing. I also think it could use a little more "zip," but all in all, it was a really easy, quick dip to make and people seem to be enjoying it!

Good and easy, people really liked this dip, and it was so simple!  I only used 2/3 the seasoning, next time I would try 1/2, because the flavor is REALLY strong.

Very good dip! I didn't have any taco seasoning so I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site. It was excellent. I also added 1/2 c. mayo as others suggested. Served with tortilla chips. Will make again very soon!

I made this per the recipe(except that i used "Mexican 4 cheese blend" and tasted prior to refrigerating.  The taco seasoning(I used mild) was a bit too much for me.  After thinking...I decided to add Pace Chunky Salsa(medium).  This improved it texture wise as well as taste wise..in my opinion.  Next time may try the jalapenos.  After refrigerating...tastes even better.  Will be bringing to our tailgate tomorrow.  Hope it's a hit!

I usually give 5 stars to recipes because they always come out as posted.
this one was just plain bad. I don't know what I was thinking when I thought of making it.

I needed a quick and easy dip and this sure fit the bill!!

Threw it together in less than five minutes. Used a 7oz can of diced green chili's instead (afterwards I read the others reviews of adding jalepenos and mayo, and may try that next time for the fun of it). Served it with tortilla chips and fresh veggies.

It was a hit! :)

This is great; I took it to a family get together with chips AND cut veggies, and everyone liked it with the veggies; I took home all the chips!

I also added some chopped red pimento to the top as a garnish, made it look very nice.

Added the jalapenos as suggested, and everyone was commenting on how hot it was!! They really liked it, but I will probably make it without the jalapenos next time and see if it is better. Definitely will be making for my next get-together.

I had offered to bring a layered taco dip to a party this weekend, but didn't end up having time to prepare it so I found this recipe and gave it a whirl... it is soo good!  Quicker, less expensive and easier to prepare than a layered dip- eveyone loved it and gobbled it up!  My family prefers it now!  It will be a staple in my house year 'round!  YUM!

This recipe is excellent.  I will experiment the next time with mayo and jalapeno though just to see how it turns out. A definite favorite in my recipe box!

Great dip recipe -- super alternative to boring salsa and chips!!! My husband -- who is Mexican and picky -- loved it. I've already faxed the printout to 5 friends for their next parties. It's very easy, and I had all the ingredients in the cabinets or in the fridge (a must-situation on Christmas Day, as today is for me). This is a keeper!

This dip was missing something, it was quite bland, even though it was kind of hot.  I don't think I'll use this recipe again.
