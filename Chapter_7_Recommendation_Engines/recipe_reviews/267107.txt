8.7.18  I think I may have sliced my zucchini too thinly.  Next time,  I’ll aim for about 1/8” thickness, so I'll  get more of the zucchini taste.  These were crispy, crunchy good, and the parmesan flavor in the breading really shines through.  Instead of marinara, I served with Sun-Dried Tomato Dip, another good recipe on this site.  Always looking for tasty air fryer recipes, and this one will be added to my collection. Thanks, Nikki, for sharing your recipe.

I am new to air frying, so I followed the recipe as written using the suggestion to cut them 1/8” thick. The zucchini chips  were good and I served them with marinara sauce. By themselves, they were a bit bland since there was only Parmesan and panko. Next time, I will add a some salt and pepper.  I had way more panko mixture than I needed, so will adjust that quantity down or double the amount of zucchini. Perhaps what I think of as a medium zucchini is smaller than the writer’s definition.

11/23/2019 Update:
I instead of salt and pepper, I used an Italian Seasoning blend.  Since it was the kind you grind fresh, I didn’t measure, I just added enough by sight to the panko and Parmesan.  Also, I used the same panko mixture  on boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and the same Italian seasoning and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I then dipped the chicken in egg and dredged it through the panko mixture to cover.  I cooked them in a pre-heater air fryer at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  I flipped them halfway thru to insure even browning on both sides.

This is the first time I have used an air fryer. I wasn't sure I liked the rounds in lieu of the stick cut style so I tried it both ways. It was pretty tasty with Frank's RedHot sauce. The only disappointing thing with the air fryer I have is that I could only cook about 10 at a time. I'd make these again.

This is the only thing I have made in my air fried that I didn't like. Too much cheese in the breading that didn't fall off.

Excellent! I added a pinch of cayenne for an extra pop and cooked for 12 minutes without turning over. We ate them as fast as we made them. Thanks!

I made this as is except added a a few extra minutes at the end for extra crispiness.  We ate them as Super Bowl appetizers. Much better in the air fryer than in the oven.

Loved these! I made some chicken tenders in my air fryer last night, and I had some of the bread crumbs / cheese mixture left over, so I decided to make some of these to use it up! I did use Italian bread crumbs instead of the panko, but other than that, followed the recipe. These are addicting! Didn't have any marinara sauce, but I did have some Chick-fil-A ranch packets in the fridge, which was awesome on these!

It was ok, but too much cheese in my humble opinion.  It was overpowering.

Fabulous, I’ve had these, combined with breaded eggplant rounds, then served with Tsatziki sauce,  Recently the zucchini rounds were served with Marinara sauce.  They are nice and crispy out of the air fryer. I didn’t change a thing.

Great outcome! I used Italian Panko (that's what I had) and added a little water to the egg. Salt and pepper to taste and they were great! I'm sure I'll do these again adding extra spice, or whatever suits the mood! Thank you SLN

I wasted a lot of the breadcrumbs and cheese. Next time I would probably only do half maybe a bit more. I would also add a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper.

If this is to be a healthy alternative to potato chips it works thinly sliced.  Toasted crumbs but no zucchini taste.  After reading reviews I sliced a fresh zucchini from the garden thicker.  But then the crumbs toasted but veggie was undercooked.  So I did them longer and then crisper but  lose zucchini taste or burned.  Not what I was aiming for.

Very good and we liked the idea of serving it with the marinara sauce. I followed the recipe exactly for the first batch. I did not flip and  cook another 2 minutes with the remaining batches as it was cooked just right after the first 10 minutes and flipping it lost quite a few of the bread crumbs and cheese to the bottom of the air fryer.
