Great texture and good base flavor....after cooking I made a honey glaze and broiled it for a couple of minutes...awesome


The comment about the fish sauce is probably because of mis- measuring ...the amount the recipe calls for is a ratio that the taste cannot be detected but, boosts the umami factor only...

I just bought a Sous Vide appliance and was looking for easy yet good recipes.  I made the cauliflower last night and it was so delicious and done perfectly.  The cayenne pepper even though I didn't use a lot just gave this usually pretty bland vegetable quite a good kick, so good.  This recipe is a keeper!

I really liked this dish.  The cauliflower was the perfect texture for me, however, I would have liked more of the flavor of the sauce.  Next time I will double the ingredients other than the cauliflower.  If you are cooking other veggies, this would be a nice accompaniment when using up space in your sous vide cooker.

The texture of the cauliflower was wonderful, but I did not care for the fish sauce.

This dish has potential, but, as bland as cauliflower is, needed a bigger flavor. Perhaps, the amount of seasoning could be increased, as it did not seem to be enough to cover the florets. I think I'll try it again, but think mashed/riced cauliflower might be better suited to carry the flavors.

This recipe is versatile as you can change up the seasoning to suit your taste or meal.  I used 1 1/2 tsp ghee and 2 tsp garam masala to make a simple, yet flavorful side dish.
