Sorry to say but the ingredients for this particular recipe are not the original ingredients for this classic Filipino dish. This recipe had been alternated for personal taste since sake(japanese rice wine) and ginger are not part of this dish. Check out my recipes and you'll know the difference....

This recipie was really not that great. I had a friend who's mother made this all the time and it was to DIE for! I was so excited when I came across this recipie only to be disappointed. It's missing something...not sure of what it could be. But I won't be making this one again.

I was really happy to find this recipe. I lived
in Germany in the early 70's being a servicemens wife I had the oppertunity to have some Phillipino friends that used to make this.
I misplaced the recipe and having been trying to
find it for years.I am going to make it for my Granddaughters first birthday party. Can't wait to have some......Thanks sooooo much for sharing
the recipe with us.....It's AWSOME!

definitely not classic by my Pinoy standards!  my family never uses sake or white wine and it's missing the necessary celery and carrots!
