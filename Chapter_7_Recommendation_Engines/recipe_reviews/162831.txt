Loved it! I used a 9x9 pan, and it was perfect for me. I got 16 bars out of it. Hubby and I ate them ALL that evening. They were so good and so much more healthy, fast, and filling than cookies. I added about 2 T of chia seeds. Totally going to do it again. I can't wait to add variations as the other reviewers have mention. These will be a great hit with the family!

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the ingredients exactly as written, however I put it into a slightly smaller pan which I'm glad I did.  You don't really taste the peanut butter alot - as my PB hating daughter can attest.  Will be adding this to my recipe book.  Might try adding in some pumpkin seeds too.

I added a tsp of vanilla and a tbsp cinnamon.  I thought that it made the peanut butter mixture so so yummy.  However, only 4 stars because I definitely didn't get 20 bars, and the pan size was way too big.

Quick and easy to make.  I used the recommeded 11X7 pan and they came out a bit thin for my liking.  Think I will use a smaller pan next time or double the recipe.

These are fantastic. Can't stop eating them. Must store in the fridge though....or they're too soft.

Delicious. The peanut butter and honey are great with anything you may substitue. I left out the sesame and used crushed cashew and a little coconut. I don't like flax seeds, they stick in your teeth.

Love these.  I had no flax seed so I substituted with sliced Almonds.  Just the perfect snack.  Filling, tasty and so good for you.

Delicious! I added 1/3 cup coconut, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I also coated it with melted semi-sweet chocolate with some shredded coconut and a bit of butter mixed in.  The recipe makes about 1/2 of what it says so either double it or use a smaller pan.  Also, give the flax seeds a quick run through the blender to break them up a bit so you can digest them.

I love this recipe for it's simplicity and adaptability!  A quick, no-cook, healthy snack.  The recipe is great as written, but don't be shy about trying variations.  I've found that it's easy to add mini chocolate chips, or chopped dried fruit, or nuts, or whatever you like... by pressing those toppings into the mixture after you've spread it in the pan.  It's fun to do half-and-half batches this way and in the case of chocolate, this keeps it from melting too much.

I don't mind eating these when they're soft, but agree with other reviewers that keeping them in the fridge improves their texture.  Yum!!!

Shared with co-workers(all women)all enjoyed. Husband not impressed! Husbands buddy and wife very impressed!-only downside-not for peanut allergy. I may try some without peanut butter.

The bars were way to soft for me. If you held one on it's own it definitely wouldn't hold it's form. I used a 9x9 pan, couldn't even imagine using an 11x7 as noted - they'd practically be paper thin! Also, the sesame seeds are very powering.
