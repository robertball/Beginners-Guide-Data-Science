I added a teaspoon of dried lemon zest, other than that I stuck to the recipe. Right before baking, I sprinkled a little sugar over each muffin mound. I did get 12 BIG muffins out of one recipe instead of one big loaf. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at 23 minutes. VERY good. My muffins didn't rise very much, next time I make this I would add a teaspoon of baking powder maybe.

2.19.13.   I did toss my blueberries in some flour before adding to the batter which always helps in getting them evenly distributed instead of all dropping to the bottom of the loaf.  Followed this recipe to the letter, and it was very moist and tender with juicy bites of blueberries.  Very nice, thanks for sharing your recipe STILLSWEET43.  ****3.9.16   Family coming for a visit this weekend, so I baked this recipe into muffins.  Made BIG muffins (got 12) and baked for 23 minutes @ 350.  Just as delicious as the banana bread loaf I first made.  Have one breakfast out of the way now   :-) ****UPDATE 5.9.18:   I had 3 smallish very ripe bananas that were either going to be used today or heading out with the trash tomorrow.  Used all 3, and decided to try to lighten this recipe (although nutritionally it’s really not bad the way it’s written), so sub’d Truvia Baking Blend for the sugar, Egg Beaters for eggs, margarine for the butter, and sprinkled some organic coconut sugar on the top before baking.  They don’t look as nice as others I’ve made using this recipe, but they still tasted awesome.  So I guess that means I can eat two, instead of one???

I only made a couple of changes to this recipe.  The first one was because of necessity.  I doubled the batch and ran out of butter and had to substitute canola oil.  The second change was due to taste.  After the whole process, I tasted the batter, and wanted more blueberry, so I added an additional cup, making the total 3 c. for the double batch (btw, all I had were frozen blueberries, so that’s what I used – which accounts for the blue/purple color of my loaves).  The only other change was that I made regular size loaves instead of mini ones.  The batter tasted so good I could have eaten it all raw, and would have too, if it weren’t for the 4 raw eggs in there (well, maybe I wouldn’t have eaten it ALL, but I would have certainly eaten my share!)  Because I made regular size loaves, it took about 20 extra minutes to bake, making the total bake time 45 minutes.  They came out looking luscious golden brown, with the delicious crispy/chewy crust I love, moist in the middle, and just yummy  through and through!  When I woke up the day after making it, my family had devoured one whole loaf, and were all raving about how great it was.

Made the recipe as listed but made them into mini muffins instead. I sprayed my pampered chef mini muffin pan and filled them to the top. Before I baked them, I added a topping mixture of 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Baked for 15 mins and they turned out perfectly! The kids loved them!!

This is a delicious, tender banana bread. I did not add baking powder & it rose nicely.  The bread is light & not dense @ all. The 3 small loaves are apparently the mini-loaf size.  I made one 8" loaf & one mini loaf. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon & about 1/4 tsp nutmeg & some toasted walnuts b/c I love those in sweet bread. I'm not sure how long I baked the 8" loaf since I didn't time it.  I think around 50 min.  I will definitely make this again.  The subtle tartness of the blueberries & the sweet bread are a wonderful contrast.

I lost my prized banana bread recipe, so jumped on Allrecipes.com to see what I could find. I *just* made this and it is still piping hot!  Melt-in-your-mouth divine..... I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten free baking flour, and it turned out beautifully. I used two 8"x 3+7/8" aluminum baking pans (store bought) so I can take these to a social gathering. Obviously one won't make it there ;)  Worked out perfectly!  Baked both together for about 50-55 minutes. (Rotated pans  halfway through so they would bake evenly).  Followed the recipe as written, although did sub 3/4 c. brown sugar for the white sugar.  Did not need additional rising agent. I did add a topping: mixed 5 TBSP. brown sugar, 2 TBSP. flour, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon together, then cut in 1 TBSP. butter until crumbly. Sprinkled over the top and baked.  Next time I may add cinnamon to the batter.  Would also prefer more blueberries, but this was yummy! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Stillsweet43!

I love this recipe!  The bread is very moist.  I had to use frozen blueberries in it, but it didn't make a difference.  It was still delicious.  I followed this recipe exactly, except for adding 3 bananas instead of 2 (I happen to have 3 that needed to be used).  Mine did take longer than 35 minutes to bake though - at least 45 minutes.

This recipe was great! Excellent jumping off point. I used 4 bananas instead of 2 and about 3 cups of blueberries instead of 1. Also, instead of making a loaf of bread I baked mine in a 9x13 pan. I made my recipe vegan by using egg substitute (Whole Foods, $7) in place of eggs, and organic margarine in place of butter. Lastly, I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose white flour.

These were very, very good-a nice surprise!  I had some bananas and blueberries to use up so searched and came across this recipe.  Made them into muffins.  Got 12 good sized muffins....filled them pretty much to the top of the paper liners. Baked for 23 minutes.  They rose a bit and were nicely golden. Used 3 small very ripe bananas, added 1/2 tsp. baking powder to have a bit of a rise and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as I like it with both bananas and blueberry in baking.  It was subtle and not overpowering.  The other flavors shone through. They were tender and yummy.  I will definitely make them again.  Hubby will love them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE:I have made these again and made them dairy free for son with intolerance.  For a DOUBLE BATCH/RECIPE I used 1/2 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of butter, used 5 bananas, added 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  The 23 minute time is perfect.  They were still delicious and moist....family love them and so do I!!

So I must preface by saying that I'm not a huge fan of banana bread but my husband is and I had ripe bananas to use. That said...this recipe is great! I did make some changes based on other reviews... used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce (next time will use only applesauce as I normally make this sub for butter/oil), added 1tsp cinnamon, doubled the blueberries (you definitely want to do this!), and used 3/4 cup sugar (mixture of brown and white sugar--might cut back more next time). 
I made 12 regular muffins & 9 mini muffins (baked 20 & 12 minutes respectively). 
My 2 yo and I ate 4 minis before they cooled & had blueberry juice all over our hands...so good! Good mix of both banana and blueberry flavors and just the right amount of sweet for us.

The taste was great! I used frozen blueberries and it was delicious. Because I do not have loaf pans I used a medium  spring-form pan and followed Diane's advice and baked it for 35 minutes. Then I covered it with foil and baked it for another 15 minutes for a total of 50 minutes.

This was excellent! I was able to make  two standard size loaves by multiplying the recipe by 1.5. Because I had two cups of blueberries, I threw them all in and baked the loaves for 60 minutes. Yummy!

It's blueberry season here in Michigan and I wanted a recipe to use some of the large, flavorful berries I recently picked.  I had a banana that was overly ripe so this recipe was perfect.  This bread is moist and flavorful made exactly like the recipe is written.  Because my blueberries were so large, I had strong blueberry flavor throughout.  I would make this again, whenever I have blueberries that need to be used up.

I made this tonight, only a few deviations; I added a little bit of cinnamon and doubled the blueberries. To avoid too much moisture from the berries I tossed them in a baggie of flour as that always makes them hold together. I was told this is my best banana bread yet. Thanks!

Loved this banana bread.  It could have been made into something fancier with added cinnamon/brown sugar topping, or a bit of lemon zest, but I wanted this to be a banana bread-and it was delicious.  I did add 2 cups instead of 1 cup blueberries.

This bread is delicious!  I had bananas and frozen blueberries to use so this recipe fit the bill.  I tossed the frozen blueberries in a little bit of flour so they spread evenly and didn't sink to the bottom.  I used a 6 cup mini bundt pan and baked them for 25 min.  They turned out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! Just made it for myself! I followed the recipe, but I didn't have 3 small loaf pans so I made it in a big one, and all the batter fit perfectly. It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to cook using the big pan though, so just heads up if you do that. Also, next time I make it I will probably add more blueberries, it didn't seem like there was enough.

Baked exactly as the recipe lists aside from dredging the berries in flour and using a full sized loaf and OMG delicious. For the large loaf in a glass pan, I put it on a cookie sheet and baked at 350 for 35 min. Then I covered it with a piece of foil and baked another 30 min. It turned out perfect!!!

Very moist and delicious! I'm not sure what the author meant by "small" loaf pans, however. I doubled the recipe and used 4 loaf pans that are 8X3, 2.5" deep. I added a teaspoon of baking powder to the double recipe and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I crushed about 1/2 cup of blueberries with the bananas (to spread the blueberry flavor throughout the loaves) and then tossed the 2 cups of blueberries with flour to keep them from sinking, as another reviewer suggested.

I made this on a hot summer 's day when I had to use up my frozen bananas because I was getting a new fridge. I  added 1/2 cup of plain yogurt,another 2 eggs,  an extra tsp of baking soda, and a cup of whole wheat flour, as well as 2 more bananas. I halved the amount of sugar and salt. I also added chopped pecans. I baked it in my gas bbq for an hour at about 375. I did not have a brick to bake on, so just used an overturned stoneware dish. Turned out fantastic.

Two days before I made this I had picked fresh blueberries from a local farmer. I don't know if this made a difference or not, but this recipe turned out super yummy! I ended up replacing some of the flour with oatmeal to make it more hearty, and added a bit of sour cream to ensure moistness. I can't stop eating it! I'm definitely making this one again.

Update: I forgot to mention that I ended up putting some of the batter in my Pampered Chef individual brownie pan and each individual thing was a piece of heaven. I gave a thingy to a couple of friends of mine and they loved it. My husband and son keep asking me when I'm going to make it again.

I made a few changes based on our tastes.  This is a great recipe without my changes.  I used 1/2c organic sugar and 1/2 c. Organic brown sugar.  I added  chopped pecans and a little cinnamon.  It baked about 10 minutes longer because I used frozen blueberries.  The blueberry banana combo is wonderful.

I won't even make banana bread without the blueberries in it anymore. I was skeptical at first but it was AMAZING! My kids love it to so that was a plus!

I added a bit of baking powder, and they rose nicely.  Might have otherwise, but I wanted to be sure.

Made them as muffins then took 'em to church; they were a huge hit.  I made half with the blueberries and half with walnuts (half cup each).  I think this is the first week that I had no leftovers!  Next time I should make another half batch so I get to try them!

Very good! The only things I did different were I used 2 cups frozen blueberries, and made muffins instead of loaves, and sprinkled the tops with raw sugar before baking. They turned green because of the frozen blueberries, but they taste good. It made 18 small muffins (cupcake size, not mini) and I baked them for 22 minutes. Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I will make these again. Basic muffins, nothing fancy. Not too sweet, perfect for breakfast Had all the ingredients on hand. Im always looking for ways to use bananas that are over ripe!

Very light and moist. I used brown sugar instead of white and doubled the blueberries. My fiancé and I enjoyed this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

I used a few pointers from other reviewers (cut back on total sugar and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white) and added a shake of cinnamon (both for health benefits and banana friendly flavor enhancement) but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Good thing I checked for doneness - my small loaf pans only needed 23-24 minutes to be baked thoroughly.  We liked the flavor but found the bread to be on the dry side . . if I make it again I think I'll increase the amount of butter or add a dollop of sour cream for extra moisture.

Made this recipe several times, added walnuts for a little crunch. One of my husbands favorites.

Update:  I made this again today. Halfway through I realized we were out of sugar so I used maple syrup instead. Used 3/4 cup syrup instead of 1 cup sugar. The loaf turned out great! It’s nice to find a recipe that is so forgiving with substitutions.

Made it gluten free and less sugary for health-conscious Korean  parents.   Loved it!  Made with sweet rice flour mix from Betty crocker, with half the sugar using brown sugar rather than white, & with 3-1/2 ripe bananas (they were medium-sized).  Used coconut oil to grease one regular sized bread pan and 3 mini muffin pans.  Yum !

These turned out delicious. I made them as muffins and altered the recipe slightly. I subbed half of the flour for  partially ground whole oats and added a 1/4 cup ground flaxseeds seeds and walnuts. Also, I subbed part of the sugar with a low calorie substitute.

Scrumptious!  I used a pint of frozen blueberries & substituted half the butter with applesauce.  Made into muffins and baked at 350 for 23 minutes.  These came out wonderfully!  They weren't dense like my usual banana bread but very light.  I did what several mentioned and just dredged the berries in a bit of flour before adding them, and they didnt sink to the bottom.  Fantastic recipe!

I used one large loaf pan and baked for 65 minutes. I doubled the blueberries and tossed them in some of the flour before adding them to the batter. They were dispersed evenly throughout the bread and I could definitely taste both the bananas and blueberries. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, using white and brown sugar, and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. My husband loves this bread.

Good, but the taste of blueberries aren't strong enough.  The banana overpowers the flavour of them.

I gave this 4 stars because I added a few ingredients but great base recipe.  I added a few dashes of cinnamon and ground nutmeg.  Also added 3/4teaspoon of baking powder.  I didn't have the mini loaf pans so I made 17 regular sized muffins.  Baked at 350° for 23-28 minutes.  Perfect.

Yields a very nice, moist, large loaf. Next time I will add 2 or 3 cups of blueberries because the banana flavor dominates. Thank you for the recipe!

Recipe turned out great! I did some healthy alternatives to it. I used same amounts of wheat flour,stevia instead of regular sugar and used less Himalayan salt than regular salt. It turned out great!I added some pecans and I did add 1 more banana as what a previous person stated in suggestions!Thank for a great recipe!

I added an extra banana, but other than that, used this recipe to the T and loved it. I was worried when the batter was really thick, but it came out great.  It didn't rise as much as other breads I've made, but maybe my baking soda was old?? It didn't effect the taste, though.  I doubled the recipe and got 23 small/med sized muffins and two small loaves.  I usually stick to my mom's banana bread recipe - everyone says its awesome - but I would make this any time.

Made these as muffins also. Baked for 25 min. Had batter for 14, so 12 were quite large.  Liked the consistency and the ease of the recipe . Had to use up both bananas and blueberries so I thought I would give it a try.  While this is good and made a lovely looking muffin my taste buds battled over the Blueberry  vs. Banana flavor. I do not see how people think these flavors go together.  Likely just me, but I didn't like the flavor battle!

Made these as 12 nice size muffins, and they turned out great at 23 min.  I did add the baking powder and they rose well. Also took another reviewer's advice and rolled the blueberries around in a bowl with a think layer of flour in it.  Supposedly this helps keep them from sinking to the bottom.  All I can say is, the blueberries did not sink. :)

Really good! I used @ 1.5 cups white whole wheat and .5 cups all purpose, and subbed brown sugar for white because that was all I had. And I added 1 tsp baking powder. I am in the process of moving...all my loaf pans are packed (also why I had so many substitutions) so I used one 8x8 metal cake pan. I was pretty nervous because the batter was so thick, but it turned out great! Sort of coffee cake like. I'm adding this to my favorites. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe but added a teaspoon of baking powder and a little bit of sour cream. I put it all into a mini muffin pan and baked for 20 minutes. I also sprinkled the top with a little bit of sugar before baking. YUMMY!

This was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to sub brown sugar for white, though I think it didn't fluff up as much because of that.  End result was still good enough that a couple hours after it came out of the oven it's almost all gone!

This recipe is fantastic. I personally like it better with three bananas instead of two.

I have made this recipe 5 times so far, including halving the recipe so I can add Splenda for two diabetic friends. Not sure how those will turn out as they are just now in the oven. So far they look great. As far as I’m concerned this is my go-to recipe. I love it because I don’t need to keep baking powder around (which I don’t use), the recipe is simple, the bread is moist and delish!! Sorry, I didn’t use blueberries. But I did cut up some fresh pecans my hub was an angel to shell for me. Seriously awesome!! I will review again when I hear from my diabetic friends.

So I altered the recipe a bit. First off, I used stevia instead of sugar (a little less than a cup). I also used about 2 and a half bananas because I wanted the flavor to really come through. Then, I followed Sarah Jo's suggestion and used a muffin tin at 350 for 22ish minutes. My muffins were small but tasty. Next time, I'll try substituting half of the flour with oats and maybe some of the butter with coconut oil. My goal is to make an almost completely healthy muffin that's also tasty.

it's still cooking but the smell alone is divine!  I added 1/4 cinnamon and also decided to split the batter - loaf with blueberries and muffins without blueberries

This was my first time making any kind of banana bread and it turned out awesome! I was nervous because of the way it looked after adding the banana but once I started adding the flour mixture, it looked normal again. Lol. Really good recipe...

I  used this recipe to create bite size muffins.  I shortened the baking time due to the smaller size.   They turned out moist and sweet little bites.   Will make again.

I took the advice of using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Made it so tasty! I don't think I can ever make banana bread without blueberries now. They add just a bit of tartness that is delightful.

I have made twice with a few changes and it came out great!  I substituted 1\2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. I also made a chocolate chip, white chocolate chip pecan crunch topping. My family really enjoyed.

Whoa! Definitely will make again! Changes were: 3 bananas, not 2. Used 9" glass bread baker, which required 1 hour 15 minutes at 325 degrees in a convection oven. No blueberries so substituted 1 cup chopped walnuts.

Excellent recipe! I made the following modifications: 
- I used ripe bananas that had been previously frozen and when they defrost there is juice so I used some of that to add more banana flavor. 
- Added in chopped walnuts
- Made 12 muffins instead of a loaf and baked about 25 min They were so moist and flavorful!

I followed the recipe except added 1tbs of flower (high altitude) and used one large glass loaf pan, baked for an hour and 20 mins.  I coated the blueberries in flour but they still sunk to the bottom.  It was still yum!

great!! Loved the addition of blueberries & vanilla to my banana bread. I used 3 bananas, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and butter to 1/4 cup and it turned out perfect!

This banana bread was fantastic, even though I made a couple  changes. I used a cup of applesauce rather than the butter, only 3/4 c sugar (half brown sugar, half coconut sugar, and I threw in extra blueberries, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Baked one loaf for about 55 minutes and it came out perfect!

First time using Bob's Red Mill 1:1, very pleased with the results. If anything, batter was a bit thick, but baked very well.

Added chopped walnuts, cinnamon and nutmeg

Made half the batch into a loaf and half into mini muffins

Turned out very tasty!

Love this recipe! I have made this many times now and generally follow the recipe as written, with only minor updates as I do not have mini loaf pans. I scale the recipe by 1.5 to make two standard loaves. I generally add an extra banana as well (total of 4 for the 1.5 size batch). I also like to use 1/2 whole wheat flour to sub for some white flour (a standard substitute I make in quick breads). My husband loves this topped with peanut butter for a quick breakfast - tastes like pb & j! So good we also have as a dessert sometimes.

This is a very good recipe! I did not like that the batter is so thick, but the bread turned out very moist and not dense like I expected! I made 12 loaves for Christmas gifts for my neighbors! We love this bread! Too early to hear from the neighbors!!

I am at friends, I can't stand not cooking. Okay, i did a few things differently...i microwaved butter and sugar to mix, then followed directions...accept i only had one bowl and had mixed flour and step 1 in it. I pushed to side, added the butter, bananas mixture and just slowly let mixer add in flour...no problem. I doubled berries with 2 cupsish frozen, and baked in a big oval pirex dish. Could be his oven, but it took 1 hr and 10 minutes, but it came out amazing. I will use it for gormet french toast in morning! Killer recipe!

Love this recipe! Sometimes I substitute the blueberries with chocolate chips. Great for a snack or for breakfast. I will say it always takes more than 35 to cook. I usually have to cook it over an hour but I think it is just my very wide bread pan.

Ok, I know it might sound weird to add blueberries to banana bread (I don’t even like blueberries) but this stuff is amazing and it’s the only kind of banana bread I make anymore! I just stock up on blueberries when they’re on sale and then wash, dry and freeze them to keep them on hand. The recipe is for 3 small loaves but I’ve found that I can do one large and one small without a problem (or double it to make 3 large loaves. They also freeze well without a problem. So good!

Made this today and it was EXCELLENT!!!

I did make a couple of adjustments otherwise I stuck to the recipe.

I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder; 4 bananas; and ½ cup apple sauce.  because I used a bundt pan, it took 60 minutes in the oven.

I topped the cake with a lemon glaze.

It definitely needs to cook longer than 30 minutes. I think I ended up going nearly 45 minutes and it probably could have gone a bit longer, but I was afraid I was already overcooking it. It didn't rise as much as I would have liked either so I'll probably add baking powder too next time. Lastly, make sure you take some of the flour and coat the blueberries while a bit wet otherwise they're gonna fall tot he bottom of the bread. With all of that said, it tastes amazing. I'll make it again with some tweaks.

The only reason I did not give this four stars is because they only say "small loaf pans" with no dimensions.  I made it in a standard glass loaf pan and it took 45 minutes and still was not totally cooked in the top center.  That said...it was a HUGE hit in my household.  My grandson ate 1/2 loaf all by himself and asks me every day if I made more yet. VERY tasty...VERY easy

I just made this recipe into muffins using two overly ripe bananas and a cup and half of blueberries that  were a little past their prime, and Wow!  Perfect!  Delicate flavor, delicate texture, and very pretty.  I made the mistake of adding a 1/2 teaspoon of  baking powder.  You don't need it.  Baked in middle of the oven for 23 minutes.

Delicious! I made 2 changes— first I added 1 1/2 cup of blueberries, then I added 1 tsp.vanilla extract & 1 tsp. almond extract instead of 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.

I did add another half cup of blueberries, really like the recipe but finding a balance between the blueberries and bananas is a challenge. Think it requires another experiment. Very moist and nice crumb. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this slightly healthier by only putting one cup of flour and one cup of oats. I also only put Half a cup of sugar and not quite a half cup of butter. I also didn’t have vanilla extract and just put a tablespoon of honey instead. They came out delicious!

I followed the directions with no substitutions. I used two loaf pans, and my bread was a little small. One loaf pan next time would be perfect.  The bread was moist and delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

Made with frozen chopped bananas, pinch of nutmeg, a little cinnamon, and toasted chopped walnuts. Made two medium loafs. Finished with whole walnuts. (Blueberries were tossed in flour) sent on a fishing bachelor weekend; smelled amazing!

I have a ton of blueberries & some brown bananas so this recipe definitely fit the bill. I realized after I'd mashed the bananas & creamed the butter & sugar that I only had gluten-free flour (Bob's Red Mill) and I was out of vanilla extract (...the joys of just having moved :p ...) but I did have limes, so I added the zest of one lime to the flour mixture and the juice after I added the mashed bananas. I wanted muffins, so I baked them at 350F for 21 minutes and they came out perfect!!! Moist, fluffy, so tasty. I'll probably add a little more lime zest because I like the tartness with the sweetness of the bananas. I will definitely be making these again!

Easy, moist, delicious!  Definitely add a dash of nutmeg, though, for depth of flavor.  Might add lemon zest next time, too for a little tartness.

I did not change a thing on this recipe. well I had dried blueberries, but they are still really good. This recipe is a keeper. I shared a picture and 2 of the mini muffins are already missing not 5 minutes out of the toaster oven. I even kept the times and temps pretty much the same. Just keep an eye on them twords the end. Happy baking!

I made into one big loaf pan, so taking about 15 minutes longer to cook. Covered it after 35. Added some white chocolate chips (about 2/3 c) to make it more of a dessert cake. Tastes fabulous. Great recipe!

I made this in one loaf pan and baked for 50 minutes, then turned off the oven, cracked the oven door, and let it sit for about 10 more minutes before pulling it out.  

Pro: This bread is delicious!  

Con: It takes about 30 mins prep time, not 15.  Or else I'm just slow.

Instead of blueberries, I added fresh cranberries and chopped pecans.  It was marvelous.  The cranberries really add a tangy zing that is wonderful.

This  banana bread turned out perfect.  I made four mini loaves and fed three to the neighbors, that way I don't get fat!  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of baking  powder out of concerns in other reviews about the bread rising, but I don't know that it made any difference.  And it took an additional  ten minutes to bake.  I wouldn't add cinnamon as some suggest - it would turn this bread into something else.  Very tastee!

This turned out very well, nice and moist.  Made using avocado oil instead of butter and mixed with a fork instead of beaters and as others suggested added 1 t baking powder for increased rise.  26 min at 350 for 12 large muffins sprayed with Pam.

The only change I made was to cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. This bread was moist, but not too moist, and delicious.

Didn't make any changes.  Used blueberries on their last leg  and the old banana and it turned out fantastic.  Used a large loaf pan and baked it for about 50 minutes.  I let it cool most of the way and then wrapped it in saran wrap and foil.  Super moist.

Followed the recipe and the bread turned out delicious. I used frozen blueberries and that worked well. Next time I would add more banana & berries for more flavor.

This recipe is great I added a cup of walnuts to it and it came out amazing. I had to bake it for a lot longer then the directions said closer to an hour and fifteen minutes or so I lost track of my 10 minute intervals of checking

Oh my gosh good......so buttery and flavorful.  I did 2 loaves and did a batch in 2 round cake pans. I am thinking of filling the middle with whipped cream.  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe. Cut the sugar in half to 1/2 a cup instead of 1 full cup because I'm watching my sugar intake. Made 12 muffins. Followed other reviewers instruction 350 degrees for 23 minutes and worked well. Cutting the sugar surely had an effect on the overall taste, but it works for me.

This was a great way to use up my bananas and blueberries; because I'm diabetic, I used coconut vs. white sugar, and no one could tell the difference. Other than the sugar change, I kept everything the same, and it was good. I doubled the recipe and made muffins instead of loaves, and it yielded 24 big muffins. I used a cookie scoop to put it into the paper lined wells and filled it to the top. I used fresh blueberries, so I didn't have the problem of the berries sinking to the bottom. My batter was stiff, so I just pushed in more berries prior to baking. Very moist, and the blueberries were really juicy. Thank you for sharing!

This was great! Very sweet and moist. I used a frozen berry mix (defrosted) and the raspberries worked the best with the dough, since the taste stayed the best and wasn't overpowering. Over all, a great recipe, especially with that modification!

I added an extra banana only because the bananas I was using were small.  The bananas were also very ripe which sweetened it up nicely.  Lastly, I made muffins (18 standard size muffins) and baked them for 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  Saying my family enjoyed the muffins would be an understatement. My family wolfed them down like they'd never seen food before. We went from 18 muffins to 10 in less than 20 minutes. I, on the other hand, thought they were good but not the best I'd ever had. I think next time I would use a teaspoon of lemon zest as suggested by another reviewer to jazz up the flavor.

I should've read the reviews before I put the batter in pans. I suspect that the TWO pans with not much more than a smear of batter in each may be a bit dry. Hope not. It would've been nice if the recipe had specified the loaf pan size exactly.
8 x 4 x 2 1/2 in. is considered "small". I don't think the batter would even fill three of these.
After baking (checking and baking, checking and baking because the time wasn't right), and cooling the flavor IS very good. I used about 3/4 cup sugar and everything else as written. Definitely a nice buttery flavor that can stand not adding butter after it's baked.

This is a very moist bread! I used 1.5 bananas and 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries. I also cut the sugar in half because I don't like my desserts too sweet. I baked it in a single loaf pan for 40 min. Came out delicious!! It was a perfect balance of banana and blueberry flavors.

I scaled this recipe to 37 servings as I had 5 bananas to use up. I used RH Omega 3 flour with flax for the all purpose. The leavening amount of baking soda is off as it is 1/4 tsp per cup of flour, I reduced it accordingly.  Omitted the salt. Reduced butter by 1/2, used fat free sour cream for the amount. Reduced the sugar by 1/2 and used brown sugar. Used frozen blueberries that I had left from last summer. Baked 425 for 5 minutes, then 350 for 15 minutes, perfectly domed and tasty muffins! Made 31 muffins using my large scoop.

I made this Blueberry and Banana recipe and is really good as it is moist and yummy. My busband loved it and I took some in work and my colleagues loved it too. I've made banana bread before but I now prefer this one as the addition of blueberries makes it more delicious and the flavours of the two fruit go well together. I didn't make any changes as I think for me it's perfect as it is!

I added an extra banana, and crushed 1/2 cup of bluberries and added 1 additional cup of bluberries.  The blueberries were also frozen which I threw in microwave for about 30 sec just til they softened up and covered in flour (not the crushed).  I ended up using 4 small foil tins cause it was need and had to bake for 40 min.

DELICIOUS recipe!  I normally add 3 bananas because it comes out more moist and also add extra (1 pint) blueberries. I like making the muffins because they are easier to grab and go, especially for the little ones.  My kids love this recipe, they always want more.  I will continue to make them over and over, thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

The only thing I did differently was used half brown sugar and half white and I added walnuts! This was wonderful and will absolutely make it again!

This bread was so good, we ate a whole loaf of it in one day!  I had about 9 ripe bananas, so I quadrupled the recipe and added 18 oz of blueberries.  I also added walnuts as I like nuts in my quick breads.  I will be making this again!  I also made it in medium sized pans and baked for 60 minutes.

Great flavor! I even cut the sugar in half. Toddler loves it. He's eaten 1/2 of a loaf in one sitting lol. I ended up doubling it and using 2 large loaf pans. Cooked for 50 minutes and it was great!

Followed directions except used 3 small bananas and a cup and a half of blueberries, sprinkled with 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2tsp cinnamon mix. Made 12 large muffins. This one's a keeper!

I made a loaf of this bread, and it was so good. I added a Streusel topping, and pressed halved banana slices into the top of the batter before cooking. 

For some reason the bread took much longer then stated in the recipe, but I think that may be due to my oven's thermometer. I think it might be time to replace that old thing.

This was wonderful and easy to follow!
My personal preference was using four over ripe bananas two teaspoons vanilla extract. I did this blueberry version and also a strawberry version.

I had a bunch of fresh blueberries and some overripe bananas, and decided to make this recipe into mini muffins. They were good, but not quite as moist as I was hoping. The kids liked them the first day, but the second day they were pretty dry.

Anyone who says this recipe is bad is crazy. I followed it to a t, except adding an additional banana because two didn't seem like a whole lot, and it turned out fabulously. I can taste the blueberries just fine, and the banana, plus it's not overly sweet. I loved it!

I took someone's advice and made 12 muffins by scooping into  muffin pan and baking 23 minutes. Also tossing blueberries in flour before folding in.

***UPDATE
I used frozen berries, coconut oil instead of butter and Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All purpose flour. I lowered the temperature to 300 after 23 minutes and cooked another 7-10 minutes. I think the berries were too cold when I folded them in, but  in the end, the muffins were delicious!

I believe that you should rate the recipe as is and as is all five stars. I usually do have coconut oil have butter. I do half white sugar half brown sugar. I usually double the recipe and use a total of 5 bananas. Then I split the batter into two equal Bowl and put blueberries in one half and pitted cherries in the other. Sometimes I put a crumble on top and sometimes I don't comma it's a really good recipe no matter what you do with it.

I loved this bread! Added cinnamon to the flour and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the bread before placing it in the oven. Kept everything else the same.

Enjoyed the bread made some changes, instead of all purpose flour i made it with wheat flour. Seemed a bit dry, not sure if i needed to add the same amount of flour to the recipe or not. But the bread is good. I put 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cub brown sugar great balance. Be blessed. :)

just a preference, but I like recipes that use butter instead of oil.  I made into muffins (easier to reheat for breakfast), and they were moist and good-- the more blueberries the better!
  I did use less sugar, to be healthier.

Was a wintery day and got to baking,  had banana's In the frig and found this recipe,  I used frozen blueberries I unthawed to semi frozen/thawed state about 1 1/2 cups,  otherwise  followed directions to the "T" .  I sprinkled brown sugar all over the top of both bread pans.  After it was done baking, let cool a bit and gave my husband a plate of warm bread.  He came up from his work bench in basement and immediately had another piece with a big smile on his face.  Very moist and tasty!

I made this recipe today as written with the addition of 1 cup chopped walnuts. To bake, I used mini muffin pan. Made 24 mini and 3 regular muffins. I baked the mini muffins for 15 minutes at 360 and the regular muffins 360 for  22 minutes. 
Wonderful

Really good!! Very versatile recipe. Subbed half the butter with applesauce. Melted the butter and added it to the wet ingredients along with the sugar instead of creaming the butter and sugar. I used 3 medium ripe bananas instead of 2. Added 1/2 tsp baking powder since other reviewers commented their bread didn't rise. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Finally, like other reviewers , I used 2 cups frozen blueberries and coated them with a bit of the dry ingredients so that I didn't use any excess flour in the recipe. Very good!!! Baked 4/5ths of the batter in a loaf pan (lined bottom only with parchment, no butter on sides) and made 3 muffins with rest of batter (I was making some testers!). Baked at 350 for about 1 hour, 10 min. Rose beautifully, wasn't too sweet, nice crumb and was golden brown.

Have made it twice now. So good. Followed the recipe closely except used three bananas and a little more blueberries than called for. First time I used frozen blueberries which worked fine except that it took quite a bit more time to cook (45-50 mins). Put it all in one 9-inch square pan instead of loaves - that could have contributed to the additional baking time as well.

Perfect Banana bread! I've made this a few times and my whole family loves it. I use frozen bluberries and it is great! I've made it once without the bueberries and it was still good. But the blueberries make it so much better!

I didn't try to make changes, but not all my bananas  were real "ripe", so I used 2 ripe and one fresh ( so I did change the 2 bananas to 3 mainly because they were so small.  I also did take a couple of suggestions from other reviewers .  I put in some fresh lemon zest, just a 1/4 tsp and I coated my blueberries in flour before adding to the batter... WOW I wish I had learned that trick years ago.  But even if I hadn't done these things this is a great recipe.  I loved it and my husband, who was a chef for 15 years, loved it stating  that the balance between the bananas and blueberries flavor was very well done. (I almost fell over).  Thanks to all for sharing.
Oh and by the way, tomorrow will be the second time I have baked this bread within the last 5 weeks.  This is now a part of my recipe box and the only type of blueberry bread I will be baking from now on.

Very delicious and moist. Baked in regular loaf pan and covered with foil halfway through to prevent bread getting too brown. Also added 1 and a half cups of blueberries and a half a teaspoon off lemon zest next time I will add a whole teaspoon.I used a half cup of whole wheat flour next time I will try using half white and half whole wheat.

good, but not as sweet as I like my breads, so I'd add some brown sugar next time. I also added both baking soda and baking powder to help it rise. I did loaf pan for about 60 minutes instead of 3 mini loaf pans

I am not a huge fan of Banana Bread, so I was looking for an alternative. This is so yummy!  I did take the advice of some other reviews and add some cinnamon and nutmeg. I also used an extra cup of blueberries. This will be my go-to for left over bananas.  Thanks for a great recipe.

*Making this a second time. Used a whole bag of frozen blueberries. I floured them and put them into the dough.. it chilled everything fairly quickly. Might be best to thaw them slightly next time. Also tried some Pumpkin Pie Spice this time.   Can't wait to eat it!!!

Comes out perfect!
Key notes: lower your oven by 20F if using dark pan
I used cupcake pan, so decrease cooking time to 25 mins.
It's softer and more moist than a blueberry muffin so I'll make more of it for breakfast!

Doubled the recipe but added 5 bananas and 2.5 cups of blueberries. I made muffins and baked for 20-23 minutes then let them sit in the pan for 10. Delicious!

Very disappointed – love banana bread & was excited at the thought of adding blueberries to it.  However, I did not like the combination.  I followed the recipe, except that I added three bananas instead of two and, as some reviewers recommended, dredged the blueberries in flour to try to prevent them from sinking.  I ended up throwing out more than half the loaf – very uncharacteristic of me.  My friend who sampled the loaf agreed that she like straightforward banana bread better.  In the future, am going to try plain blueberry bread and stick to my banana bread recipe.

Killer recipe. If you use this to make a bread, I highly recommend adding a banana/blueberry purée sprinkled with some powered sugar on top down the middle. Super bonus feature.

I made it exactly as the recipe says, yet I added one more cup of blueberries. If you have the opportunity to use fresh blueberries it makes all the difference in the world.

I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  You want to use ripe bananas,but not overripe or else it will overpower the blueberries.  I also sprinkled a little sugar on top before cooking to give the crust some crunch.  I baked it in large loaf pan for about 50 minutes. It was yummy! I am getting ready to make it again tonight.

I used muffin tins lined with paper cups. It made 15 good sized muffins. Had three bananas so used them all and increased blueberries to 1&1/2 cups (frozen). Sprinkled a mix of brown sugar, cinnamon & nutmeg on muffins before baking. Gives a nice crunch and a bit of sweetness.

The muffins sweet & softness come out perfect. The only thing that made it a 4 star was the mix of blueberry and banana. I think I will add some toasted pecans instead next time.

I've made this 4 times now, it's very moist..I did make one change, I used Vegetable Oil instead of Butter..everything else is the same.  I put  my ''ripe banana's'' in the freezer, skins & all, then defrost as needed & use ''frozen blueberries'' too ...I pour the batter into (2)  8"x4" pans & bake.. It comes out PERFECT everytime!! I freeze the loaves & I give them out as ''gifts'' at Christmas time.. Everyone loves it!

Yum! Crisp outside, soft inside. Made a few changes because of what I had on hand: 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of butter, 4 black-skinned bananas instead of 2, and frozen mixed berries instead of fresh blueberries. 

For a little extra oomph, I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, a dash of ground cloves, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tbsp plain yogurt.

Like another reviewer (diane), I baked it in one large pan (7" x 9.5") for about an hour.

I made these into muffins for the kiddos and they have been requesting them every day!!  The only change I made was to sprinkle the blueberries with a little sugar and lemon juice and to let them sit a while before adding to the recipe.

Delicious! I cut the sugar down to 1.2 cup, used Trader Joe's frozen berry blend (raspberries, blueberries, blackberries) instead of blueberries and doubled the berries to two cups. Baked as muffins for 25 minutes.

I did use this recipe but changed a few things & was so grateful when it turned out moist & so delicious! I added another banana, 1/4 C flour, & 1/2 cup buttermilk & maybe another pat or two of butter, & changed the white sugar to brown. Oh & over a cup of crushed walnuts. I was experimenting & it turned out great!

Banana bread rocks, and this was no exception.  Three of us polished off nearly 2 dozen of these scrumptious little muffins in 3 days.  I think that speaks for itself.

Making my 5th loaf of bread with this recipe. Outstanding! Really moist, too, which sometimes bread loaves turn out dry so I was pleasantly surprised. I did add cinnamon to this and mine had to bake almost 50 minutes. I doubled this recipe and while baking 2 loaves it took about 1hr and 15 min and they were both perfect! Can't wait to try the banana chocolate chip version of this recipe. :)

I added cinnamon, baking powder, and used 2 cups of blueberries......and made muffins, cooking them for 25 minutes at 355 degrees (my oven takes longer than recipes call for, so I turn it up and add a couple minutes).....these were so very, very good......definitely a keeper.....and what a great way to use up the ripe bananas and blueberries............Thank you for this recipe!

I wasn't sure what the combination of blueberries/bananas would be like but loved it! Sweet, but the blueberries added just a little bit of tartness.  Also it was a very moist bread with the perfect amount of denseness.  I don't like my banana bread to be too light and airy like a cake and so this was perfect.  I used 2 regular sized loaf pans which yielded 2 shorter loaves.  (I baked for 45 minutes at 350.) Still very good, but next time I may just make the one large loaf.

I've made this recipe several times now.  It always turns out wonderful. I 1 1/2× the recipe and bake it in a 13x9 pan to make it easier to share. Everyone that has had a piece loved it as well. Definitely a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing.

My first time making banana bread at all. I did half the batter without blueberries and used 3 bananas altogether. Both breads turned out great!

I baked these in muffin cups for an easy grab and go snack.  I modified the recipe by cutting the butter in half and offsetting the difference with unsweetened applesauce.  I also cut the sugar in half while offsetting the difference with splenda.  It was still moist and delicious!

Loved these!  Made muffins (24)- so I baked them at 350 for 18 minutes!  They are so moist- will definitely make them again!

This is a new favorite!  I used sifted spelt flour instead of white flour, added 1tsp baking powder, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1tsp cardamon (could have used even more).  Perfect!

I made this this morning and it came out wonderful!  I had to used dried blueberries, but they were still great in the bread. I made one large loaf and cooked for about 50 minutes - just perfect!
