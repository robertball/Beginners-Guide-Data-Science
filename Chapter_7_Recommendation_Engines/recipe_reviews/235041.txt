Made the recipe as is & it turned out great! Drizzled some carmel sauce on the top & served it chilled.  Next time I might add some chopped pecans & chocolate chips to the top too! Yummy!

I was so excited to see Kahlua recipes on the site.  I made this for my office party.  I did add in a bit more Kahlua. Everyone LOVED it. Will definitely make it for the holiday for my family.

I made this for a dinner party I was invited to and it was a hit. I will say the only thing different I added to the recipe was a dash of salt as well as 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I dressed the cake with a ganache and a dusting of the left over graham cracker crumbs. I am not much of a baker and this cheesecake came out perfect. Everyone enjoyed this cheesecake thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this exactly as is. It was probably one of the easiest cheesecakes I have made. I usually hold back a little on the liquor in recipes, but not this time and I was pleasantly surprised. My dad begged me to make another one and he hasn't even finished this one yet.

As much as I enjoy the typical pumpkin cheesecake, I was sure this one would be even more delicious. As some other reviewers mentioned it was more like pumpkin pie than cheesecake. I also found that the Kahlua did not complement the flavors as well as I expected. It was easy to make though and was still tasty. I will opt for plain pumpkin cheesecake next time though.

I just made this and it whipped together very easily! I didn't have a springform pan (it's on my Christmas list), so I just used a frozen pie crust I had in the freezer (don't judge me, lol). I didn't have any ginger so I just used pumpkin pie spice. I also used 1/4 of a cup of Kahlua instead of a half because I didn't want a strong liquor flavor, I just wanted a nod to it. I also put some chocolate chips and pecans on top of half of it, lol! It's a very good, adult, festive dessert!!  And EASY!!!

This was good. More like a pumpkin pie than a cheese cake.  Couldn't really taste the kahlua either. But, still not bad if you want something pumpkin and sweet.

This was a very simple recipe to follow and it was quite delicious.  I didn't care that mine cracked in the middle but when I tried to remove the spring form pan, it cracked all along the sides.  Then I realized that I forget to spray the pan and sides with Pam, so it was completely my fault.
Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I'll definitely make it again!!
Yummy!!

I tried to save time by buying a ready-made graham cracker crust.  Will not do this again as it was not large enough for the cheesecake filling.  Will have to make it again with a spring-form pan to get a better idea of how it will trule taste, but it is not too bad as is.  Just ended up making indiviual small cheesecakes in muffin tins with the left over filling. I enjoyed the slight hint of Kahlua in the pumpkin.

Made this twice now. Followed recipe to the letter.  HUGE crack in top of cheesecake both times.  Would have given 5 stars but for that and it could be a little sweeter.

I was disappointed with this :(  I thought it would be great but it was just ok. I do agree with the other comments that it is more like pumpkin pie than cheesecake. I love pumpkin pie but I couldn't hardly taste the cheesecake AT ALL. If I try this again I will add less of the pumpkin

Wasn't sure how big of a spring form pan to use. Used the largest I had which was a 10" pan. Seemed to come out a little small about 2 inches in height. Tasted excellent and very easy to make, now if all my guests like it then it will be a hit.

I served this cheesecake for Christmas dessert and it was delicious!  The crust was a little wet and most of it stuck on to the bottom of the pan, next time I'll use a little less butter in the crust. Shelley

Thought this was a great mix of cheesecake and pumpkin pie.  Would definitely make it again.  Went over great with guests.  Used a caramel ice cream topping drizzled over it which was a nice addition.  I could really taste the Kahlua in it as well which was one of the things I really liked.  Great flavors!

Amazing and fairly easy to make. It was so good, my roommates told me they initially thought I bought it at the bakery!
