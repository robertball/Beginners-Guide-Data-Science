I love this recipe! Very quick with impressive results. I always use a springform and I add another Tbls. of butter to the topping mix. I prefer pecans and if they're chopped small they're less likely to fall off of the top. One other tip make one day in advance. Once it's cool cover it well and place it in the fridge.

A great cake when your pressed for time!I actually baked this recipe in small (individual)springform pans.I made a filling of heavy cream cocoa powder and a little coffee. I whipped it into whip cream and topped one cake put another on top and piped fancy rosettes on top. I dusted the top and plate with cocoa powder. How beautiful! Everyone thought they came from a fancy bakery!!

I doubled the graham crackers chocolate chips and margarine. I am not a big fan of cake but this was exceptional! I am so happy I tried this and I will be using it again and again.

This cake was a waste of good ingredients. The topping just falls off!
