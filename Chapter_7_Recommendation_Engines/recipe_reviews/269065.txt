First of all, I always read the comments to look for variations on the recipe.  I don't think cooking is a science, where you must follow the recipe precisely, but more of an art. I made this late last night and haven't even tasted it myself. However, my two roommates report that it's awesome. The only variations that I used were that I shredded a pound of mild cheddar because I didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese, and I baked it for a full hour. I will definitely make this again!

Turned out great. Used a large cast iron skillet. Corn meal  topping was not spreadable and insufficient ton

This recipe is very good with the exception of the topping. I think when I make it again I will make a cornbread topping and put on it.
