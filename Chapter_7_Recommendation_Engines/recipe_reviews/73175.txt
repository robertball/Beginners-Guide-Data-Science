I agree with previous reviews this is nothing like a cinnamon roll. I tried this recipe for a family dinner that I was hosting and it did not go over well. The cream cheese filling amount needs to be decreased and it should be slightly sweetened. The original amount made it soggy and almost impossible to slice into individual rolls. The sweetness of the frosting is not enough since you are adding it to the warm roll the runs right off. I would not try this again.

I added some brown sugar to the cream cheese filling and didn't use the frosting.  Easy and quick.  You can microwave the filling instead of using a saucepan to make it even easier.

To call these cinnamon rolls is a real stretch. They are soft with the filling and hard to cut and not sweet enough

Not sure what happened to the editing of this lil recipe but, of Course people did not like it!! Why would you if its supposed to be sweet and it has NO sugar!! People, add white or brown sugar to this and mix it with the cinnamon. I forgot about the cream cheese. I brushed the rolled out dough with butter and sprinkled it with cinny/ sugar. Rolled em up, baked and spread with cream cheese frosting. I had 4 Young adults in the house, they Devored these rolls in record time!! I will make these again for sure 
Thank you Klutz!! Excellent recipe who needs more attention AND Redo then it is actually getting.

ewwwwwwww.....I have never give any recipe this low of a score....but just had to do it.  The only reason it even gets a ONE star is that DH said that the flavor was there....but nothing else.  Threw it all out.  I'm sorry!

This was ok, not great-isn't a danish or a cinnamon roll, and the result is tasty, with cream cheese icing, but nothing special, or to be made again.

I think there was enough cinnamon cream cheese mixture to have done two pastry puff sheets. The mixture is not sweet enough at all. I will probably make this again but will half the mixture and add some sugar or brown sugar.

This recipe doesn't even deserve a one star. It was in the oven for 3 hours and it didn't cook! The flavor and texture was horrible. Making these rolls was/is a waster of time, energy and money.

These were awful. The filling was not sweet at all, and the outside of the roll was overdone, while the inside stayed raw. Also very hard to cut.

This recipe is fancy instead of traditional. The men at our family reunion didn't care for it, but the women thought it would be a delightful and elegant dish to serve with tea. I agree with others to add maybe some brown sugar to the cream cheese mix.
