I used the real bacon bits that come in the jar instead of cooking up bacon, and this dip was excellent!!!!

i made this dip dip at a  league cookout.  it was gone before everything else.  my family made me promise to make it just for them.  the only thing i changed is i added twice as much garlic, because we love it.  I did not add bacon.  it was delicious with bagel chips

This was quite tasty, but for some reason I didn't really dig the slaw dressing.  It made the taste somewhat sweet which I thought was wierd.  Maybe I will try it with less dressing next time.
