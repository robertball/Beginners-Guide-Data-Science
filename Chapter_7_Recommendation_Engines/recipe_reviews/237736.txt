I was afraid to try this recipe, because 1) I have never made anything GF and 2) I hate quinoa. This cake is SO moist and chocolatey, without the slightest hint of quinoa flavor. It rises a lot in the oven, but then falls. It ends up being about an inch thick, with the texture like a cakey brownie. Make sure to blend up the quinoa very well, so that you don't end up with a chunky cake.

AMAZING CHOCOLATE CAKE, best ever, even for those who are not required to eat gluten free. In order to make the layer cake a nice height, I adjusted the servings to 15 from 10 and used 3x8 inch round cake pans. This worked out absolutely perfectly!! I then frosted the cake with the Allrecipes Coconut Cream Cheese frosting, just frosting in between the layers and on top, leaving the chocolate cake exposed on the sides. It was the most beautiful and delicious cake I have ever made. I lightly toasted some shredded coconut and sprinkled it on the top of the cake. My husband, who is extremely gluten sensitive, is already looking forward to the next special event.  ENJOY!

Thank you for sharing your success. I have baked this few times and I have shared it with many friends. I double the ratio of quinoa to the water and it makes it more moist.

This cake is wonderful.  It's very flavorful, moist, and rich but not too rich.  Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I was careful to make sure I blended the quinoa thoroughly until I could no longer see any little quinoa pearls through the side of my blender.  I don't have a lot of experience using different cocoa powders, but for this recipe I used "Ghiradelli".  The result was a particularly delicious (IMO) chocolate flavor.  I opted to go with the chocolate/raspberry combination that is shown in one of the photos.  So I used Raspberry Polamer All Fruit between the layers and fresh Raspberries on top.  It was so pretty and delicious.   I served this to eight people, and everyone enjoyed it.   I will make this again.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This is SOOOOOOO good!!!! I cooked it in a 9 x 13" glass pan at 350 F for 40 minutes and it was perfect. I didn't even bother icing it.  Thank you!

Love. Love. Loved this recipe! Made it for my mother in laws birthday. My sister in law is gluten free and I didn't want to make two desserts. You would never know there wasn't flour by the taste. It's incredibly moist! My mother in law kept saying how great it was and wanted slices to take home! My only complaint is it makes two layers but they aren't high. That I think is just a gluten free issue over all. I just made another batch of cakes and made the cake 3 layers. I now have a left over layer to freeze. I made a basic white frosting and tinted it yellow, had a brain freeze and added lemon extract to match the yellow color. It turned out wonderful. I would have never paired the two together, but this cake goes extremely well with lemon. This will be my go to gluten free chocolate cake.

With tweaks I'd give this 5 stars (4 as written)! My sister and I tested this out a couple of times and found that subbing all the water with strong brewed coffee and all the white sugar with packed brown sugar gives this a perfect amount of chocolate richness :) As written it wasn't chocolaty enough for us.
Whether you use these tweaks or follow the recipe as written, the level of moisture for this recipe is perfect.

A few other tips:
Make sure to line your cake pans with wax paper on the bottom for easy removal.
If you want the best chocolate experience, bake this recipe in 2 9" rounds and use some whipped chcolate ganache as a filling and crumb coat, and frost with buttercream. Amazing!

Excellent recipe! I did not make any changes at all. One trick to getting a smooth batter is to make sure the quinoa is cooked well, even adding a little extra water just to make sure it is more on the moist side rather than on the dry side when it is done cooking. I mixed the first few ingredients in my food processor and let it blend well, then poured the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Baked as directed.  Make sure to not over cook since it will dry out the cake, and will give a crumbly texture as some people mentioned. The cake looked great and smelled wonderful! It was also very moist and held together nicely. When I served it, no one knew it was gluten free!! Thanks for sharing. I am looking forward to trying it again!

After making this once for a work potluck, numerous friends asked for the recipe and I have continually had requests to make it everytime I do get togethers with friends from work, my sports teams and my family! I'm not on a gluten-free diet but its nice to know its edible for people who may be when I take it to potlucks!

This recipe is really impressive. You wouldn't think it, but it tastes like regular chocolate cake.  Hallelujah!!  My non-GF family members loved it, and my Paleo friends were able to eat it as well -- and they enjoyed it.  Another reviewer suggested upping the amount of water that the quinoa cooks in to make the quinoa a bit softer, so I'll try that next time (believe me, there will be a next time!!).  Also, I baked this in a 9 x 13 for 40 minutes, and it was a tad dry.  I'll start checking it at 35 minutes next time.  My taste buds and my gut thank you for posting this recipe!

My boyfriend attempted to cook us quinoa (so lovely), but he added too much water, making it very mushy. I found this recipe in search of a way to effectively use most of it, and it worked perfectly. I used a touch less (almond) milk to make up for the extra moisture in the quinoa.

I didn't have strawberries, but frosted it with homemade Bailey's Whipped Cream, and it was delicious. Thanks for this recipe!! :)

This is my first attempt at baking anything gluten-free and it was a huge success. The only change I made was to double the amount of water I  cooked the quinoa in. I processed the quinoa and liquid ingredients in my food processor instead of a blender and it really thickened up nicely.  I brushed a strawberry jam glaze over the bottom layer and then topped  with a cream cheese icing with almond flavouring. This cake was so moist and yummy. I can't wait to make it again!

Fantastic!  Really moist and chocolaty!  Tasted great!  Made according to the recipe in a 9x13 pan for 40 min.  I would like to find a way to replace the butter and make this really healthy.  Maybe coconut oil?

Huge hit! Definitely making this again. I used the recommendation of cooking the quinoa in more water (I did 2 cups water instead of the original amount) to make it softer. Everyone was raving about it, especially since it is so healthy. ALSO I did use almond milk instead. I also used truvia instead of sugar!!!! Keep in mind to use the recommendations for truvia (half the amount as white granulated sugar) typically.

This was my first time making a gluten-free cake so I'm not sure if this applies to this specific recipe or all gluten-free cake recipes.  This cake was sticky! Getting it off the pan was a pain and it fell apart.  I did it get it back together with frosting, but it was huge pain trying to get it back together.  It was more like a brownie consistency.  You really need to grease the pan, hard.  I used oil and gluten-free flour to grease the pan and that was  not the route to go. It tasted good, but like  I said, it was more like a brownie than a cake. I don't know if I'd make it again.

This recipe worked really well for me. Like some other reviewers I had cakes that rose pretty dramatically while in the oven, but "deflated" once they cooled. This made the end product a bit more like a brownie than a cake, but they were still very moist and delicious. I also took the recommendations of other reviewers to use additional water when cooking the quinoa, and to blend the final quinoa mixture until it was completely smooth, and these both worked well for me. I will definitely be making this again!

I make it with extra water and make sure the grain is fully cooked the recipe comes out too hard as directed. Replace the milk with almond milk and butter with oil. So good! Put Aldi's cherries pie filling in between and frost!!!! A favorite with my kids!

Have made this a few times for my gluten/sugar free son.  I substitute coconut oil for the butter, 1 c maple syrup for the sugar and soy milk.  I add a touch more quinoa to counter the extra liquid.  Top with walnuts and unsweetened coconut powder.  It's great.....not only for it's taste/texture, but versatility

This cake is absolutely delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers by adding a bit of extra water to the quinoa and cooking it longer so that it was really soft. My Vitamix blender was great for creating a really smooth batter.

100 stars! This is one of those fabulous gluten-free recipes that is as good if not better than regular. Do do do make it whether you need to be gluten-free or not! I followed the recipe except that I had some quinoa already cooked. I looked it up online and the 2/3 c. of dry quinoa translates to 2 full cups already cooked so that's what I used. I blended the heck out of all the wet ingredients in my food processor, mixed the dry in a separate big bowl and then stirred them together in the bowl with a wooden spoon. This cake has an almost brownie consistency. Yummmy! It took a bit longer to bake to get the centre to set up but I didn't do the toothpick thing to see if it was done because I had a feeling it might not work with such a moist cake. Once the centre felt solid I considered it 'done'. I had baked it for 40 minutes and it was still not set so I turned off the oven and left it in there for another 10 or so minutes. After it had cooled I went whole hog and frosted it with a chocolate buttercream icing. So very good! Enjoy!

I have been cooking GF for 8 years now and have used many flour blends, substitutes, flavors, even mixes. I have not used cooked quinoa, however! This is the best cake--not only is it delicious on day 1, but  also day 2!! It didn't get gritty or that weird aftertaste most GF cakes get after being stored. Used a delicious chocolate buttercream frosting--and sprinkles. Delish!! Thank you!! I will be making it again!

I used tri-color quinoa and used my Vitamix for the wet ingredients, then just used my spatula to combine the wet with the dry and it came out PERFECT! Moist, delicious, no hint of grainy, and even my husband and his buddy were begging for more..so I guess I am making another one tomorrow for my birthday girl!

this was really tasty despite burning after 30 minutes in the oven.. i'm guessing the reason why it didn't set right was because i took it out early.. it was kind of like the consistency of tres leches cake.. still delicious though.. i felt like this was a bit on the sweeter side for my personal preference as opposed to how i normally make my muffins/cakes/desserts.. but i had to sub coffee creamer for the milk so that's probably why.. bf had a bite and said it's super chocolatey like a brownie and that it works.. ty for the recipe

This recipe did not work out for me. I followed the recipe to the letter T. Things I liked about this cake: moist, not too sweet, right level of richness, chocolatey (but I suspect it's because I used good quality cocoa powder). What I DON'T like: way to crumbly, messy to clean up after blending the quinoa. No matter how much I blend, the quinoa couldn't reach completely "smooth" consistency and my palate could still feel the clumpiness in the final cake. Also, the cake was so delicate that it crumbled apart when I tried layering it. The whole thing was a mess and I had to abandon my project :(

Amazing, you cannot even tell it is gluten free. I made this as cupcakes for my Dad for Father's day and this will be my new go-to chocolate cake recipe ( even if they don't need to be gluten-free ). It made about 24 cupcakes I think. I frosted them with a Coffee Butter Frosting recipe I found on here and together they were AMAZING. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was a shocking hit with my old-school, meat & potato family. I didn't tell them it was gluten free until afterwards. I baked it in a Bundt pan and topped with melted chocolate chips and surrounded it with a cubed gluten-free brownies (store bought).

Just tried this today. Trying to go vegan but, this does have eggs and milk. I made it in a rectangular glass pan and may not have baked it long enough; turned out more like a rice pudding. It was awesome, though! My daughter had two pieces immediately. It's a great "go to" for gluten free!

So moist and flavorful! You would never guess it was gluten free. There was a bit if “crunch” from the quinoa, but it added texture. I might not have blended it enough. I will definitely make this again!

extremely moist!!  i made is extra chocolaty for my friend's bday, since he's a huge chocolate fan (and not so fond of coconut), so my frosting was chocolate butter cream.  everyone loved it.  next time, i might cook the quinoa a little longer with more water, as there was a slight detectable texture of the shells, but not at all unpalatable - folks only were aware of it after I reveal the secret main ingredient!!

Absolutely Delicious!  This one is a definite keeper! Made  it on a whim while  away visiting  family. I read the reviews and decided to add a little extra baking soda and baking powder (the result was  I didn't get any falling!),  used half cane sugar and half brown sugar and replaced all of the milk with cold coffee.  Served it with a blueberry sauce, a fresh fruit mix of strawberries, blueberries and cherries and topped it off with homemade whip cream!  Result was outstanding! My mother in law said it was the best she has ever had and my  husband had 3 helpings!  Oh...and I did double the recipe and made 4 rounds which turned out beautifully...just be sure to start checking around the 30 to 35 minute mark so you do not dry it out.  ENJOY!! (no quinoa flavour whatsoever) 

(EDIT:  took it to a dinner party last night and it was a smash hit!)

One of the most versatile recipes yet! I've made cupcakes, substituted brown sugar (instead of white) or used Maple syrup; also have substituted coconut oil (instead of butter), added walnuts, raisins & chocolate chips!

I took advice of reviewers and increased water for quinoa. I used 2 cups and it was perfect. I used the chocolate pudding icing recipe on this site also and the raspberry preserves in middle layer - it was the idea of another reviewer. Absolutely perfect!  Next time I will try cooking the quinoa in strong dark coffee because I will be making again!  My sister in law asked for the recipe also.

Awesome ! I followed others suggestion to double the water. Used white quinoa and blended it until it was completely smooth. It baked up nicely and wasn't crumbly at all. I would absolutely make it again !!!

This was a fantastic recipe. I used red quinoa and that may have been a mistake--I think it's a little tougher and perhaps should have been cooked longer as I could still feel grains in finished cake, but it wasn't bad. As others suggested, I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes. I cut the finished cake in half and stacked it with a layer of raspberry jam and whipped cream between. Topped with more whipped cream and fresh raspberries. Everyone raved and were amazed that it was gluten free. Will definitely make again.

Finally, a GF cake that is rich and moist!  Loved it, and so did all my guests that aren't on a GF diet.  Only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of regular cocoa and 1/2 cup of dark cocoa.  It came out so yummy!

I made this basically as a dare to myself, because no way can GF dessert be edible, much less delicious. I am happy (and surprised!) to report I was wrong, *this* dessert was delicious! The only thing I changed was using almond milk as my dairy, so this also made it dairy free (I made coconut milk topping). I can't say it's super healthy because of the amount of sugar in it, but if I need to make a GF dessert again, I'm going to choose this every time.

Well this was a waste of eggs and cocoa powder!  It was like chewing chocolate cake with rice in it!  Plus when I went to pull it out of pan it cracked up like the San Andreas fault.  I made a double batch and 4 rounds and the same thing happened to all of them.  I ended up making a different recipe with Bob's Red Mill 1:1 Gluten Free substitute and it was wonderful!

Great cake I have always thought that quinoa had a wonderful texture.  I am a baker and just learning how to bake GF and sugar free.  For sugar I used coconut sugar.  I decided I need to master this so family will stay glute free.  I was amazed at the cost of ready made gf treats till I started baking them.   Thank you for the share.

This is the first time I have ever made a gluten free cake.  I made the recipe exactly as is and it turned out so delicious.  I tried it on my family first as I was nervous about the results and they devoured it.  I then made it for a lovely group of ladies, one of whom can't have gluten.  They all thought it was the best cake they had ever had!  

For those that are worried about the texture, I used my immersion blender and blended it until the mixture turned thick and creamy looking.  Then I added the dry ingredients and used the immersions blender to blend it all together.

The cake doesn't puff up in the center like a flour cake, but I like that as there is no need to trim the cake layers before you frost them.

I followed what another reviewer said about doubling the water to 2 2/3 cups when preparing the quinoa.  The cake was moist, fudgey and yummy, albeit quite crumbly when it came out of the the cake pans.  Have a lot of frosting on hand to serve as "glue", but received raves for the finished product.  Highly recommend!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  It was my first time using quinoa for baking. It was amazing! Even my for kids loved it and asked for second.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe and used the chocolate gnache icing recipe from this site with strawberry jam between the layers.

Delicious!  Used Monk Fruit instead of sugar. Baked in 13x9 pan for 40 minutes.  Iced with dark chocolate chips and coconut flakes on half the cake, but the un-iced portion was equally delicious.  Will make again.

I made no changes except the size of the pan, 8x12 with 40 min to bake. I blended the quinoa for about 5 minutes. It came out amazing. Totally like a regular chocolate cake. I have never made anything that tasted this much like the regular version. It is thin so I could see why it is normally a layered cake.

wow! This cake is amazingly moist and chocolatey! No one could tell that it had quinoa in it. I will make this again.

Wow, this was a hit! I made it in a 9x13 glass pyrex dish. I substituted 1/3 cup of strong coffee for the milk, threw in a handful of chocolate chips. I made it a layer cake with Cool Whip, drizzled caramel and butter toasted pecans. I loved the texture, it was moist and I prefer this over regular cake!! Thanks for sharing.

Honestly the best chocolate cake I've ever made! I prefer this gluten-free option over regular cake. I've tried this recipe as a cake and as cupcakes. If you prefer cupcakes, only bake them for 20-25 minutes at the same temp. Fill with batter about 3/4 of the way (they will rise). It makes about 15 regular sized cupcakes. Enjoy!

I made this as cupcakes for a party with some girlfriends. I have one that cannot have gluten, and another that is allergic to nuts. This was a perfect find, because quinoa worked for both. The cake is a little denser and so moist. I topped with a simple buttercream frosting. I baked closer to 35-40 minutes because they were cupcakes. Loved by all...even those without food allergies/intolerances!

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday celebration.  Topped it with a yummy cream cheese frosting.  Everyone agreed it was absolutely the best chocolate cake EVER!  Thanks so much for this!

Surprising delicious!! It is SO hard to find recipes that work for gluten, dairy, AND sugar free diets, but this one worked! Even with substitutions, the cake was nice & moist. Watch the cooking time, the outsides get crisp and can burn by the 30 min mark, depending on your oven.

My sister made this and it was so yummy that I am about to bake! And that is a compliment because I am NOT a baker that is only 3 months a year when its cold outside.  Super moist, great texture, the quinoa has a coconut like texture which I am a fan..   but I suppose it depends on how much someone grounds up the quinoa

I loved that this was made with quinoa and no other grains!  I made this cake as a test "run"  for a possible wedding cake for my son's wedding.  It was delicious, how ever it did not have the height of a regular cake, and it was more like a brownie then a cake, however it was very good.  I will be making it for my family again.

I am gluten free and am always looking for the best recipes. This one is the best by far! It is amazing! It tastes exactly like normal chocolate cake! I am going to start using quinoa more often! THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!

I haven't tried it yet but it sounds great and I am GF, but I'd like to replace the white sugar with another sweetener.  Other than straight Xylitol or Stevia, can anyone suggest anything else... maybe a mixture of dates, apple sauce, Xylitol, etc.?  Not sure how to best sweeten it with something that won't ruin the cake.
