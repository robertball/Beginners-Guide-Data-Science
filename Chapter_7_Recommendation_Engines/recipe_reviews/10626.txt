Easy and fun to do with the kids!  Tried a few variations; omitted butterscotch chips and doubled the chocolate chips.  Also tried with just milk chocolate chips, and these were our favorites!  YUM!

I did not care for these at all! I love the combo of chocolate and butterscotch, but I HATED the taste and texture of the chow mein noodles with it.

Easy and yummy.  The kids loved them.  They got soft out of the fridge, so I kept them in there until we were ready to eat them.

My mom would make these every year around christmas time but she omitted the peanuts.  Now it is one that I too make during the holidays.  I didnt really like them as a kid but now that I am older they have become a favorite.

I get requests to make this every year!  Same recipe except I use milk chocolate chips.  Best to make it in the winter when you can put it in the garage while it sets (instead of taking up room in the fridge).  A definate crowd pleaser!  :)

These were really easy and fun to make.  My own spin, being in a family that really like coconut, was to sprinkle them with unsweetened coconut flakes.

This was a favorite when I was a child.   I used 2 cups dark chocolate chips, no butterscotch although I like it that way as well. Yummy and so easy.

This took me back to Elementry school!  These are exactly like the ones my girlfriend's mom would make for our class on special occasions.  They are very sweet but really crunchy with a salty finish.  I find people either love them or they don't.  I break up the chow mein noodles into smaller piece (but don't crush them) and make smaller mounds, I find them a little easier to eat and I get more adults hooked this way!  Also a super fast Christmas treat if someone unexpected drops in - make and toss in the fridge all under 10 minutes!  Thanks for a classic old recipe!!!

My mother used to make these when I was a kid.  It has been about 30 years since I have had them.  Last week they just popped into my head, so today I picked up the ingredients while shopping and made them.   No butterscotch, all semi-sweet chocolate chips.  They bring back so many memories!
