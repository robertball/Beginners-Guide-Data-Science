I eliminated the cherry pie filling in making this pie  and it was still very good .Next time I will include the cherries, especially for President's Day .It was a nice light ending to a dinner party . I decorated it with sliced strawberries and sliced oranges.

The versions I have had only contained walnuts and pineapple. Not much to make you feel its worth a million bucks! I made the recipe as is, except I used a can of whip cream and not Cool Whip. I don't like the texture of Cool Whip and let's be honest...its just oil! One full 7oz. can of whip cream is enough, I also added walnuts to the mix. It came out a beautiful pink color and you could see the beauty of oranges and cherries peeking through. I made it before work and after a long day I looked forward to my time alone...hmmmm!! I will use this recipe for an upcoming potluck and every chance I get at home : )

My MIL made this for fourth of July in the summer and it's soooo good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.   We add pecans, but then we add pecans to every dessert!

We enjoyed this as a light summer dessert. I did leave out the oranges and used a pecan shortbread crust. Thanks for sharing, Glenda!

Brought this to a potluck in a 9x13 and it got RAVE reviews.  The little bit that was left over was quickly claimed by the hostess as I got ready to leave. Personally, I thought it was good but not amazing.  I don't feel the oranges added much so I'm still looking for my own perfect "million dollar" pie.

Ok, so I remade this pie again and noticed that the second day after i cut into the pie there was a good amount of liquid in the bottom of the pie pan. Does anyone know why this would happen?? I followed the directions to a T and even double drained the pineapple to make sure to get any leftover juice. Maybe omitting the lemon juice would help?? Still tastes delicious but the liquid makes the crust super soggy! Any tips would help!!

I will absolutely make it again. Very light and fruity for summer. Next time I might even add bananas to make it like a banana split. The only change I made was I used key lime juice  in place of lemons n because it was all I had but the key lime was very yummy inbit
