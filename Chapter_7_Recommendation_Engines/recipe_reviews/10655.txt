Great tasting.  Much easier if you spread the nuts on top of jam instead of trying to fold into egg whites.

Really delicious. Everyone raved about them and asked to take some home. I had to change the recipe a little to use what I had on hand, so I ended up using apricot preserves, and chopped pecans instead of chopped walnuts. I plan on using the original recipe next time. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! I was bored one day and found this and made it. I left out the walnuts because i didnt have any but i doubt it needed them. My family went crazy over it and said it was one of the best desserts I've made yet (I make a lot of desserts). I will definitely make this again.

LOVE these bars! I scatter semisweet chocolate chips over the jam and let them melt, then put on the meringue. Yum. Chocolate and raspberry!

I sprinkled the walnuts over the jam and then I put the meringue on.  I sprinkled a few more walnuts on top of that instead of folding them into the meringue.  Great recipe!  Thanks Rosina!

This was really easy to make but tasted like you spent hours.  Terrific!  I wouldn't change a thing.

I brought these bars to a barbecue and they got rave reviews! I was a little worried when I made them because people were talking about how messy they were--I just lined the pan with foil and pulled them out to cut them and it was no big deal.  I followed the other reviewers' advice and sprinkled the nuts on the raspberry jam.

These are incredible and fairly easy to make.  I followed the suggestions to put the nuts directly onto the jam and that worked well.

My tip:  make sure to use LARGER than a one quart bowl for mixing the meringue!

Very nice levels of flavors with the buttery crust, sweet n sticky jam fillings, topped with a light and airy sweet crisp! I just wouldn't consider it "elegant" looking because they are difficult to cut without breaking and crumbling.

this turned into a sticky, crumbly mess. It was however, a tasty mess.

These worked out well and are pretty tasty.  I do suggest lining the pan with parchment paper, warming the jam a little bit before trying to spread it, and letting the bars cool a bit (but not completely) before cutting.

A dear friend used to make a similar recipe.  I toast the walnuts and cool then, then finely grind them, adding 2 T of the sugar to them toward the end so they don't become oily.  I separately finely ground 1/2 cup sugar - if you add more than that to the egg whites they collapse.  Also add 1/2 tsp cream of tartar to the egg whites to prevent the cracking.

This was delicious!  All my cookies tend to turn out hard, but the jam kept the dough from stiffening too much.  I replaced raspberry jam with currant jam and didn't add the walnuts.  I then made a batch with blueberry jam which was delicious.  Great for leftover jam!

I made this twice.  First time, I followed the recipe to the letter, and the bars were too crumbly and delicate, and too sweet.  The second time, I reduced the pan size to a 13x9 to make the cookie layer thicker, I used blackberry jam, and used only 2/3 cup of sugar in the meringue.  I also waited to cut them while they were cold, good idea, they cut beautifully.  Don't omit the walnuts, they are an addition that show the dish's origin.  In Russia and the Caucasus, they make a filled pastry/cookie filled with walnut meringue, and then serve it with tangy fruit sauce made with jam.

Great bars! I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious. Make sure you beat the egg whites long enough. I did mine 5 min. I will make again!

This was great. I had fresh black raspberries my kids had picked so I used sugar and cornstarch to make a cooked filling to replace the jam. I sprinkled the walnuts as suggested by others and used parchment paper to line the entire pan. It lifted out perfectly for cutting and was absolutely delicious.

This is a pretty simple recipe and makes a delicious dessert! The crust was a tad too thick for my liking though.
