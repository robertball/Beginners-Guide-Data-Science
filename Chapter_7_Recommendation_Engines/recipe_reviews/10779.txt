This turned out surprisingly good even though it is truly geared to someone with a big sweet tooth.  I thought the white chocolate would be too much but well-blended, it's not.  Had to substitute for the candied cherries half the amount of dried, sweetened cranberries and chunks of semi-sweet chocolate for the morsels. I was a little unsure of the directions, so did what I've done with Rice Krispy Treats - I placed the mixture in a well-oiled one-cup funnel to make "kisses".  It makes exactly four.  They hardened at room temperature at which point I could wrap them in cellophane and tie with a ribbon.  I may try this recipe with all the ingredients except the white chocolate and according to the recipe for Rice Krispy Treats but I will certainly make this one again as it is written!  The only trouble I had was with melting the white chocolate.  I used the microwave and perhaps this was the problem?  Even though the chocolate got a little dry and wouldn't pour, I could mix it into the other ingredients by hand.
