If I could give this recipe NO stars, I will. I have been cooking recipes from Allrecipes for a  good time and 99.9% of the times they are superb, but, honestly, I did not care for this recipe: in these crepes the edges dryed before the center was cooked (and it remains undercooked no matter what I did) they taste like plain flour and milk: nothing above usual, I'm a good cook and I didn't like the crepes, I did mine perfectly round, thin and every time remains a bit of undercooked batter in the center, plus the flavor is like in every crepes: unflavored, just for add your favorite taste: salt or sweet. (Try the basic crepes recipe by Jen, that's a keeper, and you don't need to suffer making the crepes thin as paper, they cooked through very well. Believe me)

This works just fine - like anything that involves adding flour to wet ingredients or working with raw flour, you have to let it sit for a bit (I always leave Crepe batter in the fridge for at least a half hour to let the flour do its thing.

If the review says it tasted like flour...they didn't let the batter sit.  This is a nice recipe because it is simple, easy to remember and you can add salt, orange or lemon zet, a bit of sugar or vanilla, some thinly sliced scallions, or what have you depending on what you want to fill the crepe with.

And remember the first Crepe almost always is ruined - don't sweat that. You could add a touch of melted butter to the batter (taking out a bit of the milk) and that will help the stickiness problem.

An excellent and easy crepe recipe! Very tasty with any sort of sweet topping. I didn't have butter or anything so I used this one instead of my usual nalesniki recipe and it turned out excellently! 
To the reviewers who gave this recipe such a bad rating: If you can't make this crepe recipe, don't even try Polish crepes, holy geez! 
Some of these reviewers must not know how to make crepes or something (they are NOT pancakes) because this one was so very simple and worked every time! Remember, with pancakes, you are making thick small things, with crepes, you fill the entire pan with a very thin layer of batter and then you roll them up after. There is nothing wrong with this recipe people, give it a try!

mm I still don't care for this recipe, OF COURSE I DO know that they are not pancakes (some people think that the world is as "smart as they are") And I've been in France, having REAL french crepes, so I can say this recipe is useless. And, also I have to say that I'm not a begginer: I'm very good at cooking. I'm not giving this recipe a third chance. The basic crepes by Jen are what I was looking for. You can try to do this recipe as many times as you want. It always will taste like plain flour. If you DO KNOW the difference between pancakes and crepes, then don't waste your time:)

These were ridiculously easy to make.  Great with blueberries or just plain butter with REAL maple syrup. Yummy!  There were lumps when i put them in the pan, but when the Crepe was done, they were gone. Very easy to flip! No mess.

This recipe was delightfully simple and very tasteful.  I added a tad bit of sugar to my batter and made crepes for a party.  Everyone was impressed with the "Real French Crepes"

I've made this many times with complete success. It's a nice, easy recipe. I do use a little butter instead of the spray and sometimes I'll add a touch of vanilla to it, depending on what I'm topping them with. I use a blender to get the batter very smooth and then let it sit in the fridge for an hour before making it, sometimes even overnight just to make sure that every bit of flour is absorbed. This is an essential step, and you won't get a floury taste. It's very important to use a high quality pan, I use a 10" cast iron pan and heat it on med/high and melt the butter. Pour the batter in and immediately swirl it to fully cover the bottom.  It only takes about 1 minute before it's dry enough to turn and then maybe, MAYBE 15 seconds on the flip side. Just tilt your pan over and the crepes slide right off onto your plate.   SammySam, this is a great recipe I'v used for a long time, thank you!

This is an excellent recipe but does need to rest for 20-30 minutes as any crepe batter should. Much healthier than the usual that use butter and salt. The flavour is the eaters choice, I like lemon juice and a sprinkle of sugar. I am French, and this is as good as it gets...

This is a fantastic crepe recipe.  I've made crepes many different times with many different recipes over the years.  This was certainly the easiest!  I added a small bit of sugar and vanilla for flavor since I was making strawberry crepes.  Did not even need to sweeten the fresh strawberries!  YUM!!  I can see that they might be a bit "floury" tasting without the sugar and vanilla, but with, they are fantistic!  Come out of the frying pan perfect.  I will use this recipe from now on!

I liked how easy this recipe was.  Just one note:  Some of the flour didn't incorporate and there were little lumps so I strained it through a metal strainer.  Worked great!

I thought this recipe was great, so very easy. It was the first time I made crepes and they tasted just like the ones in Paris!  A tip - these are great with Nutella.

I studied abroad in France this past summer and ate my fair share of crepes.  This recipe was the most like the ones in France that I've tasted since being home.  Thanks!  I did add a little vanilla to mine to give it some more flavor.

I just made these French pancakes and they are very good! I have made these before and your recipe tastes the same. I also have been cooking for years, and for the bad reviews, I don't think these people know what French pancakes really are. These were great Samantha!

I did not care for this recipe.  All I could taste was the flour, and they were too doughy in the middle.  I made super thin ones, thicker ones, cooked shorter and longer; I tried everything possible with these and they were all terrible!  Never again. These may be a variation on a pancake that look crépe-esque, but these are not crépes!

Very good. For the filling I stirred some fresh lemon zest and juice into some cottage cheese and then I topped them with some warm marionberry sauce. I made these for a large group and everyone really LOVED them! No complaints. I will make these again.

To those who have not had an opportunity to travel to Europe...European Desserts are not as sweet as Americans are use to. Flavor comes from the filling not from the crepe itself.

First let me say that I am a Gramma and this is almost identical to the recipe that my Grandmother gave me some 40+ yrs ago. She added 1t salt, 1/2t baking soda. She also only used 2Tbsp milk and the rest water as milk was 'dear' in those days. Also, she cooked them in hot, melted lard and they got all lacey and crispy around the edges. Hmmmm, I can almost smell them right now. Still one of my favorite breakfasts but I do skip the lard and use a little soy margarine.

Few things to note:  1) mix your batter and then let it sit while your pan is heating.  2) keep the temp of the heat at med-high.  3) discard the 1st crepe.  4) if you haven't mastered spreading the batter by twisting your wrist, then spread it with your spatula so that it is uniformly very thin.  5) peek under the crepe to see if it is lightly browned before flipping.    This recipe is terrific, true to tradition, and very simple.  Just takes some practice.

tasted very similar to my former french roommate's recipe.  seems most of the negative comments stem from user error.  (i.e. watch the heat and butter the skillet every time)  also, i added an extra egg because she made them really eggy. :)

This is THE recipe to go from.  Delicious crêpes, without or without additions.  I live in Québec and these are pretty much just as good as what you'd get at a fancy breakfast place.  Thanks Samantha.

This lacked flavor: had more of a "flour" taste and it was not easy to manage... too fragile to handle.

sprinkle a little lemon juice and then sugar before you fold it up and it tastes just like in paris.  Great recipe.

I did not care for this recpe.  It's bland, flour tasting, hard to cook.  I added a tablespoon sugar, a pinch of salt and vanilla and these STILL did not like the taste.  I only tried them because I had only one egg, and this was the only crepe recipe with only one egg. If you make this recipe, try another crepe recipe with on this site and you immediately taste the difference.  It may be that your toppings are outpacing your crepes.

I've been making crepes off and on for years. Every recipe I've tried basically tastes the same. This was no different. I can't expect much when the only ingredients are milk egg, and flour. I have never tried crepes with ice cream before, that made it taste a lot better.

This is by far the easiest recipe to follow, yield delicious crepes, and close to original taste that we experienced in the street of Paris. I just made them and my teenage kids enjoyed them with Nutella and sugar powder sprinkled on top. I made few changes though, I added 1 tea spoon  spoon melted butter and 1 tea spoon pure vanilla extract to the batter. Also, after mixing , I kept aside the crepe batter for 30 mins to help the flour mix up with other ingredients. That really helped in making the final result delicious. My first crepe did not come out as I wanted but rest were super good so a little tip... Preheat your pan nicely and then pour the batter in the pan and spread. Enjoy!

1)To prevent clumps of flour, don't add all the milk at once. Make a thick smooth batter first, and then add the remaining milk. 2) make sure to let the batter rest in the fridge at least half an hour, but overnight is better.

I have been making this recipe for years! I like to put nutella on then and fold then over twice. Its awesome! Not sure what the persons before me problem is because this is the easiest crepes recipe ever! Just make sure when you put in the pan you make it paper thin as stated in the recipe or yes it will be undercooked!

I always add a little vanilla.  For filling, I use cream cheese, then put 2 or 3 back in the pan and add some apricot sauce kicked up with a little apricot brandy.  Get everything back up to temp and serve.  They are great.

How anyone got crepes out of this, I do not know. The first one stuck and burned. Washed my pan and pancake turner, dried, heated pan up again, tried again. Same result. I didn't give it a third try. I washed my pan again, and this time added Bisquick to the batter until it resembled crepe batter. In my opinion the ratio of liquid ingredients to dry ingredients is off; the mixture is too milky, not enough flour or egg in the original recipe. I'm an experienced crepe and pancake maker, and this just didn't work.

These are the best crepes I have ever tasted. My husband and I are ex Montrealers and when I made these this morning he said they are just like his mother made years ago!!! I really can't see why someone would want to rate this recipe with less than one star!!

I thought this was the easiest crepe recipe so far, they turned out GREAT!! As a matter of fact my kids and husband were looking for more, and stated they have never had crepes like these before.
Nothing like a noodle, and my crepes were perfectly moist!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I actually halved the flour and milk (and used vanilla soymilk), still used one egg, and a teaspoon of raw sugar.  I grew up in Germany and these tasted just like the ones my mom used to make for us when I was younger.  Now I need to get some Nutella to eat them with!

I thought this was a super easy recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added vanilla.  The only thing I found was that because they had to be so thin, I had to spray my frying pan each time with Pam so that I could flip them while keeping them in one piece.

This method turned out great for me.  I don't know what Patitio, a previous reviewer giving a negative review, was doing wrong. Use a good quality pan and you will have wonderful crepes. Cheap pans never produce a good result.    I fill mt crepes with a strawberry ricotta filling and top it off with a strawberry glaze.

This recipe reminds me of the crepes i buy in my local market for breakfast on he weekends. I filled the center with a chocolate-hazelnut spread and folded it twice to make a triangle shape, sprinkled with some powdered sugar and topped it with fruit for a delicious breakfast! It didn't taste like flour as some reviewers have stated. As a French Canadian myself, it tasted just as i expected it to, which was delicious!

Come on people. Grease your pan a little. Let this sit for awhile after mixing- I let it sit for a little over a half hour. It makes all the difference. Unless you add anything to the mix OF COURSE its not going to taste like anything, try a little vanilla extract or cinnamon if you're using it for a dessert. In French fast food places here in MTL they use a small lattle to pour it on a flat round frying plate and make a spiral as thought drawing it starting from the middle so it comes out EXTREMELY thin. So good and so versatile!! Throw some ham, cheese and asparagus in the middle and fold it in half..mmmmm

Although I do love a good crepe, these didn't do it for me. The batter should have a bit more egg and less milk and flour. The addition of a pinch of salt and a tsp. or so of vegetable oil would give these that true crepe flavor and consistency, as well. Waiting for the flour to set is always a good idea, but it's important to have a good base to begin with.

Easiest to remember, if you make it enough times, you don't need the recipe anymore.  The most versitile, you can add whatever you want, vanilla, cinnamon, fruit, hazelnut flavor, whatever and it still comes out delicious everytime!

I thought this recipe was phenominal. I saw it on here, realized how simple it was, jumped up and ran into the kitchen to make them. I didnt even have a whisk! i mixed the batter with a fork til it was smooth and they came out perfect. Two things i did do different: i added a couple splenda packets to the batter, because I knew i was eating them plain, and i gave my skillet a little butter before each crepe. They didnt taste like flour at all. I cant believe how easy these were. What a great breakfast to make for your sweetheart on sunday morning, maybe a little creme fraiche and fresh berries. and so fancy! Ooh la la!

This is the first time I've been successful with making crepes. The batter was a little thick on the first one, so I added some water. I had also put about a tsp of salt in the batter to begin with, and beat vigorously with a fork. I don't know how other reviewers could say they tasted like flour, I had a distinct slightly eggy flavor to mine. It was perfect for the savory filling and swiss cheese I rolled up in them (then returned to the pan to let the cheese melt). These are great.

I am from Quebec and this is exactly how to make crepes. I read a review saying that this was not a good recipe because the middle of the crepe was undercooked. All u have to do is lift the pan and play around with it until the batter is spread all over covering the whole pan. U can also add fruits to this to give it a little extra fun taste. ( strawberries, bananas ect.. )  I also spread peanut butter on top before adding the syrup.  It's delicious  :)

We might have been doing something wrong, but everytime we tried to flip these crepes, they would break. It got somewhat frustrating after a while. Other than that, they were tasty.

A little plain, but what would you expect from egg, flour and milk? Very easy. I topped these with a chocolate sauce also found on the site and sweetened them up just right. Thanks for the recipe.

I have always been afraid of crepes...but felt the urge to try again despite my past failures and lo and behold, they were perfect! My husband thanks you for the banana cinnamon crepe extravaganza we had for breakfast last weekend. Can't wait to try them with chicken and white sauce!

Maybe they're not exactly real French crepes, but they're good nonetheless. I've used this recipe several times and, as always with crepes, every time it's a challenge. I use a little less milk and let it stand for about 20 minutes before using the batter. Don't get discouraged if some crepes break, especially the first one, it takes some time to learn how to flip them!

I loved the fact that it was not heavy or buttery like other recipes. tried with different toppings like melted cheese, cream cheese, cottage and herbs, sour cream and strawberry sauce, nutella and bananas. Trying it today in the oven, stuffed with mushrooms-spinach-sautéd onions and cottage cheese covered with béchamel sauce and shredded emmental cheese

I added sugar and some orange oil and vanilla and they turned out great.  First time making crepes since high school.  I'm 32, lol, so it's been at least fifteen years. I also let the batter sit over night on the advice of a friend and whisked it back into solution this morning.

I make a triple batch of these whenever I make them.  I do use double the eggs and add a little agave syrup, so not exactly as written.  So, I use 6 eggs, 6 cups of milk and 3 cups of flour, plus a squeeze of the agave bottle.  The kids eat them with either Nutella or PB&J.  One day, they will learn to eat these with fruit and berries... but for right now, this is what they like.  The rest get layered with wax paper (as I make them).  Then, they go in the fridge and get eaten by the kids over the next few days.  Started doing it when Costco discontinued the La Creperie crepes they used to sell and all three kids went into mourning.  I am a great cook, but crepes have always intimidated me.  Didn't realize how easy they are and how much better and cheaper they turn out than the Costco La Creperie ones (which weren't all that good, but the kids loved them).

Loved this recipe.  I like that there is no sugar in it so that I can eat them with a savory filling.  I ate them with a fried egg filling and nutella.  Will definitely make again

I also am Quebecoise, all i'd add to your recipe is a tablespoon of melted, cooled butter. and i'd not use pam but rather lightly, very lightly brush the hot pan with butter. I also add one egg white, being careful not to "fluff" while mixing. My family love crepes, one son enjoys spreading his with peanut butter then rolling a peeled banana inside :) Don't you think we need more quebecois input on this site? lol let's bring on the feves au lard and the sunday porc et petits patates brunes :D

It took me a couple of times to get them thin enough and flipped well but once I did, they turned out very well.  We enjoyed them with ice cream and chocolate sauce, but I would also like to try them for dinner with small bits of ham and some cheese next time.  Very good!

maybe its because I am from France.... But this is not the way I was taught to make crepes at all.... Adding a pinch of salt and sugar makes all the difference. I tried it your way and it didnt come out right at all. My husband loves my crepes. I started adding a pinch of vanilla to it lately and he just loves it even more.

A basic crepe recipe that's super simple to make.  I had no problem cooking the crepes all the way through or flipping them provided I remembered to spray the pan each time.  For even better looking crepes, an electric crepe pan can work wonders.  Of course they'll taste like flour if you don't add anything to it - or flour, egg, and milk more precisely - but they're absolutely delicious if you love drowning them in REAL maple syrup like I do!

For a treat, try buttering them and adding brown sugar before rolling them up and covering in syrup.  Delicious!

This is a good recipe. I did make one modification. Make the batter the night before you use it using 1/2 the milk. Just before frying, add 1/2 cup club soda instead of milk. If you want to flip rather than turn, go easy on the butter or oil in the frying pan. Sprinkle each crepe with powdered sugar.

These were ridiculously easy. The taste and texture were perfect.  I've tried other crepe recipes, but they tasted like flour, or the melted butter called for wouldn't mix into the batter or solidified. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome and so simple.  First time I ever made crepes at home.  I thought they were this crazy recipe, but this just like eating these in a restaurant.  It took me 3 before I got one to stay together.  Secret, lower temp setting to cook.  To add a hint of sweet, I added 1 TB of vanilla.  Batter was not affected.  Strawberry crepes are my favorite and every Mom's day our family goes for breakfast to get mom's strawberry crepes.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

Delicious! My grandmother was French and she made me crepes every Saturday morning. As soon as they came out of the pan, she would spread them with a thin layer of brown sugar, roll them up and serve them hot. The sugar would start to melt and taste and smell heavenly! Probably not the most nutritious breakfast, but so yummy. This crepe recipe is the closest I have found to hers. Simple and fantastic!

Disclaimer: I do not have a crêpe pan, and I already have bad luck with crêpes.

These crêpes were very delicate and therefore difficult for me to flip without breaking them.
They were also very bland.
I suppose those are two possibly positive aspects (delicacy and flavor that lets the other additions shine). For me, Je n'ai pas aimé.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but, having made crepes many times before it helps to use a good quality non stick/thick skillet or crepe pan and to take the pan off the heat when you add the batter, swirl it around until it sets and then put the pan back onto the heat.

Excellent recipe!  I have no idea what people are having so much trouble with, or how they are getting the taste of flower in them.  Unless, of course, they are trying to compare them to over sweet and over buttery gourmet versions.  This is a real traditional French crepe recipe.  Very simple, and very good.

We make crepes at home all the time. I like that this recipe has no sugar, because you don't need any in the batter. However, it helps to add some vanilla extract to add flavour. Also, I usually go with 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk.

This is actually a great recipe! I am surprised it has few reviews. This is the closest I have tasted to the Crepes in Paris. Same texture same taste. Thank you for submitting it. I make it for my family all the time and we love it!

I am not a great cook, I am learning day by day trying new recipes. I love Crepes but never got an easy recipe. This one is simple, delicious and right on the nutritional facts. A total keep.

I love this recipe! I have actually made it my own and have added a few extra ingredients! Add a tbl spoon of vegetable/ canola oil, 1 tbl spoon vanilla extract, salt and replace the milk for coconut or almond milk! FANTASTIC CREPES!

Very easy and hassle-free.  Can adjust the sugar level afterwards and turn it into either savory or sweet crepes.

I made my crepe with rice milk instead of regular milk and I used coconut oil instead of non-stick cooking spray and they turned out amazing. I used a blueberry sauce and it was heaven! My first attempt was a little too soft to be a crepe and looked like a floppy pancake, but my second attempt turned out wonderful! Mmmmmm! Yummy Mothers Day crepe!

Instead of an egg I used the liquid from a can of chickpeas and just eyeballed the ratio of ingredients till it was a consistency I liked and it turned out great! :)
