I was looking for something special for Valentines Day and this one hit the spot. It was DELICIOUS. Although, I did some changes. I didn't want peppermint, so I used 1/2 cup crushed cinnamon hearts, cut back the sugar just a bit and it didn't need the food coloring. It would also be great layered in parfait glasses with whip cream. Thanks.
