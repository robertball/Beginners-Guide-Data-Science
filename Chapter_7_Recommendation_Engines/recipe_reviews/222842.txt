Okay, I really like this.  I used Pepsi Max and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  Used smoked chipolte hot sauce in place of powder.  Skipped the liquid smoke and added 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika. I thickened it a bit after I pureed the sauce with about 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch disloved in a small amount of the sauce.  Stirred into remaining sauce, heated until just to start to boil and thicken.  Stir constantly to prevent burning.

Omg!! What a fabulous taste this has. I am tired of desert's made with rhubarb. This is the BEST sauce ever and so easy!!
I'm a Canadian who now lives and is a citizen of the good old USA.
My Canadian friends think it tastes like HP sauce and the Americans think it tastes like Lea & Perrins steak sauce!!!  Wow again yummy!! I used Dr Pepper for the almond taste! Try it!  You'll live it too!

Awesome! I don't usually write reviews but after making this recipe I had to. With a big patch of rhubarb, I was getting tired of pies,and jams and thought I would give this recipe a try. I didn't use the smoke, and used paprika rather than chipotle, because it was what i had. It's so good my husband went out and bought chicken to BBQ so he could use the sauce. (I just caught him dipping his fingers in the sauce :-)

Very tasty way to use up some rhubarb!  I left out the allspice and chipotle powder because I didn't have any on hand and instead added a generous sprinkle of cajun powder and paprika.  I also used about 8 stalks of rhubarb because mine is quite skinny.  We love to eat this on eggs and as a dip for steak.

Fantastic !!!  What a refreshing change from traditional BBQ sauce !  I didn't have clove or chipolte pepper so I omitted that and added just a dash of Liquid Smoke. I've used this sauce on Salmon, chicken and veggie burgers. Thank you SO much, an absolute keeper.

I love a tangy, vinegar based bbq sauce.  I love rhubarb and enjoy trying it in a new way every year in addition to the old favorites.  This, is totally going to be an old favorite.  

I did not have Dr pepper or Worcestershire sauce on hand so I used a can of Pepsi and red wine vinegar instead.  Delicious!  Tangy, but not overpowering.  Excellent on pulled pork sandwiches.  I must stop at the store tonight to pick up some more rhubarb as well as the correct indigents to make more of this wonderful sauce for canning and use throughout the summer.  

Thank you so much for a completely different use and way of looking at the ‘pie plant’.

Great! I used red cayenne pepper instead of chipotle.  It was tangy with a little kick.  My husband liked it.  I'll probably never buy bbq sauce again!  I canned it in jars for food storage.  It made 3 wide mouth pints.  Next time I'll double the batch.

LOVED IT.   Something else to do with rhubarb.   I followed the recipe except that I did add cornstarch to thicken it a little.  I didn't have  chipotle for one batch so used cayenne pepper.  I doubled the recipe so I could can some for future use and used a hot water bath.  Family and friends gave this rave reviews on pulled pork.  I think it could be a little spicier but that's easy to adjust.   This will become a family favorite.

I'm super excited to try this on food.  We just got done making it without the liquid smoke (didn't have any on hand)it was a little sweet so we added a 1/4 t. of dried habanero after we blended it and brought it back to a boil to thicken it up a little (added a little corn starch) to can it. We also doubled the recipe to share with family and friends.  Thanks so much for a great alternative to rhubarb pies.  To hot to turn the oven on today so this was a perfect way to use up our fresh rhubarb.

This was super easy to make, I'm always looking for new ways to use rhubarb. I froze the sauce for use later, and used it to make pulled pork. The family loves it so it's a keeper. :)

Really tasted good. Couldn't taste the rhubarb at all. The only thing I will do different next time is  to put all the ingredients into the blender first, except the soda and pulse about 8 to 10 times and put all ingredients into the sauce pan. .

Love this recipe. Great way to use rhubarb. I used it in slow cooker pulled pork and it was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!
