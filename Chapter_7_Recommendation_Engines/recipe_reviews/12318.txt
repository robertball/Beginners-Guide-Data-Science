Just made this last night and my family and I loved it!  I made some adjustments from the other reviews: added cheyene powder, garlic, salt, pepper, fresh green peppers and used the sweet red peppers but drained the liquid-didn't have any mushrooms so omitted them, I used the cheese and onion.  I also used the new Pillsbury double pie crust (the easy just roll it on type) It was very good and will be made again and again!  Thanks for a new yummy recipe!

This was fantastic. It's hearty and tasty and my husband and five year old just gobbled it up. I added an extra cup of cheese to the mix and then sprinkled another quarter cup of cheese over the top before adding the top pie crust. In case you're wondering like I was, the sweet peppers come in a jar and I found them in the produce section of my grocer store. I drained thier juices like another reviewer suggested and I think that's a good move, because the pie stays nice and firm.

"This one is a keeper," says the husband, and I agree.  I used fresh mushrooms and peppers packed in water, not oil.  Turned out great.

Good but a little heavy.  I'd make it just a top crust only pie.  Delete the cheese.  Saute' fresh peppers with the onions.

definitely a keeper - but, i would take about 1/2 of the liquid out of the peppers, use fresh mushrooms and add more cheese.

This was really good and very easy to boot!  I did add some herbs (rosemary, marojam, thyme) to season it up a little, since the recipe sounded kind of bland.  Didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so obmitted.  Then I threw in some frozen mixed veggies.  Hubby RAVED.  We both enjoyed very much; even had seconds!

I made this following the recipe once, then made some changes... I used fresh Morels for the mushrooms, fresh peppers ( sauted ), more cheese ( mixture of blue and cheddar), and added 2 tbls of dry sherry to the filling. Will make again!

MMMM MMMM GOOD!!!  here's what i did... i just used a big ol' giant red bell pepper that i had previously chopped and frozen.  i also used mushrooms that i had previously sliced, cooked and frozen.  after thawing the shrooms, i squeezed some of the juice out of the bag.  i also used a whole wheat pie crust from the hippy store (health food store).  DEElicious!  GO ORGANIC!

I thought this was very good.  However I used fresh peppers not "roasted red peppers" which is what I think the recipe called for.  Because I didn't have juice from the bottled peppers I did mix up some beef oxo and flour in water and added that to the mixture.  I could have thickened it a bit more for our taste.

A bit runny, too much liquid from the peppers.  I added fresh peppers and mushrooms as well.  I also added a cube of beef OXO.  Very tasty though!

I used a frozen stir-fry mix of onions, green red and yellow peppers--still added another onion per the recipe though. Came out great! I had to adjust the liquid level per my ingredients, but was perfect in the end.

My husband and I love this (minus the mushrooms) - the kids will eat it occasionally (they're picky on different days).  So easy to make and very different!

I choose to just chop up my own peppers instead of buying the peppers in a jar and also prepare this recipe using veggie ground instead of ground beef for a delicious vegetarian alternative.  My family loves it...even my non-vegetarian mother and two year old son!

This was a tasty dinner.  I used 2 fresh red peppers- after chopping them in my food processor, I drained them by placing them in a colander.  This way the pie wasn't too runny.  I also added some spices: garlic, thyme, seasoned salt . . . it could have even used more.

I had a puff pastry made up, so used that. Used 3 fresh red peppers and sauteed them a couple minutes at the end of the browning of the beef. For as simple as this recipe is, it was very tasty. Thank you!

Absolutely wonderful, but I had to change it a bit after reading the reviews.  I used fresh red pepper, and used about 3/4 cup of the cheese. Turned out beautifully!

This was a wonderful warm dish that was a family pleaser.  I plan to make this for Christmas Brunch and add in Green Peppers. I used fresh peppers and rinsed lean ground beef after browning.

I tried this recipe following the recipe ingredients. The recipe was good, but the roasted sweet peppers without the juices over powered the entrée. I think it may have been the peppers that I bought.  I think the next time I will sautéed the peppers in a skillet.

I don't eat beef so I thought this recipe couldn't possibly be as good as the reviews made it out to be. But I stand corrected. With a few adjustments my husband and father raved about this pie! Instead of sweet peppers I just used diced, thawed frozen bell peppers. Instead of canned mushrooms I used fresh. Then I added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the mixture in the pan. It browns up nicer if you brush the top of the crust with something before baking. But overall, this is an EXCELLENT base recipe if you have meat lovers  in your life!

Very good!  I made a mistake and bought fresh red peppers instead of canned...which I am glad I did because it would have been to watery.  Over all good!
