This recipe was amazing! My fiancé exclaimed “It’s so umami!” and devoured his shoulder chop, and even though I don’t usually like lamb too much I really loved this. I made only very slight variations - we didn’t have sherry vinegar so used rice vinegar (as suggested by thestonesoup.com) and we had only one bunch of radishes from the CSA so we used a bunch of  CSA carrots in addition. Paired with boiled potatoes, it was such a lovely date night dinner.                                               Regarding the person who made this with PORK and then gave it 4 stars: I really wish people would only post reviews when they have actually made the recipe, with at most only very slight variations. Exchanging one bunch of radishes for carrots, for example, is very different than using a completely different kind of meat. Allrecipes only works if you actually review the recipe as it’s posted!

This is amazing.  I used regular radishes because they were in the fridge, and red wine vinegar in place of sherry vinegar.  Served it with Chef John's Brussels sprouts and they were a perfect complement.  Totally restaurant quality!

Was very tender, but REALLY rich and fat.  I would almost freeze the sauce to get rid of more fat. First time I enjoyed radishes!

Sauce was the richest ever, and the parsnips were wonderful. My butcher didn't have the required cut, so I used some other cut, and it was clearly far too lean. So try to get the right kind of cut, with lots of fat inside the meat.

Instead of anchovies I decided to use capers with a garlic smoked olive oil mixture (allergic to anchovies) for the dressing instead of the Dijon I use the spicy mustard .  but everything else I follow to the recipe

This was as fabulous as everyone said it would be - I’ll definitely make it again!  The only change, and I think someone else mentioned this, was the amount of fat that came off the lamb chops.  This will depend on which chops you use but “spooning” the fat off didn’t help.  I’ll use my gravy separater to get most of the fat off.  Considering that you add butter at the end, I don’t think it will ruin the mouth feel of the sauce.

This is really more like 4.5 stars.  I used 2+ lbs of pork, and used apple cider vinegar, not having sherry vinegar on hand.  Also did not have anchovies, and I used regular radishes.  While the dish was overall really delicious, it came out a little salty.  I will make this again and adjust accordingly.  If you have the time, this is a really nice way to cook lamb or pork.  And who knew that radishes were so yummy roasted like this!

This meal is freightenly good! I mean seriously, it's scary. Hands down the best dish I've ever had. Also I used reg. radishes cuz they didn't have the breakfast ones, and they tasted great and looked the same as the video.
