Immediately after watching Chef John prepare a dressing with a mayo jar I got mine out of the fridge. I did read the suggested ingredient list, but all I needed to hear was that I could use any dressing; I was able to increase the amount of the half jar of homemade dressing that we love that was in the fridge. Just poured it into the mayo jar, shook it, and poured it back as a creamy version. Frugality at its finest!

I learned to do this years ago from my parents who were in the depression. I still do it and now I have tried your ingredients and everything worked out perfect. Thanks for giving me a change in pace. 5 STARS 4 U. p.s. I never throw pickle juice away. Also helps to make a great dressing.

Mr. Sobieski, if someone not knowing the ingredients in herbs de provence is all that's wrong with society we must live in Utopia. I was shocked at your statement. Not all of us were born knowing all there is to know about cooking and ingredients. Not all stores carry some of the lesser used ingredients, especially when you get into the smaller cities and rural areas. A person should be able to ask a question without an arrogant remark being given instead of an answer. I think you owe the questioner an apology, and the rest of us for having to read your comment. 
As far as this recipe goes, I loved it, and will experiment with the bottoms of all varieties of condiment jars and bottles. Thanks for getting my creative side working!

Great way to use up what is basically something unusable. One reviewer stated they didn't know what herbs de provence was, and asked for "normal ingredients". This is what's wrong with society today

Valerie, - I agree with you and to the two snarky ones, what is this world coming to when there is no compassion!  I can never remember what herbs make up "Herbes de Provence" and have to look it up every time!!

This is good.  Another trick I use is to empty an almost full bottle of italian dressing into the empty mayo jar and give it a good shake.  There's usually enough mayo left to make a nice creamy dressing with absolutely NO fuss at all!

This was good, and a great use of that last little bit of mayo. I used half the fat mayo, because that's what we always have, and increased the herbs by doubling them. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. This dressing may be a little tangy for some people, but it was a good ratio of acid to fat for us. Served with a simple salad of Boston lettuce, endive, radicchio, and baby cucumbers. Will definitely make this, or a variation of it, when my mayo jar is next empty. Thanks!

Brilliant.  I'm accustomed to adding mayo and/or sour cream to salad dressings when I'm in the mood for something creamier ... but for the life of me I never thought to simply transfer them to the mayo jar.  Thanks so much!

Cut back on the olive oil, added 1-2 teaspoons of dry ranch dressing mix and it was delicious.  So many possibilities for making a custom dressing.  Thanks!!

I didn't have any of the fresh herbs so used 1/4 tsp. dried for each.   I also didn't have the herbs de provence so used Penzey's Mural of Flavor.  I  used raspberry white wine vinegar as that's what I had.  The flavor was OK--maybe it would have been a little more distinctive had I used the herbs de provence.  It was also runnier than I thought it would be so will add sour cream, buttermilk or more mayo per the cook's note at the bottom of the recipe..

This is an excellent way to use the remains in the Mayo jar!  I have tried it several ways using different herbs and spices...always good!

The only thing I do differently is: rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and it works great with left in the jar creamy salad dressing!

I loved this but didn't have the white wine vinegar.  So I substituted tarragon vinegar.

This was very good. I used avocado oil in place of the olive oil and also added fresh basil and garlic chives. Just add whatever kind of oil/vinegar and fresh herbs that you have. It's a quick and tasty dressing.

What a terrific idea. I had a small jar of almost finished mayo so I adjusted the measurements and also changed the herbs to just one. I used 4 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. Added parsley as my one and only herb...I had it chopped already. A smashed clove of garlic. Salt and pepper. Completely delish. Will follow to a T next time but i suspect all different varieties of herbs would work here. Thanks chef John for a great idea.
