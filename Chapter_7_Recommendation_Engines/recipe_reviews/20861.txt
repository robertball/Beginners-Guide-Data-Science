Pretty good with some changes. After reading the previous reviews I made the following changes to the recipe in order to give it a more 'dinner-time' flair: (1) used 1 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of 2 cups; (2) Added 1/4 tsp ground pepper; (3) 1/4 cup milk for additional creaminess; (5) crumbled 4 slices of cooked bacon into the recipe; (6) Sprinkled the top with fried onions and light amount of shredded cheese. The previous reviewers are right about an entire packet of onion soup mix giving this dish a little too much saltiness or onion flavor. But all in all a good recipe base from which to build to your liking.

I would give this 5 stars but that wouldn't be fair as I did not follow the recipe exactly so I will give it four.  I made a few tweaks to this and it came out delicious.  I used only 1 cup of sour cream.  I don't think using 2 is really necessary as you are going for a casserole and not spinach dip.  Also, per another reviewer's suggestions, I added about half a cup of crumbled bacon to it and used vegetable soup mix instead of onion.  Finally to make this more "casserole"y, I added 2 cups of penne pasta to the mix.  Combined and put in casserole pan and then topped with a 4-cheese blend of Colby, Mozzarella, Monterey Jack and Cheddar.  It came out delicious.  I love spinach dishes so I will definitely make this again.

I highly recommend this dish to anyone with kids who has to think of ways to get them to eat their greens.

The taste is wonderful, but, as is, this is more of a dip than a casserole.  If you add a couple of eggs (I add some bread crumbs or crackers too for more substance), then it holds together more like a casserole.

My father-in-law liked this dish but I did not care for it.  It just tasted like onion soup mix.  I like onion soup mix, but I wanted a spinach dish, not an onion dish.  The second time I made it I used Ranch dressing dry mix and added sour cream and it tasted yummy.

I used a big pkg of FRESH spinach, only 1/2 of  Lipton Soup mix and added a few croutons on the top for some crunch. It was perfect. Great 'comfort' food and quick & easy. If you used a whole pkg of soup mix, it'd be too too much!

I have made this dish several times and it was received with great enthusiasm by my husband.  We are both always looking for different ways to eat our greens so this dish has become popular in our household.  I substitute the onion soup mix with vegetable soup mix instead (the flavour is more mellow that way and goes better with other foods.)  Tonight, I added leftover chicken and my husband went wild.  This dish is a great starting point for adding leftovers or getting creative.  Have fun with it!!!!

What is the  missing ingredient?  Something is wrong.  The sour cream curdled.  It was runny.  There was the overpowering flavor of onion soup mix.  Worst results of any of your recipes I've tried.

I would have given this a 5 but it needed a little tweaking. Cut the onion mix as suggested by others in half and used onion/garlic powder. Used 1 c of sour cream and 8ox cream cheese and a tsp of nutmeg. Maevelous!

I used Lipton onion soup mix for this.  Don't know if it was the mix or something else, but this tasted like it had vinegar in it, which it didn't.  I served it to my family and no one ate more than a couple of bites.  I won't try this one again.

Great casserole.  Tips:  Use 1 and 1/2 cups fat free sour cream for less fat and less run.  Leftovers are GREAT for a cracker dip after chilled in the fridge!

I remember this recipe from my childhood.  I wanted to do a spinach dish for Thanksgiving and decided this one sounded familar.  I did make a few adjustments: I used about 1/2 the onion seasoning, and only a cup of sour cream, and added a dash of half and half.  It turned out to be yummy.  My husband and teenagers said they want it to be a regular dish!

Wasn't crazy about it, but I'm guessing that if I'd altered it like many other reviewers did, it would have been right for me. Adding cream cheese, maybe?  It wasn't as creamy as I'd have hoped; the sour cream seemed to break down and kind of separate in the oven...

I changed this up a bit after reading the other reviews. I brought it to my mom's for Thanksgiving yesterday. It turned out so good I thought I would eat the whole pan. It was such a good accompanying dish to all the meat - turkey, ham and steak. If you put it in a crock pot to stay hot, it would be a fabulous hot dip for tortilla chips. I used Knorr veggie soup mix, 1 c. sour cream, 1 brick Philly cream cheese. I had Sargento extra sharp cheddar deli sliced cheese so I broke up three slices and placed on top. I added just a little 4 cheese shredded cheese on top of that. The extra sharp cheddar really added some flavor. I can't wait to make it again!

For a lower fat content try low fat or non fat sourcream  
Also add some bread crumbs so it is not as runny as some others have suggested

I hate spinach but this is a totally awesome recipe IF you sprinkled Durkee french fried onions on top.  That makes all the difference.

I always try the recipe exactly as it is before changing anything, so that I can rate it properly. I was not a huge fan. I think it would be a lot better if you added bacon as another review had mentioned. One plus to the recipe is that it is very easy to make : )

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. It was so simple to put together and very flavorful. I only had about 1 1/4 cups sour cream, so I added a nice sized splash of milk for extra creaminess and some garlic powder too. Also, because I didn't read the recipe correctly I added the cheese in with the other ingredients, but it was fine, we LOVE cheese. I still added cheese to the top before baking. This is a definate keeper! Thanks for posting :)

I only used a little of the onion soup mix or it would have been way to salty for us. I made up the difference by adding garlic and onion powders. Didn't measure the sour cream; just kept adding until it looked right. Topped with a combo of cheddar and parm. No leftovers and thanks so much!

This was great!  I was looking for something quick and easy to take to our Easter family dinner with what few ingredients I had on hand and this fit the bill.  I only used 16 oz of spinach, used a little over half the packet of onion soup, added pepper and paprika, and topped with swiss and colby jack cheeses.  It went pretty quickly at dinner and was very tasty and creamy, even with using a combination of low fat and fat free sour cream!  I will make this again, especially since it is so SIMPLE!  Great recipe!  (NOTE:  In the recipe it says spinach, cooked, but I think this should say THAWED, as I thawed mine for a few mins. in the micro and the casserole came out perfect.)

Did not like this one that much.  The taste of the onion soup mix was to strong.  Also, it was kind of watery.  Everyone else seemed to like it.

I thought the recipe was good, but a little heavy in the sour cream. I also found that the amount of soup mix was a little much. If both the sour cream and soup mix were lessened, the dish would be above excellent!

I didnt't like it. My husband liked it okay. Onion soup taste is very strong. It is better as a dip.

Everyone liked it, but they normally LOVE creamed spinach.  I think maybe it was nutmeg that was missing...  Not sure, but it was something.

This was good, but I think next time i will add a bit less of the onion soup mix as it had a strong onion flavor (I like lots of flavor, so I didnt cut back like some suggested, but i should have), and I didn't put quite as much sour cream since other reviewers said it was best not to. I will make again.  Oh, I found it to be even better the next day.

Okay, I, too, tweaked this recipe ALOT!! Here is what I did and my hubby enjoyed (recipe for 2 servings):
1 package spinach, 3/4T onion soup mix, 1t. Good Seasons Italian Dressing Seasoning(dry), 1/2c sour cream, just enough milk to give it a nice creamy texture (about 1/8+ cup).  Cooked it and then topped with french's onions.

This one is really fast, really easy, and I always make it for Thanksgiving because it reheats well (good for a make ahead side) and is an indulgent way to have spinach without going to all the effort of making homemade creamed spinach.

This just didn't taste like I had hoped. Our thoughts on this recipe were split down the middle ~ 2 liked it okay and 2 didn't at all. Something was quite *potent* and overpowering in flavor ~ kinda got the back of our cheeks with a tingle. Ya know that feeling?! LOL! Little too sour, I suppose. I doubt I will make this again but I'm glad I tried it. Thanks anyway! :o)

I've been making this recipe for years and it's a family favorite - except we use THREE packages of frozen spinach.  This one change will make this recipe perfect.  Also, drain the spinach very well!

I thought the onion taste was really strong, so the second time I made it I only used a half of a packet of the onion soup mix and it was so much better! Very good to begin with though!

I too believe that if you add some french fried onions to the top it adds a lot to overall flavor of the dish. I also agree that the onion soup and sour cream is better with less. This recipe is definitely worth keeping!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit - everyone asked for the recipe!!  I even made it  the night before and stored it in a plastic container; just had to pour it in a casserole dish and bake it the next day.  The recipe fails to mention when to add the soup mix - I assume you just add it with the sour cream.  I also added a little cream cheese, sliced almonds and parmesan cheese.  This is a definite keeper!

Loved it and I will be making this often.  I used chopped onion instead of the onion soup mix.  I also mixed sharp cheddar cheese into the mix and added some for topping.

Tried it with 2lbs of spinach and the dip amount was perfect - added bacon and topped with french fried onions and I couldn't be happier with the outcome!

This was an excellent dish! Very easy and quick to prepare, the entire dish was scooped up on tortilla chips and corn chips. I did use the entire onion soup mix and added the entire 8 oz package of cheese and it was a big hit. Thank you!! : )

It does have a really strong flavor, and small bites are necessary. However it is a good flavor. I added parmesean cheese to the top to make it more like a casserole for me. If you like french onion dip for potato chips, this is exactly what it tastes like, but spinach instead of chips. My room mate put it on tortilla chips. I think next time I will try adding cream cheese to the recepie to mild out flavor.

Maybe I drained too much water from frozen spinach, but the casserole lacked any "creamed" consistency.  If I make it again, I'll probably put in some heavy cream for consistency's sake.

Really tasty.  Even my 5 and 6 year olds ate it without complaint!  Not as creamy as I'd hope, but the taste couldn't be beat.  Maybe adding a little cream or milk would help the texture...

I DON'T CARE FOR COOKED SPINACH,SO I THOUGHT I'D TRY THIS TO SEE IF I WOULD LIKE IT.  I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD,BUT STILL DIDN'T CHANGE MY ATTITUDE ABOUT SPINACH. ON THE OTHER HAND, MY HUBBY WHO LOVES SPINACH, THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE TASTY.  MY PICKY TEENAGERS WOULDN'T TRY IT.  I THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR A POTLUCK.

I was not particularly fond of this recipe although some of the people I served it to thought it was good.  The texture was a little too mooshy for me and I like spinach in other ways better.

This dish was so easy to make and I was surprised by how good it was. I only made half of the recipe, but I hate half of that and didn't want to save the rest for my boyfriend...I wanted to eat ALL of it!!

This casserole was great, and so easy.  The taste of the soup mix really improves it, and the little onions in the soup mix are very good with it, too.  Even people who don't like spinach will probably like this one.  It would be great at Thanksgiving.

The first time I tried this I was hungry and loved it and ate several servings.  The second time it didn't seem so great anymore.  It is worth making once.  The cheddar is important to the flavor.

I served this recipe for a New Year's Eve Party.
It was a hit!  Several people asked for the recipe.  I will make this again.  I used low fat
sour cream and 2% cheddar cheese.

This was simple to make and so delicious! Even my guest that didn't like spinach tried it and said how good it was! I made my whole Christmas dinners from recipes on this website and they were all so good I figured the least I could do was come back and review them. This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is the absolute most horrible tasting recipe I have EVER tried!   The only thing I did different was using fresh spinach chopped up rather than frozen........the rest was "as written" on the recipe.  Horrible sour taste and not creamy at all......more like curdled.    And no...the sour cream was not spoiled....it was fresh.  First time ever for Allrecipes I couldn't give it a rave review.

I have made this recipe before, but I used 3--10 oz pkgs of  'steam in the bag' cooked and drained spinach instead of just 2.  Also have chopped up some water chestnuts and added them to it.

After reading a few other reviews, I decided to mess with the recipe a little. I used low-fat sour cream, just because the calorie count with regular was flat-out scary. I also added three very small eggs and a cup or more of panko. I was concerned about having enough volume and also about the onion soup flavor being too strong, so the panko and eggs were meant to bulk it up and smooth out the flavor. 

This all seems to have worked well. I didn't love it, but my son ate three servings and took the leftovers home with him. Not bad for a spinach dish. :-) 

Next time, I will cut the sour cream in half and substitute with either ricotta or cottage cheese. I'll also use seasoned bread crumbs and maybe only half a package of onion soup mix. 

I think this recipe would be good with a variety of vegetables. It has enough flavor to stand up to collard greens or even mustard greens, but you could make it light enough to make with broccoli, zucchini, or even asparagus. Maybe a mix of vegetables would be good?

I used fresh spinach that I wilted some in the microwave.  I used all ingredients, although the amt varied as I was using up leftovers.  I also make my own onion soup mix.  My husband and I loved this, the kids hated it.

My 32 year old son made this while I had the luxury of going out for my 30 minute run.  Like a reviewer mentioned, he used half the onion soup powder.  He also used less sour cream...about 3 slightly heaping tablespoons.  In addition, he added a layer of panko bread crumbs on top drizzled with some butter.  It was excellent.  I gave 4 stars only because he had to make some changes.  He will use mozzarella cheese next time.

I have made this dish before and liked it.  However, my recipe only calls for 1 cup of sour cream and is not topped with cheddar cheese which you really don't need.  Making this again for Thanksgiving.

I read through about the first 20 reviews and decided to try making my own spinach casserole. I used fresh cooked spinach, 1/2 pkg of French onion soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, crumbs of crackers and croutons, 1 egg. Did not use milk due to the fact that spinach has a lot of water in it. Put mix in pan, topped it off with Colby, pepper jack, cheddar, and regular jack cheese. Sprinkled  crispy French fried onions and grated Parmesan. It was so delicious with all the different flavors.

Of course I didn't have sour cream (which never happens!!!) so I substituted it with evaporated milk and a dash of lemon juice. (Google substitutions) I would recommend using half a can evaporated milk instead of the whole thing, because it's way to runny then. I used onion mushroom soup mix and went nuts with a whole bag of shredded cheese! I used the 24 ounce package of frozen spinach...more is better!! It was so good, my daughter and I refused to share with anyone else! We nearly ate the entire dish in one sitting!

Similar to others (and because I cook "low salt") I only used about one-third of the onion soup mix.  I did used cooked swiss chard from the garden, cooked with one Walla Walla sweet onion, once for this recipe, and several times with spinach or mix of spinach and chard. We really like this and when I made for my brother's family Sept 2014, they loved it too!

Easy/tasty and a great low carb side dish. Maybe the people that had a difficult time with it being too soupy did not "squeeze" all the liquid out of it. I am trying it today with the Knorr mix and a variety of cheeses that were left in the fridge. I ran out of Dry onion soup. I don't see any reason though that you can't add some regular sauteed onion and then some spices/herbs. This is a good base recipe and flavor it to your liking. Thanks for posting!

My large family of 20 and I loved this recipe. We didn't think there was too much onion soup mix and we didn't think it was too much like a dip (like other reviewers.) I made it exactly as the recipe said and I will definitely make it many times more. Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this dish was just average. It was missing a zip or spice--just a bit too plain.

easy, quick and flavorful.  next time I would change the cheese to parm.  I agree that it should read 'thawed & drained' instead of 'cooked.'  love the onion flavor from the packet instead of chopping onions or shallots.

I think this dish would work better as a warm or cold appetizer served with tortilla chips.  It's a little too overwhelming for a side dish.

With a bit of added pepper and salt, this is one of the few lower-calorie spinach recipe that still tastes delicious.

Easy to prepare, but a little too onion soup taste for me. Next time I'll use 1/2 the package and it should be delicious.

This is potentially a good recipe, but you do have to play with the amount of dressing mix.  One packet for so little spinach is overpowering, but too little and all you taste is sour cream!  It also needs a little seasoning added.  I will make this again and just keep trying until I get it right!
