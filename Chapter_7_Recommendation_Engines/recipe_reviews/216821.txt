I made a few changes to both make this heartier and healthier where I could. I doubled the amount of italian sausage and used all red pepper (we don't care for green pepper at all). I also added a mess of fresh garlic and a half pound of chopped baby bella mushrooms. I didn't want to water down my sauce so I did not add the water. I used a homemade marinara sauce instead of jarred which means my sauce had more spices than the sauce called for than the recipe. This was pretty easy to assemble the directions were pretty straightforward. This was pretty tasty--my two boys really liked this one had two servings! I didn't serve this with the Pepperidge Farm garlic texas toast--my son and I made the Garlic Bread Fantastique which is also from this site. Along with a small tossed salad this was a filling and satisfying meal. All three of the guys asked me to make this again instead of Pioneer Woman's Lasagna which is HUGE because her lasagna has been MY lasagna for almost five years now. The cream cheese layer was CRAZY good. I would have never thought that it would have been. The only reason that it's not five stars is because it just needs a little more spice and a homemade sauce with more spices.

I made this for the first time tonight. This was actually my first time ever making Lasagna too. & this Lasagna was DELICIOUS and that's saying something since I do not like lasagna. My boyfriend said this was the best Lasagna that he'd ever had and that's saying something because Lasagna is his most favorite meal. I made some minor adjustments. I used HOT Italian sausage since my boyfriend and I like some kick with our food. I listened to a couple previous reviewers and I added an extra brick of cream cheese as well as I diced up a whole onion. For the spaghetti sauce I used Hunts Thick N Chunky Roasted Garlic (this is what I use as a base for my homemade spaghetti sauce) and I added some Italian seasoning and some finely chopped mushrooms (I finely chopped the peppers too since I didn't want chunky veggies taking away from the flavors in this dish). I used the "No boil" lasagna noodles so I added a bit of extra water to my sauce after some words of caution from my mother. After all that I found that I didn't have quite enough cream cheese mixture and not enough sauce. I opened a second can of Hunts and added it to the left over sausage mixture for the top layer. I also ran out of noodles. I think I needed to use a smaller dish but then there probably wouldn't have been deep enough. I served this dish with a garden salad as per my boyfriends request and some garlic toast. This recipe will be one that is used often in our house. Thanks for sharing this! YUM!

I found this recipe in a Philadelphia cream cheese cookbook and it is by far the best lasagna I have ever eaten. The cream cheese makes it so creamy and gives it a nice gooey consistency and overall it's a hearty and just plain delicious recipe. My fiancee and I have made it our "special occasion" dish because we love it so much. The only difference I make is adding a whole red pepper instead of half a cup of each because I'm not a fan of green peppers. But really everyone has to try this recipe at least once; it's decadent.

This recipe is great for picky eaters. My husband HATES ricotta cheese. He likes this lasagna though. It's the only kind of lasagna that gets eaten in my house. I like everyone make it my own. I add 1/2 lb cooked ground beef into the sauce. I don't quite double all of the cheeses but I add an extra half of whatever the recipe call for (example: recipe says 2 1/2 cups mozzarella I use 3 3/4). Everyone has their own personal preferances. Don't be afraid to make it your own:)

This was absolutely delicious! I love the cream cheese rather then using ricotta in your traditional lasagnas even though I love ricotta. The Italian sausage and peppers were wonderful in it as well. I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this several times now following the recipe exactly and then making changes based on what I had in my kitchen. It's always good. I like to use 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 Neufchatel cheese to reduce the fat a bit and it still tastes amazing. I brought it to a friends house and she demanded the recipe

I added spinach I'd chopped into the cheese layer. It spread easily with the extra ingredient.

I followed the recipe exactly but found that it really needed more sauce. It seemed a bit bland. Perhaps it would be better with more sauce. We did like the sausage instead of hamburger I usually put in my lasagna.

This lasagna is delicious. The cream cheese makes the difference. I never would have thought to use cream cheese in place of ricotta or cottage cheeses neither of which I am crazy about. Since both my husband and I dislike peppers I just chopped up a large Vidalia onion and left the peppers out. I also added 2 tsp. of Chef Prudhomme's Pizza and Pasta Magic to the sauce and increased the amount of mild Italian sausage. This recipe is my now my one and only recipe for lasagne. Next time however I will use 3 blocks of cream cheese. There wasn't enough of the cheese mixture to spread out nice thick layers. Great recipe!

This was my first attempt at a homemade lasagna! I had some friends over for dinner last night and I got it in my head that I wanted to serve lasagna (a dish that I'd always loved when my mom made it). I used Healthy Harvest whole grain noodles 90% lean ground beef and 1/3 fat cream cheese. I upped the amount of cream cheese to 2.5 packages as other reviews had suggested. This was a home run for sure! Looking forward to having the leftovers for dinner tonight!

this is our favorite lasagna recipe! We do add a small amount of cottage cheese or ricotta cheese in with the cream cheese for added texture and found we like it even better. AND...I have never precooked or boiled the noodles. Putting them in dry before baking works just as well and saves on time!!

I used lean hamburger (93/7) and used only 1 package of low fat cream cheese. Used a slightly larger jar of spaghetti sauce so no water was needed. Added more Italian spices & crushed red pepper....EXCELLENT

My son's favorite meal is Sausage Onions and Peppers so I had to try this recipe. I served it after church to my family and a few friends. They raved about it and ended up taking some of it home with them. I didn't use a jarred sauce but made a sauce with 1 can tomotoes 1 can of t. sauce and 1 c. tomatoe paste to the sausage onion and peppers...will definately make again

Great recipe for those of us who like our lasagna to stay together! A couple of changes I made... used 1lb of mild Italian sausage (instead of just 1/2 lb) 2 1/2 cups of Italian blend cheese (instead of mozzarella) used 1/3 less fat Philadelphia cream cheese and skim milk no boil noodles for the sauce I used Classico Traditional Sweet Basil. It cooked for 45 minutes in oven. Everyone loved it... husbands new "favorite" meal.

This recipe is really yummy! I did use 1lb of italian bulk hot sausage added chopped mushrooms left out the peppers and left out the extra water. I was really skeptical of using the cream cheese but it was soooo delicious. Next time I make this I think that I am going to use 1 1/2lbs of italian bulk hot sausage and use a little more spaghetti sauce.. I barely had enough to cover the top... I think that using the 2 blocks of cream cheese was perfect - so creamy! This is a recipe that you can easily change to meet your needs (like extra cheese mushrooms etc) I will be adding this to my recipe box for sure!

I made this for my friend's parents and her dad said it was the best lasagna he'd ever had. I should have used more sauce and more cream cheese filling but my fault not the recipe's! It is a wonderful recipe.

I made this lasagna last night but did half the recipe. Both my husband and I felt it was too thick/rick for lasagna...maybe doing half cream cheese and half ricotta would work better for our tastes. We both picked it apart to scrape off a bit of cream cheese and then ate it. I added extra seasoning too as others recommended. Might just try adding some cream cheese to another lasagna recipe.

This recipe is perfect. Absolutely delicious. Only change I made was I use a food processor for the onion and peppers so my kids don't notice it and try to pick it out. I have made this for large groups (doubled recipe) and has been a hit. I personally find this to be the best lasagna recipe I have made!

I made this last night and the prep time was closer to 45 minutes to an hour. I cut the Italian sausage in about one half inch square pieces and it seemed a little too big but okay. My husband loved it but it was a little too rich and cheesy for me. Overall it was good but I won't be making it again.

Mainly I want to review the cream cheese mixture because that's what I was going for when I chose this recipe. I had never used cream cheese in lasagna but I'm a total cream cheese nut and didn't want to put in the effort to make the more traditional bechamel sauce. The cream cheese tasted alright although it made the lasagna seem less "Italian" tasting than using bechamel or ricotta. My main problem with it is that cream cheese gets very liquidy when it melts and it was just too wet in the end. I used the no-cook noodles so they should have soaked up a lot of that liquid but there was still too much for me. Als far as the rest of the recipe goes 1/2 pound of sausage is definitely not enough for a 9x13 pan of lasagna IMHO so I doubled the sausage and it seemed odd to put the meat layer on the bottom without any noodles under it to hold it together when you cut it up and serve it so I didn't follow that part. I layered it in my usual fashion. All in all it's not a bad recipe abut I don't think I will do the cream cheese again.

My family really liked this recipe.  It has a good flavor, but I don't like all the cream cheese it.  I think next I will make with 1 package of cream cheese and ricotta cheese.

First time making a lasagna. Husband loved this recipe. I doubled the meat and it wasn't too much at all. One thing I would do differently next time is let the cream cheese soften more or add more milk because it was really hard to spread on the noodles and I would half the amount of cream cheese because it was too rich for me.
