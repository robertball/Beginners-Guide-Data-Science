I thought these nuts were great...but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used less salt, less rosemary and less sugar.I guess less is more...well sometimes: ) I also crushed the rosemary, so it would stick to the nuts better. YUM

Easy and Delicious! Made these for a holiday get-together yesterday.....Rave Reviews from everyone......not a crumb left after the party. One of my guests even suggested that I give boxes of these nuts for Christmas presents!! Will definitely make again.

I was so excited to make this, but it just was too salty and had too much of a rosemary flavor. I made this for a sale we were having at work, I won't be serving it..it is way too salty. I think the traditional method for making honey roasted nuts would be better. I tried to redeem this dish but it just ended up worse....very disappointed :(

This recipe did not work out. 10 minutes burnt the nuts (I can take the blame for that really). But then the butter sugar mix did not stick at all. Never mind that it didn't taste good. Not sure how this worked for people, my attempt was total failure.

After a little experimenting, I found it best to melt the butter to dissolve the sugar and salt (which I reduced greatly), and just threw the Rosemary in there as well. We like things spicy in this house so we added a few dashes of cayenne to the butter, just enough to add a hint of heat. As soon as the nuts come out of the oven, get them into a large bowl and pour the butter mixture over the nuts and Todd thoroughly. The nuts will sizzle and soak up the lovely sauce. Spread them back out onto the baking sheet to cool slightly going a little coarse salt over the top. Serve in a nice dish or wooden bowl.

These turned out so good! I doubled the amount of nuts for the seasonings, because it would have been too much. Also, I just used salt to taste and did not use the directed amount. I will make this for many parties, and gifts to come.

Flavor was delicious but: 1. way too SALTY!, 2. sugar/seasonings didn't stick to nuts due to butter. Made according to recipe except used fresh rosemary as I didn't have dried (weird, I know). I personally loved the rosemary flavor. Will definitely make again; however, next time I will use only 1/2 tbsp salt at most, and no butter. The sugar would stick to the nuts if it weren't for the butter.

I don't know what I did wrong.  It didn't exactly work great for me with the brown sugar sticking to the nuts.  Was still pretty good though.
