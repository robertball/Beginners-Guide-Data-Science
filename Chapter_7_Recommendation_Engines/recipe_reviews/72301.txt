I only made one change in the recipe's ingredients--I used chopped pecans in place of the walnuts. I mixed everything together BUT the cranberries. I baked my granola at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes. When the granola was crisp, I took it out, let it cool and then stirred in the cranberries (The reason I did this was because I've never had luck cooking the raisins/cranberries with the granola. For some reason, they always turn out burned. Now, I just add them after baking). The combination of ingredients in this granola were fantastic--very, VERY good.

Fun & easy to make. I've made this a few times already & usually add raisins.  Great for healthy snack or homemade cereal.  I suggest after baking you spread it on wax paper to allow it to cool & get crunchy.  It might stick on pan as it hardens.

This recipe was a really good starting point. Instead of rolled oats I used Red Mill 5 grain rolled whole grains. I substituted applesauce for the oil and blackstrap molasses for the honey. I also added a mixture of 1 tablespoon flaxseed (ground) and 3 tablespoons of water, which acts like an egg to bind the ingredients. I did not have any cranberries so I used raisins and for the nuts i used a mix of almonds, pistachios, and walnuts. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg. Delicious, nutritious, and highly recommended! I will definitely be making this regularly.

This was a very easy granola recipe, and it tastes better than any granola I have purchased!  I added sunflower seeds since I had some on hand.  YUMMY!

I love this granola. I didn't have wheat germ so I ground up some flax seed in my coffee grinder, great replacement and very good for you too.  I also cooked it in a 9x13 baking dish with higher sides so it was easier to stir with less chance of spilling. I do think this added some cook time because it wasn't all in a thin layer, but all in all I think I added about 15 extra minutes. A definate staple recipe in my house.

I wasn't going to make this because I didn't think there was any way it could be that much better than store-bought granola to make it worth the extra effort.  Even right after making it, I was not impressed.  But it is really delicious, better than store-bought granola, not to mention the fact that I know exactly what went into it and can always adjust the ingredients as I see fit.  Not that I think I will make any adjustments as it was pretty perfect as it is.

Flavor was good but DO NOT put cranberries in before you cook.  They turn out dry and hard.

This was good!  I only used about a cup of honey, and it was sweet enough for me.  If you like bigger clumps of granola, try pressing it down into the pan before you bake it, and don't stir it while it's cooking.

I love homemade granola ....and this recipe is so good. I had no wheat germ left so I subbed with ground flax seed....also subbed the walnuts for shredded coconut. Used sliced almonds instead of chopped. Decreased the honey to 1/2c and only used 2tblspns of olive oil, 2tsps of vanilla and 2tspns of cinnamon.  I added the dried cranberries after the granola is cooked. I folded them into the hot granola and let everything cool on my cookie sheet. Thanks for a tasty granola!

I was very happy with the way this turned out.  I've made granola before, but other recipes I've tried took a lot more time and made a big mess. This was really simple and it came out great.  I baked it on parchment paper & had no mess at all.  I used mostly applesauce with a little coconut oil and added ground flaxseed.   This will be the granola recipe I use from now on. Thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic recipe! I mix different things into it every time! You can adjust the moisture level by reducing the honey so it in later weeks it will be less sticky.

this was my first attempt at making granola. i mixed everything together in one big bowl. i added sunflower seeds and substituted cashews for the almonds. mine turned out more like cereal than granola. it didn't clump together and make clusters like i was expecting. tasty and easy though!

Easy & tasty!  Cooking time was about 50 minutes for me because there was so much granola on the sheet.  Next time I'll spread it over two sheets instead of one.

This is very easy and wonderful.  Used applesauce instead of honey.  Added sunflower seeds, flaxseed and pecans.  This recipe is very flexible to suit your likes and dislikes.  Also included some almond flavoring.  Only question:  Does this need to be refridgerated?

I have been looking for a granola recipe that tasted like the granola my mom made in the 1970's - This was it!  This is a great recipe that I will use over and over!

The first granola I have ever made and the best I have ever tasted. Good ratio of honey, oil and oats/nuts and good basic recipe to play around with.

I think 30 minutes is too long. I checked the granola after putting it in the oven for 30 minutes (and stirring every 10 minutes), and it was almost burnt! However, I did make one change: applesauce for the oil. Maybe that was the reason? I would still make this again, except I would take it out a little earlier. I also baked it on parchment paper = easier cleanup!

I enjoyed this granola very much.  My husband, however, thought it had an "odd" after-taste.  Not quite sure what it was ... the oil maybe?  I will try again with a fresh bottle of oil.

This granola has a nice balance. As other noted, don't add dried fruit before baking any granola. You should always sprinkle it in after it comes out of the oven and is cooling in the pan. I liked the taste of the wheat germ in this. Only change I would make it probably do just a cup of honey. I felt it was a little much.

This recipe is great!  For ease I bought containers of mixed nuts, seeds and fruit at the grocery store (pumpkin seeds, dried fruit, cashews, almonds).   Then, I added the  4 cups of oats and made up the other 3 1/2 cups of ingredients with the pre-made mixes i had bought and some other stuff around the kitchen.  I found that coconut flakes are so good in this granola and chia seeds add some nice protein.  I'd also recommend lightly greasing your pan with a little spray of pam and spraying your spoon so the granola doesn't stick when you stir it around.  For a little extra flavor, a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg worked really well.  Anyways, I'd recommend serving this on top of a smoothie or yogurt to add the perfect amount of sweetness!  Overall this recipe is easy, super tasty and a good deal! 

ALSO! you definitely want to dump it onto a sheet of parchment as soon as it comes out of the oven and wash the pan immediately or else you will be scraping it off and making oats fly all over the kitchen.

I made this without oil by substituting ground flax seed (the conversion for this is printed on the flax seed packaging, but generally I've found it to be 3tbsp flax for each tbsp of oil). I also doubled the vanilla and the cinnamon, and added 1tbsp of raw hemp seed,and I didn't add the cranberries until after it was cool.
