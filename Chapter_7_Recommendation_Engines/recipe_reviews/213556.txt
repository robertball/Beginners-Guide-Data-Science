This is the best recipe I have found on this site & I have been using AllRecipes for 5 years now.  I made a few minor changes to substitute for ingredients I did not have & it still came out great. DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing it!

This recipe is my absolute favorite! I tried so many shrimp and grits recipes trying to get the right one, and then, voila, Natasha brought this jem of a recipe into my life. It has been the rave of every dinner engagement I've brought it too. 

For the sake of time and access to ingredients, I have made a few modifications:
1) I use chicken and beef stock instead of veal (still delicious)
2) I boil down the shrimp shells in a little water and make my own broth to add to the mix
3) I don't bake the grits. Nor do I add eggs to them. One of these days, however, I would like to try it.

tI thought this was a bit time-consuming to prepare, maybe I'm just a slow chopper, but I thought it was absolutely superb at the end! Just don't attempt to start making this if you have company coming in an hour. I didn't have clarified butter, so I just successfully used regular butter & I used a carton of seafood stock, instead of the other stocks listed. Will make again for sure. Thanks you for posting this culinary winner!

Wow! So good! I rarely review, but this one was worth it! Only made two changes (1) I didnâ€™t have, now did I feel like buying veal stock, so I used Beef Stock; and (2) my local fine foods market happened to have morel mushrooms soaked in Burgandy Wine, so rather than a total 1/2 pound of a variety of mushrooms, I used 1/2 pound of the Burgandy Wine soaked mushrooms,

Absolutely the best shrimp and grits recipe I have ever tried/made/eaten/served! I am craving it right now but I am out of shrimp. Someone mentioned that they did not "have any clarified butter" Huh? You MAKE clarified butter. I don't think you can buy it but who knows. You just melt the butter and skim off the milk solids and what you have left is clarified butter. It does not burn easily when you clarify it cause milk solids are what burn. Wonderful! Thanks for posting this!!
