This was SO yummy! We used it to dip stir-fried chicken and veggies because we can't eat soy or wheat or tomato but it would also be great thinned and tossed with pasta. I did 1/4c butter and 1/4c oil to get some omega's in our diet. I didn't have green onions so I used white and it was delicious! A new favorite.

I cut the recipe in half, left out the onions, used ginger-in-a-tube, & used fresh instead of dried basil (didn't add it until the end of the cook time so it wouldn't  cook the flavor out). All I have to say is... How in the world did y'all keep your cheese from forming a huge clump? As soon as I added it, it locked onto the ginger, basil & garlic & it all formed one big, gooey clump, in a pool of melted butter. :o( I whisked & whisked but never got it anywhere near "well-blended". I used fresh parmesan grated fine in my food processor, so it was very similiar in texture to the stuff in the can...maybe that was the problem. I liked the flavor combo  so I'll try it another time but I'll just grate the cheese on top of the  sauce after plating.

I made this sauce for spagetti squash & spaghettini pasta mixed together.  It was light, flavourful & deliciously simple to make.  It's one of my favorite pasta sauces to make!

Truly nice flavor combination.  I wasn't sure about mixing parmesan and ginger, but the cooking allows the cheese to take on a wonderfully nutty taste, which combines well with the ginger.  Mixed the sauce with soba noodles and cooked shrimp: delicious (I did not use the full amount of butter, but cut it in half and thinned the sauce with shrimp stock.)

We loved this!  I did blend it in a blender - (only because my husband can't stand consistancy of sauteed onions).  It ended up looking like a pesto sauce.  It was fantastic!

Good simple sauce! Next time I would try doing less butter and using oil. It does have a nice bite to it and a spicy kick from the ginger & red pepper flakes. I served it over some pierogies filled with cheese and potatoes. Really good. Great for dipping some crusty bread in as well.

First, I didn't have fresh ginger. I used a teaspoon of grated ginger. Maybe that affected the taste because this was way too peppery. I added a double dose of parmesan,1/2 cup of mozzerella, and a dash of milk to thin the pepper out. It wasn't bad but next time I'll put way less pepper in.
