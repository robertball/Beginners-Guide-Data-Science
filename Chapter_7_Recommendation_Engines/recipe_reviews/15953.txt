This is a great recipe (from Hershey's Kitchens)...I was a little concerned that the kisses would leak through the dough using a scant tablespoon...but they baked beautifully with no leaks at all. I didn't roll these in powdered sugar because I thought the flavor of the dough and the sweet center balanced each other very nicely.

Fantastic! One person at our cookie exchange was almost speechless, and finally smiled and said, with enthusiasm, "this is so good it's ridiculous!" I loved the way the candy kisses stayed soft inside the rich chocolate cookie. I had to agree with my fellow cookie exchanger. I will definitely make again.

This was a huge hit at our Teacher Appreciation Tea.  The great thing was that the room was so warm that the Kisses melted again in the classroom we were using.  Also to make it extra rich I added dark chocolate kisses versus the regular kind.

These are a great cookie to make with kids! My stepsons loved getting thier hands messy and "hiding" kisses inside. I did use more than a tablespoon for each, but it was all the same. Tasted great- nice texture. I used mint kisses- nice combination with the powdered sugar. A fun and yummy cookie!

I found these pretty easy to make and didn't have any problems rolling the dough around the Kisses.  They just weren't hugely popular around this house, and just a warning, these are very messy when the kids eat them.  Powdered sugar, crumbly chocolate cookie...

I had these years ago and was looking for the recipe.  These are excellent cookies with a unique taste. They are so delicious I have to make them for people...definitely worth a try and a great item to add on to your Christmas baking!! (I don't like nuts, so I did without.  They turned out fine).

I got complements on these cookies, and they were relatively easy to make as well as pretty to present.  I liked the pecans. BUT the cookie part was super crumbly and had a strange texture.  I won't make these again.

I wasn't so fond of these. The cookie part had a weird taste, and I had to accompany them with a big glass of something to wash the taste down. They were better warm, fresh out of the oven, than they were once they had cooled/sat in my cookie jar a few hours....

I made this cookie for my son who is 14 and loves anything chocolate.  He did not like this cookie and neither did I or my daughter.  Would not recommend - a big disappointment

I don't think my husband would give less than 5 stars to any cookie. But I let him decide since I don't eat the cookies. Surprisingly enough you can make these with your children, my 6 & 3 year old caught on really quick how to wrap the kisses.

I thought the flavor was great but it was pretty crumbly and dry. Wonder if anyone else had that issue? Because of that factor alone, I probably won't make them again.

Really not too fond of this recipe. The dough was crumbly and difficult to wrap around the kisses, and then i only ended up with enough dough to cover some of them….I still had 2 dozen kisses left! Now they're just unwrapped sitting in a container. I was even trying to use a tablespoon for every one, as it suggests. Maybe it's partly because I didn't add the nuts, so it was a cup less volume? Not sure. This just wasn't my favorite.

My friend made these cookies at Christmas and they were wonderful, the chocolate inside remained soft with the outside nice and cookie like.  I made them and they were crumbly and the chocolate inside was hard.  I followed the recipe to the T except I substituted dark cocoa which I didn't think would make a difference. My rating is for what I made, my friend's would get a 5 star.

This was easy to make. Not my favorite cookie but liked it all the same. Made it for my daughters wedding and people enjoyed them.
