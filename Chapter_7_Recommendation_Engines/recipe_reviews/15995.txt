This is a flavorful crust, perfectly suited to fruit pies. My only criticism is that it makes ALMOST enough for two, 2-crust pies...but not QUITE enough. This recipe as written, in my view, would make 3-single crust pie crusts. It was a stretch to make two double-crust pies, and I think this would have been particularly difficult for a novice baker. It would be better had the recipe indicated the yield.

I've recently entered the world of pie making and this was my first pie crust ever (with my first apple pie - Grandma Ople's found in Allrecipes as well). I've heard so many horror stories and thought I'd just use the store bought ready made dough that you just lay in a pan and bake - it was good (enough) when I used it for my first pie (pecan). But my friend urged me to just try to roll out my own. And,  I am no longer afraid! This was so easy to make and handle, and I am still shocked it came out so pretty (I posted a pic). I used butter flavor Crisco shortening as suggested and brushed the pie with lightly beaten egg before baking. Crust was super flaky, but sturdy enough. I am going to use this again and again - have plans for a pot pie dinner using this crust. (I do agree this recipe only makes enough for 1 double crust and 1 single crust pie. I'm making another pecan with the single crust I have left.) Anyone want the remaining ready-made pie crust I have in the freezer? :-) EDIT: I've now made 5 pies using this crust - and EVERYONE raves about this crust. I'm SO happy that I used this in my first attempts with pie crust because I don't need to keep trying recipes. Seriously, I'm not even a bread/crust person but i CRAVE this pie crust! A pie crust CAN totally make a pie!

This makes a very tender, flaky and flavorful crust. I had used the same pie crust recipe for 25 years with only good results and compliments. Very similar, but mine did not include the egg.  But I like to try new things sometimes, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  Now, I will be using this recipe all the time.  

I found that since my eggs were extra large, I did not need to add all the liquid.  Next time I will beat the egg into only 1/4 cup ice water, sprinkle into the flour mixture, mix lightly and then add more ice water, if needed. 

Thank you for posting!

This crust is simply perfect! The first time I tried it, I had no shortening on hand and so I used unsalted butter instead. The result was a very nice flaky crust. The second time around I used animal shortening (the vegetable kind is not available in the country I live in and I personally don't use it anyway because it is simply so bad for you). The crust came out perfect! It was very flaky and so very tasty! I tried other recipes but the difference with this recipe is the 3 tablespoons of sugar and the egg: this gives the crust a nice flavor, just perfect for fruit pies! I was able to roll it out pretty thin (0.2-0.3 inches) and so I got two 11" crusts and one lattice top out of the dough the recipe yielded. I used my dough roller to pick up the crust and lay in my extra large pie pans and it worked pretty well as long as I was quick to transfer. The crust baked nice and golden and the pies looked great. I wanted to make a note of the difference between the crust made with butter and the one made with shortening. The one made with shortening is definitely flakier, but if you don't have shortening or don't like using it, you can safely use unsalted butter instead. The crust made with butter is slightly denser and tends to harden a bit after a day, but the difference is not so big as to discourage you from using butter in your recipe. Besides, who would want to let the pie stay on the shelf for so long? We gobble up ours as soon as it is cool enough to eat!

Ruth's Grandma and I must have been related.  I use this recipe and love it - I also divide the crust (if not using all), wrap in plastic wrap and put in freezer bag for later use.  Good to have on hand!

I made a peach pie with this crust recipe, and everyone raved about it!  I used butter-flavored shortening, and the crust was tender and flaky.  The total baking time for my double crust pie was around 46 minutes.  This has gone into my recipe box!

I don't often remember to come back and rate and/or review recipes after I print them out and make them. I either like them and add them to a pile of recipes that I occasionally make (the pile of recipes for an excess of some fruit or veggie, the need something special for guests, or recipes for party food, etc. OR I don't like it and toss it. But this recipe is one that is do good, I simply couldn't NOT come on the site and rave about it. The recipe is perfect as it. Don't touch it, don't mess with it. Period. I have never been able to make a good pie crust ever. I always seemed to mess it up and make it too dry or too mushy, no matter how careful I was about adding the water a teaspoon at a time. This recipe is the best thing I have ever seen in terms of foolproof. If you take this recipe and just add everything and follow the directions, you will have the best pie crust you have ever tasted. Add to that the fact that it is by far and away the BEST tasting pie crust I have ever eaten (and I have french grandmothers and have lived in Italian bakery neighborhoods of NYC) bar none. If you are reading this, throw away every pie crust recipe you have and put this one in your heirloom recipe book. And then thank the lady who submitted this!!

Awesome awesome awesome awesome! I will never use another recipe. I followed the recipe and the crust was easily the best I've had in my life (and I've had a lot of pie in my day) Helpful tip of the day! Freeze your butter/shortening, then grate it into the flour mixture. The little pieces are the perfect size and you don't have to fuss with it! The frozen bits don't get creamed into the flour so the pastry puffs up perfectly!

Absolutely Fabulous! Sugar gives the crust a great crunch and makes sure it isn't tasteless like some other recipes i've tried! Try it!

Wow, was this wonderful! I had never made a successful pie crust, but I needed two for the Chicken Pot Pie IX. This recipe works! My mom-in-law has made MANY wonderful pie crusts, and she advised me to use 2/3 butter : 1/3 shortening for a flaky crust when I told her I didn't want to use so much shortening (she learned this from a chemist). So changed the shortening to 1 1/4 butter + 1/2 cup Crisco. This made 2 full pie crusts, but it looked a bit short for a third crust. It turned out light, flaky and a wonderful flavor. Enjoy!

Simply THE best pie crust! It's easy to throw together, easy to handle, tastes yummy, and looks beautiful, turning a nice golden brown. I do agree with some, concerning the odd amount of dough the recipe produces. I ended up just making my French apple pie's crust a little thicker. The crust is satisfyingly flakey and 'authentic,' but for those who are making a pie with little filling, it would be best not to use to much, otherwise this crust could overwhelm the flavor. just stick the leftovers in the freezer and your all set for next time!

This pie crust is fantastic!  I was sceptical the first time I made it because of the amount of liquid it called for, but it is perfect!  It is very important to make it ahead of time though, because it does need to chill in the fridge in order to make it workable.  I divide the dough into 2 balls and wrap them in plastic wrap then place in the fridge.  If I am short on time, I will put them in the freezer for a few minutes before attempting to roll it out.  Also, be sure to roll it out between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, lightly floured.  This will be very helpful when it comes time to transfer the crust to the pie plate.

The best pie crust ever. Be sure to let crust rest 30 min in fridge before rolling out, and another 30 min in the fridge after you get it in the pans and before you fill. :)

Great flaky crust!  My husband is quite picky when it comes to pie crusts but this one he had nothing but good things to say about it.  This will be the recipe I use from now on!  Thank you!

Delicious and flakey. You can NOT prebake the crust with this recipe with the high shortening content it will melt in your pan. Keep it cold.

I rated this recipe with only four stars because it doesn't give baking times or suggestions.  I baked mine at 425 for 15 minutes and then turned the heat down to 325 (fahrenheit) for an additional 30 minutes.  The bottom of my crust came out doughy instead of firm and flaky which I would've liked.  Aside from this the recipe was great!  Thanks for sharing.

I have been making pies for 45 years(started cooking in wheat harvest when I got married), and was making what I thought was a very good crust. Everyone loves my pies. I had a dinner party last night, so I decided to try Ruth's Grandma's Crust. WOW! It was fantastic. I have never used egg in my crust before, but I love to try new receipes so I went for it. I made a Banana Cream and a Chocolate Cream Pie. My sister who also makes great pies and crust, had to have the receipe. Everyone raved about how good the crust was. I guess I will have to use Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust from now on.
Thanks so much for sharing this receipe.

My favorite.  very easy, very fast, and very tender.  I use it for anything that requires a pie crust.  Make sure you dont over work the dough.  I just rake my fingers through it until it is mixed and then plop it in a gallon sized zipper bag to refrigerate it.  Then I knead it in the bag plop it on the counter and roll.  wonderful results every time!

This is the PERFECT recipe for pie crust. I used it for chicken pot pie last knight and it was the best pie ever! I tried many recipes por crust pie trough the years and this is THE recipe. This crust is flaky and when you put it in your mouth it melts. The flavour is buttery yummy. I had 1/2 cup of shortening so I used butter for the rest and it was great. The best part is that it looks so preatty once baked.
Other people said that the dough comes out to wet and it is hard to handle. Where I live is very dry so I usually when I make doughs I do not use all the flour that calls for , but if you live in a humid area you probably should use a little bit less of the liquid that calls for if it is to sticky, so just add little by little the liquid ensted of all at once.
Be shure to put a big pice of wax paper on the counter top so you can roll the dough much more easy, and do not be afraid to use flour under your dough when you are rolling so it do not stick to the paper.
Thanks so , so , so much for this recipe.

If I could give this more stars I would. I have tried making pie crusts a few times, with no success. I am proud to say that I have finally found my forever pie crust recipe. That's a big statement isn't it?! Well first a big thank-you to Ruth's Grandma for perfecting a crust. Normally I use recipe as a guideline and make quite a few changes along the way. I didn't change anything about this, I was tempted to use butter but stuck with the shortening:D I also did make sure the water was ice cold (put in freezer for about 1/2 hour). I actually found that the consistency was easy to work with, only put in the fridge for about 1 hour before rolling out. Also a tip is not to overwork dough. Trust me it will come together when rolled. I filled the crust with a lovely fresh blackberry pie. Hope this helps some people out there!

What can I say, I've never seen better reviews for a recipe on this site.  I think any time that I make pie crust, there must be a black cloud hanging over my head.  My pie crust skills must be lacking because I always have problems, and yesterday's pie crust was no exception.  I followed the instructions but even after chilling the dough for several hours, it was very soft, a little sticky, and difficult to handle.  But somehow I managed to make it work, and ended up with an absolutely flaky delicious crust.  I look forward to the day when I will mix up a pie crust, roll it out, and put in the dish with NO problems.  My quest for the perfect crust continues.

3 stars for incomplete directions. Iced water is a must! And knowing the size of the egg used, would be helpful. I think the problem some are having, with sticky dough, may be in the way the flour is measured. If you use the scoop and level method, you'll have more flour than you would if you spoon and level. Not knowing the method used by the recipe submitter, poses a problem. Also you can't assume that if you used 1/2 cup water one day, that you'll need 1/2 cup the next time you make the same recipe.  Your dough will need more/less liquid, depending on the dryness/humidity of the day. ALWAYS add liquid AS NEEDED to obtain desired the consistency.

Very easy to make, tasted good. Recipe needs to specify to use ice water and to refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling. Also make sure you blend in the shortening as little as possible so that you can still see small chunks of it. Don't over mix, will make for a tough crust.

I can't believe how much of a difference the crust makes on a pie!  It completely changes the taste.  This was my first time making pie crust.  I've always been, well, afraid.  Rolling out the dough always looked so intimating to me.  I envisioned dough sticking to the rolling pin, dough sticking to the counter, dough sticking instead of stretching into a roundish shape.  However, this really is no fail (if I can do it...).  I needed more information that just a recipe so I followed the step by step instructions on the following link, but used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

This is the BEST pie crust recipe I have ever made!  I halved the recipe and had no trouble getting a double crust for a standard 9 inch pie dish.  It made my rhubarb pie shine.  Thank you for sharing.

I'm adding my voice to the accolades for this recipe.  Another reviewer said it almost made enough for two pies.  I got more than that.  With this one batch, I made 24 mini butter tarts, which I baked right away, plus two and a half 8" pie shells which I've frozen for another day.  Excellent recipe and easier to deal with than my previous favourite which came from Fluffo.   Ruth's Grandma's is the one I'll stay with from now on.  Update: Dec 22 - used this recipe again and it yielded 8 full tart shells, plus several cheese straws which I made from the scraps.  Put the scraps in the mixer, added about 1 tbsp water (depends on how dry the scraps are), 1/2 c. grated cheese,(could add some seasoning salt) blended well,formed into strips,and baked.

This is my favorite pie crust.  The flavor and texture are perfect. I like to use butter flavor Crisco, which makes it both flaky and tender.  As some of the other reviewers have said, it is difficult to get four crusts out of this.  I use it for one single crust pie (like pumpkin) and one double crust pie (like apple or cherry). It works fantastically for both.

Very flaky pie crust.  For those who've commented that this crust is too crumbly before baked...it is supposed to be.  Otherwise, your crust will not be flaky.  Do not be turned off by this; just be patient.  I do live in an arid environment so I had to add a small amount of extra water (use a water bottle to spritz - think Alton Brown) maybe equivalent to 1 1/2 teaspoons since my flour is on the drier side.  I am glad I read the reviews as this DOES NOT make four crusts.  You do have to work to get three out of this recipe.  Keep this in mind when planning.

Wasn't quite sure how I was going to rate this crust... As a few said, it was sticky rolling out and the first pie I made, the crust tore in several places.  With the second pie (the recipe JUST about makes two double pies) one 9 1/2" one 8 1/2" for me, I was more generous flouring the waxed paper I used to rolled the crust and it rolled beautifully.  Did not stick this time when I turned it into the pie plate.  I melted a little preserves and brushed the bottom of shell before adding filling.  When top of crust was added, I brushed the top with a little milk, then sprinkled top with cinnamon & sugar.  Keep edges covered with foil because at 425, it was the first to be done.  What won me over was the taste.  Flaky and tasty.  Will be using this one again and again.

This was very easy and tasty.  It makes a total of 4 pie crusts, enough for 2 pot pies.  I didn't have shortening and used 3 sticks of butter softened instead.  I baked as my recipe call for.  Perfect.

Best pie crust I've ever tasted. I'm saving this for all future pies. It's not hard to see why it's lasted 100+ years. I substituted lard for shortening, because it's much healthier for you (surprise, surprise, who'd have thought) and I like the texture better. This is just perfect. I doubt it can be improved upon.

I don't understand how this recipe was reviewed so highly! I do not agree! I followed everything to the word and had everything cold but it didn't turn out well at all. It was greasy to say the least. It was crumbly and fell apart after cooked. It was not too hard to work with, all pastry is delicate and I know that so I was careful. I just did not like the end product. It lacked flavor and completely fell apart. It may be a case of the the cook not the recipe, but this isn't my first pie by any means and I have never had this problem. Too much shortening.

This is the worst recipe I have ever used. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it sadly disappointed me. I was on a time limit and ended up having to use pre-made pie crust from Pillsbury. Luckily, my pie turned out fine no help to this recipe. I only put a star there because I have to, or else I wouldn't give it any stars at all.

I have tried many pie crusts in the past, this is by far the best. Easy to work with, also works well for decorating (does not crumble). Great taste and perfect for just about any pie filling. Thank you for sharing

This is the first time I have ever used egg or sugar in my crust and it was perfect for a peach pie!  The crust came out tender and flaky and absorbed just the right amount of juice while still saying crisp and not soggy.  

The amount of water/egg liquid was pretty close but I didn't use all of it...so use your best judgment when adding it.  The crust did chill well and rolled out beautifully.  I even re-rolled the left overs to make a second mini-pie and it didn't get tough or overworked.  

I think I found my new favorite crust!

Made this pie crust this past Sunday for dinner, and it was by far the best tasting and easiest to handle crust out there. I've always been in search of something similar to my grandma's crust, and sorry grandma...but this one is better! There would be enough dough for 1 whole pie (bottom and cover) and then a second base...think lemon meringue pie. You might even be able to stretch it a bit for a lattice pie top, but it's difficult if you don't want your crusts paper thin.

I read the reviews and they convinced me to make this pie crust instead of my usual one. If you want a mold-able pie crust that can be scuplted well, this deserves 5 stars. If you want a "short" (buttery) flaky melt-in-your-mouth crust, skip this recipe! It has the taste and texture of paper mache. I was so disappointed in it that I joined this site so I could place a word of warning for others before they waste good butter on it! I'm going back to twice the flour as cold butter and as little ice water and handling as possible. It's more work, as you MUST wind the flattened dough circle around your rolling pin or it will break and tear before you get it into the pan (it is very delicate) but at least it tastes good. Come to think of it, I don't believe that it is possible to get buttery tasting, flaky pie crust from an egg and that much water.

I used this crust with the Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and won first place! I did add a bit of flavored coffee creamer to the mixture for a bit more taste and had many comments about how great the crust tasted.

I've made this recipe twice - once with shortening and once with butter.  Both came out great, although I think I prefer the shortening version.  It was a bit flakier and tasted sweeter for some reason.  I made a blueberry pie and got compliments on the crust.  Definitely a keeper!

This turned out beautifully. I used butter-flavored shortening and replaced 1/2 cup of the shortening with butter, because I love that buttery taste in a pie crust. I don't think it really needs 3 T of sugar if you are making a very sweet filling, but it's fine for most fruit pies. Be sure to chill your crust in the refrigerator, because it makes a huge difference in ease of handling, as well as the flakiness of the finished crust.

Very flaky and light crust, also easy to repair if you accidentaly tear it while putting into pie pan.  I used this pie crust recipe with the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople found on this website.  The combination of these two recipes is fantastic.  Makes it look and taste like it came from a restaurant or store that makes them all the time.  For those who are having trouble with enough crust, roll the crust mixture between two sheets of wax paper with a rolling pin.  Then apply it to the pie pan.  This will yield enough for two pie pan bottoms and two lattice tops.  Depending on how thin you roll it you may have leftovers.  This pie crust once baked is quite strong and will not leak any pie filling before it is ready to be eaten.  So you don't have to make the crust on pie so thick on the bottom.

This is exactly the pie crust I use, except that I mix 1 tablespoon of vinegar to the egg/cold water mix before adding to the other ingredients, and just 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I had never made pie crust before I got this recipe from a great-grandma.  I found this to be very easy to make as a novice.  It is good with either sweet or savory pies.  I use the butter flavored shortening.  To the reviewer who said she only got 3 single crusts, I find that I get 4 generous crusts, and can even stretch it to 5 from this same recipe.  Everyone loves this crust recipe.  I freeze them, and have even nuked them in microwave a bit if I needed to thaw them quickly.

best crust I've ever made or had. I used 1/2 cup of cold salted butter and 1 and 1/4 cups of shortening instead of all shortening. 

I used this crust for a chicken pot pie. Outstanding.

Haven't witnessed the finished product yet, but I will say that this was the MOST DIFFICULT pie pastry that I have ever worked with. It was way too wet; impossible to get into the pie pan...I finally just pressed pieces together to make it work.  I worked in an extra cup of flour and it was still difficult...tears too easily.

I felt this crust tasted to much like shortening.  I think maybe you need to use butter or butter flavored crisco ( I have never used the stuff, so I don't really know how much difference it makes).  Also the recipe didn't say to use ice water and just said to chill until ready to use.  Well, I thought the dough was way to sticky to roll out.  Maybe there needs to be a minimum amount of time needed to chill.  I only waited about 20 mins.  Next time I'll try the changes.

I DID IT! My first ever pie crust and everyone said this was the one to try. Fantastic, tender and flaky. Will be making lots of pies now...no more frozen store bought crusts for me. Thanks for a great no-fail recipe.

Awesome pie crust recipe! But I have to agree that it's a huge error to leave out that the water needs to be ICE water for a flaky crust. Experienced bakers will know this, but novice bakers might not and that will affect the outcome of the crust.
Yes, this recipe does yield an odd amount of crust, but just take the leftovers, roll out to about 1/4 to 1/8 inch thickness and brush with melted butter. Take a pizza cutter or sharp knife and cut dough into triangles. Place on cookie sheet lined with parchment or aluminum foil. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake in a 350 (or 375) degree oven for about 10 - 15 minutes or until golden and baked through. Let cool slightly and enjoy. Delicious!!

Delicious!!! I try to stay away from using shortening, but when it comes to pie crust I just have not found anything that makes crusts so well. This recipe is awesome. I have never had much luck making pie crust; it is always too dry or something, and never looks nice. I have made this several times, first for cherry pie, and second for chicken pot pie. I just love it, and it will be my favorite recipe from now on. I don't even worry about having cold shortening and water. I just mix it all together and roll it out right away; no fuss!

This crust was amazing.  I've never made such perfect crust that tastes so good and is so flavorful.  And I made mistakes!  It was still delicious.  I added all the liquid instead of seeing how much was necessary.  it was hard to roll out but came out great!  I also didn't use chilled water or shortening.  I will next time, but still it came out great!  Really is fail-safe!

Best pie crust ever! When I made it the first time,I didn't have enough shortening to complete the recipe so  substituted half the amount with butter. Came out perfect! I have also made it with butter flavored shortening and that is great too. I found that it makes enough for 1 double crust and 1 single.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was HEAVENLY! Tip to the new ones on pie crust - roll out dough between two pieces of wax paper and peel off one piece in order to work dough into pie plate.

I would give this recipe 0 stars but it actually tastes OK (raw). It was super hard to work with. It was really sticky and without HEAVILY flouring my workspace and my rolling pin I couldn't get it into the pie plate. Once heavily floured, it made it really really crumbly. My pie is baking right now and needless to say, it does not look pretty at all. It is pretty much the ugliest pie I have ever made. We'll see how it tastes once it's done baking. Even if it tastes great, it's really just too difficult. Maybe there are some more instructions they left out? I followed it to the letter.

The taste of this crust is amazing. I used the butter flavor crisco as some of the other reviewers suggested, for a rhubarb pie. I did use cold water and refrigerated it for an hr, however it's the middle of August and my kitchen was sweltering hot...making the dough impossible to work with. It stuck to everything and I couldn't get it to roll out right. I am going to try this one again, but it was not the easiest dough to handle.

This is a delicious recipe for pie crust.  For the people mentioning about the crust not being enough for two pies: you are right, but all I did was increase the servings to 36 and used the ingredients based on that.  That calculation made enough for two pies and I had no problems getting it rolled out for two pies.

In my point of view, this recipe had it all.  Flavor, ease of working with and looks.  I used butter flavored shortening.  I chilled my shortening in the freezer and also used ice cold water.  Let is rest in the fridge until ready to use.  I always roll my crust on parchment or wax paper and put the dish over once it is rolled and turned it over and carefully remove the paper.  Like others have mentioned it didn't quite make 4 proportionate size crusts.  The last one was on the short side but I made it work for lattice tops.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Barbara!

First time making my own crust. This was so easy and so good. I made apple pie and even the bottom crust was not soggy and tastes good! It did ration out to enough for 4 crusts for me. I made it a day ahead, plastic wrapped, put in a quart bag, and refrigerated. Then left it out awhile to soften the next day. I put half in the freezer for another time.

I have used a very similar recipe (my grandmothers!).  For those who say it makes too much for a double crust pie, use 3 cups flour, 1 1/3 cups shortening, 5 tablespoons water & 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1 egg.  I don't use sugar in my crust, but if it is a fruit pie, I will sprinkle the sugar on top.  I usually do not even put the dough into the refrigerator. I just roll it out on a floured board!  It always comes out beautifully!

I've used the refrigerated pie crusts for my pies for years because I just couldn't find a recipe that was any better, but now I can leave the pre-packaged pie crusts in the store, I have finally found the best pie crust recipe!  My whole family agrees...this is now the only pie crust I will ever use.   Thank you for sharing this!

I'm truly awful at making pie crusts but now that I've tried this recipe I feel redeemed, pie crusts are no longer my enemy. I used this along with Grandma Opels Apple Pie recipe from this site. My boyfriend was disappointed that I didn't make a graham cracker crust but after tasting it he's a convert. The only modification I made was to use butter flavored shortening. The texture of the crust was buttery and flaky with a hint of sweetness. As others have mentioned you'll end up with an odd amount of leftover dough but I didn't find this to be an issue, more for me to snack on.

This was my first ever pie crust, and it worked beautifully.  I'd been warned that making pie crust dough was really tricky, but this turned out great.  I had no problems with it being too wet or dry.  I just chilled the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours before making the pie.  I also don't have a pastry cutter, so I just used a fork to mix the shortening into the flour mixture.  One more tip: I used 1/4 C water and 1/4C apple cider, which makes the dough more flaky - it was a trick my grandmother always used.

I made this crust for a chocolate pecan and pumpkin pecan pie for my husband to take to work. Although I have not tried it, my husband and his co-workers RAVED over how flaky this crust is, and it was so simple to make. This is the first crust I have "mastered" and it is definitely a keeper. I will be trying it on Thanksgiving day - thank you for the recipe!

This pie crust is excellent.  It was my first attempt at a homemade pie crust, and it turned out perfectly.  I don't even own a rolling pin - I had my boyfriend roll it into a ball and flatten it with his own hands.  Also, his aunt, who is a very good cook, said she wished she could make a pie crust like this.

Here's my scratch pie crust recipe that I have used for over forty years: 5 cups flour 1 tsp. salt 1 pkg (1 lb.) lard 1 egg mixed with 1 tsp. white vinegar plus enough water to make one cup of liquid 4 T. baking powder     This can be stored in the fridge for a week or so or in the fridge for up to six months.       Makes a very flaky pie...remember when making a single shell pie to put some dried beans in the pie shell while it is baking.

I have not tried this recipe yet but I have a suggestion for the issue of the dough being enough for 1 double crust and 1 single crust pie.  Try using that extra bit of pie crust from this recipe for a cinnamon "tart".
My sons never liked pie but they LOVED the crust with cinnamon sugar.  So when I would make pie, I would make extra crust, roll it out, spread butter on it, sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar. Fold the dough in half and crimp the edges with a fork, poke some holes in the top and place on a baking sheet.  Bake for 15 minutes and voila - a cinnamon pie to make the boys happy.  So yummy!

The crust tasted great (I used it for pot pie), but I wasn't able to roll it w/out it sticking or ripping.  I may have done something wrong. I'm sure I'll make it again and give it another try.

the recipe is super easy. the pastry cutter is a must. the rolling and the manipulation is time consuming. it does make enough for 3 pies, but its easier to have more than less so i didnt see it as a problem.

This crust was definitely flaky.  However, I could tell when I was mixing up the dough that the recipe calls for too much shortening.  The crust ended up with a flavor that was too greasy, fatty.  I had never made a crust that called for an egg, but I decided to give it a try.  This dough tends to tear very easily, and I am NOT a beginner at baking and rolling out pie crusts.  I tried the Pie Crust IV on this site and it's the most like my mothers growing up - flaky, very easy to manage and roll out, very forgiving and just perfect taste and texture.

The taste was good but I found the dough hard to work with. I kept the dough chilled at all times but still had trouble with it tearing when I tried to place it in the pan. Still prefer the Best Ever Pie crust recipe.

Tips *Get a food scale and weigh out four, ten ounce balls. *Place each on parchment paper or waxed paper and top with another sheet to roll dough out. *You can freeze ahead of time, and use it as needed.

I just made an apple crumb pie and a pecan pie using this crust and it was wonderful.  I added a little more flour when I rolled it out as mine was pretty soft but it turned out great.  My judge is what do the leftover scraps taste like when I put cinnamon and sugar on them and bake them on a cookie sheet while the pie is baking - light, crisp, and great flavor.  I have a new pie crust recipe!!!

while this crust is very easy to make, i found it to be dense and moist instead of light and flaky, how i'd prefer it to be.  I used this for pumpkin pie, and while the pie was good, i ended up just eating the filling and leaving a crust shell behind.  :( probably won't try this again.

I have always been so afraid of over-working my pie crust that they turn out dry and over-crumbly.  After all, I live in the shadow of the pie-crust queen - Mom.  ("Don't over-mix!  That's the secret!  And ICE water." Can anyone else hear their mother's voice in their head?)  This one I was determined to knead enough to get it to stick together, and so I did.  It was still flaky, tender, and absolutely delicious!  I've never even heard of eggs in pie crust but this recipe is a keeper!  I used it for turkey pot pie, and in the future, I will cut sugar down to 2 T for savory pies, but leave it right at 3 for sweet pies.  Perfect!  The only thing I'd change is to bake my pie a little longer (30 min is what I did, the pot pie recipe called for 20-25) - the bottom was undercooked.

I am giving this recipe two stars because it is totally lacking in the directions. It says nothing about chilling the shortening, using ice water, or how long to chill the dough. It turned out ok, but I had to go look up another recipe to see how cold everything needed to be. Also, I made a half recipe and it made enough for a thick crust 9 inch pie, with a little bit left over. This would make very thin crusts for two pies...

My first pie ever -- the crust turned out wonderfully. Thanks so much! I was so worried and this really did have a nice taste and was pleasantly flaky. My only words of advice -- make sure you use the biggest mixing bowl you can find. I thought mine was big until I made this... the flour kept flying out as I cut with the pastry cutter.

I absolutely HATED pie because of the crust...... until I tried this!  This is AMAZING!  I have used it already a number of times and finally, after using it again today, I could not resist rating this any longer.  Make this crust!  You WON"T regret it!  I personally use Animal Shortening (Lard) because it is far more flavorful and natural and healthy than hydrogenated vegetable shortenings.  I can see exactly why this recipe has lasted over 100 years!

I think this will be my go to recipe for flaky crust. I've had a horrible time with pie crusts being to doughy but this turned out light and flaky. Used this recipe for "Buttermilk Pie IV." *UPDATE* Made with Old-Fashioned Lemon Whey Pie and braided the crust. Braiding with this dough was ok but the flakiness did hinder the process.

Super yummy pie crust.  I had reservations about trying this recipe because of the sugar.  I wanted a neutral pie crust that could be used in either sweet or savory pies.  Based upon another review, I decided to try this one on a chicken pot pie.  It was fabulous and no one noticed the sweetness (I did use a bit less than 3T of sugar).  My "shortening" was a combination of coconut oil and butter.

This is the first pie crust I've made and I made it for an apple pie. It was super simple, easy and turned out amazing! I didn't change a thing; followed the recipe exactly.

So, I guess I've been doing pie crust wrong my whole life. This was fantastic and puts my BH&G recipe to shame. The liquid didn't seem like it would be enough but it totally was, use a little less if it's humid out. I split it into 3 crusts and rolled into 12 inch circles. I would just add a 1/2 tsp. of salt for next time.

I've used a lot of different pie crust recipes over the years, and I think this one is my least favorite to date.

The pros to this recipe are that the dough is easy to work with, and there's a lot of it (easily enough to make a double pie crust in a 9" pan). The cons are that it is too wet & oily to make a good, flaky crust. This pie crust is so wet that its texture is almost more of a cookie dough. 

I think this is a good recipe for beginners to start with because the dough is so easy to work with, but the final product leaves a lot to be desired. I won't be using this recipe again.

This crust is amazing!  The only thing I changed was that I did 1 cup of butter and 3/4 C shortening to add more buttery flavor.  It was a big hit!  I usually don't like pie crust, but I could eat this all day!

I love trying new and different approaches to recipes I have become complacent with. So I found this one, so highly reviewed, and gave it a shot. I see that I am not the only one who had to use their pottery skills to just get it to hold together in the pan.

I was skeptical... my pie crusts tend to be fine, but not amazing. This one delivered and was flat out the best crust I have ever made. The next time I make it I will cut the salt down. I also took another reviewer's advice and started with a quarter cup of water. I only needed about a teaspoon more than that for the perfect amount of liquid. Had I started with the full half cup, the dough would have been too sticky. I also froze the shortening before using it. That seemed to make it really easy to cut into the flour. I also think I could have gotten four crusts out of it (not deep dish), but I stuck with three for this round. Next time I will try four. Thanks for sharing Grandma's recipe!

Made this dough/pastry recipe just as written, but added (with the water/egg mixture a half tsp white vinegar).  The pastry when cooked was light, flaky and delicious!  I will keep this recipe as my regular one for any pies (meat or fruit).

This recipe was amazing. My only advice is to use the original recipe to make ONLY 2 PIE CRUSTS. I made an apple pie using this recipe to yield two crusts and they were thick, flaky, and wonderful! Don't skimp on the pie crust! ! ! Make it for 2 crusts. I also used the butter flavored margarine. This will always be my crust recipe!

for the record, pie crust is my nemesis and I have NEVER mastered the art so my error really has to factor into this review.  I thought this crust was rather think and "lard-y" tasting but i must just be a fan of butter crusts.  used butter flavoured shortening but it still just tasted dense and oily.  Maybe this would be better for a savoury pie but it pretty much overpowered my strawberry rhubarb pie.

I made this crust for Apple Pie by Grandpa Ople & it was great!  As another reviewer suggested, I used butter flavored crisco & brushed pie with lightly beatn egg before baking.  This reacipe really only made 1 double & 1 single pie crust.  This one's a keeper!

This was my first time making pie crust and it turned out beautifully! Made this for Apple Pie by Grandma Ople from this site. 

I had enough dough for the apple pie crust and lattice top and one more bottom crust that I used to make the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie from this site.

All was delicious!

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening in this recipe and it still came out perfectly. I made a double crust for an apple pie and the top puffed up golden brown and so light. The flavor is excellent. I will use this recipe again and again, I know it!

Good pie crust but it does as mentioned by other make a lot. I used the butter flavored shortening. Made a 9 inch, deep dish apple pie w/a lattice top and had enough dough left over for at leastthe bottom of another pie. Will use again though. Flakey & light.

Really good flavorful crust - good with Chicken Pot Pie. I am interested to see how it is with sweet rather than savory. Yum! It was a bit difficult to roll (kept coming a part, didn't blend well) but this might be because I used the electric mixer rather than kneading.

Five Stars! Don't change a thing. This crust is easy to make and roll out. It turns out light and just crispy enough to make each bite interesting. Mmmm Mmmm good! Thank you, Ruth, your Grandma AND Barbara!

Add me to the list of people who LOVE this recipe! I'd never made a crust from scratch before & was nervous...no need to be - it was surprisingly much easier than I expected. The only change I made was subbing in chilled, butter-flavored crisco for the regular shortening. Had several people who usually leave the pie crust tell me that it was the best tasting crust they've ever eaten!

I have never been able to make a pie crust.  I figured I would try one more recipe.  This recipe was easy and the BEST crust I have ever tasted.  I used butter flavored Crisco and used ice water. Thanks for sharing!!

Perfect pie crust!  Super flakey and buttery!  I used butter flavor crisco instead of regular which is a must!!!  I did get enough for 1 1/2 pies which is fine because I froze the extra.  I made this with the "famous" apple pie by grandma ople on this site and boy!!!  The best Apple pie anyone can ever make!!!!  The crust and pie were out of this world!  This is definitely my go to crust!

Tried this today with my 5 & 3 year old daughters to make mini-pumpkin pies (in a muffin tin) and it was fantastic! The dough was handled so much that I thought it would be tough, but it was flaky and tender. I used regular shortening because the butter flavored was rancid and the taste was good. I might try butter flavored next time if I have it. As with all pie crusts, I used ice cold water. Thank-you for sharing this great recipe!

I have avoided making  pies in the past b/c I never had a recipe that worked well for me. This one has simple  ingredients & simple to mix. I gave it a4 stars b/cit only gave me 3 crusts, not 4. But I'm forgiving,as it  is very tasty & flaky. this "old" recipe  will live on..Thanks for passing it down!

This is by far the best pie crust I have ever had, and my family is a big pie eating family! So much so that our family reunion is called PIE SUNDAY! :) 

It makes a nice thick two crust pie or three thinner single crust pies... either way... delishous!!!

the best way to make four whole crusts with this one is to roll it into a log and cut and weight the pieces with a kitchen scale, that way you know they are perfectly separated.  i rolled one portion out with plenty of flour and managed an even layer for perfect pumpkin pie.  flaky, but not crumbly.  the remaining portions i placed in ziplock bags and froze them, as i rarely make pie with two crusts i can make three more good pies with this batch.  Mixes well in stand mixer.

Makes two tasty, flaky double crust pies.  Very forgiving dough, I ripped it but just squeezed it back together and it was fine.  Soft to work with but nice and crusty when baked.

I followed the recipe almost to a 't' the only thing I did different was use butter shortening instead of regular as I was making a peach cobbler. Th end result was a flavorful, moist, light, buttery crust that was the perfect consistency for my cobbler and peach tarts. My family said it was the best that they've had from me. 
Thanks Barbara for sharing~

OH My!  This is the best crust I've ever made, and I've done more than my share.  It rolled out easy, went together quick.  I used non-hydrogenated shortening.  The recipe makes enough for three single crust pies, or two loose lattice topped.  So now I have some ready to go in my freezer.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Great crust! I started making this and realized that I was out of eggs, so I substituted the eggs for lowfat buttermilk. It made it a different consistency (more crumbly) but turned out great!

This was my first made from scratch pie crust, it turned out fantastic. great flavor tender and flakey.
The dough was very sticky, but I'm sure it was just me being inexperienced:)  The end result was DELICIOUS!!!

Me & pie crust never get along. I tried making my Mom's recipe for pie crust before trying this one and ended up throwing it in the trash. I figured I would have to go to the store and buy the refrigerated stuff, but I searched the website and found this recipe. It was so easy to make and the crust came out great. I was a bit concerned about the amount of shortening and might try it again with a little less.  It is also a good thing to chill the shortening and make sure your water is ice cold.  I love my mom's recipe, but since this actually worked for me...sorry mom.

Worked great I made it the night before in my kitchenaid. I only mixed in the butter until 3/4 mealed in then added the wet ingredients and mixed into a shaggy wet mass. I portioned it into 4 (9 oz) portions with a small (5 oz) extra portion. I wrapped them individually and pulled them out as needed the next morning. The recipe made excellent crust!!!!

THE best crust I have ever made. I was 1/3 cup shy of shortening, substituted 1/3 cup butter for it. It turned out light, flaky and delicious. I used it for a chicken pot pie. Rolled up the remainder cold from the fridge the next day and it baked up perfect again. I will commit this one to memory so I never forget it!

This was the first pie crust I have ever made.I'm not sure if maybe I did something wrong,but it looked great and for the most part tasted great..BUT my crust was only half baked! I even cooked it for 15 mins more than what it said there were some areas that were just still gooey

This is the 1st crust I have EVER made. It's amazing! The only things I changed was the salt & sugar. I never add salt to anything so I didn't use it for this either. If I have the option in not using white sugar then I don't, I'll use honey or brown sugar instead. I was a little nervous since this was the 1st time making a crust in general, but I went ahead & used brown sugar & I'm so glad that I did. It turned out perfect with a slight sweetness. I'm about to make my very 1st apple pie & I'm using this recipe again. Hoping it'll work just as well for a lattice. I'll post later on the outcome :D

Great recipe, but do yourself a favor and use brand name Crisco--I made the poor decision to go with an off-brand shortening and my crust turned out terrible. With Crisco it's perfect.

This is the best pastry I have ever made, brilliant. I also adapt for savories by omitting the sugar. Made meat and potatoes pie yesterday and my husband thought I had used puff pastry.

I made this pie crust for a peach cobbler and it came out terrifically!  Although I was a bit concerned that the dough ball was a tad too dry to work with, I still put it into the refrigerator to chill.  When I took it out, I aded a little bit of water, and WHALAH!  Perfection.  It was so manageable.  I believe that I even worked the dough too much, but it didn't matter--it still came out perfectly.  And like many of the reviewers mentioned before, the recipe is enough for 3 pie shells, but I kept all of the crust because I was using a 9 x 13 (3 qt.) pyrex dish, and plus my family loves--in this order--crust first, then cobbler juice, and lastly, a sprinkle of peaches!  So this was perfect.  I covered the edges with tin foil, and it was pure deliciousness!  Next time, I will try the butter-flavored shortening.  And I am going to use it next with some chicken pot pies.

Perfect flakey crust! Do NOT knead the butter to much into the flour. There should still be pea size lumps of butter/shortening when the dough is ready to roll. If you knead to much or handle the dough too much it will turn out hard as a rock with a taste of flour.

This was my first successful attempt at making a pie crust.  The flavor and texture were great.  A few tricks to consider: first add the flour, sugar, and salt to a food processor.  Pulse it until thoroughly mixed.  Then add the shortening; try to evenly distribute the shortening when putting it in the processor.  Pulse it a few times until crumbly (not long).  Transfer mixture to a a large bowl and add the egg and water mixture.  Mix with hands.  Split the dough and put in the fridge overnight.  The next day, roll the crust on a lightly floured surface.  Update:  Use butter instead of shortening.  More water may been need than the specified 1/2 cup.  Despite other reviews, the recipe does make two double pie crusts.

This pie crust was the best and easiest I've ever made. So flakey and delicious! It did fall apart a bit when I rolled it out and put it in the pie pan but it only took a couples minutes to patch things up- the taste was worth the work.

I'm usually REALLY BAD at making pie crust, so I just get store-bought, but this time I was making a pie and didn't have any crusts.  So I made this and it was SO EASY to make and roll.  Tastes great too.  I used 1/2 the recipe and used it for 1 pie.  Had some leftovers and baked them up, so tasty.  This will be my pie dough recipe from now on, and I will no longer be afraid of making it!

Best pie crust EVER!  Very flavorful, wonderful texture, and flakier than any other crust I've tried, but also holds together well.  I'll never make another crust.

I used this crust for a chicken pot pie and I must say that it turned out wonderfly.  I had to cut the ingredients in half because I only needed two crusts but it didn't hurt anything.  I will be using this one again.

Although I had never made pie crust with an egg in the ingredients, it turned out well. This recipe makes four single pie crusts, depending  on how it is rolled and the size of pie plates used.

Flavorful crust - but I had issues.  I only needed bottom crust (for cranberry pie - this site), and was very happy later.  I had to piece my crust together in the pan like a puzzle.  Dough was super dry - tried adding water, still broke apart.  Would not roll out correctly no matter what I did.  However, no one sees the bottom of the pie :) and the flavor and consistency of finished crust is fantastic.  Even with the headache, will try again!

The best pie crust I have ever had! This is my first time making pie crust and it turned out great! I did make one mistake while using it for a pumpkin pie. I tried to pre-bake the crust a little bit (thinking it will prevent the crust from getting soggy) but it didn't work. The crust collapsed on itself since there was no stuffing inside and there is so much butter in the crust. So don't attempt to prebake it! :) With my pies I used cookie cutters to cut out fall shapes from a piece of rolled out crust and put the shapes on top of the pie before baking it. It makes the pie look so pretty.

This is the one. I used this recipe (minus the sugar) to make crust for pot pie. As written, it made just enough for a top and bottom crust using a large (9.5 x 13.5 x 2)glass baking dish.   The dough is fairly sticky, so I rolled it out on floured wax paper, which worked perfectly. I didn't chill it.   Even though I'm sure I over-worked the crust edges, the whole crust turned out tender and flaky. I can't wait to try it with a fruit pie.

I accidentally modified this recipe.  I had cut the recipe in half, and wasn't paying attention to what I was doing and used a 1/3 cup measurer when I was adding the shortening instead of a 1/4 cup.  I ended up adding 1 cup and 2 TB of shortening instead of 3/4 cup and 2 TB.  Put in some extra flour to make it workable, and it turned out fine.  Pie crust was still wonderful, but a little more difficult (completely my fault).  Very tender and flaky.  Can't wait to use it again, but correctly :)

I thought my other pie crust recipe was good...this will now be my go to pie crust.  I imagine that it could be easily halved as the recipe makes a generous double crust.  I actually liked having crust dough to spare.  It seems like I am always scratching to get enough for my pies.  And this crust tastes wonderful...I believe the sugar really adds so much.  I used this for a lattice pie, Grandma Opal's Apple Pie from this site.  It was delicious as well.  Horray for the grandma's!

What a great recipe!  This was my first time making a pie and the pie crust was what I was most worried about.  The directions were great and it was really easy to do.  The only thing I would add for beginners is what you need to do AFTER you chill the crust and are ready to use it.  I went back to AllRecipes and found a "how to make pie crust" recipe that showed step-by-step the best way to divide and roll this out.  When dividing the dough, make one ball larger - this will be the base of the pie - and the pie cover smaller, as you need less to cover.  I also highly recommend brushing the top of the pie with the egg/milk mix as this produces a really gorgeous golden brown crust.  Thanks!

This is by far one of my favorite recipes for pie crust, there are so many out there, but this one deffinatelt tops the list, I made one similar to this with real butter, but I'm now lactose intolerant, but it still wasn't as good as this one. Absolutely fabulous.

enough for four pie crusts.  Use hand blender to mix shortening into flour mix.

AWESOME recipe!!! The best pie crust I have made yet. Tasted great, had a good texture and everyone loved it. It was also very easy to work with! I used a stick of butter and 1 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening. I also let it sit in the frige over night before rolling it out. I did only make 3 pie crusts (but 2 big crusts were perfect for my deep dish apple pie).

Absolutely the best pie crust I have ever made. Need to chill it before rolling out to make it a bit easier to work with and makecut-outs. This definately is a keeper!

THIS WAS AMAZINGLY DELICOUS IF AS DISAPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT MAKES A DOUBLE CRUST WHEN I MADE IT SO I ENDED UP THROWING HALF OF IT AWAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T NEED IT. OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS REALLY DELICOUS.

This is the best-tasting pie crust I have had and one of the easiest to make. It is much easier to roll out than the traditional pie-crust recipes and I really enjoy the slightly sweeter taste. I will be using this recipe any time I make pie!

Outstanding recipe. I was skeptical, but my search for perfect pie crust is over! Important note if you plan to use this for a custard pie or wet filling: pre-baking is a must to prevent a soggy bottom, and lining with parchment and filling with pie weights is compulsory or the crust will slump down the sides and become a mess. I placed a piece of parchment in mine and filled it to the top with rice to help keep the sides pushed up. Bake for 15 minutes at 375 degrees with the pie weight and then an additional 5 after removing the weight. Result is melt in your mouth goodness. Enjoy!

This is the only pie crust recipe I use anymore. I've been making it for YEARS and everyone raves about how amazing it is. I do use butter instead of shortening, though, and lately I've been using half wheat, half all-purpose flour.

Seriously good and flaky.  Use chilled butter and try not to blend it in too much, this helps with the "flakyness".  Also, like the recipe says, chill it!  It's so much easier to use when chilled.  For me it regularly makes enough for three pies.  Of course, this depends on the size of pie and how thin you roll your crusts.  I usually use one, then freeze the other two by wrapping them in plastic wrap then putting them in freezer bags.  Take it out the day before and put it in the fridge to thaw.  I have never had a problem with this recipe.

This is the first time I've ever attempted to make a homemade pie crust and I'm so glad I chose this recipe. It was AWESOME!! I used butter flavored Crisco instead of unsalted butter and I had no problem working with the dough.  The only problem I ran into is this recipe did not include baking time or instructions. So, I had to Google how long to bake  an empty pie crust. (I was making a coconut cream pie.) The crust and finished pie came out wonderful. I know because my pickiest eater ate the entire thing, he usually just eats the filling and leaves the crust. I'm so glad I froze the left over dough, now I'll be ready any time I need to make a pie for dessert.

I've been using this same basic recipe that I got from my grandmother as well.  It's absolutely fool proof.  I've never had it come out wrong even if it seemed a little too moist as I was mixing it.  But it is a little too small to do two double crusts.  Especially if you fill the pie as much as I usually do.  As in a fruit pie or something.  Only plan, at best, one double crust and a single.  Also, for help in rolling it out use sheets of plastic wrap on either side of it.  Roll a little and flip over and keep peeling off and replace and keep rolling until done. Works great and easier to get in pan as well as no flour everywhere.

There's a reason this is a five star recipe. I love to bake but up until now I was always a little intimidated by pies because everyone always says how tough pie crusts are to make. Even for a novice pie maker like myself this crust was so easy and turned out perfectly flaky and delicious. You can't mess this up. I've now spent hours thinking of all of the possibilities of what I can make using this crust. I would definitely recommend letting it chill completely in the fridge before rolling it out so it's easier to work with. I was too impatient to let it sit and it was hard to roll out without it falling apart, but that was my fault.

This made a delicious, flaky pie crust.  The problem I have with this recipe is that it seems to assume that the baker is experienced.  At a bare minimum, I think it should include basic instructions that get the ingredients all the way to "crust" stage - this recipe stops at the "dough" stage.  Even better would be if the recipe included advice about chilling ingredients, not overworking the dough, how long to refrigerate, etc.  I might use another recipe in the future just because I don't make pie crusts often and I would like to have those reminders in my recipe.

The first year I used this I made 27 different pies for the holidays. I had nothing but great compliments. As of this time I probably made more than 200 pies. Only recently I made a change. I now use 2 cups of shortening instead of 1 3/4 cups. It makes it a little more flaker. Also, it's real important to keep it as cold as possible until ready to stick in thr oven.

"Chilling until ready to use" doesn't cut it with this recipe. Terrible to handle unless you do. Definitely NOT ready for use in 10 minutes. Moving on

I'm confused... this recipe didn't work for me. :( I made it to the T and it was sticky and also fell apart. I thought I had used this recipe last time I made apple pie but I was thrown off by the egg and amount of water - I'm positive I didn't use that before. So I was very disappointed with the end result.

Perfect!  I have only attempted homemade crusts a few times and have never really had that much luck...UNTIL NOW...YAY!!!!
I've made this 3 times in 3 days, and I get a ton of compliments with every pie.  Super easy to whip together.  I used shortening like the recipe calls for (instead of butter as some mentioned) and thought it had great taste.  I love the crunch of the sugar.  I used the recipe exactly as it said. 
I only have two recommendations that might be helpful.  The first time I made this I put it in my Kitchen Aid mixer and used the paddle attachment to bring the dough together.  It sort of clumped around in my mixer but I just put it on a higher speed for a few seconds and it came together perfectly.  The next two times I made it I didn't have my mixer, so I had to do it by hand.  I found it to be a bit crumbly and hard to blend, but I just broke it into smaller batches and worked each ball of dough separately.  Secondly, I'd brush the dough with an egg before putting it in the oven.  It gave it a nice shine and golden color that really made a difference.  Lastly, it makes quite a bit.  I had enough for 2 crusts and possibly a third, but I like my crust thick and with a wide edge so I probably didn't get as much out of it as most people did.  
This will absolutely be my new crust recipe!  
UPDATE:  I made this for the 4th time but forgot to pick up shortening at the store.  I substituted butter = horrible result.  Using shortening is a must!

It was so fragile to work with that it fell apart trying to put it in the pie pan.

This receipe was amazing. Thank you for sharing. It was very easy to make and I followed the advice from one of the reviews to use wax paper when rolling out the dough. It was my first time making pie crust and it was well received by my family.

Really great crust! Flakey, great flavor. I use with apple pie and pot pies.  I agree with the other reviewers. I think it makes only 3 crusts. I make 2 patches and I think it makes 6 crust great. Will be using this for a long time.

Like others have said using an extra large egg made it too sticky but I added 1/3 cup of flour and it made it the perfect consistancy again.  So good and easy to work with!

I've never made pie crust before.  And I made a last minute buttermilk pie and needed a last minute pie crust recipe.  Thank goodness for Barbara Castodio!  When they say it is no fail, it is no fail!  I made it exactly as posted & it was perfect.  I only made one pie, and I didn't need top & bottom crust.  I couldn't tell you one way or another if it made an adequate amount for two pies.  But I can tell you that I have enough pie dough left over that as soon as I get home from work, I will be making another buttermilk pie w/this crust.  What a life saver and what an amazing crust!

I followed this to a T and it was TOO flaky, I couldn't even roll it out when it was raw.  It completely fell apart after refrigerating it for a few hours.I was only able to get 2 crusts out of this.

I've used this recipe a couple of times now and had no problem with handling the dough. I did substitute butter for half the shortening for taste but other than that followed the recipe. I also roll out my crust between 2 sheets of wax paper because it's much easier to transfer it to the pie plate that way. Great recipe, I don't know why some folks had such a difficult time with it.

Delicious and so easy! I don't use shortening so I replaced that with butter. I'll probably try it with less sugar next time, but this it is great as written.

i've made this crust several times now, and i really like it. both times for grandma oples apple pie from this site. however it is really hard to try to reroll... it gets tough easily. i am new at pastry/pie crusts so maybe i just need some more experience;)it is however the best i've found so far. Great recipe!

This is my first time making homemade crust! I love allrecipes! This crust is so flavorful and delicious. My husband was so intrigued watching me roll this out and so was I. The crust is so stable and easy to work with. I will be using this to create pies food and deserts for years to come.

Difficult, but fantastic crust. The recipe is very flaky and flavorful, but I use a Kitchenaid to do the mixing and it comes out very wet and tough to manage (perhaps that's my fault for using the mixer?). However, 20-30 minutes in the freezer before trying to work with it works wonders. Additionally, rolling it out in between sheets of wax paper really helps (just be sure to flip it and peel the wax paper back pretty often to keep it smooth). It is particularly difficult to make the lattice, but chilling the lattice strips to the point where they are tough, but will still bend without splitting really helps. The flavor and texture cannot be beaten. 

I make pies in 10-inch pans and the recipes makes just a little too much for ONE 10-inch, double crust pie.

I made my first homemade apple pie this last Thanksgiving. I was terrified that I was going to screw the crust up. But It turned out perfect. It really must be fool proof! It has turned me on to trying to bake more. Thanks for sharing!

Incredible! The last time I made a pie crust I was 6 years old and barefoot in my great grandmother's kitchen. I ALWAYS do the frozen store bought crusts because I've heard how difficult it is to make pie crusts. But when I went to make a quiche tonight and found my marie calendar's crust spoiled I was backed into a corner. Thank heavens because I am sold on this pie crust! No more store boughts for me! This recipe was super easy and fast to make, not to mention incredibly delicious! God bless Ruth AND her grandmother!

I really love this recipe. 
I tend to make a deep dish pie so this recipe will give me one double pie crust plus some cut outs for the top. 
I can get two double pie crusts when using a fairly flat, traditional pie plate. 

I shred my 'frozen' shortening into the dry ingredients and then I use a pastry cutter until I have a fine meal. 

I found that after 30 minutes of chilling- this dough was extremely easy to work with.  
Remember the less you work with the dough when rolling- the better it will be! The more you work it that tougher it becomes (this is true of most pie dough recipes!)

This makes a beautiful pie crust! I use an egg wash on my crust before baking. And, if it is a fruit pie I will sprinkle sugar overtop as well. Perfect.

I only read the good reviews and wish i had read the less favorable ones too.  This crust was a nightmare to work with.  I had to mold it together.  I thought it was something i did wrong even though i followed the recipe but now that i read the bad reviews i see i am not alone.  It's in the oven but it doesn't matter what it tastes like, i won't be making it again.

This was the best pie crust I have ever made. Very easy and goof proof. Flaky and a little sweet.
My family loved it.

Wow *WAY* too much salt!! Good texture & easy to work with but this was a VERY salty crust. Even with ice cream and a glass of milk, a piece of pie with this crust was kind of overwhelming. You could easily cut the salt in half and have a great basic crust with good flavor. Also only makes 3 single crusts, unless you're a pro at rolling out super thin crusts.

5 stars for sure!  I cut the recipe in half since I only needed 2 crusts (kind of strange to only use half an egg, but that's what I did) and used 6 tablespoons butter-flavored shortening and 1 stick of butter.  
My husband thinks this crust is better than his grandmother's, and she's famous for her crusts.  Uh-oh...this might make for a very interesting Thanksgiving this year....

Well, I ventured into my own pastry making today and after reading reviews, I chose this one.  And I am SO GLAD!   Oh, this turned out amazing!  I was a bit concerned when I was mixing it, it still seemed a bit dry, so just a touch more of the cold water made it perfect!  I am so pleased!  I am so glad for the reviews from all of you, those help so much!  Especially for a first timer.  Now I can't wait to make another pie!    :)

If there were 10 stars I would click on all ten.  This is the BEST pie crust.  It easily makes enough for two fruit pies or 4 single crust pies.  It freezes well and is ALWAYS crisp and holds onto the crispness even after being refrigerated for a few days.  EASY TO WORK WITH AND DELICIOUS!  thank you for this recipe.  An egg?  Who would have thought???

Turned out nice and flaky.  The reason for the three stars is that I found the flavour not to my liking.  Using all shortening, in my mind, is not a good idea.  Didn't taste right.  I will try using butter, or a butter-shortening mix next time.

I followed the directions exactly.  I found the pie crust difficult to work with while rolling out.  Then, it took forever to cook (increased my tart's cook-time by 20 minutes).  It came out super-brittle.  As a side-note:  it tasted extremely bland, (not that pie crusts are especially flavorful, but I felt like it was overly bland).  I'd offer suggestions for improvement, but I'm calling this one a loss.  I'm so sorry to leave a bad review...

This is a delicious pie crust recipe. I do not believe it can be beat. I used another recipe for years, but inexplicably lost the recipe and was forced to do a quick search. I chose Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust, I lost count when I was adding the flour and apparently had not added nearly enough, So I ended up rolling it out and working it twice. Which usually rings the death knoll for tender and flaky. But not with this! It was perfectly tender and flaky. Everybody at my party wanted the recipe. I did a small variation. Instead of using cold water, I used chilled Relax white wine. I have never had a crust this delicious.

First time making pie crust and it turned out so much better then I thought it would. I was scared to try making it because I have heard how hard it is to work with but this wasn't bad at all. I love my Kitchen Aid mixer and let it do all the work. :)

This is a new favorite. It has a good flavor, a nice yellowish color and is great from everything from quiche to pies. For savory dishes, I always add garlic powder or salt to give it a flavor boost!

This is PERFECT!  My father is a baker and making the perfect crust can be difficult if you don't know the tricks.  I advise watching the video on how to make a crust on this site and then use this receipt.  The dough was easy to mold and use and came out super tasty! Thank you Ruth and Grandma!

Best and easiest recipe. Everyone **LOVED** it. Very easy to roll and shape in pan. I used 1 cup butter flavored shortening and 3/4 cup regular shortening.

Very easy and one of the best pie crusts ever. I usually am not a fan of the edge of the crust but I baked it on a low shelf in the oven and it didn't get as well done and didn't burn. Will use it again!

Don't even think about rolling this crust out before it is refridgerated. I make pies all the time and decided to try this based on the ratings...so frustrating if the dough isn't chilled! After it is chilled then it rolls easily and smoothly.

This was my first attempt ever at a pie crust. And what a success it was!! It made enough for 2 1/2 crusts for me... but I latticed the top of my apple pie... so if I hadn't of done that, I probably would have had enough for 3 crusts. I will definitely use this again! I did take other reviewer's suggestions to use ICE water and chill the shortning, too. And I brushed egg white on the bottom crust before filling the pie, to help ensure it didn't get mushy from fruit filling. Thanks for an easy recipe that even I could do, that tasted great, too

Turned out great for me! I made this with Grandma Ople's Apple pie recipe from this site and it turned out better than I could have imagined.  I have some dough left over, not quite enough for another full pie, but I was thinking I might make some turkey pot pies with the leftover thanksgiving turkey and use the leftover dough! I will be using this recipe again!

I hate to rate this one down because the outcome was probably my own fault.  It was WAY too doughy and made enough for 3 crusts.  To be honest, it's just easier to go get a Mrs. Smiths frozen shell and top it with a Pillsbury roll out crust.

Basically foolproof, I used my food processor and got a little pulse friendly so the shortening and flour tuned to dough and the egg and water didn't want to mix in so I left this big wet doughish ball in the fridge for a couple days added more flour left it for another 2 days because I forgot I wanted to see if it would taste ok baked an empty pie and my dh ate the entire shell.  Its great and I am finishing up the last of my mini pies now.

Sigh... I'm really unhappy... this was WONDERFUL... and now I'm going to have to make fresh pie crust from now on... no more boxed junk for me.... alas!! Ignorance was bliss! LOL No but thank you for sharing it, it's really REALLY quite good. I used butter as had no shortening, and put a dash of vanilla for an apple pie. Yum.

This pie crust has a perfect balance of sturdiness and flakiness. It tastes awesome and doesn't need to be refridgerated for a long time before use, like a lot of other pastry recipes. However, the recipe yields too much pastry for one pie and not enough for two. Although, for Thanksgiving, I made a double crust apple pie and a single crust pumpkin pie, so it was the perfect amount.

This pie crust was the best.  Even tho, this was the first pie I've ever made, my family and I agree the crust was light and flaky.  It was easy to make.  So since I was a first time pie maker....I would like to add (to others that may not know) that after blending the mixture together I divided the dough into two and chilled in the fridge for about 30-40 minutes before I rolled out. I could probably eat the crust by itself, it was so good!  Guess I got lucky finding this recipe for my first try!

My husband loves this crust!  Said it was everything a pie crust should be and very nice and flaky; just perfect.  Now, I have very little cooking skill and if I can make it turn out, you know it's good!  Made this recipe again tonight and had the husband roll out the dough.  We have plenty left over from making a single crust pie and a double crust pie.  Should be enough to get at least another single and maybe another double.  We use this one for our pies and for our chicken pot pie.

Everything you want a crust to be! I must have not rolled it thin enough be cause I only got 3 crusts out the recipe.  I can't believe I ever bought pie crust-YUCK!  I am a convert- normally I eat the insides of pie and leave the crust which is usually a combination of dry/burnt/gummy/flavorless. This amazing recipe cooked to a perfect golden brown without covering it and is flaky even the bottom stayed crisp! Thank you Ruth's Grandma!!!

Wow, this was so easy and very tasty crust! I only needed half of the ingredients to make a perfect pie crust for one Pyrex pie dish! Two things I changed was to switch shortening to half canola oil, and half spreadable butter, and used 1 cup of white flour + 1 cup of whole wheat flour (remember I used only half the ingredients, which calls for only 2 cups of flour). I'll make this again!

Very good pie crust.  I used 1 cup butter and 3/4 shortening and it still turned out really good.  I like the fact that the recipe makes quite a bit of dough, as now I have extra in my freezer for the next pie.

Used this to make Grandma Oples Apple Pie today and it turned out great! I'm not an expert when it comes to pie dough but this was such an easy and forgiving pie dough to work with! The only changes I made was to add the egg to the flour mixture first then add the ice cold water 1 tbs at a time until the dough formed, used a little shy of 1/2 cup. Also I cut the shortening up and froze it for a bit to make it nice and cold, much easier to work into the flour this way. One mistake I think I did was not chilling it long enough. I was in a bit of a rush and only chilled it for 15 minutes but I think I would have had an easier time rolling it out if I didn't rush it. I saw other reviewers saying that this made too much for 1 pie but I thought it was good for a pie with a lattice top, although Im not an expert roller so I did have quite a bit of scraps but I didn't mind that. None the less it turned out great, such a flaky tender pie that still held up an apple pie, will definitely be my new go to crust!

This was the first homemade pie crust I have ever made, I usually just buy the frozen store kind because it's easiest, but this was really easy to make and tasted incredible! I will never buy a store crust again! I was able to make two deeper dish pies with a crumb topping no problem with this recipe. Amazingly delicious!

I loved it!! I normally buy pie crust that is in the tin pan form the store. This time I decided to make it from scratch. All I can say is this is going to be the only way I make pie crust from now on!!! It taste much better than the ready to use crust from the store. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

For a fruit pie I added in another Tbsp of sugar, since I like it a bit sweeter.

I'd give this 4.5 stars.  The taste and texture of the crust is out of this world.  My one and only complaint is that the dough was super soft and a little hard to work with even after being chilled for several hours.  It was well worth the small hassle of the dough to get the final product.

Actually surprisingly easy to make with a delicious and flaky outcome. I've always been apprehensive about making rolled crusts (usually just do the crumb crusts that I can press into the dish) but this dough was very easy to handle. It baked beautifully, too - I used it for chicken pot pie so I halved the recipe to get two crusts and omitted the sugar. I can't wait to try this on a dessert pie!

This was the MOST manageable pie crust I have ever worked with. I doubt I will ever have to look for another. AND it was light and flakey with a mild flavor. THANK YOU!

Absolutely phenomenal!  Couldn't get any easier so for novices, like me, go for it!  I make this for pretty much anything dessert related, my latest use was for butter tarts.  I get responses like "this is hands down without question the best pastry/crust i have ever had".... so those looking at this recipe, do not pass it by in search for something else!  amazing, thank you so much :)

Make Gma Ople pie with it. Easy enough. Made it the night before and had to add cold water the next day. Tasted good. I'm not an expert or a critic when it comes to crust, though.

Pretty awesome. I agree with others it was enough for 3 pie crusts, or 1 regular and 1 double crusted pie :) First pie crust ever and it was challenging but was a success!

a perfect pie crust. definitely refrigerate it for at least an hour before you roll it out, though, or it is very hard to work with.

The flavor and texture of this crust is amazing! I used it for a beef pot pie and it was delicious, though I had to use a bit more water than the recipe called for.  Will be using this for all my pies now- thanks for a great recipe!

This was the very first pie I have ever made and the crust turned out amazing! I used powedered sugar to roll the dough in rather than flour to give it a little sweeter taste.

I had never tried crust before this one (the whole idea seemed like too much work) but I will always make my own crust with this recipe from now on.  Easy and SOOO much better than the store stuff.  Better for you too - no preservatives or nasty chemicals!

Excellent!  I was worried - after mixing in the egg & water - that it was going to be too soft, and glue-y, but after chilling for an hour or so, it rolled out beautifully.  I divvied it up into thirds (as per the other reviews), used two sections for an apple pie (Granny Ople's apple pie filling from this site is the BEST) and froze the third for another day ... for this pie crust challenged gal, this came out perfect, rave reviews from dh and the kids, and will be my go to pie crust recipe - no more refrigerated pie crusts in this house!!

My pastry has always been made with lard, however I only had shortening on this day, so I tried this recipe. Now given that we are lard pastry people, this recipe made a good pastry, but just not up to our tastes. I feel it made a perfect shortening pastry, and cannot fault it. In fact, I was very happy with it, but my husband wants lard pastry again.

Made this crust for peach pie and it made a great pie over the top.  I even had to reroll it (dough got too warm and stuck to the counter) and it was still flaky and tender.  The bit of sugar just did it.  Will use this for all my fruit pies from now own.  Can't wait to try it on apple pie.

Almost the same as my recipe for pastry, except that mine has 3 Tbsps brown sugar, which gives it a little different flavour, but is still very flaky.

YUM!! Flacky, tender, though crisp. Light sweet flavor, easy to work with. Fabulous!  I was making a double batch and went ahead and upped to servings to 40 because of the other reviews mentioning lack of dough. I wound up with enough leftover dough to make a little tart for sampling (yummy, but it means the original amount would have been sufficient for my 9inch pies top and bottom).  I used one stick of butter and the rest crisco in my double batch, and the result was spectacular. (For the recipe as it reads on this page, sub in 1/4 cup butter, or 1/2 stick).  Enjoy!

I just made this pie crust for more times than I can count today.  It has never failed me.  I have always followed the directions and have never had a problem.  Since I have found this I refuse to buy store made pie crust and have come to the conclusion that the pie crust is just as important as the pie filling.

My husband told me last night that it was the crust that really made my pie.  I used 1 1/2 cups of butter and 1/4 cup of margarine because that's what I had and it turned out wonderfully!  I've heard when using butter to grate it into the flour while it's still frozen and to work quickly.  The crust was flaky and very yummy.  I will definitely use this one again!  Thanks!!

Amazing!!!  I baked this for a 4th of July celebration and this was my first homemade pie crust!  It worked wonderfully with the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople recipe from this site.  It came out nice and flaky with lots of flavor.  I took another reviewer's advice about spreading egg white on the top of the pie to give it color and when I brought out the pie, everyone wanted to eat it!

I might have made mistakes, but the pie crust didn't taste awesome and was way more crumbly then it was flaky.  The issues that I had that might have caused the problem (not sure) was that my a\c was broken and the oven being on was making the kitchen fairly warm and the dough was heating up quickly (hard to work with) and that I might have mixed it to much with my hands (not leaving enough fat pieces in the crust).  However,  I also didn't feel it was very tasty either, even regardless of the texture.  All that being said, I can be very critical of my work and everyone else raved about the pie (but not the crust).

I'm a pie baker from way back and always have good results, but I saw so many raves about this recipe that I decided to stray from my tried-and-true and give it a whirl.  It's great!  Very tasty.  I think I'll try rolling the crust at room temp next time: it was a bit stiff from refrigeration.

Loved this pie crust! Its very easy to make and roll out. The only thing I did different is used the butter flavored shortening, it gave it a really nice flavor. Will be using this recipe from now on.

Makes enough for 3 crusts, and it turns out very good. Super easy and flaky. A little tough, but I'll willingly put up with that for such an easy dough! I used both butter and shortening and that worked well too. Good recipe!

This is the BEST pie crust ever!  I have tried many pie crusts and this is the best.  I used all butter because I read in the "pie tips" section on this site that butter gives a richer flavor and shortening gives a flakier crust.  I wanted more flavor but the texture was still there anyway!

Wonderful pie crust.  Thanks for sharing your heirloom recipe, Barbara.  UPDATE:  The first time I followed the directions exactly, and it was perfect.  Since then, I have found that the mixture has too much moisture (probably because I live in the humid deep south), so, like tea and honey, I start with 1/4 cup water and add more as needed.

For a newbie, this pie crust was very easy to do and very flaky! I followed alot of previous feedback - have everything ice cold, including bowls and all ingredients. This allowed me to have a little more time rolling out the dough. For next time I make this, I will mix everything ahead of time and put it into the freezer until I need it.

This tasted excellent. Not sure why I had trouble rolling it out but I pieced it together in a pie pan. VERY FLAKY. I did brush egg on the crust before I filled it and liked that alot. Will definetley use again. This makes enough for about 3- 3 1/2 pies. I had extra so I put it  in the freezer to use at a later time.

This is absolutely my new pie crust.  I have been using the Betty Crocker pie crust recipe for 20 years and have always felt that it was lacking.  This was amazing.  I really felt like I was making pastry...it was so flakey but also had a substantial texture and a bit of sweetness.  Follow the recipe exactly and you will get a 10 inch double pie crust with some left over for decorations/cut-out leaves ect.  You could also make 3 9 inch pie crusts with this with none left over.  I always like to have extra so I can really beautify my pie without stressing about materials.

I was a bit nervous to add all the liquid, and I'm glad I didn't add it all in at once--it would have been too sticky.  Flavor was good--looked pretty and held up well.

Well, I am such a procrastinator with pie crust, the recipes I've tried in the past didn't use eggs and would always fall apart upon placing them in the pan, not these. This is a great recipe although I didn't have enough shortening on hand so I used a 1/2 cup of it and 1 1/2 cups of butter, then because the salt was too much I added about two more tablespoons of sugar, the dough even tasted good! The butter made the crust so much tastier! Thank you for such a good recipe!

A+++++ This is my go to pie crust recipe from now on! I chilled well and kneeded slightly before rolling out.  I used this with the "Old Fashioned Apple Dumplings" from this site. These two recipes will now become a tradition in my family!

Simply the best! I had my mother (who is an exceptional baker) help me make my peach pie and she noted that the flour in the recipe should be sifted and that the water should be ice cold. Tips that I didnt know and might have made a diference in this wonderful crust!

I have made this for years. Original recipe says 4 crusts but I always do 3.  I divide it into 3 parts right away and pat into flat rounds - wrap in plastic wrap or waxed paper and refrigerate for 1/2 hour before using.  The extra goes in the freezer after an extra wrap in foil.  It is a very easy and always flaky and delicious.

This was a GREAT pie crust recipe. Was visiting some family in Germany and they wanted "typical American apple pie", but you can't buy pie crusts in the store there-- so I attempted making it from scratch. This crust came out PERFECT and they LOVED it. We actually made a second apple/blackberry pie because they loved it so much. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe swept away years of intimidation I'd felt about making pie crust from scratch. Following earlier tips I used butter flavored Crisco and brushed the top with egg white beaten with a little water and sprinkled with a little sugar once at the beginning and once again half way through baking.  Wrap the edge of the crust with foil for the first 15 minutes to avoid over browning. Beautiful color, flavorful, flaky and easy to work with. Perfect, and got rave reviews from my extended family that was raised on great scratch baking.

Quite a nice flavour; very flakey and crumbly but held together well - however; I'd had to change a bit..  I'd done half shortening and half butter for flavour as we don't have Crisco (or similar) here in Aust.; and definitely don't have butter flavoured shortening.  My dish with the recipe though was the amount of liquid was about two times what was needed?  Ended up adding 1 tsp of lemon juice and subtracting 1 tsp of water; had the egg; mixed it all together and had it in the fridge until just before use.  I was brought up adding just a bit at a time until everything's just barely moistened - I'm so glad I did that and din't jsut chuck all the water in with the flour; all I would have had was a big gloopy mess. Will likely make again; but will definitely watch the amount of liquid a bit more closely; will probably double the amount of dry ingredients and shortning/butter/(etc) and keep the liquid amount the same - will work out well to freeze excess; and then you'll end up having 3 full double crust batches, as well.

I really enjoy the taste of this crust but it isn't the easiest to roll out.  I will continue to make this for many years to come.

Delicious crust.  I've used it for several pie recipes from this site.  I'm not skilled with pies or crusts so I usually don't end up with quite enough for 2 whole pies, but I'm sure if you know what you are doing with dough, you can get that.  The taste is perfect and flaky every time!

What a great crust! I've never been able to make pie crust before and now I can. I made butter tarts and the crust was so good. I mixed the flour,sugar,salt,1 cup shortening and 3/4 cup butter in the food processor and finished the rest as directed.

This pie crust is so easy and delicious! I used it for a French Silk pie and well as a brownie cream cheese pie and they both turned out fabulous. I didn't pie crust could be so easy to work with. Thank you for this recipe I know I can rely on for a great crust.

This recipe was truly amazing! I've tried a few different pie crust recipes and this one was by far the best! Instead of making 3 or 4 pie crusts though, I made tarts instead and got 6 dozen plus 2 extra. Worked very well and everyone loved them! Will definitely be making this my staple pie crust from now on! Thank-you for a wonderful recipe!

Perfect! This is the last pie crust recipe I'll ever need to try. I didn't change a thing.Note: If using to make a lattice crust top...brush with egg whites to keep from cracking.

If you are nervous about making your own crust...TRY THIS RECIPE!!! This is the easiest time I ever had working with a pie crust and it was BY FAR the tastiest crust I've ever tried. I used butter-flavored Crisco and followed the recipe to a T.. I posted a pic, it turned out wonderfully. Everyone loved :) Thanks for posting the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

This pie crust was sooooo good! It was buttery and flaky to perfection. Not very sweet which I enjoy. Perfect with Grandma Ople's apple pie recipe on this site. Also for the pumpkin pie I reviewed. I'll never buy a premade crust again!

In my opinion this recipe was just OK.  I much prefer a recipe with butter and shortening.  The butter gives it taste, while the shortening gives it the flakiness everyone loves in a pie crust.

I usely don't take time to rate but I just had to on this one.  As I said in the raspberry pie I recipe review, this crust is phenomenal!  It is so forgiving and easy to work with.  I love to cook but never liked working with fussy crusts so not many pies at our house.  I just took 2 raspberry pies out of the oven and couldn't be more proud - 3rd time I've used this recipe.  They are so flaky and tender.  I get 2 double crusts plus I think enough to make one more single.  I guess I roll thinner than other reviewer.

The Best Pie Crust I have tasted.  I have been making a pie crust from a recipe dating back from my Great Grandmother.  I introduced this pie crust at our last family gathering and my mom and Grandmother were both ready to replace the family secret recipe with this one.  They are actually very similar recipes, but this one is more flavorful!  This is a keeper!!!

Wow.. talk about tender flakey crust!  Wonderful!  I made the crust and put it in a tart pan, and made mini apple pies I used Apple Pie by Grandma Ople (from this site) and also topped it with Crumb Topping for Pies (from this site)  Wow, this is a keeper.  Thanks a bunch!  Best crust I have ever tasted!

Excellent recipe...very tasty, hubby approved. :-)  I do have to agree though: this makes 3 single crusts rather than 4.  I used one with a buttermilk pie and have refrigerated the other two for future use.  Thanks, Ruth's Grandma!

I've never made a pie crust before, but I was seduced by the "no fail" promise. I had a heck of a time trying to figure out how to roll out and get it into the pan. Eventually it almost seemed like I'd just sort of pressed globs of it into the bottom of the pan (that's not entirely true, but it sure seemed like it when I was working).

I used it for Chicken Pot Pie and it tasted so freakin' good. I used all standard, unflavored crisco and no one could tell. It wasn't too pretty, but man was it delicious. Definitely give this one a shot! :)

I have always been intimidated to make my own pie crust.........look no further.........beyond simple and easy.  I used this crust to make Grandma Ople's apple pie.  I used butter crisco shortening and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough.  Delicious.  Beginner pie makers.........look no further for a good and simple pie crust.

This was the first crust I ever made and it was awesome! I was getting king of worried because I thought I was handling it too much but, it still tasted great. The crust was flaky and soft all at the same time! I loved it-So, did my husband.

I've made this crust several times with our apple pie slices.  We love it.  It is a perfect sized recipe since I use a jelly roll pan and we like thick crusts.  Any extras that get trimmed off make great cinnamon pie crispies, too.  This crust has flavor.  A nice compliment to a sweet pie, would be good with a savory pie, too.  IT took me a while to get used to the egg flavor in the crust with the pie crispies, but we soon fell in love with it there as well.  We just love the texture, it is flaky and melt in your mouth (as long as you don't work too long with it).  Try it... it is a great recipe!

Made exactly as directed - this crust was perfectly flaky, rich and yet not excessively oily. Quite possibly one of the best pie crusts I've tasted. I was amazed that the bottom of my crust was still flaky despite the apple pie filling that I thought would have made it soggy. Ruth is a genius - I don't doubt that this 100 year tradition that will last forever!

I'm no novice baker by any means but this is my first time making pies completely from scratch.  This crust recipe bakes up beautifully and is very easy to work with. The flakiness is perfect.  This is my one and only crust recipe from now on.

This pie crust is amazing. I tried another recipe first and it kept falling apart, so I went back online and found this one. It was easy to roll out (I rolled it out on saran wrap like other reviewer's mentioned). And after baking, the crust turned out PERFECT! When cutting the pie, it retained it's shape and it tasted wonderful.

I try a different pie crust almost every time I make a pie and I loved this one.  It's non-offensive (not too sweet, too bland, too shortening-y, etc)  and it turns such a pretty color.  It's nice to have the extra dough waiting in the freezer, also.

This is the best crust I have had. Very tasty. I have to use gluten free flour and it was still great. I used my food processor for a quick mix, and rolled it out between plastic wrap to make it easy to place in The pan. This will be my new go to recipe.

I used this recipe for a thick lie crust on a veggie pot pie and it was AMAZING! The only thing I'd do differently is to use a little less sugar for savory recipies. I will make this again.

I gave up making pies for quite a while because I couldn’t find a crust I liked. I decided to try it again this Thanksgiving and this one was perfect! It rolled beautifully and was very light and flaky. Everyone loved it!

This is a wonderful recipe! It is so easy to make and it turns out perfect every time. We live at high altitude so I wasn’t sure if the crust would turn out as well up here, but I don’t  change anything in the ingredients and they always cook up beautifully! I get loads of compliments on the flavor of this crust no matter what I’m baking, sweet or savory. It makes two 9in bottom crusts or one 9in double crust. If you roll out really thin you can get three bottom crusts out if you really need to. My 12 year old is really starting to cook and she makes this on her own with very little help from me, including the rolling out. It’s just a perfect recipe!

After trying 4 other crust recipes I found this one. With all of the others I could count on having to roll out 4 to end up with 2 usable crusts that didn’t fall apart. After 20 or so with this recipe I’ve yet to lose a single crust. The reason is the egg and a little additional water in this recipe. Oh, and you get a great tasting flaky crust to boot.

Very bland. Very basic crust. This was made for an apple pie so one alteration had to be made. I added 1 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. The directions could be more helpful about rolling it out and plastic wrapping it and placing it flat in the fridge for 20 mins. 30 mins the dough is too hard to form into a pan and it cracks. If at room temperature, it stretches and falls apart. 20 mins proved to be a good amount of time.

I made it the first time without changes but did not like all that sugar.  Now I make it with no sugar for savory pies and less than half the sugar for sweet pies!  This was also my grandmothers recipe (including almost the same amount of sugar that I always had to change too lol)

You cant go wrong with this recipe.

I totally agree with Naples and Candice.. I made this 4 different times because I thought I possibly made a mistake on the amount and flavor. Something desperately wrong with the amount and no flavor at all I even tried almond extract vanilla extract it did nothing that resembles a pie crust also I found it difficult to work with even altering the measurements all of the ingredients.. you can't beat Grandma's Old Fashioned pie crust it takes a little longer but well worth it

I can  finally say I baked an awesome pie crust! I thought I was a failure at pie crusts but this recipe you can’t screw up. It truly is foolproof! I would always cheat by buying a store bought crust then roll it out to pass as mine. Not anymore!

This is the only pie crust that worked for me. I had been buying my crusts but really wanted to make my own. After throwing 2 or3 out I tried this. I love it. I get 3 crusts.(a good cook could probably get 4). I freeze what I don’t use and that one came out perfect too.

My new go to pie crest recipe! I made it with a mixture of butter flavored shortening and regular. But that is the only changed I made. It so easy to work with and rolled out beautifully. And had great flavor. Everyone of my crust loving family said it tasted great!

We used this pie crust recipe with Apple Pie by Grandma Ople and they were both amazing!  We were a little nervous at first that it might be too dry, but we resisted the temptation to add to the pie crust recipe and we were glad we did.  It came out perfect and very delicious!  Great pie crust recipe!

Use White Lily flour & Crisco shortening.1 tbsp of softened (not melted) butter mixed into the shortening to equal the 1 3/4 mixed together (not additional measure.) Add 1 extra tbsp of sugar. Use a flour sifter or wire strainer to sift all of the dry ingredients into the bowl together. If you don’t have a pastry cutter, you can use two butter knives held together with one hand to cut the flour.Make sure to cut the mixture of flour & shortening until it resembles corn meal or sand before adding the liquids. (Do this when making biscuits as well.) The dough can be made 1 or 2 days in advance & kept in the fridge or frozen. Roll out some plastic wrap ample size to cover one section of dough. Lay it down and spray the center of the plastic wrap where you will be placing a portion of the dough. Roll the dough into 3 or 4 large balls. Place each 1 in their own section of plastic wrap and seal it. Take each plastic wrap covered round ball of dough into a freezable plastic bag that seals. Put them into the fridge or freeze them. They can be kept in the freezer for 2 or 3 months. Just take the ones you need out & put them in the fridge to thaw a day or 2 in advance. Take them out & let them come to room temperature before you roll them out for pie crust. This crust is great for quiche. I always make a little extra and keep the dough in the freezer until time to make quiche.

I really liked how this crust turned out. It was delicious and quick. I used it for a rose shaped apple pie on Thanksgiving instead of a store bought crust and I'm glad I did. I really recommend this crust.

I’ve never been able to successfully make a pie crust that actually works and tastes amazing. This crust is AMAZING! It’s also simple to do. I made an apple blackberry pie over thanksgiving and the entire family raved about my pie crust and said its the best crust they’ve ever tasted. My picky daughter who always throws the crust away, ate every bit of the crust, then asked me for the recipe! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It’s going to be my go-to pie crust recipe from this day forward!

This was easy to just press into a pan. With thin crusts, many pies can be made.

A fan favorite for any recipe that requires a crust! The flavor is perfect. Not overbearing. When making for one pie, the crust is thick but flavorful. Not doughy or dry! I made it exactly how the recipe called for it to be made also.

I only make pies a few times a year but any time I do, this is my go-to crust. I use butter flavored shortening and it’s practically foolproof. It is a thick, chewy, flaky crust and the absolute best crust recipe I have tried!

I have been making this crust for several years now.  When I first started making it, it seemed to not be moist enough but that’s because I kept substituting butter. Stick with the shortening. It’s delicious.

I've used this recipe a few times now for pot pies and apple pies. It is always a winner. I have been known to reduce the butter by one stick with no ill effects, but when I'm making pies for a bake sale or potluck, I say to heck with it and go all in.   It's a great recipe. I didn't think I could bake until I tried making an apple pie last Thanksgiving using this crust. Now I always hype people up about my pies and when they ask if it's from scratch, I go on and on about how I have the perfect crust recipe and wouldn't dare insult my baking skills by using a pre made crust! Thank you for sharing your amazing recipe with us!

I love this pie crust! If I’m making a fruit pie, I add a little bit more sugar, but otherwise I use it just as written. Make sure to thoroughly chill your butter or shortening and use ice water. I always get compliments for this crust. When chilled it’s easy to handle.

Used this to make a 2-crust apple pie and had plenty left over to make 12 mini apple pies in a muffin tin.  I received so many compliments on it and this crust is truly delicious!!!  I tend to buy refrigerated crust due to convenience, but I don’t think my family will let me get by with that anymore!

My 11 year old grand daughter made this her self! I supervised, she did it all. Then we made a chicken pot pie with it! EVERYONE loved it. Not one crumb left. this recipe makes 3 single  crusts, so plenty for a large double crust pie and a single crust pie. We are going  to try beef  pasties next. The apple pie we made was Amazing. I love love love this crust! Flaky, tasty, and easy! Thank you so much Ruth, for sharing!

I love this recipe.  I have used the crust for pot pies, tarts, pies, turnovers.  It is an easy no fall recipe.  The dough is easy to make and fun to use.  The crust is sweet, so if you need a crest that is savoury omit the sugar.

Tasted great but make sure to use Medium size eggs.  My dough was too wet and I had to add a lot of extra flour.

This is the most amazing pie crust ever! My grandmother Ruth had a pie crust recipe that made the most awesome crust ever,  but when she passed and the estate took over, we weren’t able to find it. This is the exact recipe and I love it still! Since rediscovering it, I’ve used veggie shortening, animal tallow, and butter. I find that like others said, the butter makes a denser crust but it’s still delicious and worth it if it’s what you have on hand! But the flakiness the shortening and tallow give it are out of this world delicious. Freeze the leftover extra crust to use for a one crust or lattice pie, or use it to cover the naked spots on your pot pie where people picked off extra crust when you reheat the leftovers the next day! FYI...the first time I made this, I used an oval cast iron casserole dish so the crust made the perfect amount for that type of oblong, bigger dish. So if that’s what you’re using, it’ll be perfect for the top and bottom!!! TRY IT!!!!!

Turn the serving size to 10 for one pie crust.  Then I also substitute 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour for regular flour for some crunch, yum!  Bake empty shell at 375 for 20-30 minutes.

Great recipe! I halved the recipe and used cold butter instead of shortening and it turned out great! I did have a bit of trouble rolling and shaping the dough, but that’s due to my inexperience-I’ve never made a pie crust before. I made this along with the recipe for Grandma Ople’s Apple pie, and it was the perfect pie! Will make again.

Excellent recipe. I grew my own pumpkins this summer and when used in this recipe, it tastes great!  I use ‘Ruth’s Grandmas Pie Crust from this site. It is a perfect pairing. I have found that I need to bake 60 minutes or the center isn’t firm. Other than that, it is perfect.

This crust is easy enough to make, and freezes fabulously. I just baked a quiche on a crust that was frozen for months, thawed overnight in the fridge, and set out for 20 minutes before patting it into the pie plate. It's super perfect when fresh. Frozen for that long it was a little dry putting it into the pan, but came out great, not soggy at all (and not pre-baked), and with the same great flavor. It's my go-to crust.

I’ve always used my grandmother’s recipe (similar, but no egg), but decided to try this. Loved it! It held together better for transfer after rolling out to the pie pan, but was still light and delicious. I made 3 single crust pies with this (Thanksgiving)—it went well with both traditional pumpkin and dutch apple with streusel topping.

Genius pie crust recipe! You canot abuse this crust! It is indestructible! Adjust the liquid if your dough is too dry. I find I can re-roll this dough many times, add more flour, etc. and still have a great crust.  I use half the amount of salt.
I find the amount is just right for a generous 2-crust pie. You will also have a generous amount of leftover crust.  I spread butter and cinnamon sugar on the leftover crust and roll it up and bake it! This is great especially for those making their holiday pies in advance. You get to have a little treat before pie day.
Thank you for this recipe. I have shared it many times.

This was my first time making pie crust, so I was a little nervous, but it turned out great! As other reviewers suggested, I used butter flavor Crisco sticks and it was amazing. My guests raved about it, and it was easy to work with. I made it with the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe. I doubled the pot pie recipe and made it in a 9x11 casserole dish, the pie crust made the perfect amount to have a top and bottom layer for the chicken pot pie. Yum!

Wow. This crust recipe is AMAZING! I first encountered it while baking a pie with my best friend and her twin 6-year-olds. You may not believe me when I tell you that, even after being manhandled by all 4 of us and subjected to some possibly not-entirely-accurate measurements, it was great! I snobbily expected second rate crust, but nosiree. It was perfect.
So, at home, I made it myself, with correct measurements, a tbsp of vinegar to inhibit the gluten, a mix of half shortening and half butter, and minimal handling and, holy expletive! It is THE  BEST crust I have ever had and I MADE IT!! I will never use another recipe.
I tried to submit pic's of my delicious hand pies, but apparently my phone pic's don't have enough pixels...

Superb, flaky crust. I used butter flavored shortening per another suggestion and it got rave reviews from my mother, an expert pie maker!

The best tasting pie crust EVER!!!! I used iced cold butter,as I no longer use vegetable shortening in any of my baking. Still,the pie crust made my deep dish peach pie taste incredibly delicious!! Did my fresh peaches from the peach tree in my yard credit! I highly reccomend this pie crust!

This is a crowd pleasing recipe. Every time I make it, people rave about it. I've used it for sweet and savory pies with equal effect. The reviews that state it's not quite enough for two pies are correct. It's perfect for a casserole pot pie or two small sweet pies (or one large). Also, refrigeration for 30 min is absolutely necessary.

I cut the recipe in half and substituted two Tablespoons of shortening with butter because I like my pie crust to have a little bit of a butter flavor.
It was very easy to make and will probably become my go to crust recipe.

Followed the directions and it turned out great for a quiche crust. The recipe makes for a LOT more than what I needed, but  I threw what I didn't use into the fridge and plan on making another with the remains soon.

Bravo, this pie crust is wonderful.  My house burned down in a wild fire and I lost all my recipes.  This one is better than the recipe I used to have, thank you! For those who found it a little dry, just add water, a teaspoon at a time until it is the proper consistency.

Im usually terrified of rolling out crusts.  Ive tried several times only to have it all fall apart on me.  I found this crust incredibly easy to make and roll out----i didnt even chill it very long before rolling---and I still had no problems.  This will definitely be my "go to" crust.  No more store bought for me!!  Thx for the recipe.

Couldn't believe how easy this was to make. Used it for chicken pot pie, and everyone loved it. Used the same recipe when I was making an apple pie, turned out just as good. Received compliments both times. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

Add another name to the long list of fans of Ruth's grandma! When she said no-fail, she meant it. I followed the recipe exactly, just using cane sugar in place of white and butter flavor Crisco. When rolling it out, it crumbled ridiculously so I had to do a bit of patching when I put it in the pie pan but it was WELL worth the extra work. I paired the crust first with Chef John's peach pie and then with pecan pie from another site. Absolute best crust I've ever made or tasted- the crust was premier along with the filling and not just an afterthought. Definitely try this recipe!

Easy and delicious pie crust.  Instead of shortening I used about half and half butter and lard.  Used food processor instead of pastry cutter.  Came out perfect and tasty.

The crust tasted great but I found the dough difficult to work with. I live in a very hot, humid climate so maybe that is the reason. My crust didn't look good as it all fell apart transferring it to the pie plate but everyone loved the taste.

Love this crust I cut it have for a one crust pie. Easy to make and it's been great every time. I was out of crisco so I used the other top pie crust recipe on here that uses only butter and it was not nearly as good.

I put the dry ingredients in a food processor, and added the water and egg through the top. It worked beautifully and there was enough dough for a chicken pot pie and a quick made in smaller circumference deep dish corelle ware. This is the best pie crust I have ever used.

This was such a good crust!  I ran out of crisco so I used some unsalted  butter also. I did use most of the water and mine split as I rolled it in the ball. I couldn't get it to look very pretty (my mistake I'm sure) but it was so tasty.

It was okay, but not flaky at all.  I had enough for a 2 crust pie.  It had no taste.  It's okay in a pinch, but if I'm in a pinch and have these ingredients, I have enough ingredients for a flaky crust.

I made this yesterday but screwed up due to converting to uk measurement in grams, I actually didn't put enough flour in it so my recipe was 350grams of butter and lard together and I only by mistake did 2 cups of flour (500 g) and the 3 tablespoons of sugar no water because  my lovely kitchenaid mister  did the mixing and it just went into a ball I thought it was strange so pressed it out a little into two discs cos naturally I didn't add enough flour so un-beknownst to me didn't realise until after chilling I decided to roll out, well it was crumbly as heck but did it and pressed it into a 9 inch flan tin made my sliced apples and and did streusel topping on top and baked for 1 hour on 180 c fan oven and hey presto it looked good, this evening we sliced it ate and guess what it was the loveliest shortbread tasting pastry I have ever tasted! so although I gave three stars I really should have given five the three stars are my fault entirely.

Great recipe! Makes one and a half crust (one double crust and one additional single crust). I used butter flavored Crisco. Froze the Crisco and grated it into the mixture. Next time I might use half butter, as Crisco is just really soft, even when frozen. After mixing it needs to  chill in refrigerator at least 30 minutes. I rolled it out in between floured plastic wrap, put it in the pie plate and let it sit in the refrigerator again for about 30 minutes. Brushed with egg white and baked some more before adding filling. I have also made it ahead of time and that works too.

I will use this for my go-to pie crust.  I make a double batch and keep some of the dry mix in the freezer in a zip lock for my next pie.  I use half crisco and half cold graded unsalted butter.  I also add 2 tsp. vinegar to the water/egg mixture.

Its tastes good-ish, but recipe didn't have instructions on how long to bake the crust, which was very confusing. Thankfully, I got help from my Grandma on the pie crust. This was my first crust, and its a good starter pie crust recipe. Just would love baking instructions.

I've made this a couple of times now, and the flavor is amazing. What knocks this down to a 3 is the malleability of the dough- it's impossible to roll out and place in a pie tin AND get it to stay in one piece.

I made this crust for an apple pie for Thanksgiving.  I made an incredible looking apple pie, braided the crust edges and hand cut a leaf pattern for the top crust.  Everyone said it was to pretty to cut.  Once it was cut, they said it was not only pretty, but tasted great.  I had several comments saying how good the crust was.  My Dad called me the next day and said that it was the best apple pie that he had ever had and wanted to know when I was making another one.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  It was a bit hard to work with, but is very forgiving.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written.

Very nice pie crust to make and use. Treat pie crusts gently, never over mix.  This recipe makes a single crust and a double crust. A go to crust. Yeah!

This is the BEST recipe I've come across. It's so tasty and flaky, just perfect. Mine made 3 crusts total, plus a little extra. Not sure if I made my crusts thicker than they needed to be but I love pie crust. I'll definitely be using this again.

I used this pie crust recipe for thanksgiving pies this year. It as my first time using this recipe and it worked flawlessly. I used the butter flavored shortening as suggested and the result was a tender flaky pie crust that melted in your mouth. Made sweet potato and coconut custard pies. They were big hits. Thanks Ruth's Grandma.

I made this as written and with a teaspoon of vibegar added. As written the crust is tender with vinegar it was more flaky. Both versions were delicious and 5 star.

Dough is very easy to work with and crust flavor is excellent. I don't know that it would make 2 whole pies, but it is a great recipe.

This was the first pie crust I ever made. It is fabulous. I have used this crust for both Pumpkin & Apple pie, and it is the perfect crust for the "light and flaky" crust you want with those pies. People rave about it, and I love it. I always use the 9.5" pie size, and if I had any "newbie" recommendations, it would be to make sure you don't make the crust too thick. The first time I used the recipe, I put too much on the bottom and did not have enough for the Apple Pie lattice on top. It was kind of 'crust pie with some apples.' But after that first test pie, I figured it out quickly, and can now make it just right. Thank you!!

Perfect crust recipe! Flakey, buttery and makes just enough for one thicker crust pie or two thinner crust pies. We made one thicker crust pie then brushed the remaining dough with melted butter, sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar, rolled it up and baked it for some mini-cinnamon roll treats. Yum!

My first homemade crust.  This really is  foolproof! Easy to make and turned out tasty and flakey!  I did substitute butter instead of the shortening, but I mad sure to use cold butter and it worked out well.

I made this...I must of done something wrong because it was beyond sticky. I needed about 5 cups of flour just to make it roll-able. I even threw it in the freezer. Maybe 1 3/4 cups of shortening was too much? I hope it takes better than it smells  and the consistency was like playdoh.

This crust was extremely difficult to work with. I was unable to  place it in the pie pan without it tearing repeatedly. I rolled it several times and it would not hold together. It simply ripped apart. I gave up and threw it in the trash can. I'll keep using my family's recipe that has been passed down for generations.

I've never made a pie crust from scratch before, and this came out amazing. Extremely easy to make, and it turned into a perfect, flaky, tender, melt in your mouth crust for my pot pie. Stellar. Five stars.

This is the same recipe that I learned from my Grandmother when I was just a boy.  The only difference is that we used 1 1/2 times the ingredients.   We would always bake the leftover pie dough with cinnamon and sugar, it makes a great treat for the kids.

If you change the serving size to 40 you will have enough dough for two two-crust pies.

The reviews are correct - this crust is delicious. I found it a little more difficult to work with compared to traditional crusts. Mine wanted to break a lot and loved to stick to my rolling pin and floured surface. I don't think it would be great for elaborate lattice work but I still think I will us

This is a very flavorful and flaky crust.  I do not consider myself a pie expert by any means, but this crust is amazing.  I upped the servings to 40 and that gave me extra so I wouldn't run short for two double-crust pies.   The dough can be temperamental; I wrapped it in waxed paper and put it in the freezer until I was ready to use it.  When I rolled it out, I did not use the handles of my rolling pin.  I put my palm on the center of it and rolled it out in little pushes, using flour to make it not stick to the rolling pin.  This dough requires patience.  If you try to roll it from one end to the other in one motion, you'll probably end up with tears.  It is a wonderful, rich-tasting crust, however.

This is the only pie crust I use. I love it and I like that it's enough to do two pie crusts so I can freeze half and use later. I do make a few small modifications. 1 add 1/4 cup of cold butter and then adjust the shortening and I add a tsp of vinegar to the water/egg before I mix it with the flour. I mix it in my stand mixer using the paddle attachment. I prefer to do it this way so that I can add more flour if needed and then I know when it's perfect when the sides are completely cleaned.

Couldn't resist using  this for my apple pie considering it is a 100 year old recipe!  That being said, it was my first shortening based pie crust, and it came out really really well! I refrigerated the crust for about 2 hours  and came out flaky, tender, and yummy!   This recipe yields aprox 2.5 pie crust if you are wondering. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice and both times it was a disaster. I’ve been successfully making pies for close to 50 years and so was surprised that this just didn’t work- so I carefully tried a second time, unfortunately with same results. My crust was very fragile and wanted to break when lifted, so I had to roll it out on wax paper so that I could lift in to the pie pan without breaking. Even so, it was an ugly looking pie. But aesthetics aside, we just didn’t care much for the texture. Flakey is good but this turns into dust in your mouth.  I’ll return to my own tried and true pie crust.

I can't wait to try this for a fruit pie. I used this for a chicken pot pie that turned out amazing. I cut back the sugar to 1 T and added a dash of pepper, garlic and onion powder. I baked it for 30 minutes at 370.

I have never reviewed a recipe on here but the only reason I'm reviewing this is because I've been following this recipe for a couple years and I've always loved it. of course I used butter flavored shortening, because let's face it butter makes everything better. well when I decided to make an Apple pie it was kind of last minute and I had fresh apples my mother in law brought me.  I didn't take stock of my ingredients I only had a cup of shortening but I had butter. so I substituted the 3/4 cup with butter and omg. I loved this recipe before but now it's on a whole new level.  just a simple change made it like heaven on earth. it was a happy non ingredient to have I'm glad I didn't have the extra shortening.

This was the PERFECT crust for a half sheet pan (13"x18") slab pie with a streusel topping. It was just enough crust to cover the pan and make a nice fluted edge.  It baked up perfectly--tender, flakey, delicious. I followed the recipe to a T and found the dough very easy to work with.  I rolled it out on two overlapping sheets of parchment paper lightly dusted with flour.

I've found my pie crust recipe. I've tried lots of recipes, not with diligence, but casually through the years. I've most recently used butter crusts instead of shortening, but there is no flakier crust than a shortening crust.  I am using this now for homemade poptarts so the odd amount of crust it makes is just fine. I did roll it out between parchment paper because I was rushing and didn't want to chill it. Keeping it cool may help with the stickiness. Anyway, thanks Ruth's grandma!

I have made this crust several times and every time it is perfect. Will never use another one. Several people have complained about the excess crust, but I make a lattice top and then use the leftover for pie crust cookies. My grandmother used to make these cookies and they r almost as wonderful as the pie. I make 2" balls and roll them as for pie crust, pinch the edges and then add thinly sliced butter, sugar and cinnamon to the center.  Bake with the pie until  brown.  I do use butter flavored shortening and ice water with the egg.

This is evidently a fool proof recipe. I forgot 1/2 cup of butter out of the bowl until after it was all mixed. But managed to finally get it all mixed in. It still turned out great. Crisp and flakey. Made it with fresh peaches and it was the hit of the pie!

I was disappointed in how dry this dough was. I might make it again and use lard and maybe another teaspoon or two of ice water.

I cannot fathom why this recipe has 5 stars. I made the dough for a pie that I was making right away. The dough was extremely sticky & impossible to work with.  When I was rolling it I kept having to add flour (like every 2 seconds) to keep the crust from sticking to the counter & my roller.  When I transferred the crust to the pie plate, it stuck to itself & then fell apart.  I ended up throwing the dough away and making my mother's recipe (which always comes out right).  I make pies a lot and thought it would be fun to try a new recipe for crust. Boy was I wrong!  Usually pie crust recipes call for ice water or refrigeration before rolling. This called for neither & I did neither. I am guessing that was the problem.

I used 1 1/2 cups of regular shortening (not butter flavored, which is full of chemicals) and substituted the last 1/4 cusp of shortening with butter. So it was flavorful and flaky. And make sure the water is almost forming ice. The warmer the water, the less flaky it will be.

I have been cooking for my mother who is 91 for awhile now.  Her request was her favorite, a cherry pie.  I have never tried to make a homemade crust, but have always wanted to.  I made this recipe and my very picky mother said it was award winning.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Ruth's grandma may have passed, but she will live on through her pie crust. Seriously, it started with me and everyone thought I was a pie genius, then I passed the secret on to my wife, who passed it on to her daughter and daughter in law, and on and on. If there is anything as a lifetime tribute and honor of love, this is it!

So freakin' good! I made a 9.5" pecan pie and used half of this recipe. I guess you would use the original 32 serving amount if you were making a pie with a crust top. I used Crisco butter flavored shortening and it was fantastic! I am saving this recipe and using it for all pies and even my quiches. Thanks Ruth!

I've never made pie crust before, so I tried this recipe. It was easy and worked well. The pie is delicious!
I made half the recipe and it barely covered my pie. I would recommend making 10-20% more than what the recipe calls for.

This crust is flaky, tender, and delicious. I actually prepared it just to make pie crust treats with butter, cinnamon, and sugar, and it was wonderful. I mixed everything up in my food processor, and that made things easy. I also used butter flavored crisco because I use it whenever a recipe calls for shortening. I can't wait to make this again when I make some apple pies!

Loved it.  It did make an unusual amount but I just made some tart shells with the rest and froze them to fill at a later time. A friend who has won several blue ribbons for her pies at county fairs over the years even asked for the recipe!  It's my new go to pie crust recipe.  BTW  I baked and froze a peanut butter pie in this crust and it thawed beautifully.  No one knew it wasn't baked fresh that day.

This crust is absolutely the best.  I used it to make chicken pot pie in 2 cup bowls. I had too much left over so I took it to the neighbor. His comment was that the crust " was to die for". You can't get any better than that.

My first time making a pie crust and it turned out very good. It didn't look the best because I need more practice rolling it out but it didn't matter since it tasted good and was flaky.

Silly me, I was looking for the directions on cooking the shells as if they are cooked when you buy them at the store.  I finally came to my senses and realized the time and temperture was on me!  I wanted to try coconut oil instead of the shortening and this was a great choice.  I did have a time trying to roll it out maybe because I didn't have a rolling pin, however, I improvised; that didn't work either so I made it simple and just threw pieces of dough in my pie dish and used my hands to form my crust.  Now how easy was that?!!  Only wanted to make one pie, so I split the other dough into 2 balls smashed them down so they would set flat inside the freezer bag.  Now I'm prepared the for the next time I have the urge to bake.  Pretty simple recipe, I can see doing this again.

After reading other reviews regarding the amount of dough this recipe makes, I decided to embrace it. I made 2 pies - a single crust chicken pot shepherds pie and a double crust peach blueberry pie. The dough was super easy to make and rolled out very easily.  It was flakey & flavorful. I rolled it out on parchment paper -then used the paper to form the dough to my pie plates - easiest I've ever worked with.

This crumbly pie crust is easy to make and tastes good. Some say there is only enough crust to make two bottom crusts and one top crust. I haven't had any problem making two lattice topped pies. I plan on making this my go to pie crust recipe.

Turned out perfect!  If you don't have a pastry cutter in your kitchen, use a masher (potato masher).  Works great.  You just have to use a little muscle and a bit of jiggle to get it through the dough.  Nice, flaky and rustic, not nasty like the store bought kind.

Use whole spelt flour.
Needed a touch extra liquid.

Cut recipe in half (used 1 whole egg) and crust was enough for 1 - 9 inch deep dish pie plate.

This is fool proof.  I made no changes.
At first I didn't like it combined with my grandmother's lemon meringue pie recipe but one day in the fridge made the difference. It was yummy. Of course, a lemon meringue  pie doesn't last a long time so must eat quickly!!
AND, yes, I had extra so..... I made a delicious chicken pot pie with the rest of the dough.  It was perfect!!

Great pie crust, easy to work with.  The lemon filling is really good, I added a couple of extra lemons and reduced the amount of water because lemons this time of year in Canada are not that flavourful.

Best crust recipe I have found. Have made apple pie with it and chicken pot pie. It does make more than enough for one. If you roll out enough I use each batch twice. I just freeze the 2nd half and pull out when ready to use! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Awesome! I did not have time to chill the dough but that wasn't an issue. The dough was easy to work with; no complaints. The recipe makes 3 pie shells for deep dish pie plates. The crust is very flakey...wonderful! As suggested, I did use ice water and my egg was at room temperature. I did take the advice of another reviewer: used wax paper for rolling out the dough with my rolling pin....lightly floured. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing such a family treasure!

Found this recipe for my first ever homemade pie, and it was a huge success! It's definitely a full proof recipe. Crust is nice and flaky and easy to work with. I don't use the egg because my husband is allergic, but it turned out just fine. The last time I made it I had no shortening so I used unsalted butter instead, and it was even better. Definitely how I'm going to make it from now on. Great recipe!

This has become my go-to pie crust recipe for my key lime pie. Like others say, it def makes more than one crust but less than two. I usually make a whole pie and mini one. I have been making tons of key lime pie with this but plan on trying it out in the future with other pies. For the best key lime pie I use the one on this site: key lime pie VII

It makes at least 2 double crust pies.  It's delicious and it freezes well.

For me this recipe is just perfect. I actually like it so much that I also use it for making simple unsweetened cookies which are delightfully tasty if served with lime sauce - best dessert ever!

No changes.  This will be our pie crust from now on!  I used regular Crisco (not butter flavored) and it was very flaky and delicious : )

This is such a simple pastry pie recipe. Definitely put it in the fridge before rolling it out.  The taste is good and it's flaky.

I made this AMAZING pie crust tonight for a turkey pot pie and it was soooo good! I did however when the pie was almost done (maybe 5 more minutes) brushed the top and edges with a beaten egg. other than that it was by the recipe and outstanding!! I had enough dough for the top & bottom crust of the pot pie and a bottom and lattice crust for a apple pie. Will definitely save this and use again!!

AWESOME RECIPE!  I come from a long line of German pie bakers. None of us have ever used ready-made crusts. My mom, at 80, still whomps out amazing pies/pie crusts.  However, I broke family tradition & started using this recipe over the holidays.  This crust stays together & is very forgiving for the novice baker.  It is quick & reliable for the expert!  The only tweaking I do is to leave out or drastically reduce the sugar if I'm using the crust for something savory rather than sweet.  I always modify amounts depending upon the number of crusts and size of my pie plates.  This is a can't-miss recipe!  Thanks!!

I thought it was great, and I made it gluten free! Many crust recipes just do not hold up will when gluten free flour is used.  I also used butter-flavored shortening sticks and it was buttery and crispy, and did not crumble much. This is my new go-to crust!

I have looked everywhere for a good flaky pie crust, and I am done looking!  This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I will say, I did make 1 substitution: instead of 1/2 c water, I used 1/4 c water and 1/4 c plain vodka.  That put the pie crust over the edge in terms of light flakiness.

Delicious! People raved about this pie crust! So so good. In fact my husband only got one piece so he had me make it again for him the next day! 

My only negative is that it would not roll out for me. It was very sticky and then it would fall apart in chunks. I ended up just sprinkling in a tiny bit more flour and using my fingers just pushed it into the pie plate. I am a novice pie maker so maybe I did something wrong but it was so so tasty that I will try again! ;) 

Note: I used Crisco butter flavored shortening! Great idea. 

Thanks for a delicious and simple crust recipe!

This is one of the easiest pie crusts I have ever made and the flavor was awesome!  It has a wonderful flakiness that is wanted by every baker.   I did not have to change a thing nor would I.  Thank you for this recipe.  I have already passed it on to my daughter-in-law.

I weigh my items and found that this dough was way too sticky so i added a handlful of flour and rolled between paper so I could handle it. I agree that the instructions needed to say cold water and put in the fridge...but I used it for a lemon pie and it turned out light and flaky so it worked out.  I cut the recipe down to half and still had enough dough for at least one more.

I made this crust and used 1/2 of the dough for a nine inch crust and froze the other half.  A week later I thawed the second half and had enough for a second nine inch crust.  I got rave reviews on this crust.  It was very tender, easy to work with and delicious.  Key - don't over work it.

In my 40 + years of baking, I always shied away from scratch crust because mine never turned out. Barbara, thank you, thank you, thank you for posting Ruth's Grandmas pie crust. Not only is it easy to work with but it is without a doubt the very best crust I have ever had.

This... was great. I was sure I would, and had, screwed this up in a hundred different ways... it was a bit sticky, but man oh man... this turned out brilliantly yummy. Great flavor. Just... one of the best crusts I've ever had. No thanks to me... this was a terrific recipe, and a lot of prayer. I brushed it inside and out with egg, and it turned out so pretty and not soggy at all. Used it for a chicken pot pie. Perfect.

Dough kept sticking to my rolling pin, so I used a spoon to pat it into the pie plate. The taste was superb..we loved the flakiness. Will make again. - used it to make four mini Sweet Potato Pies.

This was my first pie crust ever! and I it was good!!! I make it a little thicker since I was using it for a pot pie and it worked out well, I will try it again for sure. Although I'm not sure how it would go as an apple pie/ dessert crust as it wasn't very sweet. I see other followers using it as a dessert crust so I'm going to try it ... ;) the crust came out nice and flakey.... I didn't have a pastry blender to cut in the flour and dough ( I've been needing one!!) Definitely use one :)

I liked this crust enough to make it two days in a row for pumpkin and apple pies.  I did, however, end up using 5 cups of flour each time, as 4 cups left the dough too wet and unworkable for me.  5 cups seemed perfect.  It rolled oht beautifully and baked up fantastically.  It was firm enough to stand up to the moisture of both pies and light and flaky enough to be enjoyed all by itself at the end of a good slice.  I will definitely be making this many more time.

I've made this crust a few times, and with a few different variations. The first 5 or 6 times I made it, the crust always came out a bit tough and chewy. This time, I decided to use cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, instead of the shortening. HUGE DIFFERENCE. It takes a bit more work to work the crust into a usable dough, but it is SO worth it. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling out, and you'll get the flakiest and most durable crust known to man! Best with pumpkin pie :)

This was the first time I have ever made homemade pie crust.  So from now own this will be my choice of crust recipes to use, it was easy to follow.  My family loved it and never wants me to use a store bought again.

Ok, this is pretty good, but I have some great tips:
Use really cold water, & really cold (not frozen) butter & shortening in small pieces.
For the shortening, I used 3/4 parts butter, 1/4 shortening. It adds just the right amount of flavor, softness, and flavor.
I made 6 crusts, and they were perfect out of the oven with a crust cover.

buttery, flaky and enough to make the southern skillet apple pie on here! Got many compliments on this crust at Thanksgiving!  Easy to make (first pie crust ever!)

Best dough I ever made, perfect in every aspect, beautiful! I wasn't sure if I should roll this out or what. So what I ended up doing was throwing some in the pan (I used a cast iron pan) pound it out till it looked thin/thick enough, them another next to it and so on until it was covered on bottom and sides.  added  apples and stuff, then attempted to roll the top part, sticky, so I will attempt next timer to pound out on wax paper then transfer to pie, I truly don't think it will matter this is da best I have EVER had!

Love,love,love it! I've used a butter crust for years,but I was looking for something better.....this is very easy to prepare and the crust was very tender and flaky. I divided my dough into 3 balls since I was using extra deep pie dishes. Everyone agreed that this is the crust for us. I added my "iced" water a tablespoon at a time like always, to get the right consistency and used nearly all of it. One of my pies needed to be blind baked and I had no problems unlike other reviewers who complained about it falling. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I don't swear when making pies anymore!  
Whoever coined the phrase easy as pie must have been talking about this recipe, It's super easy to get a perfect crust every time with this one. I had tried so many different recipes over the years and could never seem to get it quite right but I've made dozens of pies with Ruth's Grandma's recipe and I haven't had one go wrong yet.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made exactly as stated.  It is tasty, flakey, and easy to roll out. I got two single crusts and one double crust pies.  I will use again.

Just perfect.... I will never make anything but a french crust again.  The egg adds so much flavor and makes the crust easy to work with.  If you use a large egg you'll need less water.  Thanks for posting.

I struggled a lit bit with this actually being too crumbly, I added another teaspoon of water and that seemed to help.  However it was probably something I did because this was my first ever pie.  It ended up rolling wonderfully and came out so light and flaky.  I haven't tasted it yet but I have a feeling it's going to be delicious!  I did what another reviewer suggested and used 1 1/2 cups of unsalted butter and 1/4 cup of butter flavored Crisco.  Definitely a keeper!

Found this recipe for pie crust a couple of years ago. This is a great pie crust! I have used it for pies, pot pies, and other items with a flaky crust. My father liked it so much that he had me make him 14 crusts for the freezer.  Salute to Grandma for her crust, and for sharing this recipe!!

Very good, reliable pie crust dough. I did change it a bit by using 3/4C butter and 1C leaf lard. I like the addition of the egg as I feel it adds structure to the crumb.

I made this crust for an apple pie.  This is my first pie crust and my husband is really picky about his apple pie.  He rates this recipe 5 to of 5.

I found this crust very easy to roll out and patch together when needed.  It was also very light and flaky when cooked.

This made enough for one 2 crusted pie and a single crusted pie.

Great recipe! It was a little too crumbly for my liking to roll out, but definitely workable. I followed the directions to a T; I used ice cold water as other reviewers suggested. I was really pleased with the flavor and flakiness of the crust. Definitely my new go-to!

This is an amazing crust recipe!  The recipe as is is wonderful, and it's even better if you use only 1 cup shorting and 3/4 cup salted butter and omit the added salt.  Still if you follow the recipe as is you're going to have a great crust!  So do it!

Way too much shortening, making the dough impossible to roll without sticking to your rolling pin, even after flouring the rolling surface and adding more flour to the dough.

Spot on. I will use this pie crust recipe every time. Easy. Delicious. The only thing I changed was to make enough for two and a half crusts. I used it on an apple latticed pie and it was wonderful thank you so much!

My two favorite things about this recipe are:  1.) it is simple to make and 2.) it is delicious!  This is probably the best pie crust I've ever eaten...buttery, flaky and a little salty.  Yum!

Always make 1.5 batch (16 servings is normal), then it is easily enough for two covered pies. Perfect recipe, crust is to die for!

I made the crust  as directed with one exception.  I got nervous about the consistency while adding the egg/water mixture, it was looking very sticky and wet.  I stopped adding the water which may have been a mistake.  I could not roll this out to save my life, it kept falling apart.  I ended up piecing the dough together for both dishes I was making, very frustrated, thinking that this would be the last time I made it.  We made a chicken pot pie and an apple pie.  I held my breath as I took the first bite of what looked like a mess and OMG it was delicious...  the pie was the same.  Rich texture, buttery flavor ( I used butter Crisco), and it cooked so flaky and golden.  
I will have to work on this again to try and get a better consistency but even if I don't I will use this again and again, it was absolutely amazing tasting!!  Thank you for the recipe, and if you have any tips on how to roll it out without it falling apart I will take them :)

this is the best pie crust I've ever had. Most pies I don't even eat the crust, I find them dry and flavorless. but after trying this recipe It's going to be the crust i use for my pies I might even make the crust a little thicker next time I use it.

After reading reviews, and seeing so many people say it wasn't quite enough to make two pies, I adjusted the number of servings to 36 (which changed all the ingredient measurements automatically).  With that change, I had enough dough to make two 8" top-crust pies.  Since I only needed two 8" single-crusts, I split the dough into 4 balls and froze two for later use.  Other than changing the serving size, I followed the recipe exactly.  The finished crusts came out perfect and tasted great!

The only pie crust recipe I use.  Never fails!  I use butter flavored Cisco for the shortening and it makes a wonderful buttery flavor crust.  Use with chicken pot pie, or fruit pies.  Mmm, the best.

This is the absolute best pie crust I've ever had/used in kind of picky about the crust I usually avoid it and only eat the filling because most of the time it's so dry but I've been eating this crust plain even it's delicious! Also people are telling me to open a bakery and asking when it'll be open and stuff..I do want one but I'll have to wait until I'm 18 at least for that. They started saying that after the pie crust it really is the best I've had

OMG! When you have a professional baker ask for your recipe, you know you have a winner! I could never get my crusts just right, until this one. 

I used this AS IS for a deep dish lemon meringue and for a deep dish chicken pot pie. Because the pie dishes are so large I got only two crusts total so the chicken pot pie had only a top crust. The sugar was just right for fruit pies but a little odd for food pies, so next time I won't add the sugar for the next chicken pot pie (Chicken pot pie IX from here) which was also completely awesome!

Thank you Ruth's Grandma for an exquisitely simple yet awesome recipe and thank you Ruth for posting it for the rest of us!!

This recipe was my very first attempt at a pie crust.  I followed the given directions.  The finished product was great!  I'll never buy store bought again!  I may try some of the other suggestion changes that other reviews have mentioned... But for now I'm overly happy with the given recipe.

I will give this a 2 stars for good flavor but I could not get it to roll out for me. Stuck to everything,,,but would not hold together.  It cracked and crumbled.  I did chill the dough first. Any suggestions?

I followed the directions exactly. The crust was flaky, but it's not very flavorful.  Maybe, it needed more salt then the 2 teaspoons. It tasted like the shortening.  I used this recipe for chicken pot pie, so it was ok.  Everything else with texture,  baking turned out awesome.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome pie crust! So easy to make, rolls out nicely but still has a great taste. I've tried tons of pie crust recipes but this is definitely my favorite! Because I was running low on shortening, I subbed margarine and butter for half of the shortening called for, and will do the same when I make this crust again. I also added a little more salt (maybe an extra 1/2 teaspoon or so) than called for since I was making pot pie from two of the crusts. Delicious in both sweet and savory pies even with a little more salt. Thank you for sharing!

WOW, tried this recipe today 5/20/2015 and it was super easy to put together. Easier than any other pie crust recipe, I believe due to the egg.  No extra water was required.  I thought perhaps the shortening seemed like an awful lot, But, it's exactly correct and this rolled out like a dream, I even made my first lattice top crust and it was a huge success, paired w/the blueberry pie recipe, from this site*!* My Thanks to Barbara C and her Grandma Ruth, a genious even then.

I have been baking since I was a child, and like many others it took me many years to perfect the art of pie crust. Unfortunately I recently lost many of my recipes and found myself sifting through the numerous recipes online. This is a terrific recipe and after making it several times I have found it to be true every time to the listed measurements. The only change I make is to add 1 Tbsp of white vinegar. Thank you for all the previous reviews that helped me choose this recipe and for the person who took the time to post it.

I made a cranberry apple pie with this crust recipe and got good reviews from my family. One even liked the crust more than the pie filling. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid the additives in store-bought crusts, but it has a bit of shortening in it, so if you're looking to be healthy, I suggest a shortening alternative.

Instead of rolling the crust, I pressed it in the pie pan and that worked great. I did 10 servings and that made just the right amount for a 10 inch pie pan. I will cut the salt in 1/2 next time.

This seriously is the best and easiest pie crust!  Until this point, I had used my grandma's trusty pie crust recipe for all my pies, but I wanted to try something different for Christmas dessert.  I only had a cup of shortening, so I also used unsalted butter, and the combination really worked well!  This is a very tasty, flaky crust that is very easy to work with.  I highly recommend it with the "Best Cherry Pie" recipe on this site!  Yum!

still in the process of baking it.  What I don't get is many recipes never say how long to bake, does one need to prick the bottom?  Sure would help people that are not as experienced in baking.... one more thing, do you grease the pie pan???  Wish people would complete the recipes !!!!!!!

I did not care for this recipe. Tasted like a pot pie crust rather than a dessert pie. I'm not a great baker but I can follow directions. It was hard to work with but I chalk that up to me..but the finished product was greasy and not sweet enough at all. Really not good for a fruit pie

Excellent.  I substitute coconut oil & butter for the shortening which makes it a little harder to manage but still awesome.  I use for chicken pot pie, quiches and any dessert calling for pie crust!  Never fail recipe. 5+ stars

This recipe is perfect! I am no longer intimidated by the ominous task of producing a successful pie crust. It has everything I look for in a pie crust...flakey, slightly sweet, buttery (I used half butter flavored Crisco & half unsalted butter). And equally important...it is easy, easy, easy to make. If you follow the video instructions, you will be very happy with your pie crust. IT IS A DEFINITE KEEPER! !

This was fantastic!!!  The crust was so easy to work with and delicious!!!  I've made it twice so far.  Once with all lard and once with just a little bit of lard (I ran out) and the rest butter.  Great both times!!!  I wouldn't change a thing!!!  (There is not too much salt!  It was just right!)

This recipe worked out fairly well. It was a bit dry and crumbly (before baking), but I followed the directions exactly. Not sure why! It was the first pie crust I ever made from scratch so it could be something with technique? I YouTube'd a video on how to roll the dough. It didn't roll as thin as I think it is supposed to roll. (Perhaps because it was on the dry side.) But, it tasted great and made enough for 1 large (9") pie and 1 small pie so I would try again.

Yes I love this receipe! Flakey and good. I had a lot of pies to make even a lemon pie. Not sure if it would pair up, or if u should have used a gram cracker crust. I'm glad I didn't. Thanks for the receipe this one is a keeper!

My first pie crust and it was AWESOME! I used "real" lard (rendered animal fat) which I bought awhile ago at an farmers market.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I made a lattice work top and a bottom crust for "Grandma Ople's Apple Pie (recipe found here) plus I made 2 bottom crusts for pumpkin pies.  NEVER will I buy premade crusts again!  This recipe was quick and simple.  You will not be disappointed!

I've always used store-bought pie crust, but wanted to make an apple pie, completely from scratch, for Thanksgiving. This recipe seemed simple and the reviews were great, so I tried it. I used butter-flavored shortening, and it came out flaky and delicious! Next time, I will start with 1/4c. water and add more if needed, as the 1/2c. made it a little too wet. I brushed it with milk and it baked up perfectly golden. Now I don't have to be intimidated by making a crust from scratch! This one would be great for anything - sweet or savory.

Thank you for sharing! What a fantastic pie crust.  
I used other reviewers suggestions and halved this recipe for a 9" deep dish.  Still had a decent amount of unused crust.  The flavor and flakiness of this crust really complimented my pie. Thank you again!

This pie crust is ok, but not great!  It was very easy to make and that is why I strayed from my usual crust recipe. The feel of the dough was awesome and the crumbs came together with no effort at all. The crust baked beautiful and even and I was excited to try it...but was not great!  It was really salty and the odd thing was...I only used a single teaspoon, instead of the 2 teaspoons (which I thought was too much). Other things I am taking into consideration that may have made this crust taste not so great...I used Organic Flour and Non-Hydrogenated Shortening. I don't think this should impede on the taste, just the opposite, but it could've been the culprit to this recipe. Otherwise, I'll stick to my old recipe.

I used this crust recipe with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie.  It was fantastic!  I used butter-flavored shortening as other reviewers suggested, and it was PERFECT.

Tried this crust for Thanksgiving pies. This dough is really hard to work with. I followed the instructions exactly and it kept breaking apart when I was rolling it out. Not just cracking in the corners but actually broke a part really early in the process of rolling the dough out. I tried tips in the all recipes pie crust troubleshooting guide, but nothing really worked. Next year, I'm going to try another recipe. Tomorrow (thanksgiving day) this recipe will have to do though.

Only subbed out the shortening for butter.  Used the recipe as directed otherwise.  I did find that I needed more water, but that amount can vary anyway in a pie crust recipe depending upon the kind of flour used.  Love it.  Perfect.  My first time making a crust with an egg.  I will do it this way from now on.

I have been looking for a flaky crust recipe and this one definitely fits the bill!  OMG!  It was perfect!  Not a huge fan of Crisco so the only change I may try next time is using butter in place of Crisco.  Hopefully it will remain just as flaky.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was so amazing! I completely suck at crusts and this worked out... a little hard to handle since its softer than a traditional crust but I think you can remedy that with popping it into the freezer as you go. AWESOME for everything!

I've tried many pie crust recipe before and always hunted for the perfect one. I'm glad I tried this one. Its just what I was looking for. A balance of sweet and salt. Flaky enough but not to the point of crumbling when sliced. As most reviewers pointed out. its actually good for 3 single pie crust and not 4. Unless you use it for those lattice top pies, the this recipe would suffice for 2 pies. I would be using this recipe for all my pies from now on!

This crust is excellent, although I felt that 2 tsp. of salt was too much. Next time, I'll try 1/2 the amount of recommended salt instead. Thanks for posting!

This is a great, fool proof recipe. I especially liked not having to use ice water. It came out sturdy and flaky. I use a pie crust rolling bag and found that there was plenty enough for 4 crusts. Crust should be thin. If you are only making three out of this, you are using too much per crust. Divide your crust into 4 equal balls and use a rolling bag or plastic wrap to roll it out thin and you will like the results better.

This crust is amazing! I loved it! I brushed the bottom crust with egg and baked it for 15 minutes before assembling the pie, which worked and kept the crust from getting soggy, but the crust shrank a little bit during this process, so next time I will roll it out bigger. The crust also seemed to expand a little when baking (probably because it is so flaky), so don't be afraid to roll it thin. I rolled it 2 inches wider than my pie pan, on top of wax paper, and then flipped the paper on top of the pie pan to transfer. Awesome recipe!

Wow. This is by far the best pie crust I have ever tasted.. EVER. 
I just pulled it out of the oven not even 20 minutes ago and my wife and I both loved it with the pumpkin pie. AS a matter of fact, she commented on how good the crust was before noticing the pie filling.
I am using only this recipe for now on. I knew it was going to be good, but not heavenly good. It is perfect, flaky, tasty crust. Thank you so much for sharing this. Gods bless you.

This was an excellent recipe for a traditional pie crust, sweet and light. I've used it for apple and pumpkin pies so far, and will use it for my next pies. I didn't make any changes and definitely recommend. Thank you, Ruth's Grandma!

This worked great, the crust was beautiful and tasted yummy. I made a lattice top with it and by splitting it nice and even I had JUST enough for two 2 crust (top and bottom) pies..but if it was anything besides lattice, not enough dough. Plan accordingly, good recipe though and I changed nothing.

The only substitutions I made were 2 extra spoons of sugar, instead of just sugar I used my own cinnamon-sugar mix and I cut the shortening with half butter. Normally I don't like thick crust but this was perfect for a double crusted peach pie. My hubby loves crust so I also use this recipe for crust cut out cookies. For that I just sprinkle a little extra cinnamon and sugar on each cookie.

I loved the texture and flavor of this crust and how simple it was to put it together and how well it stayed together, unlike most lighter crusts. 

Rather than use the full, I put 16 servings to half this recipe. I had to use half an egg, but it was worth it. Next time, I'll do the full amount and make 2-4 pies at a time. 

However, I did not use shortening. I used Earth Balance, which gave the crust a wonderful light, flaky, soft but strong texture. It held up to the juices of a fresh blueberry pie (very juicy) but was not hard in spots like most crusts when then get wet (and turn into concrete). 

I will use this crust again and again. I think it will do well as a pumpkin pie crust. 

Finally, I also used a "crust dust" of cinnamon-sugar before I added the berry mixture. It gave the crust an almost Snickerdoodle cookie texture and flavor underneath the fruit layer, which gave this crust a nuanced, gourmet texture and aroma. Very good!

I think this would taste really well with apples, pears, and maybe even a rhubarb-strawberry pie.

By far the best crust I've made. I've been looking for the perfect crust for years; this one is going in my collection. I did use a heavy metal pie pan instead of glass. That may have made a difference. Thanks Ruth's Grandma.

It was hard to roll out and work with. I just could not get it thin enough without it falling apart. It makes enough for three crusts.

I tried it again, thinking I did not measure right, maybe. It was really hard to work with, stuck to everything even with lots of flour. It just does not have the consistency to get from the counter rolled out to the pie plate without falling into 5-10 pieces. 

But I love the taste! (My husband says it tastes like cake!)

Very large recipe! Provided an amazingly thick crust. Also a while back I heard a rumor that if you substitute the water with vodka it makes the crust extra flakey. I substituted all the water with vodka and it was super flakey with no taste change. My mum loves eating the dough raw so she snuck some of this raw dough from me and she loved it. Said it was the best crust she ever had! Vodka and all!

I used this recipe to make my very first pie (chicken pot pie) and was amazed at how easy it was to make. I shamefully admit that while the innards didn't taste very good, I would actually pick off pieces of the crust and eat them. Thank you, Ruth's Grandma and Barbara for passing on this wonderful recipe! It has become my new go-to pie crust!

Wonderful! I was nervous about making this as I am a new baker but I couldn't believe how easy it was! I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour before use and rolled it out between 2 pieces of parchment pap. I traced the top of pie plate on the top piece of paper as a guide to see how far to roll which I found very helpful. I was able to get 3 crusts.. My new go to crust! Perfect with Grandma Ople's Apple pie!

This is a great basic pie crust recipe for using shortening! I cut it down to 28 servings and still had way too much, but I'll use the leftovers for poptarts :). I think next time I might put butter in it, but that's just personal preference..

This is an excellent crust. It is easy to work with and turned out very flaky and flavorful. My husband and I both loved it. Used it for the Old Fashioned Strawberry Pie from this site. Will use again.

This recipe is awesome! I have never made my own pie crust and I was so nervous to do so, but this turned out perfect! I cut this recipe in half because I only needed 2 crusts for what I was making. I used this recipe for making a chicken pot. A recipe I found on here as well. The crust came out delicious and flaky. It wasn't hard to work with at all. I was worried that there wasn't going to be enough for my 9.5" pie dish, but it worked. Thanks for this recipe! I will always use this when making my own pies!

This is amazing.  I've used it a couple times; once mixing it to a cookie dough consistency, added the egg and water, turned it into a soupy mess, added some more flour mixing by hand.  The end result was still flaky pie crust.

I am no baker by any means but decided to try this and surprise my wife of 30 years who is an accomplished baker. I used the crust I made for a chicken pot pie and son....not going to say it was the best there ever was, but I have not had any better. Great crust!

I would agree with another reviewer that there is not quite enough for two full crusts. Or maybe I could have rolled it thinner if I had known what I was doing:-)

Sensational! Never used egg in crust before and this is now my all-time favorite recipe and will use it in the future! Was a little curious how it was going to work using a measured amount of water where as most other recipes have you add a little at a time until the consistency is right. To my surprise, this worked out perfectly with the right amount of moisture. Thank You!!

This recipe has convinced me to try pie making again!  I have always had trouble with crust.  I had a good recipe, but the dough was so hard to work that I gave up on pies.   My husband volunteered me to make a pie for someone this weekend, so I had to deliver.  I tried this recipe because of the reviews, and I am *so glad* I did!  It was easy to make with ingredients I had on hand, and the dough was a breeze to work with.  I was afraid it wouldn't turn out because it was so much easier than I have come to expect when making crust.   I was rewarded with perfect, flaky crust.  I made it exactly as written, but next time I think I will try the butter flavored shortening to take it to the next level.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This crust is amazing! I have made it several times and people always compliment it and ask me for the recipe. I follow the directions exactly and it has come out so delicious every time. FYI, It is sweet, almost like a cookie, so don't use it for savory pies. I made that mistake on a pot pie once and it didn't taste so great...

This is the BEST pie crust recipe I have ever used!!  My husband, who is a chef, LOVES this crust and even admitted it is probably better than the recipe he has used for years!!

I used one of the techniques mentioned in the comments suggesting to roll out the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and this worked wonderfully.  To get the dough into the pan/on top of your pie I rolled out the dough, removed the top piece of plastic wrap and picked up the bottom piece to transfer the crust to the pan instead of trying to roll up the crust and move it - this worked great.  Also I brushed the top of the crust with a little egg wash before baking.

Best Ever!  I won't even look for another recipe to try.  This is the pie crust recipe that I will always use. Easy to work with and bakes beautifully.

This was my first pie crust, too. I'm currently expecting and was really hankering for some pear and apple pie but I'd used my last store-bought crust on quiche last week. So I gave this a go. Unfortunately, the shortening I thought I had wasn't in the cupboard so I used 1 1/4 c of butter instead as another reviewer was short on shortening(lol) and used butter to make up the difference. I have to say that so far, so good! It does only seem to make 3 crusts, rather than the 4 mentioned in the recipe but I love crumble toppings so no worries there. Pie is baking now so I can't vouch for the taste yet, but I had no trouble with the texture (too wet, too dry) when rolling out. I even made a lattice/woven top for my pie since rolling the bottom was so easy. It looks amazing I can only imagine it'll taste great, too!

I used this recipe in making Blueberry Pie I, and it was delicious. I mixed the egg with only 1/4 cup water (suggested by another reviewer) and it made the dough plenty moist. I used some leftover for a beef pot pie. The flakiness was great but it was probably a bit sweet for a meat pie.

As tasty and easy as all the positive reviews say.  Its very crumbly and I find I have to refrigerate it before I can even roll it out to use it but that makes it all the tastier.
As always with pie crusts I roll them out between two sheets of wax paper, makes it so much easier....

I used White Lilly flour, 1 cup Crisco (in stick form), and 3/4 cup salted butter. First time I make a recipe I try very hard to stick to the original with no deviations. Unfortunately, we were snowed in and I only had 1 cup of Crisco- forced to substitute. Without a doubt, best crust I've ever made! The dough was very soft and delicate during the roll out. Not sure if this was because I was using a soft wheat flour but I wasn't complaining- presumed if dough was delicate it wouldn't be tough. Today, I made the recipe in the food processor. Thinking it was a mistake, dough was wet (had to add more flour after it came out of processor). It's chilling in refrig now, guess we'll see soon.

This is the flakiest crust I've ever tasted!  Easy to make and a cinch to work with.  I miss the buttery flavor though so I plan to use butter flavored shortening next time - or I may add butter in place of some of the shortening.

This Crust was fantastic!! I have never ever made pie crust on my own before. Sad I know... I am 42, but I always made it with my Nana. When she passed, well she took her recipe with her as well as my passion for making pies. Well this year I decided to give it a try! And this recipe came darn close!! I just made a few change's to make it closer to my Nana's recipe. Instead of all shortening I used 1 Cup of butter and 3/4 cups of shortening. It turned out flakey and wonderful! No burning, or too much browning around the edges. Also very flavorful! Thanks for sharing! I will add pictures the next batch of pies - for New Year's!

Thanks to Ruth's Grandma, I won't buy another pie crust. Pie crusts scared me--they always seemed so difficult to make and I've failed a few times. Not only is this recipe simple, but it makes a darn good crust. 

A tip from my expert-baker mother-in-law: use very cold water (ice water) and don't handle the crust too much. That makes for a very flaky crust. 

This is a keeper. No more lousy processed pie crusts for me!

This is the BEST pie crust recipe I have ever made, and honey, I've made a few. I made a pumpkin pie on a Wednesday evening, refrigerated it overnight, served it cold the next day & the crust was light & flaky. We just finished it off tonight, 3 days later and this crust was STILL light & flaky! LOVE IT!!! It is my "new" pie crust recipe!

This recipe was easy to make.  The crust had a good flavor and texture and everyone who ate it really liked it.  However, it was difficult to work with because the ingredients did not yield four pie crusts (as stated by a previous reviewer).  When I separated the dough into four equal pieces and tried to roll it out, it was almost impossible to get the crust large enough to fit in the pie dish.  I had to roll it so thin that it started to dry out and split.  I managed, but if you're just beginning your pie-making adventure, you may find it frustrating.  I'll use the recipe again, but I'll remember the amount of dough will make three pie crusts generously.

I didn't have good luck with this recipe at all.  After cutting the cold butter into the flour I added the ice water/egg mixture and stirred it up.  It was still almost as crumbly as it was before I added the liquid.  So I stirred in another 1/4 cp of ice water and the dough was still pretty crumbly. I added another 1/4 cp of ice water and finally it was the right consistency. It rolled out well and didn't stick to the counter as I picked it up.  It turned out tough tho from all the extra stirring as I added the extra water. From all the 5 star reviews I thought this would be easy peasy but it wasn't at all - at least not for me.

I can't believe how soft and flaky this crust was. I split in in 2, refrigerated them wrapped in over sized Saran Wrap,  and rolled it in the wrap. Makes transferring to the pie dish easy. Loved it!,

This is my first time making this recipe, the ONLY reason I am giving it 5 stars is because I read the reviews prior to making. This recipe ONLY makes enough for 3 crusts, NOT 4 like it says. I am glad I am only making 2 pies (needed the 3rd crust for lattice) and not 4 because I would have been severely disappointed.

Perfect crust! Easy to roll out and has a great flavor! I quartered the recipe because I only needed to make one pie, and it still worked out great! I used my left over crust after trimming it to make stuffed mini "pies."

I am terrible at making pie crust, my Achilles heel in the kitchen and I avoid pie making if I can. I gave it one more shot with this recipe yesterday and happy to say I'm a convert! We made 5 crusts with one batch for aluminum 9" pie plates but a deep dish glass yielded only 3. Couldn't ask for a better pre baked crust with Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie from this site! Thank you for a great recipe!

Thank you Lord for this recipe!!!!  I bake a lot & had trouble w/ an 'old' recipe turning out hard.  I tried this recipe ONLY changing it from 1 3/4 cup shortening to 1 cup shortening & 3/4 cup cold butter. I left out the salt because I learned if you're using salted butter you don't need the salt in the recipe.  It doesn't make 4 crusts, only 3 but, WOW THIS IS JUST LIKE MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MADE!!!!  Easy to roll and tender yet flaky and crumbly.  PERFECT!!!! I already saved this to my favorite recipes and will be using it from now on.  Gramma's had all the good recipes.  This is a MUST for all.

I've been baking pies for years but decided to see what the top rated pie crust is on all-recipes.  This pie crust is awesome!  I love how easy it is to use (although my first attempt was rough because I didn't mix it enough).  It is great with non sweet pies too.  I tested it with a chocolate pie and meat pie. My husband said even though he knew it had sugar and it seemed sweet with the chocolate pie, you couldn't even tell with the meat pie.  I'll be using it for all my pies from now on.

I made my first pie (of all time) last year using this crust and 'Apple Pie by Grandma Ople' from allrecipes. It was the best pie & crust I've ever eaten in my life. I also used butter flavored Crisco instead of regular shortening. :)

Wow! What a fabulous pie crust! I have a confession to make... I only had 1 cup of Crisco, so ended up using a stick of butter for the remaining 3/4 cup of shortening. Um... it was really good!

The crust was fine and everything but the yield was way off. It does NOT make 4 pie crusts easily. It makes three. I stretched it to make four and the results were not great. When I re-did this recipe again, I used the recipe for 3 crusts instead and it turned out perfectly.

This was my first pie crust and I was very surprised by the results! It tasted great and was so easy to work with! I made a blueberry by with a lattice crust with this recipe and turned out great! I spread a little butter on the bottom crust and a few small chunks of butter on the top crust. I'd say there was just enough left over to do one more double crust 9 inch pie.

This is an easy, great pie crust. If you do the lattice top it is just enough for 2 pies. Made this with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie & it was delicious!! Family loved it so much that I made another a few days later!

Wow, I have made many pie crusts but this by far is my favorite. It is so flaky and mixes up so easy. I think the egg and the sugar makes all the difference. This will be my go to from now on

Good crust.  I will use this again for sure.  I didn't change a thing.  I divided this into thirds and froze the other two for another day.  My husband said it was really good crust (better than his Mom's) so it's a winner!

I just made this pie dough, my first time ever making a pie for my hubby's birthday, he doesn't like cake! I was nervous because all the family came over to celebrate and of course I had to try a new recipe, so I needed it to come out right. It was so easy and it came out delicious. I was so glad I made the dough instead if buying it as the pumpkin recipe called for. The dough made the pie that much better. No fail recipe! Everyone loved it!!!

Very easy to roll out without problems. First pie crust recipe I ever used and it was great. For the top crust I cut out shapes with a cookie cutter and layered them on. :}

LOVE this crust.  I use butter flavored shortening to make it extra evil.  I'm a Navy wife, and this is my go-to recipe for scoring points with large numbers of Sailors at holiday parties and cookouts.

I made this last night for a peach pie for a Labor Day  cookout at a dear friend's house. I made the filling recipe from Smitten Kitchen. It was a beautiful pie!  My husband, who really cares how food looks, said so!  Everyone had wonderful things to say about it.  This crust took a little more time than my usual pie crust recipe but it was worth the compliments!  I will definitely do this again.  I love to take something to a potluck or cookout that stands out.

This recipe is awesome. Only thing I do different when making this recipe it I forget about the bowl only because I learned that when making pie crust, using bowls is just dirty a useless item (less dishes to wash) I also increase the sugar slightly only because I like my pie crust to be on the sweeter.

Great recipe.  I could have made 4 pie crusts with the dough depending on the size of the pie plate I used.  Not all pie plates are the same size.  I used lard, the sound of it doesn't gross me out,  it made it delicious.  Thank you for the recipe and for the video with instructions.  You couldn't have made it any easier.

I love this recipe. I have never made a pie crust before so I was nervous about it but this is so easy to follow & the pie was delicious. I used cold butter instead of shortening & scaled the recipe down for one single pie crust instead of having several crusts at once since I was making only one pie with a single crust. I made a strawberry meringue pie & it was fabulous. Pre-baking the crust by itself is a must. This is absolutely a keeper.

The flavor was good, and the recipe made plenty, but this was possibly the most difficult crust to handle that I've ever dealt with. It was so moist that I couldn't lift or roll it over the rolling pin to move it. Even adding a good bit of flour didn't help. It would be great for a recipe where you press the dough into a pan or make a free form tart or something, but for pie, it was unmanageable.

Great pie crust! And, so easy. I made them ahead and froze them. They make 3 crusts (so, 1 double crust pie and 1 single crust pie). I made a pear pie with the single crust, and it came out perfectly. I made a steak n ale pie with the double and YUM.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make and easy to work with. I do agree with other reviewers who said it was more like 3 crusts, not 4. I took that suggestion and just cut it into 3 when I made the crust and it worked out perfectly. The crust is very flaky, just how I like. My husband and MIL agreed. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was easy BUT no one told me that it shrank a whole lot, I was shocked but now I know to make the sides really really high, it shrank down half way down my pan.

My first time making pie crust.  Should have read all the reviews first though.  Didn't use ice water and may have handled the dough too much at first.  But even so, the pie only lasted 2 days.  In my house pie usually lasts a week!

This is my first pie crust, so I don't really have much to compare it to. I liked the flavor a lot - I used butter flavored shortening, like others; I did feel like it was a little greasy, but that might have been mental, because I find shortening a little creepy. (I used it here anyway because I've heard it makes the best pie crusts.) I'm not a great pie-roller-out-er, to say the least, and so I only got two (thick) single crusts from this. It crumbled quite a bit as I was trying to crimp the edges but, again, that might have been me. Anyway, I did love the flavor, and will keep this recipe in mind, but will also keep looking.

Was so scared to make my own pie crust but this recipe was so simple and yet the most delicious pie crust ever!  First batch I doubled to have some in the freezer.  Not necessary as it is so easy to make!!

Thank you Barbara for posting this recipe. This is the best pie crust I have ever made. The dough was very easy to work with, and the taste is fabulous. This is the only crust I will ever make from no on, its a keeper.

I occasionally add cinnamon and vanilla, but a great basic crust. We use it all the time for chicken pot pie.

Simple and tasty! My Husband says it's the best crust he's had and helps me brag it up!! I don't care for flakey crust so I substituted the shortening for butter and it was great! I tend to not like pie crust but I couldn't get enough of it. Was only making one pie so as per other reviewers, I halved the recipe. Next time I won't do a lattice top cause I want to taste more crust!!

Love this crust!  Some people don't like the fact that it makes so much, but I covered the remaining crust up and stuck it in the freezer.  I love having extra crust on hand!

This crust was ok, wasn't the one I was looking for though. Easy to make, however, I would use water sparingly. Only use a little at a time, otherwise you end up with a goopy mess.

Excellent recipe!! I used this recipe when making a rustic style berry pie. I wanted a substainial crust so I made it thicker than a standard pie crust and it turned out perfectly. Family commented on how light the crust tasted. A no fuss five star recipe. Will continue using this one.

This is the first pie crust recipe that I made.  I was very worried that it wouldn't turn out (I've heard pie crust horror stories)  It came out perfect.  I couldn't have had better luck!  I haven't tried it with many pies yet but I've made several pumpkin pies with it and it turns out excellent!  I read tips on how to avoid pie crust catastrophes and so far, it's worked like a charm.  I don't think I will need to search for another crust, this is terrific!

Absolutely flawless. Perfect. Flavorful. Right amount of sweet. Superb consistency, not too flakey, not too doughy.   In the future, I will use no other recipe for a pie crust.

My husband adored this pie crust. He's a commercial baker so thinks he knows it all, but he said this was the best pie crust he's ever had even though I rolled it too thick.  (It was my first attempt at a scratch crust) I had no problem making two bottoms and two lattices and if I had rolled thinner could have probably managed a third bottom.

I used butter flavored shortening and got amazing results!  However, I did have a hard time keeping it together.  I only used a 1/4 cup of water as someone reccomended so that could have been the problem.  It tasted so good I didn't care!

Super easy pie crust that doesn't call for a lot of fuss (i.e. when you have 3 kids three and under who want to help bake a pie, you don't have time to let the dough chill for hours - this recipe eliminated that step altogether!) and although my blueberry pie was itself quite good, I got the most compliments on how tasty and perfect the crust turned out :)

This is definitely the best pie crust recipe! I modified it to my liking by using 1 c. butter flavored crisco and 3/4 c. unsalted butter. I love the butter flavor and the texture of the shortening crusts and this makes the perfect combination.

This was such a good pie crust. I have tried so many recipes that are bland or just don't come together for me (always have to add more water than the recipe calls for which ruins the flakiness). This was easy to make, if not a little harder to roll out because it's so flaky, but totally worth it. So yummy!

The first time I tried this recipe I made it with a lemon meringue pie and I have to say that with such a strong flavor like lemon the crust was overshadowed by the filling (in fact, at the time I left a 4-star review here).  After making this crust again but with apple pie it REALLY shined and was worth every single star in the 5-star rating!  I even won over my mom, who has been the official pie maker in our family for decades!  Don't hesitate to try this recipe.  Also, I think the egg helps the dough be more flexible and "workable" as it is easy to roll out and transfer to the pie dish.

The amount of dough this recipe yielded was odd, but the outcome was awesome!  I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because the flaky and slighty sweet dough was exactly what I was looking for! THANKS!!

Excellent crust!! I used this for the "Chicken Pot Pie IX" recipe from this site and it was very tasty!! I'm not a huge fan of using alot of shortening, so I substituted 1-1/4 cup butter & 1/2 cup of shortening to replace the 1-3/4 cups of shortening. The dough was very easy to use - thanks so much!!

This was my first attempt at making a pie and it turned out really well. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it made 1, 2-crust apple pie. Delicious, I plan to use it for peach next.

I use this recipe for all of my basic pies. I do use cold butter, which I cut into the flour instead of shortening. Makes a lot, but you can always freeze the extra to use later!!

Delicate, slightly crumbly texture as opposed to flaky... it was a great crust and I'd definitely use it again!!  I used butter flavored shortening for a little more flavor.

ok, I still cannot roll out dough for pies, but this pie crust at least can be put together.  The taste is fabulous!  I have used 3 times now and the taste is great.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe box

Very good crust, I cut the recipe in half because I was making sweet potato pie and did not need top crust. Worked out wonderfully. I will use this again.

Perfect crust.  Super easy to work.  Even though I did not have a cutter or fancy mixer it came out perfect.  I just pinched small pieces of butter crisco and cut it in with a fork and rolled it between two sheets or parchment paper after I let it set/chill in the fridge for an hour.  If you are afraid of making a crust from scatch, don't be as this is truly a no-fail recipe.  Very light and delicate.

The crust had a great flavor, but I found it difficult to work with - a bit too wet.  Next time I'll cut back on the shortening as I found it too greasy.  It was definitely flakey - almost crumbly.  It would help to refrigerate this crust for at least an hour before rolling it out.  I left out the sugar as I used this crust for a Chicken pot pie.  My family loved the taste, but the texture was off just a bit.. too much shortening I'm sure.

This was my first effort at pie crust, and it was tasty; however, when I rolled it out, it kept breaking apart. It was very frustrating and I ended up piecing it together when pressing it into the pie plate. I'm not sure what I did wrong.

I'll never buy another pre-made crust from the store again...  such ease to prepare this and I like that it makes enough to have extra dough for cut-out crust decorations.   I will try it with the butter-flavor shortening next time.

Yep, this one is great!!!!  My previous pastry recipe is now retired after trying this one.   I love that this makes either a double plus a single crust or 3 single crusts.  Makes it MUCH easier for all the baking that I do.  Make sure you chill your bowl (stainless works best) and pastry cutter bofore making the recipe.  15 minutes inthe freezer will do.

Okay so I got a little carried away, after trying this pie crust and getting rave reviews I have 4 pie crusts made and ready in the fridge!  I've even taught my grandson who is staying with me, telling him he will be 'an absolute hit with the girls'.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it is so very kind of you to have shared, did Grandma have any other favourite recipes?

good recipe, easy to make and roll out. I tried to make it healthier by using half whole wheat and white flour.  It didn't go over well with my traditional husband. The rest of us liked enough for seconds but there was a difference.  Can't wait to use this again with strictly white flour.

OK, so my husband insists that his apple pie is "rectangle" (so there are corners with extra crust. I have had a problem making enough to do a top and a bottom. This one was perfect and it was yummy. I did have leftovers, but I made little cookies like my mom did when she had leftovers.....you roll it out, brush with butter, top with lots of cinnamon and sugar, roll it up, slice, and bake until flaky....SOOOOOO GOOD

OMG! This pastry is to die for.  It is so tasty and flaky that my husband was swooning. I used this recipe to make English Butter Tarts (another recipe from this site).  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of substituting Splenda for the sugar.  I used butter flavoured Crisco and I put the water in the freezer to ensure it was "ice cold".  I made half the recipe and got enough dough for 12 butter tarts.  I put it in the fridge to keep cool whilst I made the butter tart filling.  Thanks so much to Barbara Castodio for sharing this phenomenal recipe with us.  My pastry making is a family joke because I murder pastry; it usually ends up to be one big grey ball of stuff that is either tougher than nails or is like a jig saw puzzle trying to put pieces together to make one usable piece.  But now I can make pastry .... who'd a thunk it?  LOL  This recipe is a keeper and is one I will pass along to my daughters & my son.

I've never been brave enough to make my own pie crust... now I will just make Ruth's Grandma's Crust whenever I need one. I did follow another's suggestion and used 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 regular.  YUM!   This could be a dessert in itself!

I let a friend borrow my cookbook and needed my favorite pie crust recipe.  I found this one and now I have a NEW favorite!  This is the easiest crust to work with I've ever made.    Unlike another reviewer, I easily rolled enough crust for two double crust deep dish pies.    I've made it twice now.  I made one pie, stored the extra dough wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge for a few days, then made another pie.  Once the dough warmed to room temperature, it was just as easy to work with as the freshly made!  This morning, I made an apple pie and now I've got more dough in the fridge for next time.  This is a great recipe!

OMG.  This was so easy and absolutely the best crust I have ever eaten.  It was light & flaky and just perfect.  I was able to make 2 crusts with a lattice crust on top with this recipe.  I cannot wait to make this again.

Nice! This one is going in my online recipe box for future pies.  The last few recipes my wife and I followed for pie crusts were hit or miss. We had lost confidence in making our own, and started using the ready-made crusts for the last couple pies.  I really wanted to go from scratch this time because I picked wild blueberries, and this ended up being the perfect choice.  I hate dry crust, and this crust was wonderfully flaky, followed down to the last detail.

I have been trying a lot of different pie crust recipes, trying to find the best tasting recipe out there.  This recipe was delicious.  I used the suggestions of others and used butter flavored shorting and plain shorting combined.  I would suggest chilling the dough well before trying to roll it out.  I was so anxious to try this dough, after I read all the great comments, that I skipped this step.  I had plenty of dough left over to freeze for another single crust pie.  Delicious!

I've been experimenting with pie crust recipes for years...this is great! As other reviewers note, it makes a LOT of dough.   As my own grandma did, I just roll up the extra dough with left over fruit or some jelly for a quick jelly roll.  I also let the kids help with this part and they love it.

i never knew that pie crust could be excitingly delicious until i made this one.   when i made it, i left the dough in the refrigerator for a few hours (more out of convenience than for any real intentional purpose) and i think that may have helped to make it nice and flaky.

So good and so easy! I multiplied all the ingredients by .75, and I found that this made the perfect amount for a base and lattice top (with a little extra to spare). If you don't have a pastry cutter, a whisk works pretty well.

This is Excellent! You must try it if you want to have a flaky homemade pie crust!I use butter in place of shortening as I couldn't find buttered flavor shortening in HK. I used less water (only about 1/4 cup) and it's already enough. I think humidity plays a role in the amount of water you need.

I substituted Whole Wheat Pastery Flour for the All-Purpose Flour.  I also used Butter Flavored Crisco.  My pie crust turned out great!  It was easy to roll out and transfer to my pie dish. It was light, flaky, & crumbled in my mouth!

This was only the second time I've attempted to make my own pie crust. The first time was pretty much a disaster.  When I went to the grocery store for the ingredients for this crust, I also picked up a refrigerated crust. I had low expectations.  I used butter flavored Crisco that I refrigerated. After refrigerating my dough for 1/2 hour, I rolled it out between wax paper.  OMG! It worked! I did it! I made a pie crust! And it was tender and flaky! My husband said it was the best crust he'd ever eaten.  Seriously, if I can make this crust, anyone can!

I was looking for a good crust recipe to make my first-ever pie a success (I used this with the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople recipe from this site).  This recipe did the trick.  I used butter instead of shortening and egg whites instead of the white and yolk (I buy eggs that are in the milk carton-like container and my whole eggs were unfortunately expired, forcing me to use my egg whites).  This recipe is supposed to make four crusts, but I have no idea how that could be.  I had enough dough for two approximately 9” pie crusts, but I don’t know how that could be stretched to four!  Great recipe though!

This crust was super easy to roll outand it turned out very flaky!! my only complaint is that it was a tiny bit too salty. I would decrease the amount of salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons. other than that, it is fantastic!

I really liked this crust!  I even used half whole wheat flour and it came out quite tasty!  I used half for chicken pot pie (I added a little something to make it less sweet) and half for apple pie (made as is).  Both were great and I will use this recipe again! My only complaint is that this is the first time I've made regular pie crust and the instructions should include that chilling is a must and keeping things cold is best for rolling.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This crust was great. I made it for the top rated apple pie recipe on this site and I must say that this crust really made the pie. The pie was finished between 5 people in a matter of 3 hours because they loved it so much - each one complimented the crust over and over. I will continue to use this recipe!

This was really good.  My first time making crust and it was very easy.  I used a potato masher to cut it the dough because I don't own a pastry blender and it worked great.  The dough made 4 crusts and was very flaky and savory.  I used it to make a chicken pot pie and I am not usually a crust person but I really liked eating this one.  When I made the pot pie I baked the bottom shell for 10 min in the oven first before placing the filling.  Hubby loved this too.  Thanks!

Nice Flaky crust.  Easy on hand ingredients.  
I halved the recipe and it was plenty for  a double crust for a 9 inch deep dish apple pie.  Also, only had it in the fridge for about a half hour before i needed to use it, and it rolled out just fine and it turned out great!

I never  have good luck with pie crusts.  They never turn out, but this one did.  It was so easy to work with. I was able to roll the dough out with no problems.  It taste great.

Wow!  This recipe is GREAT!  It tastes awesome and is so easy to work with (I chill mine for at least 30 min before rolling).  I would not be able to get 4 crusts out of this recipe though, I like to make deep dish pies with a thick crust so I use this recipe for 2 shells.  Every pie baker should try this recipe!

I have only been making pies for a short while now, but this was by far the best pie crust that I have ever tasted in my life, not to mention that I have ever made. No other recipe I have tried comes close to this.  I did substitute 3/4's of a cup of shortening, for 3/4's of a cup of butter, for taste. But leaving a cup of shortening for flakiness.

This was pretty good pie crust but I barely worked with it and it just wasn't flaky at all. It was more like a cookie.

This recipe is great.  I subbed in butter 50% and shortening 50%. It gave the crust a great flavor.

It was great with Apple Pie by Grandma Ople (on this site)!

It really only makes 1 pie top and bottom, plus another bottom.

It freezes great!

I've made this pie crust several times and it always turns out good. I've even substituted half butter, half shortening OR even all butter and it turned out good.

First time I've used pie dough recipe that called for an egg.  Worked just like an egg bath.  This was the flakiest crust i've ever made and My Grandmother who is 90 and makes her own great stuff really loved it.

I thought this was a good recipe for pie crust. It came out nicely and tasted fine, but I'm not sure this is the easiest dough to work with: it kept breaking and tearing regardless how much flour I put down first. Listening to others' suggestions, I kept the dough and materials cold every step of the way. For me, this recipe made two bottom crusts and one one top.

WOW!!!! Flaky, delicious and FLAVORFUL! One thing that I normally do not like about any pie is that the crust is flavorless and dense. This crust not only has flavor, but its nice and flaky. I added a bit of vanilla as well as allspice when mixed it all. I used the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople apple pie recipe, and since this dough made so much extra I created a couple apple turnovers with the remaining doah and pie mixture and glazed them with butter and sugar then baked. SO good!

This was a WINNER!!  I got so many compliments on this crust (even my baker mother inlaw loved it and wants the recipe).  It did make more than I needed for a double crust pie.  I agree with amother reveiwer who said it makes enough for a double crust and almost a single crust.

Amazing! All of gthe pies came out wonderful and the crust was nice and flaky. I did make one minor change. All of my appliance were ice cold. So was the shortening, water and sifted flour. I made it exactly as the recipe stated then I did it with all of the cold items, the second crust came out with a bit better flakyness, color, and the cold brought out the sweetness in the crust a bit better. A++ Will use for ALL of my holiday cooking

Used butter flavored crisco and it had a great buttery flavor.  Makes enough for two nice thick pie crusts.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this crust with the "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople" recipe from this website. It turned out really well. I used butter flavored shortening like someone suggested, and it turned out crunchy and flaky. I was really surprised as a first time pie maker!

Great recipe. A bit soft when trying to braid for a decorative pie crust, but cooked very nicely.

This is a great pie crust.  I have no complaints. I made it with a chicken pot pie and it was delicious.  Great as written. Thanks!

Oh my goodness this is by far the best pie crust recipe that I have gotten from this site.  Even followed the recipe almost exactly which is unusual for me and it was incredible.  I did add a bit more sugar because I was making it for a Blackberry Pie and the berries were a bit bitter.  Also sprinkled sugar on the crust before baking.  Used this for Bridid's Blackberry Pie from this site and it was just awesome.  This is a keeper for sure.  Will just use less sugar for meat pies on this one...

Great pie crust! Very easy to make. I made the "fresh rhubarb pie (allrecipes)" with it and it was a hit! I had never made a pie before and found this recipe to be very easy to handle. I'll be using this one again!

I used this crust for my first ever attempt at making a pie!  It turned out great!  Great texture, taste, everything!  I used it with the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople recipe and couldn't be happier with the results.  yummmmmm!

I've never made home-made, from scratch pie crust and I have to say, as that it was easy and tasty!

I agree with others though - it really makes enough for 1.5 pies but I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the extra, baked it and my family ate it up.

perfect.  I halved it and still had some left over so I put the extra in to muffin cups to make mini pies.  I like how there was actually extra dough.  Most recipes I try I am trying to stretch it to try to cover the whole pie pan.  Thanks for the yummy pie crust recipe!

I just spent four hours working with this crust and baking 3 pies with it...I am VERY disappointed in how the dough held up.

I first tried it pulsing the ingredients in my food processor...the dough was way too sticky, even with rolling it between wax paper.  I couldn't get it OFF of the wax paper to get into the pie plate.

Then I did the "original" way by hand...the dough consistency was exactly the same.  This time, I floured the dough and wax paper, and managed to get it into the pie plates with a minimum of difficulty.  So, I reasoned that the food processor was perhaps part of the problem originally.

WRONG...unfortunately, the crust literally MELTED off the edge of the pie plate within the first 10 minutes of baking, spilling my pumpkin pie all over my oven.  Then the pie wouldn't get done, thus leading me to burn the darn crust.

Workability: 1 star
Taste (I ate some raw while contemplating what to do before Round 2): 5 stars

Guess I'm not meant to use this crust recipe, sorry.  We'll see how the crust holds up to the mince pie that I made (it's still in the oven).

i had high hopes for this recipe what with all the wonderful reviews. sadly, this just did not work out for me. it was very dense and slid to the bottom of the pan, and although i did not add extra liquid, it was still way to gooey. maybe, it was just my poor fortune this time around, but i still doubt i'd use this recipe again.

I have tried many crust recipes and this is by far my most favorite!  

I had a very easy time rolling out the dough--no cracking, crumbling, etc.  To get it in the pie pan I just rolled the dough up and then unrolled it into the pie pan.  I had enough dough to very comfortably make 2 crusts with this recipe.

Very flaky and tasty crust.  It's a keeper for sure!  Would make GREAT pie crust cookies!

This pie crust was perfect. Flaky and alot like Marie Calender's crust that I like so much. I even mixed it up in my Kitchen Aide and it still was good and not tough at all. Yea!!
