Great way to use some of your garden veges. I too started it out on low (after adding the initial 2 c of broth), but bumped the heat up to medium low after ~30min. It does take longer than 20 min for the barley to absorb all the broth. You don't want to rush the barley too much. The consistency, taste, and golden color are great.

Great recipe.  I am always looking for more healthy but equally tasty versions of my family's favorite recipes.  My husband's risotto is hands-down the best I've ever had, but we all came back for seconds on this one, too (even my 16-month-old).  I made it with minor revisions:  (1) I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for sauteing the onion (grabbed it on accident).  (2) I used ~4.5c chicken broth, and probably ~2-3c vegetable broth.  (3) I added ~1 Tbsp of mascarpone cheese along with the knob of butter and parmesan at the end.  (4) I skipped the dried thyme and black pepper, and didn't add salt at all (it didn't need it).  My hubby and 5-year-old skipped the veggies (I kept them on the side), but the littlest one and I gobbled them up.  It took me longer than 20 min to make (more like 1-1.5h).  I started it out on low (after adding the initial 2 c of broth), but bumped the heat up to medium low after ~30min on my husband's suggestion.  It helped.  The barley was perfectly done at the end - slightly chewy, and a lovely caramel color.

Very good!  All of my young kids and husband ate it up.  I did just mince all the veggies, onion, and garlic and sauteed them together in olive oil.

Made the recipe as written. It basically met expectations: tastes like barley with some veggies. It's a good, healthful side dish, which is what I was looking for, but I probably won't make it again. As long as you aren't expecting anything special, you'll be satisfied.

So good. I have never rated a recipe before, but this was so good I had to.  I was afraid I would be the only one at the table to like it. But low and behold my husband, 4 and 1 year old loved it. So much so I made it again later in the week, added extra veggies and made it our main course. I also on accident didn't follow directions to a T the first time I made it and while broth was heating threw all the veggies in together to cook. The next time I was more organized but still threw the veggies together, starting first with the carrots, sweated with a lid on for a few minutes. Oh I also just put all the liquid in at once. I guess I love this recipe because I messed up both times and I was still great.

Not as "easy" as I had hoped bc of prep time and constant attention, but still simple. You definitely dont need to be precise with measurements, and the broth is excessive,

Such a delicious recipe. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and vegetable broth for chicken broth, and it turned out extremely flavorful.

This was a great recipe. I substituted farro and it worked out well. I used three cups of chicken broth all at once. Also, I used one carrot instead of two, one big yellow squash, and one zucchini, and the ratio was perfect. I ate the veggies separately though. Overall, this tasted delicious!

For me this recipe took WAY longer than it said it would. It turned out delicious after it was finally cooked over TWO HOURS LATER. But it was really creamy and flavorful. I’ll be making it again for sure but I just have to plan on the longer cooking time

Definitely will repeat it! Different from your typical risotto, but in a good way. And plenty of room for variation.

Made this with arboro rice instead of barley. It certainly was not bad. I just didn't really care for the zucchini in this recipe. I've already lade risotto with leeks and with spinach, and prefer those 2 recipes over this one. Next I make risotto, I want to try a variant with mushrooms.

I had less barley on hand than I thought and no other grains in the house. I did find a package of ramen, crushed it up & added that to the barley. Since I used less barley, I used less stock. I also added some avocado at the end for creaminess & color.

16 month old and I both really liked it. Hubby hated it and wouldn't eat it. So, I went with 3 stars as the family average. Oh, and I did make two changes: I cooked the veggies in bacon grease instead of oil and used 4 squash instead of a zucchini. And I used the optional butter.

Very yummy, I only used zucchini-approx. 1 cup. I never use pearl barley I only use Hull-less Barley which is a nice whole grain. I let the whole grain barley cook for much longer than pearl barley, so approx. 60 min and the w/out cover for 10 more.
