This was awesome!! Everyone loved it. I used a bit more bacon than called for (it was for a party, darnit! Party calories don't count, right?), and added a quarter of a red onion, finely chopped, and a couple small handfuls of chopped green onion for extra bite and crunch.(Omitted the celery due to personal preference)  Used those tiny red-skinned potatoes, cut in half -- their waxy flesh holds up better to boiling, and the there's less risk of a mushy potato salad. (Plus, no peeling!) Garnishing with the sliced egg didn't work for me, it just didn't look right. So I mixed in all the egg, and just sprinkled parseley and bacon on top, and it looked great. Very easy to omit the bacon for a vegetarian version. 

An easy way to cook the bacon: line a baking sheet with foil, then place bacon strips on the pan. Place pan in a COLD oven, then turn the heat up to 350F. After about 15 minutes (varies dep. on how crispy you like your bacon), you'll get perfect bacon, with minimal mess. It tastes better than microwaved bacon (plus no lingering smells in the microwave), clears up space on the stove top, and you can even stack the bacon in 2-slice layers if you need to make a lot (works best for bacon that will be crumbled, as the slices tend to stick together). Anyway, thanks for the recipe, it was SO good!

Just average as written, but a good start to make it your own.  Novice cooks will appreciate cooking instructions for the eggs and potatoes, although even that is done differently from cook to cook. I didn't care for the idea of mincing the celery or mashing the eggs - it seemed to me this would make it more like potato salad PASTE.   I wanted more texture so I chopped everything, and cut the potatoes into bite-size chunks.  I added  red, orange, yellow and green bell peppers for extra flavor, color and crunch, as well as green onion.   I love the bacon and Dijon mustard, but I don't care for straight mayonnaise in salads like this so I cut it, half and half, with sour cream.  Finally, rather than seasoning with just salt and pepper, I used Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt and lemon pepper. Again, a nice foundation but this recipe really needs some embellishment to personal taste. With my additions and changes I ended up with some great potato salad.

my boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe.  It's a great potato salad, especially if you are looking for something a bit different with a little pizzaz.  The bacon and dijon mustard really make a world of difference!

This is our new favorite potato salad recipe.  We added a bit more bacon as 4 slices did not seem to be enough and we used regular russet potatos that were cubed before boiling.  Big hit at our cookout!  Thanks!

I made this several times and it has always been a hit. I've been told that it is the best people have had and it's always thed first thing gone, which is enough to make anyone feel good. I differ from the recipe sometimes but its always the base of my potato salad.

Wow, this is probably the first potato salad with eggs I have ever enjoyed! I omitted the celery though (personal preference) I can actually imagine making this again! Thanks!

I recently made this for a party and I was told by MANY that this was the best potato salad that they have ever tasted!  I made enough for 30 servings, and barely had any leftovers.  As other reviewers recommended, I used a little extra bacon (1 lb) and also about 1 cup of sour cream. I omitted the celery as well.  It was perfect!  I loves the simplicity of it and the hint of the Dijon flavor was mouth watering! Can't wait to make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

My family loved this potato salad.  The only changes I made were to add a little more bacon (my husband is a bacon fanatic), some chopped dill pickles and sliced green onions. Yummy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Best potato salad ever! My husband can't wait to have a family picnic so he can "show off his wife's potato salad" I didn't have dijon mustard and I know how important (and different) the flavor is... but I still made it special by using not only yellow mustard but also 2 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar. I mix the yellow mustard with the apple cider while the potatoes are boiling. When the potatoes are still hot (right after being cooked) I place them in a baking sheet, pour the mix of mustard and vinegar on top of them (so they absorb the flavor and they are very tasty INSIDE) season with black pepper and salt and toss them. Cover with Saran wrap and place them in the fridge until they are cool enough to add the rest of the ingredients (mayo, onion, bacon, etc) -add more mustard *if needed* once mixed with the rest of the stuff-

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but I added a few personal touches. I really don't like parsley and I added a small red onion (sweet)and red potatoes (small and chopped)) to put some color to the salad. 
(I am lazy when it comes to frying bacon. I put the bacon strips on a foil lined cookie sheet, and placed it in a 420 degree oven till it's crispy. Drain the bacon on a plate lined with paper towel.)
Made this with "Shake and Bake" barbecued pork chops,corn bread and Brussels spouts. Can't go wrong there. Yummy!!!!

This is very good. It is not mind-blowing, but it is very appetizing and SO much better than buying store deli-counter potato salad!
I substituted about 1 1/2 tsp of celery seed as the texture of celery does not appeal to me. It had that nice hint of flavor without the weird raw crunch.

Instead of salt and pepper, I used Mrs Dash Table Seasoning...and this was a fine substitution as well.

I made this last night so the flavors could blend which I'm glad I did but I still can't taste any bacon flavor.  I think I'm going to add some more as garnish before serving.  I also cut up the red potatoes before boiling (with skins on) and it worked out nicely.

I never made potato salad before and was told it was the BEST they had ever had! This shows how simple it really is for a novice like me. Sub. green onion for celery.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I did change a couple things. I'm not a big fan of eggs in potato salad. Something about the taste and texture I just don't enjoy, so I left the eggs out. Also I dislike celery, it has a bitter taste to me so I replaced the celery with no more than a 1/4 cup green onions. I reduced the recipe to just 4 serving cause it was only my boyfriend and me. 

Tip: the best potatoes to use in any potato salad are red potatoes. I'm from the south and I love potato salad, and the best ones I've had are made with red potatoes.

I thought this was really good. I took the advise of another review and did 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. Turned out great!!

I don't like potato salad but was asked to bring one to a bbq.  I picked this one b/c of the high rating and you know what?  I enjoyed it.  Maybe it was the bacon that won me over.  I will definately pull it out next time I'm asked for a potato salad contribution!  Thanks.

Yum!  Made a double batch for my large crew and they wiped it out.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on.  Lite mayo worked just fine, as well as the full pound of turkey bacon I added.

Delicious!!  I used yellow mustard because I didn't have any Dijon and extra bacon (is it possible to have too much bacon?).  I also didn't mash the eggs.  I mixed the potatoes with the mayo and mustard and then stirred in the celery, bacon and cut up egg.  This is exactly the way I like my potato salad!

I've made this for years. It's my favorite potatoe salad. I usually make it if I have 10 potatoes I'll use 5 eggs, or 4 potatoes, 2 eggs,[and so on] and adjust the mayo and mustard to taste. I use yellow mustard. Sometimes with bacon sometimes without, or like this time just sprinkled on top.

I love this recipe!  It was the first potato salad i ever made, and I have made it at least 30 times since then.  I always have people asking for the recipe!  I don't measure much, though and eyeball the consistency of the mayo.  I always use a whole pack of bacon instead of the few slices-so worth it. I have made it with all kinds of potatoes, but find that red skinned have a soft buttery texture that works wonderfully.  It is so easy, and I always bring to pot lucks at our church.  I have had people say "did you bring it"  as soon as I walk in the door.  A  true keeper! If you are in a hurry, a presure cooker works great for the potatoes, and the hormel real bacon pieces are a time saver too!

Excellent!  My husband was raving about a friends wonderful potato salad with bacon.  I had to find a recipe that was even better...this one was, first time!  Second time I made it for a party, used 5 lbs potatoes, 2 lbs bacon, 2 cups sour cream, 2 cups mayo, 5 eggs (all I had at the time) and 4 tbls yellow mustard.  Perfect!

AMAZING!  I had never made potato salad before and decided to try this yesterday for a BBQ.  It was super easy.  I used Yellow mustard instead of Dijon, added more bacon, added half of a red onion, diced, for flavor and color, and omitted the parsley and topping of eggs.  My husband would not stop eating it!  He even told me it was better than his uncles, the family reunion potato salad king!  I guess I have to use this one again!

This is a great and simple potato salad. I cooked my bacon in the oven for about 10 minutes, until it was very crispy. Cut the recipe in half to 4 servings. Add about 1 tbsp of white onion and 1 tbsp cayenne pepper. Didn't have Dijon mustard so I used regular mustard instead. Didn't have parsley so used dried dill weed. Topped off with chopped green onion. I didn't mash the eggs in the beginning, instead I put all the ingredients in the bowl, then tossed them all together. I had also made World's Best Potato Salad on this site, and this one tops it by far. This recipe is a keeper that I will be using as a base for my potato salads from now on.

I made a double batch for our annual 4th of July party.  It was very, very tasty.  I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any on hand, and used lite Miracle Whip for the mayo.  Will make this in the future instead of my mama's recipe (sorry Mom!).

Really good, had 10 pounds of potatoes I needed to use up and found this recipe. I cubed the potatoes for faster boiling and mixed everything together instead of using it for garnish. Husband and kid approved, going in my cookbook, thanks! Oh, and thanks to the reviewer who told me how to cook bacon in the oven...SO much easier.

Really quite good!  I didn't have any celery, but it was still good. Plus I went a little easy on the Dijon, but I definitely will make it again and follow the recipe to a T.

My family has made their potato salad this way for over 40 years!  I add more bacon, add a finely chopped small onion (optional) and only use the eggs if I'm in the mood!  I always get rave reviews with this - and everyone who's ever tried mine, are now adding bacon to theirs!

This was pretty good and very easy to make. Next time I'll use more mustard and maybe some red onions.

This was the first time I ever made potatoe salad the right way.  Any other time it was runny.  This was just perfect.  The only thing is, I do not think that I should have cooked the potatoes that long.  Other than that,  Mmmm Mmmm Good!

This was a big hit. How can you go wrong with bacon and mayo? I thought about throwing some cheddar cheese in bit was just too busy. It doesn't need anything else but cheese would have been another level of delicious.

I only made a few small changes.  I didn't add celery, I mixed all 5 eggs in and I added more dijon then called for.  It's perfect!

This recipe was fabulous!  Added more bacon than the recipe called for.. and used turkey bacon.
Also added diced red onions and green onions for added crunch. Mixed ranch in with the mayonnaise and dijon mixtue.
Soooo good!

This was delicious.  I made it with lowfat mayo and didn't miss the fat at all!  The only change I made was adding finely minced red onion, I just felt that potato salad always could use onion, but otherwise, I will make this again and again.

I have been looking for a good potato salad for a long time.  Finally one I can really sink my teeth into!  I omitted the celery (personal preference) and added a tomatillo for the color and a little bit of zing.  Absolutely wonderful!

I really liked this potato salad. Strayed a bit from the original:  I didn't peel my potatoes, used mayonnaise with lime (that's what they sell here in Mexico) and I didn't have dijon mustard so I used regular plus a little vinegar.  I was super hungry and gobbled some if it right away (potatoes were still warm, but I couldn't wait.) At first I thought it was a little bland, but after several hours in the refrigerator it was perfect!  Next time I make it I'll mix everything but the bacon the night before, then add crisp bacon before serving (just a personal preference.) Gracias!

This recipe was a hit with all of my friends that tried it. I cook the potatoes the day before and chill them, and add a bit more bacon than called for. This is a great base, but also wonderful on its own. I made it without eggs, and used veganaise as a mayo substitute and no one missed the eggs :)

Awesome!! Amazing!!! I loved it, my mom loved it, and the kids loved it! I wasn't sure how much 2lbs of potatoes were so I only used 5 and it was more than enough. I also only used 3 eggs because I just don't know where they'd be room for another one. Another thing is I peeled my potatoes before boiling them, I thought it'd be easier since they were nice and cool. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is my favorite potato salad recipe.  The bacon and celery add texture and flavor.  I do add some paprika and season salt to give it a little more flavor. Thanks for a keeper!

This was the first time I had ever made home-made potato salad.  It was good, but not great.  I'm not sure what it was lacking, but it definitely needed more flavor.  I'll try again, and throw in a few more spices.  I'm sure it can be a five-star salad by the end of summer.  :)

This is a great basic potato salad. I loved that the texture of the eggs varied-  it's a good idea to smash some and cut others ( i left out the yok of the ones I cut) and it gave the salad a good visual quality. I made the salad a bit sweeter but using a dijon mustard made with honey. Using red potatoes instead of russet added more flavor. The bacon was definitely the highlight- I made sure not to crumble in the fatty parts.

My daughter has been begging for a potato salad with bacon, and this one fits the bill.  I'd omit the salt, as the mustard and bacon add quite a bit - but other than that, very good, and very pretty.  I may be adding onions and dill next time too!

Amazingly delicious!  I made a few changes: Extra bacon (of course! - yum), split the mayo to half mayo, half sour cream for a lighter, creamier texture, no celery (personal preference, and added half an onion.  Yum. Yum. Yum. As soon as my husband tasted it he said "you might want to get going on another batch" lol

Great starting recipe! I Omitted celery because my father won't eat it. Used red peppers and red onion. Also left skins on red potatoes.Also I don't know who the people who measured this recipe were feeding but I used 5 lbs of potatoes ad that barely was enough.. Maybe I just make an amazing potato salad but if you plan on really feeded 8 people I would double it!
Up Date: Made this again for Memorial Day party tomorrow. I am doing 15 lbs of potatoes. PS this Keeps fine in fridge overnight. FYI for first timers if u got picky eaters mash to cooked yolk in with the mustard and what not till smooth all those egg haters picking out the white will have no idea!

This is exactly the way Mom makes her tater salad. Which is the way I make mine also. Almost... One small difference is we leave the skin on the taters. It's so easy and tasty I can't believe there are so many truly yucky potato salads out there!

I didn't get rave reviews for this one, and it wasn't really the creamy mayo-based salad I thought it would be.  It was edible, but I felt like the mustard was too strong and overpowered the bacon, plus it seemed to be missing something.  I probably won't try this one again.

Very nice, could use a little more mustard though, and I added some pickle juice and diced pickles for a more tangy flavor.

This was great - even better the next day I think!  I got a great tip from a friend:  add a little pickle juice to the mayo mixture.  It adds a little something!  Of course it tastes divine as is and was a hit at the last pot luck BBQ.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe. I used half a small onion and about a tablespoon of garlic, then omitted the celery. It was perfect....The dijon is an excellent addition!

This was terrific!!! I only had spicy brown mustard so i used that and my bacon was maple flavored so i used what i had. It came out great,but next time i will use regular bacon because the maple bacon slightly took over the dish.Nobody else thought so,its just all in what you like i guess! Definitly a keeper! Thanks

Very good!  I use a little less mayo and more dijon for extra kick.  I always forget to buy celery when I make this so I just add raw onion and it tastes great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  This was my 1st attempt at potato salad it would have been perfect if I didn't have extra crunchy potatoes - next time!  I didn't use the celery.  My picky husband even liked it!  Will definitely try again hopefully without the crunchy potatoes.
2015 An update: This is my go to potato salad recipe! We love the bacon! I don't use the celery & use 1 cup mayo & 1 cup miracle whip. This has been a crew favorite over the years!

This salad was good.  I don't think it was worth the rave reviews it has received.  It's like eating egg salad mixed with potato salad.  I don't think this salad tastes bacony. I would change the name to Potato and Egg Salad.

Well, it was good, but really lacked in flavor, I added more ingredients after making the recipe as noted.  I added dill pickles, black olives, minced onion, galic salt, and more mayo & mustard.

Neither my husband or I cared for this.  It was kinda bland.  I had to add more mayo, more mustard and a variety of spices to make it tasty for us.  Sorry - I just wasn't impressed.

For years I've been a fan of my grandmother's potato salad, and so was quite distressed when I couldn't find her recipe the the other day.  So I hopped on good ol' allrecipes.com and came across this WONDERFUL recipe.  SOOO easy, SOOO delicious, and I'm sorry to say Grandma... I won't be going back to yours.  I made the recipe almost exactly as written, but used red potatoes so I didn't have to peel them, and also doubled the bacon as a few people suggested.  I didn't have parsley on hand so sliced some bell pepper rings on top for garnish ~ it was quick, easy and what a winner, my husband has already begged me to make it again.

we didn't love this one I'm sorry to say.  It was sort of bland to us.  I ultimately added pickles and olives to see if I could liven it up, but no luck.  It sounded so good.  I'm bummed it didn't go over very well with the family.

I didnt like how much mayonaise there is in this recipe. So I used two tablespoons of mayonaise and made up the rest of the cup with plain yogurt.

Instead of celery, I added half a minced onion for a bit more bite.


My friends were begging for the recipe!

My grown kids and I really liked it....my husband said he liked the plainer one I used to make better.  But he doesn't like eggs, so I just put them around the edges for everyone else.

This turned out good, nice and fresh, but could have used a little zing (maybe a touch of balsamic vinegar?).

Really great basic recipe. I added a few extra slices of bacon and a touch extra of Dijon per my taste. I’ve made this recipe about 5 times and everyone loves it!!

This is hands down the best potato salad I have ever had.  Any time we have a family get together or a work function I am requested to bring my potato salad.  Even had to make an extra bowl cause people wanted to take some home.  Its that good.

I am giving it a 5 stars because I know it would be delicious as is, but I did not have red potatoes, so I used the regular ones. I probably added more bacon than 3 slices, and I didn't put any eggs in. I took it to a BBQ and even with all the changes, people loved it. Would definitely make again!

I brought this to a family party and everyone seemed to like it.  The original dressing though was incredibly thick and heavy.  Even adding about a half cup of milk didn't thin it out to the consistency I preferred.  It tasted great though all the same, and there weren't any leftovers.

It was great! I followed the suggestions by Frantic Cook, and wilted the celery a little by adding a little salt and let the water out for a little while, as I learned from another potato salad recipe. Very filling and creamy, the red potatoes add a little crunch to it.

Added whole grain dijon mustard and green beans. Also threw in the celery greens from the stalks as well. You could easily add chopped chicken to make this a complete meal.

Eliminated celery, just didn't have it on hand, added chopped onion, chopped dill pickle and a bit of dill pickle juice.  Replaced Dijon with Horseradish mustard and added some paprika.  Bowl was scraped clean and I had lots of compliments.  Will make this again.

I deleted the egg, the celery, and used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 ranch dressing instead of mayo. I also diced up spicy pickles and added them as well.

Super tasty. I put in more bacon, because I love bacon. I also added some diced pickled jalapenos, because I love spice. I served this at bbq and it was eaten quickly! People took seconds and even thirds! Yum :)

YUM!  My husband begs me to make this now, thanks for the great recipe!  I appreciated also the instructions on how to start from the beginning- how to boil a potato since I'd never done that!  I used turkey bacon and omitted the celary(I don't like it), super duper yummy!

I made this salad, omitted celery, used only 4 eggs, and used 1\2 cup lowfat sour cream and a 1\2 cup mayo instead of a whole cup of mayo. I also added 1\3 cup chopped red onion and 1\2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. It came out wonderful!

I cut this in half, used the full amount of bacon, two eggs and low-fat mayo. I did add a little fresh ground pepper, too. At my oldest boy's request, I did add one very large garlic dill pickle. This is potato salad at it's very simplest and really, sometimes simple is where it's at. Next time, I might add a little chopped red or green onions. EDITED: I will add that I left my eggs and celery chunky, just because that's the way we like our potato salad. I just tossed the ingredients in the bowl and folded in the combined mayo and dijon.

Everyone really liked this! I was a little scared because I've never made potato salad before, but I will definitely make this again. I didn't have any celery (boo!) and I also used spicy brown mustard because that's what I had in the fridge. I noticed that some reviewers thought it was rather dry, so I added an additional one cup of sour cream -- next time I will reduce this because I didn't need all of it. I garnished with paprika (my son is convinced this makes a difference). I made enough for 30 servings and it was almost all gone. Good stuff!

This was my choice for the 4th of July picnic, and EVERYONE loved it! I omitted the slices of egg on top and just put all the egg in the salad, and I doubled the recipe and the bacon. I was lucky and picked the right recipe of all the potatoe salads. This one really was a hit!

Didn't have parsley or celery, but made anyway. It was a hit at a family bbq. Delicious flavor. Only had 1 tablespoon of dijon, so I used 1 tbls of regular mustard. Everyone liked it. Will definitely make again.

Sooo yummy and perfect as written. It was so much easier than boiling, cooling, peeling then cutting potatoes. Which is why I never make potato salad. It definitely had a baked potato flavor.

was very good, but i'm going to try using the "base" recipe; leave out the bacon (it is what got soggy and made the salad seem old quicker) add some chopped sweet baby gerkins and just a small bit of minced fresh red onion........ ill let you know!

We weren't too impressed by this recipe, it didn't taste bad it was just very bland.  I thought maybe it would taste better after sitting overnight but that didn't help it any.  I still have half of it left and I may try mixing in some ranch dressing and cheese to see if that helps out any, kind of like a baked potato maybe?   I wanted to try something different but I guess I will stick to my other recipe.

I made a double batch of this the day before serving.  At others' suggestions I mixed the bacon into the salad instead of sprinkling on top.  Problem was, the bacon all but disappeared!  If I were to make it again i'd leave the bacon out altogether because who needs the extra calories of an entire pound of bacon in their potato salad whene you don't even taste it?  Maybe sprinkling the bacon on top would have helped bring the taste to the forefront? Otherwise it was good.

We LOVED this recipe. It was my first time making potato salad and it went swimmingly.  As most of you did, I "made it my own." Omitted the celery(:P), used half light sour cream and half ranch dressing instead of the Mayo. YUM!

I love this recipe. I don't understand why some people found it bland. I use 3 eggs total. But I use twice as much bacon. (I get Boars Head Naturally Smoked. It adds a little smoky flavor that goes well at a bbq)I also put a little cayenne pepper in as well. this is a great recipe that can be tweeked to fit your liking. Also does anyone know how the bacon holds up if you make it the day before you serve it? Im afraid it wont be as crunchy so I always make it same day. Any tips would be great

Amazing!  I was going for something similar to "Steakhouse potato salad" but this really didn't even resemble it!  I surpassed it by a mile!  By far the best potato salad ever and even my boyfriend who is possibly one of the least enthusiastic people (at least when it comes to giving descriptive complements on food) said it was exquisite!  Everyone will love it.  I changed nothing but added a bit more bacon 'cause the pieces were really small.

Excellent potato salad.  The only change I made was to add a few chopped onions.  This salad kept nicely the next two days and didn't get watery like most leftover potato salads.

I cheated and substituted the real bacon bits from a jar and this potato salad was very tasty. Will make again.

This was a very good and creamy potato salad. I did add more bacon than called for and I didn't have any fresh parsley so I left that out. We really enjoyed this! I will definately make this one again! Thanks for posting :)

I just learned a few months ago what a tsp meant and i cried during my making of this recipe. It turned out amazing but i cried cuz i thought my potatoes were going to be mushy. It was really good though.

I love the tanginess from this recipe.  I added about (I don't measure) a tablespoon and a half of vinegar to the dijon/mayonnaise dressing along with paprika to give it a little "zing".  I also sprinkle paprika over the entire potato salad before refrigerating it.

Just okay. I didn't see where the recipe said to cut up the potatoes, but I did anyway. I thought it could've used more crumbled bacon. These directions for boiling eggs did not work for me, turned out with the whites stuck to the shell and a medium-done yolk, but I never boiled eggs before so I'm not necessarily faulting the recipe. My biggest complaint is that this is pretty bland. I ended up adding 1/2 C of Italian dressing and 1/4 C of sweet relish to add some flavor.

One of the best homemade potato salads I have ever tasted! I used red bliss potatoes and next time I would like to use red bliss and yukon gold together and see how that turns out.  I did not have bacon so I used those bacon bits in a jar.  It was okay in a pinch but next time, I'm going for the real thing!  I love this recipe and will make it again.

Really good potato salad (PS)recipe. One of the best I've ever tried. It's the first time I've ever made potato salad without onions. Thought it would be flat with out them, but it wasn't.

I didn't have any Dijon Mustard (and am not a big fan of mustard in PS), so I added some juice from my caper bottle. It added a nice little zing without being over powering. I also had to add some milk to thin the mixture. I like my PS looser... so that worked great.

I'll definitely make this recipe again... and may even one time try it with the dijon mustard.

This was good not as good as my Mothers she makes the best potato salad I could never do it like hers. The only thing I would change in this would be to add some onion, and some pickle, and a littlbit more celery. but other than that it was very good.

My second try at making potato salad and it was perfect! I didn't change anything except for only using 1 T Dijon instead of 2. You could still taste it if you were aware of it in there. This was very good!

This was really good potato salad.  The bacon is what really makes it!  Someone made it for a potluck at work and I will be making it myself soon.

The bacon in this potato salad is a man pleaser. My husband and all his buddies love this potato salad. We girls seem to love it too. I know I do. I cut the celery (simply because I don't like it) and add extra bacon and some dill relish. The combination of the cooked potatoes and the crispy bacon is outstanding. I won't use another potato salad recipe now!

This was so good. I added red onions, three extra slices of bacon ,and a little extra mustard to kick it up. The is by no means a plain salad for those of you who rated it that way. I am very pleased with the way this turned out.

I made this for Easter, this last year and everyone loved it!  I added more mustard and red onion!  Yummy!
