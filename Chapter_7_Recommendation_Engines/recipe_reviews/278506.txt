I’ve never been able to make a bean burger until now. This recipe held together surprisingly well, cooked decently and the flavor is okay. Ohh and it uses no egg.  I halved the entire recipe and it made 7 fairly large burgers. Next time I will need to add more seasonings to make it more flavorful but overall I think this is a great bean burger recipe. Especially since I’m technically still a beginner and actually was able to pull this off without problems. Thank you to the contributor.
