I must say, this is a very good recipe.  I have a few suggestions to offer that really help tweak it (at least in my opinion).  Use fresh baby spinach, fresh is always better.  Skip the mozzarella, it detracts from the dish.  I actually put the fresh spinach in the cream mixture and cook the spinach that way.  I spread the spinach and cream mixture over the scallops, top off with a dusting of italian seasoned bread crumbs, a nice mix of romano and parm cheese and then a very light dusting of Creole seasoning.  This really adds some flavor.  Bake at the temp suggested for 10 minutes then broil for the remaining 5 min.  Really works nicely.  Serve with Basil rice for a real treat.

This is a fabulous, easy recipe.  I steamed a 10 oz. bag of fresh baby spinach instead of using the frozen variety.  I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream and used unsalted butter.  I used just a sprinkling of Old Bay, pepper and mozzarella before baking.  I did not precook the scallops, and baked the whole thing for 25 minutes.  The scallops came out perfectly done- the sauce had lots of flavor, without overpowering the scallops.  My husband declared it a home run.
Note:  One night when we had unexpected company, I added a pound of shrimp to the mix and it made this recipe twice as good.  I will use a combination of one pound shrimp, one pound sea scallops from now on.  The loaded-with-seafood approach makes it absolutely stunning.

We just had this tonight - and it was great! My partner insists he is not much on "seafood" unless it is fried catfish or shrimp. He also has a strong aversion to "foo-foo" food, which this clearly is.  Even at that - he put this in the recipe book himself!! I made a few changes: Deleted - Old Bay Seasoning (I don't like the taste of it). Also did not precook the scallops, based on other reviews - it was a good call. I also have a way of making the sauce without the added butter. The less fat in this dish, the more often we can have it!
Added - 2 cups cooked rice to bottom of dish (I'd prefer a wild/brown mixture myself, but SOMEBODY only likes white rice). Topped with 5-6 mushrooms, sliced & sauted. 
Substitutions -  5 Italian Cheese mix for mozzerella and non-fat half & half for heavy cream (yes, they do make such a thing). I also used fresh spinach (1 bunch) but I think I will use whole leaf frozen next time and see how that works. If not then I will use 2 bunches of fresh - dry fry until soft and lay out in a layer over scallops. Things to change for next time - make a double batch of sauce. This was certainly a great dish, not much work, and well worth the effort. I would serve it to company any day.  I can see that it can be made up ahead of time, and refrigerated before baking. Serve with a salad, maybe bread and something very light for dessert. Even without the salad this will serve 6 at our house easily.

This is one of those recipes that tastes like it comes from a great restaurant! Like others, I used fresh spinach leaves not frozen. I used 1/2 pound each of shrimp and scallops. To further make it "my own", I added a dash each of onion powder and garlic salt in place of the Old Bay seasoning. To cut down on the fat a little, I used half-and-half in place of the heavy cream and Smart Balance in place of the butter. A suggestion - Wondra Flour for sauces blends smoother than regular flour. Another great alteration was adding 3/4 cup chopped artichoke hearts. I also put the seafood in without cooking it first. Cook for 25-30 minutes and it comes out just fine! Fantastic recipe, thanks!

This was wonderfull!!!! I did however make a few changes.

I did not boil scallops.  Just ran hot water over frozen 1 ½ lb pkg of scallops until ½ thawed.  Put in 9x13 pan.  Put steamed baby spinach on top.  Doubled cream sauce using Kraft’s three cheese poured over all toped with Italian bread crumbs used some of Emerald’s seasoning did not have any Old Bay.  Backed 350 for ½ hour or until bubbly.  Hmmmmm the best thing I have ever made and my family loved it!!!! I may try puting shrimp with it next time we love sea food and this is just the best!

I don't think you need to boil the scallops first-I  instead baked for about 20-25 minutes at 350 and they came out perfect. I used less Old Bay than called for- I think a tablespoon might make it too salty.
Also, I don't think this takes 30 minutes prep time as the recipe says. I cooked the spinach in the micro while I made the sauce. It takes a minute or so to press the water from the spinach and then the recipe goes together quickly. I put the scallops directly in the pie plate instead of boiling. So prep time is less than 15 minutes. I would rather spend less prep time and a little more time in the oven so I can do some other things while it cooks.

My husband , who is usually neutral on scallops really liked this, and I did too. Whenever I make scallops I'll use this recipe from now on.

This is very good. I used fat free half and half, I didn't pre-cook the scallops and used salt-free creole seasoning. I wouldn't use as much seasoning as the recipe calls for and no extra salt. It wasn't too salty. Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely fabulous!!I skipped step #2(pre-boiling is not necessary--they bake perfectly in the oven for 25 minutes). I used fresh spinach which I tore into smaller, bite-size pieces. (You could probably use baby spinach.I omitted the OLD BAY seasoning (as did lots of other reviewers who said it made it too salty). Half of the bread crumbs I used were italian style. Its very rich, but you could probably substitute milk for the cream for a lighter version.
I don't think you need a side dish... we ate caesar salads while it baked and drank white wine with dinner...yummy. Thanks Deb!!

This was very good.  I, too, read the other reviews and did not cook the scallops ahead of time, I used fresh baby spinach, used milk instead of cream, italian bread crumbs -- and I added some fresh crushed garlic, not alot, but it just gave the sauce a hint of it -- YUM!!!! I also elimated the mozzarella b/c the parmesan is perfect!!!  Served it over NO YOLK noodles!!!  We loved it!!!  Thanks for sharing, Deb!!!!

The recipe was very easy to prepare.  It was delicious, rich, creamy and tasty.  Next time I make it I won't poach the scallops and I won't use the Old Bay seasoning and either skip the mozzarella or substitute it with some other cheese, like Monteray Jack.  Overall my husband and I really like.  Good Job, Deb.

Don't precook the scallops. I used fat-free half & half, and added about a tsp of low-sodium Old Bay to the sauce. I think a little Cajun or Creole seasoning might be substituted for the Old Bay. I also added the spinach to the sauce.  I skipped the mozzarella, and used panko with a little parm as a topping.  I also spritzed it with a little olive oil, and sprinkled a littled paprika on it for color.  20 minutes cooked it perfectly.  I think I might use some shucked oysters, cook for about 10 minutes, and have a faux oysters Rockefeller casserole.

I love this recipe! I use 1% milk instead of cream, steamed baby spinach instead of frozen and I omit the mozzerella. It comes out fantastic! Very rich and creamy.

Good concept, but way too many salty ingredients.  I followed the advice of other reviewers, by omitting the M. cheese.  I also cut way back on the Old Bay, because of reviewers who had found it salty.  It was still very salty, probably due to the parmesan cheese.  I may try it again someday, by substituting other white cheeses for most of the parmesan, and sticking with just a sprinkling of Old Bay, or substituting other herbs for that, too.

This was delicious, but I did "tweek" the recipe a bit.  I sauteed 2/3 cup vidalia onion in the butter before adding the flour.  I also added about 1T. cooking sherry to the sauce before I poured it over the spinach.  It was delicious!!!

Well...this recipe made me a hero at my house :D I made this for my mothers birthday, and she loves seafood so I wanted to make sure I made her the best thing possible. Well, this is it. I did modify it, as per the other reviewers suggestions: used half and half instead of heavy cream, used a pound of scallops and just under a pound of shrimp, didn't pre-boil them but cooked it all for 30 minutes. I added an 8 oz bag of spinach to the cream mixture as it cooked, as well as some garlic. I actually had my wisdom teeth taken out the other day so I was holding a bag of peas to my face and had the brainwave "why don't I add some of these?" so I tossed them on top of the seafood, poured the spinach cream on top and sprinkled some Parmesan, Italian seasoning, basil and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper on top. I didn't bother with any other cheese or the breadcrumbs. I served it with whole wheat fettuccini noodles and it was a home run, in the grandstands, grand slam, world tournament winning meal! We were all freaking out over how good it was. The only thing I might change for next time is to reduce the butter slightly ( I doubled the sauce) but that might have been my fault in the first place since I just eyeballed the butter. Thanks for the smashing recipe to make for my mom!

Super Recipe – thanks!  I did not parboil the scallops but rather cooked for 25 minutes as other reviewers suggested – they were perfectly cooked.  Also, I used a good gruyere cheese instead of mozzarella because I couldn’t bring myself to put mozzarella on scallops.  It was a perfect combination of flavors.  Fontina will be good too as another reviewer suggested.  Next time I will try fresh baby spinach just to see the difference.  The recipe is rich… & so delicious.

I was worried that this sauce wouldn't be flavorful enough, or worse that I'd drown my (expensive) scallops in it and end up with a rubbery mess, but everyone in my home absolutely loved this recipe. It's a welcome change from typical lemon/garlic/white wine approaches to shellfish and the flavors meld together wonderfully. We made double the sauce and served this with a side of angel hair pasta and there were no leftovers the next day. I think what especially helps is making sure you get good quality scallops -- I ended up getting scallops from two different stores and there was a marked difference. Look for scallops that are large and firm and they'll hold up to the sauce and cooking much better and will add wonderful flavor as well. This recipe really doesn't need any fiddling with as far as I'm concerned, but maybe next time I'll try the seasoned bread crumbs as some people did, and perhaps a touch of garlic or some other seasoning.

Very good.  I used half and half instead of the cream and also skipped the step of boiling the scallops as I read in other reviews.  Took someone else's tip of making lemon thyme rice from this website and it paired perfectly.  Yum.

oh my goodness this is tasty!! i followed these suggestions 1)no old bay, mozzarella, or pre cooking 3)cooked fresh baby spinach in the sauce 4)added a couple cloves of garlic to the sauce 5)skim milk instead of heavy cream 6)seasoned breadcrumbs. I know that's a lot of changes, but otherwise the recipe was easy and good. I do think I could have used less butter (2 tbsp?) Oh, and I'm still glowing from dinner...YUM

These were pretty good!  Loved the sauce they were baked in.  The scallops do not need to be cooked first otherwise they get over done.

GREAT flavor! I omitted boiling the scallops first, that isn't necessary, just bake a few minutes longer. I also used all italian blend shredded cheese instead of parmesan and mozzarella. I think that is more flavorful. I also used some seasoned bread crumbs and that was a great addition as well. My 6 year old daughter loved it and there wasn't any left, I also used more than a pound, it was about a pound and 2/3 and kept the measurements the same and it turned out great. I did add a bit more breadcrumbs I think but not much. My hubby isn't a big scallop fan but he did eat this all up! I really does taste like something you would order out of a nice restaurant. Great dish for company if they like seafood. It's really easy and taste superb.

YUM!  This is delicious!  And the best part is it's so simple and quick, perfect for a mom who looks at the clock at 5:30 and says, "What's for dinner?"  I, too, skipped the precooking of scallops and used milk instead of cream. Thanks for a wonderful new recipe, Deb!!

Great recipe! I skipped the parboiling, the extra cheese and crumb topping. Also skipped the old bay seasoning. Used some garlicy croutons crushed instead. Made it ahead and cooked it for about 25 mins. We loved it!!

The recipe was pretty good - it was my first time cooking with scallops and i loved the creamy, cheesy taste.  The one thing I did not like was the Old Bay seasoning on top!  Everyone I made it for took the whole topping off because of the Old Bay.  I think the Old Bay would have worked better if it was mixed in the cream sauce, if you like the taste.  As for myself, I'll just exclude it the next time I make this dish.

I guess I am the exception, but I did not care for this. Way too salty between the salt, cheese, and Old Bay. I used fresh spinach but otherwise made no changes. I will not make this again.

This was very good but next time I will play around with it a little as we found it a tad too bland and a touch too salty.

Delicious!  I made this recipe twice and decided to make it for a staff pot luck after my co-worker tasted it.  The second time, I decided to tweak it.  I mixed the old bay and breadcrumbs together and then sprinkled them on top.  This didn't make the old bay too pungent.

This recipe looks and tastes every bit like a gourmet restaurant dish.  It's fancy enough for a special occasion, yet quick and quite easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my wife and I really enjoyed it.  A word of caution however for step #3, the part about seasoning to taste: I added pepper and just a shake or two of salt here, and even the little bit of added salt was too much.  I will skip the added salt next time, because there is plenty of salt in the cheese ingredients.  Additionally, we found the Old Bay seasoning to be VERY strong; I will omit it next time and perhaps try seasoned breadcrumbs.  Overall, a great dish in my opinion; I'll use it for company I want to impress.

Great taste and very easy to make - my husband and I both loved this recipe.  Substituted fat free half & half for the heavy cream & margarine for the butter with excellent results.  Also added crushed garlic, paprika, ground celery seed, mustard and cloves to the butter in Step 3 &  omitted Old Bay sprinkle at the end.  Very tasty served on a bed of pasta.

My husband and I liked this very much.  My 9 year old didn't like it at all.  I lightened it up by using milk, and cut 1 TB butter.  After reading other reviews, I did not poach scallops beforehand. I will make this again.  I served this over rice.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I cut some fat by using fat free half and half and about half of the specified cheese.  The receipe was still very rich and flavorful.  I can't wait to make it again for friends.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I decided to make this 1 hour before my dinner guests arrived and even had to go to the grocery!  It's so easy to prepare.  I used fresh baby spinach (bagged)and skipped the mozzarella cheese (as suggested by an earlier reviewer) and everyone thought it was a rich and luscious meal.  I served over a gourmet pasta.  I would suggest you serve with a steamed vegie or light tossed salad as it is rich, rich, rich.  This is a great recipe that I will make again! Thanks!

This dish was very good, but you definitely don't
need to cook the scallops first. They cook just
beautifully in the oven. Also, you can save 
a lot of calories by using milk instead of heavy
cream.

This dish was outstanding. I used 2lbs of scallops and an additional 1/2 recipe of the sauce.  I also took the advise of others and used half and half instead of  heavy cream , good  choice. It was so good, the four of us just about ate ever bit.

Perhaps is the cheeses and Bay seasoning had been blended together it might not have been so bad...but individually sprinkled on top was too much.

Way too salty!  I am not a regular user of Old Bay Seasoning and after I made the dish, I read the first ingredient of Old Bay was celery salt. I barely added any salt to the recipe since the cheese was salty enough.  I liked everything but the saltiness, so when I make it again, will cut way back on the Old Bay and add no salt whatsoever.  The first time I make a recipe I make no substitutions and so I followed this recipe exactly.  It has possibilities, liked the combination of scallops and spinach, but the salt took most of the enjoyment out of the dish.

This was excellent.  Like many reviewers, I didn't bother pre-cooking the scallops.  I also used fresh spinach steamed briefly in the micro and then combining it with the sauce.  I left out the mozzarella as I didn't have any and used Asiago instead (-highly recommend!).  My biggest diversion came when I was called away right before putting the bread crumbs on top and putting it in the oven.  I covered it with tin foil, put it in the 'fridge and hoped for the best.  When I got home 2 hrs. later, I finished it off and baked it.  (Scallops are too expensive to waste!)  To my surprise it tasted wonderful!  Thanks so much for the recipe PONYGIRL64.  Maybe next time I can do it correctly!

This dish was so great and we used what we had.  Instead of heavy cream, used half and half, didnt have 2 pounds of scallops or the right amount of cheese.  We used fresh spinach instead of frozen and served it with rice and red wine.  We will do it again.  Great easy dinner after kids are in bed.

Outstanding!  Use 2x the spinach, nutmeg in the sauce,3/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Mix the spinach into the sauce and pour over scallops. No need to parboil the scallops, either.

This dish was yummy. I made the sauce with half and half - I personally thought the substitution was delicious but I often sub for calories' sake so for company I'll use at least half cream. I did think the recipe could easily use twice as much seafood, to the point I thought the excess cheese/sauce took away from the dish. I plan to make this with either bay or sea scallops cut into fourths, and then add an extra pound of seafood. The recipe came together quickly for being so impressive, thanks very much for sharing :)

Fabulous! Everyone at the table insisted that I make note of exactly what I did and then share it with them. I had 1½ lbs of nice scallops and that was perfect for 4 people with just a nice Italian bread salad. Unlike others, I feel that boiling the scallops for 2 minutes is important because it reduces the natural saltiness of the scallops and removes excess fishy taste. I also reduced the bay seasoning to 2 teaspoons, used 6 ounces of fresh baby spinach cooked in the cream sauce along with 4 finely chopped green onions and 4 finely chopped brown mushrooms. I also substituted gruyere for the mozza which turned out wonderful. I added about a half teaspoon of garlic powder to the cream sauce and used Italian bread crumbs as others had suggested. I ended up adding about a 1/3 cup of 1% milk to the sauce to thin it a bit and the sauce turned out so good that I will make it the exact same way in the future. This really was one of those recipes that will become permanant in our recipe book of family favorites. I'm looking forward to trying it with different kinds of fish, like shrimp or fresh walleye.

Wonderful.  I did not pre-cook the scallops on the advice of other reviewers.  I made my own heavy cream by reducing whole milk down to 1 cup.  Came out perfect.  I also added a little fresh dried garlic that I had dehydrated the week before.    I also added a smidgen of onion as my husband has to have onion with almost any meal.  I will make again.  Thanks

OMG - This was delish!  I took the advice of others and did not cook the scallops first.  The only other changes I did were to add basil to the sauce (appx 1 teas. - I use basil in just about everything I cook).  Also used panko bread crumbs.  This is definitely a keeper.  THANKS.....

This is so good.  I love it.  I skipped Step#2 also.  I did not want tough scallops.  I also used half and half it was what I had.  I did not have any old bay, but my flavors were still great.  I did had a few slices of garlic to the mixture.  It's rich, but not to rich and good.  I guess on measurements too, because I had a big bag of scallops and spinach.  I only sprinkled bread crumbs on top till covered, I don't think it needs 1/4 cup. Thanks will make this one again!

This was delicious.  Skipped step #2 altogether and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  Used only a smidge of mozzerella.  Cooked 12 minutes at recommended temp and then broiled on low for 3 minutes.

Good-ness! This is soooo delicious. Like others, I used fresh spinach mixed directly  into the sauce to wilt. Also did not pre-cook the scallops. Beware of the Old Bay, I always seem to forget how salty it is. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Absolutely loved these. I did use fresh baby spinach, no mozzarella and did not boil the scallops before baking. Wilted the spinach in the sauce and poured over scallops. Very good and will make again. Thanks!

My family loves this.  Definitely dinner party worthy.  To cut down on the fat I use fat free half-n-half instead of heavy cream and fresh baby spinach is much more tasty.

Yum, yum!  Delicious.  I used white pepper and nutmeg in the sauce, and used bay scallops for the base.  No need to pre-cook the scallops.  I baked at 375 for 15, and broiled for 5 minutes or so to get a nice, crunchy texture on top.  Love the additon of Old Bay, it's one of my favorite seasonings.  Hint on the spinach:  I usually use those frozen solid bricks of spinach, and have a devil of a time thawing them, this time used a 16 oz bag of frozen spinach, looser freeze, easy to thaw under water.  You will enjoy this!  Thanks for sharing.

Wow is this a crowd pleaser!  Which is what I love, since the palates at my dinner parties range from age 11 to 86.  Do not skip step 2, I skipped it the first time, then I tried the dish again with step 2 (adding sea salt to the water) and that step is important to the final taste of the dish.  I wanted the scallops to be the star of this dish so I did leave out the mozzarella cheese and the suggested amount of old bay seasoning; I doubled the recipe but I didn’t double the amount of spinach, I topped the dish with Italian bread crumbs, (which I did not measure) and I did add a very, very small smidgen of old bay, I didn’t really measure the parmesan cheese either I did end with some of the parmesan on top since I think it makes for a nice crusty top.

This recipe was great.  I added a clove of finely chopped garlic to the butter and also used 1/2 shrimp 1/2 scallops.  I also added a very small amount of fresh grated nutmeg to sauce before pouring it on seafood.  Very rich dish, but ohhhhh so good. (It's also good with a little crabmeat mixed in for texture).

My husband enjoyed this recipe...I thought it was ok. I read the other reviewers and took all the suggestions. I skipped step 2 and didn't par-boil the scallops. Well, I used BIG scallops; I think they needed to be par-boiled. One thing I added to this recipe was bacon bits and we liked that addition. If I make this again, I'll probably not read so much of the other reviews and just follow the recipe directly. Live and learn! :)

When making it for the first time, I substituted fresh baby spinach for the frozen spinach and fat free half and half for the cream and added fresh garlic to taste.  I did not precook the scallops.
It was served over egg noodles.  My husband and children (ages 6 and 11) absolutely loved it.  Everyone wanted seconds.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I used milk for the cream and creole seasoning for the Old Bay because that's all I had on hand, and I left out the breadcrumbs because I didn't have any. It's probably better the original way but it was creamy and delicious even with the substitutions. I didn't cook the scallops before I put them in the oven. The children loved this recipe and so did my husband and I. I can't wait to make this one again. Fabulous! Thanks Debra.

WAY too salty! We scraped off all the topping as it was inedible. Next time I won't use but a tsp of Old Bay or maybe none. Also, I didn't cook the scallops first and they turned out just yummy. This is a fast, easy, & elegant dish good for last minute meals for company. We loved the creamy mixture with the fresh sweet scallops (Just off the boat---we live in Maine---). This is also good with other seafood.

Very tasty but scallops were tough. Maybe it would work better not to cook scallops at all ahead of time. Oven cooking time may be enough

Very good with a little tweak.  I did as people suggested and did not cook the fish ahead of time (I also added 1/2 lb of shrimp).  I added fresh garlic when I was sauteing the butter and added fresh baby spinach with the heavy cream.  I baked the dish for 30 min (plus another few minutes for broiling).  I also omitted the mozzarella cheese and only put about 1/4 cup of an Italian cheese mix with the 1/8 cup parm cheese & bread crumbs..  Family licked the plates the clean!

Very, very good.  We added a crushed, small clove of garlic to the butter and sauteed for a few minutes before adding the flour for the roux.  Also added the spinach to the cream sauce and let cook for a couple minutes.  Only used about a teaspoon of old bay and a scant 1/4 cup of an 'italian cheese blend' in the topping, mixing together with the bread crumbs and parmesan before sprinkling over the scallops.  Baked for 30 minutes and we had a great dinner.

Added in sliced fresh mushrooms, and used fresh spinach, and didn't use the mozzarella cheese. It made a nice meal just on the stove top without the additional baking, the sauce was great. Served over linguine noodles.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! Made this for company. Hubby said it was the best scallop dish I ever made. Elegant and delicious.  Followed other's leads and did not parboil the scallops.  Also used fresh spinach (sauteed in evoo and garlic)  and gruyere cheese.  Doubled the recipe and baked for 25-30 minutes.  It is a must try if you want something fancy for dinner.

Wow, tons of reviews so I'll be brief.
I used fresh spinach wilted just a minute in the micro.  No Old Bay per other reviews (although I think a t. not a T. would be good) and did not precook the scallops. Also, I sauteed a bit of garlic in the butter before making the white sauce and added a T. of Chardonnay to the sauce.

If I could give this more stars I would. DH states that it was "wicked good". Made this last night for the first time and it will not be the last. Did not pre-boil the scallops as others stated and I only used 1/2 the old bay seasoning. Searved it over lemon thyme rice and had roasted honey carots on the side ( both from this site) with a crusty slice of garlic texas toast. Perfect. Thank you Ponygirl64 for sharing this one!

A fantastic recipe! Although I am usually critical of reviews by those who changed the recipe, I am now guilty of doing the same.  Boiling the scallops in advance is a major mistake.  Scallops are incredibly delicate and are ruined by overcooking.  Baking the casserole is plenty of time to cook them fully; any additional cooking from boiling will make them tough and less flavorful.  In fact, rinsing them first would also be a big mistake, washing away much of the flavor.  I also added fresh mushrooms and sherry, although the recipe is delicious and worthy of 5 stars without them.

This is totally awesome!  My kids wanted a "Seafood Christmas Dinner", so we made about 7 different entrees, this was the absolute favorite by all.  I didn't change the recipe at all, it's easy to make and there are no leftovers!

This recipe was so yummy!  This is the first thing I have ever reviewed on All recipes but felt compelled to do so based on the ease and taste of this particular one!  I didnt cook the scallops prior to baking (baked for 10 min) and broiled for the last 5 minutes.  The texture of the scallops were great and the spinach mixture was to die for!  My picky 2 year old loved it as well!

this was really good! i used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was plenty thick. i didnt use the mozz at all. i didnt parboil the scallops, just cooked them for 20 min and broiled for 5. i added a pound of shrimp and doubled the sauce. i used fresh spinach that i dry fried until soft. added garlic to the roux. i would have given 5 stars for taste, except for all the changes i made! definitely serve over pasta or rice for a full meal. very tasty sauce.

This recipe was very rich and very delicious. I was really amazed at how easy it was to make. It tasted like a dish from one of the finer restaurants.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it for my mom's birthday.  I too did not parboil the scallops.  I cut back on the old bay as previously recommended and I used the fresh spinach. This recipe is definately a keeper!!!!

This was Amazing. Our family loved this recipe. Even those who don't like scallops enjoyed it. The key is to get as much moisture out of the scallops and spinach as possible.

This was pretty good. I didn't pre-cook the scallops, the worst thing you can do is over cook those guys and they were perfectly done. I'm going to make some tweeks next time I make them, first I am going to decrease the Old Bay seasoning to 2tsp. I love Old Bay but the dish tasted over seasoned, something many people commented. Second I will drizzle a little butter over the top before baking to ensure the crumb mixture makes a nice crust. Third I think I will try mixing everything but the crust together next time instead of layering to see how that works. All in all though I really enjoyed this recipe.

Oh my gosh! So tasty, so creamy, so cheesy, so good. Easy to do, lots of extras, highly recommend for those who love the sauciness of French food and who enjoy scallops.

I tweeked this recipe quite a bit to fit our taste so with those modifications I would give it five stars. Otherwise I found it a little bland.  I doubled the recipe since we were having guests and added onions and mushrooms (baby portabella's were delicious) to the butter.  I also used fresh steamed spinach, added the juice and zest of a lemon, and chopped a handful of parsley as well and a touch of fresh grated nutmeg to the sauce. I didn't have old bay so I used some garlic salt and ground pepper.  I didn't precook my scallops and also added raw peeled shrimp and cooked for about 25 minutes in a 13x9 pan.  It turned out great, nice crispy topping and good flavor- be careful not to overcook or the seafood will get a little rubbery!

my name is deb so i HAD to try these for my birthday. i did NOT parboil the scallops but took another's advice and just baked for 30 minutes. i found the old bay to be way too salty on the top. i could have done without it. the sauce was supreme and a sprinkle of lemon juice would have completed the taste for me. EXCELLENT recipe!

these turned out great but it was a bit goopy. i added raw oysters and sauteed some sliced mushrooms in garlic to the mix. also added a bit of cream cheese and used shredded asiago and monterey jack (better flavor) and panko bread crumbs.

ate this with a big hunk of warm crusty french bread. BF loved it, but will make smaller portions for the 2 of us in the future. this seems too rich to eat everyday so save it for a special occasion

Wonderful recipe. I left out the cheese used for toppings & used only the parmesan in the sauce & it was plenty rich for me. I mixed dry-squeezed spinach into the sauce, then topped the raw scallops with sauce, breadcrumbs and Emeril's Essence (a fave of mine), then baked the ramekin at 350 for 25 minutes as suggested. Perfectly done (if you are using big scallops). I love the way the juices from scallops are released into the sauce as it cooks & tempers the flavor. Next time, I am going to try baking chicken tenders with this sauce.

This was Great!  Made some modifications based on past reviews & what I had on had.  Left out Old Bay.  Added fresh chives & parsley & garlic salt.  Used 1/2 & 1/2 and made about 1/3 more sauce.  Great consistency.  Steamed fresh spinach & swiss instead of mozzarella.  Thanks Deb for a keeper!

This was a terrible waste of scallops!  It was like eating a bland pudding with scallops.  The combination of heavy cream, melted cheese, and bread crumbs was too overwhelming for scallops.  This dish does nothing to enhance the flavor of the scallop -- you could have used chicken and this would have been the same thing (except that chicken is much cheaper than quality scallops).

A real winner! Delicious even with fat free half and half. Added a few medium cremini mushrooms, whole (for the picky eaters who don't like mushrooms). Good with fresh spinach, too. Left out the Old Bay and sauteed a couple of shallots and 2 cloves garlic minced.

Very good! It was extremely cheesy and creamy, and not overly-fishy. In my opinion, the flavors complimented eachother very well. I used fresh spinach which I tore up by hand (can't stand the frozen stuff). I also used 1/2c of heavy cream, 1/2c of skim milk, and a little more Parmesan cheese. I have to agree that this is close to restaurant quality, and certainly good enough for company. Thanks, Debra!

My wife said these were the best scallops she had ever had.  We had no mozarella around so we decided to use fontina.  I have to say the Fontina was amazing.  I can't imagine this dish using mozarella.  The fontina has so much more flavor and aroma, I would definitely recommend making the change.  We used stoneware to bake this in, and while our dish was warm, it was not all that hot.  I know in our particular cookware, we will cook it for 20 mins next time.

It was great, but I changed a few things.  I added a l cup of cooked rice as the bottom layer.  I also added 1 can of mushrooms with the spinach.  I used milk instead of heavy cream and cornstarch instead of flour to thicken it.  Adding the rice made it a whole meal in itself. It was awesome!

This is a strange recipe.  Way too heavy on the salt.  I'm not sure why it has such high ratings when most people complained about the saltiness.  The recipe as written is almost inedible.  I would skip the salt, skip the layer of parmesan on top (and maybe replace with a softer, less salty cheese that melts better), and reduce the Old Bay seasoning to 1 tsp (or perhaps less, and maybe use some paprika instead for color).  The recipe is a nice idea, it just needs some work.  I will be trying it again since I love scallops and spinach.

Because I try so many recipes, my husband is jaded and not easily impressed.  So when he says he really likes a dish, that is really saying something.  He thought the sauce was great, and liked the idea that it didn’t overpower the scallops.  He’s already requested to have it again.  I should say that I just rinsed the scallops and put them in the baking dish, and covered it with the sauce which I had cooked fresh baby spinach in.  Very simple and easy.  I baked it about 22 minutes.

Outstanding! I used a little bacon to flash fry my seas scallops and then baked them like others suggested. I also lightened up the cream with regular milk. Fresh spinach too.  Other than that I pretty much followed the directions. Everyone loved it on out beach trip!

WOW! Yummy, Delish! Serves six is a lie! My hubby and I ate it all! I didn't pre-boil as many of the reviewers said and baked for 25 minutes. My hubby HATES Parmesan cheese so I left that out. I used fresh spinach which I sauteed and added a can of artichoke hearts (quartered) and left out the bread crumbs and old bay. I put the scallops and artichokes on the bottom, followed by the sauteed spinach and topped it off with the cream sauce(I added a splash of white wine to the sauce)! I served this over pasta! This is a perfect company dinner recipe. Just serve with a salad and some bread followed by dessert! I think this would be a wonderful make ahead dish. If you did this you will need to add some cooking time to compensate for the temperature difference.

I changed a few things, based upon some of the reviews.. one was not cooking the scallops ahead of time. I also used a combo of mozzarella and provolone for the topping. I did not add the spinach and, instead, served it on the side. I also added a TOUCH of Vermouth and a pinch of thyme. I baked it first and then broiled it for about 6-7 minutes until the top browned and let it sit a good 10 minutes before serving. LOVE THIS!

DEEEEE-LICIOUS! Total hit with hubby. As other reviewers suggested, I did not cook my scallops ahead of time. And I used fresh spinach and upped the amount to a whole bag (12 oz i think). Cooked the spinach in the cream sauce, poured it over the scallops and topped with cheese and breadcrumbs. Next time, I think I'll reduce the amount of breadcrumbs. And I cut the mozzarella cheese out too. Didn't miss it a bit. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes and it was perfect. Though I did need to broil it the last 5 to get the top to brown a bit. Thanks Ponygirl for posting!

This was an amazingly simple, quick and easy recipe to make and tasted delicious. My husband thought I slaved for hours. Another idea I used this for was for a cheesy FONDUE dip. I left out the spinach and added sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheese while melting and was a hit! Everyone absolutely loved this!

I read other members' alterations to the recipe, and I took them into consideration when I made this for New Year's eve. I did not pre-cook the scallops, and I used fresh spinach. I replaced the cream with half and half. I removed the mozzarella, replaced plain bread crumbs with Italian ones, and used half of the old bay. Overall, the recipe was very good! The scallops came out perfectly. My only complaint was that between the bread crumbs and the reduced old bay, it was still too salty. I would use half a teaspoon of old bay the next time I make it. But, we really liked this and will be using it with other seafoods in the future.

Loved it! I made a few adjustments as recommended by previous reviews. I didn't pre-cook the scallops and they turned out perfectly. Very tender. I used fresh spinach and salt and pepper only for seasonings.  Finally, I substituted milk for the cream and it was still very rich. This is a quick and super simple dish. nice for a special occasion.

We made this for Valentine's and it was a real hit with both of us!  Instead of spinach, I used fresh swiss chard steamed in the microwave till done.  Then drained and squeezed it out well.  Very delicious, delectable, and delightful!!!

Just made this, had some scallops and was tired of just broiling or baking.  So easy and delicious!  I used 2% milk for the sauce and it came out just fine.
Definitely would make this for a large crowd.

Who would think something so simple could be so good. I used fresh spinach and it was delicious. I would have no fear of frozen though.

This was very good and impressive. A great dish for when you need to make a good impression. I did feel like the parmesan sauce was a little bland so I'll add more seasoning the next time I make it. Thanks for sharing such a beautiful recipe.

Deb, thank you for a brilliant recipe  My husband happened to buy scallops today. I chose this recipe. I did what the other reviewers said by adding a bed of rice and not boil the scallops but cook the casserole longer.   As I am typing this message, my husband said he thinks that it is the best scallop meal he has EVER eaten.    It was fun and easy to make. Since I did not have Old Bay, I used the powdered Mesquite in place of it. But, I love Old Bay, too.   I had asked my husband if we should share the leftovers with our neighbor and he gave a look of horror. He said, "This is one meal I'm not sharing."  Thank you again Deb.

This was excellent! I also used half and half rather than the cream and doubled the sauce recipe. I used a large cast iron pot, made the sauce and stirred fresh baby spinach into it. Then I threw in the scallops and some shrimp, stirred it up, and used Panko bread crumbs and the Old Bay seasoning. Everyone in the family loved it!!

Made this for dinner last night and husband said he definitely wanted me to make them again. I made the following changes. Like other reviewers I did not boil the scallops just baked them for 20 min plus broiling. Also added fresh spinach to the cream sauce instead of frozen and for the topping I only used ritz cracker crumbs and garlic powder.  These were very good.

I consider myself to be a good cook but unfortunately, I rarely get compliments from hubby. He said this was delicious and one of the best dishes I have ever made. I made this for a special New Year's Eve dinner. So, thanks Ponygirl64! Will make again for sure! Was easy and rich and yummy! The only change I made was to cut back on the Old Bay just because of my personal preference.

This recipe needs to be edited. First, you need 1/2 cup parmesan, total. I found this recipe to have too much mozzarella and bread crumbs, I would halve those next time. Also, be careful when you make the cream sauce as it thickens alot sooner than the recipe calls for. Maybe it was because I was using someone else's stove. The sauce should only be slightly thick. Creamy is a better word. Otherwise, the flavor was delish. Oh, and it has to bake for 25-30 mins. as stated at the top of the recipe, not 15 as stated in the actual recipe. Next time I will make these adjustments and also maybe saute the spinach first with some fresh minced garlic.

This was great!  definitely impressed the girls for our girls night dinner.  As some others did, I added about 3/4 lb shrimp.  I also added a bit more Parmesan to the sauce.  I didn't pre-cook the scallops, just put it all in together for 25 min, turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make this again.

Super easy and incredibly tasty! I used monteray jack cheese instead of the mozzarella since I had it on hand. I also omitted the Old Bay seasoning because I've never enjoyed the flavour. I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good & easy. Added a tiny bit extra half & half to cream so it would be enough for pasta. Also added some nutmeg to the cream mixture. Used some piave cheese mixed with packaged mozzarella blend. Cooked a bag of spinach. Did not precook scallops (or shrimp) and they were fine.

I really love this- it is a regular for me..I sometimes lighten it up(for calories sake)using fat free half and half & a little cornstarch too help thicken..This also works wonderfully with haddock or with chicken breasts( I brown them lightly in a pan first)..We like a lot of sauce to serve over rice so sometimes I double..Yum.. Thanks!

Great dish. Followed advise of others and did not boil scallops. I put fresh scallops in bottom of baking dish then topped with Old bay, fresh garlic, fresh baby spinach, some cooked fettuccini then poured the cream sauce over and topped with the cheese.  This is a keeper. Thanks

Excellent dish!  A great way to make scallops, I was craving it again the next day.  Following others instructions, I didn't precook the scallops and they came out perfect. I made it with fresh spinach.  Will use baby spinach next time.

First of all - I heavily edited the dish.  I wanted to make shrimp florentine with pasta.  I used FRESH spinach (wilted in a pan and drained in a sieve while I made the rest of the dish).  A good Florentine dish tastes best with fresh spinach!  I boiled a pot of ziti pasta... doubled the sauce and sauteed shrimp.  I layered the ingredients in a baking dish as follows:  pasta, spinach, shrimp, sauce, breadcrumbs/parmesan, ending with mozzarella.  Due to time constraints I decided to broil the dish for 2-3 minutes instead of baking.  This was very tasty but a little bland even though I used plenty of salt/pepper.  I felt it needed just a little more umph - so perhaps some garlic and a pinch of chili powder or red pepper flakes may have made a difference.  Overall it was tasty and my kids loved it too - but the sauce could use a few minor improvements!

I was very excited about this recipe, and unfortunately it just wasn't that good.  The white sauce was very heavy (I used fat free half and half) and was missing a "something."  I also thought the bread crumbs were too much.  I won't be making this again.

I absolutely loved this scallop recipe.  I got tired of the typical sauteed with butter and garlic.  This was outstanding.  I didn't pre boil the scallops as recommended by prior reviewers and did add sauteed onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I served it on top of white rice and it was delicious.
Thanks Deb for a superb recipe!!

I made this recipe for my husband on his birthday and he said it was the best scallop recipe of all time.  I added shrimp for a little extra flavor and omitted the Old Bay because I don't have it.  He is already asking when I will make it again!

This turned out EXCELLENT! Every other bite, my boyfriend looked up at me, pointed to the scallops with his fork and made "MMMmmmMMMM" sounds. I doubled the sauce, and added 1/2 lb of shrimp to the recipe. Next time I will try serving it over some baked spaghetti squash. Easy to make, and tastes like something that would be served at a restaurant. I give this recipe 6 stars!

I made this for my husbands bday. Everyone loved it {2 kids included ages 5 and 3 ) I added sliced mushrooms and minced garlic and a little minced onion and I made it with chicken and shrimp.  Next time I think I will make a little more of the sauce. Served with a cesear salad and bread. Will defenitely make it again. Thanks Deb!

I used a pound of scallops, a pound of shrimp, and doubled the sauce. I also skipped the bay seasoning. I read through the other reviews before making, and even though everyone said to leave out the mozarella, I really love cheese so I sprinkled some on anyways. A cup of cooked jasmine rice was also added under the scallops and shrimp. Will make again, but with even more spinach.

Very Very good.  I will make this again.  After reading so many reviews i did not boil the scallops first BIG MISTAKE i used the large sea scallops and it ended up taking 45 minutes in the oven.  I also had to thin the sauce a bit it was to thick for my taste.  

I used a bit of old bay seasoning and added some lemon zest powder.  It was FANTASTIC.

Overall... this is great, so simple it can be made ahead of time and popped into the oven when your guest arrive.  The kitchen was spotless when my guests came. i served it with Caesar salad and baked potato.  My kitchen looked like i had dinner catered.

Thought i would update this.. i served this a second time as an appetizer it was the talk of the entire party.  It was the first dish to go.  I will make this over and over.

I thought this recipe was way too much...too thick, and way too rich not to mention bland.  I also thought it was a waste of expensive scallops.  Perhaps chicken would be a better choice.  I realize it got high marks from many others, but I do not recommend it.  I;ll stick to my bacon wrapped recipe.  Sorry.

Very good, don't cook scallops first and take extra time to pat them dry or they make the finished dish too watery.  I steamed fresh spinach and added one half teaspoon garlic powder to sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good and very rich. Didn't add the Old Bay, I don't think they needed it. I envision using this recipe with spinach-stuffed chicken... Very goo.

Wow, this was amazing!  I'm going to make it again with chicken just to save a little money, but the scallops were perfect.  I didn't boil the scallops first, either, and didn't use Old Bay. Thank you, Deb!

This was excellent and so easy to make. I didnt make mine in a pie dish, instead I used a small casserole dish.  I did boil my scallops as per the recipe but dont think that it is necessary.  After I patted my scallops dry, I seasoned them with a little garlic powder. I also increased my spinach from 10 oz to about 14 oz and thought that was perfect.  Such a great meal and both my husband and daughter loved it.  Next time I will use fat free half and half. I served mine w/ brown rice and corn.

Very easy and super Yummm! I think next time I would double the sauce just to have more on the side. (more calories!!)I would also reduce the Old Bay to taste as it was a bit strong for me. I didn't have cream so used 1/2 & 1/2...worked great.  I will make this again and again! Thanks!

Oh my!  This was wonderful. I love to try new recipes and have them taste as good as they sound.  My husband and me so enjoyed the delicate flavors.  I did change a few things. I didn't precook the scallops.  I did use fresh spinach(I parcooked that though very lightly), for the last step I took the parm. cheese, bread crumbs and old bay and mixed it all together and then put that on top of the scallps.  It was so good.  I will be making this again!  I have told everyone how good a cook I was this night!  lol

I love scallops but get tired of them with garlic and butter.  This sounded really yummy, but mine turned out pretty bland.  I followed the recipe, but I used 2% milk instead of cream - I don't think that was the problem - it just needed more flavor.

This recipe ROCKS!  I've done it with both bay and sea scallops.  Only complaint is the serving size - one lb. barely feeds two.  Plan on serving a nice salad and some garlic bread, or double the recipe.  I too use croutons on top.  Love it!

I used half and half instead of heavy cream and omitted the mozzarella, it is rich enough without it. I thought it was delicious.

Loved this recipe, with modifications! I put fresh sea scallops in the bottom of the pie plate, skipping the boiling step.  Making the sauce according to directions, I added fresh baby spinach to the sauce at the end and cooked about one minute before placing on the scallops.  For the topping I sprinkled on about four crushed Ritz crackers and additonal parmesan. Served with baked sweet potatoes, it was a quick, colorful, delicious meal.

This was very rich and heavy.  As other viewers suggested I omitted the mozarella and the Old Bay.  Good, but not something I would make on a regular basis.  Too filling for my tastes.

Tasty and easy.  I basically followed the directions with a few minor changes.  I increased the sauce by half, using whole milk rather than heavy cream.  I added 1 t. Old Bay Seasoning to the sauce (rather than sprinkling on top) and used only 1/2 c. mozzarella cheese.  Next time I'll add 1/8 t. nutmeg to the sauce as well; it's a great complement for spinach.  Served it with shell pasta.

I liked this, accept next time I'm going to figure a way to make the cream sauce lighter- although delicious, it gave me indigestion b/c it was just too heavy.  I also chose not to blanch the scallops first, and instead baked the dish longer.

Delicious!! Followed the recipe to the "T" (including boiling the scallops)and just changed the amount of topping indredients. I just sprinkled the cheeses, breadcrumbs and oldbay to taste and it came out very good!(Wasn't too salty at all) Next time I think I will omit the mozzarella all together and mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese and old bay (about 1/2tbs) together, top with the breadcrumb "mixture" then drizzle a little olive oil. This is a very good recipe and with these changes could be GREAT! VERY rich and delicious dish! :)

Oh my goodness!  The look on my husband's face after his first taste of this was priceless.  You would have thought he had just won the lottery.  This recipe was awesome!  I used fat free half and half and light butter.  I also sauteed a little bit of chopped garlic in with the flour and butter mixture.  It was truly one of the best dishes I have made and I have been cooking a long time.

Excellent. I skipped the boiling step and baked for 25 minutes. I also used light cream and an Italian blend of cheeses(pre-packaged)instead of mozzarella. Very easy and very good. Thanks Deb!

My husband and I both enjoyed this dinner.  I did boil the scallops and they turned out perfect.  I won't use the mozzerella cheese next time, we found they got too lumpy on top.  We picked it off.  I would also follow this recipe and add it on top of pasta.  This is worth trying!

This was a very rich recipe. I used light cream and it still came out rich and flavorful. It looked so good coming out of the oven that I spooned up quite a helping for myself, but had to put some back due to it's filling power. The sauce is so creamy and the spinach compliments it really well.

This was a great recipe.  I will try half and half next time as many reviewers have suggested.  Also, I was a numbskull and used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of Old Bay (I hadn't ever heard of Old Bay).  Any way, it was a bit too salty and I'll definitely eliminate the seasoning next time.  Great recipe Deb and I'll definitely make this again!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, though we both agreed it was way to salty.  Will make again just not with the salt.

My husband LOVED this dish, so it gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me!  Advice I took from other reviews: no parboiling the scallops; steamed fresh baby spinach instead of frozen; and no Old Bay, just a little salt and pepper.   Baked at 375 for 20, broiled for about 5—perfectly cooked.  I’ll make this again.

I've never used Old Bay Seasoning before and now that I've used it, I would halve the amount the recipe suggests.  This was too salty a dish - already large amounts of salt in the other ingredients but I would still use the Old Bay.  Otherwise this was a very tasty rich dish

Doubled recipe. Cooked 3/4 bag fresh spinach in cream mixture. Next time would use more. Semi thawed 2 bags frozen scallops and baked for 30 minutes. Cut down Old Bay - might cut down further.  Crushed garlic in sauce.

Great and easy dish! I used fresh spinach as someone else had suggested and cut back a bit of the mozzarella cheese.  I also didn’t cook the scallops and added shrimp, both cooked with the other ingredients in the oven for 25mins.  It was a hit!

It is a great recipe! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. For the scallops! You really have to pull off the muscles that are attached to them before cooking. I did bring a pot of water to a full boil then pull pan off the heat and let scallops cook in heated water off the heat. Perfect. I made the sauce like I always do for alfredo sauce. Omit the salt for that. I did save 8 oz's of the water that scallops were cooked in. When the sauce was thickened I added some of the scalloped flavored water. Not a lot but just enough. I greased the baking dish with butter. Put a layer of Spinach on the bottom. Put Scallops in the middle and another layer of spinach on top. Finished as the recipe stated. Bread Crumbs, both cheese's and Old Bay seasoning. It came out great. I cooked linguine to make a perfect dish. If you use unsalted butter! Add some salt. If you use salted butter, omit the salt. I did use Heavy Cream. From a true New Englander.

This was great! My only word of warning (don't do as I did) is to remember that Old Bay has salt in it, so you really don't need to add any to the cream sauce. Mine was just a bit too salty as a result of my forgetting that. Otherwise, this was delicious!

I asked my husband to rate this dish out of 5 stars and he said, "oh! Definitely 5 stars! This is the best dish you've made in 12 years. I would have paid $50 for this in a restaurant." I tweaked a bit by using large scallops and shrimp & fresh spinach (cooked in the sauce). Added a little more Parmesan and omitted the mozzarella. Instead of plain bread crumbs I used a packet of Old Bay Crab Cake mix since it's mainly bread crumbs and seasoning. Then topped w a little more traditional Old Bay. Cooked for 10 mins then broiled for 5 mins. This is my favorite recipe in AR!!

Made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS! Didn't use any of the last four ingredients, just because we didn't think it needed them. (Correct!) We did use fresh spinach and added some shrimp because the boys wanted the extra protein. This is definitely going to be a "go to" recipe at our house because these are ingredients I almost always keep in stock.

FYI: Served with roasted asparagus on the side. Yum!

Absolutely delicious! And so easy my nine-year-old son did 90% of it himself. Kids didn't like the scallops as much as I hoped, so next time we will try with shrimp.I didn't have heavy cream so I used about 2 tablespoons of ricotta cheese mixed with one cup of milk. I accidentally mixed the grated cheese into the milk mixture before sautéd it, but it came out fine, so we just sprinkled a little extra grated cheese on the top when we baked it. We also forgot to add the flour, so when it didn't pick it up and I realized it, I had a just a little bit of cornstarch and that were just fine. Highly flexible recipe as you can see :)

I did not care for this recipe. The cheese took far more than the recommended 15 minutes (more like 25) to melt and all it was, was salty.  It would definately need more seasoning o some kind.  Would not it make it again.

I use bay scallops and I don't cook it before hand. I follow the basic recipe with a few changes every time. My biggest issue is that the fresh spinach and scallops release a lot of water so the end product separates out. So I just drain it and it's still delicous, just need to figure out a way to stop that from happening.

Oh my god amazing!
 I made this for my boyfriend for dinner and we both LOVED it. I'm not the most experienced cook, but it was very easy with simple ingredients that made it full of flavor.
I recommend using fresh Italian mozzarella (I used Bel Gioioso brand from Publix. They come pre-sliced and I placed them on top before the crumbs. Delicious!)
Also, I used fresh Spinach instead of the frozen kind. Definitely made a difference.
I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Oh my, these are good!  I prefer bay scallops and often add small to medium shrimp to the dish - I have never been dissapointed.  I also generally use half and half to save a few calories.  A nice salad with a light dressing on the side usually makes the guilt go away.  Thanks for the recipe.

Like everyone else, I had to fiddle with this recipe (don't we all in one way or another) because I prefer garlic to old bay.  After a trip to the farmer's market, I ended up using fresh spinach as well as asparagus tips just because I had them.  I had garlic-spinach fettuccine with this to round out the meal.  Delicious!  Thank you so much for this!

Incredible!
I made this for our anniversary dinner- (a pound of sea scallops is outside of my normal dinner price range!) and I added shrimp as others had suggested.

Served with rice and a good champagne- perfect!

My husband loved it - kids liked it too. I'd go heavier on the Old bay next time - add some to the cream sauce. Served it over rice.

I'm one of those folks that changes the recipe around , which is why I gave this one four stars.  I cooked the spinach in the cream and cheese, added some tomatoes roasted in olive oil, salt,  amd garlic.  I omitted the breadcrumbs, seasoning and mozzerella, too much for my taste.

Not only did I think this recipe was amazing, but so did both my parents!  I followed the direction of others and didn't boil the scallops before putting the scallops in the baking dish...this made for a longer baking time.  In order to save some calories I used fat free half and half which worked beautifully.  I also used some skim mozzerella when making the cheese sauce along with the required parmesean.  I served this over angel hair pasta with a side of garlic bread!  Leftovers the next day were just as good if not better!!  can't wait to make again for Mother's Day!

This was really good!  I did make my own adjustments though.  I took the advice of others and did not poach the scallops, just put them in the sauce and cooked for 25minutes.   I also combined half shrimp and half scallops.  I used Asiago  cheese as that is our preference rather than the Parmesan cheese.  I left out the mozerella this time but I think I will try it next time around.   I also used fresh spinach since I never buy frozen.     I added some chopped brown mushrooms and artichoke hearts.  I omitted the old bay and instead used some garlic, onion, pepper and salt as well as a tiny dash of paprika and the dish came out beautifully!  even my daughter who says she hates mushrooms AND cooked spinach all the time said she loved it.   I will be making this again this Sunday with the mozerella cheese added and see which we prefer.  I served this over a bed of penne pasta.Thanks for a great recipe!

not my favorite -- very heavy.  Used fresh shrimp and scallops.  Went lighter on the Old Bay.  Still--seems to thicken quick as it cools on your plate.

This recipe was quite good.  I followed the directions to a T, and the only problem I had was that the amount of Old Bay was positively overpowering.  I'll either use just a sprinkling, or omit it altogether next time.  Other than that, it was absolutely delicious.

Here's what I did differently: used bay scallops, did not precook scallops, added 2 minced garlic cloves while melting the butter, omitted old bay seasoning, and broiled a few minutes at the end to brown the Italian-style breadcrumb topping. Husband and I loved it so much we're gonna make it again but with chicken, maybe shrimp. I might use corn starch next time to thicken the sauce just a bit, and I will definitely use fresh spinach. Getting the frozen spinach ready was a pain, and messy! Oh yeah, and finally I'll add sliced mushrooms to make it perrrrfect.

Very good flavor, tasty and creamy. The only thing I thought was that it needs something more, I served it on top of vermicelli which turned it in to a more complete meal, it would probably be good on rice as well.

I thought this was missing something. Too bland for us and not enough substance. I thought it would have been better if it had a little pasta mixed in??  I will try playing around with this recipe next time..just ok for us..

My husband doesn't care for bread crumb topping so I eliminated this.  I substituted the fresh spinach for the frozen, wilted it first in evoo and garlic.  I also added shrimp, but it really didn't need it.  Wonderful scallop recipe for people who don't normally eat scallops.

This was a wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I steamed fresh spinach which I think made the sauce a little watery.  I made it for Valentines Day dinner for my husband, and my son.  My son didn't care for the spinach (but what 7 year old do), but my husband loved it and helped himself to 2 servings! I'm making this again in a few weeks for a few friends.

Good, but the original is heavy on the cream and calories. I cooked baby bella mushrooms in margarine, then added a little flour 2% milk and a couple tablespoons of pecorino romano cheese. Also good tips on not pre-cooking scallops. Still, a good idea made better, and new twist on oysters rockefeller.  Next time, will add shrimp.

I don't know what happened with the sauce, but after I added the 1/2 and 1/2 then the cheese, it turned into a gloppy, pasty, tasteless mess.  I cook a LOT and couldn't even rescue this.  After deciding weather to try my hand at another sauce or bag it and go to a different recipe, I tossed everything in the trash and did a basic Scampi.  In theory, it sounded good (sans mozzerella).  In reality, that sauce was going to ruin my scallops!

This is so good. One warning though. It is very heavy. A little bit on your plate takes you a very long way..  I tripled the recipe and ended up making way to much.. I froze one portion of it that was not baked.  GREAT holiday recipe!  thanks Deb!

Very good recipe.  I also used fresh spinach and it turned out great.  The only drawback was that it was a little salty for my taste.  Not sure if the combinations of Old Bay and cheeses contributed to that or not.

rated a 4, because i don't think parboiling the scallops is such a good idea. you can just cook for 5-10 minutes longer with much less effort! I've made this recipe a few times. My substitutions are to add a couple dashes of garlic salt, instead of salt; and to then use grated gruyere, instead of the mozzarella. thanks for the recipe, deb!

I am an experiences cook and I made it exactly as described and it was just not good. Everything in the recipe seems like it would be great when combined, but it just doesn't meld together at all. Maybe if mixed scallops in sauce w/spinach..I'm not sure but this version just lacks flavor and a decent texture.

I really like all the ingredients listed in the recipe, and after reading all the rave reviews, I was so looking forward to trying this recipe. My sweetie really loves both scallops and spinach and I had high hopes this would make a special dinner.  However, for us,it was a disappointment. It is not a flavor combination that worked well as we felt it was bland and the texture unappealing. It was worth a try though and based on other reviews, I wouldn't discourage anyone.

This recipe was excellent! As suggested by the other reviewers, I did not pre-cook the scallops and I cooked the dish for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes. I also used 10% cream to make it a lighter version. I did not have Old Bay seasoning, so I used seafood seasoning directly on the scallops and on top of the bread crumbs. Instead of the mozzarella cheese, I used old cheddar chesse.  The result was amazing !

This is a great recipe!  I've been using this site for the past few years, and haven't really found a recipe that really "wow"ed me until Deb's Scallops! I did make them with a bit less fat, by using skim milk in the sauce, instead of heavy cream.  Couldn't get any taste from the s/p, so I added Old Bay to sauce too.  Fantastic!!

This recipe was awesome.  I haven’t made scallops before and finally tried with this.  I think the next time I will opt not to boil the scallops some ended up a little rubbery.  I added more cheese but, only used half and half instead of heavy cream. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I will be making this again.

Very good and very rich. I didn't pre-boil the scallops, patted them dry and seasoned them with salt and garlic powder. Baked it a bit longer than 15 min. Omitted the bay seasoning and added fresh basil, parsley, chives and garlic powder for a more Italian flavor. 2 T of butter may be enough for the roux. All in all an enjoyable dish.

Didn't add the old bay seasoning - we didn't miss it either.  The sauce is thick and very rich - my boys loved it.  The scallops were well hidden - so I didn't have to explain the fish to the kids.  They ate it and asked questions later - very good.  A little bit goes a long way in the satisfaction department.  I did go the lowfat route where possible - it still was great.

Very simple. I didn't precook the scallops, as readers suggested, & they were perfectly cooked after 25 minutes in the oven. Really cheesy & tasty.

This recipe was really good.  I skipped the boiling because I was afraid they would be overdone.  They came out perfect.  I had some extra grated swiss cheese in the refrigerator so I used that and cut back on the mozarella.  It was very good.

A very classic flavor and look! But alas, it's a heart attack on a plate. I wouldn't have it too often, but as a special treat for guests, it truly looks nice. I'd like to sauce to be just a bit lighter.

TEN STARS!!!!  Absolutely spectacular!  This is a meal you would be proud to serve to company.  I skipped Step Two and the result was still fabulous.  I used Trader Joe's sea scallops which are so fresh and delicious....A perfect "early" Valentine's Day dinner for my husband.

wow.... it's my honor to toss another 5 stars in deb's way with no problems! i followed this recipe as written with the exception of using frozen whole spinach leaves (which i will never do again). the heavy cream is necessary to make the wonderful cheese sauce. don't add extra bread crumbs  or overcook this dish or you'll lose the creamy texture. way to go, deb! thanks a bunch!

Let me start with - I don't care for seafood, my children don't like seafood, and they HATE spinach.


With that said - we all had seconds! 

An easy and tasty recipe.

Absolutely wonderful.  Unlike some reviewers, I did precook the scallops. I varied from the recipe in two ways:  (1) Since some reviewers criticized the recipe for having too much mozzarella cheese, I used a Kraft shredded mix of mozzarella with other Italian cheeses instead.  (2) Could not find Old Bay, so used Paul P's seafood seasoning instead.   Will definitely make again.

AWESOME!!!!!!!!  This was my favorite Allrecipes recipe yet.  I took advice from other reviews and didn't boil the scallops first.  I baked for 23 min and everything was perfect.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add extra salt and I didn't add Old Bay. I also cut the spinach in half as I am not crazy about cooked spinach.  Although, I must say the spinach gave it just the right touch.  I  sprinkled the top with a little paprika.  I read other reviews about how people substituted the heavy cream with half and half or milk.  I just don't know if I'd like it that way.  I think it might take away from the "richness" of the recipe.  It was so delicious with the heavy cream.  Thanks for the recipe Deb! 
Update - I now use fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen. The fresh spinach is less over powering.

Excellent!  I also, as previously mentioned, left out boiling the scallops prior to baking.  I just cooked everything a little longer (about 30 min) I also left out the Old Bay seasoning - didn't have any.  I served over pasta.  Very good and easy to make!!

What a wonderful recipe and easy!!  I took the advice and didn't parboil the scallops and baked for 20-25 min.  I also didn't use Old Bay because I didn't have any.  It came out great!!

Wow this was fantastic!  I made this as part of our Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it.  I didn't use mozzarella cheese, just extra parmesan; also I skipped the Old Bay.  It was very tasty and I will definitely make it again.  Oh yes I also followed other readers' advice and skipped the pre-cooking of the scallops.  They were cooked enough for us this way and nothing's worse than overcooked fish!  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was GREAT!!! My father didn't stop raving about it for a while.  The scallops were soooo wonderful, they melted in your mouth.  I followed all of the recipe instructions and it was just perfect.  This is so rich and delicious, don't  eat too much!!!

This dish was easy even though there were several steps.  My friends were very impressed and we all thought it was delicious.  I am actually going to cook it for extended family because I am certain of the outcome!

Better than any seafood casserole I've ever had anywhere!  I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup of half n half.  I also used about a half cup mozzarella and a little more parmesan than called for.  Absolutely a delicious recipe!
