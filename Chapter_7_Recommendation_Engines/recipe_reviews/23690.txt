I used bowtie pasta, browned the bacon, browned the sausage and ground beef together and sprinkled with mozarella cheese. Wouldn't add as much sugar next time.

This was a very good meal.  We substituted the sugar, canned tomatoes and can of tomato sauce for two 28 oz jars of Paul Newman spaghetti sauce and also used one 16 oz package of Spaghettini instead of 12 oz. We also subsituted Jimmy Dean Hickory Smoked Pork Sausage for the Italian Sausage since we had it on hand.  This meal had alot of flavor and was very tastey.  Since we used ready made spaghetti sauce we lowerd the simmer time to about 15 mins before backing for 30 mins.  Total prep and cook time was less than an hour.

I made this to appease the meat lovers in my family.  To lower the fat content I used ground chuck, turkey Italian sausage, and reduced fat bacon.  2 tablespoons of diced onion sauteed with meat.  I did precook the bacon, but not to a crispy state.  I used fire-roasted tomatoes, and a thicker tomato sauce.  Sugar was reduced significantly with no detriment to outcome.  Followed cooking times and temps to the letter.  I received many compliments on this dish.  Personally, I felt the bacon flavor was more powerful than it should be.  Still, I had a second helping.  I am looking forward to my leftovers!

I used canned roasted garlic tomatoes and it basically did the seasoning for me. My picky boyfriend even liked it, but we both agreed that it could have used more of the tomaote/meat mix. I didn't even use all the noodles. Next time I will add more bacon and sausage, and maybe more sauce. I made german runzas for a side and it was a great dinner.

I did not have any sausage so I used more bacon. The bacon never crisped up but the bacon gave a great flavor to the dish while it was cooking, so I don't know if it would be better cooking it with the beef or the sausage. My husband was skeptical but he had seconds. Will definitely try again.

This had kind of a peculiar vinegary/sugar/bacon flavor.  I don't know if i'll make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly, despite feeling like there were some obvious steps missing; such as when and if to chop the sausage and bacon. The sausage was easy enough to chop before serving, but not so the bacon. Some people ended up with a whole slice of bacon in their meal. Next time I will cook the bacon a little first, just to cook off some of the grease, chop it and then add it when the recipe calls for it. I'd still leave it very soft though because the bacon flavour it adds to the dish is wonderful. I thought of maybe taking the casings off the sausage and breaking it up like ground beef, but having the slices of sausage was very nice. This was a very nice change from regular spaghetti and everyone loved it. I'll definitely make it again. Second time making it - I felt like there was too much sugar, perhaps because I used a ready made spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Add sugar to taste if using a spaghetti sauce

This was FABULOUS!  Easily prepared with ingredients most of us happen to have sitting around the house.  Easily customizable for different serving sizes.  

I admit, I was a bit light on the sugar (only a few tablespoons) and I did add some garlic and onion to the meat I was making it, but still a wonderful easy recipe.

Make this all the time as a side dish using a pound of fried and chopped bacon as the only meat, and adding it in right before serving. Following the rest of the recipe.

Great dish! Very sweet. To cut back on calories I used 93/7 ground beef, reduced fat bacon, and 1/5 lb. turkey Italian sausage. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. To add some more dimension to the flavor I added 1 tbsp of minced onions and 1 tbsp herbes de Provence. Delicious!

Didn’t understand why it was necessary to separately brown the sausage and ground beef?  I removed the casing on the links and browned the sausage (hot Italian links) with the ground beef.  I also chopped the bacon and cooked it along with the sausage-ground beef mixture.  This recipe calls for a fair amount of bacon, and if you add it along with the tomato products, you’ll not have a chance to drain off the bacon grease, ending up with sauce that is unnecessarily greasy.  I did drain the canned tomatoes, reserving the liquid, but added  it back (needed it) to the sauce which I simmered for about 20 minutes. I was concerned about the amount of sugar, so I cut that way back (personal taste preference) and added salt and pepper.  I liked the flavor that the bacon added to the sauce, but it was just a bit too dominant, so I would reduce the amount of bacon next time.  I baked in individual casseroles for 20 minutes, and it dried out.  IMO baking lends nothing to this recipe, so I will just mix and serve in the future.  This ended up tasting pretty good, my apologies for the long review.  My rating is based solely on taste.

This was very "lunch lady". Maybe it would be better without the sugar, but it did not go over well with my pasta lovers.

There is nothing German about this. Used Chorizo instead of italian sausage, added garlic powder and Italian seasonong, used penne instead of spaghetti, omitted sugar as there is sugar in pretty much everything now. Coated in Mozzarella before baking. Easy recipe that can feed an army for cheap.
