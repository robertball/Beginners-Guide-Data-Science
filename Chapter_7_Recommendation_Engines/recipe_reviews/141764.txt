Loved it! I Added a red bell pepper, since I had one in the fridge that I needed to use before it turned. Didn't add the okra (didn't have any, and we don't really like it anyhow), a can of petite diced tomatoes (made for a great sauce) and used Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage links since it was what I had on hand. This was delicious, quick and easy, and will certainly be on our regular rotation. :)

Very good! I used the recipe for a great springboard, & tweaked it just a bit (as we cooks will do!). I browned the hot Italian sausage first, then crumbled. I tripled all the veggies, added mushrooms, used only half the sausage stated (just wanted the taste), & added Tony Cachere's to the seasonings. Put it all in the crockpot, & let it cook on low for 6-7 hours. Delicious!!! Oh, I also doubled the brown rice portion & added that to the crockpot with everything else.  At the very end, I stirred in about 1-2 teaspoons of file' powder.  OMG! What a fantastic meal!!!  I realize it sounds as if I made a lot of changes, but really it was just playing with proportions rather than the actual ingredients. Great budget recipe - I end up with about twelve 1-1/2 cups servings for around $7! It also freezes beautifully & reheats extremely well. So, 5-stars for all those things!

I made this because sausage was the only meat I had on hand (it did happen to be Bob Evans).  I followed the recipe pretty much but didn't have celery on hand so I used a small can (4 oz) of mile green chiles (just because I did have them on hand).  Because I used the mild chiles I didn't add hot sauce.  I did have frozen okra and did use it in the recipe but only put in about 1/2 of the amount shown.  I just felt that much okra would overpower the rice.

Easy, easy, easy! My 18 year old niece and I made this together trying to create a meal out of the slim pickins' in the cuboard. I didn't add the okra (didn't have it) but did add a can of beans. Everyone loved it and it sure didn't taste like an end of the month, scrape it together dinner! Thanks, this is a keeper in our house!

Yummy recipe!  I am not normally a huge fan of jambalaya, but the Italian sausage made this a big hit!  I didn't have any okra (and I don't think my kids would eat it anyway) so instead I subbed half a red pepper and half a yellow one.  Also used diced tomatoes with green chilis, which were awesome for this! The seasonings were perfect (I didn't feel the need to add anything, which is rare) and I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! I didn't use the Bob Evans brand sausage either because the store I stopped at didn't have it. I did use hot italian sausage for a "kick," and I'm glad I did, because I think it really pulled the whole dish together. This is a keeper for sure.

This is OK for a skillet meal. If I ever make it again, I will cook the sausage through in the skillet before adding the other ingredients. I had to cook the jambalaya for over an hour, and the rice got overcooked.

This was very tasty and very easy to make.  I have to confess that I did not use Bob Evans sausage, just some other random brand.  I left out the okra and didn't miss it at all.  I suggest that the sausage casings be removed before cooking.  I also had to add a little bit of olive oil to the sausage, onion and celery so that the veggies would not burn.

Very tasty and simple to prepare.  I used hot Italian poultry sausage and brown rice. I will make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised how good this came out. I did everything by the recipe, but just approximated the sausage (whatever brand I had around), and added a little extra rice and a whole can of chicken broth. Because the okra was fresh, i cooked everything a little bit before i added the rice. I really think you can't mess this one up. Will definitely make again.

This was VERY good, and very easy to make. I didn't have okra or celery, so just left it out. I used organic chicken sausage and brown rice also. My husband loved it!

This dish was really good! I made a couple of simple changes to suit my family's taste.  -I used turkey sausage to cut down the fat and calories. You can get italian turkey sausage at most stores. -I added 2 cups of rice instead of 1/2 cup and doubled the amount of broth. -I didn't put any okra in. -I tripled the amount of hotsauce and used a tsp of crushed chilis too  It turned out great, a full meal and nice and spicy like we like.

this was very goood, I added two cloves of minced garlic, I used about a cup instead of 1/2 a cup of onion and celery, and I soaked the rice in the chicken broth while I browned the sausage.  I used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce (simply because I didn't have hot sauce) and my husband and I both mowed it down.  Very very good indeed, I will definitely be making this again.  I recommend it for a quick filling meal.

I didn't have the okra or celery, so I added some chopped bell pepper instead.  I made it with brown rice (which took longer to cook than the white, I believe, so it was a little al dente) and I used turkey Italian sausage (making it the most healthy I could).  I liked this recipe and will make it again, and next time I will soak the brown rice before adding it to the pan so it will be a little softer.  Very tasty!

I added just what the recipe called for in terms of hot sauce to make this more kid friendly.  Personally, I could make it with a lot more, maybe even double.  Very hearty and yummy.  A perfect comfort food.

I enjoyed this. But it's closer to a gumbo than a jambalaya. (Picky, picky...)

This was really tasty! I used Johnsonville hot italian sausage and the same ingredients below. (except I used Tomatoes with green chiles) And I only have 5 minute rice on hand, so I cooked that separately with the chicken broth instead of water. Then, added that to the simmering tomatoes mix during the last 5 minutes of simmering...stirred it up and was super yummy! Thanks!

This was fantastic! I didn't have okra on hand and used brown rice. I had to add a little more chicken stock and let it cook a bit longer but it came out perfectly. My husband said that it was the best meal he'd had in a while.

not crazy about this one.  used frozen spinach instead of okra.  I don't know if it was the seasonings or what, but the sausage was the only good part.
