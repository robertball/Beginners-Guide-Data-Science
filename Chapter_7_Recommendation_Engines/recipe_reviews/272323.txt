Yummy. I used pepper jack too. I also chopped up rotisserie chicken dark meat instead of frying up a breast and added the chili pepper to the pot.  I added an onion and some canned corn.

Full of flavor. This turned out way better than I thought it would. I added jalapenos  instead of got sauce.  My kids really liked it too.

This was good but here is a different twist on it.  With the left overs, we used  low carb wheat tortillas and made  burritos and put a little sour cream and salsa on top.  they were unbelievably good.

I made it. The changes made I used the Morningstar chicken strips 3 bags substituting coconut milk for the heavy cream. I also used cheese mozzarella style by daiya. Turned out great!

This was great!  I used leftover shredded rotisserie chicken and Pepper Jack cheese.  Pretty spicy, but delish!

I wouldnt call it chili but its great and very rich. I will add some mushrooms next time just because. Most of my keto dishes are tomato base some this was a nice switch. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe is amazing, I made a few tweaks because was in a hurry. I boiled the chicken and then shredded it. I added 2 Tbs of cumin, because I really like cumin. and used 2 7oz jars of green chilis because I really like them also. 2 cups of shredded pepper Jack, the pre shredded was in a 2 cup bag, so I used the whole thing. I will be making this many time to come.

Delicious and easy to make! I like to use my stand mixer to shred the chicken (so easy and can be done while the chicken is still hot). I would be curious how this would taste with some white beans.
