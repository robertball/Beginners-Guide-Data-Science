Can I give this 10 stars???  Never thought of using green chile on grilled cheese.  And since I am too lazy to chop green chiles and I hate the canned ones, do yourself a favor and get the Bueno (I think that's the brand) fire-roasted green chiles in the freezer section.  Comes in a tub.

A Classic!! I grew up in Arizona, and we ordered these at the A&W Root Beer Stand.  Try using Montery Jack cheese, also.  Yummy

Made these into Paninis and added fresh sliced mushrooms and deli turkey.  Very good.  I will always add green chiles to my grilled cheese and paninis.

I made mine using  fresh whole wheat sourdough bread, lacey swiss and colby cheese and white american. I found some tasty chopped green chilies in the can from Trader Joes that I use. A great simple twist to a classic sandwich.

We have always been fans of green chilie's.  I never put the two together.  Glad that I saw this because it was fantastic!

I've made these twice and they were great. Last night I was going to make them but was out of bread. Substituted flour tortillas and they were just as good.

I haven't tried this recipe, but I LOVE green chile on my grilled cheese.  It's definitely best with fresh green chile, but I've used frozen, too.  Never the canned; it doesn't taste the same.  I heat my chile in a pan before adding it, add grilled tomatoes, and double the cheese.  Delish!

I love cheese sandwiches. And this take on a grilled cheese sandwich has definitely upped my love for it!. It's delicious, great for breakfast, and loved by one and all. I made two changes, the first was to use freshly chopped green chillis (i sprinkled just about 1/2 - 1 tsp of it per sandwich) coz I didn't have canned chillis on hand. And I also added a sprinkling of finely chopped red onions. Definitely a keeper! :D Thank you Emily! :)

I put mayo and spicy mustard on these as well with whole green chilis and turkey slices. They are really really good.

This was decent, but I think it really needs something else. The green chilis have a flavor that just doesn't seem all that great by itself. I think the addition of sliced tomatoes would perk this up a little bit, or maybe even a sprinkling of garlic salt. Thanks for the quick, light dinner though! :)

This becomes delicious when you add thinly sliced tomatoes to the sandwich. You can also serve this open faced, and grilled under the broiler.

Good sandwich! I used Velveeta cheese instead of American cheese slices; I also put just a little diced onions on top of the green chilies.

Excellent twist to traditional grilled cheese! I recommend using sourdough bread. If you really want to heat things up, use 1/2 monterey jack, 1/2 cheddar cheese.

This was good, but I couldn't really taste the green chilies.  It tasted like regular grilled cheese to me.
