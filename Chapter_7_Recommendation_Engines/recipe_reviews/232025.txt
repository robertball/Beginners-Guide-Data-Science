This is exactly how my father in law made eggs. He always told me that the key to good eggs is wisking the egg-milk mixture until it's frothy. He didn't cook his in olive oil, it was either a hunk of butter or a hunk of bacon grease. He also told me that you had to keep eggs moving in the skillet to prevent scorching. This is still my go-to quick scrambled egg recipe.

I read this recipe and thought, surely the author does not mean 2 eggs for 7 Tablespoons of milk.  (7 Tablespoons of milk is just shy of 1/2 Cup). Nonetheless, I pressed on and made the recipe as directed, mainly to save a novice cook the trouble. Sure enough, it was too milky; the liquid separated and ran all over the serving plate.

The title doesn't lie- these scrambled eggs are very fluffy! I'd go a little lighter than recommended on the salt, though. I put the 1/2 teaspoon in and it was pretty salty.

I agree with at least one other review that I read.  Way too much milk and way too much salt.  I will try it again and cut the recommended amounts of milk and salt in half and see how it goes.

Ok so I don't like scrambled eggs but my kids love my moms. So trying to duplicate mine always came out flat and over cooked. Everyone just said add more milk, but never could quantify how much was the right amount. Well thank you for telling me exactly how much milk to add!! This worked out great. I do place the eggs on a paper towel before serving as the juices creep the kids out.

Too much milk and too much salt.  I suppose salt depends on your taste, but I only used 1/8 tsp (instead of 1/2 tsp) and that was plenty.

Like another reviewer said, there was a lot of liquid left once the eggs were cooked.  I think I will try 4 tbsp next time.

The eggs were fluffy though.

This is virtually the same recipe as my mom's scrambled eggs, which I could not stand when I was growing up, and when I made them for the kids, they thought the eggs tasted horrible, too. However, we'd all had scrambled eggs in other places and loved them, so after some investigating, we discovered the difference was the milk. Ever since, I've only made scrambled eggs WITHOUT milk and they taste fantastic.

My eggs came out extremely watery. 7 tbsp of milk for two eggs is way too much. Plus after they were done cooking they were saturated in olive oil.

Fabulous. I halved the ingredients to make a smaller serving but added the regular salt amount. Later my sister made the correct recipe and it tasted really nice.

Eggs were very light and fluffy. The only issue was the excess liquid. I will tweak the recipe until it is perfect for me.

I never made scrambled eggs before and this was easy. I did read through the reviews first and decided to use 4 tablespoons of milk and sprinkle the salt and pepper in. It worked out perfectly. Fluffy and delicious!

I agree. Too much milk. I will try again with half the milk. The eggs tasted good , but I didn't like them swimming in the excess milk

I tripled the recipe with six eggs, used 1 teaspoon of salt and used the recommended 21 tablespoonfuls of milk (1.3 cup). The eggs came out a little too salty for my taste and there was separation of the egg from the liquid. However, they did come out fluffy. Next time, I would use less milk and reduce the amount of salt.

Fluffiest scrambled eggs I have ever made. I used less salt and I agree with another review that you might want to put on paper towel before serving to remove some of the moisture. I will definitely be making scrambled eggs this way from now on. Thank you!

This is my favorite scrambled egg receipe. I made it a few times by the receipe exactly. It was good but very runny. This last time I decided to reduce the milk a bit and that seemed to help a lot.

Too much salt and too much milk.  Re. salt:  I am a person who typically likes more salt than other people.  Re. milk:  Very surprised while cooking that there was so much liquid that would just not absorb or evaporate.  At close to 5 minutes over medium heat,  I got tired of waiting  so  I actually drained the excess liquid out of the pan over the sink and then cooked another 30 seconds.   Next time, I will use half the salt and half to two-thirds the milk  and it may be just right.

Used less milk (5 tbsp) and less salt (3 dashes) than called for but it was still too salty. Fluffy, though, so that was good.
