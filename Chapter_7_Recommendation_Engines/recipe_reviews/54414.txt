This was a very good cake! I made it for my husband's 40th birthday and it was a HUGE hit! I must admit that I had to really concentrate to make sure I got the rather complicated directions just right. The icing is truly incredible!  I will make this cake again for special occasions.

This did not work for me and I'm not sure what went wrong.  The *only* thing I changed was to do it as cupcakes but that should only affect baking time and not the cake itself.  Anyway, the "coffee" layer was ok and set up well, but the "mocha" layer never set, instead it stayed very moist and never took any form at all.  It must need more flour than just the addition of the cocoa powder.  The "mocha" batter sunk to the bottom which is the opposite of the picture and probably indicative of too thin of a batter.  I didn't even bother with the frosting as it was clear that these weren't going to work.  A dissapointment.  The idea is intriguing, so I'll try again, but with a proven recipe.

I made this for a small group get together, and everyone who tried it raved. I however, didn't really think it was super awesome. There was nothing wrong with it--it was good, but it just didn't do anything for me. I ended up keeping this in the oven for an hour, and used 1/3 c white and 1/3 c regular chocolate chips for the frosting, and it came out pretty good.
