This is a great recipe but the only issue I have is with the tomato sauce. I really believe this would be a 5 star recipe if the tomato sauce was replaced with marinara, pasta sauce or pizza sauce. If you like a little extra heat add crushed red pepper flakes on top.

I LOVE this. I've tried other zucchini pizza recipes but it was cooked in the oven. This is the best recipe I've got from this site. It's fast easy and beyond delicious.  Love the spices in it.
