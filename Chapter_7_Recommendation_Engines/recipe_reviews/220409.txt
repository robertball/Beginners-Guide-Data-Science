Poster is correct--only in Springfield will you find this...and it is delicious!  I lived there for many years and enjoyed this dish frequently.  When I would travel around the country and order cashew chicken, it was NEVER cashew chicken as I knew it; it was so puzzling.  Finally someone explained to me that it truly was 'Springfield' cashew chicken, and that other cities' renderings of the dish were entirely different.  Thanks for posting.  I was given a similar recipe several years ago (by someone who knew the story as Perri does) but I lost it.  Scrumptious!

As it is written, I give this a 4-rating. I too am from Springfield, MO, and have a recipe that is very close to this. However, mine calls for sugar in the sauce, and I really believe it gives it something that this recipe is lacking. Also, my method for battering is different. I coat the pieces in flour first (let sit in the flour to soak up the moisture on the chicken) then soak in a mixture of 4 eggs to 1 1/2 cups milk, also for a few minutes. Then redip in flour and deep fry. This makes the most incredible coating on the pieces, that really holds onto the sauce. By the way, I also use that method to make to-die-for chicken strips, adding salt and pepper to the final flour.

I really wanted to like this, but I it just didn't do it for me.  I've noticed that other versions of this dish include soy sauce and white sugar, that might have helped.  The only change I made to the recipe was to make a cornstarch slurry to prevent clumping.

This is as close to the Cashew Chicken I ate growing up in Southwest Missouri in the 60's & 70's.  Very delicious!  I only changed it slightly.  I used chicken base instead of the chicken bullion cubes as that is what I had on hand, and I added about 1 tsp. of sugar to the sauce. Also, I added some low sodium soy sauce to the sauce as well.  Also, here is a good tip: after dipping the chicken in the egg and then coating with flour, I put the chicken on waxed paper on cookie sheets and put them in the freezer for about 1 1/2 hours prior to cooking. I have found this helps the breading stay on while cooking.

I used the sauce from this recipe on some chicken that I marinated and sauteed (not battered/deep fried). It was very good and I wanted to eat the whole pan.

Heres a photo and if anyone wants the secret which mine is a little different from the norm I will gladly be glad to extend it to you.

Made this for my family and they loved it! Only thing I added was garlic & onion powder to season the flour and oriental veggies. Will be making this again! ????????

I donâ€™t know what it is.... but no matter what recipe I try, I can never get the cornstarch dissolved and it ends up clumpy! What am I doing wrong?!
