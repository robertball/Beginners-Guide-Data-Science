Great recipe.  I 'massaged' the torn kale in a bowl with a dash of kosher salt for 2-3 minutes to break down the fibres and make it more toothsome.  I also added 1 Tbsp. of tahini to the dressing for an even creamier version and added dried cranberries. Thank you for an inspirational recipe!

This was realllly good!   I only had pumpkin seeds, and used splenda instead of sugar and diced red pepper instead of raisins to make it lower calorie.  It was awesome!!  I will make again!

Excellent salad. With kale being at the very top of the most nutrient-dense foods on this planet, we’re always looking for more ways, other than smoothies, to incorporate this superfood into our eating regime. Used an entire 6 ounce container of Greek yogurt (3/5 cup), and added 4 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 tablespoon tahini. While the dressed out salad had a slight hint of bitterness which we found desirable, adding an extra step by massaging the kale will substantially remove the natural bitterness and tenderize it too (type ‘massage kale’ into your search engine to see different techniques). Nice recipe, QD&P.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it as written and also with subs as once I didn't have Yogurt so used sour cream.  I've also used cranraisins and pecans or I've diced apples and feta.  Use your imagination.  I always try to make enough for left overs.  This recipe can also be made the day before.  I recommend messaging the kale with a little olive oil, the lemon and a pinch of sea salt until it turns bright green and starts to soften, usually 3 to 5 minutes.

Kale is popular at my house, so we use it pretty often in soups, casseroles, etc. and as a substitute for spinach on occasion. However, I needed an interesting salad for a dinner party and decided to try this kale recipe. It was a huge hit and both couples at the party asked for the recipe during dinner. I used a mix of raisins and dried cranberries, but that was the only change. I also followed the tip to "massage" the kale and could really tell the difference. One note is that the salad decreases in volume after sitting in the dressing for a while, so take that into account when preparing this for a crowd. Will definitely use this recipe in the future!

I was looking for a "new" way to use the beautiful kale in my garden. This is a super easy and delicious way to do just that! The only change I made was to add some feta cheese (which I love), and leave out the raisins (which I hate!).
After having it only two weeks ago, I am making it tonight for a "garden party" (where most of the ingrediants are from the garden), and I know my guests will gobble it up!
Thank you for a delectable and easy recipe!

Great recipe! My changes were Craisins in place of raisins and toasted broken pecans instead of sunflower seeds.

I used 3 Tbsp of lemon juice instead of lemon zest, pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds, craisins instead of raisins, I added cucumbers because I love them & also some grated parm. Yummy...I had two very large bowls. It tastes better after resting in the refrigerator.

Wow, what a refreshing salad! Had to use what was on hand, substituting dates for raisins, and key lime Greek yogurt instead of plain. Left out the lemon due to the lime yoghurt, and YUMMY! Letting it rest for a few hours definitely recommended, to soften the kale.

This s is a great way to fix kale.  I massaged my washed chopped kale with a tbsp. of olive oil, a tbsp. of fresh squeezed lemon juice, and a tsp. of kosher salt.  I did not rinse after massaging.  I substituted fresh orange zest and orange juice for the lemon in the dressing.  I also substituted honey for the sugar.  It is very good!

I mixed this recipe up in the morning so it had the entire day to meld and soften the kale. I did sub dried cranberries for the raisins as that is what I had on hand. I was pretty certain my husband would not care for it, and I was correct.  I think kale is an acquired taste, and he is not there, yet.  I liked the creaminess the dressing provided, but thought the salad needed something more than raisins and red onion.  The nice thing about this salad is even though the dressing has been added, the salad will still be crisp for lunch leftovers.  I served this salad with 'Meatloaf with a Bite' and 'Cottage Noodles and Cabbage' both AR recipes.

Definitely a yummy recipe.  I used golden raisins and added some chopped celery and grapes.  At first I thought there was too much dressing but when I ate it the next day I was glad I used it all.  My husband wasn't a fan of the kale but that is okay...more for me!

Wow, this salad is awesome! Especially the dressing! I made it exactly as written except to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins as we're not crazy about raisins. I can see substituting chopped grapes and maybe adding roasted almond slivers. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

This is really good, even though I didn't allow it to stand for the full two hours before serving.  My husband, not a big kale fan, enjoyed it too.  I made it exactly as written, including homemade raisins.

The dressing is very tasty and love this salad overall. The only change I made was chopping and lightly blanching the kale to make it less “chewy”/ more palatable.

I loved this! My husband liked it too but thought is was a little rich. Didn’t have yogurt so substituted with sour cream. Not sure how much that affected it. Added some Craisins & a little feta cheese to help offset the richness. We both agreed this should be on our rotation of salads.

I have made this many times.  My favorite Kale Salad.  I only add a little  Dijon mustard (gives it a little zip),  I also lightly  salt the kale and massage it..  Trick is  to refrigerate it for at least 4-5 hours (do it in the morning).  The longer it sits, the better it is.  My husband loves it too.

I'm not generally a fan of kale salad, but this one is different! Absolutely delectable! I don't think I'll ever go back to the other, wanna-be lettuce-style kale salad. Next time I'll add bacon to this one! Incidentally, we ate it as soon as it was made and it was still excellent.

Absolutely make it again.  Great year for kale in our garden and like that it is easy to control the sugar/sweetness.

Loved this dish!  The mix of textures is a great distractor for non-kale lovers.  It's excellent with added fruits too.  I was nervous about the amount of lemon, but it makes the raw kale more palatable.

Great recipe! So much you can do with that lemon-yogurt base! I sub'd honey for the sugar, craisins instead of raisins and added some fresh grated parmesan. I also added some chopped sweet red pepper.  (Measurements are up to your liking).  Something else to try would be spicy pecans or smoked almonds tossed on the top instead of the sunflower seeds(sweet/salty/spicy/mmmm).  Or simply add some of your favorite spice to the dressing!  Delish and healthy too!

The citrus balances the grassy kale flavor nicely.  I massaged the kale for 5 minutes before using in the recipe.  The sunflower seeds are perfect for this salad.

This was awesome. I brought a big bag of kale to make a sausage and Kale soup. I had so much kale left. I used this recipe. Only difference is I used Cranberries instead of raisins

Too good to wait the 2 hours. I started stealing bits straight away. Great recipe and indeed very forgiving on ingredients. I used regular low-fat yogurt and smart balances mayo which gave it an extra zing. Red onions a nice touch. Swell.

Loved it! We enjoy garlicky kale salad with olive oil, but this creamy recipe was a wonderful change. The recipe was perfect as is, although I did add a pinch of salt. I had lemon juice but unfortunately no zest. I'm sure the zest would have added something to it but it was fine without. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! Never thought to use yogurt in a salad dressing, but it gives a wonderful light flavor with less calories than using all mayo. You can get creative with the toppings in this salad, too. I added pine nuts with the raisins.  I'll be making this one again!

I put this recipe in my shopping cart and it added Greek yogurt as plain yogurt. That is what I bought and used. Other than that, no other changes. Next time I would go easy on the lemon zest and juice. *UPDATE* I used 1/2 the lemon zest and juice and it wasn't enough. I will go with 3/4 lemon zest and juice next time.

Who knew you needed to massage your kale?  I do now.  Much less chewy after a good rub.  Just pretend it's your husband.  Great easy recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  Have tried many Kale salads before, but nothing as wonderful as this one.  I followed the recipe exactly, with two exceptions, used 1 TBL. of cranberries instead of raisen, omitted the Sunflower seeds, since didn't have it on hand and added 1 chopped tomato right before serving.   

Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe with us.

Liked this! Tweaked. Added couple tablespoons Dijon to salad dressing; used SpinBlend/Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Added some sautéed onion and bacon bits. Subbed almonds for sunflower seeds. Used 6 oz yogurt instead of 4. Flavorful and relatively low fat.

Ok, LOVE this and so does my teen daughter!  I made it just as directed.  I used pre-washed, what looked like, baby kale and it was great!  I didn't have any sunflower seeds in the house so I made without though I KNOW they would add a lot to the taste and texture! I suppose pumpkin seeds or other would work as well.  Can't wait to make it for a party! Yummy and healthy!--Hotdog!
Update:  still LOVE it. Plus. The dressing is awesome on ANY SALAD!

I love this recipe! The fact that it is tasteful and healthy at the same time is awesome, because now I can get my brother to eat something tasty that is good for him, something that he would want to do vs. talking all dinner long. I will definitely make this recipe again! I just wish that all of my dishes could be this awesome... :)

This recipe exceeded all of my expectations. I did not have reasons so I used 50% less sugar Craisins instead. It was wonderful.  I actually used the last little bit that I had left on sandwiches the next day instead of adding mayonnaise and lettuce. It was great on roasted chicken and deli ham. I highly recommend this recipe

This was fantastic.   I used craisins and silvered almonds instead of raisins and sunflower seeds.   You can pretty much use any fruit/nut combo.   I can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow.

This was excellent.   I hadn't tried kale salad before, and this was the first I've made.   I didn't have raisins but dried cranberries did the trick.    I also added a bit of grated carrots too.   I'll be making this again.

After I starting making this I realized I had no lemons or lemon juice or raisins.  I improvised with instant lemonade mix instead of lemons and sugar and with blueberries instead of raisins.  It was still surprisingly good.  Can't wait to make with the real ingredients.

I loved this salad. Didn't add onions or rasins. My husband added grapes. You could add any fruit to this. We didn't marinate the salad as long as it reccomened. We just made it for dinner and ate it. The salad was great, but I can see how marinating for awhile would make it better..
