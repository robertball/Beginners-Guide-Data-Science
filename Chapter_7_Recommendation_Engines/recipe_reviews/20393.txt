I've made ribs using this method a couple of times since finding the recipe.  I've found that for really tender ribs they need to simmer more than an hour - our best yet were simmered for 2.5 hours at a very low simmer and then covered and put in the fridge to cool in the cooking water until we were ready to grill.  Also, rather than salting the water I used Adolf's meat tenderizer.  While the sauce which accompanies the recipe is good, I've found that we actually prefer our favorite bottled BBQ sauce. It's just as good and much easier.  I grill the ribs until heated thorough and then brush on the sauce during the last few minutes to prevent the sauce from burning.  These are great for making ahead and require so little effort that they are definately a keeper.

These were fantastic.  I only made 1 change.  Instead of boiling the ribs I wrapped them in foil and baked them in 275 oven for 2 to 2-1/2 hours (until tender).  These were the best ribs I have made.

This was our first attempt at ribs and they turned out great. The recipe as written is a little confusing. I think steps 2 and 3 should be reversed. Step 2 says to cover the ribs with sauce when making the sauce is step 3. ??? A little weird. Anyhow, the ribs were delicious and tender and the sauce is pretty good. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe!  I do not own a blender, though.  I used my food chopper to mince the onions and a whisk to mix the other ingredients.  The sauce was just a tad lumpy from the onions, but completely delicious.  My BBQ taste is sweet over tangy.  I added about 4 tablespoons of brown sugar just before bringing the sauce to a boil.  After the ribs marinated all day, I wrapped them lightly in foil and placed them on the grill until they were hot.  I then removed the foil and placed the ribs directly on the grill (don't forget the Pam, especially if adding the sugar to the sauce.  Very easy to lose this meat off of the bone!) to 'grill' each side.  My VERY picky 11 year old son LOVED the ribs, and my husband said, "I don't think ANYTHING could make these ribs any better!"
My favorite thing about the recipe itself, besides the results, is the fact that the ingredients are so basic.  They are ingredients that most people already have in the kitchen!

These are the best ribs I've had in years.  Try using different vinegars such as balsamic or red wine vinegars.

Excellent!  Easy to prepare ahead of time.  I used boneless pork ribs and they came out great.  I wrapped them tightly in foil before putting them on the grill... so they steamed instead of cooked on the outside.  Kept them moist.

Made these on the spur of the moment in the oven.  My brother came over to visit and said they were, "the best ribs he ever had".  What a surprise considering I didn't even have time to marinade the ribs.

Very good.  Mine were nice and tender - the meat slid right off the bones.  I put marinated them for about 3 hours in the sauce before cooking.  
Speaking of the sauce, I prefer mine a bit sweeter, so I added brown sugar to taste.

Wow!  What a terrific (and easy) recipe.  I did make some minor modifications though.  I added a couple of tablespoons of Seracha chile to the sauce, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and substituted red wine vinegar. I also did simmer for 2 hours and then I let the ribs sit in the broth for another 2 hours finally drenching the ribs in the sauce.  My guests and I were blown away.  The meat not only falls off the bones, but the taste is really, really good!  Will definitely make again!

Excellent! I have never made ribs and this was an excellent attempt! My girlfriend said they are the best she has ever had! We will make them again! Steps 2 & 3 in the directions should be reversed. I used boneless pork ribs (country style) and reduced the boiling time in half. Save 1 cup of water from boiling the ribs to use in the sauce. I like sauce that is more sweet than tangy, but this sauce was perfect as is. Otherwise add a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to your liking. You might want to save sauce for dipping while eating, although I thought they didn't need it. Try this recipe, it will not disappoint!

So, So good!  This was the first time I had ever make ribs.  I was unsure about cooking the ribs by the boil method as listed or by baking like someone else had suggested.  Hands down BAKE THEM!  I split the ribs and cooked them both ways to compare.  The baked ribs tasted great and looked amazing as they cook in their own juices since they were wrapped in foil.  Compare that to the lack of flavor and colorless ribs that were boiled as their juices and color cook out into the water which is left to pour down the drain.  My boyfriend liked the sauce so much he even drizzled a bit over his salad.  I baked the ribs and made the sauce one night and grilled the ribs the next, it worked out just fabulously!

This was a fantastic recipe. I did make some changes. I simmered the ribs for 1 1/2 hours. Instead of the homemade sauce, I opted for store bought. A lot easier and saves time. I poured the sauce over the ribs and put into fridge for 2 hours. Then I baked them in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours or until tender/ falling off the bone. SO EASY!!! Great recipe, less mess and time. Thanks!

The meat was falling off the bone tender. The only thing different, I added two Tablespoons of brown sugar to the sauce, because I thought it was a little tangy. We definitely enjoyed our ribs! Thanks for sharing, Robbie Rice!

These ribs were amazing!  I wasn't quite sure about the whole boiling the meat thing, but the country style ribs were delectable and the sauce is what made the entire dish!  Don't miss out on this recipe, I'm sure I will be making it again!

I've always been leary of cooking spareribs for fear that they would be too tough.  I found this recipe and made 
it for my husband on Father's Day.  They were a HUGE hit with my whole family.  They were so tender and 
tasty.  I received rave reviews.  I was even told that they were better than the local barbeque restaurant.   Needless
to say, there were none left over, and I will definitely be making these at my next family barbeque.

Super easy and mostly prepared a day in advance, which makes clean up a snap!  The ribs were AWESOME!  I didn't have a blender, so my onions were chunky, though it didn't really matter.  I only boiled 1 hour, should have been a little longer.  They were pretty tender and the sauce was delicious with Sweet Baby Ray's!

I am not a ribs fan, but after preparing this recipe it is my new fave.  From reading the other reviews, I simmered for 2 hours instead of one and I prepared the sauce by using the water from boiling the ribs to make the sauce.  Added 3-4 tbl spoons of brouwn sugar as suggested.  Also, I didn't marinade the ribs in the sauce, I just used the sauce to bbq them in.  Cooked them in the foil on the grill for 15-20 and about 5 minutes outside of the foil to char.  Will use again!

Family loved this recipe. Great for the grill. You don't need to use as much butter and vinegar as the recipe calls for. But add brown sugar to taste.
This recipe is a keeper.

Finger licking delicious.
I took the advise of wrapping them in foil then baking for 2-2 1/2 hours instead of boiling. Followed the rest of the recipe with the addition of 2 tablespoons of siracha sauce for extra heat.
This is one of those recipes that once you've tasted it, you want to have them as often as your waistline permits.

These ribs were very tender.  Fall off the bone, but...if you're looking for a more smoky flavour, this isn't it.  They are tasty, but sweet.  I think next time I'll try adding liquid smoke to it.

I had never made ribs before so this was my first attempt.  What a simple recipe to follow!  The meat was so tender and just falling off the bone.  The kids asked for more, and more, and more!  Next time I might make a few changes to the sauce but now that I have the confidence of knowing I can cook ribs it will be easy!

Since I did this recipe in the winter, I cooked the ribs in my slow cooker all day. The meat fell off the bone. Then I made the sauce,(added some brown sugar), and poured it over the ribs. Baked in the oven for about 30 minutes...fantastico!!

I had to change it a little as we have about a zillion feet of snow on ground.  So, I baked it in the oven for one and a half hours at 350 degrees F.  Then put in crock pot on medium for 1/2 a day and added a bit more sauce stired a few times.  Yummy.  Beverly Jane

It's a big deal when you take that bite and know that the search has Ended!! :)
Never have I made a more successful batch of ribs.  They ate and ate and ate them.. I think they'd have eaten three days in a row!... I would have!
I had to take a few away to make sure there would be anything left over for lunch the next day.   I can hardly wait for ribs to go on sale again!  Nor to try this sauce on chicken.    BTW.. in my hurry to get this done.. I misread the recipe and put the sauce onto the ribs when I was putting them into the frig. and then used that pan to baste out of.  I haven't made it again to try no sauce til we get to the grill, so I don't know if that makes a difference.
Thank you so much for posting .. mmmm :)

I don't cook much. When I tried this recipe (my first for the ribs), my girl friend loved it! I used beef ribs and grill the ribs on top of an alumium sheet to retain the sauce. Watch out the heat. I burned it somewhat on my gas grille set on high.

The last ribs I made many, many years ago were tough. We always had them out. Decided I'd try them again. Thawed 4 lbs of ribs overnight. Made a brine of salt & brown sugar. Brined ribs in cold water for 5 hrs. Boiled 1 hr. Sauced and refriderated for 2 hrs. Grilled about 30 mins. Delish-the only thing I'd change would be use my husbands recipe for BBQ sauce. His is better. You might want to add a dash or two of Tabasco sauce for a little kick. Overall a good recipe.

These ribs are fantastic.  I have been trying to find a good rib recipe for years.  We tried last week and can't wait to make them for our next family BBQ.  The best part is you can cook it all ahead and then just throw on the grill for a few minutes when you are ready to eat.  The sauce was a little too tart for me so I added some brown sugar to sweeten and then some hot sauce to add a little heat.  The only problem I have with the recipe is finding a pan big enough to cook the ribs in since they go so fast!!

I made these yesterday for our family's 4th of July get together. I doubled the sauce recipe for two racks of ribs, brought to a boil in the oven at 400 for 20-30 minutes, then simmered at 250 for an hour...all the night before, marinated overnight, and they were THE hit of dinner. Never made ribs before I saw this recipe, but you can be sure I'll make these over and over and over again.

Made these again for a 2nd time tonight... this time with large pork spare ribs.  As before, these were so tender and tasty!  Use half the sauce for basting and save half for dipping!

Great ribs! I cooked them alot longer though, about 2.5 hours,and added a little pickling spice to the water as well. I added liquid smoke to the sauce, and some spices, it was a little vinegary for me, but still turned out well.

Very tender meat and easy to make.  I made the recipe as stated, except I pureed the butter/garlic/onion with the other sauce because my husband doesn't like chunky onions.  Also added a touch of Liquid Smoke for a little extra flavor.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is a great tasting BBQ sauce.  My husband and in-laws loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and added 2 tbs. of brown sugar (we like our sauce sweet) this is a definte keeper I don't think we will be using bottled sauce anymore!  Thanks!

This recipe is great.  I did boil longer than an hour.  My kids who are very picky eaters even liked it.  I have only tried to make ribs a few times and I will use this recipe from now on.  I saved some of the sauce and used it in and on some hambergers the next day!

Nice and easy rib recipe!  I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I used bourbon - I wish I had used just a little bit more to give it some more kick.  I liked boiling off most of the fat this way, but my ribs were just a little dry - I think that was my fault, I probably grilled them too long.  Will definitely make again, and probably spice up the sauce just a bit.

This was awesome.  My whole family loved them... even my picky kids.  The only thing that was bad was that the dog got into the leftovers.  I guess she wanted to see what we were raving about.  THESE ARE GREAT RIBS!

Excellent. Made them for dinner tonight and our family of four (including two children) loved them. I doubled the recipe, which worked great and carefully finished them off on the grill. This was a little tricky because they wanted to fall apart but I think it's worth the extra step. All in all, a pretty easy recipe. Thanks!

I've never made ribs in my life but when my son brought home 10 pounds of them I had to.  I picked this recipe because of its ease and darn it if it didn't turn out great.  The sauce was stellar even though I didn't puree the onions.  The only thing is be sure the grill master doesn't overcook them like my dear old hubby did.  Really good way to make ribs.

These turned out ok, and I only say ok, as I had read all the other reviews and was expecting more. I did not buy the ribs myself, but the meat did fall off the bone. I think that I will tweak the sauce abit more as it was just sauce to me, but everyone said they were good, tasty was the comment. Make sure you simmer them at least 2.5 hours depending on the size of the ribs as one part was not cooked through. Will make them again, just tweak the sauce, maybe more spice?

These were delicious and I didn't even have time for the whole recipe!  It was the first time I ever made a rack of ribs and I didn't realize the time commitment.  So I cut them every 2 or 3 rib bones into individual servings and put them in a pot of water and set it to boil.  Once it boiled, I lowered the heat to a slow simmer.  I left them in for about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I then removed them from the water and put in a marinading dish.  I just used a bottle of 'sweet and spicy' bbq sauce and covered the ribs with it.  I let them sit for about 45 minutes before grilling them.  They were really tasty.  I will definitely try the marinade next time...I bet it will be even better.

Made this for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. Boiled the ribs for about one and a half hours which I found to be plenty then covered them with the sauce and left them for 3 hours before we barbequed them. The only thing I will change next time will be to use less butter to cook the onions and garlic.....otherwise PERFECT !!!!

These were good, but no one raved over them.  They just quietly disappeared in the background.  However, I couldn't grill them the entire time because I couldn't figure out how to control the flame.  (It was  the first time using my friend's propane grill.)

This was absolutely wonderful. I actually have never been a fan of Barbeque but I tried this one and I love it. This is definately going to be the only Barbeque sauce I ever use for any kind of Barbeque.

STARTED TO MAKE THIS FOR FAMILY "FOURTH". I ENDED UP DOING THIS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE. NOT A COMPLAINT AMONG THEM.  INSTEAD OF BOILING THEM, I PRESSURE COOK FOR ONE MINUTE PER POUND.  MAKES IT GO FASTER.

These ribs were pretty good and SO EASY TO MAKE!!!  I had my in-laws and my parents over for a father's day bbq, and myself and my husband were able to enjoy the afternoon with them instead of slaving over the grill.  I will definitely save this one and use it again in the future.

Sorry, but I can only give this 3 stars; I don't know what the big Yuk is about this recipe. Maybe I did something wrong. Everything tasted OK; kids liked it. But would not make again with the work involved.

Delicious!  Easy to make, and so so good...Everyone loved them.  This is definitely my favorite rib recipe ever!  I used Sweet Baby Rays sauce and baby back ribs.  Your guests will agree they are to die for!

Wow.  My husband said this was the best meal I have ever made him.  i increased the vinegar and garlic a little and doubled the sauce  to have more leftover to put on top.  These were so good he could not stop talking about them for days.

These were great!  I took a bit of a shortcut (didn't have them in the fridge for the full time), because I was running out of time and they were still excellent. I did add a few T of sugar as suggested because I, too, like my sauce sweeter.  Next time I might try and simmer them a little longer   on very low to see if it makes them even more tender.

the ribs felt really tender, but they were very difficult to get into....I possibly didnt either boil or cook them long enough.....DO NOT USE THIS COMMENT AS A DETERMENT TO YOUR COOKING OF THE RECIPE!!!!!! Im sure if cooked right, they would be excellent.

followed this recipe to a "T" and was underwhelmed.  I should have gone with my gut feeling and simmered the the ribs a LOT longer (like another hour!) cause they turned out a bit tough.  I was also unclear as to whether the ribs were supposed to sit in the fridge in the sauce or not... so I did put the sauce on the ribs while in the fridge, which I assumed couldn't hurt them.  The sauce flavor was a bit too vinegary (and I added brown sugar as others suggested) and wasn't what I would  consider to be "the greatest."  I do like the idea of cooking the onions/garlic and butter (although a half cup of butter is a bit excessive) and then pureeing it all in the blender so this was a good starting point.  Bottom line... sauce a bit vinegary and ribs need to be cooked longer.  I'll keep looking for the "perfect" rib recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  The ribs were not that flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use any onion.  I even left the ribs marinating in the fridge overnight. I gave this 3 stars because my boyfriend said it was good.

Very good ribs.  I added some honey to sweeten the sauce a little.  Brown sugar would work good too.  My husband commented on how good they were without having to be asked.  That is a good sign!

This was very easy, I used a different sauce from another recipe on this site, & results were wonderful. This was a perfect way to make ribs for a party.

These ribs were very good.  Although we did make some changes in the sauce.  We added some molasses to make it a little more sweeter and we know for next time not to use so much vinegar.

Fantastic! I doubled the amount of sauce because I was doubling the amount of meat; turns out I didn't need to. I had entirely too much sauce and nothing to do with it. The ribs were phenomenal-- very tender and flavorful! I will definitely make this dish again.

So delicious!! I simmered the ribs for almost 2 hours, adding a bay leaf and other seasoning, and then just left them in the pot overnight in the fridge. The next night I took them out while the grill was heating up and cooked them 8 minutes a side, and then added our favorite BBQ sauce. The meat was perfect, and the flavours amazing. So easy!! I will definitely make these again, and again, and again!!

Very good flavor.  I just wish the good flavor was throughout the ribs. The taste seemed to stay on the outside.
