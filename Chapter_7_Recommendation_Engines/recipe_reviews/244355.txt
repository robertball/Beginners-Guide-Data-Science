Great idea and the flavor was good but you'll need to make some adjustments. By just cutting the core out, I could see that I had way more filling than would fit in the hole. So, I carved more out but was still only able to get half of it in there and then there was no room for butter. You'll either need to cut such a big hole that you waste a lot of the cabbage or either just scale the filling in half. Cook time was spot on.
