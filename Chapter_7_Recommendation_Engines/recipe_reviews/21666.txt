This recipe was horrible! I have a recipe I have been using for the 28 yrs my husband (a retired Marine) and I have been married.  This is a dish that dependent wives always learn.  I tried it because I wanted to try something different. My word, I don't know how this made it onto allrecipes.  Do they test the recipes first?  I will definitely stick to my old recipe.

In my experience, the appropriate ratio of flour/butter/milk to get a creamy consistency rather than *paste* should be 3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons flour and 2 cups milk. And I don't know why I thought adding sugar would be a good idea to try! I always put the beef in a colander and rinse with hot water before adding to the gravy, it cuts the salt a bit. Add some black pepper and that's all the seasoning you need. I'll stick to my tried and true SOS recipe from now on thanks.

Too much work & fat.
The easy way we do this is buy the canned or packaged chipped beef in the grocery store...cut to your desired size and add the beef to a can of creme of mushroom soup (using one can of milk to make the soup).  Simple, easy, heat it up and serve over toast or english muffins.

I have made Creamed Chipped Beef for years and thought I would try this version, too much flour per amount of milk, brown sugar was not a hit with us.  Will stick with just making a cream gravy with the beef adding a touch of garlic powder.

This recipe did not work for me at all - I had to add about 10 times the amount of milk it called for just to make it a consistency other than glue.

Couldn't hack the sugar... gave the recipe a strange flavor.  Salt and pepper must be a better substitute.

Not a good taste at all. I see on here that several people have said that they have much better recipes that they currently use. Could you please post them as my girlfriend grew up on this and I am trying to make a good version for her. I grew up in the south and we did not eat this where I came from she is from Indiana and ate this a lot. Please help. LucasWilliamsGranda ma lives in her home town of Muncie, I would love to get her recipe if she sees this.

This recipe was quite good, actually, with ham in place of the beef.  On a morning that the fridge was running low, I prepared this with deli ham(chopped), and served it over fried potatoes with stewed apples on the side.  Definitely use 3tbs flour and 2c milk as directed by one of the other reviews.  interesting twist on SOS!

There has to be a mistake in this recipe.  It calls for 1/2 cup flour.  Two teaspoons will thieken 1 cup of milk adequately.  Also,  The sugar is terrible.

Not at all like chipped beef. Tasted terrible flour  to milk ratio too high. Added almost twice the milk and it was still like paste.

Used Real Dried Beef not in a jar but from a meat deli in PA. Yes def. way too much flour for that much milk. Just stick with a basic roux ratio. And I added 1/2 less brown sugar but probably didn't need any. My teenagers thought this was fantastic.

I'm getting ready to make it now.  I used to love it growing up but we never served it on a "shingle" altho my dad (ex-Navy_ made sure to tell us the SOS story - LOL.  My mom served it on mashed potatoes and OMG it is to die for.  
I don't ever remember her sauteeing the beef before hand but I will follow the recipe.

This recipe is simply simple.  It's inexpensive, cheap, and extremely simple.  If you don't have much money and not much food around, I suggest this.  I usually don't even toast my bread.  I serve it over white bread with tomato slices topped with cottage cheese.

This was my 1st time making it so I followed the recipe exactly.
It was SO thick...had to keep adding more milk.
At first it was quite tasty. But into the 2nd pc of toast it was obnoxiously salty.  Then I started feeling sick. Not a healthy breakfast surely.

I started out making it by the directions but soon I had to make changes.   The mixture was super thick. I will definitely be cutting back on the flour and adding equal of portions of the butter and flour.

Do not use butter on this. It was so salty, we couldn't finish it at all. I had to add milk and flour as I went as well. It would have been much less salty if you were to use oil to sauté the beef instead of butter.

it was pretty interesting with the brown sugar. I added some cayenne, a touch of garlic and some white pepper, so it had a nice spicy/sweet taste. My husband and I liked it.  I did use much less flour though, because it thickens up so quick, it was getting to be like wallpaper paste.

This is the same recipe my mother used..while I was growing up. My  father  was  raised on this stuff…I admit, if this recipe isn't fixed just right, will have a   floury paste taste to it…Soaking the dried chip beef in milk over night takes a lot of the salt out of the chipped beef…Yummy comfort food…

I LOVE this recipe!!! For years I have been making this recipe without the sugar and kept thinking my grandmother's recipe was so much better, what is missing?  Then I found this recipe and tried it and yes the sugar is what was missing it adds an additional depth to the flavors.  Thank you!!!
