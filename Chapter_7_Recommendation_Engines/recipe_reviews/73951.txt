Great recipe!  However, instead of using 1 full cup of sugar over the blueberries, I only used 1/2 cup.  I think I might use 1/4 cup next time as it was still quite sweet for me.  I loved it!

My kids and I were looking for some dessert that we could make with some blueberries that were in our fridge.  This was easy to make with 2 kids, and turned out great!! The only thing that we changed was using butter in place of the shortening.  Will make again.

Fantastic!  We're in the Annapolis Valley and blueberries are just coming into season, so this was a lovely way to ring in the new blueberry season!
 I had to make a couple of changes - I had no white sugar so I had to substitute Splenda.  Good to know I can make this for my father in law, who is diabetic.  Also, I only used 1/2 the splenda on the blueberries as a whole cup seemed too much and I was right on - it was a lovely combination of sweet/tart.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The grunt was so delicious served with homemade vanilla ice cream out on our front porch looking at the tide going out.  Perfection.

Wow! This is good.  I had no idea what a grunt is, but it seemed like a fun idea to tell my husband that he was having "grunt" for dessert after I found this when looking for something to do with some blueberries I had bought.  This was very quick and easy to make and tasted so good.  Only thing I did different was to reduce the amount of sugar to about 2/3 cup after I tasted my blueberries to see how sweet they were.  Definitely going to make this again.

This was awesome!  Just like we had on honeymoon in Atlantic Canada!  I had to use frozen blueberries, as good ones are hard to find this time of year, but it still turned out well!

Baked up just perfect in a little under 40 minutes!  Hailing from the Annapolis Valley in NS, this dessert is a must at blueberry season!  Served it up with some whipped cream!  Wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious! Used 2/3c sugar + 2 tsp lemon juice with my blueberries, and I used buttermilk in place of milk for a extra rich crust. It was fantastic! Baking time was 35 minutes at 350.

After I had started this recipe, I discovered that I was almost out of all purpose flour.  I opened a boxed cake mix and used the cake flour. I also used Splenda for the sugar (diabetic). It turned out great, but with a cake like topping instead of the dropped mix.

This dessert made me feel like June Cleaver. A true dessert from years gone by. Rustic and delicious. This is not a dessert to serve at a high end dinner party, but as a meal ender for close friends and family ... it cannot be beat. My husband said this was the best dessert I ever made. Very high praise for such a simple recipe. I will be making this again and again. I added the zest of one lime to the blueberries, increased to 1/4 teaspoon of salt, butter instead of shorting, and gave the batter a good sprinkling of sanding sugar to add a little texture and crunch. Don't forgo a big dollop of whip cream. It is essential to the look and taste of this dessert.

This is the second time I've made this dessert and it turned out MUCH better, since I used only 1/2 cup of sugar to sprinkle over the blueberries. The first time I made this it was WAY too sweet. I also used 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of the egg and it worked great! We really like this odd-named dessert! The fresh blueberries are delicious when they aren't drowned in sugar, and I think fresh blueberries are a must. Thanks for the good start to a yummy dessert recipe! :)

So I would call this a cobbler. I usually love the biscuit-like topping of a cobbler, but this topping was tough and had little flavor, perhaps because you don't cut in the shortening/butter, and I think it needs more salt. I followed the topping part exactly, so tough texture is not because I made changes. I did add only 1/2 cup sugar to the blueberries, and was was still WAY too sweet. Just didn't care for this one.

This was excellent!  Needed to use up blueberries  and found this recipe.  Used less sugar over the berries and butter in place of shortening as suggested by other reviewers. Followed the rest of the directions as originally written.  Came together super quick as this was a last minute idea when I realized the blueberries needed saving!!!  Hubby/son/son's girlfriend all raved.  Served hubby's straight up...the kid's had theirs over vanilla ice cream while the grunt was still nice and warm from the oven.  Big debate over which way was better!  Will def. make again, as requested by the crew!!

Over on the mainland, we don't bake blueberry grunt. We throw the dough into a pot with the blueberries boiling in sugar. Then you get dumplings and blueberry sauce - Blueberry Grunt. BUT, I like this recipe better! Shhhh, don't tell my mother or grandmother.

Although a simple and quick recipe, found it to be very bland tasting.  Needs some vanilla, maybe a touch of cinnamon would help.  Cook time was off as well, baked 45 mins, and the center still came out a little gooey.  Wouldn't try this one again.

Followed other reviewers and halved the amount of sugar and it was plenty sweet. Also, batter wasn't thick enough to spoon so I just poured it on and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top. WISH I had put some sliced fresh peaches on top of the batter, think it would be wonderful. Plan on doing just that next time. VERY easy recipe with things I have in my pantry, a real plus!

i'm rating this even when I forgot to add the sugar to the blueberries. Our plump BC blueberries were so flavourful that the accidental omition worked out anyways. Super tasty with yummy fresh blueberries ( might need sugar with frozen store bought ones though).

I love this recipe and usually double it--put in two casserole dishes.  I love it as a dessert, but I particularly enjoy it as a side dish to scrambled eggs...or any kind of eggs: poached, soft boiled... in the morning--forget muffins; this is the way to go!

Perhaps the yummiest fruit dessert I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly (although scaled down a bit) and it came out perfectly.  I did need to bake it closer to 45 minutes.

A dessert this good shouldn't be so easy to make!  I've made it twice so far, once with blueberries and once with raspberries.  I preferred the blueberry version because the blueberries are sweeter. (I'll use a little extra sugar with raspberries next time)  I'm going to try it with peaches next.  This recipe is going in my permanent file.

This was the best blueberry concoction I've ever baked or tasted. Truly! I brought it to work and it was gone in under 30 minutes. We sprinkled about 3/4c of white sugar on our berries b/c they were super-sweet already. In addition, we used splenda brown sugar blend for the crust instead of white sugar. I also felt like the crust needed extra baking time. We took it out at about 45 minutes.

Made with fresh blackberries but more like a big muffin/cake/cobbler. :) Maybe needs more butter for that mmmm taste?  Definitely put all the sugar on the berries or they're too tart/bitter.  Maybe take 1/2 sugar out of the batter so that the dish won't be too sweet.

A good receipe, but this is not a grunt.  Grunts are cooked on top of the stove and the dumplings are steamed in the pot.

Oh wow. I made this with New Brunswick blueberries, which weren't very sweet this year, and reduced the first cup of sugar to 1/2 cup, and it was still AMAZING. Just the right sweetness. I also substituted butter in place of the shortening. If using sweeter blueberries, like those on the West Coast, I'd probably use 1/4 cup of sugar.

Very nice.  I used less than half the sugar--it just seemed to  be too much as I was sprinkling on the sugar.  Otherwise, I left this all the same.  I don't think that you need to spoon the batter on top--you can just dump it all and it will be fine!  The topping is very cake-like, so be forewarned if you aren't a big fan of those.  This is quite delicious, and so so easy.  Thanks for the recip!

I made this last night for dessert, but I didn't have the full amount of blueberries the recipe called for.  So, I used 1 1/2 C. blueberries and 1 1/2 C. raspberries (I guess you could call that a blaspberry grunt).  I also used butter in place of the shortening, since I'm not a big shortening fan.  I don't eat sugar, so I substituted agave nectar for the sugar and it was absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  The only thing I noticed about the recipe that I didn't like was that I thought it needed more than a pinch of salt, but otherwise it was perfect.  We topped it off with sugar-free French Vanilla ice cream and it was a big hit...especially with my husband!  Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  Made as directed except for butter instead of shortening and used an extra cup of blueberries because I needed to get rid of them. :)  Delicious!!

I thought I had just shy of 3 cups of blueberries. Because I was using a bigger casserole to bake it in, I decided I would add 1 1/2 of raspberries. Turns out, I had 1 7/8 cups of blueberries and 1 cup of Saskatoon berries. So, my blueberry grunt turned into blueberry/Saskatoon/raspberry grunt. Delicious.

I used less sugar because I did not have quite 3 cups of berries.  However, I think you could have used 4 cups of berries in this recipe and still have had plenty of topping. I changed a few other things besides the reduction of sugar.  I squeezed the juice of half a fresh lemon over the sugared berries and put the zest of that half lemon in there also.  Then I put on the topping as directed.  Oh and I used coconut oil in replacement for the shortening because that is what I had on hand.

I told myself if this actually turned out well the way I made it, I'd write a review. So here I am. I kind of doubled the recipe (used up the rest of my 10 pounds of blueberries, about 5.5 cups, give or take a few moldy ones). Used coconut sugar instead of white sugar, and with my 5.5 cups of blueberries I used one cup of sugar total to sprinkle on top. It was plenty. Used 4 tbsp butter instead of shortening, and I accidentally melted it all the way instead of creaming it. Used sweetened original almond milk instead of regular milk, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I used a 9x13 pan instead of a casserole dish, and it all fit in fine without bubbling over or spilling. I have a convection oven so it baked at 325 F for about 32 minutes, and then I left it in the oven after I turned it off. It came out GREAT!!!! I didn't think the topping tasted bland, but my milk was slightly sweet, and coconut sugar tastes awesome. So maybe that made a big difference. Delicious.

The recipe made way too much topping and it didn't bake all the way through.  The bottom part was delicious, as was the part of the topping that did bake through.  Will make some adjustments next time.

It was very good with vanilla ice cream. I liked the crust, but I had a hard time telling when it was done because it cracked and peering down it looked very wet. I ended cooking it almost an hour.  This is not wow, but is so easy that it is worthy to be added to a very time consuming meal.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This dessert is ok but nothing special. The batter is a little plain despite me adding some cinnamon. I used an 8”x8” dish and had to increase the cooking time to 45 minutes.

I have made Blueberry Grunt many times with another recipe I had from a dear friend in N.S. but I have since lost that recipe. I tried this recipe but there is way to much milk added and it is to runny to spoon anything onto the berries. The topping is way to runny. You should be just adding milk until the mixture is spoonable and nothing more. It also took well over an hour to bake. This really isn't a N.S. grunt

I make this often.  From Woodstock, NB but live in Plattsburgh, NY.   I take it to the girls at work to give them a little taste of ‘home’.   Make it usually with 3/4 cup of sugar but all else the same.  I miss the Maritimes!

This was easy to make; however, I prefer a traditional cobbler. Cobblers have less sugar and if I made this again I would cut back on the sugar content.

Not a winner for us, I did substitute butter for shortening but I doubt that was the problem.  To me it tasted like a really sweet blueberry pancake.  Maybe a blueberry crisp would be more to our liking.

The proportion of blueberries to cake fell short. It needed more fruit/moisture. I also substituted whole whet flour which is less moist. I will make it with some added berries and maybe separate the egg for lightness.

I enjoyed the simplicity of the ingredients and the method.  Served it on Canada Day ... while living down in Florida and enjoyed the connection to "Cape Breton".  

I used frozen blueberries and only used a sprinkle of sugar on the fruit.  The cobbler topping had an enjoyable consistency to it and stood up nicely to the fruit. It almost was blueberry scone like ... but airy ... not doughy. 

I will try this batter with some herbs incorporated to use in a savoury dish.

Cooking now! I am getting hungry. I searched the internet for recipes for blueberry grunt(Nova Scotia) as my friend, who gave me a frozen bag of berries from her crop, is out of province and didn't give me her recipe before leaving. This recipe seemed correct and I had all the ingredients on hand.
I have a couple notes for everyone, but do keep in mind I am no expert, just been around awhile. Please do not feed your families Splenda. That is not food. It is a chemical used as a laxative in hospitals. Try a Canadian product called "Just Like Sugar" instead. Note #2: Vary the amount of sugar, or reasonable natural substitute, depending on the berries. If you have wild blueberries then they are already very sweet. Different high-bush berries also have great differences in sweetness. Note #3: I followed the recipe and am hoping for a great treat in a little bit, but my instincts tell me I should have used a good quality butter instead of shorting. I started with frozen berries and put them and sugar in my dish and put into the oven, while I prepared the "grunt"?  Berries were thawed and very warm before I finished. I stirred the berries to mix in the sugar a bit better before completing. After fully assembled, I thought the mix may be a bit dry so I added about a quarter cup of warm water between the dumplings; just an instinctive move. My grunt is nearly done. I took to heart that some thought the biscuit part was a bit flavourless, so just as the biscuits were turning brown, I

I added lemon juice to the fruit and only 1/2 c sugar on the fruit and that was more than sweet enough for me! I loved the fruit part of the desert. The cake was tough and not much more taste than plain bread. I even added cinnamon. I will not make it again. One note: They do not tell you how much baking powder to use, so l added 1/2 tsp.

After reading the reviews, I used a lot less sugar to retain the fresh blueberry taste.  This was a delicious dessert.
