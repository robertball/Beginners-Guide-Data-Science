I sliced and sauteed the chicken with onion and garlic in a dutch oven then added some diced jalapeno, frozen corn, fresh carrots and celery. Added ground cumin, paprika, along with the oregano. Added clilantro and fresh parseley. I used both fresh lime juice and lime zest and was worried it would taste too strongly of lime, but it was just perfect. My husband couldn't get enough of it! With some low fat sour cream, tortilla chips and shredded cheddar it made for a wonderful lunch. Great with a cold beer or margarita!

This was very light and delicious!  I did not have 6 limes so, I just grated some lime peel into the soup when I boiled the chicken and it turned out great!  I love the stong lime flavor in this.  I will make this again for sure!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very yummy with two additions...I used shrimp instead of chicken and also put fresh corn, cut from the cobb, into the soup. It only needed about 3 1/2 limes...quite limey so use caution and taste before adding all 6 limes. Also, I omitted the extra salt in step 2. Plenty of seasoning.

Fantastic soup and flavor.  I love fresh lime and cilantro.  One thing we might add next time is hominy to add a bit more substance to it.

Amazing!!  So refreshing!  I didn't use fresh tomatoes, I used Rotel and a can of green chiles to save time.  Also, I added corn niblets, rice and carrots for my tasting.  I make a pot EVERY WEEK!!

I used a poblano pepper... This is by the far the best Mexican-style soup I've found on this website. Thank you for sharing this!

I just returned from a weeklong trip to Merida in in the Yucatan from whence this recipe originates (Mayan cuisine). I ordered at either lunch or dinner at least five times. Just so good! I've made it twice following the directions exactly the first time with the second batch tasting exactly like the real thing. The only changes I made were to literally quadruple the cilantro and double the chili pepper. The soup I had in the Yucatan is definitely spicier. Thanks for this recipe! I will be making it regularly from now on!

I like the flavor of this soup alot.  I sauteed the onion, garlic and chicken together before adding it to the chicken stock.  I know you're thinking it's too much lime but it's not - the flavor comes out really good.  Make sure you use plenty of fresh cilantro - it's essential.  This soup tastes really fresh with a little bit of a kick.  I will make it again.

It was good. I would definitely add something to the soup so it's not mostly broth. I added some egg noodles (which just cooked in the broth) and corn. I tried 1/2 the lime juice but needed the full amount to make it the right flavor.

This soup is fresh, healthy, and delicious! This will definately be a go-to meal for me, it was very easy to make. I  know I will crave this on gloomy days. I did make a few changes. First, I used 6 Roma tomatoes instead of 2 large tomatoes because most Mexican dishes I make call for Roma. Second, I added a bit of cayenne pepper for a little extra spice. The last thing I changed was that I served with cubed avocado on top which really made the soup taste finished to me (I tried with and without). I highly recommend serving with avocado. Also, it does have a very tangy lime flavor so if you aren't crazy about fresh lime (I am) try using 4 or 5 limes instead. Yum!

I went to Mexico on vacation and had lime soup for the first time. When I got back, I knew I had to find a recipe! 

I altered only slightly by substituting a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and only 4 limes. Next time I think I'll leave out the green onion, as I didn't taste it and had a lot left over that I won't use. I ate with some Multigrain Tostitos on top, and it was excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly (which I rarely do), and the results were delicious.  With the exception of my youngest, who thought the lime juice was a little sour, my family loved it.  I will make this healthy soup again.

Indeed light & refreshing...I prepared with chicken thighs and 2 large jalapenos. Very good - thanks for sharing. I ate half a bowl before realizing I forgot the cilantro - good without, even better with. I love limes too, BTW. :D

Incredibly good!  I used 2 small serrano chiles and the heat was perfect for us.  Don't skip on the cilantro at the end, it really makes the dish.  Reheats well.

This is a great soup! I replaced the tomatoes with habanero Rotel. I wasn't sure what kind of pepper to use as "green chile pepper" is rather vague, so I used a nice big jalapeno. I also zested my limes and used the zest in the soup. I didn't remove my chicken & cut it up; I just cooked til it was shreddable and then shredded it right in the pot using 2 forks (1 to hold it still, one to tear it into chunks). I served this with optional tequila, tortilla chips, and cream of coconut. (Interestingly, I was the only one to use all three. Go figure.) This was very easy to do; in the future however I will probably use 1 less chicken breast and add a cup of brown rice, pearl barley, or pre-cooked kidney beans (just because I like all those things better than chicken). I'll definitely make this again, and a big thank-you to ShareBear for recommending it!

Very light and flavorful! Also very versatile as many reviewers have noted.I adjusted the recipe to make 3 servings because I had two chicken breasts I needed to use up, and rounded all the other ingredients up (whole onion instead of 3/8, etc.) I dusted the breasts with S&P, garlic powder and flour and sauteed them in butter over medium heat 5 mins per side to carmelize them before slicing them. Didn't have fresh tomatoes, I used a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes with chilis. While the (adjusted) recipe said to juice 2-1/4 limes and to put 1/4 lime in the soup, I used the juice & zest of 1 large lime and put 1/2 lime in the soup. The key to using limes is to taste after each addition, because the acidity of other ingredients you use affects the strength and bitterness of the lime. The balance of acidity was perfect, the zest adds more lime flavor than the juice does. Used fresh herbs since I grow these, adjusted the amount of fresh oregano down a smidge.  It added a wonderful savory note. Since I used canned tomatoes, I didn't add any S&P until the end, I added maybe 1/2 tsp Adobo seasoning, which is salty. Instead of tortilla chips, I fried strips of small white corn tortillas in hot grapeseed oil (healthy, almost tasteless vegetable oil with a high smoking point) until puffy and browned, mixed up some S&P, chili powder & cumin and sprinkled over strips. Served with lots of fresh cilantro & strips.  My husband, who isn't a chicken soup lover, loved it! 
Will make this again!

I used already cooked chicken breast that was shredded and homemade chicken broth. I used a red pepper and yellow onion. I didn't have any good fresh tomatoes so I used two cans of mexican stewed tomatoes with their juices and added pickled jalapenos in place of the green chile pepper. Couple changes but still tasted fab!

I did add carrots, celery, potatoes and cumin like others did but it would have been great without as well. Makes a ton!

Great soup easily made vegan/vegetarian by the substitution of chicken broth with vegetable broth and chicken breast with vegan chicken.  I also added some broken up pieces of cooked spaghetti.  Absolutely delicious.

Made this last night because limes were on sale 9/$1 and I picked up a bunch not having the slightest idea what I would use them for. The soup is very light so I would definitely add something to it so it's not mostly broth. I chose to add cooked noodles..but I think it still needs something else..just not exactly sure what. I will also cut back on the amount of limes used..since 6 was too strong for our taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe..it was nice to try something new!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! My family and friends are still talking about this one. I served it with brazillian lemonade and southwestern-style egg rolls. Great meal!!! I tried some of this at work in the cafeteria, and decided to make it myself because it was so good. All of my co-workers said this was the better tasting version. I added the juice of 3 more limes just to really give it an extra kick. Next time I might add some corn or black beans to give it more substance.

Excellent soup - great flavour but still made some changes.  Didn't use tomatoes, oregano, thyme or chile pepper.  Used 2 tetra packs of broth with only 1 1/2 limes.  Added 1 cup of frozen corn and some black beans.  Topped with tortilla chips and shredded cheese.  Even the kids loved it!

I made this soup yesterday and although I found it too limy (that's not correct), my son and daughter in law loved it.  My son is on a diabetic diet and this is so good for him.  I made it just as shown and I will make it again.  Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious. I added carrots, celery and potatoes to make it heartier, and used home made stock. Will definitely make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the aftertaste was far too bitter for us. I really wanted to love this as it was easy to prepare and very healthy. I ate one bowl and threw out the rest. Maybe use less lime? I know I am in the minority here, but my boyfriend and I really didn't care for it. Just had a really strong, unpleasant bitter taste. Thank you, though! It is always fun trying new things.

I have not tried this recipe but just got back from Mexico where I enjoyed Mayan Lime Soup.  The soup I had in Mexico also had strips of tortilla chips in it.   For those wanting a little more substance in their soup, that would be worth trying.

I first had Lime Soup on my honeymoon in Riviera Maya, Mexico in February 2008. I had it again on vacation in Cancun, Mexico in February of 2011. This took me right back. The flavors and textures are just like I remember. It's such a light and refreshing soup. We even loved it in 80-degree weather! I still giggle when I think about one of our tour guides convincing a teenaged tourist that the soup has iguana in it! lol

This soup was absolutely amazing!! Of course I had to alter some of the ingredients but overall what a tasty light cuisine. Instead of chili peppers I added a couple of anaheim peppers to give it more spice. I also added squash and zuchinni to give it more color.

One fourth of a recipe served two of us generously at lunch.  I wanted something not too heavy to go with grilled  scallop ceviche. I used half of a large chicken breast for 1/4 recipe.  I added some leftover crumbly taco chips and cilantro to the broth near the end. Next time I will add cilantro to the broth initially.  It has just the right amount of tartness but could use some more  heat. I'll leave pepper seeds in next time.

This is the best soup I have ever made! I usually make a soup on Wednesdays and have it for a few days and freeze the rest in lunch size portions....this soup, however, did not make it to the freezer! I couldn't stop eating it.....thanks a lot for posting...it was exactly what I was looking for and I didn't change a thing to the recipe....PERFECTO!!!!

Excellent, crockpot friendly soup! Reminds me of the Sopa de Lima my husband and I had on our honeymoon in Cancun. Very filling, nourishing, and refreshing with its sour component. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but sautéed the veggies in butter to avoid unnecessary polyunsaturated fat. I also made it in a crockpot, rather than the stove, as I needed to make it in advance. I put the chicken broth + spices + chicken in on high until I had chopped the veggies and squeezed all the limes; by that time, the chicken was ready to be pulled out and shredded. I added all the ingredients to the crockpot, chopped a lime in half and threw it in, and put it on low for 4 hours. Absolutely delicious.

Excellent!   Spot on.  Go to Mexico every year and love the Yucatán lime soup.   Only changes I made was to use 1 can of Rotel celantro lime tomatoes and 1 less lime.   Will definitely be making this again and again

Delicious!!!!!! We added some rice but, honestly, it is a fantastic recipe as written! The lime flavor was perfect, not too sour. My son (who dreads soup for dinner lol) slurped it down with delight. Yum!! This recipe is a winner! I’ll definitely be making this again!

Enjoyed it hot for lunch today.  Looking forward to having it cold.  We did not include the chili pepper seeds but it probably would spice it up a bit for those who like it hotter.  We did not use quite as much lime juice.  We added a bit of Tajin.  The extra lime flavor, spice and saltiness was great.

Wow,  amazingly good.  I had never had this delicious soup and it is now a favorite.   Used two cans of diced tomatoes(minus the juice) for the tomato requirement and a tablespoon of cumin.

I don’t normally do reviews but wow! This was amazing. Because I’m lazy I used 1 can drained rotel instead of tomatoes, 2 large jalapeños for the pepper and 1/2 cup real lime bottled juice for the lime. Plus added a 1/2 tsp or so of cumin. Just because I love it. Omg will be making this again and again. Thank you for your submission!

This soup was absolutely delicious. Since I don't like picante, I left out the hot peppers and it was still wonderful. Next time I'll try it with some hot pepper flakes.

This soup is so good!  I’ve made it with and without chicken (using veggie broth instead of chicken broth, too) and it is delicious both ways.  When I make it meatless, I add an extra onion and tomato, and it comes out great.

So delicious! I used the smaller Persian limes and it was not too tart at all, just pleasantly lime-y. If you are using larger limes, depending on how juicy they are you might only need 2 or 3.
I am definitely topping the leftovers with diced avocado as suggested by another reviewer.
If you enjoy chicken soup at your local Mexican restaurant, you will love this recipe!

I love this soup.  My family is not a big fan of lime, so I cut it back to just one juicy lime.  This is a very versatile recipe.  If you have a can of pinto or black beans, rinse them and toss them in.  Fire roasted tomato goes well as do zucchini and yellow squash

Absolutely delicious!  I added some fried corn tortilla strips, and it reminded me of being in Mexico.

Terrible bitter after taste. The only thing I changed in this recipe was I added was one ear of corn cut from cob.  I don't know if the cut lime added to the soup caused it but the whole pot was ruined.

Very nice flavor. I made 1/2 a recipe as I’m just cooking for myself. It will make some nice lunches for the week.

I added one yellow squash and half of a zucchini to put more bite in the soup.  Topped it off with fried corn tortillas, Mexican Crema, and queso Fresca.  It was great!

It should be obvious from the name of the soup, but this soup has a very strong lime taste. I loved it.

This was a hit with our family. Lots of flavour. The one thing I would change it to chop the red onion into much smaller pieces. Just quartering it left large unappetizing chunks.

This was an amazing recipe with lots of robust flavors. I modified it in a few places. I like some heat so I added a chopped Jalapeno  pepper in place of the  green chili pepper.  Also, I made up a fresh bowl of  black bean & corn salsa to add in  to the soup once it was in my bowl! It was a great addition!

Great base recipe for an amazing vegetarian soup for my daughter. Traded out the chocked for firm tofu with no problems. Served it with chopped avocado, shredded Colby cheese and tortilla strips.

I love soups and this one is a winner! It got rave reviews from everyone and I will definitely make it again.  I simplified the recipe purely for time-saving.  I used a small (398 ml) can of diced tomatoes, lime juice concentrate (12 tbsp) and chile pepper paste instead of fresh.  I also added a half of a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) to make the soup more of a meal.

I used 14 cups stock instead of 9, and when I added the tomato mix I also added 6 cups of water, 1 cup wild rice, and 2 cups white rice.  The extra water was to counteract the excess steam being released while the rice was cooking.  This increased the number of servings to 12.

I can't thank you enough for posting this recipe. I had a recipe which was extremely similar to this which I copied out of a cookbook when I was in high school. The recipe made it through several moves to different apartments. I made it for my now-husband when we had just started dating, and he loved it. My husband doesn't get excited about very much at all, but he loved this soup. Well after getting married and moving to our first apartment together, I found I had lost the recipe! I've been hunting for it online ever since. The only major difference is the addition of green bell pepper. And the onion, garlic, peppers (both the bell peppers and the two serranos I used for the "green chilies") get sauteed in vegetable oil after cooking the chicken in stock. Then I add the stock back in, add the tomatoes, shredded chicken, and all the seasonings (which- I love this blend of flavors- super bright citrus but underneath that is a very full-flavor broth!) I made a batch and a half, remembering how quickly we went through this soup- and it just barely fit in my large stockpot. It did need more lime juice than the recipe calls for- not sure how much I used, but after juicing 9 limes I just got out the squeeze bottle of lime juice- and a little bit more salt. This is a winner and so happy to have found it again- THANK YOU!!

Made this up at home, simply threw everything into a crock pot, left it on low for 6 hours, shredded the chicken when it was done. After reading some other reviews I only added 4 limes, it was still a bit strong, will only go with 2.5 to 3 next time. Also, simply used a 14oz can of diced tomatos. A good simple recipe, a tasty spin on plain old chicken soup.

Amazing.  Just follow the recipe exactly.  I served it with rice on the side to put into the soup.  You could choose tacos or some other starchy accompaniment, if you are going to use this as a one-dish meal.  Just serve a starter Mexican salad.  Belva in Winnipeg.

This recipe is delicious!  I love the fresh taste of the chile with the cilantro.  I made some corn bread with a half can of sweet corn and another chile to go along with it.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone up for a light, refreshing dinner!

Very intense lime flavor- my husband and I both couldn't believe that it took 6 limes, but we followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  It was so easy and quick to make.  We will definitely add this to our "short list" of recipes!

This is a great recipe with tons of flavor and it got better on the second day. A very light and refreshing soup, even during the Florida summer!
