This was fantastic!  I added a tad bit of cayenne for a little kick.  I only made 1/2 the recipe to try it out.  Didn't need all the lime juice.  Only used 1/2 of 1 lime.  Will add more pineapple next time.  My 11 year old daughters loved this.  Will make it again and again.

I made this exactly as written and think it's very good, but suspect that it will be better as a relish than a dip. I'm going to try the leftovers on fish tacos.

I used canned pineapple & less tomato & it was sooooo good! Also what's guac without green onion? I put lots of that as well.

Has anyone made this the day before except for adding the avocados?  Just wondering if I can do that and add the avocados before serving.
