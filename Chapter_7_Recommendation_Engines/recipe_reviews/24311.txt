Sinfully delicious!  The cinnamon adds a wonderful flavor, and the chopped walnuts made it perfect.  I doubled the recipe and used the 8x8 dish to make it thicker; then cut it in 1” squares.  In doubling the recipe I used the whole 2# bag of confectioners’ sugar and did not measure.  A note about the troubles others may have had:  When it says butter don’t use margarine or spread; milk means “vitamin D” milk, not 2% or skim; and *always* sift confectioners’ sugar unless a recipe explicitly states “unsifted”, then resift with the cocoa and cinnamon.  Both the confectioners’ sugar and cocoa tend to lump.

If you use real butter, good vanilla, and sift the dry ingredients (measure the sugar before sifting), there is no problem with either the flavor or consistency. This couldn't be any easier, since it isn't cooked....if you don't like the consistency *add more powdered sugar*!! It does make a very small quantity so double the recipe for an 8" pan.

This is not a boiled fudge, therefore it doesn't have the same quality, but it doesn't mean it's not yummy. I put a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon (because I love the stuff!) and no nuts as I didn't have any. I am making it again to take to work this week (it was a hit at my craft club!). I took a shortcut, I microwaved the butter and then added the milk to it, I use skim milk powder to make my milk, and used a wee bit more powder than what is required for 1/4 cup of milk. I sifted all my ingredients in a bowl, mixed them gently, and then added butter/milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stirred with a wooden spoon until all was homogenous. I then poured it in a baking paper lined bread tin, so I had a nice thick fudge (as opposed to more pieces and thinner) which I cut in about 1/2 in. squares.
This recipe's a keeper!! (wonder what it would taste like with different spices instead of cinnamon!)

Sorry this is a bit long... I had a fight with myself over the rating for this one.  It didn't set for me, even after putting it in the freezer.  After sitting for a few days in the fridge it got as far as not being runny but still never set -- no way I could cut it.  However, without thinking, I used lower fat margarine and thought perhaps that was the problem, but I see that a few others had this same problem.  Perhaps it needs real butter and some people don't use it?  I also thought it a bit too sweet, even for fudge.  But, the flavor was fabulous -- I'm not a big fudge fan and have never made it but was curious what cinnamon fudge would be like.  Since it didn't set right, I just occasionally grab a spoonful. :-)  IF I decide to try it again I will use real butter and see what happens.  As for a few comments I saw about the sugar not disolving -- I had no problems with this.  I *always* sift confectioners' sugar -- maybe the recipe should explicitly state to do this.

After reading all the mixed reviews I played around with the recipe just a tad. I added extra con. sugar until it thickened up nicely ( as in the recipe for the vegan fudge if anyone has used it) We like our fudge a but more on the gritty side vs. the creamy side. I did add a larger amount of cinnamon since it is titled "cinnamon fudge" =) I literally just made it and it's now in the fridge. Will have to do a follow up on it later since I made it for our party this evening. Right now the 4 stars are for ease of making the fudge.

A bit hard to get the confectioner's sugar to completely dissolve.  Either sift it first or use a hand mixer.  It still tasted great however - and I did use a full teaspoon of china cassia cinnamon.  Very tasty - I'd make it agian.

Very easy to make. Also, tastes great. Quick, except you have to wait an hour for it to set.

This was an easy, quick and really good fudge.  It has a smooth, light cinnamon taste.  It's not quite as good as conventional fudge using condensed milk but it was second best.  I will make it again for sure.  This recipe doesn't make a lot of fudge, I would probably double it next time.  I used a whisk to mix it together to eliminate any lumps. It also needs to stay refrigerated, as it gets super soft when it stays out for more than an hour.

I don't know what I did wrong but I could not get the fudge to solidify, it was more like icing than fudge.

Hm, I don't know what I did but our fudge was a bit "floury" because of the confectioners sugar and it was way to sweet (even for a fudge) and tasted less like cinnamon or chocolate. :(

Very good, very easy to make. I don't like nuts, so I left those out and it came out fine. I used an 8" pie pan and it made the pieces a little bit thicker, I think.

UPDATE: I've also made orange fudge with this recipe. Instead of ground cinnamon, use orange extract, and add it with the vanilla extract in step 3 (when butter is melted) rather than in step 2 with the other dry stuff. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons, the same as for the vanilla, and that gave it a distinct orange flavor. (If you want a subtler flavor, try 1 teaspoon instead.)

Super easy to make - my ten year old sister could do it. I cheated slightly by heating the milk and butter in the microwave and then mixing it into the sugar/cocoa mix; I also left out the walnuts and used about three times as much cinnamon (because I loooooove cinnamon). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. 

Definitely double the recipe, though. I didn't because I was just testing it out (and I didn't have enough cocoa left), but it doesn't make much as it is.

Okay, I've never made fudge before, so maybe I'm totally missing something, but this turned out to be much closer to the consistency of icing than fudge...or at least what I remember fudge to be, considering the last time I had it was on an 8th grade field trip to St. Augustine. Regardless, the stuff barely hardened in my fridge and had to be eaten with a spoon. Maybe the fact that I used rice milk instead of cow's milk made a huge difference, though I doubt it.

Easy and tasty. That's my type of recipe! I added a bit more cinnamon than what the original recipe calls for and also added a touch of cardamom because I like the combination. ETA: For anyone having problems with grainy texture or "lumps" of powdered sugar, I found that sifting the powdered sugar before adding it to the butter/milk mixture helps to smooth it out considerably. /edit 
 Next time I'll add some instant coffee or Via from Starbucks so it gives a mocha flavor to the fudge.

This fudge came out flat and tasting decidedly odd. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't what I expected from fudge. Even so, I'd give it another star if the recipe didn't flatten out into such a thin sheet of confection.

I used real butter and had to substitute light cream (didn't have milk) and worked beautifully!   I'll increase the cinnamon a bit next time just because it's a lovely taste in this fudge and not something I would've thought to try - thanks so much!

Doesn't set perfectly (a bit softer than typical fudge), but otherwise great flavour, the cinnamon is yum, matches walnuts well. Might try reducing the milk a titch to have it set better...? Using it for gifts this Christmas, I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan!

AWESOME! I really like how simple it was, as it was the first fudge I had ever made, and no baking ( I didn't have time to bake)!!! It turned out purfect!!  It was VERY sweet, though so i might put less confectioners' sugar in next time, or just mix it up better. (I do know that my confectioners' sugar seemed kinda clumpy). I liked the cinnamon it, it added flavor, but i might put less in next time. But it was overall pretty good! Way to go! :)

Easy and quite good. I was worried the fudge would be two thin, but it was perfect. My Dad suggested it would be good without the cinnamon too, just as a basic fudge.

My mom made this yesterday we thought it sounded interesting.  She said it was very easy.  It tastes just like hot chocolate with cinnamon.  Hummm!

Tasted nice but came out runny.  I had to throw it out.  But, I am definitely not a cooking pro.

It had a nice flavor but it came out wet and loose.  It was also really flat.

So quick and easy it's unbelievable that it's so yummy.  I also doubled the ingredients to get a good thick layer of fudge.  Although it set after an hour the real cinnamon flavour only came through the next day and the texture was better then too.

I thought this fudge was excellent! Easy to make and very smooth. Unlike fudge that must be cooked, this was smooth, creamy and stayed moist. I will definately make it again!

I took a sample batch to a friend's house--- everyone that tried it said it was VERY good (someone even ate it with ice cream!), and I'll give it 5 stars simply because it was SO easy to make, and I can't stop eating it myself! Thanks so much!!

What an unbelievable waste of time and ingredients. I followed this recipe to a T and ended up with a dry, crumbly mess. It never dissolved, it was never smooth and it went straight into the trash.

This is an easy fudge, I would double it too. Gave it a "3" only because of consistency. Have to keep it refrigerated or its sticky. Love cinnamon chocolate flavor.

I had no problems with this recipe. The only change I made was to add extra cinnamon, and it still isn't enough (I really love cinnamon)... and I didn't leave it in the fridge long enough (I was impatient). I am definitely going to make this again, but not often or I'll be 400 pounds! (lol)

I made this today for a snack for a jewelry party I was hosting and it was very tasty!  It set up fine and the cinnamon flavor was noticeable but subtle - not overpowering.  There were a couple of white spots where I didn't mix it well because I didn't sift my powdered sugar, but it certainly didn't keep it from tasting good.  And it was very quick and easy to make.

I think this is FROSTING, not fudge. Letting it sit at room temperature long enough will make it easily spreadable.

Love this recipe!  Quick and easy with ingredients on hand.  My favorite substitute is 1/4 cup almond butter and 1/4 cup butter with a full teaspoon of cinnamon...Yum.

Super simple, super good!  I used real butter and it set up just fine!  Love the cinnamon in it...I also used peanuts instead of walnuts, and the kids loved it.

Yum-yum-yum.  I was expecting something cinnabar-coloured and spicy, but then I realised it was only mildly spiced regular fudge.  It smelled a little like cocoanut, but maybe that is just my impression?

I thought this tasted like and had the consistency of overly sweet chocolate icing that has sat in the fridge. We just did not like this one. It didn't seem anything like the kind of fudge we like or are used to.

I wasn't at all happy with the results of this recipe.  I had planned to take it to a party and it was a soft blob after overnight refrigeration.

I'm not sure what I did wrong....The taste was very delicious, but it never would set for me. I even stuck it in the freezer. It stayed runny and gooey. Would like to try this agin if anyone can tell me how to harden it up.

This was VERY easy to make and tasted great!  I would not use the foil in the pan as the fudge didn't harden like I expected it, but we loved it and it will be made again.
