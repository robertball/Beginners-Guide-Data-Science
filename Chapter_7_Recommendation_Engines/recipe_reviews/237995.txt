I am SOOOO picky about Alfredo sauce and this is the #! best recipe I have ever tasted. Don't waste your time on any other sauce. This one is smooth, creamy, flavorful and worth every effort, which is small, to make this amazing gravy of the Gods. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

LOVED IT!!!!! This was so easy to make and the flavor was fantastic! I used black pepper b/c I don't have white on hand. I was worried about the mozzarella, but it melted beautifully and added a nice touch to the sauce. I served this over mini penne...a definite keeper for this alfredo lover~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Oh.My.GOODNESS!!!

This is so good!!! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so i improvised and it STILL Came out delicious. 

I used regular Whole Milk instead of whipping cream. 
2tbs of garlic powder instead of minced garlic. 
I tripled the butter. 
and I only used Parmesan cheese since i didnt have any mozzarella on hand. 
I also added about 2tbs of flour at the end for thickening. 

Even with my changes, it was amazing! Just like Olive Garden! 

Saved this one for future use.

Yes, yes, yes!  I love alfredo sauces when I go out, but before now have never found a recipe I could master in my own kitchen.  Creamy and quick and actually worked pretty well as leftovers.  My only tweak was to substitute 1/2 cup whole milk for 1/2 cup of the cream (to lighten just a little).  I used wet mozzarella and it melted just fine.  I served with sauteed chicken and steamed broccoli tossed in.  Excellent.

Really delicious, and agrees with it's title. I used only shredded Parmesan because that was all I had and it was still great. This will definitely be my go-to Alfredo sauce now.

Family gobbled it all up!  I sauteed garlic and onions in olive oil and butter for a bit more flavor, used the Italian blend shredded cheese, then a pinch of nutmeg.  A definite must do again recipe :)

Good taste. It was a little lumpy, but I feel that was probably my error in not simmering it long enough before I added the mozzarella. I used very little parmesan (maybe 2 tbs) and upped the mozzarella to 1 cup. I also added salt and pepper liberally because it was a bit bland to me. This was so, so much better than the store bought jars of Alfredo, which taste and smell like a dirty gym sock.

I LOVE IT!!!! most of my trips to Olive Garden is for Alfredo. Well, now I am saving the money and the trip by doing it at home..Which is one of my goals. (Eat more at home than not) This is now in normal rotation in our kitchen menu at home. i have made this several times and the only difference is it doesnt seem to take the full 8-10 minutes for my cheese to melt and stir in.. maybe mine is shredded finer or my heat is a tad bit higher but either way it comes out AWESOME every time..

I typically cook some cubed chicken breast in a skillet and stir it into the Alfredo sauce right before serving. I also use Fettuccini noodles. I will upload a picture tonight.. Its whats for dinner

Omg, this recipe was better than sex!! the only thing i would change is to double the recipe because my family of three including myself had a second bowl and it was completly gone! um i forgot the white pepper so i used the black pepper i had on hand and i worked just fine. i also, in a separate sauce pan sauteed some garlic, mushroom, and sun dried tomato in butter, with a splash  of sherry and the rest of heavy whipping cream that was left over in the carton it was amazing!!!!! the sun dried tomato added a little tang to the dish and the mushroom mixture kind of elevated the already delicious sauce i just love mushroom and SDT so i try to find a way to add it to anything lol but the sauce was amazing all on its own my 6yr old literally licked the bowl!!!

This was very good! I somehow managed to run out of fresh garlic without realizing it (blasphemy!! that never happens in my house!), so I had to use garlic powder (SADFACE). I also didn't have any white pepper - I normally don't - so I used black, but the flavor was great! Mine did not turn out creamy; it has a slight chunkiness to it, but I suspect that was my use of bagged preshredded Parmesan cheese and bagged preshredded mozzarella cheese, both of which would contain an anti-caking agent, which is why bagged cheeses don't melt as well. It wasn't a chunkiness like broken sauce chunkiness, it was very slight and seemed more like the cheese was refusing to melt properly.

I liked this but the reason I am giving it 2 stars is because I was planning on having the leftovers for lunch the next day.  As I reheated the sauce I could plainly see where the cheese/butter/oil were separating. I stirred and stirred and stirred and the sauce never came together again. I will stick with my all time favorite Alfredo Sauce Recipe from this site.

Ok so I used 8 oz of mozzarella instead of 12. It was REALLY THICK at that point so I added some milk to thin it out a little. But my family loved it. Next time I'll use half and half instead of heavy cream. But delicious! I'll definitely make it again

Made this for my family tonight. It was good but not knock my socks off. I used the Angel Hair and I think that noodle just ain't right for this sauce. I added chicken and broccoli.  It was good. Next time will use a different noodle and add salt.

Delicious! Made it for my incredibly picky fiancee who loves the Olive Garden alfredo.  He tasted it and (without seeing the name of the recipe) immediately stated that it's better than Olive Garden, and that I should make more.  It's very good.  My only regret is not doubling the recipe because we won't have enough for leftovers now - its too good

My cheese did not melt into the sauce and came out clumpy. It should also state the you should stir constantly, because otherwise the cheese sinks to the bottom and sticks to your pot.

I will NEVER use Alfredo sauce that is premade and bottled. This sauce was so simple to make! I used it in a basic macaroni and cheese and it was delicious! I'm going to make a second batch and take it to work for our pot luck!

I love this recipe. It was so easy to make, it almost scared me away. Since the title mentioned "Olive Garden", which is my husband's favorite restaurant, I had to try it. I compared it to a lot of other alfredo recipes and chose to try this one. The only change I made was adding black pepper, garlic powder, italian seasoning & a bit of paprika to the chicken & sauce. I aslo make sure to leave the sauce, chicken and noodles separated until I serve, so the sauce doesn't get soaked up.

This was my first time to make alfredo sauce homemade & it was soo simple. The only thing i did different was use black pepper instead of white bc i didn't have any. But it was still so good. Thank you for this recipe! (:

Excellent recipe!  For the first step, simmering the cream, took about 10 minutes but I may have used a lower heat.  Used small chunks of mozzarella and parmesan and let them melt slowly so I think step 2 ended up taking twice the time.  Spooned over pasta and was delicious.  Can't wait to make again!

Yummy! I didn't have sweet butter so I added 2 tsp of white sugar. I also topped it off with sun dried tomatoes and added chicken.

Wow, that was delicious.

Seems like a great recipe. Only change is I let the garlic cook in the olive oil and butter on low heat for a minute before adding the cream, seemed to bring out the flavor. Yum.

Don’t think this recipe should’ve called for “heavy” whipping cream as the cream turned out way too thick. The sauce also wasn’t flavorful in that the recipe didn’t call for salt or pepper.   Very bland.

Disappointed.  Mozzarella and spaghetti? Mozzarella should never be in the sauce, and the spaghetti isn’t able to absorb the sauce as well as the fettuccine

We enjoyed this rich and tasty sauce.  (The amount of seasonings will depend on your cheese and personal taste.)  I used it to make Pan-Seared Cod, Broccoli, and Mushrooms with Creamy Alfredo Sauce on this site and the family enjoyed it a lot.

I used a full-fat semi-soft mozzarella cheese which melted nicely along with grated fresh parmesan, not dried. The amount of the cheeses you use is flexible. Don't skimp on the simmer/stirring time and add a big splash of good white wine toward the end and you'll have a wonderful sauce for fish or chicken.

If I try to hold the sauce too long it will separate out some. Then a brisk whisking will temporarily combine the cheese into the sauce again.

Absolutely the BEST alfredo sauce I've had, either homemade or in a restaurant. Love how cheesy it is. I didn't have sweet butter so used regular and tossed in a pinch of sugar.  Also added a bit of parsley partway through. Will be making this everytime I want alfredo from here on out!

I loved this recipe! Was very easy to make and came out very smooth and creamy! Personally I like a little stronger garlic flavor (more than the average person), so I think I might add a little bit more garlic next time, but that's just me! My boyfriend who isn't even a fan of cream sauce tasted it and said it was yummy! I will definitely use this recipe from now on.

Pretty good. Not sure how it compares to Olive Garden, but very good, nonetheless. I would make it again, either as a sauce to go with pasta & chicken or just as a mac & cheese-type thing.

I am a novice cook and I impressed my whole family with this sauce. I recommend using Parmigiano-Reggiano for the best flavor (it is aged longer than "parmesan" you typically find in the store).

I don't think I've ever used this word before in a recipe review, but this was a "gloppy" mess. The mozzarella is the culprit. When poured over my fettuccine, it looked like a cheese pizza. Never again and certainly not worth the calories.

Best alfredo sauce I've ever had. Tastes exactly like Olive Garden's sauce. Normally that may be considered an insult by some, but olive garden's sauces are actually made from scratch in the restaurant so in this case its a compliment.

It was delicious and easy to make.  Jarred stuff is no comparison.  I made it as directed on the recipe, I might have added a tiny bit more cheese.  I also chopped up some fresh parsley and added it when I added the mozzarella cheese.  I purchased the 5 cheese tortellini at Costco and it went wonderfully with that.  A cheese lover's delight for sure.  Served it with some stringless snap peas that I also purchased at Costco.  I am sure that something so delicious was horribly fattening... good thing I skipped lunch!  Thank you very much for sharing your recipe.  It's a keeper!

I have tried many alfredo recipes and this is the best one yet.  I made as written.  You really have to stir the length of times in the directions.  As much as I didn't want to stand stirring that long, it's a must.  I did find it needed some salt, but other than that it was perfect.  I added frozen grilled chicken from the store after defrosting and warning in microwave into the sauce just before serving.  Will add broccoli or squash next time.

Also, this was the first time I used angle hair pasta and was surprised how well it works.  Will be making many more times and will look no further for great alfredo sauce.

Not better than Olive Garden. Do not believe this recipe. It tastes like a basic NO flavor cream sauce. Not any where near enough spices or flavor. Sure the technique is there, but where this recipe lacks is not only the amount of seasoning, but the garlic should have been sweated before adding the cream. Also, More garlic!~ This recipe should have defined a suggestion of how to prepare the garlic and offer something more of an exact measurement.

This turned out really good and it was easy to make. It gets really thick as it cools. I think next time I'll try using half of the cheese to see if it makes the sauce less thick. Overall it was very yummy and I had enough leftover to refrigerate.

I used half and half for half of the cream and milk for the other. I made a double recipe. It tasted super amazing with smokes turkey and smoked pepper. For some reason the Parmesan didn't melt so it tasted really grainy. Had to add som cornstarch to thicken due to lack of cream. Otherwise delicious!

Great recipe!  No way you have to cook it that long, 5-6 mins tops or it will be too thick.

This is awesome! It tasted really good. I added a drop or two of balsamic vinegar and it was so good! I used mozzarella instead of Parmesan and it was beautiful.

Made this for my son's basketball team dinner (20 teenagers).  They raved about it!   Always good to please a crowd of hungry boys.  Recipe was easy to follow and turned out rich and creamy with plenty of flavor!  Definitely a new favorite!

This has a great flavor and consistency.  However when warming it up the next day for leftovers, it  had a sour appearance.  It didn't taste sour.  The flavor was still delicious.  I chalked the appearance up to the fact that I stuck it in the microwave to reheat it and went on to prepare other parts of our dinner.  Next time I will attempt to reheat it on the stove and pay closer attention.

I followed the recipe and it was very good. The only thing I thought it was not creamy enough. Next time I will either use half as much cream or double the cheese.  I did make this again and I used about  a cup of mozzarella and about a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and it was much better. Made it with fettuccine and shrimp.

This was absolutely delicious!  The key to success is to freshly grate your Parmesan cheese yourself.  Do not think the shaker bottle style grated Parmesan will work, it won't.  You will end up with a lumpy glop of goo.

Was good...I used 1/2 cup butter rather than butter & olive oil. Eat it up, not so good as a leftover. I add italian seasoned chicken strips every time I make it for a more complete meal.

I liked it but hubby wasn't a fan, especially for leftovers the following night (it doesn't reheat the best).  You need to whisk it well after adding the mozzarella cheese to avoid clumps.  This will result in a nice smooth sauce.

This is by far the best alfredo sauce Ive tasted. Restaurants don't even make it this good. Ive tried a lot of alfredo recipes and this is way better then any of them. From now on this will be the only alfredo recipe I will use.

Yep, this recipe tastes as great a everyone says!  No need to change anything.    I added the "Marinated Grilled Shrimp" from this site which also was fantastic as is!   And of course, that's bacon you see with the sauteed tomatoes and basil.  If I keep cooking from this site, I may not get to go out to dinner any time soon...lol.   Thanks for the recipes!!

I've never had Olive Garden's Alfredo Sauce, so I can't compare this recipe to theirs, but this is definitely a 5 star recipe. When making the sauce, I did add another clove of garlic, as we love garlic. Also, I found I didn't have to simmer the sauce for 8 to 10 minutes, after I added the grated parmesan cheese. Mine had thickened within 3 minutes, but I decided to let simmer for 5, and after I added the mozzarella, it melted into the sauce within 30 seconds. I served this over Linguine which I boiled for 11 minutes. Love this recipe, and I will definitely make it again, but I wish there was a way to keep both sauce and noodles 'hot' after being served on a plate!

This Alfredo sauce was delicious, I did not have heavy cream so I used half& half. I also added cubed chicken breast and broccoli florets at the end, then I added the fettuccine. I highly recommend this, my family loved it.

A very rich and creamy sauce. At my wife's request I added 1 can of coarsely chopped ripe olives and a couple of minced shallots. We had it on whole grain fettuccine. It was very good,  but I would leave out the olives next time.

I used a pkg of  Alfredo mix  as a starter. Adding fresh cream and milk to the recipe, as well as much too much butter,parmesan, chopped mini-peppers,mushrooms and onion. Chopped parsley wound up in the mix, as well as a small bit of chopped spinach, garlic, chicken broth, cream cheese and lemon juice,white pepper, pepper flakes and dill weed.  Need I tell you how good it was?

I do keto so I substitute veggie noodles for the pasta but use the exact same recipe for the sauce itself. I have to make a big batch because everyone loves it and I'm always craving more later!

Exactly as stated, it’s THE closest, the actual difference in flavor is undetectable, to the chain brand version!!! Mute or exaggerate any of the ingredients as desired! No jar alfredo comes remotely “close”

This is really good, really rich. My suggestion - use a heavier tube pasta such as rigatoni. The delicate angel hair gets lost in the sauce.

Upon adding mozzarella I stirred for a solid 7 minutes and the sauce was still gritty also pretty bland, I added a little italian seasoning but it didn't help.

The recipe is great! I've ordered alfredo only a few times (and first time making it) but was looking for a recipe to use the remaining heavy whipping cream I had from the penne al vodka (allrecipes).  I may have reduced the sauce too much as mine turned out on the thicker side. Or maybe it was because I used penne pasta but it was still very favorful. I definitely will make again. Thanks for sharing!

My absolute favorite Alfredo sauce! Once you have homemade, the jar or anything else is disgusting. My family asks for this quite often. I highly recommend trying this. I promise you will not be disappointed.

For me this didn't compare to Olive Garden. I still love theirs the best so from that stand point it was disappointing. However, we did like it as far as Alfredo sauce in general goes. It was creamy and cheesy which was a plus. For me it was a little too garlicy, but I think the clove I used was extra large. I figure I might make it again if we have the hankering for Alfredo and no reason to drive an hour to the nearest Olive Garden for it.

This was so easy to make & sooo delicious!! I did do a few different things only because I just used what I had on hand already. I used egg noodles & black pepper instead of white pepper & salted butter instead of sweet butter. I also added a little bit of cayenne pepper for a kick. And I added shrimp & sausage. So basically a shrimp & sausage Alfredo. It was fabulous! My boyfriend loved it also.

Tasty but mine didn't thicken very much. First batch I made, cheese clumped and didn't thicken but I substituted coconut oil for olive (since it was "more handy" than my olive oil). Second batch made with olive oil didn't clump but it didn't thicken any more than the first batch.

Other than the oil change, I stuck with the recipe as written. Flavor was wonderful. Hubby loved even the clumpy one cuz the taste was so delicious. 

I'll keep trying to figure out the thickening factor because this is a super-simple and tasty recipe.

Used garlic power instead of garlic. Couldn’t find the white pepper at the store-so left pepper put all together! Was awesome!! I would say very very close to Olive Garden....maybe better!! 
*I did add some pram after in my bowl (pictured)

I made this for dinner tonight along with chicken cordon bleu.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I mixed 1 1/2 cups of milk with 1/2 cup of butter  (a common substitute as per a Google search) to make the 2 cups. I made this as stated in the recipe but there was way too much liquid.  I  added double both cheeses and even a roux.  It was  still too wet and the cheese did not melt well and it was lumpy.  It tasted ok but not great. I have used other alfredo sauce recipes from this site with much better results.

All I have to say is WOW. I was skeptical at first but took a chance and its fantastic! VERY RICH and I used half and half, also I didn't use mozzarella at all only parm . No flour and it turned out the perfect consistency! I added a touch of garlic powder and salt. The directions are spot on. I didn't really measure the ingredients I eyeballed it and it still turned out great! No more buying alfredo sauce! Thank you!

Adding the mozzarella is a total waste as it sticks to the bottom of the pan becomes rubbery and makes the dish clumpy. Also the olive oil isn't necessary at all. This doesn't even taste as half as good as olive gardens recipe they have online and is extremely unhealthy due to the high fat content. I tried it 3 different times following the directions to a T and the results were always disappointing. I tweaked the recipe omitting the olive oil and adding romano cheese instead of the mozzarella and it was a little better but nothing close to as good as olive gardens recipe. Black pepper is a must and 2 cups of cream is too much.

I was so skeptical of the mozzerella cheese but my husband liked this recipe soooo much! Make it just as the directions indicate. The second time I made it I added more mozzerella and it was way too gooey. It worked fine with both high quality parmesan and the green canister stuff.  This will be my go to Alfredo Sauce now. :)

Decent flavor. The mozzarella got very clumpy. If I tried this again I would just use extra parm in place of mozzarella.

Okay, I made it as written. I found the taste a bit bland compared to my wife's Alfredo sauce. The biggest difference is that she uses twice the Romano cheese and no mozz.  I like that this one uses much less butter than hers tho' (1/2 cup of butter!) for less calories. I will try again and double the Romano cheese (I don't like Parmesan as much). Oh, and she uses ground nutmeg and no pepper.

Lovely! And that's even with me using only what I had available on hand at home, dried garlic seasoning and garlic salt in place of fresh garlic and a cup of milk with a cup of cream since I didn't have enough cream left in my fridge for the full amount. I expect it would be a 6-star recipe followed exactly as is!

I made the sauce just as written (added mushrooms and chicken for the dish). Next time I’m going to omit the mozzarella because it melts stringy. This tasted great though.

A little slice of heaven!  In another pan I browned 2 diced chicken breasts to which I added S & P and a liberal amount of cayenne pepper.  After browning,  I added the sauce to the chicken.  The best cajun chicken evah!

I read a bunch of reviews before trying this recipe and used several of their suggestions.  My husband said it was really good -- and that my friends is HIGH praise from him!  I added a lot more garlic and some garlic salt to taste.  I also only used butter instead of butter and the olive oil.  The sauce became way too thick after adding the mozzerella so I added more cream.  I also stirred constantly and that helped to cream everything together.  Will be making this again.

The sauce separated even though I kept the heat low. It must have still been too hot. I drained olive oil of the separated mixer but it wasn't what I had hoped for.

Very easy to make & delicious!  I saute'd  some onions, garlic and mushrooms.  Cut a chicken breast into strips seasoned with garlic, italian seasoning & cooked in a bit of olive oil & butter.  Made before the sauce.  Added all this to the sauce after following the directions.  It was great!

Be sure to add all the Parmesan cheese.
11-2018 Cut Rx in half. But used the same Rx amount for white pepper and parm cheese. It had more flavor. Add only 1T flour to butter to thicken it.

Turned out really good. We didn’t have the mozzarella so I added a bit more parm. I also added some caned peas, fresh broccoli and some Hatch chili. I poured it over some pasta ate it and fell asleep.

Very tasty - and versatile if you don't have the exact ingredients on hand.  I never seem to have cream; I substituted a mixture of evaporated milk and milk.  Turned our really delicious!  It is also easy to make.

This is absolutely the BEST Alfredo Sauce ever. So easy to make. I added chicken with the fettuccini noodles. I made enough for 8 for 4 people. All gone. Will use repeatedly in this house.

I enjoyed the taste , however even though I followed the instructions my sauce came out to be more of a cheesy thick dip for bread . Next time I plan on cutting down on the mozzarella since that was what turned it into one solid cheesy mass that slid around the pan when I tried stirring it. But overall not bad tasting at all.

Made this with a few tweaks. I used butterkause cheese instead of Mozzerella, added asiago, and a pinch of italian seasoning mix. used more heavy cream and cheese total and it came out amazing. Added fresh peas and chicken with fettuccine noodles for more of a bite.

It turned out great! I Tossed everything with a addition of spinach & a pinch of Italian seasoning in the sauce. I’ve also made as a casserole with shredded cooked chicken    topped with Romano & parmesan  cheese.

Loved this recipe....making it again tonight!(The only negative is that it needs to be doubled if you have big eaters.  There was enough for me and my young granddaughters, but hubby is a big eater, so I will be making a double batch. If you don't have white pepper, it's OK to use regualr. This is really really good over any pasta. (I'm going to try with half and half on my second try. Will let you know how it goes.
*note: do not use half and half and do not use grated parmesan.  Very grainy with both! (still good though)

Horrible.  Cheese clumped up badly,  and separated from the rest of the sauce. So I was left was huge clumps of cheese in a runny mixture of liquid, none of which stuck to the pasta.

Pro tip!  I made this almost as described but had romano instead of moz.  That was fine, and I also added shrimp and broccoli.  Here is the Protip...  Remove the shells off the shrimp!!!  Doh!!  I did not check them and just dumped them in and got to doing something else, and so I had a bit more work peeling them while eating!  Still VERY yummy though!!!

This is pretty good. Don’t cook it too long or the sauce will get too thick. I also added broccoli.

Oh my! The house smells like The Olive Garden Restaurant!

I made the recipe as written with the addition of 1 can of evaporated milk, and topped up the Mozzarella to 1 cup. I stirred it throughout the cooking time. At the end we tossed in 2 cups of chopped rotisserie chicken breast and a cup of cooked peas. We added cooked fettuccini noodles to the sauce and mixed thoroughly.
Myself, hubby and 3 teenagers gobbled it up! Yum! Will be making again!

I may have made a mistake somewhere in this recipe.  I wound up adding cheese,  (Nearly double the amount called for), in order to get the sauce to thicken, and I doubled the amount of garlic and felt that it could have stood more yet.

I simmered the original recipe for 8 minutes or so and it wasn't thickening and so added cheese to get it to thicken.

Very delicious and surprisingly easy! *One note after reading another review - you MUST STIR! Or it will be a little clumpy -
 alas, that is the way with cheese. 

My husband LOVES Olive Garden's Alfredo Sauce and (since I first made this a couple months ago) has asked for it for dinner once a week! (Not exaggerating - I had to limit us to avoid too much pasta). 

The few alterations I did (just for our personal taste) is: I added garlic salt throughout the cooking process (probably two coatings on top overall) and (in addition to the Parmesan) added a tad (maybe a quarter cup?) of shredded Parmesan Romano & Asiago cheese. We love the multi-colored bow tie pasta so often use that instead of (or with!) angel air. I also fry some freshly chopped mushrooms in butter and steam a head of broccoli and add these on top of my pasta before I add the Alfredo Sauce - they help break up the cheesiness and allow me to say I'm eating veggies with the meal! :) 

My only issue: reheating the leftovers. I end up taking them to work and heating the sauce in the microwave, which means all that oil and butter settles on top. I try to ignore the grossness and just dump it out; I have since used a little less of both when cooking the sauce.

I added 3/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano and about 2 cups sliced leftover rotisserie chicken breast. My husband had previously requested rotini if I made Alfredo, so I substituted for the angel hair. The sauce consistency was smooth,  creamy, and coated the pasta nicely. 

I served this with homemade Italian bread (still trying but getting closer to his Grandma's) and a Romaine salad. After the first bite, my husband said 'This is really good!' He was right - it was perfect! I will definitely make this again.

The last time I went to Olive Garden, the salad was wilted and the sampler entre was burned and cold!  How does that happen?  It was burned in the factory many miles away, packaged and shipped to this restaurant then it wasn't microwaved long enough to heat it thoroughly.  I refused to eat it, they threatened to call the police if I didn't pay for it then offered me a free dessert!  I laughed at their offer - as if dessert would be any better and promised to share my first and last visit to Olive Garden with all.
I grew up in an Italian neighborhood with many family owned Italian restaurants.  I know what good alfredo tastes like because I make my own.  I wouldn't give you a nickel for anything Olive Garden peddles.

Tasted good, the reason why I removed a star is because the sauce was not smooth because of the added shredded mozzarella cheese. Mozzarella cheese was stringy in the sauce :/ I would not add mozzarella next time.

Excellent sauce!  Only change I made was adding lots of Italian seasonings and herbs, cooked chicken, along with cutting the cream cheese by 1/2.
