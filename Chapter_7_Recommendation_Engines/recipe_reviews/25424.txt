This was a pretty good, "Base recipe", or a recipe that's easily modified.  As many others have done, I changed the bean to meat ratio a bit and added onion.  I've cooked for almost 30 years, 10+ as a professional chef.  In all this time I've never thought to add hamburger to baked beans.  Simple idea that works well.

  But I find it odd that so many people, (Including the author) refer to this as, "Chili".  It's not chili.  There are countless variations on chili, from  "Texas style", to, "Cincinnati style" and everything in between.  But one thing they all have in common is that they contain some sort of chile pepper, be it fresh, dried, paste, liquid, or whatever.  A green bell pepper doesn't really count for this one. There's a reason chili is called, "Chili"...It has to contain CHILE.

 It's funny how many people have either said that this is their favorite chili recipe or that it wasn't very good chili.  It's NOT chili and it's NOT supposed to be!  I recently tried a new chocolate cake recipe...It wasn't very good chili either...But my family thought it was the best chili they ever tasted! ;~}  I did really like the, "Slow Cooker Bean Casserole though.

My husband is a picky eater and he loved this.  He said it was the best chili I had ever made.  I did use maple syrup instead of molasses and I doubled the amount.  I also used prepared mustard instead of dry.  It was wonderful.  Thank you for this recipe!!!!!! Chantelle in Alabama

I used onions instead of green peppers, syrup instead of molasses and prepared mustard.  My family loved this...very similar to what my Mother-in-law use to make but she added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  This is also great for scout camp cookouts.  Just eat the chili on hamburger or hotdog buns.

I make this all the time on the stove top but last thing i do is put it in a 9 x 13 cake pan and put biscuits on top and bake in oven until golden browned. Or I have used homemade corn bread on top instead of biscuits. Either way this is one recipe to keep around.

Sorry, I was not impressed with this one.  It is not thick enough to be a casserole but too thick to be a chili. In addition, not sure how crazy we are about the taste.  Family was divided on it.  Either way, won't make again. Thanks anyways.

My Mom used to make this recipe when we were little, only she would add a can of stewed tomatos to it and would cut up red and green peppers (very small for our eagle eyes to miss).  We loved it and it was a meal that Mom could stretch her dollar with and it didn't come out of a box!

My husband really liked this and even my 2 year old ate most of hers.  I followed other's suggestions (mainly because those are the things I had on hand) and decreased the ground beef to 1 lb., used maple syrup in place of molasses, added 1/4 c. extra ketchup, used onion instead of bell pepper and doubled the baked beans.  I also added some hotdog - which was great for the texture.  Try it! :)

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I found it to be very flavourful and so simple to prepare. My husband and daughter hate bell peppers so i added corn and chopped onion instead.  I served it with some baked cheese bread and a garden salad.  The great thing about this dish is that it is very filling!!!

This gets five stars because my VERY VERY VERY picky seven year old liked this! I doubled the ammount of the baked beans, one can just didnt seem enough with all that meat. It was good, maybe what I would call kids chili. Adults used to a traditional, spicier chili, probably wont care for it too much. But what a hit with the kids! Next timt they want me to throw in some hot dogs. Whatever gets them to eat!

UPDATE: MADE THIS TO TAKE TO MY NEIGHBOR'S COOKOUT. MY BEANS HATING HUSBAND COMMENTED THAT HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE THESE AGAIN - WHOA! THIS TIME I ADDED 1/4 TSP. GARLIC POWDER / 1/2 TSP. CHILI POWDER (BECAUSE MY GROCER ONLY HAD MILD CHILI BEANS THIS TIME AROUND). I ALSO DID NOT DRAIN THE GREASE FROM MY (LEAN) BEEF AND I THINK THIS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. MK This was pretty good, however.... THIS IS NOT CHILI! Think of this as a side dish you’d take to a cookout / BBQ to serve alongside grilled meats. My fiance & I BBQ'd for friends yesterday. This was the perfect complement to our grilled sausages, pub burgers, corn on the cobb, pasta salad and apple pie. Not withstanding the temptation to “change things up a bit,” I too made some (slight) modifications. My fiance doesn’t care for beans (especially sweet bean dishes), but will eat them on occasion. To please his palate, I added a 16 oz. can of chili beans (medium heat) IN ADDITION TO my 15 oz. can of pork n’ beans. Since I thought 1.5 lbs. of ground beef was too much, I only used 1 lb. worth (my grocer only sells 1 lb. pkg. of beef, so that was another reason to cut some of it). My last change was to substitute a sm. yellow onion for the green pepper called for (didn't have the latter). I ended up adding about 1/4 c. of brown sugar to my beans to give them a very slight sweet taste (but not so much so that my hubs would turn up his nose lol!). Thanks for sharing, DKUENSCH! This will become a staple potluck dish for sure! :-)

This was soooo good! I used sea salt because it's better for you and added some red pepper for some spicy flavor. Delicious!

This is good but I wouldn't even stretch to call it "sweet" chiki.  It's pretty much glorified baked beans.  Great with brisket or bbq'd chicken

Simple and Delicious.  This dish proved to be a hit with the family.  As my family size is a little big, I added an extra 1/2 pound of ground beef, increased the molasses to 1/2 cup, increased baked beans to 22 ozs., and used 6 slices of bacon.  I omitted the dry mustard and green bell peppper as I had none on hand and I added chopped onions.  It was good and sweet.  I served in bowls over Cheese Fries!  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

We took this in thermos jars as lunch after the MLK march. It was fantastic to have something hot with just enough zest to please the adults but not so much spice as to discourage the children.

this is really good. I used a 28oz can of baked beans, and skipped the bacon. I didn't have molases so I used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I was looking for a kid friendly chili and this seemed to do the trick as my 2 year old enjoyed it.

This recipe served as a good base.  It is very easy to tweak to your own tastes.  I eliminated the bacon because I didn't have any and instead used 1/2 of 16 oz pkg of beef cocktail smokies halved. Also, instead 1 1/2 ground beef, I used 1lb of ground beef and 1/2 pound of pork breakfast sausage.  I added 1 tsp of prepared mustard in addition to the dry mustard, 1 tbs of Worcestershire, 1 tsp of onion powder and used 1 16oz can of Bush's baked beans and one can of black beans rinsed and drained.  I also added 1/2 can of water, as I found it to be a little thick. Instead of using the crock-pot, I just cooked it on the stove in a dutch oven.  Very tasty recipe, as mentioned before can be easily changed to suit your own taste.

Good, but too sweet and lacking too many other ingredients to be called chili. More of a side dish.

This is similar to a recipe my mom used to make.  She used a variety of beans in addition to baked beans (black, pinto, garbonzo, etc.).  My changes are to use pre-cooked bacon and crumbled raw burger.  I like to skip the stove-top step in crockpost recipes to save time and clean-up.

Yum! I make this all the time for two reasons...1) Its delicious! and 2) Its requested for every cookout. My mom has made it forever and now I do. Instead of Molasses however, I use brown sugar.  I also use 160z each of Kidney beans as well as the Brown beans. Also, I add about a cup of chopped onion. I used 1 lb of hamburg and a 1/2 lb of bacon. Oh & Ive never tried Ketchup! So easy to double for larger parties! I happen to be making it for a Labor Day party this weekend :)

This is very good.  I have made it many times now and have decided to skip the slow cooker and just cook on the stove.  Tastes just as good and don't have to plan ahead as much.

This recipe came out DELICIOUS!  We added some chopped onion and garlic, but other than that we stuck to the recipe.  It was awesome.

Great recipe, even the 18 month old loves it.  Tweek it a little to suit your tastes though.  I add 2 cups of corn, 2 cups of peas and a cup of shredded carrots to add some nice nutrition!

This was great!  I was tempted to mess with it a little by adding additional beans and tomato sauce but, it sounded so different, I thought I'd try it for the first time just as written.  I'm glad I did!  It was extremely easy to make and it was delicious!  I served it over rice and with a green vegetable on the side.  Terrific!  I'll make it again!

My family did not care for this recipe.   I will not try it again - after an hour of cooking in the slow cooker, grease was floating on top.

This is a really great recipe! I add brown sugar to mine and it makes it even sweeter! I do omit the green pepper though! Even my three-year-old cleaned his plate!

Let me just say, this recipe is great! Very versatile. My husband is not a fan of chili so I tried this and it was well liked! I did add chili beans as well as the baked beans and I don't know why but I added some turkey ham because it just sounded good! Traded out green peppers for onions and topped it off with a little cheddar when serving-yummy! Thanks for a little something different!

I made this recipe yesterday and it was delicious!!!  I put it in the slow cooker by 9 am and left it on low until 4 pm and the whole house smelled so delicious it drove my family crazy!  It was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and even then there was just enough for a good sized serving for six of us.  Great recipe!!!

My mother made this when I was growing up and it was always one of my favorites, although we never called it chili....it was just "beans and meat"!  I make it on the stove top browning hamburger and onion together then add ketchup prepared mustard and pork and beans then let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  Serve with a vegtable and bread and butter.  Simple food but so delicious!

I thought this recipes was very good. At first I did not like the way it looked. A caterer attempted to make this same recipe at a wedding I attended and it was not good. I added an onion and a additional 1/4 cup of ketchup. I will be making this again. Thank you

ok...let me preface this by saying that I don't usually like sweet chili.  I loved this recipe. It was tasty and easy.  I made these changes. corn syrup instead of molasses(personal preference)1 pound ground beef, 1 chopped onion, 1 can drained kidney beans, 1 8oz. can tomato sauce, 1 tsp. chili powder, and 1 Tbsp brown sugar. I browned the beef, cooked the onions and peppers and cooked the whole thing on low for 6-8 hours.  oh yeah, I used porkless baked beans. :)

Great! It's not a true "chili" by any means so if you are looking for a traditional chili recipe, don't make this.  I was looking for a dish that I could make for a friend's family (she is having a baby) that even her 4 year old would eat and so I tried this.  I had a hard time getting it to them as my husband wanted to eat it.  I made the bacon in the oven (on a cookie sheet covered with foil at 425 degrees until crisp) to cut down on splattering on the stove top and added it as per the recipe.  I left it in whole strips as I was unsure if people would want bacon in it and it would make it easier to remove, like a bayleaf.  I have used green, yellow, and red peppers (whatever was in the garden) and even pepper haters ate it.  Great dish that will please everyone!

I thought this recipe was delicious.  Definitely not for those who are looking for a spicy chili...it's very sweet.  Doesn't make a lot so if you are feeding more than 4 or so I might double.  We added some shredded cheddar on top of ours after we dished it out...Thanks for this great recipe.

My mom made this for years, still does, we have always called it Rancho Beans, we use pork and beans drained, baked beans and kidney beans. This is so great to take to potluck dinners or parties.  Everyone loves it.

I think you have to expect that this is really more of a sweet baked bean dish with ground beef.  I use one pound of ground beef(my pref.), double the beans, always add onions and brown sugar (instead of molasses, which are fine)less pepper, cayenne pepper to taste, 1/2 of a green pepper and get great results.  Adults and children generally like it very much.  Just don't expect it to taste like typical chili-- it isn't supposed too :)  Great leftovers if there are any!

This was very good.  I wouldnt say that I would make it as a chili all the time but it is a great and easy side dish.  I put some brown sugar in with it and onions.  It basically tastes just like baked beans with hamburger added and is very meaty.  I love slow cooker recipes because I can just throw it all together and leave.  This was good and I will make it again.

A very easy chili. It had an ok flavor, but was way too sweet for my family. I think I'll just stick with my own chili recipe.

I made this when I had a bunch of leftover beans from a barbeque that I didn't know what to do with.  The only changes I made was that instead of molasses, which I didn't have on hand, I used some brown sugar and half a can of cola. My husband loved it and actually just asked me what he should buy at the store so I will make it for him again.

This recipe was very good and easy to make. The only thing I would recommend is cutting the bacon up after cooking it. The bacon gives the chili great flavor but is hard to eat in the chili in whole slices.

I loved this meal! I cooked it while we were moving into our new house, and it was simple and delicious. I doubled the amount of baked beans, and used vegetarian. Also, we didn't have any ketchup on hand (due to the move), so I used BBQ sauce instead, and it was awesome! It added a little spice to the dish. Also, I didn't put any bacon in, and it still turned out very well. Serve with some cornbread, and you've got a great meal! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was pretty good but you can't expect it to be "Chili" more like baked beans. However, my family ate it up and we'll make it again.

This makes great baked beans but not very good chili, it was too sweet, I probably won't make it again.

Used turkey bacon and vegetarian beans since my family does not eat pork or pork bacon. This was very good. Wonderful flavors. Everyone loved it!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  So easy to cook and a wonderful flavor.  I used sliced Zucchini in place of the green peppers.  I will definetely make again and again.  Thank you for this recipe.

This is not a Chili, this is a variation on a baked beans recipe that has been around for years.  I have been cooking these beans for my family for 37 plus years. I got the recipe from my mother who got it from hers.  I use brown sugar not molasses, regular mustard not dry mustard, onion and garlic, along with ground beef and bacon (and some butter).  We bake not slow cook. I tried this variation, didnt care as much for it as my own recipe, but they were ok.

Made this for supper tonight. Even with the addition of chopped onion, and a few spices, this was way too sweet for our liking. Not what I would call chili..won't be making this again.

This was really, really good.  It took almost no time to prepare, and didn't require a long cooking time, either.  I did add half of a large chopped onion when I sauteed the bacon and green peppers, then chopped up half a large jalapeno when I had everything combined, just because we like a little kick.  The flavor was incredible. My husband just kept eating and eating, then finally said "what's IN this??"  

I've been trying to cut back on our grocery bill (who isn't), and this is a very tasty way to do that.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

My family was split on this one, hubby and youngest daughter (12yrs.) did not care for this,  myself and my oldest daughter(17 yrs.) liked it.
It is a bit too sweet for our tastes as a main dish, as a side dish I think this would be great.

I made this and Swope Bread (also on this website) for my friends' children when our friends came for a casual chili supper.  (The adults were served a spicier firehouse-style chili.)  Sweet Chili was a bona fide hit!  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a church lunch and it went down a storm. I've never liked spicy chili so this was great for me. I'm in England, so the baked beans I used had a tomato base, I doubled the recipe, and used 2 tins pork and beans, one tin plain and threw in a tin of butter beans but only used 2 lbs ground beef. I substituted onions for peppers as a personal preference. Thanks for a great base recipe!

I made this recipe as written except that I substituted leftover roast (a combination of Charley's slow cooker mexican meat and simply the best beef briscuit, both from this site).  I also added some onion.  It was delicious and filling and DH ate it like it was going out of style.  Thanks for an easy and filling idea!

Way too sweet to be a main dish.  Also, the sweetness overpowers the bacon.  If I make this again, I'll cut back on the molasses and use this as a side dish.

Like others, I used maple syrup and onion instead of sugar & bell pepper. A little sweet for me but nice all the same.  Sure to be a hit with kids.

This was a big hit. I had doubts about the molasses taste, and used a bit less, but it was quite tasty. I only had pre-cooked bacon on hand, so I chopped it and only cooked it a little to bring out the flavor, but it worked well. Also added chopped onion.

Very simple but quite tasty. Can be modified easily (for example,we omitted the green peppers, added some chopped onions). Kids loved the slightly sweet taste.

I have to say I'm surprised at how much I liked this!  I made it because it seemed easy and kid friendly, which it is, but it's also good!  I only made minor changes - I left out the salt and used a 28oz can of beans.  I also cooked this on the stovetop, simmering for about 25 minutes, and it worked fine.  Needs more bacon, but otherwise it's just perfect!

Loved it! I added about 2 teaspoons of Splenda Brown Sugar to sweeten it.  Be careful NOT to overcook.  Beans need to be ones with a lot of juice.  Even my husband was impressed.

I modified this recipe by adding a can of drained kidney beans, 8 oz tomato sauce, and a handful of dried onion.  I definitely plan on making this recipe again.  It's different than any chili I've ever tasted, but it's good.

Yum! This was really tasty and easy, which is a must for week night meals.  We ate this spooned over corn bread, and was even better the next day warmed up.  I think next time I will try to reduce the pepper, as even a 1/2 tsp was too spicy for my toddler, but the hubby raved over this recipe and I really enjoyed the little "kick" the pepper added.  My only complaint was that I thought it had too much "pork and beans" flavor for my taste and will consider adding just chili beans or kidney beans next time.  Oh and I chopped the bacon up before adding it after reading the other reviews.

I make this quite a lot and spice it up with jalaps sauteed with the green pep or in a cornbread side.  Dont skimp on ingredients and you may win a blue ribbon in the fam.

I was pretty happy with the turn-out on this one. Definitely sweet, which is what I wanted. Like others, I used maple syrup and prepared mustard. Itll be good to bring for lunch with some crusty bread.

I add corn to mine and 2 cans of beans, as well as, petite diced tomatoes, they make it more tomatoe pasty.

Love it, made it many times, serve with cheddar and sour crean

Made a few slight changes to suit our family. Used two cans of Bush's Original Beans, 1/2 brown sugar, 3/4 c ketchup, 1 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1lb cooked hamburger, 1onion and 1green pepper chopped and sautéed until caramelized. For us it was perfect.

I also added onion to this recipe.  That was the only change I made and I thought it turned out pretty good.  Good cool evening meal!  I served it with corn bread.

My husband and I really liked this one. You can easily adapt to your own taste or what you have on hand. I omitted ketchup, molasses, dry mustard and bell pepper and put in brown sugar, prepared mustard and onion instead. I cooked the meat and onion together in a pan, drained it well and then dumped everything into the dutch oven. I also added 2 28oz cans of baked beans and simmered in for an hour. Thanks for provided this recipe =)

Great recipe.  Back when I camped out at the lake we called them "Cowboy beans" and cooked them over the campfire.  Funny how our friends flocked around when they were done....
