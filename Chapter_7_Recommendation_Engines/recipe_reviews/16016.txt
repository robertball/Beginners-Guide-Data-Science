I have made this recipe at least ten times and am finally making a review. I have settled on those small black lentils. You can also use WAY MORE lentils than what is mentioned here. I let them soak for about 4 hours, or overnight, it does not matter. If you do not have crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce works fine.  I save money by using dried parsley because it is so expensive to buy it fresh where I live. They make you buy a huge bundle of it. Thanks for the recipe!    Also, this is HUGE:  It tastes WAY WAY WAY better the 2nd day. If you eat it fresh out of the pan, it is so-so, but if you put it in a big jar and eat it the next day, Mmmmmm.......

This is very yummy. Here's my take on it: I left out the onions (DH is allergic) and substituted red wine for the white. I used a cheap Shiraz wine but as long as you would drink it, it's all good. Just don't use cooking wine...blech. I chose red because white wine is for the lighter "meats" and lentils are the vegeterian equivalent of beef! Now, wine has a tendency to make things seem more salty (chemistry smarties will probably know the reason for this), so for stock, I used  Glace de Poulet Gold, which is low-sodium, restaurant-quality, and absolutely ROCKS. (NOTE: I am not in any way affiliated with the brand, nor do I own company stock -- a little pun for you clever types).  I kept the spices the same, except at the end I added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick, as we're a wild and crazy bunch around here.

My tips:  - Lentils aren't usually soaked. You don't need to soak them if you wait to add the tomatoes and wine until after the lentils are cooked soft. (The acid prevents the lentils from softening.) This makes the recipe much easier with no sacrifice in taste. - I used smoked paprika, which gave the taste usually achieved by adding a smoked ham hock but keeps the recipe vegetarian and easy. (Veg broth or water can easily substitute for the chicken broth. I used beef broth myself.) - I used three kinds of lentils, and I don't think it mattered. Use whatever you like or have available. - If you're dieting you could add more carrots and celery. - I agree with the next day comment. Now is day 3 and I think I'll eat some more right now.

Yummy!  I didn't pre-soak the lentils 1st (although I rinsed & drained them).  Maybe because of this, the soup required about 2 hours of cooking time.  The carrots though weren't soft enough after only one hour.  You may need more broth or water depending on how thick you like the soup.  I may try it with a small can of crushed tomatoes next time.

I am Hungarian American and this was the best lentil soup I've made.  I added chopped ham and that just made the soup even heartier.

Made this a few nights ago & it was FANTASTIC!!  Followed the recipe in all aspects except I used probably double the amount of lentils.  But this is just because I like a really thick lentil soup (just the way our German neighbor used to make it).  I also added some turkey keilbasa sausage cut up real small wihich I cooked with the vegetables.  This is a wonderful soup.

This soup was absolutely wonderful!  I added some cooked wild rice to the soup to make it a soup with complete protein, and it turned out great.  It was absolutely delicious and completely nutritious.

This soup was SOO GOOD!  I shared it with my neighbors, and we all agreed that we will be eating this stuff all winter.  Very economical, too.  Lentils are cheap, and if you can get a good deal on the chicken broth, then the whole thing costs very little to make.

This was a really, really delicious soup! I made a couple of changes to the recipe...1 1/2 cups of lentils seemed like a lot, and I only had about 3/4 cup to 1 cup, so I just used all that I had. It probably could have used more, so next time I make this, I'm going to try about 1 1/4 cups of lentils. I also skipped the soaking part, but cooked the lentils in the broth and vegetable mixture for about 10 minutes before adding the tomatoes, because the acid in the tomatoes slows the cooking of the lentils, and I don't care for hard lentils in my soup. I also skipped the wine in the recipe, and used another 3/4 cup of chicken broth instead. Other than that, I made the soup exactly as written, and was very pleased with the results. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's delicious!

This was my first time making a lentil soup, so I was unsure how my family would like it.  It was great!  SO thick and savory.  I added a cup of cooked cubed ham, and I think that it added alot of flavor to the soup.  I will make again!

Awesome recipe.  Made a few changes:

-smoked paprika (instead of regular)

-a few sprigs of fresh thyme added the last ten   minutes of cooking along with about 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley for aromatics

- triple the garlic

- double the salt and pepper (I used 50/50 fresh groud white and black pepper)

- add about three tbsp butter to the pot to enhance  flavor

- after cooking the soup for one hour, turn stove to lowest simmer and let cook another 30 minutes so all the flavors can merge and settle

- 1 heaping tbsp tomato paste really bolsters the tomato element and provides a little thickness to the soup

- Finally, I took the finished product and blended it on medium for about 45 seconds.  I like the soup both ways, but to make a more Middle-Eastern version go blended. It makes a creamy and very, very tasty soup.  Top with shaved parmesean, a small sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley, and a pinch of the smoke paprika.  Delicious!

I've made this several times and I could eat it every day!  Instead of chopping all the veggies, I use a mixed bag or two of frozen diced carrots, onion, and celery to save time. I've never used the wine because I never have any, so I just increase the broth (and omit the extra salt, which isn't necessary if you're using broth).  About 10 minutes before it's done, I add 1/2 - 1 cup of quick cook barley to make it thicker and healthier.  Also, I've added some diced hot peppers from our garden and it gives it a nice kick if you like spicy food.  This is my forever recipe for lentil soup!

I have made this recipe several times and love it. It is easy to make a double batch and keep half in the freezer. Definitely freezes well. I have also discovered that if you are using store bought chicken stock (who has time to make their own??), it tastes better to use the unsalted kind. Otherwise, the soup tastes way to acidic. If you are using a higher sodium stock you would be safe to eliminate the salt called for in the recipe.

OMG!  Just made this for dinner with a few modifications based on what I had in the pantry. this soup is DELICIOUS!!  I had 2 leeks left from Christmas dinner, so I subbed them for regular onions. I didn;t have celery - just omitted it. My husband isn't happy with meatless dishes so i added some diced smoked ham left from New Years! Did a full teaspoon of smoked paprika and 2 cans of brown lentils, drained and rinsed. It was AWESOME! this recipe is a keeper - thanks Gabriella!

This was phenomenal!  Only change I made was that I didn't add the tomatoes or the wine until I was sure that the lentils were tender.  I wasn't sure if lentils do what beans do and not become tender if exposed to the acids in tomatoes or wine so I wasn't taking any chances with crunchy lentils!  This freezes really well too!

Delicious! Used veggie broth instead of chicken, but otherwise follwed the recipe. The cooking time was a bit off, and it could have used another 15 minutes or so of simmering. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch. Thanks!

This was very good. I omitted the wine since I didn't have any open. I used homemade chicken broth and added some carrots from the broth which I had mashed, in addition to the carrots in the recipe. We did add additional salt at the table. Like some other reviewers, I didn't soak the lentils ahead of time and it came out fine. Just allow extra time for cooking since the carrots take so long to cook anyway. This is extremely low calorie. You can fill up easily without adding to your waistline with this soup.

Thank you, Gabriella, for this wonderful soup recipe! I left out the wine and replaced the 7 cups of chicken broth with 2 cups of organic "no-chicken" chicken broth and 5 cups of veggie broth to make this a vegetarian dish. No reason for the broth proportions-that's what I had on hand.

I wanted to use up a few things sitting around so I added a chopped red pepper, 3/4 C. UNCOOKED brown basmati rice, washed and soaked, a bit of crushed dried rosemary, and about a tablespoon or two of chopped fresh mint leaves.

The rice gave it thickness, which I like. For an extra bit-serve spooned over a buttery toasted piece of garlic bread, or two.

Hearty and healthy. A keeper!

Delicious!! Based off reviews, I added 2 cups lentils, 1 tsp. Cumin, 2 tsp. Paprika, 1 1/2 tsp. Coriander and extra garlic (4 cloves minced). I also used a can of diced tomatoes to make up the 3 1/2 cups crushed tomatoes. This soup is SAVORY! It tastes just as good as the lentil soup I buy freshly made at Whole Foods. Thank you, Gabriella!

Was yummy on a cold night.  Made the following modification due to taste and what I had available: doubled the garlic, added 2tsp paprika, 1tsp coriander, 1/2tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayanne pepper, skipped the wine since I didn't have any, and added some kale and shrimp since I had some to use up.  Turned out very well.  Also blended some of the soup at the end to thicken the broth but wish I hadn't because the soup went from a rich dark red color from the paprika to a less exiting brown color from the pureed lentils.

Delicious, simple and did I say delicious!  Only changes I made was add about one tsp of paprika instead of half and I chopped a bunch of cilantro and stirred that in once it was done cooking.  Thank YOu!

I've been trying to make Lentil Soup like my aunt's for years and this recipe finally helped me do it! The soup was sooo flavorful! I just made a few adjustments by shredding the carrots and celery, and added cummin, cayanne pepper, and seasonall. I also left out the wine and cheese.   Highly recommend this recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I used cooking white wine instead of regular white wine, and I added about a 1/2 tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I agree with the other reviews that it tastes much better on the 2nd day. The fresh parsley and parmesan (I used plain grated Kraft kind) topped it off perfectly. Great taste and healthy too! Next time I might try it with real wine.

Deelish. I used red instead of white wine because I didn't have any white.  I didn't soak the beans because my bag said I didn't have to, but it took forever to cook (at least 2 hours.)
WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!!!

This was my first attempt at making Lentil soup and it was a hit, even my fussy teenaged son enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used the entire bag of lentils which after soaking was about 4 -5 cups. I also added a couple of diced chicken sausages after the onions and eliminated the paprika because the sausages are loaded with spicy peppers. Added no extra salt as I thought there was plenty in the chicken stock & crushed tomatoes. I've added a picture and agree with the other reviews that stated this was even better the next day. I will be making this again!

Our favorite lentil soup recipe. I add extra carrots, celery, garlic, and paprika. I also use red lentils and they are softer so no need to soak.

This soup is fantastic! The only alterations I made was to double the carrots and celery (I like a thick lentil soup) and up the garlic to two tablespoons. Perfect for a windy winter afternoon.

This was a really good recipe. I've never made lentil soup - usually just eat the canned kind - and this was so much better. I changed a few things: added 2 tbsp lemon juice, 3 tbsp cilantro, and 2 tbsp tomato paste. I also used more garlic for my taste and added chili powder and cumin. I will definitely be making this again.

Delish!  I added a half and potato and then blended the potato and about a cup of the lentil soup before adding it back to the pot to make it a little thicker.

This soup turned out great -  very tasty.  I wasn't sure whether the recipe meant red or green lentils, so I just used green. Would it have made much of a difference? I'm not sure as I have not cooked with lentils before. I only added half of the tomatoes as the 3 1/2 cups seemed too much for our taste.  Thank you.

I seasoned this just as instructed. I love having lots of lentil beans in my soup so I doubled the amount of beans. I also did as someone else suggested and after it was done simmering for the hour and the beans were soft..I removed some beans and but them in the blender to puree. Then dumped back in the pot. ...made a nice and thick soup. This was a good receipe.

Both my husband and daughter (age 10) really liked this dish.  The flavors blended so well that my  daughter even ate the onion and tomatoes (which she usually picks out).  And it is very filling.  My husband was full off of one bowl. We added a dash of cajun seasoning and it tasted great!  Such a nutritious and satisfying meal!

My husband was born in Italy and we have been making Lentil soup for years.  We loved this version better then what we have been making.  It had so much flavor.  And I used fennel instead of the celery.  Delicious!

Very good! This was my last attempt to make something delicious with lentils and this is by far the best lentil soup I've ever had. I love the crunchy parts of celery and carrots. I cut it in half for dinner for two and still had leftovers. I loved the flavor the white wine gave--I used Riesling. And I didn't use parsley because I had none, and the soup was still delicious! I will definitely be making this again. So easy!

Definitely let this sit a day or two before eating and just plan it for a day other than the day it is cooked. The flavors blended and developed much better. Delicious.

I think really much better the 2nd day as someone else stated.  This time I used the immersion blender to roughtly puree and it was much better. It could use more cooking time, my lentils were still a little crunchy (also the celery) despite following instructions.  Next time will cook longer.  Otherwise good hearty winter night soup!!

I really liked this lentil soup.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I didn't have any wine and I used water and chicken base instead of broth. Lentils don't really need to soak so this recipe was pretty quick for me.  I think I added more liquid than called for since it seemed thick at the end. I froze it in individual portions for quick and healthy lunches.  Very good!

This soup is fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely pleased with the results. It goes very well with warm crusty bread and soft butter. The wine and paprika turn an otherwise humdrum (if hearty) soup into something amazing. Definitely a new family favorite--thank you so much!

GREAT Lentil soup recipe!  We had a bag of lentils in the cupboard, so I went looking for a good Lentil Soup recipe, and this was it!  My husband, who I recently converted to going vegetarian, LOVED this hearty soup.  He said it had a great "meaty" flavor.  The flavor really is very full - great seasoning!  My only changes were to add more garlic, and, since I didn't have quite enough crushed tomatoes on hand, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used tomato sauce instead.  Worked great!  Lots of leftovers, so we'll be having this for lunch for a couple of days!

What a great lunchtime food. It fills me up without making me so full I'm ready to sleep and is perfect for winter.

Absolutely delicious. Such a GREAT comfort food. So much flavor with such simple ingredients. It probably depends on the type of lentils you use, but I didn't soak mine and they cooked up tender at exactly one hour. This recipe is also quite flexible. I'm not a wine drinker, so I used all chicken stock, added extra garlic, and threw in some chopped chicken breast. I bet vegetable stock or beef stock would be delicious as well.

Great recipe...especially if you use lamb shanks for more of a "Greek" flavor.  Brown them in a little olive oil and then add the onions and all the other ingredients as instructed.  Don't forget to add a little rosemary or Greek seasoning to the pot as well.  Tastes just like a restaurants.

This was a good start for a lentil soup recipe, but it needed some doctoring to make it really good. However, when I was done with it my husband, who generally requires meat in every dish, was asking for seconds and raving about how good it was. 
Here's what I did: chopped up one onion and sautéed it. Substituted red wine for white, added chili powder, cumin, more paprika and salt. I also added sour cream. I would use less chicken stock next time so that it's less soupy and thicker. I also left out the parsley but put in about 5 bay leaves.
It turned out really well and I'll make it again.

We enjoyed this soup. I cooked it in the crock pot, and added 2 ham hocks for some extra depth of flavor, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. It needed a little more spice, but my family really liked it. It made enough to freeze as well.

This was very good.  I threw in an extra 1/2 cup of lentils so I could use up the bag.  This made it super thick so I added in some extra wine (so I could finish the bottle)and water so it was a better consistancy.

This is an amazing soup! I added more lentils and chicken stock, as well. I also used ground white pepper instead of the black, adding a dash of cayenne and rosemary for the aroma and a little more kick. Delicious!

I just made this soup yesterday.  The entire kitchen smelled wonderful although I changed it a bit.  Instead of parsely, I used 1/2 bag fresh spinach chopped.  Then instead of chicken stock, I used about 5 cups water and 2 packets of low sodium chicken boulion (add water while cooking if needed).  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I only used 1 large can of tomatoes in juice and pureed in blender.  Then added 2 pinches of diced, dried rosemary.  Finally, pureed 1/2 the soup and combined.  Today I served with homemade bread and it was wonderful!!  The wine absolutely made the soup!  Will make again!

This is a delicious Lentil soup! My husband commented several times about how good it tasted. I would recommend to others. We did make a few changes however to the recipe because of personal preference.  Because we don't cook with alcohol, I substituted the white wine for 3/4 cup more chicken stock.  I also grated the onion instead of chopping because our toddlers won't eat chunky veggies in their soup, and I added about two extra cups more lentils then the recipe called for. I think the soup turned out perfectly with out alterations. Thank you Gabriella for sharing!

I added ham, and held the salt .  I served this with rice.  Either my family was very hungry, or this was a really good soup, because they had seconds!  I gave it 4 stars because I didn't like it!

This soup is a great base.  I used 1/2 can of tomatoes sauce and 1 diced tomato.  The soup is very fresh but I like earthier soups so I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of cumin and 1 1/2 teaspoons of coriander to balance.  I also added about 1/2/ cup more lentils.

This was delicious.  I ran out of tomatoes, so I didn't have the full 3 1/2 cups needed.  I also added a LOT more Hungarian Paprika than 1/2 a teaspoon.  I ended up freezing it in individual servings, which has worked great for me.

This was ok... it was my first time making any kin of Lentil Soup. I did like it, but I wished it would have had more flavor. I didn't add the wine and just added more chicken broth.. I think the recipe just needed a little more seasoning and flavor, even if you are including the wine.

WOW! This was amazing. I did have to modify due to not having some ingredients on hand. This was my first lentil soup and it is DEFINITELY a keeper. Modifications:1 bag frozen onion sauté in 2 tbsp olive oil. Add 1 1/2 - 2 bags of frozen veggie soup mix, sauté 10 min. Add 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can regular rotel drained, 2 tsp garlic power, 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp dry bay leaves, 7-8 Cups chicken broth and 1½cups of lentils. Cooked 30 in and lentils were already tender. Added to cooked brown rice when done!! Has a nice spicy kick!

Very good. You can use any combo of veggies you want, and once I was low on lentils so I added a can of black beans. Also have sauteed sliced turkey sausage in with the onions before adding veggies & deglazing with broth, and it added a delicious flavor. Have used both red & white wine, both good.

We enjoyed this soup very much, and it is indeed much better on the 2nd day.  I added much more garlic, twice the paprika, and also used some cumin and hot chile sauce.  We skipped the parmesan cheese, and served it instead with a curried fried egg on top.

This soup was so tasty! I used 3 (14-oz) cans chicken broth and 1 can of beef broth, and used a dry red wine instead of white. That added a wonderful richness to the soup. Like others, I didn't presoak the lentils. They weren't as soft as I might have expected, so perhaps a little longer cooking time would have done the trick. Still, it was hearty and flavorful--even better the next day!

This was good - definitely fills the tummy. I used a little curry since I didn't have bay leaf. I also added leftover meatloaf that had ham and cheese (from That's A Meatloaf on this site) in it because I didn't have parmesan. I found that 1 hour of cook time was just fine for the lentils even though I hadn't soaked them - just washed. Good soup if you like lentils.

This recipe was extremely easy to make and quite delicious!  I substituted sherry for the white wine and it worked fine.

Easy and very tasty.  I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes and they worked fine.

VERY GOOD.  Used 8 cups of broth.  More carrots and celery.
Did not have white wine.   Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and
about 75% bag of lentil from a 16 oz bag (Did not soak lentils). Did not use any cheese.  Used bottle parsley.

Just tried this one and took it to my weekly card game.  Didn't have any to bring home!  This is a winner all around.  I used mixed lentils:  regular, french black, and another black lentil. (also used more than recipe called for) Added a little sausage, but it would have been fine without.  My husband loved this too, and I need make another batch right away.  This recipe is perfect as is, but can be added to depending on what you have on hand.  Potato would be good, for example.  At the card game, another of the women had made some pot roast, and we put in some pieces of the meat as we ate my soup.  That was quite scrumptious too!

I definitely will make this again. My family and I love soups and I am always looking to add new soup recipes to my favorites. It was very hearty and satisfying. Perfect with biscuits or cornbread! Chopping the vegetables was a bit of work but definitely worth it. Got fab compliments from my family!

Love it. I was put off lentils for several years after having been given 15lbs of dry lentils. As a single person, that meant I ate too many lentils for too long. But this recipe has been a great reintroduction. If you like tomato-based and vegetable-heavy soups, this one's for you! It's about 4.5 stars in my mind, but I didn't add the optional Parmesan and parsley, which I'm convinced would bring it to 5. Pretty simple to make, too, which is always a big bonus for me! (Oh - and the only real changes I made were using additional stock instead of wine and doubling the garlic - something I routinely do!)

Changes made: cooked in a crock pot for 12 hours. Added diced chunks of double smoked ham. And when serving add vinegar to your bowl to taste.

great recipe. Duplicates  what my grandmother  used to make.

I improvised a little with this recipe and it still turned out great. Grocery store was out of celery so I put a little celery seed in it. To be efficient and use all of what I opened, I used a full bag (2 cups) of lentils, a little extra chicken stock (1 box and 1 can), and a little less tomatoes (2 cans; also used diced instead of crushed). I also added smoked roast that we had in the freezer from when our freezer quit and we were trying to preserve the meat. It was a great addition. I just happened to serve this to my husband and some of his fellow farmers on a day the local cafe was closed due to the snow, and they approved. For those of you who know farmers, they tend to enjoy hearty meals. My version turned out heartier than the picture implied, with the chunks of tomatoes and meat.

Hearty, Yummy.  The wine and paprika really gives the flavor extra depth.  Served it with crusty bread and a side salad.  I served it when I had my Mom and Brother over for dinner one night.  Everyone, even the kids loved it.  Sent my Mom and Bro home with leftovers.  Kids have already requested it again.

An amazing soup just the way it is!  I have made this soup at least 10 times and have never soaked the lentils first - you're cooking it for an hour so they get plenty cooked in that time.  A definite go-to soup for me and my family now.  Plus it's even better the next day!

This is my husband's favorite recipe! The great thing is, you can customize it. We use low salt broth and tomatoes and you really don't have to measure everything exactly. He loves more veggies, so I put in extra. Like another reviewer said, it's even better the next day. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

This soup was absolutely delicious and very easy to make!
I did make some adjustments, as follows: Instead of 2 large onions cubed, I diced up 1/4 of an onion. I didn't have any white wine on hand so I diluted 1/4 white wine vinegar in 3/4 of water. As well I sliced up half of a zucchini! Let a poster has said in an earlier review this is MUCH better the second day!! PS My meat loving husband went crazy for it,  haha!

Even my picky husband liked it!!! It is so healthy too. I have to admit that I made a few alterations. I only added half of the chicken stock (3 1/2 cups) because that was all I had. I added 3 cups of water to make up the difference in volume. I didn't add any wine or bay leaves, again I didn't have any. To make up for the lack of salt from the chicken stock I didn't use, I added 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of garlic powder for an extra kick. Finally, I used two cans of Italian stewed tomatoes for the tomatoes. Despite my alterations, it turned out great. I will make this again!

Very good, I used the whole 16oz of lentils and only one large onion and only 4 cups of chicken broth because of the expense.  All I had on hand was a large can of whole stewed tomatoes which I used juice and all.  I used about a tsp of dried parsley instead of fresh.  This was very good, will definitely make again, maybe will try with veggie broth to try out a vegetarian version next time

Better the next day. It was bland the night I made it (a bit disappointing). But it was much better as leftovers for lunch. I think the flavors needed to marinate together for a while.

My family and I enjoyed this soup. It is especially great for breaking a cleansing fast with the veggies. I will make again and next time thicken by pureeing some of the lentils after they are cooked.

Very delicious! Instead of the crushed tomatoes, I used 1 (28oz) can of Hunts Diced tomatoes with Basil, Garlic & Oregano plus 1 (14.5 oz) can of DelMonte petite cut diced tomatoes with Garlic & Olive Oil.  Instead of 7 c chic broth, I used 6 c chic broth with about 1 c of College Inn Chicken Broth with Roasted Vegetables. I think these additions made a substantial difference in the taste of the soup due to the additional spices and flavors.

I had high expectations for this based on all the glowing reviews.  Wow-ee; was this STRONG on tomato flavor (not quite what I was looking for). It was also pretty acidic.  I tried to cut the acidity with some brown sugar, which helped only marginally. Adding parmesan & sour cream to individual servings also helped some.  I don't think I'll make this one again.  I have a recipe similar to this with all the vegetables etc, but without the tomatoes.  I like that one much better.

I'm a huge fan of lentil soup, but this was a so-so recipe... not much flavor... tastes like chicken stock, tomatoes, and lentils. I suggest adding some more spice for flavor. Might taste better with beef stock... I will look for another lentil soup recipe

My family loves this recipe. I usually make big batches w/out the wine and can it in quarts for quick dinners. I add a 1/4 cup of wine when I reheat it. For some reason, the flavor is just better when the wine is added later.

This made a big pot of thick, hearty soup.  I love lentils and thought it was very good, but a little bland.  I might try A LOT more garlic and paprika next time.  A fresh grate of Parmesan over the top right before serving helped a lot.  My vegetarian sister loved it.

This soup is delicious! It has quickly become a family favorite. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken, and, like many other reviewers, did not soak the lentils and it turned out great!

This recipe is so delicious.  It is very similar to my Mom and Dads, who are italian immigrants and the best cooks.  Their recipe calls for prociutto to be sauteed with the onions.  We also add rice or some type of small pasta to the soup.  Excellent!

Delicious and healthy and you can make it vegan if you use vegetarian stock. Lentils keep you full and they’re really good for you unless you have a restriction. I will definitely be making batches of this from now on.

Loves this dish! The lentils are a better texture than ham and beans and it’s full of flavor. I would add more liquid towards the end though to make it more soupy. I did use more vegetables and lentils than it called for

This is one of my favorite soups.  Cannot believe I haven't written a review yet!   Have made it many times. After making it as written the first time I have discovered that it is extremely versatile depending on what leftovers I may have in the freezer. Sometimes I add leftover beef stew or pot roast "things" and last night it was leftover ham.  Even without any meat it is delicious and nutritious!  Just love it!

I meant to follow the recipe, but ended up using part tomato sauce because I didn't have enough crushed tomatoes. I also used red lentils (very small) so I didn't bother to soak them. I simmered in just broth for at least 1/2 hr before adding tomatoes and wine.  I think I will skip the wine next time (I don't think it needs it: I don't drink or like wine).  Great soup! Thanks for sharing!
My only complaint is simply that the ingredients should be listed in the order used - it's a pain scanning the recipe

I made this and it was really good, it is so good to eat in cold weather. Although It was more like stew. As a soup I expected it to be a little more watery.

It actually came out like chili. It was very healthy and good, but I'm a guy that loves his junk food. But don't be fooled this is a good recipe it's just not my style. I'd get the lentils and boil it for 2 minutes then let it soak for 2 hrs. It goes great with bread. Good for a cold winter night!

Made the soup to freeze for my nine-year-old’s lunches. There are four or five other varieties in the freezer but I find myself making it again because she chooses it every time.

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I didn't pre-soak the lentils, and I also added an extra cup of them to produce a thicker soup. 

As far as preparation went, I needed to simmer for an extra hour to get the lentils soft enough.  Tomatoes will toughen beans and make them take longer to cook, so that is probably the reason that the recipe calls for pre-soaking.  With this recipe, just know that you can either soak in advance or just simmer longer.  Either way, you need to plan for more time.

Flavor-wise, this recipe was not my favorite.  It's like a veggie-tomato soup with lentils, and I prefer a different flavor profile for lentil soup.  However, that's just my personal taste preference.

Needed a hearty home cooked meal for my daughter, a vegetarian home for Thanksgiving Break. This is straight forward and good, but was bland in my opinion. Would increase the garlic, the salt, and maybe throw in in a dash of cayenne. That said, satisfying and filling, and healthy as well!

This is my go-to lentil soup recipe--I love this stuff! I usually add red wine instead of white, because that's what I have. I make 1-2 batches every winter and freeze it in individual servings for a quick and easy lunch or light dinner.

Delicious dish with a little doctoring for bolder and layered flavoring.   I added an additional 1/2 tsp salt along with 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Yum!
I also sautéed the vegetables and put it all in a crock pot on high for 5 hours. My house smelled delicious when I walked in.

We loved it. I used the paprika my Mom sent from Hungary, and it made it even more authentic. I did soak the lentil before cooking. Just for half an hour but it helped. It was ready in an hour. I added ham also. I feel that it should have been in the original recipe since this is a Hungarian lentil soup.

I used 2 containers of chicken brother instead of 7 cups because I knew I would be adding more to it. I added tomatoes 40 minutes into the lentils cooking so that the lentils would cook first. I also added peas, spinach, corn, mushrooms, sausage and Lawry's seasoned salt.  I then let everything simmer for about 10 minutes.  Served with parmesan.  So healthy and delicious!

I added beef chuck pieces. I browned them first and added it to the lentils and cooked 1 hr with the ingredients, instead of chicken broth I used 1 1/2 beef buillon cube, and water. It's delicious!

Very good.  I thought it would need more lentils, so I used a whole bag.  That made it a bit too thick, but was easy to thin out to right consistency by adding more low sodium chicken broth.  I also threw in a couple of ham hocks for flavor.  The next day, we had left over ham and I added that as well.  Last tip - a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes adds a nice bite, if you likes things a little more spicy.

I really loved this recipe.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used 8 oz. tomato sauce and it worked great.  The tomato flavor really adds a lot.  I also added 1/2 pound cubed boneless ham.  I put about 4 cups of the soup (before adding the ham) in my blender because I like the base to be creamy.  Very flavorful!  Gave the house a nice smell.

I had exactly 1 1/2 cups of green lentils left and decided to make this soup.  When it was ready, I tasted it....and felt something was missing.  I tried adding a bit more salt, pepper, a bit of cumin, and it began to taste better but something was STILL missing.  It suddenly came to me - I added a 5 1/2 oz tin of tomato paste and let it cook a bit more. Aha!  That was the flavor boost it needed!  Good soup now!!!

Loved this! I didn't bother with presoaking the lentils but simmered for about 2 hrs. I added extra chicken stock (& paprika) because I was sending it to my MIl who likes very brothy soups vs thick. Awesome!!

I increased the servings to 11 to use the whole pack of lentils (2cups).  Also doubled the tomatoes and omitted the wine.  Soup was delicious and a big hit with a group of teachers who had it for lunch.  Served with crusty bread, parm cheese and salad.

Absolutely delicious! I read through the reviews and took some of the advice. I added the crushed tomatoes and wine at the end so that the lentils would cook without soaking first. I also didn't measure my lentils and just used an entire bag. As other reviewers mentioned, it is MUCH better the next day. We liked it the first day but LOVED it the second and third day. This recipe made it into permanent rotation here.

Lentil soup is a hearty cold weather soup. I modified this simple recipe by adding 1/4 cup uncooked quinoa (makes this a complete protein and does not affect the flavor), 16 ounces of Polish kielbasa sausage thinly sliced. A real time-saver is using classic mirepoix (aromatics like celery, carrots and onions) which some grocers carry already prepped in the frozen vegetables section. Lentils don't need to be pre-soaked, but a longer simmering at a low to medium heat will reduce the soup and caramelize the flavors. If you have access to fresh, local heirloom tomatoes utilize those instead of the canned type. I usually grow a few Black Krim tomatoes and freeze them for just this purpose. Also, adding a drop or two of liquid smoke will deepen the flavor of this soup if you wish to omit meat, and it will enhance the flavors of whatever you are using. Great recipe and easily modified!

I didn't love this soup. I felt the tomato taste was really dominant. When I make lentil soup, I like the lentils to be the dominate flavor or texture. Only change I made was making 1/2 recipe. I didn't have celery and thought the bay leaf would have been too strong. Either way, I had to add at least an additional 2 cups of water as it simmered off. I added a couple of other seasonings, but there was just a bit too much tomatoes giving it more of an Italian soup flavor.

I loved this recipe. I used some left over french onion soup and chicken broth and increased the garlic. I didn't pre-soak the lentils because they cook quickly and really don't need soaking (like split peas). This recipe will be a staple for me. Thanks!

Just made this and it was yummy! Did not add the Parmesan because I don't think it needed it.
I did what one reviewer did I added the crushed tomatoes after I cooked the soup for 1 hour. Plus I didn't 
Use chicken broth but added vegetable bouillon instead.

Right on recipe!  I used home made chicken stock (lower sodium) and then added some diced chicken.  An instant hit!  My wife said it was "lighter" than she expected and asked for some for her lunch tomorrow.

This is delicious! I added some potatoes, ham and quinoa which all tasted really good. I didn't soak the lentils and I didn't add parsley or Parmesan. It tastes delicious without them. This is so simple and healthy! All of my friends (guys and girls) who tried it loved it.

Excellent soup!  I used red wine instead of white. I used small green lentils and cooked in pressure cooker without tomatoes for 20 minutes. I cooled down the pressure cooker under cold running water then I added the crushed tomatoes and some red pepper. I let it simmer for about 15 minutes on medium low and it was perfect!  I have made this twice and I am sure I will make it often!!  Family loved it. Thank you Gabriella for sharing!

I must admit I didn't follow all the instructions. As we have a TONNE of yellow lentils to use up, I put in just over double the amount in. Also we had no celery so put in extra carrot. It turned out more mushy than soupy. I think lentil recipes can also vary depending on the type of lentils put in, and putting a mix of lentils may have improved things...

this recipe was so good I have returned to the recipe again and again.  I have made lentils in the past and I was suspicious of a recipe with tomatoes but it surprised me, delicious!  I added mushrooms this time just because I had some.

Used tomato sauce and organic orange lentils. DELISH, cheap, freezable! I doubled the amount of lentils and its nice and thick. Then I packed it up in single servings to freeze and take to work.

I made this and, basically doubled the recipe.  I also added some chicken sausage, frozen spinach and smoked paprika. Really great cold weather one pot dinner. You don't need anything else besides some good bread.  I am thawing the second half of it right now after we ate the first of it last week.  Excellent taste and very filling.

Would have given the recipe 5 stars but I did make changes.  Doubled the amount of lentil beans, garlic and paprika (used smoked paprika) and also added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  Since my husband is on a very low salt diet, I did not add any salt and used homemade chicken stock that I had made with no added salt.  To give the soup a less acidic taste and make it more flavorful,  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar.  I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the soup turned out, especially since it was basically salt-free.

I didn't use the wine or the bay leaves, and only used 1 cup of tomatoes. I also added a little cumin. This soup was really great! It was my first time cooking and eating lentils (i used small black ones), and I am so happy that I came across a really good recipe like this one! Thanks!

I was inspired by a lentil soup that I recently had at a local restaurant that had a bit of a "bite" to it.  I added one diced green bell pepper, 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper, 3/4 cup of barley and 3 cups of chicken stock (to account for the addition of barley).  I did not soak the lentils (just washed and drained) and needed to simmer for more than two hours for the lentils to become tender.  The end result was magnificent.  I dare say every bit as good as what I'd had in the restaurant.

This soup was great!! My husband was amazed at how great it turned out on my first try. My 4 year old even asked to take it to school for lunch the next day.because it was so good. In my book that's a winner.

Delicious lentil soup recipe that is super healthy! It is very flexible in terms of adjustments according to what you have (or don't have) in your kitchen pantry. This is my go-to lentil soup recipe that I can't survive without in winter!

Very good, although the tomatoes make it a bit acidic. Definitely do not use 3 1/2 cups of crushed tomatoes - it's way too much. I doubled the carrots and celery.

I thought this was easy to prepare, healthy and yummy! I was so proud of myself for using homemade chicken stock that I had in the freezer from preparing whole chickens for other recipes on this site. I think homemade stock tastes much better than the canned stuff! Plus I saved the cost of buying the canned stuff. Anyway, the soup was very good. You can spice it up if you need more flavor, too.

Simple and fabulous. I doubled, maybe tripled, the garlic, and it came out great. Oh and I didn't have wine so I combined some soy sauce and vinegar and it really mellowed out the tomato-y flavor, so that was good. I will definitely make this many more times.

A nice, filling lentil soup.  I forgot the Parmesan, but added a dollop of sour ceam before serving.  Tried the Parmesan with leftovers, and it definitely adds another dimension.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I didn't have any white wine and used sherry instead (don't know if that's okay or not), and the soup was good, but not as flavorful as I would have expected, until adding the parmesan.  Once I added nice portion of parmesan, it was pretty awesome.

This was a fun recipe to make.  It turned out rather well.  I used black-eyed peas instead of the lentils, but I think it would be better with lentils.  It could have used more liquid that it called for.  I upped the wine to one cup but it was still a very dry "soup".

Very Good Lentil Soup Recipe. Used puree instead of the crushed tomatoes and the soup came out fine and tasty.

Very good soup!  I used canned crushed tomatoes with basil and canned chicken broth and it turned out great.  It takes 3 1/2 cans of normal sized (14.5 oz) chicken broth, so make sure you have enough on hand.

This is a thick hearty soup.  I served a small bowl of it with chicken picatta, which made a nice meal.  Be generous with the romano cheese on top.  Freezes well.

Yummy, though I would recommend adding some crushed red pepper, or something to spice it up a little.

This was the first time I'd made lentil soup and this recipe was phenomonal.  I wouldn't change one thing.  The family loved it and definitely said this one's a keeper!!  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Came out with a good soup, lots of flavor. Made it vegetarian by using half vegetable broth and half water. I did have to use more liquid than was called for (maybe because of the ingredients I added), but it didn't cut down on the flavor. Threw in bell peppers and potatoes, and had to use a combination of vinegar and soy sauce because I was out of wine. Highly recommend topping with a good parmesan--it really "made" the soup.

This is the best lentil soup recipe I've ever eaten.  Everyone who tried it asked for the recipe.  I pureed half of the soup thinking my 2 and 4 year olds would like the looks of it better.  They didn't, but I liked the texture and it tasted great.

This was a different recipe from my moms, so I decided to give it a whirl. It was terrific. I also didn't find the need to soak my lentils and it came out just fine. Wonderful soup Gabriella and thanks!

Pretty good. I wouldn't use 7 cups of liquid though! I only used 6 and the soup was a little watery. Very good flavour and a wonderful lentil soup otherwise!

This was very good, but quite tomatoe-y (not a word, but descriptive nonetheless); it was a bit of a shock... in a good way, but still, not the comfort food I had expected.

Third attempt to enter review since I’m tech challenged.  WONDERFUL SOUP!  Made some changes:  Used about 10 cups stock and at least two of them were beef stock, all low salt. Increased amount of garlic, spices, and veggies by about 1/2 more. Used twice as many lentils.  Used the 13 lentil variety that has almost every lentil you can think of. Soaked them and that reduced cooking time, but I also cooked it a little longer anyway.  Each day this soup just got better and better!  This is one soup that is hard to mess up. I think I will add cabbage next time.  It freeze well also, especially with a Food Saver that will vaccum seal the air out.

This is the first time I’ve liked my own lentils! I didn’t have several Ingredients (broth, carrots, celery) and it was STILL good (though I’m sure chicken broth would’ve been better than plan old water). Even my four-year-old liked it. Thumbs up!

Great soup.  I cooked it in a pressure cooker.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, crushed fresh tomatoes and forgot the Parmesan cheese.  Loved the flavor.  I know I would have liked it with the cheese as well.  Good ratios of ingredients.  Thanks.

Pretty tasty and relatively easy to make although it takes some time to simmer.  I actually made it to reheat for dinners during the week, and it does well reheated. It is a little strong on the tomatoes so I might cut that in the future. I didn't have celery on hand so threw in some kale near the end instead, and used green lentils.

Very very good soup. My changes based mostly on what I had on hand: I only used one onion, but doubled the garlic, added an extra celery stalk for crunch, Replaced paprika and Bay leaf with old Bay seasoning, instead of crushed tomatoes I used half a small can of tomato paste. It came out very tasty especially when I added shredded manchego cheese instead of parmesan. Also,  I did not need to soak my small red lentils just rinsed and added.

I used more veggies than the recipe called for, including a bag of frozen green beans. I used cilantro instead of parsley and didn’t have any Parmesan cheese.

Definitely like this recipe, and was looking for more meatless options to help stretch the budget. This delivers, is tasty, and makes a ton. Will probably make again!

I had no white wine available, and simply left it out. Very good soup, even without the tanginess of wine. Served with a mixture of fresh cilantro and Yomogi (Japanese Mugwort).

I made this soup, it’s came out alright. I added mushrooms in the beginning. When it was done it tasted a little bland even after more salt and pepper. I added 3 sliced jalapeños and it made a huge difference in the flavor department.  If you’ve done this recipe and want to switch it up, throw some jalapeños in there. ????

Oh man is this good! It's become my favorite! I took the advice of another user and added a cup of wild rice (and one cup of lentils). I used a extra cup of broth or two boxes of broth (since each box has 4 cups each. I also tweaked the peprika  using a 1/2 tsp of reg paprika and 1/2 of smoked paprika and a little bit of crushed red pepper to give it a bit of heat---OMG perfect. 

Thank you for this recipe!

I thought this was great and it made a large amount so it was good to freeze some. Based on what I had....I used 8 cups of veggie broth and 2 cups of red lentils (rinsed but not presoaked), a large can of crushed tomatoes, probably doubled the garlic, extra carrots, about a cup of wine and no parsley. Yummy....will definitely make again!!

I thought this was very delicious and not as bland as traditional vegetable soups/lentil soups. The wine adds great flavor! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Only minor tweaking. Lentils came in a one pound bag which measured a bit over two cups. I used the whole thing. I also used vegetable broth because we were dining with my vegetarian daughter. Wasn’t sure how long to soak the beans but an hour seemed about right.

Great recipe! I followed a similar one from the Internet with essentially all of the same ingredients.  I followed the recipe as mentioned and added collard greens instead of the spinach, as well as almond milk, a tablespoon of crème fraîche, and parmesan cheese to make it a little more creamier.

Enjoyed it!  Used 1/2 tsp smoked paprika.....could use 1 tsp.  Didn't add spinach, but would be good.  No wine, but  veg broth instead.  Used veg broth, instead of chicken broth.

This was AMAZING!  Especially with the Parmesan cheese. I added a tiny bit of ground red pepper and a tad more paprika for a little pizzaz. Excellent!! Also tried with a garnish of sour cream stirred in - to die for!! Thanks for great recipe!

This is a truly tasty bowl of soup! I did not have bay leaves, so made it without. I also prefer my lentil soup to be puréed, so once cooking was complete, used my immersion blender to blend smooth. The kiddo will eat it this way, too, so definite bonus! No loss of flavor and in fact, I think that without the competition of the textures of all the ingredients, the flavors come through better. A definite recipe to repeat! And pretty easy to make, too.

This soup is hearty and tasty, but  the lentils were quite hard, even after soaking them all night and simmering the soup for 2 1/2 hours.  I will try what other reviewers suggested and wait until the lentils are soft before adding the tomatoes and wine. Cubes of ham are a nice addition to the soup.

My husband and I enjoyed this soup very much.  Quite easy to make and with all the fresh veggies - very healthy! Only changes I made was added 1 tsp of paprika and cooked in coconut oil which I always use as a replacement for sautéing  with olive oil.

I used vegetable stock, added some fresh spinach, and used smoked paprika as suggested in another review. It was good. I will make it again. It makes a large pot of soup, so there are plenty of leftovers.

Will definitely make again!  I let the soup simmer for almost 2 hrs, and the veggies are still firmer than I'd like them to be -- will saute them longer next time.  I also used 2 cans of tomato puree instead of the called for amount of tomatoes (due to lack of attention).  The flavor was good, I would probably do the same next time.

We used red lentils, vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.  It tasted better after it was in the fridge a day or too. Added in more garlic, but I do that with most recipes.

The 3 stars is for this recipe as is. With so much acids from the tomatoes & wine, the lentils remain somewhat firm no matter how long you cook them. I fixed this by blending the soup up. Also that much acid requires some sweetness to offset (just like any other tomato based sauce.) I added a drip of honey to my bowl, because that's what was at the table. It was much better, so I went back to the pot and added a tsp of sugar. If I make it again, I would reduce the amount of wine & hold it back along with tomatoes untill the lentils are cooked, and add 1 tsp of sugar.

Best Lentil soup I've ever had, and I don't really like lentil soup!
I put everything in it except celery, tomatoes, wine, and salt (b/c I used chk boullion) . I just dumped it all in a pot and cooked it for about 35 minutes and it was done! So easy and yummy! Even my husband liked it and he doesn't usually like lentils!

I "veganized" this recipe by omitting the chicken broth and using vegetable broth. I sprinkled with  yeast flakes instead of the cheese before serving. My three kids all asked for seconds! Delish!!!

Just ok. This was about 9 full meal servings. The flavors were nothing special. Might try some dill or curry next time when I unthaw.

Delicious.  I never thought lentil soup could be this great.  Only change I made was to add about a pound of thick sliced ham steak and simmered for 2 hours.  Amazing flavor

I loved this soup.  It's a great dinner when you need a break from meat but still want something hearty.   M girls did not like this, maybe it was the texture.

This was delicious! I changed proportions depending on what I had (less broth, more wine, no celery, and Rotel tomatoes  with chili peppers.) very spicy but exceedingly yummy! It is a flexible recipe which is the best kind for the everyday cook.

This soup is absolutely delicious!!! I added a yellow squash, and some Brussel sprouts. I quartered the small Brussel sprouts and probably only added like 6 for a 12 serving pot. I will definitely be making this again.  I couldn't stop eating it lol. I did less carrots but only because I was adding in the other veggies. I recommend this recipe.

We enjoyed this very much. I didn't presoak my lentils at all. The only thing was that for me, this turned out like more of a stew than a soup. It could have been something I did though I followed the directions.
It was still really good and awesome for my husbands diet.
We did top it with frozen yogurt and green onions. Thanks for sharing.

After reading many reviews, I prepared this recipe today with some of the changes reviewers suggested and added a few of my own.  I added 1 link (I only had one) of Cajun style Andouille sausage, 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon of Turmeric. I also used red wine instead of white, left out the carrots, used 2(14.5) cans of stewed tomatoes, 1(14.5) can of petite diced tomatoes, and 1(8 oz.) can of tomato sauce. The finished soup had great taste, nice body, and a bit of a kick. Will make this again!

I made this a couple of days ago and I think it's a good base recipe.  I did make a lot of changes.  I used more broth, one more rib of celery, balsamic vinegar and red wine instead of the white wine.  I used only one bay leaf (it had a strong bay leaf taste, so I definitely wouldn't use two).  I doubled the garlic, added a dash of cumin, a couple of tablespoons of hot sauce, and eliminated the carrots and parsley because I don't like them.  I used a frozen pepper/onion blend instead of fresh onions and I didn't cook any of the vegetables first.  I just put all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook on high for about 5 hours and low for another 2.  I didn't have to add any additional liquid because I like my soup thick.  If you like a thinner soup, you might have to add more broth or water.
I will say that if you don't like tomato based soups, you will NOT like this unless you make changes.  The crushed tomatoes and bay leaf make it remind me of how spaghetti sauce tastes.  The main reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it still seemed like it was missing something.  Next time I will add some ground beef or stew meat and see if that helps.

I have made this lentil soup about 3 times now, and have made it exactly following the recipe and once added some curry flavouring to it, they were all delicious! Lovely on a cold winter's day with some good bread!

I made a few tweaks (red instead of white wine, added ham bone and a little bacon and used the bacon fat with a little butter and olive oil to saute the veggies in, used a little more lentils and added some thyme and fresh spinach, used 3 reg sized cans stewed tomatoes that I hand squeezed in a bowl before adding and added a tablespoon or 2 of tomato paste to the veggies after they sautéed before I added the liquids), and this was AMAZING! It smells fabulous cooking! First time I've made a soup with lentils and it was so easy and delish!

I added more lentils and some cumin. YUM! This is a great recipe! KIDS LOVE IT! I did puree half of it then mixed it back in. I made it seem more like "Madres Lentils" brand. I do love this flavor more though!
You must try this!!!

Really good soup. I have never made a lentil soup before, but this one was delicious. Took another reviewer's suggestion and added some cooked brown rice, and this was a good addition. Really thick soup...and I fully recommend the fresh parmesan as garnish!

Liked this quite a lot. The day after I made this I threw in some butter beans & chorizo and it was really good. I am cooking this again tomorrow. Thanks.

I wasn't totally in love with the texture, so I ran the soup through the food processor.  I think it could also use a little bit more spice.  I would probably add a couple of cloves next time.

Good recipe, I tweaked it a bit with more garlic and more wine. It is very filling. My kids even ate it and they can be picky eaters.

Yum! This was pretty easy to make and tasted great. Freeze the leftovers for quick weeknight dinner. Plus, with a few minor changes, vegan-friendly!! Thanks for sharing!

This was a hearty lentil soup, overall I'd absolutely add it to the bi-weekly menu.  I'd change just a few things.. 1. Use whole (canned) tomatoes, instead of crushed.  I personally like my tomatoes to be something I can bite into and know I'm eating it.  2. Increase the amount of celery to 3 and decrease the carrot to 2, or just buy smaller carrots. 3. I added bacon (5 pieces, diced) and that added a smoky flavor that hit the spot.  But, I needed to add water to reduce the saltiness of the soup.  Plus, I like my broth-based soups with a good amount of broth.  Excellent soup base, you can dress it up or down for your taste, def should be added to your recipe box if you like savory and lentils.

We liked this a lot. It's definitely a make-again. In place of the cheese called for, I used a few Parmesan/Romano/Asiago (or whatever I have) rinds from the freezer. It's a fantastic way to use those up. Thanks for sharing!

I have never eaten lentil soup before, but we hit the jackpot with this one!  Followed the recipe exact and it was perfect.  In fact, I was almost done putting all the ingredients in when I had to make an emergency trip to the hospital and had my friend finish it.  She said she thought lentils had a funny flavor, but "this soup is fabulous."

I thought this was great. It had a strong tomato flavor, but it really was delicious. I added some diced yukon gold potatoes, so mine came out more like a stew. I also used fennel stalks in place of the celery and it did no harm. :)

This is an awesome soup.  Very flavorful.  I switched the chicken broth with vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  I cooked it in the crock pot for a few hours and it was perfect.

It was good but next time I will use less basil. Too much of it made it taste sweet and I like my lentil soup very savory.

This was fantastic!  My husband said I should have something else for dinner in the event our ten year old daughter wouldn't eat Lentils.  She tasted the soup to check for doneness.  She said it was great!  She had 2 bowls!  I will not add the salt next time as our Italian parmesan adds enough salt.  Also, I added Chicken Sausage.  Definitely a keeper!
