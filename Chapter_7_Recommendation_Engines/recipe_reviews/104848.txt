Easy and yummy!  I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so I did the 3 tbsp. of cocoa + 1 tbsp. of oil = 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate method.  I used marshmallow fluff and 2% milk instead.  It was delicious on brownies.

This was very good and got compliments, however I don't think it should be beaten.  Instead, I folded the ingredients together because I didn't want to lose any of the fluffiness.  It turned out great that way.  Also, I didn't add much liquid (maybe a tablespoon) because I was afraid it would be too runny, and mine turned out thick and creamy.  Thanks for a frosting recipe that is something new and different.  :)  (**as a side-note, the reviewer who suggested that maybe 3/4 cup was a typo and that one should use 3 to 4 cups of powdered sugar is incorrect.  If you use that much sugar, you will definitely get a grainy texture.  I only used 1/2 cup and the texture was great).

i needed a quick frosting and it HAD to have marshmallow cream in it (so my husband said)  and this recipe was perfect.  I didnt have any half and half, so i used 2% milk.  I made 24 chocolate cupcakes and filled them with a marshmallow cream recipe and topped them with this chocolate marshmallow frosting.  They taste wonderful.  They are for a halloween party. thanks for a great recipe....also, i added maybe another 1/4 cup powdered sugar to make it a little sweeter.

As written, the recipe calls for way too much milk.  I had to use 1 cup of powdered sugar to get any volume back in the runny frosting.  It just oozed off the cake.

This frosting is pretty good. I'm glad I always try the recipes instead of taking to heart what others say because I followed the recipe and my frosting came out very fluffy. It is the consistency of the marshmallow fluff, so I doubt that it will be stiff enough as written to pipe with. It pretty much takes on the flavor of the chocolate that's used, with a hint of marshmallow.

This was so good!  I only had 2% milk and that worked wonderful, but I did not need as much as what was called.  This is a keeper for me. Thanks

This was a really tasty frosting. Very light and whipped like, almost close to jar frosting in my opinion. It nearly squirted out of my piping bag to fast and nearly had it everywhere. But I would increase the amount of confectioner's sugar next time for a really thick or stiff frosting and/or use heavy whipping cream in place of 1/2 & 1/2. Not spreadable very well for a large layered cake, But for a little bit of frosting on a cup cake or cookie...very nice.

I found this frosting to be more like a ganache.  I was not fluffy and ran off my cake, and puddled around the base.  Maybe I did not beat it long enough, I would have beat it longer but I dropped the mixer on the floor and it refused to function again.   I do believe the 3/4 cup of conf. sugar is a typo.  I used 3 to 4 cups of confectioner's sugar.  It had a tiny bit of grittiness, I found the texture to be off putting.  Oh well I will try it again and beat the  out of it.

I thought this frosting was great. 

To those reviewers who thought it was too thin - it clearly states that the half & half should be added as needed. You can't just dump it all in there and assume it will turn out well. The same frosting recipe may use varying amounts of liquid from batch to batch depending on thetemperature and humidity in the room.

Colossal disappointment. Too runny and if you add more sugar all it tastes like is sugar. No marshmallow taste, which is what I was looking for. Ruined my cupcakes. Would NOT use again.

I needed a no cook marshmallow frosting so I borrowed this using the creme and I added butter instead of shortening, then left out the chocolate.  It worked.  It was delicious and I could make my Easter cupcakes.

Great frosting recipe!  I made with melted white chocolate and added to top of chocolate cupcakes, then sprinkled on coconut.  Was a HUGE hit at a recent party!

I had to pipe up and say that this recipe works perfectly fine exactly as written.  I had my doubts, particularly because of other reviewers' comments. I didn't give it 5 stars because I really don't care for marshmallows, and this definitely still tastes like marshmallow when it's done - just a rich chocolate marshmallow instead of a regular one. It used up my marshmallow creme, though, and that's what I was aiming for, so I was pleased. I don't think it would frost a layer cake.  I frosted a 9x13 only on the top, and had very little extra.

This is yummy - but I made some modifications. I used 3/4 stick of real butter and 3/4 c. of cocoa powder. It is more like a ganache texture - do not try to pipe with this frosting. I topped cream filled chocolate cupcakes with this decadent topping and they taste amazing!

I followed the recipe exactly as written ...slowly adding half & half. The flavor was great but it would not fluff up.....just oozed off my cupcakes. I only added 1 1/2 T of the half & half and it was still runny. Nobody seemed to care though and they devoured the cupcakes. I would have just preferred the frosting to be thicker.  I would try again and make a few change cause the taste was totally there!

This frosting was easy to make, easy to spread onto the cake, and tasted very good.  I took the marshmallow a step farther and actually pressed them into the sides and top of the cake.  I used this on a chocolate cake and we all really enjoyed the flavor.  I would not recommend this as a piping frosting, but rather a spreading frosting because of the consistency.

Loved this! I went a little overboard this weekend and made two birthday cakes for my mother-in-law, using this frosting for a chocolate cake. I have been wanting to try a marshmallow frosting for a long time! It was very yummy. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, but the full 1/4 cup of cream. I had "plain" shortening as opposed to butter flavored, but it still tasted great. Will definitely be making again.

Is fluff the same as marshmallow cream? If so, this recipe just did not work for me!  I followed everything except omitted the chocolate since I wanted white marshmallow frosting.  When I beat with a mixer, it whipped down to very little!  So, I then doubled the recipe, yet it was still very runny so I added an extra 1/4 cup softened butter and 1/4 cup shortening and confectioner sugar until it was thick enough to spread.  It tasted really yummy; just like fluff!  So, I don't know if I messed something up with this recipe or what!

Smooth, creamy but not too sweet.  I piped it onto cupcakes and need another recipes to cover all 24 cupcakes.  Probably enough if I'd spread it lightly to cover all of them.  Off to make another batch! Delicious!  Yum! Yum! I only used 1/8c half & half.  Maybe could have used more confectioners' sugar, but didn't want it too sweet.

I made this frosting as listed in directions, my daughter loves the taste of marshmallow and with chocolate it was a definite winner, the icing was perfect, it was more of a ganache kind of icing, but an amazing amazing flavor, I would use it over and over again.

I really like this frosting.  Make sure you gradually add the liquids if you want the frosting to have a shape.  My frosting spread and didn't retain the shape I had piped on.  The taste and texture is great.

Sticky and sweet but good.  I used 1 cup of confectionary and only 1/8 cup of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in order to get the right consistency for a cake decorating tip.  I also did not have butter flav. shortening so I used real butter.  This recipe barely covered 20 cupcakes with my decorting tip.  Next time I will up the ingredients a bit.

Tastes like fudge.  I’m not sure if I let the chocolate squares cool enough after melting.  After I added the 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, 1/8 cup half and half and the rest of the ingredients it was pretty runny.  I added the remaining powdered sugar but not the remaining half and half and it was still too runny to pipe onto my cupcakes so I put it in the fridge for 10 minutes.  I tried whipping it after that and decided to add more powdered sugar. A total of 1 cup added a half cup at a time.  By the time I got it in my bag to pipe it had thickened quite a bit.  By the time I was ready to clean up the remainder had thickened to the consistency of fudge. I guess I just wasn’t patient enough.

I just finished making this frosting. It  did not turn out fluffy for me.  I actually did not use the chocolate squares, I used chocolate chips. I still gave 5 stars because the flavor is amazing.  I also added some vanilla and some chocolate extract. Very tasty. Thank You for the recipe.

This cake was very tasty! I made it for my mother's birthday and everyone loved it. I am glad that I read previous reviews about the baking time because I checked mine after about 26 minutes and it was done. I also really liked the marshmallow frosting, the flavor was great. I didn’t pay attention to what I was doing and added the vanilla before beating the eggs, so my frosting wasn't fluffy, but it still had good flavor.

This recipe has become a staple for my cupcakes.  People love it.  Like many have said, I barely use the milk. (I now use Parmalat because I am always nervous about not refridgerating items with milk.).  I probably only use a tablespoon of the Parmalat.

This ended up turing up delicious, but I had to add about a cup of powdered sugar to keep up the consistancy. This could have been however because I added skim milk instead of half and half...

I made this for chocolate truffle cupcakes and it was very good.  I did use butter.  Will make again and try it with different flavors.
