I like the idea of pineapple with spam which I wouldn't have thought of myself, so I gave it 3 stars, but I didn't care for it.  I made it again after I fried the spam on each side until lightly browned, and then grilled like a grilled cheese sandwich.  Cut in half.  All the kids I had over that day said it was the best, so I will make it again for them!  Cooked slices of ham would taste better with pineapple though. I generally fry (drained well) pineapple with cubed ham, and then place on top of crescent for the adults. ;)

I made it just like the recepie except I onely made one.. Must say I do not like cheese on spam.. I used fresh pineapple and cut the spam a little thiner since it is so salty.. Well I would cut out the cheese just adds more salt..

My mom used to make this, but instead of pineapple we used tomato.
