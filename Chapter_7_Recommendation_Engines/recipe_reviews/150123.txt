UPDATE!  My mother called a few weeks ago and mentioned that she had tried making a variation for Valentine's Day with the zest of an orange and 1/8 tsp orange oil.  AMAZING!  and beautiful pressed with a springerle mold and then cut with a heart shaped cookie cutter!

I was so daunted to make this... my fiance had made these beautiful wooden moulds so I could make these cookies for Christmas this year, and I was afraid to use them. I decided to make a preliminary batch this weekend, just to see if I could do it without embarassing myself. They turned out BEAUTIFULLY. They're almost too pretty to eat, but of course you must try them, and are they ever good!!! I love them with Chai tea. I'll be making another batch for the holidays, and will post pictures next time!

These were great. My mom said they were just like her mom use to make. I did add a little lemon zest because that's the way my grandma used to make them.

Thank you so much for this terrific recipe. I'm Australian, and I had never heard of any biscuits ( cookies ) like these, especially with the anise seeds, and the length of time between cutting out and baking. 

Leaving them in a tin overnight made them chewy, rather than very hard as they were when they first came out of the oven.

I cut them out with a diamond shape cutter, but may have to invest in a proper springerle mould for next time. We don't have these in Australia, but thank God for the Internet!

I especially liked the fact that they are so different from most other cookies, because of the anise seeds, and the fact that they are not as sweet as most cookies. 

I followed the recipe exactly, and they were perfect - everyone loved them, and I'll definitely be making these again.

Thanks so much,

Jan from Geelong, Australia

MAN! This is the first springerle recipe I have ever made that A) turned out and B) tasted good! Usually the anise flavoring in springerle cookies is too much for my taste, but these are superb! I have yet to find a traditional springerle board, but I cut them into squares and used a vintage Christmas rubber stamp to put a design on them. Thanks so MUCH for sharing this recipe!!

This was my first introduction to springerle.  At first, I was unsure of these because I am not a fan of black licorice.  After being talked into trying them, I was very surprised to find that anise in cookies is actually tasty!  I really enjoyed these and was pleasantly surprised.

My dough was too moist and I had to add at least half a cup of flour to make them roll-able. I will try the recipe again and see what happens.

I, too, have many molds from House on the Hill, and have used their recipe, which is much more fussy than this.  The molds are stunning; they'd better be for the cost, and people are always blown away by them-as if I carved each cookie myself! I have found that crimped cookie cutter shapes--square, rectangle, circle, do a nice job of finishing the cookies.  I have also used stamps intended for ink to make nice impressions.  I love "painting" the cookies with various food coloring recipes, although I have not found one that is quite what I'm looking for--does anyone out there have suggestions for this?

I liked the look of this recipe compared to the one that was passed down from my grand-mother, to my mother and then to me.  I use a Springerle rolling pin rather than a mold, but I may see if I can find a mold for a different look.  I have not yet inherited the rolling pin my mother got from her mother.

Update!2019 - I used wilton luster dust in 2018 and it was horrible! Went back to oasis pearl and pharaohs gold I got on Amazon awesome!  I tried 3 different springerle recipes including martha's- this is the best tasting recipe by far!! And will be my permanent recipe from now on. Taste and texture  are the most authentic. Originally i added  way more flour however from now on I will add more flour as needed when rolling. - reg flour is best! No need for cake flour or over beating eggs like other recipes suggest I painted mine with luster dust and pinch of anise extract. MIX the extract and dust in a little bowl with small paint brush. Update! 4 th year making! IF you don't want powdered sugar or flour on cookies so you can paint them spray molds with Pam instead of dusting w/sugar. Also I keep additional flour  to a minimum for softer dough that way you can just press molds with hands instead of using a mallet. Honestly I didn't even use rolling pin this year I just flattened dough w/ my hands then pressed pam spray molds on. Design stayed put - nice clean cookie to paint! My cookies are the first 7 photos for reference with and without powdered sugar dust. I highly recommended keeping dough as moist as you can and still be able to roll. There's no need to add excess flour your imprint will remain without it! I do notice the imprint is better when I use flour instead of Pam so if your not painting just flour your "molds" really good not the dough!

I haven't tasted a decent Springerle since my mother made them fifty years ago. This recipe is IT. I made half with anise seeds and half  without, and worked a teaspoon of vanilla into the plain half's dough, because anise isn't for everyone.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and they turned out perfectly, and I did NOT have the pleasure of trying to work a couple of eggs into nearly two pounds of flour (which so many Springerle recipes seem to require: "7 cups of flour, 2 cups of confectioner's sugar, 3 eggs" -- and then expect  a workable dough from that. NO. Just no. If I want upper body strength, I'll join a gym).  THIS recipe, cut precisely in half, makes a quick, easily worked dough that is just enough for about 2 dozen cookies -- plenty for a cookie tray, but not  so many that they will be around until St. Patrick's Day. Perfection. Thank you for giving back one of my favorite childhood Christmas memories.

I've been making Schpringerle for over 20 years for Christmas, a German tradition. This is a very good recipe. Definitely need to add lemon zest. To those far away (Australia ), may I suggest logging on to the King Arthur Flour website to locate moulds or rolling pin. Happy Baking!

This is the 2nd year I have made these.  Like others, I had to add flour to be able to roll and mold the cookies.  Other than that, it is perfect - just like the ones my mother made!

Mine were too moist to start also.  I just added more flour to get them to roll out.   And I added anise oil to get a stronger flavor.

This is my first time trying these cookies and I agree with what most have said. They turn out great! At first, I didn't have enough powdered sugar on top and the mold stuck, but I got it the second round.

Love this recipe....I am so happy with the detail on my impressions - clear and crisp.  They seemed to become crisper after baking.  I use a pastry brush to brush off excess powdered sugar after they have baked and cooled.  Looking forward to using this recipe and playing around with different flavors.

The recipe is sound and I think my issue was user error, or at least inexperience. Also, I didn't use anise seeds since DH doesn't like anise. Instead I used 1/4 t of orange oil. They are tasty for sure, but they poofed up a LOT. I'm thinking maybe I didn't let them dry long enough before baking. Not a total disaster, but not photo-worthy either.

This is a decent springerle recipe if you really, really don't want to use hartshorn (baker's ammonia.) The cookies held their designs well after 24 hours of drying and baking. They have a slightly chewy texture and a rather hard exterior. I found them most pleasant to eat when I dunked them in coffee, like a biscotti. For a recipe without hartshorn, it's pretty good. But nothing will give you that magical combination of a sharp molded design + the perfect soft, cakey, eminently satisfying texture like hartshorn leavening. If you can't find hartshorn, use this recipe. If you can find it, absolutely use it. Once you have a true, traditional, hartshorn-leavened springerle cookie, nothing else will satisfy you.

Perfect cookies! Traditional, not overly sweet. Great with coffee. Pure flavor from the anise seed. Yumm

Was good, but has anyone ever 'finished' it? Many of the 'old timers' would use food colors to 'paint' the Springerle.
