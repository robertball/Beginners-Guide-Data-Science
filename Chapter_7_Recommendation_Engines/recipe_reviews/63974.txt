I found this recipe back in 1986 in a Redbook magazine.  This is a great dessert to take to a family get-together.  I highly recommend it.

I made this for my mom's birthday and she loved it! It is so moist and sweet I love how the cinnamon tastes with the chocolate, I baked it in a 13x9 pan and didnâ€™t use the nuts it turned out perfect This is the only chocolate sheet cake recipe I will use form now on!

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. The cake was a bit on the dry side and the cinnamon gave it a "stale" taste. The icing tasted like raw sweetened condensed milk and was a gooey mess. Everytime a cut a square, icing would pool at the bottom of the pan where the piece used to be. Maybe I did something wrong but I won`t be making the recipe again to find out!
