This was a good recipe but nothing like the navy bean soup of my memories. I remember them as creamy and without tomatoes. Nonetheless, it was good once I changed my expectations.

Omitted tomato sauce added 1 cup brown sugar and that's IT.  SOUP IS AWESOME!!!! Just goes to show you sometimes the simplest least fancy looking food can be the heartiest simple pleasure for everyone eating it.

We love this soup! We do a variation and use Northern beans and sometimes do homemad Italian sausage instead of the ham. Still very good and a very hearty meal!

I must admit-I didn't have high hopes for this recipe.  I have other navy bean and ham soups I like better, and they don't have tomato sauce in them. I couldn't imagine liking this...but I did.  The tomato sauce was subtle and gave it a slightly different taste. I didn't add the ham hocks because I have discovered they always make things entirely too greasy to suit me. Toward the end of the cooking time, I added some thawed leftover ham I had in the freezer. The only complaint I have is that this recipe needs salt, but that's not hard to add to my taste preference.

LOVE this soup!  My family has made it for years.  We do it just a bit different...we flavour the broth with a handful of black peppercorns, and when it's all done cooking we add half a bottle of ketchup.  I was VERY hesitant to try it when my cousin made it for me for the first time, but I was blown away.  How could such simple ingredients taste so good?!!?  Very warm, filling, and comforting!

Until I made this recipe I had never had Navy Bean Soup and probably never will again.  I expected the beans' consistancy to be much softer, especially since I soaked them over night and cooked them for 11 hours in the crock pot.  The broth was greasy too.  The funny thing is my dad actually liked the soup.  I guess it's all in the perspective.

Good soup.  Will make again.  Really easy with only 4 ingredients.  I had no tomato sauce on hand so I used 1 jar (maybe 16oz) of my home-canned marinara sauce.  One caution: in my experience, no matter what the cooking method, Dutch oven or Crockpot, you need to soak those beans overnight - unless they are the no-soaking kind. I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe.

Use Great Northern Beans and put half of soup in blender when done then mix all together is much creamier. Add a little brown sugar and it taste like baked bean soup. Can use half ham and half bacon if you want. Gave 4 stars because I changed it some. I use to have a daycare and the kids liked it because it was sweet (and healthy)

Although I had made some changes, this recipe is pretty easy to put together and very tasty.   Instead of water, I added equal parts of chicken stock and vegetable stock, just covering the beans.  I added onions, leeks, cabbage and carrots to cook with the beans.  Later, I added potato.  Came out beyond fabulous!

This recipe is great!  And thanks to Amber for the brown sugar suggestion.  That is exactly the flavor I was trying to capture!

Simple yet satisfying. I did a quick soak on the beans instead of overnight and then simmered the soup for 2 hours and the beans were still tender. I used skinless turkey sausage instead of ham. I had to add salt but the family really enjoyed it!

Awesome! I wasn't sure considering the absence of seasonings, but you don't need them! I made it exactly as stated and it turned out great!

I made this dish. I soaked the beans over night.. in the crock pot I mixed the beans with a little bit of water, onions, ham hock, left over ham from thanksgiving, added carrots and corn.. instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of tomato soup and a can of tomato paste.. seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic salt and a dash of cumin. it simmered on high for about 6-7 hours.. it was amazing!
