I halved the recipe and used it on ham slices that I had heated in a skillet. The glaze thickened nicely and my family devoured the ham.

We really liked this.  It was mild, but added just the right of tangy sweetness to our ham.  I grilled ham steaks on the grill, and brushed them with this a couple of times towards the end of grilling.  Super simple...will use on ham again!

I tried this recipe for our christmas ham.  I microwaved it for 5 minutes and took it out to stir it and all seemed well.  I put it back into the microwave for the final five minutes.  When I came back to the microwave to get it, it had boiled over onto the bottom of the microwave.  I had to use a spoon to chip it off of the microwave turn table and it melted my microwave safe bowl...not to mention the smell of burned sugar the permeated the kitchen.  This recipe has problematic issues.

I actually used this glaze over stuffed pork chops.. It was magnificent!! stuff and  bake chops for about 20 minutes, then pour the glaze over chops and finish cooking.. approximately 45 more minutes.. serve with a nice green salad and your done.

Easy and tasted good.  Used on ham slices that I fixed in the oven.  Will use again.  Did add some honey as suggested.  I did not have the can of mandarin oranges.

This is wonderful...but I will offer two pieces of advice to anyone who is making it.  First, microwave in shorter bursts, stirring in between.  Mine would have boiled over if I hadn't.  Second, don't heat this up until you have the ham out of the oven and ready.  I fixed this first and then pulled the ham out...and the glaze was a solid rock!
