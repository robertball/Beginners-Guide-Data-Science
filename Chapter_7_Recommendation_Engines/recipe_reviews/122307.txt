This was excellent! I halved the sugar after reading the reviews and next time I will probably cut back on the oil too but all and all this was a great recipe and one I enjoyed very much. Thanks!

It was good, but perhaps a little on the sweet side for us.  I would try halving the sugar next time.

Recipe has potential, I cut the sugar down to a tsp, cut the oil in half, and added a healthy squeeze of dijon mustard to the mix.  Pretty good, good way to use up the left over corned beef from St. Pattys day!  I used a bag of shredded coleslaw because I was lazy, worked perfectly!

Excellent ~ a great variation of corned beef and cabbage! I did use Splenda, as we can't have sugar, as well as olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. Served it with some whole wheat pita bread. Yumm!!

This was excellent for a hurry up meal!  Like other reviewers, I halved the sugar - it was still actually too sweet for me, so next time I think I'll cut it back even more and add a teaspoon of mustard - which I like with corned beef and cabbage.  I used grapeseed oil, since it has neutral flavor and supposedly excellent health benefits, and I only used 1 tbsp for the stir-frying part.  I used baby cut carrots, sliced lengthwise, and forgot to get the scallions so I just used chopped yellow onion.  Really tasty meal - only the excessive sweetness holds me back from a 5-star rating, but I think that's easy enough to adjust next time I make this!
