***** + more. I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Very good.  Thick soup.  Want a thinner soup; add milk. If you don't have time and want a very fast potato soup, this is the recipe.  Have more time and want a better tasting soup, use fresh potatoes.  The second time I used fresh cubed potatoes, sliced baby carrots, one stalk celery and a little parsley.  Excellent.  This soup would be very good served in a bread bowl.  It is a very good tasting basic recipe that you can make your own.  The secret ingredient is the country gravy mix.  If you don't like onion and red pepper for the original recipe, use hash browns without the onion and pepper for the fast version.  Don't like carrots or celery for the fresh potato version, don't add.  You could also add ham or cooked crumbled bacon at the end and warm through.  I have been looking for a good potato soup without cheese for quite some time.  I finally found it.  If you want, you could add cheese to this soup also and it would be very good.  Like I said, this is a very good basic soup that you can tweak to your own liking.  Thank you Stephanie.

Holy cow, Stephanie.  You outdid yourself on this one.  I can hardly believe that so few ingredients are capable of turning out a soup with the rich and creamy taste that this soup has.  It's a piece of cake to make and so amazingly good.  It really tastes as if a master chef had prepared it for an upscale restaurant.  I only have one caveat to share.  I could not find the fat-free country style gravy mix.  If anybody knows where this can be found or even what brand to look for, I would appreciate the help.  I went to two different stores and still couldn't find the fat free stuff.  So, I settled on Williams Brand Country Style Gravy Mix.  For those of you that are nutritionally conscious, there are 15 fat calories per serving and 40 calories per serving in the package I used (37% of the gravy mix calories are fat calories).  Though I'm not a dietician, with the no-fat potatoes and nearly fat-free chicken broth reducing the impact of the gravy mix's contribution to overall fat in the recipe, I suspect this is still an acceptable low-fat choice.  Though I suppose you probably shouldn't have 2 1/2 large bowls like I just did.  I couldn't help myself.  Honest.

This was great!  Very filling!  I didn't have any of the frozen hash browns, so I just used fresh potatoes, bell pepper, and onion, measuring out the 16 ounces total.  It added a little time for chopping, but it worked out great.  I did add a little parsley and some pepper and used fat free cheddar and chives since that's what I had.  I will make it again soon!

This was all right.  I found it a bit bland so I spiced it up with extra salt, pepper, and a cajun-type seasoning.  It is not a bad soup, but I probably won't make it again.

This soup is great.  I added extra onion flakes and garlic powder for more flavor.  I also used a gravy mix with pepper.  Compliments to Stephanie.

This was quick and easy!  The peppers and onion in the frozen potatoes give it a nice flavor and the pepper in the gravy mix seasons it perfectly!  We had it without the green onions and cheese and it was thick and delicious.  I would make this again with no changes.

I loved this soup, the country gravy really made it unique.  I used regular because I could not find fat free.  I used a larger bag of hash browns and i think next time i would add more chicken broth and another gravy packet.  I also plan on adding some diced ham next time I make it.

This soup is great low-fat meal.  It is very filling, and cheap to make.  Spice it up to your liking, but either way you won't beleive the low amount of calories, for all of the flavor you get.
2 thumbs up!

I couldn't find fat free gravy like other reviewers, so I ended up using McCormick's Original Country Gravy. WIth that change, it made the calories per serving around 160.  However, I really don't think this recipe makes 6 servings, unless you're serving a few tablespoons of soup to each person.  This makes more like 4 small servings. I also couldn't find a 16oz bag of hash browns, so I used a little more than a half bag of Ore-Ida O'Brien potatoes which comes in a 28oz bag.  Given all that, this is a great recipe for how easy and quick it is to make! Very thick and creamy, perfect for a cool fall day. I didn't have to add any additional spices, but this of course, will depend on the brand of gravy you use.

I made this twice and it was delicious!! You could not tell at all that it was low fat and it was so quick and easy to make! My daughter and husband both loved it too. Only changes I made was using the 20oz bag of hash browns and 3 14.5 oz cans of broth, 2 packs of country 1.3oz packets of gravy. My husband and daughter both added real bacon bits and extra cheese but I kept it healthy and pretty much stuck to the recipe! Fantastic!

My fianc√© and I just made this soup as our rainy day lunch.  It was fantastic and super easy!  This will be repeated at our house a lot!!  At our grocery store, the hash browns come in a 20oz package and the broth comes in 14oz cans, but the recipe still came out perfectly using those as is.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a keeper!!

I couldn't believe how good this soup was with just these simple ingredients. It seemed though as if something was missing with the flavor.  It needs a little zip to it.  I am not a hugh cook so this recipe looked easy enough.  I added some crumbled bacon and some frozen veggies and it was very delicious.  I will definetly make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Extremely easy to make! Overall, the recipe was just okay. I'm not one for gravy which is probably why it wasn't a huge hit with me.

Love this recipe!  I didn't have frozen hash browns so I used frozen tator tots instead. Adding in a 4oz can of diced green chilis. It turned out great. Kids and I loved it!  Second time I made it with hash browns.  Still very good. We prefer the tator tot version.

Fast and easy with ingredients you can always have on hand.  I seasoned with a little more salt and some Cajun seasoning but that's because we like things a little spicey.  It's cold here now so this potato soup hit the spot.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and I added chives instead of green onions - I thought this had less of a punch than green onions and was really delicious. I'm trying to find a low sodium gravy mix for next time. This has become a regular lunch item for me! Super easy and great. Thank you!

I made it the way the recipe was written, but added mini cubed ham (96% fat free) because my husband feels he needs meat with every meal.  For those looking for fat-free country gravy, I also did not find any packages stating they were fat free, however after looking at the nutritional value on the package, the one I chose was clearly fat free (I bought Williams brand).  The soup was absolutely delicious and very filling.  Thank you for sharing the recipe and I will definitely make this again.

Rated recipe as is.  This was very good and as others said, it can be customized to what you want.  I got 4 main dish servings out of it and added extra milk, since it is pretty thick.  I also added more onion, celery and 1 chicken bouillon cube.  You could easily use plain cubed frozen or fresh potatoes & add your choice of veggies.  The gravy mix I used was heavy on pepper so taste before you add black or white pepper. Couldn't find fat free gravy mix.  Thanks, Steph from Susie

This was a great easy soup to prepare after working a long day. It seemed to lack something so my additions of a 10oz pkg of chopped frozen broccoli, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 T. chives, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and 3/4 cup of the cheddar melted in the soup elevated it to quite delicious. The chives were totally necessary IMO to take it to the next level. The gravy mix is brilliant to create that yummy, creamy texture potato soup must have!

delicious!  to me it tastes more like chicken pot pie soup, therefore next time i might add peas and carrots.  anyhow, it is a great base and you can it as is or add whatever you like to it.  keeper!!

This was super easy & very tasty! I also could not find the fat-free country style gravy so had to use the regular.

After my 2 changes this would be a five star to me.  I followed the directions exactly, but added broccoli for some veggies and half a packet of four cheese potato seasoning.  It was YUMMY!!  It was perfect.  will definitely make again.

Great soup, super easy and tastes great every time! I add shredded cheese into to the soup as well as on the top.  I realize that makes it much less healthy but it's delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I add celery seed for some added taste.  I am also having trouble finding the fat free gravy mix and have had to buy it online.

Wow this is so easy. I wanted to use up my garden potatoes, and this soup was actually really good. You can use any kind of gravy you like. Personally I don't like beef gravy so I used turkey gravy and it was excellent

Excellent Recipe!!  I added about 1/2 cup chopped carrots and 1/4 cup diced celery.  Added a tiny bit of ham (but don't think it was necessary).  Held off on the cheese to make it a little healthier, however, the green onions were great!  Will definitely make again!

super easy and super yum. I used 4 cans of broth because it was very thick and it turned out great.

I used Campbells reduced sodium canned chicken broth and used 4 cans. I simmered one chopped onion and 3 garlice cloves in 2 cans of broth for 10 minutes. Then added one package button mushrooms sliced and simmered 5 minutes. I then added potatoes and boiled 10 minutes. I added 1/2 gravy packet and 1/4 cup water plus 1/4 dried french onion soup mix. The gravy taste was too strong for me but the french onion made it perfect. Grate fresh swiss cheese on top and it's YUM. Hardly any calories or fat.

I love this potato soup. Super quick and easy!  The garnish of bacon, green onions and cheese really tops it off. I usually stir a little cheese into the soup.

Super easy! Super quick! Super good, especially for being reduced fat! The only thing I changed was adding fresh onions and green bell peppers since the hash browns I had on hand didn't have these in them. Will be a regular on cold days!
