Made this for a colleague’s retirement. He loves coconut and this got high reviews from everyone who had some. He even took some home to his family. Couldn’t find the chocolate Maria cookies so I used chocolate graham crackers - worked just as well. Didn’t change anything else and will definitely make again.

I used graham crackers instead of the chocolate wafers.  Dangerously delicious.

Used chocolate graham crackers (2/3 if the box) but will likely use vanilla wafers next time. Put tinfoil over half way through because I didn’t want coconut to get too brown. Served with raspberries to add some color. Delicious & will definitely make again.
