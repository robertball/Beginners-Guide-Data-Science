Used fresh Bing cherries and grilled the salmon- turned out great! The kids weren't sure at first (cherries on salmon, mom??) but they really liked it and so did the adults. Good, different and savory use for cherries. Would be good on chicken or pork as well.

Made this last night for friends. It was great! Fresh and summery, we really enjoyed it! A real different taste for salmon.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious and easy to make. Even my toddler liked it which is saying a lot since she typically wonâ€™t touch fish. The adults loved it too.

My boyfriend loved this recipe! I made a few modifications that worked out very well. 1. I substituted chicken for salmon 2. I marinated the chicken before baking with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper 3. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine 4. I didn't have butter, so I used a dollop of butter spread. It was wonderful!

Loved the sauce: just used a can of cherry pie filling plus recipe's original directions. Something we'll make again for a change, but didn't like the somewhat fishy flavor.

I actually would like to rate this 3.5 stars.  The cherry glaze had a very subtle taste.  I added a little shallot to it and increased the honey but it still didn't pop.  I had to use Ahi tuna because the market was out of salmon, but I didn't allow a difference in fish to affect my rating.  Not sure how else to make it better, but an improved glaze would be tasty on fish and pork.

Ok, we loved this, but there a few significant alterations.  1.  we used steelhead - love living in the Pacific Northwest; 2.  Use "Oregon Fruit Products" - Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water; 3.  Used the water from the canned cherries as it was just under 2/3rds of a cup of liquid with an added 2 shots of brandy and a splash of a dry white wine.

THIS WAS AMAZING...Will use this repeatedly and often.

It was okay but I was expecting more. The cherry glaze added only a subtle flavor to the fish which I was a little disappointed in. Might need a few tweaks to improve the recipe.

An unusual change for salmon and very very good but not the sort of recipe I would use on a regular basis.  Definitely use fresh cherries, if possible, just no way that artificial tasting cherry pie filling is going to suffice.   It is indeed unfortunately that some reviewers actually wrote a review after having used the filling

Really good recipe - my company loved it! I used tart cherries from my freezer and reserved the liquid to use instead of water. I followed another suggestion here and added a jigger of brandy after the recipe had thickened. I also used more seasoning on the fish, but I doubt that made a difference. I substituted rice vinegar for red wine vinegar only because That's what I had. I put the salmon on a soaked cedar plank and put that on a cookie sheet, because we love the cedar flavoring and it turned out to be the perfect complement to the cherry sauce.

I scaled this recipe down to a single serving, so I really should make it again with the full amount of ingredients to give it a proper review. I didn't  adore it, but I think I may have added too much cornstarch, or perhaps I did not cook the sauce long enough after adding the cornstarch (there was a bit of a chalky taste to me). Also, the cherry glaze really insulated the salmon from the heat, so I probably should have cooked it longer, as I prefer my salmon more on the well-done side (shh, don't tell anyone!). I will try this one again, and soon, as cherries are in season right now!

Made as written, aside from using frozen cherries.  Felt that the vinegar overpowered any cherry flavor and was a little strong, even though the juice from the thawed cherries was used in place of the water for the cornstarch.

I made several modifications with this sauce.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  The first time I made it with red wine vinegar, it was very vinegary.  Balsamic gave it a much more mellow flavor.  I also added some caramelized onions to it and my husband loved that addition. This is a good base recipe.

It was very sweet, I used lime juice to tame down the sweetness.  I will not make this recipe again.

On a cold fall night without fresh cherries I tried this. I wanted to warm it up a bit so I used brandy instead of red wine vinegar and frozen cherries. I avoided the fishy flavor by grilling the fish until it was almost done then I finished it under the broiler with the glaze. My husband who doesn't love to eat fish,loved this. Don't forget to salt and pepper the finish product. Really brought out the flavor.
