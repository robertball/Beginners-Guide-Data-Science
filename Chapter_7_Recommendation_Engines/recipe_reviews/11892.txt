I wanted to reduce calories without sacrificing flavor in this recipe, so I substituted fat-free half and half for the heavy cream - no discernable difference in taste and greatly reduced the fat!!  Also added a generous amount of freshly gorund black pepper.  It was a huge hit!

We love this one so much that I made it the night I asked her to marry me!  We use fat free half and half also, and don't miss anything.  I've tried it with regular bacon in a pinch, and it's definitely worth a trip to the specialty store (or aisle) for the pancetta.  The pancetta just gives a great salty bite to the sauce.  I serve with fresh bread and a simple salad.

Made this for our best friend's wedding anniversary celebration and it was beyond fabulous. They, along with my family, are asking for this dish constantly, even the picky kids liked it. Had a little trouble finding the pancetta but was successful in the end. Also used Gray Goose vokda.  Superb! Easy! You can't get any better than this. I also served with it a warm goat cheese salad, fresh French bread and chocolate Grand Marnier creme brulee.

Wow...I don't know where I went wrong with this recipe. I used all top-notch ingredients...imported pancetta, top-shelf vodka, high quality tomato sauce, real Parmigiano-Reggiano...it just wasn't that good. In fact, without the good cheese, it tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee. I won't bother making it again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  It was one of the most delicous vodka sauces I have ever tasted and it was so easy to make!  I added two cloves of garlic (minced) in with the pancetta and sprinkled some onion powder and a dash of red pepper flakes.  I would defintely NOT omit the pancetta as that added such a delicious flavor.  This is a keeper I can't wait to make this again.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it as well!

Thank you Rick for posting your recipe. And thanks to all the others who felt they also had to post their recipe under your reviews instead of posting their own version under Recipes.

I just made this tonight. I didn't feel like having penne so I made blackened chicken with mushrooms covered in this sauce. Heaven on a plate.

This easy & tastes so good.  I am giving my version a four as I did not have pancetta - used regular bacon and diced onion & garlic, near the end a pinch of herbs.  I also served with chicken & basil tortelleni as that is what I had on hand, plenty of flavour.  Looking forward to finding some Pancetta in NZ & trying it the original way.

What a phenomenal sauce! I took the suggestions from other reviewers and added  two cloves of minced garlic,  finely chopped onion, and red pepper flakes for some heat. I also used half and half to save a few calories. My husband thought that I'd gone out and picked up dinner from one of the local Italian eateries until I disabused him of that notion. Served with garlic bread and salad to complete the meal. Excellent!

This recipe is  definitely a 5 star! It caught my eye and I decided to take a chance and make it for a large amount of people for Mothers Day. It couldn't have come out better. Even thripling the recipe, came out great. The pancetta is a bit pricey but definitly worth it!
I did add  some crushed red pepper and glad I did.

No reduced fat or fat-free here.  I go all out with vodka sauce.  I love this stuff over cheese tortellini, but I need to try it over penne next time.  I don't use the pancetta because I like the taste of the sauce by itself.  Thanks Rick. Hey Linda...I had to call my grandma to find out what corn flour was...so your not alone.

I've been making this sauce for years. I've used several different pastas - penne, tortellini, raviolis, any pasta that "holds" the sauce, b/c its so delish (oh, long fusilli works very well too!) I tried it this time with the pancetta as recipe stated and it was good, but I prefer prosciutto (what mom & nana used). I also add minced onion to the prosciutto while sauteing' & 1 tbls butter; also, I (not nana) use fat-free half & half, which makes absolutely no difference!  It's also great sans prosciutto/pancetta. In lieu of the shrimp, you can also try grilled chicken strips (my fav!)

This recipe is a favorite in our house.  This time I added some fresh garlic to the pancetta.  Also in an effort to watch the waist line I substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream, the fiance didn't notice a differece, so that was a success.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I've always wanted to try this recipe when I see it out at my favorite Italian restaurant, but I always get distracted by something else on the menu. Found this recipe a while ago and made it for dinner the other night--it's delicious! Easy to make, but tasted like it was a lot harder!

This is excellent! I have made this a number of times and am surprised that I hadn't taken the time to review it! I sub fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 for the whipping  cream but otherwise I make it as directed. It is simpe and EXCELLENT!

I have made this twice now, and highly agree with the people who say the pancetta makes or breaks this recipe!  The first time I used a high quality pancetta that I bought from our Whole Foods store and it was OUTSTANDING! The second time, I used pre-packaged pancetta that I got from our local Walmart, and it turned out only eh,ok, not quite the same quality as it was the first time. With that said, I cant see how substituting bacon for the pancetta would even begin to give this the flavor it needs to be a superb dish. Will definately make again and again, but only when I am using the high quality pancetta!

I did a few changes, mostly adding to the amounts of ingredients, but instead of the bacon I used spicy Italian sausage and Hunt's spaghetti sauce since I didn't have enough tomato sauce on hand. Then I topped it with grated parmesan cheese and baked it at 350 til it all melted together. My finicky teenaged daughter absolutely loved it and declared that it is "a repeat," meaning that we'll add it to our "do again" menu.

AWESOME! I did make a few changes. For 8 people, I made it 1 cup Vodka and 4 cups sauce and only 1 1/2 lbs pasta. That made just enough sauce for the pasta I made. Next time, I'll double the sauce so there's extra to spoon on top. Oh, and I didn't add the cheese. I just sprinkled it on top of everyone's plate. DELISCIOSO!

Man...I don't know.  Maybe I didn't use a high enough quality of vodka, but..ewww.  Followed exactly and my husband and I were like cringing after every bite.  Too much vodka.  Got good reviews so maybe it's just me.  Yuck!!

Phenomonal recipe. I made this for company and they raved. I had never worked with Pancetta, and am glad i found it at the market. It really does add something to this dish. So smooth and rich, great combo with the fresh bread, and apple avocado salad with tangerine dressing as well from this site.  Finale was pineapple pie from this site as well. Definately a 5 star meal all the way.

16 oz was too much penne pasta; 10-12 works better. Could definitely use more seasoning during cooking. There are much better vodka sauce recipes out there

You will not find a better vodka sauce that's easier to make...you might not find a better vodka sauce, period. We prefer chunks of pancetta (or prosciutto) to thin-sliced, and our local Acme sells Daniele brand diced pancetta in 4oz. containers; we use one container per batch. Note: when using pre-diced meat, the fat is not trimmed; cut down on the butter by half or it'll get greasy. If you're dicing your own meat, trim off the fat and keep the butter, or keep 
a little fat for flavor and adjust the butter accordingly. A 1/2 cup of diced red onion (per batch) goes in with the pancetta, and Rao's marinara is the sauce of choice. Smirnoff vodka. Heavy cream. Parmesan goes right into the pot after the sauce is finished simmering, and some shaved Parmesan goes on top along with lots of fresh Italian parsley or basil. We always triple the recipe and freeze what we don't eat so it's ready to go the next time the craving hits. Because the craving always returns ?? Thanks, Rick!

I enjoyed this. It originally just tasted like a spruced up spagetti sauce so I modified it and put less vodka, more cream and used a pasta sauce with garlic and herb added to it. I also added my own fresh garlic, sun dried tomatos (this makes it really pop and taste great!)  and put some parm directly into. It was amazing! Oh and I used real bacon instead of pancetta (gives it a much better taste)

Yes, but changes; being a Texan in a very small coastal area, pancetta was not available; HOWEVER pork tasso from LA was. Gave the sauce an interesting spiced taste; add the vodka & it was great. Sorry, even if I could find pancetta, I think I'd still use the tasso. Also added fresh mushes too plus green onions (white & green) & garlic & onions for sauteeing- those are necessities in my dishes!

Way to much cream first start out with 1/2 cup less of the cream you can always add in but not take out. My son & his fiance and I worked on this recipe. We added alittle Italian seasoning also a bit more marinara sauce was need  We also made some Text garlic toast that we bought at the store to go on the side. They also told me to say that this was made with love

Penne a la vodka has ALWAYS been my favorite dish. I used to work in a tiny little italian restaurant and they had one of the best penne a la vodka recipes I have ever tasted. This, however, definitely exceeds that recipe hands down! It was amazing and i can't stop getting people to stop hounding me for the recipe!

I really like this. It's good as is, but I usually add a scallion and a couple of minced garlic cloves (softened in butter) to the sauce. Then right before I take it off the stove I stir in some chopped fresh basil and the parm.

This was a hit with the bf. Substitutions and additions: I used Tinkada gluten-free rice Penne, cooked for 15 minutes instead of regular Penne. Tito's vodka was awesome in it and less pricey than Goose. Full fat heavy cream and Boar's Head Pancetta. For extra flavor, I added to the recipe 2 cloves of garlic, one small onion and half a small, red bell pepper, all minced together in a food processor. I added these ingredients after reducing the vodka and pancetta mixture. I also added about 2 cups of frozen jumbo peeled shrimp: defrosted in a pyrex in the sink with cold running water for about 15 minutes and then strained, placed back into pyrex and flash cooked in boiling water (just pour over them) until cooked through. Since the shrimp will float out of the container unless weighted, I keep a small sieve over them to keep them in the pyrex and keep the h2O flowing. Add the cooked shrimp and sauce to the Penne and cook 5 more minutes to allow flavors to meld. Sprinkled individual servings with fresh-grated parmegiano-regiano and fresh-ground black pepper. I served this with a spinach salad with toasted pecans, chevre and homemade shallot/red wine vinaigrette, and a nice Red Zinfandel.

This is a very good recipe, but the taste depends on the pasta sauce used. I like to use Prego; I find it has a lot of flavour.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes to make.  I wasn't sure how the bacon would taste in it, but I absolutely love it.  I also add green onions, green pepper, red pepper, and diced tomato to it to add a little flavor variety to it.

delish. I made this tonight with minor alterations: added a few more splashes of heavy cream (till I got that nice classic pink color) and melted the parm in the sauce. I like vodka sauce that sticks to the ribs. I think next time I will sneak in some green peas.

Having read the comments of other reviewers I too added 2 large cloves of garlic minced and one medium onion diced and WOW!!! Five stars doesn't give this recipe justice. It was absolutely fantastic. Will serve with shrimp next time. Fast, easy, delicious...doesn't get much better than that.

The sauce was good, but did not taste like your traditional vodka sauce.  We felt the tomato sauce overpowered the dish a bit.  We will be looking for more recipes.

As per "Apalley's" suggestion, I also used fat free half and half. We couldn't taste the difference. I served this with Penne pasta with the addition of shrimp. My gang loves pasta dishes and they loved this. Thanks for a very tasty and easy recipe Rick! Josie-maybe the I.M. would be the answer. I could have used that yesterday when one of my recipes called for "pastry flour". What the heck is that? Let's talk to Michelle and see what she thinks.

This was just ok.  My husband liked it a lot more than I did.  I did not have pancetta so I substituted bacon which became soggy in the nondescript sauce.  I may give this another shot.  Turns out I was coming down with the flu so I'm guessing (hoping) my taste buds were off.

The key ingredient to this is to use a good PASTA sauce, not plain tomato sauce since that doesn't have any type of special flavor, there are no herbs or spices in plain tomato sauce. To give it a little more zing you need to add fresh chopped garlic sauteed along with the pancetta, maybe even some diced fresh basil.

I sauted two cloves of garlic (minced) in the butter, and didn't use the Pancetta.  It was so delicious.  I can't get enough!  The sauce freezes really well (and reheats in the microwave), so you can always have some ready.  My only mistake was not doubling the recipe so I had more available.

This was delish and so so easy!  Nice and creamy.  We added a dollop of ricotta on top and served with peas.

I have tried other recipes and it did not fare out so well. However, this one was a hit with my family for a Valentines Day dinner! I served it alongside some parmesan crusted baked chicken. Yummy!

Great recipe!  Made it for the first time tonight and based on other reviews and other pasta with pancetta recipes, I edited the recipe a bit.  I used half & half instead of cream.  Added garlic (5 cloves, minced), sliced white mushrooms (~1 cup), 1/2 cup of diced white onions, and black pepper.  Also used spaghetti noodles instead of penne.  Dish turned out great and very flavorful.

The sauce turned out really good!  I did add some additional ingredients and we all loved the final outcome!  I made some bacon & seasoned chicken to add to the pasta/sauce and sauteed some chopped onions and mushrooms in the butter with some garlic.  I also  added some peas, sundried tomatoes, boursin garlic & herb cheese (because we had some) and basil.  Very good - especially with garlic bread! The only change I would make next time is to make extra sauce.  Bon Appetit!

Excellent and quick/easy recipe.  My husband and I think that next time we might add some sun-dried tomatoes for an extra punch of flavor...we'll see.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I also substituted fat free half and half added 2 cloves of minced garlic at the end of the pancetta browning step and sprinkled with a touch of red pepper flakes. Thanks Rick for the recipe!

This was good for what it was and pancetta definitely added good flavor.  However, I was disappointed, because it really just tasted like tomato soup with pasta mixed in. *shrug*

We liked this recipe. I used bacon instead of pancetta because that's what I had, and also sauteed some garlic and onions in olive oil, thus eliminating the butter altogether. I halved the amount of pasta, but kept the sauce the same. That was perfect. I don't think there would have been enough sauce had I used a whole box of pasta.

This may replace my weekly spagetti dinners!  We love our tomato pasta, but this was a very nice change. I sauteed onions with the butter and added a bit of oil, then added some minced garlic and then the pancetta. I added a number of italian spices (italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, parm. cheese and red cayenne pepper) to the sauce once i added the tom. sauce and cream.  It was lovely!  Not a bite left between the THREE of us!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Followed recipe with the following additions: browned two cloves of garlic in the butter, doubled the sauce (used Italian Seasoned Tomato Sauce,)and because I could not find pancetta, I cut a boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite size pieces, seasoned with salt and pepper, and cooked it up in some butter and garlic before adding to sauce.  Hubbie absolutely raved. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is unbelievably delicious as is; however, my family likes it so much (I make it once or twice a month) that I modified it to make it healthier and cheaper.  I substitute low-fat evaporated milk for the cream and turkey bacon for the pancetta.  I also omit the vodka and add extra tomato sauce instead.  Still tastes great!  Peppered bacon also is good in place of the pancetta and gives it something extra.  Yum!  Thanks so much for this recipe- one of my all-time favorites!!

I used the basic recipe but added chopped garlic, shallots, cayenne pepper flakes, and 1 can of tomatoes.  Instead of putting in the vodka alone, I added it with the tomato sauce.  I added the cream last.  I only was able to use regular center cut bacon.
It was very good and better than any canned sauce I've ever had.

I thought this was great, but I had to double the recipe though, hubby and I didn't think it was enough for the pasta. I also had to reduce the amount of tomato sauce. It overpowered the first batch I made. I also added about 5 cloves of garlic. I didn't have pancetta so I used regular bacon. But because there's already butter, I boiled the bacon for a little bit(using the same water for the pasta)to get rid of some of the oil. I didn't want to nix the butter because I thought it added to the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I made a couple alterations, but this recipe is great!!  I love Italian food and order this frequently when I am in good Italian restaurants and this recipe is a pretty good version.  I made about 1 1/2 times the recipe for the same amount of pasta.  I also added about 1/2 pound of cooked shrimp to the sauce right at the end.  I sauted 3 cloves of minced garlic withe the pancetta (right at the end of the pancetta browning).  Also, I added about 1/2 cup of parm to the sauce at the end, in addition to the parm I served on top of it.  Yum!!!

I loved this recipe.  Like others, I added a large shallot, red pepper flakes, and used bacon instead of pancetta, as I couldn't find it in the store. A little fresh basil at the end makes it extry yummy :)

After reading other reviews I sauted three cloves of garlic and half a yellow onion in the melted butter.  I substitued shrimp for the pancetta and did not add them until until the sauce was simmering.  Be careful not to cook the shirmp for too long so only add them to the sauce in the last few minutes.  I also cut back on the pasta because my husband and I like our pasta more saucy.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This was mahvelooous! I had to make several substitutions because I am going out of town this weekend & don't want to grocery shop until I get back. First of all, it's just me & my grandson for lunch so I halved the recipe. And I know I was cautioned against it but I used proscuitto for the pancetta & it was a very good substitute....little salty but I would expect that from the pancetta as well. I am out of cream so I used evaporated milk & I only had about a tbp. of parmesan so I used that plus a couple  tbps. of romano. I also added a bit of fresh oregano, mainly because my oregano plant would be very upset w/ me if I made tomato sauce w/out it.  ;o) Thanks for a tasty lunch...my grandson enjoyed it too!

This was a very good and easy recipe. I took advice from some of the others and added a clove of garlic and a shallot.  I used it on only about 3/4 lbs of pasta.  Will make this again as my picky kids loved it.

We loved this sauce!  I added a good healthy dose of garlic (several cloves, minced) and other than that, left everything the same.  There were no leftovers to fight over with this one!!!

Easy and delicious. Followed some of tips suggested, add 1 shallot, 1 clove garlic while frying the pancetta and used 3/4 box penne. Added to my recipe box, a real keeper. Thanks.

I know the pancetta is the key but this recipe is best suited of the vodka sauces to taste rich after adapting it for vegetarians. I used it with 4 cheese ravioli, no pancetta, for a spectacular quick dish. The first time I made it I didn't cut the recipe down so I shared the rest with my neighbors for a rave review reheat. The proportions are just right for a tasty sauce that won't dominate a star pasta. Other members of the family use this recipe first to compliment lobster ravioli. Delicious!

I have searched long and hard for a really good vodka sauce...I think I have finally found it.  This sauce has a wonderful flavor!  The pancetta is the key...do not leave it out!!

Excellent recipe.  Add a couple cloves of garlic, and a couple of shallots and it's wonderful!  I have made this without the pancetta and I added a bunch of fresh basil leaves to it and that was really good too.

Very good! I used regular bacon, against the recommendation, and we thought it was great ... especially over whole wheat penne.

I call this cheaters penne but there's nothing wrong with that! It's delicious and fast. For variety try it with rigatoni instead of penne. Add a generous handful diced plum tomatoes that have been softened in the pancetta drippings and add a little diced smoked chicken to the sauce and heat through. Garnish with chopped green onions and pop open a good Italian red. Bravo.

This recipe was good, but could have been a bit 'punchier' and I think next time I will add garlic and cayenne or red pepper, plus a bit more vodka.

This was tasty!  I didn't have pancetta on hand, so I used bacon.  I accidently added the vodka before cooking the bacon, but it turned out great.  Also I used a can of the diced tomatoes with garlic, basil & olive oil, for a chunkier version.  Great stuff.

Excellent and easy recipe!  Instead of pancetta bacon I used prociutto.  Thanks Rick, I no longer have to spend $15 for this dish at my favorite resturant.  This is just as good if not better.

This recipe was so quick and simple! Being a vegetarian, I am always nervous about making meat dishes as I will not be able to taste the final product - but I made this for "Italian Dinner Night" with my friends and the guys called it PHENOMENAL! I couldn't find pancetta bacon so I used regular instead - I also used a chunky tomato and basil sauce - and added the cheese to the sauce before I tossed it with the pasta as was suggested by another review.  The consistency was great the crowd kept coming back for more.  Next time I will try it using the half and half suggestion.  Thanks Rick for giving me a meaty pasta I am totally confident in making again!

Very happy with this simple recipe.  Big hit at a recent function.  I have tried variations with and without normal bacon, sauteed onions, and citrus vodka.  All work well.  May try the half-and-half suggestion that somebody else mentioned.  Thanks!

Easy recipe and very tasty.  Instead of putting the cheese on top of the pasta at the end, I added it to the sauce as one of the last steps.  It made the flavors meld nicely and it gave the sauce some substance.

I've made this twice now, once with store bought sauce, and one with homemade. Both were excellent.the one thing I disliked was the pancetta floating in about 4 tbs of fat, so, while I understand wanting to soften the taste with butter, I drained the pan before adding the vodka. Everyone in my household loves this dish, and they get a kick out of the vodka as ingredient. (For those of you wary of the vodka, I assure you that you don't taste it, it simply adds flavor to the pancetta and helps finish off its cooking). Lovely, creamy, oh and USE AS LITTLE SALT AS POSSIBLE if you make your own sauce. Between the pancetta and the Parmesan you're all set.

I used whole wheat penne pasta. I changed it up a bit didnt have any pancetta. Made my sauce with 1 Italian sausage link, 1 can diced tomatoes 1/2 can tomato sauce, added some cooked zucchini, fresh basil and oregano, a pinch sugar and of course the vodka and heavy cream.  Topped it with pecorino/romano cheese. We loved it!

So worth 5 stars. I have been trying recipes for years. I'm finally done. This is the best one ever. Tastes like it was made in a restaurant. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Only I added the cheese to the sauce while it was still cooking.  make sure you use real pancetta, and chop it as small as possible... YUM!!!

Added diced garlic to pancetta while sautéing and a little basil to cream sauce.  Otherwise it was very good.  My husband said it was definitely a keeper.

There is a small Italian restaurant near me that is known for the Penne Vodka;absolutely scrumptious.I found out what they use that makes it so good.Now this sounds crazy but it's Canadian bacon chopped finely.I had my doubts but tried it anyway.Wow! It's excellent.

Very simple basic sauce. Instead of going to the market for canned sauce. I go to my favorite Italian restaurant, and order marinara, to go. Its the same sauce they use for their pink vodka sauce. Once home you can adjust everything else to your liking. I like to use cream, to a medium pink, and add the vodka last, before serving.

Because I live in Brazil, I used "cachaça" and I can tell you that it tastes better than had it have been with vodca. BE AWARE that the alcohol DOES NOT all evaporate during cooking. Also, since "cachaça" is very sweet, be sure to use a extra salty meat to even the dish out.

I am not sure why this recipe has been rated so high. Without adding the suggestions of others and my additions, this sauce would have been very bland and thin. To the bacon I added fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, basil, parsley), and 2 each green onions and garlic clove. At the end it was still thin and bland so I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, a generous amount of fresh ground pepper and crushed red pepper flakes, and dash of kosher salt.

Overall very good. It came out a little salty for me, but still good. I made two additions, I added minced garlic and parsley to the sauce. I didn't have penne pasta on hand so I used spaghetti instead.

Nom nom nom (that's fat kid in me talk right there) because this is just delicious!!! My family makes bigs quantities for parties they throw and you'd think Olive Garden or Carrabba's made it, they never know it's something we easily made ourselves! It's that good. I've added both shrimp and sausage to this recipe and just love it. You can't go wrong with this recipe. No modifications needed.

Made with fat free half and half and threw in some garlic with the pancetta. It was awesome!! I made this while I was roasting brussel sprouts (also from this site) and the timing worked out perfectly.

The recipe is good.  I like a little more flavor, so I added 1/2 cup of sour cream, a handful of mozzarella and some basil.  Here's the thing with this recipe, the process is awesome.  There IS something about adding the vodka with the butter!  Everyone loves this recipe.  I make it by the "Sunday Sauce" pot and freeze it in quarts!

Holy macaroni, this is an awesome sauce!! The recipe is perfect as written. The market didn't have the right pancetta, so mine was diced, as opposed to the strips. Taste wise, no difference whatsoever. But I could see how it would add to the attractiveness of the dish and then seeing those beautiful little piggy strips wrapped around my fork, weaving through the linguine would be just plain art. LOL Oh ya, I didn't have penne on hand, so I used linguine. You know? As I sit here and type, I'm already getting excited to eat it for lunch tomorrow!! Enjoy, this is a truly great recipe!!

Oh my god - I LOVE this!!!!!!  So easy and so so so good.  Many people have commented that they added onion and garlic.  You don't need to if you are already using a tasty tomato sauce.  I use this one: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-marinara-sauce-yet/detail.aspx which is so simple you won't believe it and I always have some in the freezer for recipes just like this pasta one.  By the way I only had bacon on hand and it was fine.  I'm having it again tomorrow and I can't wait - woohoo!!!!

I really like the basis of this recipe, but I made a few additions. I sautéed finally minced onion in a combo of olive oil and butter. I also added fresh basil and hot pepper flakes. This recipe is a great starting point to add the flavors that you like. Also, I have made both with and without the pancetta. It's delicious both ways.

I used this just for the vodka sauce recipe and thought this recipe was a great starter recipe.  I did make some modifications including adding sautéed onions and crushed red pepper and removing the pancetta since we don't eat meat.  I also blanched two tomatoes to remove the skin and added them to the tomato sauce.  I cooked the butter and vodka sauce for about 1 minute and added the tomato sauce and cooked for a good 45 minutes on low before adding the cream.  This was so amazingly delicious, I will definitely make it again.  We made our own pasta using the basic pasta recipe from this website - also highly recommended.

This was VERY good! LOVED IT! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I found the pancetta bacon on the top rack with the regular bacon. It was a very quick and easy and tasted Great!

This was pretty good and it's easy.    I used my homemade spaghetti sauce (where it says tomato sauce) and then mixed in the other ingredients.   I think if you used just straight tomato sauce from the can, it would be  very flat.   At least buy a good marinara spaghetti sauce as the base.

I made this tonight for supper.  It is one of my husband's favourites at a restaurant.  I stayed  true to the original recipe and it was very good (3.5 stars).  We are already planning on adding our own modifications to make it even better.  Definitely would recommend adding some spice to the dish: fresh garlic, onion powder, chili flakes,, etcetera.  We added mushrooms to this batch and are planning on more pancetta.

I have made 66 recipes from this site.  Waited for the pancetta to get nice and brown in the butter before splashing it with a 1/3 cup a vodka.  The vodka visibly worked some sort of chemical magic while it instantly deglazed the brown bits in the pan.  

My step-daughter, wife, and I all rank it as our absolute fave.  Leftovers rating for my daughter and two sons will come.

OMG! This was by far the best Penne Vodka I've ever tasted.  The pancetta is what sets this apart.  I didn't change a thing but I did add some basil from my garden (I'm a basil fanatic!).

What a fabulous dish! Like many others I swapped fat-free half and half for the heavy cream. I also pan seared chicken tenders, then I sliced and added them to the final product. The recipe called for tomato sauce, but that was a little broad. I used Safeway's Basil and Garlic sauce and it was perfect for this dish. I am quite pleased to have finally found a penne and vodka sauce recipe that I can easily make.

I made this for my fiance and he loved it. I used half and half instead of cream and I added red pepper flakes for a little extra spice. I also added browned chicken and sauteed mushroom and onions to make it thicker (I sauteed the mushrooms and onions with the pancetta). I found that the sauce was a bit too salty, so I also added about a tablespoon of brown sugar.

I omitted the bacon and added some minced garlic, per my personal tastes.  It didn't have a ton of flavor, but I take responsibility for that.  :o)

Great recipe, I make it all the time!  A couple additions/modifications I make (as others have):  Along with the pancetta I add fresh minded garlic and onions (careful not to burn the garlic).  Also, once it is all simmering I add crushed red pepper for some kick and also some Parmesan cheese to help thicken the sauce.  In addition I let the whole thing simmer for maybe up to 30 mins to also help with thickening.

This is excellent!  I used bacon as suggested since I didn't have pancetta.  I boiled it before for a few minutes just to take out some of the smokiness  Definitely recommend this one and making it again this week!

I combined this recipe and the "Tomato Vodka Sauce" recipe and it was as good as the sauce at my favorite little Italian place. Seperately, both of these recipes are OKAY but missing something. Comibing them did the trick. I made my own sauce with a 28oz can of chunky crushed tomatoes and a smaller can of diced tomatoes. I added chicken (2 breasts) and cooked it in 2TBSP of butter with 1T olive oil, one small onion diced, and 1 garlic clove finely chopped until the chicken was brown on the outisde and the pancetta was browning. I added the Vodka (1/2C) and after a few minutes the tomato products and whipping cream. I used more than 1/2C because I used more ingredients and wanted more sauce. I simmered it and topped it with Parm to serve.

too much grease...I recommend browning the bacon, draining the grease and then adding the butter. also spiced it up with basil, pepper, oregano, and diced tomatoes.

Excellent recipe! Made this for dinner and my husband and kids were raving. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try but my picky 7 yr. old, the one who we struggle with every night to finish his dinner,  ate all of his - so it must be very good!!! I used a jar of Trader Joe's Organic Tomato Basil Sauce for the tomato sauce.

This is the single best dish I ever made or ate at home. I changed NOTHING.  The pancetta made the dish!  Restaurant quality, absolutely delicious, and SO easy! Make sure to get the pancetta sliced thick so that it's easy to dice.  Enjoy!!

I made this recipe last weekend.  And it was a hit.  My mom is very picky and she loved it, too.  I substituted prosciutto for the pancetta and added some frozen green peas.  Thanks for the great recipe, Rick.  I can't wait to make it again.

This was easy and quite good.  I did make a few changes:  added one chopped onion and 1 tsp. garlic to bacon drippings and sauteed, used my own marinara sauce, used half and half instead of cream and added hot pepper flakes.  I will definitely make this again.  I would like to try it with the fat free half and half as others have suggested.

I have another tomato vodka recipe which I love, so I was skeptical. This is way easier to make.  However, this was packed full of flavor. I also used onion.  Will make again.

This was absolutely delicious.  I had to modify it as I didn't have the bacon or cream but it still had the most delicious flavor and I'm sure if I had all the ingredients, it would have been out of this world.

Use fat free half and half instead of cream to majorly cut down on fat (already not super lean).

Very good sauce.  We used packaged cubed pancetta which I thought was too big and chewy but loved the flavour.  Next time I will find a deli and have it sliced very very thin then chop it and see how that works out.

Delicious!  I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and some chopped onion while browning the pancetta, and threw in some oregano, basil and parsley along with the tomato sauce, since I used a very plain version.  It turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

It was delicious! I added fresh basil, omitted the pancetta and added grilled chicken. The only reason why I did not give it the full 5 stars because I actually had to make a second batch of the sauce just to cover my 16oz box of penne pasta! Other than that, it was great!

Okay...I tried this one for the first time this week and it was fabulous.  I did not change any of the recipe for the sauce, but I did put the sauce on cheese tortelini with grilled chicken.  My husband and I both loved it I can't wait to try it again.

So so good. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. We eat this all the time. I use bacon instead of pancetta because of cost. Otherwise no changes. Thanks!

I found this dish to be just ok. I have made other vodka sauce recipes that turned out better. This one needs lots of doctoring. It's just a little to bland. If I make again, I will definitely add seasonings.

This was great.  Just finished having some for lunch and wish I had made more.  Will definitely make again, but would double the sauce (vodka, tomato and cream part), and quadruple the pancetta.

Excellent!  The only slight change I made, was to double the sauce (butter, cream and tomato sauce) and cut down on the amount of Vodka (I used half of what was noted).

My husband and I have never had anything with a vodka sauce and this was awesome!  It was so easy to make and the added blackend chicken made it even better.  I read some of the other reviews and I used thick cut bacon, added minced garlic, parsley, crushed red pepper, and regular black pepper.  This added a little bit of bite to it and was excellent and will so make this again.

I was totally against the substitutions (low fat etc) BUT i did change it a bit...We had some leftover lobster from New Years eve...held the pancetta, added lobster. It was yummy. To avoid the rubbery lobster I cooked over low heat in pesto and butter. Very simple and quick.

I have used this recipe many times and it is always devoured by everyone.  I triple the sauce for two pounds of pasta.  I also only use about a third of a pound of pancetta and use homemade sauce that I make the day before.  Excellent!

This was easy and delicious! Changes: My local store didn't have any pancetta, so I used prosciutto instead. Also, I just eyeballed the amounts and added red chili peppers and shrimp to the sauce. Delicioso!

I didn't have pancetta but used regular thick sliced bacon and it worked well.  Made it for all of my friends and everyone is still raving about it 3 weeks later...

I really liked this recipe.  My husband thought it tasted like tomato soup but said it was ok.  I have to agree; it was somewhat reminiscent of the  Campbell's soup.  I used bacon in place of pancetta (couldn't find it) and tomato sauce with garlic and onions.  Good for a quick meal.

This is a VERY, Very good sauce 'beginning', I only gave 4 stars because I wasn't liking the color, so next time I'll bump up the cream a bit.  I used smoked bacon(1/2 lb) because we like it....and added the suggested garlic and onion from other reviewers. I also added 3 cut-up boneless chicken thighs that I stewed first in heavy italian seasonings. I had to thin it down a tad with milk, as it was sooo thick, but BOY WAS IT TASTY!!  Thank you for the inspiration!

I used this recipe for Easter Dinner (second course). I tripled the recipe, I was serving 15 adults and it was plenty. I follwed the exact directions, no substitutions and it was amazing! Everyone raved about it. Thanks for sharing this recipe I will make it again in the future!

This was reallllly yummmmy!!! I added a few things though, I chopped up a medium sized onion and 5 or 6 garlic cloves (on medium heat and let it brown slowly) before I cooked the pancetta. I like my food to have a little extra zing!!

A fantastic recipe.  I stewed the ingredients (minus the cream) for 45 minutes and then I pureed them in the blender, adding cream while blending.  I think my boyfriend asked me to marry him because of this sauce.  no jokes!

Easy and fast. The pancetta is what brings the flavor to this dish so do not substitute.

This sauce is excellent and so simple. I use proscuitto instead of pancetta and I use pecorino romano cheese.  I always get lots of compliments and cook it every year for our christmas party.  It goes so quickly that I have to quadruple the recipe!

Thought this was good...I have been dying to replicate a Penne a la Vodka dish I had at an Italian eatery, and while this is not it, it's still good.  I didn't have the pancetta so I sauteed some baby bella mushrooms up instead.  Very satisfying - and adding chicken to it might be a great option as well.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  I made it for friends last night and it was a big hit.  I did add 2 Shallots and 2 Cloves of Garlic and instead of Pachetta I used Prosciuto.  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

Thought it was too salty and the texture lacked substance with just the pancetta. I may try it again with chicken as the main meat and  pancetta as a compliment.

I also added the two extra garlic cloves and chopped onion.  THIS WAS SUPERB.  I did cut the amount of pasta in half and next time will probably double the sauce for leftovers.  Absolutely restaurant quality.

This was terrific. I, too, added two cloves of crushed garlic and one small chopped onion. Sauted in butter several minutes, then added the pancetta and proceeded with the recipe. This is restaurant quality. Delicious.

Delicious!  I added chopped garlic and shallots when cooking the pancetta and I usedf half heavy whipping cream and half fat free half and half with good results.  I topped it with fresh basil and the parmesan cheese and it was a big hit with my Husband.  Thanks.

This is by far the best recipe I have tried for penne a la vodka. I did have to make some modifications - I crushed two cloves of garlic and added it to the pancetta. Next time I will use 4 as it could use a little more kick. I also chopped fresh basil and stirred it in just before serving. Topped with freshly grated parmesan. I could not stop eating this it was that good. Served with italian bread to dip in olive oil and top with the parmesan and more basil.

We loved this! I used mini penne and cooked thin slices of chicken breast in the pan before the pancetta, kept it warm in the oven, then added the chicken to the sauce while thickening. It came out perfect.

I've tried this recipe with both bacon and pancetta. The pancetta is mos'def better. I usually double the amount of it - that's how good this pasta is. The quality of the vodka made a difference to me, I prefer a higher end grain vodka like, Effen. I think I'm going to try using Absolut Pepper next time. Worth trying at least once. It's a staple in my house. Thanks Rick!

All I can say is WOW---this is great!  The first time I made it we thought it might be a little bland on the spices, so I added 2 chopped garlic cloves and a small chopped onion while the pancetta was sauteing, but the second time I just substituted the same amount of Ragu traditional spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce and we thought we died and went to pasta heaven!   Thanks Rick.

This recipe was really great. I made it with the heavy cream first for my boyfriend, which went over big. I put diced onions, panchetta, and tomatoes in along with the rest of the ingredients.  When I later made it for myself, I made it with the fat free half and half subbed in for the heavy cream-- it was delicious and you cant taste the difference! (but you'll see the dif. in your waistband in the morning...)

I am very picky about my pasta sauces and this recipe seemed too easy to be good, but it was terrific.  I have made it 3 times and it is easy and delicious and was a great meal to take to my friend who just had a baby.  I have made this with canadian bacon and parma ham as well and it was great.

I also used prociutto. I found this recipe to be a bit salty and also a bit too acidic for my liking. I know there is a way to get around that, but I am not sure what it is.

I couldnt find pancetta so I used bacon - still came out really good. If you use bacon you dont need the butter though. My husband was amazed at how quick it was to make - tasted rich and creamy and will definately be a regualr on my table :-)

This turned out to be delicious.  I can see how the pancetta is important as its prosciutto-like flavor really dominates this dish.  I made this for my boyfriend and his best buddy, who are real meat-and-potato guys and always wary of what they call my "interesting" concoctions.  They actually LOVED it and gave it the title of "best interesting dish I've ever made".

I have made this countless times and everyone including the kids have loved it.  It is easy quick and a real crowd pleaser.  Just wanted to update my review from 2002, it's now Nov 2007 and we still love it.  Double the sauce and we like to serve with salt and pepper ribs,  Again thanks Rick

I added thinly sliced (length-wise) garlic and fresh ground black pepper. it was off the hook!  It paired nicely with baked salmon and cauliflower.  We're doing this recipe again!  I might add shallots next time - stay tuned.

Among the best I have ever had and the whole family agreed! One critique I saw said it tasted like chef boy r dee. Well he clearly did not follow directions. I’m guessing he did not let it simmer. My only change was adding fresh basil (because I have a garden full of it) and then let it simmer and I put the Parmesan cheese in the sauce instead of sprinkling it on top after it’s done. We will be doing this again and again! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I rarely cook so I was thrilled to find out how easy and delicious this dish is. My guests went back for seconds. I realized at the end of the evening that I had made a mistake and put gin in my sauce instead of vodka! So apparently gin works in this recipe too. Definitely making this again ... next time I’ll try vodka : )

This is a great recipe! My hubby and teen girls loved it. I agree about not substituting the pancetta, it really makes the recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe states and will not change a thing.

I added minced garlic and diced onion with the pancetta. I also added salt and pepper to the sauce. When I plated I added some freshly chopped basil. It was tasty but next time I think I will use half the amount of pancetta called for and add Parmesan cheese directly to the sauce while cooking instead of just as a topping. My husband loved it and it was fast and easy so I will definitely make it again!

I really liked this recipe.  I added a chicken breast with salt pepper and garlic powder to the pan after the pancetta and used tricolor veggie penne.  I took the chicken out of pan after it was golden brown and put back the pancetta, then finished the recipe as directed. I also added fresh spinach when I mixed everything together.  Then sliced the chicken and put it on top of the pasta followed by shredded Parmigiano Reggiano.  It was great!

I probably add more cream than the recipe due to personal preference and I don't measure.  We also like serving it with tortellini, too.

Absolutely amazing!!! Super easy to make. I added two cloves of minced garlic once the butter had melted before putting in the vodka and it definitely added to the flavor!

This was so delicious! I doubled the sauce ingredients but everything else was made as per recipe.  Made with grilled chicken sausage. Will make this part of our list of regular meals.

We loved this sauce since it was easy to make with a minimial amount ingredients.  I did not use  pancetta bacon instead used garlic and diced onions.  It was a bit on the tart side so added a teaspoon or so of sugar.  Otherwise the sauce is superb. I sauté some mushrooms and had turkey meatballs to our pasta meal.

I made this sauce exactly as described in the recipe.   The prosciutto was the most excellent add to the sauce and kept the soft from being too bland. Like many sauces, I would consider this recipe to be an excellent base or starting point. The second time I made it I added onions garlic and red pepper (Pizza peppers) and in my opinion it was even better.

I added fresh garlic, parsley, couple tablespoons of crushed tomatoes and dash of poultry seasoning. I also used gigli pasta I’d gotten at Trader Joe’s and never tried before. It was a big hit with my son & husband. I'll definitely make it again!

I changed up the pancetta and used prosciutto instead. I also add the red pepper flakes when sautéing the prosciutto to awaken them a bit more.  End pieces of prosciutto are fairly decently priced and less pricey than pancetta, and less fatty as well. This recipe change was even better than the original!!!

WOW, this is exceptionally good. It is quick and easy to make. It is also versatile.  After making  as written, I've made it with various substitutions.  I've substituted ready made pasta sauce in a jar for the tomato sauce, and have even added cream  friache when short on whipping cream.  All worked well. However, do use the best pancetta you can afford but don't over-cook it when sautéing.  This  is great the next day too.

My family loves this!!!   I told my kids I was going to make it for dinner.  Their grandmother called and asked if we wanted to come for spaghetti and meatballs.  My kids replied "but, dad, you're making vodka sauce?!?"  Needless to say turning down nana's sauce is a big deal.

This was easy and flavorful. The only change I made was to use Porch Light Sun Dried Tomato Flavored Vodka rather than unflavored vodka. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I had such high hopes for this recipe. However, it wasn't good.  I bought high-end pancetta, made the recipe as-is and it was NOT good at all.  It was salty and had very little flavor.

This is simply delicious!  Have had many compliments?  I do usually skip the butter when cooking the pancetta. 
The only other thing I add is red peppers flakes to add alittle spice to the dish!

I made  a few changes. I used hot italian sausage that i cooked and cut up into the dish and i used a different pasta, my family loved this meal, i unfortunately cooked it and had to go to work. I re-heated it and i didn't enjoy it. I think its one of those meals best eaten immediately.

This was so salty and a waste of time &  money.  I searched two grocery stores until I found pancetta.  I agree with nmwunduke that this tasted like less mushy Chef Boyardee.

I made this for impromptu dinner guests last night. Everyone raved about it. I did make a couple of changes. I added the red pepper flakes, as suggested, but also at the end I added 1/2 c of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a large handful of fresh sweet basil straight from the garden.  A fresh garden salad and crusty garlic bread was served also. And of course a glass of California Cab! Excellent, will do this again.

Incredible!! So flavorful and exactly what I was looking for! I used 2/3 cup vodka. Buy cheap vodka, no need for expensive vodka here. You cook off the alcohol anyways. I also added a half pound of crab meat because we love crab! Everybody loved it! Even my close friend who doesn't care much for "red sauces," even though this one is a pretty pink color. Definitely will make again, for the rest of my life.

I made this exactly as described in the recipe and it is probably one of the best pastas I have ever tasted. The flavours were so bright and really pop out at you. It was also so simple it was bordering on foolproof.

I made this recipe two times.   The first time was excellent but I added too red pepper flakes (advice from another recipe).   This time I made the following changes:
1. Used 3/4 cup vodka infused with 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.   The first time I used a tsp and way too much because I didn't strain out the flakes before adding to sauce.   This time 1/4 tsp didn't add enough kick, so I added two or three pinches to the final sauce and that proved to be just right.
2.  I fried the pancetta with two shallots minced and two cloves of minced garlic.
3.  I added freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup) after sauce had simmered.
4.  I added fresh basil leaves (about five or six leaves) torn into smaller pieces.   This in my opinion adds an immense amount of flavor.
5.  I used plum tomatoes flavored with basil the first time.  This time I used crushed tomatoes and added three small fresh vine tomatoes coarsely chopped.  We like the texture of the sauce with chunky tomatoes.  I simmer my sauce longer (about 30 - 45 minutes) to get full flavor.

super easy recipe with great results. Everyone loved it! I only had half and half on hand and it still turned out great. Only addition was a large chopped shallot that I added to the browning pancetta. Will certainly make again.

I make this recipe often.  When I am a having large group for dinner this recipe is included on my Italian buffet.  The only change that I make is that I double the pancetta since the added flavor enhances this dish.

Followed the recipe pretty much. My husband had 3 helpings. Added onions and garlic I think it needed the extra pop. At the end I stirred in  some cooked chicken. Very easy with a lot of flavors

My first attempt at penne a la vodka and this recipe was really good.  I agree with other reviewers to buy quality ingredients especially the pancetta and cheese

The only change I made was to swap bacon for the pancetta because that is what I had on hand. I feel it made no difference. I did add a dash of chili pepper because I wanted to remove the sweetness. Oh, I almost forgot, I added a dash of Thyme and Oregano. My family loved it.

This was delicious. It was a nice change from the same old regular tomato sauce. Although I have a recipe that is delicious, just sometimes nice to change it up. Very good.

This recipe was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly (minus the pancetta) and it turned out great. The only thing I added was some sauteed chicken.Tasty recipe, and my whole family loved it. Luckily, it was an easy-to-follow recipe, and I'm a first time cook. So there was no way I could screw it up!

AMAZING! Super easy and the perfect way to use my leftover sauce. My boyfriend said it was Resturant worthy!!! Instead of heavy cream I used half and half like another reviewer suggested. Also instead of pancetta I used Portuguese chouriço since I had it in the house. Since it is a smokey meat it gave it a little twist but we LOVED it. I also added a pinch or two of parsley and crushed red pepper. Will def be making again.

I just made this and it's delicious!  I followed others advice and used half and half instead of the heavy cream.  When the pancetta was almost cooked, I added garlic.  I also added red pepper flakes to the sauce.

Instead of bacon I used sausage as the meat. Pretty tasty. I don't like chunky sauces so that's why I wanted to try this recipe. At first, the sauce tastes like really creamy tomato soup, which I didn't like. Then by the time the sauce simmered, the taste changed to more vodka sauce.  I have had it for leftovers twice now and I think it's even better reheated than fresh. I also used Romano on top instead of Parmesan. Not the very best of the best, but pretty good for it being so simple and easy to make, especially for those who don't like a bunch of stuff in their sauce.

I did not shop for this. I did not have pancetta or even bacon to substitute I just made it meatless. I had no tomato sauce but did have part of a can of tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes. So I improvised. I also added some fresh basil I had in a pot. All other ingredients went in it as per recipe. We had a "Bloody Mary" marinated Flank Steak with this as a side so we really didn't miss the meat in the dish. With a salad it was a  perfect meal! It was great! We will try again sticking to the recipe, and probably use the low or fat free half and half. I just happened to have a carton of cream not used from Thanksgiving so went with that.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe, and it has unfortunately, ruined me for any other restaurant vodka sauce as none of them are good enough.  I have made this recipe countless of times for family and guests but always with the same disclaimer that they are not allowed to watch me make this as it's just not very healthy.  I've used 5-6 slices of chopped hickory smoked bacon in this recipe  in lieu of pancetta, and it tastes great.  I've found that the type of Vodka that you use really affects the taste.  You don't need to use expensive vodka to make it taste good.  (I use Vikingfjord and it tastes good to me.)  Unfortunately, I think heavy cream is the key to this recipe as I've tried to gone the healthy route and use regular cream and half and half - and it just doesn't taste as rich.

LOVE this recipe.  Just don't make it all the time, unless you work out a lot. :)

I have made this recipe twice.  Once was as written and the second time with a few modifications.  It is good but slightly bland as written.  

First, it needs to be doubled.  I like to be generous with sauce and I like leftovers.  Next, add a little garlic.  And last, I used tomato sauce with italian seasoning or you can add your own to the sauce.  Don't add salt because it does not need it.  If you have enough for leftovers, it will be even better the next day.

Delicious! I did make a few adjustments though: 3 cloves of diced garlic cooked with the pancetta,  and 1/2 cup of vodka, just a tad more heavy cream and crushed hot peppers to the sauce to taste.

Amazing! This is an awesome recipe.
I used the half and half cream and it turned out great.
I also made sure I went and found pancetta bacon and used it. I used a PC (Presidents Choice - Loblaws in Canada) brand fire roasted red pepper tomato sauce.

I like to make this for celebrations  especially because  it comes together so fast. you can double this recipe if needed
 I used fat free half and half. We all like lots of parmesan on top. I prefer to use 3/4 of a box of pasta for the amount of sauce this recipe makes. And I use the penne with lines on them because they grip the sauce better than a smooth pasta. Be generous with salting your water. i have made on 4 separate occasions so far and recipe is consistent. Thank you!

I didn't like this dish at all. Probably the fact that I used fettuccini instead of penna may have had something to do with it.

So good and so easy!! Added crushed garlic to butter and made 1-1/2 times the sauce. Also used half n half in place of heavy cream and spaghetti sauce in place of plain tomato sauce.

Had very little/mild flavor. Next time I will use a basic marinara sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce.  Also, the pancetta was very fatty and EXPENSIVE! Maybe will try a bacon with mild flavor.  I'll let you know my alternative version.

I am not a big pasta eater but I loved this recipe and will have it again soon...I doubled the Pancetta (but 1/4 lbs would be enough)
I used a whole can of tomato sauce (15 oz.) so then used 2/3 cup of cream. This was the first time making it as a side to Flat Iron Steak and fresh green beans...So easy and so good! I guess I have to look and try some other recipes for comparison.

The flavours of tomato and pancetta ( I added lots of fresh Basil from my garden ) melded well together, but just found it was way too salty......maybe cut the amount of pancetta in half next time.....otherwise, it was very tasty for sure.

It was a simple but amazingly delicious recioe. I added shrimp, capers because we don't eat pork  & Sriracha for some heat.  This was a winner! Thanks Rick!

So I am just starting to cook more often at home. I made this dish and my family loved it!  It was very easy and delicious. It had a very good balance between flavors. I used ground beef instead of  pancetta and half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. I will definitely make this dish again!

I never made Penne alla vodka at home - because my family loves it so much and I never thought I could make it as good as our local Italian restaurant I add cooked diced prosciutto cotto (Italian cooked ham - that you can buy at the deli counter).  Yum!   This has turned into a regular twice a month family meal.  Also great for lunch --- before a hockey game of course!

This is a great recipe! I added a clove of minced garlic but that's about it. In my opinion, the pancetta is SO important to vodka sauce. Don't skip out on it! I've made this a few times and it works with either penne or rigatoni.. but there is still something missing for me. I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce so it's probably a little seasoning. I will keep tweaking! Thank you for the recipe!

I tried all different penne vodka recipes and this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. The pancetta adds a certain flavor without making it over powering. I also used unsalted butter vs salted because pancetta is already salty to begin with. I also added a bit more cream and cheese to my liking. Very simple and easy to make

This was very tasty!  I used bacon instead of pancetta (I cooked the bacon, drained the fat, blotted the bacon, and then added butter to the pan to make the sauce). My picky son who doesn't usually eat tomato-based sauces had three servings.

This was a huge hit. Absolutely amazing. However, I choose to use fat free half and half instead of the whipping cream and another users suggestion of fresh minced garlic and a pinch of onion powder and salt. I also doubled the ingredients to feed a larger group. I  used rigatoni instead of penne and cooked it in chicken broth to make it nice and tender.

This is an excellent base recipe!  I took advice in other reviews and added sautéed onion garlic and mushrooms. I also sautéed shrimp and used fresh grated Parmesan!    I'll definitely make this again. And by the way. No need to use gray goose vodka. Triple olives worked fine and I'd bet Smirnoff would too!

Thought it needed more flavor, didn't care for the panchetta bacon.

I agree with the reviewer who likened it to chef boy-r-dee.  Edible but was thick and bland.  Also, there was not enough pancetta for the flavor to be really present.  All in all it was okay.

This recipe is great and super quick. I did omit the vodka the second time I made because I didn't taste the difference. I used fat-free half/half instead of whipping cream and goya tomato sauce. It always comes out tasting great!

This is delicious.  I forgot to buy whipping cream, so I substituted Dean's sour cream instead and it is delicious.  I also sauteed some ground pork sausage with the pancetta.  This is a great sauce.

This recipe is a great starter! I added shallots and 2 cloves of fresh garlic until fragrant just before adding the vodka, as well as a bit of chopped fresh basil and oregano for last 10 mins. Fresh ground pepper and a bit of red pepper flake (as always), and I stirred in most of the parmesan in the last 5 minutes, saving a bit to sprinkle on top along with fresh garlic chives. Served with grilled chicken breast.
Practically licked the plate.

I love, love, love this receipe!  I'd had something similar at a conference, and was thrilled to try it myself.  Now, my kids beg for it.  And, it's super easy to make.  

One change: I add grilled chicken breast & substitute regular bacon for the pancetta.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

Like you are supposed to, I made this recipe EXACTLY as written in order to rate it. It was fantastic! My husband, who said he has "olive oil running through his italian veins" thought it was wicked good. It is so going to be our go-to vodka sauce recipe!

Made this dish last night and OH-MY-GAWD ... it was delicious! And embarrassingly EASY to prepare! Upon reading reviews from others, I did add chicken, mushrooms, onions, garlic, rosemary and pepper flakes. Hubby was quick to say this recipe is a "do over". You must try it!!!!!!

As written, this recipe was a bit bland.  If you add a dash of spices such as rosemary, oregano, basil, garlic powder & red pepper flakes it makes it a five star recipe!!  Next time we will try lump crab meat or shrimp.

Flavor was good, though this dish could use more sauce . I will double the liquids next time, though I will make it again. The pancetta gives a nice flavor, not sure regular bacon would have been as good.

I never write reviews but when it comes to this dish, I must.  We are very Italian and can't believe how authentic and delicious this dish tastes!  Quick, easy, fabulous.  When sautéing the pancetta, make sure you drain off the fat before adding the other ingredients.  Next time I will add asparagas for color and dimension.  My husband added red pepper to his.  This is a keeper!

My husband could not get enough!  I made it twice in one week.  The next time I make it, I plan to change things up a bit and substitute cut up chicken breast for the pancetta (or maybe I will use both).

This recipe was amazing...thank you previous reviewers for their input. They were right when they said to buy the Panchetta. I found it at the deli section of my local supermarket. I also subsituted the heavy cream with fat-free half and half. I invited my neighbors over for dinner and they loved it. I am going to make it again this weekend for the rest of my family.

The code is cracked. I've always wanted to make it and it came out really good, I added grilled chicken but left out the Parmesan cheese too. The store gave me a cheap vodka(why waste $)and might have helped out more than the top shelf stuff.. I even used Prague sauce. I'd like it to be a thinner sauce, but it still tasted great. Simple

Delicious and easy. I did add a dash of salt and some red pepper flakes. But very yummy.

Very tasty. I used only 8oz of penne with the full sauce recipe. My husband really liked it. Next time I will try adding cooked chicken to it!

This was the BEST penne and vodka sauce I have ever tried or prepared.  I used low fat half and half and the results were spectacular.  I also added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes and it made a huge, flavorful difference.  I prepared this dish and two of us finished it off.  Will double it up next time so there will be leftovers!!  Great with garlic bread.  This is a keeper!!

This is an amazing dish and so easy.  I also used half whipping cream and half 2% and added some sun dried tomatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!

I used red pepper penne noodles for an extra kick. Since I had zucchini on hand, I diced some small, with onion, and pan fried them before adding the sauce and cream.

This recipe was very tasty.  My family loved it.  The only caution is when you add the vodka, add it carefully.  I wasn't paying close attention, threw it in the pan, and had a wall of flames up to my ceiling.  Luckily, the house didn't catch on fire.  After the excitement we enjoyed our meal.

I added chopped onion, and to use up what was in the fridge, used prosciutto; maple bacon; and a little chopped, smoked chicken. The maple bacon added a sweetness that was absolutely to die for! I used 10% half & half instead of heavy cream, which made the sauce just nicely light but still creamy.  I would definitely make it this way again.

I tried this recipe with a few adjustments and my husband and I absolutely LOVE it!!! I used approximately 1 lb of chicken breats, cut into strips, that I season with garlic salt and black pepper to taste. I also use Prego Heart Healthy Mushroom sauce in lieu of plain tomato sauce (the herbs and seasonings make a huge difference!). Finally, I add my cheese to the sauce and allow it to melt and mix before adding the penne. This is one of my husband's favorite meals that he requests at least once a month :D

Our daughter really wanted a Vodka sauce since she enjoys it at one of our favourite restaurants.  This is even better and now it's everyone's favourite.  Have done and will do it again and again.

SO good. We will make this again. I wanted to try something similar to a dish I had in an Itailian restaurant a few weeks ago and its almost the same. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick.

Don't underrate a recipe if you change all the ingredients the poster gives you. Thats just not fair! Substitute bacon for pancetta? There is NO substitution for the taste. Be careful of adding much extra because the pancetta is pretty salty. My local grocery carries the pancetta and the local grocers are much more willing to order you something they don't usually carry over the big chain grocers. Excellent recipe. Thanks!

I wish I could give it more stars, it's that good!  I added a two cloves of garlic and used a garlic & herb tomato sauce.  I had to use bow tie pasta because I spilled the penne all down the front of me!

5 Stars!  We absolutely devoured this delicious pasta dish!  Follow the recipes exactly as written and you will be amazed.  Definitely use pancetta - it's worth the money.  I would say it makes more like 6 - 7 servings than 4, but we are thrilled to have leftovers.  Definitely a winner!

Delicious delicious delicious.  I didn't have any bacon or pancetta available so I just omitted it - made no difference, I'm sure.  I also added shrimp when I added the sauce.  Perfect amount of time for it to cook.  So good.  I went back for seconds!

I thought this turned out pretty good. I used half and half in place of the cream and I used regular bacon in place of the pancetta. I could not find it in my grocery store. It worked out fine though because it still tasted good. I will definitely make this again.

Great!  Though I doubled it, and should have used less pasta (meaning- more sauce.)  Followed to a "T" and got lots of compliments!

Excellent recipe!  I substituted hot italian turkey sausage for the pancetta after finding out that whole foods was out of pancetta.  it still worked out great.  the recipe is supposed to make four servings but it's really more like 6 unless you want ginormous servings.  definitely add some crushed red pepper!

I made this recently for a party and have to say that the pancetta made it taste like something from a restaurant.  I added at the end though a box of thawed frozen baby peas and not only did it give the dish great color but it tasted great too.  We didn't skimp on the cheese too and it was yummy!

I make this all the time.  It is just delicious.  Very closely mimics a vodka sauce at a local Italian restaurant.  I have used a small amount of bacon in place of the pancetta in pinch and it worked well.

My husband supposedly hates vodka sauce. Funny how he just ate his entire plate of this and wants me to be sure to print this recipe so we can have it again. Our 8 and 6 year old children ate seconds as well. Outstanding!

BETTER THAN ANY RESTAURANT! I doubled the sauce recipe after reading that advice in other reviews.  I'm glad I did.  I think the recipe as written would not make enough sauce for a whole pound of pasta.  Plus, the sauce tastes so good, you'll want plenty of it to dip your bread in. The sauce turned out great!  I added the following while I was browning the pancetta: 1/2 a large onion (chopped), 1 package sliced mushrooms, 1 can of peas (drained), 4 large cloves of garlic (minced), 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  These additions just make the meal more substantial.

Very easy and quick to make, plus it was really tasty. I doubled the pancetta - not because it needed it, but because of preferance.  I used Dececco's jarred sauce.  Reheated well in the microwave the next day.  UPDATE: Tried again w/half & half per other reviews with dismal results. Will not make that mistake again.

Just a wonderful dish.My son is a chef and he thought it was great. My family is Italian and hard to please when it comes to Italian cooking everyone loved it.I did add 2 nice sized cloves of garlic and red pepper to taste and did not change a thing in the ingredients.

I enjoyed this recipe. Like others, though, I thought there was no need for heavy cream. Half and half works just as well. I added onion and garlic to the pancetta for extra flavor. Even the kids love this one!

I am definitely a fan. Paired with salad and warm rolls it was way better then going out to eat. I also like that there are few ingredients making it a very affordable dish. I scaled the recipe down for two and added extra garlic and sausage. Also I topped with fresh grated parmesan. Perfecto!!

Excellent recipe!  I've made this one a couple of times, following the directions exactly, and also making modifications.  I've been trying it with lighter and lighter creams each time I make it.  My latest version used homo milk (3.25%), and the family still loved it!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because my family is torn.  My kids wouldn't eat it, but my husband and I enjoyed it.  As is, it is a bit bland so we had to add crushed red pepper for some zing.  But unfortunately, I probably won't make it again as my kids just wouldn't eat it at all.  Thanks for sharing, though!

This is my go-to Vodka Sauce recipe. I've tried a few others and they simply don't compare. The pancetta really makes all the difference, so don't skimp. After following the recipe to the T, the first time, I tried to substitute normal bacon on the second go. It simply doesn't compare. Pancetta may be a bit pricey, but it's worth every single penny. I'd also double the vodka. The alcohol content cooks out, leaving a rich flavor behind.

I made this recipe with fat free half and half.  And added a little crushed red pepper and thyme (from other's suggestions).  DON'T ADD THYME.  Wrong flavor for the sauce.  Sans thyme, it's delicious.  And a little healthier with the half and half vs the heavy cream.

I used Prosciutto instead of the Pancetta and I found this recipe too salty, but that may be because of my choice of meat.  Nonetheless, this recipe is too fat for our tastes.

We loved this dish.  We followed the recipe pretty close and actually thought the sauce was just the right amount.  Instead of using tomato sauce, we used the directed amount, but of roasted garlic pasta sauce (was in a hurry - didn't read), and it was great.  The only thing we would do differently is chop up the panchetta before browning.  Thanks!!

Very tasty.  I did have to sub bacon for the pancetta becuase neither of our grocery stores had it.  I thought it was a little dry, even though I added at little extra butter, tomato sauce and cream to the sauce. Would probably double next time.  Also added some red pepper flakes as other suggested and sauted the bacon with a clove of crushed garlic.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, but before serving I tasted it and it was a bit sour tasting from the tomato sauce, so I added a tsp of sugar.  Much better, but still a bit bland, so I added a tsp of minced garlic and a few shakes of red pepper flakes and simmered it a few minutes to blend the flavors and it was perfect!

This recipe was very good! My 6 year old loved it!  I followed the recipe except I omitted the pancetta and added blackened shrimp!  I also add some red pepper flakes, parsley, minced garlic and a pinch of black pepper.  With all these additions it came out fantastic!

It was very good!  I change it:  I didn't add the bacon, I used evaporated Fat-free milk and I sauted in the butter 3 gloves of Garlic which I pressed in a garlic press.

Very good.  Had a very "basic" flavor despite the "gourmet" type ingredients. The whole family liked it.

This recipe is so fantastic it deserves 10 stars. It was absolutely delicious, and a big hit with my family. I definitely think this is restaurant quality. The only thing I added was some shrimp I had on hand. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us Rick.

I made this tonight with tortellini rather than penne, but the sauce was amazing.  It reminded me of the kind that one of my favorite restaurants serves.  I skipped pancetta bacon and instead added garlic and onions to the butter and it was great.

It was okay - better than any store bought sauce.  I've had much better at several different restaurants.  Again, better than store bought and very, very easy to make.

This was really quite good; my husband was so impressed!  I did make a couple changes, especially in that I did 1.5x for each ingredient and it was just enough sauce, and I added some red pepper flakes.  I also used bacon bites and it was still perfect!

EXCELLENT!!! My 3 year old loved it so much he had almost cleaned his plate by the time I sat down! I doubled the sauce and was very happy I did because it would not have been enough. I also threw in a bit of parsley at the end. Will definitely make this again!

This was the first recipe I found on this website two years ago, and it was the entire reason I continue to go to this website.  PHENOMENAL dish.  I eat penne vodka at every Italian restaurant I go to, and this is a masterpiece.  A little garlic added will make this dish rival any expensive restaurant in the country!

I made it for a family gathering and I got nothing only compliments my husband absolutely loved it and it was so easy. I added a couple of cloves of garlic and onion like others suggested and it turned out great. I will be making this again in the future, thanks for such a delicious and easy recipe.

This was so good! I 1 and a 1/2'd the recipe, used 18% cream instead of heavy cream and sauted onion and garlic with the pancetta. Everyone loved it, it was very rich, I couldnt imagine how it would have been with the full cream. Tasty Im guessing but I thought it was going to be fattening enough! Next time Im going to use half and half (10%)and see how that is. I also added chili flakes and prawns and used Ragu original like someone here suggested because I imagined plain tomato sauce to be bland. I guess I changed a fair bit but it still gets 5 stars.

I am giving it a 5 plus based on my guy's reaction.  He just loved, loved it.  I was only cooking for two but made enough for 4 and he was sooo happy.  I did not have pancetta and the bacon worked out fine (will use pancetta the next time).  I did add a bit of onion and garlic when cooking the bacon as others suggested.  I also added just a bit more cream since I personally felt the tomato sauce was overpowering without the addition of more cream.  This is a keeper!

Thank you thank you thank you!  This was better than I imagined.  I didn't have the exact ingredients so improvised.  After browning 14 oz. chopped prosciutto (which I drained) since it was what I had on hand, I added and sauteed about 1/2 diced red onion and about 2 cloves of garlic. I used 1 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and 2 diced roma tomates. Based on other reviews, I decided to increase the amount of sauce and added 1 c. cream and 1 c. milk.  I simmered this with 1 tsp. black pepper and 1 tsp. crushed red pepper.  This sauce, along with the suggested 16 oz. of penne, made about 8 servings...unfortunately, we each ate closer to 2 servings each!  I will probably reduce the prosciutto (or hopefully I will have pancetta on hand) by 1/2 as well as omit the cheese as it was a bit salty for our taste. I'll save this one for an "indulgence meal" as it is so rich...but, man, was it good!  Thanks Rick!

I thought this was excellent.  My husband thought it was ok.(He ate the leftovers)  I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used evaporated milk and it worked just fine.  I also added fresh basil.  I will be making again when my husband isn't home for dinner!

This recipe is simple and very tasty.  Perfect blend of flavors.  I use Grey Goose vodka for its smoothness and Rao's Arrabiatta sauce for a little extra kick.

Hey Rick, I'm Linda McLean, however, my bff, Karen got this recipe off this site because I talk about it constantly! Until tonight, she was not a member but after tasting this incredible dish, I decided, with her permission, to sign her up and to review the recipe for her. At our Mom's Day Party, this was served as one of our sides and I must say that although that I'm not a big pasta person, this was incredible!!!! We all loved it and we thank you so much for your submission!!

This is a favorite at our house.  Very simple to make.  I prefer the pancetta but have substituted sausage in a pinch.

This sauce was fantastic.  The only issues I had was with 1) the amount of pasta the recipe called for.  The sauce was enough for 4 servings, but I thought it was way too much pasta for 4 people.  We finished the sauce and still had half of the cooked pasta left.  Plus, if you read the pasta box, each serving is 2 ounces, which calls for 8 ounces for 4 people, which is about right.  Next time I'll just make half the box. 2) The fat on the pancetta grossed me out a little. Luckily I had chicken that I was planning on eating it with anyway.

Very good! I used prociutto, and light soy cream. If anything the sauce was a little runny, but you could add tomato paste if you prefer a thicker sauce. Delicious though!

This receipce was excellent and easy. The pancetta is a must. Definetly a crowd pleaser. I strongly suggest you try this receipe.

This is a wonderfully simple recipe and a favorite at my house. Have tried making it with other, more complicated, recipes but it's just not as good. Use your favorite red sauce and you'll be happy. I make the sauce with light cream and depending on who's eating add a little or a lot of red pepper. With spicy turkey sausage or sliced chicken it's wonderful!

A fantastic dish! YUM! Just as good as in the restaurant...costs about the same but your "start-up" ingredients can go towards anything else.  It almost tastes like a creamy tomato soup...Delicious!

I am a huge fan of Penne Vodka but never thought I would be able to replicate the recipe of the one served in my favorite restaurants until I tried this recipe!  Not only was it super easy to make, but it was FANTASTIC and it is now one of my new favorite recipes!!!  I will definitely be making this very often!

Great sauce! I added some parmesan a bit earlier, and also I cook my pasta a few minutes short of al dente and then add them to the sauce for a few minutes to finish cooking. It makes the sauce stick a bit better. I've also added spicy italian sausage, removed from the casings and cooked ahead of time which is also very tasty. It seems like this recipe is pretty fool proof- you can ad the vodka in the beginning or at the end and both taste the same i felt like, or you could cook longer if you want so the flavors marry a bit more.

I was looking for an easy, inexpensive pasta dish to serve on a buffet at a large gathering (instead of baked ziti) and I tried this.  What a find!  I've used it three times already and the party isn't for two more weeks.  The pancetta makes it special!  A definite keeper and an allrecipes.com greatest hit!

Very tasty!  Many vodka sauce recipes end up bland without tasting much different than a straight tomatoe sauce.  The combination of bacon drippings & vodka sauce was just the right touch to give it a snap.  I will definitely put this recipe in my permanent collection.

This was fantastic!  There were so few ingredients, that I thought it would be mediocre at best, but it was delicious.  I had to use regular bacon, because it's what I had on hand, but other than that, didn't change anything.  The whole family loved it.

Mmmm - yummy.  Added onions and garlic when frying pancetta as others had suggested.  Also added shrimp in the last few minutes of simmering as recipe submitter suggested.  It was delicous.  Served it at a family dinner party and everyone went back for seconds.

Excellent!  I added a little bit of chopped onion to the pancetta while sauteing and also added some crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I used homemade tomato sauce instead of jared or canned.  I think it would probably taste a little different depending on the type of tomato sauce used, but even with that variation, I think it would still be great!  I enjoyed it very much.  In fact, I took a break from eating it to leave this review!  :) I will definately keep this recipe in my recipe box for future use.  Thanks Rick!

This was an easy and convient recipe to follow and use. But, if you like to have your sauce a bit more spicy instead of using the pancetta bacon, i used hot sausage from an Italian butcher shop. Added more red pepper flakes and it was great. The more vodka you use with this receipe along with the extra seasoning that i put into the sauce including the hot sausage, bought out a great combination to an already great recipe. thank you very much.

Fantastic Recipe!  I did add a small onion and 1 clove of garlic when browning the pancetta.  The only thing I would mention is I like to have sauce leftover to add to the pasta and I found this didn't make enough sauce for me.  I would either use a 1/2 lb of pasta for this recipe or double the recipe next time.  Thanks for sharing Rick!

Made this twice already and we all think it is excellent! I did add a clove of garlic with pancetta and some sugar to the tomato sauce to tone down ph. Added shrimp this time as suggested and loved it even more!

I thought this was very good, but very rich.  I added a clove of garlic to the pancetta as it was browning and threw some parmesan cheese in at the end.  I think the cheese put it over the top on the richness scale.  I will probably make again, but use light cream and less or no cheese.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I have tried other versions here and this the best and the simplest!  Do not substitute the pancetta if possible.  I have never used pancetta before but it was wonderful and really did make it unique.  I made this twice, once with a tangier sauce which I didn't like as well.  The second time I picked a mild Ragu and loved it since it didn't mask the wonderful taste of pancetta. I like a kick and so I added crushed red pepper in the end along with some shrimp.  So good...cannot rave enough!

I made this dish using regular bacon because I didn't have time to get the pancetta, and it was still delicious.

Really really good.  I had a hard time dealing with all the fat in the pancetta but I served this dish to a dinner party I gave lastnight and it received rave reviews!

This is such a simple and delicious recipe. I can see making this for company as well. The pancetta really makes it. I used about 3/4 lb. of the penne, and it was the perfect amount for  the three of us. A keeper!

This is a great recipe!  The pancetta gives this sauce an amazing taste.  This is a true "restaurant" quality recipe.  If you are having guests over and want a great pasta dish, make this!!  Thanks Rick.

Recipe was excellent.  I experimented with diced tomatoes, regular bacon (omitting the butter) and used fat free half and half.  Everyone loved it. Thankyou.
