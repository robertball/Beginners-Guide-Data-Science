Absolutely delicious!  However, found that I had more egg&corn syrup mixture than the pie shell could hold.  Next time, I would only use 3/4 of the cream cheese mixture so I could get more of the other in.  Also, it doesn't specify (and for those of you like me who may want everything spelled out), do not bake the pie crust first - use an uncooked crust.  One more thing, serve cold - the day after baking is GREAT!!!  WE ALL LOVED IT.

The first time I made this I was a little skeptical.  I love pecan pie and wasn't sure how it would turn it.  When I started mixing the cream cheese and other ingredients it was really think.  I've never seen cream cheese be used with out any eggs.  I had also used dark corn syrup rather than light, but it actually turned out pretty good.  A little bit of FYI: the cream cheese comes up to the top so don't be surprised if your pie looks a little puffy.  Also don't put too much syrup into it 'cause it'll overflow and cause a big mess.

I hate to give such a low rating, and I realize I'm in the minority here, but I disliked this pie. I mean, I tried a slice warm and it was not good, so I put it in the fridge overnight thinking maybe it would be better cold. Nope There was no sweetness- I mean none.  I was expecting a cheesecake type layer topped with pecans and a custard, but the cream cheese rose to the top and mixed with everything else, and didn't taste anything like a cheesecake.  Also, the edges of my crust burnt, but the bottom stayed soggy- probably due to the cream cheese/custard glob.  Real pecan pie and real cheesecake are 10x better.

I've made this about 6 times and this recipe is perfect the way it is as long as you follow the directions! It isn't supposed to be like traditional pecan pie. I used a mrs smith's deep dish frozen pie crust and it filled perfectly to the drop! You need to fill the shell to the VERY TOP since it doesn't rise.  I actually set it on the oven rack before pouring in the top layer so I can fill it up and not spill any by having to move it.  As long as you use a real deep dish crust you shouldn't have any leftover. 
The only thing  that I had to change was the bake time - it takes almost an hour just don't take it out before it is set! It should be brown and crispy on the top.

This was Perfect. I made this for christmas as a spur of the moment dessert. I am very glad I did. The bottom crust didnt cook as well as I would have liked, But that was my fault.
the cooking time might be a little off, I think it needs to cook a little longer.
I suggest you use a glass pie pan & pie crust sheets. That way you can judge when your bottom crust is browned.
THIS IS A EXCELLENT RECIPE ,I WILL MAKE A FAMILY TRADITION!!!! tip* MAKE MORE THAN ONE.........LOL

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. Wonderful change from the usual pecan pie. You must make this in a deep dish pie plate, because there is a lot of filling. I also didn't follow the recipe exactly. I like how the pecan halves llok, so I did not chop them, also I poured them into the corn syrup mixture and stirred them up before pouring onto the cream cheese layer. From the top, looked like a regular pecan pie, but with a delightful surprise on the bottom. My family voted and wants me to only make this pecan pie from now on. Not as sweet as the traditional, but defintely good and rich. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really hate to give this such a low rating-- maybe it was me... but...
I agree with user BN61079... this pie did not turn out for me. The edges burnt, the cream cheese stuff didn't look like cheesecake at all, and we couldn't even get it out of the pie dish. I was so disgusted with how the pie turned out, I didn't even taste it. My husband tried it and said it was good, but he eats literally anything. I won't make this one again!

I'm new to baking so i didnt know the tricks to keep from overdoing the crust when making custard pies, but it still turned out pretty good :)  Can't wait to try again now that i know to move to a higher rack and put aluminum foil on the crust.

My sister usually doesn't like pecan pie, but she loved this one.  Mom said this is the best pecan pie she's ever had because it is sooo creamy.

This recipe is a great example that sometimes different is good.  The flavor is a creamy twist on an old classic and once I wrapped my mind around that idea, found that I really enjoyed the dessert.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of white in the cream cheese mixture.  I used a store bought deep dish pie crust & like other users ended up having an overflow.  The only other observation I made was that it took closer to an hour for my pie to bake.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome pecan pie recipe!!

It was "ok". I made this for Thanksgiving hoping for a new twist on Pecan Pie. No one went for seconds and it was the last leftover in the fridge a few days later. It was ok but just nothing special or intersting about the taste - almost (not quite but almost) bland. I suggest if you want pecan pie, make Pecan Pie!

Yumm! I made this pie and let it sit overnight. It is sooo good! Not too sweet, the cream cheese really compliments the pecans and custard. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving dinner!

I though this was going to be so good, but it was not at all what I thought it was going to be like. I love cheese cake and love pecan pie, but not this. The cheese cake mixed altogether with the pie mixture. It was not good cold or hot. Maybe it was just the cook cause it sounds like most everbody else loved it. I may try it again just to make sure it wasnt me.

Wow! This was fantastic! I made it a few nights ago. The only thing I added was about 1/2 cup minature chocolate chips to the pecan mixture. Next time I would add even more as this is not your average pecan pie in that...it is not too sweet. I will be making this one...again and again. Thank you Carol!

Rave reviews on this one at my family gathering.  The pie shell will be VERY full and I didn't use all of the syrup mixture.  It will be very puffy when it bakes and I put a cookie sheet under it when I baked it just in case it overflowed.  This will be a staple in my recipe box!

I made this without the pie crust.  I used the crushed peacans as the crust.  It turned out great.  Mistakes can be good.

A step above the normal pecan pie.  The cream cheese adds something special and takes away some of the sweetness of a traditional pecan pie.

This pie is absolutely SINFUL!  It was so good that we've decided to replace our normal pecan pie recipe for the holidays.  My family loved it!  I can't say enough good things about it.  It was so rich and gooey.  It is melt-in-your-mouth wonderful!

Fabulous 10++!  I reduce the sugars as follows:

1/4 cup instead of 1/3 cup with the cream cheese mixture

1/8 cup instead of 1/4 cup with the pecan  mixture

3/4 cup light corn syrup instead of 1 cup with the pecan mixture

I also make my own evaporated milk substitute:

1/2 cup milk (non-fat is fine)
1/4 cup instant milk

This save the hastle/cost of buying cans of evaporated milk.

This pie is D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!!  I made this last year for Thanksgiving and everyone demanded that I make my "special pie" this year too. Not only is it yummy...but incredibly easy to make (take it from someone with ZERO patience when it comes to baking). You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Very good pie! You have to like cream cheese. I used a deep dish pie crust according to the recipe but it was a little too much mix for pie shell!

I really liked this recipe, I tried it for my wife, and she was crazy about it.  Now I suppose I can wow my friends with it.

I am not a fan of pecans but my friends really loved the pie. I tasted a bit and it was very good, moist and flavorful, pecan amount is up to pie eaters really.

This was easy enough to prepare but it just didn't have a distinct flavor. I think next time I'm going to add mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I did like that it isn't too sweet!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  It came out nice and creamy and custard-like.  It was a nice change from regular pecan pie.

I've never liked pecan pie but this was awesome!  The cream cheese makes all the difference.  The family raved!
Next time I will double the cream cheese.

This pie was a big hit at my Thanksgiving feast.  My kids don't like anything with nuts in it, so they didn't really like it, but all of the adults LOVED it.

I have been making this pie for five years and it never gets old!!! The best thing for a cold fall day. You do end up with more liquid mixture, so I always make less then advised. This pie is good warm or cold, but it's also very rich, so I cut the slices small!

made this for Thanksgiving. it was super great! i have never been a big fan of pecan pie but this worked for my family. i think it was a combo of the chopped pecans and cheam cheese. definatly had to cook alittle longer.

Actually I would like to give it a 4.5 rating but that was not an option. Very easy to make. A bit sweet for my taste, but good none the less. It has a very nice appearance.

This was good.  It did over-fill my pie crust when I poured in the ingredients, so liquids need to be cut back a bit OR pinch edges of crust higher to make pie deeper.

The recipe was easy to follow.  However found that there was about 3/4c of the custard mixture leftover that would not fit in the pan.  and would suggest using more pecans.  Also, had to add on another 5-10 minutes to have it thoroughly set in the middle.  But, otherwise, it tastes great!

This pie turned out delicious!  It surprised everyone with the cheesecake part-they were skeptical till they tried it.  This pie was consumed in record speed!  Great recipe Carol! Very unique!
