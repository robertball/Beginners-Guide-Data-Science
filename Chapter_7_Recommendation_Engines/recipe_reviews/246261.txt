easy to make. I mashed the bananas and wet ingredients in a Ziploc bag, then added the dry mixture and mashed some more. I cut a corner tip off the bag and piped the batter into the oil. no mess, no clean up. my kids loved them. I also wish I'd cut the recipe in half. I'm up to 25 bigger than donut hole donuts and still going.

Very nice when you have overly ripe bananas.  This recipe is meant to be tweaked according to tastebuds and quantity.  I made it once before and had quite a bit to work with, so this time I was ready!  I eliminated the added salt, reduced the amt of baking soda by half and sugar to less than 1/2 cup  (way too much especially if using confectioner's sugar at the end) and used only 1 1/4 cups of flour.  I also added a touch of banana extract.  They were delicious mini beignets.  A great treat for either brunch or snack.

A delectable banana treat. The cinnamon and powdered sugar added a lot to this recipe. The recipe is quick and easy and the Banana Balls disappeared quickly!

Amaze balls! That should be what theyâ€™re called... so good. They were an absolute hit with my kids and grandparents too!  Even after stored overnight they are good, they lose the crunch of the frying and taste more like banana bread, still good, but amazing when eaten fresh and hot!

Haven't tried making it,  but I'd like to try the recipe, and make it healthier, with coconut flour and tapioca flour for flour, stevia to sweeten, and fry in coconut oil. I'll get back.

These are DELICIOUS!! I added chocolate chips to half the batch as another reviewer had done.  Wouldn't do that again as these were much better without the chips.  Thanks!

This were devoured by my guests.  I cooked in coconut oil.  Make sure the oil is deep enough that the dough does not touch the bottom of the pan.  If the oil gets too hot ... they will burn,  I let it cool a bit every few batches.  I added chocolate chips and peanut butter chips to some and they were even better . To make them pretty , dust with powdered sugar once when hot and then again when completely cool.

This recipe was amazing!  

I had too-ripe bananas and no eggs. I knew I wanted to make something banana bread related. I used the allrecipes search to find this recipe and I am so happy I did. 

I used more banana than suggested so I added a little extra flour. It was still so good. I fried in canola oil because it was the only oil I had enough of on hand. I also placed them directly on a drying rack rather than a plate with paper towels. I skipped the powdered sugar topping but did eat a few with whipped cream.

I will second the fact that this makes A LOT. However, I kept them on my counter for a day or two and they kept pretty well and  were quickly gone.

This is a common snack in India. Instead of white sugar, jaggery is used. I had some on hand so I grated about 3 tbsp into the banana mixture. I had 2 bowls - one for all the dry ingredients ( used only 2 tbsp caster sugar instead of white) and added a pinch of cardomom powder too. The other bowl had the smashed bananas and vanilla (this is great to use up any bananas you have in the freezer too!). Combine both and using an oiled spoon (helps not to stick), drop them into the oil to fry. Loved by even my toddler!

Good recipe, very tasty! Beware scooping too big or oil too hot. I burnt the first few. The recipe makes a LOT!! Wish I had halved it.
