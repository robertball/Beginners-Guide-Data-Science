This is delicious a great way to use fresh tomatoes.  I revised it a little by letting it cool and then pureeing it.  Then I rewarmed it and added about 1/2 cup to a little more heavy cream.  Served it topped with grated parmesan cheese.  It was very good before I changed it, but great after.

Whether this is a 3 or 4 (meaning 5) star recipe depends on who you want to believe, me or Hubs.  Here's my 3-star take - this did NOT trip my trigger.  It reminded me of a can of diced tomatoes (even tho' I did use fresh) with a boatload of herbs added.  That's it... tomatoes and herbs.  Moreover, I just didn't see topping this with gorgonzola and adding the cinnamon wasn't even a viable option.  Gorgonzola and cinnamon?  Three stars, I say - and that's withOUT the cinnamon and gorgonzola.  At least Hubs agreed with me on that much anyway - no way was I going to serve him a bowl of soup with cinnamon and gorgonzola in it.  "Thank you," he said.  But he LOVED the soup, rating it 4 stars which, for anyone else, would mean 5.  He said that most often tomato soups are pureed and include cream; that this was interesting and different for its chunkiness and herbiness.  In the end, it doesn't matter what it's rated, really.  It's a matter of description and individual tastes, pure and simple.

Delicious. Passed it on to my mom right away. Notes: I halved a large sweet onion and sliced it thinly with the grain so it would stay together better during carmalization. I'd say I took the caramalization level to medium, ~20 minutes. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, plus one large fresh tomato roughly chopped with skin on to add some brightness and texture. We don't mind a little skin in our soup and its faster. The cloves of garlic I used were very large, prob. closer to three regular sized. I used sweet vermouth because I prefer it. I omitted the fresh oregano, as I didn't have any on hand. I tried the soup at this point and it was already good, but it was the combination of cinnamon and Gorgonzola that drew me to this recipe in the first place. I love this combo with pears and red wine in risotto. My cinnamon is a particularly sweet variety so I used 1/8 tsp and stirred it into the soup after the cooking was done. I added Gorgonzola to the individual bowls prior to serving. The cinnamon added a subtle complexity and aroma that were just lovely and complemented the salty, nutty cheese beautifully. My husband, who doesnt like tomato soup, said this one was great. Thank you for this recipe.

Have made this several times now.  My family loves this!  I add celery and zucchini.  Substitute a dry white wine,  such as Savingaun Blanc for the vermouth.  I find plum tomatoes work best, but sometimes add heirloom or whatever fresh garden tomatoes I have on hand.  Don't bother to peel any of them.  Haven't tried it with the Gorgonzola.  I find the flavor and aroma of the fresh veggies and herbs to be enough.  Add a slice of crustry bread and you've got a meal.

This was an excellent way to use up fresh tomatoes left over from fall canning.

I love this recipe! I made it with garbanzo beans and fresh green garlic and it turned out fantastic. The gorgonzola and cinnamon really took the flavors of this soup to a whole different level. This soup (like any tomato based soup) goes from good to fantastic with the right tomatoes. Don't use conventional grocery store tomatoes if you want the best flavor! I'm definitely making this soup again.

Wonderful soup! Made it as per recipe, except I used 1/2 cup sweet vermouth and added 1/4 teaspoon cardamom.  Would make it again!
