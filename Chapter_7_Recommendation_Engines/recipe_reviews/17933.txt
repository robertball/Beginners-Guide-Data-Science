I don't use self-rising flour, so I added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt to EACH cup of flour needed. I also varied the assembly somewhat: I put the berries in the 9x13 dish, sprinkled a bit of sugar over them, mixed the flour and sugar together, then added the milk and a tsp of vanilla. I melted the 1/2 cup butter and poured it into the batter. A few quick strokes of the spoon to blend it in a little, then I poured it over all the berries, making sure I covered the berries well. Turned out great!

This recipe is great only if you make changes.  First, I don't use self rising flour.   to regular flour I added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder for every cup of flour.  Plus I added 1/2 tsp salt for every cup of flour.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.

Also,  I but the berries in the bottom of the baking pan.  sprinkled some sugar over the berries.   I then made the mixture  in a seperate bowl and poured it over the berries.

I also used 4 or more cups of blackberries.  

Everybody liked this.  with ice cream or whipped topping.  very good.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  I used Marionberries because they are abundant here in Oregon but just as wonderful as blackberries. If you do not have self rising flour, you can add 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons Salt to the two cups all purpose flour to make your own self rising flour (sift together).  It is clear that the folks who did not like this recipe did not use self rising flour OR overmixed the batter.  Mix gently with a fork and leave LOTS of lumps!  It really is fast, easy, and wonderful!

This recipe was super tasty and SO easy! Remember to use self-rising flour (add 1 T baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt to All Purpose). This is a KEEPER and we'll be trying it with peaches, etc. as soon as more fruit comes into season this summer. YUMMY! I love recipes that are simple and don't require you to go to the store for ingredients!

I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about....this recipe is awesome!! I was almost afraid to try it because of all the bad reviews. I followed the recipe except for 2 minor changes.....added baking powder and salt since I didn't have self-rising flour and I coated my blackberries lightly with sugar before putting them on top of the dough mixture. The cobbler part was nice and fluffy, not chewy at all. I could barely wait for it to cool off before trying. Yum Yum!!! Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this for breakfast every day this week!  It's a cross between a cobbler and a super-moist coffee cake, in my opinion.  Reviewers who found this dish chewy and cornbread-like may have over-mixed, or used all-purpose flour without adding rising agents.  Mine turned out delishously moist, berries ended up on the bottom, top was golden brown.  My only problem with the recipe is the baking time... my oven is typically slow but this was slightly over done by 45 minutes.  So watch closely!

Oh my! This was blackberry heaven. I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white flour with 1 tsp. soda and 2 tsp. powder.  Also added a dash of cinnamon.  I think I would use more next time (cinnamon is a must with blackberries in my opinion).  Who knew delicious treats could be so simple :)

I have used this recipe numerous times and have substituted other fruits.  Fresh or frozen.  My family and even the neighbors love it!  I used 2 cups of regular flour with 1 Tablespoon Baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt.  This is an easy recipe for the kids to help with too.

I should have read all the reviews before baking.  Used regular flour and it did not work at all.  Edges are rubbery, middle is gummy - even after an hour in the oven.  For such a simple recipe, I mistakenly assumed that regular flour must be self-rising.  Would be helpful IMO to put the amounts of regular flour, baking soda or powder and salt in the original recipe.

This recipe was great the way it was. I hate it when people say they have a better way of doing the recipe. If you want to completely change it write your own recipe and get your own reviews.  This cobbler was great in my opinion.

This batter made the cobbler cake like. It had a good taste, but it was not the texture I was looking for. I was looking for a crispier, flakier, texture.

It turned out nicely, once I considered many adjustments to the ingredients, including just writing out for myself the entire recipe using all purpose flour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and melt 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) in 9x13 pan   Mix: 2 cups flour (all-purpose) 3 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt 1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 cups milk (batter is indeed very runny) Layer 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 cups of blackberries over the melted butter Pour batter over the blackberries Bake 45 minutes or so, until golden brown The original recipe called for pouring the batter over the butter and dropping the blackberries into the batter, but I made it both ways and decided that pouring the batter over the berries made for a much prettier presentation.  Excellent taste and very easy - worked as dessert with vanilla ice cream and as a coffee cake in the morning!

I came in second place in the Tallahassee Women Lawyer's Dessert Competition today, with this; and I am a man!  hahaha...  Melt butter on stove top, add 1 tsp vanilla to the batter, put 4 cups of berries (will use a half cup more next time) evenly on top of melted butter, sprinkle a little sugar on berries, pour on the lumpy batter (not too stirred), and check for done after 45 min.  May refrig and reheat next day at 350 F. for half hour or so. These are a compilation of ideas from others. I won second place!!

My husband was farm raised. Nothing tickles me MORE then hearing him say "MMMMmmmMMMmmMMMMMM!!! This tastes JUST like my grandmother's!!" This was sooo EASY BREEZY...and it was baked to perfection   I didn't have any self rising flour so I used the tips from the other reviews (add 1 T baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt to the flour). I did sprinkle the berries with a hint of cinnamon, but that was all I changed.  I may have added closer to 4 cups of berries, but I tell ya…this was deeeeeeeeelish!!! Everyone should KNOW if their oven temperature is accurate. I would guess that’s why it turned out gummy for a few people. Incorrect oven temp OR baking powder that was too old perhaps? It was perfection for us and I did nothing special.  Just followed the recipe. This will be ON the table for many years to come!  It was just TOOOO EASY!

This was not good.  Cooking time at the top of the recipe says 45 minutes.  Directions in step 3 say 1 hour.  I baked about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Outside edges were very tough and overdone, and the bulk of the 9x13 pan was underdone.  It made me sad cause that was a boatload of very nice blackberries...  So sorry, Valerie :(

This is the best blackberry cobbler recipe I have tried yet.  Like many others, I made the adjustment for using regular flour (1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt per each cup of flour).  I also stirred with a light hand, which made the texture perfect.  I also like the fact that it is made in a 13 X 9 X 2" pan so it serves more people.  Great recipe.

This was THE BEST cobbler I've ever had in my life! (Sorry Mom and Grandma!)  My husband raved that it was probably the best dessert I have ever made (Believe me, I do a lot of excellent desserts).  It was so good we couldn't wait to get up in the morning and reheat some with a little cream on top for breakfast.  It wasn't way too sweet or floury tasting like some cobblers I've had.  It had the right amount of crunch to the corners after baking for an hour (my favorite part!).  If there was a 6-star rating, I would give it.  Thanks a million!  I know what I'm taking to my next potluck :)

I made this as written except for what a lot of people said earlier.  I put the berries in first, added a dusting of sugar and cinnamon on top of the berries and added a tsp. of vanilla to the crust mixture. With the simple changes, I found this recipe really tasty!  In fact, three days later I'm making it for my family again per their request.

Super easy, super TASTY recipe.  I would recommend coating the berries in a sprinkling of sugar as suggested... even ripe they can still stand to be a little sweeter.   Great recipe!

Nice, old-fashioned comfort food dessert.  Great with whipped cream, but in my opinion just as good without. The batter is light, fluffy, pleasantly sweet and buttery.  Bakes into a pretty dessert, the edges just a little more done than the rest which is another treat in itself.  I threw in a few raspberries just because I had them and I liked the extra color they added.  Except for making the appropriate substitutions so that I could use regular, all-purpose flour I made no changes and wouldn't necessarily make any the next time I make this either, tho' a little vanilla and/or cinnamon in the batter might be pleasant additions.  Since I made this for just Hubs and myself I scaled the recipe down so that I only used about a cup of berries, then baked it in a shallow, gratin dish, which may or not account for why I had no issues with this not baking properly or completely in the center. Completely satisfied with this recipe for a very simple and rewarding homey dessert.

This was very good and easy! As suggested in here, I used all purpose flour and added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder PER cup of flour. Also, after I sprinkled the blackberries over the batter, I sprinkled about 1 Tbs of sugar over the whole thing. Oh, and I added a dash of vanilla to the milk. Very yummy--a big hit! Thanks.

This is exaclty how we like our cobbler.  More cake like.  If you are looking for pie crust this is not for you.  We LOVED this!!! Only changes were per other reviews.  butter on bottom, blackberries sprinkled w/sugar and cinnamon next.  A little cinnamon and vanilla in batter.  I was going to take some to a friend to share but I doubt there will be any left.

I tried this recipe a few times. The first time I made it I assembled it at home and baked it in the oven at a friend's home. The pan was scraped clean!! The second time I forgot to add self-rising flour and it was very gummy!

This recipe was pretty gummy, but quite tasty none the less. I would highly recommend it for family eating, but not for potlucks or gift giving. It tastes quite nice, but the texture is odd, and not quite as pretty as one might like for presentation.

Simple and easy. Modifications: I added 5 cups of fresh frozen blackberries, sprinkled a little brown sugar on top and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla to batter. Baked 45 minutes. Used self-rising flour. Did not mix butter. Did not overmix batter- just enough to wet most dry ingredients.

So easy and so delicious! Just don't forget baking powder and salt if you don't have any self-rising flour handy! YUMMY!

This recipe is EXACTLY like my Aunt Rose's recipe. It tastes just as wonderful as well.   Perfect!  FYI to some out there, cobbler is not pie.  Im from the south and its a bit crusty and soft down here.  Old country cookin is what this is.  I only put 1 tsp of powder in my 2 cups flour and 1/2 tsp of soda.  Came out perfect!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  I will be making other cobblers with this one. ;)

So simple and came out great. I was really surprised it worked. For non-self-rising flour I used 1/8 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of baking soda for two cups flour.

Edible, but not tasty. I haved the recipes and used regular flour with  1 and 1/2tsp of baking powder and 3/4 tsp of salt. I wound up with a weird bread pudding like consistency and burnt edges, even though I left the batter lumpy. I can hardly taste the blackberries, and am very upset with the waste of good blackberries. I will not make this recipe again.

A delight for my 11-year-old son, who supplied the wild blackberries. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I added a teaspoon of baking powder -- worked fine. Wonderful served warm with a little vanilla ice cream.

Very simple to make, easy measurements and simple ingredients, however, mine came out rubbery and the butter came up to the top around the edges and made a strange looking cobbler.  I guess easy isn't always the best

Tasty and easy!  I prepared it using ALL the ingredients indicated, but added a tsp of vanilla as per Adrienne C.'s recommendation. I placed the berries on the bottom of a 9 X 13 dish and sprinkled with sugar.  Then poured the batter on top.  Cook time for about 55 minutes; I set it for 45 minutes and then added 10 minutes. My husband and I loved it. The batter was just the right amount of sweetness and texture!

This is exactly what I was looking for. I substituted the sugar with Splenda, and since I didn't have self-rising flour I used all-pupose flour and added 2 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. salt. Worked perfectly!

I found that the cobbler portion of this recipe did not turn out as I hoped it would.  It had a texture and taste not unlike a very thick pancake.
Whereas, the berry portion was quite good, not too sweet or sour.  
Unfortunately the "dough" taste, has made this a recipe I will not be making again.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. Next time I think I'll fold the berries into the batter first. I found that most of the berries moved to the center of the pan when baking. I highly recommend this recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe but it wasn't my idea of a cobbler, it was more of a cake.  The cake part tasted good, but it wasn't enough blackberries, not gooey or juicy enough.  Kind of dry.  I think I may try it again without the self-rising flour and see if it isn't more cobbler-like.

This recipe captures the true spirit of "cobbler." The batter goes on the bottom, and then the fruit goes on top. As it bakes, the batter rises and surrounds the fruit creating the perfect balance of cake and fruit in every bite. Putting the fruit on the bottom makes it a different dessert.
As a side note, as with most recipes, I cut the sugar in half. As long your fruit is in season, you don't need all of that extra sweetness. Another note, you might feel like you are putting too much fruit, but the batter can handle a LOT of fruit!

This was the best cobbler i've ever made.  it was large enough to take to a family gathering.  the texture was cake like so if you are looking for a "pie crust" type cobbler this is not it.  The cake like crust was buttery  and golden and absolutely delicious.  I added a few more black berries to mine.  loved it!

Perfect! I also did not have self-rising flour, so I added 1 Tbsp baking powder and 1.5 tsp salt to the flour. 
The second time I made this I had an abundance of peaches. I used diced peaches (tossed with a little sugar) in place of the blackberries and topped with a little cinnamon/sugar mixture. It was AMAZING.

Made the recipe with a little alternation to the recipe.  Mixed blackberries and sugar together and place homemade biscuits on top.  Perfect cobbler.

Loved this recipe. Used all purpose flour, 1 T Baking Powder, 1 t. salt, and 4 cups of fruit instead of 3 1/2. Cooked it for 5 extra minutes though. Used half blackberries and half blueberries. Moist, rich and absolutley delicious with some vanilla ice cream on top while still warm. Will try other fruits next. A Keeper for sure!

This is supper easy and I use it for all types of fruit.  I brown the butter in a sauce pan before I pour it into the baking dish for a little extra flavor.  I never have self rising flour so I add 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder plus 1/4 tsp salt.

Can't think of a better thing to make with a bucket of fresh picked blackberries. This came out more like a bar than a cobbler but it was still delicious. I did not use all the milk as called for.

In my opinion it wasn't awful but it wasn't great either.  This might be because I prefer a cobbler with a crunchy, flaky crust and this did NOT have that.  Be warned that this is a very cake-like cobbler.  I thought the crust was a bit too gummy and tough in places, not light and fluffy like I'd like a cake to be.  But on the plus side this was a very fast easy recipe!

Yum yum yum! This was sooo good!! I had to add about a cup and a half of blueberries to make up the amount of berries but this was fabulous! The berries I had picked were very tart but this recipe made them taste heavenly! I made this per the recipe and I also coated the berries in a little sugar before dropping them in the batter. I'll definately make this again!!

My hubby flipped over this recipe!  This was my first blackberry cobbler and it turned out just perfectly.  
I halved my recipe -AND- I don't use self rising flour so, I just used the all-purpose flour with salt & baking powder added to the recipe.  Also, I added a pinch of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  
Hubby said it was the best cobbler he had ever eaten!  5 STARS!! 
Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe for my family and they loved it! Everyone asked for seconds.  It was even better the next morning for breakfast with a cup of coffee.I also added a cup of blueberries.  This would also make a great muffin recipe.  Very easy and all the ingredients are pantry staples!!! Would recommend to anyone!

This blackberry cobbler has become a favorite of my family, as well as my extended family.  It is so simple and yet so delicious!  I have also made a peach cobbler using the same basic recipe and adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipie is great.  I used all purpose flour but followed others suggestions to add salt and baking powder.  Worked like a charm! The only bad thing is how easy it was to make!  Now my husband wants it all the time, as do I.

If you're looking for a gooey filling topped with crusty cake, then this is NOT the recipe.  This came out more like a biscuit.  The sides were really tasty b/c it was crunchy.  But the middle was kinda bland.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Please try this recipe. The minute I found it, I went straight to the kitchen and made it. The only difference is that I used lowfat ingredients This is a very good recipe. Also, I used frozen blackberries.

My 3yr. old son loved helping to make this one!
We put in 4 cups of blackberries and sprinkled it with more sugar. This one turns out to be a coffe-cake (not a cobbler in my book) and it's really yummy.

This always turns out perfect. You can change or mix the fruits to make other kinds of cobblers ... Add cinnamon if you do blueberry or peach.

Years ago my husband was a scout leader and always trying to find dishes that could be prepared over a camp fire.  He came up with this same dessert made with a box of 1- layer cake mix and cooked in a cast iron dutch oven.  Scouts loved it especially when they could pick some of the fruit thmselves.

This did not work for me. I followed the recipe exact with the exception of self-rising flour. The batter tasted very bland and didn't brown. I might experiment with different versions of it, like using an actual cake batter, or even pancake batter. I think it might work better in a wide baking dish, too. I used round ramekins to make two small ones since it's only the two of us. Kitchen fail, but that's okay. Everything's a learning experience, right?

I followed other's suggestions and added vanilla and cinnamon and added the salt and baking soda.  All in all the recipe was pretty good although I do agree with others that it had a strange texture, cooked more on the edges and less in the middle.

This is a great recipe. I followed many of the suggestions of previous reviews: whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, reduce butter, reduce sugar, put berries on the bottom then pour batter on top... The whole family loves it. We have made it 2x in one week. Highly recommend this recipe.

Very Good.  I didn't have any luck finding fresh or frozen blackberries at the store I went to, but this worked great using a 21oz can of blackberry pie filling.  Maybe this kept it from coming out too cakey, although it did bubble over the dish I used.

this is a hit and very easy! i only had about a pint of fresh blackberries so i cut the recipe in half and made a few changes per the other comments. spinkled cinnamon and sugar on the berries beforehand. used ALL WHOLE WHEAT flour and of course added baking powder and salt. i preheated my cast iron skillet, poured a little of the melted butter in the pan and added the rest to the batter and just barely stirred it in before pouring the batter in the pan and adding the berries. i added vanilla to the batter and also reduced the amount of sugar in the batter (i used 3/4 cup for my half recipe, probably could have gotten away with a little less). mine may have been a little thinner than the recipe intended, it was done in about 40 minutes.  i will try using honey in place of all or part of the sugar next time.

Wow!! This was amazing! I took the advice of the others and added vanilla to the batter. Served it on top of vanilla ice cream and it tasted great. My kids loved it and they are very picky. This recipe is a keeper!!

I only made 1/2 the recipe and used 1/2 flour and 1/2 wheat flour; 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda; didn't have blackberries so I used strawberries and blueberries instead.  The edges turned out tough but the center was ooygooy goodness!  I bet I over baked causing the tough edge.

I wish I would have read the reviews first and not wasted my beautiful, freshly picked blackberries on this recipe. The topping was not a cobbler at all, but a goey tough uncooked blob on the bottom. no juice at all-just seeds left after cooking.

Had a good flavor however,  this was more crust than anything.  Turned out almost like a cake instead of a cobbler.

I too had no luck with this recipe.  I used all purpose flour and added the salt and baking powder as recommended, and left it lumpy so as to not overwork it.  It came out rubbery and gummy.  The batter was very very thin to the point I almost added more flour but wanted to follow it to the T.  Bummer :(

I loved this recipe! Here are my recommendations. Use self-rising flour but sift it before adding sugar and milk. I also used an electric hand mixer so the batter would not be lumpy. I added 1 tsp pure vanilla extract and about 1/2 to 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. It was so good that half of the pan was gone only minutes after it came out of the oven.

This was the easiest cobbler I've ever made and it was all fresh too. No canned ingredients. This was very buttery tasting and made a great "dump cake" without using boxed cake mix. I usually think of cobbler as more pie like and this was a cake dessert with berries baked in. Very very good whatever you call it.

Don't let the simplicity fool you, this is an awesome dessert. I made it as recipe stated,except for adding 1 teaspoon vanilla to batter. My husband and father both raved over it. This is a "keeper"

This is a super easy and super awesome recipe for blackberry cobbler. It's a little "doughier" than a traditional cobbler with blackberries in the center and a double rolled crust, but I actually prefer it this way. The recipe itself could not be any easier, plus it's super easy to modify it to your personal taste (add a little vanilla or cinnamon). I'd give this recipe 6 stars if I could.

I gave this 5 stars, yet I did make a few changes.  I only had 1/2 the amount of fresh berries on hand so I halved the other ingredients and used a 10" pie plate.  I cut back on the amount of butter to 3 TBLS. I also prayed the pie plate with non stick spray then added the berries with a little sugar over them.  I mixed the remaining ingredients in a bowl and poured over top of the berries.   This was delicious!  I can't wait to try it with other berries as well!  I will stick with making it in a pie plate unless it is for a crowd, then the bigger version wil be essential, this is so good!!!

Loved it! I used regular flour and added the 1-1/2 tsp of baking power and 1/2 tsp of salt per 1 cup of flour, 1 tsp of vanilla.  I put first the melted butter on the pan, then added the blackberries, sprinkled sugar and cinnamon and then added the mix to the blackberries. I baked it for exactly one hour and it came out so delicious, I made another one the following week.  It is one of my favorite desserts now.  I eat it with vanilla ice cream, yum!

Sensational! Chewy and delicious. I added 3 tsp baking pwd. and 1 tsp salt to the flour.  I used 1/4 c. of the sugar to toss with the blackberries and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Can't wait to try it with other fruits!

Even with additional flour this was a bit soupy.  It was well liked but I felt it was a bit too liquidy.  Maybe if it was made the previous day and allowed to set up overnight in the fridge it would do better.

This is the best, and easiest cobbler I have made. I have tried many different recipes, and they never quite made a hit. This one really did. It has just the right balance of tart and sweet. I am so glad I tried it!

So I just made this this morning as I have an event this afternoon that I have to bring a dessert to.  Haven't tasted it yet, but how easy and simple to prepare!  I followed the instructions exactly and so far it loooks great and smells heavenly!  I'll add to my review after we dig in and give it a taste...UPDATE: Delicious!  A hit with everyone who tried it, though the blackberries were a little tart.  Otherwise a quick and easy dessert to take with me.  Will be making this one again soon!

Finally! A blackberry pie that I dont have to look all over town for! I made it exactly as directed - yes, the batter look kinda runny and lumpy, but I left as is. I also made this in 3 small mini-meatloaf pans. I had to cook for i hour though. The tops were nice and crusty! I too, added sugar to the berrys before baking. Yummy! This will be a lifelong family treat!

Delicious.. I used 1/2 cup less sugar, and sub'd 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the white.  How enjoyable this is paired with Tillamook vanilla bean ice cream!

This was delicious! I loved how the breading of the cobbler was a bit chewy on the edges from the butter- it was almost like a toffee bar. So good!!! I followed another reviewers advice and sprinkled my berries with sugar before baking. This was delicious, especially with ice cream! :)

Very good and very easy... Please note that this IS NOT a rolled crust cobbler. If that's what you are looking for, there are many other great recipes on this site for that kind of cobbler. Personally, I prefer the doughy texture of this cobbler as opposed to the rolled crust of the pie. The crust soaks up the juices from the berries (which sink to the bottom) and it makes a rich, delicious dessert. Great with some vanilla ice cream!

I really liked the convenience of this recipe.  It would be fun to make with kids because the blackberries start out on top and end up on the bottom.

I made this for a church picnic today and it was just yummy !   I also added salt and powder to my white flour instead of using self rising flour and it came out just fine.   I made it like the recipe instructed and had a beautiful golden crust over the whole top.  Everyone loved it.  I will use this again for other fruit cobblers.

This recipe was so easy.  I followed the advice of the other reviews and added more berries, but that was the only change I made.  It turned out really moist and was extremely tasty!  I'll definitely make this again.

Like others have said, not truly a cobbler, but my family loves this just the same. Very quick and easy. I keep a bag of self rising flour on hand just for this recipe. My father-in-law went crazy last summer picking blackberries so I would have enough to make cobbler all winter. And I have!!!

This is the best blackberry cobbler I had. My husband loves to eat it and I love to fix it. It is so easy like 1/2/2/2/3. Who can't remember this ratio? Enjoy! It's worth making it!

Not a traditional cobbler with a crust, but more of a coffee cake.  Definitely delicious and extremely easy, though.  I've made this several times, and dump in two pint containers of blackberries (washed) instead of just 3 1/2 cups as called for.  My husband and father love it.

If I could have given it a zero rating, I would have.   It seemed simple, but it turned out horrible.  It was gummy, flavorless and NOTHING like a cobbler.   I would look for something else.

I didn't have time for blackberry picking before I made this, so I bought half blackberries and half raspberries. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose (along with baking powder and salt as specified in the Allrecipes Bread collection FAQ's). I also replaced some of the sugar with honey, added a dash of cinnamon, and used a delicious Dutch butter. The results were truly excellent! Although the texture was cake-like as many have mentioned, we found it delightful. We particularly liked the contrast of the firm edges with the spongey interior. With a dollop of frozen vanilla yogurt, this easily assembled dish was a wonderful summer dessert that we can't wait to enjoy again soon!

This recipe is fantastic!  I have 20 acres that are FULL of blackberries and needed a quick dessert for guests after we went picking.  Everone raved about this and I have made it 3 times in the past two weeks.  It cuts easily for transferring into gift baskets and only takes a few minutes to make.

This was "good" but have had better.  Easy and fast, but if you spent the money on fresh blackberries, find a better more flavorful recipe.  I used frozen blackberries and it came out pretty good.

This recipe was extremely easy and tasted great. I used frozen blackberries and plan to try the recipe again in the future using other types of fruits.

Very simple and tasted great!  The crust on the bottom was a little "chewey" on the edges.  Easy recipe to follow and make.

We used twice the berries, and it was wonderful!
Easy, quick, and not too sweet!

I made this last night.I used regular flour so I added 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt for each cup of flour. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This is definately is a keeper.It's easy to make and tastes great!

Made tonight with fresh picked black caps and some frozen berries to make up difference. Used suggestions for compensating for not having self rising flour. Devoured by whole family.

My family has used this recipe since my aunt shared it in 1950! We usually made it with peaches, but you need to add some spices that you would add for a peach pie to the fruit and make part of the sugar brown sugar & a pinch of allspice and a bit of cinnamon to the sugars...I may try this with  half whole wheat & half all purpose flour sounds great!

I thought this was really good, very easy to make. I had a dark pan so turned the oven down to 325 and had to cook it about 1hr 10 mins. Perfect served with vanilla ice cream!

I did exactly what Adrienne C. suggested (except had self rising flour). It's not sugary sweet so if you're hoping for that, maybe add a streusel. I think it's amazing as if. If my sweet tooth is in overdrive, cool whip with warm cobbler hit the spot!

I made this recipe with the help  of the suggestions from reviews. Added salt and vanilla flavor. Also i had to use baking soda instead of the baking powder, not sure if there is much of a difference. It came out really good. Oh! I also used blackberry cobbler from a jar i bought at Bucce,s store. Really good stuff.

So easy and delicious!  Followed the adaption for all purpose flour by adding the baking powder and salt in the recommended amounts and it turned out picture perfect. A wonderful recipe that I will use for other fruits as well. My 3 guys devoured it!

Although I love the doughy crust of this type of cobbler, this was too much dough.  It took all the liquid from the berries, making the cobbler a bit dry.  Also, the berries were not sweet enough.  If I make this again, I will sweeten the berries a little and let them sit and produce juice of there own.  Maybe that will help.

REALLY good... used 2 cups of blueberries and used 1/2 a recipe in a 9x9 pan.  Also, since the blueberries were very sweet I cut the sugar in half, and I thought the sweetness was perfect.  Thank you...I will be making this with peaches tomorrow!

How can something this simple be so good?  My personal preference is to add some cinnamon to the cobbler batter.

Excellent recipe, spectacular use for sub-par blackberries. I had a bag of frozen berries, many of which were so under ripe that they were completely red, and they were delicious in this. 
Anyone attempting to re-size this recipe should keep in mind that it rises A LOT in the oven... mine more than doubled in size.

Absolutely LOVED! I halved the recipe and it was so yummy! It was gone in one night! I used the baking powder and salt since I didn't have self-rising flour and it worked great. I can't wait to try it with a variety of other fruits!!

Great recipe! Received rave reviews from friends and family who gobbeled it down. Only change I made was I put the blackberries and sugar down first and poured the dough over. I also added a little more sugar than was called for. Great recipe for really any type of fruit cobbler, not just blackberries.

This deserves 5 stars for it's ease, but I thought it could use a lot more berries - closer to 5 cups for the amount of bread-like topping the recipe makes.

I had an inkling from the recipe that this wasn't really what I was looking for in a cobbler but tried it anyway because of the great reviews.  I wasn't impressed.  It definitely needs something (cinnamon?).  But it's also very "cakey" with a little mushed fruit on the bottom.  I prefer my cobbler fruitier with more of a crumble top so I'll keep trying other recipes on here.  This one was not for me.

This was great recipe!  Will definitely make again!  I didn't use as many blackberries as the recipe called for because I wanted a little more crust.  Other than that minor change I did nothing different.

This is an excellent, easy recipe.  I put one in the oven when everyone sits down for Thanksgiving dinner. The difficult to make and fancy store bought desserts are left uncut, the cobbler is gone in minutes.  The young ones top with ice cream, the older ones top mix with milk and nutmeg.  You can not go wrong with this one for a crowd, it's cheap, easy, and delicious.

Delicious.  Great texture, the cobbler was crispy around the edges, nice and fluffy, with blackberries oozing out.  Topped with vanilla ice cream...so good! In almost 10 years of marriage, my husband has never eaten desserts.  He likes chocolate chip cookies and that's it.  He liked the way this smelled, tried it, then ate a second bowl full!  It only took about 45 minutes to cook, not an hour.

The flavor of this was good but the texture was not.  The top was chewy and the inside was too cakelike.  Looks like cobbler, but doesn't taste like it.  Sorry.

Super easy- added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter- didn't use as much sugar (our berries were super sweet) and it came out great!

As I don't routinely have self-rising flour in my pantry, I made the changes as suggested by Caramello in her review.  I also did half white sugar and half brown, added a couple of "glugs" of half and half to the milk, and added a 1/4 cup wheat flour to the flour to make up for the additional liquid.  I also added almond extract, vanilla extract and cinnamon to the blackberries. Even so, I told my husband after putting in the oven that this recipe seemed deceptively easy and I had my doubts about the finished product.  Not to worry:  this is a fabulous tasting and fabulously easy recipe that just begs for vanilla ice cream and says summer picnic to me.  Great recipe, Valerie!

I cut the recipe in half and made in an 8X8" glass dish with fresh blackberries.  It was incredibly delicious and as easy as any recipe can possibly get.  I had just the right amount of cobbler to fruit ratio.  It's a keeper for sure.  Thanks!

It is a great cross between coffee cake and cobbler, crisp on the top and moistr inside. I added some strawberries to the blackberries and they cooked beautifully adn added another layer of flavor.  It's a keeper!  Thanks!

I've used this recipe twice now.  I love it!  I made it once using frozen blackberries I had on hand and tonight with some canned pineapple chunks tossed in some brown sugar.  This one turned out like a upside down pineapple cake version of it.  YUM!

This is a great simple recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was hoping for a more traditional cobbler (traditional for me atleast). I used handpicked berries and the recipe turned out fabulous. My husband complained it wasn't sweet enough, but I thought it was perfect. Thank you!

This cobbler was simple and delicious!!! I used a triple berry blend (blueberries, blackberries, raspberries) in place of the blackberries. Also, I did not have self rising flour so I used plain flour and added 1/4 tsp of salt and 2and 1/2 tsps of baking powder. I also added 1/4 cup of sugar to my berries. I will be making this cobbler again!!!!

TRY IT WITH HALF WHITE AND HALF BROWN SUGAR, A BIT ON CINNAMON, AND 1/4 TSP VANILLA.  WE DID THIS WITH PEACHES AND THE RESULT WAS VERY GOOD.

I LOVE this recipe! From start to finsih, just as it says, it's in the oven in 10 minutes. I live in central Mexico and fresh fruit is available year round so having a good recipe where I can use it up is essentail. Thanks, Valerie!

This is a easy and delicious cobbler. The only thing I did was, added tsp of cinn and pinch of nutmeg. With a top of vanilla ice cream, you got yourself a real treat...

5 stars because it was just too easy and tasted wonderful.  I was concerned that the batter was too thin before baking and thought I had done something wrong, but it came out great.  I didn't have too many blackberries and used some blackberry jam as a sub.. While it worked the jam was just a tad too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe

Just like my mom's and both grandmas - dripping with butter and a cake-like top. To me, this is a true cobbler. I add cinnamon, too. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I added a splash of vanilla and some cinnamon to the batter, then sprinkled sugar over the berries before baking.  I have a similar recipe I also make which calls for a large can of sliced peaches and their juice to be spooned over the top instead of blackberries.

I don't know what i did wrong.  I didn't use self rising flour but i did put in baking powder maybe why this came out so bad.  I had to cook an additional 30 min. and it still was not cooked enough.  Daughter and boyfriend liked it but it was just to raw.

Super recipe. I had a bumper crop of blackberries and after making lots of jam, this came in very handy.  In fact, it was so good that I made three of them and shared with family and friends.  I didn't change a thing to this recipe except after baking, I sprinkled the top with some sugar. Thanks!

Quick and easy basic cobbler! With our large blackberry harvest this year I've made it twice now, both times I halved the ingred's and made it in and 8x8. The second time I splashed in a bit of vanilla. Really good with ice cream too!

Delicious and easy. I used Heart and Hands self rising flour recipe. The berries I picked were so tart but this cobbler recipe toned them down. Super served warm with vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!

This is a very easy and tasty cobbler/cake.  First I tried it with amixture of peaches and raspberries.  Then I taught my 8-year old nephew to make it with raspberries and blueberries.   It's really rich and sweet.  I want to try some healthy substitutions or cut back on the sugar and butter.  The recipe is so simple, it will be easy to experiment.

This was super easy and tastes great!  I was short on ingredients, so I cut the recipe in half and used a 9x9 baking dish.  Great with ice cream!

This reminded me of my grandmother's recipe!
I added a tsp or two of baking powder and I'm sure it helped it to rise a bit...
I was a little skeptical at first-- it was rather soupy/thin when going into the oven.
But it came back out wonderful and my company gobbled it up!! 
Thanks!

I just made this, and loved it.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and baked for 50 minutes.  I'm sure I'll make it a lot, it is so quick and easy.  Thanks, Valarie!!!

so disappointing.  agree with previous reviewer...this came out a pasty, gummy greasy mess.  this recipe is missing either eggs or baking powder.  flour alone not enough of a leavening agent i guess...oh well, back to the drawing board!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  This was so simple. I remembered to use the baking powder and baking soda. The only thing I would do differently next time is the amount of butter in the bottom of the pan....maybe only half.  Otherwise this was fantastic, so simple and you have everything on hand!  Thank you so much!

YUM! Super easy and a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I used King Arthur "White" Whole Wheat Flour with 1 tblsp baking poweder and 1 1/2 tsp salt and substituted canned evaporated milk diluted with water (to make 2 cups) for fresh milk. I can't understand why anyone wouldn't love this recipe. It's the BEST!

I thought this was pretty good.  I cut in half and baked in 8x8 pan.  Also, used AP flour and 1 t baking power, 1/2 t salt.  Also used frozen fruit -- 1/2 blueberries and 1/2 raspberries.  Fast, easy, and it baked up beautifully.  Next time I will add a little lemon juice to fruit for a little tartness & flavor.

I made this recipe today, and I was
very dissappointed, it was awful UGH!
maybe it was missing some ingredients,
as I followed it exactly, was it just
flour, milk and sugar mixed together,
and poured on top of melted butter,
it came out very heavy and solid, what a
waste of time and blackberries i'd picked.
never again.

This was so quick and easy to make -- and my house
smelled wonderful! I picked enough berries to make
two cobblers, but made one to start with. It was
delicious! Won't mind trying this with blueberries
as well.

I followed the directions exactly, but it was floating in butter and very gummy. The taste was good, but I wouldn't make this again. Not a cobbler in my book.

I was losing faith after watching this thing bubble for over an hour, and I had cut the recipe in half. (input 5.5 servings) But it browned beautifully, and husband, an avowed connoisseur of cobblers, really, really liked it. And I used canned (gasp) blackberries. Extremely easy, and will next time use fresh berries.

This was as quick and easy as everyone said.  I substituted 2 cups plain flour, 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. salt for the self-rising flour.  Even my husband, who isn't much on blackberries, liked it.

Cut the recipe in half.  Used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Next time will  add a little sugar to the blackberries.  All in all a delicious dessert.

Excellent recipe. Didn’t have enough blackberries so supplemented with chopped fresh peaches. No changes to recipe otherwise; next time a little almond extract in the batter might add complexity of flavor and fragrance. Otherwise, couldn’t improve upon it if I tried!

It’s easy and delicious. I didn’t have self-rising flour so I used regular flour and 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder per cup of flour. It is so good! I will make it again.

Living in Oregon on between 6 and 7 acres I'm overwhelmed with an endless supply of Marion Berries (Oregon's name for blackberries). So I make a lot of things with the free berries I pick. This recipe was Great. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I thought it was a bit to much filling with the thick cake so made it again with less batter and more berries and it was just as tasty but less filling, so this is a Great recipe and so simple to put together.

I followed another reviewer's advice of using baking powder and regular flour. It came out good, this dessert just isn't anything super special. An hour seemed like a little much though.

I added cinnamon to the batter. It was a little sweet. Next time I will use less sugar and maybe peaches. Very good consistency and taste.

Lesson learned- read the reviews first! I used all purpose flour, and noticed afterwards that it should have been self rising! Because of that, it came out gummy and tough. That was too bad- cos the blackberries that left me with slashes on my legs for my labors were wasted. I would have put on the recipe **If using regular flour, add baking powder'.  Will go get more berries, but will use a different cobbler recipe next time with regular flour~

As other reviewers, I used regular flour with bkg. pwdr and salt.  I didn't have enough blackberries, so I used about 1 C. of blueberries mixed in.   I  used two smaller pans, which I sprayed with non-stick spray, because I hate scrubbing pans!  Right before putting it in the oven, I sprinkled with about 1/2 C. of sliced almonds and dusted with a spice mill that had crystal sugar, cinnamon, cardamom and ginger, etc.   I served warm with whipped cream and another dusting from the spice mill. Fabulous!   My husband couldn't get enough!

I made this and really enjoyed it. My kids however didn't like the blackberries. I switched to using peaches but continued to use the recipe for the dough. I've used the recipe several times and every body loves it.

This is delicious, just as written.  I can't eat it fast enough.I am in the Pacific Northwest, so I can pick fresh berries every year. The cobbler is the reward for getting raked by the thorns!

My hubby loved it! Didn't have self-rising flour so added 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt to the 2 cups all purpose flour and the crust was just perfect! I did sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon into the batter before pouring over the butter. Great recipe!

First off, this recipe was easy.  I followed the directions as listed but I added vanilla - about a teaspoon.  It baked in my oven for about an hour and came out wonderful.  So far my husband and sons have had seconds so this recipe is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

Made with other users suggestions, did not use the self rising flour and had really good results thank you Adrienne C for the recommendations they were very helpful. This does end up being more  of a cake texture and makes a lot, I cut the recipe in half and had plenty for 6 people.

Since I had 3 small (10oz.) bags of frozen blackberries, I used those in place of fresh. I also upped the flour so it would absorb some of the juices from the frozen berries so I ended up using 3 c of regular flour with 3 t baking powder and 3/4 t salt in place of the 2c of self-rising flour. I kept milk, butter and sugar the same. Super good! Crispy and chewy crust. And so much easier than cutting the butter like regular cobblers.

I love this - so easy to make and my husband thought it was delicious. I didn't have self rising flour so followed the helpful advice on adding the right amount of baking soda and salt. I did add some cinnamon and vanilla too. I liked putting the berries in before the batter because it was easier to spread them out evenly. I also like that it has no eggs because my mom is allergic to them. She's going to love this recipe too

Very good with the changes mentioned in other comments.  Used regular flour, so added baking powder and salt.  Put blackberries on the bottom and sprinkled with small amount of sugar.  Added melted butter to mixture, stirred a few times and poured over berries.  Baked 55 minutes and it was nice and brown on  top.

Followed the directions, just a couple minor changes. I used regular flour and added the baking powder and salt. I used raw sugar because that is what I had on hand. I used 4 cups of berries coated in raw sugar and cinnamon. An easy, but awesome dessert. We used vanilla ice cream for a topping. Heavenly! Thanks for sharing.

It's a chewy, greasy, thick crust around edge & soggy in the middle & trying to be a coffee cake? Wasted our blackberries.  Took review advice & added baking powder & salt because I had regular flour but next time I'll try a real cobbler recipe.

I thought it would be okay to add the baking powder to my regular flour with the salt, so I could taste the baking powder which I did not like. I also like my blackberry cobbler to be more juicy. I am sorry guys, but not so good.

Delicious! I followed the recipe just as written other than using 4 cups of berries - black berries and mulberries mixed. The cake part was light and fluffy and the perfect blend of flavors - not too sweet. Perfect!

Followed the recipe. However it was done at about 50 minutes! It was very good! It wasn't crisp and was more like cake. Next time I think I'll add more berries for my personal taste. Overall a nice cobbler.

I followed the advice of others and added 2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt since I only had all purpose flour. It turned out fabulous...it looked beautiful and tasted even better than it looked. My husband raved (and he tends to find something wrong with everything - very picky) and my 7 year old licked her plate clean, literally. It's super easy; my daughter helped me make the batter. I highly recommend this recipe!

My husband always talks about his Mom making blackberry cobbler. I was worried I may not find a recipe that would even compare to what he remembers. He had two helpings right out of the oven. My sons loved it too. I used all purpose flour and added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt to each cup of flour. I also added a tsp of vanilla. The Mmmmmm and Ohhhhh Yummm that came from my husband and kids made me a very happy Mommy!

Made this recipe with only one change, substituted almond-coconut milk for regular milk and it was awesome. Made it for Christmas and there was not a crumb leftover, it was devoured by all! May try further adjustments next time and add some cinnamon but overall this is a keeper!

Very good--but be sure to add MORE fruit. I added a little over 4 cups and thought it needed a bit more.  Otherwise it was GREAT!

I followed the directions for using all purpose flour (1 TB baking powder 1 1/2 tsp salt, sifted with the flour).  I put it in a smaller pan so it ended up with a lot of cake on top.  It was delicious warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  My whole family loved it!

I do most of the cooking since my wife still works.  I haven't baked very much.  Porter Peaches are in season here in Ok so used them.  Peeled 7 to get 4 c.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Results were perfect.  I took them to a cook out.  None left.  Great!

Yummy!  Wonderful for breakfast.  Used 4 cups of blackberries because I had a lot of them and tossed them with some turbinado sugar before putting on the top.  That is the only slight change that I made ~ delicious!  Thank you for such an easy and wonderful recipe!

It was great!!! I did like the other people and didn't use the self-rising flour, and I did add some Vanilla, but the recipe itself was wonderful. I look forward to trying it with some other kind of fruits. I will definitely make is again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some of the blackberries we picked this spring. This was excellent and well loved by our family. I used whole wheat flour (and thus added the 1/2 t of salt and 1 1/2 t of baking powder to make it "self rising") and it was still fantastic! My husband has already requested I make it again!

This is a really good recipe.  I did cut the butter in half though, and I add 2 tsp of cinnamon to the berries and 1/4 cup of brown sugar to berries after washing and draining them well.

For some reason my batter wasnt lumpy at all. It was rather runny actually, but it was still pretty good. It turned out more like chewy berry bars, maybe becuz I used all purpose flour, not self rising. And I used blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. A scoop of vanilla icecream makes it even better

After reading the reviews, I knew I was going to be getting a more "cake like" cobbler rather than the usual "crusty" cobbler I am used to down South - fine...I'll try it out. I don't know what I did wrong, but the texture was nothing like I expected. It was like rubber, not like cake. I didn't even let my boyfriend try it because I found it so inedible. I tried to patch it up a bit by serving it with ice cream, but that didn't even save it. Sadly, almost the entire pan went to the trash. Sorry Valerie - this one just wasn't for me .

The first time I made this I added too much milk (my husband was "helping" me!) but it came out sort of like an English style pudding.  It was good!  The second time, I followed the recipe exactly, and found it a little on the dry side, with too much cake.    I think if I make this again, I will double the fruit, sprinkle it with sugar, then pour the fruit in first. I may even add more milk than necessary! :)

Wonderfully quick and simple.  I made a lot of substitutions, whole wheat backing flour, turbinado sugar, added 1T baking powder, cinnamon, and 1 tsp salt and took it to work.  My new co-workers loved it and are still raving about it.  I tried it again tonight and added raspberries and blueberries and split it into 4 small dishes and a springform dish so that I can sample and still take a whole cobbler to work.  Wonderfully simple!

I love this cobbler!  This recipe makes a delicious, rich fruit dessert with a fluffy, spongey cake-like texture that tastes both elegant and down-home.  I especially love it warm with cream poured over the top.... fantastic!

I've made this dish several times, and use any kind of berries that are fresh and on sale. You can easily make a vegan version using margarine and soy milk (I use original) - tastes just as great and you don't feel like you're missing anything. Great basic recipe!

This is a great base recipe, ready for adjusting if desired.  I used white whole wheat flour with baking powder and salt, then I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, and it could probably be reduced more.  My batter was too wet, because I was trying to use up some milk, so it's delicious but more wet than I expected. The wet batter also let my berries sink, so I'll make sure to keep it more solid next time.  Thanks for this easy one that the kids can help with!

Picked some fresh berries on the way home from a summer drive, and decided to whip up some cobbler.  This recipe was so easy, as all the ingredients were already lying around.  Very quick to prep, and well worth the hour wait!  I followed advice from other ratings, and added baking powder and salt, as well as a little extra sugar on the blackberries.  Looking forward to trying it with other berries as well!

It really tastes good, but I almost doubled the berries. I'm glad I did. It would have been berry flavored cake otherwise.

Easy to make and tasty but a cobbler should have a crisper crust (perhaps a southerner's expectation?). This works GREAT as a brunch menu item though!!!

I should have read all the reviews first. Edges are chewy, middle is a bit odd: kind of like a not-quite-done muffin. We'll eat it smothered in ice cream. I will try again and use other people's suggestions.

I made this recipe exactly as it states and I thought it was very good. The only thing that bothered me were the seeds in the blackberries, but I thought it was great and very easy to make. Mine cooked in about 40 minutes rather than 1 hour. Would be very easy to use any fruit you wanted!

This was my first time making cobbler. I'm just learning to bake in general, but the cobbler came out chewy and I didn't care for it all that much. It is probably something I did, but I'm not sure!

Just made it tonight and just finished my first bite.  Very good indeed!  Glad I choose this recipe and it was very easy to make.  There is a recipe online here for self rising flour, followed that and everything turned out fine. Served it warm with whipped cream.   I will post a pic here later.  Mom tested, Kids and family approved.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I sure thought this was a bit to spongey tasting!  Next time I would probably but the berries under the mixture instead of on top of the flour, milk & sugar mixture!

I followed the other suggestions to add 1 T baking powder and 1 1/2 t salt, then followed the rest of the directions exactly. It was great! Very cake like, very moist, very easy. I will definitely make it again.

Family loved this. I only needed to bake for 45 minutes. I did mix the batter by hand so not to overbeat. Used 1 T baking powder and 1 & 1/2 t salt for the reg flour. Used thawed frozen berries mixed with 1/4 c sugar, 1 t cinnamon. Perfect!!!

This is delish!! Regardless of what you want to call it....coffee cake, cobbler-whatever, it is very good!! The only change I make is adding about 1/2c more berries and I also toss a streusel topping on top about half-way through baking. I finish it up with a generous scoop of home-made vanilla ice cream.....YUM!

This was great, everyone at my office loved it, I used some of the reviews and put the berries in the bottom of the pan with some sugar over top then poured on the batter...I also served with some icing (milk & powdered sugar) over top, the berries were fresh and I was worried they would be tart. This is great, it could be used with any fruit!

I thought this was good, not great - doesn't a true cobbler have a crumb topping?  It was easy to make, even for a non-baker such as myself.  Don't waste money on self-rising flour; as others suggested, I used regular flour with baking powder and salt, and it rose just fine.  The bottom crust had a nice, buttery flavor.

Excellent texture of the cobbler part and the berry part was sweet.  We used fresh picked blackberries.  This is better than what my grandma used to make! Thank you for submitting the recipe.  Oh, and I cooked it in a 9x13 pan, not a skillet.

This should be called "The easiest to make and BEST blackberry cobbler in the world!" My family and I LOVED it! I will use this recipe for the rest of my life! I was so happy when my 2 boys and husband could hardly stop eating long enough to tell me the BLACKBERRY COBBLER tasted BETTER THEN CANDY! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I am not a big fan of blackberries, but this was excellent!!  I did increase the amount of sugar used.  My husband kept commenting on how much he loved the breading!!  Will definitely make this again.

This is the strangest cobbler i have ever made! At first i thought i had made a mistake because the better is soooo runny. But it all cooked up ok- sort of... The taste of this cobbler is really good- however, the texture is a bit strange. It is sort of half way between a coffee cake and a cobbler. I can see why others thought it was gummy. My blackberries didnt sink either- they sort of stayed on top and the cobbler baked on the bottom. Over all, i would probably make this again if i was in a lazy mood and wanted an easy recipe. 
Oh yeah- i did add cinnamon and a bit of vanilla to the recipe and also used one cup on blueberries with my blackberries.

My family LOVED this cobbler!  I added a bit of cinnamon to the berries and added baking soda and salt to all purpose flour as suggested by other reviewers.

This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe! I am slightly lactose intolerant and so i had to substitute the butter with vegetable oil spread and instead of milk i used the coffee creamer mocha mix and i accidentally used too much cinnamon but it was still wonderful and i love blackberries so i probably used a little bit more than 4 cups but still i will probably make this over and over again! Mine wasn't spongy at all like other people complain of!

Followed the recipe, except used a little less blackberries (because I like more crust).  Turned out great.  Probably not the best blackberry cobbler I've ever had, but pretty tasty.  I give it 5 stars for it being quick and easy.

I added cinnamon to the batter and a small amount of sugar to the blackberries. This is a quick and easy recipe as well as delicious to make anytime. I used frozen blackberries since fresh one's aren't in season.

This recipe was as simple as you could get, but the texture wasn't great.  Where there were many berries, it seemed a bit soggy, although it was baked thoroughly.  A great flavor, just not so fabulous texture.  I served it to 5 men, a child and me, and all liked it, except my husband, who got a fruity inside piece, that he felt was too gummy. Not bad, but there are just much better recipes.

I just made this tonight and followed it exactly. It turned out nice and moist, the cobbler is sweet and goes well with the tartness of the blackberries. I like it alot and thanks for sharing this recipe :)

Let me start out by saying my daughter baked 2 of these this weekend, one to keep and one to take to a Christmas potluck.  She used frozen blackberrys from out of our yard from this summer.  I didn't supervise so not sure if she did it right or not but I suspect she did not bake long enough.  Ours didn't look like the picture - not that brown.  It was also a gooey mess.  That being said my husband ate all of ours and about half got eaten at the potluck.  So I guess it was ok.

I spent hours hand picking the perfect blackberries for a cobbler to take to a 4th of July party. This was by far the worst blackberry cobbler recipe ever!

I was skeptical as I made it, because it sounded like making some sort of cake... but hopeful, and the results were pretty bad.  The "cake" was really rubbery and doughy as others have stated.  The only salvation was the blackberries, which I picked off and ate alone.  Definitely not a cobbler.

Cobbler, it's not! It's more like cake. I wondered how reviews could vary so much, now I know.  It's all based on your expectation.  It was a bit chewy, but the actual taste was not bad. Definitely was not the cobbler I expected.  Will not waste fresh berries on this again.

This turned out awful! Not what I was looking for at all. The texture was chewy and rubbery. Will not make again. Recipe wasn't a total loss. I pulled off the top part of the cobbler(mostly berries),heated it up and served with vanilla ice cream.

My husband loves this recipe.  I use one package of frozen blackberries, cut the recipe in half and bake it in a 9x9 dish.  I used all-purpose flour and added baking powder & salt.  The cobbler part rises and gets real fluffy and the juices from the berries blend right into the cobbler.  Very quick & easy prep for outstanding results.

Incredibly nasty!  What a total waste of wonderful, fresh picked blackberries.  The cobbler part of it turned out gummy and rubbery.  I expect cobbler to turn out like dumpling-type things laying on top of the berry part.  This had a slimy cake-like substance with the berries on top of it.

Not what we expected at all.  My sons choked down one serving & the rest didn't get eaten.

The cake was dense, as others have indicated.  It tasted delicious, though.  We preferred it refridgerated for a day or two so that the flavors melded together better.

This was a very simple recipe with good results, I have to say I would add more blackberries or less batter.  It was a little to "cakey" for me.

The recipe is better with slightly more sugar in it, and with a bunch sprinkled on top.  I think it has a bit too much butter, though.  I may try it with less next time.

Simple, quick, and wholesome fun!  Our group of teens had fun picking the berries and enjoyed the "fruit of their labor" with this delicious cobbler!

This was way easier than picking the berries. My six year old did it almost by himself. 
It's delicious! I didn't bake it an hour though, only about 50 minutes but that could just be my oven.

Excellent recipe - I bake this about once a month and everyone loves.  It's great either hot or cold.  It's so good that nobody even wants the whipped cream!  Thank you Valerie!

I think this recipe was very good, but it is not your traditional cobbler with oatmeal and brown sugar.  I would definitely use it as a quick recipe to get rid of extra blackberries and would even take it to social events.

Absolutely easy and very delicious.  I will definitely bake this again--perhaps try blueberries next time.

This was a great recipe for my children to help me make after they picked all the blackberries themselves!
