Let me start by saying that I am eating and enjoying this recipe right now. It's not that it's not any good, it's just that it needs some serious tweaking.  I will definitely make this again, but when I do I will definitely NOT be putting the dry bread cubes in the bottom of the crockpot. They stayed dry, and that was not really appetizing. The top part is quite tasty, though.   I will also be softening the onion and celery in some butter before adding them, because they stayed too crunchy for my taste.   It also has to be said that this thing looks unappetizing as all get out, but it really does taste surprisingly good, cranberries and all. Also, serve it with a light veggie or salad,  because it is HEAVY!

Thank you for this recipe.  With three little ones under 4 this was the perfect quick fix.  Next time I will leave the cranberry sauce out for the side, it was a little too sweet.  It also came out quite runny, so I will use half the about of gravy and condensed mushroom soup.  I used whole chicken breasts, and it came out great.  Thanks!

Delicious!  My husband loved it, said it smelled like the best parts of Thanksgiving dinner rolled into one while it was cooking.  Made this after reading all reviews - chose it because folks described it as moist and as one reviewer said, "mushy." I added more of the veggies by 1/2 cup each and left out the cranberry sauce.  I had to use my 5 qt. pot. The last hour of cooking I needed to add about 1/2 can of chicken broth and stir as the mix was too dry; the bottom bread was dry.(could be my altitude?) Turned out perfectly!  This will be a favorite.

This was amazing. My picky Husband loved it and we had no leftovers. We had friends over who love it when I try new recipes out on them and they loved it too. I did leave out the cranberry sauce since my husband hates that and served it on the side. Great dish. Thanks.

This is an ok recipe. The problem for me was the bread cubes at the bottom. They stayed dry and unappetizing. I had to get them out of the crock pot. Once I got them out, the rest was good. I even added the cranberry and it was just about the right amount of sweetness to go with the savory of the sage. I also added summer savory to it.  The next time I make it, I will not put the dry bread cubes at the bottom. I will make double the match of the stuffing mixture and put someo n the bottom and some on the top. I think that will fix the dryness for me (I HATE dry food). With a few fixes it might be a 5 star.

I'm not going to throw out this recipe because I definitely think it has potential. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that it only needed 4 hours in the slow cooker. I turned it on and left for work and left it for more than 8 hours. My house stinks of burnt stuffing. I made it without the cranberry sauce. That just didn't appeal to me. The part that didn't burn wasn't terrible.  Just pay attention to the time.

I was so looking forward to fixing this dish and ended up very disappointed.  I like the concept, but the final dish was mushy and extremely unappealing.

I left out the cranberry sauce and added 2 pkts of long grain and wild rice with the seasoning, turkey thigh meat cubed, bulk sausage, and green pepper. I cooked in also on high for 5 hours. Perfect! The stuffing at the bottom was dry but we threw that part out.

I tweaked this a little.  Instead of mushrooms, I added french cut green beans.  Based on other reviews, I moistened the stuffing, I used Cranberry Stovetop, poured some of the gravy & cream of mushroom soup over it.  I put it in a cast iron casserole dish and baked it, covered, in the oven at 350 for 2 hours.  Made sweet potato chips on the side. Yummy!

This was pretty good! I used 4 cups bread cubes since that was all I had, bumped the stuffing amount to 3/4 cups, and it turned out fine. Everything was moist and tasty. I omitted the mushrooms (husband hates 'em!), and next time I may try a layer of squash or zucchini between the chicken & topping just to get some extra veggies in.

I left the cranberry sauce out, and served it on the side. It was prefect, moist, delicious, and so easy to make. Everyone LOVED it. It will undoubtedly be a family favourite.

I tried this with a few tweeks myself. I'm not big on mushrooms or onion. So I left them out. Instead I used Onion powder and added some garlic salt along with the poultry seasonning. The next time I will add quartered red potatoes and corn on the bottom instead of bread crumbs to make it a more rounded meal. I even liked the cranberry sauce mixed in it! THIS WILL Become a winter staple in our house.

This was ok.  I don't know if I would make it again.  It was kind of mushy.

So, first thing - this recipe is as dry as the Sahara. Second, DO NOT PUT BREAD ON THE BOTTOM. This will burn, and as one poor soul had to do - might cause you to need a new slow cooker. Ouch! 

Fairly good recipe when modified, however. Looks weird, tastes amazing. I used two boxes of Stove Top, four jars of turkey gravy, and chicken. 

If you decide to do this recipe as written, great - just make sure to stir the bread crumbs up into the gravy mixture so they do not burn. I am planning on uploading pictures the next time I make it. 

Have fun, all!

This was good, reminds me of my moms turkey stuffing when I was younger.
The only thing was, I put an extra cup of broth in before leaving to prevent everything from burning but it backfired because I used frozen chicken and everything was very soupy. We still ate it and i just polished off the left overs. Also, I won't use cranberries next time, it was too sweet.

My family and I loved it. I used turkey breast fillets instead of chicken. I used two boxes of turkey flavored stuffing mix instead of the bread cubed and the stuffing mix(mainly because I couldn't find bread cubes). I will defiantly be making this again
