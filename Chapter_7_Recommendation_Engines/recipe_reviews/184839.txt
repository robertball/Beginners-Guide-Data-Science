I changed this recipe all up when I made it. Melted white chocolate chips, crisco, and cherry extract for the bottom layer on the baking sheet. Then I melted some semisweet chocolate chips with a little crisco for the top layer. For the topping, I crushed hard lifesaver cherry candies and lightly pressed them into the top of the semicooled chocolate. I left it in the freezer overnight and it turned out perfectly. =] Hope this helps.
