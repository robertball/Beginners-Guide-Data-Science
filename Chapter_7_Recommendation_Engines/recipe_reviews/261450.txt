My family loved these cookies.   We baked them for Christmas  Eve dessert.  We (my daughter and I) followed the recipe as written, although we needed to add an additional tbsp or two of milk because the dough was a bit too dry.  Dough was easy to roll and the right stiffness after refrigeration.   We used a drinking glass to make tops and bottoms of the cookies.  We used a small star shaped cookie cutter to make cut outs in cookie tops.   We baked cookies as stated.   We baked star shaped cut outs too.  After they cooled we spread Nutella on cookie bottoms and covered with cookie tops.  We added sprinkles to the star shaped cookies by brushing on a powdered sugar-water glaze to make the sprinkles stick to cookies.  My family loved these cookies!   Will definitely bake again.
