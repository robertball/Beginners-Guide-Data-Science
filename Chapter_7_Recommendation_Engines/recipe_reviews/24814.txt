Just like seafood salad should taste.  I used Medium seashell pasta.  Definitely double dressing and add 2nd half just before serving for a creamy salad.  (remember don't over cook pasta as it will absorb even more of dressing and make salad dry).

Great salad with or without crab meat. Used mediuam shells, added more celery, 1/2 red and green bell pepper and sliced olives. Used cider vinegar instead of the white and no milk at all with regular lite mayo. Decided with that much pasta would need more dressing, so added a cup of lite miracle whip. I like alot of spices, so added garlic powder, onion powder, a pinch of cumin, lots of paprika and pepper. Make sure the dressing is to your liking before adding to the pasta and vegs.  Keeps well in the frig for a few days and just keeps getting better and better! Delicious!

A good recipe overall. I found it to be a bit on the dry side, so I adjusted the dressing to suit my taste. It is definately a keeper. I think this salad would also be great with shrimp and maybe some sliced black olives and a bit of green onion.I will play with it.

The base was tasty. It needed a bit more spice for us. I added Old Bay, garlic & red onions with a bit of non fat sour cream to the mayo.

Made this the night before for lunch and it was very easy, tasty and quick! I omitted the celery because I didn't have any and I added a little more salt and pepper but other than that kept everything the same!

This was very tasty. I would double the dressing portion and wait until it has chilled for a while to see if more is needed. I threw mine out too soon and wished I hadn't. (The pasta absorbs alot of the moisture). Will make again!!

This is a very good pasta salad.  I particularly liked the dressing.  I made it exactly as directed and dont think I would change a thing.

Excellent salad!  I used fat free mayo and skim milk and it didn't effect the flavor at all.  I will make this again.

This has become a new family favorite!  I do add a little more mayo than is called for otherwise, it's perfect.  I think the vinegar gives it a wonderfully tasty twist.  Try it, you'll love it!

Simple to make and a great meal especially on hot summer days.  The creamy dressing is delicious.  I don't add the celery because I have some picky eaters who hate them so I subsititute the celery for green onions to add the color and more flavor.  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly and love the tang of the vinegar with the balance of sugar.  It tastes better than the salads the deli sells.

I've made this at least a dozen times and it's always a hit! Easy and delicious! I like to sprinkle some Old Bay seasoning on top for a little garnish and I use my food processor and pulse/chop the crab meat in to make it even faster and easier!

Very Good. I did not add the celery but used 1 teaspoon of celery salt in place of the celery and the 1 teaspoon of regular salt. I still enjoyed the celery flavor w/o the actual celery.

I used whipped salad dressing, no celery and no salt.  My mom always made this with tuna or canned shrimp in the summer for a cold lunch on a hot day.  She used less dressing and more milk.

Easy and yummy!  Made a bit more dressing as advised and used leftover crabmeat and shell macaroni instead.  Big hit at family reunion.  Will make it again...thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I tweaked it a bit by adding black olives, one green onion, and some capers.  I also added about 1/2 cup additional mayo because it was a bit dry. I could eat the entire recipe by myself!

The dressing is what makes this salad.  Really the dressing, pasta, celery and Krab are the core ingredients.  Then it's like a tossed salad - add the stuff you like.  I thought of the deli krab salad that is my favorite and added black olives cut in half, 1 each red and green pepper, diced, and cubes of mozerella cheese.  I left out the peas because I didn't think they went with the other ingredients. I also used white pasta because I like the color contrast with the veges.  This is the basic dressing I have been looking for to go in a pasta salad.  I will definately put this in my file and use again

It's all in the dressing,simple ingredients and wonderful taste.I did add a green onion and used tri color rotini pasta,thank you! I will keep this in my recipe box!

Coming back after putting in fridge to chill I found this rather dry.  I made a whole new batch of dressing and had to add it.  I did however use low-fat mayo and the dressing tastes just fine.  Guess I didn't save too many calories by adding a whole new batch of dressing.  Oh well.  My family liked it.

Great! I followed recipe and I found the dressing to be the perfect amount, if anything it may be to much. I would suggest following recipe first and adding more if you think it needs it.

Simply awesome!  I increased the dressing by half, since everyone else did.  I added shredded carrots and cubed avocado, since I had some to get rid of.  I also added Old Bay for no other reason than that I'm from Maryland :)  This is a really flexible salad, I don't think you can go wrong with it!

I tried this recipe because my local grocery store sell what they call key west crab pasta salad and my family loves it. I figured this was the same but it's not. We really didn't care for this all that much the first day I made it but it actually got better the next 2 days we ate it! I did make a few changes first I left out the peas but I did add broccoli instead and i also add a sweet onion chopped up. I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cidar vinegar. I also added a tiny bit of lemon jusice just for a little bit of citrus flavor. Im still not sure how the store makes thier "sauce" for their recipe but I guess I will stick to this recipe and just make it a day or 2 ahead of time!!

I made this for a potluck at work and it was excellent.  I also added red sweet pepper and green onions as I had them on hand and few dashes of red hot.  It is colorful and very tasty.

This recipe is just delish!!!! I'm sure it's the same seafood salad I had as a kid when we visited a restaurant in Baltimore. I had always wanted to have it again, and thanks to Linda, I now have it in my permanent recipe collection. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

Wow!  Just added some streamed shrimp and old bay seafood seasoning. Half salad dressing and half mayonnaise. I didn't have any celery and we hate green peas. Also used half & half instead of regular milk. I love it. I will make again. It taste really good.

This is a nice recipe, and very easy to make. Great for a picnic indeed, I added Old Bay seasoning to the mayo sauce.

Skipped the peas and added green onion and extra celery. Had to add extra dressing after chilling because I like it creamy but a great basic recipe that you can get creative with.

A relatively quick and easy recipe to put together, but it lack "zip".  Next time I will wait to add the dressing and might trying adding some chopped onion and a little hot sauce.  Thanks Linda!

I tried this on friends at a Labor Day weekend gathering. Everyone gave it a thumbs up!  If you're looking for a simply delicious recipe this one is worth a try.  The pasta and crab lovers in your crowd will love it.

I wanted to make something special for my daughter's bridal shower and this made it. Everyone loved it. I had made two different salads and this one did not come home with me.
Was very good.

Overall I loved this recipe! Although I used shell shaped noodles.  The dressing was what really made it great I think. My sister-in-law loved it so much I gave her my only printed copy, she tried her hand at it and my brother loves it, too.  I love celery now but I sure didn't when I was a kid, hence the lower kid-rating.

Any party or gathering I've had or went to has been accompanied by this particular seafood pasta dish.  I only use two stalks of celery now because I used to end up with all this extra diced celery.  These days I eyeball the ingredients and make the base sauce to taste.  I've omitted using milk whatsoever - and use veganaise instead of kraft mayo. Taste is still delicious! I like to whip the sugar/salt/pepper/vinegar/mayo ahead of time and chill it before mixing in the pasta/peas/celery/imitation crab.  

If in a rush - I'll boil pasta - make the sauce - and once pasta is done boiling - strain, rinse with cool water - mix in the frozen green peas and imitation crab before adding the sauce. That way everything tastes cooled down by the time it's ready to be served.

This didn't come out good for me at ALL. I did up the serving size to 12, but I followed the recipe to a tee so I'm not sure where I went wrong. Maybe it's just that I personally don't like the taste of it, but I definitely won't attempt it again!

I prepared this salad for over 50 guest at my daughters graduation celebration, I made it the night before and it was SPECULAR! I received so many compliments. The only thing that I did differently was add shrimp and I didn't use the peas. Again this is worth making.

Great dish to make ahead for potlucks, picnics, etc.! Instead of the dressing recipe, I used 3/4 c. mayo & 3/4 c. whipped dressing, garlic powder, celery salt, parika, dill weed, 2 tsp. sugar, & 3 Tbsp.milk (no vinegar). I didn't have frozen peas, so I added 1 onion, finely chopped. I will definitely be making this again.

I found this to be too bland.  I even added Old Bay, but perhaps I should have added more.  It did get eaten, but it wasn't anything I'll be thinking of again.

Really enjoyed this salad! I too added the olives, Old Bay Seasoning, and shredded cheese.  I also added coriander (cilantro) to it and the frozen shrimp that I had in the freezer! I use whole grain pasta as well. This was delicious and will definitely be making it again and again! Thanks!

This recipe is really good and tastes like the ones you buy at a supermarket. Like others have stated, the dressing makes this great. I did, however, leave out the green peas the second time I made it.

This is a great salad - one recommendation I have is to save most of the dressing for when you are ready to serve it.  I blended mine the night before, but it was a little dry when I served it.  Another reviewer was right - this would be good adding olives and green onions.  Thanks - I'll keep this recipe and make again with the added ingredients!

Awesome!  Most pasta come in 12 ounce packages, so be sure to adjust and make more dressing.  I added extra celery and peas.   I also added 1 small red onion, diced  into small pieces.  The added crunch and sweetness from the onions was great.   I think I will try adding bay shrimp next time.

I was asked to make a seafood salad and found this recipe. I don't care for imitation crab, but I know it is commonly used in seafood salad, so I figured the recipe would be fine. I don't care for lots of celery in salads, or large pieces, so I diced it quite small. Based on other reviews to add seasonings, I left out the black pepper because I don't care for it, but added a couple pinches of celery salt and paprika. I also adjusted the mayo at the end, as suggested, adding about another 1/3 of a cup or so.  I liked everything about the salad such as the: dressing, pasta, and peas. But, I couldn't get past the imitation crab in its flavor, texture, or aroma. Everyone who tried it though, seemed to really like it, and it all got eaten.  So, it might just be me that does not care for imitation crab meat? Because, I liked everything else about the salad, I might one day try this with cooked crawfish or chunk crab meat, which I like.

This is an excellent recipe.  I had been making seafood pasta salad using plain old mayo and thought it needed something.  So glad I found this recipe!  I followed it except I used seashell pasta and added a diced red pepper.  I also recommend starting with a good fake crab (did I just say that?  Yes, I did! I admit it, I love the stuff)  Not all immitation seafoods are alike - I highly recommend the bulk immitation crab they sell at Sam's club.

This is a great pasta salad.  I made a few changes because I don't like celery I substituted sliced cucumbers and julienned sweet peppers instead of using peas.  I also added cubed mozzarella because I am a cheese queen!

I make a very similar salad that's always a hit.  I mix italian dressing rather than the sugar/vinegar/milk combo to the mayo, and add chopped hard boiled eggs, sliced black olives, diced onions, and cubed cheddar cheese.  It's hearty enough for a main dish, or great as a side, especially with BBQ.

This is refreshing and delicious, just how seafood salad should taste. It goes together quickly, with minimal effort and makes a great lunch or light supper. Perfect for those warm days when you don't want to fuss in the kitchen. Here in FL, that's more often than not!

This was very good!  I added extra mayo, milk, salt and pepper, and I also added a pound of cut up shrimp.  I think this would be really good with some Old Bay, green onions and black olives for some extra flavor.

Simple and easy to prepare.  I used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Be sure refrigerate for a few hours or overnight...it's much better!

I prepared this salad becuase I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and didn't want to go to the store.........but to me, there is nothing "different" about this salad.  It is fine.....but nothing memorable.  I prefer foods that are more interesting.

I have to be the black sheep here and say that it was not a hit at my barbecue at all. My husband said it was really no good and I have to agree. I had the entire bowl left. I know its a matter of taste, but I will never make this again. Thank you for sharing though!!

best crab pasta salad I have ever had. Hubby loved it as well. Doubled sauce and used apple cider vinegar (all I had) used celery seed because hubby dislikes celery added 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder as well and used Mexican mayo because it was what I had.

I forgot the peas, which would have added color and another flavor nuance, but this is an excellent salad. Next time, I will increase the dressing, because the mixture becomes a bit dry with so many ingredients. I used crab meat and small shrimp, which made the recipe more of a true seafood salad rather than just crab salad. I highly recommend the recipe. This will become another staple in my salad recipe file.

Everyone loved this salad at our 4th of July party.  I used the shells instead of the spiral pasta rotini.  The dressing for the salad was the perfect amount.  It had great flavor.

Very good for a pasta salad.  I did substitue a pound of frozen salad shrimp for the  (because I already had the shrimp on hand).  I also added about a cup of halved grape-tomatoes.  I did think it needed some extra spices... I didn't have any Old Bay (as some reviewers added) so I added some celery salt, garlic powder & paprika and a splash of lemon juice.   Overall a yummy pasta salad I served for lunch, with crackers.

This is so.o.o.o good.  I thought there was plenty of dressing but I was prepared to double after reading the other reviews.  I omitted the celery (I didn't have any on hand), I added pimento stuffed olives (1 cup) and cherry tomatoes.  I also added lemon/pepper seasoning and onion flakes (about 2 tablespoons of each).  This is definitely a keeper!

I made this yesterday to take to a party today.  I asked my husband to taste test it for me.  He had to eat two bowls to test!  Thank goodness I doubled the recipe so I may have some left to share at the party.  I did add about 1/2 cup of sour creme I needed to use up.  Excellent recipe.

This was pretty good.  I used half salad shrimp and half real lump crabmeat.  I can't stand the imitation stuff...ewww, but this would be fine with just the shrimp and not so pricey.  It does need more dressing as others have stated and in my opinion also.   I noticed a few go for seconds but no one really said "Wow this is good".  I would probably make this again at some point.

We thoroughly enjoyed this salad. Basically made as is except I used 12 ounces of pasta and added a little more mayo. We enjoyed it as a side one night and as a light meal the next.

Ok so I made this for my husband, I am not a imitation crab kinda person but this is really good. I made a few adjustments I omitted the peas because he doesn't like them and added green onions. I added just a little more mayo and also added a touch of old bay seasoning. I will be making this again for him and myself and I will have some peas on the side for me!!

i really liked the dressing in this recipe as written. i used penne because that's what i had, and i didn't use celery because i would end up picking it out anyway (don't like it).
the whole thing was great, though next time i'll probably use less pasta and make more dressing to add after the salad's been in the fridge for a day or so.

Yummy, but I cut back the celery to 2 stalks for this amount of pasta and left out the peas altogether.  I've substituted light mayonnaise, 1% milk, and white wine vinegar with good results.

6/20 This recipe tastes as I expected. It is very good. I used 12 oz. pkg. crab, 8 oz. (3 c.) rotini pasta, and 2 stalks celery. However, I followed the advice of others and made the sauce recipe as originally written. Thanks.  7/9 With lt. mayo, skim milk, and aspartame this has 347 cal., 12g. fat, and 58 carbs per serving.

This was a quick and tasty pasta salad to make.  I added more noodles than the recipe called for because it looked like there was more crab than noodles when I stirred it all up.  Will definitely make again.

Loved this! It was a major hit at my sister’s graduation party. I added more milk to the dressing and used white vinegar, not apple cider like others have stated. ACV gives it a weird sweet taste. But I also used real crab meat over imitation and added Old Bay Seasoning.

Liked this dish a lot, but made a few changes.  I omitted the sugar and used spinach tortellini pasta.   Chilled overnight and the  next day had the dish with some crackers.

So good but of course I tweaked it for my family. Added chopped broccoli, green onion, bell pepper, extra celery and to combat the slight dryness about a half cup of ranch dressing along with recipe dressing.

This was GREAT!  The ONLY thing that I modified was I used 1.5 cups of miracle whip instead of 1 cup and I added a pinch of dill weed and I eyeballed the pepper instead of measuring it.  The recipe was perfect.  It was creamy and tangy sweet. I bet that it would be good with some cheese cubes as one person suggested.

I added a dash of onion powder, but that was the only update to a really easy, fast recipe. The dressing is delicious, smooth and tangy. Peas and celery are a perfect addition, but I could see this with hard cooked egg and chopped fresh dill as add-ins.

I made it with 1/2 cup of sugar instead. Didn't really care for it with sugar or peas. So I think next time I will try it without sugar and peas. That's why I gave it 3 stars.

As is, it really needs significantly more dressing and is a little bland, which is why I gave it 4 stars. But I added another cup of mayo and 2 cups of salad shrimp and eliminated the peas (hate them), and it was fabulous. I will be making this on a regular basis!

I have made this several times and my family and friends love it every time.  I do  double the dressing part of the recipe and add a little creole seasoning and a little sugar as well for my own personal preference but is delicious without my tweaks.

This was really good.  I used celery, black olives, onions, and cherry tomatoes.  Definitely double the dressing.  I put it in a bottle and added it to the salad as needed.

A very good recipe because it's flexible according to the maker's tastes. Some commenters complain it's too dry, but one should always remember when making a pasta salad SAVE  a half cup of your  boiled/salted pasta water to add make the cooled pasta moist before adding the dressing.

A good base recipe, but... 
I had to adjust it to give it more flavor.
-I used one box of tri-colored Pasta (I hate half boxes in my cabinet.)
- I lb of imitation crab
- no veggies( picky co-workers)
- 1 1/4 Cup Just Mayo  (I can't eat eggs, and this stuff is awesome, can't tell the differance)
- 3 Tb of milk
- 3 Tb of vinegar 
- 1 1/2 Tb of sugar
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1/2 tsp of pepper (sprinkled in a little more after.)
- 1 tsp of onion powder
-1/2 tsp celery salt

Tasted way better.

Really simple and tasty recipe.  I had purchased some imitation crab on sale and didn't know what to do with it!  This saved the day!the only thing I did differently was use shells instead of rotini and added some celery seed and garlic powder as I made the dressing (to suit our taste)!  It gets more flavorful by the day so

I tried this recipe for a family barbecue, and it was a major hit! I doubled the recipe, without issue - the only thing I would suggest is using 3/4 cup of mayo instead of 1 cup. I found that it was a little wetter then I would've liked. Could probably cut back on some of the peas too. Overall, it was definitely delicious, and I can't wait to have another party to attend, so I can make it again!

This was a spectacular salad. I loved it. Its light, its got a sweet flavor to it.  I had to replace the frozen peas with canned. It wasn't bad but the frozen ones are definitely better for this.   The next time I make this I think I will add a cup of sharp cheddar cheese shreds to it. That will offset the sweet and really set off the flavors.

Ok so I didn't change anything except to leave out the sugar and I was a bit confused by all the complaints of theirs being dry? I had read the reviews after I put it in the fridge and was prepared to make up another batch of dressing to go on it but didn't think it needed any. Perhaps I just didn't get my pasta cooked too much like someone mentioned, I did use medium shells instead of the spirals because it's what I had on hand and only cooked for 11 minutes. The dressing tends to all go to the bottom but just toss it a bit before eating and it's all down there. I was pleased with how it turned out. I did use ACV since it only said vinegar and that's what I usually put in my coleslaw. I will personally try adding some kick next time because I think it would be that much better, maybe some red pepper flakes or some type of extra seasoning.

Yes. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.
I also added cocktail shrimp, and 1 tsp. Of lime and 1 tsp. Of lemon juice.
If left the way this recipe was written, the outcome was dry, with little flavor.
The Miracle Whip helped enormously.
I also used Pininni pasta.

This is fantastic, quick and easy. I added a little more pepper and some Old Bay Lemon and Herb Seasoning and it was perfect. Definitely make a day ahead or with enough time for it to sit in the fridge for several hours. Perfect for picnics and potlucks.

Delicious!  I used balsamic vinegar because that is the vinegar I had on hand.  The dressing is similar to the one I use for coleslaw.  I am making it again tonight.

It was awesome. Used the recipe above as a base for what I wanted to make. I added a kick with old bay seasoning, added chopped tomatoes, purple onions, green peppers, small shrimp peeled and deviened, salad dressing along with regular mayo, and I was even going to add shredded mozzarella cheese if I didn't forget about it! Would have definitely added sliced black olives if I had any or even green olives if u enjoy those. It was delicious. Loved it. You can really make this you're way!

I've made this for years but used canned shrimp and added finely chopped vidalia onion.  It is still my son's favorite (most requested) side dish!

This salad is excellent.  I made it for a church function and my pastor and everyone else said it was delicious.  I made a few changes to it I added shrimp (medium size) along with the imitation crab and I used Coffee Mate instead of milk also I used Splenda in place of the sugar for diabetics no one knew the difference, and I also added less salt and I made it without peas. I made enough to serve 50 people along with the other dishes we had.  This event was for our Pastor and his Wife church anniversary.  Graceful Cook

I gave this recipe 4/5 stars because I found it a little bit dry and needed more mayo. I also omitted the peas and added a full package of precooked shrimp because I thought as a seafood salad, it should have more "seafood" in it than just the crab!

Since the taste was very bland, I added cilantro, finally chopped red onion, olives and used garlic salt

I personally did not like it at all but my family LOVED it! It was tasteless just using the ingredients the recipe called for so I added a creole seafood seasoning (I think it was Old Bay) that really added that seafood taste. My family asked me to make it again so I will :)
Thanks for the recipe!

First time i made this i seen someone elses variation using fresh orange juice and wasnt able to find that variation again....loved that recipe. The first time i didnt quite have enough mayo so i topped it off with about a quarter cup of tarter sauce and a good squirt of mustard for color, about 3 table spoons worth. It turned out great the added mustard gave enough liquid ingredients to coat everything generously. Plus the tarter sauce and mustard added a nice tang to the recipe. Im trying this again with the regular recipe but still substituting the tartersauce and mustard in and its turned out great as well. So far my top seafood salad recipe!!! Thank you

I thought this was good, although a bit bland as others have found.  I added about 1 tsp of Old Bay and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, but it needed more.  I did not double the dressing and did not find I needed to.  Used medium shells.  Quick, and I felt relatively healthy eating it!

Wonderful flavor. I don't care for peas or celery, so I cut those out and substituted sharp cheddar chunks and black olives. Big hit at work!

Made this last night to take for my lunch today. Great way to use up leftover buttered pasta and a package of crabmeat. Nothing to exciting though. I did forget to add the peas and I omitted the celery. Might make for a quick lunch again one day! Thanks

I left out the celery and added cubed carrots instead. The sauce wasn't as thick or creamy as I liked, but (since I was on a diet) it still worked out fine. Also, if you don't like the sour taste, use less of the vinegar. This was my lunch/dinner over the course of three days, and it kept pretty well in the fridge!

Very good.  I love the imitation crabmeat in this.  The original recipe's great but I think I'll try adding different veggies too.

Love this! Hubby's particular fave. I add lots of different raw veggies--peas, peppers, broccoli...whatever! I leave out the seafood and it's all veggie. Pastas can vary too.

I'm not a lover of mayo based salads, but this was good! Vinegar gives a nice kick. I did not feel the need to double "sauce" at all. Followed the recipe exactly for the exception of substituting broccoli for peas. (personal preference)

Good but plain.  After tasting it I added some cajun seasoning and a new spice mix in my spice rack called chef's essence... kinda like old bay maybe?  It tasted much better after doctoring it.

This salad did not have enough flavor and the mayonnaise was overpowering. Will not make again. Looks like most people love it though so don't let my comment stop you.

Tasted like tangy, tart deli pasta salad that almost hurt your tongue to eat.
