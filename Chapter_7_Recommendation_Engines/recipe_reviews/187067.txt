I made this for my son's 3rd birthday and it was a hit! The video was extremely helpful, but it became very clear that she used two cake mixes, not one as stated in the recipe. I'd strongly recommend using one cake for each loaf pan to make a taller train (like in the video) and it will feed more people of course.

if you follow the directions from the video it turns out great the only problem that i found is with the icing i used liquid food colouring and i found it to be really watery when i make this cake again instead of using  liquid food colouring i will use the gel other then the watery icing my son loved it!

I made this for my 6 yr old.  He and everyone else loved it.  I was an expert to all who say it. I just did as i saw, pretty much. I also saw that one cake mix would not cut it and made two and did the cabooze with a small bread pan and two larger loafs for the other cars.  Had fun.  I also agree about the liquidy of the icing when using food coloring. Thanks will do again.

I live in the Middle-East as an expat and we don't have cake decorators here like in the USA.  Therefore, we have had to start making our own B-Day cakes.  This cake was so simple that my 9 year old actually did most of it.  It turned out beautiful and my son absolutely loved it.  Didn't change the recipe at all!
