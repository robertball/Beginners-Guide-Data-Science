Smoked Sausage Casserole Haiku: "Okay, this was odd. Only made for one reason: had that chili sauce." So doing an ingredient search on AR for anything including Heinz Chili Sauce yielded this recipe that conveniently had other items that I typically have around, but why did I not actually think about that combination of ingredients before starting to put this together? I browned the sausage w/ the onions (prefer smoked sausage a little more "done") and wouldn't have wanted raw onion bites floating around a casserole, but followed everything else, although nothing seemed to improve what turned out to be the most peculiar, unappetizing casserole I think I've ever prepared. We picked at our plates, and tossed the leftovers. Sorry for the less-than-thrilled review but my husband was in a fit of giggles when I served this, it was just THAT weird.

This turned out better than I thought.  We did do a few things differently, like browning the sausage with the onion in a pan, then adding a little water and cooking the frozen peas and frozen corn before mixing with the chili sauce, cheese and seasonings to bake.  We made rice with the water from cooking the sausage/veggies and ate that with the casserole.
