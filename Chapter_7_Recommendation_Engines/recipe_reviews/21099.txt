This turned out better than I expected it to, although I think "jam" might be a little misleading because it doesn't congeal.  It wasn't hot at all, but did have a nice flavor.  I was thinking that if I made it again, I'd add a little less sugar and have it on hot dogs.  I would also probably pulse it in a food processor to cut it a little finer than I did.  This made a little over a pint for me.  I used four Roma tomatoes that I seeded.  It doesn't say to do that in the recipe, but I just figured you should.

I gave this a 5 star review because it really is a great recipe that I tweaked for my own purpose & you can only do that with a good recipe.  After reading the reviews I made a few changes following the outcomes of others.  I dropped the sugar by half, substituted peppers (1/4 jalapeno, 1/4 poblano, 1/4 serrano & 1/4 hungarian hots) & pureed the onion, tomato & apple before adding them so they became part of my liquid & the peppers really stood out.  I would call this a relish more than a jam.

I had some jalapeno peppers to use up from the garden and this was perfect. It had a great balance of heat and sweetness. I used it on some turkey and I can't wait to try it on other foods! Would even make a great gift
