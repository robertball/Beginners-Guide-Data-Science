I was looking for a coffeecake type recipe using blueberries to bring to Sunday Morning Coffe Hour at our Church and found Country Morning Cake.  I substituted fresh blueberries for the raisins and it turned out GREAT!  I received many compliments and was asked twice for the recipe.  Be aware though that the dough is more like a sugar cookie rather than a cake batter.  Don't let this bother you it was very moist.  Even my kids liked it and asked if I could make another one tomorrow!

End result was good, but was very nervous during prep.  Batter was very thick, and hard to spread.   Also, tried to use 9 inch pan--will use 8 inch next time.  9 inch pan was so big that I only made one layer of the cake...

Loved this, loved this, loved this!!!  I omitted the raisins and added some chopped walnuts to the topping.  Yummy.  It is very moist and got rave reviews.  Definitely a keeper.

I really didn't like the raisins, so I substituted sliced peaches and raspberries. My family really liked it.

So easy and really good!!  I made it with chocolate chips instead of raisins (I didn't have any) and it was GREAT!  I've made it three times in 2 days because everyone loves it!!

This was easy and OK, but honestly, there are other coffee cakes that I like better.  I baked this in an 8" spring form pan, there didn't seem to be much batter, and as a result, the cake didn't have much height.  I did have a few cherry craisins left, so I mixed them in with the raisins.  If I were to make this again, I think I'd double the recipe (but probably not the sugar topping and the raisins) and cook it in a 9" spring form pan just to get more "cake."

Made this yesterday and it is all gone-the only change I made was to use 1/3 c of mini chocolate chips instead of raisins. This recipe fits in an 8 inch round pan, but just barely.

It went together quickly, but this batter was very thick and sticky.  Nearly impossible to "spread" over a floured pan. Also wouldn't spread over the sugared middle layer--had to drop dollops onto middle layer and call it good. If I ever made it again, I'd add a little milk to thin the batter down a little. Really hard to tell when it was done too, because the sugar topping forms a crisp, crusty layer that pretty much cleans off the toothpick as you pull it out. I kept it in for an extra 5 minutes, and it was still gooey in the middle. Tasted OK, but I really don't get what all the raves are about. I've tried lots of better coffee cake recipes.

I doubled this recipe and made one without raisins for my picky friends. It was just ok, nothing special and I hate to admit it, but I preferred the raisin-less one.  The cake part was kind of tasteless. Others said it was good but seemed to be lacking something.

** Hey I just noticed that is said to put half the sugar mixture over the raisins then spread the remaining batter over the top.  It never says that the other half of the brown sugar mixture should go on top of the second batter layer.  Might have been better this way.

This recipe was great!!  We went ahead with the raisins and not being much of a raisin family, it still came out well.  My family loved it.  I'm not exactly sure how the recipe came out thick or dry for some people.  The batter was very creamy and spread on easily. After it came out it was light and moist!  Very good - I plan on making another batch (it was super easy to whip up) to bring to a friend.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was "okay". I prefer my recipe that has more sour cream and butter and is way more moist!  Nevertheless, it was a treat for my husband and kids on a school morning.

5.20.19 ... .https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25352/country-morning-cake/ ...  Odd looking in that the topping made a thin, crunchy crust above the cake; when cut, cracked like glass(?).  I used an 8x8, which, yes, is smaller than an 8" round; but yow, thick batter & not really enough of it.   Good, not great.

Made this tonight and it came out perfect! I followed all directions, the only omission I had was the raisins, Husband don't care for them. I didnt have to use all the sugar topping I saved that for another time. The cake was moist and very tasty, we loved it. I definitely will make this again,my husband would'nt stop eating it!

I absolutely love this recipe as does my family and coworkers that I've made it for.  Since the first time I made it I kick it up a notch by adding blueberries and pecans to the middle layer as well as the cinnamon sugar mixture.    This recipe is exactly what I needed.  It's pretty  quick to make.   My husband has asked me to make it pretty frequently.  I've made it about 5 times in the last few weeks! ??

Original recipe tastes wonderful although I agree with others there does not seem to be enough batter. I double the batter, add pecan pieces to the cinnamon sugar layer and soak the rasins in spiced rum the night before. I also add 1 tsp almond extract to the batter. Absolutely yummy!

I made this for a brunch with my girlfriends. Everyone loved it. So did my husband and two girls. My raisins were a bit dry so I soaked them in some vanilla. For our next brunch they want me to make one with raisins and one with nuts. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so simple yet great. I left out the raisins because I do not like them, but it was still great without them. I will use this recipe again and next time I will make 2 one with raisins and one without.

It was okay, not fabulous.  A little dry.  I probably won't bother again.

I can see this cake becoming a good standby for me. As it uses ingredients I always have in. The only change I made was to use plain yoghurt instead of sour cream. It's definitely at it's best when warm. Many Thanks.

This is an ABSOLUTE 5 out of 5 for me !!!!  It was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did differently was I used an 8 inch square pan and I used walnuts and not raisins.  I am going to make it again tonight.  We all loved it !!!  Great with a cup of tea or coffee.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I too took the advice of previous reviewers and used mixed berries instead of raisins.  Blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries! But it was fabulous!
But be warned, it doesn't make very much.

I will make this again, and I will make a double batch. The only thing I did differently was to use yogurt cheese instead of sour cream. The cake was moist and not too crumbly, with a light crustiness on top. The filling was just gooey enough. I did have difficulty spreading the batter, just used my fingers to spread the top layer almost to the edges. Would be nice to have a bit more batter. We ate it warm from the oven, and it was gone in 15 minutes. My kids love it, which is an accomplishment. This is a keeper, not the traditional boring coffee cake!

This is a really good cake. I originally made it to use up some sour cream and raisins I had left over from other things but have made it 3 times since then because my family keeps requesting it. I found the raisins to be a good addition. They really add to the flavor.
