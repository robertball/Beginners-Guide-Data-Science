Will make again.  From my husband, "mommy's brisket is good!" It was delicious - even without the pinneaples (I didn't have any on hand).

Excellent flavor! I only had a 1.5 lb brisket so I quartered the recipe (and also omitted the pineapple). But I used the baking directions from the "Easy Bake Brisket" recipe because it seemed easier. I would highly recommend this ingredient combination though!

I found this recipe when searching for something to do with a brisket I had. My family loved!!! We now make it for every special occasion and big get together. Would definitely say give it a try. My dad even likes it and he doesn't care for brisket.

Definitely deserves the 5 star rating!  So juicy, so tender, so easy and loaded with flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, omitting the pineapple because I didn't have any on hand but it didn't hinder the flavor at all.  I will make this again and again.

BRISKET SHOWDOWN!  

Nana Lara's Brisket vs. Wine-Braised Beef Brisket (both 5 star ratings but which did we like better?)


Used the cooking method from this recipe for both briskets.  Both were tender.  Flavor wise - Nana Lara's is the winner in our family.  The rub makes a huge difference which encrusts the brisket. The soy/pineapple combo brings a yummy flavor.

Didn't have  meat tenderizer,  instead added 1 Tbsp McCormick Season-All & 1 Tbsp Goya Adobo; increased brown sugar (light) to 1-1/2 Tbsp - all on a 5# fresh brisket.  Also- crushed pineapple used was a 20 oz. can.  After the 1 hr @ 350, I reduced heat to 275 for 3-1/2 hrs.   OMG - sooooo tender & delicious.!!

This was amazing. Flavor was incredible. Simple and delicious. Will maybe try in a crock pot to save on time.

Awesome. If you don't like heat then hold off to half tablespoon. But very tender and the best brisket I EVER made.

I just didn’t find this recipe to be very good.  I used grass-fed and finished brisket and followed the recipe.  It was just ok.  I was thinking maybe it’s because I am from Texas and maybe I just think of brisket as needing smoke, but no, it just wasn’t amazing.

This was fantastic!!! I changed a bunch of stuff, royally messed it up, and even with all my mistakes it still turned out awesome. I used a rib eye roast, I didn't have onion powder so I doubled the garlic powder, I didn't have meat tenderizer so I used a tbsp of salt, I didn't have canned pineapple so I used fresh pineapple, and then to top it off I cooked it waaaay too long. STILL AWESOME. Can't go wrong with this recipe, or even your own random interpretation of this recipe.

Huge hit. I left the meat tenderizer out and cooked it on a rack on a roasting pan at 300 degrees for the entire time. It was excellent! I did not know brisket was this easy!

I prepared it as instructed except for the fact that I used the ancho chili powder I had since I did not have any regular chili powder. It was a huge hit. My wife even high fived me after I made it.
