These were really cute and tasty. A big hit at a party.  I followed the suggestion to use  chives to tie the broom and they worked well.  I will make it for my next Halloween party.

Super cute and one that would be perfect for a Halloween party. I found that the spinach tore too easily and ended up using chives instead. They worked nicely and  gave the cheese and pretzel combo an extra pop in flavor. It is March so this was just a trail run but I will be making these for office parties come October!

These were so good, I used green onion strips instead of spinach.  I served them with a hot and spicy honey mustard dip!  They were a huge hit at our work Halloween party!

I made these for my grandkids. They really liked it. I left off the spinach as some of my grandkids would not have eaten it with green on it, but it was a hit anyway.
