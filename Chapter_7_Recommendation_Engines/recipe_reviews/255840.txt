These were amazing! I didn't think I would like these as well as a battered fried chicken but I sure did. They puff up so much that they look like a piece of battered fried chicken when they come out of the oil. You can definitely taste the lemon but it makes it super moist too. Excellent recipe!

My in laws are Haitian. This does not taste like anything my husband's mother or aunts make. That said, the seasonings are off. The lemon juice overpowered the taste of the chicken as did the allspice. The chicken was edible but not good enough to want to reach for seconds.  I won't be making this again.

Very flavorful and is a nice change from breaded chicken. My boyfriend is from Nigeria and loved the spice mixture. I served with rice and beans, it was a perfect savory meal. The recipes says to marinate the chicken for 12 hours, I ended up just marinating them for a couple hours and they were still good. Great recipe!
