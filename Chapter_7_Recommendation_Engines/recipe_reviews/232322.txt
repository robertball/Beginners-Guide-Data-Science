Nice soup!  I omitted the oil and put everything in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  I also added some cabbage that I needed to use.  Very comforting on a chilly day!  Thanks for the recipe, eandbtaylor!

This is a great way to use vegetables you may have in your home. It is so flavorful:) Yummy! I also used leftover roast so that worked wonderfully.

We cannot stop raving about this soup. It is so good I am actually writing my first all recipes review for it. We made this with some very minor changes: I am very finicky about tomatoes so I excluded the stewed tomatoes (did keep tomato sauce though) and instead of beef bouillon granules I used a product called "Better than Bouillon" that is more like a paste. Browned the beef as instructed and kept all the lovely browning bits in the soup by pouring in the beef stock and stirring quickly to deglaze the pan. All other instructions followed per recipe. Thank you for this delicious recipe!!

Thank you eandbtaylor, for this recipe. This is the first homemade veg soup that I like. I did omit the tomato sauce and the canned diced tomato, it was still very tasty. I ate two bowls and my husband ate three  bowls for dinner.  Next time I make this I might try it with the tomato sauce.
