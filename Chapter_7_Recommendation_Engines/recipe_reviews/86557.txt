I needed beet juice for my pickled eggs and I had no clue what I was going to do with all the left over beets - now there's no doubt in my mind what will happen to them from here on out!  My husband and mother couldn't wait for this salad to get really cold before chowing down. I didn't have any canned peas so I used frozen (thawed and drained) and we loved it!  I'll bet it's even better with the canned.  Thanks for sharing!

Great salad idea! Whodda thunk? I ended up using what I had on hand + added 1 ingedient: Dill. (I wondered where the "dill" in the name of the recipe was) My subs were: Equal parts of sour cream & mayo, mixed & 2+ teaspoons dried dill. (I also added 2 extra Tbs onions- I used fresh, sweet Vidalias.) Even the Skeptics liked this one! Cold is key! JEMD- Thanks for submitting & thank your M-I-L!

What?  No 10 stars?  I love both beets and peas.  I added the onion for the crunch effect (love onions too!).  This is wonderful!  I have to admit I cheated and took a taste before it was really, really cold.  Better when fully chilled.  Simple, yet tasty.  The only thing I would recommend is to quarter the beets due to size before adding.

I wasn't sure about this at first, but this is really good and refreshing! I agree with those who said to use less mayo, I took that advice and it was perfect that way :)

Rather bland, but this tastes good.  We love peas, beets, and onions, so the combination was a winner.  I'll use less Miracle Whip next time, though!

Sounds strange, looks strange, tastes great!  Needs less dressing added, in my opinion - will try a 1/4 cup next time.

I don't know why this is amazing - but it is. Five months pregnant and I ate the whole bowl myself, ice cold from the fridge :) made to exact recipe specifications aside from subbing (very very well rinsed) pickled beets. Gave an extra vinegary flavor that I loved. Miracle Whip was perfect. THANK YOU!

simple and delicious...but the dill wasn't listed in the recipe so I just added "to taste"...I will make this again.

This was incredibly easy and so flavorful. I made it exactly as written except I used pickled beets and regular mayonnaise instead of miracle whip.  I will make this again and again. Love it.

I've also made this with blue cheese dressing instead of plain creamy salad dressing/mayo.  It's an excellent variation!  (Ranch also works well.)

This was very easy to make for a large crowd. I tripled the recipe. Was very different and combined well with other salads at the potluck. Will try adding a bit of balsamic vinegar next time for a bolder taste.
