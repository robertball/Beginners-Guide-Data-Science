This salad is absolutely delicious! I took it to a potluck and it was a big hit. Served cold, like a potato salad. (It would help to have an approx. banana cook time. I did 20-25 minutes, I was worried it was too much, but I cooled them completely in the refrigerator and they firmed up.)
Everyone should be adventurous and try this. It's great!
Thanks!

I followed the instructions as written, but I did not care for this recipe.

If you are up for something different that blends several unqiue flavors quite well, give this salad a try! So good! 20 minutes worked for my fairly unripe bananas (kind of hard to find perfectly green ones), but make sure they cool all the way before mixing everything together or they can get mushy. When I make it again, I think I will cut the green peppers into chunks instead of rings and put a little more sugar in - the recipe calls for 1 teaspooon, but I would use 2 next time because the vinegar is so tangy. I also used real crabmeat, and next time I think I would use artificial because the subtle taste of the real thing got lost in all of the other flavors. Just some thoughts on how I might adjust it - but I would definitely make it again! Delicious and perfect for summer!! Thanks!

This was fabulous! I served it for 100+ at my workplace for "International Day". They loved it and were so surprised that it was BANANAS not potatoes :) It's rapidly become one of my favorite dishes at home and now in my menu rotations :) I take the crab out for myself due to an allergy, but substitute it with scallops. MMMMMmmmm!
