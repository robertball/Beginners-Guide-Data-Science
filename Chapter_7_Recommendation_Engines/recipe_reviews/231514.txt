So...I went a little rogue on this recipe.  I did the peppers as instructed,  but then I sautéed the beans, onions, cumin, actual garlic (3 cloves), a serrano pepper and got those flavors married while the (brown) rice was cooking.  I took off the bean mixture after 10 min or so/when the onions were translucent, added some frozen corn and some shredded cheese (habanero cheddar) and waited on the rice.  Had a beer.  Waited on the rice to finish  Mixed it all up, topped it with the cheese and threw it in the oven.  DELICIOUS

SOOO good!!! I did as another reviewer suggested and baked the green bell peppers (I used 8 peppers) for 10 minutes at 250 instead of boiling, as I didn't want them to lose their flavor. They were still pretty crunchy, so I wouldn't go that way if you want softer peppers, but I liked them just fine - and they still had that lovely bell pepper taste. I also used quinoa instead of rice - DEFINITELY the way to go. The texture was wonderful. I also followed a different reviewer's suggestion to improve the flavor profile by sautéing the onion with fresh garlic (always use fresh!!) for 10ish minutes, then adding the beans, cumin, and chili powder for another 10 min of sautéing, then setting aside until the quinoa was finished. Tossed those together with the tomatoes and cheese, and stuffed them into the peppers. The stuffing is DELICIOUS.

Great recipe overall. Healthy and delightful - and, even better, looks really pretty and fancy for dinner guests. Will definitely make again.

This was great! I added quorn grounds that I sauteed with the onion and some South African smoke seasoning blend because I have to pacify my husband with faux meat on vegetarian nights but otherwise made the recipe as written and we both loved it. I had small bell peppers so there was a lot of filling left over so I used to rest of the filling to make "enchiladas" (wrapped the filling in tortillas, sprinkled cheese over the top, and baked them in the oven) and it was delicious that way as well.

Tasty and Easy!  I made a few of substitutions, but stuck with the same basic recipe.  1) Instead of boiling, after cutting the peppers, I put them in the toaster oven on 'bake' at 250ish degrees for 10 minutes.  They turned out so perfect. 2) I didn't have chili-style tomatoes, so I diced up some cherry tomatoes and added a little salsa 3) instead of garlic salt, used granulated garlic and added a little extra salt 4) used Yellow peppers which gave a wonderful sweet taste.  I don't really like green peppers so this was a great substitution.  5) instead of rice, used Quinoa for extra protein.  Some of the quinoa actually tasted like ground beef after baking.  My Husband was impressed with this recipe and I've tried several other stuffed pepper recipes where he would shrug and say "it's, okay" but this was he said, "Wow, this is actually good!"  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definitely do again!

I made it as written the first time I made it. It was good, but as the other reviewers said, the peppers were a little bland and the rice mixture was too dry. So next time, instead of boiling the peppers, I cut them in half lengthwise, brushed them with olive oil, and roasted on a cookie sheet, open side down, at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Then for the stuffing I used cooked brown rice instead of white, increased the chili powder to 2 teaspoons, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and mixed half of an 8-oz can of tomato sauce into the rice mixture. I stuffed the halved peppers with the rice mixture and put about a teaspoon of the remaining tomato sauce on each one before topping with the shredded Mexican cheese.  SOOO good!

My husband and I recently started eating almost exclusively vegetarian meals, and this was first on our list. It was very good. We love spicy, but the kids wouldn't eat it, because the Mexican cheese I added also had peppers in it. Otherwise I followed the directions (except I used red peppers) and it was delicious. My husband said we should use the filling to make burritos so we are going to try those next. We will make this again for sure.

Excellent base recipe.  Have made it as is, and great, but have also used it without the beans (try to reduce the protein due to kidney problems), and have also added corn, used homemade salsa instead of tomatoes, added jalapenos, and added toasted walnuts for crunch. All versions are good. My husband likes the peppers more cooked so if you don't like them crunchy, boil longer, use thinner skinned peppers, or bake much longer.  Overall a definite keeper.

I went way off script, but it came out absolutely amazing. Started by cutting the tops off 6 fresh red bell peppers. Cut out the guts and diced the red part of the tops. Set the bottoms aside. Sautéed the diced red parts with ~1.5 cups of diced onion (pre-diced from Kroger- I refuse to cut onions) in olive oil. Added my spices here- eyeballed quantities of chopped garlic, garlic salt, lemon pepper seasoning (Kroger brand), cumin, and chili powder. Added 1 lb of lean ground beef to the pot and cooked thoroughly. Plot twist: then I added 2 cups of water and a box of Zataran's dirty rice mix to the same pot with the meat and veggies still in it. Followed the cooking directions on the box. Removed from heat and mixed in the (drained, not rinsed) can of black beans and (drained, not rinsed) can of diced tomatoes. Added 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese. Mix mix mix. Tasted to check spice levels. Died and went to heaven. Filled my bell pepper bottoms with the mixture and topped with a pinch of extra cheese. Baked the stuffed peppers on a foil-covered cookie sheet for 30 minutes at 350F. I ended up with way more filling than I needed for 6 peppers, but I will either freeze it for future peppers or serve it another way. It's so good I could eat it with a spoon.

Made it just as directed (as everyone should if they are rating a recipe!) and it was absolutely delicious and divine!! This is a saver, and I think I found my new stuffed pepper recipe! As a vegetarian, I truly enjoyed these marvelous stuffed peppers. Thank you for sharing!

I made this but added  3 cloves real garlic, hot chilies instead of green chilies. I used brown rice and pigeon peas. I used 2 tsp chili powder too. They were just fabulous!!

Pretty good. The rice mixture is very flavorful and could stand alone. The green bell pepper bowl was virtually flavorless as the stuffing infused little or no flavor into the bell peppers and blanching them in boiling salt water is not intended to enhance the flavor although softens them a bit. For us, doing this again would require a change or changes to the bell pepper portion of this recipe. Yellow, orange or red bell peppers would be sweeter and more flavorful. Smoke-roasted stuffed bell peppers using a Big Green Egg or other smoker/grill would elevate the overall flavor profile of this dish. Thank you donnam for sharing this recipe.

This was a great side for us. Chili style tomatoes are hard for us to  find so we just used a can of stewed tomatoes, 28oz liq. And added more cumin. Also substituted real garlic for the garlic salt as we try to use as little salt as possible. Also tend not to buy pre-shredded cheese so did our own and it was fine.  This was a good change to our regular boring veggie sides. Thanks for a great veggie recipe!

Wow-LOve it--spicey good! As a Catholic, it's so nice to find a veggie meal for Fridays that is anything but boring.  My family loves this.  I added a can of corn and fresh cilantro as someone suggested.  Perfecto! I made Zatarain's Spanish rice , adding a can of spicey diced tomatoes & green chilies when I mixed it up.  YUM. Next time I want to try adding fresh garlic to the onions as they
 cook & chop up some cleaned-out fried or grilled poblanos. Jalapeno Jack & cheddar cheese were the perfect topping. I also love that I can add as much as I want to the mixture to easily stretch it for a party.

I seriously loved this dish! I did do a few things differently however; I didn't just use green peppers, I used red, orange, and yellow also! Because I was sort of lacking in the spice department I used only salt, garlic salt, pepper, and Tabasco sauce. I also wanted to cut back on salt just a little bit, so I used unsalted, or plain if you will, diced tomatoes! I didn't use a Mexican cheese mix, I used feta because it's on the healthier end of the cheese spectrum. So I had the feta throughout the mixture, with a little bit of crumbled feta on top! :) I am in love with this recipe and I'm for sure going to make it again!

These were AMAZING!!! My husband requested I make it a regular menu item for our household. My 11 yr old who is picky liked it a lot as well and my 2 yr old loved eating the filling alone. Made the recipe without any changes, as should always be done when you're reviewing a recipe. Thanks so much!

This was very good! Very easy, relatively cheap, and very delicious. The only issue I had was one pepper was definitely not enough to fill me up. I think this would make a perfect side dish, or maybe fill it with ground beef (unless you are vegetarian). Also, add jalopenos. Either way, great dish! Strongly suggest it!

The flavor was good but the stuffing came out a little dry. Next time I'll be adding a can of tomato soup and maybe some corn.

I liked it, was looking for a recipe without ground meat or vegetarian crumbles and this hit the spot. Used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and fire roasted tomatoes, which I put in food processor. Used pepper jack cheese, it had a good kick but not over the top spicy. Also skipped precooking peppers because I like a little crunch. Will make this again.

In a recipe twist that will undoubtedly earn me a cussing from the author, I modified this recipe by adding...meat. And reducing the cheese. And a generous topping of salsa, because of the comment that it was dry (it looked dry going in, and we love salsa). And to boot? I didn't boil the peppers, just trimmed them so they'd sit straight and cut jack-o-lantern faces into them. So pretty much I made a million changes -- a great recipe nonetheless!

Overall, I was satisfied with this meal. Taking advice of others who commented, I sauteed my onions along with beans, minced garlic cloves (to replace garlic salt), serrano peppers, and chopped green pepper pieces (from the tops of the bell peppers). I think those additions and sauteeing it all together helped add some great flavor to the dish. I'm not a vegetarian so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the peppers ended up with a great flavor and enough spice, as well as a nice texture from the black beans. The only thing that threw me off a bit was how much filling I ended up with. I bought 4 bell peppers as the recipe says, but I had enough filling for probably 7 to 8 peppers. If I made this again, I would be sure to have more bell peppers ready.

I've made this several times (and it's for dinner tonight!),  with changes to make it Vegan.  
(1.)  While rice is ok, I make this with quinoa. Nuttier flavor, lighter and more protein.  Using "Rainbow" or mixed quinoa colors is gorgeous.
(2.) I use Daiya Vegan cheese substitute, blending their shredded cheddar and mozzarella products.
(3.)  I zip it up with some Soyrizo (Vegan), scrambled up, adding it to the sauteing onions after a bit. (I also add a little minced fresh garlic to the pan too.)  
(4.) For more zip (not necessarily a Vegan thing), I substitute some of the chili powder with ground chipotle chili pepper for a smokier taste.  Combined, I do add a bit more chili powder  and more cumin powder above what the recipe calls for.
(5.)  I dice up one chipotle pepper (canned, in adobo sauce), 
adding it with the wet ingredients in the stuffing,  spooning in some of the smoky adobo sauce with it.  Those can add a lot of heat, so I keep it to the single chipotle.
(6.)  Finally, because this makes more stuffing than you can get into a whole pepper, I cut the peppers in half, down the middle, as if on the half shell, piling up the stuffing.  Make the stuffing just a  bit moister with some vegetable broth, to prevent drying out in the oven.
(6.) Using two red and two green bell peppers, cut in half, let's you serve a half of each color for a more festive plate.

---
As I have for tonight, taking it on a road trip,  the stuffing can be made ahead and kept chilled, so all  that

Wow. I made this today to use up some leftover rice and peppers that needed to go and loved it. I used red, yellow and orange peppers instead of green. I also used 2 cups cooked ,dried beans as I didn't have any canned. I hardly had any cheese so used a combo of cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan cause its what I had. Also used 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (just because I hate not using the whole can) and added a few pieces of chopped pickled jalapeno.  Followed the recipe for everything else and the result was amazing (even reheated in microwave later). The filling makes enough for 6-8 peppers though.

Before adding the rice mixture to the peppers, I spread cream cheese along the walls of the pepper. It is the best and makes an otherwise normal rice and pepper dish SO so good. 

cream cheese. 
do it.

Definitely a keeper.  Made it with cauliflower rice instead of rice(I'm on a low carb diet) and didn't have any canned diced tomato so I diced a tomato and used a half can of commercial tomato sauce. Terrific! It even made the cauliflower rice taste good.

I found 2 cups of rice to be way too much for only 4 bell peppers. 1 cup would have been plenty with all the added vegetables. Recipe tasted great though!

Great recipe - but I start with the "best-spanish-rice" recipe from this site (using vegetable broth instead of chicken) and add the beans to the rice before filling the peppers. Feeding both vegetarians and meat-eaters, I can adapt by dividing the rice mixture and adding meat as desired.

This was great! I was looking for a vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe where the prep work wouldn't take me forever. Followed the recipe except I poured enchilada sauce over the finished peppers. YUMMY!!!! Will be making again!

This was a 10 for us.   My husband usually gives my vegetarian meals a rating of 8 and tells me adding bacon would make them a 10, but this one he loved as is.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great, although we definitely do recommend serving with a dollop (or 3) of sour cream

This was so good! I added corn, peas, cooked onions, and garlic! I used red kidney beans instead of black and mixed in some Soy Chorizo into rice..topped it off with a generous amount of cheese and coated the bottom of pan with stewed tomatoes and topped peppers with tomato sauce.
Thanks for the tip on blanching the peppers - it makes such a difference! SO GOOD!

I tweaked it a little... I used yellow peppers instead of red, and while prepping those I baked for 10 minutes at 325 instead of boiling. Instead of mixing in white rice, I added Mexican rice which I bought pre-made at the store. At the end of preparation where it says to sprinkle Mexican Blend shredded cheese on top, I dolloped a big spoonful of queso fresco/blanco to finish it off before baking. When it was done and ready to eat, I sprinkled ground pepper on top of the queso fresco. It was to die for! Next time I make this, I will repeat what I did, but probably add in some corn as well. This was the first time in the entirety of my marriage that my husband was VERY impressed with one of my dishes. (he's always been the MUCH better cook LOL.) so I'm really happy I could rock his world with this.

Very taste!! Only changes I made was that I used orange peppers, minced garlic and sharp cheddar cheese. I nice change for our vegetarian diet. My son didn't like the pepper part of it, made a burrito out of the leftover "stuffing".

(Vegan version.) Delicious, though I did make changes. I used a whole large brown onion, and used half green and half red bell peppers (capsicums to Aussies). Rather than using cheese, I used half a cup of Bragg's Premium Nutritional Yeast (which sounds awful but tastes great and is a good vegan replacement for cheese in recipes; it's also very healthy). Also, rather than adding chili powder, I used a tablespoon of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added a teaspoon of smoked paprika in the final mix. Before putting the stuffed peppers in the oven, I sprinkled about a quarter cup of chopped pecans over them. The dish was much lighter than it would have been with cheese and reduced the calories to 375 per serve (from 500+).

My roommate and I love this!
The only changes we made: cooked basmati rice in organic chicken broth( diluted a little with water), used a whole onion instead of half, added tofu sausage (Tofurky Italian sausage). We sautéed the tomatoes, onions, sausage , black beans and seasoning together. We also put a little Matouk's hot pepper sauce on the peppers after they were baked.

I used 8 ounces of pepper jack cheese for the filling.  I added a lot of cilantro.  I added 1 can of green chili tomatoes and chopped of bunch of vine ripe tomatoes.  I cooked real garlic with the onions and did not use garlic salt.  I also had a bunch of other mexicain spices I used instead.  I topped it with cheddar cheese.

Good start to a recipe but needed to be upgraded a little. I added a jalapeño and 1 tsp of taco seasoning in addition to all the listed spices. I also added the tops of the peppers (diced) in with the onions and jalapeño. Then I combined everything into the pan and let them heat up together not in a bowl like the recipe recommended.

I will admit that I took the advice from a few previous posters...roasting the peppers in the oven (350 for 15 mins), sautéing a poblano pepper with the onion and I added some Pacific brand tomato and roasted pepper soup to the mix and to the top of each pepper prior to adding cheese and baking. I'm sure this recipe is great without those additions - with with them it was phenomenal! (Side note - this also makes an absolutely amazing filling for enchiladas!)

I'm not very good at following recipes but this is a great starting point.  I forgot to buy beans but substituted about 1/2 lb. of ground turkey.  I also didn't add corn which I'll definitely do next time and would certainly do if I skipped the turkey.  I used brown rice and might have used a little less than the recipe calls for.  I used 6 medium peppers and cut the meat from around the stems after I cut them off and sautéed this with the onions and turkey.  This recipe calls for too much salt for us and I only used a few dashes of soy sauce when I boiled the peppers and substituted a 1/2 tsp(+\-) of garlic powder.  I did the filling in a frying pan, sautéing the spices (with the addition of some lemon pepper), then the onion, garlic powder and turkey, then a can of Rotel tomatoes with its juice and a little oregano, finishing with the rice and cheese.  I added a few tsp of water to the bottom of the baking dish and covered with foil.  Garnished the tops with a little extra cheese before baking.  Not too dry.  Good.

Very good recipe. Like some others have said mine came out a little dry. I think I will add some tomato sauce or salsa next time. I used cauliflower rice so maybe that had something to do with it but probably not. I will definitely be making this again.

Very flavorful! This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms, but it won't be my last. I used couscous in place of the rice and added fresh garlic, but other than that, no other changes were needed. They were delicious. Thanks for an easy tasty recipe.

I didn't have the chili style style stewed tomatoes, so I used organic 'roasted' stewed tomatoes and I added about 1/2 cup frozen corn to mine and it was awesome! Even my husband who is a meat-a-sorus loved them.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I added corn.  As the peppers were baking, I was eating the extra stuffing with a fork.  As other reviewers suggested, we will be using the extra stuffing in burritos.  We will add this to our regular rotation for sure.

I just tried this recipe tonight and I made SEVERAL changes to the original receipe and it turned out waaaay better than I had expected!! Firstly, I've never made rice from scratch so I used Uncle Ben's Basmatic Minute rice. It comes up to about 2 cups. Next, I sauteed 1 1/2 onions with 2 cloves of garlic. I blended some tomatoes with onions, ginger, scotch bonnet and garlic (I love garlic!) I boiled the peppers, but I didn't like the texture they turned softer than I would have liked. I used only Montreal Steak spice to season the rice as I don't use salt in my cooking. I stuffed the peppers as usual. I really liked the rice, it was totally unexpected how good it tasted! I now need to make a meat version for the family!

LOVED this recipe!  Tried it last month, am making it again today.  I didn't bother boiling the peppers first, just baked them with the stuffing inside.  Mixed in salsa instead of the chili-style diced tomatoes and plan to do that again (with my beloved Herdez this time).  I had leftover rice & bean mixture after stuffing my peppers but it's delicious just on its own too.

I skipped the boiling part. The peppers were still easy to cut and delicious with just being baked!

I also added chopped black olives. This was so good and on the cheap side too. 

Red and orange peppers are my favorite in this recipe, they just have more flavor than green.

First time to make stuffed bell peppers and I have to say they turned out great. All I did was follow the recipe. I let the bell peppers boil a little to long and one of them ripped. Oh I forgot that I did not bake the stuffed peppers for 30 minutes, more like 20 for me. We were getting hungry. I also had a lot of filling left over and will be using for burritos tonight. I will definitely fix again.

I could have just eaten the stuffing! So good. I added shredded spinach and feta instead of Mexican cheese. Loved it :)

Absolutely loved this! I used black bean quinoa made with vegetable broth. I did not pre cook my peppers and I put a little enchilada sauce in my baking dish. I used pepperjack cheese for the mix and colby for the top. Amazing! Will definitely make again...thank you.

I made this exactly to recipe and I loved it. Then I made it again using brown rice and no cheese. Loved it even more. My family is trying to eat mostly vegetarian and sometimes vegan so this recipe works both ways. Will definitely be making this for dinner again and again :)

Excellent. We made the recipe with red bell peppers and threw in a bit of veggie sausage crumbles.
So filling - a pepper and a half each was all we could do!

I made these but left out the cumin since I didn't have any. I found that 3-4 mins to parboil the peppers wasn't long enough as the peppers were still a bit firm. I like the flavors otherwise but would definitely try it with the cumin next time.

I've just tried it :) creative and tasteful! I did some changings too. I've used green lentils instead of rice and added some carrot and corn. And i love spicy so I added garlic, basil and different kinds of pepper. Bon appétit!

These were awesome!  Not too spicy, but with just the right kick.  Fairly simple to make, and cheap.  They were a huge hit.  My only complaint is the cheese didn't melt, rather, it got crunchy - although it's probably my fault for buying cheap cheese.  Next time I'll by Sargento, like the recipe suggests.  Overall, these were healthy, tasty and perfect for a week night.

I did use a yellow pepper in place of green since that was what I had and I omitted the black beans when I discovered what I though was beans was,in fact, cranberries!  I need a light in the pantry.  These were so filling and rich, I just wish I had doubled the recipe.  Oh, I also placed the peppers in the dish they would be baked in, filled it halfway with water and nuked each side for about a minute instead of boiling them.  Thank you, Donnam, this will be a repeated recipe for us.

Awesome main dish or side dish. We ate is as a side to enchiladas, it's always nice to find ways to add more veggies to your mexican meals. I had fresh tomatoes I needed to use up so I used them with a can of tomato sauce instead of canned chili style tomatoes. Added a bit more chili powder and cumin. It was a hit with husband and KIDS!!! It was nice to combine rice and beans instead of having to do two seperate sides. Will definitely add this to our Mexican meals rotation. Thanks for the yummy and easy recipe!

Had this the other night and it was delicious! We used a can of diced tomatoes and chiles in place of the chili style tomatoes but kept everything else the same. It was very filling, all I needed were a few crackers to take out some of the spice, lol.

Take note: the 1 tbsp of salt is for the WATER to cook the peppers, not for the tomato/beans/rice mix! Accidentally mixed them up. 
Despite the salt overload, the final product tasted pretty good.

I substituted the rice for quinoa and it turned out amazing. My recommendation would also be to put any extra stuffing mix into the pan around the peppers. I’d also add corn.

This recipe is perfect except I halved the cumin. Everyone loved it!  I had to find something meatless and gluten free and this fit the bill. I served it with garlic bread.

I loved this! I used both green and yellow peppers and found the yellow peppers were sweeter and had more flavor in my opinion. But both were good, nonetheless!

It was a good starting recipe. It was dryer and milder than I expected. Increased the spice quantities and added tomato sauce for the second half. Will make again.

My fiance loves hot food, but no one else in the family can stomach things that are too spicy. I made the mistake of grabbing a can of Rotel and it was way too spicy for the family. Everyone at theirs except for my daughter, but all the leftovers will be exclusively for Tony. I thought it tasted really good, and I will make it again and I won't mess up and get Rotel next time.

I used Quinoa instead of rice as I had just cooked a batch of it. I used plain water to boil the peppers, used fresh garlic and omitted the salt and it was still plenty salty for me with the salt in the canned tomato and beans. Plus I did substitute some canned corn for part of the quinoa. Used dairy free cheese as milk bothers my allergies. Was very good but tricky to eat so since we had to chop it up on the plate decided next time I will just forget stuffing the peppers, just dice them up and make  a casserole! I used all organic ingredients so was a successful vegan meal! Even my picky husband liked it!

I made a resolution to eat vegetarian at least one or two days a week and this was the first recipe I tried.  Absolutely delicious!  I used shredded sharp cheddar since I always have some of that on hand for omelets, otherwise followed recipe.  Hopefully I can find a few more veggie dished as good as this one!

This was 5 stars with my changes, as copied from other users. I baked the peppers at 350 for 15 minutes and this was a game-changer. It mellowed out the flavor and softened them up for my family who doesn't love peppers as much. I used a clove of garlic with the onion, used brown rice, increased cumin to 1 tsp, and instead of the can of tomato sauce, I had some leftover Aldi brand spaghetti sauce and put at least a 1/2 cup in the rice mixture and more on top before baking. This sweetened it up a bit, but it was so yummy. I've made several variations of stuffed peppers and this so far was the family's favorite!

I added 2tsp. crushed red pepper, 1 tsp. Creole seasoning, and in place of the garlic salt I used 1rsp. salt and 3 cloves of garlic. I also added a small handful of frozen corn. I then sautéd the onion, added the garlic, then added the spices and remaining ingredients. I put half the cheese in the mixture, and the remainder on top of the peppers.

This was my first time eating stuffed peppers. I was a bit nervous. I shouldn't have been as they were delicious! I added spicy sausage and some hot sauce in the mixture. Next time I'm going to turn it into a casserole with the peppers already cut as it's a pain to do once the full stuff pepper is cooked and on your plate.

I made this last night and it was good, but the peppers should have boiled longer. The mixture was good too, I added more seasoning to my liking than what was on here because it just tasted bland if I hadn't. And the mixture could have fixed for at least 6, maybe a couple more, so I have a huge bowl left over that I don't know what to do with.

I will make this again and again!  I added spices to our taste.
 Then I doubled the rice and bean mix so I had enough to also fill corn tortillas in a 9x13 pan for a Mexican casserole of sorts.  We gladly munched on it all week!

I would share on with someone else next time, or use smaller peppers because it was just way too much of the pepper taste.

These were delicious! My husband was a little leery because he had never had stuffed peppers without meat before, but he liked them so much that he ate 4.  
I did change it up a little and used a couple of fresh tomatoes from the garden and a can of tomato sauce. I also added a couple of jalapenos and fresh garlic. 
I liked to pre-boil method and I didn't think the flavor of the peppers suffered as a result.  The texture of the peppers were just right, not too soft. 
We will definitely be making these again.

Used leftover cooked quinoa instead of rice and it was FABULOUS. Baked bells at 250 for 25 minutes as others suggested (instead of boiling). I may try boiling next time, because they were a bit crisp, but still delish. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe!

I subbed the chili diced tomatoes for a can of just regular diced tomatoes and I subbed the rice for one bag of Uncle Ben’s quinoa and brown rice bag. 

Oh, and to save time in the oven.  After I drained the pot with the peppers in it I used that pot for  all the remaining ingredients (minus cheese) and cooked. Added cheese then stuffed the peppers . Oven only took 15 minutes or so to melt the cheese.

I have made these a few times now and are always a huge hit. I use 6 peppers and there is enough filling to fill another 3 more for sure. I also don't add the cheese in with the mixture I layer it in peppers and on top.

These were delish!  Super easy to make, although it did take a number of dishes.  I put in just a smidge of extra spices (all on the recipe, just more) and the filling tasted a bit spicy, but great ... but after baking with cheese, it all mellowed out.  Next time, more spice, but still great!

I like them and so does my 9 year old. I did add garlic in with the onions. I also added shrimp in on another batch. Because I had a hard time getting mine to stand on their own, I used my muffin pan and that worked out great. Because the first time I made it I had so much rice mixture left over, I put the rest of it in soft shells. Kids really liked that too. I’ve made this twice already and it will be a regular in my house.

We’re trying to eat less meat, esp beef but my kids are leery about beans. This was great!

I always microwave peppers for 4.5 min when stuffing them. Far easier and faster.  My kids won’t eat spicy so I could only use .5tsp of chili and sharp cheddar. But added 1.5 tsp Worcester sauce because that’s the best thing about beef stuffed peppers. And used garlic powder vs garlic salt. Looked very cheesy and saucy compared to regular beef stuffing so I added another cup of rice. It was delicious!

I made it following the recipe with one exception: I didn’t have black beans so I added a can of whole kernel corn in its place. It was good, but I will add more seasoning next time I make this. In my opinion it needed more garlic salt.

Used red peppers. Subbed quinoa for rice. I added a can of mexicorn and 3 T of salsa since I did not have flavored tomatoes (but I did use fire roasted) the flavors were amazing.

I just used a pint of my salsa and add a few jalapeño if wanted. Boiled peppers a little longer. 
I added olive oil, corn and black beans to rice. 
Add brown sugar
Really good.

Great recipes but she dirties way too many pans. While the oven was preheating, I put the bell peppers under the broiler to soften. I put the chopped onions on a little plate in the preheating oven to soften. I sprayed them with cooking spray it lightly first. Other than that, all I did was add more to it because we just love cumin.

Ratio of rice to other ingredients for stuffing mixture is WAY off in original recipe which causes the filling to be somewhat bland.  I am going to try again with only 1 cup of rice and see how that comes out.

Great recipe but I really wanted to add ground turkey, which I did. My boyfriend really like it but I felt like it could have had a bit more flavor. Other than that, I will definitely be making this again soon. I had plenty left over for burritos too.

Really good. We'll make it again. It was tasty & satisfying - even for carnivores. We suggest using another 1/2 - 1 cup of black beans - starting with dry beans. Even without the extra beans you'll have leftover filling. Unless you use very large peppers, add  one  or two to the recipe. We chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and cooked them briefly with the onion.

Make sure u cook it by “baking it like other said 250 degree 8-10 mins also since the pepper itself lacks flavor what I did was rubbed oil outside of the pepper before cooking it and lightly sprinkled garlic salt  then cooked pepper 250 for 8-10mins then filled and cooked until bubbly ... I also added 1/3 cup marina sauce for the filling didn’t dry out came out great!

To the original recipe, I added corn, then divided the mixture in three sections.
One is vegetarian with the added corn.
Two is addition of one cooked, shredded chicken breast. 
Three is the addition of browned, ground sirloin. 
These three sections made six large peppers! 
Leftover frozen stuffing to be used for tacos, soup, burritos, tostados or whatever.

Used the yellow, orange and red peppers and cut jack o’lantern faces in them before par-boiling.
Will find out tomorrow how they came out.
Made them for our Pastor’s 1st Year Anniversary and Pastor Appreciation Month potluck luncheon,

VERY FILLING!! (Doubled the recipe) So I made this for my family because I am trying to cook more often and last time I cooked, there was way too much salt so I taste-tested this one the whole way through. I started out by washing and cutting the tops off of 8 red bell peppers, seeding them, and throwing them in a pot of water to boil. After that I was going to chop the onion since I had the cutting board out, but we had no onion. Oops! Next I made two boxes of Mexican style Rice-A-Roni . While that was cooking, I drained and rinsed the black beans and diced tomatoes and made the spice mix (without salt!!). I was unsure if I should add the spice mix because the rice I bought also came with spices. I also took the peppers out of the boiling water and placed 6 of them (I could only fit six) in a casserole dish. Once the rice was finished, I put that into a bowl with the beans and tomatoes, added cheese (one cup mexican blend and 2 c mozzarella is what I had on hand), and stirred it up. I tasted it, and it seemed like it could do with some more seasoning so I added half the mix from the recipe, tasted it, then added the rest of it. Delicious! I then filled 6 peppers to the brim, put the tops on, foil over, and slid them in the oven. The last two I also filled but did not put in the oven. On second thought, I don't know why I put them in the oven just now because I plan to serve them to my family tomorrow. Oh well! Tl;dr, I made the recipe, tasted great, and filled me up just fro

My husband and I really  enjoyed it.  I was very generous on the spices, using heaping measuring spoons and McCormick   dark chili powder rather than standard chili powder as I only had plain tomato sauce on hand plus we like spicier dishes.  I also added a can of sweet corn kernels, filled 6 medium sized peppers and still had enough mix to fill two more!  We'll definitely make over and over again!

I added corn as recommended by another. I also baked my peppers coated in olive oil in the oven 
until soft instead of boiling. My family loved them. This will definitely be a part of my regular vegetarian rotation.

It was really good, i would stuff the bell pepper with ricotta cheese in the middle and add another layer of rice on top of it and let it all bake together. I also wanted a little more kick so i used some red pepper flakes. But over all I really loved this meal.

love this recipe!! i could eat it all day everyday. i would use less rice in the mixture (about a cup of rice was a perfect balance of all the ingredients to me) and maybe a little less salt and a little more chili powder. but with or without these small changes it was wonderful!

I didn’t have as much cheese so only topped the peppers with this, but it was still great! Tasty and filling. I baked the leftover rice filling in a seperate dish along side the stuffed peppers.

This is by far one of my favorites as well as my kids! They indulge on the inside of the bell pepper versus the outside. My husband and I eat the whole thing it’s sooo good:) I will definitely make this meal again!

This is not the first time I have made this recipe, but it's the first time I've made it quite in this shape. My husband and I love this recipe and we attempted to make it tonight with some very farm fresh peppers which fell apart into shreds after boiling them. Not to be outfoxed by a bunch of peppers the dish turned into a Mexican inspired vegetarian stuffed pepper casserole in a mighty hurry. The peppers are underneath  the filling . See the picture.

It was really filling which was surprising because I substituted cauliflower rice for the rice.  I also used red and yellow bell peppers as my family are not fond of green bell peppers.

A couple of changes - I used brown rice, fire roasted tomatoes, 3 cloves fresh garlic minced, and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little heat. Also, used Kraft fat free cheese (they won't be able to tell any difference).

It was a winner with my friends after watching World Cup.

Wonderfully healthy but yummy vegetarian meal. Added some tomato sauce to the rice before cooking. Added two fresh, chopped jalapeños, three fresh chopped cloves of garlic and chopped fresh coriander. Used orange bell peppers which were not blanched before filling. The recommended 30 minutes at 350 F was spot on. The very slight crunch of the peppers were a nice contrast in texture to the filling. This recipe was a great hit with hubby and guests. Definitely a keeper !!

I will definitely make this again. I divided the rice and added seasoned ground beef to half for the meat eaters. I made extra of the rice filling and heated that in a skillet the next day. I melted  a slice of Monterey Jack cheese  on top of the rice. Delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed these stuffed peppers.  They tasted great and can be served to meat eaters and vegetarians alike.  I substituted corn for the black beans.  I will be making this dish again.

This turned out great.  I didn't have enough peppers so I chopped up the two that I had and made a casserole.  I also replaced the rice with quinoa to increase the protein.  I will definitely make this again, but I will probably double the spices as I think that it could have been spicier.

I added lentils to this recipe, used brown rice instead of white rice, added fajita seasoning, and i changed the ratio so there was less rice and more beans and lentils. It was very good, and not dry at all.

I make this recipe once a month. I use the red, yellow and orange bell peppers instead of the green and I use quinoa instead of rice. I have made it with rice and decided to switch to quinoa as a healthier alternative. It tastes delicious either way as the taste is consistent with either one. My picky kids really like it and I feel good they are eating a healthy meal.  Thank you for sharing!

So freaking good!!!!  Yuuuum.  I tried using both red and green peppers and the green turned out so delicious that I recommend using just green.  I made saffron rice instead of plain rice and that took it over the top.  This recipe is a keeper!

I enjoy this recipe better with red, orange or yellow peppers. I also prefer to bake them prior to stuffing them rather than boiling. Then for an added boost of nutrition I substitute quinoa for the rice.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used quinoa instead of rice and used a little less cheese. The only "complaint" I had from my family was "it's a little too spicy". I thought it was great! I  will just go a little lighter on the spice next time for the kiddos.

I made this for dinner tonight and followed the recipe, except did not have the chili tomatoes and used regular diced tomatoes with added cayenne and chili powder. The end product was just ok with added hot sauce...not awful but kind of blah. I may try it again using the spicier tomatoes to see if it is perkier

I added a can of corn just because I thought it would go well (and it did), and because the creator of the recipe said it's not too spicy, I doubled all the spices (except the salt) because we like spicy food.  We loved it!  I think there was enough to stuff 6 peppers though.

A new favorite meal for us! After checking some other people's reviews, I made some changes to the recipe.
First off, I actually cut the peppers in half and steamed them. Halving them made it so I could pile way more of the filling on and I steamed them since I ddin't feel like waiting for water to boil.
Secondly, I sauteed up the onions and a few cloves of garlic for a minute or two before adding in the tomatoes, beans, some corn, a jalapeño pepper, chili powder, and cumin. I then let that all simmer for a good long while, and then mixed everything up with the rice (basmati).
Also because my family are HUGE mushroom fans, I added some chopped up cooked mushrooms in- it was amazing!
Absolutely love the way these turn out!

I boiled the peppers for 2 min and baked for 10. I also added a jalapeño to the stuffing. It at least made it look more colorful. It turned out really well. I will definitely be making this again.

We have made these several times, almost always adding canned corn to the stuffing mix. In place of the diced tomatoes the first time around (didn’t have any), we used jarred salsa - liked it so much that we’ve done it that way every time since. These are so filling, and you always forget that they’re vegetarian. If you’re short on time, skipping the boiling of the peppers is no big deal, the flavour is still great and you just end up with more crunch. Excellent recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  Might use less chili powder next time, but only to make it a little more toddler friendly.  My husband didn't even realize it was vegetarian!

These were not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I will try them again adding a jalepeno pepper and sharper cheese .  I used red, orange and yellow peppers and used quinoa instead of rice.

I used fresh garlic and chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and it was delicious. If you have leftover stuffing, you can bake it in an oven safe mug or bowl, then scoop it onto tortilla chips.

Used a mexican seasoned rice pack so I omitted the salt.  I will probably sub plain garlic for the garlic salt next time as the seasoned rice packet has plenty of sodium. But it was excellent, the whole family enjoyed it, vegetarians and non- vegetarians. It was too much to fit into 4 peppers so I boiled two more peppers to finish off the stuffing, good thing because 3 people ate 5 peppers!

This was very easy to make. I did make a few changes based on the reviews I read.... I used a little bit of enchilada sauce to make the inside of the peppers more moist. My husband, and I, are new to the veg life. I would make this again.... It is so filling!!!

Made the recipe as written the first time and thought it was really good.
The 2nd time I changed it up a bit. I did as some others suggested and pre-baked instead of boiling the peppers. They had a bit more crunch, which I liked. I also doubled the seasoning and added jalapenos as I like a bolder flavor and more heat.
Will definitely be in the regular rotation.

This was really good! I took a shortcut by  making a good boxed Spanish rice mix and using that as the rice/tomatoes. I still added all the spices, which kept it from being bland, but  it felt like it might need just one more thing which I haven't figured out yet.  Trying to get more plant-based but I could tell this would be great with chorizo too. Even my 6-year old ate all the filling - will work on getting him to eat the pepper. Overall a success for us.

I made this for some friends and the three of us were not so impressed. I think the next time, I won't boil the pepper. I have made stuffed peppers before and I have never boiled them first. So I'm going to stick with that. The flavors were ok but I will add more heat the next time. And I will use much more cheese than the recipe calls for

Just okay.  *** Note: 2 cups of rice makes enough stuffing for 8 peppers (the recipe calls for 4 peppers)... and I used 4 large peppers.

Was very good.  The only change I made was to use Cauliflower rice in place of the white rice.
Will be making again.  It is a very filling recipe.

Great recipe but I found it to have too much rice. I did however added chopped shrimp and corn. My guess next time to add more veggies and less rice, half of the suggested amount. Quick and easy to make! Thanks for sharing!

I followed most of the recipe, and also looked at the comments for ideas. I noticed many people thought the recipe to be dry so i topped and baked in enchilada sauce. Amazing.

This was delicious! The only changes I made were not boiling the peppers first and I only added 1 cup of rice because I kept reading that it made a lot of filling. I also diced up the tops of the peppers and added it to the filling. In the future, my husband and I agreed that we'd corn and use a different color pepper for stuffing, because the flavor of the green pepper was too strong and we didn't really like it. It also needs more spice, so I'll probably add jalapeño to it

In an effort to introduce vegetarian dishes to my family, I made this recipe, and my meat-eating family enjoyed it, never missing the meat.  Very tasty.  The only changes that I made were to use red bell peppers instead of green bells, and I added canned corn to the rice mixture.

Great as a main dish or as a side. Heats up well for left overs or make ahead as well. 

To save time I used the pre-seasoned yellow rice and chili tomatoes in the can already seasoned  so it was super fast and tasted great For extra color I think I would add some corn to it as well.

This was excellent!  Should be my go to meatless stuffed peppers.  I cut recipe in 1/2.  Used 2 peppers and 1/2 of everything else.  Added some thawed frozen corn, some ch. cilantro.   Sauteed some real garlic w/ch. onion, then stirred in chili powder, cumin and garlic powder.  Added in corn and a whole can of drained black beans.  Also added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and then stirred in some salsa because it was a little dry and the cilantor..  Right before stuffing peppers I stirred in ch. cheese.

This is one of my  husband's favorite dishes.  I usually add some ground turkey to his, though he still loves the vegetarian version.  These also freeze well - actually having left-overs for lunch today!

I followed the instruction and boil the peppers. I kept an eye on it so it wouldn't overtook. I boiled 6 peppers and it took around 8 mins to cook to my desired consistency. I sautéed the onion and used fresh chopped garlic. Instead of throwing away the tops of the pepper, I chopped them up and added to the onion mixture. The little bit of the diced green, orange and red peppers really added color to he stuffing. I added 6oz of portobella  mushroom, a can of Cuban black bean and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes into the stuffing . Apart from the  cumin, I also added a tablespoon of "better than bouillon chicken base" and 2 tablespoon of Harissa paste. With the 2 cups of rice, and cheese, the amount was just perfect for 6 pepper:)

This was delicious. I made this for a family dinner... one of our daughters is vegan so I always try to make at least one dish she can eat (she always brings something as well). Well, the whole family like them and a daughter-in-law asked for the recipe. My peppers were large, so I cut them in half top to bottom and stuffed them. The only other change I made was adding a can of corn. This is a keeper.

Absolutely loved it, as did my wife. Used Mexican-style shredded cheese with spices included and added all the recipe spices, too. My only recommendation is that this recipe will fill 6-8 peppers depending on size.

This recipe is amazing as is, but I made a change to it only because my Husband and roommate are carnivores. Even with me adding a pound of ground turkey, the flavor was excellent. Other changes I made was that I steamed the bell peppers and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, only because I was out. The next day, there were no leftovers and the roommate (who generally hates anything green) ate his whole pepper. I am definitely going to make this again.

I made this for my Meatless Monday and it was sooo tasty! I pretty much followed the recipe but sautéed the pepper stuffing seasonings to blend all off the spices before mixing in Goya yellow rice and Spanish tomato sauce to keep it all moist. Quick, fun & tasty!??

Typically  I follow the recipe the first time I make something new.  This time I baked the peppers as well as sautéed the beans after the onions and garlic.  

The peppers were a bit soggy, even after baking.  I did not drain the diced tomatoes, which was only a 10 ounce can, so that may be part of it.

Overall I thought it was pretty good.  Next time i will likely add some ground beef or maybe shredded chicken.  The remaining peppers were frozen.  We will see how they turn out!

This recipe was great. I baked the peppers like others recommended but they were still not as soft as I would have liked. The filling was delicious so I will cook the peppers longer next time.

Was a little dry.  The next time I made it I added tomato sauce on top of the peppers and then baked it.

We liked this very much. I didn't have the Ro-tel tomatoes, so I used just diced tomatoes. I can't imagine adding a can of tomato soup. I followed the recipe precisely and it came out plenty moist. It's definitely a keeper.

Like some other reviewers, I used quinoa instead of the rice, because I had it on hand to use.  I also baked my peppers, cut side down on a baking sheet and lightly oiled, 20 minutes at 325 degrees.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and found that it was very, very good and the filling had a great Mexican taste!  Oh, I did also use red bell peppers instead of green, as we are not big fans of the green pepper taste, I liked the taste a lot.  Great recipe, I will keep this and use it again, thanks!

This was really good!  I changed it just a tad.  It's just me so I adjusted for two servings.  I roasted the peppers as others suggested, used fresh garlic, and just a tad of red pepper flakes.  Super delish!  And since I only used half cans of black beans and tomatoes, I mixed them together and froze for next time. Hoping the beans freeze ok. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This turned out great! Some changes I made were I used leftover rice to mix with the beans, cooked rice always mixes better, I also added sweet corn and green enchilada sauce. My family really loved it.

Really good. I  followed the suggestions of others and prebaked the green peppers in the oven instead of boiling in hot water. I seasoned them with all of oil , salt and pepper and bake for about 15 minutes. This was my first time making stuffed peppers and they are awesome!

I used red pepper as most of the family doesn't like the green.  Followered the recipe except added chopped pepper from the top I had cut off and sautéed  it with the onion and I used 3 fresh garlic cloves instead of the powder it called for.  We had an avacado available,  so made guacamole  to go with the peppers.  It was a grateful addition.

Very good recipe! They turned out delicious! I used brown rice and added some minced garlic when cooking the onion and heated the beans and seasonings with it. And I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and sea salt. I boiled the bell peppers even though some reviewers recommended baking them instead so they don't lose flavor. I still tasted the bell pepper taste but it might also be because I cut up the tops that I cut off and chopped them up small and added that  to the onion, as my mom recommended. But I think the whole bell peppers still had good flavor too.

Very tasty!  I cut the peppers in half length-wise, which made perfect serving sizes.  Also I couldn't get the shredded Mexican cheese blend, so I shredded a 7 ounce block of Tillamook habanero jack cheese.  Very spicy, but added the kick I think this may have needed.  Otherwise made as written. I did use brown rice, which worked fine.  I also used yellow and orange peppers, because I hate green peppers.

Love these. With a few add-ons. Corn makes it so much better. I  sautéed  the onions, black beans, cumin and chili powder. Mixed in rice and cheese. And used red bell peppers instead of green.

Oh yum. These were so great. I thought it would need some sauce, but they were moist and flavorful without it. My only advice is for people who are as dumb as I am. Make sure you pull the peppers out of the boiling water with tongs. DON'T dump into a colander. Mine splashed back and burned my forehead with boiling water. Don't do what I did! Ouch!

THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS! We added a can of corn to the recipe as well and it was so good. We were able to fill 5 bellpeppers and had a lot of the rice mixture left. So we filled mini bell peppers as well! The mini stuffed bell peppers would be great for parties.

I am not vegetarian, but, made this for my visiting step daughter. I made this recipe as written. With the exception of adding corn and garlic and letting all simmer awhile before stuffing the peppers. My stepdaughter loved it and my husband and I did too.

I used red and orange peppers and doubled the spices (substituting Adobo for the salt and garlic salt). I added 1 clove of minced garlic to the onions and used queso fresco in place of the cheese blend. I also baked the peppers without blanching them to retain flavor and shape. Turned out great!

These were really good. I chopped the pepper caps and sauteed them with the onion-because why not??-and I did not add that last half teaspoon of salt to the stuffing. I bought four pretty huge peppers but still ended up with a little bit of extra stuffing.

Very good...I used 3 red peppers...cut them in half and steamed them...sauteed the onions and added rest of ingrediants with a teaspoon of garlic instead of salt and sauteed a few more minutes...added the cheese last minute before stuffing...overstuffed then added remaining cheese on top...baked 30 min...they were delish...very easy, will make again...

Simply love this dish. Easy to make for a person like me who is not a pro at cooking. Best for weeknight meals when you want to make something good but you low on energy.
I used Amy's Organic Spicy Chili instead of the tomatoes and the black beans and it turned out just fine! Loved the recipe.
Boyfriend loves it too!

Following Christen52's advice, I cooked the onions, garlic, and beans together with spices. Then I added rice and cheese to the mix.

It was a great base , when I make again I believe I will add corn and instead of the chili style tomatoes , I think I will use Rotel, over all was a good dish and will make again with the added ingredients

This was a good, but needed more spice. Add more chili powder, cumin and fresh cilantro to perk it up.

Very good recipe! I used fresh garlic but otherwise followed as written. I tried baking the empty peppers for about 20 minutes prior to stuffing, and they were still quite crisp. Next time, I will try boiling!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were so good! Moist, flavorful, fresh and filling! My hubby and little kids loved them, too. This would be a great thing to make when guest come over or to take to a potluck. They looked beautiful, too!

This was tasty. I'd make it again with a change, about double the spice. I used all the ingredients and changed nothing except I made it a "deconstructed stuffed bell pepper" cuz I didn't care if it was pretty. :) but yeah,  relatively healthy and cheap = winner.

Instead of boiling the peppers I roasted at 250 degrees for 20 minutes to intensify the flavor rather than dilute it.  They were "al dente," perfect for me.  I added minced jalapeno and crumbled 4 Boca Burgers into the onion saute, then added minced garlic near the end (so it wouldn't burn).  Still used the garlic salt, too.  Added a can of corn.  Accidentally opened a can of S&W Black Chili Beans (black beans, onion, garlic and chili spices), used it anyway.  I included the liquid from the black beans and the Rotel diced tomatoes & green chilies, as some reviewers had trouble with dry stuffing.  Used Pepper Jack cheese, I had it on hand.   I served the peppers with plain greek yogurt (as a sour cream substitute), salsa, and green tabasco as condiments.  OMG!!!  So much flavor... just perfect!  This is a good recipe base to modify as desired.  Try it!

So I made this recipe, but had to make a bunch of substitutions.  I used old pasta sauce instead of the canned tomatos, added a 3/4 teaspoon more garlic salt and cumin, more chili powder, didn't boil the peppers, and used half rice and half braised black lentil recipe.  Oh and used vermont sharp cheddar and mozzarella.  I didn't really measure anything other than the spices, but then added them to taste.  Oh and I took it out after 35 minutes and topped it with green kale that had some nice texture.  There was also yellow squash....sooooo I sorta made this dish, and it came out amazing.  Would make again.

I did not boil the peppers (used a variety of colors, not just green) and it still turned out great!  Next time I will make mine a bit spicier, but that's obviously a personal preference :)

We loved it!  I've made this several times as a main dish and also cut in half and served as a side dish.  I also used red peppers instead of green ( we just like t hem better) and it was great.   My husband does not like spicy and it was just fine for him.

My boyfriend and i definitely enjoyed making these stuffed peppers. We took the vegan route, using daiya dairy free jalapeno cheese and medium san juans salsa instead of canned tomatoes to give it extra flavor. Next time i'll try topping it with corn and extra cumin/curry powder, overall this dinner was delicious and wonderfully satisfying.

Very Very Good! I will make this again and again.  My husband and I are not vegetarians, but we try to have meatless meals 3-4 times a week.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not boil the peppers, I put them in a dish with a little water and baked them for about 20 min. to start to soften, and while they baked after being stuffed, I added about 1/2 cup of water to the pan, so it steamed while it cooked.

Big hit.  Used mixed color bag of peppers and TVP hydrated in beef stock instead of meat.  I think the cheese topping set this in the keeper box.

We were very skeptical about this recipe as I typically think stuffed peppers are too tomatoey.  I puréed the tomatoes in this recipe.  My husband always wants meat with his dinner so he wasn't thrilled about it being vegetarian.  We were pleasantly surprised after trying them.  My two year old love the filling and I've even made the filling as a side dish.  So good!

I also went a little rogue on this recipe by leaving out the cumin, chili powder and olive oil. I also substituted the garlic salt for real garlic, finely chopped. I didn't cook the bell peppers in boiling water, instead used peppers that had not been refrigerated and were room temp, and they seemed to turn out ok. I baked for about 25 min.

This was so good! My changes were due to whatever I had in pantry so i subbed garlic for onion and crushed tomatoes. Instead of boiling I baked for 30 min at 375 and if you have just cooked your rice I think it helps steam the peppers.

I added two diced jalapeños to my onion mixture and sautéed the remaining ingredients together to meld all the flavors before adding to the rice. I also was heavy handed on the seasoning as I like my food flavorful. I swapped out the green bell pepper for red and I topped with tomato sauce before the final cheese topping. So delicious will be making often.

I made this tonight, pretty true-to-recipe aside from using rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of chili-style tomatoes. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make again!

Cooked beans, garlic, cumin, and chili powder together.  Then added tomatoes and heated up.  Used brown rice instead of white.  Baked green onions at 250 degrees for 15-20 minutes instead of boiling.  Turned out delicious.

My husband and I are vegetarians, and have been for 3 years. This IS THE BEST stuffed green pepper we have EVER had. It is awesome! I did not use the cumin, because we both have indigestion problems. It actually would have stuffed 6 peppers, so next time I'll have 6 peppers ready to stuff! I cannot say enough about this recipe, except that they are perfect! Try it.

I like this recipe a lot mostly because it allows lots of changes in the stuffing, and the pepper will always balance whichever flavor. Next time I will try to add jalapeños and see if I like a spicier stuffing.

I ignored the measurments for all the spices and added A LOT more than recommended.  The flavor was pretty good. I didn't want to dirty a pan just for the onions so I added dried onion flakes instead. I will make this again.

I loosely followed the instructions above and the pepper filling came out fantastic! I sauteed the onions as instructed. I substituted the beans for a half package of morning star farm meat crumbles. added a can of medium salsa instead of the diced tomatoes, and used Spanish rice. I folded the Mexican cheese into the mixture and added pepper and chili spice to taste. It had just the right zing to it!

The only thing I switched was I used two cans of Rotel tomatoes and chilies. My boyfriend loves Ortega taco sauce, so I mixed it in with the stuffing. It was awesome!!

I also added a twist to this recipe.....beefed up the amount of cumin & chili powder PLUS I added a little bit of Taco Seasoning mix. I made 3 cups of the rice mixture & with 4 humongous Green Peppers had a bit leftover. We will be wrapping this up in burritos for a leftover snack ? My fiancee tore this up & (unlike me) is an avid meat eater.....however he didn't miss meat at all. The next time I make this I will try it with a bit of Morningstar Farm Vegetarian beef crumbles. Should be delish too.

Delicious recipe very tasty and super fast if you have the rice already left over. Easy to put together ahead of time and then just slide the tray in the oven. I cooked my peppers in the microwave to save a little time, next time I will reduce the amount of salt added to the rice mixture. Thank you for sharing!!

I reduced the cheese to about 3/4 cup in the rice mixture to save fat and it still turned out gooey and cheesy! I do have one concern, and that is the amount of salt in the recipe... 1/2 teaspoon doesn't sound like much, but when used in addition to the salty cheese, salted chili powder and salted canned tomatoes, it gets to be too salty... So don't add in the salt until you have added all the ingredients to the mixture before tasting and adjusting your seasoning. Overall, a great and versatile recipe!

Amazing! I made a few changes.  I fire grilled the peppers on the stove first and substituted a box of flavored quinoa for the rice.  From there I pretty much added the black beans, cooked onions and can of tomatoes and popped it in the oven.  I omitted the spices because the pre-packaged quinoa mix had it already.  It came out really good. I will be making this again.

Yummy, I steamed my peppers on top of the rice as it cooked, and used fresh tomatoes and chilies because that is what I had on hand. I will say it again YUMMY. I like meat with dinner and was looking for a way to brighten up my boring ole rice and beans with pork chops and this was it.

I had some gluten free/ vegetarian friends over for dinner and used this recipe.  It was a hit!  I used grated pepper jack cheese instead of the shredded mexican blend cheese and added diced jalepenos for an extra kick.  Try it with quinoa instead of rice.

Unfortunately...this recipe was unbelievably good. I was hoping for a mediocre dish because it was a bit of a pain to put together. As a working mom with 3 kids, any meal that requires cooking peppers, then cooking rice then mixing up the filling and only then actually assembling and cooking the final dish...well this takes 30 minutes too long and 3 too many pots/bowls for my liking. But it was incredibly good- much better than I expected (I only tried it bc I had 4 peppers sitting in my fridge from my CSA box and couldn't think of another way to use them all). So, clearly this is NOT a weeknight dinner (at least for us) but it is a keeper.

I'm in love with this dish.  Made it tonight, and it was a big hit with my husband.  I made extra rice, so I supplemented with a big heirloom tomato. We didn't have any garlic salt, so I sautéed fresh, and it was terrific.  Also, I used Tillamook jack cheese and it browned nicely and was delicious.  OH, and I forgot the beans..oh well. It was still great. Thanks for the great recipe!

Tried it and loved it! Made some slight changes depending on what ingredients we had. Have made it a number of times and enjoy it each time.
