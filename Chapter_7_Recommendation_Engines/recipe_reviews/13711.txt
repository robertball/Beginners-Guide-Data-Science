This has become a favorite around here. Though, I must agree with others in that it isn't enough to sufficiently fill 2 pie crusts.  I have successfully added another 1/2 - 3/4 cup of pumpkin (without adjusting any other ingredients) to help it stretch. Very delish, regardless.

This is a great recipe is you are looking for a true taste of pumpkin.  I was happy to find a recipe for cooking fresh pumpkin other than baking.  But don't expect this to taste like pumpkin pie from the can....it is not as sweet or spicy.  If you are looking for a spicer taste, I would recommend increasing each of the spices by 1/2 tsp.  This was a very fun recipe to make, and I will make again.

The most excellent pumpkin pie.  I added a pinch of allspice and a pinch
of cloves to add a touch more spice to the pie.
Also, the pumpkin I used was very watery, so I added a teaspoon of cornstarch
to the final mixture before baking.
It baked uniformly, didn't burn the crust, or the pie: it turned out great!
The people I served it to said they would try to get my own cooking show!'
Very that happy Mr. Scott shared it with us.

This was a delicious recipe. I have never used brown sugar.  It was great!  I have always cooked fresh pumpkin right after Halloween by cutting in half, scoop out seeds and strings, and bake in oven on 400 until soft, then scoop pumpkin out and put in blender and blend until soft, then I store in 4 cup portions in freezer bags until Thanksgiving time.

This is a great recipe - preparing fresh pumpkin is also very easy in the microwave then pureed in blender/food processor.  It is excellent and once you have tried fresh pumpkin you will not buy another can and will freeze your own.  Long-necked pumpkin yield more flesh, and green/white striped squash are very sweet and mild.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My eleven year old son made this today.  He added cloves to the spice mix.  One trick we learned is to cook the pumpkin whole.  Make slits in it and bake it in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  It is so much easier to cut and then scoop out the seeds and flesh.

Fantastic recipe! My preference in cooking the pumpkin is to roast the small (2"x2") chunks in a roast pan at 350 for about an hour, then the pumpkin doesnt take on extra water. I have substituted the condensed milk with whipping cream - divine. And as a non-dairy alternative for my dairy-allergic husband, I used coconut milk which worked beautifully as well! This recipe adapts well and is a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing!

I was worried that it may be stringy since pumpkin was only hand-mashed and not food-processor puree'd, but it came out with a great texture and gentle seasoning that let the pumpkin flavor through. One pumpkin made 2 3/4 cups of mash for me. After mashing, drained but didn't go crazy (squeezing through cheesecloth, etc) and it came out great with a non-soggy crust.

This is the absolute best pumpkin pie ever! This was my first time making pumpkin pie with a pie pumpkin and I'll never go back to using canned pumpkin or buying a store-bought pumpkin pie ever again! It is a little work, but it's so worth it! I used a store-bought pie crust, roasted one 4.5 lb pie pumpkin at 400 degrees for 1 hr., let it cool, peeled off skin-which came off very easily, and pureed the pumpkin in my food processor. I got quite a bit of pureed pumpkin from just one 4.5 lb pie pumpkin, about 4 cups of puree. Two cups of pumpkin puree was not enough for this recipe so I used all 4 cups of puree. I doubled the entire recipe except for the salt & added 1 tsp. of Allspice. I used a 9" glass pie plate and had plenty of filling left over to make another pie. 40 min. of cooking time was not enough so I increased the cooking time to 55 min. and checked doneness with a toothpick. I let the pie cool for 2 hrs. and then covered & refrigerated it until it was cold before eating...added whipped cream and it was spectacular! I can't say enough about this recipe! 5 plus plus stars!!

the flavor was great.  One pie we boiled the pumpkin and the other pie we baked the pumpkin.  The baked pumpkin we liked a little more.  The flavor was richer and the color darker.

This recipe turned out great.  I took the pie to work and everyone raved about how good it was.  They couldn't believe how smooth it was.  Not bad for my first time baking a pie of any kind! :-)

I just made this last night and my family loved it! You could really tell the difference between the fresh pumpkin and the canned stuff. It was so much better! I will definately be making this again! Thanks for the awesome recipe! :-)

It wasn't bad, but I felt it was lacking something. Perhaps the All Spice?

YUM! I had been warned that fresh pumpkin has a lot more water in it and can be mushy so I followed a friend's method of preparing: 

I baked my pumpkin whole (with holes poked in) until soft, put it in the blender and then let it sit in a strainer to get the extra water out for several hours. For the recipe I added an extra egg.

It turned out PERFECT and SOOOO Yummy!!! My son this could use a bit more cinnamon but I thought the spices were just fine.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had!!! I only made the filling though and bought a gram cracker crust. Instead of boiling the pumpkin I baked it the night before and then cut it away from the skin and stored it overnight in tupperware.(Also the pumpkin was the leftover from us carving & it still came out good!!) Instead of mashing the pumpkin I blended it with some of the evaporated milk which gave it a nice consistency. I also used a tablespoon of allspice instead of nutmeg and only added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger. I will be making this pie again and again!!! :)

I have a very similar recipe.  Mine also has 1/4 c molasses and 1.5 tbsp melted butter.  I use a graham cracker crust as well.  I bake the pumpkin instead of boiling - halve the pumpkin, scoop out the seeds, and bake in oven skin side up at 325F for 1 hr.  So easy and so delicious!  Why would anyone want to use canned pumpkin after trying this.

Flavor wise and convenience-wise I would give this a 5-Star. But, when I made it yesterday, it took almost 75 min. to bake at 350.  Looked it up in Joy of Cooking and recipe almost identical, should be 15 min at 425 then 45 min at 350.  Cover the crust with foil to prevent over-browning.  Taste is great, spices mild enough to so that majority of eaters will like.  Crank 'em up a little for more sophisticated audience.

This is great! This recipe makes the perfect amount for a bigger pie, it just fills my 11-inch ceramic pie dish.
I also learned just now that you can just roast your pumpkin whole, either the little pie pumpkins OR your jack-o-lantern type pumpkin if you didn't carve it. For the big pumpkin, I cut a slit in it to let out steam, then roasted for 1 hr at 350 degrees, then turned down the oven to 180 degrees for eight hours. In the morning, it was thoroughly cooked, sunk down on the pan. The peel comes right off and the pumpkin flesh is pretty much pre-pureed! Just remove the seeds.

This recipe is actually really good. It does not make 2 pies. It makes one pie. Unless you like flat, thin, flimsy pies. I increased the pumpkin by 3/4 cup (trying to stretch the batter further) and added a tsp of vanilla. If you make one pie, just increase the baking time.

I am baking these pies right now, and have to agree that there is not enough filling to fill 2 pie shells.
BUT, because tomorrow is Thanksgiving I refuse to panic.  I filled one crust with 2/3's of the filling and and filled the second crust with the rest.  I am making a pecan streusel topping for the less filled one to help balance out the lower filling.  This works well with my family for the non-nut-loving ones, who just prefer the great taste of simple pumpkin pie, and for the ones who gotta have that crunchy pecan pie like streusel topping.

This is an "OK" recipe. The seasoning was just perfect for my family; we don't like it very spicy. I do take issue with the texture. It was not the normal "custardly" texture I expect in a pumpkin pie. It seemed like a firm pudding. I think I will keep looking for a recipe that has the right texture and flavor.

YUM!  I made this pie last night and it turned out great!  This is my first homemade pumpkin pie and it was really easy.  I also cut the pumpkin in half, scooped out the seeds and stringy stuff and baked it at 400 for 40 minutes.  Then I just threw all the filling ingredients with the pumpkin into my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I did DOUBLE the spices, plus added a pinch of cloves and all-spice.  I also added the full cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4.  I only got one pie out of it with a little filling remaining.  I filled the left over filling into my extra crust and baked for 1/2 the time. My dog actually jumped on the counter to get the pie and it landed on the floor.  It was so good that I was actually eating the pie off the floor (the parts that didn't touch the ground)!  I just bought the pie crust to save some time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a teaspoon of all the spices to the filling since I put in about 2.5 cups of pumpkin. The filling is delicious, absolutely perfect. I wasn't completely happy with the crust. It shrunk on me. I am not sure why that happened. On the plus side, the crust didn't fall apart so it cut easily into pie slices. It was pretty chewy though. I like a more tender crust. I will use the filling recipe again but will keep looking for another crust.

Mm.. So yummy~! This is THE BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had! I wish I could rate more than five stars. As many reviewers had suggested, I doubled the amount of spices and added ground cloves for an extra "punch". This is not enough for two whole pies so I added 1/4-1/2 c more of pumpkin.

Am living in India now and was craving pumpkin pie. Most recipes just ask for pumpkin puree but this one told me how to make it from scratch! I actually ended up using a pressure cooker, so my pumpkin cooked real fast. Used about 1kg(2lbs) of fresh pumpkin to get the required amount for the recipe. I was skeptical about the pie crust as it didnt require any baking/refrigeration beforehand...but my was I surprised. The pie came out so wonderful. So fresh and flavorful...it was a great hit with the family. Thank you!

This pie took much longer to cook than the recipe calls for and my crust started to burn.  400 is way to hot to cook a pie.  Also, it could use more spice.

Great recipe! Instead of boiling and mashing the pumpkin, we baked it at 400 degrees F for 1 hour, scooped out the guts, and pureed it in the blender. Substituted evaporated milk for 1 cup non-fat dry milk and 1 1/8 cups water. Doubled all spices except salt.

BEST pumpkin pie ever!!!!. there is nothing wrong with the recipe i added more spices cause many people love the spices in the pumpkin pie.  Which i learned being a chef over the years.  Some people like it spiced and some not so much.  But I really enjoyed the recipe and the only thing i added more of was the spices it just needed a pinch more cinn., nutmeg, and a dash of all spice. but over all great recipe.

I had grown pumpkins in my garden for my grandsons to have fun with but NOT to eat as I used to HATE pumpkin pie! I ended up with them taking over unwanted areas & was not going to ever grow them again but this recipe has changed my mind on BOTH accounts! I now LOVE pumpkin pie & I WILL be growing pumpkins again just so I can make this recipe! In the past I had tried canned pumpkin or even fresh pumpkin but with different spices that others made & to me it was just nasty! This year my grandson who loves ANY pumpkin pie talked me into making him one since we had all these fresh pumpkins. I came to this recipe first by chance & made it figuring it didn't really matter as I wasn't gonna eat it anyways. I doubled it & made 2 pies one of which I used plain white sugar. I tried a bite of both since they were the first I had made myself from scratch & I was shocked as I loved it! Well actually I loved the one with BROWN SUGAR. It makes a HUGE difference in taste! Also I HATE nutmeg but this recipe had perfect amounts of the RIGHT spices & nothing more! I had a little bit of pumpkin filling left over after doubling it & put it in 3 little soufle dishes & baked it with no crust. It was divine! I even toasted the pumpkin seeds with the same spices & my family loved it! Oh & my grandson who loves anything pumpkin? He said it was the beat pumpkin pie ever with a perfect texture, perfect crust & perfect taste! I will be using all future pumpkins to cook & freeze ahead for this recipe!

Awesome recipe that turned out really well. But I would puree the pumpkin next time instead of just mashing it.

Really loved the fresh pumpkin flavor.  Hubby doesn't even like pumpkin pie but he loved this.  I would probably throw the pumpkin in a food processor after baking because the strings in the pie was a little weird for me.  Excellent flavor though!

I made this pie for the neighbors and they loved it. The only difference was I put sweetened condensed milk in and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It actually was a mistake since I had bought the wrong milk. It came out great.

I tried several different recipes this year for fresh pumpkin pie. This one was by far the best! I added a little Allspice and ground clove the second time around and I didn't think it could get better, but it did!

This was the first pumpkin I ever made. Everyone loved it and asked for me to make it again, as I type I have 2 pies in the oven. I am Not even a big pumpkin pie fan and I loved it! I just added a 1/8 tsp of cloves, as some others recommended to add cloves.

while this pie has amazing potential, i think one reccomendation I would make is to also puree the pumpkin after mashing and mising as mine was still a little to chunky...otherwise awesome flavor and really good with very little sugar.

This was an awesome pie! I tried it at a get together with a bunch of friends at my house this past weekend and I got a lot of compliments. I did put in 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit more. And I did think it was kind of soupy so I added 2 Tablespoons of flour to thicken it up a bit. But I loved it! I will never use a can again!

I cooked the pumpkin in the oven before peeling and instead of boiling-worked great. Also made "better than pumkin pie" to compare. The squash was so smooth, the pumkin still had some strings. I suggest putting the pumkin extract in the blender with the milk. Everyone enjoyed the real pumpkin, but it may not actually be better than the store-bought one. The "better than pumpkin pie" was agreed as the best

This pie was easy to make.  The spices combined in a way that reminded me of my Grandmother's applesauce cake.  Instead of cooking the pumpkin on the stove, I filled my 5 quart slow cooker peeled, cubed pumpkin and cooked it over the course of a day.  That way I had plenty of pumpkin for trying different pie recipes, soup and for muffins.

I cut the recipe in half to make one pie and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. The only problem I had was that I had too much crust and not enough filling, I would have needed about double the filling to fill up the crust since there was almost an extra inch of the crust up the side. There was a lot of dough left over as well so I made 4 jam tarts with it. I prepared the crust the night before and then covered it with plastic and let it sit in the fridge overnight, I was worried that the dough would become too wet if I didn't do that. The dough was fantastic and I will continue to make all my pie crusts the same way.

I have never used fresh pumpkin to make a pie before so I did a trial run this week-end using this recipe. I made it exactly as written except I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of Allspice.  This was absolutely delicious.  I will never use canned pumpkin again.  I will be using this recipe for the pie I make for Thanksgiving.  I wish now I had bought more pumpkins.  I am going to be growing my own next year.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This pie came out amazing! I am currently living in German and there was no chance in making a "quick" pumpkin pie with canned pumpkin. Also a note to anyone else in Germany, I used Kondensmilche with 7.5% Fett to substitute the evaporated milk. I also doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg after reading reviews and it came out sweet and perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

I have to admit, throughout the process I had my doubts about the pie turning out well. To my surprise it is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. My reason for not giving this a five star rating is my issue that this does not make 2 pies, as I used a pumpkin a little over 1.5 lbs and it worked without scaling the rest of the ingredients to make a little too much for a 9" pie, but plenty for a 12" pie. I used another crust recipe that worked well. I really want to know if the ingredients are meant for one pie or two, as the typed instructions indicate one pie, but the recipe serving size automatically defaults to two pies. It's really amazing pie, and I'm going to try this pie again with a bigger pumpkin (I think about 3-4 lbs) and not scale the recipe at all. I'm guessing it will make two small 9" pies.

11/24/10.  My mother in law, my mom and their sisters are fabulous cooks, and so we have always had Thanksgiving at my MIL's  house.  I just let the matriarchs take over while I stayed on the sidelines.  BUT this year my best friend told me about this recipe, and so after 10 yrs I'm going to try something why not!  NERVOUSLY I did this.  I wasn't brave enough to do the crust so that was store bought.  The rest I doubled the spices and left the salt as is.  I roasted the pumpkin as many suggested.  I also mixed the evaporated milk...1/2 evaporate, 1/2 condensed.   With baited breath I waited for the reaction.  "This is delicious!"  my MIL was the 1st to exclaim....  They never opened the store bought pie last night.  So thank you thank you thank you.

This pie was awesome!  Made some small modifications to it. Added some extra spices and I used an entire cup of brown sugar instead of the 3/4 cup and it came out perfect.

Came out relatively bland and actually watery, maybe I didn't drain the puree enough. I don't know, but the end result wasn't too promising.

To me, there's very little difference between fresh pumpkin and canned pure pumpkin, so I just use 1 can of pure pumpkin instead.  This comes out perfectly every single time and has become a family favorite of ours.  I use a deep dish pie shell and am left with about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of filling.  Using 2-shallow dish pie shells is not enough filling, so I stick with the deep dish and will bake the extra in a small tart shell.

The recipe is perfect as is. My family enjoyed it served cold. It goes really well with a hot cup of coffee or chocolate. A good variation would be to add 4oz. sweet potato / grated coconut.

this is a great pie! I had to add about 1 1/2 more cups of pumpkin and an extra can of milk and still didn't have enough to fill my pie pans all the way. I have large deep dish pans. I also did not waist my time cutting the pumpkin up. I cut the pumpkin in half gutted, put tin foil over it and placed it in the oven @ 425 for an hour. let it cool for 10 min or so and scoop it out. I also used an emulsion blender on the mixture to make it completely smooth. I also doubled the spices.

Yum! I think the key is making sure you get the pumpkin pulp real smooth and creamy before mixing in the other ingredients. It took about 2 3/4 cup to make the 2 pies. (I used 2 deep dish Pre-made Marie Calendar's crusts.  After mixing it all up, I tasted it (I know, uncooked eggs are a no no but we all eat cookie dough and don't die) and added another 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg and a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice and allspice.  The recipe was a little confusing.  It said it made 2 pies, but it only talks about making one ball etc, like it was only for one crust.  Also, there would not have been enough filling had I not added more pulp (but maybe that was because I used deep dish pie shells).

I put the cooked pumpkin through my Foley Food Mill and then drained it in a strainer to remove all liquid.  

My husband says this is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made.  No more canned pumpkin for us!  I did increase the spices a little to taste.  This recipe now replaces the Libby's recipe.

Excellent recipe and so easy to make with ingrediants I have on hand.  I grow Cinderella pumpkins, peel and steam them, mash them and freeze them in bags.  The only thing I have found is that I need to put the thawed pumpkin through the blender before mixing it, as it comes out from the freezer bags stringy.  When first out of the freezer I put the frozen pumpkin in a strainer on top of some cheese cloth and let some of the water strain out.  Then I put the thawed pumpkin through the blender before mixing it.  AWESOME recipe - so moist and yummy!!!  This is a keeper!

Make sure you use a good sweet, cooking pumpkin.  Not the field pumpkins used for jack-o-lanterns - they are not the same.  The cooking pumpkin cooks up better, has more pumpkin flavor and is sweeter than the field pumpkins.  If I am going to all the work to roast pumpkin, I do several of them at one time and freeze the pumpkin in containers.  They will last throughout the winter and taste delicious each time.  I let the pumpkin thaw out in a colander over the sink. Perfect!

This was very basic, but very tastey. I found that boiling the pumpkin is so much easier than my past attempt with baking it in the oven. I would definitely use this recipe again :)

Very good.  Since I am in college and was unable to use anything more than a spoon, the pumpkin mash came out a bit chunky, but it cooked right into the pie and tasted great.  All my roommates loved it!

This was the first time we tried using fresh pumpkin.  My boys 9 and 10 loved the pie.  We made our second one and used eggnog.  It was awesome.  Our family will use fresh pumpkin forever!  We are sharing the recipe with my son's 5th/6th grade class and will be preparing the pie as a class project.

Very bland. Also, needed to bake an extra 10-15 minutes than noted. I would say double or even triple spices and include some cloves in the mix. Thanks anyways.

I added about 3/4 cup extra puréed pumpkin on the advice of another reviewer, made my own crust and only added the cinnamon out of the 3 spices listed.  I just increased the cinnamon to 2 tsps. I grew up eating pumpkin pie with cinnamon only and I still prefer it that way.  But all in all this is a very good recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe is great, when making a homemade fresh pumpkin pie the baker has to realize it won't have all the refined sugars and fake pumpkin extract tastes that the can gives. It is a different texture but it is absolutely delicious. I added twice the amount of brown sugar and vanilla and I cut the recipe in half for the mixture, and it turned out delicious. I suggest cooking it overnight before serving.

Love this yummy, easy recipe!  I followed some reviewers' advice and added 3/4 cup more pumpkin and extra spices (a little Allspice, doubled the cinnamon).  The result was two very full, very yummy pumpkin pies.  Thank you all!

I used a different recipe from this site to make the pumpkin puree, then used this one to make the pies. This crust is very easy and makes plenty of dough for two crusts. The filling is delicious; everyone loved it. My only complaint is that even using my shallowest pie plates, they were not quite full (as you can see in the photos). They also turned out speckled from the spices. I've never had that happen before! If I make it again, I'll try adding more pumpkin.
Update, I used a ready made crust and my deep dish this time and the filling amount is perfect for this size! You get only one pie though.

Texture was great, but the flavor was a bit bland.  I substitued pumpkin pie spice for the spices called for, but maybe I should've added a bit more.

I have made this pie for the last few years' holidays.  Oddly enough, I don't care for pumpkin so I have never actually tried my pies, but my family really likes it.  I strongly recommend using a blender or food processor to mash the pumpkin.  A hand blender doesn't cut up all the chunks well.  

For a Lactose free version, I like using almond milk, but any kind of lactose free milk good for cooking will do.

I made this as my first ever pie. As far as the filling goes, I had to mix 50/50 fresh & canned b/c my pumpkin was small, and I think I would prefer this to fully fresh pumpkin. It's hard to get the real pumpkin smooth. It also seemed a little too  mushy and creamy, so I think in the future I'd cut the evaporated milk a tad and replace with more pumpkin, maybe ~1/4 cup tradeoff. 

In case anyone else has never made pie crust before:
Listen to directions here. Cut the shortening in by hand, add the water slowly, don't overwork. I made a rookie mistake of using my stand mixer and overworking the dough resulted in a dense rather than light and flaky piecrust. Oops.

I have never liked pumpkin pies until I tasted one that my best friend made. Since then if it's not homemade from real pumpkins I just don't like it. I tried this recipe and I must say it was easy. i called her up and told her how i cooked the pumpkins and now she's even doing it. Thanks.Awesome!!!

This pie is the best, I made it the night before Thanksgiving with pie crust dough I had frozen from this recipe. Thawed out the dough followed the recipe and cut my prep time in half. I will never again used canned Pumpkin, this way is much more Delicious.  Put some LOVE into your pie!

I cooked in Italy, without canned pumpkin, canned milk, or brown sugar.  Directions are excellent for cooking a real pumpkin.   There was enough cooked pumpkin for two pies.  I substituted white sugar, fresh milk, and real pumpkin.  To my surprise, the pie was delicious.

This was ok, however, I didn't think it was worth the hassle. My husband and I both agreed that the regular recipe I use (with canned pumpkin & Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust) is just as good. And a recipe I make with canned pumpkin, cream cheese & a premade graham cracker crust is even better. If you enjoy spending hours in the kitchen & have time, go for it - otherwise, don't waste your time. Not that impressive.

Very good!  I used the Pureed Pumpkin recipe also on this site to make the pumpkin...as this was the first time I ever tried to make a pie from fresh pumpkin.  I did not use the crust recipe, I bought one as I was making a few other things today and didn't want to worry about the crust.  I would use this as my go-to recipe when I make pumpkin puree.

I took the lazy route and used 2 Tenderflake ready-made pie shells. With this recipe, I was able to make two pumpkin pies. I used canned pumpkin and added salt to taste. The pie was very creamy and delicious!

This was a very good pie.  I baked my pumpkin(a sugar/baking pumpkin) then let it cool.  I also added slightly more of the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg than the recipe called for and lowered the sugar slighly.  I also added 1/4tp cloves as well.  Otherwise it's a keeper.

Turned out great....although the texture was a little more dense then I like...although in all fairness, I am not the pumpkin pie fan in the house, my huby is and he thought it was great! Upped the amount of each of the spices by just a pinch, since we like our pumpkin pie a little spicier and added a pinch of black pepper(I ALWAYS do with pumpkin pie)...definitely make this again!

Delicious!! To make 2 deep dish pies I used 3 cups of puree, 3 eggs, 1 can evaporated mild, and increased spices to 1 teaspoon each. Will never go back to store bought pies or to using canned pumpkin again. Their taste just does not compare.

I don't think I will EVER eat anyone else's pumpkin pie! I did as others suggested and added about 1/2 a cup of pumpkin and 1/2 tsp of allspice. It came out perfectly! Today I am going to attempt making "deep dish" pies for a potluck this evening. Thank you so much for this recipe!  :-)

This pie was fabulous!!  The directions are so clear and it was much easier than I was expecting.  The spice amounts are perfect.  My roommates and I gobbled it down.  It was so much fun to see their faces when they tasted it since they were not expecting good things when I brought in actual pumpkins and said, "We're making it from scratch!"

Love this! I've never made pumpkin pie from a pumpkin before and I've got to say, it turned out great! I do agree with some of the reviews, this recipe is better for just one pie unless you want two flat ones. I made one and it was awesome! Not to spicy or sweet. A must try even if you're just starting out!

I usually just use the can for this but my daughter wanted to use the pumpkin she had got from a farm and make a fresh one. Wow, what a difference. It turned out perfect. Much better then the can!! A new holiday tradition for sure :)

Went over ok, cooked as recommended. However, it was neither "here nor there". Now very sweet, not very spicy. Will not use again.

Excellent recipe! I quartered my pumpkin and microwaved it 7 minutes per pound. I try to eat low fat, so I used fat-free evaporated milk and 1/2 cup egg substitute for the eggs. I omitted the salt and added 1/2 teaspoon allspice. I'm still experimenting with lower fat crusts.

great pie. although, i have to say that you can't tell the difference between fresh pumpkin and canned pumpkin. to me, it wasn't really worth going through the effort of roasting a pureeing the pumpkin when you can just by the canned version. none the less, a great tasting pie. canned or fresh. :)

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving Dinner. I live overseas and our pumpkin looks more like white squash so I added a carrot or two (our carrots are very small) for color. It did take longer to bake than the recipe called for but I think my oven was set at a lower temp from something I'd cooked just before this pie. At any rate, everyone loved it.

I found it easier & quicker to skin pumpkin, cut into small chuncks & use the meat grinder attachment on a kitchenaid. This cuts down the boiling time & makes pumpkin finer & more tender.

Really good recipe!  But we ended up with way too much crust left over and a very thin layer of pie.  What we had was delicious, though!

To shorten the cooking time, I peeled the pumpkin and cleaned out the seeds, until the pumpkin was completely clean. You can save the pumpkin seeds. Separate the seeds from the strings and you can clean the slime off of the seeds by putting them in a paper towel, or you can peel the pumpkin seeds, and put them on top of your pie for a beautiful garnish. The seeds are a delicious and nutritious garnish. You can save the pumpkin seeds for a snack or a protein shake. They are high in proteins and zinc. Then I grated the raw pumpkin using a grater. I put the peeled pumplin a bowl of water, and I used the very fine side of the grater. Soaking the pumpkin in water helps to make grating it very easy. I put the grated pumpkin in a pot and I added the sugar recommended. I put the cover on, and  I let it simmer on low heat for 20mins. I removed the pot and I put it in the sink to soak in a little cold water to cool the cooked pumpkin off quickly. I saved some time doing that, or you can cool it off in the fridge, I do that a lot. After the cooked pumpkin cooled down, I added all the other ingredients mentioned and I also added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, and 1 teaspoon of ground cardamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper to the entire mixture. The very finely grated pumpkin will continue to cook with all the other ingredients. I preheated the oven for 425 degrees, and I let it cook for 425 degrees for 15mins, and then I decreased the temperature to 350 degrees for 40 more minutes. D

This is a good recipe. I still prefer to bake the pumpkin (less water) and I used two ounces of sweetened condensed milk because I only had ten ounces of evaporated, didn't change the sugar at all and it was perfect. I also cooked it at 350 for the last twenty minutes to prevent the crust from burning. Overall, very good recipe with the right amount of spice.

im on an exchange in hungary right now, and I made this pie today for my family for christmas, and it was such a hit. 2 of my sisters went to america and had pumpkin pie there, and they both said that my pie was far better. I made one medium sized pie and 24 minis in muffin pans. Oh, I used a different crust recipe, but it was the filling that had me at hello. Im not one for sweets, so i nearly doubled the spices and it was terrific.

I have been making pumpkin pie from scratch for many years.  This is the amount of pumpkin I use for 1 pie. I usually cut up my pie pumpkins and place them face down on a cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or until tender.  Cool and scrape out pulp into a bowl and mash with hands to break up.  Package 2 cups per freezer bag and freeze.  When ready to make pie, thaw pumpkin and put pumpkin with the rest of ingredients into a blender and blend until pureed.  Pour into pie shell and bake.  You will have the most creamy and delicious pie ever with no lumps.

Made this using the pie crust I prefer with bakinf soda in it. This amount of filling is enough for one deep dish pie. Could add additional cinnamon for a spicier taste.

I still can't believe I made a pumpkin pie from a pumpkin!! It was delisious! I did change it a bit, added twice the spices and about 3/4 can of evaporated milk. Using the potato masher instead of food processor makes it a little chunky, but overall, it tasted excellant!!!!

THis recipe is wonderful. Although since pumpkins are already watery i baked it. Cut it in half after cleaning it, put it on a cookie sheet in a 350o oven for about 45 mins. Then once cooled i squeezed the remaining water out. Other than that it was wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! I know this will be a recipe used for many years to come!

The only thing I would do differently is make two batches of the pie filling for two pies.  The pumpkin part of the pie was a little thin for two pies using only the ingredients called for.  Tastes great!

I read a lot of reviews before attempting to make this (my first) pumpkin pie from scratch.  I doubled the seasonings and added a pinch of cornstarch to the pumpkin mixture as suggested in a review.  It turned out excellent!  My husband's mother bakes pumpkin pies every Thanksgiving.  Hers comes out watery once cut into.  Mine set up firm.  I had trouble getting the pumpkin mashed smooth.  Going to the blender first didn't work.  The blades didn't "take hold" of the small chunks.  I used a manual masher, then the electric mixer, and finally the blender to get the smooth consistency.  Though the final product was delicious, it was A LOT of work.  I've used canned pumpkin to make pies that turned out just as yummy.  I don't think it was worth all the time and hassle to use fresh pumpkin.  I'll stick to canned pumpkin.

This was the best pumpkin pie in the world!!!  I had frozen pumpkin that I had baked prior and worked excellent.  I added a bit more spices than the recipe calls for.  Everyone raved over this pie...saying how it melts in your mouth.  :)

I found that it didn't make quite 2 pies, otherwise it was a nice pumpkin pie.  I had never steamed pumpkin before, always baked it, so that was a nice change in preparation.

Wow, this is so good! I didn't make a pie crust, instead I used a premade one ( use a deepdish crust if you do the same).  I recommend adding a pinch of allspice to the filling to bring out a pumpkin spice flavor to it. And make sure you  mash/ blend the pumpkin well if you're (or who you're serving is) a person who's picky on texture.

I made as a custard because I was in a hurry, but I have made this standard crust before and it works. I like that this filling is not  overly sweet and is a quick fix, but it is quite neutral in flavor. I would change up the spices for our taste. Not my choice for a holiday pie.

Great recipe and easy to make. But, it takes much longer than 40 minutes to bake. I've made this recipe more than a dozen times (it's that good), and every single time it takes at least 10 minutes longer (probably closer to 20 minutes longer). Also, with my Kitchen Aid, I beat the eggs with the brown sugar, then add the spices and salt, then add the pumpkin, and lastly the evaporated milk. To make this in any other order I find the ingredients do not blend well. (I'm sure the order of ingredients wouldn't matter much if you an immersion blender though.) Order of ingredients is important in (almost) all recipes!

Excellent recipe.  I have some veteran pumpkin pie fans in our family, and they've all told me this is the best they've ever had...high praise!

Aside from adding a bit of allspice, the only other change I made was how I prepare the pumpkin.  Rather than boil (where the pumpkin loses a lot of flavor, in my opinion), I roast it.  Cut the pumpkin in half, discard seeds and innards, and place face down/skin up on a cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 for about an hour, or until skin starts to blister and you see caramelization and liquid bubbling on the cookie sheet.  Take it out of the oven and let cool for 20 minutes or so, then simply peel the skin off, toss the pulp (and the caramelized stuff) into a bowl and mash with a potato masher.  The roasting process converts much of the starches into sugar (making the pulp sweeter), while also providing some nice nutty/roasty character to the pumpkin.

We made this recently.  I prepared my fresh pumpkin by oven roasting it and then scooping it out.  I think the brown sugar really was a key here.  Be careful to really mix up the eggs before adding though, as I ended up with a few eggy spots.

The taste of the pie was awesome. Regarding the instruction about using a potato masher for the fresh cooked pumpkin; I did use a potato masher but next time I will certainly use the Kitchen Aid instead. The rest of the instruction was good except that it did not yield 2 pies. One of my pies was a 9 inch pie and the other a 10 inch so they were fairly large. It yielded one 9 inch pie. I had to make another batch for the other.

The difference between this and the canned "pumpkin pie" is obvious.  Once you have had it fresh, you can never go back.  Loved this recipe.  I also cut out little leaves and pumpkins, sprinkle them with cinnamon, and bake them for 10 minutes, then arrange them on the semi-cooled pie for a festive look.

I made the pie exactly as written, and it was very good -- just a little too sweet for me, that's why I took off one star. I might try it with just half a cup of brown sugar next time.

The filling looked too liquid at first, but it set up nicely in the oven. I think a final note should be to let the pie rest for at least an hour before cutting into. That's probably common knowledge for experienced bakers, but to a novice it is helpful to state.

I certainly loved this recipe!

The reason why I didn't give it a five star rating was I couldn't believe that the amount of filling could fit two 8" OR 9" pie pans. The amount of crust though was way to much for a single pie so I baked mine in a 9 X 13 inch pan using the same amount of ingredients then cut them into rectangles. I find these smaller servings just right for a big meal with multiple other desserts to choose from. 

I added a bit more spices than called for in the recipe as suggested by numerous readers.

It turned out great!

I have same reciepe the only difference I do is use store bought pie crust (deep dish) use 18% cream instead of evporated milk (makes it very creamy and thicker).  And use pumpkin pie spice.  Been doing this for about 20 yrs now.  Its my family favorite.

I made the pie crust with my own recipe I only followed the filling part in the recipe . Two things I didn't like , the first thing the pie wasn't sweet enough , may be the pumpkin it self wasn't  sweet and  the sugar amount meant to be for the sugar pumpkin , what I had was the regular pie pumpkin . The second thing I didn't like was that there is a lack of spices , something was missing , it needed more cinnamon and allspice or cloves ,

to get mashed pumpkin, I bake my fresh pumpkins.  After cutting in 1/2 and removing seeds and stringy stuf.  I cut down to fit on jelly jool pans and bake at 350 degree for 1/2 or so depending on oven  and thicken of pumpkin.  Add little water to bottom of pans for moisture while baking.  Test with a fork for tender nes and softness like a bake potatoe when done.  Then when cool scoop out of outer skin and blender to smoothness with a blender.  Puree setting works great.    Mom & Aunt show me this as a kid. We are keeping the tradation going down the generation!!  Fun stuff!!!  Happy Baking!!  Also works with zucchini.

Noticing some remarksabout not so much pumpkin flavor  if you get pumpkin pie pumpkin it will taste better.  your regular large pumpkin are different tasting.  just use more spices as some are suggesting!!

This was my first attempt to make pies from a fresh pumpkin. I knew it had to be cooked, but I had no idea how to do it. The instructions at the bottom of the recipe are perfect and very easy.  My pumpkin was big enough to have two dutch ovens full to cook, but they steam perfectly with the inch or two of water in the bottom of the pot.  After cooling, they peeled so easily.  I then put them in my electric mixer and didn't add anything and just let it mix.  All the strings wrap around the beaters.  Just take the beaters out and wash off. I had to do it twice per bowl. So don't rake off the pumpkin from the beaters, just take them off and wash the strings away. I also do this on my sweet potato pies.  If you add any liquid, it will not remove them.  We do not care for the cinnamon, nutmeg or ginger; just cooked them plain and they were magnificent. I had to cook about 50 minutes, but that could have been the difference in the ovens.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over. Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I used just about this exact one last year and tried this one today as well.  The only difference being that I add about 1 Tbsp of finely minced onion per 9" pie.  You don't taste the onion but it sure gives the flavor some extra color, so to speak.

Came out Great. I'm not suprized as only good ingreadients went in. I used a gram cracker pie pan and dark ( Not light) brown sugar then garnished with some pecan nuts for eye apeal. Just a twist to give it a more maple flavor.

I made this pumpkin pie with a store bought frozen pie crust, I'm terrible at making pastry dough.

I actually didn't add the condensed milk because of a lactose intolerance, and it turned out to be the most amazing pumpkin pie ever. Even friends who are used to the condensed milk versions, they LOVED IT. Try it!

The crust turned out great! I unfortunately realized I was short on some of the spices a tad to late (no nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon left! substituted some crushed cloves) :/, but the pie still turned out. Using fresh pumpkin makes all the difference!!!

Wow, this was sensational!! It wasn't as hard to do as I thought it would be. I'm not much of a cook or baker, just got a whim and thought I'd try it out. I personally think is tastes like the canned stuff, but with a different texure. It has been a long time since I've had pumpkin pie though. Who knows? It's delicious!  I prepared the pumpkin the day before I cooked the pie. And I don't have a potato masher, so I just used my hands to mash and drain it. It wasn't watery at all! Nice and thick :) Oh, I also cut the recipe in half.   I used a little more than a cup of pumpkin too :)

I followed this recipe initially but,  I realized I had disposable pie pans that measured 9 11/16 x 1 1/3 inches and this recipe only fills one of these pie pans.  This changed the baking time, 15mins @ 425 and 50 mins @ 350.  I also used 1 1/2 tspns of pumpkin spice instead of the individual spices  and I mixed a can of fat free evap milk with one regular can to lower the fat (I made two pies)  My family loved it.

Very tasty! A great treat for guests and family. I changed it a little by adding some vanilla starch into the whole pumpkin mixture and replaced the white flour with whole wheat, it was amazing! Rich and tasty flavor. Delish!

This has a Great crust but not enough spices in the mix, it just tasted bland so that's why I gave it only 4 stars.  It needs more of all the spices.  It also took me 10 more min. cooking time.   Thanks for sharing

Loved this recipe.  It worked up and baked up so nicely.  Absolutely loved the abcense of cloves.  Too many people overpower the pie with clove.  Great job.  All who tried the recipe loved the pie.  I have my own crust recipe and I also use graham cracker crust as well, so I didn't use that part of recipe.

This is a very delicious pumpkin pie recipe.  I did not drain the pumpkin throughly and it still turned out fantastic.  I made one for my family and one for my Mother in law.  I can't wait for her to try it!

I personally don't like pumpkin pie but have two sons who love it.  They absolutely raved about it and said it was the best pumpkin pie ever.  It was great because I got to use up the pumpkins we bought for Halloween.  I had plenty of pumpkin, so cooked, mashed and froze it.  When we want pumpkin pie, I just get some out of the freezer and make this up.

The pie was absolutely delicious. I did do a couple of things differently, however.
I used a pumpkin that was about 3 lbs, which made about 2 cups of mashed pumpkin. I would recommend using a little more pumpkin with this recipe or a little less crust.
I also baked the pumpkin for about an hour on 425 instead of boiling it. The skin peeled right off.
I cut the recipe in half and the first time there was too much crust/too little filling. The second time I made less crust b/c I was out of pumpkin. 
Did as the others did an added more cinn & other spices.
Overall, great recipe, great pie. My husband and I loved it!

My 1st attempt at a pumpkin pie from scratch!  It turned out great!  I do agree with another reviewer about doubling up on the spices!  I would even add another pinch just if you like it spiced up like I do!

I tried this recipe about 4 yrs ago. We bought a huge pumpkin because I was learning to cook and my husband wanted fresh pumpkin pie. I have carpal tunnel and  he had to help seperate the pumpkin from the rind.
I don't use the crust in the recipe. I use a ready made 9 inch graham cracker crust. The filling actually fills both nicely. 
Ovens vary, so keep in mind that you may need to cook the pie up to an extra 20 minutes.
Thank you Mr. Scott. I keep using this recipe year after year after year after...

Perfect! Not too sweet, not too spicy, fresh flavor.
I baked the pumpkin in the oven instead of on the stove, which makes the prep time a lot shorter. Once baked I mixed it in the blender to make it real smooth.
The proportion of spices was spot on. The two pies came out a little 'thin', but then again it made everyone less guilty about getting another piece.
The baking time is longer than suggested, probably by about 10 minutes.

I'm not a pumpkin pie fan, but my husband is a pie fanatic. He was skeptical of trying this thinking it wasn't going to be like his mom's. He loved it so much that he asked if I would make more. I used my own pie crust recipe and increased the amount of cinnamon. It was so easy to make and made the house smell wonderful.

The pie was very tasty. The crust is simple but a really good contrast with the sweet and spicey filling. I added a little extra pumpkin and a pinch of the spices to make sure I had enough filling, and it worked out great.

I was really looking for a pie that was outstanding and this just isnt it. Although the flavor was really good, I used double spice 1/4 cp more sugar and a bit more pumpkin than called for I cant imagine how it would have came out had I not. The pumpkin was chunky and I know I steamed it long enough because it was very tender to mash. The pie was not at all firm enough for my liking even after baking slightly longer. I did'nt even have enough filling for the second pie. I thought it was just OK. I am really shocked to say this but I prefer my canned recipe way better. I wont try this again but I will continue to try and find a recipe that wow's my family. I gave it 3 stars for a fairly put together homemade version.

This is probably the best pumpkin pie we've ever had.  It is light and airy and the taste is very suttle.  We followed the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing.  My boyfriend and I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing.

I had a couple of problems while making this pie - firstly my pumpkin cooked down a lot more than I expected and I ended up with less than two cups, and secondly I made a mistake when scaling down the recipe and ended up accidentally using only half the right amount of evaporated milk.  Still, the pie was delicious.  My husband thought it wasn't firm enough - I don't know whether that is to be expected from fresh pumpkin pie or if it was the result of using too little evaporated milk, but I tried cooking the pie for another forty minutes and it was a bit firmer and more to my husband's liking after that.  We both thought it tasted great, though!

Delicious!! I've never eaten nor made pumpkin pie before this.  I found this recipe, it sounded simple enough, had excellent ratings. Well deserved.  My whole family loved it!! Though I do believe I need to double the recipe to truly fit to pies.  It made 2 rather skimpy pies as is. Scrumptious, but not deep dish at all.

The recipe itself is nothing special.  After looking through pumpkin pie recipes on this site and from manufacturers like Eagle, they all use 2 cups pumpkin, 1 can evaporated or sweetened condensed milk, two eggs, and sugar and spices.  However, when I made it with fresh pumpkin, there was a huge difference in taste between my pie and one from the supermarket.  This pie won't rate high on the presentation though, because using fresh pumpkin gives you a stringy batter, no matter how many times you hand blend it.  Cooking the pumpkin was a lot of trouble too, and my brother, who has used canned and fresh pumpkin, said that the difference between the two is neglible.

I've made pumpkin pie for years, always using a different recipe - this is the only recipe I will use from now on - it was fabulous!  Be sure to use sugar or cinderella pumkins, they are the best for pie.

This was a great recipe for pumpkin pie! I've made it a bunch of times, and it always turns out great. We tried a variety of different pumpkins that we grew in our own garden. The pumpkin you use definitely influences the flavor of the pie.

I probably made this pie about ten times with fresh pumpkin. I found it easier to put the gutted cut chunks of pumpkin in a cake pan and put about an inch of water in and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. I then checked it and moved them around if they weren't all soft and left them for about 15 more minutes. 
The first time I made the pie it turned out a little chunky so I actually blended the pumpkin with some evaporated milk. Then I put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, then I baked it as directed.

First time making pumpkin pie. Used pumpkin I had frozen from the garden. Put pumpkin into a strainer to remove excess water as it thawed. Doubled spices. Pie came out PERFECTLY after 1 hour. Pre-baked crust for 15 minutes prior to filling.

Used premade crust.  
Subbed splenda for the brown sugar and only used cinnamon and ginger.  
It did need to bake an extra 10-15 minutes.  
My family thought it was one of the best pumpkin pies they've ever had.

It is a pretty good pie. It makes one full 9” pie. I put the pie crust onto a baking sheet, poured half the mixture in, set it on the oven rack so half of it was still sticking out, poured the rest in, and slowly pushed it in the rest of the way. Only spilt a quarter sized amount while pushing it in the rest of the way. When you fill it up completely it does look like it might overflow but it doesn't. It baked beautifully. I did have to bake it a little longer then recommended.

This turned out pretty good. I added a little more spice and used almost 3 cups of mashed sugar sweet pumpkins. The texture was good, too- better than the super smooth canned pumpkin.

Not quite perfect, but very, very good! I used baked pumpkin that I had pureed and allowed to drain for a thick, super dense pie. I followed this recipe almost exactly as written, but added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of allspice. Bake at 400F for only 15-20 minutes and then reduce the temp to 350F for another 30-40+ minutes. No leftovers!

I really like this recipe, however I find it usually takes longer than 40 minutes to be fully cooked.

I'm not sure what I've done wrong but my filling has came out so liquidy? I'm having to double the pumpkin quantity. Hopefully that helps but it's not looking great...

For our family, we wanted more spice. I baked the pumpkins (cut in half in the shell w/seeds) because the oven cooks and evaporates excess moisture. Pie at room temp was a bit soft, but once refrigerated was A-OK.

The flavor is outstanding!  Just right!  I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies. And I used pumpkin puree I made myself.  My cook time was almost 70 minutes though.  My puree may have been a  bit too runny.

But even with the longer cook time, the pies were absolutely fantastic!  Can't wait to make them for Thanksgiving dinner for the whole family.

Made this pie following all of the instructions however I left the cooked pumpkin a little moist and it was still very warm when I mixed it together for the filling. As a result the pie was very moist, held together very well, and tasted better than store bought pie! I also used cinnamon sugar on the crust. It was my first time ever baking a pie and it was such a success! However my crust was super dry at top, definitely because it was my first time making crust but the pie was still a hit !

This being my first time making anything from scratch it took me FOREVER to make.  but that’s being said, it tastes phenomenal! I did use some suggestions from other inquirers like doubling the ingredients, which I don’t believe was necessary for me because I had enough to make 2 pies and still had leftovers. I also added 1tsp of allspice and 2tsp of cornstarch (to thicken the mix because it SEEMED too watery to me.. but again it’s my 1st time) when it was done cooling and I FINALY got to try it, IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. But the consistency was a little mushy?... so I’m not sure if that’s just the way it is or if I could have adjusted something... maybe the cook time or strain the purée? Also, for the crust, I had to add 3 extra tbs (totaling 7) just for the crust to BARELY hold together. All in all... I just need more practice.

My wife made this and while it seemed easy we tripled it to make 2 deep dish pies. 
It seemed that she boiled the pumpkin and therefore there was a lot of excess liquid which made it harder to gauge the correct amount of milk to add, only 2cans for a tripled recipe. 
Also she used pumpkin pie spice and we used about 3T of it. Increased the brown sugar to 3cups total and added 1 1/2 c sugar to make it as sweet as I like. Not too shabby. 
Next time the pumpkin needs to be baked though so the ratios are better off....

Well, I'm on my second added 10 minutes. After the 40 minutes specified it is still super runny. So it has now been 55 minutes and still very runny in the middle, while the top and crust are getting really dark (even with crust guard). This is for a dinner tonight so I really hope it turns out ok. Did anyone else have this problem? I don't get it. I don't want to even take it to the dinner party but don't have time to make another dessert. After 60 minutes it's finally done but almost burned.  Crust very dark; center of pie is starting to burn...

I loved this recipe. I used my instant pot to cook the pie pumpkin and then strained it in a fine mesh strainer for an hour. It was cooked so fine I'm not even sure that the run through in the blender was necessary. 

It was my first time making pie, at all! First time making crust and I really invested time into properly cutting the shortening into the flour. Based on some reviews I decided to buy pumpkin spice and I used two teaspoons of it in total. It came out amazing!! Tasty, beautiful, everything. I watched a video on how to crimp the pie crust as this recipe was missing some helpful hints. But that's all it was missing!! It really has me impressed that I made this!! I have another pie pumpkin I saved in case this recipe sucked, well, I'm making the same recipe tonight! I can't wait.

I made it, the crust came out really well, but the problem was the pumpkin filling didn’t taste good enough. I think it will be better with more spices,also using cream cheese in the filling instead of condensed milk make it taste creamier.

Great recipe. What I changed to make fantastic. Don’t boil. Roast. Simply cut in half and bake 374 about 1hr. Depend on size of pumpkin When it starts sinking and you stab with knife and it has consistency of baked potatoes. Skin up, poke holes. Cool. Easily scoop out all seeds/strings, flip over and slip off the skin. Mash. Secondly. If your going to the trouble to use a pumpkin use fresh ginger.. a little more than dry measure..and fresh nutmeg, use a little less then dry measure . I also added a dash of molasses to the turbinado sugar I used. Like 1 Tb approximately. was amazing.  I almost forgot!! Add 1/4 teaspoon cloves or allspice ( I love Cloves) no more than 1/4 teaspoon per pie!! ( don’t use both!!)And I double the salt, a overflowing teaspoon of pink salt ground. I also increased the cinnamon ( Ceylon cinnamon, there IS a difference) to 1.5 teaspoon. It’s amazing good  luck!!

2nd time I’ve made this pie. The consistency is very dependant on the pie pumpkin you use. I added another egg at the end to ensure it would set up. I have tried my 2” cast iron pie plate. As other pie recipes I started the pie at 425 for 15 minutes and ended up cooking it another 65 minutes at 350. The pie looks lovely

Absolutely loves this recipe. All the family loved it. I roasted the pumpkins in the oven at 400 degrees like one review suggested. It was perfect! :)

My first pumpkin pie and it tasted awesome; however, it was a little too fluid and took an extra 10 minutes to cook which left a burnt crust. Will adjust with 2 oz. less evaporated milk next time. 
One thing different: I made one nine inch pie and it was filled to the rim almost. I was not disappointed with the results but will adjust the recipe for a thicker/larger pie.

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I've made that turns out consistent results. I used a  jack-o-lantern pumpkin to make this every time and it always turns out beautifully. This is definitely one of my favourite dessert recipes!

I made this recipe and it turned out perfectly! I steam large pumpkins and process them in a food processor because I like how smooth the pumpkin is. This can create problems because the pumpkin has a lot more liquid in it than roasted pumpkin. To compensate, I used a 5 oz can of milk and added an extra egg. I also had pumpkin pie spice so I added 1 1/2 t of that to match the spices in the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

Filling was way to liquid and took longer for it firm up. Not enough spice. Pie filling was bland. 
Will adjust recipe next time.

This was really good, but it only filled one 8-inch pie crust with about 1 cup leftovers.  it could use a bit more spice,but it was still very tasty!

This recipe produces a really good pumpkin pie, a classic.  Next time, the only thing I would change is to increase the spices a bit.  Otherwise, this pie is a winner.

It was tasty and turned out well.  One person opined that it should be sweeter, but the pumpkin taste was delicious.  I appreciate how detailed the recipe was for making the mashed pumpkin.  The little pumpkin that I used made plenty of mash.  So, I'll look for a muffin recipe that will use it.

I made this for last nights Thanksgiving fest and had to make another tonight because there was no leftovers. I used a pre made rolled pie crust, didn't have time for a crust and since 2 crusts come in a box, well....I did substitute the 1/2 t ginger and nutmeg with 1T of pumpkin pie spice. No complaining from the family. Tonight I had barely the 3/4 C brown sugar, so we'll see how it turns out.

Great recipe! The pie crust is very tasty - I substituted some butter for the shortening to give the crust more flavor. The ratio was 3:1 shortening to butter. Everything was added cold to the flour. My only issue is that the center of the pie did not set this time around - but I kept it to the 40 min recommended baking time. I’ve baked it for 50-55 min and the center is fine but then I get some scorching of the pie and some cracks. Wondering if I should add a third egg - I used two jumbo eggs. Great recipe. Another note - I double the quantity of spices and keep the salt the same. I think the pie gets better flavor that way. And I add a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling.

Ew. My family hated this pie. We didn't eat it for desert. Instead, I ended up whipping up a batch of brownies. I wouldn't recommend this. I don't know if it's just our own personal taste that is different, but this wasn't good.

I've used this recipe every year for the last 4 years. I love this pie. The only thing I do differently is I bought pumpkin oue spice, which has all the required ingredients. I add 1tbsp and it's perfect. Also I always get 2 pies from this recipe.

We love this recipe! Will be using only this from now on. Although, I found the cooking time to be inaccurate. I have had to bake my pie at least an hour and a half both times I’ve made the recipe.

I agree with others when I say once you try fresh pumpkin you will never buy canned again! All of my friends and neighbors look forward to pie season lol I found it super easy to bake the pumpkin by cutting it in half and putting it cut side down on aluminum foil on a baking tray. I cooked it for about 40 minutes to an hour at 375. skin peeled away and the pumpkin was soft enough to hand mash.

I always made my pumpkin pies this way but didn’t like how watery the pumpkin was.  Now I cut the pumpkin in half, scoop out the seeds and place it cut side down on a baking sheet.  Roast in a 200 degree oven for 1 1/2hrs.  Carefully peel off the skin and purée the pulp.   Voila!

I dont boil the pumpkin, I got it and bake it at 375° for 45 minutes, mash it, then strain it in a fine wire mesh sieve about 1 hour to remove excess liquid. It makes a better pie, not as wet. The pie will be more yellow because the color change happens when the fresh pumpkin is canned!
One all mixed, I baked mine at 400° for about 48 minutes. I made a 10" pie.
Otherwise a great recipe. I think if you boil it, mash then seive it for an hour or 2. Use the liquid in pumpkin cookies or veggie soup.

This was probably the best fresh pumpkin pie I've ever made!  The only thing I did differently was bake the pumpkin vs boil it. I bake it at 325 degress until the pumpkin is done. I did it the day before and stored a few containers that measured the 2 cups of mashed pumpkin in the refrigerator. That made it convenient to put together the next day. I shared at work and everyone wanted the recipe!

Just started cooking at the age of 33. I made four pies and they turned out great. My first time making a pie. I used a sour cream dough instead but the pie filling was very easy to make. I added a tsp of lemon zest.

I mixed everything but decided i wanted a smoother puree for my  pie, so I ran it in the Vitamix for a little bit to get a smoother texture.  It turned out perfectly.  I used a store bought crust.  I will take the time to make  the vodka pie crust that I love next time.

This is my first time ever making pumpkin pie, and to my surprise it was a success. I didn’t have any evaporated milk, instead I had some condensed milk(about 6oz), I mixed it with low fat milk to reach 12 oz (as in the 2 pies recipe in the video) then warmed it up in the microwave and stirred it well;  and it worked just fine and the pie came out really tasty. I roasted the sliced pumpkin wedges in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes then peeled after it cooled, then puréed it in the food processor. I highly recommend this recipe.

The only thing I changed was that I did not add salt. The end result was an outstanding, moist and extremely good tasting pie, (and this is coming from a pumpkin anything critic). There's nothing I would change in the future when making this pie.

This is the best pumpkin pie from scratch recipe I’ve found. The only problem is that it takes much longer to bake, but that may be because I’m high altitude.

Love this recipe. When using ‘Grandma’s   I have found that I need to bake this 60 minutes or the pie isn’t firm in the middle. I can stick a probe/knife in it and it comes out.

I made this pie for thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it! I used this recipe to make 1 pie. After watching the video and reading the recipe, I think the confusion about the lack of enough filling for two pies is that the video shows two pies being made,  but the recipe is only for 1 pie. This will be my go-to anytime I want to make pumpkin pie from now on. On a side note.... I use fresh pumpkin a LOT and there is an easier way than boiling it. Just cut the pumpkin in half and stick it face down in the oven at 350-400 degrees until the skin starts to look like leather and is starting to separate from the flesh.  I scoop the seeds out after baking because I find them easier to remove. Then, once the pumpkin has cooled down to a safe temperature to handle and the seeds are out, I just scoop the flesh out of the skin with a spoon and put it in the blender.... and that's it.... pumpkin ready for all of your baking needs

I made this for thanksgiving and was skeptical because so many people have told me they preferred canned pumpkin pie over fresh. But, this recipe is to die for!!! It turned out great and everyone said it was the best pumpkin pie they have ever had! The only change I made to the recipe was that I used a French-style churned butter instead of shortening for the crust. I can’t wait for pumpkins to come back in season so I can make another one!!!

I like this pie more than store-bought! (unfortunately my brother feels the opposite) I doubled all the spice measurements expect nutmeg, and used a heaping 3/4 cup full of brown sugar.  It's not too sweet and the consistency is perfect to my tastes. I won't give it 5 stars though, because my brother isn't as into it as I am!

Tip: use a blender
Makes 2 pies perfectly.

This was an utterly delicious pie exactly as given! (OK, i didn't measure the grated nutmeg, there might have been a smidge more). There was more than enough for a large pie with some filling left over, if doubled, this recipe would probably make 3 pies! Saved to make again and again...

As is, it was very good. But it was missing something to make it great, so I will read some reviews and try some of their ideas.

I amazed myself! Actually cooking the pumpkin, the whole process... and the taste was phenomenal! I love cinnamon so I did use 1 tsp instead of just 1/2 and a sprinkle more ginger and nutmeg. The only thing missing from this recipe that needed to be added was clove! Now it's perfect! 1/4 - 1/2 tsp depending on how much you like. The crust I also made from scratch. Better than store bought and better than from the can! A must try! HOWEVER... I did not see anywhere that it makes TWO pies!!! So instead of one for Thanksgiving we had 2 (the recipe for the crust fit a foil pan that was 8 3/4" better than it fit my 9" glass pie crust  dish). And I had to bake it for about 45 minutes.

Very good! Changes coconut milk for milk and I halved sugar pumpkin and sweet potato mainly for pretty orange color. Baked them at 400 until tender cooled then pureed. I did sprinkle in cloves.  Delicious!

Besides the burnt crust, which was my fault, the pie is so yummy! I upped the brown sugar and added a 1/2tbs of cloves.

This pie didn’t turn out for me. The pumpkin purée took so long to cook (way longer than the suggested time) and so the crust was over cooked. Bummer too, because it took a long time to make.

Baked my Pumpkin came out great.  It did not seem watery when I pureed it.  Baked it and it came out watery.  I was wondering if it was the Altitude since I am at 18oo ft.  Great Taste and Flavor!

If your oven is like mine and you leave it in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, it will still be soupy and the crust will be black. I would recommend following a different recipe's instructions for temperature and duration in oven.

Use this recipe every year and my family can’t get enough! I recommend doubling the spices. That helps with flavor and makes the pies perfect! I also cheat with the crust and buy the pre-made pans that you can find in the freezer section of your local grocery store. Perfect holiday delight!

Turned out nice.  I will add some cloves next time but that is personal preference.  I followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.   I since I had frozen pie crusts in the freezer, I used them and it filled them perfectly.

I was super pleased with this recipe. This was my first time making pumpkin pie from scratch, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This recipe results in a pie that is slightly less sweet than store bought pies, which was a nice change for us.

I made it for Thanksgiving dinner with a couple of sugar pie pumpkins and it was very nice...I used two cups of pumpkin puree and made one large pie.  Was perfect for that.  I like it because it turned out well, cooked well...set well...and the recipe is very simplistic.  Which I like in a recipe and you are always free to add whatever you wish to any basic recipe like this...you want more cinnamon, some all spice, some cardoman...just put it in...no law against it.  Good cooks play with their recipes all the time.

I have made this several times already this season!  I use fresh pumpkin puree.  I have made variations using fresh ground cinnamon, cloves, and fresh ginger.  Tastes great and sweetness can be brought up or down with the sugar.

I used two small pumkins left over from the grandkids school halloween party, they produced just over 2 cups of puree, so I used it all. I was also short 2 ounces of condensed milk so used 2 ounces of whipping cream to supliment. As per other reviews I added 1/8 tsp ground clover. It was necessary to add about 15 minutes to the bake time. Great pie, had a hard time resisting a second serving.

I found it was far too runny.  Didn't set properly baking. I made a second one with just a 1/4 can of evaporated milk, and it was better.  I don't know why it was so thin.

This review is only for the pumpkin filling, we used premade pie shells.

Made it with a single sweet cooking pumpkin that my 5 year old son brought home from the school visit to the UBC farm. He is a natural delight in the kitchen. It was a lot of fun making it together. I followed the recipe: the pumpkin we had came in just a hair under 1.5lbs. I put a little bit of extra spices. I added about 2/3 the sugar. We put it into 12 small premade graham cookie 3" tart shells. This only used up about 1/2 of the pumpkin, so I will be making more soon :-)

We ate it with real spray on whip cream. I found I could taste the condensed milk a bit more than I wanted to. My mum found the consistency a bit heavy. When I was mixing the pumpkin I added the milk and the eggs last as we were rushed and I was giving the pumpkin time to cool. I liked the taste of the pure pumkin and spices better than the final product.

So my recommendation is to up the pumpkin content and maybe half the condensed milk, and 2/3 the eggs.

I think I will do that to the remaining portion and report back.

thank you for the recipe!

The spice level is mild on this pumpkin pie recipe. I love fresh pumpkin pie in general and this is a good one if you are not much of a cinnamon fan.

I took other's advice and increased the spices to 1t each. I also simmered my pumpkin on low heat until it was closer to the thickness of canned pumpkin. This was on of the best pumpkin pies I have made and will use this recipe again.

THIS RECIPE IS JUST FOR ONE PIE. I used a deep dish pre-made pie crust and canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling, just pumpkin) instead. I DOUBLED the recipe for two pies but for some reason I had a lot of filling left- like enough for half of another deep dish pie. After 40 mins of cooking my two pies the knife did not come out clean so they did need to be cooked a bit longer but otherwise this was a very easy recipe!

Haven't tasted it yet but it smells wonderful. I'm giving it a five because I'm confident it will knock it out if the park, but I wish I would have added a pinch of allspice.  Also my crust making skills are lacking, I don't blame the recipe but you should learn about making pie crusts to enjoy this recipe.   I don't know what some people read but I used this recipe for 1 pie, not 2.

We bought some end of season pumpkins and decided to try this recipe. I loved the texture, and the flavors were excellent with a nice ginger accent. If you want a slightly more traditional flavor, add a little allspice, but I prefer the flavors of this recipe "as is". This will be our go-to recipe for pumpkin pie from now on.

Pro tip: Instead of the time-consuming saucepan action, you can just microwave the pumpkin and then scoop out the soft cooked meat with a spoon... just halve pumpkin and put in the microwave facedown, microwave at 600w for 5-10 mins depending on size of pumpkin, all done.  it really rocked my world when I found out about this.

about the recipe: the recipe is certainly sound, but 
a)I had to about double the baking time, and got a slightly speckled if delicious cake with a perfect consistency
b) I would definitely cut down on the sugar next time. it is just sooo sweet.
c) wish I had put just a tiny bit more ginger. i also added chinese five spice, because I wanted to change it up a bit, and that was certainly worthwhile.

It turned out wonderful, my fresh pumpkin was really moist so I only added 8 ounces of the evaporated milk and a slight 1/8 tsp of cloves. Delicious.

It was so good! I made mine a little different though. I used coconut milk instead of evaporated milk (just the thick stuff at the top of the can not the liquid at the bottom). And I added cloves instead of ginger. Lovely pie!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! It was so good with the fresh pumpkin. It really makes a difference. However I scooped out the guts of my pumkin, cut it into slices and cooked it pumpkin in the oven @ 375. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I baked the pie with no changes.  The filling is not overly sweet but it was a little 'soft' for my taste and seemed to be missing something in the spice department.

Absolutely perfect! Tastes great! I used 2 cups of my own pumpkin puree and I added 1/4 cup of flour to prevent it from cracking and filled up 2 deep dish pastry shells. I will keep this recipe.

I doubled the recipe & made 2 pies!  As for changes to the recipe - I roasted my pie pumpkins instead of boiling them, added a pinch of allspice, a pinch of ground cloves & a teaspoon of vanilla for each pie (so I added 2 tsp. for my double recipe).

I added my own little twist on this and it came out perfect. I did 1 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves. Also, dont boil the pumpkin! It comes out tooo watery!
Slice it up and bake it ungreased at 350 for 45 minutes. The skin peels right off, and i prefer no skin in my puree.

I have NEVER made a pie before, let alone a pie from scratch. I normally do the thaw and bake method with pre-made pies. However, my son specifically bought pumpkins to make pumpkin pie with and I found this recipe. 
Now, I have always, for my entire life, only liked pumpkin pie from Frisches Big Boy. I just never liked how others tasted. So, I was a little leary when making this one. I am happy to say that I am VERY pleased with this pie! I added some clove and all spice when I made it, I bought the wrong amount of evaporated milk (was 2 oz short) and had to use 1c of canned pumpkin pie because I didn't bake enough pumpkin, but the pie turned out amazing! I only made 1 pie with the recipe and used the rest to make mini donut shaped pumpkin pies. SO GOOD!! I will be using this recipe from now on!

I love this recipe. I get pumpkins in the fall and like to make fresh pie. Although I tried to drain as much moisture as I could from the pumpkin, I still found I had to bake the pie about fifteen more minutes

Very good recipe! Came out really great! I would let the pumpkin drain for like an hour or so cause mine came out a little watery. But over all very good!

I didn't use the crust part of this recipe - I had lard at home, my grandmother's go-to staple for pastry, so I used a pastry recipe for lard instead. But I did make the filling using this recipe. I was a little (lot) uncertain about the consistency of the filling once I had made it - it was *very* liquidy. But it firmed up beautifully once it was baked. I used Jarrahdale pumpkin for superior smooth texture and flavour - and my nephews, who "don't like pumpkin pie" enjoyed it just as much as the rest of us did!

Very good and easy to make. I used lard instead of shortening for the shell. I also doubled the batter and was able to make 2 8in pies and 12 cupcake sized!

Love this recipe except I added cloves and all spice 1/2 tsp each and about 1/2 tsp more of the other spices . Portions were right just depends how  much your pumpkin yealds. Will make again. Paired well with vanilla frozen yogurt this also works well with store bought crust too.

This was so easy! I tasted like a traditional pumpkin pie but very silky smooth. It does make alot of filling so I had to use a 9 inch DEEP pie shell and still had filling left. I baked it for 46 minutes and it was perfect. I will definately make this again & keep it in my files.

Good pie! I substituted condensed milk for the evaporated and reduced the added sugar. Baked the pumpkin halves for 30 minutes and will roast the seeds later.

My kids wanted me to try a pumpkin pie with fresh pumpkin, instead of the canned pumpkin. It was an absolute hit. This will be the recipe I use for the future.

This is a great pie base, but I found some slight tweaks made it perfect: 4 cups fresh cooked puréed pumpkin, 1 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk, and 1 full teaspoon of ginger.

I made some changes to the original recipe to make it a 5. Instead of fighting with a raw pumpkin, bake the sugar pumpkin whole for about an hour. Let it drain in a strainer in the sink overnight, then cut it and gut it. The skin should peel right off. This gets rid of any excess liquid without adding more. I doubled all the spices, so it was a tsp. each of cinnamon, nutmeg (fresh grated), and ginger, which really ramped up the spice. With the changes, my dad said it was the best pumpkin pie he ever had.

Everyone raved about it  even a pastry chef said  it was excellent.  However instead of the listed spices I used  2 tsp. of pumpkin spice.

I've made plenty of pumpkin pies before, but this recipe is now a permanent in my household!! The crust came out perfect, and the pie tasted like it came from a really nice restaurant. You can't go wrong with this one!

I liked this pie with the fresh pumpkin but I think it requires additional nutmeg and cinnamon to have the real pumpkin pie experience. I was able to make two pies using this recipe. I did not  have enough shortening / butter to make my own pie crust so I bought one in the dairy case to save some time and it was delicious!

Not a newbie to making pies but this one is really lacking. It's been in the oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees and the pies are still liquid but the filling bubbled and the crusts are overdone. Won't bother with this one again.

Absolutely delicious. My first time making real pumpkin pie and I was shocked by the difference. The taste is much creamier and satisfying than canned or store bought. I used a long neck pumpkin which produced 2 pies with pumpkin purée to spare.  I added some Allspice, which was recommended by another reviewer and it was the perfect touch.

I plan to make this again in the future.

Best pumpkin pie I ever made.  I made the filling and my BF made the crusts.  He made the crust using the recipe from the Crisco butter flavor shortening package, and I roasted the pumpkin (rather than steaming) and added 1/2 tsp of allspice per 2 cups of pumpkin.  In my over, it ended up needing to cook about 55 minutes, instead of 40.  Tasted fabulous and set up perfectly.  We used small pie tins (not deep dish) and 8 cups of mashed pumpkin made enough filling for 4 small pies plus 6 ramekins.

This is a very good pumpkin pie! Made it today for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I was hoping it will taste good and it turned out really well.  It was lighter and not that overwhelmingly sweet as pumpkin pies I had before. I also liked the amount of spices, it's not "in your face".  I baked my pumpkin and I used my favorite pie crust recipe, but everything else I did as the recipe says. Will definitely keep it and make it again.

I peeled and cut in big chunks and baked it at 325 degrees for 45 minutes, then I puree it and follow this recipe, except that I used half of the milk since my pumpkin puree was juicy. And I added more of the spices since the flavor was a little blend, after that it was delicious!

This recipe is OK.  I recommend the following adjustments:  (1) bake instead of boil/steaming the pumpkin otherwise it's too watery and must be strained, (2) cut back the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup, (3) double the amounts of cinnamon, ginger, & nutmeg.  NB: Taste your mixture while raw then it's easy to adjust points 2 & 3.

Pumpkin pie is amazing but the best way to use the pumpkin is to bake it for about an hour so it can be moist but yet not boiling out all the flavor that you want in the pie. It helps alot and it cuts most of the ingredients you shouldn't have to use!

I bought a pie crust, Pillsbury was on sale. Made the filling as the recipe calls for, and it was soo delicious!!!! The first day it was really good, but for some reason it tasted better the second day.  Seriously, though. I LOVE pumpkin pie, and this is now my favorite recipe!

A delicious and easy pie to make. I also roasted the pumpkin halves vs boiling (1-hr @ 350f). The family loved it and the top didn't crack, which was a first for me!

I used 2 pre-made Marie Callender crusts and it was enough to fill them both.  My family loved it.

A few suggestions:

Appliances/ cookware: Use an electric food processor to puree the cooked pumpkin. Using only a potato masher by hand leave a lot of strings and lumps. An electric mixer is the best way to go to get everything evenly mixed.  This recipe make about 2.5 pies using the original Pyrex pie pans. 

Fulling alterations: Double the amount of nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and add 1 teaspoon of all spice. This makes the pie a little more flavorful. If the  filling looks runny you can add some flour as needed, but not more than 1/4 cup otherwise it may start to look like a cake when its baking. Pumpkin puree is a lot more runny and watery than canned pumpkin, but it will turn out fine.   

Crust: For the crust  dough- I substituted butter for Crisco and skipped the salt after the first batch. The crust was pretty bland and salty when I followed the original recipie. Since the filling is more runny that with canned pumpkin I pre-baked my crust for about 10-15 minutes so it was lightly brown and wouldn't turn to mush at the bottom.

Don't judge this recipe by the picture I uploaded. The pumpkin I used was very big and the puree was watery so I ended up adding another cup or so. Also, I guess I don't have pie baking sheets so I used a ceramic dish. the "crust" was crushed up cinnamon Graham crackers with butter. I hand mixed it cause I'm a kid. the crust absorbed the puree essence and so even though this is not really a pie, it is surprisingly delicious!

Tastes great. I used only fresh ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, substituted evap. milk for coconut milk and used less sugar, a little under 1/2 cup.
Crust is super easy to make. Make sure you beat an egg and brush it (or use your hands) all over the pie crust.
I made the filling in a regular blender, came out perfectly smooth. My pumpkin was still very stringy when mashed so I recommend blending it. I didnt add too much milk because I find it makes the filing too watery.
Going to make one for my friend tommorow.

the crust is excellent. As it was my first fresh pumpkin pie, I used triple the amount of spices in the recipe, as I forewarned that if you aren't using a pumpkin pie pumpkin, you need to up the spices. It was excellent!!!

Heavy Cream instead of evap. milk,  butter instead of shortening, baked the whole pumpkin first as a previous review said, and added cloves as well for a little extra oomph.

Followed exactly except used store-bought crust due to time constraint. Very tasty but too sweet and not enough spices for my pref. I will use less sugar, more spices next time! Also needed to bake about 10 mins longer than recipe said, might need to drain pumpkin more next time. Thanks!

Yummy, and very helpful since I grew sugar pumpkins in my garden this year. A few changes - instead of dicing and boiling the pumpkin, I slice it in half, scoop out the innards, then placed it upside down in the rack in my roasting pan. I put about two cups of water in the bottom of the pan, lid on top and baked in a 350 degree oven for an hour until tender, then scooped out the flesh from the rind. Second, those who said something was missing, try 1/4 tsp of cloves.

I doubled the recipe to 4 cups of pumpkin to make 2 pies and actually had enough filling for 3.   I also didn't use a mixer to whip up the pumpkin once it was softened in the water.  It was just a bit lumpy, but everyone enjoyed the different texture.  I also had no idea how much a pumpkin weighs, so I had way more pumpkin than I needed, so I put the extra in freezer bags (2 C each) and put them away for another day.

I doubled all spices, added a touch of pumpkin pie spice, an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar and an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin. I also didn't have enough dough for my 9 inch pan so I increased the recipe. It tasted delicious!

Love it, I always add more spices because I love the flavor, and I'm not a huge fan of the crust since I'm already in love with my moms recipe or I'm lazy the day of and just have a store bought crust. I always cook and measure the pumpkin out ahead of time and freeze it in gallon bags

This recipe is fantastic! I've made it a couple years in a row now, for the holidays, and so far it's been a hit. The only adjustment I make is adding about a teaspoon of sugar to the crust.

Everyone loved the pie and it was my FIRST time baking anything that didn't come in a box! I had to leave it in way longer than the recipe called for and I added extras like pumpkin spice, allspice, cinnamon, vanilla.

Good basic recipe. I added a half teaspoon of vanilla extract, and for some reason I had the urge to add a dollop of lemon curd that I had in the refrigerator. It worked really well, and brought some extra flavor to the pie. Everyone kept asking for the recipe :)

I did not care for the crust.... I've never tried this recipe before so I wanted to chance it. Everything looked good and smelled good but the taste is overwhelming... Maybe I did something wrong. But it taste like straight shortening.

It was delicious! This was my first time trying to make pumpkin pie from fresh pumpkins and it was a very simple recipe but yet a very tasty pie! But I didnt use the pie crust recipe I used store bought ones instead. I also doubled the recipe for the pie filling and it made 3 pies which was perfect. Overall an amazing and simple recipe!

First time ever making a pumpkin pie and it turned out  good! The crust was great too, however I doubled the spices by 1/2 teaspoon to give it a little more flavour, already made a second pie and the family loves it..

I used this recipe and the pie was good but couldn't give 5 stars due to needing more spice. I did try again but added more cinnamon and nutmeg.

This is the first pumpkin recipe that I have used where I used a fresh pumpkin.  I have made one pie, not eaten yet.  I had a lot of pumpkin so I made pumpkin muffins and pumpkin pancakes.  I added a little extra spices to suit our family's taste.

Love this recipe spool much! I bought 5 sugar pumpkins for decorations for a party. After the party I didn't want to throw away the perfectly good pumpkins so I made a pie. The pie crust recipe was amazing along with the pie filling recipe. I used a blender so that the pumpkin was not stringy. I would recommend Thais pie recipe to everyone!

For a first time using fresh pumpkin, this turned out very well.  I did double the spices and even added a teaspoon of all spice, but I still think it needs more spice.  I was concerned because it was very runny, almost like liquid, so I added a teaspoon of corn starch like others recommended.  Texture was perfect.  

I also used a large pumpkin, not one of the little cooking ones and turned out fine (though I have a lot of pumpkin leftover.)  I boiled it on the stove, maybe next time I'll try in the oven to see if it helps with the runny-ness.  Also, good to note that I should have peeled it before cutting into chunks because peeling the little chunks after boiling was kind of a pain.

I didn't use the crust recipe here, I used a different one, but any general crust recipe should work the same, just personal preference. :)  

*Update May 2015-I made this recipe again, but I didn't have any evaporated milk, I just had sweetened condensed milk, so I was brave and tried it and just cut out the brown sugar completely.  It was still very good, no need for the sugar.

this recipe is great i did not use ginger i replaced the ginger with all spice and this recipe is enough for 2 pie crusts. Instead of putting your oven to 400 it could burn so i put my oven to 350

This was exactly the recipe I was expecting for  a homeade pumpkin pie. Although the recipe does not say you will have to make two crusts. As the filling makes enough for two. I still enjoyed it and so did my family!

This pie was a real hit! It has a lovely pumpkin taste, not overly spiced. The texture is not super creamy like a canned pumpkin produces, but you definitely get a satisfying true pumpkin experience with this. I'll make it again, definitely!

Loved this pie. My son really wanted to try homemade, so I rolled up my sleeves and made this recipe. It was better than I imagined it could be. I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan, but this was perfect. I loved that it wasn't overly spicy. I did add a little bit of cornstarch at the very end to help the batter thicken, but that is the only thing I changed. Will be making this again and again!

Delicious. I actually had to bake and then steam the pumpkin so it was soft enough to put into my blender for puree. Also I really like the evaporated milk. As I made two pies, I mixed this evaporated milk fresh pumpkin pie recipe with only 1/2 cup of brown sugar (not 3/4) with a 2nd pie recipe which called for condensed milk instead of evaporated milk (no sugar; rest of recipe the same). I also prebaked my pie crusts for 5 mins to avoid sogginess. All of guests raved about the freshness of the pie, and how is tasted light. With only a touch of whipping cream, it was a hit.

After my dog decided to take a bite out of my jack-o-lantern, I decided to make pie out of it (after discarding the dog bite part).  The pumpkin was pretty watery so I let it drain well and was still able to get enough pumpkin to make 4 pies.  To compensate for the wetness, I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to the recipe.  otherwise, no changes were made.  This recipe is perfect.  The seasoning is light, as is the texture of the pie.  I have a home made sweet potato pie that I have used for years and it's much denser than this.  This almost reminds me of a light custard pie.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

This was the first pie I ever made and it turned out PERFECT! 

Pie Crust:
I'm die hard for vegan butter, so I did replace the shortening in the pie crust with that instead, but my pie crust still came out great.

Pumpkin:
I baked my pumpkin instead of boiling it, which I don't think has any affect on how the pumpkin turns out - boiling may cause it to be a lot more watery, but if you follow suggestions to use a cheesecloth afterwards, you should be fine.

Filling:
I followed this part pretty closely, and only added a few extra drops of clove extract into the mix. 

With these few minor adjustments, my pie came out perfect! It looks like a pumpkin pie you'd buy from the store, but tastes a million times better. I'll never buy another pumpkin pie again. This recipe was so easy. It took me less than 2 hours to prep and bake it, and it was ready to eat by the next morning!

This is a great recipe and does not even come close to canned pumpkin. I do agree that two cups of pumpkin is not enough. I use two medium pumpkins and organic ingredients. I only have a cup left over and with this I make a small pie. Top it off with whip cream and you have a delicious pumpkin pie.

My first time making pumpkin pie from scratch.  My dough was a little to thick, next time I need to roll it thinner.
The pie itself,  was so delicious!  I was worried because my pumpkin wasn't completely pureed,  but the pie came out smooth and silky. Excellent recipe :-D

Excellent recipe  !! I adjusted only one thing..I beat the eggs with 2 oz of half and half and rook off 2 oz of the evaporated milk...otherwise this was right on in flavor and taste !!! The picture is the pie about half way done and already is forming a nice firmness...I also used a shortbread pre-made crust for unique taste and time saving !!!

I baked my pumpkin and pureed it till smooth.  I made this pie which turned out very well.  It only yields 1 pie, but worth the effort.  I did add a bit more spice than called for and a pinch of cloves.  It came out excellent.  Smooth and creamy.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I tried this with using canned pumpkin, and it turned out great! I also made Mini pies, instead of two huge ones.

The filling for this recipe is excellent - smooth and sweet with a spicy warmth. I really want to give it four and a half stars. The only reason I would withhold a half-star is that the crust given here was quite flavourless. My mother happily ate the filling and left the crust on her plate. In future I would make this with my usual shortcrust pastry (made with butter), or perhaps a graham cracker crumb crust. 
And yes, it's true that this recipe makes only enough filling for one deep pie.

Changed 3/4 Cup brown sugar to 1 Cup of white sugar.  A heaping tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tap ginger, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of cloves and 1/8 tsp of allspice, and about 2 Tbsp of cornstarch.

I can't speak for the crust, as I used store bought, but the filling was amazing! Like others I added an extra half cup or so of pumpkin purée which filled them just perfectly.  No need to adjust other ingredients.  I was out of ginger and substituted all spice instead which didn't seem to create any differences.  So happy my first attempt at cooking a real pumpkin pie was positive!  When my husband and young son love it, it's a keeper!  I loved it too!

A family member told me that I needed to boil the pumpkin, then mash it (I should have used the internet!). Needless to say, when I mixed all of the ingredients, the mix was SUPER liquidy (like thin soup) with thick pumpkin goop on the bottom of the bowl. I wanted to get all of that thick pumpkin mixed in well (I thought it would make everything thicker) so I put it in my blender and hit "puree". It was still very thin, although well mixed, and I was so worried that my pies didn't have a chance... For the second pie, I just put everything in the blender and hit "puree". I used store bought refrigerated pie crust (I was feeling lazy, and originally planned on making 6 pies), and I made no alterations to the recipe. I used 10-inch pie plates, and the filling almost overflowed out of the crusts! I believe I left my pies in for 45-50 minutes (I had 2 in the oven), and they turned out wonderfully! Nice, solid, not soupy at all, and delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe that saved me from a big disaster!

This is a winner! Loved it so much. Can't wait to have an excuse to make another. It was the PERFECT amount for one deep dish pie. To get the 2 cups of mashed pumpkin, I had to use 8 cups of pumpkin I had cubed and frozen, then steamed and ran through food processor.

I made this a couple times for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious and very popular! I always make my own crust but it's nice that this recipe encourages it. I also pureed my pumpkin after roasting it, but anyway. It wasn't as thick as your average pumpkin pie but it was still delicious - and I'll definitely be making this again.

We love this, it's not too sweet, will definitely make again with some little modifications.  Added some allspice and clove.  And with my pie dish had to cook 20 minutes longer.  I will also bake/roast the pumpkin instead of boiling, it was really watery so I had to let the pumpkin sit overnight and let the juice collect at the bottom, I strained then used the top layer, froze the remaining for later use.  This was much easier than I thought it would be and I had help from a 4.5yr old.

A very good pie. I have made fresh pumpkin pie before, but this was the best ever after a few amendments. I added a large pinch of allspice and made my own pastry as I dislike pastry with shortening in.

Delicious!  Hubby and guests all loved the pie.
I cheated and used a Pet Ritz deep-dish pie crust but used the filling recipe here so it only made one pie.
I added 1/2 t of ground cloves as was suggested by another reviewer and we thought it had a wonderful flavor.
For you other first-timers like me, cooking the pumpkin was a breeze.  I cut it in quarters (it was big) and put it cut side down on a jelly roll pan and baked at 325 for an hour.  I let it cool a little then with a large spoon, simply and easily scraped the seeds and strings, then scraped the pumpkin from the shell.  It was sooo easy.  Don't be afraid.  My pumpkin was large so half is in the freezer waiting for Christmas!

I have a couple of recommendations.  After cooking and pureeing your pumpkin, let the puree drain so it is not at all watery. I baked rather than boiled the pumpkin. The crust recipe makes enough for 2 pies. The filling recipe makes enough for 1 pie.  I didn't change any of the filling ingredients except for adding 1 tablespoon of flour.  Use a pie shield so that the edges of the pie crust don't get too brown.  We thought the spicing was perfect--it lets the flavor of the pumpkin shine through.  I took it with me to my brother & sister-in-laws for Thanksgiving and she said it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever had!

This was my first time ever making a pie of any kind. I looked through a lot of recipes the last couple days trying to find the right one. And this one seemed the best. It was easy to make. I followed this recipe exactly except added some cloves. My only issues were like some this recipe only made 1 1/4 of a pie, but I think my pie plate is a bigger one and then I used one of those small custard bowls to use up the rest. I smells delicious except that the crust smells and taste like way too much shortening it's making me gag. but we'll see how the rest taste. Hopefully good. But next time I'm going with a different crust or lessen the shortening maybe use oil or actual butter.

Amazing pumpkin pie...My family and friends love it...I do however tweak the recipe a little...instead of using 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar I use 1/2 a cup or less and don't pack it. I also add more spices and keep trying till it's what I like...So Yummy

I love this pie. I trimmed off the rind before cooking, I also used 1tsp Allspice instead of using the nutmeg and ginger. Turned out great.

YUMMY! It was simple and delicious.  I changed a few things.  I used canned pumpkin,added 16 oz of evaporated milk and used store bought crust.  Simply yummy!  Will make again.

I wanted to tackle homemade pumpkin pie for the first time, and this was the greatest experience! It tasted so much better than regular store bought pie! I added more vanilla and spices, and it turned out great! Everyone loved it!

This recipe stole the show this Thanksgiving.  My entire family enjoyed it (even those that don't like pumpkin pie).  Thanks for posting it.

Truly delicious. My family gobbled it down. Like others, I did double the spices and added a dash of allspice. Great recipe.

honestly i dont know what i did wrong.  I did the prep and cooked the pumpkin in the oven at 425 for 1 hour. After I let it cool, the skin peel right off.  It was great. I think I should have mashed it after but i wasnt thinking.  What i did was put the cooked pumpkin in my juicer and squeeezed and the juice out.  As much as I could.  I then took my blender and blended it as much at i could. i blended 2 3/4 of pumpkin. After I added the cream and blended it on medium. it didnt seem smmoth to me but rather maybe a bit dry. i stuck the rest of the ingredients in. blended them. It was thick. very thick, So I added more evaporated milk and more spices. Its still lumpy, but i blended it the best i could.  I thought its suppose to be more like thick soup.  Anyways I used a graham cracker crust and I has actaully too much to fill both pie shells.  I think i may have used too much pumpkin.  I dont know what it tastes like yet because its in my oven right now, but if anyone has any ideas on what i did wrong please tell me.  Was i suppose to not drain the pumpkin as much??   I tried taking suggestions from other viewers like the 2 3/4 cooked pumpkin and the extra spices and the graham crust but man I dont know what happened for it to be for lumpy.

Awesome. I altered the spices by adding an additional 1/2 tsp each as another reviewer suggested and it was a hit!

Tasted great!! but it is A LOT of work. Made it last Thanksgiving because I couldn't find canned pumpkin here in Europe.  Next year I'm bringing canned pumpkin in my suitcase.  But the recipe is definetly good! Would also agree that it doesn't quite make enough filling.
