This is the best turnip recipe that I've found.  I had lots of compliments and there were only a few spoonfuls left. Will definitely make this again.  Went really well with our Christmas turkey dinner.

I like this recipe, but I had to somewhat alter the original.  I reduced the 6 tbls butter to 4 tbls, make sure you are using unsalted butter.  I did not put butter on the top at the end, didn't seem necessary.  Also, I increased the eggs to 3 and doubled the bread crumbs.  I did reduce the salt, but I could have reduced it even more.  I am wondering if the recipe meant to say 1 teaspoon salt, not tablespoon.

This is the best turnip recipe I have ever tried. I had to double
it for only 8 guests. I will use this for a staple recipe. Even my Husband liked it and he hates turnip!!

Best turnip recipe I've tried so far. Used half the butter in both the turnip mixture and in the breadcrumb topping and it was still rich and creamy. Also reduced salt to 1 tsp, which was plenty.

This was really good. It didn't make me magically love turnips, though. Hubby likes turnips more than I do and he really enjoyed it.

This casserole is delicious!  I did not alter the recipe at all, the amount of salt and butter is perfect and it has just the right amout of sweetness to compliment the turnip.    Loved it.

Very good. Before cooking I took a bite and really liked the applesauce (I used unsweetened) but after I cooked it I couldn't really taste it anymore. Still great but I wish that flavor had come through.

This was a big hit for my family. I didn't have enough bread crumbs and was in a time crunch so I tried toasting some bread. Not going to do that next time...bad move on my part.
