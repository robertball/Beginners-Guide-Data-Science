These were quite good and tasty without the cream cheese and chive spread.  However, they did stick to the cookie sheet.  Next time I'm going to lightly grease the sheet before baking.

These biscuits turned out the best of any I've ever made.  I finished them off with garlic butter with parsley flakes.  They were quick, easy and excellent.

These turned out great.  I will definitely make them again, but I think I  will experiment with some more spices next time.

These were okay. Not as wonderful as the ones at Red Lobster.

These are good and pretty easy. I recommend doing it in a kitchen-aid if you have one. Use the paddle, and then switch to the dough hook when you add the milk. No need to knead that way.

GREAT recipe.
I only made one change; I didn't use any kraft products.  If I really wanted to eat unhealthy, artificial, processed food I might consider it, but I don't.

These taste just like Red Lobster's!! I brushed some garlic butter cross the top and voila! Perfect! The recipe is good as-is, although the cream cheese spread is an unnecessary condiment.

These were so simple and easy to make. Not to mention delicious! Hubby devoured half of them!
