The last reviewer is correct. I am the submitter of this recipe and the can of cherry pie filling should be 21 oz, not 12.

Super yummy!  Not the best ever, but really REALLY good!  Used light cherry pie filling and lower fat butter (Brummel & Brown's) to cut down on sugar, fat and calories.

This was good & easy. I followed the recipe exactly except for the cherry pie filling. I think the recipe is supposed to say 21 oz instead of 12 oz. I couldn't find a 12 oz can in the store & when I spread the 21 oz can over the bottom, it just barely covered. It took me over than 15 mins to prepare but maybe I was being slow. It cooked for exactly 40 mins. We serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. Thanks.

Great combination! I made it with frozen sweet cherries cooked with a little corn starch and almond extract for flovoring. Will make again often.

Very good!  We preferred this served warm.  I think vanilla ice cream is a must.  I will try this again with more pie filling, as I felt like there wasn't enough when compared to the amount of the cobbler.

This is delicious. I took it to a last minute dinner I was asked to bring a dessert for and it was a big hit! Served it warm with vanilla ice cream...yummy! It was very easy and used ingredients I had on hand. Chocolate and cherry really DO make a great combination!

This was pretty good, however I did kick it up a notch by adding a almond crumble topping. I didn't measure anything for the topping, but I used a little flour, some brown sugar, oats, sliced almonds, butter and a little almond and vanilla extract. I just sprinkled it over the cherry filling, and bakind it. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

Absolutely simple but versatile recipe. I serve it for a fancy meal or just as a nice treat when I get home after a hard work day. I have also made variants with mint chips, white chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips. Also, switching the pie filling with raspberry, blueberry, peaches or apples makes a dessert just as yummy!

This was delicious. I used Ghirardelli chocolates which i believe made a big impact on the overall flavor. I would definitely recommend going for quality chocolate on this one. Also, i used one can of cherry pie filling (21 oz) in addition another 15oz frozen bag of black cherries. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the frozen cherries with a little bit of corn starch, a splash of water, and almond extract. I also then poured the can of pie filling into the pan with the other cherries to make the flavor more uniform. I sprinkled sliced almonds over the top, and added some extra chocolate chips to the batter. I think overall it was amazing. Everyone at the dinner party i went to raved about it. I got comments like "Oh my gosh, this is gourmet!" and "I can't believe you made this!" The only thing i would do differently next time is to not add the extra chocolate chips to the batter. I think that it made it very rich, which i actually do love, but that it is yummy enough without them. I think that  adding the extra cherries was imperative though, and made the dish perfect. It still fit in a 2-quart casserole dish. I will make this again for sure!

I followed the recipe and mine turned out very 'cakey' and not enough cherries.  Next time I would use 2 cans of cherries.

Really enjoyed this one.  My family felt it was a little light on the cherries, though.   I plan to make it with two cans next time to off set all the chocolate.  Very good over all, though.

This is very easy but I would recommend using more cherries. I added some strawberries and served with vanilla strawberry swirl ice cream. I think the next time I will add strawberry pie filling instead. Just cuz im a strawberry girl!

I made this dessert earlier this evening and it came out pretty yummy! I didn't have any regular choclate chips so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips & it still came out good. I give it 4 stars because it didn't taste as good cooled down as it did when it was warm and out of the oven. This dessert definetly goes well with vanilla ice cream though.

Delicious. We served it with vanilla ice cream as suggested. I made it into more of a fruit crisp than a cobbler by omitting the egg milk and baking powder.  Also, I used "lite" cherry filling.  I would have added some almonds as another reviewer suggested but my stepson is allergic to nuts.  However, everyone really enjoyed this and it was so simple to make.

We followed the recipe as it was written. As soon as we mixed the dough together and saw how much there was, we thought, "We need more cherries" but we were too far in to go back for more than the 21 oz can we bought just for trying this cobbler. It tasted pretty good but left you craving more cherry filling to go with the amount of cobbler topping. The dough also seemed very brownie like. Not exactly but made us wonder how just brownie mix would do on top. We would make this again but get more cherry pie filling. Its hard to have too much cherry anyway :)

Very good!  My hubby loves the chocolate-cherry combination, so I made this for him for Valentine's day.  I didn't make any changes and we loved it.  I served it heated up with some vanilla ice cream.  Yum!

This was really good! I love the combination of chocolate and cherries.  I don't know if I made it correctly-I followed the directions exact but wasn't sure the texture was what it should be.  However, when it came out of the oven I thought it was perfect! The colors were dramatic.  I think it would be a nice valentine's dessert served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for a unique and delicious idea!

Very good.  Everyone loved this cobbler.  I made my own cherry pie filling with a "frozen cherry pie filling" recipe from this site. Not hard at all.  I also threw in some strawberry's that needed to be used.  and I added some chocolate chips to the batter just for fun.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was easy and quite yummy for the time invested!  Vanilla ice cream would have been perfect with this (but we didn't have any and no one would go out to get it!).

Very good recipe. I used canned tart cherries, with some juice removed. Excellent with good dark chocolate chips. Everyone liked them very much cut into bars.

We made this tonight.  I added an additional 21 ounce can of cherries and cooked this much longer than suggested.  I also used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and with the vanilla ice cream, this is heaven.  I do not think it would be sweet enough if I did not add the ice cream.  With all that said, we will make this again!

It's a little strong on the chocolate flavor, but seriously yummy!

The proportion of cherries to topping is way off. I'd use at least half again as much cherry. The texture of the topping is odd; it was like pie dough when I put it in the oven, but came out like dense brownie.

This recipe comes from one of those top secret restaurant recipe type books. I believe it was a Cracker Barrel dessert recipe for a black forrest dessert. I just did not like it. It just doesn't turn out for some reason. Straight out of the oven, it tastes like undercooked gummy brownie batter on very tin can tasting cheeries. The 2 components dont really meld together. Also, do not make the mistake of accidentally buying the pie filling made with artificial sweetener. The cooked down taste of it is over-whelming. I was going to toss it and then decided to put it in the fridge uncovered to see if it would come together better. The next day, it seemed to turn into more of a black forrest brownie. The brownie like top thickened up and some of the cherry soaked into it. It became super sweet, but the flavor much improved. Either way, I could see this working much better with a reworked cake like topping and from scratch cherry pie filling. Just was really not for us. I might try to salvage the squares in lunches.

This is very good and chocolatey!  I added about 1/8 cup of butter because it really didn't get "crumbly" with only 1/4 cup.  We loved this!

I am a chocolate lover and my husband loves fruit pies, so this sounded like something we would both enjoy. This was a good and very easy recipe.  We topped our portions off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
