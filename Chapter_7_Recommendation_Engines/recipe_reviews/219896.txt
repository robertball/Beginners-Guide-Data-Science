I made this recipe and it was great. Only changed a few things. I used 1 cup pepepr jack and 1 cup mozzarella, also used twice the artichokes and half the peppers, plus a spoonfull of minced garlic, but it was amazing!

I used 12 oz of both artichoke hearts and peppers and extra mayo after discovering no sour cream in the fridge. I used garden veg cream cheese (again no 'plain' in the fridge) and added 3 cloves fresh roasted garlic.  I also added too much garlic salt and threw in a cup or so of chopped romaine lettuce (I know, right!) to cut the saltiness. Turned out divinely and the lettuce added a nice crunch akin to chopped water chestnuts. Finally, I didn't use a crock pot but baked it on low at 250F in the serving dish since I am taking it to a garden party!

Excellent warm dip and very easy to make!  I doubled the artichokes, like a lot of folks seem to do.  I heated it in a covered glass dish in the oven (300 degrees for over an hour) rather than the crock pot and it turned out great!  I also took a small amount of the red pepper and the tougher artichoke petals and pureed them in a mini food processor with the mayonnaise.  It added some color and depth to the dish.  Overall it was excellent and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with everyone! I kept to the recipe pretty much but, added a tad more garlic.

This was such a great dish! I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic (from the jar) and I doubled the artichoke. But it was a huge success at a party and I would definitely make it again!

So good!  I made it for a work pot luck and everyone LOVED IT!!  I added jalapenos to my recipe because I love things spicy.  I think the addition of jalapenos made it a bit better.

Hubs says 5.5 stars. Used miracle whip cause that's what I had, and four cloves of garlic. Also added two cups fresh spinach, which really just added color. Creamy and delicious.

This just did not hit the spot for me.  This was made the night before a party & reheated, so maybe that's what went wrong.  I made it exactly as stated, but the next day I thought it was too bland, so I ended up adding chili sauce that I had on hand to zing it up.  Others said they liked it but I had a lot left over.

This is excellent . Like other reviewers said , I added garlic . Otherwise did it all the same . I was able to find fancy artichoke hearts in garlic marinade , those also kicked it up a notch . Next time ... I'm adding crab !! I got many rave reviews at my party , and I served it with Italian bread

EXCELLENT!  I had water packed peppers and added some garlic powder.  Makes good amount, perfect for a football party, new years or pot luck!  I thinly sliced a crusty baguette.  Perfect combination of flavors!  Even great heated the following day!

Rather bland. Added some minced garlic, but it probably could have stood more.

Delicious. Only thing I added was a little minced garlic. Was a hit with the hubby and my dad!
