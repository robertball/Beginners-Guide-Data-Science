The marinade is excellent.  It thoroughly flavored the chicken, and is wonderful if you like chipotle.  Though it's not for the faint of heart; 1 tsp of chipotle powder made this a bit too spicy for my girlfriend.    This recipe could be improved by some form of complimentary sauce.  We attempted making a reduction of the marinade but it was, again, a bit too spicy for some.  I personally loved the flavor and found the spiciness acceptable.

The recipe only calls for 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle powder NOT 1 teaspoon--that may be the reason why ThomasG's girlfriend found it too spicy.

My family and I realy enjoyed this recipe! I could not find chipotle powder so I used chipotle sauce. I would make this a regular in my kitchen.

This was really good, marinated over night.  The chipotle issue must be a taste preference, my whole family couldn't even detect any spice at all.

I really think the spices in this recipe compliment the orange and lime juice!  I did add a few things to my desired liking.  I added freshly minced garlic, and a little bit of sugar to desired taste.  The sugar really made everything else pop!  I would recommend trying it this way if you like a sweet citrusy taste to your chicken!

I followed the instructions to the letter--no substitutions--and let the chicken marinate for a full 9 hrs. I expected a more robust flavor due to the cilantro and chipotle but was sadly disappointed. It's a pretty mild flavored chicken breast that needs a whole lot of something to bring it to life.

We didn't like it. We didn't taste any of the chipotle either. Might want to up that a bit.

Not much flavor at all. I followed exactly but did cut down the chipotle. But still there should have been other flavors with all those ingredients. Usually have good luck with All Recipes. Oh well.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. It was indeed moist and tender, but the flavor seemed to be mostly of the juice. This was just okay for us, and not really what I was expecting. I think the large amount of liquid prevents the seasoning from being much of a contribution to the flavor. I doubled the chipotle after reading some of the comments and still did not feel that it or the garlic flavor were really present.
