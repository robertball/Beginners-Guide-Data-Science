This is a bit different, but good.  I found it a little too sweet for my preferences, so I would cut way back on the sugar or eliminate it altogether, but I will add it to my rotation.  Thanks, Luke.

Good. I used 1 Tbsp sugar and unsweetened cocoa instead of the hot chocolate mix. Thanks for the recipe Luke Berkgren.

I love it, don't have to pay those high prices anymore, when everything is here at home for one of my favorite drinks.  I did add one thing, because I had it on hand and that was a Tablespoon of Kahlua coffee liqueur flavored syrup. Yum !

Quick and easy!  Two things I love.  I didn't have cows milk on hand so I used a mixture of almond milk and coconut water.  I also substituted the cocoa mix with Trader Joe's sipping chocolate (only 1 tsp) with 1 tsp sugar.  Delicious!  Good hot or cold.

This was yummy. The only thing I didn't like was the after taste of the coconut milk. But this is coming from a person that likes milk in my coffee. The only thing I changed up is I used regular sugar and Trader Joes Sipping Chocolate.

My first sip and I was in love. This drink is better than your local ice cream or coffee shops mocha frappe. It took some time but it was worth it, so worth it

This was delicious! I changed it up a bit. I put in tiramisu yogurt I used NO sugar cappuccino mix and tiny bit of bakers choc. Then I added coffee extract. But, everything was the same.

I use this as a base to create my coffee drink.  I never have coconut milk on hand.  I always use skim milk and it works out great.  I've added additional things to this drink depending what I may have in my fridge.  I've added fruit to make it sweeter and cut back on the sugar.

I didn't have a coconut milk, so I substituted 2% milk for the coconut milk. It came out great!

After reading the previous review I added one TBS of sugar. It was pretty yummy! Not something I'd make for a get together but for an afternoon or late morning for something a bit different for my family I'd give it a go.
