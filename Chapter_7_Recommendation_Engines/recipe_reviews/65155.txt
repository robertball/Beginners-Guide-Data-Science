This recipe isn't rated 5 stars for nothing, it's excellent!  But, a few changes could be made.  You either have to increase the dough or decrease the pan size.  I used a 8 x 8 baking pan and the dough amount was perfect.  I also added cinnamon to the dough and berries, and vanilla extract to the dough.  I used tart wild black berries and it was still a little on the sweet side, I would probably decrease the sugar by a 1/4 c.

Excellent!  With family stretched across 5 southern states cobbler is a tradition, and this recipe certainly rates as good as, if not better than, most family recipes (don't tell Grandma).  Both me and my dad agree that this is a superb recipe.  The only changes I made were to add 1/4 tsp. of freshly ground cinnamon to the dough, and another 1/4 tsp. to the fruit mix, and also a little extra lemon juice.  Nothing that would really change it.  Also, my new rangetop doesn't allow cast iron skillets :(  No big deal.  I boiled the fruit mixture in a large sauce pan and transfered to a casserole dish (uncovered) while still bubbling, and then added dough.  Voila!!  I don't think I'll ever need another cobbler recipe.  When the blackberries run out I think I'll try it with apricots.

Edit:  I've since increased the dough mixture by 50% and reduced the sugar in the fruit mixture by half (with other member recommendations).  Much better!

If you're deciding whether to make this or not, MAKE IT! This is by far the best cobbler I've ever made. If you have an iron skillet that's definitely the way to go. I doubled the topping recipe and added 1 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter. I used frozen raspberries and they worked perfectly. I used the amount of sugar the recipe calls for and the sweetness was on-point. When I tossed the berries with sugar I also added the zest of one orange and squeezed a little into the boiling berry mixture. I sprinkled a little more cinnamon and some coarse sugar on the batter after dropping it into the berries and used a toothpick to check doneness.

Yum, I'll definitely make this again!  I combined the advice of several other reviewers.  I doubled the dough, reduced the sugar to 1/4 c. in the dough and 2/3 c. in the berries and added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon to both dough and berries.  I ended up using 6 cups of berries and adjusted the recipe accordingly and cooked it in a 9X13 Pyrex pan at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.

This is an excellent recipe and adapts well to changes. I used frozen mixed berries from Costco - and listened to others and made 1.5 times the topping. Excellent. I don't have the pan suggested so brought it to a boil in a regular sauce pan and then transfered it to a deep disposible pan. No need for the pan underneath! Turned out great! Have made it several times now. Really good with ice cream.

Every summer my husband an youngest son go blackberry picking and I always make the same cobbler recipe which everyone likes. This year I decided to try this recipe and we just loved it! My husband especially thought it far surpassed the other recipe I have used. He liked the fact that it was made in a cast iron skillet. The only change I made was to cut down on the sugar. I used 1/3c in the batter and 2/3c in the berries. Also I use raw (turbinado)sugar. I think less sugar lets you taste the berries more. Thanks for a great recipe, it will be the one I use from now on!

This was good but WAY too sweet.  I made it a second time using only 1/2 cup sugar in the fruit mixture and it was PERFECT.  Yummy--thank you!

LOVED it! I used blueberries and peaches instead and boiled it in a pot and then transfered it to a pyrex dish - b/c i don't have a cast iron skillet. It was perfect.

I cut the recipe in half for 2 of us--I have my own backyard blackberries-  this is an easy and tasty recipe - I will make again.   I used sugar ,not splenda  so this is an update-I   don't  know why my review said that?  I think you  could but I never use artificial sugar---
 I make this in a small iron skillet - comes out perfect every time even when I cut it in half ---

I gave this 5 stars because I thought it was excellent as a basic cobbler recipe.  I was also glad to see that reviewers were commenting on the tartness of the berries and their individual preference when referring to the amount of sugar.  I personally like more blackberry flavor and less sweet and I do not care for the addition of the cinnamon or vanilla but that is my taste.  I also did not add corn starch because I like a lot of juice but I would not lower the rating just because I like something a little difference.  When you change the recipe and then give it a 3 or 4 or less, then you have not really rated the recipe.  My family enjoyed very much.

This was such a great recipe - I wouldn't change a thing! I went blackberry picking with my boyfriend for my first time, and we tried this recipe. We were so impressed with ourselves, that we decided to take it over to his grandparents.  Once we tasted it, however, we kept it for ourselves!! :)  I will definitely make this cobbler again - probably NEXT weekend!

What can I say. This was absolutly divine ! A symphony of tantalizing deletable delight ! Why?I will tell you why....The berries were fresh picked at the edge of the woods, the crust topping made with the blessing of REAL butter , the lemon juice to give that special something, and the iron skillet to culminate an experience of sheer pleasure. Just to behold the finished product was a picture in and of itself. The berries glistened like dark blue diamonds....If I could I would give this more than five stars! It was exquisite. I thank you from the bottom of my berry heart!

Wow-I was really impressed with this recipe; the taste was fabulous (one of the best cobblers I've tasted). I had 10 cups of fresh blackberries that I needed to use, though, and wanted to make a larger pan due to the size of my family. So this is what I used for the BERRY mixture: 10 cups of fresh blackberries, 5 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/2 cup cold water, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. For the DOUGH, I used 2 cups of flour, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 2 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of salt, 12 tablespoons of cold butter, and 1/2 cup of boiling water. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly as described using these ingredients. Baked at 350 in a greased 9X13 casserole dish for about an hour, until the dough was browned. Everyone in my family loved it--especially the crust. I could see how this recipe could be adapted for other types of fruit very easily.

This really is delicious.  I couldn't use my iron skillet so I just boiled the berry mixture in a saucepan and dumped into an oval casserole dish when it was done.  I also used Smart Balance butter blend sticks (NOT the tub) just to experiment.  And it came out wonderfully.  I honestly can't tell the difference.  I do agree with other reviewers on a few things, notably the sugar amounts.  (1) Reduce the sugar in both the batter and the fruit, especially if your blackberries are sweet on their own.  I have a monster sweet tooth but even this was too much for me.  For batter 1/3 cup is enough, maybe even 1/2 cup.  For the berry mixture, 1/2 cup is good, maybe even less if your berries are really sweet. (2) Add cinnamon (1 tsp) and vanilla (1/2 to 3/4 tsp) to the batter.  This really makes a difference.  Overalll, great recipe.  Absolute keeper!

First time making cobbler but this was really good!
Substituted coconut sugar for granulated and only used about 1/4 C in the dough and about 3/4 C in the berries...next time, might reduce to 1/2 C in the berries but it wasn't too overly sweet. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon in dough and 3/4 tsp in berries. Didn't use a cast iron pot. Instead, heated berries on stove to boiling, meanwhile, putting a baking dish in oven to warm up with the oven. When berries were boiled, poured them into heated oven dish, then spooned batter on top and heated for required time in oven. Very happy I tried this!

Very good cobbler recipe, I used 4 cups fresh blueberries and added extra lemon juice to berries, 1/2 tsp.vanilla and 1/4 tsp.cinnamon to the batter. Next time though I will be sure to make extra batter, I like more dough to soak up the fruit juices. This does tend to be on the sweet side so I will probably cut down on the sugar in the fruit mixture to 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup .  Very easy to make, I don't have a cast iron skillet so I just cooked the berries in a saucepan on the stove, transfered mixture to a Corning White Pyrex oval casserole and baked for 25 minutes, the dough was a nice golden brown. Plan on making next week but with apples instead.
   The hubby said it was very good, but was upset because we didn't have any vanilla ice cream to top this with!

Wow, soo good! This disappeared in a hurry! I also added cinnamon to both the dough and berry mix. I'm torn on the dough thing...I think it was great as is but extra dough wouldn't hurt...but I think 2x as much would be overdoing it.

Wow! This recipe is super easy to make and was absolutely delicous! I have never made a cobbler so I was pretty nervous. This recipe turned out to be not intimidating at all so if you are a beginner cobbler maker, this is the recipe to try.  I did as others suggested and added the teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon to the crust batter and doubled the batter as well because we like a lot of crust. This was definitely the best part! I actually think I like this type of crust better than the pie crust type of other cobblers I have eaten.  I used blackberries(which I am not a huge fan of but my boyfriend's family are) and I actually had two servings it was so decadent. My boyfriend's grandmother gave me the wonderful compliment that this recipe reminded her of her mother's recipe when she was little.  For those of you who don't have a cast iron skillet like myself, I just used a Corningware dish. DO USE the baking sheet with aluminum foil. When I put it in the oven I didn't think I needed to do this because I didn't think it would rise that much but it definitely did! I caught my mistake though just in time before the oven became a major blackberry mess.

Very good cobbler. I didn't have any lemon juice so I used lime juice instead and it might have been even better with the lemon, I'll never know! But still a great dessert recipe. For anyone who said there wasn't enough dough though--you are wrong! This recipe calls for the perfect amount of dough. The dough should not completely cover the berries before cooking since it fluffs and expands during baking so just small dollops spaced out evenly across the top is plenty. Once it bakes it comes together and covers the whole cobbler perfectly.

I never ever write reviews, but I thought I need to give this recipe the credit it deserves! I just went and made another blackberry cobbler from this site, don't ask me why it was just to give another recipe a shot. It was absolutely nothing compared to this one! This one is the perfect everything...sweetness, dumpling texture, thickness ect... I def give this one 10 stars!

Perfect! I made the following changes: A) Fresh blackberries are out of season, so I used 2 16oz bags of frozen blackberries, B) I added a tspn of cinnamon to the blackberries and an additional tspn of cinnamon to the topping, C) I made double batch of topping and made sure the top was covered with it (I dropped it on by spoonfuls and then smeared the top smooth with a spatula) and D) I didn't have a castiron skillet on hand, so I brought everything up to a boil in a kettle and then poured into a 9x9 pan and put the topping on and baked. If you use frozen blackberries, there is no need to thaw. Just put them in the skillet and they'll defrost while they come up to a boil.  
So easy, so good, and so pretty.

If you have some fresh picked blackberries sitting on the counter and are trying to decide what to do with them... MAKE THIS COBBLER!  My kids and I had planned on making a blackberry pie with berries we had picked around the neighborhood. I went to online to find a good pie recipe and came across this cobbler one.  I decided to make it because I didn't feel like making pie crust. Everyone seemed fairly disappointed that I wasn't making pie but boy were they eating their words when they took a bite of this cobbler!  Numerous people said it was the best cobbler they had ever tasted and I completely agreed.  I doubled the recipe, both crust and fruit, and added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to both.  I also used brown sugar instead of white in the fruit mixture, and cooked it in a 13x9 glass dish.  Served with vanilla ice cream on top it was heavenly.

This was really good.  I made it as written and because I was using wild blackberries, I needed all the sugar called for in the recipe.  My only complaint is the biscuit-type consistency of the batter.  I thought it was a little too dense.  I would have enjoyed something more cakey and chewy.  Maybe next time I will add a little more water to thin it down a bit.

It was so hard for me to find a descent Blackberry Cobbler recipe.  And then I found this one!  AND IT WAS PERFECT!!!!  I used frozen berries, because the fresh ones where just too expensive.  And I added some cinnomon to the dough, and just a touch more cinnomon to the berrie mix after it started boiling.  Also, I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I just used a saucepan and then I transfered that into an 8x8 glass dish and baked it that way.  Turned out perfect.  I have been asked to make it for Christmas, and to make a lot more this time.  :-)  I am so happy w/ this recipe.  Thank you so much!

This was wow, OMG, good!  I doubled the recipe for a large outdoor cookout and therefore did not have a cast iron skillet big enough so I baked it in a large casserole dish instead.  Out of this world!  Even better since I used fresh berries from the family farm in Michigan.

OMG!! This is my first ever review, I have a couple to do but had to drop everything and write this now! Just made this for the first time today for Thanksgiving, to DIE for! Made exactly as written, but knowing my taste I added extra lemon, and cinnamon and nutmeg in the dough and mix. Oh and I used a frozen berry mix with blackberries, I'm sure any fruit would be good but the blackberries rock.  This recipe is worth a hundred stars!

I'm rating this 4/5 stars due to the fact that I had to decrease the sugar.  Using the amount of sugar listed would have been WAY too sweet. Like others, I added 2/3 cup sugar to the berry mixture and 1/3 cup sugar to the batter, and it was perfect!  

I baked it in an 8x8 pan and the amount of batter was perfect.  Using a larger pan may require making 1.5x the amount of batter listed.  The crust on top is the best part, so you really want to make sure you have enough.

Served warm and paired with some vanilla ice cream made this a fabulous dessert for a 4th of July BBQ.

Such an incredible cobbler!!! Following other reviewers advice, I mixed only 1/2 c. sugar with the berries and added orange zest. I also added cinnamon to the batter and a little more on top. It was absolutely perfect!! I had to refrain myself from eating it all in one sitting!  This is a definite keeper.

YUM! I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers, and cut the sugar with the blackberries to only 3/4C, using 1/2C splenda sugar substitute and 1/4C honey, to keep a nice sweet flavor.  I also added cinnamon to both the dough and the berries, and vanilla extract to the dough.  I took it one step further to make this dish a little more nutritious and added 1/4C oat bran to the dough, to give it a little more dimension.  The dough was definitely too buttery tasting, using the original recipe, for my taste. 
Served with vanilla and cream ice creams, an absolute hit with family and friends! :-)

I tried this recipe last weekend, I took it to a company picnic and everyone agreed this was the bomb!! I like more cobbler so I doubled the dough and added cinnamon, to the berries I added the lemon juice, vanilla and cinnamon as recommended by another here reviewer, it was perfect.

This cobbler was wonderful!  Just the right amount of tartness for me.  I had a happoy accident while making this though.  I was doing too many things at once and added the wrong ingredient to the wrong bowl. Because of this, I just blended all of the igredients into the same bowl and placed it in a casserole dish. It need 10 extra minutes of cooking time, but it was well-liked by the entire office.

It was very good, but eat it all the first night, as it didn't maintain its texture when stored.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it was still plenty sweet.

An outstanding desert! The topping is absolutely perfect! The only thing i will differently next time is i'll use less sugar in the berries: it was a little too sweet for us, we like it tart.

This was knocked-out-of-the-park good! I made this for our Labor Day dessert, following a couple of perfectly cooked fillet mignons.  Pairted with some vanilla ice cream, this had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.  We will make this over and over again.  Fabulous!

I've made this twice once with blackberries and once with wild blueberries.  Both were really good.  I added cinnamon and extra lemon as suggested by other reviewers.  As good as this was still warm from the over it was so much better the next day!  Will definitely make again.

This was excellent and very easy.  My cast iron skillet is very large, so I used a pot to boil the berries and then put in a baking dish to cover with the dough.  The pan I used was a little too small and it didn't thicken as well as I think it would have in a slightly larger pan.  I also added a tsp of vanilla to the dough mixture to give it a little more flavor.  My berries were pretty sweet and so I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar in the berries.  It was plenty, especially because we eat it with vanilla ice cream.

I have been searching for a good blackberry cobbler recipe all summer and I have finally found it!  This one is delicious and quick & easy to make.  I altered it a tad using half whole wheat flour and half white, and I used brown sugar instead of white.  Also, I didn't have a cast iron skillet big enough, so I just baked it in an 8X8 for the same amount of time.  I may make a little more dough next time for this purpose.  All in all, a fantastic cobbler recipe!

Excellent!! Took other reviewer suggestions and cut back sugar to 1/4c in crust and 2/3c in berries and added 1/2tsp cinnamon to both. Perfect! Also, I doubled crust because...who dosen't LOVE crust? However, the crust expanded A LOT and soaked up most of the berry juice leaving the end result with mostly crust and very few berries. Next time I will use crust recipe x1 1/2 instead of x2. Either way 5 stars!

FABULOUS! This is the first time I have ever made cobbler.  It was easy to make and absolutely delicous.  I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.

I made this cobbler and was following the recipe exactly.  When I go to the point where you cook the berries, lemon juice, sugar, water and cornstarch in the skillet; the berries cooked down so much I added about 4 more cups of berries.  It came out amazing!! We ate it hot with home made vanilla ice cream. YUM!  The only thing I would do differently is make about 1 1/2 times the crust for the top.  I almost didn't have enough to cover my cobbler and we all like a lot of crust!

I love this recipe! I made a "healthier" version using 3/4 cups flour and 1/4 cup flax meal in the batter and used 3/4 cup sugar in the berry mix as opposed to the 1 cup in the original recipe. I didn't have lemon juice handy so I just skipped it and I also added about 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter, as well. It was awesome! Thanks so much for the great recipe! This is going to be one of our summer classics.

I grew up in rural WV picking blackberries for my grandmother so she could make us blackberry cobbler for dinner. This recipe, with a few tweaks, is simply perfect - good consistency for the filling and just the right amount of sweet "dumpling" in the cobbler. I decreased sugar in the batter to 1/4c. and in the blackberries mixture to 2/3c. as recommended by others. I also used 1 1/2 dough recipe. I like a tart cobbler so I added an extra teaspoon of lemon juice. F A N T A S T I C !! The dough is very forgiving. I made a bulk recipe and accidentally added an extra 1/4c. (4TBSP.) butter to the dough but it was still perfect.

Like many other reviewers, I usually cut out some of the sugar, but how much I take out depends on the tartness of the berries used. I've used fresh blackberries all three times and it's come out great. This is a terrific recipe, it tastes great when warm and served with vanilla ice cream.

Amanda, thank you for a delightful recipe. I didn't have enough blackberries so I mixed some raspberries, and blueberries. It was wonderful!  I had no problem at all with the consistency of either the fruit or the batter.  I did add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the batter and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the fruit mix.  I also used a little extra lemon juice.  Perfection!

This was really good! I don't like blackberries but my four year old daughter insisted that we get some so we did and I searched many recipes on what to do with them and this was the winner. I made a few minor additions to it, but I'm sure it would have been just as good if I hadn't. I added some peaches with the blackberries and in the dough I added 1 tsp. or so of almond extract then sprinkled the top with slivered almonds. It was great! Thank you for a fast and easy recipe. OH! Also I took advice from other reviewers and cut the sugar back in the berries to 1/2 cup. Any more than that and it would be WAY too sweet I think. This gave everything a nice subtle sweetness, but it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. What a great cobbler it would be with any berry!

This is the best cobbler recipe that I have ever tried(and I've tried most all of them). The topping is EXCELLENT! The sweetness of the recipe was just right. Not too sweet like others that I have tried. I'm VERY impressed. Thanks so much for a new family favorite!

This was EXCELLENT! I did boil blackberry mixture in a saucepan then transferred to a 8x8 deep pan(didn't want it too thin). Dropped the topping mixture by spoonful. Flavor was perfect but too much juice. Will definitely make again but will use 9x9 or 8x11 pan/glass dish and double topping.

Made this the other night with berries that I had in the freezer. After reading many reviews I did double the "crust" recipe, added cinnamon to that and did cut the sugar. By far the best cobbler I have ever had and the best dessert I have ever made. I baked in a 13X9 glass dish. Thank you for such a great recipe and to all for your reviews.

Amazing!  The biscuits came out perfect--crispy on top and not at all soggy.  I made it with mixed berries and added a little cinnamon.

I made this at Christmas and it was great.  I didn't have a cast iron skillet so I transferred everything to a casserole dish.  I did decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup.  Turned out great, got lots of compliments.

Christmas 2011 with Carrizosas  Great, but we need less sugar.....add only 1/2 C sugar to the blackberries. Serve with creme  fraiche.

12/31/11 made for Leakes NYE party....used 1/2 c sugar with berries and just a little less sugar for the crust.

This was great. I think I would make a little more topping. Maybe 50% more because it was very good. And I tried using just 1/2 cup sugar for the berries but it could use a little bit more or just more topping for the sweetness. Great with Homemade Vanilla ice cream from Blue Bell.

This is a great recipe.  Something about cooking in a cast iron skillet.  It turned out great!  It looked good too.  Just stir enough to incorporate the flour.  So beautiful and taste delicious.  I wanted to take a picture, but had guest over. Thank you Amanda

This was wonderful!  Easy and Delicious! works great with blueberries too.  The trick to the dough is to only mix till crumbly, and then sprinkle on top, don't let the dough form like "dough".  I will make this for years to come, thanks for sharing it.

Five stars all the way! I really like the fact you make a pie "filling" before adding the topping. I served a couple of these (one blackberry and one blueberry) at a wedding reception. It was devoured before the homemade pies that were served! I had people requesting the recipe. This is definitely on my keeper list. Can't wait to make it again. Thank you for sharing!

This was a great base recipe for cobbler.  I made a few changes, using blueberries instead of blackberries and instead of using cornstarch to thicken, I used about a TBSP of flour instead.  The recipe was quick, easy and very tasty.  The crust part of the cobbler was nice and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Oh, so good!  I used a 2 QT oven proof saucepan to cook the berries on the stovetop then bake the cobbler in.  Worked great!  The amount of dough was just right.   I added a bit of cinnamon to the dough.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazingly delicious!!  I made it almost exactly as given, with the addition of 1 tsp vanilla to the dough and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the berries (as suggested by many other reviewers).  Also, like others, I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I just cooked it in a skillet and transferred it to a baking dish to bake.  Worked perfectly!  I will absolutely be making this again and will look forward to serving it to friends and family who are sure to love it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I too loved it.  I made a double batch and used blackberries and white nectarines.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla to the berries and then lemon zest and cinnamon to the biscuit topping.  Was heavenly.

Fantastic! I cut the recipe in half and made it in two ramekins for my husband and I and it was perfect. Great individual serving sizes! We picked tons of blackberries but I prefer fresh out of the oven cobbler and this recipe is easy enough to throw together on short notice. I also followed the advice of previous reviewers and cut the sugar and added some cinnamon and vanilla to the dough. Loved it!

I did NOT have a cast iron skillet, so I cooked it in a baking dish; also, I used 2 cups blackberries and then 1 cup raspberries and 1 cup blueberries.  Next time, will try to find a thinner, wider dish so that there will be more topping.

This was a great blackberry cobbler. I doubled the recipe because I have a large (12") skillet and it seemed like it wouldn't be enough fruit and other reviews said you needed more topping too.  I'm glad I did because it turned out perfect. I threw a few blueberries in with it because I had some on hand and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping and a teaspoon of vanilla.  It was wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

This was absolutely KILLER! My whole family loved it and raved about it! Add a little vanilla ice cream and it is absolute perfection! I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I brought the blackberry mixture to a boil in a large saucepan and transferred it to a 9x13 pan. Then I dropped the dough on top and it worked out great! SO SO SO GOOD! I had several people ask for the recipe.

Delicious!  I combined this with the Apple-Berry Pie recipe without the tapioca to make a fantastic apple blackberry cobbler.  Used gluten free all purpose flour.  I am way too lazy to make gluten free pie crust from scratch so cobbler was perfect!

The cobbler was very tasty. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and made a bigger dough to fruit ratio. The cobbler turned out very well. I also used a little less sugar, but that was only because I don't like my desserts too sugary and the blackberries were already pretty sweet. This was a great way to use up the ripe blackberries that were sitting in the fridge. This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for a warm, tasty dessert.

Excellent! Doubled dough recipe, but NOT the sugar (kept it at 1/2 cup for the dough).  Added 6 cups of blackberries instead of 4.  Also, still kept the 1 cup of sugar in blackberries even though there was more of them.  Did NOT have iron skillet.  So, bolied the blackberry mixture on stovetop pan, then added the boiling mixture into 9X13 glass dish, then dropped dough onto that.  Make sure to put on foiled baking sheet.  It was a HUGE hit, and i'm definitely doing this again and again, and again! p.s. I also used the organic frozen blackberries from costco, and they were just as good than the fresh!

This is an excellent fruit cobbler recipe.  I've made it with blueberries once and fresh peaches another time.  My family and guests enjoyed it very much both times.   For a 9 x 13 pan I doubled the amount of fresh peaches, but not the sauce.  I'll definitely will use this recipe again for fruit cobbler.

This blackberry cobbler is amazing! I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I just mixed the blackberry mixture in a sauce pan then poured it into an 8x8 glass dish. This is my new go to cobbler recipe. I have used this recipe for blackberries, triple berry (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries), peaches, and apples and they were all amazing. My father-in-law actually said the peach was the best thing he had ever put in his mouth.

I thought this was a perfect recipe for our thornless blackberries which are fairly tart.  The only change I made was not to use a cast iron skillet.  I used a stockpot to heat the berries and then poured them into my preheated round stoneware pan (pampered chef).  It was the best recipe we have found for our berries!  Thank you so much!

This is an incredible recipe.  The amount of sugar doesn't make it overly sweet, but it can be reduced a little according to personal preference.  I added a little cinnamon to the berries and dough which added a nice dimension, but the recipe is perfect just the way it's written.  I made it in a ten-inch cast iron skillet and it was the perfect size.

I'm not sure I liked the thickness of the blackberry mix - too much cornstarch for my taste I think. I only put in a half cup of sugar into the berry mix as I had very ripe, freshly picked blackberries which were super sweet. The crust I messed up on my own. I decided to try to make it with half white half white whole wheat flower and it came out with a funny, slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, it was enjoyable but next time I'd make it with all white flower and less cornstarch.

This was very good! I would say if you are using wild and very tart berries go ahead and use the total amount of sugar recommended here. I also used a 9 x 13 baking dish as I didn't have an iron skillet and I might make a little more topping next time. My kids loved it and I enjoyed it also. Good combo of tart and sweet!

This is a perfect recipe. Thanks so much for the upload! Not only does this taste like heaven, but I had to make no modifications whatsoever.  I have made this 2 times, at my husband's request.  The only thing I do is use frozen blackberries instead of fresh since they are a bit hard to find sometimes AND I don't like that fresh berries tend to go bad a lot faster than I'd like.  I read past reviews and I don't think this is too sweet.  With any sweet kind of fruit I would have been scared to put in that much sugar but blackberries tend to be quite sour and need a lot of sugar to balance them out. I would make as is first, then if it is too sweet I'd lower the sugar amount next time. Better it coming out sweeter than sour but that's just one girl's opinion :). Oh and on another note, I usually tend to substitute spread for butter for a healthier version of my recipes, however I noticed with spread the dough came out fluffier and didn't taste as good as when I put regular butter in.  Usually we don't notice the difference but in this one I did.  I think I will stick to butter for this one. Oh, and no iron skillet for me, I just used a 7x11 baking dish w/ perfect results!

Simple and yummy!  I used 1/2 c. white whole wheat flour, only 1/4 c. sugar in the batter, and scant 1/2 c. honey in the berries in lieu of sugar.  Next time I would try 1/3 c. honey.  No need for the foil lined baking sheet with my cast iron skillet.

I also used whole wheat flour rather than the white flour and splenda (cooking) rather than sugar.  It was a bit too heavy with the whole wheat flour, next time I make it I'll use less.  The taste was wonderful.  We enjoyed it for a couple of days.  I do not have a cast iron skillet either and used a pot to boil the mixture.  I put the mix in a pie dish, it did run over.  Next time I'll be sure to put the cookie sheet below it.  It was fabulous with ice cream.

This was delicious!  I added cinnamon to the topping as recommended by other reviewers and it was delicious!  I have made this several times.  The first time I added vanilla to the blackberries as recommended but I added too much and it was way too overpowering.  I left it out after that, and it turned out perfect.  I used frozen blackberries but I will try it soon with fresh blackberries.  I made it in an 8 X 8 pan, rather than cast iron skillet and it was great!  The best blackberry cobbler ever!

I halved the berry portion of the recipe in order to make sure there was enough topping. Also, instead of all regular sugar I had to use some brown sugar because I ran out of regular sugar. It still turned out great in spite of (or perhaps because of) this change. I also forgot to bring the filling to a boil (I just put it in the oven in a pyrex dish rather than the cast iron pan) and I used frozen berries. This is my new favorite cobbler recipe!

This is an excellent cobbler recipe. As suggested in other reviews, I added a little cinnamon to the berries and to the topping and used one and a half times the recipe for the topping. Having used thawed berries I added a bit more cornstarch. Make it, you will be glad you did! Thanks, AmandaLyneal.

I also added cinnamon to the dough. Mine came out especially liquidy...maybe because I added the berries when they were still a little damp. Tasted delicious!

I think this recipe is perfect as written.  I made it just like the recipe said and absolutely love it!  I took my first cobbler to work and everyone there loved it.  There were no leftovers.  One co-worker (who is 65 years old) said, "I haven't had anything this good since my grandmother was alive".  I told her I could stop baking now because that was the ultimate compliment and I can't top that!  I have a sweet tooth so I don't think it is too sweet.  I didn't hear anyone else say it was too sweet either.  I had a cookout today and the cobbler was a big hit today as well.  I used blackberries that I picked last night from my yard.

This is soooo good!  As per other suggestions I doubled the topping (though ended up not quite using it all) and transfered it into an 8x8 pan since I don't have an iron skillet.  I also added cinnamon to the topping, and it was fabulous!  I took it to a church potluck and I had two people tell me how delicious it was and then ask me if I knew who made it.  One of the women said that everyone was asking her if she knew who made it and her reply was "Just because I am coming back to take the last 2 pieces doesn't mean I know who made it."  It was a big hit for sure.

I doubled the topping ingredients as other reviews suggested, and boy am I glad I did.  Any less and it would not have covered the whole thing.  It was tasty, but I gave it 4 stars because for me it was too sugary.  As a Texas girl, I adore blackberry cobbler, and I will try this again but with 25% less sugar all around.  It did make a nice gooey filling and the dough part was not too heavy or crumbly...YAY!

Very tasty and easy to make. We used 3 cups frozen blackberries and 1 cup frozen blueberries and it was wonderful. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cups and it was perfect for our taste. I rolled the dough out to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut out into circles and layered on top of fruit to look pretty. I then sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top. Will definitely make again and again! Thank you!!!

This is waaaay too sweet. My husband, who is a major sweetie, wouldn't even eat it. I followed the rec from a couple others who said it needed more dough. Didn't help. The berry mixture was so disgustingly sweet and the bread didn't have too interesting of a texture/flavor. Definitely do NOT recommend this recipe.

This was so delicious and so fun to make with blackberries we had picked!  I cut the sugar down about a third and it was plenty sweet. I also do not have a cast iron skillet, so I just put it in a casserole dish to bake it.  Served it with vanilla ice cream.

I made 1 1/2 times the dough as suggested by others, but otherwise followed the recipe and this was fabulous! The crust was the perfect texture as was the filling. It is rather sweet, so if you like yours more tart I would reduce the sugar a little. I will definitely make this again, and try the topping with other fruits, too.

This receipe was so easy to make and soooo good. The only thing I did differently was cut the sugar to 1 cup. My husband and I picked several gallons of blackberries this year. I made the first cobbler by the recipe. It was good but a little sweet. I had frozen some berries and used them in the second cobbler. I couldn't really tell much difference from the fresh vs. frozen berries. Both cobblers were absoluetly fantastic.

This is a terrific straightforward cobbler recipe.  I added a few shakes of cinnamon to the dough but not to the blackberries.  I find that the lemon and sugar enhances the flavor of the blackberries enough.  As my cast iron skillet is MUCH bigger than the suggested size, I cooked the berries in a sauce pan over medium heat and then traferred them to a round casserole dish.  It turned out perfectly as is if you don't like your cobbler too doughy (like we do!).

My dad LOVES blackberry cobbler, so I made this for him for Father's Day. I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I just boiled the berries and cornstarch mixture and transfered immediately to a 9x13 dish. I doubled the crust mixture, but I think if you do that, you should add more berries and liquid...maybe next time I'll just 1.5 the topping.  I like a little liquid in my cobblers.  Enjoyable! Thanks for the recipe! Ally

Made this for my Christmas dessert and served with vanilla ice cream. YUM!  This was very,very good.  Everyone loved it.  I will be making this again, maybe changing the fruit next time to try it something different.  Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe!

Absolutely outstanding! The only change I made to the ingredients was to add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to each the dough and fruit batters, respectively. I brought the fruit batter to a boil on the stove and then poured into a prepared 9x9 pyrex pan, topping with the dough. This worked perfectly baking for 20 minutes. Topped this off with homemade vanilla ice cream. This is truly a delight for the tastebuds. Thanks so much.

This was AMAZING!   I didn't modify anything, followed the recipe as was.  The flavor was a perfect combination of sweet and tart.  Not too overpowering in any way.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  My husband and I ate practically the whole skillet full in one sitting.

I think next time, I'd cut down the sugar in the blackberry mixture by 1/4 of a cup, since this was really, really sweet, but otherwise we loved it.

Great quick desert that can be made even quicker. I’ve made this cobble almost a dozen times. The following are my tips:
The berry filling ratios can be varied to accommodate the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit. For sweet berries use a little less sugar. For juicy fruit, double the corn starch. Taste the fruit before adding the cobbler dough and adjust for sweetness and thickness.
The recipe works well with peaches, apples or whatever fruit you have on hand, just adjust the ratios. Don’t have four cups of fruit? No problem. I’ve made it with only two and it still comes out fine. You just get more cobbler per bite!
A 9” cast iron skillet works well for the base quantities. If you only have an 8” skillet, reduce the fruit or suffer the mess. A baking dish or individual ramekins also work well.
As others have stated, a pinch of cinnamon is nice.
Time saving tips:
Mix the fruit and sugar in the skillet rather than a bowl. Mix the ¼ cup water and corn starch in a small bowl. Then, once the fruit has almost reached its desired doneness, add the water and starch to the fruit. Continue cooking and mixing until the juice is no longer milky (just a minute or two)
Make the dough in the work bowl of a large food processer. Add all dry ingredients. Mix until consistent (10-30 seconds). On a cutting board, chop butter into small pieces. Add butter to the dry ingredients. Pulse a few times. Then add boiling water. 
This is a bullet proof recipe for new or experienced cooks.

I didn't have skillet so I used an 8x8 casserole dish and we only had 2 cups of berries, which was fine as we all prefer more cobbler than berries. This recipe was excellent!

Per other reviews I doubled the topping and added cinnamon to both topping and blackberries. It was DELICIOUS! However, everyone that ate it had a bright blue tongue and teeth and even brushing didn't help?

AMAZING!!!!!! I have made this recipe twice, and it was the BEST cobbler I've ever had. The topping was gooey and moist, and crispy on top. I tried a different cobbler recipe with peaches and the topping was dry and fuffy. I WILL NEVER use another cobbler recipe again. This one is amaing. I wish I could give it 6 stars!!!

Loved it!  Made it gluten free, used a brown rice all purpose flour mix.   I also used four heaping cups of frozen blackberries instead of fresh.  It turned out marvelous if I have to say so myself.  Everything I kept the same. A must try!

I used 4 cups of frozen blackberries but I think after thawing and draining there was less than 4 cups.  I made the fruit filling in a saucepan on the stove, cutting down the sugar to 3/4 c.  I wish I'd cut it more.  I added just a touch of almond extract.  I poured the hot filling in a glass Pyrex pan and then topped with spoonfuls of the topping.  I sprinkled a bit of Turbinado sugar on top.  My husband called it a foodgasm.  It was a bit sweet for me.  I think it would be good with Costco's frozen three berry mixture.  I will be making this again.

EXCELLENT!!!!!  I don't even like blackberries, but I absolutely LOVE this cobbler!  I used my mother in law's cast iron skillet and it turned out hot, bubbly & BEAUTIFUL!  And the scent of blackberries lingered throughout the entire house to boot!

I doubled the batter as some reviewers suggested, but think it was too much crust for the amount of fillling.  Next time I'll 1 1/2 times the batter.  It's very easy to sub honey for sugar in the berries, and it makes it a lot healthier (put 1/2 c. honey).  I also subbed half whole wheat flour, and it was good if you want it to be more healthy. 

I'm giving this 5 stars because my Argentine husband who doesn't particularly like a lot of traditional American desserts said that it was good.

The best cobbler ever! I alsp made it with blueberries and it was just as fabulous.  It is now my special dish that I bring to potlucks... The crust tastes like a sugar cookie.  I add 1 tsp. vanilla to the berries, and double the topping recipe... I cook the berries in a sauce pan on the stove top and then transfer it to a pie plate to bake. Super easy and impressive!

Awesome recipe and super easy. I cut the sugar as suggested (and because my fruit was sweet) and made the cinnamon and vanilla extract additions. I used half the fruit instead of double the dough because I have a small cast iron skillet and based on fresh fruit I wanted to use up. I used 1 cup each of blackberries and blueberries. One different change I made that I will consider part of my permanent recipe was to substitute blackberry brandy for the cold water. End result was to die for. Thanks so much for the recipe, I'll be passing it on to my daughter asap!

This recipe is loved by everyone in my family!  At get togethers they always ask me to make it.  I did change just a couple things.  I added a tsp of vanilla to the dough mixture.  I also take all of the other ingredients and cook them on the stove top and let them boil.  Then I transfer them to a deep 9x9 pan and top with the dough, then bake.  It comes out wonderfully!  Thank you so much for this recipe, its fantastic!

This was relatively simple to make and the recipe worked well without adjusting the ingredients.  I found the cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil unnecessary -- My skillet didn't boil over or anything.  I wasn't that crazy about the topping -- I wish it had been more like pie crust.  If I make this one again, I'll probably use more blackberries -- The ratio was a bit too much crust to not quite enough blackberries.

What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I echo the praises of this one - it's a keeper!  I did reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup because my berries were quite sweet.

My husband, who isn't a big dessert eater, started out with a small piece of this cobbler. Before I knew it, he had eaten over a third of the dish! I only made a couple small changes, added a tsp of cinnamon to the topping, and a couple drops of vanilla to the berries. Needless to say, this is a new favorite recipe in our house. Can't wait to make this again!

Excellent!  My first time making cobbler, and it was a hit.  I've avoided making it because I haven't liked the topping on others I have tasted, but I had a lot of blackberries and decided to give this recipe a try.  The topping was wonderful, almost like a soft cookie.  I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I followed others' suggestions and cooked the filling in a pan and then poured it into an 8" x 8" baking dish.  The topping as called for made plenty for this size dish.

Oh man this was good! I too don't have a cast iron skillet. I used a pyrex pan and it came out nice and tasty! The only thing I forgot was the butter in the crust! (I know, how could I?) Well I realized it about 3 minutes into baking. Removed it and cut the butter in small squares and evenly distributed it over the crust. Worked just fine! Next time I'll do it right and I'm sure it will even better! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!  However, I would add only 1/2 cup sugar to the berry mixture if the berries are sweet.  Perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an easy family dinner with friends.

I had been craving blackberry cobbler for weeks and made this recipe. DELICIOUS, I know berries can very on sweetness so I took other peoples advice on cutting down the sugar. I started wtih 1/2 a cup of sugar and kept sprinkling and tasting until desired sweetness. and I added the vanilla to the dough as well...delicious but next time I am using more berries.

Wonderful. I will use a little less sugar next time just because I am not a huge sweets person. I love the way the cobbler gets a almost carmelized crunch to it.

This was my first time making cobbler, and I couldn't have asked for better results. I used frozen blackberries and will probably use a little less sugar in the filling next time. I also cooked the filling in a saucepan and then poured it into a 8x8 glass baking dish before spooning on the topping. I sprinkled on some sugar during the last 15 minutes of baking which gave it a nice crunchy texture. The filling was thick and gooey, and the topping was buttery and tender. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. Mmm, perfection. I'll have to make 2 next time :o)

This is an amazing recipe! Only lost a star because I altered the recipe like others had suggested. I made 1.5x the dough and added some cinnamon. I'm glad I used more dough, as there would not have been enough otherwise. It came out perfect and amazingly delicious!

That was good. I think it's not complete without some vanilla ice cream, (which we had), but it is absolutely worth a try.

3 out of 6 loved, loved this (the rest don't eat berries so they didn't even try).  Very good hot with ice cream!  Simple to prepare - I followed suggestions and added a 1/4 tsp to each the berries and the cobbler and baked in a casserole or 8x8.

Fantastic!  I do not have a cast iron skillet, so I cooked the blackberries in a large saucepan, then transferred to a 9x13 glass baking dish before topping with the dough.  It came out perfectly!  I did 1 1/2 times the dough ingredients and it was just the right amount to cover the blackberries pretty well & still see some peeking out.  Made this several times during the summer with fresh blackberries from our yard and everyone that tried it LOVED it!  Definately a keeper!

Waaay good! This was so delicious, and was such a big hit at the BBQ I took this to (in the skillet and all - great presentation), that I froze a bunch of blackberries and plan to make this as an alternative Thanksgiving dessert. One note - depending on your berries (mine were uncultivated), you may want to prepare a few extra and strain some of the seeds - mine was a bit crunchy.

Have to say this recipe let me down in a big way, it's way too sweet as written! IF I make again, I'm going to cut the sugar in the berries to a 1/2 cup.

Mmmmm! Picked blackberries from a local farm and was clueless what to do with them. Glad I found this recipe. I read a lot of other suggestions and this is what I did: (1) doubled dough mixture but stuck to only 1/2 cup sugar. (2) Only added 1/2 cup sugar to berry mixture as my berries were very ripe (3) Didn't have iron skillet, boiled berry mixture in saucepan, poured in a 9X12 baking dish then plopped the dough mixture on top by teaspoon full. I really like this recipe because you can't go wrong with it! I'm anxious to try different fruits. Excellent!

Easy and pretty quick prep too.  Made for my grandpa's birthday and we all loved it. I used just slightly less sugar.  This would be good with lots of fruits. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

Wow...this was amazing!  I usually prefer a crisp over a cobbler, but this was absolutely delicious!  I made exactly as the recipes says.  I will definitely make this again, and maybe experiment with some other fruits.

Delicious. I made 1 1/2 times the crust recipe,  cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and used blueberries. Next time I will cut the sugar more as it was a bit too sweet for us, but a great, easy recipe.

I followed this exactly except I doubled the dough as many people suggested. I made this for my family and we liked it ok, but I will not make it again. First of all, doubling the dough was way too much. I would 1 1/2 it. The taste was ok, it was the dough part. I am used to having a cobbler with pie crust type dough. This dough when cooked, was more like a greasy cake batter. Just not our favorite. I will try a different recipe.

This is the first time I have reviewed a recipe on this site, but I had to give my two cents on this one.  This is the best cobbler I have ever had!  I cut down the sugar to half a cup in the filling just as a personal preference and added a dash of cinnamon to the dough.  The first cobbler was gone in 15 minutes and I already have requests for two more!  Thank you for posting this one.

This was really terrific.  I did make a few changes similar to what was suggested.  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the flour mixture. And an additional 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the berries.  I also reduced the sugar in the berries by 1/4 cup because I'd just picked the berries and they were just perfect.  I think adding the vanilla to the flour mixture thinned it enough that when I put it on top of the berries, I was able to pat it out a little and it made the topping thinner and crisper.  My husband, who "doesn't like blackberry cobbler" had to eat humble pie tonite - he loved it.  Great recipe and comments.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious cobbler. I used fresh blueberries from a local farm and the family just loved it. Couldn't be easier, will make again. I did cut the sugar back a bit as well.

Overall this was a very good recipe. I took the advise of some other reviewers and doubled the topping recipe because that is my favorite part of a cobbler, but I thought it made way too much for the amount of blackberries. I also added cinnamon to the topping and that was very good! Next time I make this I want to try sprinkling the crust with a little sugar before baking to give it a crunch and I think I will reduce the amount of sugar in the blackberries by 1/4 cup.

This has got to be the best cobbler ever! I did have to cut the sugar a bit, I did 1/3 c in the batter and 2/3 in the berries. I also added a tsp. vanilla to the batter. That was plenty sweet for us. I also cannot use cast iron on my stove top, so I just boiled, poured into an 8x8 pan, dropped the dough by spoonfulls on top and baked as directed...This is the only cobbler recipe I will use from now on, just perfect!

I am giving this four stars because any mess ups were my fault.  I didn't make this as stated and I am sorry I didn't.  I took the suggestions and used less sugar and added cinnamon.  The cinnamon was a great addition, however decreasing the sugar was not.  It made the dough too salty and the berries were too tart, I guess, to decrease the sugar.  Make it as stated first..then decide.

Without a doubt, this is the best cobbler recipe I have found!  Most end up cake-y or like a crisp.  This is what a Texas girl calls a cobbler!  Love it in the cast-iron skillet, too.  The second time I made it I did cut down on the sugar, but I think that just depends on how sweet the blackberries are.  I also add a little cinnamon to the flour mixture.   I can't wait to try this recipe with fresh peaches, too!!!  YUMMMMO!!!!

This is awesome. Didn't have that many berries so I cut back on the sugar and reduced it some more so it wasn't super sweet. Lots of topping--PERFECTION!

I tried this recipe because it was so much easier that rolling out the dough as I usually do, and the reviews were so good...but My family and I didn't care for this.  The crust was cakey, so this is probably personal preference.  We like the rolled crusts with some strips dropped in the berries before cooking.  This was kind of dry, not juicy. Sorry, but I will stay with my own cobbler.

I'm not a big blackberry fan, but I really enjoyed this recipe. I never knew to actually cook the blackberries. I think this recipe would be great with strawberries as well. This recipe would be great warm with vanilla beam ice-cream and a cold glass of milk! I took this cobbler into work and let it sit on the table in the middle of my team. It was gone by the time I left work. And due to the holidays there was only 3 on my team, which meant that 3 people ate the whole cobbler. The only thing I may change is to add a little bit more sugar to the batter. Other than that, it was great!

The suggestion to double the dough recipe is good advice.  I used the cinnamon, as others suggested, and felt it was not needed; save it for apple cobbler.  I made it in a large iron skillet, which was a quaint way to serve it up, but the pan was so heavy it was difficult to handle.  Next time, I will make it in a large ceramic casserole dish.  The crust was delish!  The berry mixture tasted wonderful.  If only blackberries were seedless….  But that's not a fault of the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  Great served hot with vanilla ice cream.

My family and I loved this recipe!  We first tried it with fresh blackberries and it turned out splendidly.  Just a note.  It is most definitely better if you double the topping as others have said.  I added 1/4 tsp. Allspice and 2 tsp. Vanilla which it needed for the warm homecooked flavor you want.  Also, don't skip the cast iron skillet.  It adds so much to the presentation.  When I made this again it was with peaches and my husbands co-worker said it was the best he had ever had.  Thanks!

Wonderful! This is the first cobbler I've ever made! I also added cinnamon to both the topping and fruit. Although, it would had been fantastic without it! Thanks for the recipe. I've already past it on to my neighbor because of course I had to share the cobbler!

Having an abundance of blackberries this year, I needed to use some. This recipe is wonderfully easy, and tastes great on top of all that. I used splenda in place of the sugar and did cut back on the amounts called for and used an 8 x 8 pan. Next time I will double the amounts & make a much bigger cobbler. (maybe I can share it then, maybe not!) Thanks Amanda. My Mom is from Hustonville, Ky. Just right outside of Danville & we were there quite often when I was little. Kentucky is a GREAT place to live. I  live in Burlington, Ky. Thanks Again !!!

The taste was very good, but there were a few problems.  Even after baking for longer than the recipe stated, the toping still wasn't done in the middle.  Also, my inner-pastry-chef balked at the idea of adding boiling water after cutting in the butter--I just couldn't do it!  So the flavor was good, but I will be trying other cobbler recipes in the future.

Awesome! Used 1/2 as much butter, and less sugar. The dough wouldn't spoon, so i just grabbed some and dropped it on top. Will make again for sure.

I think I put too much hot water in the topping because it pretty much just flattened out over the blackberry mixture after it baked, but it was still delicious and very easy to make.

It was very good. I put it about a 1/4 cup less of sugar than it called for. I think I like more of the dough than this recipe calls for - maybe I'd do one and a half times the dough next time. But if you are making this and taking it somewhere MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SET before you go. I made this last night and took it to a friends - it went all over the car!

This was a wonderful cobbler recipe. I followed the recipe but I added a little lemon zest to both the batter and the berries. Next time I would use less sugar but the juice and the texture was the best.

I've been looking for a good cobbler recipe, and this is it!  I followed everyone else instructions on making a 1.5 batch of the cobbler crust, but didn't reduce the sugar at all (we like our cobbler sweet!).  I changed it a bit, in that I rolled the crust into balls and then flattened them (sort of like little cookies) before putting them on top of the fruit (in order to make a more "cobbled"-looking crust and to have it cover more of the filling).  Worked perfectly!

I made this in my mother's 50-year old iron skillet. I didn't need to double the dough as some readers suggested...the amount stated was just right for the skillet.  Everyone raved about this cobbler. Even my 85 year old mother who is considered a master at making cobblers said over and over "Now, that's good cobbler!". I used 1/4 cup sugar in the topping and 2/3 cup sugar in the berries, as another reader suggested and it was perfect. I baked it 10 minutes longer than suggested. I served it with vanilla ice cream.  Great recipe!!

I did not care for this one at all, I did not find it to be sweet and don't think it needed the lemon juice which gave it a sour taste to me. I don't understand all the 5 star reviews.

This is the perfect recipe for using fresh berries!  As did many other reviewers, I used a little less sugar in the berry mixture, and added cinnamon to both the topping and the berry mixture. I also doubled the recipe for the topping.  Definitely remember to put a foil covered baking sheet under your skillet...as I forgot to during the first 10 minutes of baking and spent hours cleaning my oven!  Using the cast iron skillet gave it quite the southern touch!  And coming out of the oven it was beautifully bubbly!  Delicious when served warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping!  Will for sure make again!  I plan on using fresh peaches and red raspberries as substitutes after blackberry season is over!

This was delicious... even though I made a mistake or two. I didn't read the recipe through before I started cooking and realized halfway through that I didn't have a cast iron skillet. I threw the berry mixture into a 8x8 baking dish and topped it with the dough mixture (I know other review said to double this, but it was just enough to almost cover the smaller baking dish. I increased the baking time to 40 minutes and it turned out really well. Next time I might reduce the amount of sugar in the berrie mixture because it came out a little too sweet for my taste. The addition of some other types of berries might be nice, too -- maybe raspberries for a little extra tartness. I served it warm with fresh whipped cream. My husband loved it.

I had some blackberries I bought and wanted to make a blackberry cobbler, but my cookbook didn't have the recipe.  I searched and found your website and got the recipe for the cobbler.  I didn't have enough blackberries for the recipe, so I adjusted the ingredients myself and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the dough mixture at my husband's request.  It turned out great.  *** Added note on 4/29/07-  I am making the cobbler again today and when I went to change the servings from 8 to 6, I noticed the directions stayed the same.  The water and sugar amounts should have changed, but it was for 8 servings.  Please check to make sure your directions have changed when you change the number of servings before you prepare this, or it could end up a disaster.

Absolutely fabulous. I made this for my family's Valentine's Day dessert, it was a HUGE hit. I did as others had mentioned and made 1 ½  the topping, added cinnamon to dough and berries, reduced sugar to 1 ¼ cups.  Also used frozen 3 berry mixture, brought to boil on stovetop and transferred to a casserole dish.  It was SO great with vanilla ice cream.  We will definitely make again and again!

Got some of the last-of-the-season blackberries picked yesterday.  Made this according to recipe right down to the cast-iron skillet, which was a fun way to prepare it.  I did sub 1/2 whole-wheat pastry flour for 1/2 of the all-purpose.  Next time, would reduce the sugar in the berry mixture; just a little too sweet for us.  And I would double the batter; not much of it there.  I did use a #8 (10") cast-iron skillet since no mention was made of the size skillet to use; think I'd use the next smallest one next time. Great with a dab of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream on it!  Thanks, Amandalyneal!

Excellent! Fllowed recipe for most part --used a bit more sugar didn't even measure amount and add 1/4 tesp. cinn to berry mixture and dough. I did use a fry  pan but not cast iron --stainless steel with T-fal came out great. check your pans before using. Thanks for great dish

I prepared this recipe according to Breeze's suggestions,  using her cooking method and adding the cinnamon, as well. The only complaint I have is that there is not enough topping.   More of that, and we've got a 5 star recipe! Heaven on a plate with a bit of vanilla ice cream... Will add this to the permanent file, with those changes. Thanks!

This was great, used SPLENDA instead of white sugar.  Tasted very good and didn't alter the recipe in the least.

This was VERY easy, which is great. But I found that it needed to cook a little bit longer than called for. Also, I would double the 'dough' portion of the recipe (which, fortunately, is very easy) - but that just may be my taste.

"Ow, my pancreas!" 

After significantly reducing the sugar (1/2c) we did a taste-test and then added even more flour/butter/berries to further dilute the sugar content. After all that it came out pretty good. 3 stars only because I hate type-II diabetes.

Awesome.  This lasted about 5 minutes after I started serving it.  Yes it could be made w/ 1 cup of sugar total, but great as it is.

I was rushed to make a quick dessert for the family on a week night when I found this one. I had some frozen blackberries and this was a huge hit with everyone.  I wouldn't change a thing. Simply delicious and with ice cream..Out of this world.

Delicious! Brought me back to my childhood in Tennessee with my grandmother!  I doubled the topping and also added more blackberries (about 5 more cups).  I made enough to put all in a 9x13 glass baking dish.  We like a cobbler with more fruit and the topping baked into the fruit, absorbing juices (not a cake type of cobbler with more topping than berries).  My grandmother put cinnamon in hers, so I added about 1/4 tsp per 4 cups to the blackberries and sugar.  I also reduced the amount of sugar in the blackberries, following other reviewers suggestions) to 1/2 cup per 4 cups of blackberries.  Squeezed fresh lemon juice into the blackberries and then put the mixture on the stove to bring to a boil.  Once the blackberry mixture boiled, I poured the berries into the glass baking dish and then dropped the topping onto the top.  This cobbler was fabulous, just perfect!  My kids loved it as well as my brothers (we used to pick blackberries for my grandmother's cobbler--it was a favorite and worth any amount of thorn pricks).  Thank you for this recipe!  You brought wonderful memories to life for my brothers and me with this yummy, perfect blackberry cobbler.

Really good!  It was just right for the sweetness and tartness.  The crust was delicious too. I doubled the topping amount and I'm glad I did.

The berry mixture was WAY too sweet. I would cut the sugar in the berries by a third, or maybe even half.  The dough mixture was just meh.  It was odd and gooey, but not in a good way.

I have made this twice and it is delicious. The dough is wonderful. I do use an 8x8 pan and add a few more minutes baking time, but I use the ingredients as written. I am going to try the dough out this weekend with thickened canned peaches.

Good recipe however, I should have made it solely on the original recipe..instead I read other reviewers that claim it was too sweet so they cut back on sugar..in my opinion it needs all the sugar as it was too tart for our taste..also it took 45 minutes for it to bake. At 25 minutes it was raw dough underneath yet golden brown on top.. I turned the oven down to 375 and baked another 20 minutes checking the dough with a toothpick every 10 minutes..I will definitely make this cobbler again..(I used an 8x8 baking pan with 4 cups fresh blackberries which was 3 packages of berries..)

I made a triple batch in a large glass pan. I used half the called for sugar for both the berries and the dough and substituted whole wheat white four for regular flour. It was a HUGE hit. Thanks for this recipe! It is better than my family recipe (please don't tell grandma).

I tried this with blueberries because that's what I had on hand. I cut down on the sugar as per other users, and used 1/2 c in the blueberries, but I did use the full 1/2 c in the crust which was nice because the butter and salt balanced it just fine.  Especially if you serve with ice cream. Easy, quick, and we LOVED it.  Some of the dough baked downward and was soaked in blueberry juice but not soggy...the rest was crispy and perfect!!!

This was awesome and super easy. It took longer for for the butter to melt in the oven than it did to assemble all the other ingredients. I doubled the recipe and to simplify the ingredients for the filling I used one can of blueberry pie filling and two cups of frozen blueberries, then I didn't add any extra sugar on top. Came out perfect and delicious!

I am not normally a dessert maker or baker, but we have a backyard full of blackberries and so I looked up this recipe. It was so easy!! I served this to my neighbor and my family and they all loved it. Next time I make it, I will make more dough, add vanilla and cinnamon to make it even better.

just what i was looking for! i only had enough berries to fill an 8x8 pyrex dish- frozen. i'm all about throwing things together, so i placed the frozen berries into a greased 8x8, sprinkled 2 tbs sugar, 1/2 tsp all spice, and 1 tbls lemon juice. decreased the sugar in the flour mixture by 1/2 cup and put all the dry ingredients + 1/2 tsp cinnamon into a bowl. thinly sliced cold butter and mixed with my hands until butter + flour mixture was crumbly. added 1 tsp vanilla, mixed with wooden spoon, and then poured 1/4 cup boiling water into the mix until just moistened. plopped spoonfuls of batter into the frozen berry mix and then put in the oven. my "4" button doesn't work, so 395 it was. don't know if it was the frozen berries or cuz my rack was in the middle, but it took 50 min for the top to brown. this dried out the topping in the most delicious way possible. since i didn't do the whole pre-boil with cornstarch, the berry mix was pretty watery, but still awesome. i had leftover tiramisu filling (custard + marscapone) that i put on top, and it was delicious. i will pick more blackberries just to make this cobbler. that topping. :9 yum. versatile. loved it.

Best cobbler recipe I've tried and with a berry loving husband plus living in the Northwest with lots of berries available I've tried a lot of different cobbler recipes. Only difference I would do next time is cut back on the sugar a bit (depending on the sweetness of the berries) and definitely double the cobbler topping.

I really liked this recipe, a lot. But, it was a little plain how it was, so I added cinnamon to the cobbler thing on top and I added peaches to it and that made it really special. I did, 2 cups blackberry and 2 cups peaches and it turned out great. Defiantly worth trying.

I am in love with this recipe. I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking but this recipe wasn't too difficult at all. I doubled the recipe for the dough but I kept the same amount of sugar since a lot of the reviews commented about the sweetness. It came out perfect. Definitely glad I lined the cooking sheet with aluminum. I didn't understand why that was necessary at first but after it was in the oven I was grateful I followed that instruction. I will have to make this more often. I would give it ten stars if I could.

It was very good though I have a few tweets, add a tad bit more water too the mix for the crust, and that's it! This was an amazing cobbler. My family loved it!

This is, by far, the best recipe for cobbler that I've ever tried.  Wouldn't change a thing!  This goes into my 'special recipes' folder for future use.

I have made this twice & make it in the square stoneware pan from Pampered Chef, which is the perfect size for this recipe. The only things I change are I add cinnamon to the dough & dot the berries with 2 Tablespoons of butter before I top with the dough.  Delish with vanilla ice cream.

I made this as directed for the most part.  My changes were for the cast iron skillet part.  I boiled the mixture in a regular fry pan and then the put sauce into an 8X8 casserole pan.  I also added a bit of cinnamon to the batter and some vanilla to the sauce.  Really excellent!  Hubby couldn't keep his hands off so I am making it again today!

This is a fantastic recipe! Not only is it simple and relatively quick, but all of the ingredients are likely to be lying around in your pantry already. It doesn't fall apart when sliced like other cobblers do, but it still has that soft cobbler texture with the crunchy topping and everything. I did reduce the sugar slightly as a personal preference, and I also added quite a bit of extra lemon juice. These changes worked very well, considering two people ate the whole thing in one evening. I will definitely make this recipe again!

A definite keeper for when I have any fruit to use up but don't have oats. I also used less sugar and added cinnamon. I found I needed to bake it longer than the recipe stated. Sooooo delicious.

This was really good. I added cinnamon and used half brown sugar. You could also substitute diluted apple juice for the cold water for a little more flavor. I used half blackberries, half diced fresh peaches and put it all straight into the oven (just baked it for a little longer).

Wonderful cobbler! I made some changes to make it healthier. Using fresh wild blackberries from my yard, I halved the recipe. I used white whole wheat flour and half of the butter as coconut oil, and the crust was still crumbly and delicious. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 c., and baked about 15 minutes. Made a delicious, just- sweet- enough breakfast!

LOVE!! The suggestions made by kachell99 [less sugar, add cinnamon and vanilla] are perfect. This is a great potluck dish. It's easy and quick, and you'll be bringing home an empty dish. Most desserts that taste this good are completely devoid of nutritional value, but the berries make this almost wholesome. Granted, they are smothered in sugar and caked in butter... mmm CAKED, but really, this hits the spot like a sheet cake, but with some redeeming nutritional value.

Very good. I forgot to add the water to the dough and left it in the microwave. Not sure what effect it would have had but the crust was great and several people commented that they loved it. I did double the crust.

I made this with fresh strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. I put less sugar in dough and fruit because I like a little tang instead of extra sweetness. It was delicious!

Delicious!! Definitely make 1.5 or 2x the dough.  I used frozen organic berries, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg to the dough, and also a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the berry mixture. I decreased the sugar by just a little (less than a quarter cup).  I sprinkled some cinnamon and brown sugar on top before baking.  Also, I used Trader Joe's gluten-free flour (husband has a gluten sensitivity). Turned out incredible!

This was so great!  I made it for my tough-critic love, who claims to loathe ultra sweet dishes and bread-y type desserts.  I listened to the other reviewers and decreased the amount of sugar in both the dough and the berries, as well as adding a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg, too.  Came out perfect and beautiful to the eye, too!  Boyfriend said the amount of sweetness was exactly right.  Will definitely be holding onto this one!

First off, I want to stress that the amount of sugar you use will vary based on the sweetness of your berries. I bought beautiful blackberries that turned out to be mouth-puckeringly tart. I used the full amount of sugar and felt it still could've been a little sweeter. (We didn't serve it w/ice cream or whipped cream, I'm sure that would've helped offset the tartness of the dessert, as well.) Also, I made the mistake of following other reviewer's suggestions and making 1-1/2 times the dough recipe for this and it was just WAY too much dough. It didn't seem like too much when I dolloped it on, but it cooked into very thick blobs that sucked up the berry juices. I looked back at the recipe and realized that it doesn't specify the SIZE of the skillet, which will change the outcome of your cobbler. I used a 12" skillet, which spread my berries out more so the actual level of fruit was relatively low, especially after cooking down. As a result, a lot of thick dough covered a thin layer of fruit, so it felt too doughy. If you use an 8" skillet, you could possibly get away with those thicker blobs of dough since you will have more fruit per serving. Personally, I would've like more FRUIT with my dough, as opposed to the other way around. As for that dough I keep talking about :), I didn't care much for it, however my son and husband like it. I think if I had followed the directions per the recipe this would've turned out much better.

Nearly perfect! Decreased the 1 cup sugar in the fruit to 1/2 cup and it was fine. Second time I made it, I used blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and fresh peaches. It was really nice. Increased fruit by 1 cup but can also easily see this with 6 cups fruit instead of 4 or 5. Never boiled anything on the stove top as the oven baking is sufficient. Never needed to put anything on a lined baking pan. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RECIPES! Very reliable.

Tasty biscuit topping but the berry part was way too sweet for me. Maybe I just had fabulous berries, but next time I will make this with just 1/2 c sugar in the berries. Also, I cook in cast iron a lot but did NOT like it for this recipe. The left over cobbler was completely ruined with the acidic, metal flavors the next day. Next time I will cook this in glass or ceramic.

This cobbler is SO good!  I took the advice of others and doubled the dough recipe (using 1/2 whole wheat flour, and it turned out great!  Also only used 1/2 C sugar for the doubled dough recipe and added some cinnamon, too.)  It is easy and soooo delicious!

Simple and perfect.  The only changes I made were to bake in an 8x8 and proportionally increase the ingredients for the dough.  Otherwise, the recipe as is would not have produced enough to my liking, at least.  I chose it because it contains lemon, which reminds me of this amazing lemon sauce my grandmother adds to her blackberry cobbler.

I cut down on the sugar as most other reviewers suggested and it was fantastic! If you use store bought blackberries- definitely cut down on the sugar, but if you are using wild- then the sugar is necessary! A definite winner!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! This recipe is easy to make and I receive so many compliments everytime I make it. I follow the instructions exactly aside from occassionally mixing another type of berry in. I love this recipe and will be making it for years to come.

This was delicious.  My 80 year old father savored
every bite.  I also doubled the topping, added cinnamon and used 5 cups of blackberries.

I followed the suggestions of the reviewers, and for once, it was a mistake. Doubling the dough is just too much!!! And the seeds were everywhere. My mother in law has a recipe without the seeds, Ill have to follow hers next time!

I made it exactly as written EXCEPT I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon over the top before baking.  It came out wonderful!  Excellent recipe, thanks!

Love!  I added a little vanilla to the batter and the berries.  I also cut down on the sugar like the other reviewers suggested.  I like tart. It was so good.

My family is used to pie crust topping instead of a biscuit so I knew we would like this. I didn't bother boiling the water for the dough.  I use more/less sugar and water depending on the fruit.  This works well with all of the fruit I have tried.  I add lemon juice, orange peel, cinnamon to various ones.  You can also not cook all the fruit from the very beginning.  Some will be very soft and some will have more texture.

Great recipe, but a little bit sweet. I will probably use only half cup in the fruit mixture next time. Also i think the fruit filling is a little watery if served while still warm. But the taste is wonderful.

The cobbler itself was absolutely delicious, warm with some ice cream but Holly Cow, $12.00 for out-of-season blackberries.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again until our Okanagan Valley blackberries are ready.

Needs longer in the oven (the way we spread our batter anyway). Perfect taste and consistency though!

This was really delicious.  Even my hubby loved it, and he doesn't always like fruit desserts.  I didn't have enough blackberries, by about half, but I made the recipe anyway, since we like the bread of a cobbler a lot anyway.  It probably would have been better with more berries, but it was still Fab!  Also, I substituted the appropriate amount of "baking" Splenda for the sugar, and I used my calphalon pot instead of my cast iron one, since I only have army-sized cast ironware.  I will defititely be making this every time blackberries go on sale at Costco.

My husband has been asking me to fix a blackberry cobbler.  I tried other "family recipes" and they were a flop.  This one was fabulous!  He loved it and woke the next morning looking for more!  Thanks!

This recipe is SO GOOD. My fiancee and I made this and probably messed up on it alittle, but it still turned out really great. Make sure you let the cobbler cool for a bit before you dip into it...It's like soup if you don't.

Personally, I doubt I'll make this recipe again.  My husband loved it, but the crust would need to be doubled and something needs to be done to make it less tart.  It tasted like there was no sugar/sweetener in it!  This was great for my hubby, but not for me!

This recipe is one of my favorites on this site! My family lovesss it and it is soo simple! The only thing I do and you don't have to is add a little cinnamon to the dough as other reviewers suggested. I served with vanilla bean ice cream and WOW! I have made this over and over for many guests. Thanks for sharing!

WONDERFUL! (Dare I say) even better than my grandmother's.  I've made this several times and it is just so delicious. My husband, our friends, and our family eat it up every time. I do increase the dough by half, and add cinnamon, and decrease the sugar a little. It's so easy to modify exactly as you like it. Will always be my go-to cobbler recipe. Yay!

An amazing recipe as is!  I've made it several times, always with great results!  This has become my go-to cobbler recipe.  A few tips  - If your fruit is really ripe, I do recommend reducing the sugar in the filling a bit. But it really just depends how sweet you like it, and how ripe/sweet your fruit is.  -If you love cinnamon like I do, feel free to add a dash to the cobbler batter.  A splash of good vanilla never hurt anything either.  Those additions made my husband describe it as "the best ever!" -I recently made it with blueberries as well as blackberries, with that modification I should have added more corn starch, as it didn't thicken as well with the berry switch.

One of the hallmarks of a great recipe is when circumstance forces the substitution of key ingredients and it still turns out exceptional.  In my case, I substituted frozen blueberries for the fresh blackberries, and Bisquick for the all-purpose flour.  Yet, it turned out delicious, and the consistency of both the baked crust and the filling is spot-on perfect.    I also modified the recipe by adding 1/8 cup of bourbon (Wild Turkey, though I suspect that JD would be perfect in this application) and placed the skillet directly on the oven rack (instead of on a foil-lined baking sheet; didn't see the point of that).  In short, this is a scrumptious, easy dessert recipe that's hard to mess up and pairs beautifully with some fresh whipped cream.  Thanks for posting it!

AMAZING!  I cooked the berries over the stove in a regular pot, then transfered into a 8x8 dish and topped with the dough, since I don't have a cast iron skillet.  The second time I made it I made an extra half of the dough, since I didn't think there was quite enough.  Didn't change the recipe at all, it was so tasty!  I top with some whipped cream and my husband tops it with vanilla ice cream, and we can't get enough.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful!  Only thing I did differently (aside from needing to make a baking powder substitution...) was to add some cinnamon to the dough.  My 9 year old said "I don't like warm fruit but I *love* this!!"  We will definitely make this again--probably a few more times this blackberry season!

delicious!! i have a super sweet tooth and this was too sweet, so cut back on a little sugar. I agree with putting the cinnamon in the dough and berries, along with the vanilla. Gives it that little extra something. About 1/4 cup too much sugar.

This recipe is fantastic!  I picked a pile of fresh blackberries today and found this and whipped it up.  very easy to follow recipe.  I added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough mixture to give it some extra flavour and it came out beautifully, thanks!!

Very easy and versatile recipe.  This was the first cobbler I've ever made and everyone loved it!  I used frozen berries, reduced butter to 4 tbsp, used brown sugar for the berries and 1/2 the recommended white sugar for the dough.  It still turned out great.

Great recipe!  I don't know why everyone talks about having to double the dough.  You are supposed to bake it in your cast iron skillet on top of a baking sheet to catch the drips.  If you don't have a oven-proof skillet, then I suppose you will have to double, but the amount of dough is fine if you follow the directions.

This was good tasting, but I agree with the other reviews, you need to double the topping. I made this in an 8x8 with no threat of overflowing. Would of liked it to be thicker. I also added cinnamon to the topping and vanilla to the berry mixture.

This was an AMAZING cobbler!! I did do as some of the other reviews mentioned and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the dough mixture, 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the fruit mixture, and 1 tsp vanilla to the fruit mixture. Serve it with ice cream and it is truly HEAVENLY!

This is the VERY BEST cobbler I have ever had and my whole family thinks so too.  I cannot describe to you in words how good this is.  You just have to make it and experience it for yourself.  My family likes this made for them on their birthday instead of cake, and I can make a mean cake.  Try and you will not be disappointed.

Absolutely delicious! But I did have to double to crust - there wasn't nearly enough. Also, the listed baking time is too long. I took it out after 20 minutes and it was perfect.

Left out one star because I had to modify by doubling the batter and reducing the sugar.  With that it was verrrryyy yummy.

This is extremely close to my grandmothers recipe that I have been trying to rediscover for years. The only difference is the dough. This recipe's dough comes out very, very soft. I would like to try this with a little tougher breading... Otherwise this is a wonderful recipe. In fact I use this exact recipe for all our cobblers, peach, apple, AND blackberry

Awesome.... I did not have that many blackberries, used 2 1/2 cup fresh berries and 2/3 amount of the crust recipe, baked in 9 inch pyrex pie dish...very nice. Ha also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup in crust and 1/2 cup in berries. My berries very too tart and little more sugar would have been better but this was not bad either. Also added cinnamon and vanilla extract to dough. Served it with icecream..yum...guests loved it. Will definately make again.

Made this today and it was awesome, I did add cinnamon and vanilla to the dough part and it was really good, but I also tried it before adding them and I'd say it's good either way.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe.  I did not care for the blackberry seeds but everything else was wonderful.  Next time I'm going to strain the sauce and thicken it a little more to make up the difference.

This was my very first cobbler.  For a first attempt, it was easy and soooo good!  To make a smaller portion for just me and hubby, I used half the berries/sugar mixture and 3/4 of the dough, while reducing the sugar as others suggested.  The mixture fit perfectly in an 8in cast iron skillet and came out perfect.  Excellent recipe!  Looking forward to trying other berries or fruits the next time.

MMM, WoW!! Very delicious! I reduced the amount of sugar on both the dough and the filling based on most reviewers and completely agree. I might reduce it even more next time. Of course, the amount of sugar will depend on the sweetness of your berries too so go ahead and taste your berries first and determine for yourself. This cobbler is truly delicious!

Outstanding cobbler. My wife thought it tasted like twinky cake. We bot enjoyed it and I don't like blackberries. Instead of butter I used butter flavored crisco.

This is a stellar recipe.  Following some previous reviewer's suggestions, I made half again as much cobbler topping.  I also reduced the sugar to just 1/2 cup in both cobbler and berry mixtures.  I'm glad I did because it was quite sweet enough.    I used frozen berries and had no trouble at all.  I cooked the berry mixture in a saucepan, then transferred it to an 8x8 pan and covered with cobbler.  Baked it for about 30 minutes.    My whole family loved this and we will DEFINITELY make it again!

Excellent recipe, very easy!  I made this for my husband and one of his friends this weekend.....they thought it was outstanding.  I had to use frozen blackberries, but it still came out great.  I made 1 1/2 times the topping as suggested, and it came out perfectly.  I started to make it in my cast iron skillet, but it was actually too big (it's huge), so after boiling, I poured the berries in an 8x8 casserole.  I have been told this is to go in my permanent collection!

fantastic - I used fresh fruit: 3 c. wild blackberries and 1 c. raspberries. I used light butter and a dash of cinnamon in the berries. I used the amount of sugar that the recipe called for and it wasn't too much for the tart berries. serve while its still warm with vanilla ice cream!

Excellent, easy recipe - I used an 8x8 baking dish and it was perfect - I also added a pinch a cinnamon to the batter and filling - I left out the lemon juice, as I didn't have any on hand, and it didn't hurt the recipe one bit.  Definitely a keeper!

I added a little cinnamon to the fruit and the topping, and thought it added a nice touch.  My husband thought it was a little too sweet, but the rest of us loved it as is.  Also, I cooked the fruit in a saucepan and then poured it into a 9x9 baking dish, and it worked out perfectly.

very very good.  I used a variety of fruit, as blackberries weren't available fresh: 2 c. frozen blackberries, 1c. golden raspberries, 1 c. red raspberries, and 1c. blueberries.  I threw in the extra cup of fruit to stretch the recipe a little, along with an extra smidge of cornstarch to even out the filling.  cooked fruit in a skillet and transferred to a casserole dish.  I also sprinkled the top with a combo of cinnamon and sugar, which made it crusty and delicious.  served with vanilla ice cream.    this is the best, thanks for sharing.

I swapped out 1/2 cup flour with whole wheat flour. Also, I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I boiled fruit mixture in a pot and transferred it to a white oval dish. Oh, and I realized I only had 3 cups frozen blackberries, so I threw in a sliced banana...it was delicious. Will definitely make this again!!

This is a great recipe.  My wife says it better than the recipe she has made for years.  I also reduce the sugar added to the berries by 25% - 50% depending on the berries.

This was pretty good! I used tame blackberries, which tend to be more tart, and i actually would recommend increasing the sugar. I also added some cinnamon to the dough, and some raw sugar/ sparkling sugar sprinkles would be nice smashed into the dough on top.

Wonderful recipe, i used some of the suggestions and i think it came out perfect!  I doubled the dough mixture and added about a cup more fruit, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dough and fruit.  The dough was dense and had character (Not too sweet).  I will definately be making this recipe again, and with other types of fruit.

I would give this 10 stars! My husband raved about this cobbler. The integrity of the blackberries are maintained & the crust was supreme! You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I double or even triple the crust recipe depending on who is eating it. Excellent with homemade ice cream.

This is truly amazing cobbler. After serving it at a family gathering, it's the number one dish that everyone, without fail, requests I make for dinners and gatherings. I use a deep round cake pan because I don't have a cast-iron skillet, and sometimes make more crumb mixture if I'm serving someone who likes a bready cobbler. It's likely to bubble over, so do place a layer of foil beneath the pan. If cooked successfully and in keeping with the recipe, this is a no-fail dessert (or, as I've found, breakfast--try it with coffee or hot tea!).

Our local grocery store had blackberries for 99 cents! So we stocked up. I followed the recipe as written, but when it was done I just left it in the oven(cut off) till everyone was ready for it-and it was great.  So good in fact that hubby made it the next night-and doubled the recipe!  I think doubling the dough is a good idea and will try that next time.

Every summer I picked from bushes and gobbled up tons of what I thought were blackberries at our summer home.  I had a passions for my blackberries and since my parents never bought them at the store it wasn't until I was married and mentioned my love to my husband that I realized that that what I had actually been gorging on were black raspberries!  When I realized my error I, embarrassed, mentioned it to my husband but bless him, he continues to bring home these big bland (in my opinion) berries that I care not for!  In desperation, (for I hate wasting anything) I found this recipe and not only did it make the berries taste passable, but I went back for seconds!  This recipe will be used quite frequently as I'm sure my helpful husband will continue to lovingly bring home more of my 'favorite' berries! LOL

This was very good. My husband loved it. I did add the extra filling as others reccomended but I think it would be better as is. I am all about the fruit and would add more berries. I would cut back on the sugar too. I made as indicated but transferred to a Pampered Chef stoneware dish to bake in the oven. Ice cream is a nice add to finish it off. :) I can't wait for next summers berries Yum!

It was good, next time I will add more flour to the berries as they were not thick at all. Also, this made the dumplings a little soggy

I thought this recipe was good. If I made it again I would cut the sugar WAY down, make more batter. The batter was delish but I wanted more! Overall, good recipe

I made this for a dinner party, making 1.5 times the recipe.  I had a few blueberries so I added them to my blackberries.  I would have liked a less biscuit like crust and like other reviewers have said, double the crust mixture.  I would have added an extra tbsp of cornstarch as my cobbler juices were really runny.  Overall a good recipe, maybe next time I'll add a couple dashes of cinnamon.  Great with ice cream!

A very easy and delicious recipe for cobbler. The only thing I did differently was, as many have reviewed, to use less sugar. It was the first time I've ever tried making cobbler and I was surprised how easy it was with this great recipe. I've made it twice already with the blackberries and have even tried using fresh peaches and loved it. Highly recommended!

This recipe was a hit with my family but we cut the sugar in half and it was still sweet enough.  I think it needs a bit more water in the berry mixture so the dumplings remain doughy underneath.

Wow this cobbler is excellent! I halved the recipe so that it made just 3-4 servings since no one needs more than one serving of cobbler around here! I just cooked the blackberries in a pot on the stove and transferred them to a 1 qt dish, cooked for about 15 mins or when the top was golden. Wonderful!

We are lucky enough to have many blackberry bushes near our house and are able to pick enough to freeze for the winter. I increase the number of berries to 6 cups and boil them in a pot on the stove, then transfer the mixture to a 7 x 10 glass dish. I also add 1 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping.  OUTSTANDING!!! I have one in the oven as I type this review.

This is an awesome recipe.  Everyone said it was the best cobbler they ever had.  The cobbler was eaten before the pumpkin pie.  
I also added vanilla in the dough and berries.  I adjusted my recipe to fit a 8 x 11 1/2 pyrex pan.  Using the frozen mixed berries from costco worked really well. I will use this recipe again.  A keeper.

This recipe was GREAT - I read all the reviews about reducing the amount of sugar, but I tasted my berries before I started and they were not sweet at all, so I used the required amount of sugar and it was perfect.  I doubled the amount of dough, and I should have only doubled it by 1.5 - that would have worked better.  My husband loved this recipe.

This was perfectly sweetened.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  I did add some cinnamon to the berries and to the flour mixture.  Wonderful recipe for the cool winter months.

Overall, this recipe was AMAZING. The blackberry filling was the best I've had. I did not care for the "drop dough". For some reason it did not turn out very good. So I am still searching for the best cobbler crumb topping to go with this amazing filling! ENJOY!

This is fantastic cobbler!  Just like grandma's from when I was little.  I took the advice of others and added 1/4t cinnamon to the biscuits and the berries.  Also did the 1/4C sugar in the biscuits and 2/3C in the berries.  Next time I'll try using agave syrup to lower the glycemic index.  I used half blackberries and half raspberry and wow, was that a great combo.  I thought it was beautiful as is, the cinnamon really warmed up the taste of the biscuits, though I'll probably try adding a little vanilla next time, just to see what happens.  I foolishly thought that the biscuit batter would be plenty and folks were just making their biscuits too big, but no, it really does need at least half again as much biscuit batter than what's in the recipe.

Will make again! I just added a little Cinnamon Plus (from Pampered Chef) to the dough. And I used a mix of blackberries and marionberries, and before it finished I added a few blueberries--just to get enough. And this is the first time I have made a dessert in my cast iron, great! But you definitely have to make homemade ice cream to go on top! Thanks!

Excellent recipe-thanks for sharing. 
I used frozen mixed berries and doubled the dough recipe (added a splash of vanilla as well). I didn't reduce the sugar amount. I baked it in a pyrex baking pan ontop of a linked baking sheet.

I tripled this recipe and baked it in my Pampered Chef rectangular stoneware baker. I found the cobbler to berry ratio to be adequate. I used frozen marrionberries and the entire amount of sugar called for in the recipe. It was perfect. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla to the berry mixture, and the freshly grated zest of 1 orange to the cobbler dough. I also grated the butter over the flour instead of cutting it in. This worked well. When I took this to a friend's home, her husband commented that this cobbler was on his top five list for best desserts ever. My husband quickly agreed and wondered when I would make it again.

This is a great recipe! I made 1.5 times the dough, and left out 1/2 cup of sugar as other people suggested. I also added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla to the dough. However, it was a little tart and next time I won't leave out that sugar.

This was so tasty and only lasted 2 days in our house (there are just two of us!).  I didn't have a cast iron skillet so I baked it in a baking dish - and it turned out great!  I made an extra half batch of the "topping" - and it was the perfect amount.  It was very tasty but delish with vanilla ice cream!

This was very good. The only thing I did different was that I used frozen blackberries instead of fresh. I personally thought it was a touch sweet but my husband thought it was perfect. It went great with ice cream! I will make a little more topping next time.

This is great! I followed the other suggestions and cut the sugar. I baked it in a small deep glass pyrex dish so the topping was enough. There is leftover at the bottom I'm planning to use over pancakes tommorrow. I cooked it at 350 for 25 then 15min. more. It was crunchy on top and moist inside. Kinda a cross between a biscuit and cake. Next time I'm going to try cooking it with brown sugar, doubling the topping and cooking it in a larger dish.

This was the perfect way to end a perfect Father's Day.  My husband had requested cobbler for dessert; something I'd never made before.  I'm glad I picked this recipe, because it's certainly a winner and a new family favorite.  Didn't change a thing, except doubled the dough per other reviewer's suggestions.

This recipe was okay, but didn´t turn out as I would have expected. The topping was delicious but not crumbly, and as others mentioned there is not enough topping for the whole dish. The berry part was good, but REALLY sweet. I won´t make this again... :(

I tried this because I wanted to use my cast iron pan for something different.This is exactly what a cobbler should be!! We had guest over and they loved it. I tried it again with fresh cherries (pitted of course) and it was great! I will be making this many more times.

I thought this recipe was great.  I however doubled the crust and added some cinnamon to the crust.  Plus I added an extra dash of lemon juice to the berries.

This recipe is the best ever.  I did make a couple of changes the 2nd time around and everyone raved.  I was out of lemon juice, so I used orange juice and added about a tsp. of vanilla.  Gives it a wonderful taste.  Also added a little cinnamon to both dough and to blackberry mix.  This is already a family favorite.

I made 1 1/2 times the dough and added about 1/2 t cinnamon as others suggested. Also, used only 3/4 C sugar in the berries. Instead of spooning the dough on the berries I crumbled it, made it very appealing once baked. Great with vanilla ice cream!

I too think this is an incredible recipe!  I made one and a half times the crust as well, and this was about perfect, though I think I could have made double the crust and it would be great.  I also didn't cook it in my iron skillet because there wouldn't be room in my fridge for the leftovers if I were trying to store them in the skillet.  One note though for those of you using Dewberries instead of true blackberries, dewberries are not as sweet and I would reccommend using the full amount of sugar called for in the recipe.

This cobbler speaks for itself.  Delicious just the way it is.  I also don't have a cast iron skillet so did it in a baking pan.  The reason for the pan on the bottom is because sometimes when you have boiling fruit it will bubble over and the tinfoil covered pan will save a huge mess in your oven.  Don't take chances, do it, you won't be sorry.

Awesome!  I used brown sugar in the dough, flour instead of cornstarch, canned mandarin oranges(drained), pinch of ginger with the fruit, mixed the fruit right in the skillet, and skipped the foil lined pan.  Turned out beautifully.

This doesn't have 5 stars by chance, it's an excellent cobbler recipe!  The dough was perfect; light, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I cut, by half, the amount of sugar added to the blackberries (I used what it called for with the dough), and I realized a little too late that I didn't have lemon juice so that didn't get added.  I also didn't cook it in a cast iron skillet, I used an 8 inch round instead.  It still turned out beautifully, and I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it exactly. I ended up with blackberries that were waaaaaay too sweet (even to my hubby who loves things extra sweet) and dough that needed to be cooked twice as long that what was stated in order for it to not be raw. I decided to try it a second time, cutting the sugar in half and using biscuit mix to make the dough. It was good, but I'm still searching for a really great blackberry cobbler recipe.

This is the best cobbler recipe I've found. I boil the fruit on the stove and bake in a casserole dish instead of cast iron skillet and it always turns out great. I've used it with mixed berries, blackberries & blueberries with great results.  Everyone comments on how yummy it is. I sometimes adjust the sugar according to the sweetness of the berries and sometimes add a little more lemon juice but it's right on target.  Just a great cobbler recipe.

OH....This is one of the best recipes.  I only had a cup of blackberries, so I transfered them into 2 ramikens & cooked them in a water bath, and they turned out amazing.  My wife nearly threatens me to grab blackberries from my parents house whenever I visit just so I can make this again.

I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so i did this in pyrex and instead of boiling the berries i nuked it for about 2 minutes. then added the "crust" and baked. it took a little longer than 25 to get golden, but that may have been the glass pan...

This is a GREAT cobbler recipe!  I also baked this in a casserole dish and reduced the sugar in the berries some, but it comes out great every time!  What a great way to share your extra berries, this is so impressive and easy to whip up!  (I used my food processor to cut in the butter - super quick!)

this is a delicious and easy recipe!  i did not have a cast iron skillet so i used a stainless steel skillet that can transition from stovetop to oven.  i used blackberries from our garden that are not sweet.  i roughly chopped the blackberries so that they could "stew" better in the sugar.  this yielded quite a bit of juice in the pan so i just added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch.  i think the filling would have been fine without the extra cornstarch.  the filling was perfectly sweet and complemented the topping very nicely.  i served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream.

I made this with a 16 oz bag of frozen blackberries and a 12 oz bag of frozen raspberries (approx 5 cups berries).  I also made 1 1/2 recipe of the topping.  I cooked the topping on the stove in a saucepan and then baked the cobbler in a 8x11" baking pan.  My husband had been requesting blackberry cobbler, and although he said he was expecting the kind with a flaky pie crust, he said this was excellent!  It is the best when warm and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This cobbler recipe is quick, easy and turns out great!  I added a bit of cinnamon to the dough based on previous suggestions, and it really enhanced the flavor of the cobbler.  I did not have a cast iron skillet on hand, to I cooked the berries in a saucepan, and then transferred to a round casserole dish, and it worked beautifully.  I also did not have enough wild blackberries for the entire recipe, so I replaced the remaining cup with fresh blueberries, and was very tasty!  I would highly recommend this recipe, and plan to use all blackberries next time!

I saw a recipe for blackberry cobbler last summer and wanted to try it, but it looked too heavy so I decided to see what Allrecipes had to offer. Our family loved this recipe so much that I made it several times over the next few weeks...it is a family favorite...excellent with ice cream!

I am lucky enough to live in the Mountains where Blackberries grow in abundance.  I loved the topping on this recipe and did mine with half fresh blackberries and half fresh peaches.  I love that combination. I took suggestions on cutting the sugar in half...which was OK..but more would have been fine as well.  However, I and my son both agree, that baking it in the iron skillet ( although very homey ) gave the entire dessert a metallic taste.  I would certainly do this again,,,,using a glass baking dish to avoid the metal after-taste.  Make it "home-spun" by decorating your table with wildflowers instead!  A very nice dessert with afew modifications, and ice cream is a MUST.

I only had 3.5 cups of blackberries so I added 1 cup of blueberries.  I took other suggestions reducing the sugar in the crust to 1/4 cup and 2/3 cup in the berries.I did double the crust recipe and thought it was too much; 1.5 of the crust would be perfect.  I also sprinkled a little cinamon and sugar over the crust before baking it for 30 minutes. We absolutely loved this very simple recipe especially with vanilla ice cream!

The dough part of this recipe is delicious (I'm glad I doubled it!)The blackberry part was perfect (not too sweet- probably because my berries were very tart)If you doubled the dough I would recommend that you bake it slightly longer.

Quite possibly the BEST cobbler I have ever made and eaten! I follwed other suggestions and cut the suger to 1/4 cup in the crust and 2/3 cup in the berries. I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to both crust and berries. Cooked for 25 minutes and served with vanilla ice cream. I had a cast iron skillet so I made everything in that! Wonderful!

WOW! A very delicious recipe! The only thing I changed was cutting back on 1/4c. of sugar. It was perfect! Not too tart, or sweet! Next time I will double the topping recipe! Would be great with vanilla icecream!

We LOVED this recipe.  It comes out beautiful each & every time.  We've substituted blueberries for black & it's even better.  Hands down, it's a winner.  The bonus is being able to utilize the old family skillet!  You will not go wrong with this one.

After reading other reviews, I decided not to use as much sugar as the recipe calls for. EXCELLANT cobbler. I used fresh blackberries and it was perfect. The skillet presentation is great. It's even better ala mode. YUM!!!

This cobbler was a good, solid dessert and was a good way to use up a bunch of berries my mother in law picked for us.  However, I can't 'rave' about it because it didn't seem like anything special to me; just plain old 'good'.

If you want to ruin a lot of beautiful fruit add all the sugar recommended in this recipe. It is WAY too sweet! Also, cobbler batter made with water instead of milk or soy milk does not yield a dumpling that bakes properly. The batter browned on top but was gummy in the middle. The proportions of sugar should probably be 1/4 cup with the fruit and 1/2 cup in the batter.

I like the recipe because of the concept of making a cobbler in a cast iron skillet. Other ideas like preparing the fruit in the cast iron skillet, adding batter on top, and then baking in the oven is a great idea!

Sprinkled the berries with some sugar, flour and doubled the berries and lemon. Sprinkled 1/2 a half a cup of melted butter over the berries. Left off the boiling water and corn starch. Cooked the berries over the stove to soften then placed in a 9  X 9. Added two eggs to the cobbler  batter which  turned the cobbler more into  cookie in the middle and crispy slightly chewy on the edge. Baked 350 for 25 minutes. Served with vanilla ice cream.  Delivered to a sick friend... so hopefully turned out... smelled wonderful.

My husband’s favorite.  We have fresh blackberries and ,y husband and son in law pick buckets at a time-provided I make this as a reward!  I cut the sugar in half, as we don’t like super sweet desserts.  Quick & easy to make, smells wonderful.  Served warm with ice cream, can’t be beat.

I had more than enough dough the way it cooked up. I actually needed more berries. Maybe it was that I used my largest cast iron skillet.

I only will make it again with the original dough part.  Doubling the dough part made too much dough which absorbed most of the juice part of the cobbler.  The taste of it was delicious, even the dough, but it was just too much bread.

Absolutely excellent! Not too sweet, not too tart. The crust is perfection...light but rich and perfectly crisp on the top.  I made this for a visit with my husband's very southern grandmother yesterday and it did not last long.

This was easy and really good. The only thing I changed was a reduction in sugar. I used 1/2 cup in the batter and 1/2 cup with the berries. I also baked it in a small Pyrex dish.

I wanted to love this but... It was way too sweet and the clumps of dough on top of the cobbler was awful. If you’re going to make it then I would suggest that you sprinkle the crumble across the top of the cobbler instead of dropping it by spoonfuls.

Such a easy recipe to throw together and great results!   I do not have a cast iron skillet so I used a 8X8 square baking dish and found it to be the perfect size for this recipe as written.  I added a pinch of cinnamon to both the dough and the fruit filling and only used 1/2 cup of sugar for the fruit filling.  Tasted great and it was plenty sweet for our tastes.

There is no other recipe even close.  This is THE ONE. I followed others' advice and made half again as much dough. I was multitasking and miscalculated the water, so it was more like batter than dough.  I poured it over and went for it anyway.  It was still AH-MAZING. Precooking the fruit in the iron skillet is definitely the key to a great cobbler.

Really enjoyed this. My first attempt at making cobbler and I think it turned out well. I only made a half recipe and took some other reviewers’ suggestions like reducing the amount of sugar. Kind of wish I had tried the cinnamon in there too. I really liked the texture of the dough/crumble on top. Didn’t have cast iron, so poured the berry mixture into a Pyrex then put dough on top and baked.

I made it with the video instructions. Did use a cast-iron for the berries but transferred to an 8x8 casserole dish to put in the oven. Best cobbler ever!

It was good but way too sweet, and I like sweet! I would definitely cut back on the sugar next time, I should of listened to the reviews on that recommendation.
The crust was delicious, I added the cinnamon, as recommend by other reviews. For any vegans out there I used "Earth Balance Soy Free buttery spread" for the ingredient of butter- so my cobbler was vegan too :)
I also did not have a cast iron skillet, so I made the blackberry mixture in a sauce pan and then poured it into a baking dish. 
I also doubled the topping! that's a must!  
I still can't get over the sweetness, I thought maybe because I used frozen (organic) blackberries, but that was the only ingredient listed "organic blackberries" I can't imagine someone enjoying this much sweetness, it really needs to be cut down, it kind of ruined it for me. 
Overall I will definitely use this recipe to make blackberry cobbler, but cut back on the sugar! :)

Definitely needs at least 1.5 times the batter and less sugar unless you like it quite sweet.

I have made this twice, the second time I put the cinnamon in the crust.  Didn't really like it.  We must be purist.  LOL  But it is an easy cobbler.

I followed the recipe to a tee. It was very very good. The only thing I will change next time is to make more dough for the topping as other people said. Other than that, it was delicious.

I made a smaller cobbler using the full amount of batter. I didn’t have a skillet to start in so I just baked at 400 for 35 minutes. Turned out excellent! 2 thumbs up!!

This is the best cobbler EVER!   Anytime you use a cast iron skillet, it's got to be good!  I did add more butter to the crust because I couldn't get it to get crumbly.

I will make this again-a real hit with the family!  The only change I'll make is to add some cinnamon or nutmeg to the pastry dough.  Took about 30 minutes in the oven to get a golden top.  I have a deep cast iron pan, so I used about 6 cups of berries and added an extra tsp corn starch to the mixture to account for the extra juice.

I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I used a regular skillet then transferred the berry mixture to a ceramic baking pan and completed the rest of the cooking in the oven. My dinner guests loved it.

This recipe was a hit.  I cut the sugar in half for the blackberries and the dough.  I though it was still a tad sweet.

Fabulous!  Based on reviews, I reduced doubled the topping and reduced sugar to a total of 1/2 c. in the topping and 2/3 in the berries.  Plenty sweet.  Making it again tonight.

I made this as the original recipe with no changes to the ingredients, except I did use blueberries instead of blackberries. I didn’t have a cast iron skillet so I used my 12” oven safe skillet. Came out good!  If you double the topping like some have suggested you’ll probably want to use a larger pan than I did, or a baking dish. I will make this again ??

I didn’t have a small cast iron pan and couldn’t use my big one because I had to halve the recipe due to the fact that I only had two cups of blackberries. It turned out to be delicious anyway!!  Just the right amount of sweetness. Fantastic. And easy.

Works well even with half sugar.  I had good luck without a skillet by adding some dough to the mix before transferring to a glass baking dish. Don't use a too deep a dish during backing.

Excellent!! Read the reviews and made a little extra dough, added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  VERY GOOD RECIPE.   Used cast iron-good choice. My husband loved it.  We thought at first it might be too sweet but the tart berries are perfect.

We loved the flavor and texture of this.  Rich flavor, sweet but not too sweet, and great with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  We've done it a few times now and used gluten free dough and had just as good results.

Followed others suggestions, adding 50% to dough, an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 the sugar for the berry sauce.  I also used 50/50 mix of blueberries and blackberries.

This is delicious! Me and a friend picked fresh blackberries before coming back to the house to make this. 
The only thing I would say is that you have to be careful with the crust. It is delicious! However,  if you're not careful, it won't  cover the whole thing

I have made this SO many times and it's always delicious and the pan gets cleaned! Tonight for the first time I made it using a batch of sour plums that I didn't know what to do with...absolutely outstanding!!! It surpassed the blackberry version, to my family's delight :)

Made it a 3-berry cobbler instead, using raspberries, blueberries and blackberries...wonderful.  I also added cinnamon for some 'warmth'.   The pan size suggested made my cobbler not look as full, so i'm going to bump up the portions next time.

I honestly did not have time to read any reviews at all as I needed a super quick dessert made and cooked in 45 minutes. Well this fit the bill. I made it exactly as specified in the recipe but.....I didn't have the cast iron skillet so I boiled everything on top of the stove and then poured all the fruit mixture into my Pampered Chef deep dish pie plate. I was short on all the blackberries the recipe called for so I added a diced apple to the mixture. Topping was made exactly as the recipe stated too. Absolutely outstanding and so very easy. Served with a good quality vanilla  ice cream. A definite keeper.

Mine only took 20 minutes and I still a little over done, I should have kept an eye on it instead of walking away. I’m just glad I checked on it at 20! This recipe always turns out amazing, love it.

It was pretty good overall, I doubled the topping and I should not have because I didn't have enough fruit.  I scaled the recipe down for 2 servings, yet doubled the topping to serve 4.  Sometimes the other reviewers suggestions are not the best for the recipe!  I will make this again, but the next time make sure to have enough fruit.  I did add orange zest to the batter and also the fruit.  I also sprinkled sugar over the batter before baking.  The flavor was good overall.

I made this several months ago and my husband STILL talks about it, saying it was one of the best things he has ever eaten.  I did use homegrown (given to me) blackberries, which really makes all the difference.  Can't wait until next blackberry season so I can make again!

This was a hit with the family, including my sister in law who is an amazing baker! I used an 8x8 pan so I didn't increase the dough and I'd say it was about 90% covered once it was baked. I did add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a tiny pinch of nutmeg to the dough, and another 1/4 tsp to the berries. Also used frozen blackberries and it was perfect. Will definitely be making this again!

This is my favorite desert recipe. Definitely increase the dough (I increase it by 1/2). Also, I dust the top with cinnamon for presentation, add cinnamon to the dough too, and use frozen or fresh blackberries or mixed berries (either is fine).

This recipe is so delicious. The biscuit part is absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe, except I added a little dash of vanilla to the biscuit part. I also boiled my blackberries in a regular pan and then put them in an 8x8 baking dish, then spooned the biscuit on top to bake. Turned out amazing.

This topping has a cake-texture to it.  I was looking for one that was crisper and a bit crunchy, so was disappointed.

*This was WONDERFUL!*...I 'adapted' it a bit:  made in a 8" x 8" square baking dish (after boiling blackberry mixture on top of stove and adding it to the buttered baking dish BEFORE putting dough mix on top).  I decreased the amount of berries (to 2 cups...as that's all I had!)...and the amount of sugar in fruit mix (by 1/2 cup)...and it STILL was absolutely *YUMMY*!  I can't wait to try it with other fresh fruits (peaches/mixed berries/blueberries/etc...)

Very easy, and tasty as well.  I will jump on the bandwagon and say less sugar (I do not like overly sweet or rich things - though I am the only one that felt it was too sweet) and more of the dough (that is really tasty!), but again.. everyone else was happy with dough amount so really its picky and fine-tuning to tastes.  I will make again (with less sugar).. probably often.

This is a great recipe, the best cobbler I've had since I was a kid.  I made a couple of changes based on some of the reviews.  To be honest I always tweak new recipes.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dough & the blackberries.  I also increased the dough recipe to 1 1/2.  I took it to work & they cleaned the bowl.  It has become my new go to cobbler recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was delicious!! I used some frozen berries from last season.  Cooked on stove first and then transferred to a 9x9. I doubled the topping but that was a bit too much. Definitely make sure you put a pan underneath.

So easy to make. And so delicious. I followed the video tutorial and it was quick and tasty. I also added cinnamon to the dough. Used blueberry and fresh blackberries. Next time I might use a casserole dish as there was a lot of spillage onto the baking sheet.

A tad too sweet for my taste next time I'll decrease a bit of the sugar or add more lemon juice. Had to drastically drop the oven temperature to avoid a burnt cobbler. Added a vanilla blueberry cream topping sauce and a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream with almonds. Delightful.

This recipe is great and super easy. Our berries were really tart and we like that tartness so I used 6 cups of berries instead of 4. I kept everything else the same. I recommend reducing the amount of sugar if sweeter fruit is used.

Only used 1/2 cup butter and used wild dewberries we picked at our ranch and it was A HIT!!!  Made it twice already and family and friends all loved it.  Took leftovers to the office and they went nuts!  Will make it again with whatever fresh fruit I get!!!  Oh, I added cinnamon and vanilla to the dough and it made it perfect!!

This is a good country cobbler recipe. I agree, it is a bit overly sweet, and definitely double the batter. It really does need to be cooked in cast iron for consistency and flavor. I will use this recipe again, but I will dial back the amount of sugar in the berry mixture. Even half the amount would be fine.

Outstanding and so easy!  It was slightly too sweet so I will decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup. Made it last weekend and plan to make it again this weekend with less sugar. This recipe is a winner!  Don't hesitate to try it.

Yummy!  I just made this and ate it with vanilla ice cream while still warm. Wow!  I doubled the recipe and did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to batter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to berry mixture. It's worth it.

So I love the recipe made it last night.  Only issue I had was WAY to SWEET.  Im guessing because my blackberries where VERY sweet to begin with.  Next time I will adjust sugar to the sweetness of the fruit.  When I saw all the sugar being measured out.....my cooking radar said um looks like a lot of sugar and I was correct.  My guess is half the sugar will be better.  Also I added some cinnamon which made my dough kinda brown but the taste was so yummy. Also I used double the lemon and glad I did as it dulled the cloyingly sweet sugar taste and I use some lemon peel also yum

It was a big hit for our Christmas dessert. Taste, excellent. I had a divided response to doubling the topping. Suggestion, instead of doubling, increase ingredients by 1 1/2. I will try that when I make it again. I served it hot out of the oven topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This is a great recipe.   My daughter and I even ran out of butter and replaced it with olive oil still turned out perfect.   We doubled the dough as recommended and turned out amazing.   We now have a new family recipe for the holidays.   Thanks for passing this one around whoever originated It!!!!!

It was definitely easy and I made some changes based on other reviews that probably improved the recipe (less sugar, more lemon, add cinnamon and vanilla), but I didn't love it. Everyone else thought it was great. I'm used to cobblers with top and bottom crusts; this was more like cooked fruit with dollops of cake. Again, easy and tastes good, but not my idea of cobbler.

Excellent recipe!  I did, however double the dough ingredients, and as others suggested added cinnamon to the fruit and the dough mixture.  I cooked it in a cast iron skillet-delicious!

I made it as is, otherwise no point in rating. Excellent and easy, BUT would definitely cut back on sugar , perhaps about 1/3 less for the fruit portion.

Very easy and quite yummy made as is, but i strongly suggest a piece of foil on the baking tray or you will have a lot of scrubbing to do.  It does spill over.

This is an incredibly good cobbler. Someone gave this recipe a 2 star and said it didn't have any flavor....Don't listen to that nonsense! Easy peasy to make and tastes fantastic. You won't be disappointed!

After reading the reviews, I did cut down the sugar. I used the full amount in the biscuit topping, but cut to half the amount of sugar in the berries. It turned out absolutely delicious! I quite agree this is the right amount of topping and does not need to be doubled.  I think this is the best cobbler I have ever eaten! (And I have eaten many.)

Would make changes. The boiling water kind of messed with the biscuity topping & I would double the topping. I can't blame the runniness on this recipe, because I didn't precook in a skillet...and I used arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch, which usually works, but didn't this time.

I took other reviewers suggestions and added some cinnamon and vanilla to the crust.  I thought it was a little sweet, so next time I plan on decreasing the sugar by about a 1/4 cup.  I also use frozen blackberries and cooked it in a 9x9 pan and I thought the amount of topping was perfect.

This turned out great and was simple to make! Decided to use a baking pan instead of a cast iron pan this time out but will use it the next time.

I didn't double the dough recipe as per the recommendation of other reviewers but will consider it.

I've made this cobbler several times and we love it. It never lasts long in my house. I usually add a little cinnamon to the dough. I've doubled this recipe without issue. It's delicious! I love it paired with some french vanilla ice cream.

It turned out great! A friend hanging out with me while I made it said it was the best he's ever had. 
I did add a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to the dough. And cinnamon, ginger and vanilla to the berries. I will probably add a little more cornstarch next time for more thickening.

After 'Game of Thorns' blackberries picking at the back of our farm, I decided to try this recipe. Our blackberries' sweetness level is medium. I used one half lime juice (no lemon in the house) and soak the blackberries in the sugar mix for several hours in the fridge before cooking it. I doubled the crust like others' suggestions. Oh my goodness !!! Top with the ice cream and it's heaven on earth.

I baked this in a 8x8 dish and I think 9x9 would work too but it would be more difficult to spread the cake batter.  I read the reviews and know our family's preferences, so I cut the sugar in the berry portion down to 1/2 cup.  My family didn't care for it.

I added cinnamon as some suggested, and baked it in a casserole dish because I was afraid that it would stick to my cast iron skillet.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  It wasn't too sweet;  it was just right,  and my husband is begging me to make it again

My first time making cobbler...and this was AMAZING! Truly, everyone loved it and I couldn't be happier (cobbler is my favorite dessert).  I DID double the topping recipe (although didn't quite use all of it). I DID add a few things that were suggested: cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to the topping batter. I did NOT add any sugar or anything at all to my berries. I used a large bag of frozen mixed berries: raspberry, blackberry, blueberry. I drained and rinsed them first...let them hang out draining while preparing everything else.    I DID cook it in a coated cast iron skillet.    This is our new Independence Day dessert! DELISH!

10 stars!! This was so yummy and easy to make. I literally went out and picked the wild blackberries and made a cobbler. I read other reviews about adding cinnamon in both the dough and the blackberries. I also doubled the dough and it was perfect. I will definitely be making this more often!

Holy hell, this is good!! I've never made cobbler before, but am now hooked! I had a bunch of overripe berries (blue, rasp and black, plus a peach)...and needed a home for them...so I tried this out. I took the advice of other folks on here and doubled the batter, and reduced the sugar by about 1/3. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to both the berries, and the batter, as well as some vanilla bean. Rather than white sugar, I used brown in the berries, and added a little orange bitters to them as well..and the end result was epic.

This recipe is exactly what I was hungry for.  The only change would be to double the dough recipe (because it is so good).  I used a large cast iron skillet and it worked fine.  Will definitely make this again.

I used 3 cups of berries, and one cup of jazz able. The mixed combo was even better than plain blackberries. I also added oats to the crumble mix. Turned out great!

This cobbler is amazing!!  We picked fresh blackberries and I ended up using most of them in the cobbler (well worth it).  When we pick blackberries again I will know to get even more so I can make this wonderful cobbler again.  I don't have a cast iron skillet so just used a Corning dish and it worked just fine!

Excellent Recipe my family's favorite! The only thing I do differently is add vanilla and cinnamon to the crust, it just takes it the next level ;-) Like many others I decreased the sugar too.

Love this recipe! I have made it with blackberries, cherries and blueberries and it’s always delicious. I up the amount of berries depending on what I have. Last time I used 6 to 7 cups of frozen blueberries and still only use 1/2 cup of sugar and it’s plenty sweet. The great part of this recipe is when using frozen berries you unfreeze them when cooking them in the skillet so the berries are precooked and thickened before going into the oven. Love this recipe!

I used frozen blackberries and had to cook it longer than what was stated in the recipe. I didn't read the instructions right, so all the sugar went into the crust, but it still tasted great. I also added some cinnamon to the topping. So yummy!

This was deeelish.  I added a touch of cinnamon and doubled the batter. Those were the only changes I made. Next time I will reduce the sugar in the fruit. It was a little sweeter than I like...but the flavor is amazing.

Home cooked goodness!  I took the advice of other reviewers and lowered the sugar and doubled the topping. Glad I did as  it turned out great with just the right amount of sweetness and topping.  Husband dug right in and had two helpings; he just loves it.  I had a piece and think it is awesome. Will be making in the future.

This is a very good recipie but when made in the cast iron skillet it gets a metal irony taste as well as turns your mouth and teeth a purple blue color. I think it has something to do with the fruit reacting with the skillet but isn't good to serve to guests. Anyone know how to fix it?

Followed the exact recipe.  My husband would like more of the bisquit next time, but otherwise, it turned out great.  I highly recommend trying this for your events or family.

So Good.  And it turned our teeth and tongue purple so the kids loved that.  I followed the  advice to make double the crust and to only use half of the sugar in the fruit filling.  I came up short on the blackberries so I made the difference up with frozen blueberries.  I will make this again, with any type of fruit I have on hand.

I would definitely make this again, I used frozen mango, as suggested by others I reduced the sugar and used a pot to make the fruit then put it in a baking pan (I don't have the right size cast iron for this dish).  I used a 8x8 baking pan.

Didn't have any white sugar, so I subbed brown.  Put only a 1/2 cup of sugar in the berries, and used a frozen berry medley. It came out great!

Excellent. I used half the sugar in the fruits and it was plenty sweet. I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I cook the berries in a regular pan and poured into a 9 inch pie plate. The juices over spilled, because the pie plate is shallow . I will use an 8x8 pan next time. I think this recipe will be also great with peaches in Summer time.

I followed the recipe rite down to the cast iron skillet. It was different. Definitely not a traditional blackberry cobbler! I made it for thanksgiving and to my horror all of my guests had a dark blue hue on the teeth and tongues!

I made this but I sort of modified the recipe.  I am sort of lazy so I used frozen black berries.  I cut way back on the sugar to 1 table spoon in the berries and two table spoons in the topping.   I did not go to all the trouble of bringing the black berry mixture to a boil.  I just threw it into the pan, plopped the topping on top without  the 1/4 of boiling water and into the oven.  Needs more topping in my opinion.  Next time I will increase by 1/2.

Excellent choice!  I didn't want to make any changes until I knew what the base recipe created, so I changed no ingredients...and wow!... I loved it as-is.  My wife had 4 friends over just as I took it out, and after they all sampled sampled mine (with vanilla bean ice cream accompaniment) they collectively cleaned the pan...and these aren't big women!  I did use Pampered Chef stone 8x8 instead of iron skillet for baking.  I will make that again... and soon, I only got serving!

I cut the sweetener by 1/4 cup and replaced 1/2 cup of the total with Splenda (my berries included 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda, and my crust included 1/4 cup of each). I also boiled the berries in a regular pot before transferring to a glass baking dish (one size smaller than a 9x13, whatever that is precisely...maybe 8x12?). The crust just about covered the top with a little space around the edges (next time I might try a smaller pan), and the whole thing offered up 12 small servings of roughly half a cup each...although I doubled up in the grownups' bowls. The flavor was quite good (starting with good berries) but where the recipe really shone was in how fast it came together.

My first time to make a cobbler, and it was a success! The only thing I changed is the amount of sugar (1/3 cup for topping and 3/4 cup for the berries). I used frozen berries and it still came out great! The family loved it so much!

Delicious, but I also cut the sugar in the berries by half.  This would depend on your berries and personal preference, of course, but I prefer my desserts to not be super sweet.  This is super easy and fast if you assemble dry ingredients in food processor and then use it to cut the butter in.  Then dump into a bowl and add the water.  I drop the batter by spoonfuls into the fruit instead of trying to make it cover the whole top evenly like some reviews complain that it doesn't.  I think they are missing the point.

I made this just like the video showed and the more we ate it the more we liked it, except for the fact that it was very seedy.  I made the original recipe a couple weeks later and decided trying to eliminate most of the seeds. I used about 6 cups blackberries and added enough water to bring them to a boil, then I mashed them through a strainer, scraping underneath the strainer.  I ended up with 2 1/2 cups blackberry juice.  I continued following the recipe and it made a delicious cobbler with very few seeds.

We went berry picking over the weekend, and this is the recipe that I chose to make my berry cobbler.  I followed the directions while taking the opinions of all of the other reviewers.  I added a dash of cinnamon to both the berry mixture, and the dough, I decreased the sugar by half, and I doubled the dough recipe.  It was actually quite bread-like,so if that's what you like, then double it.  If you like more berries, than I wouldn't mess with it.  I had two family members tell me that they wish I hadn't reduced the sugar in the dough because they would have preferred that it be sweeter. Overall, it's a nice cobbler recipe with these modifications, and I would use it again.

Delicious and easy!  I have made this with blackberries, blueberries, peaches and tonight I made it with fresh cherries I pitted myself.  Smells wonderful but haven't tried it yet.

Really good!  I adapted the recipe to 12 servings because I had six cups of blackberries and 3 cups of red raspberries.  I reduced the amount of sugar called for and it had the sweet/tart flavor I was hoping for.  With the full measure of sugar called for, it would still be excellent, so if you have a serious sweet tooth, go for it!  The topping is just the right proportion--more in this case is not better.  I used butter in the topping recipe and it leaves a nice buttery aftertaste.  Try this--if you're a berry lover, you cannot go wrong.

I never thought I would ever give a bad rating to a dessert that I made because I have the worst sweet tooth in the world, but this really way too sweet. IT was like eating syrup with a little bit of crumb topping and a lot of seeds.

I made this with the suggestion of adding 1/4 tsp to the berry mixture and dough mixture. I would only add it to the dough. The cinnamon isn't overbearing, too much takes away from the rest of the favors.

This is the best cobbler recipe I have ever tasted or made, and being from the south, that says it all. I didn't change one thing about the recipe, but wished I had doubled the dough recipe as others have done previously according to the reviews.

This was so quick, easy and satisfying! This is the first time I have made cobbler and I followed the recipe exactly. It's incredible. With my freshly picked berries it really came out terrific. It's REALLY sweet though; so next time I will definitely cut a bit of the sugar down. Otherwise, highly recommended with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream and a table of hungry friends!

Two days ago was my first time making any kind of pie/cobbler and this turned out AMAZING! My family loved it and requested that I make it again today - this good! I agree with other reviewers that the amount of dough should be doubled - didn't seem to be enough for the amount of berries. I only had 3 cups of fresh blackberries so ended up adding a cup of frozen raspberries and it was a bomb, also added some cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested. Excellent recipe - will be making again and again!

I'm not a baker of any sort and love this recipe!  Used for blackberries and blueberries. For the blueberries, I just tossed them with the sugar, lemon, sugar, and cornstarch without cooking and spread @ bottom of a greased 9x13. I did cut down sugar just by 1/4 cup and was still delish!

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the crust as some suggested and it was a bit too much crust, next time I will increase crust by 50%.  I can see that if you don't increase it there would not be enough of it.  This is so much easier than my traditional cobbler recipe.  I will making this again....probably  next weekend!

I find the original recipe is the exact size to fit a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish.  You will still need the foil underneath during baking.
I find the ratio of dough to juicy blackberry sauce exactly right in this original recipe.
The next time I make it, I may decrease the boiling water added to the dough by at least 1 Tbsp.

Wow!! This recipe is the Great. I doubled the amount of dough.I also added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and a few drops of vanilla extract to the dough.Next time I'll try with peaches bc the blackberries are very seedy, But if you've had blackberries..You know what you're getting into.

One of the best I've ever had.  The dough with the added vanilla was soooo good.  Like a cookie crust.  I don't see the need for an iron skillet tho.  Next time I'll just use a Pyrex dish.

Awesome!!!  This is a much better cobbler than I was making.  Loved using my old iron skillet.  We picked the blackberries out of the yard and made it right away.  This is the only cobbler recipe I will be using from now on.

Made this for the first time today with wild black raspberries picked from our fence row.  Delicious!  Added a pinch of cinnamon and about 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough.  Husband loved it!  Don't have a cast iron skillet, so boiled it in sauce pan and then baked it.  Will make this again!  Very easy.

Great recipe!  Made it with blackberries, but I plan on trying other berries such as strawberries or raspberries. The crust is so easy and it very tender and yummy!  I always add my sugar slowly, and taste as I go.  It turned out perfect!

Great, easy recipe!  I picked loganberries from the backyard and mixed those with blackberries, which added a great tart flavor so it wasn't too sweet.  The drop biscuits were tasty.  Turned out so well my uncle thought my cousin (who is a chef) made it!

Got my latest magazine recently & saw this recipe.  Found lots of ripe wild blackberries on the fence at our little country place last weekend & couldn't wait to try this.  I followed your tip about reducing the sugar & this cobbler is delicious.  I used more berries than called for, but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  It's a keeper!  I used my big cast iron skillet.  Perfect!

It's way too sweet !!!
 I also doubled the dough, added cinnamon to dough mix and up the berries to about 6-7 cups. DO IT !
Otherwise, you will end up with too little everything except pools of juice inside a 9x13 Pyrex. 
The berries gave out a lot of liquid so next time I will add more cornstarch to thicken up the juices. 
Most important of all ~ use less sugar ! I would cut out 1/2 cup. Berries are sweet already !
I also baked 10 or more minutes longer since I increased the dough... Much better when its more done and golden brown on top.

I loved this recipe! The dough translated into the most soft and butter-flavored cake-type topping that was so wonderful! I did cut back just a quarter cup on the sugar and, like everyone else, doubled the recipe. As for the berry filling, I left it as is. 
I can see using this recipe for all kinds of different fruit; can anybody imagine apple and cherry together? OMG!!!

Delicious!! We picked wild blackberries today that we spotted on a drive. 4 cups of berries -perfect, batter could have used a little more but not enough needed to double. Lemon juice (fresh) made it slightly bitter... will not use next time. Didn't use skillet just boiled berry mixture and put in a small rectangular pyrex (not 9 X 13). Will totally make this again.

This recipe was quite good. However, I would recommend doing 1.5x the dough. And of course, serve with homemade vanilla ice cream.

Perfect! I followed this recipe because it was designed for wild berries and they taste different than cultured ones. I kept the quantities as written for everything, but I DID add 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla to the dough, and 1 tsp cinnamon to the berries. The top of the dough formed a crust that was more cookie-like than cake-like, but so very tasty!

Loved the Pork Roast...5 Stars...  But the veggies left more than just a bit to be desired...MINUS 1 star...  Hubby wouldn't eat the veggies on a bet!  But again, the roast wast juicy... tender... and delicious.   I think next time I'll make the roast by itself and make other veggies separately and see how that comes out.

Omgeezy this recipe is amazing.  My bf loves blackberry cobbler (which I have never made before)... he said this is better than his dad's. Which is a HUGE compliment. 
The crust was perfect... NEXT TIME I WILL DOUBLE THE RECIPE.  I did add extra sugar. It's definitely not necessary.  I added vanilla extract and cinnamon to the crust. And cinnamon in the berry mixture.  I added a little softened buttter to the crust when it was almost finished.  Perfect recipe. Thanks sooooooo much for sharing. Don't forget the ice cream.

Fabulous recipe! U can't go wrong! I doubled the topping and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon to it before dropping it on berries. I also used 12 oz of frozen blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries each. Came our superb in the cast iron skillet. Add some extra time cooking if you double the topping. You can't go wrong with this recipe if u want to make a good cobbler. The lemon came in handy because after I juiced it I took the meat out and put it in my sink disposal to freshen it lol!

This IS good. I can't wait to try it with Fresh Raspberries. I did not double up on the dough instead I added the ingredients so that it made 1.5 times what the recipe calls for. I will go with double next time. As suggested by many, I added Vanilla to the dough. I will not do so the next time BUT I will cook it about 7 Minutes longer that suggested in this recipe. The dough that was under the fruit mixture was not quite done ecough. For me, the most important change is reducing the sugar used in the fruit mixture. Oh it's good, but it takes away from the Berries themselves. I will go to 3/4 Cup. 
Make sure you have some real cool milk. This stuff is YUMMY!

As good as it gets!  I took the advice of others and doubled the topping and used a casserole dish (boiling the mix first and pouring into my pan). I found it look twice as long to cook with the double topping.  Also it is molten lava when it comes out.  When it cooled down to room temperature it tasted its best.  I cannot say enough about how tasty this is.  One thing I may do next time is top it with some sugar before baking for just another added crunch.  It's heavenly! Enjoy.

I love how easy this dish is!  My cast iron skillet went from stove top to oven to table for serving.  And it's really good too!  I used some wild blackberries near my house along with plums and peaches.  So versatile!  And SO GOOD!

This BlackBerry Cobbler was very Good! I did add a little cinnamon and vanilla to the dough and I also doubled the dough up. Next time I will cut back on sugar because it was a little too sweet for me but my kids said it was Delicious!!!!!

My first time ever making cobbler and it turned out amazing! I only had 2 cups of blackberries so I cut the recipe in half. I followed some other reviews and instead of putting the cast iron skillet (which I don't have) into the oven, I put the bubbling blackberry mixture into a glass baking pan, spooned the topping onto that and then baked it. It tasted amazing, I wouldn't make any other changes.

Based on other reviews, I was looking for the holy grail of blackberry cobbler with this recipe. It's not that good, but I'm definitely saving it for my recipe box. 
Like the other reviewers said, cut back on the sugar (conveniently, I ran out of sugar so putting in the full amount wasn't even an option) and double the dough.
Aesthetically, especially if you're doing this in a casserole dish like me, I would also recommend putting the berries in first and the dough on top. It's much prettier that way.
Overall, yummy enough to eat for dessert and then again for breakfast!

Excellent!  Served it with vanilla ice cream, and everyone cleaned their plates!  Will definitely make again, and maybe use other fruits or a blend of fruits next time.

Great cobbler:) I only had one cup of blackberries so instead of making a smaller recipe I added two cups of strawberries. I did as others advised and only used 1 cup of sugar total (1/2 to dough and 1/2 to fruit), add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to dough, add orange zest and sprinkle cinnamon on fruit mix.

This was perfect! Followed almost exactly and boyfriend loved it. only differences was that i put a half teaspoon vanilla extract in the blueberry mixture while boiling, and added a little bit extra lemon juice. right before i put it in the oven i sprinkled sugar and nutmeg on top of the whole thing. other than that, followed exactly.

Have used this recipe several times, once used peaches instead. It worked, but not as tasty as blackberries. I just tend to only half a cup of sugar instead of a whole cup. My berries are handpicked, and I know are very ripe & tasty. It doesn't need that extra half cup. Have taken it to my Sit-n-Stitch and they loved it. It's one of my boyfriend's favorite desserts.

DELICIOUS! I was looking for a recipe to use the mulberries from my yard, and this turned out perfect! So easy too! The dough was so tasty and was a perfect compliment to the berries. Next time, I'm going to make sure to have vanilla ice cream on hand to make it ala mode. This recipe is definitely going to make it into the Favorites folder.

I watched the video and like it said to put cinnamon in the batter for the topping. Made it in a glass 8 by 8 inch casserole dish. I used more blackberry's than it called for and it turned out fine. When it calls for heating the blackberry's, part two, I used a pan and then transferred it to the dish before adding the batter to the top. Great recipe, thanks.

The flavor was really good but the topping was hard. My guest enjoyed it and ate every last bit. I scooped up vanilla ice cream on top so maybe the topping wasn't so noticeable. I will probably make it again because it was really easy and guest just think that I worked hours on a tasty dessert. I used frozen berries too. Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe with 5 cups of frozen mix of cherries and berries from Trader Joe's since that is what I had on hand.  Used 1/2 cup of sugar in frozen berries because they are always sweet and cooked on medium with lid on pan since berries were frozen.  Next time I will double the dough recipe as I like a lot of crust. It is an excellent recipe both the fruit part and crust.     When peaches are in season I will make a peach/blueberry cobbler.  Any mix of fruit used in pies would be very good.

I wanted a delicious way to use up some blackberries. This dessert was indeed delicious! My husband was skeptical at first, but insisted I purchase some more blackberries to make it again. Leftovers heat up fine and still taste great, too. I used all the sugar suggested because the blackberries were a bit tart. If you have sweeter berries, I recommend you cut down on the 1 cup sugar in the fruit mixture. Also, I baked in a smaller dish vs skillet- wouldn't recommend anything bigger than an 8x8.

Perfect. The whole family loved it. I halved the sugar and it was still nice and sweet. I've made it twice this month. It's my go-to recipe for any berries in the house that I fear might not get eaten up before they turn. After a few days if I still have 2 cups worth of berries I make this! Just made a batch of blueberry-raspberry-strawberry cobbler and it is awesome.

I love making this cobbler, and people love eating it. I mostly use blackberries, but I mix in other berries sometimes, too. No substitutions necessary. If I'm feeling crazy, I put a tiny bit less sugar.

Great easy recipe! I had some sugared frozen wild blackberries so I had to just guess at the amount of sugar to add. I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla each to filling and batter. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the filling. For the topping I sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mixture on top. I did use a cast iron skillet. I was light on the berries, used all I had, but left the batter the same. I say batter because I did not have dough, too much water, not enough flour, I don't know but it worked out.

I bake occasionally, and love blackberry recipes as they are plentiful here in the NW.  I enjoyed this recipe and doubled the pastry portion, tho I learned my lesson RE the Lemon Juice!  Makes for great teeth staining for sure.  Next time will most likely leave it out  :)

Made this last night, and followed some other reviewers suggestions and doubled the topping ingredients, and only put 1/2 cup of sugar in with the blueberries. It was fantastic!!! This will take the place of the recipe I always use. Also will use the 12" cast iron skillet. Some of that great filling boiled over in the oven. Thank you Amanda!!

The blackberry was 4 stars, the crust was 5 stars.  I doubled the crust and I still thought I wouldn't have enough though.  
For my first cobbler ever (making and tasting) I have to say I quite enjoyed it.  My very picky (and cobbler experienced) partner loved it.

This was a simple, yet fabulous dessert! One that will be a staple for desserts for years to come. I used blackberries from the woods behind my house. Going to experiment with red raspberries and blueberries.

The dough part did not turn out like in the picture : it sank and looked undercooked.  The taste was good.  Everyone liked it.   I made it using splenda because one of the guest has severe diabetes.

We loved it! I did as others suggested, adding cinnamon to the dough and berries. As well as some vanilla extract to the dough. I reduced the sugar a 1/4 cup. I also used half fresh blackberries and half red raspberries. I think the next time I make it, I may increase the dough a little and perhaps the cornstarch. Mine came out a little too watery.

Loved this! Made it with my niece and it was fun and easy to do. We put ours in a cake pan and it worked well. Only thing I changed was I added a little dash of vanilla and almond extracts (real not imitation) to the topping and it really made it pop.  I would think that making it in a cake pan, I could have even added anoter cup or two of berries (same amount of sugar) and it would have been even better.

This is excellent. I made it as listed, but I doubled the dough part. Baked it in a small pyrex dish. Delish!

This is the first cobbler I ever made and now I've started something! I didn't have a skillet to put the blackberry mixture in so I cooked it in a large sauce pan and transferred it to a buttered 8x8 glass dish and then put the crust on top.  I had to cook it a bit longer than the recipe called for but the end result is OUTSTANDING***!!!  As good as Grandma's!  :)

Perfect! Our berries were wild, and early in the season so they were very tart. I had to sprinkle a bit of extra sugar on top after baking. Yummm!

Fabulous recipe! I used fresh picked blackberries that were so juicy. I adjusted the sugar and used some brown sugar and cut out 1/4 white. Also, used a Pyrex 8*8 and it turned out sensational. I will definitely make this again.

This cobbler was fabulous, but needs to come with a warning: your teeth, mouth, and tongue will be stained dark blue/purple for several hours afterwards- even after vigorous teeth brushing.  It was shocking...also a little hilarious.

OMGosh, love this cobbler... I made a double batch and it was gone by the end of the night. :)  I took other peoples advice and added less sugar (half a cup less) and turned out amazing!  I also like mine thick so I added more cornstarch..

Perfect! I've made this many times now, but the most recent time, I had a total of 5 cups berries (3 c blueberries and 2 c strawberries). I doubled the topping even though the filling wasn't doubled - it was even better with a higher ratio of topping. You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

I've had wild blackberries in my backyard for years, and never ever picked to try in a recipe. Finally did, and OMG. These are to die die die for! I even cut back the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was still super rich. I added cinnamon to the crust, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove to the blackberry mixture and it was just divine. Thank you sooooo much for the recipe!

Fantastic!!! I did double the dough topping because I love a lot of topping more than berries and it fit in my deep dish cast iron skillet fine! I did like other reviewers and added the cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract to the dough. Also added cinnamon to the berries. Since I doubled the dough I did have to cook it longer than 25 min., it took approx. 40-45 min. for the dough to be done all the way through. This extra time gave the dough a nice crunchy top and soft center. I wasn't prepared for the berry stained teeth and tongue though! LOL! Made me laugh when I looked in the mirror! I will def. be making this again and possibly with other fruit. The dough I think you could also drop on a cookie sheet and bake, then use for strawberry shortcake...YUMMO!

This was great!  My husband and I usually have a tough time finishing desserts before they go bad, but this was completely eaten in less than 48 hours.  I used canned peaches and it came out wonderfully.  Will make again!

Simply wonderful.  The dough is fluffy and crisp.  I have never made cobbler before and it is super easy.  I did have to use frozen raspberries, but it turned out lovely.  I will use this again and again!  I made it per directions the first time, but I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the berry mixture since then and like the slight spice.

Delicious...I would recommend using more batter mix for the berries so it covers most of the dish. I also added a little cinnamon to the batter. Other than that, it's easy and delicious.

This was only my second time making a "real" cobbler.  It was fantastic!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding the suggested cinnamon and vanilla to both the crust & the filling.  I also made 1 1/2 timess the amount of crust.  My husband rated it 100!!  Thanks for a super good recipe.  This will be made many more times and I'm anxious to try with other fruits.

Great Cobbler. I made a few changes.  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to batter and berries.  I wish I would have doubled the topping (I will next time).  I boiled the berry mixture in a sauce pan than transferred it to an 8x8 glass baking dish.  Baked it uncovered 25mins.  It made the house smell so good!  Everyone loves it.  I'm considering making just the berry mixture and putting it on cream cheese and serving it with crackers.  I think it would be excellent.

I have made this twice with RAVE review both time. I used splenda mix (half sugar half splenda) and made it in a cake pan for lack of a iron skillet...still came out fantastic. One time I used the pampered chef cinnamon sprinkle, one time without....both phenomenal. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Yum! I used 2 cups of strawberries and 2 cups of blackberries. Also added 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/4 t. cinnamon to the dough and 1/4 t. cinnamon to the berries. The dough was a little spongy , I was hoping for more of a buttery crumb top, but everyone loved it!!!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars.  I replaced the cornstarch with all purpose flour since I did not have cornstarch on hand.  The flour acts as a thickener for the filling and it turned out well.  Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar used with the blackberries to 3/4 cups.  The flour topping browned nicely.

I've tried several recipes for blackberry (or other fruit) cobbler, and THIS one definitely yields the most consistent results.  It multiplies nicesly as well-- so if you're gonna fire up the oven mid-summer (when blackberries are most plentiful), make a double-batch and invite the neighbors over-- and ask THEM to bring the vanilla icecream!

My grandmother has a cobbler recipe that I just love but she is old school, a bit of this a bit of that - so mine never tastes as good as hers. So I searched here and guess what? This right here, this recipe right here... Excellent to the point it doesn't even make sense! My only modification is that I add a few dashes of cinnamon to the dough and because it is so  good, I always double it. I bake these cobblers in a white Corningware 2.5 quart baking dish and I have made this with Blackberries and Peaches. This recipe truly works with any fruit. I don't use any other cobbler recipe because there is non better. Even my Mom said she could not believe how  good this is! She thinks its the best dessert I have ever made. Thank you so much Amanda - DE-LICI-OUS!

I made this last week for my family and had to serve it as an dessert appetizer as we couldn't wait to eat it. I'm about to make another one and my mouth is watering for the sweet and tart taste. Now I know why I bought that cast iron skillet!

A favorite in our house. Cast iron skillet not available  in our house, so I just use a lined jelly roll pan and a casserole dish. Yummy!

This was delicious!   I added about a 1/2 tsp of allspice,  and about 1 tsp of vanilla extract.    Also, I used raw sugar,  which gives a little more depth to the berry mixture.  With these additions, this is a five star recipe!

Great cobbler!! I added cinnamon and vanilla like other viewers just because it sounded good. If you like less crust and more of the blackberries follow the directions, but if you like more of the crust in your blackberries, then double the dough recipe. I didn't double mine because I didn't want it to be too dry but I could have doubled it and it would have been exactly how I like it, juicy but with extra crust =) Thanks for the great recipe!!

I used this recipe and cut the sugar back a cup and used spelt flour because because my son is allergic to wheat. And it went over BIG. Incredible recipe! The best cobbler recipe I have ever used. Five star rating for me!

This is the best cobbler ever!!!  This was very, very, very easy to make!!  This was my first cobbler that I baked and was surprised about how easy and delicious it was!!!  This will now be a recipe I use all of the time.  Also, doubling the crust recipe is a must because it is so yummy!!!

Ohhhh, this was goooood.  The cobbler part is not dry at all, and sweetened just perfectly.  The only downside is that blackberries tend to turn your whole mouth funny colors...good for a laugh with your family, but not so impressive for a date!  Thanks for the recipe!!

So good! Hands down the best cobbler I've ever had... I had slightly sweet blackberries so I reduced the sugar by 1/2.  ** It could be 6 stars with a little vanilla and cinnamon added "to taste" to the dough and/or fruit mixture.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and it is always a hit. I have made it with the cast iron skillet and without. You can really do it either way to get the same effect. I always add a dash of vanilla to the crust mixture which gives it a little more flavor.

Fabulous! I didn't have 4 cups worth of blackberries, so I only used 2 cups and halved the mixture. I used a small pyrex dish since I don't have a cast iron skillet and it still came out great! Will definitely make again and probably experiment with different kinds of fruit too.

Great! I would maybe double the topping part if that's what you like. I used frozen berries and a 13x9 glass pan instead and turned out just fine. Add cinnamon and vanilla to the topping mix if you like. Could always decrease the sugar or use Splenda if concerned with so much sugar intake. I'll be making this one again!

This recipe is so easy to make and is delcious.  I love the cobbler on top so I double the dough recipe so I get a ton of coverage.  I also use the half sugar/half Splenda mix and it turns out great.

Yummm! I mistakenly added ALL the sugar to the dough mixture and had to double the recipe in order to make it right, but even with extra sugar and some lard (I ran out of butter) the cobbler still turned out great.  Definitely would reduce the sugar in berry mix by 1/4 c like another reviewer said.  Will make again!

This is a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe.  The dough part was the perfect texture, flavor, and sweetness.  The berry mixture on the other hand was way to sweet.  I wish I'd listened to another poster and start w/ half the amount of sugar and add if necessary.  It really was way to sweet.  It did receive rave reviews at the 4th of July party though.  I used last year's blackberries from my bush that I'd froze.  When I do make this again I will cut the sugar in half for the berry mixture (if making it for home I'll do splenda) and go from there.  Definetely leave the amount of sugar in the dough.  I also added cinnamon to both the berry & dough mixture along with nutmeg & vanilla extract to the dough.   I don't own a cast-iron skillet so I transferred a very hot berry mixture (I didn't even bring it to a boil) to a pyrex dish.

You know, I thought at first that there wouldn't be enough dough, but it turned out to be a great crust-berry ratio. I reduced the sugar a little, for both the berries and the dough, maybe by a 1/4 cup total. I thought the result was still plenty sweet with just a hint of tartness from the berries. I don't have a cast-iron skillet either, just poured the cooked berries into a ceramic pie dish and then added the batter--I think next time I do this I'll use a cake pan with a similar diameter instead in hopes that the greater depth will prevent the spill-over (she wasn't kidding with the foil-lined baking tray). Overall, really easy to put together and great crust.

This was pretty good.  I used frozen blackberries and used a little more than it called for.  I baked it in a 8x8 pyrex dish also since I don't have a cast iron skillet.  It turned out a little runny but that might have been because the blackberries were frozen.  If I make again, I will add more cornstarch to it.

Wonderful recipe!  Turned out perfectly. I did not use the cast iron pan (ours isn't big enough).  I baked in an 8 x 8 pyrex dish in the oven.  I had just the right amount of dough.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and some fresh blackberries to garnish.  Yum!

My family really enjoyed this cobbler!  I did double the topping because we like our cobbler with lots of crust, otherwise I did not change anything.  The recipe is perfect as is!  This recipe will be made fairly often since it's easy to make and delicious.

We loved this recipe.  I took others' advice and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup & added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the dough and fruit.  I also sprinked cinnamon to both.  I used a 9" iron skillet and it was the perfect size.  I used frozen blackberries, can't wait for summer for fresh berries.

Very yummy with the changes other suggested;  One-half the sugar in the berries and 1.5 times the topping.  Comfort food at its best.

I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen blackberries and followed another reviewer's idea of putting some vanilla in the dough and cinnamon in the berries.  I followed everything else to a "T"...it was soooo delicious!  I've only made it once, and I'm already giving the recipe away to those who enjoyed it!

I just finished up making this for our New Year's Day celebration tomorrow.  This recipe was easy to follow, and the smell that came from my oven was amazing!!!  I grabbed a tiny little bite to taste and it is GREAT.  The recipe as written originally is awesome, and the only change I made was to add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract to the berry mixture.  I am sure I will be making this again and again...so easy and such a nice dessert to put out for guests with a little vanilla ice cream!

Wow! This is such an excellent and simple recipe. I used fresh blackberries and blueberries... I should have read the reviews before making it but I was so excited to get started... next time I will 1.5 the biscuit topping. I may reduce the sugar in the fruit mixture as well. But overall, this was fantastic. I love using my cast iron! My first time making cobbler too.

I love this recipe. I don't use cast iron, I put it in a baking dish. I use frozen berries from last season, I just let them thaw. It is splendid. I did make it with fresh berries and it was wonderful.

There aren't too many things that I can whip together that are so satisfying to the family. This is one that I treasure.

Great recipe!  I added a little lemon zest to the dough and the filling, just to give it a kick!  

I also boiled everything and then put it in a baking dish like a few of the others did.  Turned out beauitful!

It's a great idea to "taste test" your berries before you figure out how much sugar to add; some of my berries required all the sugar and some were sweeter.  I made this several times. You DO need the foil-lined cookie sheet.  I used an 8" cast iron pan and it worked far better than a Pyrex dish or other glass dish; it cooked more evenly in the cast iron pan. It's a great presentation for company, serving it in the pan, too!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!

Very yummy!  I didn't have granulated sugar, so I used brown sugar and it turned out great - I also added a pinch of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and a splash of vanilla to the dough.  I will make again (and I'll try white sugar)!

There were 4 of us and I asked them how to rate this cobbler - they all said 5 stars!
I used fresh blackberries and after reading many reviews, made half again on the topping and added a bit of cinnamon and cut down on the sugar. No cast iron skillet so used a 9 x 13 pan (could have used 5 cups of berries instead of 4) boy was this good! definately a keeper.

This cobbler is really good, I've made it twice in 2 weeks!  I made the recipe as called for, except with slightly less sugar in the berries, and the second time I made more crust. I also used strawberries both times.  Truly delicious!

Yummy!  I had a big bag of frozen raspberries from last year in my freezer, so I used those instead of blackberries.  I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I actually brought the mixture to a boil on the stove top in a 9x9 metal baking dish and then put the dish on a cookie sheet and into the oven.  Worked worderfully.  This is my new recipe for all my fruit cobblers.  Thanks!

Really yummy recipe. I used grenadine and substituted a spoon or two of strawberry preserves for 1/2 cup of sugar in the berries. I also added 1/2 tsp of almond essence to the fruit and a dash of nutmeg in the topping. Definitely make extra topping...I doubled the topping recipe and used all but a few spoonfuls.

Very good but next time I would reduce the amouont of sugar.  Alittle too sweet.  But still very good.

I was impressed. The great reviews were right on. I substituted blueberries for blackberries. As others suggessted, I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to both the batter and the berries, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I had no problems using a baking dish instead of a skillet. Delish!

I made this with blueberries and it was to die for!  I took others advice and made 1 1/2 times the dough and added cinnamon.  It was a hit.

I've made this several times for my friends and boyfriend - and everyone loves it! I usually use fresh blackberries, strawberries and raspberries. For the crust, I usually double the recipe and add a pinch of nutmeg.

Yummo!! After a very large brasciole and meatball dinner, I needed something light to finish it off. This cobbler was perfect.  It tasted light and, having reduced the sugar as recommended by other reviewers, was just the right sweetness.  Baked them in two separate oven-safe dishes.

Easily the best blackberry cobbler I've ever had. Added more lemon to the fruit as well as some cinnamon. Next time I make it though I would double the topping. It was delicious!

I used the base of this recipe with a bag of frozen raspberries and a can of drained peaches mixed together.  The tickening was perfect, and topping was tastey, but not big and fluffy like I like it so I'm still looking.

Delicious! I substituted the blackberries with marionberries and it turned out nicely but I wish I would have used more than 5 cups of berries to match the doubled crust recipe. Very easy, I would make again!

Got rave reviews for this super simple and delicious cobbler. Bread part is definitely not soggy when cooked in cast iron skillet.  Also added about 1 tsp. cinnamon to the topping.

It was good, but not enough dough.  It doesn't spead, it just kinda stays the way it is when you drop it raw in the fruit.  So definitely double the dough, because that is the best part!

pretty tasty recipe...much different from the cobblers I grew up eating though.  I doubled the batter, which made it a little too bready.  and I only had 2 cups of blackberries so I added a can of peaches, which did make a nice flavor combo.  will probably make again, and try different fruit blends.

Ohhh, I just made this tonight and it was amazing.  It's terrifically sweet, though--my teeth almost ached by the end--so I may try it next time with a bit less sugar in the berries.  But wow, great homemade flavor.  This is a wonderful recipe.

My kids picked fresh blackberries from the back yeard and then made this recipe. It was really good. Although we all agreed we would like more of the bread part and we would double that. What the kids did instead since we did not have a pot that could be put in the oven I had her boil the sauce on teh stovetop and then pour it in the pan and put the bread part on that. It looked completely different than the photo here but it was delicious. The bread part reminded me of shortbread.

I put less sugar as suggested..but it was a bit sour. I didnt double the dough but "1.5'd it"." I baked it in 400 degree oven for 25 minutes..and the dough still tasted .."doughey" and uncooked, so i cooked it for ten more minutes..but it still tastes doughey. any suggestions?
otherwise! it was my first time making a cobbler and was very scared of how it would turn out--but i just need to make a few little changes and itll be PERFECT.

Delicious and extremely easy to make. I used a mixture of 2 boxes of fresh blueberries and 1 bag of frozen blackberries and the combo was great! A nice sweet and tart dessert.

Ok, I actually think it should be a 4 and 1/2 because it is really sweet, but my husband protests saying it is perfect- I guess it depends on your sweet tolerance! Otherwise, very good!

I would rate this higher but my blackberries were too seedy.  I don't know if that's normal, I usually make a mixed berry cobbler but the cobbler was good and the recipe was easy.  My husband loved it seeds and all!  maybe the fact my son picked these somewhere around the neighborhood had something to do with the seeds.  I'll try again with fresh berries from a farmers market!

Very easy to make. Thought the sugar amount was just right. The presentation in the cast iron skillet was a great idea!
