Thanks.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of the balsamic due to the high lead content I do not want to give to my family.  To avoid the thin slices of the fillets being overly flavored in soy, I stuck the thinner slices up on the sides of the bowl I used while the thicker sides were in the marinade.  Later on I took the thinner sides off from the sides of the bowl and added it to the juice to soak for a few minutes.  Thanks.

Very easy to make! Nice and quick bake time! Only problem I had was the filets, one side was thinner than the other. The thin portion sucked up plenty of marinade, but the thick portion only had a mild flavoring! Still great, wish I had more!!

We thought this was excellent, just the right amount of flavor. I doubled the marinade and used 6 tilapia fillets. I put the fish in the baking dish I was going to use to bake them in, poured the marinade on top and put them in the fridge, in about 30 minutes I rotated and marinated for another 30 minutes. Excellent with wild rice and brussel sprouts!

AMAZING!!!! This is probably the best fish I've ever had. Before marinading, I poked holes on both side of fish to ensure the marinade would soak into the fish. I sprinkled it with a tiny bit of kosher salt before I baked it - the salty/sweet combo was delicious. Will definitely be making this often!

Just so easy and flavorful!!  I used rice wine vinegar instead of balsamic but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Marinated about 6 hrs. in the fridges and the flavors blended together so well... What a wonderful light, easy way to enjoy fish!

I marinated this overnight rather than just for 30 minutes. It was an explosion of flavor in our mouths. And it must've smelled darn good, because my 1 year old who has become quite the picky eater FREAKED out until I gave her some of mine... which quilkly turned into half of it. My husband also is a HUGE fan. This will definitely be added onto our "must haves"!!

This was a very easy and inexpensive recipe.  I used sugar free honey (diabetic husband) and it turned out perfect!  I reserved some of the marinade before I added the fish and used it to dip the cooked fish, very good!

This was very good, with a nice little amount of sweet from the honey.  I would recommend marinating longer than 30 minutes though.  It was very subtle with the shorter time.

I baked this for my mother last night. Very easy, but somehow we felt the marinade didn't compliment the cod we used. We both agreed this would be an excellent marinade for chicken, so I'm giving it 3 stars and calling it a keeper. Thanks for sharing it!

I really enjoyed this simple and flavorful recipe.  The only change I made was to use 1 tbsp balsamic and 2 tbsp red wine vinegar (because I had some homemade red wine vinegar I wanted to try) and I marinated for about 30-40 minutes.  Delicious!  Will definitely be making again.

This sounds good and looked easy to prepare.  I suggest marinading it longer then 30 minutes to get the flavor to stick.

This was very tasty! I only had apple cider vinegar on hand,light soy sauce, and very little honey. I found that it needed some "tweeking" as I didn't have the right balance of sweet & savory,so I added app. 1&1/2 T of brown sugar which helped and a couple of drops of Hot sauce, to "kick it up a bit!".It was tasty over some Angel Hair, tossed with a half a bag of store-brand Stir-fry veggies. My kids loved it, I loved it & I am 4 sure gonna make it again,and again, and again..!Thank you very much for the recipe!

Wifey, Kids, and I really enjoyed it! A good alternative to the soy sauce is to use the low sodium soy sauce.

5 stars. No explanation needed. 

10 stars if you use a ginger/wasabi finishing sauce.

This was delicious! I let the fish marinade in the fridge for one hour - turning the fish after 30 minutes.  Then I cooked the fish in the same marinade pan.  A huge hit with the entire family - even my 5 year old.

Very easy to prepare. I agree with the people who suggest saving the marinade and heating it to use as a sauce. The added flavor boost from adding the sauce is worth it.  I also recommend using low sodium soy sauce as I can see this being a little too salty otherwise.

It was very simple but I did marinate it over night. I loved it and I will definitely make this a regular meal in my house!

This was a really great recipe. Neither my husband or I are crazy about fish but we eat it for the health benefits. We always have to find sauces/marinades that mask the fishiness. This marinade did the trick. I used some fancy fig flavored balsamic, and the combination of flavors was really really good.

Delicious! I always tend to make my fish too salty. I've never found a good taste to cooking fish before, but after trying this recipe I am in LOVE! As soon as I mixed the sauces together I could tell this was going to be awesome. Thanks so much for this recipe. I love it :)

Wow, this was a great marinade.  We used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic and heated the marinade slightly to better incorporate the honey, then let it marinate for about 90 minutes, with the thin side of the filet propped up out of the marinade, turning the fish once.  Spooned a couple spoonfuls of the marinade over the fish before putting in the oven.  Forgot to add the pepper before baking, so just sprinkled it on when it came out of the oven.  We could really taste the honey (which we love and used a strong flavored honey) and all the flavors went together extremely well.

I dont normally post on these things but this was amazing!  The only thing I did differently was to add 1 more teaspoon of everything and crush a clove of garlic instead of minced since we dont like garlic that much.  I will be having this again!  Thanks for this recipe!

Based on some of the other reviews, I used apple cider vinegar instead because I didn't have balsamic. It turned out great! Husband was a fan :)

This dish lacked flavor.  The best thing about this recipe is made it with only two pieces of tilapia and there weren't any leftover. The fish was very soft and it needed a lot of spices. I alway make the recipe as its called for first. I don't think I'd be making this again. My hubby usually likes everything I make, but this one wasn't a winner.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I changed was instead of throwing all that marinade away, I baked the fish in it.  Then I used it as a sauce when I plate the fish.  And yes, it still bakes in the 25 to 30 minutes as the recipe states.

Good flavor, however I find (and found again with this recipe) that  350°  for 20 minutes is insufficient. Particularly with tilapia that is marinated. Other than having to make some temp and duration adjustments, the tilapia came out just fine.

I was skeptical about marinating tilapia in honey, but I was wrong! This was great! I used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic, added Sriracha, and marinated it in the baking dish instead of a bowl to get a nice even marinade. I followed all other directions and it was awesome! Even Husband who claims to not like tilapia ate it all and then asked that I make more for him to take for lunch the next day.

Made according to recipe and marinaded for about 6 hours. The marinade itself was pretty good and would probably be great on chicken or even pork chops, but we really didn't care for it on tilapia.  I may make the marinade again but it won't go on fish.

I make it just like the recipe but add more fish since there is enough marinade. Taste is amazing and has a very light sweetness that is wonderful with this fish.

This was the best thing I made this week. I followed it exactly too. I heated up some kale and quinoa that I got from Costco freezer section. And the next day ate it cold, mixed together, and it was even better.

Honey Soy Tilapia Haiku: "I was quite surprised. Took a boring, mild fish, gave it lots of jazz!" I don't have tilapia around very often as it's just a "yawn" kind of fish, but I had some frozen, and instead of the usual parmesan/bread-crumb bake technique, I went w/ this marinade recipe, and I'm glad that I did, although I was leery at first at that much balsamic vinegar. Marinated mine for about 4.5 hrs. and the baking instructions were right on; served w/ rice and some mixed veggies, and we were very pleased! I think it'd be an equally tasty marinade on chicken too.

I loved it. I did add a few changes. Instead of 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar I put 1 tablespoon and 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar and added a little orange juice. Instead of using the oven I put it on the stove with some oil than poured the  leftover sauce to cook with the fish as well and added cornstarch to thicken it.

I used frozen tilapia and marinated about 45 minutes.  Filets were fairly thin and I worried about over-marinating, but it was delicious.  The marinade was light and fresh, with a great balance of flavor and a hint of sweet.  I did put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes.  That was a good decision as we like a broiled finish for browning and a bit of crunch.

I think the sauces and seasonings are way too strong for such a light fish. Also the cooking time is too long.

This was pretty nice. I made it exactly as written, except my tilapia filets were a little larger (slightly over 4 oz. each). Since I like strong flavors, I marinated the fish for an hour and 20 minutes. When I discarded the marinade, I chose to keep some of the minced garlic (maybe half) on top of the fish. I wound up baking the fish for the full 20 minutes. I can't say that my palate was sophisticated enough to appreciate all the flavors here (like the balsamic vinegar), but at least I enjoyed the overall taste!

As a college student who loves very flavorful foods, but rarely has time to cook a lot, this fit my needs perfectly. I think when I make this recipe again in the future, I will let it marinade longer, maybe a full hour, since I love the flavor, but wish it was a little stronger.

This was absolutely the best Tilapia I ever had! I only used 1Tbs of balsamic vinegar because I'm not a huge fan of it and added 2Tbs is sesame oil. Easy to make!

I really liked this.  Tilapia is not my favorite and I have been looking for a marinade/seasoning to give it some "Humph" and this is it.  This is definitely a keeper.  The recipe calls for two fillets but I increased the servings to 5 fillets but used the amount of marinade given in the recipe and my staple seasonings instead of pepper ( garlic salt and adobo).  It was great.

Our big box store sells Talapia LOINS.  They are large and flakey (not flat and thin).  These were delicious with this recipe.  Everyone in the family loved this and even ate left overs - usually they go to me for lunch!  I used a balsamic "glaze" as that was all I had and just cut down a bit.  I doubled the marinade (cut down a little on the honey though) and boiled the left over marinate to drizzle over the fish and white rice I served it with.  Sautéed zucchini and aspargras made an excellent and easy meal.

I thought it was pretty good. I did keep the marinade and cook it in a sauce pan, adding some corn starch to thicken it up and use as a sauce for the fish and rice we ate it with.

I spooned about 3tb of liquid over the fish before baking, otherwise no changes needed.

My family did not love this recipe.  We love the garlic alfredo tilapia, but I had been making it very regularly and wanted to try something new.  I didn't marinade for very long at all, and still the soy flavor was overpowering and not to our liking.

This was excellent, made it exactly as written and everyone including the three year old loved it.  Definitely will make again.

We enjoyed this last night for dinner. Easy and very tasteful, with little clean up afterwards. Served with red skinned mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty.  I marinated about 8 hrs. I did pierce the fish before marinating and when I was ready to cook it I sprinkled with pepper and Kosher Salt per suggestion.  Served with sweet potatoes and Annie's Fruit Salsa and chips also found on allrecipes.  My husband and I really liked this fish, kids not so much but then again they are very picky eaters so they'll have to get used to it because it will be going into my food rotation.

Not a big fan.  The marinade seemed to be a thick teryaki that didn't really mesh with the fist.  I would try it again with better, not frozen, tilapia with a stir fry dish or something like that.  It is slightly sweet and might be a good way to get kids to eat fish.

Very easy, very tasty. My family loved it, and they're not easy to please. I serve them tilapia all of the time, so this recipe helps to break the monotony.

This has become a staple recipe in our house! I do like to add a little more pepper than called for to add an extra kick. Great with rice and stir fried spicy green beans!
