I am a very experienced cook and most people love my cookiing. The point I am trying to make is that over the years I have learned what goes well together. I have tweeked this receipe and here goes..instead of 1 cup of mayo I used 1 cup of sour cream..and also added 1 can of rotel tomatoe and chilis mix(drained well with about a 1/4 cup extra parm. cheese...Yum ! also I omitted the chilis since the rotel has them in there..

Just mayonnaise made this recipe too oily.  An 8 ounce package of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of mayonnaise instead of all mayonnaise would a big impovement!

I made this dip and it came out really greasy.  Since I definitely tasted the potential, I made it again and added an extra can of artichokes and cut the mayo down to 3/4 a cup.  VOILA!  Perfect and my guests ate it all up, begging for the recipe.  I also served it with Carrs Watercrackers and Keebler Butter Crackers.  Tasted better than the tortilla chips.

I was searching for an old artichoke dip recipe I used to have and thought this was it. It wasn't. The dip was pretty bland and I agree that too much mayo made it greasy. Will continue my search but think this recipe should have cream cheese and less mayonnaise.

This recipe was fabulous!  I took it to a party, and it was gone in minutes.  Next time I'll have to triple it to make enough.  Lots of people asked me for the recipe.

A friend of mine introduced me to a recipe similar to this, except that she also adds drained chopped pimentos. It is delicious! Though, don't try to reduce the fat by using light mayo or cheese, it only made it slimy and gritty.

I made this at Thanksgiving with the sour cream substitute.  Don't do it. Use the mayo for the flavor.

I love this because I'm lazy and it's easy.  I serve it almost every time I entertain because people love it.  I usually offer flavored dippers like Cracked Black Pepper Triscuits or garlic pita chips for those who want more flavor.

I have made this recipe for years (minus the green chiles).  The key is to use Hellman's mayo ONLY and make sure you use well-drained and chopped artichole hearts in brine (not marinated).  When done in this fashion, this is always the first appetizer to go.  Much better warm- I prepare in a quiche dish serve on a warming tray with triscuits.

I have a recipie just like this . I took a basic and made it my own. All of the following ingredients are in the one I make but I add to this 2 cloves of garlic (chopped), add a dash of salt and pepper and believe it or not a dash of ittalian seasoning. Sometimes  it does end up a little  greasy so instead of 1 cup mayo, I replace a 1/2 cup of sour cream. Anytime I make artichoke dip, it is gone and I am always asked to bring it. I always bake it till golden brown and bubbly. :)

yummm! i doubled the recipe and used half Mediterranean cheese/yogurt and half light mayo.  I bought a big round sour dough loaf and hollowed it out and put the warm dip inside.  I bought a second loaf to use for dipping.  I took it to a potluck and it was gone in about 10 minutes!!! This was fast, easy and yummy!!!

This is a good base recipe, but it defiantly needs some work. I agree about using the cream chz instead of the mayo. I did add a few tbsp of mayo to thin it out though.  Also, I added crab meat (just my prefereence, you could use shrimp or just spinish). And try this to spice it up: 1.5 tsp of red pepper, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp sugar. Mix it in there really well (I used a electric hand mixer. It makes the consistency easier for dipping).  Came out delicious! Even my 3 year olds loved it!

I should mention that if you plan on making this for a party, make more than you would normally expect.  This thing is addictive and as soon as it arrived at my host's house, all the other appetizers took a backseat.

This has a very nice flavor but it's SO greasy. There was standing grease in the bottom of the pan after a scoop was dipped. I took it to a party and ended up taking it off the table. I didn't catch the modifications until after I had everything mixed. Because the flavor is good I might try it again using the suggested modifications. I added salsa to the scoop I tried and that made it much better.

For some reason, I always seem to have the ingredients for this on hand.  I simply cannot bring myself to put a whole cup of mayo into this, so I always do 1/2 mayo and 1/2 non-fat plain Greek yogurt.  The Greek yogurt makes this really pop...that tang adds a lot! I finely dice 2 green onions to put in here and add just a pinch of salt and about a quarter teaspoon of Grains of Paradise (I use this in the place of pepper).  The green chili is something I wasn't expecting to find in this dip, but MAN, it's good!

I have been making a version of this recipe for years, and it's always a hit. I use the entire can of Kraft Parmesan cheese, and I have yet to try it with the chilis. I'll try them at our next party.

The dip was alright... make sure you serve it right out of the oven. I used a food processor to mix the ingredients together and It worked great.

Really good! I serve with tortilla chips when I have people over, or even when I'm just craving something creamy!

I use this recipe and like it but wanted to spice it up a bit. I double it and use 1 can of diced green chiles and 1 can of diced jalapeño chiles,  both well drained and I reduce the mayo slightly. I believe it's the cheese that makes it greasy because it was really greasy when I used Asiago instead of parmesan. I often will blot the top with a paper towel as soon as I remove it from the oven. People love this dip and the bowl is always emptied.

This is DELISH!  I've made it several times as written but this time I doubled the recipe and used 1 and 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 cup cream cheese. I used chopped jalapeños instead of the chillies and served with rosemary and olive oil Triskets!  AWESOME!

The two bites my mom left me, were great! Same with second batch!  Third one, I’m splitting first, after it’s done! I also forgot the chilies, but had some Pace...I measured four ounces, left a little juice, but spoon slotted drained...it was perfect...and it added a red tint! Remember for Holidays or next Chiefs Super Bowl LiV! A nice variation to it, plus was glad no sour cream, as I’d forgotten that too! Note, I also baked it an extra 20 minutes or so...browning more of the top...was even better, as the melting of the grated Parmesan merged more! Giving it a 5*!

I read the reviews and reduced the mayonnaise to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup sour cream but there was still a lot of grease on top when I took it out of the oven. Once everyone started dipping in I stirred it up which helped. I also added a chopped garlic clove. It was delicious and everyone loved it but maybe next time I will try using Hellman's mayonnaise.

I made this recipe but, I added a little twist.  I included 1 sweet bell pepper (yellow), finely chopped, and, 1/4 cup of whipped cream cheese, for an extra creaminess.  It turned out amazingly good.  No, not just amazingly good but FANTASTIC!!!  I highly recommend trying it for yourself.  Anyway, Thank you... 

Best, 
Chef4Her

I love this recipe and it’s always a big hit!  Even my husband likes it, and he does NOT like vegetables .   

I’ve come up with some modifications... I use frozen artichokes,  which makes it much less salty .  I microwave them until they’re tender and then purée them in the blender, which releases their flavor.  I also decrease the green chiles by half. 

 It’s a great recipe and I’m so glad I found it!
