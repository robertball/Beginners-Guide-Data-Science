Taste as you salt, it was too salty for me.  Great presentation.  if you're not a green olive fan try capers but remember they are salty too.

This egg salad was delicious - I added a little more dijon mustard to spice it up a bit.  Delicious!

Great idea, I adjusted recipe to make 2 servings, and used low fat miracle whip instead of mayo. Put everything except the olives and dill in a small blender, and scooped it out on the endive leaves then  sprinkled with olives and dill.  Served with whole wheat toast, made an ideal low fat, high fiber and protein lunch for 2. Thanks ^^

I like the presentation idea, but there are not many leaves on baby endive and it makes this a little costly. The taste was okay, but the endive was a little prickly/bitter.  I used my regular egg salad recipe.

Different idea for an appetizer, but too salty for me, and endive has a bit of a bitter taste

Solid idea. My husband throw random ingredients at me to see how I handle them and this week it was a baby endive. Made a pretty lunch! We adjusted the egg salad recipe to taste.

The egg salad was good, but I didn't care for the bitter flavor of the endive with it.
