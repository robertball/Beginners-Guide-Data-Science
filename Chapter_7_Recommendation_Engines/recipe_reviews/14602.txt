I substitute cubed pieces of steak instead of hamburger meat and I add a few more potatoes. The smell will make your house smell like grandmother's! Makes a bunch too. Thanks Pam!

13 years later I want to revise my review. I found that adding cubed pieces of steak to ground beef was better than only using cubed pieces of steak if you like meatier vegetable soup, like I do.  This recipe is still a winner around our house.

I used a package of country style frozen vegetables instead of the canned to reduce the amount of sodium, excellent recipe.

This is the 1st recipe I've found worthy enough of a review! Excellent, easy and VERY satisfying. As with most soups, it's better the next day so make in advance. The only thing I added was a couple of dashes of hot sauce to my bowl (personal preference). Makes alot, even scaled down, so invite a crowd. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

Given the ease of this recipe, this is delicious! I never expected so much flavor from so few ingredients. First, I substituted Johnsonville Italian Sausage for the ground beef. I took the casings off the sausage, crumbled and browned it, adding in the onion in the last few minutes. I then drained the fat.  I don't normally eat canned veggies, but I decided to give this recipe a shot anyway. I used Veg-All canned veggies. For the canned diced tomatoes I used half plain tomatoes and half onion-garlic seasoned tomatoes.  It didn't seem like there would be enough liquid at first, but the more the soup cooked down and simmered, the more liquid there was. I held off seasoning the soup til the very end because I thought the sausage and canned veggies would provide some saltiness. I only had to add a bit more salt and pepper at the end. I simmered the soup for just over 3 hours. I thought about having a bowl after only an hour, but the flavors really developed with an additional 2 hours.  This makes a lot of soup. I cut the recipe in half and still had plenty.

This is a great recipe.  It was quick, cheap, and easy.  I did add some potatoes that I had on hand but it would of been fine without the potatoes. Perfect recipe for a busy mom.

I make this soup almost weekly and my family loves it!  I've tried a lot more complicated beef vegetable soup recipes, but this one is the clear winner!  I change nothing about the recipe except that I cook mine in the crock pot on low for 6-8 hours.  I always use Veg-All for my vegetables, but I'm sure it doesn't matter. Also, this is only 3 WW pointsplus per serving, so it's perfect if you are dieting! A serving is about a cup.

I use this recipe often with many variations. I like to add parsnip, carrots and coarse ground pepper I add peas in the last 5min. The flavor is never the same twice which is nice to have variety!

I made this in a crock pot and it turned out pretty good for my 1st time ever making vegetable beef soup. My hubby loved it too. We added potatoe cubes and extra onion pieces plus a lil extra salt and pepper. We cooked it a little longer than 3 hrs too.  Close to 4 hours. It made a ton haha. We will be eating leftovers for a few days haha. It really was great!!

My veggies were fresh, and some leftovers. I used a piece of chuck roast because that is what I had. I cut the recipe in half and still have plenty to freeze.  Other than the changes mentioned above I followed the recipe as written. The flavor is spot on. The perfect blend of beef flavor and the tomato veggie flavor.
  The ease of this recipe is great, and the fact you can use what you have on hand veggie wise, make this a keeper in my recipe box.

I really think it probably should have had some beef bouillon and water to counter the strong tomato flavor (that's all I could taste).  Followed the recipe exactly and it was bland, bland!  I kept adding salt and pepper but it always needed more.  UGH!

We enjoyed this! I added some garlic, a couple of bay leaves, and some beef broth to thin it toward the end because it was thick. But good! Nobody knew all I did was open a few cans and dump them in, juice and all.

I used this recipe as way to use up ingredients in my kitchen. I had some green onions and red bell pepper to use up. I also used frozen vegetables as many others have. I used beef broth as the liquid. I seasoned liberally with a variety of spices - particularly because I did not have onion at home tonight. I also did not have stewed tomatoes so used diced tomatoes with green chilies - 4 cans.

I loved this recipe! Super easy and flavorful. I didn't have canned veggies on hand, so I used frozen mixed veggies. Also had to sub whole tomatoes for diced. And I used beef bouillon cubes and water since I had less liquid from the frozen veggies. I'll be making this again!

I think this is a really good basic recipe. I like it a lot and will definitely be making it again. The only change I really made was using frozen veggies instead of canned and I also added some water and a couple bouillon cubes. Needs a little more flavor but overall it is good.

Excellent soup!  I had to add some white vinegar to cut the taste of the tomatoes which overpowered the recipe a bit, but I think if I had cooked it for the three hours I wouldn't have had a problem.  I served this at a community lunch program and it was a hit!

I made 1/4 the amount of this recipe for lunch today and it was great, way better than I expected for such basic ingredients.  I used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned and added a quarter cup of water to moisten them, but otherwise did everything as written.  I even used the onion (chopped fine), which I normally don't care for but thought might be important in this recipe.  This recipe is easy and affordable and I felt like the ratio of meat to tomato to mixed veggies was perfect.  I seasoned well with salt and pepper.  I feel this has more of a stew or chili-like consistency than a soup because there was not too much of a broth, but I was happy with it that way.

I make this soup about once a month and the family loves it!  I just add a few dashes of hot sauce and a small amount of chili powder!  Very tasty and economical!
