Dear Lord this is good stuff! It is ridiculously easy to put together and I used homemade (gluten free) pasta. The method is right on down to the minute. Thank you for the recipe.

New family favorite! They all loved and devoured it. Only change was 2 CANS chilli not 2 CUPS. Perfect ratio.

My guys love it.  The first time they asked to have more noodles - so I overlapped quite a bit and also used half regular Velveeta and half Velveeta Queso Blanco in the cheese mixture.  That made it really terrific.  Highly recommend the recipe!

Not pretty at all, but it does taste good! I would probably not make it the lasagna way again. Since we don't use chili with beans, the cheese sauce is just too thin to layer. It is basically just chili cheese dip with pasta. Which is how I would make it next time (using different pasta, of course). Not a total failure, I guess! Just a lot of work for such a disappointing outcome.

I found that one log of velveeta wasnt enough, so I made with two which was too much. definately took two cans of chili. one can of spicy rotel is enough.  I added 1 lb. of ground meat, drained. Next time, I will buy Velveeta, not Walmart brand. Great Flavor. Easy to put together. I should mention I added two sauteed sweet onions. Yummy

WOW! I have never left a review before. In 5 years this is the first recipe that has ever moved me to do so. This will melt in your mouth, we actually ate this 6 times in one month! I made a few changes, I sauteed 1 lb ground beef and one large onion prior to adding 2 cans chili with beans. I also added about 6 slices American cheese to melting Velveeta and topped with crushed cheese crackers and shredded cheese.
