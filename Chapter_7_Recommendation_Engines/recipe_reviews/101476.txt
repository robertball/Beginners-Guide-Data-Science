Actually, this is the way I prefer to prepare my hamburgers. Lawry's seasonings rock. And for my own personal taste, you can leave out all the other stuff people try and add to it in an attempt to turn it into something it's not. If I'm going to make a burger, it's because I want to taste the beef. Put whatever you want on top of it, but underneath all of that, I want to taste the beef. And please don't use ground sirloin. Fat is your friend in a burger! That's what makes them juicy and flavorful. Anyway, enjoy. And don't forget to add the Lawry's!

I really loved the simplicity of this recipe.  The hamburger flavor was outstanding...what more could you ask for?  As they say, less is sometimes more!

Mmmmm! My mom always made our hamburgers like this growing up!! We never used the seasoned pepper from them, though. I also recommend using Lawry's seasoned salt on fried chicken and poached eggs.

We have been using Lawry's on our burgers for years. These are delicious! Nothing like a good home cooked burger out on the grill. Thanks!

These were pretty good, though I did have to make some additions. Added 1/2 a pkg dry onion soup mix, a little BBQ sauce, an egg, and some cracker crumbs. Very tasty :)

I really liked the taste and simplicity of this burger but it wasn't to die for. Make sure you don't use meat that is too lean, the fat makes your burger juicy and tasty.

Sometimes simple is the best. This is how we do all of our meats usually from hamburgers on the grill to beef tenderloin.

This is definately one of my favorite ways to make hamburgers.  It really brings out the flavor of the meat.
