I made this recipe today for the first time and it was a huge hit.  I used 3 cans of Bush Country Style beans drained and 3 T. apple cider vinegar, 3 T. chili powder, 7 T. Worcestershire sauce, 9 pork sausage links, 3 t. garlic, one large onion, 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c ketchup.  I didn't use any bell pepper, salt or cayenne pepper.  I will make this dish again and again.

This recipe has been a fail-safe one for baked beans with a little kick at all my BBQs!  I put it in the crockpot on low for 4 hours instead of baking it in the oven, but the end result is always a fiery good one!

I made this recipe just yesterday for a cookout for 30 people.  I was bombarded with requests for the recipe!  These are, by far, the best baked beans I've ever had in my life, bar none.  Absolutely dynamite!

I thought this was just ok. For my tastes, it was too sweet - but the rest of my family liked it. They'd give the recipe a 4-star rating. If I were to change anything, I'd use more beans and less brown sugar and maybe a little more worcestershire sauce. The onion, bell pepper and sausage were a good addition.

These were great baked beans!  I decided to go out of my territory and try a different and new recipe other than my usual.  This was a nice change but I dont think it will be replacing our favorite.  But it will definitely be made again!  Like a lot of others have said, it was very soupy.  I like my baked beans a little soupy, but this was too much.  So I added a drained small can of pork and beans to it to help the consistency.  We also like our baked beans sweet so I added a little more brown sugar.  I used cider vinegar as well and a little less than called for.  I cooked these low and slow in the crockpot for several hours, then right before serving put them in a 400 degree oven to get them nice and bubbly for about 30 minutes.  These made a nice spicy baked bean.  Very good and different!  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE: Ive made these a second time but without the sausage since I was serving it along side of pork ribs.  I didnt put them in the slow cooker this time but baked them.  I baked them for about 2 hours so that they would get nice and thick and dark brown.  They were delicious and I think I prefer making them this way without the sausage and cooking longer in the oven so all the liquid gets thick and caramelized.  They still are a nice spicy bean without the sausage.  I did add a little extra brown sugar again the second time, along with apple cider vinegar in place of the regular.  5 stars for sure this way, for me!

This is a good recipe- a little watery. I would drain the baked beans completely before adding all of the extras. A very good flavor and since I don't eat pork, I added soy sausage chunks and the taste was great!

I made these beans for the first time to take to a potluck, so took some the of the negative reviews into consideration and proceeded cautiously.  Some said it turns out too soupy: I used 2 28 oz. cans pork & beans and drained some of the liquid from the cans.  Still turned out on the soupy side.  Will drain completely next time.  Too spicy: Used same amounts of spices as recipe calls for when using only one can of beans.  Too vinegary: Used 2 Tbs vinegar instead of 4.  Used apple cider vinegar.  I used VanKamp Pork & Beans.  With the added can of beans, the only other increases I made in the recipe were, to use a LARGE onion (sweet), a LARGE bell pepper, and added an extra 1/4 brown sugar and 1 additional sausage.  I sauteed the onion, bell pepper and sausage before mixing everything together, and cooked on high in a crock pot for 3 hours.  Everyone loved the beans.  As a side dish it served 8 with a little left over.

I have been using this recipe for a couple years now, at least, and thought I'd finally rate it.  These are fantastic.  I use 3 cans of baked beans, not just one. I omit the bell pepper and cayenne and use ground sausage instead of links and then follow everything else to a T.  They are spicy enough for a little kick, but not too spicy!  I have gotten many many compliments over the years and been asked for the recipe several times.  It's a staple in our house for cookouts and potlucks and always will be.

Very good recipe.  I had bacon on hand so I used that instead of sausage.  I also softened the bell pepper and onion in a little of the bacon drippings before adding the rest.  The family loved them!

What a great find!  I have made this recipe numerous times and everyone raves about it.  I do leave out the sausage and bell peppers-just my preference.  I threw out all of my other baked bean recipes-this is now the only one I will make.  Thanks Daphne!

This recipe is great.  I made this for a church picnic and while it was easy to cook on a large scale it still turned out well.  I did make a few little changes including: using bacon instead of sausage, skipping the bell pepper, using a red onion, and adding some extra spices and a little whiskey as the beans slow cooked.

There ya go pilgrim!

Personally, I'd give this recipe 2 stars at most. I find it too sweet and salty. However, we've served it to guests twice and some of them seemed to like it. I just find it overwhelming as a side dish.

I started to make this recipe last year.  My husband requests it all summer long.  My 18 month old daughter (last summer) loved it.  Suprisingly she did not mind the spiciness of the sauce.  It is a great recipe and I am always asked to make it for barbeques!

I dont know if it's just me, but I did not really care for this recipe.  I bet the brand, etc. of baked beans makes a big difference.  I bought the Bush's Original, and the end result was a too tomato-ie flavor to these beans.  My hubby ate them, but he'll eat just about anything that doesn't bite him back.  This got such good reviews though, so I'm thinking it was the brand of the beans, maybe this is better with B&M brand or something.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I really did wow people at my barbeque.
Everyone at the barbeque was falling all over this dish, and asking for the recipe.
The only complaint that I received was that I didn't make enough for everyone to have second or thirds!  

I did leave out the pork sausage and bell peppers, however, so maybe it would be
even better with these two pieces.  But the combination of chili powder, Worcheshire sauce,
and garlic power was key to the spicy, sassy taste.  

BEST BAKED BEAN recipe ever!!!!!!

These beans were great.  The only thing I switched was to use bacon because that was all I had.  This will now be my new baked bean recipe.  I love that they were sweet with a bit of a kick.

There's beans, and there's Texas Ranger Baked Beans - Chuck Norris would be proud - these are a great compliment to a variety of spreads.

This is such a wonderful recipe.  I completely followed it the first time and did find that it could use more beans.  Other then that it is great.  Everyone went for seconds.

I didn't elimate any extra liquid from the can of baked beans (Bush's Homestyle Baked Beans) but then decreased the vinegar by 1 tablespoon. We're not big green pepper fans so I used 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes instead. I also picked up 1/2 pound spicy pork sausage to replace the links. My mother-in-law preferred these to her own family recipe.
**5/12 addition: We have made these several times since the original review and still love them. I've gotten "braver" and save myself some kitchen warmth by using the slow cooker. Half a day in there and they're as good or better than from the oven!

Using a 28 oz. can of Bush's Baked Beans, I followed the recipe except that I forgot to add garlic powder, and I don't care for sausage, so I left that out. I opted for adding cayenne, which gave the beans a nice zing. The sweetness is offset just the right amount by the tartness of the other ingredients. Even with the omissions, I think this recipe is a sure winner that I definitely recommend.

I've never made baked beans before, but I've always loved them sweet, spicy, and flavorful. I tried this recipe for a barbeque, and doubled most of the ingredients. I was sure I had made too much, but they disappeared so quick! These were the best baked beans I've had, and I will be making them from now on!

I've made variations of this in the past but never with pork sausage. Liked this so much better than adding hamburger. Great for Memorial Day.

I have made this recipe numerous times.  I deleted the green pepper and found that I only needed 2 tablespoons vinegar.  I also just used ground pork breakfast sausage instead of the links.This is one of my most requested recipes for summer bar b ques.

FAAANN-FRIGGGING-TASTIC! Great way to serve beans. BEST beans ever, comments I got from my guests "restaurant quality", "best beans I've EVER had", "may I take some home", "can I have the recipe", etc. PLEASE DRAIN the liquid from the beans before putting in dutch oven. Use different color bell peppers to make it attractive (I like yellow and green... or red & green for xmas). Perfect mix of flavors. TRY THIS RECIPE. (Did I mention drain the beans?)

I can't stop making this recipe it moves up a notch.  I look for every fitting occasion.  I use top of the line sausage.  I just go to work on theese beans a great recipe.  Many variations will work as long as you don't leave out the key spices. BadaBang.

These are a fav in my fam! Except i buy 3 cans of the large beans, and i buy 3 different flavors that Bush Beans offers, for a mixture (honey,boston,maple). I use 1 onion & 1 bell pepper. I then double the rest of the ingredients and put it in a crock pot and let sit on low 1/2 day or so.

Delicious!  Even my extremely picky vegetarian son liked it!  Used a combo of left over canned vegetarian baked beans & left over Best Black Beans from this site to measure out about 28 ounces, half the onion & bell pepper, & used left over home made pizza sauce instead of ketchup.  Instead of sausage, I crumbled up some left over hamburger patties (set aside some non-meat mixture for vegetarian son).  Served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site (made with gluten free all purpose flour).  Delicious served cold the next day!  This recipe is so versatile & forgiving!  Great recipe, especially for an ok cook like me!

Fantastic!  I mixed these up (without the sausage )then placed some pork chops in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Used 1 Tbsp chili powder & 1 Tbsp Chipotle powder.  Poured the beans over the chops & cooked on low all day.  Truly Pork & Beans!

Great recipe.  One of the best I've had.  I doubled the beans and would probably cook it without a lid for the last 1/2 hour next time to thicken up a bit.

Wow oh wow... These had some serious kick to them. I used some spicy sausage that were indeed spicy. I used Bush's vegetarian beans. I loved these beans at first bite, but as I continued to eat them I was overwhelmed by spice. Good beans.... I think I will choose a different sausage and see if it turns out differently.

5/20/10 - UPDATE.  I made this dish for the 4th BBQ and people RAVE about these beans. I tend to not use the bell peppers though...This is a super easy and super inexpensive dish to make.  I doubled the recipe and followed as is minus the green peppers.  I thought that overall it was really good but maybe a little too tangy??!!? I used the right amount of Worchester and Vinegar so I'm not sure what I did wrong.  But it still got a TON of compliments on it and it went pretty fast.  No one else seemed to mention the tanginess of it so perhaps I didn't measure quite exact?  Dunno.  Bottom line I will try it again be/ca overall the taste was awesome!!!

These beans are awesome!  I cooked them in my smoker, and placed them under a brisket I was smoking, and let the juice from the brisket drip down into the beans.  Also, I used chopped pieces of brisket in the beans in place of the sausage.  Definitely a keeper!

Brought this to a birthday party and several people commented on how good this was. Thanks for making me look like I can cook. I only made two changes. I added less chili powder and added a mild chili pepper chopped. I also used my own beans. Will use this again. Thanks.

I didn't have chili powder so I used 1/2 cup chili sauce instead of the ketchup.  I also used the juice from my jar of jalapeno peppers instead of the vinegar.  Of course I had to add some chopped jalapeno - about 2 tablespoons' worth.  This came out a tad more spicy which is what we like.  If you want to kick up the heat from the original recipe this is a great version!

Dee-licious!  As a fellow Texan, I give this a big two thumbs up.  My kids and husband loved it too.  I did make a few changes.  I sauteed the onions and garlic first.  I omitted the bell pepper and ketchup (personal preference).  I added a can of kidney beans, drained, to have enough to feed my family of 5.  I added a little less chili pepper than called for, for the kids' sake, and left out the optional cayenne.  I also threw in a little extra salisbury steak we had left over.  I resisted the urge to throw in some liquid smoke and I'm glad I did because the beans didn't need it at all.  I mixed it all up and warmed it in the crock pot for a couple hours instead of in the oven.  This will go into our regular rotation for sure. The perfect way to use up leftover sausage, hot dogs or  hamburger meat.  Thanks for such a yummy and easy recipe!

My wife and I thought this was a fabulous recipe, though my brother did not like them.  They are a definite surprise if you prefer "tried and true."  I concur with other reviewers: 1) only used one tablespoon of chili powder--that seems about right, 2) the beans were way too runny.  I drained the beans completely and they were still awfully runny, 3) I may cut down on the brown sugar next time.   Indeed, they were very sweet (but wonderful).  I used Italian white wine vinagar, which was fabulous, though next time I may cut back on the vinegar to see how it turns out.  Obviously, the vinegar contributes to the excessive liquid state.  The taste of these beans were absolutely awesome--a sweet/sour contrast which is jacked up a notch with the sausage.  Excellent!

Great way to use up leftover bbq.  I chopped up leftover bbq sausage links and brisket in place of the 4 links of spicy pork sausage.  I will definitely make it again.

I am not a fan of baked beans but this recipe made me an ultimate fan!  Thank you so much for this recipe..it will be used again and again.  UPDATE: this is one of my most requested cookout dishes.  I cook up the sausage and onion then just dump all ingredients (doubled) into the crockpot and set on low for an hour or two.  I do leave out the green pepper, but that's just personal preference.  So easy!

I didn't have any sausage, so I browned 4 slices of bacon, and sauteed the onions in the grease. I omitted the green pepper, but otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. I can't decide whether there is too much ketchup or too much Worcestershire sauce, but I will play with this recipe a bit until I get it exactly to my personal tastes. Overall, a very good recipe!

This is one of my most frequently used recipes from this site!! My copy is used so often, it's spattered with Texas Ranger Bean delicousness!  Standard recipe works great, though I use only 3Tbl apple cider vinegar.  Great when done on the stovetop, too!  I've used all types of sausage, but spicy has been most popular with my bunch.  Great recipe, Daphne!

It was good, but I wasn't blown away by this.  Don't know that I'll go out of my way to make it again, but I am glad I tried it.  I agree that it needed more beans.  Maybe thrown an extra can of drained pintos in on top of the can of baked beans.

First time I made these I used the baked beans... we found them to be too sweet and soupy... second time I made them, I used pinto beans, ground spicy sausage and more onions... YUM! much better my way ;-)

Certainly has a kick but not fussed on the amount of Worchestershire sauce or chili powder, will adjust those amounts next time.

This recipe is a keeper!  I used regular sausage insead of the spicy.  I put all the liquid including the onions and peppers in a pan prior to baking and reduced the amount of liquid. The flavor is very spicy so careful with the chili powder.  This is a great recipe-didn't change a thing except reduced all the liquid.  This is the best baked bean recipe I've ever made.

WOW!!! I made this for the 4th of July for our family and they raved about how good they were. I don't like baked beans, so I was happy they liked them and said I would try them later. Finally I did and Holy cow!! I LOVE these beans! I make them every week now. They are fantastic. My husband loves them, my mother in law just made them because they love them, and I'm giving the recipe to several people I know. MAKE THESE BEANS!! They are delicious!! If you don't like sausage, leave it out, the beans still taste great. If you do like sausage, you will love it in with the beans!!

I just want to say that this is the most fantastic baked beans recipe. I've never cared much for baked beans...However, this recipe has changed how I feel about them. As for the person that says simply open up a can and drain the liquid...lol...yeah, do that if you want boring bland baked beans. As for these baked beans...omg...they are out of this world fantastic!

Only one person in my family liked these beans.  The sauce did not cook down enough, so the bean were still soupy and the flavor was just "not all that."  Not sure why the recipe earned so many stars, but I won't be trying it again.

Excellent. I used just a regular can of baked beans (not pork and beans).  One recommendation is to drain some of the liquid from the beans. You get so much liquid while they are cooking that you definitely do not need the extra liquid from the can.

Outstanding not too sweet yet not too spicy beans. Wonderful with pulled pork!  I think the spice measurements are way too much for only one can of beans, and use THREE or FOUR 28oz cans of Bush's Best Baked Beans for the amount listed. My husband prefers them a little milder than I do.  I just throw the ingredients  in a crock pot and let them simmer away. They are even better the next day.

My husband and I made these for a large group while camping.  We simmered the beans over a campfire and served with pulled pork sandwiches.  These beans were delicious and we barely had any leftovers!  The leftovers we did have we served on top of hotdogs the next day, delish!  One thing to note is that we couldn't find the right kind of pork sausage when we were shopping, so we used bacon ends instead.  Turned out great!

My picky husband said this is the best food he's ever had.  I did have to add a second can of beans though because it was too spicy for him, and I skipped the cayenne pepper. Yummy!

These Baked Beans were good for a non-traditional type of baked bead dish.  Good for the younger crowds because they like spicy foods but I prefer a more traditional baked beans dish with bacon and brown sugar!

Very good.  I tripled the recipe and used: 2 onion, 2 red bell pepper, 2/3 of the sugar and vinegar.  I drained 2 of the 3 cans.  I cooked as directed and the onions and peppers still tasted raw/crunchy...so simmered on stovetop for an hour or so until time to eat and they were perfect.  I am glad I modified it as i did - because if I had used all of the sugar and vinegar and even the onion and bellpepper - it would have been too much.  I also used regular breakfast sausage and the spice was perfect (due to just the chilipowder - no cayenne) - also - they were even yummier the next day.  I got several compliments - even from my Father in Law!  that's always a plus ;-)

These were excellent!  I made them for the 4th and they got rave reviews.  I doubled the recipe, used plain pork 'n beans and hot breakfast sausage.  So easy to make, this will definitely be my go-to recipe for baked beans!  Thanks Daphne!

So simple, so yummy and definitely Texan because it has got the heat in the dish that they love, love, love.  If your not big on spicy...your still going to love it ;-) Just omit a little of the chili powder by a tablespoon or so and use beef sausage instead of spicy. Like others strongly suggested, I stuck with Bush Beans and it was great. PS: Thanks for submitting this because I needed something quick to wow the in-laws (all whom are Texas natives and proud of it) this 4th of July weekend and this recipe will be a huge hit :-)

I am giving this 5 stars because these beans are awsome indeed.  However, let me tell you my bean story.  My dad has been making "his famous beans" since I can remember and they are some kind of version of these except he eyeballs all the ingredients.  The 3 ingredient that are going to make or break the recipe are the vinegar, brn sugar and ketchup which is why i looked up the recipe.  When you eyeball every time they tend to always be slightly off so I wanted exact amounts.  I am an all recipes junky and I wanted a guideline because I always get bombarded with raves about my beans.  when to me they have "tasted better".  So heres the thing, everyone has different tastes.  Try making these beans with a whole slab of regular bacon instead of the sausage.  Let it brown until it is as crispy as it gets until it burns.  add in your onion and peppers and continue to saute for 10 min or so until they are nicely browned.  Dont worry, the liquid from the veggies will keep the bacon from getting browner, trust me, the bacon somehow stops cooking.  If you dont let the bacon get very well done first you will end up with soggy bacon.  anyways, then add your beans and try starting out with 2 tbsp vinegar, 1/4 C brn sugar, 1/4 C ketchup.  If it isnt quite right for you at that time, try adding equal amounts until it is to your desired flavor.  This recipe is way too sweet for me, and I love putting sugar in almost all my sauces.  I could tell when i made it that is was way more than i had

Ok, I didn't use the pepper(nobody in my family would have eaten them if I had) and I couldn't find the spicy sausage links or anything close to it at our grocery store, but......
Oh my these beans were YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!! I loved that they were a little spicy, not too sweet and lots of tangy. I took about 6 strips of bacon and cut them into 1 inch squares, cooked them a little bit, then put them on top of the beans while they were baking. You can't ever go wrong with a little bacon, right?
I will be making these again!!!!
Thanks for such a great recipe!

hubby said these were the best beans he ever tasted. I did use Heinze spicy ketchup instead of regular ketchup and excluded the pepper. It gave it a little spice, but not to much for a child. Next time I think I will double it because it goes fast.

I brought these to an elderly picnic and thus left out the cayenne and used regular sausage links.  I received a few compliments.  My husband enjoyed the sweetness of them.  I thought they were too sweet, but I used brown sugar Splenda (less than called for) & Splenda may be sweeter than the real thing.  I used more chili powder and vinegar than called for to cut back on the sweetness and did not find them very spicy at all.  Also used 3 times as many sausage links to evenly distribute. Fried up the onion, green pepper and used fresh garlic and you can never get enough of that in beans.  All in all a very hearty baked bean recipe with a sweet and sour type flavor.  I will make again...with less sugar and with the spiciness and expect they will be great.

Wow! Outstanding baked beans! I have been making the same recipe now for over 20 years, it is my Mother's recipe but decided to try something new and instead of there being lots of leftovers, with this recipe, there were none! For those of you that are afraid to 'stray' away from your tried and true recipe's, this one will not fail you!

My husband raved about these beans and now wants me to make them every time I make baked beans.  I only put half of the vinegar in them, but that was due to my preference.  They were the best baked beans I have ever had too!

Wayyyyy too sweet & vinegar-y!  BUT, my brother-in-law who is the "king" of making baked beans liked it!  I think the vinegar was the main thing that gave a "sour" taste (I didn't even put in as much as it was called for).  I think a wise thing to remember in many recipes is to not put in as much spices to begin with to see if it fits your taste.  One can always add the required amount or more.

Very good taste, but far too runny.  I would recommend removing the cover after 30 minutes to thicken it up.  I put it back in the oven at 400 degrees for another 15 min. and consistency and flavor was much better.

Great bean recipe. I used two cans of beans; one Country  Style and one Maple and also I used bacon this time (bacon is always good)  but I'll try it with the sausage next time - will make a very hearty side/dinner! YUM! It was a big success at a company potluck! 
*I used a crock pot - worked great.

So I baked this on the higher "slow cook" setting in my slow cooker for 2.5 hours. It was a bit on the runnier side, so I then baked at 325 in the oven for 30 minutes. This'll thicken the sauce up a bit and give it a really good texture. Anyhow, really delicious recipe.

Will definitely be making this again! Wow these were good!! I also used the Bush Maple baked beans instead of pork and beans. Not sure if the maple added to the sweetness or not, but some of my guests did comment it was too much on the sweet side for their taste. Other guests couldn't stop eating it (including myself). Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half or try pork and beans instead of Bush maple. This are some of the best baked beans I have eaten. Super yummy!

I have used this recipe many times and have only gotten rave reviews.  I did make one change and that is to use bbq sauce instead of ketchup. I always have to make at least a triple batch and never have any left overs. I will agree that the addition of the vinegar does make it a tad soupy but I make it a day ahead, drain the beans very well and bake in the oven the day of and that seems to take care of the extra liquid.  Cant say enough good things and thanks to Daphne for sharing.

This was a great recipe, but then again, I love pretty much anything in this genre (baked beans or pork and beans, doctored up). I was a little confused on the main "baked beans with pork" ingredient, though. I checked my store shelves and didn't know if you meant "baked beans" (which featured bacon and brown sugar), or "pork and beans" (which featured pork and tomato puree). And the recipe already had both brown sugar and ketchup (tomatoes, that is). I chose the pork and beans. For the sausages, I used some Johnsonville "Hot Italian Sausage Links". Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as written, using a yellow onion and rice vinegar. The results were very tasty, but the Italian sausage was a little unusual (but good) in flavor here. The sauce was richly-flavored, too, and I liked the addition of the diced pepper and onion - they fleshed out the dish. I'll save this one, and perhaps make it again with a different type of spicy sausage.

I must say these beans were excellent. But my husband didn't care for them when I first took out of oven and tasted. The following day was our party and he couldn't believe this was the same beans. The flavor was soooo much better a day later. They were a hit! ( make sure you make more than you need so you have leftovers )

I loooove spicy but this was a bit much for some of my guests and I only added 2 spicy links. I also used 1 T.  of chipoltle chili powder and one regular, 2 T. vinegar, and half the bell pepper. I don't have a dutch oven so I had to cook about 45 minutes longer. **It thickens after it cools**. Next time I am definitely adding another can of beans! Still going in my favorites!!

This has to be THE best baked bean recipe EVER! Normally, when someone in my family makes baked beans, there are aways leftovers. I made this and really didn't change anything. My husband went back for seconds, and the pan was clean! Perfect for any summer time meal

Been doing this recipe for a while and love it as everyone who eats it does. I do not use pork links. I brown 1/2 lb ground burger and 1/2 lb spicy jimmy dean pork sausage. Kinda a cross between sloppy joes and baked beans but served as beans. delicious.

Great recipe to spice up baked beans.  I also use the same flavoring to spice up ground beef for tacos (+ add some taco seasioning to give it a mexican flair).  My husband is addicted to this and would be happy if I made these for every meal!

We fixed these beans tonight for our cookout. They were delicious!!! I did use Bush's beans for the recipe and the mild Jimmy Dean sausage, about 4 slices of it. The rest of the spices were enough, so the spicy sausage might have been a bit much for us. I did use the dash of cayenne and that is all it needed. They were YUMMMY!!! We plan to use this recipe over and over. PS- My husband kept eating and going MMM, MMM, MMM!!!

I was really surprised how much I loved these BBs! I cut back a little on the sugar and didn't bother with the cayenne pepper. I cooked it in the slow cooker for a few hours on Low - turned out great! The only thing I would change next time would be to use dried beans (pinto maybe) so that they had a firmer texture. Great recipe, Daphne! Thanks!

This was a great recipe. Left the Cayenne out, and it turned out to be a nice tangy flavor that even the kids liked. I'll definitely make it again.

These were excellent, a nice balance between sweet and spicy. I only had a large onion, and due to some in experience on my part I used the whole thing. I would recommend using half of a large one unless you really really love onion.

I liked this a lot. It was spicy, but not too hot. I did omit the cayanne pepper for the family. I loved the robust flavor. I only felt that the Katchup was too obvious in the recipe. My husband didn't like it too much, but he likes sweeter beans. I like the kick!

I've made these twice now.  Both times, I used vegetarian baked bean and subbed cooked, chopped bacon for the sausage.  The first time we found them a little too sweet for our tastes as well as a little too spicy.  The second time, I omitted the sugar (as canned beans are already sweet) and cut the chili powder in half.  Perfect for us!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good recipe but very spicy as is in my opinion.  My guests seemed to like it, but I wasn't expecting it to be as spicy as it was and I halved the chili powder!  Maybe just my taste buds.  It did have a good flavor, though.

This was my first time serving Baked beans.  They came out fabulous!  Omitted the onion and added a fresh jalepeno.  Cooked in crock pot on low for 4 hours.  Even hubby who does not like BBQ liked these!

Total hit at my place ! I used chipolata sausages, just a sprinkle of the chilli powder and only 3 tbsp of vinegar. The kids ate the lot ! Ages 12 and 8. My parents loved it too. This recipe is a keeper. For the Aussies, I used 3 whole cans of Heinz Baked Beans in ham sauce. Will make again and again. Thank you so much !

While visiting my brother in Texas he made these beans, and I was hooked!  When I made them at home I replaced the pork sausage with turkey instead. "GREAT" baked beans!!!!

I tried this for a 4th of July cook out in our new home.  Although it was just my husband and I, he told me to be sure that I logged in and rated this recipe. He thought the beans were "wonderful." I did make a couple of alterations: 1/2 lb of ground sausage (hot), 1/2 lb of ground chuck, and dry mustard powder.

This was really good.  I was looking for something spicy that had some sort of meat in it as well.  I used hot ground pork sausage and it turned out really good.  My oldest son and his girlfriend were the taste testers and they both loved the flavor.  Personally, when I make these for the 4th of July I will make them with a little more heat, maybe add some jalapenos!!!!  Give this one a try.  You won't be dissapointed.

YUMMY! Made these last night in the crock pot. Husband watched me browning the sausage in the morning..I like that he sees me toiling in the kitchen before he goes to work 'as if'.  I'm definitely going to make these for a neighbor's baby shower/fill the freezer and diaper shower!!! Thanks very much for the recipe-I've been wanting a fabulous bean recipe for a lonnngg time!

Excellent recipe! Everyone loved the beans and were asking for the recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.  Only a few changes to use what I had on hand at the house. 1. I increased serving size to 8.  2. Used a large can (54 oz.) of bush's baked beans. 3. Used a roll of sausage (medium heat) crumbled, browned and drained. 4. A splash of spicy A-1 sauce.

This is the first time I made the baked beans.  The dish was polished off, I didn't even had a bite. So I assumed it's good.Added bacon bits too since I had some made beforehand.

My family and I thought these were the best beans we have ever had. The only thing I changed was I used spicy pork breakfast sausage and I added thick cut bacon, everything else was the same. I will make this time and time again.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and although my family members aren't big on beans, they enjoyed them. I used 2 cans of Heinz maple beans and 5 honey garlic sausage links this past time. I never use vinegar and I remove the lid of my dutch oven with 30 min left of cooking time. I also cut the chili powder to 1 tbs. Thanks :)

I have made this several times now for family gatherings and pot lucks and everyone raves about it.  The only thing I change is using Hot Italian Sausage to add more zing.  This is a must try recipe.

I have been looking for a good baked bean recipe and now I have found one. This recipe is so easy to make and the taste is exactly what I have been looking for. These are awesome! I cooked them in a crockpot and cut up 4 smoked sausage with cheddar cheese brats.

This is a wonderful change from the regular baked beans.  After my guests tasted the baked beans, they were coming back for more.  This will be a recipe that I will be making on a regular basis.

These beans are by far my most complimented dish.  Whenever I make it, I print copies of the recipe so people can take it home with them.    I follow the recipe exactly and they are great every time.

I'm not sure whether to give this 3 1/2 stars or 4. I didn't add any pork, but made a vegetarian version, so I raised it to 4. Too much vinegar, sugar and worchestire for me. When I first mixed it all into the beans, I tasted them, and they tasted fine, but baking in the oven seems to intensify the flavours ALOT. This tastes alright over salad as a protein source. Thankyou for the recipe. Oh and I didn't add any chili as this was spicy enough.

This is just like the beans that my mother made growing up, but she just added all the ingredients and did it by taste.  The only change is use DILL PICKLE JUICE instead of the VINEGAR.  It makes them even better.

These beans are fantastic! I omit the bell pepper because my boyfriend doesn't care for it, and I sometimes add a little more spice just because we love it like that. My girlfriend's 9-year-old picky eater daughter ate bowl after bowl. I love how easy this is too...just throw everything in your dutch oven, and into the oven it goes!

Loved this recipe!! I made it for a football tailgate party where the main dish was fried chicken, so I doubled it. Like another reviewer, instead of the sausage, I added northern beans. I cooked it in the crockpot for 4 hrs., probably could have cooked for only 2-3 hrs. I also drained half of the fluid from the beans so it would be thick. Everyone loved them!! I will make these again and again- they're great for any picnic, potluck, etc!!

These are a little too "southwestern" for me. They are good if you like that style, I prefer the more common homestyle baked beans.

I dont eat baked beans but my fiance loves them. He always talked about a friends mother making the best baked beans ever, and after tasting these said these were even better than hers!!! Ive been making them this way ever since. I used bacon instead of sausage but as for everything else, i use exactly as written above:] From all the compliments I get, this is an AWESOME recipe!

I always drain the pork and beans when making baked beans, so this was not soupy for me at all.  I didn't have the sausage but my family loves this recipe.  I am use to ketchup/mustard/brown sugar baked beans so this was a new refreshing way to eat them.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe tastes delicious, but it should be called "Texas Ranger Baked Bean Soup."  That's why I only gave it 4 stars.  I used a slotted spoon to remove the beans and just a small amount of juice from the soup.  If I make it again I will drain the beans.  Also, it was a little too spicy hot for my taste, though my husband likes it that way.  I used cajun sausage, which I won't do next time.

These were good, but were a little sweet for my taste.  I made the recipe as follows except I did not use the hot sausage and I only used one T of chili powder because mine is fresh and spicey.  I used 2 cans of beans and drained the one can, but I wish I had drained both.  I think it ends up soupy because the lid is kept on the beans the entire cooking time.  Next time I make these I will cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 C, drain both cans of beans and take the lid off the last 15 minutes of cooking that should allow the beans to thicken up a bit.  Thanks for sharing.

These were good.  I used only 2 T. vinegar and 1 1/2 T. chili powder but kept everything else the same.  My one comment is that I drained the beans first based on what one reviewer said about them drowning in sauce.  It was a mistake.  They were then too dry.  Flavor was very good, although not traditional.

This was pretty darn good.  The recipes was simple to follow and took no time at all to put it together.  Since I did not have the sausage I substituted bacon instead.  Still turned out great!

These were the best baked beans I have ever had. They were hot and spicey. I added cyanne pepper, onion powder (since my guests were not onion fans), and I used hot sausage. Yummy!

Very Very Very GOOD!  My pickcy son LOVES them.  If yours are a little "soupy" just take the lid off the pot the last 15 minutes or so of baking time!  i also used, precooked bacon instead of the sausage.
Thanks for the Excellant Recipe!

A lot of work, but well worth it. I can't go anywhere without taking this recipe any more....always requested!.  I cook my onion, pepper and sausage, then add other ingredients and let simmer on stove top instead of putting in oven.  GREAT left over too!

I absolutely love this recipe, though people with a more sensitive palate may find it a bit too potent.  It certainly has a kick to it!  To make it a bit more healthy, I use a can of baked beans without pork, and use less sausage.  I also try to sneak in a bit more cayenne when my wife's not looking.  Excellent for clearing sinuses and waking up sleepy dinner guests.  I hear Chuck Norris ate this when he was a baby.  ;)

This recipe was fantastic. Not the traditional baked bean, but no one was disappointed, they were gone in a flash.  I loved the kick these beans had but I will lessen the chili powder just a tad next time, a little overpowering I am thinking 1 1/2 instead of 2 TBLS.  I also used about a half lb. of ground pork (regular flavored)sausage instead of the links so it would be more evenly distributed and it worked great.

I made this for a Memorial Day cook-out. As advised by others, I drained the beans, used 1t of vinegar, 2t chili powder and 1T Worcestershire.  Everyone loved it and have requested it for the Labor Day cook-out! Thanks!

my husband loved this and he is a Texan. i thought it was very good. I would rate it five if any of the heat in the dish was at the tip of the tongue rather than all at the end of the bite. I did add a pinch of the reccommended cayenne pepper and also 5 dashes of tobasco. Would more of these help accomplish an initial spiciness? I also wonder if it could achieve the tangy flavor without quite so many calories.

I have made theses over and over, they are the hit of any dinner.  I read the reviews first (as always) and I did cut back on the vinegar.  Every cook out party I am asked to bring the beans.

I thought this recipe was o.k. but no one else did
I think it was all the vinegar! I would at least cut the amount in half.I'm not sure about the amount of chili powder either..I will still try making this again with some adjustments.I really liked the idea of the sausage.I'm going to tone it down a bit next time.

This one is definitely a winner! I can't say enough about just how wonderful these were. I made them last night and with just the three of us....there was not anything left. I used a can of bushes country style bean and they are already pretty thick so I had no problem, even after adding the rest of the ingredients to get them to thicken up. The only thing that I did differnt was...I only added about a tablesoon of chili powder as I thought that 2 would have been a little too much. My son, who hardly ever eats beans...had two helpings  :)  This is a definite must try for everyone out there. You will love them. Thank you Daphne!

I changed this recipe a lot from the ingredients and the type of beans I used.  I started all the way from scratch.  Being I varied this recipe too much, I do not feel I can give it a valid rating, however the end result was very good.

On the easy scale it is really easy.  This recipe also tasted really good.  I gave it a one because it contained sugar and I gained weight.  Therefor I feel that it is not a very good recipe even though I substituted the canned beans for beans cooked in the crock pot.  I would have substituted the brown sugar for mango or pineapple if I had to do it again.  The taste was there but my body paid the price with the calories and hard to accept weight the came onto my body when I ate this recipe.

The.  Best.  Beans.  I get asked all the time to bring them to our boys fall golf trip.  They are part of the tradition.  I use yellow or orange peppers to add colour.  I’ve added spicy Italian sausage plus a pound of fried bacon crumbled.  I use maple burns beans and kinda drain the sauce as best I can, otherwise too soupy.  Another tip if a bit runny, take the lid off for a bit, it will thicken.  Better the next day too!  5 stars!  Two thumbs!

This is exceptional and as close to authentic Texas flavors that I have for quite some time.  Moved from Texas to Tennessee several years ago and while Tennessee has  many fine points and beautiful countryside vistas, their barbeque doesn't quite compare to Texas!!!!

I made this in the crock pot for convenience.  I used hot Italian sausage but I couldn't overcome the sweetness.  I'll cut back or eliminate the sugar next time but I will make again.

Left out the green pepper, used regular pork sausage links instead of spicy and only 1 tablespoon of chili powder.  Increased time to 1 hour 15 minutes uncovered.  Delicious!

OK recipe, but kind of bland. Second time I made it I used Devils" Spit BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and it was much better. I also cooked it uncovered on the grill with some Applewood chips.

These were good, but I like the ones out of the Betty Crocker cookbook better.  They came out runnier than I like them.  Next time I'll stick to my old recipe.

This is a quick and easy dish to put together and cook. I used all the listed ingredients but also added a couple cloves of garlic and about a 1/2" inch of ginger. Turning my pressure cooker on 'reheat',  I added the vegetables and sausage as I went along. After these ingredients were added and cooked for a few minutes, I put in the beans and seasoning mix, then closed the lid and cooked under pressure for 4 minutes, letting the pressure vent out naturally. The dish was delicious and I will be making this again.

We have an old standby from a crockpot cookbook.  Think I'll stick with tried and true. This ridge may be a good rendition of Texas baked beans but was disappointing for this Kansas family.

I made the mistake of using "southern style" baked beans which are already quite sweet. When I added the brown sugar it did turn out to be really sweet. Otherwise, I can tell this is a great recipe, it was just more user-error. I did substitute ground spicy sausage and it was great.

This is so yummy!  Hubby and I had double servings.  The only thing I did different was used an additional 2 small cans of beans and let them drain.  Hubby said don't change a thing its a keeper!

Best baked beans ever! I've made these twice; both times I used Bush's original baked beans. The first time, I made these to the letter of the recipe. The second time, I made 3 minor tweeks: 1) drained the juice off the top of the can of beans. 2) used half the green pepper called for. 3) added 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (intended to replace the bean juice I'd removed). Both versions were great, I think the second version was better. This is a keeper!

I doubled all ingredients for a family picnic except for the beans which I quadrupled. I used Busch's home style baked beans. These were a big hit. I did not drain the beans and they were a little soupy but I wouldn't change a thing. My husband really bragged on these and he's typically not a big baked beans fan.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. My mom makes delicious baked beans and these were just as good if not a little more rich. Next time, I will cut down on the amount of ketchup as it was a bit too much for me. I will make these every time I want baked beans. A++++

I did not include the bell peppers. I only used 1/2 the recommended chili powder, but it would have been great with the full amount.  I also took 5 strips of bacon and cut them into 4 pieces each for a total of 20 pieces of bacon and I covered the surface of the beans with bacon. Very delicious. Very well received. I will make these again.

Fantastic recipe. I used two cans of beans drained completely and 6 sausage links grounded up. Cook for an extra 30 minutes uncovered and it will come out great. These beans got destroyed by everyone at a cookout I hosted. Will use this recipe again and again.

I will start off by saying that i have been making these beans using this recipe for a good 1 1/2yrs at least. This is a really good recipe. My kids are picky eaters and they love these beans. I made these beans about 2 weeks ago for my girlfriend and she ask for them every weekend. Even the aroma these beans give off during cooking gets me compliments if company comes over. I use the Bush Brown Sugar and Bacon beans in the brown can for this recipe.

Everyone loved them. I don't like bell pepper so I should have kept it out. Also, don't do what I did. I used a slow cooker. Not good and was soupy. I bought another can of beans, scooped a few spoonfuls of beans from crockpot and put it in oven. Then I finally served them. Lots of compliments.

Made them for the first time on the holiday without the sausage.  They were a big hit.  Next holiday will add meat.  This a great cookout side dish.

Incredible baked bean recipe.  I told one friend you start with a can of baked beans & they were puzzled saying 'so you are pretty much just enhancing a can of baked beans.'  That is true but boy are they good.

Excellent. I didn't have the onion or  green pepper. I was nervous about the vinegar so I left in out. Even without these the beans were great. I will add the onion and green pepper next time. Thanks for this recipe.

I have used this recipe many times since I first saw it here. There are never any left-overs and I have been asked for the recipe many times. The only thing I do different is that I use more sausage than is called for.

Recipe was good - next time I will use a little less brown sugar - 1/2 cup made it too sweet for my families taste.  I will also use a little less chili powder (but not much less) overall it was good and my daughter love the aroma while it was in the oven

Wonderful!!  I halved the chili powder, used mild Johnsonville Sausage, and it still had plenty of flavor.  Adults and kids loved this.  I cooked in the crock pot on low for about 4.5 hours.  Really great for a football party or fall get together...

These were excellent and a HUGE hit!  I substituted the spicy pork links with a pound of thick cut peppered bacon and cooked in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours. This was almost a meal in itself!  Will definitely make again.

I made this in June 2008 at my Husband's outdoor Retirement from the Navy BBQ party. It was the hit of the party, well, food-wise. Everyone kept telling me how great this was.  The only thing I changed was I bought Bush's Maple beans, instead of the Pork beans, I don't like pork.

I've made these beans numerous times this summer for cookouts and always get rave reviews.  The only modification I make is to leave the sausage out and add 1 can of Great Northern beans, then put it all in the crock pot on high for 4 hrs.  Leftover beans are great warmed up the next day!

This is one of my favorites, and is a hit every time I make it. I like to use beans that have brown sugar, onions, etc already it them. I also leave a little more of the juice from the beans out and add a little bit of BBQ sauce. I have also made huge batches with 3 28 ounce cans of beans and 2 lbs of sausage. Get the extra hot sausage!

The beans were not too sweet and the addition of link sausage was a very nice change from the ground variety. Loved these beans and so did my guest.

I personally thought this recipe was too soupy (too much liquid) and too sweet.

Just made this according to the directions and it was great. Sweet at first taste and then the heat takes you by suprise. Not overwhelmingly spicy but if you are not used to spice this may not be for you. This one goes in my box and has me thinking of variations.

These baked beans are spectacular!  I made them for a picnic and everyone loved them.  They all asked for the recipe!  I didn't change anything... and won't.  This recipe is perfect as is!

If you like spicy baked beans these are the ones for you. These were a big hit at the family cookout.  I did double the beans used and I cooked them a bit longer so they were less soupy. Oh, and I used bacon instead of sausage.  Will be taking these to the family reunion.

These beans were a hit at my class reunion. Instead of the oven, I simmered them all night on low in a crock pot.  They cooked down well.

I just made this with dinner last night and it was BIG hit.  Even my finiky 8 year old said, "Mom, I LOVE this!  You're the best cook!"  Everyone had second helpings.  Thank you.

Can't say these beans suited our taste perfectly, but they came pretty darn close! They really are delicious and my husband went on and on about them. I atually sauted my onions and peppers and ground pork all together and added the other ingredients to the pot before baking. I didn't drain my beans and I had no problem with too much liquid. I am looking forward to cooking these in a crock pot this weekend for a BBQ at my home. I am sure everyone will love them!

Loved these!  I only used half an onion and still thought that was too much onion, so next time I will use a little less.  I accidentally left out the brown sugar and didn't miss it - maybe next time I will add it and see.  These beans are very different from "plain" baked beans and just what I was looking for.  This is a keeper!

These turned out great!  I thought the chili poweder added a great kick to sweet beans.  I used the molasses and pork kind because I figured they would work best with the recipe.  We didn't even taste the vinegar in them at all, perhaps it's the kind of vinegar other reviewers used, we used white vinegar.  If you are planning on serving them to kids however I might cut the chili powder a bit, as my kids said they were too spicy.  Thanks for sharing this quick easy recipe for doctoring up canned beans!

This recipe is almost perfect! I use a pound of hot pork sausage no skins, comes like a jimmy dean sausage for a stuffing. I use Campbells beans I drain. I use three 11oz.cans. This is always a hit, I get people asking me to make this and it is always gone. Thank you for the recipe.  We do not have all the things on Long Island. God this is so great! Thank you!

These were very tasty. I substituted sausage for bacon and oh my was it nice! I didn't add the sugar because I thought it might be a bit too sweet, and they turned out rather spicy! Perhaps less chili powder next time.

These beans are excellent. They are kind of sweet but at the same time they have a great kick to them. The perfect balance between the two. Everyone loved these beans, which were rather easy to prepare, considering how good they tasted.

We thought this was pretty good but if I make this again I will leave out the vinegar and use tomato paste instead of ketchup to thicken it up a little, also think I will use little smokies instead of the sausage.

WOW, this was so easy and I was able to put it together from what I had at home.  I used Trader Joe's Baked Beans (liquid drained, though there wasn't much), Smoked Chicken and Turkey sausages (also from Trader Joes), I omitted the bell pepper because I didn't have one, I only used 1 Tablespoon of chili powder as mentioned by a previous reviewer, I only had 2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce left, I used Apple Cider Vinegar, Sucanat (Sugar Cane Natural), fruit-juice sweetened ketchup, and some hot sauce.  This is a super versatile recipe and I will definitely make it again!  This would be great for a potluck. THANK YOU.

This is now my husbands favorite baked beans.  He always raved over his mom's baked beans, but when I made these last week he said "These baked beans kick butt!"  I did make a few adjustments, since I made them for a cookout I used 2 cans of baked beans (bush's country style), 1 tbsp of chili powder, and only 2 tbsps of vinegar.  They were not too spicy, but had a nice kick to them.  They were a hit!

Great recipe.  Just the right amount of spice, sweet and sour.  I did take the cover off the last 20 min. or so and the dish was just the right consistancy.  Will make this often for our barbeques!  Thanks Daphne!

I made this recipe with a half-pound of ground turkey instead of sausage and it was excellent. I thought all that chili powder would make this dish too spicy, but it didn't. Be sure to use a big enough baking dish because it may boil over as it did for me. I will definitely make this again.
