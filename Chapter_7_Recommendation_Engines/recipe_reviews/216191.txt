OH MAN!! This is soooo good! I added the Lebanese 7 spices to the flour for fried chicken wings. I ate the WHOLE batch (8 wings). The only changes I made was to cut the quantity in half because I didn't want it to sit around too long. Also, by accident,  I added 1 Tbs more of the coriander than the recipe called for but I couldn't tell. Plus I love coriander.  Note, I marinaded the wings in olive oil, garlic and fresh lemon juice.  I might just make this again tomorrow!  Thanks!!

I do not understand the positive reviews. The amount of clove completely overpowers all the other flavors.
