This was recipe was great and simple! Happy to find a cookie recipe that doesn't require two sticks of butter!

Great recipe!  The dough is smooth and sticky.  I added a little oats, chocolate chips, and peanuts to mine.  Turned out great!

The first batch of these cookies were very light and fluffy, not the traditional  gooey peanut butter cookie (makes sense given the healthy swaps!). I also found the peanut flavour was quite light. I added an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the remaining half of the dough to make the cookies more dense and peanutty.
