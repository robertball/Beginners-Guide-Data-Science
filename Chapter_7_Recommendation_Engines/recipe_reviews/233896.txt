I have never been particularly impressed by fried green tomatoes, but I had some green tomatoes left over from my garden after a hard frost and hated to waste them.  I found this recipe to be fantastic.  My only concern was that duplicating it as written would have produced a dish with far more saturated fat than I was willing to accept (one serving of this side dish would have meant ingesting 50% more than the recommended daily allowance of saturated fat from the American Heart Association, even for healthy adults without heart problems).  I realize that this is not a diet dish, but a simple substitution resulted in 1/3 of the saturated fat, 1/2 the cholesterol, and still delicious flavor.  I substituted a 50-50 blend of olive oil and Smart Balance Buttery Spread with flaxseed oil, along with a cut from two eggs to one, resulting in a heart-healthy recipe without any apparent loss  of flavor.  I don't want to sound like a food Nazi, but there simply is no reason to cook the tomatoes in a cup of butter when there are much more healthful alternatives that do not mean giving up anything!  This recipe is a keeper.

NICE!  This is a very nice recipe for fried green tomatoes.  I mixed the sugar, salt, and pepper in a bowl then seasoned the tomatoes.  I would have liked to have seen the flour stick better to the tomatoes but it could have been the type tomato I used had a smoother skin.  This makes a nice side vegetable for seafood.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Brandilynn7!

Wow- these are delicious!  I left out the sugar, and subbed in 1/4 cup of cornmeal for the flour to give it some crunch.

This is an excellent recipe and definitely a keeper. The tomatoes are tangy, crunchy and slightly sweet from the sugar. I've been adding sugar (I normally use brown sugar instead of white) to my fried green tomatoes for years and was excited to find a recipe that had sugar in the ingredient list. However, I traditionally use bread crumbs (regular or Panko, whichever I have on hand) or flour and cornmeal. This time I decided to deviate from my normal pattern and use the flour with the egg/milk mixture this recipe calls for and I'm glad I did. The texture of the tomatoes is completely different and, since you're using just plain flour instead of seasoned bread crumbs, you're not masking the flavor of the tomatoes. This was full-fledged, pure tomato flavor. And they were delicious. I had to take a photo and post it because my tomatoes came out looking almost exactly like the tomatoes in the original photo.

Oh my gosh! I made this exactly as written, and it is so good. I wouldn't change a thing. I was looking for something like my Mom's.  This is it! Thank you!! Can't wait to make it again. P.S. my name is Karen - so this recipe was meant to be.

Delicious!  Just made these.  I never used the sugar before, but it was delicious and I think it complimented the tartness of the tomatoes.  In fact, it tasted almost like a green apple!  I used half-half butter and coconut oil.  The coconut oil I think contributed to the added flavor.  I will make these again!  Thanks!

The first time i have even tasted fried green tomatoes. We had some in the yard that the squirrels were stealing  so I decided to have a go. I'm so glad i did. These were so delicious we might have to buy  green   tomatoes to fry! The only change I made was to use panko for the final breading. Next time I will add more cayenne for a bit more heat. Thanks for the recipe.

Overall good recipe. I would have added more salt, suger, and pepper just for more flavor. I made 2 batches. 1st fried in butter. And 2nd in coconut oil which made if much lighter and tasted the tomato much more.

Oh Wow! Really good recipe! The only thing i added was some old bay for some kick and crushed sunflower seeds into the flour mixture for some crunch! Im sure the secret is the double dip :) 5 stars all the way!!

These are delicious! I used Panko instead of a double dip of flour and added chopped fresh basil to the Panko. They were crunchy and flavourful. I used half butter and half safflower oil to fry them. They turned out beautifully golden brown and the tomatoes were a perfect texture. Thanks for the recipe!

I had only three medium sized tomatoes. I used one egg and  about 1/2 cup of milk. One cup of flour. Did not use sugar. I seasoned the tomatoes with Jane's Salt and ground pepper . Followed recipe, but let the tomatoes sit after dipping in egg and flour for about 15 to 20 mins while waiting on the rest of my dinner to cook. Worked out well did not get soggy all. Fried in 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. Delish.  Will be making this again.

Very good recipe.  Read through the reviews  and modifications first.  Made a couple of my own, but stayed pretty true to the original recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Really good, and easy/quick. I found putting salt & pepper in the flour works best. I skip the sugar, green tomatoes are sweet by themselves.  5 stars from Sparks NV

I used coconut oil and they were great.  I  will bump up the sugar, salt and pepper next time and also decrease the egg and milk by half.  Lots of egg mixture left over, so just microwaved it and ate the scrambled eggs!

Yes, we loved the taste and texture.  I  will cut tomatoes in thinner slices next time due to too much water held in the  thicker ones.

Wow! I am new to the South and ordered fried green tomatoes at a restaurant, didn't think much of the dish. Today I had some nice green tomatoes and decided to look up a recipe and try it myself. The flavor is so good, buttery and just perfect. I was wondering if I needed ranch or something but that would ruin them. This recipe did not disappoint!
Thank you!

These were the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had! The only thing I did different is use 1/2 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 cup butter instead of the recommended full cup of butter and it made it taste so amazing!

Oh my! This recipe was amazing!! The only thing I did different was substitute 1/4c of the flour with cornmeal. The sugar gives it a nice hint of sweet. Will definitely be making this again.

For 2 tomatoes, I only needed half of the butter, eggs, milk and flour that was listed in the recipe. Eat immediately, while still crisp.

I made this exactly as the recipe says and it was excellent.  Some of the tomato slices needed a little salt at the table, depending on how well the original seasoning stuck to it.

I absolutely LOVED these. My first experience with fried green tomatoes. I did coat them in bread crumbs, deep fried them in oil, and sprinkled them with course salt after taking them from the fryer.

I made these tonight,  WOW, it reminded me of my Southern upbringing in OK... I didn't use butter, just margarine I had & added a small amount of Olive Oil  ... They brought me back to my ''childhood''... My Fiancee had never had FGT,  so he ate a few & liked them!!  Will make this again!!  I'm growing my own tomatoes, so they're really Fresh ''Off The Vine''... Yummy!!

These were delicious. That touch of sugar added a whole new twist. And since it's breaded in flour and not the traditional corn meal, you don't get that gritty texture (not that I don't like them made with cornmeal also), but this is definitely a nice change. Even my husband are them (he's the one who doesn't like cornmeal) and has asked me to make them again!

Easy to make, though I will probably bake next time, sort of a shake and bake.

I will definitely make it again.  I thought the butter was the key.
