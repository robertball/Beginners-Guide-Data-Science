First time eating a smoothie with a spoon but out of all the smoothies I've tried to date this has got to be one of my favorites! I used the frozen berries I had on hand and forgot to add the nuts for my picture (darn!). I did use a frozen banana too! This makes a VERY large bowl so you better be hungry or be prepared to share! Deliciousness!

Made this for my daughter who likes to have a different breakfast than just cereal. She really liked it.

It tastes decent but ended up being to runny.

Very yummy. My tween loved it. I'm going to make up a bunch and freeze individual servings for breakfasts/snacks. Next time I'll try freezing the bananas first.
