This was so easy and so GOOD!! I made it even easier by doing step 3 in the microwave instead of a double boiler--just combine the chocolate and cream and heat at 1-minute intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted. Also, I made this for Thanksgiving and my mom doesn't like to eat a lot of sugar, so I used unsweetened chocolate (good quality, of course, is key) and Splenda (probably about 1/3 C). It turned out great. Oh, and also I used a regular pastry pie crust instead of the cookie crust. I think it was definitely the way to go. The filling is so rich, I think the cookie crust would have been too much. I think this recipe will become a new holiday tradition. Thanks!!

I made the filling only as a chocolate mousse in wine glasses, topped with whipped cream. It set up beautifully adn everyone loved it, even the kids that had no idea what it was and were very nervous of trying it. I am definitely going to make this again, and will likely try it as a pie next time.

This recipe is so easy and very tasty.  I never review recipes, but this has been such a hit with my family and friends, I felt I must share.  Every special occassion someone asks me to make this pie.  I use ghirardelli chocolate and add just a touch of coffee to the chocolate when melting it.  Turns out perfect everytime!

Fabulous. A wonderful addition is espresso powder! Add it to the chocolate while melting (I used about a teaspoon)...it adds a little depth of flavor that is amazing to an already great recipe! I also HIGHLY suggest using chocolate in bar form (such as Ghiradelli), because it melts much better than chips. Not only does bar chocolate have more cocoa butter, causing it to melt better, but chips have additives that are there to help them hold their shape by raising their melting temperature (why they are perfect for chocolate chip cookies), making them not the best tasting chocolate for melting either- partly because of the additives and partly because chocolate flavonoids are highly volatile and the less heat chocolate is subjected to the better it will taste.

Oh my this is so good! I used the food processor method and this went together super fast. I did use chocolate grahams instead of the cookies. Also instead of white sugar I used powdered sugar. It mixes in much better with the heavy cream than regular sugar does. Came out perfect! Thanks.

I usually do not rate recipes on this site but I had to for this one.  Let me begin by saying that I am not a baker.  With this recipe, completed with no changes, it was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

Amazing amazing amazing!!!! I have made this 3 times already and I (and everyone else) love it! The chocolate does make a big difference on the end result. I was surprised that the kroger brand belgian chocolate chips were better than the ghiradelli. The last time I made it, I bought little mason jars and put a thin layer of crushed oreos in the bottom. I put the mousse on top, chilled them then put a little whipped topping and a pinch of dark chocolate shavings on top. It was a huge hit and they looked beautiful. This is my favorite dessert recipe by far, THANK YOU!!!!

The flavor was good, but to say this is rich is an understatement. You might as well eat a stick of butter. It actually made me feel sick, and I don't really have problems with food. I'd say either have a very tiny piece and walk away, or there are plenty of other recipes that can deliver flavor and texture without this nauseating level of fat.

AMAZING!  Instead of the Oreo crust, I took my favorite chocolate cake recipe, divided it into thirds, and baked in a 9-in round pan, which I cooled and put in the bottom of the springform pan.  My guests couldn't have eaten more than 1/12 of the cake/mousse.

This was very good. I was thinking it may be a "chocolate overload", given the name of the recipe. It's really just an egg-less, whipped chocolate cream pie. For me, it didn't have the density of a mousse, even after refrigerating overnight. I did follow the recipe exactly, and used high quality (Ghirardelli) chocolate chips. Very good, but not overly rich, if that's what you're looking for. It was easy, so I'd make it again if I needed a chocolate desert in a pinch.

this is my second time maing these.  used slightly more than half milk chocolate, the rest semi-sweet.  lined cupcake pans with papers.  filled each with about 1 tablespoon of the crust mixture, and divided the mousse into the cups (makes 24, or 12 for half the recipe).  nce set, piped a rosette of whipped cream on each and topped with chocolate shavings.  sets up great, and very cute.

I wanted to make a mousse that didn't take forever and use egg whites and gelatin ... (I know that sounds lazy ...) but this was just perfect and everyone loved it.  Wonderful, easy and tasty recipe!  :)  I highly recommend it.

This easy recipe worked very well for me - I wanted an egg-free mousse to pipe into dessert shot glasses for a wedding reception. 3 batches of this yielded enough for 150 3-oz shot glasses... a lovely presentation when topped with whipped cream and garnished with mini chocolate beads! What a hit! Since I had extra chocolate/cream, I made a pie to take to dinner with the fam. Unfortunately it only got to sit for 4 hours--I think it could've used the extra 2 hours and it would've set up even better. BUT it tasted darn good! I used a graham cracker crust, since it's what I had on hand, baking for about 10 minutes. A perfect go-to recipe for egg-free chocolate mousse!

This is my favorite dessert to bring to parties! It's easy and so, so good. I get compliments every time! At Christmas time, I like to add a couple of teaspoons of peppermint extract to the whipped cream that tops the pie and sprinkle crushed peppermint candies on top. I also use this chocolate mousse to fill and top cakes and other desserts, or just by itself!

Fantastic! I will probably make it in a 13x9 pan next time instead of a springform pan so I can cut it into smaller squares. I don't normally make my own cookie crusts but I had the Oreos so I made it in the food processor and kept it coarse - came out great. I used Ghirardelli chocolate. I used the second method for #3 but will probably make it in the microwave next time.

My husband made a request that I make chocolate mousse sometime in the week, so this is the recipe I came across.  And oh my gosh...he loved it!  It was so easy but really rich and airy.  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated, with no changes and it was fantastic.  I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate, since it has such a different (and better) flavor than Nestle morsels, so I would suggest that.  I may add a tablespoon or two of espresso the next time I make it, but just for experimentation's sake.  The recipe is great just as it is.

I thought this was absolutely wonderful. Simple to make and incredibly rich. 
I chose not to make a crust and served it in wine and martini glasses with the whipped cream and strawberries for Valentines day.

Excellent. These adaptations might help another Indian cook. For the base I used hide and seek - about 12 cookies was enough. I used choc chips from Nilgris and they tasted fine. I used Amul cream, but took a long while to whip. I used 3 cartons - one for melting and two for whipping to mix. I omitted the last cup for decoration - thought I will buy whipped cream in a can but didn't do that also in the end. I added a t-spoon of instant coffee to the chips while melting. Melted in the microwave.. melted in about 90 secs on high. Though it was a little wobbly when I put it in the fridge, it firmed up nicely when chilled. I put it in the fridge for 3 days before using it and it was excellent.

Super easy (I used the microwave for the heavy cream and choc. chips) and tastes delicious!  I made in a pie pan and had some leftover mousse for the family members that have to eat gluten free.  It was a hit with the kids and adults!

Deeeelicious!  Sinful!  Decadent!  Sometimes it is ok to relish in those things, and this dessert is one of those times.  :)  A very simple recipe.  The only things I did differently were instead of white sugar in the whipped cream portion, I used powdered sugar and cut it down to 1/8 cup, and skipped the whipped cream dollop on top.  This recipe contains enough cream already to increase cholesterol levels by 20 points in one sitting.  I had never made mousse before, but it won't be my last.  Thank you for this great recipe - it's going into my binder.  No baking (other than the crust), no eggs, no flour, and really no added sugars in the filling.

OH-MY-GOD! The name of this recipe really justify the result! This is highly recommended for the chocoholics who needs a satisfying chocholate fix! Please note that it is really advisable to include the whipped cream on top as it balances the very rich chocolate taste of this heavenly dessert!

Wow.....
This is really good. I didn't have the chocolate sandwich cookies, so I used Oreo cookies instead.  I don't recommend this, the crust was too hard.  Even with the tougher crust it was still a fabulous mousse.  It is so light you don't realize how rich it is until you go for seconds, and then blam!, you have a chocolate overdose experience....but it didn't stop me  :)

I just did this without the crust and not as much cream.  This recipe is great because if you use the food processor, it only takes a few minutes to prepare.  Very rich, so not much is needed to get rid of your sweet tooth.  I split this into 6 servings and topped with a little bit of whipped cream.

I used a ready made chocolate pie shell, but followed the recipe exactly aside from that.  My gosh it was FABULOUS!  I served it at Christmas dinner and people had second and third helpings of it.  It is incredibly rich, yet light.  My husband asked me to make it for his birthday next month instead of cake.

I decided to make this after all of the high reviews. I used a store bought crust and cooled the chocolate filling in the freezer for about 20 min. stirring every 5 minutes. I did this to save time, before I realized the pie needs to set up for 6 hours! Either way the title is very correct. This is the most chocolaty mousse I have ever tasted! I am guessing because it required a full bag of chocolate chips. The texture and taste is very chocolaty and very rich! But, I really liked that after the next day in the fridge I added the whipped cream it set up and sliced very nicely, a good change from most chocolate mousse pies. But, since this is so extremely rich, I could only eat about a 1/2 slice. So, this is definitely a special occasion treat.

Can I give this 10 stars?  First try, and it was a HUGE hit at a party!!!!!!!   If you give this less than 5 stars because you think it is chocolate overload or too rich, then you obviously didn't read the title!  I made the filling just as instructed, using Ghiradelli. I wouldn't double the crust as others suggested.  I added an extra 5 oreos and another tablespoon of butter. I only pressed it up the side of the pan about an inch and the thickness was perfect all around.  This will be my new solution to the question "Can you bring a dessert?"

Amazing chocolate mousse recipe. The only change I made to the recipe was that I also added espresso powder as other reviewers suggested. The mousse has such a wonderful texture, it is so rich and decadent. I have tried many other mousse recipes, and this is the most delicious recipe I have found. Thanks so much for the recipe. This will certainly be on the desert menu on Christmas this year.

slightly bitter for my taste which is probably explained because I added 1/4 cup of french roast coffee. but this tasted amazing paired with whipped cream and strawberries. with out the toppings though I would add a bit more sugar. I also used confectioner's sugar as recommended and got very smooth mousse.

Really delicious. I did as another reviewer suggested and baked a chocolate cake (I used chocolate oil cake on this site) as a base and layered the mousse on top. Really good, and looked very impressive! Really rich though; next time I'm going to bring it to somebody else's house to they can take care of the inevitable leftovers!

I made the mousse for this pie for a wine tasting party and paired it with a red moscato. This mousse is unbelievably good. It was the hit of the party! 

Since I don't have a food processor or double boiler, I microwaved the cream, chocolate, vanilla and salt on 70% power at one minute increments, mixing thoroughly after each minute. It worked great and was quick, even with the cheap store brand chocolate chips. Will be making again soon!

Good name and WOW was this good!  I made this just as a mousse (no crust) served in glasses.  Rum whipped cream was the topping with a sprinkle of cocoa.  The room grew quiet when everyone first tasted....and then the rave reviews started to flow.  Wonderful and easy.  I'll definitely make this again.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and only made the mousse part, and served in painted martini glasses (for our family BD dinner for my son). We all loved this, and yes it is rich. The food processor method is easy. Thanks for sharing a winner!

Yum, this is so decadent and delicious.  I used a prepared chocolate crust, and had enough mousse left over to fill four parfait cups.  I actually preferred the mousse on it's own, but the pie topped with whipped cream (and chocolate shavings!) was pretty darn good too.  This is incredibly rich, so some people had a hard time finishing their pie.  I used the food processor method, and it was so easy.

Made this for a fundraiser and got rave reviews.  Followed another reviewer's tip to add 1 tsp. instant coffee to deepen the flavor even more.  Skipped the oreo crust and used a ziploc bag to pipe the mousse into dessert cups (1 recipe makes 12 small portions).  Let them set overnight, then topped with whipped cream and mint shortbread leaves just before serving.

Fabulous! Made this for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it, along with my MIL, and 9yo daughter and niece and nephew.  I don't have a springform pan, so I used a square glass pan and it worked just fine. I also don't have a double boiler so I melted the chocolate in the microwave, 1 min on high, stir, then 30 seconds on 50%, stir after each 30 seconds until mixture is blended. Then follow rest of directions.  Very easy to make. I will definitely make this agin and again and again!

Simply to die for, but work intensive when you make your own caramel sauce, whipped cream, and pudding.  Hubby went over the edge!  AWESOME!  Since there are only two of us, I made 16 little bowls.  (Hubby can eat four in one sitting to my one, so next time, I will split into 3 big bowls and 4 little ones.)  Much better second and third day after the flavours have melded.  Thanks for an absolutely guilty pleasure!

This was GREAT!
I followed the recipe exactly, except I made a dozen 4 oz. cups lined with lady fingers. This recipe will make exactly a dozen, filled with mousse almost to the brim. 

I got the glass dishes at the Dollar Tree store (4 4-oz. dishes per pack - 25 cents each!). 

Lady fingers come in a flat of 12. They're already split lengthwise so I used one whole lady finger for each dish. I placed a half lady finger on the bottom and the other half I broke in half again (the short way) and propped each half against the half at the bottom. 

The completed mix pours nicely into the dishes and settles cleanly around the lady finger. The lady fingers don't absorb the mousse and will hold up, providing an added not-too-sweet texture to the dessert.

Also, I was short on time. I put the melted-chip mixture in the freezer and stirred often, until it got to room temp. The beaten cream folded in nicely. 

Once the mousse was poured into the dishes, I placed them all in the freezer again to set up. They were in for about an hour, with no harm to the mousse.

Transporting them was tricky: I have a cooler chest that is only the height of soda cans. I lined the bottom with freezer packs; placed a cookie sheet over the cold packs and placed a cut rubber mat (I had clean, anti-slip rug-mesh) on the bottom of the cookie tray. They stayed still through the drive and stayed cold for three more hours (when eaten). Everyone LOVED it!!

TEN STARS ********** OK, seriously the most amazing home made choc mousse EVER.  I made it for Thanksgiving and instead of a regular pie I made mini pies in mason jars.  For the crust I just put some Oreo cookie crumbs at the bottom of the jar and filled the jar with the mousse.  I let them sit overnight and they were PERFECT the next day (they were also amazing 3 days later).  I did add a little Starbucks Via powder (Christmas Blend) to the chocolate as it was melting....that is the only change I made.  D E L I S H and so easy.  OH, and I used the double boiler method with simmering water in a pot and a glass bowl on top (don't let the water touch the bowl, the bowl must sit an inch or so above the water).

THIS IS FANTASTIC! So simple to make, but its such a delicious and impressive dish. I also heated the choclate chips and cream together in 30 second intervals in the microwave making sure to stir after each round. I prefer 30 second intervals because you want to melt the chocolate slowly...once its scorched then the chocolate is ruined.  The second time I made it I added some fresh sliced strawberries onto the piped whipped cream. It made such a beautiful disdplay and added a little somethimg to the pallet to balance the cholcoate (dont get me wrong I loooove chocolate). Thanks so much for sharing!

Holy cow this was good.  Made this for party yesterday and the whole thing was gobbled up.  I think the addition of whipped cream on top is necessary when using semi-sweet chocolate. I took the advcie of another reviewer and used pie crust instead of cookie crust and loved that too.

This was too easy to be so delicious! I love chocolate and this had the perfect amount of flavor and richness for me (and everyone who tried it!). I made a homemade graham cracker pie crust instead of using a chocolate one as I thought that might be too much for our guests. The amount of chocolate filling was enough to fill 2 9-inch pie pans so I may cut the recipe in half next time. I did not have a double broiler so I just melted the chocolate in a pan on low heat and that worked great. The smooth, creamy texture just makes you want to savor every bite! This will be my go-to chocolate pie from now on!

I followed recipe exactly and I made some some whipped cream that was VERY lightly sweetened and it gave it the perfect taste. I'm a devoted chocolate lover and this is one I just can't stop talking and bragging about.  YUMMY!

The Oreo crust makes this recipe! Very rich (as mousse should be) and really just irresistible.  Great classic dessert to share after a meal.

I have made this several times. It is awesome!!! I have even made it as a white moose ( used vanilla Oreo's and white choc chips). I am no fan of white choc but my husband and kids loved it more than the choc one. I think I may try adding Kahlua to the recipe next time..hmmmm

incredibly delicious.  I made this for Canadian thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. a couple of weeks later I made six more for an event (let me note it was for 50 teenagers) they ALL adored it, so if it is good for 50 teenagers i think it is good for anyone. I am going to experiment with layering raspberries into it, chocolate and raspberries has got to be the best combo ever!

I made this for thanksgiving. I followed the recipe as written, using ghiradelli milk chocolate chips. It came out great, and was the only dessert completely gone at the end of the night. Will definitely make this again!

I used a 9.5" spring form pan, using 5 additional Oreos.  I used milk chocolate chips.  I took this to a potluck at work where it was a huge hit.  It's even yummier with a cup of coffee.  We didn't find it to be too dense.  Possibly because of the milk chocolate?  It was perfect! Can't wait for another occasion to make it.

Perfect Recipe! Served this as our Memorial Day dessert and we loved every bite! Followed it exactly and will make this one again. The taste and texture is wonderful. My son's birthday is next week and he has decided that this is his choice for his "cake". Thanks for sharing!

Wow. This was awesome, decadent, and easy!!! It was made for chocolate lovers. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet morsels and the chocolate flavor was intense and satisfying! I made the mousse filling and put it in glasses (scrapped the pie idea because I wanted individual "servings") and topped with fresh made whipped cream. WONDERFUL DISH! I had requests for the recipe. Will certainly keep this recipe handy.

Used the food processor method. Turned out great. I used semisweet chocolate chips. Next time I will try milk chocolate. Overall easy recipe, I had it put together and in the fridge within 20 minutes! Thanks for sharing!

I just made this for my father... Will deliver tomorrow...It actually filled two store bought deep dish pie shells (buttered them and baked at 375 for 15 minutes).  Added about 1/4 Cup of Torani's Hazelnut syrup to the melting chocolate mixture.  You must have patience when making the whipped cream.  If you don't have nice peaks it won't set up when you introduce the chocolate mixture.  But I dont' have the patience to make the whipped cream for the topping...(Redi Whip to the rescue).  Next time will top with some candied pecans and drizzle with some cararmel and chocolate sauce. It's a keeper.

I agree with some other reviews that this is not really a mousse texture but it is still an excellent eggless dessert.  Was very easy to make.  I followed the suggestion to do step 3 in a microwave which makes it completely hasslefree. I added a teaspoon of instant coffee powder to the chocolate mix when I made it the 2nd time which made it really 'wow' Also worked great as a layer between chocolate cake.

This recipe is very good, but also quite rich.  I doubled the cookie crust based on others' comments and it was a bit too thick, so I think 1 1/2 times the crust recipe would've been best.  I flavored the whipped cream topping with 4 Tablespoons of Hazelnut Kahlua liqeur and reduced the sugar to 2 Tablespoons -- came out great.  I topped it with fresh raspberries and lightly toased, finely chopped pecans.  It wowed my guests.  I will definitely make this again.  This dessert tastes best when served closer to room temp (but still slightly chilled) -- the texture is more creamy and silky.  (You can also find this recipe on epicurious.com -- it's called "chocolate mousse pie.")

This was Great! I made it exactly as directed for the mouse. The crust, I bought a pre-made one to save some stress planning Christmas dinner. Oreo crust made it taste fantastic! I also split it into two different crusts so that one slice wasn't too big. I froze the second one and it defrosted great.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Very chocolaty & rich, yet still light & fluffy.  Also, very easy to make.  My 9 year old son picked this to make for dessert on the night he was in charge of making dinner & he needed minimal help from me.  We skipped the homemade whipped cream for on top & just used spray whipped cream from a can - had to cut calories somewhere!  May try it with mint Oreos for the crust next time & if I can find them, dark chocolate Hershey chips.

Well as you can see, I skipped steps 1&2. Here's what I did. Blow up about 8 water balloons, set aside. Melt a package of good quality chips, I used dark chocolate. I also used a cereal type bowl, and melted them in the microwave. When chocolate is smooth, dip balloons into it, swirling them around a bit to make sides even. Place on parchment paper covered tray. The balloons will stand. Place in frig until you're mousse is made. When your mousse is prepared, pop balloons, pipe mousse into bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve. Garnish with fresh whipped cream. BIG HIT!

This recipe was absolutely to die for! Everybody loved it.
I have a few tips. First, I used a pre-made oreo cookie crust. This saves you the work of making a crust yourself and also lets you throw the pan away when the pie is gone (which will probably be very quickly!)
Second, I used the food processor method to make the chocolate mixture. This worked perfectly. The chocolate was creamy and silky smooth with absolutely no lumps.
Finally, the pie filling is essentially just a delicious, creamy chocolate mousse. It was fantastic even by itself, so I just put some of the mousse filling aside in a little disposable pie pan for those who were gluten-free. They were thrilled. 
I am definitely making this recipe again. My only disappointment was that I didn't make more!

Good, but what a mess it was to make! If I do it again, I'll make it in a pie plate, rather than a springform pan. It leaked out everywhere!

This is so decadent! Do Not defile this master piece with Oreos, there is a simple delicious chocolate crust recipe on Allrecipies called Mock Chocolate Cookie Crust. I do not have a double boiler so I sat a glass bowl on top of a sauce pot, stuck a spoon in between the two to vent and tada! Piping on the whipped cream makes a huge difference, it makes the look match the taste!

WOW! I am not a big chocolate fan...the rest of the family is so I made this for them. It is VERY rich and it only takes a sliver to satisfy. The recipe is straight forward and quite easy. I used the boiling cream into the food processor method simple and efficient. The melted chocolate mixture cooled to room temp. quickly this way. The hardest part is allowing it to cool 6 hrs. I don't always plan that far ahead. All in all... a delicious and elegant dessert. Would serve on special occasions too! Enjoy! Thanks DEME for sharing!

This is the best of the many chocolate rehilcipes I've ever made.  I changed nothing.
I served it to out of town guests and they
gave it raves.  I froze a small portion and 
it was just as good as the original.  Thanks!

I've used this site for years, but this is my first review.  I'm not much on making desserts, as I get more pleasure from preparing savory vegetables, meats, pasta dishes & soups.  I planned a menu for judges at a music competition and chose this as one of the desserts.  Per other reviews, I used powdered sugar and IT WAS FABULOUS!  So good in fact, that I made another one last night - There was only one small piece left after the competition for me to try :)  The second time I used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 dark chocolate chips=Yum Yum!  I'll try adding some espresso next time, as I love chocolate and coffee together.  BTW-store bought chocolate crust is plenty good with such a rich filling and saves on preparation time!

This is the only chocolate pie I will ever make, from now on!!  I had chocolate mousse 25 years ago, prepared by a friend that is a professional chef in NYC.  I have tried since then to duplicate it.  This is it!!!!  It's worth the indulgence, believe me, you don't want to miss out on making this.  I did use a pre-made chocolate graham cracker crust.  The mousse can stand on it's own, however, if you prefer to skip the crust.  I bake a LOT of pies, and this is my all-time favorite, hand's down!

The crowd favorite! So easy to make, yet so delicious. I added about 1/4 cup of espresso to the chocolate while it was melting to give it that extra "punch." This will definitely remain in my top 5 "Go-To Desserts" list.

I hate chocolate mousse in general- but my daughter and honey love it. Well, I actually like this mousse... It is delicious- Try it, and you'll love it too :) Rich and flavorful, it disappears so fast your head may spin!

Oh my God this recipe is divine for any chocolate lover.  It is so easy to make and doesn't take much time at all.  The only problem is that it may live up to its name because it is really rich.

Really good if you are a chocolate lover, I made mine with half semi sweet and half milk chocolate chips. I used the food processor method and I thought it was a little messy. Next time I am going to use the microwave method. My son took part of it home and put it in the freezer and said it was really good as a frozen dessert.

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert, and my family went nuts over it.  I have a feeling I'll be making this over and over again.  I used the food processor method, which was great, because me and double-boilers don't get along!

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe. It was pretty simple to make. I didn't have a double boiler or a food processor so I just used a regular saucepan over very low heat and it turned out great! This is definitely for special occasions only at our house...it is very rich but oh so delicious! ;)

This is so rich.  About a quarter of an inch slice is about as much as anyone could eat at once.  Next time I am going to try a semi sweet, milk chocolate mixture.  Or even all milk chocolate.

I'm not a baker nor do I make many desserts but my husband has been asking me to make chocolate mousse for his birthday for years. I finally used this recipe this past weekend.  We had people over on Sunday do I adjusted the servings for 14 and made this cake using the recipe to key.  It was incredible. Absolutley incredible. I got so many compliments on it that night. A+

WONDERFUL! However I didn't make the oreo crust because it sounded like over-kill. I tried it twice once with gheridelli chocolate and once with hershy's and gheridelli was much better!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be chocolate fluid! Very tasty chocolate fluid, but not having the consistency of mousse at all! I don't think I will be making this again...

This is incredibly good!
It's rich, but I really didn't think it was overwhelmingly so.
I had oohs and ahhhs when I served it to family members at our father's day parties (on two different occassions).
I did the recipe exactly as written, too.

This mousse/tarte is crazy-delicious and looks as good as it tastes.  My husband is a dessert-aholic and he adored this, as did our dinner guests.  Because we like things sweet, I added an additional quarter cup of powdered sugar to the mousse, and the Oreo bottom crust was perfection in this.  Few ingredients, minimal preparation, yet sinfully rich, this is a dessert I’ll be making again and again.

Easy to make. I was disappointed with the ratio of chocolate to cream; the picture is a bit misleading, this doesn’t come out a dark, delicious brown, it’s just a bunch of cream with a slightly chocolaty taste.

Everyone raved over this.  I cheated and used an oreo cookie premade crust.  I also followed other reviewers suggestions about microwave melting the chocolate and cream together at 1 minute intervals.  Also used powdered sugar in place of regular sugar since it blends better with cream.   This worked well and was easy to do!

Omg, it was so good!  I was lazy and used a pre-made crust and topped it with cool whip, but it was still delicious!  Everyone fought over who got to take the leftovers home.  I've used a different recipe from this website for a chocolate pie several times, but I happened upon this one, and decided to use it instead.  It's so much better.  I didn't realize it was so easy to make chocolate mousse.  The recipe made more than what would fit in the pie crust, and I didn't know what to do with the extra...yeah, I ended up just eating it from a bowl with a spoon because it was so yummy.   Definitely making it again for the next get together with friends or family.   Btw, I didn't use a double boiler, I just melted the chocolate with the cream in a pot on the stove on low heat, and it turned out fine.

Great - was concerned that the filling was a touch runny, so added some chocolate pudding (1/2 a pkg) to the filling.  Turned out nicely.

Made this for Thanksgiving. So easy, and people thought it must have been hard to make! If you like dark chocolate, this recipe is foolproof just as written.

This is an excellent egg free mousse. I used it to fill a Yule log and I was looking for an eggless recipe because I was concerned about my young nieces eating raw eggs. This was the perfect mousse. It's rich, descendant and easy to make. I didn't make the crust but stayed true to the mousse recipe and it was amazing, everyone loved it. It's a keeper.

This is completely fool proof!! I recommend melting the buter for the crust, but it works well either way. i do think it comes out better when you use the food processor.Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I make a crust out of brownies and then put the chocolate mousse on top.  It's amazing.  Way too many calories for every day.  I only make it around the holidays.

This was such a HUGE success at my pre-Christmas dinner party, I'm making it again tonight for Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow. I followed the recipe as-is and it came out fantastic. I was wondering how the center cream in the Oreos would work in the cookie crust, and it tasted amazing! So totally yummy.

When I make this I use bittersweet chocolate and also make a second ganache to use as a layer on top of the mousse. Then I spread the whipped cream over the top of the ganache layer. Everyone loves it and it was requested by my friend months ago that I make it for his birthday in December.

This cake didn't have the 'wow factor' that I was hoping for. I found it to be rather plain and very creamy. I ate one small slice and it was filling (I didn't crave for seconds). After reading some reviews, instant espresso or coffee would help deepen the chocolate flavour. Dark chocolate might also work better than semisweet. Unfortunately, I won't be making this again. Sorry.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  It is now one of my go-to recipes for chocolate lovers.  Have been making it for several years now.  Even better, it's SO easy!  I have even used this to layer in between chocolate cake for an even chocolatier dessert.  Yum!  Thank you for sharing!

I mixed things up a bit....I didn't bake the cookie crust because my original recipe doesn't call for it to be baked. I used the food processor method but microwaved the cream until it almost came to a boil...I didn't add the additional sugar because my original recipe didn't call for it and I put it into the freezer for 3 hours and it turned out wonderful.

Very delicious! I made it for my dad for Father's Day. I cut him a tiny piece for dessert, and he said "that's all I get?!" I told him he could have more afterwards... He barely finished his slice. I asked him if he wanted more, and he sheepishly said no. It is a VERY rich cake, so it will serve many people.

Wow, this mousse is awesome, so rich and decadent, but so easy too!  I totally cut out the crust as I didn't want it and just put the mousse into individual serving dishes.  It was much easier and the mousse set up much faster that way.  I also added a little bit of instant French vanilla pudding mix to the whipped cream to stabilize it and it gave it such an amazing flavor!  But don't eat too much of the mousse as it is crazy rich, certainly lives up to its name!  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Everyone thought I bought it for my husband’s birthday it looked and tasted so good! My husband says it’s the best pie/cake he’s ever had! He keeps telling me to make it again! 

My recipe tid-bits:  
I swapped the regular sugar for powdered sugar for the last cup of cream that is used on top to decorate the pie. 
Also I used more cookies and more butter because I wanted a little thicker crust layer. It lasted in the fridge great for a week. 
Make sure to keep it in the refrigerator when not being eaten or else it melts.

Absolutely decadent. Made with a chocolate graham cracker crust but is delicious just as a mousse. Served with strawberries on top. Restaurant quality good.

Made a second time with Nestle Chocolate Chips and it was not near as good. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips. It's worth the extra $2!!

This came out delicious and everyone is asking for the recipe. Only added a layer of raspberry filling to the bottom (1/4c sugar, 1T cornstarch, 2t water; 2c fresh raspberries over med heat x 5 min, add 1/4 t almond extract at end, remove from heat cool then chill). Really gave the pie the perfect touch and broke up the sweetness perfectly!

Pretty modest changes.... I used 1 c half and half in the heated mixture, bittersweet chocolate bar rather than choc chips,  just a dash of decaf instant coffee crystals, and a graham cracker crust rather than oreo crust.  It was OUTSTANDING!!

I made this taking another readers suggestion to add 1 tsp. of Espresso Coffee granules - it amped up the flavor a lot!  Unfortunately I didn't have enough whipping cream for the topping but I used a think layer of cool-whip (I know - yuck - I don't even know why I had it in the freezer) but I sprinkled the top with crushed toffee - which turned out really good.  I had 2 graham cracker crusts I needed to use up so I put the filling in them - there was enough for 2 pies!  Hubby though he died and went to heaven!  LOL  Thanks DEME for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe, it was rich and smooth.  Melts in your mouth.  My family weren't as big of fans as I was.  I followed the recipe as followed, except I used a couple of ready made  chocolate wafer pie crusts in place of the crust on the recipe.
Very good, but I don't see myself making it very often due to my family.  Thanks for the recipe, I had always wanted to make homemade mousse and the recipe was a lot easier than I expected.

If you love chocolate pie, this is a winner for sure!  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust, which added even more chocolate, and I made a homemade whipped cream topping using the heavy whipping cream. The only thing I forgot was to take a picture, but I will definitely be making this another time, so will get a picture then.  
Simply scrumdeliumtious!

Wow! This came out perfect. I didn't make whip cream for the pie's topping, I just used Reddi wip. Also, I didn't have any Oreo cookies, but I did have two pre-made Oreo pie crusts. I crushed both pie crusts, mixed the crumbs with the softened 1/4 c of butter and pressed the crumbs onto the bottom of my spring-form pan. Everyone loved it!

Definitely a keeper! I made this for my daughter's birthday and she loved it.  Some of my chocolate chips didn't completely melt, leaving little bits of chocolate which made it even yummier!!  I have to admit it was a step by step process but well worth it!

I absolutely love this recipe. With the heavy whipping cream, I did use powdered sugar instead of regular sugar and added about a tsp of vanilla extract to the cream as well. A nice but balanced whip. Not overly sweet with a hint of vanilla. It blended nicely with the chocolate and had me wanting to make it again. Thank you

I used a darker chocolate chip, and this made the dessert richer.  Otherwise it is too "milk chocolate" for my taste.

This was a big hit at our family dinner! It was a really effortlessly beautiful dish. And I don't think I've ever seen my husband have seconds of dessert before! I prefer a taller pie, so I used an 8 inch springform pan. Since the mousse already uses so much  cream, I piled shaved white chocolate over the pie instead of whipped cream.

I made this recipe as is. It is indeed very good. Very light in texture. I would definitely make this again hands down. However, I think it is a bit too sweet. Therefore, my 4 stars rating.  I think it might be the semi-sweet chocolate or the chocolate cookies I  used for the bottom. Next time, I might switch both for the less sweet kind. Who knows it is a matter of exploring the recipe to find the "sweet spot" that hits my preference.  For those complain about this recipe of being "nauseating and greasy". Mousse is grease with air incorporated through the beating process. If you do not like grease try cake instead or something else. Don't attempt to eat mousse. Tip: Mousse is best enjoyed in small portions never in huge slices or huge serving glasses. Use a hot knife when cutting the slices.

We used 2 Nabisco chocolate pie crust crushed and used the same amount of butter and it seemed to work. The whole family loves it! We’re going to try to use the Oreo cookies next. I’m guessing that the pie crust may be a little thicker than the cookie will repost once made.

Very rich mouse pie, really taste like dark chocolate. You will need the extra whip cream to cut back the chocolate taste. Will be making again May try sweet chocolate. Four star because not everyone was in love with this pie.

I'm gluten free, so I couldn't eat the crust. Instead I just made the mousse, it was amazing! Will definitely be making this again!

My book club loved it. Next time I will not use the food processor and will make it on the stove. It will be creamier that way, but it was delicious and will definitely make again.

Fantastic!  Made this for my daughter's birthday.  Used the milk chocolate chips.  Did not use whipped cream as a topping -- seemed like there was enough cream already.  It was a big hit!  Will make again.

This was wonderful and so easy.  I made it even easier by using a prepared shortbread crust.  I also used half dark chocolate chips and half semi sweet chocolate chips.

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it!  It had a good chocolate flavor but didn’t seem too heavy.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 1 tsp of instant coffee to the chocolate mixture and used  the microwave for step 3, as suggested by other reviewers.  This was delicious and simple to make.  I’ll definitely make it again.

This was really good. Very rich but good. I used the Ghiradelli brand chocolate. Didn’t change anything. I used my regular pie dough and not the cookie crust. Whipped cream was the best! Not my favorite chocolate pie but it was still very good and worth making.

I made this for thanksgiving dessert and it was amazing! Very rich and dark chocolatey tasting. I made in a pie plate because I didn't have a springform pan, but that's the only thing I changed. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! It was a hit with us chocolate lovers!

The chocolate is rich but extremely light and fluffy. This recipe makes enough to fill TWO of the store bought Oreo pie crusts and/or graham cracker crusts.

This recipe is perfect!  I made it with no changes and it is divine.  My kid has been requesting this as her birthday cake since she was 8, and I am happy to oblige.  Helpful tip  - pick up an extra container of whipping cream so you can make more topping!

I cut the recipe in half. I did not alter the recipe for the center and it turned out perfect! 
 I did buy an Oreo pie crust which worked out great.

I used Ghirardelli chocolate chips and I really regretted it.  I'd make this again but I'd use regular semisweet chocolate.  Also, I misunderstood the recipe and used Fudgee-O cookies.  After reading other comments it seems like I should have used Oreos.  I would try this with a shortbread or graham cracker crust instead of a chocolate flavor one.  This would also be good for parfaits instead.  I used whipping cream because it was the heaviest cream available.

So rich and decadent! And it slices and serves beautifully. I made the total rookie mistake of not completely combining the chocolate and whipped cream, so I ended up with some white streaks throughout my mousse but I think that actually made it prettier!

I made just the mousse part and it was great! I made chocolate cups and placed the mousse in and decorated it. I will say the semi sweet chocolate was too bitter for my taste, I'll try milk chocolate next time.

This was my first attempt at mousse, and I chose this one to avoid using raw eggs like in many other recipes. I changed nothing and it turned out wonderfully, and was way easier than I expected. I made just the mousse this time but next time will definitely make the pie - the added texture of the cookie crust would be amazing!

Super easy to make. I used Famous Chocolate Wafer Cookies instead of Oreos, required 25 cookies and a touch more butter, maybe a teaspoon, for the crust. Easy to make, came out perfect and not gritty, I sprinkled cocoa powder and cinnamon over the whipped topping for that decadent rich taste.

I was just looking for a quick mousse recipe and it turned out great. The recipe (mousse part only) calls for 3 cups of heavy cream but I  only had 2 cups so I subbed in 1 cup cereal cream to melt with the chocolate. Finished product was delicious and had a smooth & silky texture. Would definitely make again. :)

I subbed gluten free sandwich cookies instead of regular chocolate sandwich cookies for some gluten free guests. I also added about 1/2 cup of cold coffee and caramel flavored vodka to the filling and about a Tb of each to the reserved whipped cream. It was delicious and very easy to make.

Didn't have a spring form pan, so I used extra oreos and made a full chocolate crumb pie crust. USED the microwave method, but would stir every 30 seconds once we were getting close to melted. Didn't want the chocolate to break. This was phenomenally delicious, and I orally don't like rich chocolate stuff. the ores and whipped cream topping were a perfect balance to the dark chocolate. This is going in my recipe bible!

The only change I would recommend is that if you are using Oreos for your crust, you won't need an entire stick of butter. I softened a stick but then blended in a little at a time and probably only ended up using about 3 tbs. baking the crust allows it to hold together quite nicely and 5 minutes is the perfect amount of time. I also followed 2 review suggestions. I used high quality bar chocolate (Trader Joe's dark chocolate) and espresso powder (Starbucks Via). I dissolved about a half packet of Via in a small amount of the cream and added it to the melted chocolate mixture. This is a wonderful recipe.

So easy to make. I make it every special occasion. The only thing I changed was using heavy whipping cream instead of the heavy cream. Very rich and just melts in your mouth.

I didn't make the dessert, but I did make the mousse to use for filling in another cake.  Let me just say that everyone loved it! I did too.  Easy...yummy...easy...   (Also, I cheated by using the microwave instead of a double-boiler, so much easier!)

This recipe was amazing. So mine doesn't look too pretty (have to work on making the crust look better.)
I used milk chocolate chips instead, and it was perfect!

I made the chocolate mousse and instead of putting it into a pie crust I put them into individual serving cups. It was SOOOO DELICIOUS and the hit of party!

So delicious and so easy! I used a premade cookie crust to make it easier. I'll definitely make this again and I think I'll try doing the mousse in single servings cups for a change. So worth making!

Delicious! This is a great recipe, easy, quick and a real hit at the dinner party I took it too. I think by itself it is a bit too rich so I served it with a strawberry sauce and fresh raspberries as well as cream. Don't give make the serving size too big as it is very rich!

Made it just like recipe instructions read. It was super sweet and chocolatey. I'll have to cut out the most of the sugar and not pour in the whole bag of morsels next time. I think it tasted great after two days in the fridge. I'll definitely make it again.

Made it yesterday for Easter and they love it !  I put the bowl that I will use in the fridge to ccol it before I put on the heavy whipping cream. I added 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to the cream before I beat it,  and used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar.  I put the finish product to freezer for 3 hrs and, took it out 1/2  hr before serving and it was perfect. Will make it again.

Made this for Easter and a chocolate lovers birthday.  Very good flavor and easy to put together. I used the food processor method to melt the chocolate and it turned out perfectly smooth and much easier than the stovetop method.

I've made this a few times. Once, I replaced semi-sweet chocolate with milk chocolate, put it on top of cake and it tastes like a 3 musketeers. Today, I made it with frozen whipped topping, instead of homemade. Still great. :) and doing it that way only takes 3 minutes, start to finish. All around, this is a FANTASTIC, decadent, delicious dessert. Looks hard. Isn't. Absolutely wonderful.

This was very delicious and very easy to make. Instead of regular Oreo's, I used Mint Oreo's...it was a big hit at my Christmas party! It was just the right amount of mint. The chocolate was not as dark as it is in this picture, but it was still delicious!

This was amazing!  I known for being terrible in the kitchen, but now my family thinks I've just been holding out on them all these years!  This pie was so good.  I didn't have a double broiler, so I just carefully melted the chocolate on the stove...not even I could mess this up!

I made this twice during the holiday season. I'm not sure why, but the first attempt turned out much denser than the second. Maybe I didn't beat the cream enough the first time? In any case, even though the consistency was different, it was delicious both ways!

Good recipe and very easy to make. I used the food processor for the chocolate and a pre made chocolate pie shell.  You can find oreo pie shells too.  The only real change I made was to add some coffee. The hubby and I ate the whole pie in a matter of days.  This is the easiest mousse recipe I have found without eggs.

I just made this this evening. Followed the instructions exactly, and while I haven't had the pie yet, I had a little extra and put it in a wine glass.  The mousse is soooooo delicious, so I can't imagine that the pie won't be as well.  I used the cookie crust. 

Thanks for the recipe, I suspect this will be a hit on Thanksgiving!

I only made the mousse part, and it was out of this world! When melting the chocolate with heavy cream, I added half the sugar, a little salt, and half a tsp of instant coffee granules. I whipped the rest of the cream with the other half of sugar, then folded the two together until the color was uniform. 100% making this again, and I'm sure it'd be absolutely decadent with the cookie crust.

Delicious! Amazing mousse consistency too. I halved the recipe (and it served 8) and added about a tsp of instant coffee, otherwise I left it all the same. SO good. Thank you!

I made this for  my niece and found it to be so easy. I used the  microwave  to melt the  chocolate  and had to whip cream by hand. She loved it and her hubby. I will be doing this again really  soon for them to feature  in their cafe. Thanks

Great taste, nice texture and really rich.  BUT, don't do what I did - once crust was out of oven (5 minutes only per other reviews), I thought I'd "double-chocolate-death" it by putting a layer of chocolate chips on top of crust, letting them melt and then spreading it around.  I was so proud of myself until after I put mousse on top and refrigerated for 24 hours.  When I tried to cut it, it was almost impossible to get a knife through the soft mousse and hard chocolate (and then crust) without getting cut pieces really messy. Next time, I will go with recipe as written - I really didn't need that much more of a chocolate fix. I wonder if I had frozen the whole thing if it would have been so messy...   Now that I've tried this recipe, I agree with those who put in cups or glasses (no crust).  It would make a really nice presentation with just a slightly different "feel".  I also used one tsp. dry coffee - can't do a comparison but did not seem to detract from recipe.

Yum yum yum! I love chocolate mousse and this recipe was so easy and delicious. The only change I made was substituting the sugar for honey because I'm just starting to try using natural sweetners in recipes. Turned out perfect.
