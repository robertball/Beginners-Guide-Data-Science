Definitely will make it again!!!  I added a little over 1/2 cup real maple syrup instead of the white sugar and adjusted the milk to compensate

This made a tasty side dish, not too sweet and the addition of the pecans and coconut added a nice crunch.

We love this recipe and my men in law all love it. The only change I make is to omit the coconut.  It's not overly sweet, our comfort food.

made this for Christmas dinner. It was super easy to make and everyone loved it, but you must love coconut.  I thought it was a little too sweet, and when I make it again I will omit the white sugar and see if that helps. I might also add extra pecans because we loved the crunchiness!
