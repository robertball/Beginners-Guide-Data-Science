I made this recipe with some slight alterations to save time and it is GREAT!!! #1, for the filling I only buy 1# of hot sausage and cut it in half while still in the package and I freeze the other half in a ziplock bag for next time. Next I add 1 egg, 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, and a cup of breadcrumbs. 
This much stuffing will fill about a dozen medium sized peppers. The recipe's filling is for WAY more than 8 peppers, so it's better to cut it in half. I still clean and boil the pebbers for 5 minutes and once they're stuffed, I put them in a casserole dish and cover them with purchased spaghetti sauce and bake. When done I cover with shredded mozzarella cheese. It's WONDERFUL!

I'm pleased to report I've tried this recipe and made with only a few changes.  Since I had a lot of garden tomatoes, those were used rather than the canned.  I added approx. 2 tbs. sugar to the tomatoes.  Also, after baking approx. 40 minutues I covered with shredded mozarella then continued baking.  Before I bake this next time, I'll try cooking the sausage first and delete the grease that accumulates in the dish after baking.  This, of course, will require less baking time.  I'll also add some Italian Seasoning to the tomato sauce mixture.  This is a keeper.

The flavor was delicious and this is a terrific way to use up the peppers from the garden.  Note that this recipe calls for entirely too much filling for 8 banana peppers.  I halfed the filling recipe and still had about a cup left over.

I should first start by saying it is extremely disappointing to choose a highly rated recipe from this site and run into an issue while cooking only to go back and find most reviewers found the very same problem with the recipe and.... went ahead rated it well anyway.  I don't always have time to read all the reviews.  I am giving this one star because I found, like most, that you only need half the filling that this recipe calls for.  And you do not need to go through the tough work of parboiling the peppers.  Just stuff them raw.  Too many bread crumbs in the filling.  Otherwise, sauce is great.

Last year, I planted what I thought were green bell peppers (they were mis-labeled).  When these banana peppers grew (and I had lots!!!), I had to start searching for recipes.  Decided to try this one.  I made this recipe last year and just finished up the leftovers that were in the freezer.  Very delicious!!!   Anyway, this year I planted banana peppers on purpose so that I can make this dish again.  I found that I had too much sausage mixture and used it to make meatballs, so this time I'll half the sausage.

This is a great recipe, but it does make a lot of peppers.  I made 28 from the recipe!  I was making these for a trial run before I made them for a family get together and ended up only having to make 1 batch.  Because of the huge amount of peppers I had to make extra of the sauce mixture.  Watch the salt in the sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons does make it taste salty.  I actually ended up using my own sauce to top the peppers with because of how salty it tasted to me, but otherwise they were a hit. I also topped with some grated romano cheese and shredded mozzarella the last 10 mins of baking. I will definitely be making these again.  Also since the recipe made so many peppers I had to freeze some before I could use them for my party.  They froze well.  I was actually thinking of buying more peppers now, while they are on sale, and making another batch and freezing them for later use.

Thanks to all who have rated this recipe. We do use the HOT variety of peppers for this recipe and yes they are too hot for me but my hubby and neighbors love them hot.  We buy the HOT hungarian wax peppers at the farmers market for these (by the case load I might add) As some of you already know, when you submit a recipe, allrecipes.com tests it and alters it to the way they find it will best perform. So if there is a lot of extra filling for the peppers, that is why. Again thanks to all that have tried and taken the time to review the recipe. Buono Mangia

My family loved this recipe.  This was my first time using peppers and I won't soon forget it (did not wear gloves because my neighbor told me they weren't hot)!! Make sure to wear GLOVES removing the seeds!! I halved the recipe and used 6 larger sized peppers.  I par boiled for 3 minutes before filling. There is wayyy too much filling as many reviewers have stated.  For presentation, I did not cut the tops off, but cut lengthwise and removed a small amount of pepper and seeds.  My kids were eating these so I used a country sausage and ground chuck mixture.  I subbed onion powder in place of the onion.  I will make again since we have a ton of peppers.

Super delicious. I altered the recipe and used regular pork sausage and ground beef to tame it a bit for my family. I also filled to bell peppers that I needed to use up with the left-over filling.  I will be making this one again!

Very good. I used Hot Hungarian Wax Peppers (sometimes called Hot Banana Peppers) instead. Also, to cut down on fat, I used turkey sausage. I cut the recipe for the filling in half and just used 1# of sausage. With the hot peppers, I found you did not need the hot sausage as well. I didn't have regular bread crumbs on hand so I used a mix of cut up wheat bread and Italian stuffing mix. I also added slices of Monterey Jack cheese over the peppers during the last 10 mins of cooking. Next time I will add a little more tomato sauce during the last 20 mins or so to make it a bit more moist.  If in a time crunch, you can always use ready made spagetti sauce instead of making it yourself. Even with cutting the filling recipe in half, I still had some left over.  If you use a cake decorating bag to stuff the peppers, use a rounded tip of some sort - this helps you get the filling all the way down into the bottom of the peppers if you have small to medium sized peppers.

Excellent stuffed peppers! I ended up with way more filling than 8 banana peppers could hold, so I added a couple of red bell peppers to the pan to hold the excess. All were deeelicious! I used 1 lb. hot Italian sausage mixed with 1 lb. ground sirloin... other than that I followed it as stated. OH, except for step one... I skipped it. There's really no need to boil the peppers because 1 hour in the oven is more than enough cooking time. A big thanks to Bob for coming up with this one!

I followed this recipe to the letter, save for the sausage part. I don't like Italian sausage (no offense to Bob!) so I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage instead.

It turned out so great! Banana peppers are one of my favorite kind of peppers and this was just, lovely!

This was fantastic. I found some Gold, long peppers that worked great. As the others stated, there was plenty left over, I wanted to ensure the same flavor so I kept the recipe the same. However, we only had one brand of Italian sausage at our store and I knew how salty it was so I used a third each of the mild Italian, spicey Italian and regular ground pork (to mild the saltiness). With the brand of sausage I had it was still a little salty even though I reduced the salt almost to nothing so next time I will completely leave out the salt. The sauce was excelent and all of the flavors blended marvelously. This will be a keeper. Thank you!.

I read the comments and found it is true, there's just too much sauce, that is, only if you don't like lots of sauce! Fortunately, I love sauce. Anyway, this is pretty great! I wasn't sure about it at first, but the celery was actually a welcome addition that wouldn't have thought of myself. Changes I made: used a few shallots along with the garlic, only used 1 lb Italian sausage, and added 8 ounces of ricotta cheese to the stuffing.

This is a great recipe. I had to change a couple things though. I didn't have parm, so I diced some moz and added it to the filling. I used a jar of (pretty bland) pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce & crushed tomatoes, but I still used the onion, celery, diced pepper & spices. I also topped with sliced moz the last few minutes of baking. I served them with pasta, italian bread & a salad. My husband liked them so much, he said he was going to eat them all! I didn't let him, of course ;)

I have made these several times and they are always amazing!  I always double the sauce because I like my peppers covered.  Yes it's alot of meat, but so what...stuff some red or green bells and use the extra to make meatballs.  Those of you who think 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs are too much must not have read the recipe.  It states to add 1 cup of the sauce to the meat mixture and it works out perfectly.  This time I filled 8 hot peppers, 2 red bell peppers and a medium large zuchinni all in the same pan and the flavors blend well together. Skip the par boil.  Those who complain it's too much work and rated it poorly because of that need to stick to a box of hamburger helper!  This recipe rocks!  Thanks for sharing Bob.

Really tasty dish!  I wasn't sure I would like it but I needed to find some way to use all the banana peppers from my garden.  I made a couple of changes.  Used 1 lb. total of meat - 1/3 hot italian sausage, 1/3 italian sausage, and 1/3 ground beef.  Used 1 cup of bread crumbs with italian seasoning and omitted the salt and pepper.  Also used olive oil instead of butter.  Had plenty of filling for about 9 peppers.  Will definitely make again!

I made this last night and it was really good. I used different sausage because my husband wanted me to use meat we already had in the freezer (he's a hunter), but the flavor of the sauce and the meats together were fantastic.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there was way too much meat mixture for 8 banana peppers.  I used 10 peppers fresh from our garden and they were huge, but I still had at least a quarter of the meat left over.  I even split my peppers down the middle and made them boats so I could add extra meat and still had a ton left over.  I ended up cooking it at the same time as the peppers in a loaf pan so we can have meatloaf tonight.  :)  Also, next time I will not boil the peppers first.  They became a little mushy after cooking for an hour in the oven.  I'm hoping that by not boiling them first they will remain a little firmer.  I served with a salad and parmesan garlic bread.

We went to Hatch, NM last weekend for their Chile Festival and brought home lots of Chiles.  I used this recipe with the chiles and the whole family loved it.  The only thing I did different was make a cut down one side so it would be easier to clean out the seeds and veins.  The kids don't like foods that are to spicy.

Outstanding!  Great use for our homegrown banana peppers.  I used turkey Italian sausage and cut the meat down to 20 oz...still had way too much filling.  Also, would suggest low casserole to encourage some of the liquid to evaporate during baking.  I like the idea of mozarella as a topper.  Home Run!

FAB!!!!  I sliced peppers in half and laid on sides - FAR easier than stuffing them whole, and meat stayed nicely mounded on top.  I had enough meat left to also stuff some extra green peppers.  I did have to make another batch of sauce for these though, since I used all the sauce on the 8 banana peppers/16 halves.  I did not boil anything prior to stuffing and still turned out great.  A definite keeper, and a nice change from the everyday rotation!!!!

I modified the recipe a little only for ease of making.  I used jarred sauce and only hot sausage.  I like the stuffed hot peppers I get in the restaurants and I worked to get this recipe as close as possible. I basically skip step two and then when I mix the sausage and ingredients I don't mix in any sauce, I save that and put that over the top the peppers and then I take mozzarella cheese after it cooks at least for 1/2 hour and load that on top. Don't put the cheese on too early or it burns and ruins it.  Boiling the peppers before takes out all the bitterness and is definitely a must!!!

If you don't like stuff green peppers than this is the recipe for you! I really liked the taste - banana pepper did not over power the taste. Glad I read the reviews - I only used 1/2 lb of each sausage and still had quite a bit leftover.

These were great.  Unfortunately I had to change up the recipe a little due to what I had on hand.  I used ground beef instead of sausage, tomato sauce from a jar, added chopped onions & ~ 3/4 cup cooked rice to the filling.  I only used 1 lb of meat (I halved the recipe for the filling) & got 12 med - large banana peppers plus extra filling for probably 3 more or so.  I slit the peppers open so I can generously stuff them.  My only problem with this recipe is I wish the peppers would have kept a little crispness... which is probably just impossible after cooking in sauce for that long.  I also make a bunch (the whole filling recipe makes a ton of peppers) and freeze them (without sauce).  I just pull out what I need & thaw during the day before baking.  Then I just use a little pre-made pizza sauce so they aren't too saucy & I don't have to do any more prep.  They turn out great & are a great item to have in the freezer for a no-prep dinner!

I was very skeptical at first, as I have never used banana peppers.  But, I figured since we have such an abundance in the garden this year, I'd try this out.  It really was AMAZING!!!  I only ended up using 1 lb. of the mild sausage, and have enough leftover for a second batch.  I also added shredded mozzarella during the last 5 minutes.  Try this recipe - you will not be disappointed!

While I wouldn't say we disliked these, I would say they were just average. With all the great reviews I expected more from this recipe. All my ingredients were fresh. The peppers from my garden, along with the fresh basil and home canned tomatoes. I agree with other reviewers, the amount of stuffing is way too much although I just scattered the leftovers around the peppers before pouring the sauce over them all. While I was mixing the bread crumbs with the sausage, I thougth 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs would be way too much never the less I followed the recipe instead of my instincts. 1/2 to 3/4 cup bread crumbs would have been plenty. I also was considering cooking the sausage before baking the whole dish to avoid pooling of grease, however again I followed the recipe and found no grease pooling on top. I assumed it was due to the excess bread crumbs soaking it up. All in all, I would not make this again.

Bit too salty, I'ld suggest dropping the salt by at least half a tsp, as sausage is already fairly loaded with salt.

This was fantastic. I only had sweet sausage on hand, and it turned out wonderful. I cut the filling in half and still had some left over. I'll freeze it and use it when I make this again. Sauce was so delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

I loved these. I was given a bunch of banana peppers at work the one day and wanted something good to make, and i found this! It worked out great because i also buy a great quality hot Italian sausage in bulk. Instead of using both hot and mild i just used the hot and cut it down to a lb. The filling still ended up being an extra amount (as a lot of other reviewers pointed out) i just froze the extra and plan on making meatballs with it. My sauce ended up drying out a little when it baked so next time i will either try covering it or adding more sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce was GREAT, I added sugar to mine though.  The meat filling was not so great, I not sure if it was the sausage we just didn't like, but I think it was bread crumbs.  Neither my husband or I ate the filling we just ate around it.  A total disappointment considering the time I spent on them.  I'm going to stick to rice instead next time, and a different sausage,  Oh and I like my peppers a little less done I would only blanch them 3 mins. instead of 5, and at the end top them off with mozzarella cheese or whatever you have in your fridge.

This is a great website to find recipes that are relatively easy to make. There is no way you would ever use 2 pounds of meat to fill 8 banana peppers. I filled 24 and it was still too much meat and I should have cut it in half like suggested in other reviews. I used half lean hamburger and half hot sausage. There is too much salt in the recipe should be about 1/2 of what it calls for. It helps to fill the peppers if you cut a small portion off the tips. My husband loved them and it was a great way to use our banana peppers. I will make this each year when the peppers are ready to pick.

This is an excellent recipe.  My husband and I both loved it.  I made it with sausage that I get from my local sausage store named Serra's.  They have a Serra's Special Sausage that is mild with lots of flavor.  It is flavored with Garlic, Parsley, and Provolone Cheese.  I mixed in jarred sauce, the bread crumbs and 1 egg.  Then stuffed the HOT banana peppers accrding to the recipe.  I poured some more of the sauce over the peppers, and also added diced plum tomatoes from my garden also to chunk up the sauce.  Very Delicious and EASY to make. Thanks Bob.

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday. I used 6 cubanella peppers, and 2 other varieties of peppers to try just for fun. All together I stuffed about 11 peppers with the filling. What a wonderful recipe! We really enjoyed it and will certainly use as one of our regular meal recipes. The sauce is terrific! My husband took some to work and the guys told him his wife is a very good cook! Thanks Lisa!!!!

This recipe was really very yummy!  I bought too many peppers on a special at my grocer, and this was a great way to use some of them up!  I made as written.  I did follow suggestions by other reviewers and only made half of the stuffing mixture.  I used homemade marinara instead of the tomato sauce, and didn't add parmesan simply due to preference.  Great recipe, and these reheat very well!  Hubby had some of the leftovers for breakfast this morning.

I read the other notes so only made half the recipe. I also used smaller sweet yellow peppers so I had some filling left over. I used mushrooms I had on hand and stuffed them as well. Still had some filling left over so browned the mixture in the same frying pan with the chopped mushroom caps and some cheap red wine. I am freezing it and will add to sauce at a later date. NOTHING wasted!

As for the recipe itself....LOVE IT! Next time peppers are bountiful I will definitely make again. And did I mention that my kitchen smells wonderful?

This is getting to ba a tradition at our house!  When the peppers and tomatoes come in, we know just what we are going to do with at least some of them!  Since I know the sausage stuffing will fill lots of peppers, I have lots on hand.  Wonderful way to enjoy the fruits of your garden, and it freezes really well, too.  So nice to reach into the freezer on a cold winter night and bring out something that tastes so fresh and so delicious!  The turkey sausage is great, too.

Very good recipe.  As other's have said, there was way too much filling and this is after I filled 16 banana peppers.  I ended up making meatballs out of the extra filling.

Awesome recipe ... and with the extra meat mix left over after stuffing using only one and a half pounds of fresh hot and mild sausage, I just baked a whole cookie sheet of sausage meatballs to use as a side dish with the banana peppers ... turned out awesome! Just made this for the umpteenth time, just love this one! Enjoy

Totally awesome; this will become a Summer Staples recipe.  I had grown banana peppers for the first time this year and used 6 long banana peppers plus one mild Big Jim New Mexico chile.  I adapted recipe slightly to include only MILD Italian sausage.  I didn't have a pastry bag to stuff the peppers, so I used a teaspoon plus a chopstick as a pusher to shove the stuffing down to the tip of the pepper.  I had excess stuffing, so I put Pam in a glass oven banking dish, put the excess filling all over the bottom, lay the peppers on this, and poured sauce over all.  Baked just as directed and it smelled wonderful.  THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS, I am serving it to my new boyfriend, whom I want to impress with my cooking.  I intend to serve it with cucumber salad in sour cream, another Summer Staples recipe.

I made this recipe and my fiance called anybody that would listen to tell them how good it was. The only thing is I waited to long to use my bannana peppers so I couldn't use them all so I substituted and used the large pasta shells and followed everything in the recipe just stuffed the shells instead of the peppers and what peppers I could use I cut them down and stuffed in the shells with the ingredients. Sprinkled left over cheese and suace on top. I still give it five stars because it was soooo freakin good!

I would agree with cutting the salt down to 1 1/2 or just 1 tea spoon.  The cut the meat down to 1 pound total and it made 11 peppers in total.

Delicious.  I even "healthed" this up and it was still great.  I used 99% fat free ground turkey instead of sausage.  Much less spicy, but you can leave more of the membrane in the sausage if you want it hot. The only thing I would change is add more sauce (I made it with noodles for my kids). Thanks!

Yum! What a great way to use the banana peppers growing in our garden! I made the following modifications to the recipe: 1) I cut back the salt to 1 teaspoon total (half in the sauce and half with the sausage). I figured the sausage, bread crumbs, and tomato sauce already came with their own salt, and neither my husband nor I thought the recipe was any worse off for reducing the amount. 2) I bought 2 lbs of mild Italian sausage because the hot sausage at my store all had MSG. To compensate, I added a diced jalapeno pepper to the sauce (sauteed with the onions and celery), and then I added tabasco flakes, crushed red pepper, and paprika to the sausage mix. It had a nice kick to it. As other reviewers stated, you end up with way more filling than you need. I stuffed 12 banana peppers and still had at least half of the filling left over, which I froze for later use. We ate the peppers with angel hair pasta, and it was delicious.

I make this recipe all the time, it is delicious.  A tip on stuffing the peppers, cut a small amount of the bottom "tip" of the pepper so that there is a small opening, this allows air to pass through the pepper when stuffing.  Makes it a lot easier.  I usually make about a dozen peppers, and freeze remaining stuffing mixture for next time.

I made a few alterations: added shredded cheddar cheese which added a nice flavor. I used my own sauce recipe and used half hot sausage and half ground beef. I used all sausage previously and we prefer the mix with beef. I found really large peppers at the Amish road-side stand. So much easier to stuff! We love this recipe and make it at least once a month. Thanks Bob!

This was mouthwatering. I only used one package of italian sausage and one can of the crushed tomatoes. This made a lot even with the one package of sausage, so I cooked what was left of the stuffing, added the other can of tomato sauce and seasoned it up to make a nice spaghetti sauce that I served on the side with pasta. It was fabulous! Thank you!

Excellent!  Very tasty and satisfying.  Takes a lot of prep work but it's worth it.  Thanks Bob, this one is a definite keeper!  -3rd time making it and I think I would like it even more with 1/2 italian sausage & 1/2 ground beef so will try that next time.

Made this for my husband's bday using banana peppers from our garden.  It was delicious. As another reader suggested, I skipped boiling the peppers.  They still turned out very tender and did not fall apart.  The sauce was wonderful - very good seasoning and taste.  It is a very flexible sauce - I only had chopped tomatoes with chili seasoning and added extra oregano and basil.  I blended the sauce after cooking since I did not finely chop the vegetables.  Loved this recipe and will make again and again!!!

There were just the  2 of us, so did some minor changes but kept the basic recipe.  I used 1 pound of Bob Evan's Italian sausage and that was plenty.  To the sausage, halved all other ingredients, plus added some pepper flakes for a little heat to take the place of the hot sausage.  Made the whole recipe of sauce and I am glad that I did.  Topped with mozarella cheese halfway through baking.  These were the bomb!  Stuffed 12 medium banana peppers, so plenty left. Update to my old review - I NEVER parboil peppers.  Never necessary. Just stuff and bake.

Tasty, but triple the amount of meat filling needed. Additionally I made 12 large meat balls and still have enough meat mixture left for another batch of the peppers. Add the mozzarella topping. Use whatever tomato sauce you like...I used one with zucchini and other vegies.

It was a little hot.  I would opt to use the mild sausage.  I was confused when the sausage was to be cooked. Had a good taste, but time consuming to put together.

Very good and flavorful. I followed previous advice and halved the amount of meat mixture, but kept the sauce the same. I had extra meat, so I crumbled it and spread it throughout the pan. Also, no need to add salt. Very good, but a lot of work!

Wow, this was a LOT of work (and I'm not opposed to a fair amount of chopping either).  Based on previous reviews I halved the meat mixture, and there was still more than half left!  Taste was good, 4*.  I was tempted to rate a 3 because I knew how much labor was involved.

I made these just as the recipe said and they were beautiful to look at, but were way too salty!  Also, I agree with the other reviews that state that there is entirely too much meat.  I stuffed 13 big banana peppers with it.  I think if I do it again I will eliminate the salt altogether (the sausage already has enough salt in it) and mix the hot italian sausage with hamburger instead of all sausage.  It was overwhelming to everyone in my family and my husband is a sausage lover.

Pretty darn good! I used this recipe as a starting point: I stuffed Banana & Hungarian Hot Wax peppers with a mixture of raw minced onions, breadcrumbs, cream cheese, 2 cloves minced garlic and italian seasonings. Half a jar of spaghetti sauce in the pan and the remaining over top of the peppers, a little sprinkle of mozzarella and FABULOUS!

This recipe is a keeper. I changed the recipe a bit because I had made stuffed green peppers and had leftover meat mixture. So I had hamburger and rice and cheese in with everything else. These were great. I think they would have been great either way. Thanx so much!!

This was delicious!  I'm a college student so this was quite an undertaking for me, but it was really pretty simple.  I left out the celery and the breadcrumbs (I forgot to pick them up at Wal-mart), and since there was so much meat mixture left over I put some with the left-over tomato sauce to pour over the peppers.  I will definitely cook this again.

I am a vegetarian, and I adapted this recipe. It was awesome. I used fake sausage to replace the meat, and I halved the filling recipe, and still had enough for meatballs left. I also used half bread crumbs and half oatmeal, and canned spaghetti sauce. I used banana peppers and jalapenos. It was really good this way, if any other vegetarians are interested - my father in law ate his up and had no idea that it was meatless until I told him. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe, however, I rarely ever go exactly by a recipe. I had a lot of banana peppers from my garden. they seemed way too small to stuff, so I had to make a slice in them to put the stuffing in.  Made sauce from fresh garden tomatoes and more garlic because we LOVE garlic.  Used a lot less sausage because I knew that 2 pounds were WAAYY too much, in fact, I used only 3 hot sausages out of their casings, browned ahead in skillet.  Only had to cook about 30  minutes.  They were wonderful and will make them again when I pick a bunch more peppers.  It will probably come out a bit different a second time but its a great recipe starter!  Thanks for the idea!

For a great variation, try using Cubanella peppers instead of Banana. They are bigger & easier to stuff and are mild if you don't like the heat of banana peppers.

Hubby liked it... I found it a bit dry after the baking. Added some zesty spag sauce I preheated in microwave and parmesan over top, baked in oven about 10 more minutes.  Was good.

I love spicy food and this sure was.  almost a little to spicy.  But I still loved it.  I messed up and put 1 whole egg.  And it still was fine.  With the left over stuffing and there was a lot.  I made meatballs and double the sauce and had meatball sandwichs.  Thanx for the recipe

Bravo! This was very good. I plan to use the tomato sauce mixture for other dishes as well. My husband loved it as well. I did have extra filling which a froze for next time.

Great recipe!  Definitely worth trying.  My husband loves stuffed banana peppers, and he thought these were delicious.  I usually cover my peppers with sauce from a jar, but the sauce in this recipe was worth the making.  However, as other reviewers have said, this recipe makes a LOT more than eight banana peppers.  I made the mistake of doubling the recipe.  I was able to stuff around three dozen small- to medium-sized banana peppers and another sixteen large, and I still had about a pound of stuffing mixture left over.  I was wondering if the recipe was for stuffed green peppers instead of banana peppers???

This was much too salty.  The tomato flavor was overpowering.  There was no subtle depth of flavor.

This recipe was fantastic, absolutely delicious!!! First off don't pay attention to the negative reviews because there was too much sausage. BooHoo  A big part of cooking is adapting. It's true you only need half the sausage for 8 banana peppers. I knew before hand this was going to be a lot of sausage to fill the volume of the peppers (my banana were 12" in length and 2" diameter) as it's pretty obvious however, I was actually glad that I had left over stuffing. With the left over stuffing I made meatballs and paired them with fried green tomatoes for brunch the next morning. I balled about 8 sausage meatballs (2.5"-3") and poured a bit of the sauce over them, put them back in the oven at the same temperature. 30-35 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160. Others were also complaining that you don't need to boil the peppers before hand as the recipe states. This may be true but the boiling helps soften the peppers a bit to make them more pliable so they don't break while pulling back the flap and stuffing the pepper. It is an extra step but I found it worth while and I was busy cutting the veggies and preparing the sauce while this was happening so it wasn't any wasted time for me. This recipe gets a five star from me because the flavors were fantastic and I don't mind to have a little extra so I can re-purpose ingredients for more than one meal. If you have kids you can easily make spaghetti and meatballs the following night and the meatballs will be done.

These were delicious! Our oven ended up breaking while I was trying to make this so I just cooked it on the stove top and they turned out great. We served with some pasta. Perfect summer recipe from the garden.

great recipe as is....second time I changed a few things,
no need to par boil peppers. i use tomato sauce in stead of
crushed tomatoes, I also used all hot sausage. to much filling 
so I just pick more peppers and fill them & I make meat balls with the left over hot sausage stuffing ad them in with the peppers, they are great for spaghetti.
Mozzarella cheese at the end...yum

This recipe gave me a great starting point to make stuffed banana peppers. I felt the amounts of ingredients were way off. Even using large banana peppers, 2 packs of sausage and all that sauce makes way too much filling.

I have used this EXACT recipe several times now.  This is also the FIRST time I ever took the time to rate and review.  This is the BEST recipe, and I follow the sauce exactly as stated.  The only thing I change with the filling is that I only use mild sausage.  I would use HOT, however my kids would not like it.  I do stuff a few HOT peppers for my hubby.  This is seriously the best recipe.  You will want to eat any leftover sauce on your plate.  I'm going to use this sauce recipe for other dishes.  Thank you!

Although I like hot Italian sausage, I found the meat mixture dense and heavy.  Like a ball of concrete in the stomach.

Excellent recipe!  Difficult to convince husband to try something new, but he did and he loved it!  May not mean much to any of you, but trust me, that is the best review I could possibly give it.  Try it and you won't be sorry!

Just wasn't a fan - the peppers got mushy but the skins remained tough. I'll stick with the sausage stuffed jalapenos!

This was delicious! My husband raved about it so much, I had to make it again for his friends too!  There was plenty of stuffing for 2 or 3 times the amout of peppers called for. So I made more of the sauce and made another batch of peppers!

These are wonderful! I bought 10 cubanela peppers instead of 8 banana peppers- that was my only change. There was a perfect amount of stuffing for this larger, milder pepper- I would not change a thing! This recipe went into my recipe box!

A very very good recipe! I had trouble removing the seeds/membranes so I cut the peppers down the middle and opened them up then stuffed then  put an extra slice of pepper on top. Topped with provolone after baking for an hour. I used ground beef instead of sausage which was good but next time I will use the sausage. A wonderful hearty, comforting dish.

I made this exactly as written with one exception, I had many different kinds of peppers ready in my garden so I used them all.  It was delicious.  My son who is a bit of a picky eater liked it.  It was more like italian meatballs than stuffed peppers.  I also split the peppers and stuffed them open face, worked great.

Very good.  I tryed both ways of stuffing the peppers--slicing with one slice and stuffing uncut.  I liked the peppers best with one slice & baked open.  Gave a better taste.

Excellent. I found that the filling was more than necessary for the 8 large bannana peppers that I used, so I cooked the left over amount as a meat loaf with the sauce over the top and covered with grated parmesan. The next time I make these I will use mild and medium sausage rather than one HOT!

I made some of the substitutions and exchanges mentioned in the previous comments.  This still deserves 5 stars...the only reason I couldn't give it 5 is because I wound up with a lot of juice in the pan.  I felt that a lot of the flavor was left behind, even though it still was awesome.  Any ideas as to how to combat all theliquid left?  I may try to make a soup from it...

I liked this recipe.  I did not make as much filling as called for (per previous reviews).  I also cooked some pasta and then baked the peppers and sauce on top of the pasta.  It is now a one dish meal that my family really enjoys!

I enjoy my peppers with rice in them, but this was a nice change. I used a combination of cubanelle (mild) and hungarian wax peppers (hot) because my store doesn't sell banana peppers. I also just used the hot sausage, as other's have said how there is too much meat to begin with. I cooked these on the stove top since my oven is on the fritz; simmering (covered) on medium-low for about 40 minutes. To pipe the filling in the peppers, I put the mixture in a quart sized zip-loc bag, and cut off a corner to squeeze it out. I think I'll stick to my step-mother's recipe, but this was a great change up to a tried-and-true favorite, thanks.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I think it needs a total makeover as far as how much meat is needed, it is way too much meat, and I really can't give it a 5 star rating b/c I didn't have a few ingredients so I winged it (which I rarely do) BUT, the flavors were great, and it's a good start to a great recipe once it is revised...

Wonderfull!!! I added 1 box (8oz) of cream cheese, and 1/2 lb of mixed italian cheeses to the stuffing.I also used only mild sausage instead of a roll of hot(my daughter cant do hot stuff). And used 2 kinds of peppers that I grew in my garden this year, Hungarian Wax (hot) and Cubanell (sweet). All 3 of my children loved them, even the very picky 7 year old. This recipe is an absolute keeper that will go into the family cookbook that gets handed down to the next generation.

Oh my gosh, was this awesome! We decided to grow some hot banana peppers this year and last week I began to worry about how best to use them. I cam across this recipe and I am so glad I did.  Others are right, even though my banana peppers were huge, I had a lot of extra stuffing, Soooo, I made meatballs for the non-pepper lovers in my house. Just make sure they are covered in the sauce and check the temp after the 60 minute cooking time is up.  I served it with rice topped with the sauce and fresh green beans This is a definite keeper!

Makes more meat than you need.  you can halve all of the stuffing ingredients, use the whole egg, and have enough for 10-12 peppers.  This stuffing makes the perfect meat balls.  I rolled the extra into 1 inch balls and fried in a little oil until crisp. The best sausage stuffed peppers I've eaten.  Sauce was excellent as well.

One of the best dishes I have had in a long time!  I made this vegetarian style and used mock hamburger vs the sausage...spicy can be done via spices.  Perfect use for all those banana peppers from the garden and will make again!

very good!! Used hungarian hot peppers. For the filling I used mild italian sausage and chorizo.Left out the celery. Instead of crushed tomatoes used diced tomatoes with green chiles. And when ready sliced in half and topped with some of the cooked sauce and extra mozzarella. The peppers were not as hot once cooked. Definantly a keeper. Liked better than stuffed green peppers!

Outstanding!  Recipe definitely fills more peppers than listed, but that was great as I have an overabundance in my garden.  They freeze really well, I stuck a label on the front so the hubby/kids could cook them anytime.  They just fill the dish with how many they are planning to cook for supper, cover it with a can of spaghetti sauce, and cook it as directed.  Cover with shredded cheese the last 10 minutes - and a great home cooked meal with no effort.  Thanks Bob for a great recipe!

I was very pleased how easy and yummy this recipe is.  I also substituted a jar of pasta sauce like mentioned in several reviews.  I used fresh basil too, just because I have tons!!  This recipe reminds me of a dish at a local Italian restaurant.  I will definately make this again!

I took the easy simpler version of sustituting the spaghetti sauce for the filling rather than the original recipe ingredients.  It was great!!!  I finally found a way to put all my home-grown banana peppers to use!!

This was good.  I coughed a lot making it because of the seeds inside the peppers, but it was worth it.  Loved this dish for the most part.

I made them for a family dinner over the weekend - Huge hit!! I  stuffed the peppers canoe style also, it was much easier then stuffing from the top. I topped them with cheese too.  Didn't add salt and they were great.

I assumed that cutting tops of peppers off and chopping edible portions meant the lengthwise tops when laying on their sides! I didn't see how to remove seeds and ribs any other way.  This worked out great and made it easy to insert stuffing.(I cut off stem end also)  I loved the recipe but way too salty!!!  I had doubled the recipe so I could make 1/2 with less spicy sausage.  Doubling the salt almost ruined it.  Definately cut back on salt and I will add mozzarella cheese last 10 minutes as others suggested.  I agree that this makes enough meat mixture for at least 3 times the peppers. I'm going to try freezing some as the peppers are coming on heavy right now.  I'M SO THANKFUL TO FIND A WAY TO USE THEM!!!

Absolutely to die for!  I made it with tomatoes from my garden and Contadina sauce; the peppers were also from my garden.  There was too much meat for peppers so I saved the extra and will make meatballs with it.  I made mine over spaghetti and cooked it on the grill -- it was fantastic!  Served it with oven fried catfish -- also on the grill.  Best banana pepper recipe ever!

Very good. Most people stuff bell peppers, but I much prefer these stuffed banana peppers! I use pork breakfast sausage. To save time, you can use canned sauce.

Fantastic!!  I can not express how excellent this recipe is.  I did use my own sauce for the only reason, I had it already made.  I made these three weeks in a row for my family.

This is a very good recipe, I used cubanelle peppers instead of banana because they are larger and easier to stuff. I covered them with one large can of red sauce and put them in the crock pot on low for about 6 hours. They were awesome! I had a lot of stuffing left over but I just popped it in the freezer for next time. Will make again!

I thought this was pretty good, but my boyfriend LOVED it! I followed other cooks' suggestions to make this a bit quicker... used our favorite jarred spaghetti sauce, added a big tomato from my garden, and used regular italian sausage (not hot). Barely into attempting to stuff the peppers, I realized it just wasn't gonna happen, even using my pastry bag. I sliced the peppers down the middle on one side and piped a line of the mixture down the middle. This worked great and allowed me to really get alot of the meat mixture into each pepper. I did add a generous amount of shredded mozzarella in the last 10 minutes of baking, which really made the dish, in my opinion. I did halve the stuffing, and I still had WAY too much! I stuffed 10 huge banana peppers and 6 jalapenos and still had extra. My boyfriend said "feel free to make those anytime!". :)

These are delicious! My only complaint is that they are more time consuming than I expected and I found the filling to be a little salty. That's not the recipe's fault, but just the nature of the hot sausage. I would do half plain ground pork and half hot sausage to combat the saltiness next time. Otherwise, my family loved them!

I changed it a small amt...
I have Aneheim peppers in that garden, so cut them in 1/2 and put them in the bottom of the pan, used Hot & Spicy Pork Sausage( Jimmy Dean's) with the bread crumbs...and stuffed the 1/2's and added the rest of the meat along side the peppers, and poured the sauce over it all and added some Mozarella right before done..
Was very good..and will try it with 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sausage next time..

THis recipe is amazing!  I used my husbands wonderful homemade sausage.  I tried the piping bag suggestion from other people and I found that it was actually easier to take sausage, roll it and put it in the peppers a little at a time.  The piping bag tore 2 peppers and wasn't getting the sausage in far enough to the pepper so I would use my finger or a butter knife in longer peppers.  Other than the sausage, I made the recipe as stated.  It did make about 16 peppers, thats all the peppers i had on hand, and I had more meat left over that I put in a freezer bag and froze for another time.  I can't wait to be able to make this for my parents.  They will love it as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Ok, I made a couple of changes: I couldn't find banana peppers at the store, so I used poblanos instead. I also used 8oz just spicy Italian sausage for 4 servings. Finally, 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time, I topped everything with a couple of slices of Swiss cheese. I took it out of the oven when the cheese was bubbly. Husband absolutely loved this. Awesome recipe, Lisa. Thanks!

I was actually looking for a cheese based recipe for stuffing hot peppers when I saw this and decided to give it a try.  DH was disappointed.  He thought there should have been a beef/italian sausage mixture for better texture.  I gave several to people at work and they happened to love them.  I'm not a sausage eater so I didn't try them so I have to base by comments and reviews according to opinions.  If anyone has a cheese-only recipe PLEASE post it!

Wow! This was great. I did change the recipe some. I used regular green peppers instead of the hot banana peppers and I didn't use any egg when mixing the meat. This is a definit keeper and way to impress the company!

These were VERY spicy!  And my husband and I love spicy food.  We could hardly eat them.  I wonder if I got the wrong kind of banana peppers.  Are there sweet and spicy bananna pappers?  We also had so much meat mixture left over.  What a waste.  I did try to make meatballs out of them.  I think this recipe could work.  I recemmend bell peppers and using only a pound of mild Italian sausage.  The red sauce was very good.  In fact I would double that part.

I made this for my father's b-day dinner and it was a HUGE hit. I used sweet red and yellow banana shaped -- not banana peppers. It was beautiful and delicious. Definitely going into the recipe book. Thanks.

The meal was awesome.  My banana peppers were smaller than normal so I made the excess sausage into meatballs and cooked them on a cookie sheet.  So I had the banana peppers stuffed and spagetti and meatballs with fresh baked bread.  I expected the meal to have a kick but really nothing since I used sweet banana peppers.  My in-laws were scared to try it because of being too spice, but after trying it, they want to cook more often for them.  The meal took longer to cook than expected is the only drawback (total of 2 hours including the cook time).

This is an excellent recipe! Someone from work gave me a whole bag of banana peppers, so I tried this recipe. My whole family loves it. I have them frozen and I have put them in the crock pot. They turn out just as good. Thanks Lisa for the recipe.

This was a good stuffed pepper recipe, and I say this not being a big fan of stuffed peppers.  The banana peppers give it spice which makes it more interesting.  We used half the amount of meat and used a veggie sausage.  That was still enough to fill a ton of peppers, as other reviewers have stated.  Also we left out the bread crumbs and the filling was moist!  Next time I would spice up the tomato sauce more to give it more flavor and maybe use some cheese over the peppers while they are baking.  Was delicious!

Really, really good.  Plenty of stuffing mix, so I froze the remainder and will use  it another time.  We used cubanelles (not sure if they're the same as banana peppers) and they were great.  We will definately make this again.  I added a 16 oz can of tomato sauce to use up the can and a half jar of spaghetti sauce that we had left over from another dinner.  I liked having the extra sauce to pour over.

This was pretty tasty. I had plenty of the stuffing mix left so I just started stuffing the other peppers in my fridge. I used red and yellow peppers for the extra and it was good too. You can probably use this for any pepper stuffing.

Wow.  Thanks for this great submission.  This was outstanding.  Couldn't find "banana peppers" in the produce department, so used Hungarian wax peppers which I believe is the same thing.  At least they had the same general appearance and heat as banana peppers.  Used turkey Italian sausage, no bread crumbs and omitted the can of tomato sauce.  Also sprinkled the top with more parmesan before baking and served with a side of low-carb spaghetti.  We just love it!

Made this with both sweet and hot banana peppers and found that the hot peppers added more flavor. Could be from my love of all things hot & spicy. Used a jerky gun to stuff the peppers which worked quite well. Great recipe!

My family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this!  For sure its a keeper.  I forgot to add the parmesan cheese to the sausage mix, but put a tablespoon over the top of each pepper.  I don't know if things would have been better with the parmesan mixed in or not, but next time I will put it in the mix.

Only changes I made was to use 1lb of hot sausage and 1lb ground beef. Stuffed all the peppers I had and put them in a dutch oven. I thought this was a really good recipe and will definately make it again.

Very good recipe. As others have stated the meat mixture makes way more than 8 peppers. I used HUGE hot banana peppers, halfed the recipe and it still made 10 peppers. I like it hot so I only used hot italian sausage for more flavor. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden put through a food processor and added a little sugar. You can also cut the salt in half with this recipe and add to taste. I also grilled over indirect flame and some smoke instead of baking to give it a little different flavor. You should use a grill tray or mat to avoid anything falling through the grates.

Love, Love, Love these. We are addicted to these and I make them often, especially since I had lots of peppers from the garden. A great option to reduce carbs in a meal.

Made this recipe, same as the others, way too much filling.  I stuffed about 25 peppers (filled a 13X9 baking dish and still had stuffing left over.  I made meatballs out of the remaining stuffing and fried them and then added to the casserole dish the last 10 minutes of baking.  I would increase the amount of sauce next time too.  The sauce is fabulous.

These are the bomb! I’ve been searching for years for a stuffed banana pepper recipe with sausage and tomato sauce. Every recipeI found had cream cheese! I stumbled upon this one, and read through the reviews before making. Yes, it makes a lot of stuffing - I stuffed 16 hot banana peppers, 3 bell peppers, and made 14 mini-meatballs. I heated up some extra sauce (our favorite jarred brand), and these hit the spot! Delicious! Wouldn’t  change a thing! Thank you for posting!

I was really excited to try this recipe.  I was uncertain what to expect and I did follow the instructions exactly.  While it tastes fine, good actually, it tasted no different than if I had just put stewed tomatoes in the pot with hot and mild sausage links with cut up banana peppers.  It was a ton of work to just end up having it taste exactly like my normal hot sausage does.

These were delicious!!  I used sweet Italian sausage because the banana peppers were labeled hot, they were not hot.  If I had known, I would have used hot sausage but they were good anyway. I topped them with shredded mozzarella cheese.  Yum!

If you had to make modifications to the recipe, THEN IT'S NOT A 5 STAR RECIPE!!!!  I absolutely love these peppers, but you do need about twice the amount of peppers and consequently twice the sauce (or make half the meat mixture).  Also, top with mozzarella and bake until a few minutes more until melted

loved it.  am going to make again with some alterations! i would use more peppers, because i had lots of excess meat that i made into sausage balls.  i am also going to use half hamburger and i also used rice instead of bread crumbs.  i am also considering not boiling the peppers as i think they will be soft enough after an hour of cooking.

I cut the recipe in half, used 12 peppers and still had enough left over to stuff 3 green peppers.  I will cook the sausage beforehand, cool it to room temp and then mix with the other ingredients. Did not use egg to bind the mixture. I cut off the tops and used a paring knife and a tiny fork to remove the ribs and seeds. Used the fork and spoon to stuff peppers. Had to pour off grease from the meat. I cooked the peppers covered with foil for 40 min., removed the foil added more shredded cheese finished cooking for the last 15-20 min.  Served the peppers and sauce over angel hair pasta.

Oh my Gosh!!! This was sooo good! I stayed true to the spirit of the ingredients, but did make some adaptations. Instead of using can crushed tomatoes and can tomato sauce, I used my homemade canned stewed Italian tomatoes from my garden. (1 quart jar). Which already included the seasonings, celery, onions, and green peppers.
     I did not boil the banana peppers as suggested in step one. I first slightly browned the two sausages, (mild Italian and original Bob Evans pork  sausage), w/ celery, onion, and garlic as called for in recipe. Removed from stove top, let cool, then mixed in the egg, Worcestershire, cheese ( Italian 5 cheese blend),  panko bread crumbs, and 1 cup of my homemade stewed tomatoes that I had heated for 10 minutes. 
     I slit the peppers, down the middle, removed seeds and membrane, stuffed with meat mixture. I had enough mixture to stuff 22 large/long peppers.  Arranged in a 9x13 and 7x10 deep dish glass baking casseroles.  Topped both with the remaining sauce, baked for 42 minutes, topped with left over cheese, baked an additional 7 minutes. 
     Because I have an abundance of banana peppers this year, after supper I went to the grocery store and bought more sausage so I can make this again tomorrow, with the intent to freeze for future meals.

I also only used half the meat stuffing mixture, but other than that, followed the recipe and was a big hit.  I will definitely make this again and often.

The only things i did different from the recipe were to slice the peppers longwise on one side so they were easier to stuff and I added mozzarella  on top of the peppers during the last 10 minutes of baking time.  Bob, you’re the banana pepper king! Can’t wait to have the leftovers for dinner tonight!

I've made this recipe several times. I made it as written, the first time. Each time since, the only thing, I've changed was the peppers. There is way too much filling for banana peppers. I decided on a larger variety. I have been making this recipe now by using Cubanelle peppers. They are larger and are still mild in flavor. Other than that one substitution, I follow the recipe as is.  This is a really tasty recipe!

Love this. I used sweet and hot sausage and both were fantastic. I used jar sauce and served with a side of pasta.

My daughter made this, and her husband said it was the best meal she ever cooked for him.  We had summer squash coming out of the garden like crazy, and used the sausage mixture from this in them (vs. using banana peppers).  The sausage mixture was awesome, can't wait to make the banana stuffed peppers next time.

I have made this recipe several times and it has always been awesome. Only changes are 3/4 cup bread crumbs and 12 peppers as this is too much filling for 8. I also then make extra sauce. Have used different kinds of peppers and always comes out great. Excellent with rice side.

Amazing.  I did not blanch the peppers, simply stuffed and cooked. Made mini meatballs with the excess meat, threw them in the sauce and cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  Heavenly

I kind of winged this one.  Used my own pasta sauce that I had canned.  Used hot Italian sausage and Italian ground turkey, because that's what I had already.  The meat mix made WAY more than 8 pepper's worth, which is totally fine, because I'm swimming in banana peppers right now.  I think it ended up making 32 stuffed peppers and 8 meatballs.  I liked this so much, I ate leftovers for breakfast the next day.  

Next time I will halve the meat mix, reduce the breadcrumbs a bit, and maybe add some ricotta.

This turned out great! I modified a few things slightly. First off, I did slice peppers down the side to seed completely. I parboiled in salted water for 3.5 mins then drained and set aside. For the filling I used just over 1 lb. of Italian sausage, 1 egg, 1/2 cup fresh grated Grana Padano cheese, about 3/4 cup bread crumbs (I added until I liked the mixed texture), and worchestershire as written. I did not add the tomato sauce to the meat mixture. I added fresh ground pepper and a bit of salt, I definitely DID NOT use as much salt as written.  I made the sauce pretty much as written, however I added a 398 ml size tomato sauce instead of 8 oz size.  I seasoned to taste and cooked for longer than 10 mins. I prefer to cook down and develop a bit more flavour. While my sauce cooked I filled the peppers by hand, super easy as the peppers were sliced down the side. Laid the peppers into a glass 9x13 and spooned the hot tomato sauce over the peppers.  Baked in oven for 1 hr. Served with salad and garlic toast. Will definitely make this again!

I'll make this again, it was pretty good. I changed the amount of sausage to a 1/2 pound of ground sweet Italian as looking at it 2 lbs would have been too much for 8 banana peppers. Also used my own made marinara sauce.

Not bad. Too saucy, and the quality ingredients I used for the meat, and the method of cooking, made the sausage too soft.

Pretty simple and delicious.  Followed others advice and salted only the pepper water.  Used hot Italian sausage  which may be too spicy for some but we loved it!

These were very good... However.. 30 minute prep is not realistic... Peppers need cleaning, veggies need chopping.. Sauce and filling needs to be made... Plan on at least an hour.  Half the filling.. Cut back on the breadcrumbs... And way too salty... I would only put the salt in the sauce.

Amazing!! Switched the crushed tomatoes for diced (basil garlic oregano flavor), only added 1 cup of bread crumbs (Italian flavor).  There is no need to parboil peppers at all.  I cut the meats in half and I partially browned them (since I'm OCD about undercooked meats).  Fresh basil (once you've had fresh basil in anything, you'll never switch back to dried)!! I used about 10 peppers and still had meat left over!  I plan on making these in large quantity and freezing them.  I made them for a party and got rave reviews and no leftovers!!! This may be my signature dish!! Oh, and don't be scared of the hot sausage mixed in... It's really not that hot. Next time I plan on adding a little bit of mozzarella in the mix and a little on top right before it's done.

Thanks Bob. The recipe does make alot of extra but I have many Zucchini in the garden to stuff also, so it worked out great. I used ground sirloin instead of hot Italian Sausage as I was preparing it for my in-laws who are older so I toned down the heat. But I would use the hot stuff for a Buffalo Bills tailgate party. It was very relaxing making it . Very good recipe . Most restaurants here use a ricotta mixture so it is different. I had parmesan cheese that was given to me from Italy and it takes it to another level.

The flavors in this recipe are on point. Couldn't be better. The filling recipe just makes way too much! Unless they used Banana peppers that were a foot long, there's no way it filled just eight. But loved it :)

I have so many banana peppers this year.  They must like the hot weather!  I made slight variations because there are only two of us, I wanted to save time, and I am on the South Beach diet.  I simmered 8 large seeded peppers 10 minutes to decrease time in the oven.  I only used one pound of sausage and used 1/2 of everything else, except I used full spices.  I added the worshester sauce to the tomato mixture and omitted the egg and bread crumbs.  Then added some of the sauce to the sausage, added cheese, and spooned the meat into the peppers.  Then poured the remaining tomato mixture over the peppers and baked for 1/2 hour.   Even my husband enjoyed this recipe and that is saying a lot because he does most of the cooking!!

I was confused about stuffing uncooked sausage to pepper. Previous recipes I've removed casing ,cooked it first then crumbled and add bread crumbs etc. It was good though ,I removed the casting mixed it raw filled my peppers that I cut lengthwise which made it much easier. Still in sure if I was supposed to remove casing .....

Halved the recipe and still had meat left over after stuffing 12-14 banana peppers!  Used fresh instead of canned tomatoes and didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, also substituted swiss chard for the celery and added some of the greens.  Delicious, smelled so good cooking and makes for a nice presentation too!

Too much work! The amount of time involved, cost of meat and taste didn't match. 

We made exact recipie. No changes... The recipie called for 8 peppers... We filled 12 and they were huge and we still had more than half of the meat filling left over.  If you do try this recipie start by cutting it in half.

I thought I ours was too Sally... But that could have been our sausage? Maybe, maybe not...I didn't rate it based on the saltiness..

It was okay... We really loved the sauce and might duplicate it for pizza ect..I won't make this again though

I tried this with home-grown banana peppers. The filling recipe makes a LOT of meat. Consider cutting it in half if you're just making for two. I did 12 peppers. My husband and I ate six, we kept two for a lunch tomorrow, and I helf-cooked four more and froze them. I also froze the remaining filling, which should make at least another batch of 12. We absolutely LOVED it! The sauce was a perfect complement. I served it with plain penne pasta on the side, and we mixed the sauce into it. Looking forward to the next batch!

I read a lot of reviews but had already purchased 8 nice long banana peppers.  I cut the recipe in half and the only change I made was to ease up on the salt and add 2 teaspoons of sugar to the sauce.  That said, this is one of the best sauces I have ever tasted.  I stuffed all 8 peppers and still had some meat mixture left (even with halving the entire recipe).  My son doesn't like banana peppers so I rolled the remaining meat mixture in three 8" flour tortillas.  I put the peppers and tortillas in a 9 x 13 baking dish, sprinkled a little mozzarella over it, and then poured the rest of the sauce over it all.  I wished I had a little more sauce but next time I will know.  This is a really good recipe that you can tweak to your liking.  You could stuff anything with this meat and sauce or serve with pasta or rice.  Minus stuffing the banana peppers, there is nothing difficult about this recipe.  I hope you won't be afraid to try it.  The taste is just awesome.

Delicious!  My kids loved these and my husband fought for the leftovers for his lunch.
Things I did different:
Quadrupled the peppers-they weren't huge anyway.
I cooked the sausage-to get off some of the grease. Then mixed in the egg etc.
Made two pans and froze one for later.
Next time I will make extra tomato sauce.

These were great, loved them, they were a little spicier than I thought they'd be since I only used mild Italian Sausage.  Never knew Banana Peppers could have such heat once cooked.  Once plated we put some sour cream on top and it just topped them off in a great way.

Planted one banana pepper plant in garden , inundated with banana peppers!  What to do with all of them?  THIS!  Whole family loved it - great rut-buster!  I did have quite a bit of filling leftover, even after stuffing 10 large banana peps. I just made it into meatballs for the one anti-veggie kid in our family (little did he know there was celery in the sauce - ha!). Big hit all around. Will definitely make this again. Thanks Bob, wherever you are!!

Good base recipe in general, but you have to make adjustments. The measurements are weird like other reviewers posted, and I only give it 5 stars because it turned out pretty darn good from just eyeballing the amounts to suit my 5 medium peppers. I slit them down the middle to make them easier to stuff.. overstuffed them and served over pasta. Tastes like sausage pizza! Yum.

I will definitely make these again! My boyfriend and I decided to prepare extra sauce and keep them in a crock pot to share with his family. We made about 12 stuffed peppers and still had extra meat mixture. We added a few meatballs and then decided to freeze the rest of the meat for next time. This is a great recipe, thanks!

These were really good. We made a few alterations. We didn't follow the sausage mixture exactly, we added a pound of very lean ground beef instead of mild sausage. We also added tomato paste and mozzarella cheese to bake over the top of them. We also browned the stuffed peppers a little before baking them in the sauce.
We will be making these again.

I really enjoyed the peppers, although they were very time-consuming.  I used only 1/2 of the filling ingredients called for (after reading other reviews), stuffed 10 peppers, and still had leftover filling.  I ended up doubling the sauce recipe and used the leftover filling to make (20!) meatballs -- I baked the meatballs/sauce along side the peppers.  Very tasty -- I stuck to hot sausage and skipped the sweet sausage.

If I could have given 4.5 stars I would have. First, there was twice as much filling as needed. The meat filling was delicious though. The sauce was also very good. I did not boil the peppers because I did not want to lose the flavor--so the peppers ended up being a little tougher than I would have liked. Next time I may try to either steam them a minute or roast them before stuffing.

This was a great recipe, tase-wise, but I agree with other reviewers that it makes entirely too much meat mixture for 8 peppers. Also, I think boiling the peppers for 5 minutes really cut down too much on their flavor. I'll skip that next time. Otherwise, excellent, yummy recipe. Thanks, Bob!

I made them for a family dinner and everyone asked for the recipe.  It mas\de too much sausage mixture, but I just froze it for another time along with the rest of the sauce.  I cut the very tips of the peppers to let the air out, and just stuffed them with my fingers.  I also topped the peppers with provolone cheese in the last 8 minutes.

This recipe is great! So easy and tastes wonderful. I didn't boil the peppers though because I thought that may make them a little too soft. That worked fine. I actually made these twice over the weekend so the first time I left them in the oven for maybe 1 hr and 15 minutes. Worked fine and the peppers were tender. Also took the advice and added shredded mozarella over the top. Delicious!

Just made this recipe again.  I used 8 large marconi (sweet Italian peppers) peppers from my garden.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, this size seems to make exactly the right amount of meat mixture.  My peppers were between 6 & 8 inches long.  Once again, this is an awesome recipe.  It fills the house with such a wonderful aroma.  Thanks Bob for sharing!!!!!

YUMMMMY! These were REALLY good! I did make a few changes to makle it a little easier on myself. I used jarred sauce, but still added all the extras. I also covered them while baking untill just before the end to keep the sauce from getting too dried up. They turned out great and everyone loves them.

These were a little more time consuming, but worth it.  Great to do on a Sunday afternoon watching football.

I made this for dinner last night with a few changes.  I used red bell peppers rather than the banana peppers because that's what I had on hand.  I also used feta cheese instead of the parmesan and rice instead of bread crumbs.  My husband didn't think he'd like it, but he really did.  With the extra filling I baked it in a loaf pan and served it with the extra tomato sauce.  It was very good!

Excellent!  My entire family loved them.  My mother's garden was over-flowing with peppres, so glad I found this recipe.
