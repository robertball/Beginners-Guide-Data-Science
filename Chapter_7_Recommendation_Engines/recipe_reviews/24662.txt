I made this dip for a christmas party and a new years party as a dip for pigs in a blanket...i received RAVE reviews.  It was different, but very good.  It wasnt' as spicy as i thought i would be which was good for the guest that can't handle a lot of spice...i WILL make it again!!!

This is very good, I however can't have quite that much spice, so I used half hot mustard and half prepared mustard and it is still delicious...
