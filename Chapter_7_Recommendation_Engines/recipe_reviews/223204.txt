Great! I made with Mini Cheesecakes III from this site.  This recipe definitely makes more than what is needed for 12 mini cheesecakes.  The only thing I did different was puree the strawberries and juice in the first step as opposed to straining it.  This made the sauce less translucent (and maybe less perfectly pretty), but was still delicious, and I felt better about not wasting those great strawberries!

This was so easy and simple.  My first strawberry pie and it was DELICIOUS!  Make sure to use fresh strawberries in season.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this recipe with a class of first graders to make strawberry turnovers by filling puff pastry squares.  They especially loved mashing the strawberries.  It is literally so easy a six-year-old can do (most of) it.

As written it was good enough to tweet.  It was soupy and a tad too sweet.  The second time I made it, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 C.   For the 1 C, of strawberries, I used my Magic Bullet. No need to strain! I used 4 T, of cornstarch = gelled perfectly!  It even sliced perfectly.

Gosh...very easy!  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I  pulverized the strawberries with my cuisinart stick blender, then strained it for seeds.  I used all the pur√©e.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This pie tasted very good, but was soupy. Disappointed because the pie didn't set right and had to be scooped out with a spoon. I used 1/2 cup sugar because I read reviews that said it was too sweet. I wouldn't think that the sugar reduction would make it soupy. This recipe is a topping not a pie filler. Would be perfect on strawberry shortcake. 1/2 cup of sugar made this plenty sweet and I'm glad I didn't add the 3/4 cup.

I thought the glaze was very good however, it was a little to sweet for me I think next time I'll decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Used 1/2 cup coconut sugar instead of white because its way more healthy. Turned it an ugly brown color but I don't care much about that. I also kept the mashed strawberries and mixed them in. Also use potato starch instead of gmo corn starch.

Delicious! I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used a homemade pie crust. Great to make ahead because it needs plenty of time to set if you are making pie.

I made this today, and it was awesome, I did make a mistake, I had to add two more tbsp. of corn starch, but it turned out perfect. I love this recipe because you don't use jello and I really did not want to use jello in the recipe, it was a great and easy way to make strawberry pie!!! I did not use all the sugar that was in the recipe our strawberries in CA. are very sweet anyways. Hope this helps, and TY for the recipe. :-)

This recipe was great when it was fresh, but I tried freezing to use later and that was a mistake. The colour changed and it tasted more bitter (as if I'd used over-ripe strawberries). This would be great for immediate use.

3.14 Pi day!! Made this on a last minute whim for Pi day, start to finish (including baking pie shell) was 30min. Easy to make with great fresh strawberry flavor! Made as written except I pureed the mashed strawberries in my food processor and didn't strain off pulp (means filling is opaque vs. clear). My strawberries we not super sweet so used 3/4 c. of sugar which made it plenty sweet (suggest using less sugar, maybe 1/2 to 2/3 c. Definitely will make again.

Really good!  I made this for fry pies, and it's perfect. Not so juicy that it leaks out. I didn't mash the strawberries first...I mashed them slightly in the pot, and they stayed chunky.

This pie filling is AMAZING!! I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime and it still turned out delicious! I put it on ice cream one night and waffles the next morning! Do yourself a favor and make this simple, versatile, incredible dessert topping!

I used this recipe to make rhubarb strawberry cobbler.  It is so much better than using the canned filling.  The only thing I do different is that I do not drain and discard the mashed strawberries..I keep them in!

I have made this so many times and used it for strawberry pie, as well as a topping for cheesecake and ice cream. Easy and delicious. Best part is you can easily adjust it to your liking if you want it more or less sweet. You can also make it thicker by adding a tad more corn starch. Perfect and the only strawberry topping/filling recipe I use. I never strain the mashed berries after cooking though!

Delicious,  I just finished making it, the only note I would add is that it would be better with a tbsp less of corn starch. The strawberry juice really thickened up nicely on its own. We also added blueberries and raspberries to the mix. We did 3 cups of strawberries, 1 cup of raspberries and 1/2 cup of blueberries.

Amazing, easy pie. Fruit can easily be swapped out to make just about any flavor. Yum!

this pie filling recipe did the job since i couldnt find the lucky leaf strawberry pie filling. i used this for my strawberry rolls with lemon zest cream cheese. the only issue i had was this this recipe can be a pain to make. i still dont understand how to seperate the pulp feom the juice from the mixture. 
either way...i made it work.

Easy and couldn't believe the flavor.  Donated this to the church for sale at our fair food stand and it flew out the door.  Everyone loved it.  Will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

Simple and tasty!  I used this recipe for a cheesecake topping and we ate through the cheesecake very fast!
