I love this recipe. One thing that should be mentioned though when using fondant. You have to put a thin layer of frosting on the cake first if you want the fondant to stick. Using the canned stuff is fine. Just make sure its not the "whipped" kind. For some reason it doesnt hold very well. And dont glob it on like youre normally frosting a cake. Just a very thin layer.

This is the first time I ever used fondant, and I am pleasantly suprised with the results.  Here's a tip for those who can't figure out how to get it on the cake -- roll the fondant between sheets of wax paper and then reverse roll it onto the rolling pin with a layer of wax paper on the fondant.  I just rolled it off the roller and then peeled the wax paper off.  It came out looking great!

good recipe - TIPS: Sift the powdered sugar into the mixture, don't dump it all at once otherwise you get lumps.  The more you knead, the better & smoother the texture. Don't be tempted to add too much powdered sugar because its more prone to cracking.  It takes practice :)

WoW..... This is what I've been looking for...Super easy to make, sometimes it needs a little more XXX sugar...I leave it sit for aleast 2 hour..it helps with that greasy texture... I use a 20 qt. the Kitchen Aid can't handle the load, so if you use a Kitchen Aid you have to get the dough out ASAP and you have to kneed it longer.. and sit longer because it will get super soft.. as far as rolling it out.. try letting it sit for about 5 minutes before you punch out shapes and or lifting the icing 

Thanks for the Recipe

Jeff

I made this and it did crack a little, but it got the job done. I rolled it out onto parchment paper, which made it easier to pick up and flip onto the cake. It doesn't add anything spectacular to the cake taste-wise, but the main purpose of fondant is to sit there and look pretty, which this does. Also, for measuring purposes - I made 1/3 of the recipe, and it did well covering a 9-inch round one-layer cake.

This was my first time ever making fondant, and it came out very well. The recipe was easy to follow and tasted great as well. I also added some food coloring and it worked like a charm. Very Easy!!

I really liked this recipe. It's the first time I'd ever made fondant. I used more powdered sugar than it called for, regular vanilla extract and butter. It wasn't as white as some fondant, but it warked for the dogwood cookies I made. I got lots of great remarks on the taste! I will stick with this fondant recipe!

This is a FUN recipe!  I was definitely be using again.  It rolled out very smooth, but I did have trouble when I went to drape it over my cake.  I think I will need to add more sugar next time to make it even more stiff.

I make cakes professionally, this is one of the better recipes. It was great to use, I did add one of my standby ingredients for rolled fondant - a bag of marshmellows, melted - combine with the other ingredients, it makes for a more elastic/pliable fondant!

This fondant is really good with just a couple changes. First, I used unsalted butter at room temperature instead of shortening. If you don't want to use butter, you should add some butter flavoring or mix shortening with margarine. Secondly, I used a bit less corn syrup than called for (about 2/3 cup). I have to say, it is really tasty--it does taste like buttercream (though I don't know if it would be as good without the butter or at least some butter flavor). Also, be sure not to over-knead it in your mixer or it will become a little greasy, and you'll have to add more powdered sugar. Stop mixing when it starts to stick to your bread hook.

I have spent an ENORMOUS amount of time in the past four years working with the fondant recipe on all my cakes, and have had as much success with it as I have frustration. Since it doesn't have any agent like gelatin or glycerol in it it doesn't firm up or hold shape like other fondants; work very carefully to avoid ripping and stretching, and don't expect to do any figure work with it. Also, it is very greasy and does not keep well, sometimes even leaving grease rings on cake boards it's left on.

That being said, for the simple ingredients required and the sweet buttery taste-far superior to any typical fondant flavor-this is a wonderful, inexpensive alternative to store-bought.

The only tips I really have are, A)Make sure your fondant is stiff enough. Pick up a chunk out of your mixer and see if it drags and stretches when you dangle it. B) If you want to color your fondant, add the dye in with the corn syrup, (I'd say 2-3 tsp worth), and save yourself lots of kneading!!!

I have made this a few different times.  With all the hype of the Cake shows, my 8 yr old and my 10 yr old wanted a fancy cake for their birthdays.  I made a practice batch and it was great, but very greasy.  So for the 1st birthday cake which was my 8yr olds, it was a little better but still somewhat greasy, by the time I made my 10yr olds cake I feel like a expert!  Ha Ha!  But the trick is to cut the Shortening in half, and refridgerate at least a couple days before applying it to a cake.  It taste wonderful and EVERYBODY loves it!!  I've heard some stories about how bad fondant taste, but not this!!  But you do need a thin layer of icing too!  Hope this helps!!

There are quite a few 'greasy' remarks here but then it's most likely because they handled it too much with bare hands, or in an unsuitable temperature setting that would soften and let the oily stuff come out.  I tried this recipe and it was PERFECT. A great alternative to using gelatin in fondant. Not all recipes can or should be used to the dot - work around it a bit, adding or subtracting as you find it suitable. Granted in baking it needs to be perfect but hey - for icing and the likes, loosen up. Be creative. :)  If you use all-butter, then add 2 tbsps of cornstarch. Otherwise, in warm weather use shortening (though you will sacrifice on the taste a bit).  Fantastic recipe!!

I'm giving this four stars because I really liked the taste & that's as important to me as appearance on a cake.  However, as others have noted the greasiness was really an issue.  What I ended up doing was after getting the fondant on the cake and everything set up, I lightly brushed the cake with powdered sugar just until it blended.  This worked kinda like makeup powder -- a little extra powder on the surface to cover up the shine.  When finished my cake didn't look greasy at all.

Okay my five stars are for the changes I made to this recipe.  I cannot rate the recipe itself as I have not made it comletely that way.  Instead of using a full cup of shortening, I used 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of unflavored gelatin. Also in addition to the tsp of vanilla I added 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring. This gave it more of a buttercream flavor without adding all the extra grease.  I have never made fondant before and am SOOO happy with the flavor and texture of how this turned out.  Next time I will experiment with 1 cup of gelatin and NO shortening.

For those looking into a nice fondant with everday ingredients, you have found it. I am aware of the reviews as I read almost 10 pages before I nervously gave this a try. I think that patience is the key as well as awareness of texture. I think silky playdough is the best way to describe the ideal texture. You need to keep in mind that you are adding sugar when you roll it out and that you can “dull” the finish with even more sugar……if you feel the need, so if it could use more, it's ok, it will get it in later steps.  If you do add too much sugar, splash a little extra corn syrup to thin it out. If you’ve added an extra pound of sugar, try a quarter cup of extra fat and keep playing with ratios. The secret here is to keep track of what you are adding so you can use the original recipe as a guage to know where you are as far as proportion goes. Humidity, patience, common sense and ego all play a part in your success with this recipe. Cooking is a science, literally. This would be an extremely tedious recipe to use for a wedding cake or anything large and intricate, but if you are willing to make pieces ahead and let them dry (think buttermints), and give your finished product plenty of TLC this is do-able (and far tastier, which is the point right?) My hubby’s birthday is tomorrow, and I now know I don’t have the time to do what I wanted to do….but next b-day, I know to start a week or so ahead so I can dry my little men and chainsaws out. Anything you want to hold a 3-D shap

I love this recipe! I usually peel fondant off of cakes because I can't stand the taste and texture, but this stuff tastes great - and is very easy to work with. It's so pliable that I was able to roll it to less than 1/16" thickness and use it to cover 1" round petit fours. By rolling it between two layers of waxed paper and popping it into the freezer for a minute before draping it over the petit fours, it worked like a charm.

This was my first time making or using fondant and I was very pleased with how easy this was! A friend who came to help me make it into Calla Lilies (and has worked with fondant many times)  commented on how it was the perfect consistency.  It can also be refrigerated or frozen for later use which I find super convenient! Oh...and I didn't have clear vanilla extract on hand so I used 1/2 tsp of almond extract and it worked well.

This is truly a controversial recipe here at All Recipes.com.  I examined the ingredients listed prior to making this recipe, twice. From my understanding of the ingredients I was skeptical about the 4 and 5 star ratings and some of the claims for the recipes application to real kitchen usability.  There was a number of reviewing bakers with experience levels that warranted my attention to the strong criticism. 

My goal was a chocolate fondant to be placed as a "sheet" on top of a Parker House Boston Cream Pie. 

The first time I followed the"Rolled Butter Cream Fondant" recipe exactly as written.  I found it completely unusable.  The taste of uncooked shortening and the greasy consistency made it inedible and impossible to roll out as a typical fondant.  I used a chilled marble top and specialty rolling pin and I was not able to obtain anything close to the texture of a chilled fondant for wrapping a cake.  

The only possible use for this recipe would be for details on a "faux" cake for display.  

The second time I attempted several modifications suggested by some of the 4 and 5 star reviewers.  Even with partially replacing butter for half the shortening and modifying the amount of the corn syrup with powdered sugar left the results as unpalatable and unable to roll out to a thin sheet.  How anyone could claim this as a true fondant or even as an acceptable replacement is beyond me.  

I went back to my tried and true marshmallow based fondant recipe from All Recipes.

This is the first time I have worked with fondant.  It worked fine but the thing I did not like was the taste.  I would not cover a whole cake with it.  I am not sure if all fondant tastes this way.....

5 stars for taste, 4 stars for ease of rolling/covering a layer cake, 3 stars for ease of use otherwise. This fondant tastes great--not like plastic--and was pretty easy to work with when rolling out and covering a simple layer cake.  I also really liked that the list of ingredients was simple and did not contain gelatin (I am a vegetarian and most fondants contain animal products by way of the gelatin).  However, I wanted to make molded designs (specifically, a small snowman cake topper) and this fondant is simply too soft to hold up well for anything 3-D.  I had to keep returning the pieces I was working with to the fridge to harden them so that I could assemble my snowman without him going flat, and the finished product had to be stored in the refrigerator.  I was able to make small round balls to edge the cake, but anything with a diameter larger than that of a quarter just went flat at room temperature.  I tried working in more powdered sugar to the fondant I was using for molding, but if I got it stiff enough to hold its shape the fondant cracked.  Couldn't find the middle ground.    Overall, I did like this recipe, and I will use it again to cover cakes.  Just not for molded shapes!

For those who get cracks, use some shortening on your fingers to smooth them out and perfect!

This was my first time making fondant, and I am very pleased with the results. After reading many reviews for this recipe, I used a little over 1/2 c of non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening, and made sure the corn syrup and shortening were well creamed before adding the powdered sugar. I found the mix easy to roll out between 2 pieces of waxed paper with my marble rolling pin. I rolled it to 1/8 inch, and could have gone thinner. It was easy to stretch for shaping. The fondant did not crack. I colored some of the mix, and had no problems getting the shades I needed. The fondant had a very mild sheen, quite pretty, and not shiny or greasy appearing.  I will use this recipe again!

I love the taste of this fondant. Definately easy with simple ingredients but I too found this crumbles. Rolling and laying over the cake is simple but the corners tend to crack after laying the fondant on the cake. I found that this fondant is not as elastic as that from Wilton. Not sure if there is something that could be added to this recipe to make it hold together better i.e. more elasticity. I will definately try this again to see if I can get that elasticity I am looking for since this is such a yummy recipe.

This was my first time using any type of fondant and it was exhilarating!  I had so much fun with this recipe.  I used it for a two-layered 9 x 13 cake so I doubled the recipe.  Since there were so many greesy reviews I halfed the shortening which is the only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Also took care in how much confectioners' sugar I added to avoid the cracking.  As soon as the fondant felt a bit plado'ish I let it be (probably had about 2 cups left of sugar).  I added the food gel to make the color I needed and kneeded it by hand.  When I eventually rolled it out I used corn starch to smooth out the fondant over the cake.  It looked great and tasted great... everyone thought I bought it!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My first review! This recipe was so easy AND it really worked. Followed exactly. The most helpful hints from other  reviewers: make sure to lightly frost cake first and roll on mat/wax paper to assist with transfer to cake. Some say dust with powdered sugar, others said cornstarch. I think cornstarch was a little more effective and was absorbed better for a more polished finish. To add color, use a small amount of frosting dye and knead in until uniform. Thanks for such a great, easy and inexpensive (compared to the pre-prepared store bought stuff) recipe. Can't wait to try it again.

My first time ever using Fondant and this worked beautifully.  It was easy to use.  I used the 1 cup stick of butter flavored crisco.  It wasn't greasy at all.

I read all of the reviews and noticed a stark difference:  reviewers either LOVED it and it was "easy" or they loathed it and it didn't work.  Of course, I was sure I would be one of those for whom it worked easily.  Not so much.  I can't fault the recipe because I'm more apt to believe it was a user error on my part (but perhaps the recipe could be a little more explicit?).  I received some help/moral support (TY PAM) on the RE and finally "made it work", in the words of Tim Gunn, but it wasn't pretty.  I *think* I'll try this again because I hate to let anything get the best of me.  UPDATE: I feel the need to add this was VERY easy to work with for cut outs!  The difficult part was covering the cake.  So, if you're just looking to use it for cut outs, don't be intimidated at all-that part was easy!

I am no cake expert, but I do decorate a few every year even though traditional decorating takes its toll on my back. I have always liked the smooth look of fondant cakes, but was not thrilled with the taste and ingredients of the store-bought type. 

I made shaped cake for my daughter's birthday. I used a thin layer of buttercream icing to glue the fondant to the cake, then I placed the cake in the freezer overnight. That night I made the fondant, but I substituted an organic palm oil shortening (no hydrogenated oils/no trans fats) and left it covered at room temperature.

In the morning, I kneaded coloring into the fondant, which was greasy as the others have said, but it did seem to change its consistency, as I kneaded it, to be less greasy. I rolled it out between wax paper sheets which made transferring to the frozen cake a bit easier for the largest piece.

I think the fondant complements ice cream better than sweeter icings, and who doesn't have ice cream with their cake? Best of all, the decorating was fun, done in record time, and with no backache. I am looking forward to my next fondant cake adventure with this recipe!

Ok I have mixed reviews here. Because, 1st-This is the 2nd time I have made buttercream fondant, hoping that it would turn out this time, and I STILL had the same problem. It was NOT SMOOTH. I could not keep it from being crumbly. I doubled checked my measurements, and I did EVERYTHING right. Both times. I will agree I LOVE THE FLAVOR of Buttercream Fondant, especially when draping over buttercream frosting, but when its not smooth and pretty, its not worth it. So that's why I rate this 2 stars. Good flavor, but HORRIBLE consistency. Its just not smooth.

A little hard to get the right consistency but I placed it in the oven to speed up the "drying" process.  Flavor is good.  Incredients are things you have around the home...I think a recipe with gumpaste turns out better but with what it has in it this is an amazing concept!

As a semi-pro cake maker (4 or 5 custom cakes a month) I was looking for a good fondant recipe to replace the marshmallow fondant that I've been using.  This looked good, so I tried it, but...after following the recipe PRECISELY I wound up with a greasy, semi-soft ball of stuff that really bears no resemblance to fondant.  The consistency is more similiar to very stiff buttercream frosting than to soft fondant, which makes sense, given the amount of liquids in the recipe.  I can literally squeeze a handful through my fingers.  Either some or all of my ingredients were bad, or the recipe is lacking, not sure which.

EASY and delicious!!!! This was my very first time working with fondant, and my cake was EPIC! I was able to decorate one large "perry the platypus" cake, and 3 small ones to match. I used cocoa powder to make brown for his tail, and the flavor was unbelievable! I highly recommend finding an excuse to make chocolate :) just omit a little powdered sugar and replace with equal amount cocoa powder until you get the shade you want. I've made two more cakes since, and recipe has consistent results. Just make sure you refrigerate (I made mine a day in advance), and use canned frosting in a very thin layer to stick better to the cake, and you'll rock out a cake that will look like a million bucks!

I like this better then store bought fondant because it's sweeter, but not too sweet (for me at least).

I make 1/4 of this recipe at a time- it can't be scaled to that using the 45 servings, but here it is:

1/4 cup corn syrup
1/4 cup shortening
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
8 ounces 10x sugar BY WEIGHT

I don't know what the 8 ounces 10x sugar is equal to in dry measurements- I use a digital scale to measure out exactly 8.0 oz. I use imitation vanilla extract- yea, I know, it's dark and not clear, but I can't even notice the difference in color from such a small amount. I mix this by hand with a spatula- the corn syrup and shortening first, add the salt and vanilla, and then fold in the 10x sugar gradually. I make sugar cookies using cookie cutters, and then use the same cookie cutters to cut the rolled out fondant to match. I put the fondant on top of cookies using corn syrup as an adhesive.

This was so easy, and unlike many other fondant recipes it did not require any chill time.  I got so many compliments on how delicious it was!  It cuts easily and takes gel food color really well.  This is my new go-to recipe for fondant!

i love this recipe! it's so easy to make & taste so so much better and way better texture than store made, the first time i made it i hated it. the second time it worked like a charm! use sugar that says confectioners powdered sugar. do NOT use anything that says 1ox it will make the fondant gummy cracked, and it sweats and falls apart! and use salted real butter for a great taste!

I have used this recipe several times.  It gets 5 stars for the taste!!  It is the BEST fondant recipe for taste that I've ever had.  The small downfall is, it can be difficult to work with.  But, with a little practice, it can taste and look great!!

I think this recipe is GREAT for smaller projects, like cut-outs, making small animals or people or shapes out of it for the cake.  However I don't think I would use this recipe to cover an entire cake, or if I did it would definitely take some practice.  I was also worried after reading the reviews about how some people said it was too greasy.  I cut the recipe exactly in half, and although it was pretty greasy, to me the secret is to refrigerate the fondant overnight.  The day I made it, it was glistening and very greasy to the point where I wanted to wipe it off on a paper towel.  But after it set up in the fridge overnight, that wasn't a problem at all.  And if you do have any pieces that are too shiny, just rub them with some powdered sugar and they will look more matte right away.  BUT let me say this!!  The taste is FABULOUS! especially compared to other fondants.  I would like to play with this some more because this is a fondant I actually wouldn't mind covering a cake with.  But as the recipe is now, I don't see how you could lift it up off your work surface in one piece and get it onto a cake.  It is just too sticky, even after a night in the fridge.  I feel like this recipe is on the right track, just needs something to help with the stickiness.  Cornstarch maybe? I don't know. :)

This recipe did not work out for me at all! I followed the recipe and directions, but all I got was super greasy fondant that just broke apart. It wasn't even dry and it was still breaking. Not good at all. I had to use a new recipe and toss this fondant out.   :(

This was very easy to make and tasted better than a lot of the other types of fondant I have used. Although, it kept cracking and tearing when I tried to place it on the cake. Letting it sit in the refrigerator to cool for awhile helped.

Best recipe EVER with one correction!!!  I originally rated this a "3" because I had the problem of the fondant becoming too greasy or it would crack.  The magic ingredient that turns great tasting fondant into great tasting AND great looking fondant is... FONDANT STABILIZER (Also known as: Sodium Carboxy Methyl Cellulose)!!! Directions: Prepare fondant recipe as normal.  In separate bowl mix 2 tsp fondant stabilizer with 1/2 cup hot water.  Will form into a gel.  Mix into fondant and add about half a bad of powder sugar.  PRESTO!  You have amazing tasting fondant that also tastes delicious!  I hope this helps all the newbies like me!!!  :D

I didn't use this fondant to cover a cake and in truth it would probably be too sweet for that. What I wanted was something with the consistency of clay without using all the hard to find ingredients. If you want to decorate your cake with knights and dragons, this is the fondant for you!! It's moldable and holds it's form and excepts colors nicely. This recipe make a TON of fondant though so expect extra.
Just a note, all the corn syrup makes the fondant a bit oily and, while this isn't a problem most of the time, in summer temperatures, the fondant tends to melt.

Great tasting fondant.  I substituted butter for half of the shortening.  I have a home cake business and before trying this recipe I always advised my clients to avoid fondant unless they were very set on the fondant look.

I have to say I used this fondant a few times and every time I had to replace it and use something different, it is very greasy and falls apart way to easily.  It is definitely a nice easy fondant recipe without all the artificial ingredients (glucose, glycerin etc.) And also it tastes great! It is just to greasy and hard to apply.

I made this last night the flavor was good, although when I went to roll the fondant out it would not work it was soft and it kept breaking and sticking. I kept adding confectioners sugar but it just would not work.i read somewhere today you are supposed to let the fondant sit at least 8 hours. That would've been nice to know so I wouldn't have gotten so frustrated.

Much, much, much better than store-bought fondant. This tastes like marshmallow, and even if you don't plan on eating the fondant, it's nice to know it's actually edible unlike the pre-made stuff. Definitely take the time to knead this fondant quite a bit - otherwise it will just tear as you wrap it around a cake.

Excellent flavor! Very easy to roll. I'm sure with more practice I can make it smoother...this was my first try. I'm not sure what consistency to make it in order for it to make shapes better.

Well I tried to ignore all the bad reviews and made this anyway.... sorry to day they were right.  I could not get this fondant strong enough to actually cover my cake.  I had to resort to my old standby, Marshmallow Fondant.  I did however use the fondant for the decorations on the cake.  But if you need the fondant to do more than just lay on the cake, you will be disappointed.  I did try chilling the fondant. It still was not strong enough.  I followed the recipe exactly. The fondant did taste good, but as others said it became greasy after a while.  Wish I could have used it the way I wanted. Hope others have better luck!

This fondant recipe is a staple for any aspiring pastry chef or just the family birthday cake baker.  It's much tastier than other fondant that I've had and easy to dye.  Just add food coloring and knead like dough.  Continue to add more until you get the desired shade.

I used this on my brother's wedding cake, and everyone thought it was fantastic.  My only complaint is I had to add some extra confectioner's sugar because the fondant was very greasy.  However, with this small change, it was wonderful.

First off:  I love this recipe.  Mine tasted great (though I used 1/4 t. each almond and orange extracts) and was much easier to mix than I thought.  I don't have a decent mixer (it overheats w/ cake batter!!!) so I mixed it my hand.  It's easier than kneading bread dough, so no big deal for me.  I am currently letting it chill out in my freezer (no time!!!) because it's very warm in NE right now.  But I can't wait to roll it out and put it on my cake!!!  One tip I do have:  read all the reviews or at least most of them.  I found it was easier to watch others' mistakes.  And I always sift my ingredients.  For frosting, I actually will sift no less than three times and for this one I did it 5 times.  Good luck, and read the reviews before you start!!

I have tried this recipe taste really good but cracked all the time I rolled it. It was oily and difficult to work with. I followed the recipe exactly and  ended up adding tons of sugar to make it work. Finally, it is still didn't work. Don't waste your time.

This recipe is slightly flawed. If you use the icing sugar as it tells you to, it will end up Much to sweet and greasy. Substitute a little bit of icing sugar for cake flour and this makes it a lovely fondant.  When dying it, be careful not to handle it to much for it WILL MELT. 

Happy Cooking!

this is a simple to make and relatively easy to use fondant. i would recommend you count on using a tad more powdered sugar, and put it in the freezer to chill for a bit before you roll it out with a generous dusting of more powdered sugar.   my cake came out gorgeous and i didnt need any odd ingredients like glycerin.   oh, and this stuff is *forgiving* very much so. i had a large tear on one side of my cake and was able to  use my fingers and a bit of water to smooth it out and then added a bit more powdered sugar and kept smoothing away til it was gone.   the freezer is your friend, if its droopy, freeze it and work on it in another ten minutes.

I have never made fondant before and was very hesitant because everyone I know said that fondant tastes awful and they usually peel it off before they tast the cake. This recipe said it tastes just like frosting so I tried it and it does. It tastes just like buttercream frosting! Great! It is a little bit greasy but very easy to work with. I added food coloring after I made the primary batch. I have already recommended this recipe and will continue to make it in the future. Great recipe!

I made this tonight for a practice cake for my son's birthday. I thought the fondant was too sweet. I also could not get the fondant to lift up as one big sheet to drape over my cake, it cracked and broke in several places. I ended up having to use many pieces to cover the cake and try to fuse them together once on the cake. Next time, I will try the parchment paper idea and see if that works any better. And until I've mastered this fondant stuff, I think I'll leave my son's birthday cake to the pros :)

I have gotten many recipes from here but have never commented on them or rated them. I had to leave a comment on this fondant! It is absolutley wonderful! The taste is amazing, very easy to make, and is very very easy to work with! I used this on all of my Christmas sugar cookies and it is awesome! I used gel coloring and it worked great! This is a must try!! You will LOVE this recipe!

Followed the directions exactly but it was still on the liquid side so I just added confectioner's sugar until it was more doughy. Biggest problem was it melting while I tried to get it cut, but I solved that by rolling it and then freezing it until was hard enough to simply transfer over to the cake. Very yummy and a big hit!

I gave this 4 stars because it was very easy and quick to make and easy to handle.  I used it to decorate sugar cookies.  The taste was fine but there is one thing that I can't stand about it, it is so greasy!  I actually took a paper towel and laid it over one of the cookies and it instantly started sucking up grease, and it was still greasy after that...plus, pressing the top with a paper towel ruins the smooth surface.  I also don't know if I needed to do this, but someone suggested painting some regular frosting on the cake or cookie so the fondant would stick, I just painted on some corn syrup and that seemed to work.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time just because of the grease factor.

I followed the directions exactly and the fondant came out very greasy, so I tried it again and it came out the same way. I added more confectioner sugar (about another two pounds) but it never thicken up. This recipe is easy to make, but it didn’t come out like it should. I do not know what others (that love this recipe) are doing different, but I would like to know their secret.   I gave it two stars because even though it didn't come out right (after trying twice) it still tastes nice!

Finally a fondant that doesn't taste like Play-Doh!  Didn't have any problems kneading it since I was using my Kitchenaid.  Makes up fast, takes color well, quite easy to work with.  Be sure to use an ample dusting of confectioners sugar when you are rolling this out since it is a bit oilier than regular fondant, but that little concession is easy to do when you get a great looking cake as an end result.

This was my first fondant experience and it turned out well. It made SO MUCH! I dyed the dough black to make darth vador heads for cupcakes for my sons class. It was greasy and time consuming but well worth the hassle. By the way...I agree with original recipe and people's comment about sifting sugar.

I really liked this fondant!  The taste is a TON better than Wilton's fondant, it really does taste like buttercream frosting!  I also found it much less chewy than Wilton brand.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used this to cover cut out cookies and it was very easy to work with.  It was a little on the greasy side but dusting with powdered sugar helped.  I can see where it might be a challenge to cover a cake with it as it is very pliable and prone to tearing, but with a little effort I'm sure it can be done - and I can't wait to try!
***EDIT:  Last night I tried using this fondant to cover a 12x2" square cake and I couldn't get it to work out for me.  No matter how much powdered sugar I used it would always fall apart when I tried to lift it, and I wasn't even rolling it very thin.  However, it tastes AWESOME so I'm going to try it again on a smaller cake.  And I'll definitely still use it for cutouts!

Cool recipe. It tastes really good and is easy to make. THe only problem I had was transfering it from the counter to the cake. It completely flopped. But I tried rolling it out again, this time not as thin as before. Worked Awesome! I now know what to do next time. Roll it out thicker!

I have never had so much trouble with anything. First it was too stiff, then we played with it for a while to soften it up, THEN when we lifted it up to place on the cake, it ripped- but if its too thick it cant be smoothed together. Finally the cake was finished and it looked remotely good however this recipe is either faulty  or you all are miracle workers.

I made this with my eight-year-old after being disappointed with store-bought fondant. It was very easy to make and tastes *good*.  I added food coloring to it to decorate my son's birthday cake and I love it.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Amazing! I will never make birthday cakes the same again. My son trey wanted a Jake and Neverland pirate cake....I always make our cakes but when making my own icing it would always bleed or blend the picture. Found this recipe and loved all the tips everyone wrote helped ALOT: rolling f.icing in between 2wax papers making it easier to roll flat and not stick. 2. Use Betty crocker Gel colors cake decorators in order to dye the icing . I made fondant then divided in bowls and added colors needed in each bowl. 3. Take time don't rush! I stayed up until 3 am. All kids sleeping plenty of time to work. Love this recipe and way it makes cake look smooth.

I am making my wedding cake and I started out using a Amish recipe... Keyword Started. By the time I got done it looked like Marshmallow cream. Then I looked this recipe up and in about 10 Minutes I had the perfect fondant and it tastes great. However it took about 2 cups more of the sugar to get it just right. But hey not everything is perfect the first go around. From now on this is definitely my recipe of choice when making this.

This was my first time making fondant and I chose this recipe because it seemed much easier than the others I looked at. It turned out wonderful and delicious! It did start to look pretty greasy so I substituted about 1/4 of the sugar for flour. The flour didn't take any sweetness away and made it less greasy. I found it very easy to work with. Next time I make it I might try using a little less corn syrup. Overall I will most certainly be using this recipe again!

Super shiny, not a great taste (but slightly better than store bought taste), cracks easily, and really greasy. Did I mention how shiny it is? Too bad I'm stuck with it now. Find another fondant recipe!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it was perfect!!! I made a Super Mario cake for my son and attached the cut-outs by lightly 'painting' some water on the back and sticking them to the cake. First time ever decorating a cake. AWESOME RECIPE!!!!

This is the easiest rolled butter cream I've ever worked with!  I did have a few issues with the fondant looking greasy (had to knead it some more in extra powdered sugar), and it was quite heavy the it tore on the back side of my cake.  This may also be due to my lack of experience in working with fondant.  I used it to cover a round base cake for a 3-D teddy bear, wearing a diaper for a baby shower.  I also cut out squares of the fondant and bunched them up under the bear to look like baby blankets.  The cake came out beautifully, and I received tons of compliments.  The only thing I changed was to add an extra tsp. of vanilla and a full tsp. of POPCORN salt (not regular salt, as this would be very salty).  I use popcorn salt in my other butter cream recipes, and it really helps to balance out the sweetness and bring out the flavor from the extracts.

This was my first time using fondant. I found that it was easy to roll out , but after working w/ it for a while it got a bit greasy. I'd use a bit less shortening than the recipe calls. Also I chilled it for about 30 minutes before rolling it out so it wouldn't be sticky. I'm definitely using it again in the future!

I wanted to try a new recipe for fondant just to get creative. This one sounded simple and had a lot of good reviews so I gave it a try. It was just terrible to work with. The taste was perfect, but it was too sticky, then too dry... it rolled out fine at first but when you tried to lift it, it just broke into pieces. I then let it chill again and tried working with it later and it continued to crack and break apart. I have worked with fondant before and this was a disappoinment.

This was my second battle with using fondant and first battle making my own. As beautiful as fondant can make cakes it is still a fight using it. I loved this fondant recipe. It was easy to make and tasted great. Was still a battle laying over the cakes but that's to be expected with fondant. I used massive amounts of powdered sugar because my fondant was very moist but it still tasted great and though i'm never one to pat my own back, my cake looked amazing. I was so thrilled and proud when i handed my brother his cake and my whole family was amazed at how beautiful it came out. My only grudge was with dying the fondant red. My kitchen looked like a butchers and my nails and cuticles were stained for nearly three weeks. Awesome recipe. Thank you so much

it tastes great but the fondant came out way too greasy and constantly cracked and tore while being applied to the cake. some type of gum and less fat  may make this better but i think i save this recipe for emergency appliques only.

The fondant was DELICIOUS! I sneak a small bite of whatever is left! I did add quite a bit more powdered sugar to it while i was making it and while using it because it would get stuck to the table at times but  otherwise its a GREAT receipe!( its great with molding and with laying over cake! )

Tastes great!  Easy to make!  I make cakes for every special occassion.  I don't like the taste of pre-made marshmallow fondant so I decided to try this.  It tastes wonderful...just like bakery buttercream icing.  It is a little more challenging to work with.  I used a stand mixer and it came together beautifully.  Then refrigerated overnight and rolled out between parchment paper.  While it is harder to work with it's much easier to repair/patch than other fondants I've worked with.  I did notice with my test cake that if left out on the counter it tends to sweat.  That can be remedied by dusting with powdered sugar.  I kept my final product chilled before presentation.  Also it tends to be glossy.  If you prefer a matte look the dusting of powdered sugar can fix that too.

I have to agree with the review from 8/30/09.  I also followed the directions and it was very greasy - definitely could not cover a cake with it.  I attempted 2 more times adjusting the recipe and increasing the powdered sugar but was still a failed attempt.  It tasted awesome, but...

This fondant is so incredibly easy to work with! I had never made fondant before (I'm huge on buttercream) but I figured I'd give it a shot. I did have to use more confectioner's sugar than called for, but I'm pretty sure that's because I had to add so much food coloring to get my fondant really black. Oh, and I did add 1 tsp of liquid butter flavor. It added SO MUCH to the taste! Wasn't chalky in the slightest! It really did taste like buttercream, which is what I was aiming for. Very, very easy to work with!

I made this for the first time and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I was so intimidated by it and now it's just a breeze. I had heard that fondant was nasty tasting, but this fondant is really good. If I ever need fondant I will use this recipe.

I used this recipe to make the fondant for my wedding cake(which I made myself!) It was a HUGE hit with all 100 guests at the wedding, no one could believe it was homemade. I had a few people ask for the recipe so I shared it with them, and one of them used it on her son's wedding cake, and it was a huge hit with them too! Fantastic recipe!

This was my first time making fondant (or using fondant) and I was really pleased. I followed this recipe like written except I added 1/2 c. shortening and 1/2 c. (1 stick) butter. I sifted the sugar (8 cups and a handful) like other reviewers suggested and added it in a little at a time. I used the dough hook in my kitchen aid and kept it on low as I added the sugar. I used cornstarch on the rolling pin and parchment paper when rolling it out. It was shiny but it didn't bother me...a little bit of cornstarch helped to dull the shine. I also added coloring gel and kneaded it into the dough to make 3-d flowers and then added luster dust on top for a bit of sparkle!...it was definitely an easy recipe and I didn't have any problems with it. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!! I was very nervous because I had never made fondant before. It was yummy too! The only thing I did was sub butter for the shortening. The only reason for not giving this a 5 was I had to used about double the powdered sugar for it to be thick enough to roll. Overall though, I loved this!! Thanks!  I just changed the rating from 4 to a 5 because I just made my 1st 2 tiered cake and because of this recipe I walked away from the party with sooo much pride! Everyone loved it!!!

This tastes really good-like the playdough of your childhood dreams.  I followed recipe exactly the 1st time and it ended up cracking as I placed on cake.  2nd time, I used a bit less powdered sugar.  Although it was a bit greasier, it was more pliable.  Was pleased with the results of my first try at fondant.

Easy to work with but not as pretty as you see on professional cakes.  I found once I rolled out the fondant and cut out the shapes it was impossible to get off the counter without ruining the shape.  I tried again rolling out on waxed paper instead and it worked like a dream.  I knew I was going to hate the taste so I just made enough to decorate a buttercream frosted cake (all butter and no shortening).  1* for taste 3* for presentation 5* for ease.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed. The resulting fondant was greasy (so no porcelain appearance) and couldn't support it's own weight. I added more sugar and some cornstarch and it just failed. Once I got it strong enough to me moved to the cake, it just cracked and fell apart where it draped. It was a complete waste of time and energy. If you want to make fondant out of simple ingredients, try making a marshmallow fondant. I have worked with 3 different fondants and I like the store-bought stuff best, homemade marshmallow is also okay. This stuff, I'd never make again. And it all tastes pretty much the same.

I *loved* this recipe!  I hadn't tried a lot of fondant recipes before this so I was a little nervous!  It was just GREAT!  It is soft but after I mixed it, I just added a little more powdered sugar whenever it felt sticky.  I rolled it out on waxed paper (making sure that the bottom part had a little powdered sugar so it didn't stick) then I put it into the fridge to chill before cutting it out.  Worked like a charm!  I'll definitely keep this recipe in my back pocket!

Pleasantly surprised with this one.  A friend of mine asked me if I could pleasepleasepleaseplease make her wedding cake a week before her wedding came around.  She didn't want a lot, but the tiers I had to make to feed all the people needed some extra reinforcement before I could stack and decorate them, so in desperation I turned to this fondant recipe.  I was thrilled with how it turned out with a minimal of fuss.  It did seem to want to crack a little around the edges, and down here in the humidity I had a heck of a time trying to get it rolled out without mushing it, but once it was in place everything settled beautifully.  I suspect the cracking might have been because the fondant is so heavy and if you make the layers too high it pulls down on itself.  Regardless, I was able to shore it up with a little patting down and some icing sugar.  Just be patient and take your time.  Thanks for this!

I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because I felt like the recipe came out wonderfully. I ended up adding about a pound more confectioner's sugar. Shortening is so bad for us, so I substituted non hydrogenated margarine. I still got the oiliness that everyone talked about, which is why I added in more confectioner's sugar. The 1up mushrooms are fondant. I made them a little over a week before finishing the cake so they would dry and be handle-able. I made my own frosting (non hydrogenated margarine, confectioner's sugar, and a splash of vanilla.), I piped it on with a plastic sandwich bag. This was my first time using fondant, or even seeing it in person. It was like polymer clay, so I had no trouble making the mushrooms. I piped "Happy Mother's Day" on top and and on the side, "and Father's Day". I had some problems with cracking, which is from too much confectioner's sugar. I also had problems picking up the fondant once it was rolled out. Rolling it out on plastic wrap helped a lot, although I got creases from it. Overall the cake looks pretty darn good!

This was terrible. No matter what I did it was too oily and kept falling apart. I should have read the other reviews first. All this made was a mess.

I am just starting to get into baking and cooking as a new hobbie.  I have been researching the use of fondant and came across this recipe.  I made my first cake today using the fondant and it came out great (for my first time). My only complaint is that it was a little greasy and it was a little cracky. Can anyone tell me how to smooth it out and make it less greasy? Thanks!

I didn't mind the greasiness of it but I had the worst time with it. I rolled it out and went to put it on the cake and it ripped. Hmm. Try again. I rolled it out, went to put it on the cake and the sides were so heavy that the sides ripped right off and the top was cracked. I followed the recipe EXACTLY too. What a waste. Now I'm off to make cupcakes for my daughters birthday because this was a gigantic disaster.

I thought this recipe was really easy to make.    Because it was a little greasy I added more powdered sugar and think I souldn't have added so much.  I let the dough rest for an hour before rolling and that helped a lot.  Because of the extra sugar it did crack a little once I rolled it out, but it tasted great and kept the cake extremely moist.  The next time I use this recipe I know not to add as much sugar! ;)

Fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly as written and then as suggested, added a little extra sugar at the end for texture.  It came out beautifully.  I made a test batch and it takes Wilton gel color well and it even tastes great!  I might try almond extract as well.  I did not have clear vanilla, but it came out white enough, besides, I'm coloring it anyway.  Thanks for the recipe, Kelley!  It's a keeper.

I didn't like this recipe at all. I make cakes all the time and people love them. When I put this fondant on it nobody would eat it. They ate the cake and left the fondant on their plates. I thought it was just too greasy.

Like others this was the first time I have made fondant. I had always heard that regular fondant had a bad taste. The only fondant I had ever had was made with marshmallow and it was NOT good. This was easy to make (actually fun too!) and SO delicious !! You got it perfect. I'm so glad I found this recipe and I have told all my friends about it too. Thank you !

I tried this recipe for a lark fully expecting that it would turn out into a mushy ball, or too dry to work with.(As it is usually my results)  I was surprised and amazed how well it turned out. I added colouring to part of it and just folded it into the fondant. It was beautiful and so easy to work with. I will never loose this recipe

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! I have tried other fondant and figured I wouldnt be using it on my cakes but with this recipe it is a great experience. I use my kitchen aid which helps alot with the mixing. I have used this recipe twice in the last 10 days and will use it again and again

This was the first time I ever tried making a fondant cake, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not sure whether 10X or 4X confectioner's sugar works best...  Had no real problems with this icing - it tastes a LOT better than other fondant I've had. I got lots of compliments on it, despite the fact that my cake was a little droopy after being transported across three states.  I found it was necessary to refrigerate the dough after working in the dye because all the activity made it a little sticky.   Refrigeration makes it easier to cut out shapes, roll, etc. (but I didn't refrigerate the cake after decorating it).   If you just want one color, I suggest adding dye before adding the sugar - it blends a lot easier.

This was really good. It was my second attemp at making fondant. The first time didn't work. THis was easy and a great consistency. However I still cant figure out how to get the fondant from the surface onto the cake.

This is a great recipe! Only a couple things I added 1/2 tsp butter flavor & 1/2 tsp of almond flavor. I've also found the best shortening for icings is the cheap walmart brand shortening (not the vegetable) it doesn't leave a greasy after taste.

NOT a good recipe if you are trying to cover a cake entirely. I could barely get off working surface without it falling apart. There is no strength or elasticity to this "fondant". No matter how long you let rest, place in fridge or adding extra sugar- it does not help. Stick to small cut shapes and decorations with this recipe. Dies taste better than traditional fondant.

This is exactly what I've been looking for!! For years, I've made the Allrecipes Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe in combination with a basic buttercream (butter + shortening + vanilla + confectioner's sugar + a splash of milk). While the flavor was always fantastic, it has always bugged me that I could never get a smooth and neat looking cookie like with fondant. Plus, the buttercream never sets, so the cookies weren't stackable.

Enter this new Buttercream Fondant recipe. This has the flavor of buttercream and the moldability of fondant! I found that I was able to roll the fondant pretty thin, and use my cookie cutters to get the exact shape of the cookies, and then just place them on top of the cookie with a thin layer of traditional buttercream underneath to help it stick. I took the advice of several reviewers and used half butter and half shortening for better flavor, and added food coloring while combining the corn syrup/butter/shortening. 

A few times, I had trouble lifting the fondant onto the cookie without it being a little flimsy and tearing. I found that it helped to work on a sheet of parchment paper on a cutting board, so I could stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few minutes first, making it firmer and much easier to pick up and move onto the cookies. I only found it to get greasy after handling it a lot.

My taste testers seemed pretty impressed by my new fancy stackable cookies! I'll be making this again!

This recipe just did not turn out. The first time I tried it, it was very greasy, despite chilling it before use, and when I tried to pick it up after rolling it, it completely fell apart. The second time, it was more pliable and not as greasy, but the same thing happened. I'm not sure if it's something I did or it's hust this recipe or what.

Fondant should be "gummy" and you should be able to stretch it. I achieved this in the past with marshmallow fondant that I've made.

This fondant is not "gummy" or stretchy. It was difficult to work with and very greasy. I use the Cricut Cake machine for my decorations. There is no way this fondant would have worked in that machine. It cracked easily and was not at all the texture of the marshmallow fondant I've made in the past.  The only positive thing is, the kneading time was 1/10th what it is to make the marshmallow fondant. So, if you want a fondant that's easy to make, but hard to decorate with, this is a great recipe for that!

This is hands down, the best tasting fondant I've ever had. You know how most fondants have a almost rubbery flavor and texture? Not this one. This one tastes like frosting, but firmer. I really don't have experience MAKING other fondants, so I don't know what to compare that part to. All I can say is it worked fine and covered well. The ONLY draw back I can think of is it had to stay refrigerated until I could get it on the cake. Otherwise it was too soft to work with. I will definitely be using this recipe again. No need to look elsewhere! BTW, I also used regular vanilla. If you want it super white, then you need to use clear vanilla and maybe go to a craft or cake store to get frosting whitener.

Pretty decent fondant recipe for just covering cakes. I made it exactly to the original recipe specs, and it turned out really soft, and a little "shiny." So I'm refrigerating it to see if it helps, but I still don't think it's going to be as stiff or rubbery as I'd like.  I could probably add some gum paste to stiffen it up, or even more powdered sugar, but I'd hate to add too much and get cracks. :)  It does taste very good, and I wanted to try this over others due to the dairy-free factor. I'll update if anything changes tomorrow.

I tried this recipe for a change rather than a regular fondant recipe, as I did not have any unflavored gelatin on hand. I'm not sure what all the reviewers who loved this recipe did, but I followed it exactly and it turned out terrible.  Super greasy and difficult to work with!  Perhaps if I'd decreased the amount of shortening it would have turned out better.  I tried adding more confectioner's sugar, but it still was too greasy, and when I rolled it out and covered the cake it was too heavy and broke all along the top edges of the cake. I would never recommend this; save yourself a headache and try a regular or marshmallow fondant instead.

I like this recipe easy enough. I've made it 5 times within the past 2 months. I added some flavor's into it to change it up a bit( vanilla,lemon, chocolate powder. I have a hard time rolling it out without cracking alos. The wax paper does help out quite a bit, I just put some water on the cracks and smooth it over with my fingers. I do not recommend this for big cakes(as a whole piece) but it is wonderful for shapes, and lines and flowers, things of that sort. That's why I give it four stars it is a winner for the details on a cake.

The only suggestion I have is remember to roll in between wax paper. It really does help get it on the cake without cracking.

Super easy, and tastes good as far as fondant is concerned ....but not worth a recomending.  the icing is too greasy and is difficult to roll thin and work with....

VERY tasty, but incredibly hard to work with. I can never seem to get enough powdered sugar added. Mine always ends up kind of gummy. I don't recommend covering a whole cake with it, but it's great for details (I used it on my Yo Gabba Gabba cake for letters, Tutti land, and the blue parts of the logo)

This is such a wonderful recipe! I had never used or made fondant before and this was incredibly easy. Thank you so much for posting this!!
A helpful tip: If you want to add color to your fondant, add it when you are kneading the fondant. I made a batch, split it into two balls, put one in the fridge, while I worked on the other one. You simply add as much food coloring as you want, and knead the dough until it is all smoothly blended in. It came out perfect!!!
I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks again!

This is a little harder to work with than marshmallow fondant but it is worth it. I refuse to use mmf because what is the point of making a cake if you are going to cover it with a bad tasting fondant.  This fondant is really good and with some patience and a little work you can have a great looking and great tasting cake!!  Thanks! This is a keeper!

It is very easy to make and it also tastes great. Its easy to cut out shapes but its hard to cover a cake with it. It rips easy and its a bit greasy.

I used this recipe making a cake with my friend. It tasted fine, but the ratio of shortening to sugar must be off, because it was very greasy, and not firm enough to hold its shape once we cut the pieces.

The first time I used this recipe was for my daughter's annual Halloween Party. I used mini loaf pans and cut the corners to create a coffin shape. I then frosted them with butter cream frosting and used the fondant to cover the top and for a hot pink skull detail. I used a little extra powdered sugar but just a sprinkle here and there during kneading. The second time I used a lemon flavoring and it was wonderful! So don't be afraid to experiment a little with the extract.

I have made a lot of fondant and thought I'd try this one....It wasn't at all sticky, which was nice...but only because it was so greasy I couldn't do anything with it!  Couldn't make flowers with it because they looked like half melted wax.  It's not worth the shortcuts to use a less than edible fondant!  Sorry, not trying to upset anyone but this is not a good recipe. :(

WOW! SO easy to work with!  My first time decorating a cake this way.  I did a very simple square with another smaller square on top. Iced first with choc buttercream. Then I put dark pink fondant over it, then I added brown polka dots, a fondant ribbon with a flower in the center of the ribbon. Just a simple starter for me, but boy did I turn some heads with it!  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!

I tried this recipe as my very first attempt with working with fondant and it was a very fun, pleasant experience! I'd heard horror stories of hard, chewy, unable to eat fondant - this tastes just like a good butter cream frosting! Easy to work with; I did add 1 t clear butter flavoring but that's the only thing I changed - love it! Will use this for all cakes requiring fondant!

This was my first time working with fondant and it was great! if it ever got to stiff from the powdered sugar that I was dusting it with I just added a drop or two of cornsyrup and kneaded it in.

Really Great Recipe for fondant. It is more greasy than normal fondant, but it is really easy to use, especially for beginners like me.  I would recommend making a half recipe at a time, because there is quite a bit to work with and it will mix better in smaller portions.

Good taste, beautiful for decorating. I found this recipe to be super greasy. A solution to the problem is to dust the decorated cake with powdered sugar and it will absorb the shine and leave a nice matte finish.

The first time I used this recipe was to make a bow for a German Chocolate Cake.  I didin't have enough powdered sugar on hand,so I used cocoa for the remainder (I needed a brown bow, anyway so it worked!)

The bow ended up tasting like fudge!  It was delicious- everybody loved it!  Thank You!

I haven't yet tried it to wrap around an entire cake- I did however, make it again to use for some dinosaur cut-outs and was still pleased- it works like regular fondant but tastes much better. :)

Love, love, love!  I've always wanted to make fondant but was nervous.  My cakes turned out GREAT after using this recipe for the first time ever and I was sorta crammed for time (have 3 small kids.)  Husband liked the look and tastes good too. I did use 3/4 cup shortening because of other comments AND I live in a humid city. Love, love, love....Thank you Kelly.

This gets no stars from me! It stayed greasy and no matter what I added it would not allow me to pick it up and put it on the cake! it breaks apart and is not easy to roll out at all. I would never suggest this recipe to anyone.

This was bad.  It tasted good but I was thrown by all of the shortening and it didn't do anything for the stucture of the fondant.  It was greasy no matter how much powdered sugar I added and it ripped every time I tried to use it.  Not a good fondant recipe.

Lots of fun to work with, can be time consuming and cakes covered with fondant do not refrigerate well. Leaving the fondant white, is also hard because you tens to be able to see the cake through the fondant.

Although I tasted it before serving, and it tasted decent, my family wouldn't eat it; it was so greasy that it glistened. My family peeled it off and ate the cake bare.

The flavor was good. It wasnt as easy to work with as the pre-made wilton kind you can buy in the store, but it did taste better. It fell apart fairly easily but I did manage to get it on the cake. The texture wasnt very smooth but I was pleased with the end result. Its not something I would use on a wedding cake. It was easy to make and the ingredients are things that are easy to find and keep on hand so overall I have to give this 4 stars.

I am so happy with this recipe! I have been scared to make fondant for a while, but this one looked easy to do. It was really easy and tasted great! I also rolled it out between sheets of wax paper. It worked well for transferring but makes the fondant a little greasy. My only disappointment is that it does not work well for bows or things that need shaping. It is too soft to hold the shape.

This was better than I had hoped for!  It was my first time using fondant (I've never been to a cake class so I did this purely on my own,) and it turned out great!  The taste is so much better than regular fondant, which tastes a bit like creamed candy hearts.  

I made this a week before I used it; my husband's surprise party got bumped up a week AFTER I had already made it.  I was worried that it wouldn't keep, but it did!  And the leftovers kept for two weeks in the refrigerater!  As someone who has never used fondant before now, I highly recommend this!

I am SO very glad that I used this recipe on my "practice" cake for my son's first birthday.  I read the poor reviews and thought that if I were really careful and followed the advice of the people writing good reviews that I could make it work.  WRONG!! All of the things that other people are saying are 100% true - too greasy, impossible to get onto the cake and non-recoverable with more sugar.

No matter how many times I kneaded the dough, it still broke apart once I rolled it out and tried to lay it on the cake. I think it asked for way too much shortening.

Very easy to make and work with. It turned out a little oily and soft which made it hard to roll out and shape, but for what I did that was fine.

The first time I made this I used my standing mixer and it came out very greasy and hard to work with. I second time I made it I mixed it 90 % by hand before using the standing mixer and the texture was much better.  I also reduced the corn syrup by about two tablespoons, and it worked about great!

I've used this recipe a few times now and it's sooo good!  I always end up having to use more confectioners sugar than it says and I wouldn't want to make it without a stand mixer but well worth it.

I did not care for this recipe. Very upset. I ended up patching the fondant onto the cake. Thinking about starting over with a marshmallow recipe. I had read alot of good reviews on this and was very disappointed.

This is an exceptional recipe without unusual ingredients such as gum paste or marshmallows. By far the easiest and cleanest fondant to make! Great taste and tints perfectly to food coloring!

Aside form the marshmello fondant, this is the best tasting recipe I have come across for fondant. It was very easy to put together, measurements were right on target - which is so nice!  It rolls out lovely, and everyone loves the way it looks.  I have used it several times, and if I have any left, I freeze it until the next cake comes along.  Then the night before I am going to use it, transfer it to the fridge.

Great recipe. This was my first time ever making fondant and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I can suggest is have patience with the fondant. Trying to rush and move quickly can lead to cracks and tears.  Be patient and creative and you'll come out with something beautiful.

I have never made fondant before, but I followed the recipe exactly. The fondant came out greasy and soft. It tasted great, but it tore very easily, and I couldn't get it to hold its shape. I wonder it you can't make fondant that tastes great and works well at the same times. :(

Super easy to make and tastes great but very difficult to work with.  I had to roll it between two sheets of wax paper and use the wax paper to transfer it to the cake.  I won't be using this recipe again.  I'll have to try marshmallow fondant next time.

Very easy to make, but not worth the 20 minutes it took to knead (by hand), roll and drape over the cake.  I've never made fondant before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I do watch a lot of cake tv -- you know what I'm talking about :) -- and, at the very least, I know that fondant should not be super shiny.  For how super shiny and greasy this stuff is, it's surprising that it so easily cracks.  Never mind that it tastes bland and greasy, it just doesn't even look good enough (or handle well enough) to bother putting on a cake that you'd want to serve in public.  I guess I'll be looking for another recipe for my daughter's 1st birthday … I need a fondant recipe that will hold up well at an outdoor birthday party in July and this one would just blind everyone with its shininess.  The only good thing about that is that they wouldn't be able to find the cake, eat it and then be mad at me for making a gross cake.  :O

I used this recipe to make my daughters 8th birthday cake!  This fondant was easy to make & really did taste like buttercream frosting.  I made it a day before I needed it & left it in the refridgerator over night.  I did only use 1/2 cup shortening like other reveiws suggested! It is alot easier if you roll it out between wax paper & use corn starch while rolling it out.  I made 6 batches of this fondant in 7 different colors. I used 2 batches to cover my cake (which was two 13" x 9" cakes together) and was able to get it on with no problems!  I did have problems with cracking but it was easily fixed which I loved!  My cake looked amazing & all my guests loved the taste of it.  This was my first time ever making/usinf fondant & I must say it was alot easier than I thought.  I will be using this receipe for all of my cakes that need fondant!

I was pretty leery about this recipe after The Great Marshmallow Fondant Failure (lol) and reading the negative reviews on this one.  I was FLOORED at how well and easy this turned out to be!!!  Tastes exactly like buttercream flavor, and by cutting the Crisco in half like some of the other posters did, I got that nice matte finish.  I made a very small test batch because I was NOT going to waste all those ingredients again after the colossal failure of the marshmallow fondant!  I am not ready to put it on a cake yet (was waiting until I found a recipe that worked!!) but I did a "test run" on the bottom of a round bowl and on a square butter dish, and had ONE area that had very faint cracks that could easily be fixed.   And I didnt even need to use cornstarch like some others did.  And this is my FIRST time making fondant!  Totally deserves all five of its stars! :):):)

Gave four stars only because it's a little to sweet for me.  But, that said my eleven year old made it with very little help from me except transfering the rolled fondant to the cake.  Neither one of us had made fondant before.

Definatly very easy to make and colour with food coloring. Mine cracked a lot and I was told next time use cornstarch for rolling as it won't dry out as fast and use shortening to smooth cracks. Great overall recipe!

I used this recipe for the first time yesterday, it was very easy! I made a four layer yellow cake and I only needed half of the fondant to cover the cake and make the Christmas decorations. I am pleased with the results and I will use this recipe in the future.

I found a few faults with this recipe... for starters I had to use about 3 lbs of powdered sugar for it not to be sticky. Second of all I couldn't seem to get it where it wouldn't fall apart when I tried to cover the cake with it. I ended up only doing designs with it. Maybe I'm just too new to it as it was my first time. I also had quite a lot left over. Otherwise I liked the recipe... a tip for coloring it unsweetened cocoa powder worked really well to get different shades of brown. Also making black was easier to do in a separate dish first.

I've made this 2x. 1st time used 1 cup shortinening and that was too much. As suggested by others the 2nd time I used 1/2 cup shortening and that's better. I lightly floured the rolling pin and board with all purpose flour and that helped alot and didn't affect the flavor of fondant.

This was my first attempt at making and using fondant.  I followed all the advice I gleaned from looking at various recipes, and it was easy enough to make, but it didn't make it onto the cake in one piece!  Maybe the cake was too big, almost 9x13.  If you are an inexperienced cake decorator like me, only attempt this if you are planning to cover something small.

Fondant has never been this easy! I've tried the marshmallow one a while back and it wasn't nearly as simple. This tastes great-- I actually added some marshmallow flavored oil extract in addition to the vanilla for a flavor enhancement. Not only is it easy and tasty, but also very pliable and easy to use.

I liked the taste but it was so greasy. It was also extremely heavy. When I put it on the cake the entire thing collapsed and just turned into a big blob. I guess I did something wrong but Ive used the store bought stuff and it didn't do that. It just tasted awful. I don't know what I did wrong

Easy to make, tasted great, easy to work with, BUT melted way too easily and way too fast. I had to keep the cake in the fridge for the whole party until it was ready to be eaten in order to keep it from melting.

Tastes really good, is definitely more greasy than regular fondant so I let it sit out and dab with paper towels, when working it I rolled it between wax paper and found it easy to work with.

Very easy recipe, but I found that it ripped easily and was very soft.  My cake was a flop as a result (tasted good though).  I was disappointed, but am willing to add more sugar next time to see if that gives the dough more body.

Having never made or worked with fondant before, I admit I was apprehensive at best.  This recipe was simple to follow and delicious to boot!  I did have to use a bit more than 2 lbs. of powdered sugar but it was worth it all the same.  Will definitely use this again!

this was good but the only thing that i didnt like was that it was greasy just like the other people suggested. i ended up just making the cake polka dotted instead of trying to cover it and it was like that!! THANKS A LOT!!

Recipe is simple to make but, if you are used to using store-bought fondant, this makes a soft very pliable fondant. It is easier to knead than store-bought. I love the simplicity for this recipe but do not prefer it. Regular fondant has more elasticity and not so much give. This butter cream pulls apart very easily. I will use it for quick projects but will opt for the Marshmallow Fondant for the professional appearance.

The taste is pretty good, especially for fondant. Initially, mine didn't have a taste, then it tasted like actual buttercream icing. However, I could NOT get it to thicken, no matter how much confectioners sugar I added. It tore and stuck and was an overall pain. This is the second time I've made it, and both times it took FOREVER to even get it to a semi-solid. Not sure I'll waste my time again.

I have made this recipe several times and have not had the consistency turn out right even once. But, instead of throwing away a great tasting product and waste the money I put into it, I combined it with store bought fondant. I use a mixture of about 1/3 store bought and 2/3 rolled buttercream. The consistency comes out perfect and it still tastes GREAT!

Very good recipe!!  Thanks so much!  I am very weary about using fondant due to the taste but this recipe solved that for me!  I had to use a little extra corn syrup when I added the food coloring in and then more sugar but all in all it worked great!  I would just add the food coloring next time in first with the liquid and also warming the shortening helped too!

I wasn't very happy about this fondant.  It didn't work well. As others have said, it comes out greasy and rips SOOOOOOOO easily.  I did everything the recipe said.  I will keep this recipe and try to tweak it because I love the taste.  Will keep y'all updated!

I made this for a cake class and it turned out alright.  I was really proud of myself for making a fondant that actually tasted good.  Upon taking it to class, it kept breaking and tearing, as my instructor said rolled buttercream was prone.  She said to put it into the fridge for an hour and it should clear that up, but not to leave it in lonoger than that because it would get too hard and begin to dry out.  I subbed butter for shortening, and that may have something to do with it, but I seriously doubt it.  Overall a good recipe and very easy to make.

Tasted great and easy to make/use. It was my first time using fondant and had no problems. It did get a little greasy if left out in room temp. for too long. But it was a great recipe and I will use again.

I think this is a great recipie and it tastes just like buttercream! I used it for my first time yesterday in making an Elvis cake for my father for his birthday. One thing I'd like to point out though is 2lbs of confectioners' sugar is WAY to much, it makes the fondant too heavy. I used all but like 1/4 to half of the 2 lbs bag left. When the fondant stops sticking to your hand you know its ready!

Had a great taste but I had a really hard time getting getting it onto the cake - I had to keep it pretty thick to keep it from tearing and that made the cake much too sweet.

This was an AWESOME recipe!  It is sooo much more tasty than store bought fondant.  I usually don't work with much, but coloring it and rolling was a breeze.  I highly recommend it!

This was much easier than the fondant I tried to make previously.  It was greasy and didn't handle very well until I added extra powdered sugar, but my cake came out pretty good according to the people who ate it.  I also added butter flavor and almond flavor instead of vanilla.  I will use it again for sure, and it's good to know that adding more sugar can straighten it out if you are having issues!

This recipe works best with 8 cups of sifted powdered sugar and adding a 1/2 teaspoon butter flavor (clear).  I work a bit more sugar into it, like about 1/8 cup as I knead it, but the results are no cracking.  Kinda acts like Fondarific for me without the heavy price or shipping charges. Of course, I still use my Fondarific. I just love the stuff, but this is a nice alternative for those who want the old style buttercream flavor and the shiny finish was very handy when decorating my XBox360 cake, and it pliability makes it very easy to roll. Wouldn't add real butter though, makes for a mushy final product.

I have used store bought fondant in the past and have never enjoyed the taste. I tried this recipe and was very disappointed in the outcome. Though it tasted great, it wouldn't stop cracking. Given the time I invested making it, it was even more disappointing when I couldn't manipulate it like store bought fondant. I will try the marshmallow recipe next or just buy a ton of expensive store fondant.

The taste was great, I did use butter as noted by another user.  It was pretty heavy from using the butter, i think, so it was a little harder to work with than regular fondant, but when rolled onto wax paper and draped over the cake it worked out fine.

i think this fondant is really good. it needs a lot more sugar though, because if you dont it is soggy. other than that it turns out very well and it is easy to work with. your guests will be amazed and it is very stunning fondant :)

As other reviews have said, this was pretty greasy. I didn't mind that too much though - it still looked nice and wasn't too horrible to work with. My biggest issue was that it came out kind of splotchy from the powdered sugar I used when rolling it out. I may use this again, though. I thought it tasted good (quite sweet, though) and my boyfriend, for whom I made the cake, loved it.

I tried this recipe and found that the more you knead the fondant, the better it comes out. I also found that it was too greasy. The end result was that it tasted good, and looked good. (FYI- if you do not need the fondant enough, it will come out grainy. Will use recipe again-- but will be on the lookout for others.

Don't use this recipe if you are planning to sculpt anything with it.  This is extremely greasy.  It all worked fine, my cake looks fine, but it didn't go as planned.  I made a "party hat" for my turtle cake 2 days before I made the turtle and the hat never dried properly.  I was even able to crush it and resculpt it.  It was a little crusty, but you can't tell in the finished product.  If you are just going to put it over a cake and add a few "decals" like the recipe photo, then this is fine, but it really wasn't what I expected.  You are supposed to be able to make something like a ribbon out of it and let it dry and it should be hard after a day or 2, not this recipe.  Just be warned.

I've used this recipe to make fondant in the past. It works well and is a lifesaver in a pinch. I will add however that this fondant leaves a greasy shine on the finished cake. If you add more powdered sugar to the recipe it totally throws off the proportions and has difficulty keeping that elasticity. I use this recipe when I don't have gelatin needed to make the other fondant recipe on her. If you need a quick fondant and don't want to purchase geletin then this will work. Just remember it will leave a greasy shine on your finished cake.

This was the very first time I tried to make fondant. I followed the receip except I used half butter and half shortening.  It was so good.  The only problem I had was covering my cake with it, that probably came from a lack of experience, this was my first time covering a cake with fondant. But I did a pretty good job anyway.  Everyone loved the cake. The taste was wonderful.I will definately use this recipe again.

I did use butter instead of shortening (like some others did with great results), but this was a disaster for me!  It came together nicely, and was smooth, but fell completely apart when I tried to roll it. I added more powdered sugar 2X thinking it would help.  It would have worked only for something small like cupcakes.  If I try it again I will try to refridgerate before rolling.

This was the first time making fondant and it worked amazing. I made a butterfly cake for my daughter's first birthday and was amazed at how well the fondant fit around the shape of the cake. I didn't have shortening, but used marg instead and it still turned out well. I also used my bread maching on the dough setting to do all the mixing and kneading.

This was the first time that I have used fondant, and I found this recipe to be very easy and good to work with.  I have used it twice now, and the first time I didn't have enough powdered sugar, and it made the fondant look greasy.  The second time I added more powdered sugar and it turned out fine.  Great taste, also!

I just made this a few days ago to cover my birthday cake. It was delicious and looked great. Make sure you chill it for quite a while so it hardens up, it is very soft to begin with.

It tasted good but it was kind of sticky so it made it hard to work with, but if you put it in the fridge over night it is a lot easier to work with.

I really enjoyed making this fondant.  Being as it was my first time ever using/making fondant I think I did a pretty good job :) It tastes amazing, and looks great (if you do it right...which I didn't) I used light corn syrup that had vanilla flavoring and used butter flavored Crisco.  The butter flavored Crisco is a yellow color but I wasn't going to make it white anyways. I am submitting a picture but keep in mind that I did not take my time and wasnt trying to make a "perfect cake".  I was getting the general idea of how to make the fondant and what steps I could take to make it better next time. I used the full recipe and made 1 cake out of 2 9in round pans.  I put a little bit of icing in between and on the outside to hold the fondant. After covering the cake I had alot left over which i just tossed. This fondant tastes just like icing and doesnt get hard if you cover it! I am very pleased and impressed with this recipe! Thanks Alot!

This is a great alternative for fondant (I don't like the taste of fondant, but this just tastes like buttercream).  If you wish to get rid of the "greasy" shine, dust you final product with icing sugar.

this was my first attempt at fondant, and i was very disapointed at how it turned out. it was WAY too oily. the only thing that i changed in the recipe was halving the ingredients because i was making a small 9in. cake. I managed to cover the cake and decorate it, but it was too greasy to serve for my friends birthday party.
I will probably try a different recipe next time.

This is a great recipe! It is a little oily but still great. It tastes wonderful and is colored easily. Just be sure not to put to much powdered sugar in if it turns out oily for you.

I followed the directions PERFECTLY (this was my first time making fondant and I did not want to make a mess of it), yet somehow it ended up greasy. I added more confectioner's sugar, but couldn't get that matte finish. Nothing worked :( I'm not sure how I could improve upon this recipe, so next time I'll be trying a different one.

the first time i made it i did add about a tablespoon of butter to it.., gave it more of a buttercream flavor.

the recipe i have calls for 1/4 tsp lemon oil and 1/4 tsp orange oil instead of the butter and vanilla extracts, but you can use any flavoring

the trick is rolling it out between vinyl sheets like the kind you get at a fabric store  steve stellingwerf demoed this and he said it does break apart if rolled to thin..hope this helps

This didnt work for me at all.  It was nothing like regular rolled fondant.  I tried to use it for a small 3 tiered cake, and it was terrible.  I was pressed for time and ended up running to the grocery store and paying $20 for a box of regular fondant.  It falls apart very easily as it contains no bonding agent.

My first experience with fondant. It tastes better than I've ever had fondant taste, but there was still a little to be desired. I think I'll stick with frostings.

Taste is pretty good, but I agree with others - texture was pretty greasy and tore much easier than standard fondant.  I rubbed some powdered sugar over the top of the cake to lessen the greasy look, but still not great.  Might be good for something smaller than a full cake (cupcakes or cookies)

First time making fondant. It definitely takes practice figuring out the right consistency, but it's not hard. It was time consuming but fun, and this fondant has great flavor/texture. The hardest part was rolling it out and transferring it to the cake without it tearing. I taped wax paper to the countertop and dusted the paper and pin generously with cornstarch, which blends in easily to the fondant. Everyone loved the cake and thought it looked really groovy.

This was muy first time making Fondant, and I'm not sure if it was me, or what, but this didn't turn out very well.  It was an absolute mess.  No matter what I did (refrigerated it, added more powdered sugar, etc.), the fondant still fell part every time I layed it on the cake.  I too found that it was very greasy looking...and when I served it for the party, my family was joking around that it reminded them of tile grout or tar or something!  LOL  I will probably not make it again, since no one ate it.

Used this on a plain iced storebought cake.  Was beautiful, taste was definately better than regular fondant.  Mine seemed to appears shiny, like a greasy look almost.  Maybe I should have added more powdered sugar??  Still great though and would use again.

I made this recipe to cover my christmas cookies with.  It was very easy to use and I loved the look.  However, the taste is not very good.  I really didn't enjoy the taste and it really didn't add anything to the cookie.

This was my first time making fondant and it was a success.  It had it's ups and downs but all in all a pretty cake.  I do have one tip for getting the fondant onto the cake (after several trial and error), flower your rolling pin well, and roll the fondant from the surface onto the pin and dusting with each rotation.  Then you can life that fondant and un roll on the top of the cake!  Thanks for the recipe you have opened many doors.

Absolutely tasty and rolls just like the store-bought fondant!  I needed pure white fondant for my daughters hello kitty cake and this held together beautifully!  Will definitly be using this on a regular basis!  The more you add powdered sugar as you knead it, the less sticky it gets.  I added food color gel and "kneaded" more powdered sugar in to make it the perfect consistancy!  Love it!

Definitely delicious! I reached the "silky play dough" stage around 1.5lb sugar, and should have stopped there. I stayed true to the recipe and used the full 2lb. Probably why I had so much cracking :( I'll make this again! Check out youtube vids on fondant marbling.

I can see this going well on a cake, it was a perfect consistency even when rolled thin. I followed this recipe exactly with no problems.  I've seen this type of coating before and wondered what it was.  But now I would have no trouble making it again as well as coloring it.   VERY Satisfied.

This fondant does not handle very well. And yes! It's very greasy. It does not have the pliability to handle covering a cake well.  It does not allow you to roll it out very thinly, but its good for making on cake applicaes. And it does taste much better.

It gets a tad crumbly as you add more powdered sugar to put it on a cake. Since you put a buttercream crumb coat on anyway, fold in about 2 tablespoons of that buttercream and you have a more elastic, easier to manage fondant!!

This is REALLY easy to make, and it's fairly easy to work with.  I couldn't get it to roll out right on its own so I rolled it between two sheets of wax paper.  My kitchen is kind of hot so before I put the fondant on, I popped it in the freezer till it was more firm.  As far as the flavor, I liked that it took salt since that gave it a little more taste than pure sugar.

I did not care for this recipe. It kept cracking, and was to oily. I could not even get it off my work space with out it ripping, no matter how much sugar I put under it. I eventually got it on the cake but, it was cracking and lumpy.

I loved this recipe!  It was really fast and super easy!  I did not have any clear vanilla so I just used regular vanilla.  That worked too.  I used the fondant to create little leaves and stems for my apple cake pops.  I made the leaves and stems and then refrigerated them for about 5 minutes.  Then, I put them on the cake pops.  The whole process took me less than 20 minutes start to finish!

Very disappointing.  Even after coloring it dark green it had a white film on it.  I added a TON of sugar (another half almost!) and then it was crackly.  Not pretty, and not tasty.  My son gave me a pitty "it's good." but I could tell he just didn't want to hurt my feelings.  I couldn't roll it this enough because it was flaking apart.

I have previously used marshmallow fondant with great success. My daughter is not a fan of the taste of that though so I used this recipe.BIG mistake.  It is greasy and fall apart to easily. There was no way to decorate a four layer cake with it.  It is like play-dough.

I tried this recipe and it did not come out correct at all!  It was way too greasy and it just fell apart when I tried to move it to the cake.  One second I would be rolling it out and adding a little powdered sugar at a time to try to get it to stop being sticky and greasy but it seemed like what ever I did nothing would help.  I am not super experienced in fondant but this was really bad.  On the brighter side it did taste very similar to buttercream frosting, so if you can get it to work for you then more power to you and a good tasting fondant!

I used this recipe to make fondant for the first time ever, I got great comments on the taste, everyone ate all the fondant on their slice (which is great because fondant usually has a weird after taste) that's not the case with this recipe. The only problem is that I found it very hard to handle, it kept tearing apart and it was too greasy, next time I'll use less shortening for sure, hopefully that will make it easier to handle too.

I love this recipe.  It is super easy!!  I had never used fondant and made an awesome cake the first try with this recipe.  I did use half the amt of crisco (like other reviews suggested)  I also use the hook of the stand mixer which I am sure makes it much easier to make.  My kids love the taste.  I had no promblems with this recipe.

This recipe was a life saver! Normally i buy the shop fondant to roll but the shelves were empty! I had to use Golden Syrup as an alternative to corn syrup as I live in Malta and couldn't find that either - but all worked out in the end and I am very grateful :o)

I used this for a birthday cake, it turned out really good for my first time. It rolled out pretty good and I was able to make some really pretty flat style flowers. When it came to vines it was hard to get them as thin as I wanted with out having them brake all the time. (I was wrapping them around the side so couldn't let them try or they would crack when I put them on.) I recommend 48 hours of drying for any more delicate work if it it going to be used on top of the cake. And this will not work for dynamic pop out flowers.
Remember that is this butter cream and is a bit harder to work with then marshmallow because it is greaser and wetter. BUT, It taste allot better then traditional Fondant in my opinion! I will most definitely be using this again. Thought probably more as just the base, and then using Marshmallow for the more delicate stuff. (great for simple cut out shapes though.)

I didn't have much luck with the fondant. It started cracking before I got a chance to add all the icing. I rolled the fondant between two sheets of plastic wrap and it worked well and rolled it on my rolling pin to transfer to cake, however, it cracked before I could finish covering the cake. I tried smoothing out the fondant to hide the cracks, but it didn't look perfect. The fondant had a marzipan color, not white as I expected it to be. Rubbing the fondant too much after covering the cake makes the fondant shiny, so don´t touch it unnecessarily. I was so unhappy with the fondant that I decided to take it off the cake. I won´t be using this recipe again, but I´m glad it works for others. Btw, the taste is ok, nothing special.

This was my 2nd time making fondant, I first tried another recipe I found on AR... unfortunately, I had just as bad of luck with this recipe. I followed this recipe exactly, and while it seemed to be okay at first, when I took it out later that evening to start decorating, it was extremely greasy and kept tearing. There was no "gumption" to it at all. It seems everyone else has had good luck, so it was probably beginners bad luck - but I have no idea what I did wrong. Better luck next time I hope!

This recipe was great and easy to make. The flavor isn't bad like with some other fondants. The texture was a little greasy for me, but that cleared up while kneading in extra powdered sugar when I incorporated the food coloring. I used gels for this and it worked great.

I spent half of my day trying to get this fondant recipe to work. It goes from being too soft/sticky and unstable to dry and cracking without any discernible moment between where the texture is usable. I've used other fondant recipes in the past without having this problem. After two attempts with much time spent trying to make this fondant work, I am finding myself wondering how so many reviewers found this recipe useful.

It's a decent recipe, tastes good. A bit hard to work with if it's your first time... I would add a bit more sugar to it, and use your hands to mix everything. It's a messier method, but worth it.

I gave this two stars because yes, it did make a fondant but after trying again and again, I cannot get this recipe to be anything other than greasy and it tears so easily that it's not worth the trouble to even make it.

Very easy, forgiving fondant recipe for this first-timer!  I will definitely make it again.  

I read the tips in these reviews and found them VERY helpful, especially the ones about spreading regular frosting on the cake first so the fondant sticks, and rolling between two sheets of wax paper.  Worked like a charm!  I also used half butter and half shortening and everyone at the party raved about how good the frosting tasted.  I didn't find the "greasy" texture to be a problem.  In fact, it allowed me to smooth the fondant with my fingers and repair little bubbles and cracks.

Addendum: Just taught my almost-8-year-old Cub Scout how to make this.  This time, we used all shortening and it tasted just as good.  He had fun and it turned out great!

For years I have watched "Cake Boss" and been jealous of the amazing cakes Buddy makes, using fondant. I have struggled to ice my cakes in buttercream icing and get the smooth look I want. Now with your recipe I can finally make cakes that look smooth and don't taste like plastic! Thank you so much!!!

I used this recipe, as the store bought fondant is hard as a rock and even harder to roll out. Although, this recipe has a good flavor I found it extremely greasy and tears easily when rolling it out, and isn't good for cutting designs out, in current form. I read other reviews and will adjust this recipe as others have for more success. I have two recipes mixed and in vacuum sealed bags, so I am going to try to add more sugar and hopefully get the consistency I need, otherwise I will have to toss it out. Read all reviews for tips before making this recipe as it is. Good Luck!

This recipe was not to my liking.  The fondant was very, very sticky even after adding more confectioners' sugar, and I also added some cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  The fondant never became firm and was a nightmare to work with.  It never smoothed out.  I would not recommend using this recipe.  Just buy some from the store instead of messing up your kitchen trying to make your own.  You'll just get a headache.

Had a problem with it melting on me. Used the whole 2 lbs. of sugar and it still was melting.  It happened to be really hot though. Should I have done this in air conditioning possibly or could it been something else wrong.

Great, easy recipe. It's too sweet and the fondant tends to be a bit flimsy. To overcome the sweetness, I only put 2/3 of the recommended sugar, and compensated with corn starch. That compromised the quality of the dough, but gave me excellent taste. I also reduced the sugar in the cake recipe itself. To overcome the flimsiness issue, I rolled the fondant on parchment paper coated with corn starch, then flipped it on to the cake, as recommended by one of the reviewers below. Worked like a charm!

I tried this fondant as a first timer and found it easy to use. I dyed a portion of the fondant and that worked out very well. It was a little greasy so I used quite a bit of extra confectioners sugar when rolling it out.

I followed the directions and changed nothing, I used regular vanilla extract only because my fondant will be colored. OMG it was so easy and actually tasted good. I am doing test baking before I make my sisters wedding cake so I am going to try this again only with Butter shortening, since pure white does not matter on my cake. I did use my stand mixer and it was a snap. Thanks a million!!!!!!!!

This is a wonderful tasting fondant. I have been using fondant for several years and always make my own. I like to try new recipes of fondant but I will not be using this one again. Sorry. This fondant is so greasy it is difficult to work with. Fondant is meant to be applied thinly. This fondant tears, cracks, won't come off the silpat, and the coverage is terrible. Like I said, wonderful flavor horrible fondant!

First time making fondant and it came out great. I used it to decorate cookies. While the texture is definitely different, it tastes just like buttercream frosting. No problems with greasiness by using 1/2 cup of shortening. No problem with cracking and was easy to make with the hook attachment of my stand mixer. I used gel food coloring and it worked out well. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe! This was my first time making fondant and it was so easy. This fondant is so easy to use and the flavor is good. I used a stand mixer with the hook attachment and when it was done I kneeded it by hand a few times before storing. Thanks so much!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  This was my first time making fondant.  This was super easy.  Not sure what the few complaints were about at all.  I did only use 1/2 of the shortening as suggested by a few.  It rolled out great and did not crack or fall apart.  I definately will use this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

May have been my error, as this was my first time making fondant, but this turned out way too greasy. I put in way more sugar than called for, but it still stayed greasy, and when i put on on petit fours it looked great at first but the next morning had sort of oozed down the sides. On the plus side, it tastes great!

This did not work!! : ( Too greasy, tearing just as I rolled it and kneaded it. It was more like a cookie dough than fondant... useless for cakes! Delicious but not useful! I wish I knew what I did wrong but for now I will stick with MMF. The kneading can be a pain with MMF but after this experience, I think it is well worth the trouble!

This was my first time making fondant, and I was really pleased with this recipe. It was very simple to make and to work with.  I used Butter Flavored Crisco instead of the original shortening, by mistake, but it worked out fine; just a slight difference in color).

This works great!  I used my kitchen aid mixer the  whole time.  Just let it do the job for you. It comes out nice & smooth. You can add color to it right in the machine also.  If you break it up into smaller balls you can decorate with it, like strips to make mummy cookies!  Just roll out small balls & roll out.  Cut into strips & place on top.

This is the second time I have tried this fondant.  Im not really sure what Im doing wrong.  I have learned a bit more about fondant then I had known the first time I attempted it and still I got a big ole flop!  The first time it was too greasy and literally slid off the cake and this time it was too heavy and cracked.  I ended up tossing it and making the marshmallow fondant I am used to.  I can't figure out what I am doing wrong.   Anyway, it seems to work great for some people so I still gave it a couple stars.  It tastes good as well.  Maybe I will try it again some day.

This recipe was extremely greasy. I kept adding powdered sugar and still had problems with the greasy look. It was difficult to work with and cracked easily.

I tried this recipe. Very greasy, does not roll out well, does not taste like buttercream icing, and does not have a good texture like fondant should have.

Love it! Used this for my daughters birthday party and it turned out great. I'd never attempted fondant before and couldn't have been happier with the results. I'm going to try it again for my best friends bridal shower cake! Can't wait to see the results!

I used this recipe for my very first (serious) cake decorating endeavor. I was so relieved and pleased! It turned out great!!! I followed the recipe except for one MINOR change-I used clear almond extract. It was delicious and had such a nice smell.

I tried this recipe this evening and it was fine until I tried to pick it up to put on the cake, I used every method I could think of and the fondant kept breaking.  I added more confectioners sugar but it didn't help.  In the end I didn't want to waste it so I made small cut outs to put on the cake and made icing instead.  Disappointed that the fondant didn't stick together.

This fondant was awful. It was so greasy and stuck to everything, it tore and ripped apart when I tried to lift it. I don't know why it says buttercream, it just tastes like sugar.

Loved the taste!  Problem:  greasy, no hold dough. good for decorations not great for covering the cake. My Fix:  I added cornstarch dusting it lil by lil, and kneaded into the dough, if u add too much it will crack, add enough so that when u roll it out its easy enough to transfer. Worked wonders. didnt need the wax paper. I hate the buttery buttercream taste, added a lil more vanilla essence than suggested, worked well. Will try other flavorings on the icing.   Tip: Gel icing does not further moisten the dough.

I have made this twice and I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong. Both times it has turned out greasy and hard to handle. It does taste good, but I don't even know what fondant is supposed to taste like.

Considering this was my first time using fondant, I found it quite mold-able and easy to work with. I did have a few issues with it though...it easily came off, like I can peel it right off the cake. Is fondant supposed to do that? I didn't like that part about it. Flavor wise, it's alright. It's edible. Next time I'll probably use almond extract or mint, something to give it an extract boost of flavor. It's great for beginners like myself.

This recipe did not work for me. It was very difficult to work with.  Greasy. Fell apart.  I added SO much extra confectioner's sugar b/c I'd think it was smooth and not sticky, then roll it... and it would stick to my sugared smooth surface... or to my sugared rolling pin...  and was just too greasy to work with. I wouldn't even use it for molding or cutting shapes.

I followed the recipe exactly, but after rolling it, the dough became soft, sticky and kept breaking.  It also became very greasy.  It doesn't taste like buttercream, just like a very sweet paste.  I'm sure kids wouldn't mind it, but I personally don't care for the taste. This is my first experience with fondant, and while I'm sure it tastes 100% better than a store bought fondant, it doesn't compete with a traditional frosting.  If I ever made it again, I would try reducing the amount of corn syrup and shortening by half.  It's probably a good base recipe for tweaking, but didn't work for me and the other lone reviewer who had a not so great experience.

This is an easy recipe and has a pretty good taste, but it is a little soft. It is good for putting on smaller cakes and shaping around curves.  I will use it again.

This recipe was relatively easy to make, although I found that I used much more icing sugar than in the recipe so have lots on hand!  It is sticky and tricky to work with but I prepared it on a piece of wax paper and then laid it on top of the cake.  I discovered that dyes make it very very sticky and hard to work with so you need to add icing sugar to it.  If it is refrigerated it is a bit easier to work with.  Also, as it sat out it got easier to work with so maybe it just needs to dry a bit.  Everyone said it looked awesome and, although sweet, tasted good too.

The kids liked this one a lot better then the others I have used, but cracks very easily . Next time I am going to add gelatin powder and see if that works. I do like it because in colorado everything drys so fast and this did not.

I stopped adding powdered sugar when it seemed the right consistancy but I should have added 1/2 - 1 cup more because after it rested for a day it got very greasy and tore easily.

This was my first attempt at fondant, and it came out beautifully! It was very inexpensive compared to the pre-made stuff and came together relatively quickly. I added food coloring to the mix before adding any of the powdered sugar and it came out great. Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!! :)

I was not that impressed with this recipe.  It tasted fine but was much more difficult to work with than other fondant I have used.  The recipe called for 2 pounds of powdered sugar, and I found it took nearly 4 pounds.  This recipe is like a sugar sponge, not easy-to-use fondant.  We had to lay it on REAL THICK to avoid cracks, etc.  I won't be making this one again.  Not impressed.

Just got done trying this recipe - fondant was basically falling apart...added a lot more powdered sugar as I was trying to roll it out because it was so sticky. Maybe cut the shortening in half?? I probably won't use this one again.

My first attemp at fondant. It was easy to do and work with however I had to ahve messed up somewhere on the recipe because it was greasy and seemed to melt? I added cherry candy flavoring and it made it taste like airhead candy. Kids loved the flavor!

I had a very difficult time working with this stuff because it was so greasy. I got it to the perfect texture, but then I tried rolling it out and it got greasy. . .so I tried to get rid of the greasiness by adding some more powdered sugar (mistake #1). I then attempted dying it a pretty shade of blue. . .the food coloring mixed perfectly into the fondant, but then it got even more greasy and it was impossible to roll out!  This was supposed to be icing for my mom's birthday cake, but so many other things besides the icing went wrong (including ants that came from nowhere and attacked the pretty blue blob of fondant on my counter while I was reading comments, hoping to find some helpful hint) that I'm going to name this adventure the "Murphy's Law Cake."  Despite all the trouble I had, the part that ants didn't attack was still pretty tasty! I'll give this one another go sometime soon.

Excellent Recipe..easy to work with - used it for Halloween Cupcakes.  Made orange to cover the cupcake and cut white ghosts with a gingerbread cookie cutter that I stretched the legs out to make it look like a ghost.

It was way shiny/greasy... and it cracked a lot.    It wasn't the smooth velvetty fondant I wanted.   But it did taste good!  I put peppermint extract in mine because I was making a chocolate peppermint cake.

My first fondant experience.  I did not fondant the whole cake (reduced to 12 svgs), just a monkey (used cocoa powder for the brown color) on it.  I used more sugar than called for- it was a little sticky and hard to handle.  It turned out really cute, but a lot of work!

Very easy, very tasty.  I used butter instead of shortening (who ever heard of buttercream without butter? :) ) and a little more sugar than was called for (about a cup).  If you use butter, you can leave out the salt.

I had quite the frustrating evening with this recipe.  It is partly my fault.  In reading the reviews I should have thought to grab more confectioners suger than the recipe called for.  It was VERY greasy and didn't taste very good at all.. but what really stunk was that I couldnt come close to getting it from the counter to the cake without it falling apart on me.  I ended up taking a cookie cutter to it and piling different colored shapes all over the cake to cover it.   It came out kind of neat looking but I wouldnt want anyone to try eating it since it doesn't taste good.. kind of like sweet playdough.  I'm thinking next time I'll use more vanilla, or maybe I will try some anise and/or almond extract.   Anywho...It's a good thing I did a practice run before the big 1st bday party.

I made this last night and sorry to say I was dissapointed.  This recipe is mega greasy.  Sure it's easy but if you want something light, easy to work worth and great tasting, I would suggest something else.  Like a marshmellow fondant.

I had the same issue as others with it being extremely greasy. I didn't have any clear vanilla extract, so I used 1/2 tsp of almond extract. It was a little sweeter than I would have liked, but it came out ok. I think im going to have to find another recipe though.

thick pastey and waaay to sweet. I'm a health nut (sometimes) and my husband is a junk food candy lover and even he peeled it off the cake. My 2 year old liked it, though. It was a tester cake for her bday cake (thank god I tested it!!!) So you can try it, but if its for something important, just give it a test run on a reg. boxed cake.

This is tough-it was my first crack at making fondant. The recipe was easy enough to follow. However, the final product was very greasy. I didnt like the final shiny look...it made me uneasy. The taste was ok but the final outcome was mediocre.It cracked alot when rolling. I'm glad a made a test cake first! I will most likey find a different fondant recipe for the final birthday cake. Maybe it just takes practice.

Although this fondant actually does taste great- like buttercream- the texture is bad. It is very greasy, even after adding extra powdered sugar in.  It also does not hold its shape.  I had plans of making curls and bows for my cake but I had to change my entire plan for decorating this cake because this fondant just collapses when you try to do anything with it.

I read several reveiws before trying this recipe and the fondant just didn't turn out. It cracked when you tried to roll it thin and was very greasy.  It also does not taste anything like buttercream frosting imo.  More like sweetened shortening.  Just really wasn't at all what I was expecting and it didn't work for us :(

Havin never eaten fondant it was hard for me to determine what kind of rating I should give this recipe. I rated it according to ease and instructions. I had no problem whatsoever making this. I have never made fondant before and wasn't sure I could pull it off! I did though, and tinted it using the wilton icing tints. It turned out great!! I can't wait for the cakes to cool so I can put the fondant on them!! Thanks for a great recipe I'm sure I will use quite often!! :)  Even if it did burn up my mixer.... :(

This is in response to another review.  To get the fondant to be a different color (ie. red, blue, green, purple, etc.) Wilton makes dyes for fondant that you can buy individually or in a pack of 12 or 8.  You use them by dipping a toothpick into them and wiping the toothpick onto your ball of fondant, then you knead the color in.  Their dyes are a little thicker than food coloring.  Haven't tried this recipe yet, but I am definitely taking the pointers and tips from the great reviews that others have left!

This is an excellent recipe. It was fun to work with, very easy to make and taste good (although I still peeled it off my cake - just not an icing person). If this did not work for you you did something wrong. Read the reviews and take their pointers. Use quality ingredients. I used 3/4 cup of corn syrup and butter with the 2lb sugar plus a bit extra.

This was my first experience with fondant. I had always heard fondant was not very tasty but this recipe was delicious! I also used butter flavored Crisco and it enhanced the taste. It tinted it yellow but I was coloring it anyway. It was a bit greasy and very sheen which was something I wasnt wanting. Overall, I was very pleased. I will definetely use again.

This was the first time I had ever made or even worked with fondant of any kind. The recipe was so incredibly simple, using ingredients I already had in my pantry. Just mix and use! I did have to had a bit of additional powdered sugar, but no big deal. I love decorating cakes, so I will be using this recipe often and passing it on. THANK YOU!

Pretty easy to make, and the dusting with powdered sugar at the end does help with the greasiness. It was hard for me to get it onto the cake without ripping, after rolling it out- good thing it was a small cake.  Taste wise- better than commercial but I wouldn't call it good. I like it for looks.

This was my first attempt at fondant. It turned out great. At first I put too little powdered sugar in because I didn't want it to get too stiff and crack. When I rolled it out it was falling apart - so I simply kneaded in powdered sugar until I could roll it out smoothly. This was much easier than I thought it might be and so much fun. I'll make this again.

I have never made this recipe before but have made rolled fondant. I found this recipe not to crack as much while rolling out, but it is definately more delicate. (This seemed to be fixed by refridgerating it for a little while.) But, all in all, it was easy to make- I did not have to add all the confectionary sugar as was stated in the recipe itself though. And, as an additional plus, it was super tasty~ (I also thought I should note that I ran out of corn syrup and used honey and it worked well.)

I found this was a little soft, had to keep adding powdered sugar. But was easy to work with and tasted great. I used it over the butter pound from this site for some little bite sized cakes for a baby shower. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first time using fondant, and overall I have to say it came out good. Yeah I had trouble with it tearing, but I found that if I put it in the fridge for at least a half hour it helped. Also I didn't roll it so thin, I did probably 1/4" not 1/8 like it suggests. I will totally be using this one again!

this is a great recipe! used it alot. i have never used fondant before so i don't have a referance to compare to. i had problems with ripping every time, but pieces blended almost unnoticed. it seems as if something is missing. maybe some glycerine would help the greasyness. it tastes really good. and color blends in well. thanks for the recipe!!!

Should definitely let it sit for a bit because it keeps on melting in your hands while kneading. It makes it looks like greasy but once you get more sugar the texture is not that smooth anymore.

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients, but next time I will try another recipe.  This was extremely greasy like everyone said and it cracked all over the place, no matter how much I rolled it I couldn't get the tiny little cracks out.  It didn't stretch well either.  In my opinion, store bought is better than this recipe.  Always fun to try new things though, thanks.

As many others this was my first time making fondant..well it was really my first cake i was trying to make pretty. I used dark syrup cause im a dork and i covered my mess with blue icing. It looks great and i have not had any problems with tearing or crumbling. I cant beleive it just moves where i want it to and doesnt cause creases. Thank you very much!

The fondant looks shiny and feels greasy to the touch. Also, I would prefer if it was more elastic, it would be easier to cover the cake.

I've used this recipe over and over in the last year. It's one of the best Rolled Fondant recipes I have found. If rolled and put on an already Buttercream frosted cake, it taste is excellent. It does take a little practice to use,as any fondant does. Great recipe! Thanks!

Very good. I would recomend mixing the confectioners sugar by hand. It was great tasting, but i couldn't get it thin enough on the cake without it breaking, so it was really thick.

Lots of trouble with this recipe. It was NOT easy. Very greasy, and continued to absorb gobs of sugar, corn starch, and flour trying to get it to firm up. I wondered if the shortening should be cut in half? It was oozing shortening. Maybe my room temp was too high (80)? Took hours to get it right, but it did finally firm up with tons of flour added while rolling. Like others have said, I did also use wax paper to roll it out, as well as a silicone placemat-- worked great to fold it onto the cake afterwards. A little saggy after I pressed and dusted it, popped it into the fridge without any cover, and it firmed up nicely overnight. I would try another recipe next time. Surely it's not this hard to make your own fondant!

I made a couple adjustments, one because of ingredients I didn't have, and another because I had read other reviews and was trying to think about how to overcome some shortfalls of the recipe as written.  First, I used honey in place of the corn syrup, because of not having the latter. It's a well-established substitution, so I doubt anything fundamental changed about the outcome because of it. Second, after I added the amount of confectioner's sugar called for, I began to add flour until the desired consistency of the dough was achieved.  I think it absorbed some of the greasiness better than continuing to use sugar.  True, it was still a bit greasy, but plenty workable. This was my first time using fondant or anything like it, so I won't pin down any flaw in my cake decor on the recipe, rather on my inexperience.  tl;dr recipe worked just fine, but isn't superb.

Greasy when rolling out. I think it was because of the shortening. I had used vegetable shortening. i wouldn't suggest it.

Very easy for my first attempt at making or even using fondant!  I cut out small shapes to decorate cupcakes.  Can't wait to try and cover a cake with it!

As other reviews have said, this fondant was very greasy.  The taste was good, but I will not use this recipe again.

Exactly the look I wanted and even taste great!!   I did tweek the recipe and used butter flavored shortening because it was all I had.  My kids love buttercream frosting but I wanted the look of fondant.  I JUST started baking 'pretty' cakes and I will keep using this recipe.   -Tif

It is really hard to work with. I had a lot of trouble draping it over my cake. I kept getting holes in it, so I had to roll it thicker, but then it just weighed down my cake and made it look frumpy. Wish it were stiffer. I tried more confectioners sugar to stiffen the fondant. Adding more sugar made it fall apart.

This is an incredible fondant recipe, especially for beginners. I used almond extract in place of the vanilla, and people raved about how delicious it was. I've never liked fondant, but this made me a believer!!

Excellent fondant...Tasted very good compared to the ones that use gelatin. But the only issue was it was too soft. Other than that, its a keeper!

The fondant never got firm no matter how much confectioners sugar I added. I couldn't pick it up after I rolled it out because it was so soft, even after I refrigerated it for a while. I eventually did manage to roll it out and put in on the cake but it had to be really thick. Tasted great though.
Good recipe if you're in a pinch.

This recipe is amazing! I have never worked with fondant before...but this was super easy to work with. I did end up having to add about another pound of powered sugar because it was greasy. And when applying it to the cake, it did crack a little. I think I may have rolled it out too thin. But all in all, this was a very good recipe to start out with!

Doesn't taste fantastic and doesn't look as nice as the marshmallow or store-bought fondant, but does get the job done.  Use more powdered sugar on your work surface than you feel is necessary.

This is super easy, wonderful recipe that EXTREMELY EASY to make and use.  I followed the directions exactly and was super happy.  Even have some extra to play with on another day.  I did leave it in the freezer for a bit to firm up making rolling it out between plastic wrap a breeze.

I did not care for this recipe. It tasted very good.  Just like buttercream.  But almost broke my kitchenmaid mixer, then practically oozed grease.  After almost that, it wouldn't hold it's shape and fell apart on the cake.  Ended up having to finish with store bought fondant.

This was my very first time working with fondant and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. This recipe was a little too greasy so the next time I try it I will use a little less shortening. I didn't have clear vanilla so I used lemon and I didn't like the flavor much.
Ok I tried it again and I will not try it a third time. It's too difficult to work with and I still don't like the taste even after using the required ingredients. I'm going to try the marshmallow recipe.

Use a fondant with gelatin instead of this recipe.  I wanted to try this one because it looked simpler than other recipes, but I would not use it again.  Fondant was easy to make, but turned out greasy and was very difficult to work with at normal room temperature.  I refrigerated the fondant, but it became very soft very quickly, and the shapes I cut out of it became distorted.  Fondant with gelatin in it is a bit more difficult to make, but that effort is more than saved when you are actually working with the end product.

The only problem I had with this recipe was that it seemed so oily. Maybe because I used butter instead of shortening? Because it was so oily I couldn't roll it without it being stuck and then tearing. To take care of this I simply added lots of confectioner's sugar and cornstarch. I didn't eat any of it but the people who did said it was good; better than store-bought. Was a good, basic recipe and easy to work with once all the extra powdered sugar was added.

This recipe is so delicious I couldn't stop nibbling at it! I don't know if it's the recipe or my climate, but I had to add a lot more powdered sugar to make it firm enough to mold.

I would use this recipe if i needed a shiny-looking fondant. But if you need a matte looking one, try another rolled fondant recipe, that doesn't have as much fat in it.
p.s: I didn't actually try this recipe, though. I gave it 4 stars because that's its average rating.

This was my first cake using fondant.  I think it came out pretty nice considering I have never made one before and the only "training" I had was youtube how-to's and Cake Boss episodes.   I haven't tasted it yet.  I think it will be good though.  The colors were FAR from what I wanted, but I think RED is impossible to make.  I read you need to add black to the red color, but I didn't have any, so it was either gonna be orange or pink.  I went with orange.  The middle is a dark purple.  Way darker than I would have liked, but still ok.  Not too girly this way - and since it was for my sons 1st bday, I guess thats good.

AMAZING!! I like other cut the butter flavored shortening in 1/2.  It was great, not greasy at all! Amazingly EASY to work with. I have never used fondant before and it was so easy to work with and smooth out. I had a few cracks but like I said it was my first time using fondant. I think next time i will use a smige more shortening.  My husband hates the taste of fondant that we have had a wedding and he ate ALL the left over fondant.  THANKS KELLY!

This recipe is exceptionally easy and tastes good.  The texture of the fondant is smooth and fine.  I'll be using this recipe often and I don't think I'll go back to my other recipes.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I have recently gotten into cake baking and I usually just use the ready to use fondant because it is simple and ready. I wanted to make one from scratch so I decided to try this recipe. This recipe was very greasy in the end and I couldn't do anything with the fondant. I tried to add more powdered sugar and it didn't help so I tried to put in some flour to see if it could dry it up some and still no help. I couldn't roll it out without it cracking and I couldn't put it on the cake without it tearing apart. I also didn't care for the taste. Not at all close to buttercream. This recipe makes me want to just stick with the easy and simple ready to use fondant. Not impressed.

This is the 1st recipe I ever used to make fondant. It worked well but I agree with  previous reviewers that you should sift the icing sugar. It also can get kinda greasy looking due to the corn syrup. It's messy to make, but it works as long as you're careful and don't roll the fondant too thin. Also make sure you don't use "golden" shortening or the colour won't look right.

This was easy to make and rolled out well.I had never used fondant before but will be making this again and again.  I would add gel food coloring while mixing the shortening and corn syrup. Kneading it in is a little messy.

Seemed like it had a bit too much shortening. I tried adding more powered sugar but it didn't do much. The shortening almost made it too easy to crack. (Weird, I know.) Once on the cake it did harden up nicely. I think I'll stick to marshmallow fondant. Thanks for sharing the recipe anyways.

Followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out.It was dry and cracked badley,I Kneaded it for about 20 minutes and tried a few things and nothing helped.I also made a second batch to see if it would come out better with less powdered sugar but just ended up wasting two bags of Powdered Sugar.

used this to make my daughter's birthday cakes two years in a row. makes for a pretty cake and tastes way better than store bought fondant. I suggest practicing a few times before "game day" if ya know what I mean.

this was a good tasting recipe but because there was no flour it was way to hard to put it on my cake and nobody wants to eat it now. There needs to be flour added.

Love the taste, love the texture, it's simple, easy to shape and it went onto my cake well. My only problem is that I find it to be a little bit greasy, and it has a very shiny appearance. Other than that, I would recommend this recipe.

This was pretty greasy and difficult to work with while making decorations for my cake. It did taste alright and was easy to color, but I doubt I will make this again unless I am only covering the cake with it.

I'm giving this a 4 because I am sure I messed up some where. I used the called-for amount of sugar and am assuming this is where I went wrong after reading another review. My fondant came out extremely weak. It was cracking and tearing everywhere. Any other advice?

This fondant recipe was okay. I ended up making my friend a pokemon pokeball cake with this fondant but in hot humid weather it doesn't work haha. It kept melting and it was so hard work with it.  I'm sure I'll try it again in a not so humid weather next time.

My 14 year old daughter made this last night for a cake she had to make for a school project.  She cut the recipe in half and followed the directions.  We put it in the fridge overnight then she took it to school to add to the cake the next day.  It worked out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was our first attempt on making and using fondant, and it was pretty successful. Will Definitely use the recipe in the future, and probably try a thinner layer of icing underneath, and a less moist cake because it kind of started to sag.

I love rolled buttercream and actually used this recipe to cover my wedding cake. I predominantly use this for sugar cookies when I don't have time to use flood royal icing. The flavor is much better than traditional fondant, though a bit more difficult to work w/ as the rolled buttercream has a tendency to soften a bit too much in warm hands.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe! I was really happy with the result, though it was my first time trying fondant. I will definitely use this recipe again. Practice makes perfect!

My 15 year old son decided to bake a cake from scratch as well as make icing and fondant.  This is the recipe he selected.  I was a little skeptical of how it would come out, but it worked out great!  His cake was delicious and so was the fondant.  It was very impressive.  I thought this tasted better then the store bought I used in the past.

Fondant tastes awesome if you plan on eating it by itself.  I have made it twice thinking maybe I screwed up the first time.  It's too greasy.  Once it is pliable enough to roll, it falls apart.  Will not make again

Being my first fondant...very nice. But as others have said, found it tooo sweet also more greasy. But I am looking for a recipe without gelatin thats the reason went for this one. I  like it but not completly satisfied with I got. I am going to try and keep searching but till I find the one this will be my fondant recipe.  I halfed the recipe as other mentioned it required much more sugar. Also used butter flavored crisco. Taste was good but way too sweet for us. I just kept kneading in more sugar till I felt it was right!!

SO quick and easy - i made it and covered a cake in 10 minutes! Tastes 100x better than premade fondant. It takes like bakery frosting and looks very finished and professional. I cannot wait to use it again and again!

I love that this recipe doesn't require the gelatin that many do; I wanted to make my own to avoid the gelatin in many storebought brands, so it's great to find such a wonderful recipe that does exclude that ingredient! Thank you!

I did not care for this receipe. I am making a Thomas the Train cake for my nephews birthday and it was incredibly greasy and I was not able to work with it. I kept adding sugar and it just fell apart. It would not hold it's shape and when I rolled it out to put on the cake it just fell apart complete. I would not recommend this receipe to anyone.

I made this using the "dough" setting on my breadmaker. I added the ingredients in by liquids first and sugar last and let the machine do the kneading for me. I had to add a tiny bit more vanilla because it was too dry for my machine to knead it into a smooth ball. It tastes wonderful!

I used this for my daughter's birthday cake. Unfortunately it was hot and humid the day I decided to do this. The fondant was way sticky. It reminded me of those Airheads candies. After I rolled it out (between two sheets of parchment), it broke in half as I tried to lay it on the cake. I used cookie cutters to cut out butterflies and flowers and "patched" the crack, as I was NOT going to go through that fiasco again. The cake did turn out pretty cute though, and it did taste pretty good, so I am giving it 4 stars.

For a fondant first-timer this was easier than I thought. I read the other reviews and figured it's worth a try.  (I did have to put more sugar than what was asked because it was too sticky at first.)  I used it to coat a 9x13 double layer brownie cake. It turned out lovely.  I rolled it as thin as possible on wax paper "floured" with powdered sugar which made the transfer easy-peasy.  Will definitely use this again.

Awesome taste! This was my first time working with fondant, so I was nervous. It was delicious though. Everyone loved it. I halved the recipe because we make double 9 inch cake (white with strawberries) and had plenty of icing.

I made this recipe with no subtractions or substitutions. It tasted great but was a bit on the greasy side. No worries, because I just added a little more powdered sugar and voila! Perfect! My Happy Jack-o cake looked great!

This was my first attempt using and making Fondant, and it worked pretty well.  Only thing was that it seemed to be pretty greasy and loose.  I kept adding confectioners' sugar, but I stopped because I was afraid it would crack.  It was pretty heavy and tore a lil bit, but ultimately was fine.  Also, if you want your fondant to be white, you need to purchase Fondant Whitener aka Titanium Dioxide.  You can find this at Michaels craft stores.  Otherwise, the fondant will be yellowy (at least mine was).

I just made this and scaled the recipe to 22 servings (half the original recipe). I was nervous it wouldn't turn out, but it turned out great! I also used regular vanilla, clear really isn't needed.

I tried this recipe because it uses ingreds I always have. I made just 1/2 batch and it came out just fine. I made mini fondant roses, following a technique I found on cake central called duff roses. It was very easy.

Turned out pretty good. I used the suggestions, and a lot of them helped. I don't know if this was mentioned or not, but to roll it out, I sprinkled wax paper with powdered sugar, then sprinkled the fondant with more sugar, and rolled it out that way. The sugar made it so the rolling pin wouldn't stick.

Turned out pretty good. I struggled with the consistency and needed to add more sugar but considering it was my first time making fondant of any kind i was pretty happy with the result.

This was my very first time working with fondant and I plan to do it more in the future with this recipe. I made the recipe according to the directions (I used butter flavored Crisco)and it turned out great, perfect consistancy.  I dusted waxed paper with powdered sugar before rolling it out and that helped to get items off without distortion of tearing.  Cut-out items are really easy as well.  This is a great recipe with great flavor.  Everyone at my party thought it was great.  The fondant is a little shiny, but rubbing it with powdered sugar really helps if you are looking for a more satin appearance.

This was my first time using fondant as well and it was super easy!  I made a football cake for the superbowl (my boyfriend's family is from Pittsburgh) and I was amazed at how easy it was to use.  I didn't add all the powdered sugar it called for at fist but eventually added it after dividing & coloring the fondant.  Thank you so much, great recipe!

I had a question for this recipe. Mostly it's to know how to get the bright pink, orange, yellow, green, purple, blue, red, and black colors for this fondant? If you know how can you write a review with the answer?

I did not care for this recipe. not easy to work with. too greasy. maybe its the water in the list of ingredients in my syrup like one reviewer said? does white syrup without water exist? doesnt taste bad, but not worth making. anyway, ill keep looking. :(

This was a great recipe. I made it as directed and it was great. The second time I used "Wilton's Butter Flavoring" instead of vanilla and it was amazing! You can get the butter flavoring at any craft store in the cake decorating section. I only used pre made plasticy nasty one before. I will always use this one from now on.

I was looking for fondant which doesn't require glucose since I was making my cake late in the evening and I realized I didn't have one. 
I found this recipe and I decided to give it a try. I was suprised how nice this fondant came out! I was really impressed and I'm sure I will use it again and again!
I just had to add a little bit of icing sugar more. And very important tip, roll it on the surface which was generously dusted with icing sugar. Be careful, because this fondant is very soft.

This was our first time using fondant, and while there is a bit of a learning curve, we found it not too difficult after reading other comments and taking their advice.  We followed the recipe exactly.  Frosting is always going to taste better, but you can't beat the look of fondant.  We can't wait to make more cakes with it, the possibilities are endless.

This recipe was very easy to make and my first experience with fondant.  I agree with another reviewer that it's a delicate icing.  I experienced quite a bit of breaking when I picked the fondant up to move it to the cake.  I found it easier to roll it out and transfer it to the cake on a piece of wax paper.  Any other little cracks were repaired by coating my hands with a little left over shortening then smoothing it out.  I always make the cakes for my kids birthdays and it's always very stressful.  I used this for my son's 5th birthday (Mickey Mouse theme) and it was the most fun I've ever had decorating a cake and I got several compliments.

Good flavor. Like others said, it needs tons more powdered sugar. I ended up adding twice the sugar to get it thick enough to roll. The end result was good.

This worked really well for me!  It wasn't too wet or too dry! I used a stand mixer and just let it all go until it was dough-like.  I found that when it wasn't dyed, it rolled out better and was less greasy even with adding sugar to the dyed ones.  It was my first time using fondant and I thought it was really fun!  Thanks for the recipe!

It's nice to see a fondant recipe that doesn't use glycerin. It certainly tastes better than normal fondant. However, a bit too greasy for my taste. I fixed that problem first by adding more powdered sugar (made it WAY too sweet) and then I desperately began to add flour. I finally got the greasiness out of it after alot of flour. Nice recipe, but needs tweaking.

I made these cookies with my kids.  We topped them with the best rolled sugar cookies from this website. We rolled it out, cut it with the cookie cutters and attached the fondant to the cookies with a small paintbrush dipped into corn syrup. My kids colored them with edible markers. I would use this recipe for a cake next time, and not cookies - it was way too time consuming. UPDATE - I made this for my daughter's 7 Year old birthday cake and the kids loved it!

One reason Ilove this website is for the honest but not rude reviews.
I like the idea of rolling it out on wax paper. Dough's a bit greasy but can be fixed with a tad of powdered sugar once on the cake.
Tastes great but it's not an inexpensive alternative to frosting.  The corn syrup, shortening and 2 lb. pwdrd. sugar was costly.  I'll use on special occasions.

Horrible experience.  Halved the recipe, but still used almost 8lbs of sugar and it still was greasy.  The flavor was okay, and that's the only reason I'm even giving it two stars.  Try a different recipe, and save yourself the misery.

It was good!!
The only thing is that was very hard to manipulate, on others review they recommend to use more confection sugar which I recommend 100%, I think that you can end up using 3 pounds of confection sugar. To be honest on my first try I didn't work out to good.It was messy and hard to put it in top of the cake, but I think the next one is going to be good; I also recommend NOT to do it for a special occasion without trying first.

This recipe was fabulous. I'd read so many review of breaking, sticky, difficult to use fondant, this one was terrific. I added about 1.5 times the amount of icing sugar to get a better consistency. I wonder if friging it before using it would make it a little more rigid. Also the taste is excellent!

This was the only fondant I've ever been able to make on my own. It is super easy. The only downside was that it was a little greasy, but I just kept on kneading it with powdered sugar. It worked great.

This tastes so much better than the store bought fondant!  It is easy to work with, also.  I did add 1/2 teaspoon popcor salt.  This is what the original recipe called for and does up the flavor.

Never used fondant before, never even had it on a cake I ate, so I really didn't know what to expect.  It tasted good.  It was quite greasy, which I didn't think was right from pictures I saw on Wilton fondant boxes.  I rolled it out thin, it didn't work, tried a little thicker, still didn't work to transfer onto the cake.  I cut it into long triangles (I was making a skirt for a doll cake) and it worked great.  It was easy to smooth and blend together with my hands and you couldn't see the seams after a little work.  The greasy part made it look "sparkly" to my 4 year old daughter and she loved it.  I'm making in again for her cake for the birthday party.

This was my first time making fondant. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out very greasy and it cracked. The more powdered sugar, the better. I will probably experiment with this again, but it has way too much grease.

I tried the recipe and my fondant was too soft. Still worked on the cake but it tore from some parts and there were indentations all over the cake.  I followed the recipe step by step, don't know what went wrong?

Other reviewers were right about the greasiness of this fondant. I chilled it overnight and it remained very soft. I did manage to get it on a six inch cake and it held up okay.  The taste isn't bad, but the texture was that of melting taffy. I made some cupcake decorations, but I had to leave them overnight with a fan on to firm up, and after they were on the cupcakes a while they began to get very soft.  I doubt that I will use this recipe again.

Texture when eaten is like a greasy "AirHead" Candy. Great for cookie decorations, cut outs, etc. Easy to make BUT it really is TOO GREASY. LOOKS WET;  was pretty good FOR draping over a carved/sculpted cake....i just wish it didn't look so greasy. TASTE GOOD TOO THO :)

This is one of my go to cake decorating recipes, I have used it for years. I don't use it for covering cakes though, it is much to soft for that. I love using it for decorations, i've used it for Mario kart, Barbie, flowers, stars and most recently as lettuce and cheese for a taco cake. It always comes out great.

I followed the recipe as listed.  However, when I tried to cover the cake, the fondant started cracking and falling apart.  I tried removing the fondant, re-rolling and refrigerating but the same thing happened.  The fondant tasted great, however.

I'm a fairly new cake-maker, but have successfully applied store-bought fondant to cakes and made creations for cakes out of store-bought fondant, so keep that in mind with my review.

I followed the recipe to the letter, save for adding a little bit of Wilton Butter Flavor to help make it taste a little better. It did help, but the end result still tasted a lot like Wilton's newer fondant so I wouldn't say that this recipe was a huge improvement over store-bought fondant. It may have been a teeny bit better, but that teeny bit didn't help it enough to overcome it's faults.

As far as pliability and being able to use it, this fondant recipe was horrible. I had it in the fridge for appr. 3 hours before trying to flatten it and place it on the cake. I also used it straight on our cold granite countertop (with indoor temperatures at appr. 73 degrees) in hopes that would help. I placed a good amount of powdered sugar on the counter before rolling it out but it still stuck to it. Unfortunately, rolling the fondant made the shortening greasiness ooze out of it and immediately absorb all that powdered sugar and start sticking to the counter.

I won't be using this recipe again.

I used golden syrup instead of corn syrup - not sure if that's why it was more sticky and needed more time to set in the fridge. But once it did, was perfect. Used it on cupcakes and cookies for my son's birthday, and all the shapes held despite it being a humid day.

Very good!! This was my first time making and using fondant. Gave it a 4/5 because i changed the recipe a tad, i only used 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla instead of a whole because i had no clear and had to use regular therefore i didn't want the colour to change too much from white. The colour barely changed with the quarter teaspoon and its still as sweet and flavourful as any other fondant. I kept mine in the fridge overnight.
Just a tip; let sit out of fridge for about 5-10 minutes before handling. Stuck perfectly and smoothly to a lightly iced cake.

If you're looking for a good fondant recipe, then don't try this. Way too greasy and it rips easily. It tasted alright, but I had to throw it away (was not salvageable) because I couldn't even get it on the cake it kept ripping.

When looking for a fondant alternative I stumbled across this recipe. I gave it a go and realized that the more you knead it, the more the oil from the shortening leaches out. The rolled buttercream can't hold up under moderate heat and lacks the "stretch" factor that traditional fondant has. Rolled buttercream also lacks structural integrity and I wouldn't suggest using it on anything you hope to pass off as professional. This is okay for something as small as a cupcake.

I made this strict to recipe, but I added food coloring to make it blue. I'm not sure if that caused an imbalance somewhere, but the fondant ended up either too greasy to roll or fell apart as soon as I tried to put it on the cake. It tasted great, but I'm going to stick it in the fridge overnight before trying again.

It tastes just amazing! I have tried it 4-6 times but it becomes very oily and cracks a lot when i roll it on to the cake. I tried using extra icing sugar, some cornflour and also tried to roll it on the wax paper.

I do really like this recipe! There is a fine line though between it being too greasy, and then cracking if you add too much sugar. This fondant makes it easy to mend areas that have cracked since it is so soft, but because of the softness you just don't get the firm clean look of regular fondant. If you are going for a very clean and even look you may want to chose a different recipe. If taste matters to you more than look (it usually does for me :)) then this is the recipe for you because it tastes ten times better than regular fondant.

I agree with the reviewers that said this comes out a little greasy. I think if you really know what you're doing, this isn't a great recipe. If, however, you're a newbie, the "greasiness" allows you to work with the fondant a TON, which can be a good thing. I was able to incorporate a lot of powdered sugar as I worked with this and figured out exactly what I wanted to do. Overall, it really is okay, but I'm going to look for another recipe for next time.

Thank you for a fondant recipe that doesn't require expensive chemicals. I wasn't able to wrap it around my rolling pin per the video, so I rolled it flat onto a cookie sheet, chilled for 5 minutes, and flipped upside-down onto my cake. I found it easier to do larger shapes than details, this fondant wants to go jagged if you're not doing straight lines or using a cookie cutter. Overall, I am grateful for this simple recipe designed for those of us who don't rely on gizmos and gadgets and chemicals.

Just made this recipe. It was very easy to make but I don't think it tastes like buttercream, it tastes more like divinity. I  like divinity but was disapointed as I was expecting a buttercream flavor.

I followed the instruction, and it came out very greasy. I would add more sugar, and it would look good, then I would roll it...greasy all over. It was a pain and a half to put on the cake. The fondant began to rip. The only thing it had going for it, is the taste.

I did use only 1/2 cup of shorting like other people have said. It tasted great, but I had a hard time putting it on the cake which is why am giving it 4 starts; it was easy to fix it just toke a lot of time. It was not greasy at all. The only other problem that I had was coloring the fondant. I will use it again. 

  I did double the recipe because I made a 4 tier cake that where the cake size is 9 inches each.

I did not care for this recipe. I didnt like it, it tasted good but it looked like a big glob of bubblegum. At first I thought it turned out great. I wrapped it up & put it in the fridge for a few days before I made the cake. But when it came time to use it it was so greasy. It would not roll out, I spent 3 hours trying to fix it. I added confection sugar to try & make it less greasy & pliable to no avail. Desperate to fix it, I even tried to incorporate melted marshmellows which actually helped alot. In the end I got the top of the cake covered, the rest tore off the edges. My cake turned out alright, I improvised, but I was dissapointed with the fondant itself. It was my first time so it could just be I need practice, but personally I will try a marshmallow fondant next time. It did taste good though.

my first time with fondant. i ended up adding an extra half bag of icing sugar to get rid of the greasy appearance. i've never actually tasted fondant so i couldn't tell you if it turned out properly. to my husband and i, it tasted like candy corn (the orange, yellow and white candy you get at halloween). it was really easy to use,especially with a fondant roller so that i could make sure that the thickness was even. i found that using it with chocolate butter cream icing on a chocolate cake was way too sweet, but i'm definitely going to make it again to use to decorate sugar cookies. i think it will be perfect for this and lessen the amount of the time it takes to decorate. i'm also excited about using it to decorate the gingerbread house at christmas.

Works pretty well and tastes better than most fondant. Finished product is rather greasy, but I was going for a cartoon look anyway so it worked out fine.

This recipe tastes pretty good, but it is UNBELIEVABLY GREASY. I added probably 3 pounds of powdered sugar to try to get rid of the grease but it didn't work. I even tried letting it rest on the counter. Still nothing. What's worse is that it is so crumbly in the middle. Its exactly like an air head candy. I can roll it out fine, but moving and trying to smooth it causes it to tear. Is there something I am missing. I have made and worked with marshmallow fondant before and I think I will go back to that.

I only give 2 stars because it was easy to make, and wasn't horrible tasting.  Other then that, found it terribly greasy, very hard to make any figures, and despite trying to "matte" the fondant, the greasiness would only return.  I won't be using again.  Sorry.

i chose this recipe because of the ingredients. Yummy. i wanted to do a beautiful cake for my daughters 1st birthday and i tried and tried and tried correcting this fondant. Added more sugar. Added some cake flour. but it tore no matter what! nothing like the smooth curtain that fondant should be. So this is what i had to do to make it work - ROLLED IT OUT ONTO A BIG PLATE. PLACED THE PLATE ON TOP OF MY CAKE. POPPED IT IN THE MICROWAVE TILL IT WAS WARM AND FELL OFF. SO I MOULDED THE REMAINDER OF IT ONTO THE CAKE. WORKED. TASTED DELICIOUS. WILL I MAKE IT AGAIN? NO.

Easy, breezy. My first time to make it & it turned out pretty good. The taste is just OK, but I was going for the look more than flavor.  I added food color with no problems. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe tasted good, but like someone else mentioned I thought it was quite greasy and not quite the right consistency.

This was my first time trying fondant and I was super excited to try it because things seemed to be going so well. I made some beautiful different colored balls and put it in the fridge. Then I got prepped to roll it out to decorate my cake. It wouldn't roll out, it was greasy and sticky no matter how much confectioners sugar. I ended up having to throw out the whole batch which was dissapointing for how much product I used. I am just glad that it was just a practice run and not for an important event. I will keep searching for a different recipe for fondant. Sorry but this just didn't work for me.

Really good. I used mine to make cut-outs for the tops of cupcakes. I made flowers, hearts, and little shoes and placed them on top of an iced cupcake and they looked adorable!

ok, just one warning, do NOT use vanilla essence and do NOT substitute anything with actual shortening, unless its some real white butter. i was kinda dissappointed because you don't get shortening where i live, and i used normal melted butter. the end result was a color in between yellow and brown, ew! but i think with using the correct ingredients this recipe will be good~

Don't know what I did wrong, but it turned out EXTREMELY greasy. I probably did something wrong, but I won't be using this anymore. Even after I added several extra cups of powered sugar it was not AS greasy, but it cracked and it was really stick so I couldn't get it on the rolling pin, and last it ripped all over when I rolled it out.

Excellent recipe! Negative reviewers must have made a mistake. I was able to make an awesome cake even though I had no experience using fondant. I made no changes to the recipe and everyone loved the cake. The fondant is a bit chewy, which gives a bit different texture than you may be used to. I used some tips such as a rolling pin and wax paper to apply the fondant and you can fix little cracks with a bit of shortening/powdered sugar. I did not make a huge cake... this may not be the best recipe for that.

This fondant worked WONDERFULLY! I both covered a cake in it and cut out decorations. I had to some extra powdered sugar but not much.
For anyone looking for a no-cook, no-fuss recipe for fondant, this is it!

Such a fun way to decorate a cake!  I used 1/2 the shortening and added a bit of wilton butter flavoring - very easy to work with and very yummy!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I don't recommend this recipe.  It tastes nothing like buttercream, and only tastes marginally better than the store bought fondant.  I never could get it to the right consistency.  I guess I'll stick with my marshmellow fondant recipe.....I'm still looking for an amazing fondant that actually tastes good.....I will keep searching!!

This recipe saved my weekend.  I have started selling cakes and I had a fondant cake due for a baptism this sunday.  I used the marshmallow fondant recipe which I always use but for some reason it wasn't working.  I added shortning and kneaded but no luck.  I quickly whipped up this recipe and it didn't require any chilling time (although I am sure that would have made it better).  Even so, it rolled out beautifully, was very soft and stretchy and covered the cake 10 min after I made it.  I was able to salvage the cake and decorate it in time for the baptism.  Very good texture (a bit soft but again I think chilling that would have helped) and I loved loved loved the taste!!  Very good.

I liked the fondant, but it was much too sweet. I couldn't roll it as thin as an 1/8th because it would just fall a part. Other than that it was easy to use and good tasting.

I agree with Amanda - this fondant tastes really good.  It was easy to make, but even after keeping it in the refrigerator over night, it was too soft.  I was able to cover a cake with it, but I couldn't use it to make bows, etc., it wouldn't hold its shape.  I also had a hard time getting it smooth, but in a pinch it works.

This fondant tastes good (for fondant), but was incredibly greasy. We were able to get it onto the cake by rolling it on to wax paper and then sort of flipping it on. However, the finished product was so greasy that it kind of grossed me out to eat it and I wouldn't dare present it at a party. Unless I was making a cake shaped like a satin gown or, I don't know, a shiny jewel.

I would have given this 5 stars, but as my house is not air conditioned and i had 2 kids under 3 running around like hooligans as i was making this, i didn't not realize till it was too late that I had chilled it and then absentmindedly rolled it out on my warm stove top.  needless to say it got extremely soft and when i went to spread it (with hubby's help) it fell all over .  It tasted great and rolled wonderfully....next time i will pay attention to where i roll it.......so for star's for user's problems......next time it'll be 5 stars

I liked this fondant because it overall got the job done but one thing that i didn't like was that it was very greasy! i did every thing in the directons and i did not have a kitchenaid so i mixed with my hands and i bowl and i word very good i made a red bull cake that came out pretty good i like the way it looked other than that it was very greasy i added more sugar and nothing helped but... it got the job done so i can't complain:D

This was DISASTROUS for me. It was so greasy, and I couldn't understand why I had to keep adding powdered sugar after throwing 2 pounds of the stuff at it. I will give it an extra star though, considering this was my first time at the Fondant Rodeo, and I probably DON'T know what I'm doing yet. Thank goodness it was my birthday cake I was making. However, I'm not giving up on fondant that easily...I'm just giving up on this recipe.

First time working with fondant - very easy to make!  Had to use more powdered sugar than recipe called for.  Will definitely use again!

this was my first time making fondant and this was very easy to make, not sure how to get coloring into it without making the whole batch the same color but I figured it out.  The icing worked well for my first time.

This was my first attempt at making fondant. It was not quite as easy to keep in its shape as I expected; I think I should have added more confectioners sugar. I did not enjoy the taste. To me this did not taste like buttercream frosting, but like the roses you get on store-bought cake (are those gum paste?). It's not that it was too sweet- I love sweet icing- I think I just really do not like the taste of fondant. I try to avoid cakes with fondant, but if I make it again I will try to make this recipe stiffer.

Very good but soft fondant - I did make it with butter though so maybe that's why.  The flavor was better though.

This recipe is great, however I did find it EXTREMELY sweet - even for fondant! I added just a bit of almond extract and it gave it a great flavor...I will also be trying a marshmallow fondant to compare and see which gives a smoother finised texture

this was my first time making fondant, and i was really unsure which recipe would be best. i picked this one, because it had a lot of good reviews on the main page. i made 2 batches both at different times for the same cake. i found this one to taste very good, but it was really hard for me to work with, for mostly one reason. it was solid grease. however, i shouldn't compare this with any others, as i have not yet made them. i will not be using this one again, or at least not the next time. if the other one is just as greasy i will come back to this, as the other ones i have found have things that are hard for me to find where i live, this one has things that are basic!

I was trying to make something for Valentine's day and I refrigerated my fondant before working with it and it softened up pretty quickly on me. I put it back in the fridge but I kept getting the same results eventually. It kept getting soft while I was working with it. I kneaded it between wax paper and rolled it out between it too. I sprinkled the wax paper with cornstarch to keep it from sticking, it worked very well but it was really greasy even after I decided to add in more sugar. I finally gave up on it. But on the upside, it tasted yummy.

While the recipe was really easy, and the fondant was as easy to use as playdough.  But I found it to look kind of greasy.  Not sure if I should have added more sugar or what the problem was.

Tastes horrible and I had a hard time getting the right consistency.  I think there is too much shortening.

I could never get these to be anything but way too greasy and shiny for fondant.  Not great for making a nice looking cake, but the flavor was tasty.  I ended up tossing most of it and using just a little to make accents on top of some brownies.

This was my first attempt at Fondant and I thought it was super easy and tasted good. Mine was a little bit dry and I did have some cracking that I didn't know how to adjust. Could have been my fault. Will definitely use again.

This is awesome! My first time ever even working with fondant and it was surprisingly easy!  My daughter helped knead and decorate as it was FUN! It turns out like play dough. It will crack if you use too much powdered sugar, when rolling out. I would use right away instead of trying to refrigerate for awhile it causes moisture on fondant. I will definately be using this for many other cakes and sharing with others. Thanks for a great recipe!

I did everything that the recipe said, however the fondant was still not like a dough. I added more powdered sugar and it tasted WAY too sweet. It gave me a headache. In the end I had to throw away my fondant because it was too sweet and it was not like a dough. I didn't know that I could use flour to make the fondant more dough like so I didn't. Truly a disaster.

This is the first time that I made fondant. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I don't think it was "wedding cake" professional looking but it worked well for what I needed it for.

I hate to say this but I was very disappointed in this recipe. It might have just been me but the final product was very greasy and it was impossible for me to do anything with it. It was too soft and it never got the right consistency for me.
