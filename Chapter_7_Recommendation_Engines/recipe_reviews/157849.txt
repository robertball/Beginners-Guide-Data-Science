We made this last weekend and I must say it is the easiest and tastiest squirrel dish we have had in a fortnight. We used the frozen guys we had down stairs in the ice chest that my boy Delmar shot when he was at his pappies last month. I recon we should use fresh critter next time. Ma loves this one very much and we are going to make it for the annual Stokes family reunion.

The squirrel turned out really tender and just fell right off of the bone.   The broth was very bland and I didn't care for the flavor.  I think celery would be a better fit rather than green peppers.  I ended up adding bay leaves, parsley and a few other seasonings to the broth.  It was a little too watery for us, so I made some herb flavored dumplings and turned it into a squirrel pot pie.  All in all, it wasn't bad and with the changes it is a 5 star make again recipe.

Overall, very good dish.  My in-laws are reserved when it comes to squirrel dishes, however they loved this one.  I would recommend using fresh guys for this, which was recommended in an earlier review.  I would also lay off of the garlic and add more white pepper.  Other than that it was very good.  What more could you ask for in a Squirrel dish.

The squirrel meat came out great, very tender - even the fox squirrel that was in the mix. But I let it slow cook for 10 h on low. Also, after reading the reviews, I added a bay leaf, three or four juniper berries, 10 whole pepper corns, red pepper flakes, dried parsley, celery salt and three tsp brown gravy mix to the broth. The broth was very flavorful; I strained what was left and froze it as a base for another stew.

Our Church was having a wild game supper and I had a lot of squirrel in my freezer, so I tried this recipe. It was a big hit. Many people who have eaten squirrel all of their lives said that they had never had squirrel so tender before. I may never fry another squirrel from now on, and I love fried squirrel. I have made this meal again since the church supper and this time I made it for a book club meeting where I am the only male member. Many of the ladies said, "Ewwww squirrel," but after giving it a taste they ate it up. This time I used 4 squirrels instead of 3 and added a pack of beef stew mix that was made for use in slow cookers. I liked it better this way.

The first time I made this I subbed beef tenderloin for the squirrel b/c my butcher was out of squirrels. Made it yesterday according to recipe with fresh squirrel. Oh my gosh what a delightful meal. Tender and flavorful would be an understatement. I have two picky eater kids and they asked for seconds. Squirrel more plentiful now that it is Fall. I will stock the freezer and enjoy year round. Much prefer having squirrels on my plate than running around my backyard.

This was delicious !!!
  Every year I host a wild game cookout and I used this recipe for squirrel 2 years in a row.   I made the exact same recipe, but one with pheasant legs and another stew with coyote also, and it turned out super delicious !!  There were virtually no leftovers at all. This food got destroyed !!!
