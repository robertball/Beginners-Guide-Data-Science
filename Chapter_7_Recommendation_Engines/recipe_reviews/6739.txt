My sister-in-law gave me this same recipe and it is fantastic.  The only difference is after the punching down and resting step, I then divide the dough into 3 equal size balls.  Roll these balls out into a fairly thin circular shape, use a pizza cutter and cut in 12 equal wedges.  Roll the wedges up from the longer side down to the point, let them double in size, about 40 mins., and then bake as directed.  Because they make so many, I put them in smaller freezer bags after I've baked them.  When I want to use them, simply let them defrost for approximately an hour, place on a lightly greased cookie sheet and bake for about 10 mins. at 300ยบ.

I made this in my bread machine. The only change I made was 3 Tbsp brown sugar and 1 Tbsp white, and I added 1 tsp. ground nutmeg. I used sweet potaots I grew in my garden. I think those who said they were not as orange colored as they anticipated maybe used canned sweet potatos. Mine were very orange, absolutely gorgeous!
I served with honey butter. This is a wonderful recipe and a great use for sweet potatos.

Very easy recipe to make.  You will use more flour than needed because the dough is very sticky.  The taste is wonderful.  What could possibly be better than homemade rolls.  I did use regular sweet potatos and not canned.  It takes about 3 small ones to equal the 1-1/2cups canned.  I too added some brown sugar to the potatos about 2T, next time I think I'll add about 1/4cup.  My rolls were about the size of normal dinner rolls and so this recipe made 24 good size rolls for me.  I would not recommend skipping the step on oiling the pan even if your pan is nonstick.  It really needs the oil.  This recipe has a wonderful taste.  The aroma of the bread rising and baking is out of this world, but I think that on all homemade breads.  I paired this with Angels Beef Stew recipe.

I used 3 fresh sweet potatoes that had been baked and mashed. The color of these rolls was beautiful. My family is avowed sweet potato haters so I didn't tell them what kind of rolls they were scarfing down at Thanksgiving dinner. It was thumbs up all around the table for the soft tasty rolls with none of them realizing they were eating the hated sweet potato. The recipe did require more flour..perhaps as much as a cup. I didn't measure..just added until I had a firm but still sticky dough. Also added 2 T of brown sugar. Used Pam on my hands while forming the rolls so the dough wouldn't stick. They rose perfectly and were gorgeous after they baked. Thanks Sherlie, loved this recipe and plan to use it again.

Yes, these rolls are tender, moist & the color is pretty, but if you are expecting a little more flavor (like perhaps sweet potato) then you may be disappointed.  I too used almost 5 cups of flour instead of 3.  If you are short on prep time, when you go ingredient shopping, substitue "Rapid Rise" yeast... Basically you'll mix all your dry ingredients together (including the yeast), and put the margarine in your saucepan with the water as you heat it (using this method you heat the water to 120-130 degrees).  In the meantime, I pureed my cooked sweet potatoes & the eggs together in my blender.  Once your water has reached the proper temp, add it to the dry ingredients, and then add your blended potato mixture.  Once it's all incorporated, knead for about 5 minutes, then cover for 10 minutes and let rest.  Then you're ready to shape your rolls.  Of course, they need to rise before baking, but you've just saved yourself an hour because you didn't have to wait for it to rise the first time, then punch down, then shape, then rise again, etc, etc.  They are quite tasty, but "subtle" is the word of the day.  What this recipe needs is sweet potato concentrate.  Hmmm...

Wonderful recipe!  I used yams (cooked and mashed) and I substituded 2 c. whole wheat flour for 2 c. of the white flour.  I threw it all in my bread machine without too much trouble.  Works fine for a loaf of bread too.

We loved these rolls and will make them every Thanksgiving from now on.  My one year old could not get enough.  Very moist and great flavor.  I used 1/2 cup extra sweet potato (fresh).

I loved these rolls. The texture is so tender, and they have a delicate flavor--not too sweet. I had 3 small sweet potatoes, so I cooked & mashed those instead of canned. I tried something different--I subbed eggnog for the water and took a tip from EVILBEE and used brown sugar and about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I did add another three cups of flour (1/2 cup of WW) and still had to keep my finger tips floured while pinching off the dough. I got 27 nice sized rolls and a loaf of bread! Great idea for dinner rolls, Sherlie--thanks for sharing.

I used fresh cooked sweet potatoes instead of canned.  Absolutely fabulous rolls!  Ate them with some Honeybaked Ham for breakfast.  I will definitely make these again.

I loved these although I HATE sweet potatoes. I only used 1 cup of sweetpotato (left over from a pie I made for my fiance). He immediately sent the recipe to his mom.

Because I did not have winter squash on hand, I used Trader Joe's organic canned pumpkin. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the cooked squash, melted butter (which I used instead of margerine), eggs and all the dry ingredients. I did need just a touch more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook, a little over half of a cup. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more, adding more flour when the dough would stick to the bottom of the mixer bowl (which it did because the dough was rather sticky). I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 12 minutes was absolutely perfect. HUGE dinner rolls that were soft, fluffy and absolutely wonderful. What a fantastic recipe--so fun to make and the dough couldn't have been easier to work with and the flavor was like an expensive brioche! Another winner from Sherlie--I'm so tickled. Thanks so much for sharing both your wonderful roll recipes! NOTE: I got twelve rolls out of one recipe but they were BIG ones.

I bought some Okinawan purple sweet potatoes at my local Asian store, and some red garnet yams from the supermarket.  I made one batch of purple and one of orange dough, adding an extra 1/2 cup of puree per batch, then alternated them in the same pan.  I also substituted pancake syrup for the white sugar, to give it a light maple flavor.  The rolls were soft and rich, with enough substance to serve with breakfast.

Made two batches of these at Thanksgiving. Worked so good on the dough cycle in my bread machine. All the rolls were gone the day after. Very, Very soft and good.

I made these last night up to the stage where I formed the rolls. Then I refrigerated them overnight, let them rise about 1 1/2 hrs. this morning, and baked them. They came out beautifully. I didn't use the canned sweet potato, I microwaved 2 sweet potatoes and whiped them up to use in place of the canned.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Thanks, Sherlie!

These turned out really well!  The recipe should read 5-6 cups flour instead of 3.  Also, makes more than indicated.  I made 18 large rolls.  Next time I will make them smaller.  I used fresh yams, boiled them till soft, removed the skins and added about 1T. of brown sugar.  I used my Kitchenaid with the dough hook instead of kneading by hand and it was a breeze.  Great flavor and consistency.  Everyone loved them.

These were excellent!! Probably one of the best rolls I have had! They were light & fluffy and I enjoyed the suttle sweet potato flavor. It adds a natural sweetness that makes it so you don't need as much sugar and at the same time, not too sweet.
I made these twice already. I used some fresh sweet potatoes that I had cooked, the first time I pureed them, which took a lot of liquid, so I ended up needing to add ~2extra cups of flower. I had also followed someone suggestion of adding 1tsp of nutmeg. They turned out good and the nutmeg gave it an eggnog type flavor, which my husband loved. The second time I just mashed the sweet potato after cooking it and left out the nutmeg. Then the flower called for was about right, I only needed about 1/4-1/2 C extra. I loved the flavor!!!! They taste great with jam, other dishes, or all by itself!!
Will definitely add to my favorites

Just tried this recipe, very good! I only made half a recipe to use up some left over cooked sweet potato. It is a sticky dough but I just patted it out and scooped with a floured ice cream scoop and plopped it in the pan. Baled @350 for 20 minutes.

I was a little confused after reading older reviews until I came across an AR review that said they had updated the recipe to reflect the original submission.  That explains why so many people needed so much extra flour!  These are very soft, delicious rolls!  I used fresh sweet potato (about 3/4c) but didn't taste the sweet potato flavor at all.  Some reviewers said they were slightly sweet, which I was looking forward to, but I didn't think they were.  I used Smart Balance instead of margarine and about 4 total cups of flour.  I mixed it in my KA mixer & got 15 total rolls that I baked for 20 minutes in a 9X13 glass pyrex dish.  After the first 12 minutes, I brushed the tops with melted butter & put them back in the oven.  Next time I'll add a little more sugar but overall they were tasty.

If you want a faster prep time, read on! I used a one-rise method for this recipe, using instant yeast (1 1/2 tsp) instead of active dry yeast. Here's how I did it. I scalded 1/2 cup milk (instead of the water), added COLD margarine and sugar to cool it down, added the yeast, sweet potatoes, and 2 cups flour (next time I'll use only 1) to form a sponge. I mixed this for 5 minutes, then let it rest for 5 minutes. After it was done resting, I added the eggs and the salt and then added flour to make a soft dough. I kneaded it for 7-8 minutes and then made it immediately into rolls. I let those raise to double, and then baked them. The one-rise method is a ton faster, and the results were wonderful.

Thanks for the recipe. 
The rolls are soft and lovely. I added 1/2 teaspoon of bread softener and piped some custard on top of the rolls before putting them into the oven, to give a lovelier taste to it.

Wonderful!  Used brown sugar instead as reviewers had sugested.  They were a big hit at Chrismas!!!  I made them a week ahead of time and froze them.  Left them on the counter for an hour to defrost then popped them in the oven for 10 min on 350.  They tasted awesome!

I tried this recipe with pumpkin substituted for the sweet potatoes.  It was wonderful.  I did use some additional flour.  Will certainly make again.

Prepared the dough in my bread machine. I used 1/4 cup honey instead of the sugar. Microwaved and mashed my sweet potatos - used close to 2 cups. Added about 1/2 cup extra flour and then a few Tbs of orange juice when I decided the mix was a little dry. The dough was more sticky than I expected, but handled okay when I floured my hands and counter. They were AWESOME! 8 adults for dinner nearly wiped out the whole batch. I served with jambalya and the slightly sweet, light rolls were a perfect match to the spicy, heavy rice dish. I will absolutely make again - probably next for Easter dinner with ham.

Bless You Sherlie, for sharing this wonderful roll recipe !!!  My 3 children loved these.  I made a test batch before Thanksgiving and they loved them. They even put some back for later...and they ate them as snacks and the 3 year old even wanted them for breakfast !!!  My 12 year old had some friends over and she made them try them.....and then I was asked for the recipe by the girls to give to THEIR mothers !!!!  Its a wonderful recipe !!!

I even cheated and it was still great!  I used my Kitchen Aid as the mixer and kneader and they were so light and fluffy in texture!  I used fresh sweet potatoes and boiled them myself, then mashed them instead of using canned as my family isn't real big on canned foods in general.  Freaks...but anyway, with using fresh sweet potatoes the color is just gorgeous!  I was worried about the color turning the kids off, but it didn't.  Or my husband for that matter.  He devoured them as fast as the kids did ! This is now an often requested recipe at our house...& its a healthy one too!  Wonderful way to get the BetaCarotene in your kids without a fight! Great recipe !! Thanks !

Very pretty to look at but not a lot of flavor.  I used olive oil, maybe that was my mistake, would
recommend using regular veg. oil instead. Probably wont try these again.

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner, and they were a huge hit!  Even my kids, who can't stand sweet potatoes, devoured them.  A few alterations I made were...1) I used fresh sweet potatoes, steamed then mashed with a little butter and pineapple/orange juice.  2) I used brown sugar instead of white.  3) brushed the tops with butter after I pulled them from the oven.  Next time I make these, I may try using buttermilk instead of water.  I have already been told that I will need to make these again for sure!

These are some of the best dinner rolls I have ever tasted, let alone made myself.  I wish I could give them more then 5 stars!!  I did lower the oven temp to 350, and baked 20 minutes.  After removing from the oven I rubbed butter all over the tops, as I do with all rolls and Bread, other then those minor differences, I made just as directed.  Will make these may more times, and tell all my bread making family and friends about these wonderful, yummy, rolls!!  Thanks Sherlie!!

I had some sweet potato puree leftover from another recipe, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  The rolls don't really taste like sweet potato but that actually worked out well for us since DH isn't a sweet potato fan.  I made no changes, but I did throw all of the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle and then proceeded with step 3.  I'm not sure why some people had to add so much extra flour - 3 1/2 c. was just right for me.  My rolls were done in 13 minutes.  Thanks.

Excellent!  These rolls are so moist and tender and the balance of flavor is perfect.  They're just as good with beef stew as with apricot jam, and my 1 year old, who does not like bread, gobbles these up!  I used 1 T. white sugar with the yeast and 3 T. brown sugar for the rest of the recipe.  I also used mashed baked sweet potato instead of canned, butter instead of margarine, and I stirred in 2 c. whole wheat flour and then about 1 2/3 c. white flour and let the dough rise one more time before forming the rolls.

My friends and family absolutely love these rolls.  I've made these a few times already, and the only thing I changed was to add some brown sugar and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes.  They're only slightly sweet, so it complements just about any main entree.  Superb!

My first attempt at made from scratch, knead your own dough, rolls.  LadySparkle suggested this recipe for me try.  The taste is wonderful, but I have a long way to go to learn to make nice smooth rolls.  The sweet potato added a nice taste and a very pretty color to this roll.  I made several batches to try and get a smooth finish.  Each batch was better than the batch before, but I'm not there yet.  I dried the "ugly" ones to use as bread crumbs.  The crumbs were wonderful on AR "Cauliflower Romaine Salad" and I used them on some baked chicken.  Thanks SHERLIE for sharing your recipe.  I will be making again as my family and extended loved the taste.  Thanks also to LadySparkle for the suggestion.

These don't taste too sweet potatoey but they are some of the moistest, softest, fluffiest, tastiest rolls I've ever made. Love them. I cut the recipe in half but still used 3 cups flour. I used canned sweet potatoes (not puree) and pureed them with the egg, sugar, etc in the blender. Added the flour and yeast mixture in the mixer, mixed until incorporated and then switched to the dough hook to kneed for a few minutes. Even my husband likes them and he hates bread. I'll definitely make these again. probably next week. :)  thanks!

Interesting concept, but I didn't like these because they were dry and slightly crumbly. If you are going to take the time to make your own rolls, keep looking - and this from someone who has made a lot of breads and rolls over the years.

My daughter's nutritionist suggested I make my daughter breads with vegetables.  While "sweet potato" is not a vegetable I liked the nutritional value.  I used three jars of baby food sweet potatoes and 3 total Tbsp of honey instead of sugar.  Required about 3/4 cup flour more for the right consistency.  Allowed to rise in muffin tins.  Came out great.  Will make again.  Next time will use real mashed sweet potatoes.

These rolls are awesome! I use 3/4C boiled & Mashed Sweet potatoes, 3T of Dark Brown Sugar, 1T of White Sugar, 2tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice. I tested them on a group of friends and they ate every single one of them. One lady even stuffed on in their purse lol, another wants to pay me to make another batch. I WILL be making these again tonight and for thanksgiving! I'm so glad that I tried this.

These rolls were very good, but they didn't have a very strong taste of sweet potato. Everyone who had one loved them. I did not use canned sweet potato, I used sweet potatoes that I cooked in the microwave.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit.  My husband who doesn't usually like rolls really loved these and other family memebers really raved.  I thought they were pretty good but I'm giving them 5 stars based on my family memebers response.  I baked one whole sweet potato and mashed it and that instead of the canned and brushed meted butter on top after they baked.  These were a great addition to the holiday meal.

OMG . . .I made these rolls for Thanksgiving, and I know the Recipe said you could make @ least 16 balls but instead  i made two pans about 6 medium size in  each pan and my family ate the first pan before we even started having dinner  so they've ask me to make them for Christmas dinner! Btw I made some honey butter for them to put on the rolls, they were delicious

Even with my very limited experience with yeast dough, these came out very well! Very light and fluffy.  I did use fresh sweet potatoes and I added about 1/4 cup more to the dough.  They still did not really taste like sweet potato at all. The dough was very easy to work with, I did add a bit more flour.  I will definitely be making these again!

Wow---these were phenomenal!  I used 1 T brown sugar and 3T white sugar.  I used less flour (by accident) and the dough was relatively sticky.  I also used fresh yams.  They turned out so tender and fluffy.  My guy said they were definitely restaurant quality.  They were the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner!

this was a great recipe :) but what you want to make sure that you do is to bake it in a 9x13 inch pan! we made the mistake of baking it in an 8x8 pan. They turned out yummy, but they were a little odd shaped :) still great!

The first time I had sweet potato rolls was when I met my husband's family in rural VA.  They were to die for.  I was always intimidated by the women in his family who made them.  This past Thanksgiving, I found this recipe and "tried".  I woke my husband up at 3am "taste it".  He loved them!  I had 3 of them on the spot.  They were the talk of my dinner gathering.  My German neighbors ask for them now.  My only regret is that one batch didn't make 3 dozen vice 1.  :) Thank you so much!  I'm going to now to try it with pumpkin.  Can't wait to see if that works.

These were super good! I used 2 roasted, mashed sweet potatoes instead of canned.

These rolls were very good. The dough was sticky and hard at times to form the rolls but I dipped the pieces in a little flour before forming rolls and that did the trick. Dispite the little trouble forming them, the rolls were very tastey and worth it. They were very easy to make. I reduced the sugar to 2 TBS and used butter instead of margarine. I also used fresh sweet potato. I will definitely make again as these were one of the best rolls I have ever tasted.

well, i was somewhat disappointed with how my rolls came out after reading everyone's reviews.  mine turned out heavy and a little dry.  the dough was sooooooo sticky, very frustrating!  in total, i probably used about 4 1/2 c. of flour.  i was expecting "flaky, light" rolls like everyone else.  oh well, you win some, you lose some!  but i'm not gonna try this one again.

Used the recipe for pizza dough! Cut it by 1/3 so I could use my 2-cup bread machine; used 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes and omitted the eggs. Dough was sticky, slightly runny, but poured it out onto pizza stone and spread it w/ a spatula. Topped the dough with several spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce  and 1 bag of rinsed, frozen veggies; as the whole thing was generally wet, I pre-baked it (just stuck it in the oven while the oven was preheating to 450 degrees). Once the crust had started to crisp just a bit, I added several handfuls of shredded mozzarella and returned to oven for about 20 minutes. Raised beautifully, tasted superb. Will definitely make again!

I was a little leary on how my family would like these, but I made them anyway!
They were so yummy and moist!
I did make a few changes though: 
1. I used cinnamon sugar instread of regular. It gave it a little sweeter. flavor, almost like challah bread.
2.I added 1T. of wheat gluten.
3.I used all wheat flour.
4. My 13x9in pan could only fit 15 so that's how many I made.
5.After they came out, I brushed them with butter. Yum!

Fresh from the oven with real butter these were close to heaven. I cheated and used the kitchenaid mixer so that actually they were a breeze to make. I also used fresh boiled sweetpotatos and more flour than called for. Much more, I ended up using close to six cups. Needless to say I ended up with nearly 40 good sized rolls, not 18, which was fine since I fed 16 people this thanksgiving. Really easy, really good, and even picky I-hate-sweet-potatos grandkids scarfed them down.

Everyone said it was a success. I used much more flour than called for like everyone else. I made small rolls for my son and it made about 3 dozen. My 3yo absolutely loves these rolls and nearly ate half of them over the weekend. They have the slightest hint of sweet potato, I wish there was more but it still is wonderful. Will definitely be making again and again. Thaks for sharing this great recipe!

These turned out incredibly soft.  The sweet potato taste was rather subtle, but definitely there.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and added a touch of nutmeg, plus extra flour (half a cup).  Very tasty.

Delicious and a huge hit at dinner tonight. Cut out half the sugar and ended up (as others have commented) using 4+ cups of flour. Served warm with butter...to die for! Can't wait to slice and toast one for breakfast..maybe a bit of ham would go nice with it!

I am "new" in the kitchen, and this was the first bread I have ever made. It was so SIMPLE and easy and they came out GREAT. Because I made candied sweet potatoes also, I used fresh ones, and used the water that I boiled them in in this recipe. I took them for Thanksgiving, and everyone was impressed I actually made them myself! It seems I had to add a bit more flour than the recipe called for because it was too sticky but other than that they are perfect!

Followed recipe as written except that I used freshly baked sweet potatoes and used the bread machine to make dough.  These are the best rolls I've made!  Beautiful texture, color and delicious:) 

Make now, bake later:

Make the dough and form the rolls placing them on the baking pan.  Put the pan into the freezer and when frozen, put the frozen dough balls into a ziplock bag and then put them back into the freezer (they won't stick to each other) 

When you want a couple of rolls for dinner, take the dough rolls from freezer and place on cookie sheet. Put the pan inside a clear plastic bag until they have thawed and then risen about double in size and bake as per recipe.

As I read through all the reviews I'm noticing one big problem - everyone is using triple the amount of sweet potato that the recipe calls for and therefore has to use more flour. If you follow the recipe, as is, with just 1/2 cup of sweet potato then flour shouldn't be an issue. I only needed 3 cups of flour for mine and they turned out soft, sweet and delicious!

I've made these dozens of times now. I do add a couple of tablespoons of gluten. (I know, but love the rise!)  I also always use bread flour. Have used whole wheat flour and bread flour mix.  Often put in flax seed meal.  Every once and a while, I'll reduce the flour a bit and put oatmeal in for a totally different texture. Always use butter as I am not a fan of margarine at all.  I've had quite a bit of fun with this recipe and love the color, taste, and texture. Follow the directions exactly (well, except for do use bread flour and real butter) and you will get a splendid roll.  Then keep tweaking to your heart's content to suit your fancy. I've never had a bad tasting batch of rolls come out of this no matter what I do.

This rolls are delicious.  You can not taste the sweet potato at all which is neither good or bad, its just what it is.  They taste like a good quality sweet dinner roll.  I liked them best hot with jam on them!  I used coconut oil in replace of the margarine (I never ever use margarine...yuck!).  I also used fresh sweet potato steamed in the microwave.  Made these rolls in the bread machine then cooked in the oven.  I did NOT have to add any more liquid or flour to make it work in the bread machine which was nice.  I will definitely be making these again!

I made this because I saw that some reviews said they used leftover mashed sweet potatoes.  They turned out so delicious, I am making more as we speak.  My youngest daughter and myself love them and will make them whenever I have leftover sweet potatoes.  We have them when they are warm with butter and we have reheated them and put butter and cinnamon sugar on them.  Both ways are just so wonderful.  I even have doubled the batch this time to be able to freeze them for another time.

I made these today (Easter 2012) and they were delicious!  The only change I made was to use 2 T brown sugar and 2 T white sugar.  I think the reason the dough is so sticky for some is that they use too much sweet potato puree.  Stick to the original recipe which calls for 1/2 cup and you will be fine.  I also used my KA mixer with the dough hooks and eliminated the kneeding.  Made 2 pans of 10 each.  Be sure to brush with butter while hot and they will be great.  Mine looked just like the pic.

These made a delicious sidedish to our Easter turkey dinner.  Just a hint of sweetness.

I boiled and mashed sweet potatoes and set the potato water aside for use as the liquid in this recipe.  I made the dough in my bread machine, which worked out well.  

I then divided the dough up into 54 balls (18 x 3), in order to form "clover leaf rolls" by placing three small dough balls together in a greased muffin tin.  I allowed them to rise another hour before baking for 12 minutes.

Perfect!

Very good.  Even the leftovers were soft and fluffy a couple of days later.  I put the ingredients in my bread machine, and brushed an egg wash on top before baking.  I used mashed baked yam instead of sweet potato puree.

I changed a few things: I used safflower oil instead  of butter, used half whole wheat flour, subbed brown sugar and molasses for the white sugar, and used just a bit more mashed sweet potato.  Despite all this, they were still great.  

Half were made into dinner rolls while the other half was used as a base for cinnamon rolls.  As mentioned more than a few times, they don't really taste like sweet potato, but they were still tasty, fluffy, and moist.

I think I'll add a wee bit more salt next time, as they were just a bit flat.

I really liked these, but they did not get the rave reviews expected. (I guess you have to like sweet potatoes.)  I thought they were a perfect accompaniment for a pork chop dinner.

These rolls were fantastic!! I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in the bread recipe and allowed the kitchen aide mixer to knead adding another 1/2 cup of flour not allowing it to stick to the bottom. I think these are a must for Thanksgiving with honey butter!

Fantastic! I used this dough for cinnamon rolls, and I'll deffinatly use it again. Then to really go over the top I took the leftovers and made french toast out of it and topped it with raisin syrup (1 c. raisins boiled in 1 1/2 c. water a touch of cinnamon and puree). My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!

These were very good. Soft, fluffy and perfect. Used the leftover rolls to make a ham sandwich. Yum! My hubby really loved these too. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these with left over squash instead of sweet potoatoes and used 60% whole wheat flour.  Still delicious!  It made 32 small crescents.

Delicious - made 1 batch sweet potato and the other pumpkin.  Made another batch using pumpkin again and made raisin bread.  Will definitely make again!

I halved the recipe and replaced 2/3 of the sugar with brown sugar and used a baked yam, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Unlike other reviewers, the amount of flour called for was a little much (then again, it was a pretty dry day). The rolls came out nice and crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a more yam/sweet potato flavor. I could taste it, but it was very subtle. That said, they looked great and I immediately devoured three right out of the oven! However, I might try to either up the amount of sweet potato (or yam) next time and probably play around with some spices like nutmeg and cinnamon, as well as maybe ad a bit more sugar. Overall, not at all like I expected, but still good.

So easy, I did add 1 tsp. nutmeg and used fresh sweet potato's.  Rolled the dough out into 3 circles and made them in the shape of cresent rolls.  Put a dz. in the freezer for Thanksgiving next week.  Nice way to get some veggies into ppl., like hubby, who shies away from all veggies except the white potato.  Thanks for another great recipe.

This is a very adaptable recipe, I just wish the ratios of flour and sugar were corrected. I used 2 T of honey instead of 4 T white sugar since I was looking to make a wholesome sandwich bread without any sweetness. I also ended up using 4 1/2 to 5c. whole wheat flour (Golden Buffalo flour to e exact - you can find it in the bulk section of many natural foods stores/co-ops). I used vegetable oil rather than margarine, and added 1/4c+2T ground flax meal for added nutrition. Rather than rolls, I made loaves of bread. One recipe (using the 4 1/2 c. flour) makes 2 standard sandwich loaves. You don't need to let the loaves rise as much as you would think because the eggs make it puff in the oven. I live at 4000 feet elevation, and baked the loaves at 375F for 25 minutes. The flavor is subtle, light, slightly-earthy, and DELICIOUS. It toasts really well too! I will definitely be making this again, but with whatever sweet-orange vegetable is in season: pumpkin, butternut squash, carrots, maybe even sweet corn...

These were very very good. I didn't have sweet potatoes so I used acorn squash instead. The dough is indeed very sticky and I ended up having to use additional flour but they still turned out awesome!

This was a really good recipe. I used real sweet potato (yam) and demerara sugar. I used a 50:50 of ww flour and apf.  The dough was really, really soft and moist, I used almost 2cups of dusting flour when kneading. So I think next time I'll just use more flour in the original recipe. I think they needed the full 20mins baking time, but I took mine out after 15mins (I'll go the full time the next time I try them.) The true test was the next day, the rolls were still soft and delicious. I will make these again, and try to substitute the butter this time to see how they turn out. Excellent use of sweet potatoes.

Whoa- I made a bad mistake! I couldn't find any canned "pureed" sweet potatoes but I did find canned yams and candied yams. I went with the candied yams b/c of other reviews that added sugar. I kept everything else the same. They came out great but taste very strange. Almost like they have liquor in them? Anyway, I will try again with plain yams. (BTW, I just put them in the food processor)Also- it took a little over an hour to rise and about an hour for them to double. So be prepared for a little time invested. Also- cooked mine in two 8" round pans, for 15 minutes. Came out perfect.

WOW! These rolls are very moist.  You can't even taste the sweet potato so your kids will never know that they are good for you, you'll just have to explain the orange color.  The dough is sticky and messy to work with but worth the trouble.  I used half wheat flour and half white.  very good.

Great rolls served warm with maple butter! It did require a lot more flour--a great tip found by reading the reviews first.

These are amazing! I made these yesterday (the day before Thanksgiving) and they still tasted wonderful and weren't dried out for today. I used one whole egg and 2 yolks to give them a nice yellow color in addition to the sweet potato and they were beautiful. My only complaint was that the dough was VERY sticky to work with. I ended up using about 6 cups of flour to the whole recipe, and the dough was still incredibly difficult to work with and shape into rolls. I ended up just dropping lumps of dough into the pan and baking them. They still came out great, and I got 3 dozen dinner sized rolls from the recipe.

These rolls are wonderful and so easy to make.I usually don't have very good luck with yeast rolls,but these were a breeze.I used 1 can of sweet potatoes and 1 left over baked.I would like to try them with whole wheat flour next time,which will be in a few days(that's what I've been told) lol.Again,great rolls! Ya gotta try them!

Very light and fluffy inside, and dense and delightful on the outside.  I could not taste the sweetpotato- it just made roll more like potato bread in texture.  My mum loved these.  They remind me of honey bread which we used to buy at the local bakery for school.

I hadn't read other reviews before making these..but wish I had.  I ended up using about double the amount of flour..and kept wondering what I'd done wrong...but that sounds like a common occurence.  That being said..these were beautiful and delicious, smelled wonderful while baking..and were very soft and light as a feather.  I did some in a cake pan..and another batch on a cookie sheet.  If you bake them in the cake pan, plan on an extra 10 minutes or so in the pan..otherwise they'll be doughy.

This is a delicious bread.  I made a loaf instead of rolls and it was huge.  Will make rolls and a loaf next time.  Thanks for the heads up about the flour.  It took quite a bit more.  Will make this again many times, I'm sure.

These rolls were delicious!!  I made them for Easter this year with a ham and they were gone so quickly.  Although I needed to add a bit more flour, the recipe is great!

I made these for my family this Thanksgiving and they were a big hit!  I pureed the potato in an electric mini-chopper and it worked fine.  I think this will be a standard recipe for me!  I added a bit extra sweet potato than called for and they tasted wonderful.  The color is beautiful!

These were soooooo good!  I made them last Thanksgiving using our leftover sweet potatoes!  We made ham sandwiches on them - so good!

The softest rolls I ever  made! I used one cup of a mashed baked sweet potato instead of canned.  I used 3 1/2 cups of flour as the recipe says, using a Kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook. I've read that dough should be as sticky as the back of a post it note for a soft bread and this dough was slightly more. I lightly floured my hands when rolling into balls so the dough wouldn't stick to my fingers. I made 20 rolls and baked them at 350* for 14 minutes. Perfect! Will make again!

I did use the bread maker to mix the dough, so I cannot vouch for the instructions.  The ingredients, together, though, made a light, fluffy, moist, and delicious roll.  It didn't have a lot of sweet potato taste; might as well have been a regular old roll other than the pretty color.
Edit:  After reviewing the nutrients of sweet potatoes, I changed this to 4 stars.  Might be an excellent way to trick a kid into eating Vitamin A and potassium.

We liked this a lot!  I made some changes: I used one cup of mashed sweet potatoes, not canned.  I combined this with the softened butter and eggs, using a mixer to blend.  I used egg substitute (1/2 cup= 2 eggs).  I tossed all of this in the bread machine with the salt and only 3Tbs of sugar, and started the machine on the dough setting.  I use dry active yeast with a pinch of sugar in warm water and don't add until the yeast mixture is bubbly.  I used 2 cups of wheat flour and one cup of white bread flour.  let the bread machine mix it, and added about another half cup of white bread flour ( I would not add so much flour next time though!). Note: it is OKAY for the dough to be sticky! Especially in the bread machine, as long as it doesn't stick to the sides, you are okay! After the bread machine had the Doug mixed well I just unplugged it and let it rise in there with the lid closed for an hour or so.  Sprayed two small square pans with cooking spray and put some oil on my hands while rolling the dough into balls.  Baked for about 15minutes and rubbed a stick of margerin on the rolls when they came out of the oven.  Changes for next time: I'd go ahead and do the 4Tbs of sugar, use a little less flour, and use real butter for the top after they come out of the oven! Definitely a keeper! Great with honey or with a hearty roast or stew!

Best roll recipe. I did brown sugar instead of regular and added just a little more sweet potato. I just used canned. As others have said, more flour is needed than it calls for.

This was my first attempt at making homemade rolls without my bread machine.  They turned out perfect.  They were a beautiful color and texture and just the right sweetness.  I was able to use our homegrown sweet potatoes which made me feel great.  I can't wait to make these again!

I had some sweet potatoes that I needed to use quick so I fo this recipe. I roasted them in the oven. I mashed them with brown sugar, nutmeg and salt. I added that to the proofed yeast then the eggs and mixed well then I added flour. It was very sticky, I added at least 5 cups of flour. My house was cold but the dough did rise. They were delicious. I would make this again, I'm looking at my butternut squash, wonder if that would work......

Not sure what I was expecting, I wasn't really wanting an overpowering taste of sweet potato that I'm sure of. Anyway, not much of sweet potato flavor in these just kind of an odd flavor (not bad) just odd. I prefer regular potato rolls really. I might try using baked sweet potato in them sometime as others suggest maybe that would bring somewhat of a richer flavor and deeper color.

Used the dough cycle on my bread machine to mix these up, then let the dough rise in the bowl as instructed. I split mine up between two smaller square baking dishes, baked, and then stuck in the freezer for future use! I did try one, and it was yummy. Can't wait to heat them up and brush with some butter.

Oh my - these were phenominal!  My favorite rolls so far!! I didn't make it exact, but I have no doubts that it's fine as written. I had butternut squash to use up, and where many said they used pumpkin I felt the texture was similar enough and we really loved these! I doubled the recipe, and used 3c all purpose & 3-1/2c whole wheat. They rose like no other dough I've made so far!  I am going to make these often, I saved some of the butternut squash in the freezer just in case this came out good - it really did! :)

not bad, but I must confess I was expecting something more: the sweet potato didn't come out at all, and they were simple rolls, quite as usual; normally when you add potatoes the bread is softer and fluffier, not so this time. So, I'll stick with plain potato rolls.

These rolls were delicious. I added a little extra sweet potato so that the taste would show up in the rolls. I'm glad I did! I also followed the suggestion of another person and made honey butter to spread on them, and WOW. My husband says it tastes like something you'd get at a restaurant. This recipe is a keeper!

These were very good. I replaced the sweet potato with mashed pumpkin because it was what I had on hand.  Sadly, I could not detect any pumpkin taste, but it did give the rolls a beautiful color and texture. As made, I would only give these  4 stars, but I will allow that using sweet potatoes might have made the difference. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these using fresh mashed sweet potato. I also used half whole wheat flour (I need four cups of flour total). They turned out nice and fluffy, but I didn't find there was much sweet potato flavour, or a lot of flavour period for that matter. I will try again and add more sweet potato and some cinnamon and nutmeg next time.

These rolls were fluffy but filling.  The sweet potato didn't add an overpowering flavor, which we liked.  I am a novice bread maker, so I was afraid to add too much extra flour to the dough and, as a result, shaping my rolls was very difficult and they did not look very pretty in the end.  Next time I will not be so timid with the extra flour!

I did not do a good job of following the directions on this and they still turned out great.  I had so much going on that I let the dough rise overnight and then after I rolled it into balls it sat so long that they way more than doubled in side and I kept trying to "punch them down" to keep them from completely blowing up.  The dough was also really sticky and I was really not counting on much...they baked beautifully though and we loved them.  My kids (3 and 5) really love them.  If I did that much wrong and the still tasted good, I'm impressed!  Thank you!

Very good dinner roll, however I used a real mashed sweet potato and the roll wasn't very sweet. Next time I will use a sweet yam instead and maybe go with some brown sugar and a little spice. Still a good roll though and this was my first time making a yeast roll!

I made these just as written, although I couldn't find sweet potato puree, so I had to puree it myself in the blender.  The dough was very, VERY sticky, so I'll add more flour next time.  (I should have read more reviews first!)  And being that I have never made rolls before, I made them way too huge.  (I only got a baker's dozen.) The flavor is AWESOME, however, and my 7-year-old is on her second one as I type.  Thanks for the great recipe, I plan to perfect my technique before Thanksgiving!!!!

People loved these when I made them, but I'm not sure I completely loved them.  I may make again, but they are not something I could get addicted to.  The  sweet potato has an "after taste", as well as I can explain it, but many people like that taste  - it's probably what makes this unique.  Try it, you may love it!

Great tasting bread.  I had to use a lot more flour than what the recipe called for but other than that it had a great flavor.  My family definately loved this one.  It is a keeper.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I am the roll maker for holidays and this year I tried this recipe and it was a huge hit.  I had many requests to make it again for Christmas so here I am making them again!  I ended up using about three more cups of flower than called for and ended up making around 48 rolls with this recipe.

I was awed by how pretty and tasty these were. I expected a sweet potato taste but was shocked that there was not one and the texture of these rolls were so fluffy that I don't think I can go back to my old bread recipes anymore.

Very good. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out really well. I followed someone's suggestion to use 3 sweet potatoes, but I had well over 1/2 a sweet potato left over. Would use 2 next time.

This is a marvelous recipe. The rolls were superb. Tender, fluffy, barely sweet. Very easy. I used butter, boiled sweet potatos, and used the water from the cooking to proof the yeast. As others have noted, it takes a good deal more flour than three cups, more like five or six, and it made 24 very big rolls. Got rave reviews from the family and even the picky kids were asking for seconds.

Rolls were good. Soft, and a good consistency.  I found a couple things I would change. It needs a little more flour to ensure the dough isn't sticky after it rises.  Also, I didn't taste much sweet potato in the cooked bread, and I felt like the overall recipe was missing something. Maybe salt? Maybe sugar?  I topped put honey butter, and it actually tasted better.

this recipe is superb... you may have to allow a bit more time for the rolls to rise but they are fluffy and delightful... the sweet potato taste is not too overwhelming for those who do not like sweet potatoes... i've made these over and over!!

I followed some of the other reviewers and used baked sweet potatoes.  The rolls are very good, but not over-the-top great.  What I like so much is that there is so little margarine used.  I compared a lot of other roll recipes and they called for 1/2 cup of shortening!!  So, these are healthful and pretty yummy, too.  I will make them again.  :)

This is a good base recipe as is, and i highly recommend the following adjustments: 

Scale up double, including the yeast and water, it scales perfectly
Sift your flour after you've measured it to reduce the additional flour needed
Substitute half the white sugar with brown
Add 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice or the same amount of suitable spices

Don't be afraid if the dough is a bit sticky, it will firm up after rising. So good, I will use this recipe in the future!

made it as bread loaf. used one full cup of mashed home-baked sweet potatoes. Was good but lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion. Good sliced, tasted with almond butter and marmellata. It's very similar to Stella parks' yeasted pumpkin bread, but her bread was buttery and flavorful.

This is an okay recipe. I would strongly suggest using fresh yams. I did not the there is no flavor there. Secondly, I used closer to 4 1/4 cups of flour. The amount that it calls for leaves the dough so sticky you cannot work with it. The dough was still sticky with what I put in, but it didn't stick to everything that it touched. I also suggest using brown sugar, and not white to compliment the sweet potato flavor. I will be creating my own recipe from this. It is a good idea, but with the ingredients as is, it isn't a successful recipe.

I added more sweet potatoes along with cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, vanilla extract, allspice. I used 1 1/2 cup of white flour and 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour and a mixture of both on the surface to knead it onto. It came out perfect. This is a new staple for my holiday cooking.

Like another poster, I used canned pumpkin puree (and pie filling) rather than sweet potato, because that's what I had in the cupboard. It worked wonderfully.

These were so delicious! I only made two adjustments. I used rapid rise yeast instead of active dry and I used homemade sweet potato purรฉe. This was my first time ever making a bread/roll.

I have made this recipe several times. My 3-1/2 year old grandson loves it. I switched out the sweet potato purรฉe for pumpkin purรฉe. I doubt if you can tell the difference. This recipe reminds me of Kings Hawaiian Bread. Yummy! It's my go to bread recipe!!!

Did not make many changes, used fresh baked sweet potatoes mashed and a little more than half a cup.  Used olive oil instead of margarine. Really nice roll exactly as expected 
Thank you for sharing  Sherie

Excellent results!  I made buns and sandwich rolls instead, but I will definitely make the rolls pictured next time.  I'm thinking this may also make a great loaf as well, so I want to try that again.

The only thing I changed to the original recipe was the order of addition.  I pureed my sweet potato (1 large was enough), then added the eggs and butter to that and mixed well.  I added the flour, one half cup at a time, and ended up using a little more than 4 cups total, including what I call "Countertop flour".  I ended up with 8 large dinner rolls and 6 hoagie rolls.

I use this recipe all the time and get rave reviews. My family requests them for every holiday. These are my boys favorite rolls. I make them for all holidays and my pulled pork recipes. The only alteration that I make is I use 1 cup of fresh sweet potatoes that I make into mash and cool down.

It was really good!!! Definitely use real mashed sweet potato, and actually I found that you didn't need much more than what was in the recipe. There was a nice sweet flavour which I liked, but might not be for everyone. Good recipe!!

I'll make it again.  They came out moist and were really quite easy to make.  I did exchange the table sugar with coconut sugar and a bit of maple syrup to make it a little lower on the glycemic index.  Next time I'll use a bit more sweet potato to give it a richer flavor.

This is getting added to my permanent recipe collection!    The rolls had a great texture and the sweet potato gave them a beautiful color.  One thing about this recipe confused me: the ingredient list says one half cup sweet potato, but multiple reviewers referenced one-and-a-half cups of sweet potato.  Based on the reviews, I used almost one-and-a-half cups of baked, pureed sweet potato (I didn't use canned), and it worked wonderfully.  I also needed to add more flour than the recipe called for, and I still needed to grease my hands when working with the balls of dough.  Maybe if I hadn't increased the sweet potato, the amount of flour in the recipe would have been enough, but I'll continue to use the larger amount of sweet potato in the future because I love the color and the nutrition boost.  It doesn't add significant flavor to the rolls.  I'd like to experiment with adding spices to bring out the sweet potato flavor, and I'd like to try this recipe with whole wheat flour for extra nutritional value, but it's terrific as is.  I brushed the tops of the rolls with margarine right after they came out of the oven.

This recipe is awesome!!! I had a sweet potato, so I boiled and mashed that a day before, then gently warmed it before adding it to the yeast mixture. I was running low on AP flour, so I used one cup of bread flour and two cups of AP, then added just about another cup of AP  while kneading. The only other change I made was to use 2/3c SP mash. I formed the dough into 20 small balls, and wound up with perfect 2 1/2" square rolls. I may try another batch of these with brown sugar instead of white, but I don't know as that would improve upon what turned out to be a lovely looking and delicious tasting roll. I will definitely keep this recipe in my bread favorites. Thanks for sharing.

I used canned pumpkin because I couldn't find sweet potato. I agree with some of the reviews that said this could use some more sugar. Next time I'll add some brown sugar. I got 23 buns out of the recipe and will freeze the leftovers.

The vegetable smuggler strikes again!  I used 2 LARGE sweet potatoes that I cooked and mashed. I also used whole wheat flour. My children gobbled them down.  I have NEVER gotten them to eat sweet potatoes. A great way to disguise a high vitamin content veggie! These rolls freeze wonderfully. I would also highly recommend the pumpkin chocolate chip cookies!  Great recipes! Thank you!!

I agree this roll is good with soups and stews, but it really does need more flavor to stand alone. I read some reviews and increased the sweet potatoes but my husband and I could barely note it. I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was very good when we drenched it in gravy. I will make this again because I do like the texture and it goes great with soup, but will alter it a bit to suit my palate better.

These came out really good! my boyfriend is a picky eater and he enjoyed them as well. I followed the directions almost exactly. The only changes I made was add about 2 tbs of brown sugar to the mix and I also sprinkled the tops of the biscuits with butter and brown sugar before baking. I will defiantly make these again.

I made a double batch and froze half. Really glad I did. Made the mistake of making the day before and setting in fridge as formed rolls. They rose right out of the pan! Had to bake a little longer since they were so big. These were lightly sweet and very soft.

I tried this recipe a lots of times, the result is fabulous wonderful sweet bread, but make sure to let it rest enough time to rise, the only thing i do sometime is add 1 TBS of sugar as I like it sweet, and recently I substitute the regular sweet potato with purple sweet potato, and yes it does work perfect and my kids were so happy and excited to see a natural colored bread ! Defiantly a keeper .

I used slightly more fresh sweet potato, a heaping 1/2 cup I'd say. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. These were great!  Oh, I also added cinnamon and cloves and possibly ginger, 1/4 tsp each.  They were delicious smelling and tasty! I think the spices bring out the flavor of the sweet potato. Thanks for the recipe!

Just made these for the first time today.  Recipe is super easy and the rolls came out very fluffy.  BUT, not a huge amount of sweet potato flavor even though I used fresh sweet potatoes.  I think next time I'll add about a 1/4 cup more and see what that gives me for flavor.

these were good. but better the second time after freezing and reheating. i also probably needed to add a little more water because my rolls were pretty lumpy. i would definitely make them again to perfect my technique.

The consitency of the rolls were good, and they looked nice. However, there wasn't much flavor to these rolls. After making them as the recipe called, I wished I had taken heed to some of the reviews and made alterations to the recipe. I definitely didn't taste the sweet potato, but overall the recipe is just OK to me.

Made these because I had leftover fresh yams from thanksgiving. I didn't have a problem with the sticky dough; I thought it was so easy to work with but the results were bland and a bit dense. The extra star is for the beautiful color! Since I love how the color turned, I might use my favorite cinnamon roll and incorporate it with sweet potatoes.

These were the most beautiful and tasty rolls I've ever made.  Made dough in my bread machine and followed recipe to a T.  Will make again as they turned out great, the dough out of the bread machine was amazing, not sticky at all.  Thank you.

Tender, moist texture and slightly sweet.  I did reduce the sugar to 3 Tbsps so I can make it into a loaf for our sandwiches or as rolls for our breakfast.  Will definitely make this again!

These rolls were so good. My three kids loved them. I made them for Christmas dinner. I used a little more flour. A wonderful recipe.
