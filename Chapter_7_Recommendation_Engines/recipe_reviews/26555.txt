The combination of ingredients makes a beautiful presentation, but I found the dressing to be too sour and watery. This would be a 5-star recipe with the right dressing.

I can't help but wonder if this whole recipe is just a joke, and no one has ever actually made it before.  If it is real recipe, then in order to enjoy it, you have to be prepared to pour nothing but sweetened bacon fat over your salad.  This is honestly one of the most disgusting things that I have ever seen, and the prep time listed should include the 30 minutes needed to chisel all of the fat and grease off everything this "dressing" comes in contact with.  Too bad the lowest rating possible is only one star.  I would have given it straight zeros.  Bon appetite.

This is wonderful.  I used chicken instead of turkey and a variety of lettuce with more Romaine than others.  The Romaine stood up well to the hot dressing.  I made enough for 20 individuals and took to a luncheon meeting.  Using a "George Foreman" grill to cook the chicken breasts and bacon reduced the fat and made preparation faster and easier.  I did not put the dressing on until serving time when I reheated it in the microwave.  Everyone raved about it.

Believe it or not, my kids actually gobbled up this salad!  Even those who are not really salad eaters, enjoyed it.
