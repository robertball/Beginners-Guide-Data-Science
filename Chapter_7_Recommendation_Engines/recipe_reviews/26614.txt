I was reading about this recipe the other day. It originates from Columbus, Ohio - where I live - so I thought I'd give it a whirl. Well, all I can say is that it was WAY better than I thought it would be. I made this recipe for 2, but I used the whole can of tomato soup plus a good glug of V8 veggie juice, or it would have been way too dry. I also used much more cheese. This was very good - a kind of 'poor man's lasagna.' I will make this again for sure. Thank you very much!

Made this last night for a quick and easy meal.  I didn't add the celery because I didn't have any.  I did add a pepper/onion frozen stir fry to the ground beef.  I also seasoned the beef with my favorite seasonings, onion and garlic powder, adobo, oregano, salt and pepper.  The family enjoyed it.  And even though I thought it was a glorified version of hamburger helper, I enjoyed it also.  Will make again.

Ridiculously good for a casserole. I'm not a big casserole fan at all, but this knocked my socks off. I omitted the meat and used some crumbled veggie burger patties instead, and added peas, cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper. It was fabulous. I also used some sliced American cheese on top- AMAZING! The casserole was creamy and flavorful and filling.

This recipe was a big hit at our covered dish dinners at church.   The first time I made according to the recipe.  After that I changed just a few things.  I used about 12 oz noodles, doubled the cheese and added a cup of milk to the meat-soup mix. I also waited to put the top layer of cheese on until the last 10 minutes of baking.  Thanks!

I really enjoy this simple to make, easy to reheat meal.  I've used cream of celery or chicken in lieu of mushroom and it tastes great.

Good recipe.  Not as flavorful as I expected, but still very good.  I also froze some and it does freeze well.

This was very good. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef. Quick to make and the whole family ate it up.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  Even my boys who will eat ANYTHING passed on this.  Reminded me of a store bought casserole.

We love this recipe!  It's a cheesy, noodle and ground beef.  It's easy to make.  I love it right out of the oven.  I usually put a few thin slices of Velveeta over the top.

Comfort food :)  I made this when my Mom stayed at our house for a few days, and she loved it. She asked for the recipe and said she'll definitely make it too. (I just left out the mushrooms :P )

Very good! All that needs adjusting is a little more flavor (salt, pepper, and garlic powder), and a little more moisture (milk). Thanks for sharing! :)

I'm pretty new to cooking from recipes, but this is one that I keep coming back to.  It's very easy to make and tastes amazing.  I've made it a few times - with ground beef, and also with lean ground turkey.  The turkey helps to make the meal healthier and tastes just as good.  I think this will be one of my go-to meals for a long time to come.

I have to put a healthy twist on everything I make, so I substituted with ground Tukery, No yolk egg noodles and low fat/low sodium cream of mushroom soup. Phenomenal recipe with some fresh baked rolls and a small side salad!!! I will definetly cook this one again!

My family enjoyed this very much.  I cut the recipe in 1/2.  I only put 1/4 tomatoe soup in because were are not much on tomatoes.  Also added fresh squash and used fresh mushrooms.

This recipe is close to the way they made it in the 60's at my high school cafeteria in Indiana. I always preferred noodles to macaroni. We learned to make it in our cooking class when I was a sophomore. Thanks for re-aquainting me with this nostalgic favorite.

This is a pretty good dish. I prefer to make it wothout the meat and use as a side dish. Kids hardly notice the vegetables!

I thought this recipe was a bit bland, but my roommates loved it and clamored for me. The best part for me was that I had all ingredients on hand and it was easy to prepare.

Outstanding.  Easy to make and great comfort food.  I followed some of the suggestions of others and added about a cup of milk, 12 oz of noodles & doubled the cheese.  I also added extra garlic as we love it.  I didn't have any celery so I omitted that and it turned out great.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

This turned out pretty good.  Albeit it's kinda a glorified hamburger helper.  I made a couple of changes.  I only used 1 lb of hamburger.  I don't like a ton of meat in anything.  I think this made it saucier as well.  I also only used sharp cheddar cheese.  No mozzarella.  We made this years ago and it didn't have mozz in it.  But I lost that recipe so thought I would try this one.  I think I might add a dash of red pepper next time for a little more kick!

This was a bit to plain for my taste.  My husband who is more basic when it comes to food even said it was a bit bland.  If you have finicky kids it might be a good thing.

This casserole was tasty, but a bit dry--suggest adding about 2/4 c. water. Also, the dish should be covered during baking to keep the top layer of noodles from becoming crunchy.

Wow, I'm disappointed.  Given the reviews and most of the ingredients I thought this would be a slam-dunk kid-friendly weekday dinner.  My 5-year-old son, who inhales any meat, starch, & cheese combo took one bite and refused to eat anything more.  I understood as soon as I tried my first bite.  Something was very strange and unpleasant about the flavor.  We threw it all out and are thinking Chef Boyardee is a significant improvement tonight! :(

This is a keeper. I did skip the green peppers because I forgot to buy them but next time I'll add them, and I also added a "glug" of V8 (which someone else had suggested) and this was awesome. Thanks for sharing.

At our schools in Ohio, this was a staple. I never realized how many people loved this dish until people started reminiscing on facebook about how much they love it. For me, it is like a taste of home. This particular recipe is very close to what I remember, except our school used spaghetti. I always thought they probably just recycled unused spaghetti and slapped american cheese on top, but this recipe is proof that what made it so good was that it wasn't just recycled leftovers.

Love being able to have this again! Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

I have to agree with some other posts: good & easy, but lacking true flavor. I HIGHLY suggest adding a good amount of pepper, salt, & oregano in order to improve on the basic flavors. Otherwise this fits the bill for quick casserole.

This is good if you make the original recipe but as I have made it more I like to change it up.  I like it best when I throw in all the different veggies I have in my fridge or some canned vegetables.  I add some spices and reduce the cheese (use some feta for more flavor) and reduce the meat and use low-fat and low-sodium ingredients.  It can handle lots of diverse changes.  Great base recipe.

YUMMY!  Made this with lots of extra veggies cooked with the meat (zucchini, lots of garlic, etc) and threw in some cream cheese garlic powder and sour cream.  My children loved it and so did I!

Topped with fresh parm. cheese too!

I loved this dish! Only changes I made were I left out the celery and used fresh sauteed mushrooms rather than canned. I will absolutely make this one again! Thanks for a great/easy recipe!

easy to make, had good flavor. Added 1/4-1/2 milk to soups since other reviews said it was dry and we didn't have that problem. Think next time though will add chopped stewed tomatoes for something extra.

Great starter recipe for me.  It turned out a little dry so I used more tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and mixed the noodles and sauce before putting into the pan.  This created an awesome casserole type dish.  The family devours it every time.

I needed a quick meal last week and made it for him and he loved it. This recipe is amazing, it is easy, very tasty and filling. The only thing I will do differently next time is make more! Just to let you know, I left out the celery, I didn't think I would like it. I think when I make it again I will also put more noodles in, I hardly had enough to make my layers. I would reccomend this recipe to anyone!

My family really enjoys this easy weeknight dinner.  I often double all ingredients except the meat and make one casserole for dinner and one to put in the freezer for another night.  We are also flexible about using the ingredients we have on hand.  So sometimes we have peppers or mushrooms and sometimes not.  We like it either way.

This was great.  I made I exactly as written. I heavily salted and peppered the meat mixture and I thought it was far from bland.  Super delicious.  A winner.
