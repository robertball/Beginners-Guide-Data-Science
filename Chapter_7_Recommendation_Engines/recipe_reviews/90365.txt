This turned out so good!!  I made the batter as directed (only adding 3 tbsp. of flour at 5600 feet), but made one giant sandwich using 8" cake rounds.  Baked at 310° for 25 minutes.  I also topped it with mini M&Ms.  It looked as good as it tasted.  I took it to a girls' night out at a friend's house, and I was everyone's best friend that night.

This is so good.  I made mine in a 13 X 9 pan and baked it for 18 min, cut them into squares and added a 1/2 cup of toffee chips.

Delicious! I made them per the instructions, except I made the cookies in 1" balls based on previous comments. I also froze the cookies prior to filling them to make them easier to handle.

These were delicious and a big hit at a party I hosted.  However, I was only about to make nine sandwiches from the dough, instead of the twelve that the recipe indicated.  I would recommend making smaller dough balls if you want to get more out of the recipe.

This was so yummy!  I made it one large sandwich using 8" cake rounds also.  I used chocolate chip ice cream and then edged it with extra chocolate & butterscotch chips.  The only thing that was hard was cuting it into pieces for serving.  When the cookie was thawed enough to cut, the ice cream was very mushy.  So I put it back in the freezer after cutting for a while.  Maybe it could be pre-cut before the long freeze time.  It was delicious and got rave reviews at the summer BBQ party!

Easy & Delicious!!  I personally use my favorite cookie mix instead of cake.  Just press together before the cookies are completely cooled.  YUM..  This is a great recipe.  You can make these a hundred different ways.  Thanks for submitting.

Yummy and fairly easy I made mine on a cookie sheet cause I think a 9x13 would have made them to thick but they turned out perfect on a cookie sheet a bit bigger then a 9x13 and then cut them to the size I wanted much easier then doing them balls I thought... My whole family loved them and I'm sure I'll be making them again soon:)

This was so good! I had about four of them when we took them out of the freezer! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! The only thing I would suggest is when the recipe says that you have to be quick when scooping the ice cream onto the cookies, you better do it FAST! Otherwise all the ice cream melts out of the cookies, and you end up redoing most of them! Other than that this recipe was a hit at dessert!

Wow, these are absolutely delicious! I cannot wait for another chance to make these. However, I did not work quickly enough with the ice cream, and I had some issues keeping the sandwiches together before they had a chance to freeze. Next time I plan to freeze a cookie sheet ahead of time so they have a little more help staying cool!

This is a great and easy recipe to make! I made it for my birthday "cake" and my 2 year old, who only got 1/2 wanted more! Heck when I tasted the batter that was enough for me to love it!

Crazy delicious.  The chocolate is my favorite, but I also made them using yellow cake mix and chocolate chips for variety.  I feel like this recipe has endless possibilities!  I made them a bit smaller just because I'm trying to watch portion sizes, but it made them even more snackable.  Dangerous things.

These were delicious!  I didn't have cake mix on hand, so I mixed up only the dry ingredients in my favorite chocolate cake recipe, and it worked like a charm.

These were delicious and actually quite simple.  Just make sure your ice cream isn't too soupy while you're forming the sandwiches or you'll have a mess on your hands.  I've made these twice now and had great reviews both times.  I'll definitely make them again.  Thanks!

Oh my goodnesss! These sweet treats were so easy and delicious! I am NEVER buying ice cream sandwiches ever again...However I did have some trouble with my ice cream. It  is very true that you need to work fast because the ice cream melts quickly. I also found that it is important to level the ice cream so the top cookie doesn't fall off. I put the individual sandwiches on paper plates so there would be easy clean up.

These were really good and really easy but only made 8 sandwiches with this recipe, not 12. They did not flatten very much so after I pulled them out of the oven, I flattened them a bit since they were still soft. The next batch I flattened before cooking.

Very rich and delicious. I found that the 2inch size is much too big, a 1 inch size is much better. I used chocolate chip ice cream. These are perfect for a summer picnic. Everyone who tasted them really enjoyed them.

Yummy, but I don't know about easy. I'd recommend not serving this to most kids under 12. Made for a birthday party, I think it was too big or hard for some to handle. I made a huge cookie and precut it like someone suggested; that was tough before it was frozen! and a lil messy.

So easy and cool. My son loved these instead of a cake for his 10th birthday.  I rolled the edges in sprinkles and m & m's. Yummy.  A real keeper.

A quick hint that I use when I make homemade ice cream sandwiches - I form the icecream layer with my hamburger press (lined with plastic wrap for easy removal) onto waxed paper lined cookie sheets then put them back into the freezer to freeze solid.  Once the cookies are ready to fill, it is quick and easy to fill them and return them to the freezer before melting occurs  :)

Making the cookies was really easy but the actual construction got a bit sloppy. Ice cream must be the perfect "softness," preferably not "melty." My boyfriend liked them so much he asked me to marry him.

1.  Another time, I'd use just chocolate chips.  The butterscotch chips were unattractive and did not add much to the flavor.  2.  I made 1-1/2" balls and got only 10 sandwiches.  This is consistent w/other reviews.  3.  Each of these desserts is well over 500 calories, and they are pretty small.  For the calories, I'm not sure they are good enough.  But if you don't care about that, they are quite tasty.  Just don't let your kids have more than one.  4.  I usually bake on Silpat, but because I was making a double batch, I also used a greased cookie sheet.  The greased cookie sheet worked much better.  The cookies were hard to remove from the Silpat.

This recipe was so simple, all ingredients readily available, and fun.  A fun way to have the kids help.  Used the advice of other reviewers and rolled the dough onto a cookie sheet and cut into circles using the rim of a small glass.  Perfect little sandwiches.  Would definitely make again and would  try using different cake mixes/ice cream.

These are way better than store brought, that's for sure.  It's a little hard to get the correct amount of ice cream  in for the first try though, but I think I got it now.  I'll certainly make these again, I'm surprised at how easy they are.

Thanks

These are just wonderful!  I omitted the butterscotch chips, since I didn't have them in the house.  I used black cherry vanilla swirl frozen yogurt, but only needed about 1/2 of a 1 1/2 quart.  My sandwiches aren't as tall as some, I guess.  I just used the "soften" feature on my microwave which made the fro yo the perfect consistency (it was 20 seconds).

I read the reviews, and then decided to just press the dough into a large square on a parchment-covered jellyroll pan.  I used another sheet of parchment over the top of it to do the shaping, so the dough didn't stick to my fingers.  I cooked it 11 minutes, and after a few minutes of cooling, just cut the giant square into 20 (more or less) equal pieces.  It worked really well.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Made modifications based on ease and preferred flavors:  subbed peanut butter chips for the butterscotch, put batter in (2) 9" cake pans and baked, after cooling, removed one layer from pan, keep bottom layer in pan, spread softened vanilla frozen yogurt on, topped with other cake layer, covered all with foil and returned to freezer. To serve, removed from freezer 10 mins prior to cutting into serving pieces. Can serve with a dolop of whipped cream and drizzle with hot fudge if you wish. As mentioned, this great recipe can go many different ways with cake and ice cream flavors, as well as chips used.

sooo good and easy! i skipped the butterscotch chips and used mint chip/cookies and cream ice creams. i was worried the cookie dough would run a lot given the amount of butter, but it actually didn't. I put leftover dough in the fridge overnight and it was still delicious the next day. everyone loved these. i scooped the ice cream not in a ball but in thin sheets with the spoon. i think if i tried to flatten a scoop with the cookie it would have bent or broken.

I'm really conflicted how to rate these. They tasted amazing beyond and were gone in seconds. 
But the recipe...kinda flopped. 
The cookies flattened and merged together-I ended up with a cookie the size of my pan! I cut them all up and managed to salvage it somewhat but it didn't look too pretty. 
It may have been my fault though (ok, it probably was)-I greased my hands so I'd have an easier time rolling them out. 
I guess I'll give them a four-my family's kind of insisting; they loved them!

Wow.  All I can say is wow.  If I had no self control, these could easily become part of my daily diet.  The only thing I changed was to leave out the butterscotch chips...personal taste.  They are easy to make as long as you move fast with the ice cream.  And they turn out huge making them into 2" balls as the recipe states.  Next time I will try making them a bit smaller.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because, once frozen, they were a little hard for my kids to bite into.  I had to cut my 5 year old's into bite size pieces.  Personally, I thought they were perfect!  Thank you for such a great recipe!!!

Wonderful! I have a  rounded measuring spoon that I used. I found that this tablespoon was perfect. I flattened the dough slightly. I didn't incorporate any extras into the vanilla ice cream, but rolled the edges of the sandwichs in a combination of toasted pecans and coconut. Others in Heath chips. Oh, my! I also froze the cookie prior to filling with the ice cream. What a treat!

The cookie turned our really well.  Since the cake mix was only 15.25 ounces or 342 grams, I added 2/3 cup quick oatmeal.  I also used a round cookie cutter and pressed the dough into the cutter to make the cookies more uniform.

Tried this this afternoon with a few minor adjustments. I softened the chocolate and butterscotch chips, mixing them together before mixing them into the batter. Also, I used maybe 3/4 tsp of vanilla and added approx. 1/4 tsp of almond extract due to personal preference. I used a med. sized melon baller/dough scoop which was approx. an 1.5” across. I dropped them onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and flattened them out a bit with the back of a flat measuring cup. I could fit 8-10 on one sheet. This was a very good size, serving-wise and it made 18 ice cream sandwiches. Baked at 350 for 8 minutes (4 min. & rotate top/bottom racks). Also, I discovered an amazingly easy way to manage the ice cream. If you have the pampered chef cylindrical tool for measuring things like peanut butter & honey, this tool works perfectly for adding the ice cream to this size of cookie! I filled the tube with ice cream and pressed it down inside firmly. Then, simply push up the base and the ice cream is pushed up out of the top. I pushed it up maybe a a third - a half-inch and sliced it off right onto the cookie. Perfect size circle! Repeat for all bases and place top layer on firmly. Freeze for at least 3 hours before serving. . A simple but delicious treat for a hot summer day!

These were AWESOME!  I read all the reviews first, so took advantage of some of other member's comments.  I got an ice cream maker this week and wanted to test it out.   I used a chocolate ice cream recipe from this website submitted by Wendy (thank you Wendy).  I got my ice cream maker busy and then put together the cake mix.  I followed the recipe to a T.  When it came time to bake, I used a regular baking sheet lined with foil (another member said it was hard to remove hers from Silpat) and lightly greased.  I wanted my cookies fairly thin 3/8 inch thick and smaller, about 3 inches diameter  when done and cooled, so I used a regular cookie scoop, filled it halfway and then onto the foil.  I then patted it into a little round circle with just a couple of pats.  I made them fairly thin, about ¼ inch.  Then baked for 6 minutes.  They came out perfect!  Cooled completely and by that time my ice cream was ready.  When you make it yourself, it comes out of the machine soft serve.  I just scooped and then put my sandwiches together.  Following others advice to work quickly, I put together about 4 or 5 at a time and then whisked them onto a foiled cookie sheet waiting in the freezer.  Then on to the next batch.  This method yielded about 24 completed sandwiches.  It was so fun and absolutely delicious and of course endless combinations of cake mix and ice cream.  I can hardly wait to experiment!  I took some to work today and needless to say I was voted most popular today.

My son requested ice cream sandwiches instead of a cake for his Birthday. Ok, that was a go! I just subbed Choc Chip ice cream, as that is the overwhelming family fave. As long as you let these sit in the freezer for a good couple of hours( I have nooooo patience!) they are to die for! Thank you for a new favorite!
