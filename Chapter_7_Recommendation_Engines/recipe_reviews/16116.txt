Costco had fresh figs at a reasonable price, so I bought a flat, never having prepared figs before.  I thought for sure that someone on the web would have a recipe idea for a salsa.  Came across this one, and tried it on my husband for breakfast.  I used the fresh figs, didn't have blanched or enough almonds, so I threw the almonds I had, plus some pecans into the food processor, and added generic chocolate chips.  For the orange liqueur, I defaulted to Grand Marnier, though I'll go for the Cointreau next time.  Popped them in the toaster oven, and as I'm writing this, my husband is stuffing himself two more...Brilliant idea, fast, elegant.  An outstanding selection for someone hosting a dinner party who doesn't want to leave her guests to prepare a complex dessert, but wants to serve one.

I used Marsala wine and dried figs.  Stuffing was enough to fill 26 dried figs.
It was easy enough to make a cavity in each dried fig with my index finger.
It took me about 15 minutes to stuff all of the figs.  The product was little bite-sized morsels, and I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed in the overall taste.  I bet fresh figs would be 100 times better.  I also recommend serving as soon as they are cool enough to eat.

These are a hit!  People love them.  Note: If you cannot find fresh figs, find dried ones and soak them over night.  Use the light colored figs for the best result.

Didn't care for this.  I guess I thought it would be sweeter.

The hubby and I tried it; although, I changed the semi-sweet morsels to 85% cocoa chocolate. I'm sure the semi-sweet chocolate is much better. Overall, I will make them again.
