I used dill weed instead of dill seed by mistake but it still worked. My Rib-eye's turned out excellent! This was the perfect balance of salt and spicy for me. I made more than the recipe called for and I'm glad that I did. This will work nicely with all kinds of meat and not just beef. Excellent!

Very tasty. I don't have a spice grinder but my mortar and pestle worked well. I made this as written. Thanks for sharing.
