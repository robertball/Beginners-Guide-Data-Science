I am the recipe submitter. I have moved since writing this recipe and in my new oven, the potatoes tend to be done after 30-35 mins. Enjoy!

These were tasty little potatoes. I followed the recipe as is, except I just quartered the potatoes and I also doubled the recipe. I lined my baking sheet with foil to avoid any sticking. I was roasting carrots at the same time at 425 degrees, so I just cooked these at the same time. I let them cook 35 minutes, turned the oven off, and then let them sit in the oven 5 more minutes. They were perfectly cooked. I might even triple the recipe next time, if they are good for lunch, as my red potatoes I typically buy are on the small size. ty

Update 3/14/18 Try adding fresh green beans to the mix. Toss the green beans in the sauce and set aside. Add them to the roasting pan about 10 minutes before the potatoes are done. Absolutely delicious! 08/3/16Simply delicious! My kids loved them. Thank you for the recipe.

I do not like writing bad reviews.  However, let me say what I did.  I used fresh rosemary, which I thought would infuse more flavor.  NOT.  I had marinated the potatoes for over 3 hours.  I even took the extra sauce left in then bowl after I dished out the potatoes and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I added those to the potatoes while cooking.  When we finally sat down to eat..... I could not taste anything.  For me, I still need to keep looking for a good "Oven Potato recipe."

I made these potatoes last night to accompany a rack of pork that I served to company.  I used gold potatoes because that's what I had on hand, and I followed the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe, LilSnoo!

These were good.  Next time, will add a bit more dijon mustard.  Cooking time was a little longer than expected.  Family really liked!

I made it almost exactly as written.  I left out thyme because I didn't have any, and I added a shake of minced onion.  I roasted them at 350 for 45 minutes along with split chicken breasts (chicken went in while I fixed the potatoes).  When I took the chicken out, I boosted oven temp. to 400.  I roasted vegetables and the potatoes for about 15 minutes, and both were perfect!

This  gives potatoes a nice tangy flavor. I used Dutch Gold potatoes. Will definitely make again.

This is my first time to try a recipe from this site and rate it.  These potatoes were very tasty!  I wanted something "different" and I like to add a small amount of Dijon mustard to potato salad, so thought this would be good to try.  I wanted something for the slow cooker, so I sprayed it with butter-flavored spray and cooked them (I only used 3 med. sized ones) on high about 3 hours.  One other change --- I've used a recipe with parmesean cheese before, (not freshly grated --- just the sprinkles) so I added about 2 Tbs. to the mixture before I tossed them.  I thought it added an extra layer of flavor, but we would also have liked them without it.

I doubled the recipe, and marinated the potatoes in a freezer bag in the fridge for several hours before roasting, and these came out really good! Very flavorful. Thumbs up!

Really enjoyed these potatoes. I used freshly-chopped rosemary which i think elevated the flavor a bit and baked for 35 minutes for perfectly-cooked potatoes.  It just doesn't get much easier than this, and the presentation is nice enough that I wouldn't hesitate to serve to company.  Very good and VERY tasty!

So full of yum! I used my cast iron skillet with plenty of olive oil and convect baked for nice, crispy outsides and beautiful insides. I used no salt--forgot--but they didn't need any. I mixed the sauce and potatoes and refrigerated for a couple hours before baking, just because I could. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, LilSnoo!

Overall I thought it had good flavor. I do recommend to marinate the potatoes for a few hours and add plenty of salt to taste.

These "Dijon Roasted Potatoes" were great! Mine looked great: they were flecked with mustard seeds because I used stone ground mustard. Mine smelled great: it was an awesome combination of ingredients. Mine tasted great: very flavorful and crispy. I added my salt after cooking, which I believe is the secret to crispy potatoes. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you LilSnoo for sharing your recipe.
