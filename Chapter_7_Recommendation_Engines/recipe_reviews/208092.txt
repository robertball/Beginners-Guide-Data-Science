Soo delicious! I used the whole butternut squash and roasted it on a baking sheet on broil for 5 min or so to bring out the flavor after cubing it. I also have lemon thyme plants in my yard so I used that instead of regular thyme otherwise I followed the recipe in order with the same sesonings. Perfect for the first snow in the mountains. Thank you.

So delicious! I used an entire 5 lb butternut squash, tripled the fresh thyme and garlic, and added a leek, but kept the stock at 4 cups. While I was pureeing i added about a cup of whole milk. Upon tasting I added some garlic salt. This soup is so good. It thickens a bit while it cools. Thank you for this one!

The only change I made to this recipe was to oven roast a whole squash instead of a half. I cut it in half, and cooked it at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes with a tablespoon of butter in the middle and seasoned with salt and pepper. I left everything else the same. This was honestly the best butternut squash soup I have ever tasted!!!! And I was so happy that it didn't have any cream or potatoes in it. Thank you for this recipe, my entire family loved it! Three generations of us :)

I roasted the squash with garlic and broth before making the soup.  It adds a richness the boiling can't touch.  Other than that I made as directed.  Five moms asked for the recipe.  Great and easy soup!

GREAT soup!  I took some of the reviews advice and changed a few things: Pretty much quadrupled the quantity, i added 2 peeled apples when i simmered the squash, then when i was blending it i added 2 cups heavy cream.  it was seasoned perfectly!

We really liked this recipe, but next time we will use a cup less chicken stock and more squash. Also, we might cut back on the cumin. Otherwise, very good.

an easy 5 STARS i used a whole squash  cut in half seasoned and roasted. i also added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit and about a cup of 10% cream.  I didn't have thyme but I wish i had i think that if its even possible it may have made it better. I also topped each bowl of the soup with a dollop of sour cream. Thanx for this recipe

Oh my gosh!  This was so good.  I used only 2 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of cream added before I pureed ingredients.  And I used the whole squash.

Wow, this really is delicious...I truly am surprised how good it is! I bought a halved butternut squash at the grocery store, not even knowing what to do with it when I got it home. Searched this website & thought based on the other reviews, that this recipe must be pretty good.
I too, roasted the squash, onion & garlic together. Such a great sweet taste! I did get impatient while roasting & took the squash out a little too early. It didn't puree as smooth as I would have liked.
Used slightly less stock...I had really good turkey stock that was leftover from Xmas dinner; So I didn't even bother w/ the bouillon. I did add some evaporated milk for creaminess & a touch of cream cheese just out of curiosity. Omitted the allspice, but did add a pinch of curry instead.
This is such a versatile recipe, you really can add what you like & make it your own. I definitely will make again. I'm even considering adding some butternut squash to my garden next year :)

This is an excellent recipe.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and first baked the butternut squash (cut in half, removed seeds, salted and peppered cut side, pricked skin and oiled pan and skin - placed on cookie sheet in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes - removed and let cool), and then scooped out squash and added to pan with butter, onion, garlic, thyme and chicken stock mixture for about 10 minutes.  I then added the cumin, allspice and salt and pepper.  I let this sit until the rest of the meal was ready and then warmed again and put in blender just prior to serving (I ended up straining out some of the liquid to get soup to the proper consistency.  I put a dollop of sour cream in center when serving.  This was well received!

I made this soup for my boyfriend and his parents and it was a HUGE hit! Super easy to make and sooo good! The few changes I made were the following:  roasted my squash in the oven until it got a nice golden brown caramelization color (if your squash is not the best quality or may not be the sweetest, roasting it will deepen the flavor and bring out the natural sweetness of the squash) . Didn't have allspice or chicken bouillon so I just left it out. Used my own homemade chicken stock. Added 3 small sweet potatoes (orange - not white ones) that I had hanging around. While blending it, I added a little half and half (milk would be good too - just didn't have any on hand at the time) to make it a little creamier. The end result was a better soup than the one my sister makes - which is pretty  awesome too. This is DEFINITELY a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This soup was terrific.  I used 3 small butternut squash, cut in half, roasted in oven at 450 for 45 minutes.  Scooped out squash, refrigerated until I made the soup, the next day.  The only other change I made was to add half of a diced jalepeno pepper to the onion, garlic mixture.  Perfect combination of spicy/sweet.

Tasty!  I used dry thyme and a whole (but smallish) butternut squash.  Added some chardonnay to the mix.  Yum, yum, yum!

Home run of a recipe. I followed the modifications suggested by one of the commenters to peel and cube the squash, then roast under the broiler for 10 minutes (stirring once after 5 mins). I also added about a cup of celery to the garlic and onion sautee. I used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth. Wonderful flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again soon.

I made this pretty much as written, except that I used a whole squash since it was pretty small. The only other change I made was to add a dash of ginger. I did have to simmer the squash for about 25 minutes until it was tender, though. I think the taste and the texture are perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I also roasted the potato and squash before it all went into the pot with onions and garlic.  Used veggie broth since I had no chicken broth on hand so I left out the bouillon.  Next time will use chicken broth.  Used a dash of cayenne pepper because I always spice my soup with cayenne.  Good comfort food and will keep for the regular rotation of soups.

anyone finding it a little stocky should try substituting half the amount of stock with coconut milk, which adds a creamy texture and goes well with the small red chilli that I also added, which I just can't physically cook any soup without :)

This is the first time I've ever tasted butternut squash. I added a little half n half as one of the reviewers suggested and used dried thyme instead of fresh.  It was delicious.

Perfect use of leftover frozen squash. I broiled the cubed squash them a little in the oven before cooking them.  Since I didn't have Allspice, I used cinnamon & nutmeg instead. Still turned out delicious without the thyme. Will definitely keep this recipe in our binder!

Ever since the first time I made this I've been making it again and again.  The only thing I do differently is I roast the squash ahead with the seeds, scoop it out and use it from the freezer (thawed first).  Add a dollop of yogurt and a pinch or so of Garam Masala seasoning and it's just out of this world.  I like a little sweetness to it, so I also add some sweetener to it (just for me at the table).  Oh and I also like a spice to it so "Slap Yo Mamma" spice is also great in this.

So, I've never had butternut squash soup before, let alone cooked it myself, but I had half a squash and all the rest of the ingredients on hand, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  I'm glad I did because this is a very good soup.  I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used about 1/2 tsp. dried.  With my first couple of sips I thought it was maybe too much thyme, but as I continued to eat it, I enjoyed it more and more!  I love the hints of allspice and cumin.  They aren't overpowering, but complimenting.  I would recommend using paper towels to hold the blender cover on, unless you want soup all over your dish towel.  I had a delicious lunch with this soup and a toasted sandwich!

I'm giving this four stars because this was a very quick and easy recipe.  This was my first time cooking and eating butternut squash soup and I have to say although I love butternut squash, I'm not a big fan of the soup.  Has nothing to do with the recipe, just my taste preference.  I used one whole (medium) squash and can't imagine only using half...with 4 cups of stock it had very little body even with using the entire squash.  I used 1 1/2 cups chicken stock and 3 cups beef stock because that is what I had on hand.  I also did not have allspice so I used a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon along with the cumin.  I think I would have liked a little more thyme and maybe a little more cumin, just not sure as the color and consistency of the soup may be my issue as it looks a little like baby food.  Thanks for posting such an easy recipe with easy ingredients so that I could at least spread my wings and give it a shot.

This was a straight-forward soup that was simple to make with standard pantry items.  I didn’t bother with adding the chicken bouillon because I used my home-made chicken broth which is very flavorful.  I snuck in a few tablespoons of cream just to add a little creamy richness. This soup didn’t have a lot of complexity of flavor, but was very satisfying and very good.

Very nice recipe Chester!  Simple to make and tastes very close to restaurant quality soup.  We've found that using a 4 lb. butternutt squash for the 4 cups of broth gives a nice level of thickness.

Really simple to make and yummy to eat. I was a bit leery about allspice and cumin but it was great. I took a shortcut and used cubed butternut squash from Costco - I find cutting squash to be extremely hazardous!

Just made this soup, as one review mentioned I would use more squash next time, as we all know squash vary in dryness, mine was wet so the soup was too watery. Drier squash would make a drier soup.
Flavor was great, the recipe simplistic for me that's what great cooking is all about.

Very easy and very tasty.  I cut the squash in chunks, tossed in 2 tbsp oil, salt and pepper (to taste) then roasted it for 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  I cooked the garlic and oinion in butter and oil.  I added the squash and stock and brought it to a boil, reduced the heat and cooked for about 20 minutes.  I did not use the bouillon.  I used an immersion blender to puree the soup.

To this I added a dash of curry powder, a dash of cumin, a dash of cayenne, salt and pepper. Also, added a little garlic to the boiling veggies. Topped with a dollop of fat-free sour cream and this was delicious!!!  lol, ok, the kids were not thrilled with this but ate it (especially the youngest noticed I put a vegetable or two too many, lol) but the husband was literally licking his bowl and moaning in pleasure with every bite.  I think over all, this deserves a major thumbs up!

So good!  I was looking for a lowfat version of butternut squash soup, and even when I doubled the butter to 3 tbsp, it still worked out to 3g of fat per cup.  I used an entire 5lb squash as I wanted a thicker soup, and upped the seasoning to 3/4 tsp of the allspice and cumin, as well as a dash of nutmeg.  I served with some lowfat sour cream on top.  Even my pickypants fiance loved it!

This soup was awesome! I did not have any Thyme, I used an entire squash (which I roasted first to bring out flavor and ease of peeling), added an apple and 1 can of evaporated milk. It got rave reviews from my guest - thanks for the recipe!

Really very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly but added a few changes like others suggested... I added 1/2 c half and half before pureeing and i topped it off with bacon and a touch of sour cream. I couldn't believe I made it! Flavorful and easy for the new soup makers such as myself. Definitely a keeper and worth trying...

Oh my goodness! This soup was amazing! I will definitely be making this again! This was my first try at making a butternut soup, and I don't know if I'm going to make it past this recipe to try others. I followed the recipe as is, with the exception that I added only about half the chicken stock. Seemed like it would be too thin if I added the full amount. That, and I added way more than a pinch of cumin and allspice, since I absolutely love those spices. Delicious!

I added a can of cannellini or white beans during the blending process and I used my Immersion blender plus extra thyme. White beans add a richness and protein without adding fat.  I skipped the bouillon too and used low sodium broth

Four cups of liquid would be too much for half  butternut squash.  I used a large squash and used the four cups and still felt the soup was too thin.  Simmered a little longer to obtain desired consistency.  Added a  little curry powder as per other reviewer and it was perfect.

This soup is delicious! I prefer my soup a little more thicker and creamier so I made a few changes. I added the whole squash, 1 apple and approx. 2/3 cup of cream.

Had some frozen butternut squash, so decided to try this. It turned out well, a very flavorful soup I will be eating for lunch this week.   Please heed the warning about not filling the blender too full.  I did and had a mess on my hands, and my shirt, and my pants.....

OMG! I've never even eaten butternut squash and decided to try this with 1/2 a squash and the other half roasted with potatoes as a side for dinner....AMAZING! I kind of winged it a bit as far as proportions and wish I made more. I added a bay leaf while I simmered the final product and a dash of cayenne and the sweet and spicy was perfect for us. Thank you so much for turning me on to this flavorful squash:)

My man and I loved this soup! We're on a diet and this was a nice variety to add! We used half an onion, a whole butternut squash from Whole Foods, 4 cups of chicken broth (it was on sale), and the spices I added instead were: vegetable bouillion cube (instead of chicken), hot madras curry, cumin, salt and pepper, cinnamon, vanilla soymilk and some brown sugar. I like a mixture of sweet and savory flavors in my butternut squash soup and it turned out great! Will use 3 and a half cups of chicken broth next time, though. :)

Doubled the recipe. This soup is thin. Not thick, which is fine for me but if you are expecting a rich thick soup keep looking for  another  version.  I chose this for the low calorie count. It's very tasty. Not too sweet which is great!!  I made this to pop individual servings into freezer for fast lunches.

I made this and originally did not use the cumin. I did end up adding it and I don't care for it. I thought it was pretty good before the cumin (which I love) I just don't think it should have been added. My husband thought it was really good and even the daughter liked it.

Tried this soup. . .and it is a definite Winner! However I put my own lil spin on it. I used some Canadian back bacon, chopped it into small pieces, and cooked the onion, garlic, (I added a shallot) , and curry powder in the pan. . .once that was done I followed the recipe pretty much as it was, However, I added some green herbs to the soup as well as subs. the allspice with nutmeg. :-) Try it, ya won't be sorry!

This really is the best butternut squash soup EVER.
I never have thyme on hand, so I switched it out for a jalapeno, which I sauteed with the onions and garlic. I also doubled everything except the stock, which produced a great, thick consistency.

I just made this soup for thanksgiving and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! The only change i made was that i roasted the squash first and then added it to the pot.

As written I felt the soup was missing something, but with some tender loving care I was able to bring it up to par...that was weeks ago already, however, so I can't remember what I did to "fix" it!  It was definitely improved the following day, and I froze a small portion to use as a base for risotto in the future.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! My squash was roasted and I used a bit if curry powder as I don't like cumin or allspice...both hubby and I LOVED it. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

Delish! Sauteed celery and carrots with the onions, then added some canned chickpeas after partially pureeing to leave some chunks. Drizzle with some olive oil to serve. The textures keep it from looking like baby food. :)

Wonderful warming soup! And simple to make, I always save the broth when I boil chicken, turkey, etc. I cool it and remove the fat from the top and freeze in baggies. I used the broth from boiled chicken in the recipe, also I found that fresh Thyme can be frozen in the store package and is easily removed from the stem, again wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Wow...this was the first time I'd made a Squash Soup.  I used a full butternut squash, left out the cumin and allspice (as I didnt have any) and it turned out great : )  Cant wait to take this to work for a warm lunch...uummm

Absolutely delicious.  Been trying to find foods that are healthy and that the kids will eat.  Tried this exactly as written and the whole family devoured it.  My husband insisted there was heavy cream in it... which makes me think it doesn't need it.  Will make again and again!

This is a good base soup. You just need to add ingredients to your liking. I put more cumin, allspice, and garlic and added Italian Seasoning, apples, 1/2 & 1/2 and a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it. A very good soup, though. Thanks for the recipe!

Way too much butter.  I think next time I'll just saute in a little olive oil.  Other than that - delicious and easy.

Fabulous!  I roasted my squash in the oven (drizzled with EVOO and threw on some extra garlic cloves) first.  I also added some red pepper flakes to give it some heat when adding in the cumin.  I had to use dried thyme since I didn't have any fresh sprigs but it worked out just fine.  If the soup isn't quite thick enough, you can add a bit of cream to thicken it up.  A keeper for sure!!!

This was my first time ever eating butternut squash. I followed the recipe for the most part, although I did add allspice or chicken bouillon(didn't have any) It was fantastic! I really like that its a dairy free version too! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Very easy, flavorful and healthy soup! I roasted the squash before adding it to the pot. Used dried Thyme instead of fresh and omitted the bouillon cube. I'm enjoying a cup of this wonderful soup as I write this! I will definitely make this again.

This soup was very tasty,very tasty. I found pre-peeled, pre-cubed butternut squash at Costco that made preparation super easy; it was in the cold room where you find lettuce and sugar snap peas.

I had frozen butternut squash from the garden last year.....about 4 cups.   I like a bit more garlic so I added more.  I also used Better than Bouillon dissolved in 4 cups of water for the broth.  I loved the fresh thyme and the rest of the ingredients.  I will definitely make it again.  So quick, simple and delicious!  Topped with French's crispy onions and crispy bacon!

I followed the suggestion of another user and added 1 small apple to the recipe, I will absolutely make this again! I'm a spice lover, so I was a bit more generious with the allspice and cumin, and used 3 garlic cloves. DELICIOUS!

This truly is THEE best Butternut Squash Soup ever!  I read the reviews and took the advice of several reviewers - I used a whole squash (although on the small side), roasted the squash w/a little butter in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes before adding to the sautéed onion, garlic & thyme, used a little less than 4 cups chicken stock, added a little cream after pureeing the soup, and it was so delicious!  Only complaint, this one recipe didn't make enough for leftovers!  It only served up 4 small bowls, so next time I would double or triple it1

Only change is that I use a full squash.  I roast it ahead of time in large pieces and it makes it easy to scoop out of the skin   I will also use dried thyme if I don't have fresh herbs   Use my immersion blender to make it smoothe   This is a delicious soup. Anyone I've made it for loves it.  Also it has all healthy ingredients save for a small amount of butter.

So good and great suggestions from others. My only suggestion...sprinkle on some pepitas (dried pumpkin seeds) right before serving. Looks great and the slight crush in fun.

I did not have any bouillon to add, but it was delicious without it. I roasted the squash first. I loved that it was thick, flavorful and rich tasting without the addition of cream.

Yes, probably the best butternut squash recipe I've made. I followed the recipe pretty closely, and it was delicious--so rich and buttery. Using a towel on top of the blender is absolutely mandatory, though--I learned that once the hard way. :)

Delicious change of pace meal! I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper in the broth and sweet potatoes, and then 1/4 cup of cream, and a bit more salt to the finished product. 
I may consider adding some mild Italian sausage to it to add more protein and a different flavor. Would be great with the spinach salad and warm bacon dressing ??

I added a pinch of ginger, light curry and crushed red pepper. I substituted some of the broth with veggie water saved from previous meals.  I skipped the allspice. First time I made it was without thyme. From other comments tried adding it this time and it was excellent. Serve with a whole wheat roll this winter!

We all liked it very much. 
Second day added some shrimp to it...  Think it was even better warmed up on day 2.
But I do have to add... how much is 1/2 of a butternut squash? 
I mean there are 1 pound squashes and 5 pounds squashes. A weight reference would be helpful.

Good recipe, I also cubed and roasted the squash, and I have always added a peeled, chopped up apple to any squash soup, just adds to the depth of flavore.

After reading quite a few of the reviews, I decided to make this soup exactly as the recipe is written.  I had a 3 lb. butternut squash and I did use all of it without changing any of the other ingredients.  You would never guess this soup doesn't have cream in it.  The texture was velvety (thank you, Vitamix) and the flavor was to die for!  This will be a regular in our dinner rotation!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made the recipe with cooked buttercup squash left over from dinner. It is actually a great recipe. My only complaint is that it calls for an ambiguos amount of butternut squash. Butternut squash runs in all shapes and sizes  so with 1/2 a squash I could be using 2 cup to 5 cups diced depending on the size of the squash. It would have been  a lot easier to make this recipe if chef had specified the amount needed in cups of diced squash.

Amazing soup!!!!  This is a keeper!!!  It's also easy.  The hardest part is peeling and cubing the squash, but I had half a squash already cubed in the fridge.  (Actually, the only reason I tried this was that I was trying to find a recipe to use with my leftover squash - just can't stand the thought of wasting good food). I also decided, after reading some of the reviews, to bake it rather than boil it because I love the sweeter taste of baked/roasted veggies, and that's the only change I made.  Perfect flavor and consistency - just like another reviewer said, this is a 5-star restaurant soup.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe made me love butternut squash. Baking the squash and adding the cream as others suggested added lots of flavor. I exchanged the allspice for curry powder and omitted the bouillon cube.
Will make this again and again.

This is a delicious and amazing recipe! I make this soup often, especially when butternut squash is in its best season, fall and winter. Very versatile, I have tried making the soup thicker, and added more allspice or cumin at different times, I also enjoy garnishing the soup with chives. It always comes out great. The recipe has a perfect blend of spices that compliment the soup well! My husband loves it as well as my 2 year old daughter, and she is a super picky eater.

I made this soup today not quite knowing what to expect. WOW! In my opinion it is outstanding. Great soup for a cold winter day like today. I accompanied it with whole wheat pita sliced down the middle and toasted until crispy. Did not add butter, but you certainly could to enhance the toasted flavor. A great way to get the benefits of squash in a tasty dish. Liked it so much that next time I will double the recipe.  Baking the other half of the butternut with apples and pears using another recipe from this site, as I complete this review.

Gotta give it five stars. This is my "go to" recipe for Butternut Squash Soup. I do add a bit more cumin because I just love the flavor. Fresh thyme is a must. Cream is unnecessary, but I usually add a drizzle at the end because it just tastes soooo good. The first half a dozen times I made this, I followed what others said to do and I roasted the squash. The last time I made it, I was pressed for time, so I just followed the recipe exactly - and that's what made me realize...no need to take an hour out of your day to roast the squash. I really couldn't figure out the difference.

Pretty good. Can't complain for the first time.  But I truly believe if you make it word for word you won't be disappointed.  But I do agree about roasting the squash first and it wouldn't hurt to use more than recommended.

The original recipe for this soup is a bit bland. To make thicken the soup we used less water/broth, and to make the flavour more dynamic we added finely crushed almonds; what a difference!

I made this for my family tonight and my son was giving me a hard time about not cooking the squash like I usually do with the brown sugar and marshmallows lol.  But after everyone tried it they asked for seconds.  Thank you!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was to double the recipe and add 1/4 cream. Next time I'll roast the squash instead of boiling it and I'll use 1/2 the recommended chicken stock b/c I like a thicker soup. Great starter recipe. There are endless yummy ways to tweak this recipe.

Following the advice of another cook, I roasted the butternut squash in the oven for about an hour at 400 and just poked holes in it. After it was roasted, I sliced it in half lengthwise, removed the seeds and cubed the squash.  I let it cool and refrigerated it.  The next day, I used my already cooked and cubed squash in the recipe and followed the recipe using homemade chicken stock rather than canned broth.  This recipe was just right for a nice healthy soup that is filling and tasty!!!  Thanks for sharing!  I did use the whole butternut squash as I like my soup a little thicker!

This is very good and easy to make.  I rate it 4 stars as is but tweaked it further AFTER I tasted it.  To make it 5 stars in my book, I added some ground ginger and a few more cloves of roasted garlic.

WOW!  The title doesn't lie - this soup is wonderful!  Hubby and I both had 3 bowls.  I tried one bowl with some sour cream, and it was amazing!  I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the pot at the suggestion of one of the reviews.  Hubby said he wasn't sure about the cinnamon, so he added a little more salt to his servings.  It was SO satisfying, no matter how we doctored it with each serving, or even if we didn't.  Thank you for sharing this!

LOVE IT.  I just love how fast this dish is.  I grabbed a big clamshell of pre-cut squash from CostCo yesterday, used Chicken "Better than Boullion" in my fridge, and followed the recipe pretty closely.

My tweaks were just because of what I had on had.  Added a leek, did 3 pinches of cumin.

SO YUMMY and a huge pot for around $6.  Yay for freezing leftovers!

Great dish, we made a few changes.  I roasted the squash before boiling it.  I used vegetarian broth and boullion, used the entire squash, added a pinch of cayenne, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  So good!

This was a great recipe!!  I had a leftover 1/2 large roasted butternut squash and used potatoes and carrots leftover from a roast I had cooked in the crock pot.  I read reviews and took the tip to add half the amount of chicken stalk and milk for the rest.  I boiled onion and celerly on stovetop with a bit of butter, the chicken stalk, bouillon and tyme.  Great and EASY recipe!!

This is fantastic!  I doubled the recipe but thought it was too watery so I let it boil down a bit. I also cooked the squash in the microwave like you would a potato (stabbed it 15-20 times). It was much easier than cutting a hard raw squash!  Hope you enjoy...I certainly did.

Delicious and easy to make! I bought the squash already cut, which added to the ease of the recipe.  I left out the bouillon as I didn't have any in the house.   I added 1/2 an apple when I added the butternut squash and a little half and half at the end to make it creamier.  Great soup!  I will make it again for sure.

Very good.  I used a bit less chicken stock bc I used less squash, but this is so easy and definitely worth the time.  I think I went a bit over board with the thyme, but it still tasted good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! This soup came out great.  It's a simple recipe with a lot of flavor. I added a little bit of cinnamon, and the combination of spices was perfect. I also, like other reviewers have said, roasted the butternut squash first to bring out the flavor, and stirred in some half-and-half after it was blended. The finished product was fantastic! I shared the leftover soup with some friends, and it got rave reviews :)

Excellent! This was the first time I ever made butternut squash soup, and it was simple and delicious! I skipped a few ingredients like the onion and allspice (substituting ginger and a bit of cinnamon) because I did not have them at the moment, but the soup still came out perfectly. Thanks for sharing! I will make this again.

This soup is to die for. I hade some home made chicken stock that I used in this. I also shredded a little asiago cheese on top. I am very excited to have found a recipe to use up all the butternut squash I have. And my children loved it too. Thank you Chester.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of Butternut Squash but this turned out a little bland and reminded me of baby food.

This makes a delicious soup.  I doubled the recipe and for the second serving added cream for a nice change.  I can't get allspice here, so added fennel instead.  Also, there is no need to peel the squash - a terribly fiddly process - as the skin dissolves and actually adds a nuttiness to the flavour.  We've had this a few times and it's now a favourite in our house.

This is an easy soup to make, and delicious also. I added more cumin, and garlic. I make a large batch and freeze it in quart size ziploc bags. It is easy to warm and eat with sandwiches made with wheat bread.

So delicious, low cal,and dairy free!  I didn't have fresh thyme or cumin, so I substituted dried thyme and chili power.  It really thickened out nice after about 5 minutes of sitting.  Will definitely become a staple at our house.

Good soup, but I didn't get enough of the squash taste I was looking for. I roasted an entire squash in the oven to bring out the natural sweetness. The fresh thyme really is a must, BUT (don't get mad at me people!) I think this may be the only soup I know that could use less or NO onion/garlic. Squash is so beautiful and the flavor so delicate that it might be better standing alone. But, the bf LOVED the recipe as is and says to tell everyone the garlic is delicious in here.

Always wanted to try a creamy butternut soup recipe.  This was interestingly delicious, though not what I expected.  Flavors complex and atypical.  Low fat, too.  Took the advice of other reviewers and roasted the cubed squash first. I also substituted a scant tsp. of dry thyme leaves and added a generous dash of cayenne.

This is the best butternut squash soup!  I omit chicken bouillon only because I never have it on hand. If I am feeling lazy, I substitute frozen squash. I purchased an inexpensive immersion blender to make preparation easier because I serve this often as a first course for fancy dinners or as a starter for a light lunch.

Very good. The only thing I did was throw in some mashed potatoes to thicken it up a bit. I think next time I'll use a little less broth/ little more squash. Thank you for such a EASY and delicious recipe !

AMAZING! I felt like I couldn't get it into my mouth fast enough! I used the other half of the squash to make fries, and served those together with grilled cheese. The BEST lunch I've had in a long time!

My family absolutely loved this soup, and so did I! Mostly, I did everything the same, though I did pre-steam my squash in the microwave first. Also, I added about 1 cup of heavy cream before pureeing, since I really love a creamy soup. Finally, I garnished the tops of each bowl with some cooked, crumbled bacon. Perfect!

I loved this soup for a dreary fall evening. Even my two and three year olds loved it! I did add a bit of heavy cream for an extra rich flavor, but otherwise I followed the recipe. It's super easy to make and it makes a really yummy meal!

The flavor was wonderful although I added a pinch of nutmeg too. Would like it a little thicker so, add less broth? Add a whole squash? Add a little cream? I'll play arond with this one.

So easy and had a rich taste despite having no cream, only a little butter. I used Vadilia onion. I accidentally left out the allspice and cumin, but it was delicious anyway.

Delicious and easy to make soup. I added some half & half at the end, only because it was near the expiration date and I wanted to use it up. That made the soup a little creamier, but it was not necessary. I will be making this again .

Very good, and differently flavored than the other butternut squash recipes I’ve tried. This was a very thin soup, made exactly per the recipe, but I’m not sure it was supposed to be.  I used about a lb of squash and about 4 oz of onion, with no changes to the other ingredients. I’d probably like the soup a bit thicker next time so I will try increasing the amount of squash.

This was sooo easy.  I had all the ingredients, even the bullion.  Only difference for me is I put apple sauce in it for The heck of it.   Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good! I used home canned squash and had to estimate the herbs as I don't have any fresh this time of year. Hope my guys like it as I may have to make this more often! Good cold weather soup!

This is truly a remarkable recipe.  It's very simple, but utterly delicious on a cold winter day.  I've made it two or three times and it always gets gobbled up quick.

Look at the 5-star reviews and you'll see the truth: everyone has to doctor this recipe to make it good. I made this exactly as written and it was amazingly disappointing. It absolutely needs something to make it a bit thicker, and taste is bland.

Loved this soup and my 10 year old even loved it too!  I didn't add the bouillon cube (didn't have one) but the soup didn't suffer for it.  Still delicious!  I like that it's the tiniest bit sweet but not overly so as some butternut soups are.  More savory and creamy.

Loved this soup! However, I made several modifications - 2 cups homemade (from beer butt chicken) + 2 cups coconut milk and 1 tsp ginger! Delicious soup.

Restaurant quality! I was doubling the recipe so I was sort of winging it slightly. Used about 4 cups of cubed squash, a whole onion, 6 cups of stock, added a little cinnamon and probably a half tablespoon or so of brown sugar. Then as I was pureeing each batch in my food processor, I added just a little more salt and a couple swirls of half and half. Perfect! I'll be making this recipe for years to come I'm sure.

Delicious !! Will be making again. I too roasted the squash  3lbs. Already peeled and cut on 400 degree oven for about 30 min until just cooked.  Used lemon thyme,pinch of curry, turmeric, ground ginger and allspice. Immersion blender to finish.  Will top with either plain yogurt or sour cream (low fat) and pumpkin seeds!

I made this soup but add half a cup of coconut milk to it. This made it creamy with a hint of coconut.  Very good. Might actually be 5 stars but I have the flu and my taste buds are a bit off. Bon  appetit!

Best soup ever!  Used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Only 3 cups of broth and 1/2 vegetable bullion cube. Doubled cumin and left out allspice but added a dash of cayenne.  Perfect!

As a vegetarian I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I used packaged, fresh butternut squash cubes. A large package. I didn’t use cream because I wanted to keep the fat down. The soup was still thick and creamy. Added a little cayenne. It is easy and fast to make. I sprinkled pumpkin seeds on soup when serving. Really good. I love butternut squash. My husband does not, but he was very enthusiastic about this soup. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Everyone loved it. Really easy. Used Instant Pot to cook whole butternut squash (no piercing or slicing), then peeled and cubed it and added it to broth.

VERY TASTY  I used frozen cubed squash and roasted before mixing with onion. Added cream while pureeing.  Company also enjoyed. Worth making.

I doubled the recipe otherwise made it as directed in my pressure cooker. It came out very thin. I added a second whole butternut squash two handfuls of carrots a block of cream cheese some fresh ginger and a pinch of cayenne. Pressure cooked it again. And it was delicious!

I added 3/4 Apple in w the squash like another reviewer suggested. I roasted the squash w a bit of oil similar to someone suggesting brooling. My squash was small so I used the whole one. It was a tad bit sweet. I loved it but have had butternut squash soup before. My wife was originally a skeptic but was very happy w it.  She said it tasted like a cream soup but I assured her it wasn’t. She really enjoyed the taste. Will make again.

Great recipe! The hardest part was cutting the squash...I plan on buying it pre cubed next time if I can.  Fit the bill for us, (we can't do dairy).  I did roast the squash first, and I fried bacon very crispy and served it crumbled in the individual bowls. I also plan on doubling the recipe next time, and freezing half for a quick go to dinner.

Like many others, I roasted the butternut squash in the oven first (with olive oil and salt and pepper) and then added the juice of one orange and orange zest (saw this in another recipe).  Delicious!

recipe is good, but it should advise people to roast the squash first. I also added an apple and a splash of milk and a bit of cayenne pepper.

Love this soup. Instead of boiling, I roast the squash basted with butter and seasoned with salt pepper and herbs, along with  the onion and also add a bell pepper. This adds a smokey essence to the soup. Purée the balance of ingredients with roasted veggies and broth. So yummy!!

Simple and easy to make. This is my first time to make squash soup and it turned out great. I used a local variety of squash (I'm from the Philippines) which is a bit sweeter so I balanced it out with a bit more chicken stock and extra salt. I used homemade chicken stock. I didn't have allspice so I used dashes of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It's creamy enough w/o any cream. An indulgent soup w/o the guilt :)

This isn't bad for a squash soup. That being said, I usually hate squash soup. I doubled the soup and added a can of tomatoes (puréed) and it was a great soup.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I have made it several times now and have modified it a bit to suit the tastes in our house.
I used a whole squash and substituted nutmeg for the allspice.  Also added some rosemary and it came out beautifully.  Everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it!!!

Fantastic soup, and it's perfect for the winter and fall.  The recipe doubles nicely.  The flavor of the soup can be enhanced by roasting the butternut squash with the garlic and thyme first.  This gives it a very rich flavor.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe, Chester!

Made it with half veggie and half chicken broth and added 1 Granny Smith apple. At first I was looking for a sweet flavor instead of savory, but the more I ate it grew on me. Used 3/4 of a teaspoon of dried thyme and 20 oz cut up squash.

Used two butternut squashes, an apple and a ripe pear.  Adjusted other ingredients proportionately. Before blending added two cups of low fat half n half.  Smooth and delicious without the perfume taste sometimes found in other butternut squash soup recipes. With fresh cornbread on the side, a perfect snowy day fire side meal made from my pantry and refrigerator with no need to venture beyond home.

This is the first time I've made Butternut squash and I love it! Made it pretty much by the recipe, except I used more squash, a little extra allspice and used Italian seasoning instead of thyme {cuz I didn't have it} I thought it was sweet enough without adding apples like some had said they did. I appreciate that it didn't have heavy cream in it. Next time I will try roasting the squash to see if it could actually be better.

This soup is easy to make and very good!  The only changes I made was I replaced some of the chicken stoc, (about 1/2 of it) with stock made from bouillon because I didnt have enough stock.  I also added 1/4 block of cream cheese to it when a puréed it.  That added a much richer flavor.

I love butternut squash and butternut squash soup! I roasted the squash with olive oil and garlic cloves till it was tender.  Roasting gives it such flavor; would not consider boiling the squash. Did not add bouillon cubes, did not find it necessary.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this soup in large quantity for our church's Old Fashioned Christmas.  I pretty much kept the recipe the same, but had some pumpkin and sweet potato that got added in with the butternut squash.  The spices in this are right on and it was a favorite for sure.  will definitely make again.

like many reviews suggested I roasted the squash, onions and garlic beforehand.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried. Other than that I followed the recipe. Very easy to make and it was tasty.

This turned out great! I doubled the recipe so it would feed 6, but kept chicken stock to 5 cups  for thicker soup.  I used other's changes by roasting onions and squash in the oven first.   Don't forget the towel over the blender as I lost liquid all over the cabinets!! 
Easy to make when you buy the squash already peeled and cubes.

This is a filling soup, with a hint of sweet. Easy to make. I recommend wearing gloves while chopping the squash as it left a residue that's a bit like glue. Best soup I've had in a while.

Very good. I added a splash of cream because it was a little salty in hopes that it would tame the saltiness a bit and it did. I think next time I would omit salt all together.

Seriously good soup, as in "lick the bowl clean" good! Pureed up like velvet - very worth the effort of putting it in the blender in small batches. This recipe makes me want to go buy an immersion blender so I can make this soup again & again!
Used two butternut squash and added two cups of applesauce just for fun. Doubled the allspice & cumin but left the soup stock the same.

The texture of this  soup was not  good.  It was similar to applesauce and no one in my family enjoyed it.  The taste was ok, but the texture was terrible.

I added the white of a leek and a cubed potato to thicken the soup. After blending the soup I also added light cream and a tablespoon of butter to the soup. The end product was 
awesome.

Really good!  I baked the squash in the oven as others have suggested.  I would say steaming it would work well, too.  Otherwise, by the recipe.  Great soup.  Would make it again.

SOOOOOOO yummy....plus quick and easy!!!  I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions about doubling the amount of butternut squash, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out amazing.  I'm a soup snob and I definitely recommend this soup!!!

I also added an apple to add a little  more sweetness,  Rather than 1/2 squash, I wish the recipe had given a measurable amount.  I thought my  squash was a little small, so I used the whole thing, and got a thick soup.  I used it  the next day over chicken  ravioli and it made a great sauce.

Great recipe!  I did read the reviews and decided to use a whole butternut squash and roast it first.  I scored it before basting it with melted butter, then salted and peppered it before roasting at 400 degrees for about 45 min.   After pureeing, ( with only 2 cups of chicken stock) I added milk to get creaminess to desired consistancy.   SO  GOOD!!!

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have fresh thyme sprigs though so I just added between 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. dried thyme leaves.  I noticed that some reviewers said they needed more squash.  The butternut squash I had was about 10 inches long and was more of an even shape on top and bottom.  I used half of it as given in the recipe.  I slowly simmered the soup down over a longer period than the 15 minutes given in the recipe  (around 45 minutes) so the liquid evaporated down a bit more and used a blender stick in the pot to puree.   This  soup had a wonderful consistency (not too thick and not too thin) and the flavors were perfect!  I did use salt & pepper in the soup (just lightly) after also lightly salting and peppering the cubed squash beforehand) and used the pinch of cumin and allspice (around 1/8 tsp each).  I didn't use the chicken bouillon crushed over it though.  Also, I had vegetable broth instead of chicken stock and I used the vegetable broth.  It was all perfect!   I will definitely make this one again!  It was delicious!

Oh Wow! Oh Yum!! Oh Goddess pleeeease let me remember what I did because this soup was Spectacular. You know, the kind of good that you wake up thinking "Can I have that for breakfast?"
I used a whole really big butternut plus a small varietal peeled and cubed that got roasted at 425 with a whole mess of garlic cloves for about 30 minutes. Sprinkled the squash with coriander, cumin, sage, and kissed it with a modest amount of EVOO before throwing it in the oven. 
Sauted the onion on the stove top and when it was close to giving up added some freshly chopped sage and thyme. Gave it all a heathy grating of nutmeg and then added the stock and a cinnamon stick. Threw in  the squash and garlic from the oven and let it simmer with a light tsp of vegetable demiglase ( can't bring myself to use buillion cubes ). 
Puréed as directed and served with a big scoop of yougurt, light dust of nutmeg, and a drizzle of truffle oil. 
Outrageously Tasty!! 
I am certain that this recipe made as written is Devine and I do hope that you will try it as directed or, with the little tweaks that suit your family's taste buds. Thank You Chester!! Amazing recipe.

Best butternut squash soup I've ever made!!  Roasted 3 lbs cubed squash from Costco with some butter flavored olive oil and minced garlic until the pieces were about half done.  I did add one peeled apple to the skillet as others have suggested.  Instead of the bouillion cube, I added one cube of Knorr's cilantro.  I had about 1/2 cup of whipping cream in the fridge, so I added that.  So delicious my husband and I devoured it all!!!

I did not like this recipe.  I made it with fresh thyme and used a whole squash like some other people in the reviews.  I also put some cream in it and then I blended it a little at a time (which was a real mess).  I'm basically a healthy eater and I love butternut squash, but this was very bland and I didn't like the texture either.

I used the entire butternut squash after cubing it and roasting it in the oven for about 10 minutes.  I doubled the thyme and garlic, but still used only 4 cups of chicken broth.  I tried to keep it healthy so I did not use any cream.  It was still delicious!

This is one of the best homemade soups I have ever tasted. I used a whole, large squash and I roasted it in the oven with olive oil and salt. I made 1/2 of this recipe so I basically doubled the amount of squash called.

I just made this last night.  It is very tasty and I would make it again.  I did not add the chicken bullion as I thought the broth was enough.  I also didn't have any allspice so added cinnamon, ginger and cloves.

I tried this last night and it turned out wonderfully. I did make a small mistake and added sour cream to it (I was cooking several hints at once) I thought I had ruined it! But it was lovely. We enjoyed it and it was even better today for lunch, the spices were more mellowed and a bit more flavourful. Next time I'll be sure to pay closer attention, luckily this is such a good soup that even my boo boo was ok.

What a great recipe! I used a whole squash and roasted it first. Loved it, it was a lil thick, might add a little more fluid next time. Great recipe!

Butternut squash come in many sizes, my wife ended up using the whole squash, it was a small one.  Still, though the soup was good it might have been better had we known how much squash was needed to make it according to the recipe.  Because of this, adjustments were made and in the end it was only acceptable, so a more exact measurement would be need to improve this recipe.

Never made Butternut Squash soup before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it is definitely a keeper! Just one question! Does anyone know an easy way to peel the squash? That was the hardest part of making the soup!

I roasted the butternut squash first as suggested in other reviews and used the whole squash. 
I did not add the cumin. 
It turned out perfectly and we loved it.

i think it the best recipe for butternut squash soup that I have come across. I will make this again.  I did make a couple of changes, however. I added a chopped, peeled apple, for one thing.  Also, I had no chicken broth so I used potato water that I had previously used for boiling potatoes and frozen for a future use.  Lastly, I roasted the squash in the oven until fully cooked and then chopped it before adding it to the soup.

This soup is awesome. I think I'd be more inclined to call it a bisque though. No matter what you call it we  loved it. I used a huge squash, and fresh carrots. I cut the squash in half, seasoned it with garlic salt, placed the halves cut side down in a bit of water and roasted them in a 450 degree oven for an hour. I placed the cleaned carrots in foil, seasoned them with olive oil and garlic salt, wrapped them tightly and roasted them for 30 minutes. Roasted veggies are so much more flavorful than boiled or steamed. I scooped the squash out of the shell, put the squash and carrots in a large pot along with the rest of the ingredients, then let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Puréed the mixture with my stick blender and added a bit of sour cream at the end. I think I will eliminate the cumin next time though. I will be making this again, great on a cold night yummy!

I used about 4 stalk of fresh thyme from my garden, it gave it a wonderful flavour and will certainly do it again.  I still have half the butternut squash.  Love it  loved it very much.

Love this recipe, the only change I made was using green onions since I had them handy and needed to use them. Soup came out great!!!! Will definitely make again.  Also I did roast the squash for about five minutes.

Very good and good enough for both family and company.  I made exactly as written except for no chix bouillon cube.  I used the roast the whole squash method that several suggested and I did add a few drops of Siracha. As I heat up a serving for myself in the following days I find it is getting richer and richer so I dilute with a little 1% milk.

I'm giving it four stars because I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 2 Tbsp of sherry.  My family loved it like that and gobbled it up.  This is a great basic recipe to follow with additions.

Excellent! As usual, I missed following the directions exactly. I roasted the whole squash first after cutting it in half. That actually was easier for me to do than cutting it up raw. It was a BIG squash. Also, the squash was so sweet on its own that I didn't add any sugar.

Unfortunately I had to make a change because I did not have butternut squash, but  had just been given a huge chunk of hubbard squash so I thought why not?  Oh YUM!   I noticed the recipe said soup was kind of sweet, with the Hubbard, not sweet, but still delicious.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly and would make again just like this, and will definitely try with Butternut squash too.   I would recommend trying with Hubbard squash as well if you not a sweet soup fan.  Definitely a keeper for the file!

This is the best soup I have ever made.  After reading the reviews I also baked the squash in the oven at 350.  Instead of cumin I used curry powder.  I think it depends on how big the squash is as to whether you cut the chicken broth down to 3 cups or use 4 cups.  I used 3 cups because my squash was small.  Thanks for sharing and will definitely be making this a few times.

I searched for easy soup recipes and this one popped up. I followed most of the directions plus followed other reviewers advice. I give this five stars even though I didn't have the chicken cube thing, or all spice ( I used apple pie spice yum) and I used vegetarian base not chicken. Oh and I added coconut milk. Yes, I took liberty to manipulate the basic and amazing recipe to what I had available, yet in the end; the result was quality soup which would not have been possible without the assistance of the basic recipe. Thank you!

Used roasted squash, then followed recipe included spicing. Added cream while blending. Reheated and served with a dollop of sour cream. Perfect for an early fall start to dinner. Easy to put together.

Super easy and there are ways around any issues you may have, like I had a small butternut squash and when it was done it tasted too much like a chicken soup so I cooked 2 sweet potatoes, pureed them and added to the soup...perfecto!!! Thanks for sharing :)

Loved it. So simple and cheap to make. I used frozen butternut squash.  I think will use less broth the next time I make it. I also cooked it too long so it wasn't as rich. I would love to make it more thick and creamy so if anyone has any advice for that please share.

This is GOOD soup!! I tried baking the diced squash, as others have suggested, to help create a more intense flavor. The "pinch" of cumin and allspice I measured out as 1/8 tsp. I used "Better Than Bouillon" paste rather than half a cube - slightly richer chicken  flavor. 
Using an immersion blender, it turned out with a perfect soup consistency. I like mine a little thicker, so I simmered it for about an hour more.
Such a wonderful Fall lunch! Or dinner, with a salad and homemade bread...Yum!!

I added a few celery sticks, a potato, a carrot or two, an apple/pear. Boil, then simmer until everything is good and soft. Pour off most of the liquid and blend until desired consistency. Add small amounts of the liquid you poured off as needed. It was scrumptious. One of my favorites.

I like the simplified list of ingredients compared to my go to recipe.  But I believe you MUST add caraway seed, a little to the pot while the squash is cooking (so it gets softened and blended into the soup) and then as a garnish on each serving.  I also cut down on the liquid while cooking, and then blend in half and half or heavy cream to give the soup a cream base and texture.  Yum!

Great recipe!  I love how basic these ingredients are keeping it paleo and whole food based. I actually made this in my crockpot to keep it warm.  I used the whole squash and doubled the chicken stock. I also added cinnamon and a little stevia to sweeten it. I might use some coconut milk or coconut cream next time to make it even richer!

Very tasty!  Followed suggestions and roasted cubed butternut squash with EVOO salt & pepper at 400 for 25-30 minutes or until done.  Used a whole butternut squash.  Sauteed 1 vidalia onion and 4 garlic cloves in a little bit of butter until translucent, added roasted squash and 6C homemade chicken stock.  Added 3-4 sprigs of Thyme, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8+ tsp of curry.  Let mixture come to  boil  and let cook for 10 minutes.  Added 1C half and half just before blending with the  immersion blender.  Season with salt to taste.  Served with fresh cracked pepper and  dollop of sour cream

This soup is great. The bullion in it makes it taste a little like filling for butternut squash in a store bought ravioli, which I personally find delicious. I was missing out on both the thyme and the cumin. I just didn't have them in stock at home. Still delicious.

I made this soup for my fiance and he LOVED it! I made it for my friend who hates butternut squash, and she LOVED it. The only changes I made were roasting a whole squash in the oven beforehand, rather than using half of one, and adding a half of a cup of cream cheese at the end when I used a stick blender to mix it. It made it super creamy and delicious.

Delicious, and it tastes gourmet!  I wanted a very creamy/rich soup, so I only used about 3 cups of stock, and  a half cup of cream and 1/3 cup sour cream. Also, I let the squash roast in the pot for a few minutes before adding the liquid ingredients...it helps to bring out the sweetness of the squash.

Disappointing.  This soup tasted like flavored water and that's after I added some evaporated milk.  It also needed some nut meg. Added that and the flavor was better.  Oh, and don't try putting it in the blender. When I did, it exploded everywhere. I then transferred it  back to the pot and used a hand mixer.

I didn't measure anything just eyeballed but I did use the ingredients listed with the addition of half of a cinnamon stick and a little ground fresh ginger and it was fabulous. I don't think the bouillon is necessary and I will omit next time.  Will definitely make again

Absolutely the most amazing butternut squash soup!  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and doubled all the ingredients except the chicken stock and roasted the squash and garlic for 30 minutes before simmering in the stock.  This recipe is so easy.  It was so delicious that my husband said I should make it for Thanksgiving which I did.  It was the hit of t he meal.  Everyone raved about it.  This will definitely be one of my favorite soups to make.  I think I will try making it with pumpkin next.

I just made this soup tonight and it tasted pretty good.  

I didn't make any modification to the recipe except to double up everything since I didn't want to use only half of the squash.  So, now I have weeks' worth of squash soup on hand.  I will enjoy it every day until it's gone.

I have made this a few times. First as the recipe called, second I added apple, third added pear. All were delicious. The last time i made a lazy/fast version...microwaved the squash, I put all the ingredients in the blender, subbing onion powder for onion and added pear. I then transferred to slow cooker pot & directly into the fridge over night. Cooked next day over 8 hours on low. Not bad!

Amazing recipe!  As others suggested, the only things I did differently were I roasted a whole butternut squash and doubled the recipe, and I added 1 can of drained cannellini beans (white kidney beans) to the squash and chicken stock before pureeing.  This thickens the soup up nicely instead of heavy cream or milk and adds more vitamins and fiber.

Beautiful recipe--I used the full squash instead of half, doubled the butter, used 3 cloves of garlic and a full onion.  Also added an additional 2 cups chicken broth, an apple, nutmeg, and red pepper flakes to taste!  Lovely fall soup.

I love this recipe. It's so simple, easy, and delicious. I make a few small changes that I think really elevate the basic recipe. I add about a tbsp of brown sugar to sweeten just a touch and 1 bay leaf - I also increase the cumin because I love it. This is always my go to base for butternut squash soup.

This soup was pretty tasty although not as good as the soups I have tried at restaurants.  It also took me a lot longer to make the soup than listed.  Between all the prep work, chopping, measuring, and cooking, it took more like 2 hours total.  I will definitely try it again, but maybe next time I will add milk or wine and an apple.

I added a little extra cumin to balance the allspice, I will use less next time. Also added a little bit of ground red pepper for a little bit of a tingle.

I loved this soup. I had people try it who thought they did not like squash and they came back and asked me for the recipe.I caramelized the onions in butter, it added a nice rich flavor to the soup.

This soup was every bit as good as I hoped it would be!  I made a couple of changes : Did not add allspice (none on hand), used the entire squash, used chicken broth in lieu of stock, did not use all of the liquid after cooking the squash but, added approx. 1/8-1/4 cup milk to the blender. I seved it with a dollop of sour cream & a splash of worcestershire.  Delicious!  I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow, so am looking forward to leftovers for lunch!  Next time, if my squash is the same size, I will use less chicken broth.

I've made this soup abt 10 times each winter, for 2 winters in a row! I always double the squash & add abt 1/2 cup more broth.  I always roast my squash in the oven, drizzled w extra virgen olive oil & minced garlic.  I add abt 1/2 cup of heavy cream at the end as well. It's so good, I have my mother in law leaving me cut up squash in my fridge as a hint!!  I will always use this recipe!! Thanks a bunch!!

This recipe is a good base. I doubled the amount of squash and added chili powder, cayenne pepper and Tony Chachere's seasoning. I was trying to replicate a "spicy squash soup" I had at a restaurant and I would say...mission accomplished!

This is really good and so easy!  I use vegetable broth and dried thyme.  I also purchased a package of pre-cut butternut squash from Costco.  That makes it even easier!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was incredible! My ANTI-squash teen boys devoured it and said "THIS IS GOOD MOM!" I added 1 cup of chardonnay with the chicken broth. I halved four squash and baked them in the oven face in two 9 x 13 glass dishes first, then scooped the flesh out into my delightful seasoned onions and garlic mixture sizzling in butter. I didn't have thyme so I used a little rosemary and sage. I also did not have allspice so used nutmeg. Thank you for this recipe! :)

Loved this recipe! I used about 3/4 of a whole butternut squash instead of 1/2. I added 1/2 a Granny Smith apple when I added the squash to boil. Also added whole milk when I was blending it. Very good! I served with a fresh fall salad with craisins, 1 Granny Smith apple cut up, slivered honey almonds, & feta cheese with a poppyseed dressing. It complimented the soup very well!

Very good soup! The first time I made it per the recipe with the exception of the cumin (I just don't like cumin) and it was a hit. Since then, I have been adding a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and about an eighth of a cup of diced celery to the pan while cooking the onion and it's incredibly good.

Really liked it! My tweaks were simply because I used what I had on hand... did not use a bullion cube, only used 2.5-ish cups of chicken stock, added couple of shakes of kosher salt, and simmered for 30-40 minutes. Then added the spices ( more allspice, less cumin,and a tad of ground peper and 2 shakes kosher salt) and then added 1/2 -ish cup of heavy cream. Removed from heat and used my new Cuisinart hand blender.. and voila!  Absolutely perfect!!!

I've tried several different recipes, this is by far the best! It does have the deep flavor, but not overly rich like some I've made. Like everyone else, I tweaked it a little: roasted the squash, added 1/2 apple, some cayenne for kick, and 1/2 cup sour cream at the puree stage.

Great and easy. I used Vietnamese vegetarian soup base instead of chicken broth.  Also used Bestlife olive oil spread instead of butter.  Worked great.  For mine twist adding salt and fresh pepper brought out the flavor nicely.

Really good - love that you don't have to use any cream if you don't want to.  I put a dollop of sour cream in.  I think 4 cups is too much broth.  I used about a whole squash - half was already roasted, the other half was cubed.  And with 4 cups, it was not quite as thick as I would have liked, but still good.  I also added some sauteed turkey sausage and green onions.

This recipe is very good, but I combined it with Emeril's recipe'....fantastic! Try saute'ing the veggies until lightly browned; substitue the allspice with nutmeg and just a pinch or two of ginger  (hold back a bit on the nutmeg) and as one person also suggested, add some cream. For a kick add Jalepino's if you like warm to hot.

I made this soup and my husband loved it! He requests it every winter when butternut squash is in season. And I love it too. I sub in 4 strips of turkey bacon to reduce the fat. The topping of sour cream with bis of bacon really enhances the soup!

I made this with a couple modifications - I roasted the squash for 15 minutes and increased the amount of squash. The soup tasted like squash, but even with a pinch of cumin it was a little too savory. Might be improved with a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg.

This isn't exactly "the best" butternut squash soup I've ever had, but non-the-less, it is a good soup, along with some modifications. The soup definitely needed some tweaking to make it more flavorable. First, I saute'd 4 tablespoons of diced onion along with a pinch of dried thyme leaves, in the 1-1/2 tablespoons of melted butter for about 2 minutes over medium heat, then I added the 2 cloves of garlic (minced), and saute'd that for about 30 seconds. I then added 3 cups of the broth, 1/2 teaspoon of bouillon granules, 3 pinches of ground allspice, 3 pinches of ground cumin, 2 pinches of black pepper, plus 4 cups of the squash (which I cut into 1/2-inch cubes). I did not add any salt, as this soup does not need it!! I then brought the soup ingredients to a boil, then lowered the heat to a simmer, and cooked it for exactly 23 minutes. (The squash was tender by then.) I then stirred in the last cup of broth, which helped to cool down the soup a bit. I poured a third of the soup into a blender, and just pressed the "blend" button to puree' the soup. I added the puree'd soup into another pan, and heated it on low, and finished puree'ing the soup in batches, until all the soup was smooth, then adding it to the already puree'd soup in the pan to finish heating the soup through. I read  the reviews posted, and don't know why others stated this soup was abit runny. I found it to be slightly thick. It had the texture of a "bisque" soup. With modifications made, this soup was good!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I just used the entire squash and it was wonderful!!  I didn't have any thyme or allspice so didn't use these.  This taste like a soup from a 5 star restaurant!!!!  Making another batch this weekend.  Thank you for the recipe!!

The way I made it was love!  3lbs butternut squash (about 1.5c= 2 squashes), 2.5c chicken broth, .5c whipping cream, about .75tsp curry powder instead of thyme, cumin and allspice.  I know it isn't the same recipe, but this gave me the inspiration.

Very, very good.  I added fresh sage and rosemary as well as thyme, and added carrots and celery to the aromatics.

Wonderful!  Didn't change a thing -- didn't have to.  The kids aren't used to not having to chew their soup, so I browned panko breadcrmbs with bacon bits as a topper

Great recipe. I had an extra turnip and threw that in. The turnip really added a nice kick to the flavor especially since I made it without butter or chicken boullon.

I've gotten rave reviews on this soup -- I double the spices (using the equivalent of 1 cube of boullion - chicken or vegetable) 1/2 tsp group cumin and 1/2 tsp ground allspice.  It is also good made with beef broth - somewhat darker flavor.  The fresh thyme is a must !  But aside from preparing the squash (which takes a LONG time) this is a quick, easy, and wonderful-tasting soup.

very good and easy to make. I only use half the water and add a can of coconut milk to make it creamy.  A little cinnamon too.

Not a huge fan of butternut squash soup, but this is a pretty good recipe.  If I ever make it again, I will use this recipe.  So easy and has good flavor.

Even without using all of the broth, there was too much liquid.  The flavor wasn't bad, and the low calories are nice, but I wouldn't bother making it again.

I loved the texture of this soup but the flavor was a little boring. Maybe my pinches of cumin and allspice were too small. I did add a little nutmeg after my first few bites which helped a little. I'll try it again but add more thyme, cumin, garlic, and allspice and maybe nutmeg.

Everyone loved this soup - and this from a family that does not like butternut squash.  I did omit the allspice ( not a fan) but added a shot of sherry and about a cup of heavy cream.  Fabulous!!! Will make time and time again.

Excellent recipe, easy and delicious. Also works well with a handful of fresh sage tossed in during the puree process instead of using thyme.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and then I had maybe a cup left and took it to work to show off my culinary skills and they went crazy over it.  I'll have to say that while cooking it I was skeptical and then once it was pureed it all came together.  I did add the cream at the end as suggested by someone else.  Great!! Thanks for the recipe.

I loved it just the way it said... I added more thyme, but it didn't need it.  Perfect for getting into the fall spirit.  Hubby even liked it!  Warning to the beginner, be prepared that the squash is tough to cut... but way worth it!

Loved this recipe - made it exactly as written but doubled it.  I used a little less stock and added more as I pureed it if needed.  I will definitely make this again.  Easy, delicious and healthy.  Thanks!
