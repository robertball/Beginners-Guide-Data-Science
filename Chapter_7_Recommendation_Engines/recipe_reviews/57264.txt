SO EASY, TENDER and great flavor. A new family favorite.  I followed recipe but instead of sliced onions, I added one packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix instead. NOTE: I had a 7 1/2 lb brisket, so I cut in half and put each half in a separate aluminum pan (for easy cleanup), then I mixed 2 separate batches. The first I cooked in the oven as stated, the other in a slow cooker. The oven MAKES all the difference!! The oven-cooked brisket flaked easily and absorbed all the flavor>>YUM, the slow cooker brisket had great flavor, but texture-wise was that tough-hard-to chew texture..we will stick with the oven as the recipe states..A KEEPER! Thanks! I served w/mashed potatoes, gravy & peas. Everyone from 3 yr old up to teenagers and Papa-LOVED it! Thanks!

I've been making brisket this way for as long as I can remember. I use a half cup of the brown sugar. It doesn't need anymore than that and add a little granulated garlic. It's easy to get everyone to the table when this is being served. It can also be made in the crock pot.

Superb! I finally have a brisket recipe that produces a tender meat. Before this I could never understand why people enjoyed brisket. I used Heinekin beer, Heinz chili sauce and dark brown sugar. Followed the directions to the letter- loved the smell in the house all afternoon.  Hubby even liked this and is not generally fond of brisket/pot roast meals.I served this with the roasted red potatoes on this site and the orange glazed carrots also on this site.

I have made this 3 times each time changing the recipe just a little.  Tonight I think I got it perfect.  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce in place of the chili sauce and 1/4 cup honey in place of the Brown sugar, then added 1 can of rotel. Beer and onions as stated in recipe. My husband said it is the best brisket he has ever tasted.

I have made this brisket a half dozen times by now and it only gets better!  Because we have a big family, I usually use a larger brisket and adjust the other ingredients accordingly, but it always comes out perfectly!  You always want to put it in a large piece of foil or cover it tightly with foil.  It isn't nearly as tender if you use a pan with a lid.

Living in Texas, you have GOT to know how to cook a brisket!  Until now, I could never get it right, always too tough to eat.  This is a GREAT recipe that solved my problem with tough brisket!  My mistake the first time was not to trim off the fat from my brisket....it made the sauce pretty much inedible but the meat was still wonderful!  The second go round I did not repeat my mistake, and WOW!  Tender meat, great tasting sauce, easy to make, and good enough to serve to any native Texan!  Thanks for the recipe, I will make again and again (and impress all my Texas friends)!

This recipe definitely lives up to its name -  the preparation was almost to easy! The chili sauce gives a wonderful flavor and the beer tenderizes the meat to perfection. I prepared this meal in the morning and let it marinade throughout the day. I will be making this again! Thanks, PMARRIE for the recipe.

This was my first time ever cooking brisket.  I made this last night and this was easy pretty quick and YUMMY.  I only used 3/4 the bottle of chilie sauce and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar. I used most of the bottle of beer, I only left one gulp left! ;) I read all of the tips that were provided by others and I followed all of the cooking directions. After it was all said and done, one thing that I found very helpful was to add a bit of liquid smoke to the extra sauce.  I then poured out most of the sauce into a plastic container and kept it for later.... I ended up using it for left over brisket tonight and made some KILLER BBQ Brisket sandwiches on Kaiser rolls with Baked seasoned freanch fries (found on this site...Yum Yum BTW).  I cut the rolls open and drizzeled the extra sauce on the insides and toasted them a bit to make them firm.   When done, I added a bit of dijon mustard on one side.  All I can say is WOW..... I get better and better at cooking every day... ;)

I made a few changes that were recommended by previous reviewers and I can't believe how great this turned out.  It smelled like heaven while it was cooking and the taste didn't disappoint.  It was super-tender.  The changes I made were: instead of sliced onion I mixed in a packet of dry onion and mushroom soup mix with the beer sauce.  I used one room-temperature bottle of Sam Adams agave beer but I think any Sam Adams-type beer would work well. I used 1/2C brown sugar instead of the 3/4 C in the recipe.  Finally, after I covered the dish with foil, I let it marinate on the counter for about 20 minutes before I put in in the oven, just to give the acidity in the sauce a chance to start working on the meat.  LOVED this and I will be making this recipe all winter.  :-)

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe was a bit too sweet; I am going to reduce the brown sugar next time and also cook at a lower temperature, as it also came out dry.  But despite this, it was still quite good!  It tasted even better the next day.

Following previous reviews about the recipe being too sweet, I marinated the meat over night in a mixture of 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup oil, 2 teaspoons of salt and 6 cloves of garlic.
Very Good!

One of the best recipes I've ever made.  This was the first time I've ever made a Beef Brisket.  It was absolutely delicious and cery easy to make.  I added cut up potatoes and carrots about 1 1/2 hours before it was done which gave it a meal all in itself.  Would definitely make again.  Even great as leftovers.

This brisket recipe is so good its ridiculous!  I have searching for a really good brisket recipe, and this is it!  I used Heiniken beer, and I also used a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  I also use only Heinz chili sauce for brisket.  I served this at passover dinner, along with another brisket (different recipe) and this one was gone instantly!  I followed the instructions exactly -- I think cooking at 325 instead of 350 makes a big difference.

I love this recipe!  It's very simple and delicious!  Though I have found where you buy the brisket makes a difference.  Meat from the grocery store or a discount bulk-buy warehouse never has achieved that tender, melt-in-your-mouth quality for me.  While a bit more expensive, I usually get my meat from Whole Foods. (And I don't buy the extra expensive 1st cut or aged)...I have never had a bad brisket from them. Anyway, I use a good brand of organic(or not) hard apple cider (you can buy a single 22 oz bottle...use what you need and drink the rest) :) instead of beer...and depending on the sweetness of the cider, I either leave out the brown sugar or use only a couple of tablespoons.  I also use an organic chili sauce made with agave nectar instead of high fructose corn syrup....I have made it with beer, and the hard cider makes for a much tastier brisket!!!

Fantastic!  This one is a keeper.  I used a bigger brisket and marinated it overnight in liquid smoke and beer.  I also added three whole sliced onions.  Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly and got raves.  This has been requested by friends many times and has become a simple favorite.

This recipe is great as listed, but I had to share a recent disaster to prove how forgiving this idiot-proof recipe can be. I put in the slow cooker at 10 PM to cook for 8 hours. My plan was to let it cool, then refrigerate all day. Scoop off the fat, take remaining liquid and make a reduction on the stove. Rewarm all to serve. On this particular morning, the alarm clock failed and I ran out the door leaving the brisket to cook for a total of 14 hours. It was still good, beef was tender in juices and tasted delicious.

Simply delicious!  I used a 6# brisket to make this but did not increase the other ingredients.  Because the brisket was so large I used an aluminum lasagna pan placed on a cookie sheet for support to bake it in.  I did add another hour of cooking time since the increased size.  This was by far the most moist and tender brisket our family has ever had and I will make it again and again.

Excellent and easy! However, needs much longer cooking timI prepared a 7 1/2 pound brisket and baked it for 5 hours the day before I planned to serve it.  I refrigerated it overnight. This made it easy to remove the fat from the top of the marinade and to remove all the fat from the meat. I cut the meat into slices and put it into a smaller roasting dish, covered it with the skimmed marinade and put it back in the oven for an hour and a half so it was hot and wonderful for dinner. I added a little BBQ sauce to the top when I served it and had some more on hand for those who wanted it. Very tender and so tasty!

No...no...no. Perhaps this WAS easy, but it wasn't good. This is the first time I've made beef brisket and boy was I disappointed! In 2 hours the meat was already at 200 degrees...either turn the heat down or plan on quick cooking. Also, the sauce wasn't good either. I don't think the beer & chili sauce was a good combo. It tasted a bit sour. I'm sorry PMARRIE, but this just wasn't worth my time.

To help keep the brisket jucier and add a ton of flavor bake in a Turkey Oven bag. Just poke a hole on top of the bag so it can release some steam but no leak any of the juice.

Perfect & so easy a child could make this. It's even better after it sits in the fridge for a few hours; it mellows the beer taste & becomes almost like a sweet BBQ flavor. UNBELIEVABLY good. My brisket was just under 2 lbs. I cooked it for 3 hours & removed the foil 1/2 hour before it was done. So tender we didn't need a knife! I used a pale ale but may try a Belgian white beer next time & perhaps just 8 ozs to see if I can dim the beer flavor just a knotch. This recipe was great as -is though and will go into our regular Sunday dinner rotation. It's certainly impressive enough for company.

Amazing!!!!!!! I bought an 8  brisket and doubled the other ingredients with the exception of the sugar which I left as written. Eveyone loved it and asked for leftovers. This will be a regular in our household. Thank you for this one!!!!!

2011-12-14  An easy & flavorful tender brisket recipe.  I used Sierra Nevada pale ale and added granulated garlic to the seasoning of the brisket but otherwise made the recipe as is.  Thank you for an excellent recipe, PMARRIE.

Loved it!, after reading the reviews I only added, half a cup of sugar. It tastes delicious. I was afraid it was going to taste just like bbq sauce, but it tastes so much better

This is great.  I followed the recipe exactly and used yeunling lager beer.  This will go into our rotation.  It does make lots of extra sauce but I think it's important that the meat is sitting in a 'bath' of sauce and the sauce is great over mashed potatoes and to dip your meat into as you eat it.  YUM.

This was excellent. We didn't think that this was too sweet which was mentioned by previous reviewers. I added the usual garlic (smile). Once this was cooked, we let it rest then sliced it up on a board and served with our favorite homemade barbecue sauce on the side. Thanks so much for the post!

As the recipe is written this tastes like a pot roast to me. The sauce is delicious, but this recipe was so much better when I seared the beef on both sides before putting it in the oven. Searing the beef makes a huge difference in the flavor of this recipe. I highly recommend taking that extra step and then following the recipe as written for best results. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe.  The beer and chilli sauce gave it a unique flavour.  Like some other reviewers, I also cut down on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, because I found the chilli sauce to be innately quite sweet already.  Some other modifications I made: 1) I sautéed the onions with 4 cloves of minced garlic first (on stovetop), then browned the brisket together with the garlic/onions before adding the liquids/sauce.  I then put it into the oven.  2) Cooked it in a Dutch oven instead - works great.  3) In the last 30 min of cooking, I added chunks of carrots, celery, and zucchini to get in the veggies.  4) I used added 1/2 cup of tomato paste and cut down the chilli sauce to ~1 cup.  If you have time, you could do the braising the night before or the morning of, then refrigerate and allow the fat to rise to the top and solidify.  Then you can skim off all the solid fat and reheat to serve - makes recipe a lot healthier.

I used this recipe as a basic way to try cooking the brisket since I did not have any chili sauce. I have an electric oven, so my results may be different. 2 lb brisket at 325 for about 3 1/2 hours.Preheated oven at 325. Trimmed all the white fatty parts off the meat w/sharp scissors. While the electric oven was getting warm, I put alot of onion powder, garlic powder, ground pepper and a little chili powder on the all sides of the brisket and then let it sit for 25 minutes. Mixed 1 bottle of litehouse beer with 1/4 cup of Ortega taco sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 packet of onion soup, more pepper, garlic powder, little celery salt. I let that sit in bowl, then seared my meat. I used a little olive oil in a frying pan, turned heat up and carefully placed the seasoned meat in the sizzling pan. Seared about 30 seconds on each side, then seared it again another 30 seconds to get a slight brown crispy look.  I quickly put the meat in the glass baking dish and poured sauce mix in. I threw in some baby carrots and 1 large sliced onion. Covered the dish with 2 layers of foil. Cooked for 2 1/2 hours before checking on it. Took it out of oven and tried it,still slightly tough so poured some of sauce over meat,placed in oven 1/2 hr more. Microwaved a Lean Cuisine Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli dish and a frozen bag of Green Giant Seasoned potato & green beans. Took meat out and threw in the ravioli and potatoes. Put in oven another 15 min. Delicious and so tender with nice seasoned flavor!

we've made this for multiple parties and it gets rave reviews!  we typically end up pulling the meat instead of slicing.  it's a little quicker.  Also, we've been cooking closer to 7lbs and we don't add much more marinade, if any.  cook time is also about the same or perhaps a little longer.  cutting larger briskets in half helps keep the time more similar to the recipe

I get rave reviews on this brisket - there are never any leftovers!  After reading other reviews I decided to make it without the brown sugar.  Don't bother to trim it; put it in the pan fat side up and it will baste the meat.   I put onions both under and on top of the brisket .  I cook this a day or two before I want to serve it, refrigerate it when it is done cooking, and when it is cold I slice it.  Heat in a slow cooker before meal time.  Make sure to always slice it against the grain - there are tutorial videos on line if you don't know how to do that.

My boyfriend and I just moved into together and not having any cooking experience I paniced and found allrecipes.com. I've NEVER made anything close to brisket! I followed the recipe to a T and it was DELICIOUS and my boyfriend thinks i can cook now! The meat fell right off the bone. I too only cooked it for 3 hours. It was great!

made exactly to recipe, excellent, restaurant quality. used heineken.  still laughing about folks who said cook time is off.  You are braising, forget the thermometer when braising, just cook low and slow, you are tenderizing the meat. used a flat cut brisket trimmed of fat. very easy, very tender flavorful brisket.  my first brisket..many thanks for recipe.

I had never cooked a brisket before, so based on the good reviews this recipe got, I thought it would be a good one to start with.  The brisket I bought was about 2 lbs, so I had plenty of marinade left.  Since I don't eat red meat, I used the extra on a chicken breast.  I followed the same directions given for the brisket and it was amazingly good!  My family enjoyed the brisket and said that it was really tender and moist.  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 c as someone else suggested.  I think 3/4 c would have been way too sweet.

This was my first time making brisket. ( I am not a novice cook) It was DEEE-LISH!! I didn't have beer, so I used part beef broth and part of a can of cherry limeade from MinuteMade ( thought about using root beer but opted not to-maybe next time). This made a lot of sauce. I think next time I'll cut that part in half. I used 1/2 c brown sugar like others suggested. I started mine in the oven at 300 for an hour and then decreased the oven temp to 275 for 3 hours and let it bake while I was at church. Got home, removed top foil, and increased temp to 325 for 30 min like the recipe states. It was very moist. The sauce wasn't as thick as bbq, but wasn't like water either, but it was still good. Shredding the rest of it and having bbq beef sandwiches with the leftovers. My kids and Husband both enjoyed this as well.

Definitely five stars plus.  Yesterday, Christmas day, my daughter hosted the dinner party.  She used the recipe for the brisket  that I gave her..she used, in addition one package of Liptons onion soup. An onion sliced, and some chopped garlic.  Instead of the beer, she used 10 oz. of white wine (Chardonnay).  She cooked it exactly, according to the recipe.  As she did it the day before, she cooled it off, sliced it and poured the marinade over it.  Then, she covered it and put it in the refrigerator overnight.  This, actuall, marinated the meat further,  next day, she put it in the oven at 350o for 1/2 hr. covered with aluminum.  The results were fantastic.  It was the best brisket I ever had and the guests agreed.  Thanks for that delicious recipe.  She, also, cut the brown sugar to 1/2 a cup.

I have made brisket with my Mom's old recipe for years and decided to try something new. This was delicious and filled the house with a delicious smell while cooking. The only change I made was to add some onion soup mix into the sauce and my only problem was no leftovers!

This brisket is the recipe the family demands for special occasions.  I've made it a half dozen times.  I've substituted onion soup for onion and omitted the sugar once, but it tastes best following the basic directions. I use the slow cooker on low all day. Serve the sauce with egg noodles.  An easy meal that's a crowd favorite!  I've made it in the oven too but found that the cooking time was WAAAY too long.

This was the first time I made a brisket,  and it turned out wonderful. I made it in the crock pot, it was just too hot for the oven. I added about 5 cloves of crushed garlic and a few dried chipotle peppers. The peppers gave it a nice smoky flavor. After cooking for about 6 hours, I took the meat out, scraped away the fat and shredded the meat. In the pot I added some corn starch dissolved in water, and it thickened everything up quite nicely, then returned the meat to the pot for about two more hours. delicious!

Awsome!  I have always had trouble cooking a brisket right, but I figured it out with this one.  I use a big carving fork and really watch the brisket toward the end.  Right when the big fork goes in and out with ease, take it out of the oven.  Then when it cools and you slice it and reheat, it will be perfect and melt in your mouth.

So tasty and easy!  Finally have a way to cook brisket so it is flavorful and tender.  All I added was 4-5 smashed cloves of garlic.  Served on toasted sandwich rolls with the sauce.  Yum!

Except for reducing the amount of brown sugar slightly (husband does not like sweet meat dishes) I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very bland and the meat was dry and flavorless.  I don't understand why so many people liked this recipe.

It was  good, But I think I came up with something better. The brisket, the onion, salt and pepper, add garlic powder. 1 beer. 1 bottle of Kraft Honey Mustard BBQ sauce. I was going to do the two day, cook and reheat, but everyone devoured it immediately. With this BBQ sauce you can omit brown sugar, honey, etc. This is also a great recipe for brats, just throw in some bell peppers, follow recipe, then throw on the grill to char.

My family loved this!!!  This was the first brisket that I have made.  I only used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I put the oven on 275 degrees at 1:30 p.m. hoping that it would be ready for supper at 6 p.m.  I ended up going shopping with my children and my husband left the brisket in the oven.  So, at 9:45 p.m. I took it out and it was better than yummy !!!  I put the meat on everything bread with some of the juice and it was delicious!

The sauce was delicious considering only 3 ingredients.  Tasted like a honey bb-q.  I did this recipe exactly as shown, but my meat wasn't fork tender.  It was good, but would have been very dry without the sauce on top.   Not sure why my meat didn't come out as tender as other reviewers.

I reduced the heat to 275 and cooked for 5-6 hours. Separate the meat from the juice and thickened it up with a cornstarch slurry and it was "to die for!" Thanks for a very simple and tasty recipe.

I made this brisket for easter. i did change it a bit because i didn't have the tomato based chili sauce. i used hunts tomato sauce and two fresh jalepenos. i used heineken and everything else to the recipe. it was tender enough and that was my main worry. the brisket was a little dry though.  the meat had a good flavor and the onions were even yummy.  with the leftover meat i pulled it apart and added some bbq sauce for a beef bbq sandwich. i also drained the onions and floured and fried those for onion straws to go with my sandwiches. all in all it is a good recipe.

If my husband could give this a 10, he would, and I totally agree.  I made a reduction for the brisket with the juices,  cider vinegar, garlic salt, butter, pepper, worcestershire sauce and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. Yum!

I cut a 8lb brisket in half and cooked both. I didn't have beer so I used one cup red wine instead. Two bottles of chili sauce mixed with 1 cup br.sugar, one onion sliced in bottom of roasting pan. I cooked it 3 1/2 hours with it tightly covered the whole time. THEE BEST brisket recipe I have tried.   WARNING:cut as much fat off as you can - I didn't serve my "gravy" it was like greasy soup.   LEFTOVERS: I want to share this treat - the next day my husband put the left over meat(which I had poured the sauce over)in the broiler and he let it crisp up with burnt bits...very good and still moist.

This is so simple and so good. My husband requests it. I cut the sweet chili sauce in half, though, because it is spicy.

I used a 3 pound brisket and after 3 hours, the meat thermometer was already 190 degrees?? I served immediately and it was still delicious, I think I'll put it on a lower rack in the oven or take it down to 300 degrees.

I will admit this recipe is Simple & Easy. I followed it exactly, however, during the last 30 minutes I covered with bottled BBQ sauce. The flavor was good but not wonderful it seemed a little dry. My husband was not impressed but he ate it, my 6 yr old daughter (who loves meat) wouldn't touch it, I thought it was okay. A simple and easy recipe but lacks flavor.  One tip to preventing the meat from shredding is to cut across the grain and use a VERY sharp knife.

My husband absolutely LOVED this dish.  And nothing could be "easier"!!!  I did cut back on the brown sugar and only used a 1/2 cup as others had suggested.  I will probably only use 1/4 cup next time.  But believe me.....I WILL make this over and over and over!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

We made this for Christmas Eve and it was delicious! I cooked two briskets in beef broth and sliced onions in a slow cooker all night on low. In the morning I took them out and set them aside to let the meat rest then I sliced it. I made the sauce, instead of beer I used chicken broth and cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup. I put layers of sliced brisket, onion slices and sauce in the slow cooker and cooked on low again until it was time to eat. It was very tender and that sauce was delicious! We will be making this again, thanks so much for the recipe!

Frustrating! Tried this recipe twice & both times it boiled & the meat came out stringy and dry, despite lowering the oven temperature on the 2nd attempt.  Not worth any more trouble as far as I can tell.

Simple and tasty.  I also cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup as many reviews suggested.  I added a little garlic powder when salt and peppering the roast.  Just slice thinly against the grain and serve with the sauce.  My side dishes were corn souffle and cheesy scalloped potatoes.

We did this recipe for our Christmas dinner!! We used a 13 lb brisket and just changed the serving size to fit. It turned out great. We made it the night before and put it in a crockpot to reheat the next morning.

I made this in my slow cooker for 6 hours on low.  Next time I think I'll do it for a little less time.  Other than that it was DELICIOUS.

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't think it was too sweet. I served mine as sandwiches on Texas toast with pickles and the onions. I'll add more onions next time because they had an amazing flavor and added a lot to the sandwiches. I used a BBQ recipe from the Neely's to top it all off. I have a convection oven and turned it down to 290º, but it was still slightly overdone, so I'll try 285º next time. Thanks for the recipe!!

SOOOO GOOOOOD!!!  I'm horking the brisket down as we speak!  This was incredibly easy.  I didn't have chili sauce, so I used a 10oz. can of tomato sauce, a half a packet of chili seasoning, and a few squeezes of sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Mmmmm so yummy and tender!!  I agree with another reviewer - make this in the oven!  The slow cooker dries it out too much.

This was a very good recipe -- the brisket turned out tender and juicy.  I thickened the pan juices with a little cornstarch and served the delicious spicy-sweet sauce along with the meat.  It made a lot of sauce -- I think you could either cut the sauce recipe in half (just drink that extra half-can of beer!) or thicken the sauce as I did and serve it with meatballs, burgers, a plain meatloaf or even with grilled chicken breasts.  You could also use it to heat little smokies or hot dog pieces and serve it as an appetizer or a kid-friendly finger food.

This was very good, I enjoyed it, my wife thought it was fantastic.  I intend to use this as the basis for my next brisket, but will think hard about how I can add some complexity into the flavor.  Perhaps a careful study of the other reviews will inspire me.

I am not sure if I did everything right, since other people have said that theirs turned out really tender. Mine wasn't as tender as I would have liked it. Husband loved it though, so giving it a 4 stars :)Oh, and I also reduced the brown sugar a tad.

Five stars for flavor!  What a great taste!  I gave the recipe four stars though, only because of a few slight moderations that I made:  I halved the beer and chili sauce and used only 1/4 cup brown sugar.  (and still had a LOT of extra sauce)  Salted and peppered beef and seared it before putting into oven.  Baked for an hour and a half...perfect!

Wow!  My family LOVED this recipe!  We already have a few other brisket recipes that we love, but this is just as wonderful.  I was concerned about a "beer" taste, as I am not fond of beer.  However, it was sweet and tender with no hint of beer taste.  :)

First time I've ever had brisket & this was by far fabulous.  Agree to cut down on the brown sugar.  My mom, tiny thing, even had 3 helpings which is unheard of.

Wonderful recipe.  I cooked it 20 mins per lb and the meat wasn't tender enough.  Next time I will cook at a lower temp 250 degrees and for a much longer time.  I saved the drippings, drained the fat, added liquid smoke and thicken the sauce.  It made a wonderful BBQ sauce for the Brisket.  Also, I used an electric knife to cut thin slices.  A keeper.

An absolutely delicious and easy way to make brisket. I didn't change a thing. It's become one of my family's favorite dinners. And the leftovers are great too!

Wow - the brisket came out wonderful.  The only thing I did different was I cooked it in a foiled pan on the grill.  It is way to hot for oven cooking.  I covered it with foil until about the last 45 minutes.  The meat just fell apart it was so tender.  We eat it on nice hard rolls.  Excellent recipe - will definitely keep this one!

Made this following the recommendations of others. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, one package of onion soup mix, and minced garlic. MUST use a 9x13 glass dish. I used a 7x11 and it overflowed in my new oven. It is a little too sweet, I may try 1/4 cup sugar next time

I followed this recipe with a few changes based on the recommendations made from the reviews. I loved the suggestion to replace the chili sauce with Jack Daniels BBQ & to use Honey instead of brown sugar. I did both of those and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written and let me tell you this was such a hit at my house! My hubby wanted me to make something else and put the remaining sauce over it too. This was also my first time preparing brisket.

I've made this a 4-5 times with brisket, and decided to try it with a venison roast, which came out very nicely. Tender, juicy, not gamey--I would definitely do it again with that cut of meat. I usually select a very dark beer--a porter, stout or other dark ale. This time I used a dark winter lager (not unlike black lager from Guinness), it also did the trick. I substitute a bit of the bottled chili sauce with  Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce and select sweet white onion, rather than a pungent red.

This recipe made the brisket very tender, but it was a little bit sweet.  If I make it again, I will alter the amount of brown sugar used, as well as try a different type of chili or barbecue sauce.

YUM! I didn't have a tomato based chili sauce, so I used garlic chili instead, and (stupidly) decided sriracha would add the tomato I needed (I don't know if there is any tomato in there, it was just the reddest bottle next to the chili sauce). Anyways, this came out awesome, and incredibly spicy. And I figured that out when I fed some to the baby and he screamed. I thought he loved it and wanted more.... :( cue the milk, lots of milk. 
I cooked it until it reached an internal temp of 205 deg. PERFECT.
NOTE  second time I used this chili sauce

First time I have ever tried to prepare a brisket.  It was absolutely great...tender and tasty.  We are not brown sugar fans so I did reduce the amount a tad.  Plan to make a whole one this weekend for company and serve with hard rolls for sandwiches.

This is good Sunday comfort food. I've never cooked brisket before (except corned beef) and have been reluctant to try it. This is a very easy recipe. My brisket was 4.5# so I added another 25% of each sauce ingredient. The timing stayed the same. The whole house smelled wonderfully. The sauce is similar to the ketchup/brown sugar topping on meatball with a kick. I put halved baby carrots in the juice when I took the foil off. It was served over noodles. I am curious about photograph #1. The sauce looks crystallized.

As a mis-placed Texan, I was sad to find brisket is not in every grocery store.  I don't understand, this is a wonderful cut of meat.  We are in a temp house in North Carolina with no crock pot and want some Texas BBQ (vinegar based sauce?  really?).  Made this and all is right with my world.  The secret is: grits.  I was down to my last potato once when I made the crock pot version and whipped up some instant grits.  Now it's one of the top requested recipes from my family, Brisket and Grits.  And we all liked the oven method better than the crock pot.  The sauce was thicker by the end of the cook time.  Made it just like the recipe but did not add the brown sugar.  And add the onions!  Those cooked down strips of love add so much to the finished dish, even the kid that doesn't like onions scoops them up.  Thanks for an easy wonderful meal.

I've been making brisket with this recipe for 3 years. Didn't change a thing. Absolutely delicious. Every time I get rave reviews and multiple requests for the recipe.  If I'm out of chili sauce I simply add chili powder to regular ketchup (after all, that's what chili sauce is).

I made this on 4th of July.  It really is good!! It was tastey, moist, and shredding. The house smelled heavenly while cooking. The only thing I suggest would be to use Coors light beer, I used too much beer. I used Heineken,  it was a bit heavy for my taste. However, all the men really enjoyed it except for one of the teenagers.

This was super easy and you cannot mess it up!  The brisket was so tender it actually fell apart when I cut it. And it was so flavorful! We got many compliments from our guests. My only suggestion would be to line your glass dish with aluminum foil. That would have made clean up much easier!

Very easy and delicious. I made this for my husband's Father's Day dinner, he loved it!  I couldn't find chili sauce in my supermarket, so I made my own following this recipe http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/58499/chili-sauce (omitting the brown sugar, because of the sugar in the brisket recipe). Turned out great!

I had never cooked brisket when I found this recipe. Followed it (almost) exactly. Only thing is I substituted the chili sauce for hickory smoked BBQ sauce. My husband and I devoured it...and now I'm making it again!!

I've never made a brisket before but my fiance loves brisket so I used this recipe. Followed the directions exactly the way they were and it was perfect. Very tender and it wasn't sweet at all. He loved it and I will be using this recipe from now on.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 star rating simply because we found it too sweet.  However,  I will be making it again as it is delicious and very fast to prepare but I will cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup the next time I make it. Thanks for posting.

Amazing Recipe - I used Baby Ray's Steak Marinade & Ketchup (didn't have the other stuff) and used Christmas Ale for the beer. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Did a 7 lb brisket.. SHOCKED at how tender. Also, I trimmed the fat & didn't marinate or anything.

This was tender, but the sauce ruined it for me. I think it was the chili sauce was just too over powering. A touch of BBQ sauce or smoke flavoring would have been nice. I love BBQ, but my husband does not, yet neither of us cared for it. I did rinse the sauce off after taste testing in the last hour, and replaced it all with beef broth. It helped, but still had an undesirable wang left from the chili sauce. I will try this again without the chili sauce.

A little too sweet for me.  I generally cook brisket in the slow cooker and it is very tender.  This was a little dry; not near as tender.

to my3scouts. i think they meant bottled chili sauce not canned chilis in tomato sauce. That is why your's was spicy. I think it was meant to be sweet and sour.

If I make this again, will try cutting sugar in half, it was way too sweet. Also will try mincing the onions, as I didn't like the mushy onion strands. The sauce winds up tasting very similar to my hamburger BBQ

I've made this brisket three times now, only instead of the oven I put it in my crockpot on low for 7-8 hours. It absolutely DELICIOUS!  I served it over fried polenta slices when I had friends over for dinner and they loved it.

Simple and so delicious.  I have used this recipe with corned beef and pot roast and it's a no-fail hit with my friends and family.  Great to serve for a few or a crowd. After the first try, I cut back on the sugar a little and I like it even more.  Give this one a try!

Wow!  This is fantastic.  It is tender, juicy, and had a real BBQ flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a Heineken beer.  My BF and I enjoyed this so much.  Thank you, PMARRIE!

This was a great recipe.  I slightly changed the following.  After seasoning with salt and pepper I coated the brisket with flour and sprinkled cardamom and coriander on top.  I then browned the brisket on both sides, in veg. oil, then added it to the cooking pan.  I placed my cut onions in the pan with the drippings from the browned meat  and cooked them for 5 mn., then added those to the meat.  The rest of the recipe I followed except I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  My family loved it.

The only problem I see with this is the cooking temperature.  I followed the recipe but cut the temp to 200 and cooked in all night.  It was falling apart the next day and was so moist.  I sereved it at our Labor Day cookout and got tons of compliments.  Next time I will use my favorite bar b que sauce since this one didn't seem to have much flavor.

I had never cooked a brisket before, and was expecting a house-load of hungry people over for a birthday party.  As some of my guests were from Texas, I knew I could not fool them into consuming a sub-par roasted piece of meat.  After stumbling across this recipe and all of it's helpful comments, I think I definitely held my own.  I opted not to cut the fat off (per a smart reviewer's suggestion), and to roast the brisket in beer/ beef broth with minimal ingredients (onions, red pepper flakes, salt/ pepper).  After roasting, the fat was easily removed and the meat easily shredable.  Placing all of the meat and juices in the slow cooker, I then added my own sauce composed of fire roasted tomatoes, red pepper, onion, garlic, cilantro, *small* amount of sugar, and (most important ingredient) a small can of chipotles in adobo.  What a success...everyone (including the Texans) asked what my secret ingredient was (chipoltles), and how I got the meat so tender.  I will definitely use this method again in the future for other flavors.

This was a good recipe, but not great. Next time, we are going to add a little more beer and water, then a little less chili sauce. I found it too spicy for my taste. The brown sugar content could be reduced in half and cooking time shortened. Thanks for the recipe, it was our first with a brisket.

Too sweet . . . even after reducing the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. (The chili sauce which is only spicy ketchup already has sugar in it.) I think 1-2 TBs brown sugar would be better. As others have noted, mine was also dry. I think this has to do with trimming the fat layer since I've never had this problem when leaving the fat layer on. Finally, other beer braises for beef use some beef stock and much more beer. Both would have helped here. Still, the idea of using chili sauce with its characteristic kick in the braising liquid is very clever.

I made this recipe for dinner last night.  It was the first time I've tried a brisket and it was wonderful!! My son said he couldn't stop eating it.  I used light beer and it was soooo tender.  I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and broccoli.  What a hit!

I used this as a basis for my brisket recipe. I wanted to cook it overnight for Monday lunch and didn't have access to beer so I used beef broth and tomato sauce best I remember. My customers really enjoyed it. I love slow cooker/roaster recipes.

I used a 2 lb. brisket, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and a 12-oz. jar of (seafood) cocktail sauce since I was out of chili sauce.  Added 1/2 cup water to make the sauce go farther.  Cooked 4 hours (could have been 5 for more tender meat).  It was delicious.  Great leftovers for sandwiches, too.

Super easy, and really good. I left out the onions and, shred half of the beef in the sauce, and left half without sauce. Both ways were good.

Even great for leaner cuts of meat that may be tough when cooked another way!  I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and added another onion and it was great!!

I used the recipe from this website for Chili Sauce in this dish.  It really turned out wonderfully.  I would have liked the meat to be a bit more tender, but the flavor was extraordinary!  Puts a much better spin on an otherwise incredibly boring pot roast!

Simple and good.  It went great with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  Be prepared for lots of left-overs.

Very good recipe.  The briskets were all very large when I went to buy it so the butcher recommened a tri-tip.  Some areas around the country use this instead of brisket.  The meat was very tender.  Next time I would use a little less brown sugar when making it, just a little too sweet for our taste.

This recipe was so easy to make and it was definitely a crowd pleaser!  I made it for the family one night, and my mom even loved it (she has trouble eating beef sometimes, but this was very tender!).

This was my first attempt at beef brisket, and it won't be the last.  This recipe should be renamed "Simply the Best Beef Brisket Ever"!  It really was delicious, and so tender (and yes, easy).  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

Extremely easy! My family loved it. I didn't realize I was out of onions, so I used a little onion powder in the sauce. It wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it was pretty good and very moist. (I would give it 4 stars, but I was out-voted 4-1 by the rest of my family).

My first attempt at Brisket.  Everyone loved it!!  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes the first night and we had bbq brisket sandwiches with coleslaw and corn on the cob the second night.  Great leftovers.  I would like to try brisket on the grill some day, I am afraid of it drying up, though.

This was a very good, easy way to fix a brisket.  The only thing I would change is the amount of brown sugar.  Next time, I will only use half the amount suggested.  Just a little too sweet for us but was still delicious and very tender.  Thank you for a quick, wonderful recipe!

This was SO tender and so easy.  I did let it marinate overnight in the beer, per one reviewer's suggestion.  The flavor of the sauce was ok for me.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yummy in my tummy! My husband kept eating at it after we finished dinner and he never does that. My changes recommendation is use about half the amount of sauce. Cook 3.5 hours before removing foil for the last half hour. And finally, cook in cast iron- it really helps the flavor and texture. Mmmm.

The sauce was a little sweet for my taste - maybe my problem was the beer - I used stout.  Meat very tender, could slice or shred.

I made this the other night and I thought it was very good but I will cut down on the brown sugar and maybe add some liquid smoke or crushed red peppers to the recipe the next time I make it because it was a little on the sweet side.

Perfect brisket!  Full of flavour and sooo tender.  This will be a company winner.  I didn't have enough chili sauce, so I mixed what I had left with some jalapeno ketchup, a dollop of sriracha sauce, and some Worchestershire to make the 12-oz.  I also reduced the sugar a bit.  Man-oh-man, is it GOOD!

The one thing I do with my Brisket, ALWAYS: I soak it in water for a few hours before cooking.
 That being said, this recipe was wonderful.  I will make it again.  I didn't make any substitutions or changes.

This was my first brisket. This recipe was very easy and tasted great. I was a little intimidated by it but I jumped in. I used jack Daniels bbq sauce and Killian’s Red beer . This will be a repeat for dinner.

Substituted cooking red wine cuz I didn't have beer.  Sub'ed beefy onion  dry soup mix for the salt.   Used 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Threw everything in an oven cooking bag for easy cleanup.  Everyone liked it.   Served with pilaf orzo  and will be making this again!

This simple marinade was perfect.  Tangy  and sweet.  I cooked the brisket according to the recipe. I allowed it to cook another hour, it only got better. The sauce thickened and browned even more.  I found my new go to recipe.  
Delicious!

I used about half the chili sauce as my family is not fond of too hot or spicy. I substituted buckwheat honey for the brown sugar. I baked it in a covered pyrex casserole. (French White). Absolute perfection.

This recipe was not only super easy but came out amazing!  The only thing different I did was I used regular chili sauce.  The meat was super tender and delicious!  I served it over wide egg noodles.

Turns out amazing! Per the other suggestions I add onion soup mix to the recipe but I also use fresh onion sliced up scattered on top. I have used this recipe to make brisket and other roast cuts. I have cooked in the oven and in a slow cooker (in high for 6 hours for roast) it comes out absolutely perfect every time!

We really enjoyed it. Had an almost 4 lb brisket, so made sauce as directed and didn't think it was too sweet. Tasted better as leftovers the next night!!

Used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, but I felt that was still too sweet. Will try with 1 TB brown sugar next time since the chili sauce adds considerable sweetness as well.
Used an oven temperature of 300 F, but after 3 hours the brisket's internal temp already registered at >200 F, so next time I will shorten the time in the oven.
I also added 2 smashed garlic cloves.
Overall it was tasty, though, and very easy to prepare.

First time using this recipe but not first time making brisket.  Easy. Meat was very tender.  I always make brisket the day ahead not using the full baking time.  Separate from the liquid and onions, chill overnight, slice thin and continue baking the next day back in with the liquid and onion, low and slow.  Perfect every time!  I may cut back on brown sugar next time.. just a bit sweet for my husband.  Loved the slight beer taste.

Outrageously delicious and easy! I make brisket for every Jewish holiday. Decided to try a new recipe this year and this one was the best ever! I used an IPA pale ale, Heinz chili sauce and half a cup of brown sugar, one sliced onion. I followed the baking directions exactly and it came out perfect. Love this brisket

Made my first brisket last night using this recipe, and it definitely will not be my last. I generally use the recipe given exactly as written, but had no onions on hand so did skip that part. My father practically licked his plate! Thank you so much for sharing, I look forward to making this again soon!

I made the single recipe and enjoyed it very much. 

Question: if I double the recipe - two separate pans (each with 3 lb of brisket & ingredients), should I increase the temperature or double cooking time? 

Any suggestions are welcome.

Very good! One addition I would make: when I took off foil for last 30 minutes, I cut up a stick of butter and threw it in. Gave it a nice richness!

was easy and sauce was very good , and because it was "low and slow" ... you could have used it on tougher cuts of meat

I used tomato paste, rather than the spicier alternative.  My husband cannot eat the spicy!  It turned out moist and tender!

Very easy. We had a bigger brisket and added BBQ sauce at the table. Everyone loved it and it was very moist. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out moist and tender after 3 hours. I saved the drippings & poured it into a sauce pan and cooked it down to pour over the beef when serving. We ate it on  buns with a dill pickle on the side. Good eating'! This recipe is a keeper! I just wish that I would have used a bigger brisket ;-)

"Low and Slow" is the key to this recipe.  My 3.14 lb. brisket cooked down quite a bit and there was a thick layer of fat that I couldn't see when I chose it at the market.  It fed 4 people, so if you are counting on feeding generous portions, or more than 4-6 modest servings, I suggest getting a brisket more in the 5 lb. range.

This turned out great.  I used Jack Daniels barbecue sauce instead of the chili sauce and cut down the sugar to just a tablespoon, but I think it would have been great as written too.  The leftovers are fantastic.

This was very simple to make and delicious. My kids don't love onions so after cooking the beef with the onions over it, I strained the sauce at the end and poured the 'gravy' over the meat.  I also reduced the brown sugar to a 1/2 cup as per other reviewers and that seemed perfect.  I made it with potato pancakes and spinach souffle .  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was quite easy to prepare and all my guests loved it. I did create my own tomato based chili sauce.
I actually made this for Christmas (but didn't take the time to go back and review it at the time). I'll be cooking a much larger version, later today, for Easter.
Thanks for the recipe.

Really is the simplest brisket...and ohhh so good.  Trimming the fat is key.  The sauce is good if you don't trim but fabulous if you take the time to do it.  My family drools when they walk into the house and smell it cooking.

I can honestly say that I have never cooked a brisket before and I was a little skeptical. This turned out wonderful. I pulled the beef apart into strips and put over mashed potatoes with the broth.  Really good. Husband loved it.

I should have known this recipe would be bad when it violated the cardinal rule of cooking brisket:  "low and slow."   I followed the recipe exactly.  The 325 temperature is WAY to high with a cook time that is too short.  The brisket came out dry with the consistency of shoe leather in a sauce that was way too sweet and ketchupy.

I probably screwed up. I tried to make it in my slow cooker and it didn't work too well. The sauce ended up too thin; probably because the lid on the slow cooker held in the moisture and didn't allow the sauce to thicken. I added cut carrots and potatoes which was good. I will try a different recipe next time.

First time brisket maker - It turned out soooo good!!  Used 5 lb brisket and baked it the night before. Did not trim off the fat.  Seasoned meat with salt/Pepper and a pack of Lipton Beef Soup Mix. Put sliced onions under and on top. Cooked fatty side up.  Only 1/2 c of brown sugar and added some minced garlic to the other sauce ingredients. Poured over, covered w/foil and baked as stated. Put entire pan in fridge overnight.  In the am, so easy to remove the fat from the liquid; thin sliced the brisket, spooned sauce over slices and returned to the fridge. To serve, I warmed oven to 350 and baked covered for 30 min. Made a lot of sauce, very moist and tender.

This was my first try at cooking a beef brisket. It was a fresh 5 and a quarter lb brisket. I used a basic steak rub which included salt and let it marinate overnight. I used  beer (Stella Artois 16 oz), brown sugar (1/2 cup) and barbecue sauce (Jack Daniels w honey). My favorite barbecue sauce is Sweet Baby's Ray, but saw reviews for Jack Daniels and decided to switch it up. After making the sauce, it was a bit too sweet so I added a, little more beer. I rubbed the brisket with olive oil and added onions and crushed garlic cloves to the top and bottom. Used a glass casserole and  about half of the liquid sauce. I was planning to cook the brisket for 5 hours at 275 degrees. However, when I took it out to add potatoes and carrots, the brisket was done in four hours. At this point, the meat was tender and DELICIOUS!! To cook the potatoes and carrots, I added the liquid essence from the brisket to the potatoes and carrots and baked until tender. Then added the  essence in addition to the unused sauce to the sliced meat. Although the meat ended up being sweeter than I like, it was fabolous. The meat was tender and my family thought the flavor was on point. Since the unused mixture did not contain the juices from the meat, the end result was sweeter than I like. Will definitely use this recipe again and will reduce the amount of brown sugar.

Also a very good recipe for the slow cooker.  I gave it 6 to 6 1/2 hrs (first half on high, then on low).  The flavors were very good.

I'm a huge brisket fan, and for the longest time my mom's brisket was the best. Not any more. This is my absolute favorite brisket recipe. It's so delicious and really so easy to make. When I don't have onions (or feel like chopping them) I just use onion powder and it tastes just as good.

This is wonderfully delicious! It doesn't need another thing! Tender, juicy, sooooo good! And I'm gluten free, so used gluten free beer. Will definitely keep and use this recipe again!

The recipe tasted good but the cook time was way off, mine ended up needing an extra 2 hours to get to remotely soft.

Used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 5 lb. brisket.  Remaining ingredients as written and cooked as indicated temp & time. Flavor is mild, meat was tender, easy to eat with just a fork.  I used Stella Artois and placed meat in roasting pan and covered with foil as one of the reviews said the pan lid will yield not as good result as foil cover. 

Next time I will substitute Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and honey for the Chili sauce & brown sugar in order to have a different flavor

This was my first try at a brisket. Very tender, melt in your mouth. I did take the advise if others as well, and only use 1/2 brown sugar. Delicious!

Loved the flavor, but mine turned out a little dry. I think a little less time or maybe cooking at 300 degrees would be better.

My family loved this dinner; I browned the brisket and let it sit overnight, then reheated in the crockpot. You need to plan in advance for this one but it is worth it. I served with mashed potatoes, glazed carrots and a salad.

It was juicy and delicious! The only change I made was cutting back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Next time I'll cut back a little more mainly because the Brisket size.

I've made this recipe following the recipe, but I've also made it in a slow cooker, but covering the brisket and onions with a bottle of Heinz chili sauce - slow at 8 hours. You can also use a simple bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce. Slow cooking or in the oven - both methods will work well. Whatever you do, don't shorten the cook time because brisket is definitely not tender and needs every minute in the oven or slow cooker. The results are worth the wait!

I have been making this exact brisket for years. At the end of the cooking time still pretty tough.  slice it and put it back in the pan and cook for another hour......usually when ready to serve.
Really good!!!!!!

This was delish, as good as any restaurant I've eaten brisket at, the flavor was on point. I did cut the sugar to about a half cup per other reviews, and it was perfect sweetness. Will definitely be a staple recipe for us. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today.

I also used Better than Bouillon and baked on top of carrots, fat side up, sealed with foil.  Very easy and came out perfectly.  Cooked down cooking juices and it made a super sauce.  In the rotation now.

I couldn't find a tomato based chili sauce so I just used a bottle of BBQ sauce and I was also out of brown sugar so I just left it out. I guess I didn't exactly follow the recipe but it was still delicious! I made it for a crowd and had many compliments. I look forward to making it again following the recipe exactly.

I used less brown sugar than the recipe called for & added more onions (because we love onions!).

Super easy & husband loved it.

Prepared this recipe but made changes as suggested by the reviewers. I used onion soup instead of onions, used  Jack Daniels bbq sauce instead of chile sauce and used less brown sugar. This is my go to brisket recipe. It's delicious and easy to make!!!

Very good flavor.  Like many have said, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of what is called for.  But... wasn't tender and the sauce wasn't thick.  

I'd suggest lowering the cooking temp to 300 instead of 325.  

Not sure what to do about the sauce, though.  It was very thin.  Didn't seem to thicken, at all.  

I'm open to suggestions!  Thanks, all!

As other reviewers have said, reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup....I also reduced the temp to 300 and removed the foil on the last 15 minutes instead of the last 30 minutes. It was juicy and very tender

My first brisket I ever made and I don't eat meat.  I Used BBQ sauce instead of chili sauce and followed the rest of the recipe as written. The whole family loved it and asked me to make it again for the next holiday.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I adjusted to allow for a much larger brisket by using 2 bottles of beer, 1 bottle of Kraft BBQ sauce and about  2/3 cup of brown sugar.  I used garlic powder, onion powder salt and pepper to season the brisket along with a good douse of liquid smoke as another reviewer had suggested.  
We opted to divide the brisket in two large aluminium pans, poured on the liquid mixture, covered with foil  and refrigerated for about 3 hours.  Then since it is so hot in July we turned on the grill very low and rotated the pans from the upper  to lower rack every hour for 4 hours.  
It was wonderful.

Easy and very tasty.  Couldn't find tomato based chili sauce so I used one can of tomatoes with green chil is and 1 can of tomato sauce.  Used almost 1 can of blue ribbon.  Also used less sugar, like 1/2 a cup, but definitely need some.  The only problem was I had a fatty and terrible brisket.  I will try this again with a better piece of meat.

This was a major let down for me.... My brisket was 1.8 lbs, so I made a smaller portion of the sauce to top (cut in half). The meat became tough and hard to bite through. The sauce never thickened and the onions did not look appetizing

Made this exactly as written. Used 2 pieces of brisket, about 2.89 lbs total . Baked in oven using ceramic pot lined with foil for exact times written here. So tender & tasty! Be sure to remove most of the fat from the bottom of brisket before baking

I used a cheap top sirloin. I had a leftover Not your father's root beer that I added to chili sauce along with 1 tsp. minced garlic and my sliced onion. Added all that to slow cooker on high for 4 hours. This recipe I will use again. Very adaptable and great flavors!

Fabulous beef brisket from a girl who loves her Texas barbecue! I feed an army, so I used a 5 pound brisket and added 1 hour to the baking time. Ingredient amounts for sauce were fine, no need to add on.  The barbecue gravy was ridiculous when poured on the chopped/sliced brisket.

I LOVE this beef brisket recipe!!! Super delicious.  My new all-time favorite.  I decreased the brown sugar to half cup and it was just right!   Cooked this for 8 hours in a crock pot and it was absolutely super tender and melt in your mouth delicious.

I made it spicy.  This recipe is awesome but what I did was just take regular chili sauce and then added a drained can of chopped red and green chilies.  I also used a bunch of fresh chopped basil on top of everything before putting the foil on.  Adding the extra chilies took away from the over powering sweetness of the dish.  Really amazing recipe tho.  I served with a vegetable medley.

This was the very first time i have attempted to make Beef Brisket and i wanted to use a recipe that would be simple, easy and delicious. Look no further this was DROP THE MIC GOOD. I created my own dry rub instead of just salt & pepper added Bay leaves and followed the directions for the Chile base sauce with Medelo Dark Beer. I Baked it in the oven on 300 degrees to create a slow cooker result. I would recommend keeping an eye on it if you don't want shredded beef and want to be able to slice it, either way it was great OMG. Family ate the whole pot, with garlic mashed red potatoes and homemade creamed corn.

Following other reviews, I skipped the onions and used an onion soup mix packet. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. When there was still a little over an hour to cook, I had to force myself to let it finish because the smell coming from my kitchen was nothing short of AMAZING! This will definitely be my new go-to BBQ sauce!

I made this recipe exactly and was disappointed in the results.  I thought the sauce would thicken up (like it looks in the photo) and the brisket was a little tough.  It tasted fine but not the 5 star that others have rated it.

So far ive made this twice, first time with bbq sauce instead of the tomatoe based chili sauce that I didn't have atm.  Was an awesome tender brisket but I chucked the sauce and made onion gravy at the end, was just way to sweet.  second time made it exactly as stated,  again extremely tender, but I was really concerned about the sauce wasn't good when I tasted it alone, but surprisingly went really well with the meat.  Love this recipe,  thanks for sharing.

I made this dish a few times now, and it is quite delicious. I didn't have a problem with the sweetness, but that could be because of the modifications I make: I use a can of cola instead of beet, and I also add 2-3 Tbsp of lemon juice to the sauce. And I sprinkle a little bit of Garlic Powder on the brisket beforehand as well, though not too much. But I feel like the acidity of the lemon juice goes well with the hot sauce (I use Sriracha)and sweetness of the brown sugar and cola.

This was a very good brisket. I followed Katy's review and used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce and Rotel. Next time I'll try the real recipe but overall we were pleased with the results.

It was very very good. I followed the recommendations that it might be too sweet and used 1/2 c (or less) of brown sugar. I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic because, why not?! It turned out really yummy. Would like to find another use for the left over sauce though.

I consider myself a professional chef but had never fixed a beef brisket before.  I have to give this recipe ten stars for flavor.  The house smelled amazing as guests sat around and snacked on our appetizers - the anticipation was very high and this baby didn't disappoint!  Thanks so much for a wonderful and hearty recipe!  I did reduce the brown sugar by 1/4 cup as reviewers suggested but I did everything else by the book.  Yum, yum, yum!

This is an awesome recipe! The only thing I did differently was I put a dry rub on the meat and let it sit for a while. I only did this because I hadn't found this recipe yet. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Make sure you wrap the meat tightly in foil; don't cook in a dutch oven. When the meat is cooked, let it sit for about 10 minutes, spooning the sauce over the meat and onions; slice very thin, against the grain. I will make this again and again.

I originally rated this 4 stars, but upgraded to 4 after eating the leftovers in sandwiches. The leftovers were incredibly delicious simply heated and heaped onto potato rolls. 

I originally said that the sauce was delicious although a bit soupy. The meat itself was disappointing. It was tender but it tasted as if the flavor had been boiled out of it. I wanted it to be tender and juicy, but it was "dry" flavorless meat in a soupy sauce.


I cooked it on 300 since my oven runs hot. After 3 hours it was still very firm. It was 4 lbs so I figured it needed more time. After another hour it was tender. I took it out and let it sit for about 30 minutes before serving. 


I think the brisket I am looking for is cooked with the fat and is moist and tender. I'll keep looking for that recipe. 

In the meantime, this recipe is a keeper for sandwiches. I think it would probably work well in a crockpot for that purpose with a bit less juice.

I loved this recipe. Quick and easy to prepare. The only difference I did, was cut the brown sugar to a 1/2 cup as CAPPPAO recommended. It tasted just right for us. Also, cutting 3/4 of the fat off helps the marinade/BBQ sauce cook into the meat for more flavor and it still comes out tender. Will use this recipe again and again.

I'm on board with this being the easiest AND best of all brisket recipes and methods I've ever tried.  Super moist.  I'm convinced it's the beer.  I made it with a variation, also.  I used "Gotcha!" barbeque sauce instead of chili sauce and reduced the brown sugar to a couple of tablespoons.  Marinated for about 3 hours before popping in the oven.  Awesome.  This is the recipe to make for company.  Easy peasy!  Yum-yum!

This is delicious and so easy. I bought a three lb.  brisket already trimmed from Kroger. This was my first time to cook brisket. I used Bud Light Beer, Heinz chili sauce and half the brown sugar called for as others had suggested. Also sprinkled meat tenderizer on top and cooked wrapped in foil. Cleanup was a breeze. My husband loved this. Thought he was going to shoot me when I kidded and said I lost the recipe.

I made it. I didn't decide the recipe until I got home with the meat, so I had to change as follows: barbecue sauce rather than chili sauce.  I had everything else.  It certainly was easier than marinating overnight and came out great.  I have never been successful with brisket and have been trying for years.  This was the first time I achieved a good result.

So easy, so good!  My fussy-eater daughter only half listening to us at the table heard my husband say something about brisket and, between shoveling forkfuls in her mouth, said, "I don't like brisket." She couldn't believe it when I explained to her that was what she was eating. Lol!

Great without the brown sugar. Use 1 bottle of chili sauce (in the ketchup section of the store), one medium onion sliced into rings, salt and pepper to taste. Use about 4 ounces of liquid smoke. Wrap tightly in heavy duty foil. Bake in oven until tender. It tastes like it was cooked outside on the barbeque pit all day, even in the freezing winter. Marinate 1 1/2 to 12 hrs.in large ziplock bag  My mom used to make it this way when I was a kid.

This is absolutely delicious, tasty and tender. My husband brought a brisket home yesterday and when searching I came across this recipe. I did not have the chili hot sauce so I used Louisiana Hot Wing sauce. I also changed the quantity a little bit - I used about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 4oz of the Hot Wing sauce and Dark Lager Beer. I cooked it per instructions, except after the 30 minutes I let the meat rest, cut and served it, without putting it back in the oven after cutting. Tomorrow we are going to eat the rest of the meat with Almond flour polenta. Thank you for this great recipe.

Very Good!  My son, who has been requesting to have brisket for the longest time, loved it.  This is was my first time doing brisket and it turned out great.  Loved the sauce!  I would have given it 5 stars but it was just a little dry.

This recipe produced a really tender brisket that my family couldn't get enough of.  The only thing I would do differently is cook it in a bigger casserole dish because it boiled over in my oven which is surprising because the liquid was only half full in my dish. I used Guinness beer.

My family has had brisket for years using the same old recipe but we all liked it. I tried this recipe out at a large family gathering. Everyone LOVED it and thought it was by far, the best anyone had ever had. And it is really very easy to make.

I took a viewer's advice to add liquid smoke to the beer (lager)and marinate the brisket overnight.  I puncture several holes into the meat and poured the beer mixture.  I too followed the rest of the recipe, but I cooked it in a slow cooker on high for several hours.  This is the first time I cooked a brisket and loved EVERY bite.  My husband tasted a sample of it and said it was delicious :)  I will be making this recipe for now on.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Made for Passover dinner last night and will be making it again! Husband and kids loved it! I followed some suggestions, I only added 1/2 cup of sugar, and added a package of onion soup mix.  I had a 4 1/2 lb brisket, and didn't add any extra ingredients, and cooked as directed. Next time I might only add 3/4 can of chilis as I thought it had just alittle too much kick....but OMG, tender and delish.... a keeper recipe!!!

Love it! It was so easy, and tasted wonderful. I had NO leftovers at all. I followed the recipe exactly and we did not find it sweet at all, but the brown sugar did cut the chili sauce enough that it was tangy instead of hot. Instead of covering it with foil, I wrapped it in foil, so even the clean up was super easy. Definitely my new favorite way to cook a brisket!

i added a little bit of garlic salt to the salt and pepper rub, added a little bit of minced garlic to the beer, chili sauce and used about half a cup of brown sugar. I made it yesterday for dinner tonight, my daughter was hiding in the other room to wait for me to leave the brisket unattended so she could sneak bites. I have never made brisket before and have to say this was the EASIEST recipe ( just like the title says). will make this again and again!

This is by far the BEST beef brisket recipe EVER.  Do not change a thing - and make sure and bake in a glass dish (a large one at that to hold liquids) Slice and put in dish and turn over after 15 min.

I had never cooked beef brisket before and was looking for a simple recipe.  I had a dinner party and tripled the recipe along with using Heineken beer.  It was the hit of the party with requests to make it again.  Very pleased!!!

Wow - this was really awesome! My husband is a really picky eater and he loved it - even went back for seconds! I used Guinness - made it a bit richer I think. Love, love!

I made this recipe with 1/2 c of brown sugar as another user reviewed.  I also omitted the 30 min cook time uncovered after I discovered the first time around it seemed to dry out the meat.  Also, I reccomend serving the meat in the drippings after it is sliced because it dried out quickly

First words out of my husband's mouth, "THIS is a keeper recipe!"   I followed the recipe exactly except while the meat was resting, I separated the grease off the sauce and thickened it slightly with Wondra flour. Absolutely delicious!!

ok seriously. easy brisket. i grew up in the hill country in texas, and i am paticular about brisket. my pops used to make this for me all the time when my friends and i would go down to the guadalupe river all day, and be starving upon our return. simple. take your brisket (untrimmed), put it in a baking bag, fat side up, with a small bottle of your favorite italian vinaigrette. bake it at 325 or so for about three or four hours, depending on the size. it will be falling apart when it's ready. great with bbq sauce, as tacos, add it to eggs for breakfast, whatever you like. add any extra flavor you like on top of it before cooking, spice rubs, garlic cloves, onions... but you don't need to. if you don't find this delicious, you're doing something wrong!

This is SUPER good!  I didn't have jarred chili sauce, so I used a recipe from this site.  Used splenda brown sugar where both called for sugar.  Will make again!

This was a big hit with my family! I cut up half a bell pepper with the onions (just cause I had one that I needed to use), and added 1 TBSP of minced garlic to the liquid. As far as brands go, I used Kroger brand chili sauce and Amber Bock beer. I think I will try this same recipe the next time I do a Pork roast.

I would give this four stars because of how fast and the overall ease with which it can be thrown together.  I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce as well.  Only change was using a half cup of brown sugar rather than three quarters cup.  Next time I would roast the brisket more "low and slow".

My family loved this.  I have never made brisket before, but we have had it at BBQ restaurants.  I didn't make as much as the recipe called for, but I wish I had!  I made only 1/2 recipe for a family of 4 and they were begging for more.  I bet it would make great leftovers.

I made this tonight and it was really pretty good!  I took the advice of others and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and also reduced the heat to 300 adding another 30 min before uncovering.  The flavor was awesome, the meat a little dry (maybe because of my adding time for the lower temp?).  I think it might be improved by removing the sauce at the last minute and broiling a bit to crunch up the outside.  The sauce could be thickened, too, if you like.  Overall, I gave it 4 stars...it was good, but not incredible. I still may make it again though!

This was a good easy marinade. I did add about a tbs of white wine vinegar to tenderizer the meat like others suggested

It's true.  This IS the easiest brisket recipe!  The flavors were wonderful - not too sweet or spicy!  The meat was tender, but didn't shred under the knife.  I listened to grandma and put half of the onion under the brisket, and browned the meat before baking.  I'll make this recipe again and again!

I love this recipe. I put everything together about 10:00am and let it marinade in the fridge. I take it out and let it sit about 1 hour before I cook it.  It tastes great the next day also.

This was so easy to make and the meat came out to tender and delicious.  I cut up potatoes and put them in as well and it made an extra side dish.  I put in a bit less sugar as everyone suggested and that worked out well.  I still wish that it had a little extra kick to the taste so if anyone has any good suggestions please let me know!
