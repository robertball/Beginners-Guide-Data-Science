I am a vegan but I got inspired. I made lime flavored quinoa, roasted the veggies and added basil and mushrooms and later added marinated tofu. I could have used the marinade listed here but I used a bottled dressing. Good flavors in this recipe!

I thought this recipe was DELICIOUS!! I made some slight modifications though: instead of a chili pepper, I added a milder Anaheim pepper, and I used 2 limes instead of the recommended 3. It came out a little too sour still, so I think I am going to use only 1 lime next time. I also used Isreali couscous instead, mainly because it was the ony thing I had. My father-in-law (who we live with) cannot handle spicy food very well, and even he found the substitution of the Anaheim in good taste. The only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the nutrition/calorie content. I didn't look at the nutrition facts until after I made/ate it, otherwise I probably wouldn't have made it.

I read this and thought it would be awesome but I was a little disappointed.  The lamb marinade was awesome, but the roasted veggies did not work.  It seemed as if the eggplant was not quite done, whether that was the size of the chunks I cut it in, or the times, I'm not sure.  I think for the veggies, they either need  an increased cooking temp or time, plus they were a little bland, perhaps a mix of some herbs and a touch of salt & pepper on them as well.    Overall I think that it has alot of promise, it just needs a little tweaking.

This dish was okay.  It feels like it is missing something.  I did add the yogurt to make a bit of a sauce.  Not sure what else it needs - seasoning, crunch factor, something.  The marinade for the lamb was good.  The putting the dish together needs something more.  Maybe a topping that adds some texture?  I'm going to try and tweak it the next time around.

I added yogurt to the marinade for the lamb, it gave it some more flavour and a bit of sauce to the lamb and couscous.... also i served a tahini sauce to be added to the dish if desired.

I liberally seasoned the vegetables with cumin, rosemary,thyme, and garlic salt.
