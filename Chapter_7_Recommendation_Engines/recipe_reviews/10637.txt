I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand the first time I made these biscotti, and now that I've made about 30 batches for everyone I know this way, I don't think I'll ever use the original recipe.  I substituted 1/4 tsp lemon extract for the orange zest, added more white chocolate chips, and about 1/2 a cup toasted almonds instead of pistachios.  I top the biscotti logs before I bake them with egg white or milk, and sprinkle with granulated sugar and chopped almonds.  They look and taste better than store bought.

These were wonderful.  Only criticism I have was that the two three-inch logs make a small number of somewhat clunky biscotti.  Next time I'll bake them in three two-inch logs instead, to yield a larger number of smaller cookies.

I apologize for my skepticism, these are amazing! My Italian grandma was the all-time world champion biscotti maker. But these are the best modern twist on Grandma's biscotti that I can imagine! They are VERY easy to make (used Kitchen Aid mixer), wonderfully flavored, excellent texture, smell divine! Used 1/2 tsp orange extract in place of the zest; had only 1/2 C pistachios, so I added slivered almonds too. These will be a PERMANENT addition to my files!

Excellent biscotti!  I have never made biscotti before but was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy the recipe was.  Not only are these better than store-bought ones (which always tend to be a little harder than I like), they're also a lot cheaper too!  This is an absolutely delightful snack that I will keep as a staple in my kitchen.  The only difficulty I encounter was cutting the log since the center part tend to crumble & break (even with a very sharp knife);  I also went ahead & spread some melted chocolate on the flat side of the biscotti to give it more of a flavor.  These are definitely keepers!

This is an oustanding recipe - directions are very clear and precise, and the result is a crunchy, flavorful cookie that goes well with coffee as well as hot tea (am thinking of having it with some peach herbal tea).  Some notes:
Unlike other biscotti recipes I've made, this dough did not have a tendency to crack in the oven or crumble when slicing (I always use a serrated knife) - a big reason why this will become a staple baked good for our house.  Substitutions: splenda for white sugar, and used orange-essence cranberries to pick up the flavor of the zest.  Also, suggested baking time was a bit long for my oven - did 27 minutes for first bake, and only 10 for second.

Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!

I made both the Spring Biscotti and the Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti from this site.  I was worried about using olive oil instead of butter.  To make a direct comparison I used the same amount of craisins (3/4 cup) and pistachios (3/4 cup) in each recipe.  I also eliminated any flavorings other than almond and vanilla (ie: omitted orange flavoring).  Honestly there was little difference between the oil and the butter.  The Spring Biscotti with the butter was a little crunchier and a little easier to work with/cut.  The Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti with the oil stuck to the parchment paper a little and was a little more delicate to cut without crumbling.  However, the end result was a little softer than the spring biscotti.  Either recipe is 5 star.  I can't decide which one I will make again as they were so similar but I don't think I can go wrong!

I just can't believe how good these biscotti turned out.  The orange zest added SO MUCH to them, I can't imagine making them without it.  I made one batch as-is: FANTASTIC.

I made another batch using toasted coconut, white chocolate, and slivered almonds as the "fillings," and they, too, were out of this world.

I think that the base of this biscotti recipe is a great base for a multitude of variations, and I can't wait to experiment more.

Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

Love this combination. Added drizzled white chocolate for gift biscotti. Found that an electric knife cuts the half-baked biscotti like butter, eliminating all crumbling. Baked mine a bit longer as I like "dunkers."

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...yummy.  These biscotti are absolutely fantabulous!  I used almond extract instead of the vanilla and didn't put any nuts but they were still divine!  And so easy to make!  Excellent recipe!

This was a terrific recipe!  I shared these with friends and they all raved about how delicious they were and the fact that they were crispy, but a little softer inside (unlike typical biscotti).  The orange zest adds a wonderful, fresh flavor which goes so well with the crunchy nuts and chewy/tangy craisins.  I couldn't find shelled pistachios, so I rough chopped 1 c of whole almonds instead.  I think I actually prefer the almonds to pistachios anyways.  I will definitely be making these again!

I recently made these for my children's Communion party as "something different" from the traditional cookies.  I had people fighting over them!  My Aunt was almost in tears saying that her Mom used to make biscotti just like these.  Thank you so much for this recipe and I will surely make these again and again.

This turned out absolutely perfect.  I omitted the white chocolate since I don't prefer it, substituted sliced almonds for the pistachios, and dipped the flat sides in semi-sweet chocolate.  They were very well received by my husband and co-workers.  Excellent recipe.  This was also my first time making biscotti, and it was much easier than I had anticipated.

Wonderful recipe! I followed almost exactly, just substituting dried cherries and almonds for the fruit and nut called for in the recipe. I baked for about 27 minutes the first time, then about 8 the second time...so they were ever-so-slightly softer (less dry) than your typical biscotti. I melted some white chocolate and some almond bark and dipped one side of them, yum! I found the size to be just fine as specified, if you cut at an angle. I also did closer to 1/2-3/4" thick, instead of 1" (personal preference). Easy recipe--first time making biscotti and it was great!

This was my first time making biscotti.  I've always been intimidated by them, but this recipe is amazing - and they're really not that hard to make.  I used: pecans, dried sweetened cranberries and white and chocolate chips along with the orange zest in the cookies, and drizzled them with chocolate when they were done.  They came out amazing, so much so that everyone who tried them thought they were bought and not homemade!  I'll use this recipe as a base for all my biscotti from now on!

Amazing! !   I substituted the pistachios for pecans only because I didn’t have any. And I love Pecans.  I also added about 3 Tablespoons of Skor bits (crisp butter toffee) and I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and made 3.5” logs that were about 6” long. Each log made about 8 pieces so the recipe yielded 24 pieces total and then the end pieces that I just had to eat while the rest of the batch was cooking for the second time..  When they come out of the oven and are all cooled Ill drizzle the top with white chocolate…   nice little 3 bite Biscotti

My biscotti turned out great -- I am eating some now as I type. Thanks very much for this one!  I did not add the egg white, and also used dark chocolate instead of white chocolate. I added some nutmeg to the dough, and left out the pistachios because I'm terrible at following recipes exactly :)

This recipe did not impress me.  I have made better cranberry orange biscotti.  It tastes a little bit like custard to me and I'm not a fan of custard. Just a word of caution:  I made a double batch and switched top shelf and bottom shelf in the middle of baking the first round.  My cookie sheet did not have edges and one of my loaves spilled off onto the oven door and floor. :(

This was really good.  I used almonds instead of pistachios and I didn't put the white chocolate on (I'm not a fan of white chocolate).  Great biscotti, this was my first time making it and I'll make it again.

Three words: Ah. May. Zing. These were pitch-perfect in every possible way! I made them without the nuts, since it was for a shower, and many can't eat them. I had made a cookie bar with 17 varieties for the guests to take home as favors. The absolute only kind that went completely was the biscotti! I painted the flat side with melted white chocolate, and for presentation, stood them on end in a tall crystal vase. Perfectly crunchy with a fresh, clean taste. My nonno and nonna would have loved these with their afternoon espresso. Phenomenal!

A friend made this recipe for New Years brunch and they were AMAZING!! I don't particularly care for biscotti but these have made me a convert.  This is the recipe she followed exactly except she did top them with melted white chocolate.  DELISH!!

Excellent recipe. I have replaced pistachios with almonds. I like to cut the log in thinner pieces and I reduce the drying time in the oven to only about 8 minutes. Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I made a couple of changes - I shaped the dough into one log that was the length of the cookie sheet, instead of 2.  Also the idea of cutting the log with an electric knife was very helpful - it cut through the log like butter with hardly any crumbs - just let the log cool just about completely before cutting.  I also dried them out a little more, about 15 minutes on one side, and then another 10 on the other side.  I also used chocolate chips instead of white chocolate because I didn't have any.  I think next time I will make them with almonds and cranberries and no chocolate, and then dip the bottoms in chocolate.  Very good recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

These are delicious!  At first I thought the amount of butter was way too little, but after chilling, you end up with a wonderful (not sticky at all) dough.  This is a great combination of flavors.  I think I'll use this recipe as my basic biscotti recipe and begin experimenting with other flavors.

Delicious!! This was my first time making biscotti and found the recipe very easy to follow.  I stuck to the recipe other than substituting chopped almonds for the pistachios...I can't wait to serve them at my event this weekend!!!  Thank you so much!

While this is a pretty simple recipe and it turned out great, I really did not like the taste. I typically like orange and cranberries together but for some reason it just didn't work for me in this recipe. I may try it again without the orange zest.

These are dangerous!  I've never been impressed with any biscotti until I encountered this recipe.  This is by far the most addicting baked good out of everything I have ever made.  The only change I made was to add a little cinnamon and bake them for an extra 10 minutes at 200F to get them crunchy.  The flavors are amazing!  I was shocked whe my hubby, who hates anything with chunks, granted that these were good.

..good biscotti recipe.  I usually bake chocolate walnut so this was a nice change of pace.. I LOVED the aroma of the orange zest that was evident when whipping up the butter and sugar so I had to add more.  The only advice I have is to be sure to chop the pistachios and cranberries and don't forget to refrigerate the dough.  As others stated the dough was sticky but I was able to shape it by spooning it onto the parchment and wetting my fingers to shape..Didn't crack or crumble when cutting.  Also be sure to watch the final bake as 15 mins would have been too long for my oven.  Topped mine with a drizzle of white chocolate.  Very pretty.

As usual, I didn't have all the ingredients - so I omitted the white chocolate, added chopped dried apricots and chopped pecans. It was outstanding! Next time I will buy the ingredients for the original. Great light dessert, served with coffee, after a good meal!

Just superb!  I made these with macadamia nuts instead of pistachios, and they are too good!  Perfect with a cup of tea.  I’m not sure I like the orange flavor with coffee as much.  Also, a very impressive looking cookie to give as a gift.

This is one of the best biscotti recipes I have ever made. The orange zest really adds that springtime flavor. I love the texture and how all the flavors combine. The only downfall was that I had to add 3/4 cup more flour because my dough was very sticky. Other then that, it was perfect! A+++++

DO NOT USE MARGARINE!!! I tried using margarine and splenda for the first batch and it curdled right away. The end reselt wasn't too terrible but it cracked and didn't hold together well. I made another batch with butter and sugar and I immediately saw a difference. It was smooth and wonderful! By the way, I used fresh orange zest, lemon extract, and vanilla. Very tasty!

Delicious recipe!! The only change I made was that I melted the white chocolate & drizzled it over the biscotti after they cooled instead of adding it to the dough.  Definitely a keeper!!!

YUMMY! JUST HAD TO GLUTTON THIS UP A BIT. I COULD
NOT LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE! I SUB'D DRIED CHERRIES FOR THE CRANBERRIES, THEN SOAKED THEM
IN 6 TBLS. OF GRAN MARNIER. I ALSO INCREASED THE
AMOUNT OF CHERRIES TO 1 CUP INSTEAD OF 1/2.
WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY HAPPIER! DEFINITELY
"GODDESS APPROVED"! XOXOXOXOX

I thought that I didn't like biscotti, having had a piece of store bought biscotti years ago, that I didn't care for.  I made this recipe for a friend on mine who loves biscotti.  Before giving it to her for her birthday, I tried a bite, and another, and another, and before I knew it, I had eaten two entire pieces. This stuff is so good.  And it wasn't difficult at all to make.  The dough came together beautifully; although, I did not add the white chocolate into the batter.  I refrigerated for about 30 minutes, and the dough was ready for shaping on the sheet.  The baking process went smoothly, and after the biscotti cooled, I drizzled the tops with melted white chocolate.  My friend loved hers dipped in coffee, and I loved mine dipped in tea.  Either way, this biscotti is beautiful and delicious.

This was a big hit with all my coffee loving friends for Christmas.  I think I made about 6 batches for gifts and they were loved by all. I didn't change a thing!  I was able to find pistachios in the produce department (already shelled), which was a huge help.  I added a few more white choc. chips and the full amount of cranberries.  VERY GOOD!  Thank you!

I made two batches of this today.  It is wonderfully good!!  :)  It's going to friends and family for the holidays.  The first batch I made as per the recipe.  You HAVE to try this!  It's amazing!  For the second batch I made the basic recipe, adding only chopped almonds and almond flavoring (1/4 teaspoon)  Then drizzled with white and dark chocolate.  These make a beautiful presentation together.

Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe...it's going into my permanent book, the one that is going to be passed down to my son (who loves to cook)!  :)

Turned out great! The recipe is really flexible and I could sub all kinds of ingredients. After my initial test batch, I immediately made 4 more batches of various flavors over the next two days and served them at a 50th wedding anniversary along side the coffee. The caterer even asked me for the recipe!

AMAZING! I brought this to work and several people said "they weren't a fan" of biscotti, but tried it anyways (probably because they felt obligated). Even people that aren't a fan ended up having seconds! They started as skeptics but ended up asking for the recipe! 

I also substituted almonds for pistachios, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and left the rest the same.

Wonderful!

These were the best biscotti I have experienced.  Not having made biscotti before, I am giving this a 5-star rating based on biscotti been purchased in posh coffee shops and bakeries.  I did not have pistachios, so I substituted slivered almonds.  I am giving these away as gifts to my family and friends.

These are delicious! The orange rind really adds so much wonderful flavor, so don't omit it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used pecans instead of pistachios, and didn't add quite as much as the recipe called for. Great recipe, very easy to make even for someone like me (a non-baker), and plus this is the first time I made biscotti. Thank you Elizabeth!

I finally am getting around to ratin this recipe even thought I've made it at least 6 times now.  This has become a staple for me to take home when I visit family.  They love it and request it every trip.  I have made just as written and I have used dried cherries in place of the cranberries.  I like the dried cherries better but both are good.  I have had a little trouble with the dough being a little wet.  I ususally add a little more flour and shape the loafs right on the baking sheet to help with the wetness of the dough.  Thanks for a great recipe and a keeper in my book.

I tried this recipe last year as a Christmas gift for my friends and family - and already I've been asked by many of them if they are going to get it again this year!  The only thing I did different was to dip the bottom in melted white chocolate - and it was definitely a hit!

These should be called ANYTIME biscotti, not Spring biscotti!  I made them EXACTLY as the recipe states -- my first experience with biscotti -- and even my food snob Italian hubby liked them!  So much so that I'll have to make more for the gift baskets we give every year.  The biscottis have a nice fresh flavor -- you can taste the orange and cranberry nicely and the pistachio gives it a nice nutty crunch on top of the crunchines of the biscotti.  I have nothing but good things to say about this one.  If you like cranberry nut bread, you'll be over the moon about this one!

This recipe is really delicious!  It's similar to the 'Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti' recipe on this website (which is also fantastic!).  I added some orange extract and doubled the vanilla extract.  One thing I noticed is that I should probably reduce the oven temperature for the second bake so the biscotti don't get too brown.  Maybe it was just me.  I think I'll reduce the oven temp to 275-300 degrees so that the biscotti can get hard without browning too much.  As another reviewer had suggested, an electric knife cuts through these biscotti like butter.  It worked perfectly!  These biscotti stay fresh for at least a week if you keep them in a tighly closed container.

Very good and very easy.  I did not have the pistacchios (sp?).  All I had was walnuts.  Ha!  They actually tasted very, very good.  I also drizzled white chocolate over them to give them some pizzaz!  I used wax paper and made sure to spray it with some Pam before baking.

This was wonderful!  It made the whole house smell good I wanted to eat the batter before I could bake it!  I dipped one side in melted white chocolate and gave it as presents.  I've already had 5 requests for the recipe.  Thank you so much!

This biscotti is amazing!  I forgot the egg white, but it still turned out great.  The only other change (which was intentional) was the use of almonds instead of pistachios.  I tried several recipes, but this is definitely a keeper!

Fabulous - so delish!  I used less pistachios, more cranberries and more white choc. (used white choc. chips).  Also, I chopped the pistachios.  Very, very good!  Will make again.

I've tried several other biscotti recipes recently, and this one was by far the best!! The combination of pistachios, cranberries, and white chocolate is perfect - even better when dipped in melted dark chocolate. And the dough is very easy to work with - doesn't crack or dry out like other recipes I've tried. I made these for several people as gifts, and everyone gave them rave reviews. Definitely making again!!!

I posted this recipe almost 5 years ago.  I am so glad so many people have tried it.  One thing you can tell from the reviews is this recipe is infinately changable.  Use what you have, why go to the store.  I am going to make a batch right now, with almonds cause that's what I got.

This was awesome.  The orange peel adds a great burst of flavor to the recipe.  I added dried cherries instead of cranberries, and omitted the pistachio nuts.  I also drizzled melted white chocolate on top.  THE BEST!!  I did need to refrigerate longer than 30 minutes in order to handle it though.

Outstanding Biscotti recipe, Elizabeth. The taste is great and the texture is perfect. They're not so hard they'll break your teeth, but not so soft that they leave crumbs everywhere. I added 1 teaspoon orange extract in addition to the zest. The orange together with the white chocolate flavor just blows those tastebuds away! Thanks.

This recipe was great.  My fiancee made a double batch to take to work for the holidays.  We drizzled them with white chocolate and arranged them on a tray.  Needless to say, they didn't last through his shift!

Great recipe.  My mother expected not to like it and she's eaten about half the batch by herself.  The orange, pistacios, cranberries, and white chocolate work great together.

This is hands down the best biscotti ever.  I had tried it with many different add-ins, extracts, different peel, etc. as well as a bit of cocoa to make it chocolate.  I always double the recipe because it never lasts longer than a day in my house without disappearing!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I have had real Italian biscotti that couldn't compare to this.

I had my doubts about this because I've used an old Italian biscotti recipe for the business that I own, no other recipes were anywhere near as delicious.....but this one was fantastic!  I will need to change a few minor things, but as written it makes a mighty tasty biscotti with a great texture!  many thanks!

Just incredible! The only change I made was to use dried cherries that needed using up, the biscotti is the perfect texture and looks so pretty. I made a double batch for a teacher supper on conference day, and a couple of the teachers tracked down which parent made the biscotti and asked for the recipe!

I just finished making these biscotti---my kitchen smells divine!  If people knew how easy it is to make them you would never by a packaged kind. I did make some changes though as I always tweak something a bit. I added 1/2 tsp almond extract in addition to the vanilla, which I increased to 1 full teaspoon. Also, I added 4oz white chocolate and reduced the pistachios to one cup.  Shelled pistachios are not that hard to find---if you live near a Trader Joe's they have them.  This is a truly delicious biscotti and not hard to make, just have a sharp knife and cut straight down so you can minimize them crumbling on you.

Very tasty- this is why I don't bake too often, cause these are very tempting.  Husband loved them but actually liked them better before I twice baked them.  He liked it more like a cookie.  You might want to try keeping some of them this way to see which way your family likes them better.  Mine were a little crumbly and some of them broke but those  were the taste testers :)  I also put some white chocolate chips on one side as soon as they came out of the oven, which melted them and then you can spread for a thin frosting.

This recipe was very good and very adaptable. Instead of pistachios, I used toasted whole almonds and instead of cranberries, I used chopped dried apricots.  I kept the orange zest in, and they are lovely.  I did not need to out the dough in the fridge before shaping the logs, but I did lightly dust the dough with some flour.  I put them straight into the oven from there.  They did take longer to toast than specified, but ovens can vary.  I will be making these again!

Wow.  So good.  I'm a much better cook than baker, and these still turned out fabulous - I felt very old-school grandma making these.  I kept the recipe the same except I used fresh, chopped cranberries, dark chocolate, and walnuts (that's all I had around so I had to improvise).  It was a yummy combo.  Next time I might spread some melted chocolate on the bottom of the cookies to harden, or drizzle it on top.  Amazing dunked in coffee.  This is such a great base recipe, just like others said, and really easy to modify to your tastes.  I'm definitely making a few batches to spread the love this Thanksgiving.  Thanks for a great recipe, Elizabeth!

This was my first batch of homemade biscotti and this recipe hit it out of the park!  It's taking all my will-power not to scarf down the entire batch.  A few notes: I used slivered almonds instead of pistachios (already had them and they are cheaper) and I doubled the amount of orange zest.  Also, despite putting the dough in the fridge for over an hour it was still really sticky in the center and underside.  Next time I won't even waste my time with this step and will just form the logs directly on the lined cookie sheet.

All in all, superb recipe!

Only used 2 eggs. Did not put in pistachios.  I did put in a bit of lemon extract.  If the dough is sticky, just add a bit more flour.  More flour can't hurt it!

This is by far the best biscotti I have ever had.  It is so delicious and I love the combination of the fruit and nuts.  I also dipped one end in white chocolate and sprinkled that with red and green sugar sprinkles.  So beautiful and festive for the holidays!!

I make these with the white chocolate chips in the biscotti, and also with melted white chocolate drizzled over them. These biscotti get raves every time.

very good biscotti!  i didn't have any oranges, so i used lemon zest (i tripled the amount of zest).  i also left out the white chocolate and dipped the finished biscotti in melted white chocolate.  i replaced the pistachios with pecans.  i put the dough in a 9x13 pan because i didn't want to mess with shaping it. i love it!!

I liked the texture of these....not tooth breaking however I felt it was lacking a bit in flavor.  next time I make it (and I will make it again)  I will use more orange zest and probably chopped apricots as I think the cranberies lacked flavor.  I think I might try almond extract too.  Very good recipe all in all.  Easy to make.  The pampered chef pastry roller made shaping the dough a snap!

MMMMM!  I used dried cranberries and almonds instead of pistachios. I also used half a package of white chocolate chips instead of shaved chocolate.  These are really good, with or without coffee or tea!

Amazing Biscotti!  I did change the recipe slightly:  I used Splenda instead of sugar, added a cup of unsalted and chopped almonds instead of pistachios, and just used 2tsp of vanilla instead of orange extract.
Also, I used some leftover white cholocate to dip the bottoms of the biscotti, which gave it a real gourmet touch!
Everyone loved these, and they were remarkably easy to make!

This is the best biscotti recipe I have! I've gotten nothing but RAVE reviews from everyone who has tasted these. I have not used the orange zest any time I've made them (not a huge cranberry-orange fan) and they still come out amazingly! My hints: let the dough chill for a little longer; don't handle it too much when forming it; in the second baking, I bake for 8 minutes then flip them and bake for 8 more and they're perfect every time!

Very good! I used dried cherries instead of cranberries and they came out wonderful. I also added a little more orange zest than the recipe required because I really like the brightness it adds to the flavor.  Will definitely be making again ... and again.

This was my first time making biscotti - and it was wonderful!  I omitted the cranberries, pistachios and white chocolate and sub'd 1/2 c. chopped walnuts and 1 c. mini chocolate chips (all I had).  I doubled this recipe with absolutely no problem.  For the second bake, I cooked them for 7 minutes per side and they were perfect. Easy to slice thin with a serrated bread kinfe!

Impress your friends with this cookie.  It looks just like store bought.  I made a little gift basket.  Stick some coffee beans and mug with the Biscotti and you have a wonderful (and inexpensive) gift.

These are great!  I must say, I totally didn't see the part about refrigerating the dough.  I just smoothed it out with a spatula on my cookie sheet(I used a sil-pat).  I also did not have any orange or pistachios.  But, they still tasted yummy!

This was very good, I had never made biscotti before so I was a bit nervous about preparation, this recipe is pretty easy.  I enlisted the help of my husband and his brother to help shell the nuts, that was a bit time consuming but that is really the only downfall to this recipe.  The cookies end up very pretty, the colors look great and the flavor is excellent-not too sweet.  Thanks for sharing!

I made another biscotti recipe on this site but didn't really like the results, which is when I decided to try this recipe instead. LOVED IT!
It's slightly sweet and has better flavor, I guess due to the butter. I didn't have pistachio, so I used ~2oz worth if leftover chopped pecans. The dough was EXTREMELY sticky in the bowl and I hard the hardest time scooping it out. Even after refrigeration for 30 minutes, the dough didn't come together much like the recipe promised, and was still un-workable. I resisted the urge to add more flour (like with the other recipe) and instead used my rubber spatula to mold & fold everything together. I also didn't divide the dough due to the stickiness, just pat the whole thing into a 12x4" log. Baked for 32 minutes initially, lowered temp to 300*F, and dried the slices of biscotti for an additional 28 minutes. I dipped them in melted chocolate. The result was delicious! I think I'll bake giant batches of these as a snack & gift giving from now on!!! So many possibilities!!

It crumbled apart a little, AND i even spaced them thicker.  They were so good though, i kept eating them throughout the day, and husband disappointed when gone in the AM! im wondering why it wasnt crunchy, enough quite............... and why it crumbled............ half of them were well, i'd just say though they were a little bit like a muffin consistency just a bit but i think the next day they hardened up a bit. I'm giving 5 stars even though!

I made the Biscotti Toscani recipe a few days ago and then this one tonight, and I most definitely prefer the other recipe. While this one is alright, I found the logs difficult to slice after the first bake.. Maybe it was because of all the chunks of dried fruit and nuts.. Who knows. I like the idea of the flavours in this recipe (I used lemon in place of orange, and cherries in place of the cranberries), but will definitely go back to the Biscotti Toscani recipe as opposed to this one, and use it as the base, varying the fruits and nuts. Also, I didn't like that you had to chill the dough for a half hour.

Wow!! these are AMAZING!! this is the first time my biscotti did not crumble apart when i was slicing them! The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were awsome and since then I usually just use whatever I have on hand... They come out perfect every time!! The white chocolate is really esential because it makes them the perfect amount of sweetness! I can go on and on about these because they are just PERFECT!!!!

superb! Changed only a few add-ons. Sub'd a couple of chopped chunks of chocolate, chopped & toasted almonds for the white choc & pistachio nuts. Didn't use cranberries. Baked for nearly 25 vs. 15 minutes to get them nicely crispy. BTW, they will crisp after cooling so just look for a light brown edge which will make it perfect for coffee dunking.

Excellent recipe!  My first attempt at making biscotti.  They came out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the nuts.  I used almonds instead of pistaschios.  (Couldn't find shelled pistaschios). You can't go wrong with this one.  Thank you!

These are AMAZING! Decided to try these to give as gifts for the holidays. Didn't use cranberries or pistachios, but instead used chopped almonds and coconut. I also used extra orange zest and the juice of one orange. As almost everyone receiving them is a tea drinker, these will be PERFECT!!

I made these, following the recipe to a T. The only difference I did was I made the dough into 3 batches instead of 2. Delicious! I would make this again and again, I had no issues with crumbs.

A fave, very similar to my recipe. Mine calls for currants rather than cranberries and it is fabulous. So delicious, always asked for and devoured! After the initial bake time, I bake them for 15 mins, on their sides, flip them and bake them again. They have to be crunchy!

I substituted the nuts with a 1/3 cup golden raisings  and omitted the chocolate drizzle.  I like more orange in my morning pastries, so I used 2T of orange zest, and a little lemon zest.  The biscottis came out great, although it was a little sticky.  I just divided the dough in half directly on the parchment paper and used my fingers to spread it into the log pieces. Definitely a keeper and I will make again and again!

I couldn't even wait for these to come out of the oven to write this review! Awesome! (I started munching the ends when slicing. So good they almost didn't make it back in the oven!) I agree that the dough was sticky, but not as bad as some I've worked with, and a lumpy loaf still bakes up pretty.

This recipe was fabulous. I substituted pecans for the pistachios. These didn't last long in our house, but they were just as good a few days later. I chilled the dough for a bit longer and had no problems with it being sticky at all. These were just perfect for dessert and breakfast.

Not to be a stick in the mud, but these were SO pistachio-y.  The cranberries and white chocolate were overwhelmed by the pistachios.  Also, as another reviewer noted, the loaves did split a little while baking, and did not cut very well (crumbly).  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.

This was my first time trying to make biscotti and it turned out fantastic!! It was so easy to make, wasn't fussy at all and very easy to clean up. I didn't have any pistachio nuts, so i subsituted it with walnuts and almonds.. turned out perfect. Will definitely try pistachios next time.. and yes this recipe is a definite keeper.. although i'll proably add a little less sugar.. only because my mum doesn't like such sweet stuff.. but for anyone else.. just follow the recipe and you can't go wrong!

I really like biscotti but have never made it before.  This recipe was great!  I was surprised at how easy it was, and how great it came out!  I like that it isn't rock hard like most biscotti.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use dark chocolate instead of white (family preference).  Delicious!

I brought these to my sister's baby shower 9 months ago and I still get request for them.  They were a hit with my friends and family.  I highly suggest them.  If I could give it more stars I would.

This is a delicious biscotti, goes especially well with chai tea. I left out the nuts and added extra cranberries and chopped crystalized ginger instead, and I used a Lindt white chocolate with coconut bar. I also used fiori di sicilia extract (which is an orange/vanilla extract, think creamsicle..from the Baker's catalog). I couldn't stop eating them...sooo good!

This is a fantastic recipe! Because I was making them for me, I made some alterations though. First, I omitted the butter and used a six ounce container of no sugar yogurt. The eggs became 1/2 cup eggbeaters. I used a cup of carob chips, 1/2 cup raisins, and 1/4 cup almond slivers. I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar (I hate sweet stuff). Despite this, they came well. The dough was sticky, but I didn't bother refrigerating it (it also could have been from the changes I made). My batch came out to 22 large biscotti, very good with hazelnut coffee. Thanks so much for this one! My cat likes them too ;)

These were sooo good. Not too sweet and a nice complexity of flavors. I made some substutions: whole wheat flour in place of white, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar plus 1/2 cup Splenda in place of the white sugar. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed anise seed. Definitely worth making again.

This is my first time making Biscotti and they turned out awesome!! I didn't have pistachio or any other kinds of nuts so I didn't put any and they are still absolutely delicious. I added some chopped dried apricots and dipped one flat side in chocolate. Will definitely make them again. Thanks!

These were unbelievable!!  I used sliced almonds in place of the pistachios and less than 2 oz of white chocolate chips.  Afterwards I dipped the bottoms in white chocolate...  when all was said and done, they were just unreal-- everybody needs to try making these, they come out twice as delicious as you expect!

I used orange extract instead of zest and will not do that again, though they are still good, they lack that special tart flavor.  Will try toasted almonds next time and use almond extract in addition to the vanilla.

Fabulous!! Loved this recipe. The combo of the orange zest, cranberries, white chocolate and pistachios are incredible. Very easy to make and tasty. I cant wait to take these to work tomorrow for everyone to try. After making the dough, I did stir in the white chocolate, cranberries and nuts by hand (very chunky). Will make these again very soon!

These are so good!  I substituted almonds for the pistachios.  Even my husband likes them and he is usually a chocolate chip snob!  I think they would be great at a tea party.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy and tasty.  Good for bake sales.  I have made it with cherries and pistachios and also with macadamias and dried cranberries (I used almond extract instead of vanilla and omitted the orange zest).  Both are easily dressed up with drizzled chocolate or just plain.

Really good but couldn't taste the chopped white chocolates. Added white chocolate swirls on top of the biscotti. Tasted great.

Made these a couple of weeks ago and did not get to rate them. They are a keeper! Absolutely yummy as written, except I used GF flour & some Xatham Gum, so DH, who is a Coeliac, could eat hem too!

These were fantastic! It was my first time making biscotti and they turned out perfect. I didn't have an orange so I used lemon zest and I didn't have pistachios so I just left those out. I will make again with original ingredients because that sounds delicious too but in a pinch leaving out the pistachios didn't bother me :) can't wait to make again!

My first time making biscotti.  I ended up having to add more flour because the dough did not get less sticky while mixing.  Also, I decided to shape the dough into one log, instead of two, so that the pieces would be bigger.  And the second time in the oven, I baked them about 5 or 10 minutes longer to make them hard and dry, which is how I like biscotti.  Besides that, really good combination of flavors, especially the orange zest.  I'm looking forward to making biscotti again!

I have made this recipe several times and love it!  I use orange extract instead of zest, it is wonderful.  My boss is Italian and it met with her approval in fact she asked me to make it for her to take to her mom!!  Now that's a complement!  This recipe is Italian approved!

Nice smell in the house as hubby was baking. We didn't have any pistachio nuts so used pecans. I never use as many nuts as called for in a recipe, personal preference.

I was very disappointed with these. Compared to the cranberry-orange biscotti I'd made once from a cookbook I own, I felt that these were seriously lacking in flavor. And I was so excited to see what the white chocolate would do, and was disappointed to find I couldn't really taste it. It was frustrating to be adding more sugar and calories to the biscotti without at least getting a lot of flavor in return. If it's good biscotti, I can't stop eating it. This, however, I had no problem stopping. Surprisingly though, my neighbors loved it and raved about it. So perhaps it's personal preference, or my taste buds are just off! Perhaps I'll give them another try since if nothing else, I can make my neighbors smile again!

This is a great base recipe, and you can add whatever flavors you want.  It's no problem at all to split the dough at one point and make 2 different flavors.  I've made these a few times and I think they'll be my new thing.  Biscotti are easier than cookies.     The extra egg white adds a meringue-y-ness that I absolutely loved.

Delicious! Amazing! Loved this recipe!!! I added walnuts instead of pistachios and the combination was just perfect! My only issue was that it crumbled when I cut into it. I may let it cool longer next time.  MUST TRY!!!

These are the best! I've tried some other recipes, but found I like the texture of these the best. They are not overly crunchy, just right.  After the second round of baking, wait for the biscotti to cool completely, and you will know how hard they really are...they harden a bit once they cool, so be careful how long you bake for.  I added orange extract as well as zest to mine.

Great basic recipe to add to if desired. I happened to have messed up brownies and used those as the chocolate . Preferred almonds and only had a lemon instead of an orange. All were good. Buying an orange to make more tomorrow. Lots more brownies available. Bake sale coming up!

These were wonderful!  I couldn't taste the white chocolate at all, so I think I will double it next time.  If you want them to look like real biscottis and not round blobs, be sure and chill the dough for several hours before slicing.  If the dough is somewhat room temperature, it doesn't hold the shape after you slice it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had some trouble with them crumbling after the first bake when trying to slice them. But I think they may have been too soft & the shape not quite flat enough. Anyway squished them back into shape & baked again. Turned out good in the end and tasted great. My first attempt at Biscotti so will definitely try again.

Oh man, am i disappointed, the flavor was ok but...well, this is not my first time making biscottis, actually we've been making these for years and years at home, so i'm not inexperienced. The dough was extremely sticky (after 3 hours in the freezer) and the resulting logs were crumbly. I followed the recipe to a T, so i guess there was something wrong with the metric conversions. Anyway, i'm not giving this another try, i'll stick to my old recipe. Thank you

Wow.  YUMMY.  The dough was a bit sticky, but nothing a little extra flour (when shaping) couldn't handle.  I used a tad more orange zest than called for, but otherwise made these exactly like the recipe called for.  I also dipped in melted white chocolate along one side.  Hubby said '10 out of 10!'.  

I haven't tried it dipped in cappuccino yet, but I suspect it won't hold up well for that purpose, because they aren't rock hard like many other biscotti out there.

Really good with a great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, but I do have to agree, the dough was really sticky and hard to handle. I will make these again and maybe add/omit things and experiment. Gave them in gift baskets for christmas.

First time I have ever made biscotti and what a great recipe!  I ommitted the cranberry, used about 4 oz of white choc chips and when done drizzled them with regular melted chocolate chips.  Delicious!

Great taste; unique because of the orange.  I used orange flavored craisins and pecan pieces.  I think it's better with a little white chocolate drizzled on top.  For crunchier biscotti, seperate after cutting and bake an additional 6-10 minutes.  Use parchment paper! It turns out much better; it's worth the price.

I love this biscotti recipe. It is amazing wether you follow it word for word, or put in some of your own touch! I personally add 1 cup of ground almonds and a pinch of cinnamon. The ground up almonds give it a great texture!

This was good. I used a little less pistachios and a little more cranberries. I also used lime zest because i didnt have any oranges. >_> Good, though. Ill make this again.

This was my first time making biscotti. It turned out quite well, but I made it with snipped apricot pieces instead of cranberries (impossible to get where I live). The biggest problem was the stickiness when forming the 'loaves', even though the dough was chilled, and the fact that the loaves split down the middle when baking, which made them harder to cut. But as a first experience, this was a good recipe to start on. Thanks!

I don't really like biscotti, but these are great. The texture is perfect. Crispy but not too dense. Good flavor as well. I will make these again.

very easy to make, it did take longer than 30 minutes for the dough to chill for me...maybe I did something wrong?  Anyway, I used orange flavoured dried cranberries from Ocean Spray, that really added flavour, I also used tangerine rind instead of orange.

great - not exact crunch like a biscotti, and I couldn't detect the white chocolate, but it didn't matter much.

These were Delicious! I never made Biscotti before so I decided to try it, very easy! I left the  dough  to chill
for an hour, the mixture wasn't sticky but you have to work
fast to mold it and put it on the baking pan. My husband
and sister loved them! Definately  making them again!

I thought they were great.  Never made biscotti before, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I substituted fat-free egg product (like Egg Beaters) for the eggs, and there wasn't any egg smell or taste. Used only about half the recommended pistachios, as that's all I had, and that was plenty.  They are very pretty, so make a nice gift for the Holidays.

These were delicious. I substituted slivered almonds and I liked them in it. The only thing I noticed is that the final product had hints of egg - sometimes quite strong.

I guess I just don't appreciate any biscotti other than good old chocolate-dipped almond biscotti.....these were a lot of work and turned out beautifully but just didn't get eaten.....I really am the odd one out on this one....but for me, they really were disappointing.....can't win em all....

Excellent biscotti. I did make a few small changes.

I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup. I mixed the sugar with the dry ingrediants (flour, salt, baking powder), rather than the egg-butter mixture. It makes for a crisper biscotti, more delicate biscotti.

I also added a touch of orange extract, zest of one lemon (instead of orange zest), and juice from 1/2 lemon with the egg-butter mix. I upped the cranberries to 3/4 cup, dropped the pistachios (didn't have enough) to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup of pecans to make up for the pistachios. It was delicious this way...so good same way as the original

These biscotti were very good and easy to make. I was unsure about the amount of pistachioes, 1 1/4 cup seemed like a lot, so I only put in 3/4 cup. They were a bit crumbly when I cut them, maybe they need to cool more first. I will definitely make these again!

I've made biscotti many times. I was leary of using white chocolate. Also I didn't have pistachios. I had pecans but only 3/4 cup.  The texture is between a cookie and a cracker. The chocolate disappears when baked but gives it a subtle sweetness. The flavors blend well and the fact that I used half of th e pecans to replace the pistachios was good. They don't overwhelm the others. I would make this again and recommend you make it as well

I have made this biscotti several times and have followed the recipe as written.  I drizzle the white chocolate on top so the chocolate doesn't overpower the other wonderful flavors.  My sister and I were having coffee and had this biscotti on the table.  My 5 year old nephew went by and grabbed a piece.  I didn't think he would like it  because not overly sweet and I thought we would find it somewhere in the house with the chocolate licked off.  He ate all of it and came back for more.  Thank you Elizabeth Lampman for a great recipe.

Love these!  I made them with the ingredients I had on hand and used lemon zest and whole almonds in lieu of orange zest and pistachios.  Better than any commercial ones I've ever had!  Try and enjoy...

great recipe trick to cutting biscotti is score the loaves  before you bake it, almost no crumbling.
