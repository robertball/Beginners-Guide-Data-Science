My family loved these.  I doubled the recipe and served with melted butter and a TON of minced garlic which was a nice addition.  Next time, I will add more garlic and maybe some herbs for more flavor, but they were fine as written.  I didn't put them in muffin pans, but hand formed the rolls on a large baking pan.

These are amazing!! Everyone in the house said they are better than Red Lobster biscuits which gave me an idea of making them with cheddar cheese instead of parm....trying that tonight:) Update: made these using cheddar cheese in the dough..it was good but the way the recipe is written is sooo much better. Won't change a thing on this one:)

I just made these to go with Christmas dinner and they turned out really well. I did give them a second rise and used real garlic as opposed to garlic powder (crushed and steeped in the milk/water) I also added some chives. My boyfriend told me last year that I should stop trying to make bread... this year he ate 3 of these rolls!

These were amazing! Made it with chicken soup for dinner and everyone loved it! I found it just a little salty, though; next time will only add a teaspoon of salt. Light and fluffy and the parmesan was perfect!

I thought they looked great, but I did follow others advice and decreased the salt. I'm disappointed I did--they needed it, in my opinion. Maybe that was all it needed, but some melted butter on top would have been nice, too.

This is not the prettiest roll but it is very easy and had good flavor.   I donâ€™t usually use a lot of salt so the salt was a smidgen overpowering for us.  If I were to make it again I would decrease the salt amount to 1 teaspoon

They were so easy to make!  I doubled the garlic powder and forgot to add parmesan, but they still tasted amazing with butter.  I also added some chia seeds.

My husband's reaction after stealing a bite while these were cooling was "Wow!".  They are delicous and easy to make.  I served them with sausage and lentil soup, and these rounded out the meal perfectly!  I'll be making them again.

Very good recipe,thank you for posting. I also if I have any fresh garlic like to take an entire head of it and drizzle olive oil onto the unpeeled garlic. Then wrap it up in foil loosely put into a 400* oven for 15-20 min. or so until it is soft. Then squeeze  out the whole cloves of garlic and mix with a bit more olive oil and spread it onto the bread or rolls then add whatever else there is in the recipe. It is able to be spread like butter after roasting it and the natural sweetness comes out,it is really tasty.

These were some of the best rolls that I have ever had! I did make a few alterations. 1- I didn't use rapid rise, just used active dry yeast. 2- I used onion powder instead of garlic powder. 3- I used shredded cheddar & colby instead of parm. 4-I put just a LITTLE bit of minced garlic on top of the cheese. It made a difference, and it was delicious!

Made these tonight and they are amazing!  Grumpy wanted spaghetti and I had no bread, so I knew these rolls were on this site and that I wanted to eventually try them...so that I did!  I love the garlic and cheese. They are tender and fluffy and delicious.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Love these.  Read reviews, doubled garlic, left full amount of salt.  Then in addition to the parmesan cheese, I added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the dough before putting into muffin cups.  Can't make too often!!

These are a very dense or heavy rolls. They reminded me a lot of a loaf of homemade bread in flavor and texture than a soft roll like I expected. I filled them about 2/3-3/4 of the way and they ended up huge, thus only yielding 7 rolls. So, I would use a little less. The parmesan cheese was a nice touch, and flavor, but I thought the garlic powder taste was a bit strong. They are very filling, but I would definitely serve with some softened butter on the side for added flavor.

Didn't have yeast, so I put in baking powder instead (1.5 tsp to go with the 1.5 cups in the recipe, ended up not adding any flour because the consistency was great), used only 1 tsp salt, and liberally doubled the garlic powder. No need to wait around for the dough to rise, because of the baking powder substitute. Baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, then covered with foil until the bread became room temperature. Now they didn't fluff up quite like the pictures, however, they came out delicious anyway. Next time I'll try the yeast to see the difference.

I didn't get a real garlic flavor from these.  I'm wondering if real chopped garlic would have made a nicer addition.  I chose to make cloverleaf rolls (3 small balls in each muffin cup).  If I make these again I would probably tweak the recipe a bit to make them more flavorful.

Great and easy recipe.
Only things I did differently was add a whole teaspoon of garlic powder and added a teaspoon of parm in the batter, then before baking, buttered the top rather then use egg white and sprinkled with additional parm on top.

Delicious addition to our leftover spaghetti dinner.  I didn't have garlic powder so I added about 1 tsp of fresh chopped garlic to the dough before resting.  Perfect...not too garlicky.  Otherwise I stuck with the recipe as written.  They came out perfect.  Next time, though, I will form them into knots on a cookie sheet instead of the muffin tins
