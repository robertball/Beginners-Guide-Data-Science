Once when my husband and I were out on the town, we stopped at the Hilton Hotel and had a drink. I ordered a bloody mary. I have been talking about it ever since. It was soooo good. Well, i have found it in this recipe. I used tomato juice, not V-8 because vegetable juice is a little sweet. I skipped the Splenda. I did not want any sweet taste. I doubled the steak sauce and Worcestershire sause. I trippled the celery salt. Everything else was the same. I'm giving this a 5 because of the ingredients. After 30 years, I have found how to make the Hotel Hilton Bloody Mary.

No need to ever buy another bottle of bloody mary mix, as this is every bit as good and takes just minutes to get into the fridge. The steak sauce is a nice addition and gives it some tang.  Next time I think I'll add more Tabasco and horseradish because we like it spicy.  You have options on this.  You can keep it as is for a Virgin Bloody Mary (would be fun for the kiddos), or add a shot of vodka for the real thing.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.  Super Bowl is just around the corner, and this would be a great addition to the buffet table.

With regular tomato juice and without the sweetner(or sugar), this has been the classic bartender's Bloody Mary for decades. Proportions are up to the individual's taste.

This is my go-to recipe for a pitcher of Bloody Mary mix. I omit the brown sugar and add a heaping teaspoon of my own spice rub (you could use chili powder or a Cajun seasoning blend), and a little salt. These are amazing! You can also try this mix with tequila instead of vodka for a Bloody Maria!

(I left the sugar/sweetener out as I am not a fan of sweet things) I was worried when I first made this that it smelled like seafood sauce.  I refrigerated it overnight, and the next morning it was perfect, a good way to start a Tuesday.
