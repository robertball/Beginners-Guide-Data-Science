Very quick and easy basting sauce.  I doubled up on the siracha to bump up the heat a little.  Very good!

Great recipe!!! Chicken turned out really moist.

I didn't have spicy sauce so I added a bit of chilli paste and garlic powder. Also added the black pepper to the sauce and a bit of salt. 

Also added a bit of salt and onion powder to the chicken before the sauce.

Super easy to make and the entire family enjoyed. We paired it with some Corn Bread, Potatoes, and Salad and it was excellent.

I tried this recipe because I had the ingredients and needed a quick meal. It was delicious. I had first rubbed the chicken with a spice rub and let marinate for about three hours. The chicken was moist and delicious! I will definitely make again.
