Good and easy basic strudel, but I think some adjustments have to be done. First of all, I would increase cinnamon to 1 full teaspoon. Then, I might add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg and/or a dash of ginger or clove powder. Thirdly, I think it might be interesting brushing salted butter between phyllo sheets. Finally, I think it would be a good idea to give the strudel an egg or egg yolk wash before baking. That way, I think it would be close to perfection. Yet, this is a good basic recipe.

Very good and easy to make. I used half the butter than called for, spraying some of the phyllo sheets with a bit of cooking spray instead to keep the sheets from drying out, and preventing greasiness. Most of the butter I used went on the outer layer after rolling up the strudel, which gave it a lovely golden color after baking. I used Gala apples, for a sweet-tart taste, and one half-teaspoon of a blend of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, and a touch of cloves. I didn't have golden raisins or currants, so I used half a cup of regular raisins, and it turned out fine. The family really enjoyed it, and have asked for it again.

Very quick and easy. I used cooking spray on the layers of phyllo instead of the 1/4c butter and melted 1T butter to brush on the top. I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.

I was intrigued by this recipe and decided to try it out.  I was really surprised that the end result looked unfinished, and seems to need some kind of glaze to look pretty enough to serve or give to someone.  I also expected more punch to the flavor with all the apple, raisins, currants, and spices, but the flavor was very mild.  The phyllo was so flaky it was hard to contain and my family got phyllo pieces everywhere.  The flavor grew on me though, and it was delightful with an espresso.  I think I'll make up some kind of cinnamon glaze, and see if that finishes it off.

I have to admit I fiddled with this a bit.

I used frozen filo which I sprayed with cooking spray, tinned apples, sultana/currant/raisin mix (mixed fruit with the peel and cherries removed), added 3 tblspns of brown sugar to the mix, used 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each of ground ginger and nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves - and it turned out great! I used butter on the outside sheet and it was golden and lovely.

A great basic recipe with plenty of room to manoeuvre. Can't wait to use other fruit, or even veges.

This is a little time consuming to put together because of the phyllo dough. I "generously" buttered each phyllo sheet and baked the strudel on a cookie sheet that had no sides. The results were a greasy stove bottom and a greasy strudel. Had a piece of strudel while I cleaned my greasy oven...it was bland. Sorry, but I can't recommend this one.

Great base recipe.  I modified it according to things I had on hand.  I substituted peaches for the apples, whole wheat flour for the bread, added some crystalized ginger, and omitted the currents and raisins.  I served this with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of maple syrup--yum.

This recipe was okay, not great and not quite what i had been looking for.  From a time and effort standpoint it is quite a bit of work (buttering phyllo, preping apples, etc.) and the results are just kind of bland and generic.

Apple, raisins and cinnamon flavour is perfect: definitely a great comfort food! Now, visually, it's another story. And as someone else mentionned, you get phyllo pieces everywhere (except in your mouth) while eating a piece of this...

I hadn't used phyllo dough before so I was a little intimidated but it was fairly simple. The trick is to keep the phyllo layers moist with the butter. When it came out of the oven it was crispy. I covered it with tinfoil to keep it warm and it softened up the dough and was very good with ice cream. My husband isn't a fan of apple pie but he really liked this.

good basic strudel, needs some work.  Use clarified butter for a better result, and you didn't need quite so much.  Use a pastry brush, it makes a big difference, don't soak the pastry, even when "generous"  You'll get a nicer finish at the end.  The strudel needed a glaze at the end of baking to look really nice; by itself the strudel looked unfinished, and needed that "extra" touch.

I made the following changes:
-I was worried the inside might be a bit dry, so I added 3 TBS of melted syrup to the apple mixture.
-I also increased the amount of cinnamon to a full teaspoon, and added 1/4 tsp of allspice to it too.

I served it with a cream/caramel mix.

it was incredible!

I tried this recipe as a 2nd choice... I thought I had puff pastry in the fridge, given to me by my mother... I'd alredy peeled all my apples when I realized it!  I didn't have any currants or raisins, and barely anything else to add to my apples besides about 1/4 cup nuts and the sugar, breadcrumbs and cinnamin.  First time working with phyllo... Not fun!  I don't think I'll do it again soon, but the strudel came out pretty tasty!  I did bake it to look more like a tart, since that's what I'd originally wanted to make!

Added twice the cinnimon per advice of another user, also used cranberries instead of currants for an american twist. I cut up the apples with a mandolin for thinly sliced apples. Over all good, but could use a little more oomph.

As others suggested, I used much more spices than called for. Cinnamon Nutmeg Allspice. I didn’t care for the crumbled whole wheat bread so next time I’ll try tapioca starch or flour instead. I like this recipe because it’s not too sweet and lets the Apple taste shine through. I never peel the apples- I prefer the bit of added texture, and that cuts down on prep time.  Used apples from our neighbour’s tree, which are very tart, but the end result was just the right balance of sweet and tangy. I made two loaves on a cookie sheet and set off the smoke alarm at 400 degrees after just one minute bake time so I reduced the temperature to 350 and tented it with tin foil and that seemed to work.

This is an almost perfect recipe. It needs a little lemon juice with the sweet apples. I don't use butter on phyllo, just oil and they come out perfect. I don't understand how this is rated Heart Healthy when it contains butter! Never add nutmeg to the recipe (I don't know who ever came up with this spice-this is not apple pie...).

I used four big apples about a half a cup of sugar teaspoon of cinnamon and quarter teaspoon of allspice. I had trouble making the pyilloo dough come apart. So I used 3 sheets at a time. I sprayed them with. Oil spray I cooked the apples for a few minutes with about 4 tablespoons of butter. I used about 10 slices of filo dough each and next time would use 5. I finished it with a egg yolk wash with milk and sliced them a little bit before I cooked. I also made a powdered sugar and milk drizzle for when they came out of the oven. I turn the oven down to 350 the last 10 minutes.

I always wanted to make apple strudel and I did with this very quick and easy recipe. The only thing I changed was replacing breadcrumb with apple sauce which made it very light and yum.

Loved it, I upped the cinnamon to one full tsp.  I also sautéed the apples just a bit in the cinnamon, sugar mix with some butter to soften them a bit before putting into the phyllo dough because I used green apples.Oh yeah, I didn't use the bread either.

this was the yummiest recipe, i used this and the result was perfect! i am a working chef and this is by far the best way to make a strudel in my opinion and my customers agree. I tweaked a little but just to suit my needs for customers.
