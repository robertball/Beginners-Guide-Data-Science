Since I find the idea of buying polenta in a tube absolutely unconscionable(you're paying how much for cornmeal and water??), I spent the 30 seconds to make my own and refrigerated it before slicing. The dish turned out very well. I added a bit more spaghetti sauce, and used whatever hard cheeses I had in the fridge mixed with mozzarella.

I really like the taste of this dish, but it's a lot of effort.  Next time I would skip frying the polenta, as it ends up just getting soft again in the casserole (and it adds a lot of unneccessary oil).

very delicious and VERY EASY! i used a mandolin to slice all the veggies. i baked the polenta for about 25 minutes at 350F, which made it crunchy and not soaked with oil.  once i placed the polenta slices in the dish, i realized it was going to be smaller than i initially thought. i ended up using a 9x9 glass dish. also, with it being smaller, i omitted the zucchini, but added in some fresh mushrooms. finally, since everything was cooked and still hot, i broiled the finished dish until the cheese was melted. i will definitely be making this again and again! THANKS!

This was an easy and delicious summer dinner; we just melted the cheese under the broiler, so the polenta stayed crispy under the marinara sauce.

What a great dish! I followed the original recipe, but with the addition of a few herbs over the polenta before vegetables and sauce were added. I also sauteed the veggies with 3 cloves of minced garlic and some salt, which really brought out the flavors.

The taste and texture really evoked a "homemade, yet delightfully subtle" experience.  Next time I'll be sure to add mushrooms and make the polenta from scratch.

My family loved this recipe, and it was a great new way to use the squash and zucchini coming out of the garden.  I baked my polenta instead of frying it, and I also added the extra flavor of using Sun-dried tomato polenta.  Very quick and easy.  Delicious!!

Fantastic!  To make a one dish meal, I cut baked chicken into strips and laid it on top before adding the cheese and baking.  This is also good with the addition of black olives and artichoke hearts.

Love this recipe!  To simplify things and make this more quickly, I use a vegetable peeler to cut strips of both the carrots and zucchini, rather than slice them.  I didn't have squash but decided to add sliced fresh mushrooms. I also used a can of diced Italian-style tomatoes, drained, fresh minced garlice and basil-polenta. This is only the second time we've ever eaten polenta, but it won't be the last!

Great! I made this with the "Basic Cheese Polenta" recipe from this site as suggested by another reviewer. Even my meat-loving husband liked it! Makes great leftovers, too!

I've made this recipe several times now. It's my only experience with polenta, but I've enjoyed it every time. I use sun-dried tomato polenta, a little extra pasta sauce, fresh garlic, and lemon pepper. Reducing the frying time on the polenta keeps it from getting too mushy. Note that it needs to bake for 30 minutes and cool for 5 more, so the total time from prep work to serving is about an hour.

Delicious...
And you could turn it into a south of the border version.. Use cheddar instead of parmesan, salsa or taco sauce instead of spaghetti sauce, and add some mexican spices to the chicken! I'm going to try it this way today!

Really good. Great leftovers. Didnt fry the polenta, but did bake it first on a cookie sheet for 20 min to get it a little crisp. LOVED IT.

I really wanted to love this and followed the recipe.  It wasn't horrible but just bland.  We usually eat our leftovers but this just sat in the frig.

this was great. Instead of using tomato sauce, add some garlic, a little more salt, and a can of diced tomato's to the vegetable mixture, and cook a little longer before pouring over the polenta.  Also used orange peppers instead of red, turned out great.

This squash bake was a huge hit with my family, even those who don't usually eat squash! I added a few jalapenos to spice it up a little and the result was awesome. The only problem I had was finding the polenta. I finally found it in the specialty refrigerated section, in produce. Wonderful dish!!!

I thought this needed more than 1 cup of sauce.  It also needed more spices, or perhaps a flavored polenta.  The lightly browned mozarella cheese made the dish; otherwise it would have been too bland.  I'd like to keep it veggie, but will possibly add some sweet or spicy sausage to it next time.

I followed this recipe "to the T" and it was wonderful! This was my first experience with polenta and it was very easy to prepare and tasted great with all those veggies. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely Delish!!!! Brought to a friends house for dinner to go with lasagne. It was a big hit. I also did not fry polenta. Just made homemade and lined bottom of pan with it and sprinkled a little garlic salt and drizzled some olive oil on top of it.  I omitted the carrots and added mushrooms. I also added garlic to the vegetable while sauteeing. Very tasty, will become a regular in our house!!

This recipe is  so easy and delicious -- even my "meat and potatoes" husband was singing it's praises! Instead of cooking the polenta in oil, I microwaved the slices for 45-60 seconds, which helped to cut down on the grease. I also put a layer of polenta on top which crisped nicely in the oven. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I've made this recipe several times so I'm def. a fan. The first time I made it I fried the polenta as recommended but quickly decided that it was a wasted effort at least for my taste. I just cube the polenta, toss it in my dish and pour the sauteed veggies over it. I don't saute the squash as long as the onion so it still has some bite left after baking and I also tweek my seasonings a little every time I make it. All in all this is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe :)

the only change i made to the recipe was subbing tomato sauce (with the addition of a healthy dose of basil, oregano and garlic powder) for the spaghetti sauce.  what needs to happen next time to make this a 5 star recipe is:  1)  the bell pepper needs to be sauteed longer--the crunch was jarring, 2)  the polenta needs to be doubled--it was hardly noticeable.  i can't wait to make again with a little tweaking.  thanks for the recipe!

Really good flavors, very filling, unique and luscious.  I added mushrooms and cucumbers for added crunch, but chose not to fry the polenta (afraid that would make it too greasy / heavy, what with the healthy amount of cheese used here as well.)  The texture of the polenta still turned out great -just make sure to slice them thick enough to stand up to the hefty amount of ingredients.

I loved this recipe. I made this for my in laws who I didnt know at the time hate polenta. Well they used to at least because they both had seconds of this recipe. It is so easy. To save time sometimes I will not fry the polenta but just slice it and lay it in the pan. I also made this for my mother who cant have onions instead we used garlic and it still tasted great. This is a very versital recipe.

Basic but delicious. You could do a number of things with different vegetables. I also made the polenta from scratch. I would recommend using less vegetables than required though, as I had far too many for this recipie.

This is a nice alternative for meat lovers who are trying to cut back.  I find this dish has a simple taste.  If you prefer spicy foods, I suggest adding italian spices, more garlic, dry chillies or a little bit of goat cheese.

Just great!!!! I used less carrots but pretty much kept to the original recipes. The polenta soaked up the juices from the vegetables and when reheated it even tasted better. I think I might try this without the chesses.

This dish was good and healthy!  I used a 9x13 baking dish and I believe I should've used a casserole pan instead because the polenta did not cover the entire bottom of the pan.  I also might recommend adding some sharp cheddar cheese to give this dish a little more flavor.  I will definitely make it again!

Yum! I made this as a vegetarian dinner entree. I followed the recipe exactly except that I made the polenta myself on the stove and then lined the casserole dish with it before baking. It is healthy and very easy. It can be time consuming in that there is a fair amount of chopping, but I think it is worth it.

Didn't need a whole casserole so I made stacks. Fried polenta and used grill pan on veggies. Sliced and simmered carrots in pasta sauce. Added portabella mushrooms to the mix and goat cheese between veggie layers. Delish. Served with Caesar salad.

Really awesome! I used the veggies I had on hand (carrots, squash, zucchini, yellow onion, spinach). Didn't bother browning the polenta in oil before cooking. The flavors were amazing!

I had some yellow squash left over from my farmers market basket that needed to be used up, so I decided to try this recipe.  It was okay, but not what I was hoping for.  I made my own polenta, using the "basic cheese polenta" recipe from this site, which was excellent.  I think it was the yellow squash that I wasn't crazy about - which is no fault of the recipe's, just my opinion.  If I make this again, I'll probably just skip the squash.

A fantastic meatless meal.  I made my own polenta, and also followed another reviewer's suggestion to cook the veggies a little more on the stovetop, setting the assembled dish under the broiler to bubble the cheese rather than baking for 30 minutes.  We like our veggies a little al dente, and method this was just phenomenal.  Will make this again and again!

This is a 5 star recipe, if you make your own polenta! I highly recommend the Basic Cheese Polenta from this site.  The pieces of fried polenta on their own are delicious! Make them into this meal, and it's even better! I omitted the onion and carrots, and added in fresh steamed, chopped spinach.  I am going to make this again tomorrow, my family couldn't get enough!

I love this recipe, but my husband thinks it is too bland.  I love the way the polenta and cheese compliment the fresh taste of the squash.  I make the polenta from cornmeal and simply spread the mix on the bottom of a greased casserole dish.  I think this makes for lighter fare.

I've never had polenta before, I liked the veggies and the chese, but would not use the polenta on the bottom of the dish, didn't really add anything, would be good on top of rice or pasta instead.

MMMmm.  I just got finished eating this casserole.  It was amazing!  I did add about a pound spicy Italian sausage for my meat-loving hubby.  Also, I am out of garlic salt so I added 3 cloves fresh garlic to the veggies and cooked it with them. I added extra sauce, though I didn't measure it.  I just made sure all the veggies were covered (about 2/3 of a 26 oz jar). I couldn't find flavored polenta so I used plain with lots of salt and pepper and some Italian seasoning.  I fried each side for a minute or two.  We all loved it, including my two-year-old who kept saying, "I like polenta!"

Polenta frying was a mess,lot of oil  popping, and it never got crisp, it was not worth the work that goes into it. Too many vegetables, not enough sauce, I added more and it still was not that great. Just a soggy vegetable casserole, will not make it again.

Yummy and very satisfying as a main course. I'd never had polenta before, and actually had to cook it from scratch, since the closest grocery store didn't stock the prepared version. But the polenta I made was very good. You probably can't put too much garlic salt on it. I will definitely make it again! Next time, though, I will saute the veggies in chicken broth to avoid some of the oil (fat) used in the recipe. I had to substitute Swiss cheese for the Mozzarella because I didn't have any...Yuck, won't do that again!

Made this last night and everyone loved it. My only problem is that I HATE to fry. I will try to think of another way to prepare the polenta prior to baking. The flavors all meld well together while in the oven. I did substitute fresh garlic and sea salt for the garlic salt but that was it. Will certainly make this again.

This is delicious, although frying the polenta slices took a while and didn't seem to add much to the overall product.  I like fried polenta, but in the casserole it gets soggy anyway.  I'm not a huge polenta fan, but my daughter is, so I try to make it once in a while for her.  This is my favorite polenta recipe so far.  I actually enjoyed it instead of tolerating it like I do with most polenta dishes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy recipe!  I used Sun-dried tomato polenta on the advice of other reviewers, and otherwise kept the recipe the same.  We thought it was very flavorful, especially set off by some good garlic bread.  This was my first experience with polenta, and I'm sold now!  (we used the refrigerated prepared polenta and it tasted fine to me)

This recipe is a great one for getting lots of vegetables in one meal. I used a bunch of veggies and the sundried tomato polenta. It came out very tasty - my first experiment with polenta and I plan to try it again. My husband & I loved this recipe, but the kids were not so excited about it. They are young (3 & 4) so it was probably a bit too many mixed tastes for them. Next time I may experiment with less kinds of veggies and more squash. I think I would like it with a different sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce.

This is a really tasty dish and I've made it several times.  I recently brought it to a potluck and received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  I've used a couple of different seasoned polentas(sun-dried tomato, garlic & herb) and both are equally as good.

Delicious dish made with fresh from the garden summer squash!  My mom raved about it and even my dad (who turns his nose up at everything) ate it and proclaimed it was good.  Super simple and quick to throw together I will definitely be making this again.

Definintely would not fry the polenta if I made this again, added minimal flavor and did not stay crispy with the sauce of the recipe.  Otherwise, this was a great way to eat all of the summer squash we had gotten!

Oh my god, this is so good! My boyfriend and I just kept saying "this is so good" while we were eating it. I skipped the garlic salt and added a bunch of crushed garlic cloves while simmering the veggies. I also used more pasta sauce than the recipe called for. You could easily do a whole jar if you wanted.

Being a good Southern girl, I just used yesterday's grits that were cooled and solidified instead of expensive "polenta".  I pressed them into the dish and skipped the frying.  Make sure you cook your grits extra thick!  Made this another time with leftover cheese grits-DELICIOUS!

This was a great way to use up some vegetables.  I made a few changes: I cooked the polenta from scratch and didn't fry it in oil.  I left out the carrots and added sliced tomatoes and basil over the sauce.  Delicious!

Hubby and I thought this was very good- better the second day. Polenta didn't fry up easily- will possibly skip that step next time and see how it works out. Used the basic polenta recipe from this site- very easy.

This was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure if my family would like it because they are usually don't like that many vegetables in one dish; however, they loved it. All of the ingredients worked perfectly together. I will definitely keep this recipe.

A great and different way to use up those abundant summer veges.  Hubby loved it and kids liked it so it gets a 4 instead of 5.  It made the house smell like an Italian Restaurant-- very nice recipe.

I combined this recipe with the "Cheesy Polenta" recipe. I know it defeats the point a little, but I did not have any squash on me. I sauteed red pepper and carrots with garlic powder and rosemary, and the flavors worked really well together. I also layered cooked sausage in between the polenta and sauce mixture, so the dish was hearty and really, really good. My husband said it was one of the best things I have ever made.

Great - easy. I made this without the zuccinni simply because I did not have any in the fridge and it was great. Also added a little oregeno and some baisl to the tomato sauce. Fairly toddler friendly - didn't love it right off the bat but ate a good amount, I think after a few more times she will really like it.

I used sundried tomatoe polenta and added eggplant to the vegetable mixture.  It was fabulous. Next time I think I will use a teflon pan to brown the polenta instead of oil and see if that is exchangeable.  A new main stay at my house!

I've made several Summer squash recipes from this site and this is one of the best.  My husband who is not a huge fan of Summer squash went back for seconds on this one and my 3 yr old even ate some.  I did not have enough mozarella, so I combined it with cheddar.  Yum.  We served it w/ Italian crockpot chicken breats for a nice meal. Thanks for the recipe.

I had a hard time frying the polenta - it seemed to turn to mush - rather than crisping up the way I was hoping.  Regardless, the vegetables covered them up - hiding the evidence.  To my pleasant suprise, everyone at my dinner party loved this entree and took some for lunch the next day.

This recipe was quick and easy, a huge hit with my family!  I used fresh summer squash, oregano, basil, onion, and garlic.  I did a quick broil at the end for an extra crisp.

I recommend frying the polenta in just a tiny bit of butter instead of olive oil.  Polenta tends to soak up the oil and become very greasy - a small amount of butter prevents sticking and keeps the outer crust crunchy.  Overall a very good recipe.

Sorry, I just am not impressed with this recipe. It's vegetables in tomato sauce poured over soggy polenta and topped with cheese. Am I missing something? The recipe is easy and I am a huge fan of crisp veggies, but really, this is nothing special.

tasty and interesting way to make a veggie side dish. I made sundried tomato/basil polenta instead of buying ready made polenta. I cooked the veggies just until barley tender so they had a nice satisfyng crunch when served.  Very good.

Thought this was delicious. Everything melded together wonderfully. Our daughter, who is 3, didn't like the polenta which is odd because it didn't have a very strong flavor in the dish at all and she ate the other vegetables. Either way it was (mostly) enjoyed by all.

5 stars for the taste, but I had no luck with trying to fry my polenta (which is most likely because I'm nervous trying to fry anything!)  I really wanted the crispiness on the outside of the polenta, so I might try to bake or broil it first next time.  Thanks!

Great cassarole!  I substituted chopped artichoke hearts for the green pepper and I did not fry the polenta.  Just sliced it thin and covered the bottom of my cassarole dish.  Served it as a side dish to grilled chicken breasts.  Yummy!  Definitely will make this again.  Thank you for this recipe!

I have made this a number of times and it is becoming a family favorite.  I really think that frying the polenta adds an essential flavor.  To minimize the amount of oil you use make sure you use a good nonstick pan and get the oil (olive) fairly hot.  I always use about twice the amount of sauce--at least 2 cups and fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Polenta is pretty easy to make, although it does add to the work involved in this recipe.

Very good and will make it again.  Made it with the Basic Cheese Polenta recipe found on this site as someone else had suggested.  The polenta recipe makes extra, so I fried the rest and ate it while waiting for the casserole to bake.  The only change I might make is to remove the seeds from the squash.  I also substituted the pre-packaged Italian 5-cheese blend for the mozzarella / parmesan topping, just because it sounded better.

very tasty, although the frying didn't work to well for me, I prepared everything else as the recipe states. I omitted the carrots and pepper (didn't have any on hand)and used fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt and I also took the suggestion of cooking the veggies a little longer on the stove and throwing it under the broiler for 5-6 mins to brown the cheese.

I've made this many times and just love it.  Having a dairy allergy, I omit the cheese, but it's still delicious and full of flavor.  I also use fresh garlic instead of the salt.

Absolutely delicious.  To be health conscious I eliminated the mozzarella.  I used the entire jar of spaghetti sauce.  Next time I will add mushrooms and sauttee the veggies with fresh garlic instead of using garlic salt.

I thought this was really good.  Instead of using the garlic salt, I used real garlic and sauteed it with the veggies.  I also cooked the onions and peppers first so they would be softer.  Next time, I will add some chicken breast strips to make it a full meal.  I will make this again.

This was great and SUPER EASY! I did make some changes though to make it healthier. I cut the polenta into 18 peices. Then I seasoned with smoked paprika, freshly ground italian seasoning,sea salt and fresh ground pepper. I did that on both sides and then sprayed both sides with pam. I baked at 350 for 25 min. I sauteed 4oz of mushrooms with the veggies. I also seasoned it with the same seasoning. I chopped up a pkg of fresh basil and added it to the veggie mix after adding sauce. I used a 8x8 dish putting 9 peices at the bottom, 1/2 the veggies, the other 9 peices , the rest of the veggies then the cheese, I used reduced fat mozzerella. You MUST use a good sauce. Using a bad sauce will get you a bad dish. I used emeril's roasted garlic. This is something that I will make on a regular basis. My husband and toddler loved it and it was even better the next day. It only lasted 2 meals though dinner and lunch the next day. Next time I will double the recipe and if you have a big family, you should too.

Very good--The squash is delicious! I didn't have quite enough mozzarella, but used extra parmesan and it crusted over the vegetables very nicely.

This wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped when I first tried it.  I will add more spices next time.  However, when I reheated the leftovers the next day, it tasted wonderful.

This is definitely a tasty recipe.  I gave it a 5 because it was very good, easy to make, and used up my summer squash.  Not to mention that it involved deep-frying, and you can't go wrong with that.  Next time I'll definitely make my own polenta on the advice of other reviewers.

What I like most about this recipe is the versatility. I definintely think the squash is a good idea, but other vegetables can be varied. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. My baby loved it!

I loved this dish!!  We aren't vegetarians so I added shredded chicken which seemed to soak up the sauce and it wasn't soggy at all.  Highly recommend to get your daily dosage of veggies!

I used my favorite four cheese pasta sauce when I made this recipe and probably used a little more sauce than called for (I did not measure, only added to the veggies until they looked well covered).  I did not use the red onion, but added more red pepper in its place.  I could not find prepared polenta in the store, but they did have a box of instant polenta so I made that.  I did not fry it but just put it in the pan and covered it with the vegetables and cheese.  Next time I would make my polenta layer a little thinner, but that is the only change I would make.  This was great with some french bread on the side.

I really liked this dish.  My husband and kids loved it!  I made a few changes.  First, I baked the polenta while making the sauce.  It was a time and mess saver, plus made the dish more healthy.  I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil and added some italian sausage.  I diced all veggies to help my 1 yr olds eat them and added mushrooms and spinach to the rest of the veggies listed.  It was really great.  This is the kind of meal where you can add whatever you have on hand.  We will make it again.

made my own polenta,  did not have time to cool, slice and fry.  Added 1/2 c parmesan and some butter and spread it on the bottom of the pan..  spread the squash mixture(minus the carrots) over the polenta, topped with the cheese and baked.  This recipe is a definite keeper for summer squash season.!

A little bland, and not worth the effort. There is another recipe on this site that uses fresh tomato and mozzarella on polenta that is much simpler and tastier.

I made this as a brunch side with bacon and scrambled eggs. (Photo on page) I added spinach and used all zucchini squash and fresh minced garlic, just because that’s what I had on hand. I also baked my polenta for 20 before baking the whole dish. My husband who is from Appalachia KY saidthought it would be good with pepperoni in it. I loved it, my husband really liked it, hence 4 stars. I plan to use the cheese polenta recipe to make it for a pot luck next weekend.

This was truly wonderful... especially for my vegetarian family members.  Added a little more "spice" to the sauteed vegetables-herbe provence and what ever moved me.

YES, doing it again this week for company..

I made this twice. I followed the recipe the first time and it was good but bland so it deserves three stars. The second time I add spices to the bland polenta before frying and I added a cube of organic chicken broth to the vegetables; it made all the difference in taste and it was no longer bland. My husband and I loved it and with the modifications it deserves 4.5 stars. 

Next time I'll get polenta with cheese or with some other flavor and I will add mushrooms and chicken. I added this recipe to our family recipe book.

Great recipe AS IS and adapts very easily for what's on hand or your personal preferences. We jazz it up sometimes with a prepared, flavored (Sundried Tomato and Garlic or Mushroom and Onion) polenta,  my girlfriend makes hers with broccoli, we both add chicken for our carnivorous family members, and of course your choice of sauce will make a big difference. I have also switched to baking my polenta because it is so much more hands free time, and a lot less messy.

Our family loved this dish.  Decided not to pan fry the polenta to avoid a step and the extra oil.  Baked the polenta in the pan for about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients on top.  Leftovers made great lunches during the week.

Followed the recipe as instructed and it was SO good! Next time I might omit the carrots for mushrooms and slice the onions vs chopping. Either way I thoroughly enjoyed this! I will def make it again!

Just tried this and my husband and I both loved it. Omitted carrots and used about one half can diced tomatoes with about 1/2 cup tomato sauce. A good recipe for a meatless dinner. Definitely a keeper!

I liked the idea of it, i made my polenta from scratch so it was a lot more effort, i think next time i will season the polenta better, and make it thinner.
