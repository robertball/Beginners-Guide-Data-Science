Yum! I used bone-in skinless thighs, and cut the soup and wine in half - still made a ton. Served with rice and seasoned green beans. Omitted the olive brine as mentioned by other readers; the sauce picked up a nice not too strong taste from the olives. I considered next time removing the chicken and thickening the sauce (was thinner than I anticipated) but hubby said no, don't change a thing!

I must respond to KRCOOK's nasty review .. first if you are not a fan of canned soup recipes - DON'T TRY THEM. Second, ok so it doesn't serve up like a meal in a gourmet restaurant but we are home cooks here generously sharing our family tried and true recipes - not executive chefs.

This is an outstanding recipe.  Chicken breasts were used,and substituted black olives instead of the green.  I omitted the mushrooms and used chardonnay wine instead of the chablis. This is an easy to assemble recipe and most definitly a keeper!  Impressive dish for company.

I have always been very leery of concoctions made with canned soup, knowing that if one does not have the ability to create ones own sauce that there must be something wrong with the mix.  However, I decided to give it a try, it sounded so exotic, I guess due to the mention of the combination of mushrooms; olives; et cetera.  After slow cooking this mixture for 8 hours I can honestly say that I have never been so displeased with a recipe in my lifetime.  I was not able to serve it as a main dish, not only due to the lack of palatable qualities but due to the fact that it absolutely had no presentation qualities.  After spending a lot of money to make this dinner I was at least able to salvage some parts of it by taking the contents, adding some shredded cheese and creating quesadillas.  It is with heartfelt disappointment that I submit this review.

Very good and easy.  I would use a 3 oz jar of green olives (drained) rather than the 5 oz. jar to reduce a little of the tartness from the olives.  Serve over rice to take advantage of the wonderful sauce. Will definitely make this again!

My husband and I both loved this recipe (and I loved having dinner "in the can" in the morning and not having to think about it again!) Here are my modifications: I removed the skin from the thighs but left the bones in - less fat, more flavor. I also used 12 thighs instead of eight (I had a "bonus buy" package) and it worked great - I would do it that way again as it yeilded lots of leftovers and there was plenty of saucy stuff to go around. I also used fewer olives than recommended and none of the olive brine from the jar. I will definitely be making this one over and over again!

As we are big fans of green olives, this recipe caught my attention. This was good the first night we had it, but on the second night the leftovers were even better!  I also cut the amount of soup in half, and still had lots of sauce. A good family meal.

This is one of the best crockpot recipes I've tasted... most of the ingredients are already on-hand. I chopped a medium yellow onion and added about a tbsp. of minced garlic. Also used Pinot Grigio and cooked on low for about 9 hours. Served over brown rice. It really WAS better the next day, though!

Great, unique flavor.  Remember to drain the olive juice before adding as they have a strong flavor.

Very good I have seen 4 stars + that couldnt touch this. I used black olives, added thyme and used chick broth because I didnt have wine and omited the flour.. I also used thighs as called for- this keeps the meat moist and palateable. i will be sharing this with my friends who have small kids work etc. I am very picky and thought it pretty darn good.

We enjoyed this quite a bit. I added lots of herbs and spices however as I found it a bit bland. The olives are a nice touch. Also a bit runny but hey that's why we made rice with it.

I just tried this recipe today and it was ok. It was very easy to make, (first time using a crock pot). I used chk breast and 1/2 the cooking time, last hour on high. The chk was very bland in flavor. The sauce had a smell I didnt care for, but cut up the chk and served over brown rice was ok. Will not make again

This is so much simpler then it sounds, and really quick. I don't see the wine being very important. We made chicken salad type sandwiches with the leftovers that were great. Maybe go with fried rice..great unique recipe...thanks so much

What a GREAT find!  Here's my changes: 4 chicken leg quarters skinned & seasoned with Tony's browned in Canola oil; 5 oz halved green olives; 6 oz halved black olives; 1 small yellow onion; gewurztraminer white wine.    Cooked it on high in my slow cooker and it was done in 3 hours.  Served over brown rice.  Yummy!

I was a little worried about this recipe because of all the olives, but other than using chicken breasts instead of thighs, I followed the recipe, and it turned out fantastic.  Next time will add extra chicken because it makes a ton of very tasty sauce.  This one is a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I make it with 4 thighs so halve the recipe. I use one can of soup and vary the kind each time. Sometimes I add a little gravy to the soup. I experiment with different seasonings. I eat one thigh the day I make it and freeze the other three portions for the future. I serve with rice, noodles or potato. You can't go wrong with this.

Easy and good - I would do a few things different next time... I would double the mushrooms and 1/2 the olives. I am also glad that I read the reviews so as not to include the brine. I am also not 100% sure if it is the fault of the recipe, or my attempts at adding to work for 10 breast cutlets, but the sauce was much thinner than I was expecting. All in all a very nice and quick meal. I served it over white rice with grilled asparagus.

Of the 5 adults at the table, 2 rated it a 5+, 2 a 5, and 1 a 2 (but that was DH who doesn’t like food cooked in a crock pot!). I had 13 skinless, boneless chicken thighs and there was no need to increase the sauce ingredients.  After browning the chicken (this really didn’t seem needed), I used the wine to deglaze the pan.  I also mixed everything else (used canned mushrooms, drained the olives, no salt) in the pan and poured it over the chicken. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The only comment was that it could be a bit spicier. Next time, I’ll add more black pepper or cayenne.

I just threw everything into the crock pot. I did not do it in the saucepan first, and I did not cook the chicken ahead of time. It wasn't needed, and it turned out great!

Excellent! I changed it some according to the reviews. I didn't use the butter, only used one can of soup, used a little less wine (and it was red), added artichoke hearts and carrots. Awesome! Served with noodles since that was faster to cook - just threw them into the crockpot the last 15 minutes or so.

I made this with 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, so I only put half of the rest of the ingredients.  We all LOVED it.  I would take the time to thicken the gravy a bit more, because it was thinner than I would have liked, but the flavor was awesome.  I loved the olives in there, it was a nice change.  Definitely will be making it again.

This recipe turned out better than I thought it would, we really liked it. I used cooking wine because that's all I had and it turned out great. Next time thought I think I'll put in more mushrooms and maybe leave some of them whole.

Wonderful, easy and delicious!! My husband and I loved it and we will definitely make it again. I made some changes, but only because I was trying to fit the recipe to what I already had in the pantry. I used chicken breast, a 2nd cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery, added some garlic, onion, parsley, oregano, and a pinch of basil, substituted Pinot Grigio, and served it over angel hair. I left out the olives, but only because we didn't have any.

Although the sauce did taste good, it was completely bland. I doubled the mushrooms and added in almost a whole, fresh garlic bulb, but it still tasted like there wasn't any flavor to either the chicken or sauce. We ate this over mashed potatoes, which made it act like chicken gravy. I might make this again, but it deffinately needs more seasonings.

An excellent recipe.  I made a couple of changes, since I did not have all the ingredients on hand.  I used Cream of Mushroom and Cheddar Cheeese soups.  They made a delicious sauce for the chicken, and during the last hour I added 2 cups of broccoli to make it a complete meal, and served over pasta.  I also used Kamalata olives, which added to the flavor.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this last night..- or a version of it b/c I didn't quite have all the ingredients on hand - and it still came out really good. I can't wait to try it again when I have all the "proper" ingredients!

This did not turn out well. I made it with boneless breasts instead of thighs, maybe that's what was wrong. I really expected some flavor with the wine and olives, but this was really not to our taste.

I really loved this recipe. I used chicken breasts and did not brown them first, but it didn't seem to matter. It was really easy and turned out great. I gave it a 4 because it was a little salty. I served it over brown rice and my family really enjoyed it.

This was the first dish I cooked with my new slow cooker.  I used 1.25 lbs of chicken tenderloins, 2 cans of mushroom soup, and pinot grigio instead of chablis.  I was amazed by how tender the chicken was!  (Because I was using white meat, I only cooked for about 4-5 hours, and did not saute first.) The flavors were very nice together. Will definitely make again.

Easy recipe, but not what I expected.  Not quite sure what I expected but this wasn't it.  I think I thought it would be creamer, it was soupy.  I might make it again, but not often.

The first time I made this, I used black olives instead of green and also canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  It was pretty good.  Yesterday, I made it with the ingredients listed (except I used Sauvignon Blanc rather than Chablis).  I combined my soups, wine, and flour before pouring over the chicken, olives, and mushrooms.  It was delicious!!  We'll defintely have this again!

a great base to improvise with! i used this recipe as a base for what was lying around the house. subbed cream of chicken for the soups and capers for the olives. also used a dutch oven for 2 hours (crock on fritz). this came out utterly delightful and tender. i sauteed 9-grain rice in the butter and fat drippings from the chicken before cooking it right in the pan.

Awesome! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and 98% fat free soups.  I don't like green olives; so, I substituted black olives for the green. Just delicious!  Thanks for sharing!!!

For such a simple, quick main course this sure is eligant!  What a nice surprise.  I was so curious about these ingredients together. I'm anxious to show it off. I followed to the letter and felt it is perfect as is. I served with rice and will again. My husband suggested noodles and I agree it would work well.

Very good and easy.  I added one can of artichoke hearts in the last hour, I think that gave it more texture, the left overs were even better!

Was'nt sure what to think when I saw pimento stuffed green olives in a chicken recipe but I was intruiged so to give it a fair shake I made it exactly as written the first time and we loved it. I've made it regularly ever since with very few changes. I like to brown the chicken a little longer than called for just to enhance presentation and keep it from falling apart too easily (it becomes very tender). I add garlic and other herbs during browning, whatever strikes my fancy. I've used several cuts of chicken but bone in thighs seem to be the best as the recipe calls for. and sometimes I'll throw a half a jar of capers in just for variety. Even though it's just my son and myself in the house I make the full amount and the leftovers make great luches at work. Thanks for a real original!

We thought this dish was great over white rice. As I tasted it while cooking I was beginning to be very dissappointed, but as the meal was complete and put over white rice It was very very good - Not a weekly meal, but very good for something different for chicken

Wow! absolutely delicious.  This recipe could not be easier, and the result is spectacular. I used the chardonnay instead of chablis, and black olives instead of green.  Next time i plan to use a ton of mushrooms. A recipe like this really demands as many mushrooms as you can fit. Can't wait to make this again

Taste is all well and good, but no human should be eating 45% of their daily sodium intake in one helping.
I cant make it again because of that.

I had 8 people over this weekend and made this and everyone wanted to take home left overs.

This was an awesome recipe, my whole family loved it - even the kids! I skipped the browning stage and just threw everything in the slow cooker and then served it over pasta. The flavor was REALLY great, however next time i will try adding more to it (artichoke hearts, maybe..) Dont be turned off by the end appearance, it does look a little upappealing but the taste makes up for it big time - Enjoy :)

THis was very good and even my kids loved it.  I made a ew changes though  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and skipped the browning stage and just put the raw chicken straight into the crockpot.  Also, I used 98% fat free cream soups and added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I served this over brown rice and it was a good healthy meal!

I love olives, so I loved this recipe, but my husband is not so big a fan.  I only used about half of the olives called for, and the flavor still came through very strongly.  Such an easy recipe though, and delicious served over white rice.

This was soooo good!  I didn't have time to brown the chicken before work, so I just put the chicken in the crock pot.  Then I melted the butter, added chopped onion, soups. 2 small chunks of cream cheese,  and only 3/4 cup of wine.  I let it all heat up just a bit on low to mix together, then poured it over chicken and cooked on high for 4 hrs and at lunch time I turned it down to low for 4 more hours.  Voila!

Best slow cooker recipe we have made...and we have made a lot!  Delicious.  We used chardonnay instead of chablis only because  it's what we had.  That's the only change.  Thanks for a very tasty, gourmet tasting meal!

Prepared the recipe as directed- simple and very tasty sauce. Next time I would omit the olives and add carrots for a little color. Will make this one again!

Chicken was SO tender!!  It wasn't very "tipsy" so I'll use more wine next time, and I didn't add the olives because that sounded a bit off.  But this was a great and easy meal to make, leave and then come home to at the end of a long day!

Great recipe. I adjusted the cooking time to high for 4 hours. Chicken was moist. Next time, I would either use 1/3 of the amount of green olives or not include them at all. I might double the amount of flour next time. All in all I will definitely make this recipe again. I think next time I will double the amount of mushrooms and I will try adding some onions.

Have made this several times now.  My husband suggested egg noodles for the starch.  Was a great addition - made it a stroganoff feel.  I use boneless/skinless breast meat and it just falls apart at the end when I start stirring everything together.  Wonderful!!

Good flavor when I added red pepper flakes and fresh thyme but chicken became mushy.  Do not think I will make again.  OK but not memorable.

The recipe you typed in was just fantastic for our family.  We did put it over rice because it was so soupy.  Next time we will put it over mashed potatoes and see which one is better.  Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe was okay. I didn't like the gravy part of it. And my husband didn't like the chicken being so dry. Overall it was just okay.

Excellent slow cooker recipe. My first slow cooker experience. I played poker, my wife was working and this delicious thing was working in the crock. On the down side just a bit on the salty side, perhaps due to the green olives. Maybe a few less olives next time. Tasty  !!

Love, love, love this chicken! It turned out so tender & flavorful! My hubby wont touch olives, so I substituted a drained can of quartered artichoke hearts in water & loved the result. Definitely worth making for company. Served over a bag of frozen/steamer rice. Delicious!! I've already shared the recipe with 2 friends who also made it & they loved it too! Thanks!!

It was really good. More of a comfort food...like chicken soup. Biggest concern I have of this meal is the sodium level.

OMG this was fabulous! we loved it so much. very easy to make I followed just about everything except I only used the C. of Mushroom soup and replaced sparkling apple juice for the wine (only b/c I didnt have them in the house) I added some celery salt since I did not have the soup. Wow, the family loved it. My fiancee said he wasn't so sure when i set it on the table, but one bite and he devoured it. I served it with thin speg. noodles and broc. all tossed together with the sauce and the chicken on top. very good and different recipe, will make it a monthly meal for sure.  Next time I will try it with the exact ingredients, i am sure it will be even better then. 5+++ stars

Great recipe! I was trying this out on my husband, when surprise guests came (my mother in law and sister in law). They loved it! There was alot of oil on the top--I spooned alot of it off, and mixed everything together before serving.

I didn't put any green olives.  Also I used reduced fat cream of mushroom and cream of onion soup.  I also used chicken breast.  They came out pretty good.  My 15 year daughter even liked it.  I don't think she even knew I put the white wine in it....

I wasn't crazy about this, although my husband said a 4.  If I make this again, I think I will add some of the other reviewers' changes (garlic, onion, etc).  The chicken (we used breasts) did turn out extremely tender, which we were all pleased with.

Loved this recipe! I'm not an olive fan so I substituted a whole head of roasted garlic instead. I also used canned mushrooms and made sure to add a couple of dashes of red pepper, turned out great.

This is a winner. I browned the chicken thighs and then deglazed the pan with one onion and some of the wine (I used Pinot Gris). Then added it on top of the chicken in the crock pot. I only had one can of the soup and that was fine. Probably would have been thicker with two cans but it still tasted great. Served it over brown rice and it was a hit. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband calls this "strangely delicious"!  It is very unique.  We love green olives at our house, but if you don't, this is probably not a recipe for you...We also used boneless, skinless chicken breast in lieu of the thighs. Also, the ingredients are very simple, and we happen to have them on hand on a daily basis.  We'll make this a lot!

I posted a review a few years ago and gave this recipe 5 stars.  I just made it again for the first time in a while and it still gets 5 stars!!!  It is the best recipe I have found on allrecipes ever!  My sauce never turns out too thin.  I live at almost 8000 feet so liquid absorbs faster here.  Again, this recipe rocks!

I thought this recipe was great!  My husband only gave it an "OK", but said he would eat it again.  That's his response to most chicken dishes though.  There were a few things in the recipe that weren't clarified, so here's what I did.  I skinned the chicken thighs to reduce the fat.  I wasn't sure if you were only supposed to put in just the olives or the liquid in the jar also, so I put both in.  It turned out great, without the olive liquid maybe it would have been a little less tangy.  Carol

This recipe is my new favorite.  I loved it and even my kids ate it.  I read the reviews before making it and I drained the olives and I used about 3/4 of a 5 oz jar.  I also omitted the mushrooms and butter.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the recipe. The thighs were so tender and I thought it tasted better the next day.

I do like this dish and I made it exactly as written, it is similar to other recipes I have tried in the past.  The olives are definatly necessary to give this dish any distinction from other dishes.  The sauce was good, although runny even after the flour.  I will make again, maybe add some different spices to give it a different twist.

This dish was great... I added 2 garlic cloves. (smashed) I didn't add the olives because my husband isn't an olive lover! I served mashed potatoes for a side dish and poured the juices from the chicken over potatoes... yummy.... This is a keeper....

The next time I make this, I will cook it at 350 degrees just till the sauce is warm/hot.  While it is a good slow cook recipe, I would have preferred it immediately after putting it together and warming it.

I was not really impressed with this recipe, although I did use chicken breast instead of thighs I doubt it would have made much difference. Neither of my children would eat it after the first bite and my husband and I both said we would never make it again.

The only thing I changed for this recipe was that I used chicken breasts instead of thighs.  It wasn't good at all.  Even the smell of it was gross.  The only thing that was semi-decent was the chicken was very tender from being in the slow cooker.  I will never make this again.

I tried this recipe yesterday.  It smelled wonderful cooking all day!  However when we sat down to eat it was rather bland.  The only change I made was I excluded the olives because I thought that was an odd addition and my husband doesn't like olives.  Maybe the olives would have made it not so bland.  I will make this recipe again but I will add some herbs and spices just to jazz it up some.

Wasn't happy with this at all, unfortunately. The only thing I liked was that it was in the slow cooker and therefore I didn't have a mountain of dishes. I served it over rice, which helped with the saltiness issue, but honestly, that's not saying much as it was still WAY too salty tasting and I didn't even add any salt to the chicken, nor did I include the olive juice. Meh.  It gets two stars because my boyfriend didn't mind it and because of the ease, but I don't think I'll be trying it again.

I really liked this recipe and so did my whole family.  I had some concern about using the whole jar of green olives after reading all the reviews, but, I decided to try it exactly as written and then tweak it later as needed.  I didn't find the olives/olive brine overpowering in the recipe, actually I thought it was unique -- that may just be a personal preference thing.  One thing I think that's worth noting and it has been said before in the reviews is the abundance of left over gravy.  Next time I will reduce the by half.

This recipe was great!! Changed it up a little - I used only 3 oz drained and sliced green olives, pinot grigio, and added a whole yellow onion, diced, and an extra 2 tsp flour to thicken the sauce slightly. It was great, and I served it over brown rice, and one person had it over a wheat roll. Good stuff and well worth it!

I loved this recipe!   The chicken comes out pull apart moist and has a fantastic flavor.  Unfortunately my husband was not a big fan.  He didn't like the olive flavor.  Too bad for him!  I will make again and enjoy the leftovers!

Great recipe, and easy to put together!  I made some changes - I only used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, and then a small can of sliced mushroom stems and pieces.  I omitted the olives, since I didn't have any handy.  Tasted great, and plenty of sauce for the rice.  I'll definitely make it again!

Great slow cooker recipe.  Nice mix of flavors.  And it's impossible to overcook.  I left it in the slow cooker for about 14 hours and it was not the least bit dried-out.  Boneless thighs work so much better in the slow cooker than breasts.

Yummy! The chicken was so tender...no need for a knife.  My kids - ages 6, 4 & 2 - ate it up without any complaints.  My husband liked it too.  Served over noodles.  Will definitely make this again.

A winner with my four kids and was tasty.  I would suggest cutting the olive and wine back about half.  Maybe suggest 1/2 wine & 1/2 water would be less rich.  We liked the meal but it was high in sodium.  I will make it again.

This dish is delicious!  Used Pinot Grigio because could not find Chardoney and reduced the amount used by 1/4 cup and it still had a little too much wine taste, but it smelled wonderful and tasted great.  Next time will reduce the amount of wine even more, but my daughter has already requested this one again!

very very tender.  We used bone in wings and served it over pasta.  We added only half of the olives since most of our family aren't olive freaks.  This was a parent and kid pleaser too!!

I love this recipe although I've made some changes (as you tend to do).  I cook this on the stove instead of a crock pot.  I rinsed the Olives and added onions,celery,and Green Pepper as well as cajun seasonings.  Also, we are trying very hard to watch our sodium intake so I made the Cream of Mushroom soup off of this site instead of using a can.  It was very good, but a bit more bland because of the lower amount of salt.  I think as written this reciepe is wonderful, with the changes we made based on our own personal taste it was fabulous.  Thanks so much for Sharing. Also used cut up breast instead of thighs

It was nice to try something different for a change. My Hubby said he had never had chicken with olives before! I did use chicken breasts, and added some artichoke hearts but they really didn't add much flavor. Oh, and I used two cr of mushroom soups instead of the cream of celery called for and didn't need the flour, maybe because I just eyeballed the wine and didn't use the full cup and a half called for. All that to say.....You can hardly mess up this recipe.

This one was just ok. I chopped the green olives in the original recipe. After is was created I opted to add more spices because there just wasn't enough flavor for us. I don't think I will make it again, there are just so many other options.

Very delicious!  I would never have thought to use olives in a slow cooker.  It adds a nice flavor to the entire dish and the occasional salty bite.  I added chopped peeled potatoes to the slow cooker in the morning.  The potatoes had a great flavor and texture.  I'm sure it's great over rice too but I'll probably use potatoes from now on.  This recipe is a keeper!

Not recommended if you are feeding kids.  This dish had an overwhelming alcohol flavor.  If you are a dry wine lover it would be good, just watch how much you drink with dinner!

Delicious and super easy.  I used a white zinfandel and did not use the olives.  Kids and hubby all said it was a hit - and was in the crock pot in 5 minutes.  Can't beat it!

Next time I'll halve the olives & put them in a cheesecloth bag so only the flavor is infused.  They were a bit much so we picked around them but the flavor was excellent.  I would think you could use some of the brine as a substitute for the olives.

Although I didn't have the mushrooms, this was quite tasty.  I loved the smell of my house when I walked in after it cooked all day.  My 9 year old had two helpings!  That always makes for a recipe we'll do over and over!

I modified the recipe by using Chardonnay and black olives instead of green. I also added green pepper, onion, and garlic and it turned out great! We will definitely make this one again.

The family liked this one!  I didn't have enough green olives, so I had to use capers...still tasted good.  Even better the second night.  We'll make this one again.

This was a very good recipe and had a different taste than the usual 'cream of' soup recipes.  I will definitely make again. 

I did make a few changes, based on what I had on hand.  I used chicken leg quarters.  I used Pinot Grigio wine.  I used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic and cream of chicken w/herbs soups.  I had salad olives - so I used about 3 oz of those (and rinsed them lightly).  I did not brown the chicken, but instead made a roux of the flour and butter, then added the wine, soup and olives to stir and make the sauce.  Then I spooned it over the chicken and mushrooms in the crock.

The only thing I would do differently in the future would be to skin the chicken.  Perhaps it was because I substituted the leg quarters, but I don't imagine the thighs would be much less fatty.  There was quite a bit of fat floating on top when I got home!  But it skimmed off easily, no problem.

Very yummy - I loved the sauce, which I personally used as gravy for the mashed potatoes.  This is a great one to use when you really don't want to cook, but want a yummy dish to come home to.  I dislike Chablis so I opted for my white wine of choice, Pino Grigio.  Will make again - thanks for the recipe, Foxworth!!

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have cream of celery soup so I used double cream of mushroom (but I plan to make with cream of celery next time). I drained green olives and cut them in half. As others have mentioned, no need to brown chicken before putting it in the crock pot. This was very impressive and I would make for guests. Served over rice with bacon wrapped asparagus as a side. It was super delicious

This is an awesome recipe! I can't wait to try the leftovers...My husband loved it...I used 2 cans of mushroom soup but added celery salt to the chicken breasts I used..Its a winner, winner chicken dinner! The green olives definitely gave it a different flavor but oh so good.....Served over white rice....

I was sadly disappointed! I really thought it would turn out well but when finished, it was so mild and bland that the fried rice I used to serve this with had more flavor than the chicken thigh recipe! If you’re looking for flavor, this is not your recipe. I was so disappointed after 8 hours.

This recipe was great just as is.  The chicken was tender and tasty.  It was ready after 7 hours on low in the slow cooker.  I added more olives because I love olives and chicken.  Definitely will make again.

Made as the recipe as described; it was too watery and had too much of the olive flavor for our family's taste. But it was very easy to make and  it might be a recipe I work with to see if I can get it where we like it

Old family favorite. Much better if you use half wine, half Italian salad dressing. One can of cream of mushroom, I can cream of chicken. Stuffed the chicken breasts with bread crumbs and top with shredded mozzarella.

This was magnificent! (as my nanny said) I am not a fan opf chicken but I love skinless, boneless thighs and this was the best recipe for them since chicken cacciatore!! Only thing I did outside of the recipe is sauteed an onion and green bell pepper then added it to the crock pot- my whole family Loved and could not stop eating it!! I served it over fettuccine noodles... thanks for this super recipe- will be making this lots more!

This recipe was GREAT!  You have to love the taste of green olives though!  My husband loved it because it wasn't your everyday chicken dish!  I followed the recipe except I just used frozen chicken breasts and didn't cook them in a skillet before putting them in the crockpot.  Next time I am going to try black olives!

Very good.  I took the skin off the chicken thighs and then salt and peppered them.  I put the soup in a saucepan and warmed, but then I added the wine, olives, mushrooms and flour right to the soup and mixed well before pouring over the chicken.  (This mixes up better)  Served over mashed potatoes and the family really enjoyed.  Thanks Foxworth

Good and easy recipe. I didn't brown the chicken first, just threw the butter in.  I couldn't find Chablis so I used Chardonnay (I would use a little less of this). I didn't add any extra salt and drained the olives, I also added some dried rosemary to the sauce.  After it was done, I reduced the liquid and added flour to thicken it up.  Chicken was quite tender, served over pasta.
