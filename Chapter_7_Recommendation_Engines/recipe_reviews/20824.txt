My 11-year-old son made this recipe for a 4-H project last year.  He received a red ribbon. For canning purposes needs more liquid and should be pressure canned. My mother-in-law loves the relish with everything she bar-b-ques.

I really love this corn relish! It's very simple to make and my family always asks me to bring it along on picnics and barbeques. Just to clarify - IF you are going to can this relish, pressure canning works best. Excellent recipe Judy!

I love this stuff, but then again, I pretty much love anything that's soaked in vinegar. This was fabulous with some barbecued ribs, roasted potatoes and coleslaw. I didn't can it, as it made a small amount and I think it will keep well in the fridge. This would probably be a great candidate for adding some jalapenos or cayenne as well.

This was the best.  I made cheese grits and spread them on the plate and arranged five slices of fried green tomatoes around the plate and placed the corn relish in the center.  It was the perfect accompanyment.  All the flavors went together so well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm always looking for healthy toppings for fish and chicken.  Came across this one this morning and decided to try it.  I used 1/2 the salt called for and light corn syrup.  This really hit the spot on top of my grilled chicken breast.  Can't wait to try on our cod and mixed in tuna.  This recipe only made a little over 2 cups so next time, I'm going to double it.  I can't wait to give this out to our family and friends as gifts!

Very good recipe. Wished it had a thicking affect to the relish at the end of the cooking process like some corn relish recipes have, where the juices gel some, but it didn't but it was still tasty. My littliest niece who's 2, she devoured a small ramekin all to herself. I was very pleased. It did have a nice flavor. I doubled the batch and it gave me 4 1/2 jars. I could totally see me pulsing each jar after opening them and topping like a relish on top of hot dogs. Thank you.

I tried this to see if it was similar to a local product that I loved...and it was great.  I shared it and it was a hit.  I have made it again as has a friend and trust it will be made again even after fresh  corn season has passed.  We used more peppers (red and green), dry mustard and celery seed (as another suggested) and omitted the corn syrup (given how sweet our corn was) and it is great.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Try it on corn chip scoops...mmmmmmm.

It's a good recipe, but it really needs more celery seed, dry mustard, and vinegar for more flavor. I doubled the celery seed and dry mustard and tripled the vinegar. Instead of corn syrup, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar. 

Make sure your celery seed is pure celery seed and not the type that has salt added.
