I am the recipe submitter and I just wanted to add a side note since there has been a few questions on how to keep the banana slices from browning. Use fruit juice there are several fruit juices that can work to prevent discoloration of sliced bananas. If you're worried about the flavor changing, stick to the sweeter, lighter flavors:
Lemon juice
Orange juice
Tinned pineapple juice
Tinned or fresh grapefruit juice
Lime juice
Apple juice
Ascorbic acid powder(aka vitamin C) or if you're in a pinch, a ground-up vitamin C tablet works as well.

Another twist on this that I have seen is to use green olive, grape tomato, and white cheese.

Instead of toothpicks, I made these on top of wooden meat skewers and arranged them in a holiday vase for a party. They were a hit!

I made these for Christmas Eve. They are easy to make and the kids can help. Everyone thought they were a cute little treat. I am glad I read the review about dipping the banana slice in orange juice as well as the longer wooden kabob sticks and placed them in large wine glass

What fun! Thank you CNM Catering for this cute idea. We used big raspberries instead of strawberries because my grocery was out. It worked perfectly anyway. We used these on swizzle sticks in our cocktails. They were a hit! I think the alcohol in the cocktails helped keep the banana from browning! :-)

Easy to make, changed it up a bit added white cheese for the hat trim and put on a toothpick with a white fuzzy top. Big hit at our pot luck lunch.

SUPER CUTE!  I used skewers in place of toothpicks because my fruit was rather large and I wanted to used them as a garnish for milk shakes.  They were loved by all.  Thanks for sharing Andy!

I make these every year and they are a hit with the classes of all three of my kids! I cut the top of the grape so the hat lays flat. I also use a blueberry for the hat topper instead of a marshmallow. The kids love it.

I really thought this recipe was sweet!! I did some modifications because I did not have any strawberries, so I used raspberries! I put lemon juice as suggested to keep the banana from browning, and i also made a chocolate dipping sauce to go with it, by melting chocolate, cream and sugar on the stove. It really went well together, and was a great hit at my party!!!

Super fun, cute and easy.  Kids loved it.  Make sure you slice the banana thin and use small grapes - lots to fit on a toothpick.

These are a perfect holiday treat if you have a little cook at home and want a quick/fun project for them. They also look great for holiday parties. I tried both the banana/grape combination (can't fail) and the olive/feta cheese combination that someone suggested in a review. Word of warning: if you try the olive/feta combination, make sure the particular types of cheese and olive that you use will mesh well together flavor-wise. Mine looked great but the flavor combination was  fairly foul. Someone at the party suggested mascarpone might work better with the olive...hm.

Very easy & very cute. Used raspberries instead of strawberries. Dipped the bananas in orange juice. Found longer toothpicks in the spice & baking aisle. We instead of a marshmallow top I used yogurt covered raisins.

I used this idea but changed to raspberries for the strawberries (allergy), and I flattened the mini marshmallows and used them for the fur trim instead of the banana. Everyone enjoyed them and the festive look. Thanks for sharing this cute recipe.

My rating is for it's creative appearance.  This recipe inspired my Grinch Brunch menu for Christmas:  
- Grinch kabobs 
- "Who Hash" (any hash - I made potato and breakfast sausage with onions, red & green pepper)
- Eggs
- Stolen (because the Grinch "Stole" Christmas) 
As for the taste... the kabobs are best served with a yogurt dip or on a long skewer to garnish a fruit smoothie.

This was so cute! Was a perfect appetizer for Christmas dinner. And the little marshmallow on top made it taste like whip cream :) I took the advice from others and used lemon juice on the bananas to keep them from browning. And I used skewers instead of toothpicks (toothpicks weren't long enough) everyone loved it and it's super easy and adorable! it was a fun healthy snack to munch on through out the day :)

The fresh grapes and strawberries that are currently at our market are all a large variety so I opted to use wooden skewers which I cut in half.  This allowed for space to pick up each skewer.  In order to prevent the banana slices from discoloring, I soaked them in about 1/4 cup of orange juice. If I make these again, I will replace the banana slices and use white string cheese slices as suggested by another reviewer. The kids thought this was a cute Christmas "Grinch" just be sure and keep a watchful eye on the younger kids to ensure their eating safety.

NO Changes necessary!!   I've changed my diet and don't want to be one of "those people" who make others feel guilty at parties.  So I try to bring in healthy dishes without being too obvious and imposing my new diet on others. These are WONDERFUL!!! Everyone loves them. They love the creativity and they rival all those cute creative holiday cookies - hands down. Thanks for the great idea!!!

These were a huge hit with my grandchildren.  I prepared my grapes and strawberries ahead of time, but waited until right before my party to slice the bananas and put them together.  They didn’t last long enough for the bananas to turn brown??

Very easy and fun. Made this for a Christmas appetizer for the family.  I especially liked how my son gobbled these up, even though he normally won’t touch grapes or bananas.

I made these for a family gathering at Christmas. ALL were eaten quickly. So CUTE! Only problem was that those 4 pieces did NOT fit on a toothpick. I had to use fruit skewers and cut them in half, which is hard to do without splintering. Would make them again.

Wonderful!  Served these with the Cream Cheese Penguins at my Holiday Party and suddenly I was the Best Host Ever.  These were a great addition to the "healthy" side of the party.  Make enough for "Take-Homes" because you'll have them...

These were easy to make.  I cut the top off the grapes to make them lay flat against the banana slice and make it look more like the Grinch! :)  Everyone at our Christmas party thought they were adorable; and I loved having a healthier appetizer.

I did this recipe for a large gathering two years ago.  When I didn't show up with them this past Christmas Eve, everyone was so disappointed.  Not only are they great to look at, but they are delicious!  A winner of a recipe!

Simple and cute. I turned a few marshmellows red after handling the strawberries. Next time I will thread all the grapes, then bananas, then strawberries and wash my hands and then thread all the marshmellows last.

These were easy to assemble and were a smash at the Christmas dance party. The grapes I used were large so I cut them in half and placed the cut side next to the banana which I think gave more of a little grinch look. However they lose a point because the banana slices began to brown before the party.

I made these as described - except that:  a) I used tall, white lollipop-type sticks, and b)  the store was sold out of strawberries, so I had to use raspberries but they were great. I also added an additional  marshmallow under the banana which I think gives the Grinch more of a collar. As someone else showed in their picture, I served these standing up in a glass. Yet another new family holiday tradition is born from the wonderful recipes submitted by great folks here to Allrecipes!

I liked it. They were cute and tasty. But I needed longer toothpicks, it was difficult to place the marshmallow on top of the strawberry.

I have made these for the last 3 years for our church Christmas "coffee hour", and they are always a huge hit among young and old alike!  Last year, I forgot the bananas at home (didn't want to assemble them until the last minute so the bananas wouldn't brown).  So I ran out and bought canned whipped cream, and used it around the "rim" of the strawberry to resemble the fur on the hat.  It worked just as well if not better - more authentic looking, and who doesn't like whipped cream with fruit?!  Thanks for such an easy, healthy, tasty and cute recipe!

My husband made these for a party for second graders.  He inadvertently used the strawberry for the body (flat side on the plate) and then used the grape for the head with marshmallow for the cap.  Although it was unconventional, everyone loved them!  Bonus - they stood up!  This was a nice alternative to the sweets - which were overlooked because of these cute treats.  Thanks!

An excellent addition to our Christmas meals. It was a welcome, fresh alternative to the many sweets.

It was a big hit with adults and kids. Easy to make. I prepared it in the morning with a little pineapple juice on the bananas and had the skewers standing straight in floral styrofoam (as stated in a review listed below) and they looked perfect by desert time. I would definitely make it again.

My grandkids loved this. I'm making this again for Christmas day to provide a snack to hold them over while we open gifts. Easy to assemble and super cute. I placed them in a canning jar to hold them which worked very well.

These were a hit at our choir party -- and a gluten free healthy alternative to all the baked goods.  Several people told me they were going to go home and make them with grandchildren.  I did put them on long meat skewers and arranged them in a vase with floral foam at the bottom which worked wonderfully.

I brought all of the items to make these and then made them with my 5 year old grandson.  We had a great time doing it and he "designed" his own! When they were all done my 2 year old granddaughters loved them.  This is an easy thing to make and I suggest having the kids help!

Delicious and healthy Christmas snack! Not to mention very festive looking. Made everything as is and soaking bananas in apple juice was a good suggestion. Kept them fresh all day long. Very easy prep too!
