This is the most incredible carrot cake!!  I can't eat sugar and thought this recipe was so good!  I served it to people who can have sugar and they thought it was just as good as regular carrot cake!!  I didn't add coconut because I couldn't find any unsweetened so I added extra walnuts.  I didn't think it would be as moist as it was, but the pineapple did wonders!  So delicious!!  

This is the cream cheese recipe I used... 1 1/2 c. low fat cream cheese room temp, 2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 Tablespoon butter softened, 16 packets splenda,.  Blend cream cheese and butter.  Add splenda and vanilla.  If its too thick for you, add 0-2 Tablespoons of milk to think it out...

This carrot cake is very good.  You can't even tell that the sugar is reduced and Splenda is added.  I LOVE this recipe!  This is definitely a keeper.  I will make this one for Thanksgiving!  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe after making a few changes. Batter was a little thick so I added 1/4 cup water. I also used 1 cup raisins instead of flaked coconut. Everything else I did the same and it turned out great.

I made this for a diabetic friend... it turned out pretty well! I couldn't find any unsweetened coconut at the store, so I ended up putting a little bit more carrots (3 cups instead of 2 3/4) and more nuts in (I think I used about 2 cups of very finely chopped walnuts)and it turned out fine. Very moist and dense, like any carrot cake should be! I didn't do very well with the frosting, but on the Splenda website they had a tip- that you could put splenda and cornstarch in a food processor to make 'powdered sugar'. I didn't try it though. Next time.

I am sorry, but I didn't care for this. Made it exactly as written, and we were all disappointed in the lack of taste.

Que delicioso!! Me encanto!! Es facil de preparar, bien liviano al estomago, y tiene muy buen sabor.
I did it for a 3 year old's birthday, and everyone loved it!! The mother of the child is a vegetarian, and asked me not to say anything about the type of cake I was making for this birhtday,and it was a hit!
Lo volvere a preparar otra vez!!

I made this cake a week ago, and it was the MOISTEST truly tasteful carrot cake I have ever had! The spices coupled with the carrots, walnuts, coconut and pineapple were a winning combination!

My family loves this cake. I substituted raisens for coconut and pecans for walnuts and made a sheet cake. I will do cupcakes next.  Did not even try an icing.  This is worth the effort.

I wanted to make something special for my diabetic husband's birthday and found this receipe.  I read all the reviews and it seemed perfect. I made the adjustments according to the reviewer's suggestions (extra water and cinnamon, baked in 2 8" pans, shorter baking time). It came out somewhat dry and the carrots turned green!!(from the extra cinnamon??)Can anyone explain the color change? I used prepackaged grated carrots to save time. Now I have a huge cake that my husband won't eat. Very disappointed!

Thought it was very good. Even took it to preschool for impartial reviews. Of the kids who liked carrot cake, they all liked this one! Used the cream cheese frosting recipe of a previous reviewer and it turned out great. Yum!

I made 2 of these cakes, one for my family and one for a diabetic friend.  They turned out fantastic.  Dont be alarmed if the batter looks thick in the beginning, the pineapple adds just enough moisture.  Excellent recipe.  Oh, the reason your carrots turned green is because you cant used pre-packaged carrots for salads for carrot cake, the pieces are just too large to cook into the batter and oxidize with the spices.  Just a little patience,love and a small toothed grater will do the trick next time.

I've had gastric bypass and my ex-husband is a diabetic, I made this cake for "us" at my grand-daughters 5th birthday party and several guests preferred the carrot cake over the store bought traditional cake!! I was asked for the recipe by 3 different people!! A great cake, and tolerated just fine by a gastric bypass pt (small piece of course) and by diabetics!! WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!!!! Thanks!
