CHEF'S NOTE: The measurements for the bread crumbs and cayenne are incorrect!  It should read:

My husband thinks he's died and gone to Heaven when I fix this! It goes great with just about any meat you choose to fix. I  never use the same cheeses, I go to the deli counter and ask them if they have ANY "cheese ENDS", they sell them for 50 cents a lb... This scrumptous dish usually cost me about $2.50....for 10 servings!!  Thanks S.Michael for a great recipe..

Absolutely wonderful. I only made one change and that's using all fat free evaporated milk. The combination of these cheeses was just wonderful. My boys ate it all and the little I had was just......WONDERFUL. This is going to be my new macaroni and cheese recipe. NOTE: I did add a little hot sauce, onion/garlic powder and dijon mustard but I add that to every macaroni and cheese recipe I make as it's a family favorite.

I have tried this out at several dinner parties and first on my boyfriend.  Everyone has raved about the taste.  I haven't changed much. What I use for cheeses are: Artisan Smoked Gouda, Imported Swiss Gruyere, Aged 10 Month Parmesan Shredded, and being a loyal Vermonter I use Seriously Sharp Hunters' Cabot Cheddar.  I find that if you are patient in melting the cheese (shredding is the fastest way to melt it, not cubing like I tried once) that it does not produce a grainy consistency.  I whole heartedly give two very enthusiastic thumbs up.  Thank you Shannon for this recipe.

Really, really good, with a lot of potential.  I may have overdone the smoked Gouda, and would use half smoked, half non-smoked next time (or maybe 75/25), as the smoky flavor was a titch overwhelming (but I'm not a huge fan of smoky flavors).  I used about 4 cups of half and half, and a cup and a half of whole milk, and Provolone in place of the Swiss (not a fan of the Swiss cheese, although to be fair, I should have given it a chance in this dish).  I also used Trader Joe's whole wheat rotini, and may change that next time, although the ridges held the sauce beautifully.  The only other change I made was to use melted butter over the Panko and parm mix instead of olive oil. This recipe proves that it's only as good as the ingredients.  Use the best you can afford, as it makes a difference.  Reheats wonderfully.  I know it annoys me when people people rate a recipe up or down based on their changes, but I think this recipe lends itself to easy, personal- preference changes.  If you don't like Swiss, don't use Swiss.  If you don't like spicy, don't use the red pepper in the crust (or double it, like I did).  Wonderfully adaptable, but I promise to try it exactly as written next time, with more adaptations the time after.  There WILL be a next time.  Next times.  We're all fighting over the left-overs, and that seldom happens in my house.  One of the best recipes I've run across here, and that's saying a LOT.  Thank you for an easy, delicious, unlimited- possibilities recipe!

Fantastic. I've made it five Thanksgivings in a row, sometimes using the different cheeses called for, and sometimes using almost all smoked gouda. Sometimes it's been grainy, so one year I figured out the following adjustments and it was perfect! ANTI-GRAININESS VARIATION:
INGREDIENTS: 8 T (1 stick) butter, 6 T flour, 4 c milk + 2 c heavy cream, a small amount of processed cheese for stabilizing (i.e. 2 slices American), 4-6 c shredded cheese (I used 2 half-lb packages of smoked gouda, 1 c grated parmesean, 1 c shredded cheddar), 1/2 t paprika, pasta. TOPPING: 1 c panko crumbs, 1/2 c parm, 1/2 t cayenne pepper, optional t of parsley for color, 2-3 T melted butter (or olive oil). STEPS: Melt butter. Wisk in flour to make roux. Let bubble, but don't burn. Add a little milk/cream and stir until roux is incorporated. Add the rest of the milk/cream. Heat over medium-high heat, wisking constantly, until thickened. Lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, 10 mins. REMOVE FROM HEAT BEFORE ADDING CHEESE. Add a small amount of a processed cheese, which stabilizes the sauce/prevents graininess. Stir until melted. Add shredded cheese, cover, and let sit until melted, stirring occasionally. Turn on low heat if necessary to get it to melt, but don't overheat-DON'T let it boil. Add paprika. Cool. Make pasta and cool. Add cooled pasta to cooled cheese sauce and pour into 13x9 pan. Refrigerate until chilled. Combine topping ingredients and sprinkle over pasta. Bake at 400 until golden.

Great recipe! the cayenne pepper does add quite a kick, so i'll probably cut it down to 1/2 a tsp, just for personal tastes. and i also did the topping 1/4 c cheese and 1/4c bread crumbs. and it was fantastic!

This was really good!! It was my first time to make homemade mac and cheese, and I thought it was pretty easy. I was a little confused on how thick to make to milk, butter, and flour roux....I just stirred it until it was thick little buttermilk and it worked perfect. I also added a little lemon juice to my shredded cheeses, so the sauce would not be string. I also took the pan off the heat before I added the cheese to the mixture. 

Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried a few different recipes on this site and I have to say this is the best one yet. The Gouda brings on a thickness without the cheesy taste. Word of warning, this is also the heaviest Mac and cheese I've had so far.

Delicious - served it with fried chicken and fresh steamed spinach.  I put the cayenne in with the roux (instead of in the bread crumb/parmesan topping).  And, I added a little dried parsley to the crumb topping for color.  I used whole wheat penne instead of elbow macaroni.  I have a feeling the leftovers will freeze well.  Great receipe.

Absolutely delicious Mac and Cheese. The smoked gouda is important. I think next time I might add a few more bread crumbs to the top but an otherwise amazing recipe! Thanks for posting!

This is seriously The Best Mac & Cheese I have ever had!  The flavors in it are incredible and it is so creamy.  This is the second time I've made it and it was better this time.  I think because the first time (which was just a couple weeks ago) I had to make it for a school function and needed to serve 12 so the measurements (through Allrecipes) didn't work right.  But, tonight it was just perfect.  Everyone had seconds.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

Mine came out a little grainy. I guess I didn't do something right with the sauce. Overall it was good, but not great. Too much cayenne for my taste. I would reduce it by half next time. But it was definitely a nice creamy mac & cheese - not dry at all. After I made it I topped it with a little crumbled bacon to try to add some texture, and that was good. Will probably try it again with the bacon cooked into it.

This is amazing! Between the smoked gouda and the panko breadcrumbs with paprika... Woah. The second time I made it I used pipette pasta because there were no elbows and it was even better! Great recipe!

Every time I make this recipe it keeps getting better and better. As a stand alone recipe it is surely five stars, but of course tweaking the recipe to meet your tastebuds can make this recipe an easy six...oh wait...can't do 6, although it is in my mind.   

As a minor adjustment I add a bit of liquid smoke  because I like the smokey flavor. I also mix in heavy cream to thicken it up and give it additional richness (not that it needs it---just decadent).

This recipe is great with smoked gouda!! My family absolutely loved this recipe! I made a few little changes. I substituted provolone for the swiss, and added a quarter cup of chopped crispy bacon. Amazing "comfort food" recipe!! Thanks for sharing!

DELECTABLE!  I made this using whole wheat pasta, skim milk and 2% milk cheese (except the smoked Gouda).  It still turned out incredibly rich and creamy.  The only addition was 6 strips of crumbled, center cut bacon mixed in with the bread crumb topping.  Everyone at my table raved over this mac and cheese.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Nice spiciness, and I love smoked gouda, but this just didn't work for me at all.  For some reason I think it was the swiss and also way too much gouda, they just fought each other, but, I thank you for the recipe.  I think this was just a personal preference thing.

The taste of this dish was very different from the traditional baked mac & cheese. I was a little skeptical about all the milk that this dish asked for so I only added 4c of milk and I thought it was too soupy so I added more breadcrumbs and it helped thicken it up. Also, I purchased the regular gouda cheese since I couldn't find the smoked kind at the deli and I just added liquid smoke to the dish.... this mac & cheese is super yummy. Everyone loved it!

My macaroni and cheese came out just like your picture.  It wasn't as creamy as I usually like macaroni and cheese, but it was still good.  I will definitely make again and maybe not use as much pasta.  That could have been the problem.

I'm not a macaroni and cheese fan but I had a lot of leftover smoked gouda so decided to give this a try.  I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for and used whole wheat penne instead of elbow but it was great.  I also didn't have enough parmesan for both the sauce and the crust so I used McCormick Parmesan Herb seasoning with panko bread crumbs and it was great.  I actually forgot the olive oil and it still came out great.

Made this tonight to go with hamburgers off the grill.  It had good flavor, though I think maybe the smoked gouda was too overpowering; next time I'll cut back on that a little.  I was craving macaroni and cheese and this certainly took care of that craving!

Absolutely delicious. Not everyone likes the smoky flavor of gouda, but for those who do, this will be a hit. I would suggest using just a dash of the cayenne for the topping or remove it all together. This is definitely a grown up version of man-n-cheese.

This was delicious! We needed to use up some gouda and this was perfect. I didn't find it too heavy for a homemade Mac and cheese like some others did. We added about a pound of crab the second time around and it was amazing!

I usually use more cheese to suit our tastes and use varied cheeses but the smoked gouda makes it perfect. Great with BBQ

I wish I had remembered the note in the reviews to use half the cayenne. I forgot and used a whole teaspoon. Way, way too much! I think for next time I would leave it out completely. Otherwise this is a relatively easy dish to make.....and it makes a lot! Our family of three ate it for four days as a main dish. I had all the cheeses on hand, but I do think it would work with other cheeses. The smoked Gouda does leave a nice smoky taste. Overall a really great twist on mac and cheese and a definite keeper for us. Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVED this mac and cheese!  so simple and the taste is wonderful.  I made this for a neighborhood party and it was the hit of the party. I used everything but the swiss cheese because I didn't have it in the house.  I also used more bread crumbs to cover the top.  And I added bacon to the mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will def. be making this again

I halved this recipe and still easily filled a 9x13 pan and made A LOT of mac and cheese.  I have a personal favorite recipe for mac and cheese that I doctor on a regular basis.  This is a very close second... It was so great and I loved every bite.  I added some italian seasoning and some black pepper.  But those are the only changes I made!  It's wonderful.

I was so excited to try this as mac and cheese is one of my favorite things to eat.  Add smoked gouda (my fav cheese) and I'm sold!  Sadly, this fell short for me.  The gouda overpowered everything else.  I may try again, but cut back on the gouda and add more of the others.  I followed everything exactly except I added a couple shakes of hot sauce instead of the cayenne.

I loved this Mac and cheese but I do have to admit I altered the recipe more then normal because I didn't want to spend a bunch of money for all the cheese. I used the cheese I had on hand. Which was Monterey Jack, Colby, Sharp chadder, and Parmesan. Then after cooking and mixing the noodles with the cheese I felt I was missing the smokey part of the recipe so I added Worcester sauce and a lil hot sauce to the cheese. I felt this gave it a lil smoke BBQ flavor to it. I then finished the recipe as directed with the bread crumbs. I like my mistake Mac and cheese so much but I feel its not the original recipe at all so FYI.

Not a great Mac and Cheese recipe.  I didn't care for the texture the parmesan cheese gave the dish.  I love all the cheeses in the recipe, so that wasn't the issue.  It was runny after I cooked it and dry after refrigeration (which most mac and cheese is anyway).  It makes a ton and is expensive. It definitely wasn't good enough to make again.

For the first time making mac & cheese from scratch, this recipe was clear and concise. However...the final dish was a bit bland tasting. I'm thinking, some seasoned bread crumbs next time. And rather than 1/2 cup of crumbs, I'll double that portion of the recipe. The crunchy topping was the tastiest part.

Yum.....this is a keeper.  It is important to read the chef's note which staes a typo, 1 1/2 C. bread crumbs and 1/2 t. cayenne.  I had leftover ham so I popped in a cup or so of that!!

this was my first time making homemade mac n' cheese and boy did i pick the right recipe.  My boyfriend and I both LOVED it!  It makes a lot and is SUPER filling though.  We will have leftovers for a week!  I added 1 tsp garlic powder and black pepper to the roux and topped it with parsley. Served it with chopped up ham (mixed it in) and green beans.

Awesome!  Do mix the topping to spread the cayenne evenly, or just add it to the sauce.

didn't notice the changes to the recipe until it was too late...  waste of cheese.  2/5 stars as writen. would probably be good if made right... the cheese mix tastes nice, but mac and cheese shouldn't be spicy...

What a phenomenal dish!  I made this three weekends in a row as a side for BBQ and it usually disappeared around Tuesday. I made it exactly as written and it was rich, creamy and very tasty.  The only thing I added was a little salt in the bread crumb red pepper coating.  This is one of the best dishes on this site!

Sure beats the store bought stuff from a box.  I thought this was a keeper and reheated well for lunch the next day.  I, like another reviewer suggested, will try this with some bacon bits the next go around.  Thanks!

I made half the recipe in a smaller, elongated, glass baking dish. I used a 8 oz. bag of "Expertly Paired" Kraft shredded gouda and cheddar cheese combo, and swiss cheese. The recipe takes time and patience to create the roux and let the 1% milk thicken but I ended up with a creamy cheese mixture. I used only a pinch of cayenne with the parmesan topping. I omitted the bread crumbs, personal preference. Next time I would add more cayenne. Others stated a grainy texture...maybe they used sprinkle parmesan cheese and not shredded? I used shredded. Delicious and a definite keeper!

Made half the recipe. Added 1/2 tsp ground mustard and 1/2 tsp Chipotle Tobasco sauce to the cheese mixture. 1/2 tsp smoked paprika or 1/2 tsp cayenne in breadcrumb mixture. Sprayed the breadcrumb top with Olive Oil cooking spray. Only needed 20 minutes in convection oven.

MADE IT IN THE CROCKPOT!! This was great, especially since we needed the oven for other items to bake. Cooked macaroni. Melted the butter in microwave, then put in a large mixing bowl. Whisked flour in, and then slowly added milk. Grabbed a bigger bowl and added that mixture to the macaroni and cheeses. Poured in large crock pot. Sprinkled breadcrumb/parm mixture on top. Cooked on high for 2.5 hours. YUMMY

This macaroni and cheese recipe had a great flavor and texture. I made it with a little less butter& flour than the recipe required, and it still turned out ok.

I will make this again, but add more maccaroni. It was relatively easy to make and I've NEVER made Mac n cheese from scratch like this. I love the smoked Gouda.

This is the first homemade mac & cheese I’ve made that has been a success...it was delicious!  I only made a small change since children would be eating it and I was concerned they wouldn’t be able to handle the cayenne pepper.  I substituted paprika for the cayenne, added it to the melted cheese in the large pot instead of using it in the topping, and added some salt & pepper to the melted cheese as well.  It was loved by both adults and kids...thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will use for many years to come!!

This has become a favorite in our house, but sadly I have to leave the breadcrumbs off to satisfy the kids. I do change up the cheeses, though. The current favorites are Gouda, pepper jack, extra sharp cheddar, and Swiss, topped with grated Parmesan and Romano.

I made this recipe as is (tripling portions) for a potluck.  It was the favorite dish by a mile. 

Thanks, I’ll be making this again come Christmas.

Our new favorite recipe for mac-n-cheese.  The only modification to the original recipe I make is to use straight gouda cheese vice smoked.  I cook it on my Big Green Egg with some apple or pear wood to get the smokey flavor.  My son thinks it's better than Kraft!

I have never left a recipe review before, but I felt this one really deserved the small effort..

I made this to bring to a St Patrick's Day party, and every single person there was raving about how amazing it was!

I was trying to find a recipe similar to what they make at an irish pub around here. So I skipped the bread crumbs and added sliced lil smokies. That's it. The rest stayed the same. Awesome recipe.

Followed recipe as written except I used 1/2 smoked Gouda and 1/2 regular Gouda. But that was a personal preference as I  find smoked anything can be a bit over whelming. It was amazing and probably would have been awesome with all smoked Gouda.

This was a hit! I made these changes:

I used chipotle cheddar instead of regular cheddar.
I used panko instead of breadcrumbs.
I added 6 pieces of bacon, crumbled and mixed in with the breadcrumb and cayenne topping.

I made this just like the recipe said and it was awesome! I believe I will experiment with the recipe the next time I make it. Next time I'll "bake" it on my charcoal grill using apple or maybe pecan wood to make it a truly smoked Mac n cheese. Since this is where the recipe started I'll post my results here. Thanks for a great recipe!

This macaroni and cheese is phenomenal. I switched off the cheeses each time I made it and it is delicious every time. The last time I made it I used fontina, asiago, smoked Gouda, and Parmesan.  I find it less expensive to get the cheeses from our deli. Amazing recipe and thank you for sharing

Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving.  I used the panko bread crumbs as some others suggested  and they added a nice crispy top.  The only complaint came from the kids, who didn't like the rich and smokey tastes and flavors of this.  The adults however adored it.  Will make again.

I just made it tonight. I did use Romano instead of Swiss and not the whole amount of Gouda ... It's expensive.  I added a few ingredients, chicken, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes.  This is why I am giving it 3 stars.  It is grainy or pasty.  It's not smooth, like for example the Alfredo sauce out of a jar. How do you get it smooth?  Help please this is an amazing recipe!

We used twice as much noodles and didn't have bread crumbs, so we improvised with crushed cereal. The extra noodles didn't take away from the sauce at all. It worked out awesome.

I'm a huge fan of smoked Gouda and I guess it didn't come through strongly enough for me.  It calls for a large and expensive amount, too.  I think I'll just keep my smoked Gouda on a cracker.  I thought this was a nice, cheesy mac and cheese, but I've had better.  I don't like spicy food, so I left out the cayenne pepper... maybe that was my failing.  If I were to make this again, I would incorporate some mustard for a bit of zing.

Made this almost exactly the way the author wrote it (just swapped swiss cheese for Gruyere) and it was overall okay. The consistency was fairly grainy and I wouldn't include the parmesan cheese in the mix again - I would just use it for the topping. One bonus is that this reheats really, really well and makes a ton!

Made about 2/3 of the recipe and it was good! ... don't think you need as much topping as the recipe calls for ... could use some more salt and if I didn't have kids, I'd add a little kick. Will seem like there's too much sauce, but thickens up nicely in the oven. Used ff evaporated milk as I had some to use up.

This was AMAZING!! I used twisty noodles instead of elbow macaroni -- just for fun -- but other than that I kept everything the same and it was fantastic! I was worried the cheese sauce wasn't thick enough, but after it cooked it was a perfect consistency. My dad is a picky eater and I made this for my whole family and they all loved it, including my Dad! Definitely will be cooking this again!

Very yummy, just kinda expensive.  Definately going to reduce the amount of cayenne pepper as suggested by other's next time around.  I am going to try with cheese ends as suggested by another next time around.

Really good, a nice twist on tradional Mac & Cheese. Need to add salt and pepper. I don't like spicy so, I halved the cayenne pepper and that was the perfect amount of kick for me. Definitely going to make this again!
