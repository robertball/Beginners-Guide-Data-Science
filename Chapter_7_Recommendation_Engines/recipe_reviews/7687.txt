Great cake!  Made it for a 50th anniversary party and the wife-a real coconut lover-said it was the best cake she had tasted.  She shared it with another friend and she wants the recipe too.  I did replace the almond extract with vanilla only because I didn't have any and it tasted great.  Great looking too!

This cake did not turn out well for me.  The almond extract far overpowered the coconut taste I was looking forward to.  Probably wouldn't make it again.

Wow!  This really is a "light and beautiful cake", just as it says!  I made this cake for my sister's birthday, and she loved it - and I'm the queen bee at work today, seeing as how I brought left-overs in for all...

I'm not a huge coconut fan; I made this for the cute factor!  It turned out pretty cake-y, but my guests ate it up anyway.  They all said a glass of milk was a must to go along with it.

I gave it 4 stars because it is SO cute for the Easter holiday or any spring time occasion and it is creative yet simple to make.

I tried to make this twice, and both times it fell apart on me.  The almond took away from the rest of the flavors and I felt it was extremely crumbly.

Good~~~my 8yo loved this cake. He helped me decorate it. We used AR decorating suggestions and made a 'bunny cake'. We decorated with candy sprinkles instead of the coconut. Thanks for the Easter memories!

This is a good recipe if you like coconut. But I love it!
So I made the change of using 1/2 cup of creamed coconut instead of the corn syrup & water. I also used coconut extract instead of almond. All I can say is WOW!

The cake turned out fine but it didn't taste good.  Didn't have the sweet taste you expect.  I don't think I will be making it again.  Hope to find a better recipe for Coconut Cake.  The icing was great.

I made this today for Easter and I am sad to say it was a dud. Cake was beautiful but right from the first cut; dry. Taste was dry, crumbly and of flour. Disappointed.

I read the mixed reviews, but decided to try for myself.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The cake was delicious, but crumbly.  It was not dry, it just didn't hold together.  Most of the cake ended up in a pile in the middle of the plate.

Cake just didn't turn out well. Very dry and crumbly. I followed others' suggestions and used vanilla instead of almond extract.  And the flavor was so-so. The icing however was delicious and worked well on an angel food cake I made.
