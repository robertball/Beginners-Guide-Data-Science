This was very good, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and regular pasta instead of multigrain. I just don't think vegetable broth has enough flavor and multigrain pasta just does not taste good. I did add salt to the cauliflower sauce.  My husband is very picky and only likes high calorie foods.and he liked this.

The sauce turned out silky smooth which was impressive but we found it a little bland, as in it needed salt, or something.  Maybe more cheese?  I panfried some mushrooms in butter and also cooked the peppers that way.  The broccoli was boiled as the recipe suggested.  I added some cooked chicken to the pot at the end along with the sauce and veggies and we topped it with more Parmesan.  My teenage son did have a second helping, so maybe it was only me that found it bland.  I would make this again but would play with the salt, pepper and cheese for more flavour.

Kids absolutely loved this, I decided the second time around to fry up the peppers for a little extra flavor.

made this recipe tonight. I am one to taste as I go so I originally found it a bit bland but after some salt and a bit of a mixed herb seasoning it tasted much better. We also used chicken broth instead of veg broth. We also added some shrimp for a heartier dish.

I followed the recipe almost precisely. I was so excited to try it and have another meatless dish in my arsenal. Sadly, to me this tasted like watered-down Alfredo from a frozen tv dinner. Went straight in the garbage.

I used Spaghetti Squash instead of pasta. Was an outstanding substitute.

I thought it was real good, a little dry.  I did add salt, pepper, italian seasoning and extra lemon juice.  and a little shrimp on top.  First time I tried a vegetarian dish like this.  Will make again with just a little more seasoning and more vegatalbe stock.

This was bland. Needs salt, salt, salt. We sprinkled more cheese on top and salted like crazy and it was okay.
