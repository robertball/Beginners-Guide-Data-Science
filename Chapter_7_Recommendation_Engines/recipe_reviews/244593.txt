This recipe is very forgiving if you substitute. I added extra veggies asparagus tips green onion baby spinach matchstick size carrots and doubled the cilantro and coconut milk (but did not double the jalapenos) to compensate for extra veggies. Also used minced ginger in tube regular chicken broth and jar minced garlic. We like our food HOT in New Mexico so I added some red pepper flakes. For serving I topped with fresh chopped cilantro and green onions. A recipe. We loved it and will definitely make again.

I loved this dish. It was packed full of flavor and was not very difficult to make. I did not add eggplant to the dish but other than that did not make an changes. I used a long grain Jasmine rice and it was very simple to make. Next time I make this I will replace the water I cooked the rice in with some coconut milk and Swanson Thai Ginger Flavor Infused Broth for added flavor. By adding the turmeric to the rice it gave it a nice yellow color without changing the flavor of it. This in turn gave it a nice color contrast to the protein. The chicken and vegetables were very easy to cook and the instructions were straight forward. I would add some of the seeds from the jalapenos next time for a little bit of heat (just a personal preference). It was a great dish and one that I will be adding to my recipe box.

I made some changes to lower the calories but still good. I used low salt chicken stick fat free coconut milk and served it over cauliflower rice. I will make it again!
