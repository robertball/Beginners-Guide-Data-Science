I made these for a Sweet 16 birthday party, and they were a complete hit!  Would definitely recommend the recipe.

Used store brand sliders rolls instead of the Hawaiian rolls. Didn’t use seasme seeds personal preference. I just placed the rolls on a foil lined baking sheet, didn’t grease it. Also I used the presliced sandwich pickles instead of hamburger dills. They came out pretty good. I was worried they would be soggy but they weren’t. I will definitely make again maybe add more cheese ?? Great quick meal with leftovers for the weekend!

Made as written except that I used Pepperidge Farm slider buns due to personal preference and to save on the grocery bill. These turned out really good. The one problem I had was that there was not enough sauce. It was thick to begin with so refrigerating it for 20 minutes didn't change the consistency of it. I thought it would melt/run down as it baked but it all stayed on top of the bun which made these a little dry. I recommend doubling the butter/sauce.  Overall a good recipe and one that would go over well at a party.
