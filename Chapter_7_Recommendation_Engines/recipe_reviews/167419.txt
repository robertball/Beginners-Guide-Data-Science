I've made this before and found the results were much better when the softened butter was combined with the herbs and then rubbed under the skin. This way the herb/butter flavour permeated the meat and it was fabulous!!!

I don't know how someone rated this recipe as expensive. That's just...silly.
If you don't like cooking whole chickens, don't do it. I used a large chicken that was marked down. I couldn't fit both oranges inside my chicken with the garlic cloves and butter, so I just used the one. I made the spice mixture and kind of mushed the rosemary and thyme in my hands to not only break up the spices but to bring out the flavor. I took the suggestions of other cooks and roasted it breast down in the beginning and just flipped it near the end with the foil off, to make it pretty and brown. This made for extremely moist and tender breast pieces. I asked my husband to pick out a roast chicken and I admit that I was skeptical at first. It turned out great.
I plan on keeping the carcass and juice and making chicken broth. For your money,
oranges are always cheap as is garlic and spices. Using the carcass to make chicken broth, you really stretch your money. You could even half the butter and use homemade broth like I did and still come out ahead. This recipe is great! I'd make this again, no question.
Great job, Nellie.

Even better if you cook the chicken upside down until 20 mins before then end of cooking time (approx).

I love to make a roast chicken. That being said, I made some adjustments that made this even better. I zested about a teaspoon of the orange peel then combined it with the herbs and softened butter and smooshed it under the skin. I added the orange halves to the clean cavity. I skipped the broth altogether and dry roasted on a rack while covered with foil at 400 degrees. You will have to calculate time based on the size of your bird. I uncovered the bird the last 30 minutes to brown. Even without the broth, there were alot of juices in the pan, so I put them in a small pan and reduced them to create a nice glaze for serving. Yummy! I have done a similar recipe using lemons for years and truthfully they are both great.

I made this recipe using a Capon which is a Rooster. It tasted faboulous, I used Coarse sea salt and I used dry spices, that I had on hand used 1/2 of the butter and I poked holes into the Chicken skin with a fork then I rubbed the salt and spices into the skin, then I drizzled with orange juice and drizzled with butter put in a turkey oven bag and cooked it. If you put your meat in a oven bag then you don't have to baste. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I just used this recipe and substituted lemons with the oranges, because I didn't have any oranges... My children devoured it. It was great!!! I also added chopped potatoes around the sides after boiling them from about 10 minutes. mmm-mmm-good!!! :-)

Very nice roast chicken! I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup melted and skipped the 'under-skin' step (I know a lot of people swear by this, but I've done it both ways and don't buy it,) and used rubbed sage since I didn't have any fresh. Great orange and herb flavor - cooking time was right on. Thanks for the recipe Nellie!!!

Wow this recipe was exceptional. The whole family nearly ate their plates. I did make a few adjustments, I used halved garlic under the skin with smart balance spread & added a few extra spices. Instead of broth I used 2 cups of water and added the remaining sliced garlic and melted smart balance to it. Turned out delicously. Will be trying this recipe with my Thanksgiving turkey.

This is a really good recipe that produces a flavorful and juicy chicken. I did make a few changes--1. Always use chicken STOCK instead of chicken broth. It is much more flavorful and is better for basting.2. I did not have the fresh herbs, so I liberally sprinkled a dried italian seasoning all over the chicken.3. Definitely put the butter under the skin, but skip the melted butter over the top if you use the chicken stock.4. I like this chicken with little red potatoes, carrots, and celery, so I just place them around the chicken in the stock and they cook along with it.  **To the users who had trouble with the chicken "boiling in the juices" instead of roasting---Always roast chicken in a roasting pan with a rack that lifts them up above the juices. It is a very worthwhile investment!!!

Very good and very easy!  The orange flavor was very slight - I would have wished for a slightly stronger flavor.

Best chicken I ever cooked. I took the advice of one review and added the herbs to softened butter before putting it under the skin. then some herbs on top. Also, I cranked the oven to 425* for the first 45 minutes then down to the recommended 350*. Even the leftovers were still moist and delicious 2 days later!  Thumbs way up on this one. Thanks!

This was delicious! After reading the reviews, I mixed the butter with some of the herbs, the garlic and the zest of one orange before pushing under the skin, and cooked breast side down to start with. The cooking time was perfect, and the sauce created from the broth, juice, butter and chicken juices was great. Definitely will make this again

Forget the oven.  Stuff the bird with the citrus and put it on the rotissery.  The juice seeping thru the bird glazes the chicken.  We used tangerines off the tree.  Even sweeter.

Expected a burst of orange flavor but it just wasn't there. I am big zester and should have zested the oranges and placed the zest under the skin. Mmm, next time.

I'm not a big fan of fruity meat, but this turned out really well. The combination of herbs and citrus was fragrant without being overwhelming. I roasted carrots in with the chicken, and they were also especially tasty. Thanks, Nellie!

I've made this one twice now, and both times have been dissatisfied with the outcome. I have come to the conclusion that I don't like to put things inside my birds before cooking them, because the thigh temps out right long before the bird is ACTUALLY done, so I have (both times) wound up having to re-cook the bird after my husband started carving it. The taste and juiciness are fantastic, as is the sauce left in the pot (thickened with flour, skimmed, boiled, and whisked into gravy). I'd recommend this recipe, because the flavor is great, but only with the caveat of "it needs longer to cook than you'd think". Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! This was a huge success in my house. I roasted the chicken with the breast down for the majority of the cooking time as suggested in previous reviews. Then flipped it over and roasted it breast up for the last 30 minutes to brown and crisp up the skin. I found this to be a very cost effective meal as well. I purchased 3 small chickens for $12, and other than the oranges, had all the ingredients in my pantry/fridge or in my herb garden.  This is well worth the effort and time. A great family meal served with roast veggies, salad and homemade biscuits.

This was the best roasted chicken I've ever had!  I made some preparation changes, but kept the basic recipe the same.  I mixed the butter, garlic and herbs together and then put it UNDER the skin like others suggested (we don't eat the skin, so I wanted the flavor to be on the chicken itself).  I then cooked it upsidedown, covered in foil until the last 35 min or so.  Came out great!  I will absolutely make this again.

So easy and good!! I found that if you cut up one of the oranges and add it to the broth, there's more of an orange taste and better for the basting!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Lots of effort for an OK result.  The chicken was moist but rather bland.  If I make again, will add spices and salt.

Yum, this was a really tasty chicken! I used about 3 Tablespoons smart balance instead of the butter, and I mixed the herbs with the smart balance to put under the skin. I also substituted olive oil instead of the melted butter, and drizzled it on top. I probably only used about 1/4 C. Thanks, Nellie!

I thought tis was good.  The second time made it I I made an orange herb butter first.  I ested the the oranges and stripped the leaves off the herbs and chopped them very fine, then mixed it all into the butter.  I rolled the butter into a log and let it setup.  I did it this way because I love having different butters to use on foods after I roast them.  This mix worked well on Salmon the next day.  I love the curliers in Nellie's hair!

My daughter basically makes this recipe, but she uses lemons instead.  She pricks the lemons with a fork or something sharp before putting them inside the bird with onions. She also rubs olive oil on the outside skin, sprinkles it with sea salt, and lets it sit for a while before she roasts it.  I don't think she adds any stock to the pan and usually has plenty of juices.  It is to die for!!

After buying all the ingredients, this recipe wasn't worth the cost or effort.  I'm not one who likes carving a cooked chicken either though. The taste was ok, definately better than Walmarts rottiserrie chicken, just very expensive and time consuming.

This recipe is a great place to start!  After reading a lot of reviews, I mixed the herbs, garlic, and orange zest into softened butter and rubbed all over the birds,  inside the skin and all around in the cavity (I didn't bother with anything except brushing with butter on the outside of the skin).  I shoved tons of orange into my bird, including inside the skin up between the wings and thighs.  I roasted breast-side down until the last 20 min (took about two hours for two 4 lb chickens).  When they first came out of the oven, the orange smell was really strong, and I worried.  But the orange flavour was very subtle in the meat.  The chickens turned out falling-off-the-bone tender and juicy!  The white meat was more moist than some dark meat I've had.  VERY pleased with my first attempt at roasting.  This is a "keeper."

This was very simple and straightforward to pull together. I used a few tablespoons of olive oil instead of the cup butter and it still tasted great.

This chicken turned out to be a mess for me! It almost seemed to be boiling in the broth; never did turn brown & crispy on the outside like I like it. Furtermore, the skin tore when I was putting the butter pieces in it so all ended up in the broth. I overcooked it at close to 2 hrs just trying to get it brown and done. The flavor was OK, but I'm so glad I didn't have any guests the night this was served!

Was not a popular item at our dinner table. To much butter used. To much stock in pan causing a not very acceptable bird. I mixed herbs with butter for under the skin and that did not work very well either.

I used grapeseed oil rather than butter for dietary reasons. It was a bit too "herb" and not enough "orange" for my liking.

This was a great recipe!  My hubby and kids loved it.  I did make a few minor changes.  I added some garlic, herbs and orange zest under the skin with the butter.  Also, instead of 1 cup of broth, I added 1/2 cup of broth and 1/2 cup of white wine.  It was really tender and full of flavor.

This made for a super moist chicken that tasted really good. I was a little sad that the orange didn't really give it much zing but still worth it!!

I roasted a 6 lb bird and found it juicy and delicious.  It did take a bit longer,and I had to continually baste and add extra broth to the pan.  I also followed the advice of others and blended in dried Italian seasoning - mostly dried versions of the fresh herbs in the recipe, and orange zest to the butter before putting it under the skin. I also added fresh-squeezed orange juice to the deglazed pan juices just before serving with the chicken.

This was my first time doing a whole chicken and it wasn't too difficult. It  smelled amazing and tasted great, too. It wasn't as citrus-y as I had hoped, but it could have been the oranges I used.  I coated the butter with pressed garlic and dried rosemary before putting it under the skin.   There was also hardly any juice to suck up with the baster for my particular chicken. I ended up doing it only twice instead of every 30 minutes.

This was very tender and moist! I cut the amount of butter way back to 1/4 c. total. I put 2 Tbs. cut in pieces under the skin and drizzled another 2 Tbs. over chicken before roasting. The left over meat I used to make a chicken pie. Will be making this again.

This is delicious.  Made one small change, I grated the zest off one orange, mixed it with the butter and put this under the skin.  It did add a lot more of an orange flavour to the chicken.  It is very moist and was a hit with my family.  I think it would be a lovely dinner for a special occasion.  Served mine with hasselback potatoes and fresh asparagus.

Perhaps I used too much broth, but the chicken was almost swimming in liquid, therefore only the top became crispy skin (which I prefer).

Good recipe.  Easy and fairly quick to prepare.  My daughter, who doesn't like anything good for her, really went to town on it, especially the gravy from the chicken juice.  Next time, I will peel the oranges.

I basically make the same recipe only useing lemons or limes instead of the orange. I also put celery, onion and carrots inside the bird before cooking.  I also sometimes use olive oil rather than butter.

I have baked whole chickens before, but this was the best I have ever made. Differences: It took a little over 2 hours to bake, added marjoram, minced all herbs and placed under skin and in cavity. Really great! I usually stuff birds with a heavy combo of bread, egg, dried cherries, and turkey sausage but this was very light and made the chicken very moist. I will do this again, thank you.

I really liked the flavour in this recipe!  I was quite generous with all seasonings and it was really tasty.  I took the advice of another rater and rubbed the herbs under the skin with the butter.  Served it with the allrecipes.com recipe 'Broccoli in Roast Chicken Drippings' and wild rice and it was great!  Will make it again for sure.

I have made this a few times, it always turns out moist. sometimes use lemons instead of oranges and always baste it with a mixture of olive oil and melted butter with extra herbs, and a splash of orange juice.

I tried this last night and it was awesome.  I just happened to have all the herbs growing outside, except for the sage, so I used (rubbed) sage powder.  I used mandarin oranges because I had them on hand and needed to use them up.  Like some other reviewers, I chopped the herbs and mixed them with the butter before rubbing on the chicken.  Everyone loved this dish, and from now on when I roast chicken, this will be the way to go!

I grated the orange peel added it to the herbs and mashed it with softened butter then stuffed it under the skin. I put potato, carrots, small onion in the pan with chicken. I sliced some of the orange and put on top of the breast with tooth picks

Yep!!!  Used the orange herb brine recipe that is on my profile and also used this recipe in the baking process... Wonderful for chicken, turkey or cornish game hens!  You won't believe how well orange or citrus goes with poultry!  Just wonderful.  Orange in my opinion is the winner with lime in 2nd and lemon 3rd...

This is one of my my family's absolute favorite meals!  I took some of the reviewers advice and mix the herbs with the butter and then put it on the chicken breast both over and under the skin.  It comes out wonderfully flavourful and everyone in the family gobbles it up!  We usually have mashed potatoes with the wonderful gravy that the drippings make, and which ever veggies we happen to have on hand.  Excellent addition to the site and thanks so much for sharing Nellie!

Very good. I didn't have sprigs of herbs, I had flakes and leaves. The orange kept the chicken juicy.

Not a lot of orange flavor...hubby said he couldn't tell the orange was in it. I did put the herbs in the butter and under the skin so the chicken and not the skin got the flavor.

We found this recipe pretty tasty.  It could of been better if it had some more orange flavoring.

Fabulous!  Perfectly moist and flavorful!  Followed recipe exactly - wouldn't change a thing other than mine seemed to be browning a bit too quickly so I placed a piece of foil very loosely on top for the last 20 minutes or so.  Thanks, Nellie! This was perfect!

I am a vegetarian (or flexitarian rather) who has never cooked any sort of meat other than ground beef.  For my sister's birthday I decided to cook dinner for my entire family and this is what I settled on.  A little daunting at first for a first-timer like me, the recipe was actually really simple and straightforward.  I followed the recipe as is and it turned out fantastic.  I even tasted it just to see what it turned out like and actually liked it so much that I had to have a second bite.  I may eventually make this one again but since I don't eat meat in my own home, it's not going to be for quite a while.  One note:  for someone like me who has never done something like this before, it would have been helpful to know to wash the chicken and pull out any feathers that might still be lurking.  Had my sister not been there watching me for entertainment value, I wouldn't have known this little tidbit of info.  Thankfully she told me BEFORE I started getting the rest of the ingredients involved.

My husband and I were very pleased with this chicken dish.  I also made a few substitutions, just because of what I had at home.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh, limes instead of orange(didn't have any oranges), and used less butter, only about 4 pats under 4 cuts in the skin.  This recipe was delicious!  I cooked carrots in the dish around the chicken and added stovetop stuffing the last 30min.  So good!  Can't wait to try it with an orange!

This turned out really well for my first roast chicken in the oven. I usually use the slow cooker.  I didn't have oranges so I poured some orange juice over it and stuffed it with apples.

Couldn't get whole chicken, so made it with 4 lbs chicken leg quarters.  Used dried spices with no issues, and also grated and rubbed the orange zest into the skins.  The quarters also didn't need the butter rubbed under the skin... cooked covered for about an hour at 425, then uncovered and brushed with olive oil for the last 20 min.  I should have used chicken broth in the pan... the orange juice ended up burning.  That aside, this came out delicious and was devoured.  Good recipe!

So good. Used one extra orange, squeezed over the chx and quartered the rind threw it in the baking dish. Cooked the garlic in the melted butter with some herbs to boost all that flavor! cooked with carrots and celery in the same pan.

Not worth the time, effort, or expense. 
I tend to buy roasters when they are on sale - it's a good family meal.  This time I got an 8 pound oven stuffer roaster at 99 cents a pound.  Then I had to buy fresh sage, thyme, and rosemary, in order to use four sprigs of each (since the chicken was twice the size), and a pound of butter, and two oranges.  So now my $8 chicken costs more like $18, so this is no longer a pocketbook-friendly meal. I read some of the reviews, and I ended up using only a quarter pound of butter, which was more than enough, even for my 8 pound chicken, and I zested the orange and put zest and herbs under the skin along with herbs and juice on the outside.  My husband found this recipe, and decided the result was not worth the amount of time I had put into it.  The rest of the family agreed.
I've cooked roast chicken for half the time upside down since I put a chicken in upside down by mistake years ago.  I always end up with a nice juicy chicken that is low in fat and tasty.  Add a few dry herbs, and maybe rub a bit of butter over the top to brown it.  This didn't even smell good while cooking - the herbs laid across the bird got brown and dry and looked awful. So I don't really think it even rates 3 stars, but I can't say I actually disliked it.  But I won't bother making it again.

This was awesome! Best roast chicken I've ever made. After reading the reviews I added orange zest and ground up the herbs and put everything under the skin. I also used a little more chicken broth because I had a larger pan and added potatoes and carrots. I accidentally forgot the garlic but this came out so good it didn't need it.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I modified it slightly, less butter, crushed garlic & onion with the butter and juice under the skin. I used additional juice - about a cup - and water instead of the chicken broth.

I made some changes.. I mixed a few tablespoons of the juice and salt and pepper with the butter to put under the skin. I also mixed some of the orange zest, herbs, garlic and seasoning in Duke's in leu of the melted butter and spread that ono the outside of the chicken (it may sound odd but it is a little trick I found that adds more flavor and makes a perfect skin) then seasoned with salt, pepper, red pepper, and soked paprika. I also added sprigs of herbs with the oranges in the cavity, as well as tucked in by the thighs.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to follow.  Minor difficulty getting the butter under the skin, but not insurmountable.  VERY tasty and juicy.  I added a few cloves into the orange rind/pulp in the cavity.

I put small potatoes and boiling onions in after 1st 30 min. It was all wonderful and easy. The flavor added to potatoes and onions was a hit.  Will make as a regular item in this house

Very flavorful.  Used less butter and mixed fresh herbs with butter under the skin..  The gravy was very good with the herbs in it too.

a good starter herb chicken - maybe fugue on the theme to suit your personal tastes. i always enjoy something simple and healthy like a good lean protein source. always preferring savory over sweet. my mouth is watering just writing about it!

This chicken turned out very moist and delicious. I used half the butter and mashed it with herbs and garlic, put about 3/4 of that under the skin and rubbed the rest over the bird. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my go-to chicken recipe. The meat always comes out tender and flavorful. I have a rosemary bush in my front garden, so I always have some fresh, and the herb butter and orange glaze makes this recipe absolutely mouthwatering. I don't have fresh thyme or sage available, so I make an herb butter with dried herbs and place it under the skin instead of pats.

I followed the directions, this did not have an orange taste at all, and I baked it for over 3 hours, with increasing temperature twice and it was not done. Cannot recommend.

Great recipe. I used a turkey bag and it came out super moist and delish.  Couldn't  really taste the orange. Maybe next time I will zest the peel and add it to the butter mixture.

This was my first time roasting a whole chicken. It was much easier than I expected. This recipe was really good. I used at least double the amount of fresh herbs. I zested the oranges and mixed it with the butter, herbs, and juice from the oranges, then rubbed it under the skin of the chicken. Only one orange fit in the cavity. I put carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms in the pan around the chicken while it roasted. The chicken was juicy and the flavor of the herbs came through very well, however I couldn't taste much orange. Next time I will just use some orange juice or leave it out all together because it wasn't worth the effort. Overall, it was a very good recipe.  In fact, I would give it a 5 if there was more orange flavor. I can't wait to make stock out of the carcass.

Made this tonight for dinner. My whole family enjoyed this chicken very much.  The chicken 7lbs was extremely moist and had great flavor.  There was not a strong orange taste which was quite alright with us. Just a hint of orange which we enjoyed. Will make again. Thank You for sharing!

Totally changed it up.  Made a basting sauce with brown sugar, juice of two oranges, rosemary, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, balsamic crème and 2 tblsp olive oil.  I let this simmer a bit.  Cut my chicken in half.  GOt the grill ready.  Salt & peppered the chicken, put it on the grill, and part way thru cooking I started basting with the sauce.  Fabulous!

Almost perfect.  It smells GREAT when cooking.  Gave it 4 stars - a little too much rosemary for our taste and next time it needs a little more orange.

Truly a masterpiece of chicken! The only thing I did to 'spice' it up was put chopped onions and celery in the broth for the chicken to roast over! Kudos for this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

I only used half of the butter it calls for and I think it was plenty.  I also added some balsalamic vinegar, but I don't think it was enough to make a big difference in the flavors.  It came out very moist and tender; I cooked it for 3 hours, and only had it uncovered for the last 20 minutes to give it the nice browned color.

This was a great recipe!  I followed suggestions to use the zest of two oranges and mixed it with the butter and fresh herbs (any leftover herb butter would be great on salmon the next day).  I will most definitely keep and use this recipe again!
