Very delicious!  I chilled the batter and marmalade overnight and prepared the shrimp the next day.  Even though I lost coconut in the oil, a lot was still on the shrimp.  Chilling is the secret.  For the reviewer who said it wasn't sweet enough, try adding 1/2c of the coconut to the batter, plus 2 T sugar and 1/2 t salt.  The dipping sauce I used was 1/2 c orange marmalade, 2 t mustard, 1 t prepared horseradish, dash salt, and honey to taste.  Yes, it's laborious, but worth the effort for a great recipe like this.

Yes indeed, this recipe really does taste like the Outback's.  I followed the orange marmalade/horseradish sauce/mustard (I used Grey Poupon) recommendation for the dipping sauce and it was excellent.  To speed solidification, I placed shrimp in the freezer for fifteen minutes instead of the refrigerator for thirty minutes.  As many others have indicated, I pan fried the shrimp with exceptional results.  The browing only took maybe two minutes per side.  They looked beautifully golden brown and I lost very little coconut in the frying process.  My wife rarely compliments my cooking - and she said these were GREAT!

GREAT! However, I did pulse the coconut lightly in a food processor (previously mentioned) and it did adhere to the battered shrimp better (good tip).  Also, since I like things a tad more seasoned, I put some cayenne pepper,paprika,garlic&onion powder, dried thyme&oregano into the 3/4 C flour (before dividing) and tossed seasoning directly on shrimp prior to coating. Plus, the larger the shrimp, the less time this takes..but it's worth the trouble even if you use medium shrimp. I wouldn't go smaller than that. After dredging/coating shrimp, chill until set, or freeze for 10 to 15 minutes. I've made these, froze and stored for another day and they fried up just as good that way too. If you use large/jumbo shrimp you can hold these in oven at 300 to finish cooking so coconut doesn't burn (or to keep warm until all are done). I also used the marmalade dipping sauce recommended which was really good! The batter itself w/out coconut works for fried onion rings or mushrooms as well, although I rolled those in Panko crumbs vs coconut flakes. Saved this recipe!

I bought a bag of tail on shrimp at Costco because we just moved to a beach city and shrimp sounded so good, but I wasn't sure what else to do with them other than the obvious easy shrimp cocktail dish, but that's like an appetizer and I wanted to make a dinner for me and my husband, ya know, something more filling.  I thought the task of making coconut shrimp sounded too elaborate and a nightmare for me because I have the passion for cooking but not neccessarily the experience.  I was wrong.  Making this was easy and fun.  I was surprised at the amount of coconut breading stays on the shrimp too.  The key is the refrigeration time to get it cold enough so that the coconut dough sticks to the shrimp.  I mixed both dijon and regular mustard with the orange marmalade and horseradish sauce.  The result was delicious, great for a beginner too who wants to break out of the macaroni box. I guess it's not really all that good for me cuz it's fried, not something I'd make all the time, but every once in a while for a special occasion.  Definitely a recipe I will make again, Saved.  Thanks.  Hope this review was helpful!

OMG OMG OMG  These are SOO good.  I cannot believe how well they turned out for me.  I do not have a deep fryer, I just used a frying pan.  I think the secrets are to make sure and let the battered shrimp chill for the 30 minutes, and to make sure your oil is good and hot.  I piled on the coconut and did not have a problem w/the batter sticking.  I did add some cayenne and some garlic to the batter, and added the beer slowly until I had the right consistency (used ALMOST all of it the recipe called for and I'm sure it would have been fine with all of it).

These are just like the Outback's coconut shrimp.  I can't wait to make dinner with the coconut shrimp and the Aussie chicken on this site.  Awesome!  Thank you thank you thank you.

absolutely the best! far better than Red Lobster and Sam's frozen version, even better than the ultimate Outback Steakhouse.  used another reviewer's recipe for sauce...together, can't be beat.  contrary to some reviewers, we love coconut and piled it on...also I began with cooked shrimp which may have cut down on fry time thus not apt to burn coconut as easily.  THANK YOU for this recipe.

I printed off this recipe months ago but have been leary trying it because my boyfriend is not fond of coconut.  However, recently at a well-known restaurant, he surprised everyone by ordering this as an appetizer...and LOVED them.  Immediately I knew I could try this recipe! I'm sorry I waited so long because it was sooooo good! I used med-size shrimp (it was all I had available but the large shrimp is now on my grocery list for this recipe's repeat performance)which made it a tad more difficult to do all the dipping.  Also, I followed the reviewer who said to use marmalade, mustard, honey, horseradish and salt for the dipping sauce.  Delightful!! Thank you Linda for posting this wonderful and appreciated dinner recipe! I would recommend it to anyone! It just as good as the restaurant version!!

We had our daughter Tylers' birthday party this past weekend and she made these as part of our appetizers. The batter seemed a little thin, so I added more flour to get the right consistency. I was so anxious to try these, but they ended up flying off the plate! Everyone raved about them, so I guess they were amazing. Tyler placed three shrimp onto wooden skewers and then coated with the batter and coconut. Hubby Drew fried these right on the skewers in our deep fryer. For the dip I subbed the orange marmalade with pineapple preserves. Well, at least I can say that the dipping sauce was great! Thanks so much Linda!!!!

TIPS NOT MENTIONED AND SECRET TO COCONUT STICKING: The chilling is a must, but what goes with that from my experience making this is ...after you take it out, use your fingers to mold/glue on the coconut to the shrimp after it's been in the fridge for at least 15 minutes (but put back in fridge so it can continue to meld together).  Just press down on each shrimp that is covered with coconut & the batter that has had time to meld onto the coconut will catch any lose flakes.  I do this each time and never have any problems.  Coconut burns easily, so I only cook about a small batch at a time so I can monitor their progress and flip faster.  The dip posted by the first review is EXCELLENT (1/2C orange marmalade, 2t mustard, 1t prepared horseradish, dash salt & honey to taste).  Fancy dinner to impress your family and guests yet so easy! What's even better is you can prepare ahead, and then cook the shrimp right before you eat since it's finished in a matter of minutes! FWIW, I hated shrimp before I had this recipe. ;)

These shrimp were easy to make and better than the ones at a very exclusive restaurant my husband and I frequent. They were also a hit with my kids. Excellent recipe!

Absolutely fabulous flavor!  I also followed the marmalade recipe which was the perfect dipping sauce.  I baked these on a cookie sheet at 400 degrees instead of frying and they came out perfectly!  Will definitely make again!

I've made this so many times now that it has become my "signature" dish. One thing I do that differs from the recipe is that after I peel the shrimp, I douse them in garlic powder then put them back in the fridge for a few hours (or overnight). Refrigeration of battered shrimp is key to success.  I have made them the day before cooking and it works well. I batter large batches at a time, then put some on a cookie sheet lined with parchment and covered with plastic wrap and freeze.  After frozen solid, I transfer to freezer bags. When I'm ready to use them, I place shrimp on a cookie sheet in fridge to thaw.  Perfect!

Update to Below:
Tried this recipe again, but used three different oils to fry them in.  The first was coconut, the olive oil, then butter.  I didn't take time to remove the dairy from the butter fat, but the hands-down, no question winner was butter.  Since the dairy was still in it I had to fry at 350 instead of 375. Using butter they tasted much more like the ones we have a upscale restaurants. 

Earlier Review:
Turned out great!  My wife said that the peanut oil I used was a bit strong flavored.  I read a review on this recipe from another person who said they would use coconut oil next time.  Me too.  I wonder what some Captain Morgan spiced rum instead of the beer would do?  I might also try frying them in dairy-removed butter fat.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I used 1/3 cup coconut rum and 1/3 cup coconut milk in place of the beer.  It was a real big hit tonight at our New Years Eve party.  I made the sauce that was recommended, orange marmalade, horseradish, and honey dijon mustard. They went together perfectly.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Made these tonight for a dinner party and thought they turned out great!  Nothing against Baker's brand coconut but the "moistest" flakes actually were too sticky - used Mounds brand and the coating went MUCH smoother.  Made dip with 1/2 marmalade, 2t mustard, 1t horseradish.  Well worth the work - which really wasn't that much!

I used jumbo shrimp, fried in a saute pan and had no trouble with coconut falling off.  However, the shrimp were a little bland.  If I make them again, will try adding salt and perhaps some thai spices.

Love this recipe!!! I'm making it again this evening and went online to print out the recipe. I started reading the reviews as I like to do, and wanted to say something that I didnt see mentioned in previous reviews. That is that you can definately freeze them! I made a huge batch since I knew it would be time consuming and messy and froze and ate them 2 weeks later and the last of them 3 weeks later. It was even more enjoyable since they were ready to go. 
Just be sure to refridgerate for at least an hour and be careful not to crowd in the freezer until frozen completely.

I used rinsed raw frozen shrimp, (31-40 cnt, per lb size) after battering the frozen shrimp I left them on the counter for about 20 min. then fried. They turned out perfectly. The shrimp was nice and tender and cooked through. Thinking about serving them at family game night. Great for a party!

OMG!  These are no less than incredible.  I used a 2 lb. bag of raw 31-40 shrimp from Costco, added an additional 1/4 cup flour to the egg beer batter, followed everything else.  Used a Presto 12-cup deep fryer set at 350 degrees, with about 20 shrimp per batch(no need to turn) - - about 3 minutes per batch.  Dipping sauce was Apricot Spreadable Fruit, Sweet Chili Sauce, honey, dijon mustard and creamy horseradish (no need to measure, just use amounts based on individual taste)  Devoured in no time flat!

PERFECT!!!  I highly recommend butterflying the shrimp to get the full resturant experience.
To ensure the batter stayed on I let the shrimp sit an hour before frying.

OMG!  Too good!  Use with Chicken, too.  I make a dip of warm apricot jam and stir in a teaspoon of djon mustard.  Also, can bake at 400 instead of frying to save calories! May want to "tent it" initially with some foil as the sugary coconut can burn faster than the chicken will cook!

This is a great recipe. I did substitute the beer for coconut milk because it was easier for me to get being under age. It made the coconut flavor really stand out. I can't stop eating them!

Excellent recipe.  Next time I'd season the batter with a little salt and ceyene pepper, though

This coconut shrimp was excellent.  I used 1/2  cup seville orange marmalade, 1/4 cup dijon mustard, 1/4 cup honey, and 1/8 cup horseradish for the dipping sauce. Debra Rose

EXCELLENT...These come out so good. My family was so impressed as was I. 
They were good enough to be served in a gourmet restaurant. I will make these for special occasions. 

I tried making these again and had extra so I made coconut chicken breasts also. They were superb. They taste wonderful alone or with a variety of dipping sauces.

Ten stars! The only change I made was to use apple juice instead of beer in the batter. They were so delicious!

NEED I ADD TO THIS?  Have always been afraid to try coconut shrimp after one disaterous attempt but this is the easiest and best recipe around. Being lazy I used a spiced up pancake batter to coat (after dipping in flour and putting in frig for 30 min or more). Didn't lose any coconut or batter when frying in skillet on top of stove. David ate 18 all by himself.  Freezes (uncooked) great.

These shrimp are amazing and I am asked to make them for many functions....they're always gone at the end of the night.  I recommend refrigerating them for about 15-20min after battering and before frying...this helps the batter stick.  I also cook large batches at once and freeze them.  Simply heat from frozen at 350 for about 20min (give or take)....and they're still delicious!  I also serve with a marmalade/curry dip sauce.  It's a mixture of ranch dressing, orange marmalade, curry and hot sauce...DELICIOUS!

DELICIOUS!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 cup beer + 1/2 cup coconut rum and a teaspoon of sugar in the beer batter.  Made these last night for hubby's birthday and he was raving "Tastes just like Outback!"  Thanks Lindav10 for a great recipe!!

This recipe is just as good as (if not better!) then a certain famous restaurant that starts with "Out" and ends in "Back". Perfect batter, and I personally like the sugared coconut, it gives it a nice sweet flavor that is not too overpowering. I have actually made this recipe dozens of times and altered it sometimes. One thing I will say is DO NOT SKIP THE REFRIGERATION PART!!! Your batter will not stick to the shrimp if you do. The orange marmalade, spicy mustard, and horseradish also very much remind of the restaurant's sauce and is equally good. I've yet to have a complaint over this recipe, unless someone just doesn't like coconut or shrimp!

This is a great basic recipe for coconut shrimp.  Few things I want to point out due to the bad reviews,,,, Season your flour. The purpose of the flour is that it makes the batter stick. I recommend chilling the batter in the fridge before dipping.  This helps it set up and will help it stick to the shrimp.  Remember, you don't need to cake on the coconut, so don't waste to much time fiddling with the shrimp.  Chilling the shrimp after being dipped is a must.  The whole dipping and prepping the shrimp to cook can be done the day before, or if its a weekend, do it in the morning time.  I made two batters, one with the beer, and one with coconut milk that some reviewers used. Ended up liking the coconut milk mixture best, added a teaspoon of baking soda though to help it fluff, with the beer one, the fizz helps it fluff already.  With the left over beer batter, I made onion rings.  Also, I seasoned the beer batter with some salt and other spices for the rings.  I only fry once in awhile, so when I do it, I Really do it.  To serve the shrimp, I used a sweet chili dipping sauce that I bought at the store.  Its sweet and has just enough of a bite.  Gives it a bit of a thai zing.  It was a hit at my cocktail party, as were the rings.  Don't let the shrimp overcook.  Golden, not golden brown.  Nothing makes shrimp bland quicker than overcooking it.  This is an amazing base recipe, just remember to adjust this, or any other recipe to your liking.

Loved them! I didn't have beer so I just used milk and they still came out great. We used previously frozen shrimp and thawed them under cool running water. Def have to refrigerate after putting the batter on.

Delicious!  We grated our own fresh coconut, which worked well because it stayed on better than the long shreds you can purchase.

So worth the mess!  Did not change a thing.  Fantastic, especially with the reccommended dipping sauce.  I used 1/4 cup each: Horseradish, orange marmalade and dijon mustard.

This is fantastic! Light and delicious. I used unsweetened flaked coconut. The dipping sauce is wonderful too. You can make it zestier or sweeter, depending on your taste. Takes about 2-3 min per side in our deep fryer at 345 degrees. Made a sauce also using fresh mango, mustard and a capful of cider vinegar (in the food processor). Afterwards added some freshly cracked pepper. Delicious. I use the beer batter for frying other fish (ie perch) by dipping in the flour, the beer batter and then panko bread crumbs. Wonderful!

Do these beauties really need another 5 star rating! The only thing i will add to the many rave reviews is that if you are trying to stay away from fried food, these can be baked in a hot oven (i cooked jumbo shrimp at 450 for maybe 12 minutes, flipping once) Okay, so the fried method tastes better(i tried them both ways) but baked is still very good.

Almost perfect! Coconut should be mixed with equal parts of bread crumbs. They will enhance coconut adhesion and crunch. Then its a five star.

Excellent!- better than Red Lobster's which I love.  I also used coconut milk instead of beer.  They take a little time to prepare but are worth the effort!  I used another recipe for Red Lobster's dipping sauce.

I loved this recipe.  It is very similar to the ones at Red Lobster.  I used a different dipping sauce consisting of pina colada mix (liquid) and sour cream in almost equal parts.  It made it more carribean.  Careful the pina colada sauce is sweet.

I used this batter recipe for fish tacos! I couldn't find a coconut fish taco recipe anywhere.  Maybe im the only person that thinks coconut fish tacos sound like a good idea.  But they turned out great!  I would suggest using a lighter beer and some lime as i used a darker beer and the flavor was a bit overwhelming.

This was an amazing recipe and fairly easy to make (just don't forget to account for the time in the refrigerator). The dipping sauce recommended by 1hound_1husband is: 1/2 c orange marmalade, 2 t mustard, 1 t prepared horseradish, dash salt, and honey to taste. I added more mustard, horseradish and at least 1 t of honey to make it a bit spicier and because it tasted too much like plain orange marmalade. My family loved all of it. I also made it into a main dish rather than an appetizer by making Betsy's Mandarin Orange Salad which was a great mix because of the orange and lightness of the salad.

FANTASTIC!  I didn't have beer so I used milk instead. I flavored the flour with a little garlic powder and cayenne.  These were amazing. This dipping sauce is a must: 1/2 c orange marmalade, 2 t mustard, 1 t prepared horseradish!

WOW..This is the first time I have made this & it is outstanding.  I did make it up ahead before frying & left in fridge about 2 hours. I fryed in a fry pan as I do not own a fryer. They were great. No problems what so ever except they are so good they walked off the plate.  I used Stonewall Kitchen Orange,Cranberry Marmalade w/gran mustard & horseradish.
Just great..as good as Out Back.  Thanks All/Reipes.com...you are great.

ok, I know it says shrimp, but I used bite size pieces of chicken and it rocked!!!  It bit of labor, and messy to prepare, but sooooo worth it.  I made the sauce using the orange marmalade, dijon mustard, a bit of honey and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  Too good for words!

My family loved these shrimp.  Even my sceptic teenage daughter had to admit they were better than she thought they would be.  The only thing I did wrong was that I became impatient and didn't wait the entire 30 minutes to refrigerate them.  The shrimp that I had battered last weren't as well coated as the first ones when I fried them because I didn't let them set long enough.  Also, I wish there had been some sort of guidelines for the dipping sauce.  I guessed and it turned out alright, but I am sure that it could have had more zing.  Overall, a keeper and I am sure a new family favorite!!!!

Awesome! A bit labor intensive with all the dipping in the flour then the batter then the coconut but soo worth it. They were really good. I served them with the orange marmalade, spicy brown mustard and orange marmalade. The sauce was a bit spicy, but really went well with the shrimp.

In answer to your question if shrimp should be raw or cooked, it should be RAW

This recipe is delicious!  I have made it twice now and it has been quite the hit.  I made two pounds worth of shrimp for Christmas dinner and it was gone in no time.  I serve it with sweet red chili sauce and it is perfect.  You should definitely give this recipe a try!

These were great shrimp! I used Jumbo, and thought I was going to run out of batter. My bag of frozen shrimp had about 30 so I used all of them. Next time I think using just Large will be fine. I replaced the beer with coconut milk.  I generously coated the shrimp with the batter mixture (added a little cayenne pepper, italian seasoning, and garlic salt) and the batter/coconut didn't fall off at all during cooking. I placed in fridge for about 30 minutes to help the batter stick. I used the orange marmalade dipping sauce another reviewer suggested. Great crowd pleaser recipe. Very fancy presentation!!

This is the best coconut shrimp recipe out there.  It was better then the ones you get at a restaurant.  I lost very little of the coconut when cooking.  The key is to keeping them in the fridge for a while before cooking.  Thanks!!

The shrimp were good, but missing a little something for me.  They were a little bland.  Next time I'll try the powdered sugar dusting suggested by another member.  But I will definately be trying this recipe again!

Amazing! I had a football party last weekend and made these a long with four other recipes from this site. The wing recipe and this one were disappearing faster than i could make them. So good. My go-to fast appetizer now.

Excellent recipe! Made for my sons 16th birthday dinner and he approved! A bit messy and time consuming not to mention the oil gets dirty fast, but worth it. We used regular cocktail sauce and it was delish.

These are Devine! I pan fried on medium high heat, which worked but you have to watch them.  I also added some fresh salsa to the orange marmalade mix which kicked it up. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I made a pound of large shrimp. This was so easy and very tasty. As a dip I mixed Orange Marmalade, coconut and a touch of lime. Was planing on having the shrimp as an appitizer. Next time I will make it as the main course.

Will definitely have to try the suggestions of chilling the batter (felt it was way too runny) and putting the coconut through the food processor when I make these next time. Very tasty, probably should have bothered with pulling out the deep fryer instead of just doing it in a deep skillet.

I am not an experienced cook but this recipe was quick and easy and turned out great for me. Only thing I wish is that they would have recommended a particular beer. I used Schlitz... if I changed anything I probably would experiment w/ others beers.

These are the best we ever had.  I cannot believe how good they were.  I used large shrimp and made sure to chill about an hour before frying.  

No need to go out to a restaurant with the way these came out.  The marmalade dipping sauce adds a nice touch.  I made it with 1/2 cup marmalade and 2 teaspoons of a hot mustard we like.  I'll try the one with horseradish next time.

This was an incredibly easy recipe to make, and everyone loved it! It tastes just like the restaurants. I was surprised at how the batter stuck so well and stayed on the shrimp. The marmalade/horseradish mustard mix is excellent to dip them in.

awesome coconut shrimp! made this for a fathers day bbq as an appetizer and it was such a big hit with everyone.  i made a few slight changes after reading some reviews and it came perfect.  i used half a cup of beer and half a cup of coconut rum (i always have a bottle on hand!) and in the batter i put some coconut flakes that i had chopped up in my food processor and added 2 t-spoons of sugar.  Also instead of rolling in the whole coconut flakes i again used chopped up coconut.  I prepared them the night before and left them in the refrigerator over night. i had no problem at all with lost batter.
again everyone LOVED these-- i used a combo of orange marmalade a little brown mustard and sweet chili sauce as a dip.

Excellent recipe!! I drizzle a tiny bit of honey over the deep fried shrimp when they're done cooking, and they don't even need a sauce. Thanks for this great recipe!!!

This really is an amazing recipe.  I use a fry daddy jr to make them with peanut oil.  We like the sweetened coconut but have tried the non-sweetened as well.  Both are good.  The best coconut though is the finest shred you can get.  If you get bigger flakes the tips burn, so get the smallest that you can.  Also, I have started making a dip from grape jelly and barbecue sauce mixed together.  Everyone loves it.

Excellent recipe and easy to follow.  Only thing is that I didn't taste enough of the sweet coconut.  But I may have overfried the shrimp don't know, but it was a success! Will try again.  Also the marmalade with mustard sauce was excellent!

Love this recipe. I used coconut juice instead of beer and it definitely had the coconut flavor! I also made the orange marmalade sauce - my boyfriend and I loved it. Next time I will try making a raspberry sauce. Can't wait!

Fantastic. Fantastic. Fan. Tastic. Made this tonight for my mother's birthday dinner and she said it was the best coconut shrimp she's ever had. I added a little salt to the batter and served them with a sweet dipping sauce: 8 oz. sour cream, the solids only from a can of cream of coconut, 4 oz. crushed pineapple with juice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

These were pretty good but we weren't wild about them.  I am tempted to give 3 stars but pan-fried the shrimp instead of using a deep frier (I don't have one), perhaps they would have been tastier in a deep frier?

I pan fried the shrimp and they turned out great. I added about 1/4 inch canola oil to a pan and did about 2 1/2 min on each side and they looked beautiful. I also added the extra sugar/coconut to the batter so they would be sweeter and that worked well. I also stuck the shrimp in the freezer for about 20 minutes and I had no problem with the coconut falling off.   I tried out the marmalade dipping sauce that everyone suggested, but in my opinion it didn't taste as good as I would have expected. The flavor was a bit too orange-peely, and not quite what I would be used to having with coconut shrimp. If anyone has any other suggestions for a citrus based sauce that is a little sweeter and more like a restaurant-style dipping sauce, I would love to hear it.  All in all, this was a great recipe. It was time intensive (about an hour), but the shrimp really did turn out well. I'm new to cooking and I didn't botch this, so that was encouraging! :)

EXCELLENT recipe!!  Made these for Christmas Eve(about 72 shrimp, they lasted less than 10 minutes!!)  Didn't have any beer  so I used coke.  They came out perfectly, very crispy and the batter stayed on while frying. Just don't forget the 1st step, dipping them in flour first or the batter won't stick.  For a dipping sauce, I went with the orange marmalade, added mustard, honey, brown sugar and some "Nellie & Joes Famous Key West Lime Juice", I am sure any lime juice will do.   mmmm.....very good.

This was an outstanding recipe and I'm not normally a seafood eater--I found it easy to prepare--I do not have a deep fryer so I just used a frying pan instead. for the sauce I used 1/2 cup of orange marmalade, 1 1/2 tsp horseradish and 2 tsps mustard as someone else suggested--I think it could have used a little more zing but the hubby and kids liked it. This was so good I'm sure I'll be making it again and again. Thanks!!

This was really good, just like everyone said.  I didn't deep fry them, just panfried them, but they were really GOOD.  I didn't use 24 shrimp, just about 14 jumbos, and they used all the coconut up.   I also used a pina colada sauce like they do at the famous Chart House Restaurant.  I won't make them again soon because of my husbands' high cholesterol, but will save this great recipe for a very special occasion....

Wow! This was so good!  I have never had good luck with deep-frying, but this turned out incredibly delicious! One suggestion: chop the coconut in the food processor a little bit first, it sticks better in smaller pieces so you don't lose so much when you fry it. We tried a bunch of dipping sauces with it, and liked sweet and sour sauce and plain raspberry jam the best. A keeper!

FONDUE!  I made this as an oil fondue since I don't have a deep fryer.  It was fun for guests to make, rolling their own shrimp in the coconut (also cuts down on my workload :), and cooking the shrimp as an oil fondue dish.  It was delish although as a standalone meal may be too much on the fried side.

This goes into our recipe box.  We've tried the frozen ones but they never tasted as good as the ones you get at Outbacks.  These are the best.

These shrimp taste just like the ones I've had in restaurants.  They are great!  I didn't have marmalade on hand, so I used duck sauce for dipping. I have made them twice in one week.  My husband loves them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I absolutely love coconut shrimp. The flavors of coconut and shrimp are perfect for each other. I made this last night for a Valentine's day dinner and it came out awesome! I didn't make any sauce to dip them in, but they amazingly were terrific without a sauce! I will definately be keeping this recipe in my online recipe box!

We love these!  Suggestion before battering: split the coconut in two batches reserving half.  After dipping several shrimp in the coconut, it starts to soak up too much of the liquid from the beer and egg mixture and it makes it harder to stick to the shrimp. So about half way through the battering process replenish the coconut with a dry batch reserved. Also recommend splitting the battered shrimp in half so that when frying half can stay cold in the fridge while frying up the first half. Less chance of batter falling off during the frying process. Thanks LindaV10.  This one is a keeper!

My husband and I just made this tonight.  It was very good.  So good that we are entering it into our recipe folder - and that's a big recommendation from us. We have just renovated our kitchen and have a built in fryolator ( my husband's idea).  The recipe is easy and straightforward.  We did only use about half of the batter called for.  We didn't even make a sauce.  The coconut shrimp are so full of flavor and texture, none is required.  Thank you for this recipe!

WE LOVED THIS RECIPE!  Living in the South, we have access to fresh shrimp all the time.  Coconut Shrimp had always been on my list of thing to try at home and I am so glad I did.  I followed recipe to a T and while it was a bit messy and slightly time consuming...it was 110% worth it.  I will be making again very soon!

Sooo good.!  Got some fresh shrimp in Georgetown, SC
and made it immediately when we got back to Myrtle Beach.  I used about a cup of oil and since shrim cooks so fast, just did one side at a time for about 2 min per side.  Easy and Yummy

Very yummy, although the batter seemed a little thick for my liking.  I did use whole wheat flour and dark beer so that could have done it.

Pretty tasty. I used coconut milk instead of beer. I fried in a pot of vegetable oil. The coconut shrimp tasted almost like it was a little stale... I dipped in my jalapeno jelly which was delicious!

Fantastic batter!  Also used it to make some coconut chicken!  If the batter starts to get a little thick as you are working just add a little more beer (since there is still some left in your can/bottle)  Also, place the shrimp on the wax paper in the freezer for about 15 minutes before cooking.  THis way the coconut will not fall off so much when you cook them.

Soooooo good!  I just made these for dinner and they were delish! The only thing I didn't like is that some of the shrimp the coconut didn't stick as well, and I love lots of coconut.  Instead of battering and cooling, I used peeled, frozen shrimp and did all 3 steps for battering.  As I got some battered I added them to a plate in the freezer to help solidify the batter, once they all were done I pulled the plate out and started frying! I made them with whole wheat flour and sweetened coconut

Yum, yum and YUM! I was nervous making this for the first time, not sure if it would turn out the same for me, but wow...SUPER easy and so tasty!! I also served it with the orange marmalade dipping sauce that 1husband_1hound posted and that was really good with the shrimp! The husband isn't a fan of horseradish and thought I should cut that ingredient out or in half but I thought it was perfectly fine:) Note: use cooked shrimp because once you have it in the oil, the coconut browns REALLY quick!

Followed the recipe as written but it was way too thick. I ended up adding more beer to thin it out. Next time I definitely need to add some spices and try using rum. The recipe as written is only ok.

This was really good and very easy. The only change I made to the recipe was the beer.  I didn't have any on hand, so I used chicken broth to make the batter.  My whole family loved this.  I also made it with a mango dipping sauce.  Yum!! This will be requested often.

This was great!  I also made some, omitting the coconut and LOVED the beer batter.  Will try just the batter (no coconut) on fish also.  This is a keeper!!  UPDATE:  Just made this again... omitted the coconut and rolled them in panko ~ YUMMY!!!

Wonderful! I was so excited to try these! Easy to make (freezing/refrigerating  them is essential!) and great to eat! I will definitely be making these again! We used "Malibu Sauce" as a dipping sauce: yellow mustard and mayo mixed together :)

Made these as a "trial run" recipe for my sister's luau themed 50th birthday party in a week.  They were fantastic. My husband loved them. I served a thai sweet chili sauce for dipping and they were sooooo good. I will definitely be serving these at her party!

This is a great recipe.  I agree with the other posts, you can definitely spice this up a bit with some garlic, pepper, onion powder, CURRY!, etc. in the flour.  Another nice tip; for extra crispiness, try chopping equal parts phylo dough and adding it to the shredded coconut. Yum.

I made these shrimp as an appetizer for my parents' 26th Anniversary dinner.  They LOVED it!  Even my 13-year-old sister loved it (she doesn't like seafood normally!)...  I tried to make the sauce but didn't have any marmalade so I used strawberry jelly instead which was FABULOUS.  Thank you, Linda Vergura!!!

This is my go-to recipe for coconut shrimp. It is delicious! Every time I make it I have people asking for the recipe. I make a sweet and spicy honey butter sauce to go along with it. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

this is very time-consuming. my only complaint. i used almost everyone's comments when i made these. i did chill the batter @ 2hours. i then chilled the battered shrimp @ about 30 minutes. i used a cast iron pan and fried at medium heat. i did double dip the coated shrimp in coconut to make sure i wouldn't lose to much. i also added coconut to the batter. i did use the half cup of orange marm. and then 2 tablespoons of horse radish and 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard. we like a sweet/tangy taste. my family was certain i had went to outbacks. this was served with baked taters and coleslaw. and nope, i hardly lost any cocounut. mucho time, effort  and planning...but yep, this is 5 star worthy!

UPDATE: MY MOM REQUESTED TO GO TO OUTBACK FOR HER BDAY DINNER. OF COURSE, I HAD TO TRY THE COCONUT SHRIMP AGAIN.... :) OUTBACK DEFINITELY SEASONS THEIR SHRIMP (ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WITH WHAT). THEIR CREOLE MARMALADE DIPPING SAUCE IS ALSO MUCH BETTER AND IS MADE WITH STONE GROUND DIJON MUSTARD (WHICH MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE, IMHO). Not bad! Although not the best I've had, these were good nonetheless. With a little tweaking, I might never go back to the chain again (well, at least for coconut shrimp...). :) This recipe could definitely be improved if jazzed up a bit. The batter itself was good (FYI, Land Shark lager was my beer of choice), but the shrimp themselves were too bland for my liking. Seasoning with s&p or your favorite spice blend would make all the difference, IMHO. As top reviewer 1Husband_1Hound did, I too made a dipping sauce out of (sugar-free) orange marmalade, mustard, horseradish, salt & honey. Without the sauce, I doubt I would have enjoyed this as much as I did. NOTE: I used my handy dandy fry daddy to make these (2 batches total). If you carefully place all of your shrimp into your fry basket (opposite ends to maximize fit - i.e. tails facing in opposing directions), you'll end up with perfectly fried shrimp in no time flat. I didn't even lose much coconut this way! Pina colada salad (picked up at my grocer's deli), french fries and Hawaiian rolls completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, Linda! :-)

This worked out well as described. I had to search a little elsewhere to get the dipping sauce proportions (1 Cup marmalade, 3TBS horseradish, 1TBS Dijon Mustard). I do prefer a slightly lighter and fluffier batter to this suggestion so the second time I made it I separated the egg, mixed only the egg yolk in to start with, beat the egg white until peaks formed and folded it in last. And for some zing I added about 1TBS of Zatarain's Crab Boil to the batter (I like my food on the spicier side).

Tastes better than most restaurant coconut shrimp.  Much fresher and lighter tasting.  Very easy to cook too!  I hate coconut and I even loved them.

Shrimp came out really good. I made it with pre cooked medium shrimp. I did quick freeze for 15mins.  Made sure oil was really hot so I wouldn't have to leave in for more than a minute.  Shrimp cooked really quick and to keep a good work flow I cut out the middle step of freezing and drop them right into the oil--they turned out really good without freezing!! After the first batch was made I realized they definitely needed seasoning--used season salt--really good! I also recommend to chop up coconut shreds smaller, too big for the size of the shrimp! I tried the dip, flavors were a bit too powerful for my family. I will make again. Thx

This turned out great. It's a bit putzy but easy. Definitely freeze for 15-20 minutes before frying. The batter sticks better to the shrimp. I prefer to eat as soon as possible without warming in the oven. The orange marmalade dipping sauce was good, too.

Made this several times & finally got to make it with a deep fryer. Using a deep fryer is much better than baking or frying in a pan.

Very yummy! i have made these for a few occassion, and it has been a hit each time. I followed the recommendation of adding the sugar to the batter. I prepared overnight and placed in refrigerator (preparation is long) and fried the next day, it was absolutely delicious!

Very nice recipe! I will definitely be making this again. I only made a few changes. I used large cooked shrimp, I omitted the beer and used rum instead (since I was only making a small batch for myself to test the recipe I only used about 2 tbsp of rum) and I also seasoned my shrimp prior to dipping in batter. I was too lazy to pull out the deep fryer for only 8 shrimp so I fried it on the stove top instead on low to medium heat, keeping eye for a light golden color as coconut burns quite easily and has a bitter taste after its burnt. I ate this with homemade chipotle sauce...VERY yummy! thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! So easy. The 30 minute refrigeration period is not necessary when the shrimp are already cold.  I used a thermometer and monitored my oil temperature throughout the frying process. I found that the oil temperature didn't matter that much. I cooked one batch too hotly for less time and another too coolly for more time, and both batches turned out equally delicious. I'm adding this to my permanent collection!

Great recipe.  Followed it exactly as it is listed with the only change being that I seasoned the 1/4 of flour used to coat the shrimp before dipping into the batter.  I added garlic salt, a pinch of curry powder and a pinch of chilli powder to the flour.  Just wanted a little spice to balance out the sugar of the coconut (tasted great).  I used a hoppy pale ale as the beer and it made a very tasty batter.  Will definitely keep this recipe for future use.

Very good recipe! This was even better than the recipe I already had. Since my kids don't care for shrimp, I followed the same procedures using chicken tenders for them. They turned out great as well, but I would recommend seasoning the chicken first. My whole family loved the dinner and I will definately be using this recipe again!

This was fantastic!  I made this as directed other than chopping the coconut a little finer.  The coating was nice and light and the coconut adhered well to the batter.  I put in freezer on parchment paper for about 30 minutes.   I will definitely make this again.

OK. I give this my best rating with no complaints. I used Steele Reserve Beer. The only thing I did that may be different was to butterfly the shrimp like the ones in restaurants.

WONDERFUL.  I'd put any restaurant made coconut shrimp up against this one!  Came out nicely browned and the coconut crispy.  It was delicioius!  Made a sauce out of apricot preserves, horseradish and dijon mustard.  This is definitely a keeper!

This has become a staple for me! So easy and delicious. Plus, I'm single so I can scale it to serve just me easily. However, I usually find that there's more than enough batter, so I've started reducing the amount that it calls for slightly (and saving the extra beer for me to drink! :P)

Amazing! Taste just like the coconut shrimp at major chains. I make them for almost every outdoor summer type party. Last night, I had a friend over who is allergic to coconut, so I used the beer batter recipe only and did a final dredge in flour instead of the coconut and then tossed them in buffalo sauce (these were also very good).

This was great!  I used chicken, cubed fairly thin.  Used 2/3 cup white wine.  Made a dipping sauce of 1/4 cup apricot jam, 1 tbs yellow mustard + sriracha to taste

I needed it to be gluten free.  Substituted white rice flour for wheat flour and milk for beer.  Excellent.  Finally got to eat good shrimp again

These shrimps are just fantastic!! One of my favorite things to order out, but I have to say, these were the best I've ever had!  I made them for my family and they were very impressed.  Great balance of all the ingredients.  I used jumbo shrimp, worth the extra money.  I think if you used small shrimp you may get too much of the fried batter taste and not enough shrimp.  Also made the dipping sauce with horseradish, marmalade and dijon mustard, very tasty!

Wow!  It is as good as the reviews state.  I also made the orange marmalade dipping saw with horseradish, grey poupon and honey.  It was just like the famous restaurant sauce and appetizer.

I loved this recipe.  I live on the MS gulf coast so finding big cheap shrimp wasn't a problem.  I seasoned the shrimp with five-spice powder and I seasoned the flour with cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and paprika.  I refrigerated the batter for a few hours and I also let the shrimp sit in fridge for a few hours after dredging and forming.  I also made sure to press the coconut firmly into the shrimp.  I butterflied my shrimp because I pan friend them and I thought butterflying them would make it an easier process.  If you do this, make sure you put them in the pan upside down first so that when you flip it and the tail begins to curve it will go straight up into the air.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!! I used Killians Irish Red beer, mmm mmm. Was very easy to mix the batter and fry on the stove top. I served it with a red lobster type pina colada sauce: 1/2 c sour cream,  1/4 pina colada cocktail mix, 1/4 crush pinapple, drained, and 2 TB sugar, mixed all together and chilled the night before. All I can say it this was AMAZING and I can't wait to fry 'em up again.

This recipe is great I had to make a few adjustments because I am allergic to wheat so in place of beer I used coconut milk and used a featherlight GF flour mix
made a pinacolada dipping sauce and it was AWSOME! also I did add 2 tablespoons sugar to the batter mix.

My girlfriend and I LOVED this recipe. I am not even a huge fan of coconut shrimp, but this recipe is just fantastic. It is just as good, and I think better, than any restaurant. You must make this recipe. It is marvelous!!

This was a good recipe, although I personally felt the sweetness took away from the taste of the seafood. It was still good, though! The refrigeration process definetly helps the batter stick to the shrimp. Next time I'll just use less coconut.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I took the suggestions of others, used Mounds brand coconut & prepared ahead leaving the battered shrimp in the fridge overnight.  Fried at med heat in Crisco Light for 1 1/2 minutes each side and they came out perfect!  Huge Success at the party!! Many requests for the recipe!!  Definately suggest the orange marmelade, mustard & horseradish dipping sauce!!

I thought this was horrible.  It was a huge mess and the batter wouldn't stay on the shrimp.  It didn't taste that great either.

I made this recipe as my second course using jumbo shrimp and put three on a plate for each of my six dinner guests.  I chilled the marmalade, mustard, horsereadish dip in the fridge for 2 hours and it thickened up nicely. I placed a dollop of the sauce on each plate and arranged the shrimp on top.  I also prepared and fried the shrimp earlier in the day and popped them in the oven at 400degrees for 5 minutes before i served them.  Fabulous

Love this stuff. About the 10th time I made it the store was out of orange marmalade, so I used Pineapple Preserves, it was even better.  I now always use Pineapple.  Also if I have it I use Stone Ground Mustard instead of regular.  This is my family & friends favorite dish!!!!

I used this recipe with Chicken, since I'm not a fan of shrimp and it was FABULOUS...The best Coconut Chicken I have ever tasted!  I didn't have beer in the house, so I used gingerale and it came out great!  I did end up using more of the beer batter and flour mix than the recipe called for...just about double.  But the good news is we had leftovers (unbelievably!)and I tried freezing them based on a previous review.  I took them out last night (still frozen) and baked them for about 20 minutes at 350.  They crisped right up and tasted as great as the first night!  In fact, I think they tasted better, since there was no prep!  They do take some work to make, so I've decided that the next time I make them (and there will definately be a next time), I'm going to make a huge batch and freeze the extras!

Fantastic!  My husband, who doesn't even like coconut could not stop eating them.  I also made the orange marmalade dipping sauce and everyone loved it too.  My suggestions:  use larger shrimp (I used medium and it was way too labor intensive), add a little salt, and add a little sugar if your coconut is not presweetened.

My mouth is watering just thinking back to when I made this recipe last week.   In a word:  phenomenal!  Definitely worthy of impressing your best company. One major tip:  save yourself LOADS of time and either buy peeled & deveined shrimp or do this work ahead of time.  I expected this recipe to be good, so I bought almost 2 pounds of XL shrimp and pretty much doubled up on everything else.  Had to laugh when I re-read the prep time to be 10 minutes, not the hour it took me before I got down to business.  Next time I will let it marinate in the fridge a bit longer than 30 minutes, but this recipe was still outstanding ... my husband said it "blew away" the coconut shrimp at our favorite restaurant!  And if at all possible, for the ultimate tropical kick, PLEASE do yourself the favor and serve it with fresh (in the refrigerated section) pineapple mango salsa -- HELLO!  Garnish w/cilantro for company ;)
Even with the extra hour's work, I just cannot wait to make it again!  Another tip:  if you're making a large quantity, be careful not to let the oil burn as you get towards frying the later batches or you'll get that black "nasty oil" flavor & crunch.  If you can manage to make any last long enough to a second day, the flavor intensifies and it's superb served cold on a Spinach salad!!  Bon Appetit!

By the way you forgot to say, for the novices, that these shrimp must be peeled and deveined and the tails left on. I knew to do this but it might be worth mentioning. Other than that these were great. I used colossal shrimp and heavy cream instead of the beer because I’d rather drink the beer and I had some cream I needed to use. For dipping sauce I used apricot-pineapple preserves ‘cause hubby isn’t fond of orange flavored stuff. I pre-battered, (plan ahead, it takes some time) and chilled a couple of hours. I never dared order coconut shrimp in a restaurant since there were always so many other things that I was sure I would like. Glad to be able to try a highly rated recipe at home. I made this for company and it got raves. I liked these but I personally think I prefer other ways of preparing shrimp better. Just my taste, not the recipe. Comes out looking pretty. I didn’t think it was too sweet as other reviewers said. Maybe the sauce makes a difference.

I made this recipe for my office holiday party and they turned out great! I had some people that didn't eat seafood so I made it with chicken as well and they also turned out perfect. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was fantastic! Definitely a keeper!!

Does anybody know...is it possible to BAKE the shrimp instead of frying them? Has anyone tried? Any suggestions for this? Input concerning baking would be greatly appreciated!! :)

The closest place to get Coconut Shrimp is at The Outback 45 miles away. Since I have been making this recipe we have not had to leave home, they are that good!! I have not changed a thing in this recipe because "if it ain't broke why try to fix it. Thanks Sandy

When we go out, I always order Coconut Shrimp.  I read the reviews and decided to try it.  My husband didn't say a word through dinner, he just kept moaning!
After the meal he told me he felt like he had just eaten at the Ritz!  What an amazing meal!
I had some of the batter left over and added Lawry's season salt and made onion rings, which were also amazing.

I'd ordered coconut shrimp at a restaurant and was excited when I found the recipe here. I didn't use beer, I substituted club soda. I found them to be every bit as good as the shrimp at the restaurant. Delicious!!! Thank you for posting the recipe.

First time making coconut shrimp at home... Normally just go to Red Lobster. Loved the recipe and was very easy. Went ahead and took the tails off so we could pop them in our mouth. Instead of regular beer, I used Red's Apple Ale to give it a little more "island flavor" which worked wel

Can these (Coconut Shrimp I) be prepared and then frozen and then cooked in the oven on parchment and a cookie sheet instead of deep-frying? Has anyone tried this method?

This recipe is truly amazing and the coconut shrimp were the best I've ever tasted! The recipe is simple and the end result spectacular. The only change I made was salting w/sea salt after the shrimp came out of the oil.

This dish is delicious! I made this with 1 lb. jumbo shrimp. It was easier with larger shrimp. My husband doesn't always want coconut so I used Panko bread crumbs for his portion and it makes a beautiful golden coat. There is never any food leftover. Our guests loved it made with coconut and with substitution of bread crumbs. I use a mini deep fryer with canola oil and drop them for 2-2:15 minutes at a time or coconut starts to over cook. So good I don't need another fried shrimp recipe ever again!!!

The quality of the shrimp will really effect the outcome but this recipe is dead simple and fantastic. The recipe doesn't specify whether the coconut should e sweetened or not. We went with unsweetened and it was a big hit but next time we'll try sweetened.

Awesome! Excellent! Outstanding!  10 stars!
I followed the recipe to a 'T' and served these coconut shrimp as an appetizer for a Graduation Dinner that we hosted last night.  They were DELISH!  MUCH better than any of us had had before.  I also did the marmalade/horseradish/Dijon mustard dip in addition to another dip = 1/2 cup mayo + 1/4 teaspoon curry powder.  I preferred the marmalade, but there was not a drop of the mayo dip left.  Serve dips with small spoons (sur la table $2 ea) to avoid double dipping.
I used 21-25 Count Shrimp, and for 6 people, 1lb of shrimp would have been enough (we made 2lbs for 6 people - WAY too much).  I'd say 1lb of 21-25 Count shrimp is the perfect amount of appetizer for 10 people.  The final product = 3 BIG FILLING bites.  Be sure to cool for at LEAST 5 minutes before serving as they may not FEEL hot on the outside, but 5 mins or less they can still be VERY hot on the inside.  I think the time the shrimp had in the fridge after being breaded is what made this recipe an absolute success.  We had very little coconut that fell off into the oil.  Thank you Linda for this incredible recipe!  It's a keeper for SURE!

Super easy, extremely tasty.  Big hit at a dinner party, and again at a large Bday celebration.  Personally I found it better to cook without refrigerating prior to.  This has become a staple now for this non-cook!

Great recipe! I didn't refrigerate them before frying (never had time) and they still turned out perfect. They are light, fluffy, and golden with that wonderful coconut flavour. I also used the angleflake coconut insted of the drier grated kind.

I have been looking for a good coconut shrimp recipe and this is the one.  The batter and coconut stays on the shrimp without any problem.  Nest time I will use some tweezers to hold the shrimp while they drain because it is hard to hold the tales by hand unless you actually leave the tails when you clean them.  Too much trouble for me.  This is definitely a keeper and I will look no farther for a coconut shrimp recipe.

OMG this was my first recipe I made... this is my favorite appetizer whenever I go to Outback, I wanted so badly to know how to make it myself, so searched the web and I was lead to this website and I guess you can say that it open up the flood gates to the other recipes. Instead of using beer since I dont drink, I used gingerale or another fizzy drink, my friends go crazy over them

OMG this is absolutely fabulous! We had this recipe on New Year's Day and everyone, from the nine-year-old on up, absolutely loved it. We made a marmalade and honey mustard-based sauce and it was hard not to lick the plate. We did follow the suggestion about pulsing the coconut in the food processor and it worked very well. I would give this 10 stars if I could!

Great, made this 2 or 3 times, but never with the beer. Before I bought tongs and a wok ($5 at Ikea) I used a deep frying pan to do the deep frying- but thats rather dangerous and messy but also works. After dipping in egg I dipped mine into bread crumbs and then into the coconut flakes. To make sure the oil temperature was correct, I added a tiny piece of bread to the oil, if it didn't burn into 20 secs the temp was correct (I still don't have a cooking thermometer) If temp is not right, the coconut will fall off the shrimp when placed in the oil. My sauce was a mix of apricot preserves/jam and a bit of mustard. I love these and my boyfriend gobbles them down in minutes!

missing something that ties together the flavor of the shrimp and the breading. i felt like when you bite into it you tasted a thick layer of sweet breading then a separate taste of the shimp on its own.

Awesome coconut shrimp, I made this for a small party and everyone loved it.  Be careful that your oil is not too hot when you are ready to fry or the coconut will burn before the shrimp is cooked through.  Served with pina colada dipping sauce.  I used 2/3 cup coconut milk instead of beer.   Yum!

This recipe is AWESOME!!  everytime i make it my guest always ask for the recipe.  tips- its very important to let the shrimp refrigerate for atleast 1/2 an hour.  Also i never have beer so I always substitute it for coconut milk which makes it extra sweet :-)

This is a great recipe. I use the batter on strips of chicken breast since husband doesn't like shrimp. Some sweet chili dipping sauce, and this is a slam dunk.

I think it came out pretty good. I think next time I let the shrimp sit over night in the refrigerator, instead of for 30 mins.

This was by far the best coconut shrimp I've ever had. It even beats out any dish I've had at a restaurant. Made it today for lunch at my in-laws and they loved it! Even my 5 year old ate it, which is saying a lot since she's Ms. Picky Eater. Will definitely make again! I followed recipe accordingly and it came out wonderful! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Very good!!!! Husband only likes shrimp cocktail, but he really liked these!! Placed the coated shrimp in the freezer for 15 minutes while I made some veggies, then fried the shrimp in a pan..lots of leftover batter, so I coated another dozen shrimp with just that, in case the husband refused to eat the coconut ones......made over 3 dozen shrimp.....none left between the 2 of us! I'll certainly make this again!!  5 stars!

This just may be better than Red Lobster or any other sea food place who serves Coconut Shrimp.  It is even better with honey mustard dressing.  My daughter didn't think she would like it because she does not like coconut, but she ate more than anyone else.

This is not so much a rating as an open question (it begs to be answered): does the recipe refer to cooked or UNcooked shrimp? I think some users (such as I) unfamiliar with handling shrimp would benefit from having that point cleared up. 

Thank you (and btw, sounds delicious, so I will rate based on my over-active, eternally-hungry imagination)

Just delicious. The quality of the prawns is KEY here. I called a favorite restaurant and asked them what was in their coconut prawn dip- HONEY and MAE PLOY brand sweet chili sauce-I Microwaved for 10 seconds while coconut prawns were being dished up (1/4 c of each if you want it medium hot, just add more or less honey to taste)

These are the BEST!  Far better than anything you would get at a restaurant.  I used coconut milk instead of the beer and the shrimp turned out perfect!  The marmalade-mustard sauce is great too.  You must try this recipe!

I used this recipe for a catering job,  OH BOY!!  Did they love this recipe, there was not one shrimp left over!!!! 12 lbs. of coconut shrimp--GONE!  It was the hit of the party! The key is definatley chilling the shrimp down before frying them!!  The sauce is delicious, perfect companion.

Excellent.  Didn't change anything, but am interested in trying it next time with coconut milk.  Will make again for SURE.

I made these for Christmas dinner.  They were pretty good; not wonderful, but good.  Prep was pretty easy.  I wish they had a little more flavor.

This was AMAZING! An automatic save.  I added 1 Tsp and a 1/2 or sugar as another user suggested and also added 1/2 cup of coconut to the batter itself because as others users commented, I thought the coconut would fall off. It definitely didn't; They were perfect. Definitely chill the shrimp with the batter before frying.   YUMMM! I want more.  Oh, and next time I'll make the orange marmalade (etc) dipping sauce, I'm sure that would have made it even better!!

I added a little lemon pepper, pepper, and paprika to the flour to spice it up a bit, but other than that it was awesome. I also made a dipping sauce out of apricot jam, horseradish, and dijon.

These shrimp turned out wonderful. I actually coated them and put them on a cookie sheet in the freezer, then put them in zip lock bag. Fried them up 2 days later for a party and everyone loved them. By themselves i would maybe add a little bit of sugar to the flour because i like them to be a little sweeter (even though i used sweetened coconut), However when served with the orange marmalade/horseradish/mustard mixture they were EXCELLENT!

Great recipe, for the most part. I had large shrimp, and they were still raw after cooking them to the instruction in this recipe, so I reduced the temp by 50 degrees and this worked perfectly. Or you should butterffly them... she didn't mention this in the recipe the size of the shrimp she used.  I made a couple of changes, after testing a shimp each time -- one was the temp change. Another, I used sweetened cocnut, to me it was much better, deeper flavour. To me coconut shrimp should be sweet. As well, I sprinkled the battered shimp with Cayenne Pepper which made a huge difference in bringing out the sweetness of the coconut and adding a little heat before dipping. The dip she suggests was my guests' least favorite.. I made two others, one with katchup, horse raddish, and hot sauce, and another with marmalade, honey and hot sauce, both of those bowls were scraped to the bottom...

Yummy!  I paired it with a sauce much like Red Lobster's.  Pina Colada mix, sour cream and crushed pineapple.

so simple! so delicious.  Chilling the shrimp after adding the coating really helps it stick when frying.  Don't skip this part!  Well worth the wait!

Yumm.  The only change I would make next time is to make sure and get more of the batter off before dipping the shrimp in the coconut.  The batter is thick and if you don't shake the excess off you get a shrimp that is mostly batter and coconut.  I would also add a touch of salt to the batter.

Awesome recipe.  I followed many of the modifications and made sure to chill the battered shrimp prior to frying.  MY modification was to add PANKO bread crumbs (check your ethnic food aisle) after the beer/flour mix THEN rolled the shrimp in the coconut.  It came out PERFECTLY!

I thought these were great! Instead of beer, I substituted beef broth, and I also fully peeled the shrimp to make them more like shrimp poppers.  It made it easy to batter the shrimp by using one of those fondue skewers after you roll it in flour.  I made some shrimp with the batter without rolling in the coconut because my husband isn't a huge fan, and he thought that those were really awesome.  Finally, for dipping sauces I used djion mustard (great!) and cocktail sauce. Very wonderful recipie.

After 1 1/2 hours of reading reviews, I decided to make it! It was absolutely awesome. I did add some granulated garlic and Black pepper to my beer batter. Delish! A little time consuming to prepare them correctly, but SO worth it. I will definitely be making these again. Served with a cold dip made of raspberry preserves, cranberry sauce, apple jelly,  dry mustard, ground mustard and horseradish. Absolutely the best shrimp recipe I have ever tried!

I made this twice. The first time it was gone, my guest loved it. Second time I used King Shrimp, not as nice. Next time I won't use king shrimp it takes away from the flavour.

These were gone almost as soon as I put them out and the consensus was  "DELICIOUS!"  I followed others' advice and ran the coconut through the food processor and allowed the battered shrimp to refrigerate for three hours before cooking.  As well, I allowed the beer to go flat before mixing the batter.  As a result of all the above steps, very little of the coconut was lost during the cooking process.  As for sauce, I used orange marmalade, dijon mustard, and Vietnamese garlic chili sauce, all to taste.  Peach or apricot preserves mixed with mustard and garlic chili sauce work great too.

I have never made coconut shrimp so I was a little nervous.  I have a good deep fryer so that helped me out a lot.  The shrimp turned out perfect and I didn't change a thing.  I made a dipping sauce out of pineapple-apricot preserves, thai chili sauce, and honey mustard.  I won't be afraid to make them again.

I made this as part of my Christmas Eve dinner and they were awesome and easy to make.  After putting them in the fridge to chill, they were so easy to handle and I did not have an issue with my coconut batter falling off while frying.  They came out crsispy and delicious!  I made a dipping sauce to go with them: 1 Cup Orange Marmalade, 3 T prepared horseradish, and 2 T dijon mustard.  Also, I didnt have wax paper so I just sprayed a little Pam on a cookie sheet to chill them in the fridge and that worked perfectly.

The shrimp didn't have flavor at all. It tasted weird, not like any restaurant I've had it at and I tasted more beer than anything and I don't care for the taste of beer..blah Some people suggested adding all these spices and flavors, etc, but that defeats the purpose of rating the recipe as it is..  So as it is, I don't like it.Sorry to all the people that liked it after changing/modifying/and adding spices and flavor :(

Delicious! I fried these in a skillet instead of a deep frier, and it turned out just as good. The only alteration I made was to add a little garlic salt into the batter. The contrast with the sweet coconut was a real knockout!

My coconut shrimp turned out better than any restaurant Ive ever had them in. I did add some other spices: 2 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. onion powder, and ground fresh pepper into the beer/coconut batter. I also found that I needed more flour and coconut than the recipe calls for for the dry coat, but that may have been due to the fact that I had about 30 jumbo size shrimp to coat. I fried the coconut shrimp in a deep fryer. For the dip I made a dip using sour cream, honey mustard, dijon mustard, & horseradish sauce. Also, I think a  sweet & tangy bbq sauce would go great with the coconut shrimp if you arent into the mustard thing. Its a very messy dish to make, but who cares, because they turned out super yummy-riffic!

OK don't laugh but...I forgot the egg!!  Yup I did...Did it make a difference?  Well I don't know how good these are supposed to taste with it..but without, they are awesome!  Next time I will try with the egg!!  lol Don't forget a little sprinkling of salt! and I fried in my wok which worked awesome.  I added a bit of peanut oil to bring up the burn temp on the oil.

This is a great recipe...Everyone loves it..Only change I made was I didn't have beer so I used a can of coconut milk I had on hand and I did throw some coconut in the processor/blender and added that to the batter as well...Otherwise made it the same...Thank you so much it is a wonderful and really not that time consuming really as I am always doing 15 things at once and it gives a chance to do the dishes as you go...I have frozen some for later and they have only lasted a day lol But a few minutes in toaster oven or on a cookie sheet and they are crispy right up again, not soggy as in microwave as someone said they did...
Again Thank You, Thank You I am a big hit at parties and always get requsted to do these...

VERY tasty!!  And didn't take very long to make. Just time to "set" the coconut mixture onto the shrimp.  I followed someones suggestion to put them in the freezer for 15 minutes and the coconut stayed on very well.  I also pan fried them in olive oil.  Will definately make again.  Thanks.

Absolutely the best I have had...tried several recipes trying to copy that restaurant's shrimp...followed the recipe exactly, batter looks runny but works perfectly..no need to add more four...used a Bud beer...Outback's would be a let down..These are perfect....1/2 cup marmelade, 2 t's mustard, 1 t horseradish...fridged 6 hours...a key to keeping coconut on....lovely

Terrific!  I was amazed how plump with coconut these shrimp became.  Having read the importance of chilling for 30 minutes, I took the advice of CurtisLee and put them in the freezer for 15 minutes.  It sped the process up and they turned out wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!  I served with "slam dunk coconut shrimp dipping sauce".

These turned out perfect! EVERYONE loved them! But what I did differently was:i seasoned and marinated the shrimp in pine apple juice to give it a little more something. Didn't ude the beer and i used a little more then 1 egg (LOL). But these were a hit!

FANTASTIC!  This is just the right amount of cocnut flavor.  The batter was perfect.  Chilling it before frying made a big difference.  Comes out a beautiful golden brown.  Very impressive for guests or just yummy for the family.   The suggested dipping sauce was also 5 stars!  This one will stay in my recipe book!

I love this recipe so much that I never order it at restaurants anymore.  I've made it several times and each time it gets rave reviews from guests.  Someone mentioned the lack of a dipping sauce recipe.  Here's one I adapted from the "Twice Cooked Coconut Shrimp" recipe:  1/2 cup orange marmalade, 
1/4 cup Dijon-style prepared mustard &
1/4 cup honey.  (I leave out the hot sauce)  This dipping sauce with the shrimp is amazing!

AWESOME!  These came out so crispy, and tasted just like the ones from the big "lobster" restaurant chain!  I refrigerated them, as suggested by other reviews and they held together great.  
I used pineapple juice instead of beer and added a dash of cayenne, which added a good contrast of sweetness and spice to the batter.  For a sauce, I mixed the marmalade with plum sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes.  Got great compliments from my family tonight and requests to make this again!

I made this for my family and it was a huge hit!  I did change the batter up slightly.  Rather than use beer, which I didn't have on hand, I used coconut rum.  This was really good.  I also made a pina colada sauce which everyone loved.  We'll definately make this again!

My family really enjoyed this one... I thought it was pretty good, but not earth shattering.  My family disagreed.  They were raving! Maybe it's because they didn't have to clean up the deep fryer after :). I used large shrimp (not jumbo) and had A LOT of batter and coconut left over, so I ended up using a couple of chicken breasts cut into strips to make some chicken fingers.  That was a hit too!! Other than that, fairly tasty.  I'd make it again!

Wow!  These were awesome!  Definitely use the largest shrimp you can comfortably afford.  The prep is easy and convenient...all ingredients that I have on hand most of the time.  Yes, the double dredging is a little messy, but well worth it.  I was a little rushed, so I skipped the chilling in the fridge, and instead I placed them on wax paper on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.  It seemed to work perfectly.  I used a Fry Daddy to cook them in.  Very little mess.  For dipping, I used pineapple preserves, a little honey, a little Frank's hot sauce, and a little mustard. Excellent! Everyone raved!  As good, or better than restaurants.  Very impressive all the way around!

Divine. So good. I used heavy cream in place of beer and the batter stuck to the shrimp very well. I also chilled the shrimp (dipped in batter) in the refrig. about an hour. The dipping sauce is perfect. I am making this again today. Thanks!

My husband and I think this shrimp is heavenly. I buy the shrimp on sale and have the grocery store separate them into 12 shrimp each to seal in freezer bags. I pull them out and make them as simple appetizers quite often. They are delicious!

The Best!Whenever I go out to eat I always order coconut shrimp if its on the menu. I like the ones I've had at Rainforest cafe and outback. But you only get a few shrimp for $15 to $20. Then my husband and I went to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl two weeks ago, and while we were driving around the North Shore my husband and I stop at this little roadside shack we weren't expecting much but it had coconut shrimp for only $8 so I ordered it. I got 10 jumbo shrimp that was the best coconut shrimp I ever had. My husband and I have talked about that place every day since getting back. So I had to find a recipe to make it myself. All the reviews were right, The coconut really sticks to the shrimp. Just use the largest shrimp you can afford for a great dish. I even made the sauce but it doesn't need any. Thanks for the perfect Coconut Shrimp recipe.

This may be more about my taste than the recipe, but I could not even taste the shrimp for the batter and coconut. I discovered that I (and my husband and kids) prefer simpler recipes for shrimp--herbs, lemon etc. My recommendation would be to try a different recipe if you love the taste of shrimp.

These turned out great.  I did not use large shrimp and had no problem battering them.  To help keep the coconut on the shrimp while frying, I gently pressed the coconut into the batter and I let the shrimp chill for about an hour before I actually started frying them.  I had very little coconut come off during frying doing it that way.  Next time I make these I will definately try that sauce some have mentioned.

I made these for my brother's Hawaiian birthday party and they were a total hit. We used bigger shrimp, and based on previous reviews made the batter a tad thicker (maybe a little too thick, but the original recipe's batter is too thin). I should have chopped up the coconut in a food processor as someone else mentioned, it would have made it easier to assemble. All in all, they are a pain to make but as you see them fly off the plate and people raving about them, the work is all worthwhile. Just make sure that everything else you are making is easy to prepare so you have time to do these.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at my Italian Christmas Eve Fish Dinner.  The recipe was perfect and they were absolutely delicious!  the only thing is I didn't have a dipping sauce and I should have, but they were awesome anyway.

This recipe is awesome. My daughter makes it for special occasions, we hate cleaning shrimp but this is worth it. We could not find any unsweetened coconut, so I just made the dipping sauce a bit more spicy by adding more horseradish. It was terrific. I concur with everyone elso, RESTAURANT QUALITY !!!

Our family loved it, and are always asking for more.  I dont generally like coconut, but this has just a very small hint of sweet.  Very tasty! A little on the messy side while preparing but well worth it.

Since eating coconut shrimp in the restaurant, I was pleased to see this recipe. I tried it and my boys loved it. I made 3 dozen shrimp (although time consuming to make) it disappeared in minutes. Definitely will do this recipe again and again. They even liked the marmalade; it gave it a nice zing.

Roughly followed the recipe- so delicious.  Do NOT need to deep fry- I shallow fried the shrimp in a little coconut oil in a cast iron skillet.  YUM.  Could also use a little seasoning- every step you dip the shrimp should have a dash of salt in it.  Season every layer!
Used the shrimp in Banh-Mi- french bread, fresh cilantro, scallions, carrots, apricot sauce, mayo, sriracha

Omg! This was soooo delicious I thought it came from a restaurant! Only thing I did was season the shrimp with garlic powder, pepper, cayenne pepper creole seasoning! Everything else I followed exactly! I also used spicy orange sauce because I could not find orange marinade! Excellent! Will most definitely make again! Thanks for this great recipe.

This was incredibly easy to make and quick. It tasted better than ANY coconut shrimp I've had in restaurants. I added a little old bay, paprika, and coriander to the coconut flakes to give it a bit more flavor.

Made for our neighborhood block party and it was eaten up! I used Costco large tail-on pre-cooked shrimp. I specifically bought the cooked shrimp because I know coconut can burn - this way, I didn't have to worry about the shrimp not being cooked through. Pan-fried in canola oil instead of deep-frying. The only challenge was the coconut would sometimes burn if I didn't time it perfectly, but because I'd packed it so full of coconut, some of the coconut/batter wasn't quite cooked at the same time. It's an art, for sure!! My dipping sauce was apricot jam with horseradish to taste (not a fan of marmalade). I'm sure I'll make this again.

This was very good!!! I used chicken instead of shrimp, and it was delicious, my kids devoured it. I also added some cayenne pepper to the flour, and used a sweet chile sauce for dipping. Will definately make again.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it never fails.  The second time, I actually doubled the recipe and froze them individually before putting them in bags.  Now I just pop them out of the freezer, into the oil and done!  No prep and an easy appetizer for surprise guests!

This recipe was a hit. I made the dip as a previous reviewer has suggested with: 1/2 c orange marmalade, 2 t mustard, 1 t prepared horseradish, dash salt, and honey to taste. TO DIE FOR.

This recipe produced a beautiful product, but I was left wanting more in the flavor and texture. To be more specific; A longer shredded coconut approx. 1 1/2 cm makes a big difference. I initially tried this recipe using an organic short shredded unsweetened coconut. The longer shredded pieces crisp much more effectively and take on more golden tones. In addition to this I also recommend seasoning the coconut mixture. Cayenne, white and black pepper, and garlic powder elevate the flavor of the shrimp to an enjoyable level. Lastly, I am never a fan of anything that says use "beer." There are hundreds of types of beer with ranging flavors and depths. NEVER use a beer that you wouldn't drink. I used blue moon in the mixture and it was perfect. Many sites will tell you to use pabst or some other cheap junk. There are plenty of light beers that will add the perfect aroma and kick to your dish, and being specific in this area is important.

Turned out GREAT!!  I used coconut milk instead of beer which made them extra coco-nutty and I put them in the freezer for 30 minutes instead of the refrigerator.  The recipe was very easy and I can't wait to make them again!

Super delish and this was my first time making any kind of shrimp! i used the sweetened angel flake coconut. Next time i will try to let more batter drain off the shrimp before rolling it in the coconut flakes because some of them were too bready. But overall, pretty crispy and very yummy! I also used frozen large shrimp.

I fixed this recipe last night using jumbo shrimp, it was the best dinner  I fixed in quite awhile.  My husband thought the shrimp were excellent every bit as good as you would get in a restaurant(better in my opinion) I followed some other suggestions, I put the coconut in my magic bullet and chopped a little finer.  I  added Old Bay Seasoning , a touch of garlic powder and paprika to the dredging flour,  after placing the breaded shrimp in wax paper lined pan, I placed it in the freezer for 30 min.  They came out of the deep fryer brown crisp and wonderful!

This was sooo easy & delicious. I took the advice to pat the coconut onto the shrimp after 15 minutes of refrigeration & put them back into the refrigerator for 15 minutes more. I look forward to wow-ing my family & friends.

So very delicious. Followed recipe exactly and the flavors were wonderful. Not too sweat. I used peach marmalade instead of orange and I highly recommend trying that change. I also used coconut oil to fry it up since I had no other oil. Worked great.

First bite from my husband and he said "definite keeper" this recipe was easy and the shrimp browned beautifully in a pan. I agree that the chilling is a necessity, I did 20 minutes in the freezer. Not a "healthy" recipe but it sure will be repeated in this house!

Wow! This was fantastic. I put the shrimp in the freezer for 15 minutes, and the coating stuck just fine. I forgot to get the ingredients for a dipping sauce, so I wound up mixing 1/3 cup pear jam, 2 Tbs coconut milk, and 2 tsp whole grain mustard - sounds bizarre, but it tasted great!

UPDATE:  Made again with sweetened coconut and I felt it made a HUGE difference.  So much yummier.  Definitely use sweetened coconut if you want to replicate the coconut shrimp served in restaurants.

*****
I made the recipe pretty much as written, and my husband and I were both, just, well, OK with it.  They were good, not great.  I did use unsweetened coconut, I wonder if that is where the difference was (the recipe doesn't specify and I used what was open in my pantry).  I wonder if a little sugar added would have made a difference, to get a bit of carmelization that might have otherwise happened.... 

For dipping sauce, I liked the orange marmalade concoction idea but alas, we don't have any.  So I improvised and used up a ton of leftover Chinese food sauce packets, made a sauce with a ratio of 8 packets duck sauce, 2 packets mustard, and 1 packet soy and it was really really yummy!!

I made this recipe for my husband who loves coconut shrimp. He enjoyed it, but he didn't act like he would want it very often. They were good, but a little time consuming and messy for a weeknight meal. The sauce from a previous reviewer with the horseradish, orange marmalade, and dijon mustard was over the top, however.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Outstanding Coconut Shrimp and so very easy to prepare.  I did use Panko Bread Crumbs and coconut for my final dipping and it was great.  Give this recipe a try and I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as my family did.

I used this as a base recipe for buffalo shrimp. I used half flour and half panko. Added homemade Creole seasoning. The beer I used was Guinness, and the coconut flakes were sweetened. The sauce I made was from the 'Buffalo Shrimp' recipe on AR (a sauce which I wouldn't use again- insanely spicy, even for someone like me that loves heat!). This was tasty.

Disappointed. Needed more coconut flavor on my shrimp. Also, it probably didnt turn out as well because I dont have a deep fryer. Pan fried it, so cooking times became inconsistent, especially with heat temperature hard to maintain. Some batches were burnt. Will think about trying again in future, but not to make for party platters.

These shrimp were wonderful! My family devoured an entire 2 lb package of shrimp.  Very easy to make and clear directions.  I did season the flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and sesame seeds.  I will definately be making this again!  Just the next time, I'll make sure I have marmalade to make a dipping sauce!

I followed the recipe exactly (I like to the first time I make a recipe) and it turned out great! I did make my own sauce using mango marmalade, dijon mustard and jalapenos. My family loved it. They said it was better than our favorite restraunt that serves coconut shrimp! Note: I did need more coconut than what was called for.

Loved, loved, loved! I refridagted the batter for about an hour. I then made sure to shake off excess batter as I dind't do this the first time when I tried this recipe, and the batter was too thick.  I then put the battered shrimps on a large plate, and put in freezer until ready to fry. Used in deep fryer, and came out better than a restaurant! Got HUGE raves from everyone around. Loved the suggested sauce too of orange marmalade, mustard, & horseradish sauce. I will do this again and again! I also used the "tail-on" frozen shrimp from Costco that were already cooked.  Just defrosted bag overnight in refridgator, and it was way less work to do it this way.

These take a bit of time to prepare, but they are very good. I found they had to be served quickly as they cool down fast. I served with President's Choice "Memories of Thailand" dipping sauce.

Excellent and so incredibly easy to make! My family told me to throw out all other shrimp recipes. Watch the temp on the oil so they won't burn. For an easy dipping sauce I mix horseradish with strawberry preserves like a local restaurant does in Florida. At least as good as any restaurant's coconut shrimp. Thanks Linda!!

exellent flavor, I cut the recipie in half, just me and my husband. I did have to keep adding more flour and coconut as I went because it clumped up, but I won't have to buy these in a resturaunt again.

These turned out so good! I fried up 3 pounds of jumbo gulf shrimp with this recipe, and the party snacked all night long. Fantastic flavor and crunch, and they go great with a dark beer.

I had to write a review on this recipe. I can't tell you how many times I come home and whip this up. It doesn't take long for the shrimp to thaw and it only takes 30 min of sit time in the fridge (this is key to the success of deep frying them). I use whatever I have on hand for the dipping sauce. I have even tried mixing orange marmalade, pina colada mix with a touch of horseradish. It makes a perfect meal with a side salad. Yummo!

I upped this recipe for 24 servings for a luau themed party I went to over the weekend.  I needed slightly more coconut flakes than the recipe called for. Otherwise I wouldnt change a thing, they were a hit.

Simple and fail proof. Make ahead, chill for as long as it takes to clean up and when guests arrive start cooking (5 per batch in Presto Grandpappy fryer). Only takes a minute or so per batch. Be sure to take blackened coconut out of the fryer as you go. That is the KEY to every shrimp being golden.  For 1 bag of 24 shrimp I make 1 + 1/2 dipping sauce. Sauce is to die for too!!

I baked these in the oven! They still turned out great. They didn't turn out quite as golden.....but they were still yummy and much less greasy. I used large pre cooked shrimp and baked then for about 12 minutes at 375.  I made a mango/avocado salsa to go with them. Would make them again for sure.

I made these exactly according to the recipe, and they were amazing.  For the beer I used one of my boyfriend's Rogue Dead Guy Ales.  I didn't allow it to go flat, and I had no problem with it getting too frothy like some people mentioned. For the shrimp, I used pre-cooked because I was afraid they would not be sufficiently cooked during frying.  I don't know if this was a legitimate fear, but using pre-cooked shrimp gave me one less thing to worry about, and they weren't overcooked at all.  I will definitely do it that way again. I used a mixture of apricot jelly and horseradish for dipping.  I thought it was very good that way, but my boyfriend felt they didn't even need a sauce and were good enough on their own!  Will definitely make this again!

I tried this recipe this past weekend and it was delicious.  I thought the orange marmalade dip actually took away from the taste.  Me and my family ate the shrimp as an appetizer while my husband was grilling.  It was gone in minutes! Next time I'll make this recipe as a meal

I will never spend $11+ on outback's gold coast coconut shrimp again! This recipe tastes even better! Followed recipe exactly though instead of using 24 shrimps I used 18 of the 21/25 size shrimp & fried 3-4 shrimps at a time.  For the marmalade (sp?) I used smuckers brand sweet orange maramalade, ground mustard, dash of salt/pepper, & prepared horseradish (sp?)

I would call myself a beginner cook and being a lover of coconut shrimp, I decided to give this recipe a try. It was absolutely delicious! Easy to make, although a little time consuming the shrimp turned out wonderfully. I added a teaspoon of sugar to the batter and it gave it a nice hint of sweetness. I also used medium size shrimp and was able to make more than 50 shrimp with the recipe that called for 6 servings. For the dipping sauce, I went with the recipe from one of the previous reviewers, which was excellent. It tasted as if it came from a restaurant. I would definitely recommend to try this recipe at least once, you wont regret it.

OMG!  These coconut shrimp are soooooo good!  My husband loves coconut shrimp & I've never really seen the appeal, but after I made some at his request using this recipe I've beeb converted!  Per some other suggestions I added garlic powder, salt, black pepper, onion powder & a little cayenne pepper (all to taste) to the beer batter.  I also fryed mine in a pan on the stove in batches in just enough veg oil to submerge the shrimp about half way.  Doesn't take long to fry at all so watch carefully.  I used an appricot preserve dipping sauce and it was WONDERFUL: 1/2c apricot preserves, 1/4c dijon style mustard, 1/4c honey & 1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce.  Perfect combination.  Also, be sure to use SWEETENED coconut flakes.  It makes a big difference.

I'm rating this 4, but it may be 5. This is because they tasted great when I fried them but turned cold when I took them to a picnic and the coconut coating had lost its crunch. But when I reheated them at home, they were yummy again.

Really delicious!  I used the big shrimp and my entire family loved it!  Also, I pan fried them and they turned out great.  As others have said, make sure your shrimp is really nice and cold after coating and before frying.  It helps keep the coconut on.  Yum!

Made these for a casual dinner party, where making the shrimp was a big part of the evening.  These shrimp were not only beautiful, but they were delicious as well.  Needless to say, there was not even a shred of coconut left.  Can't wait to make these again.

I don't eat seafood but this was delicious! I'm always asked to make it. I used 9 to 10 ounces of orange marmalade, 3 tablespoons horseradish, and 3 tablespoons dijon mustard, found in another recipe, for the dipping sauce. One of the best things I've ever eaten!

Everyone at our Christmas party absolutely loved these shrimp! They were delicious...simply put! I ran out of coconut halfway through and just ended up using the rest of the beer batter and we dipped these in honey mustard sauce. Those were awesome too! I used a big stockpot to fry these and they turned out beautifully. 

Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making these again.

Ever since I found this recipe I have been making it and loving it.  Anytime we have a neighborhood get-together, everyone always asks for these and they are always gone in no time.  I, too, also freeze the coconut battered shrimp before frying to help the coconut stay on.  Also, I found that Guinness beer works the best for the batter because it is stout and frothy.  After battering I make sure to squeeze the coconut onto the shrimp so that there is lots of it and that it is on securely.  After a few rounds of frying remember to fish out any loose pieces of coconut that have fallen into the oil.  If not, these pieces will burn and make the rest of your frying difficult.

Very very good.  I followed the recipe to a 'T' except for one thing (which I guess makes it not a 'T' so maybe I followed it to the 'S')....the batter made WAY more than 24 shrimp so for almost 2 hours I drudged and coated shrimp after shrimp after shrimp. And then had to drudge and coat chicken cuz I ran outta shrimp. I also pan fried them because I don't have a fryer (long story there) and pan frying worked out well.  Even my picky kids liked it!

The best...I use the freeze method to cut time. Also plan on straing the oil between batches to prevent burnt coconut sticking to them. I made a pina colada dipping sauce.

We have made these twice already and love them.  We halve the recipe and make about 16 large shrimp.  We also bake them at 350 F for 8 minutes on each side.  Yummy!

Just perfect fried coconut shrimp and easy to make! For the dipping sauce I used 10oz of Orange Marmalade, 3 tbl of horseradish and 3 tbls of mustard and it had a nice kick to it! Two of us ate a lb of shrimp!

I have made this so many times. I've even use Coke if I don't have beer. Don't bother measuring the coconut or flour. I've always had leftovers until I only added more if I ran out. Start by using half then add more only when you run out. It is easy because the coconut and flour and in separate bowls and none goes to waste. Anyway, I baked in the oven at 350 and made sure to turn it so both sides are brown. For me it is better to spray the wax paper with Pam so now it is easy to flip them. I no longer make the marmalade sauce because it is more work and isn't necessary for us. Great recipe! (The most work for me is from shelling and deveining the shrimp) - the rest is just lining up the three bowls.

These where incredibly good!  These turned out high-end resturant quality! I will preface by saying that I did use extremely fresh just-caught jumbo shirmp.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe--the batter coated each shrimp perfect, the coconut just sweetened it enough.  Hubby deep fried them out on our grill in a heavy skillet--make sure the oil is hot enough.  I did make the sauce as suggested by the reviewer under the recipe:  1/2c. orange marmalade, 2t. grey poupon mustard, 1 t. horseradish sauce, pinch salt, honey to taste.  Very good sauce.

WOW! I have to say these are better then the shrimp I get at a very well known restaurant. I didn't change anything, maybe added a little less beer just because the batter looked to be a good consistancy. I made the batter ahead of time and put it in the fridge for about two hours, then put the batter covered shrimp in the freezer for about 1/2 hour.  I did loose a little coconut when I deep fried them in the fryer but not enough to change the taste. DH said he didn't like coconut shrimp until he tasted these, I was kinda sad when he said he liked them because I wanted them all to myself :)  Definately worth trying!

I hate to say this but i really did not like this recipe. I have tried different coconut shrimp but nothing tasted like this. Maybe it was the beer? Or maybe i did it wrong? I definitely wont try it again. Sorry for the bad review but i just cant get over the specific flavour these had!

Very good recipe!  I took someone's advice and prepared them the night before and kept in the fridge to prevent coconut loss.  We even liked the dipping sauce.  Very filling, so beware if you're preparing as an appetizer...your guests may not eat your main course.

I don't eat seafood myself, so I'm relying on the reactions of my guests to review this. Apparently, it was incredible! All the shrimp I made were gone within a few minutes and everyone was raving about them.  I made a dipping sauce using the orange marmalade, horseradish, mustard, and honey and it was very good.

Yummy!!  These were SO good and really easy to make.  I don't have a deep fryer, so I just heated a small amount of oil in a saute pan and fried them up for a couple of minutes, turning once.  For the dipping sauce, I mixed 2 parts orange marmalade to 1 part hot dijon mustard, and 1 part honey.  I added a couple of dashes of hot sauce and that was it.  I will definitely make this one again and again.

Delicious! From reviews before, sugar in the batter is key. Someone also also wondered what it would taste like with rum...well I used 1/4 cup of Dark Meyer's Rum because I am do not own beer...the rum after taste in the shrimp was scrumpcious!

A simple orange marmalade knock-off...yellow duck sauce (I use a very specific brand "Dai Day Sweet and Sour Duck Sauce) with a couple of splashes of OJ. Tasted just like Outbacks! I apologize if it doesn't if you make it...its all in the type of duck sauce you use:)

This is by far our family's favorite recipe I've tried off of allrecipes.com and I've tried a lot.  I used rum instead of beer and they were soooo good!  My 7 year old daughter ate as many as her daddy and I think they both would have eaten more if there had been more.  I will make this again (soon!).
I too made the marmalade, mustard, horseradish, ginger sauce and it was a great way to top off great shrimp.

My husband HATES seafood but one day I actually got him to eat some Coconut shrimp when we went out to eat and he loved it so I tried this recipe out to see if he would like it homecooked.  Since I love seafood so much, I was overjoyed to find out he loved these shrimp!  Congrats on being the first seafood recipe my husband will eat!  Wonderful recipe and easy to prepare!

This is the new favorite at our house. Made them for Mother's Day. My mom always orders them at restaurants and complains that there is never enough. Made enough that she couldn't finish them all. Great recipe ! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Served with marmalade,hr and mustard sauce. My mom has made a standing request to serve this at all special events until further notice.

Oh my goodness were these ever good!  I will probably only make once in awhile due to the fact that they aren't the healthiest thing for you though.  Loved the sweetness that the coconut gave the shrimp.  I used precooked, deveined shrimp to save myself some time.

My husband and I both thought these were delicious...very similar to the coconut shrimp served at a favorite restaurant of ours.  My hubby does not like shrimp AT ALL unless it is prepared this way and he really did enjoy it.  We like the marmalade sauce just as much as the shrimp!

Easy & delicious prep ahead meal!   Thanks!
I used U12 shrimp and made the sauce of orange marmalade, Dijon mustard, & prepared horseradish (added equal amounts of HR & mustard until I had the flavor I liked).  
The combination of the heat from the sauce & the sweetness of the coconut were PERFECT!  
After I coated the shrimp & put them in the refrigerator, I cleaned up the kitchen until I was ready to cook.  Instead of using the deep fryer, I heated canola oil in a large deep skillet and fried the shrimp a few minutes on each side. If you are frying the shrimp in batches, just throw the shrimp into a 200* oven until ready to eat.

Amazing! I fried them in a pan in an inch of oil because I don't have a Fry Daddy and they came out great. I made my dipping sauce out of apricot-pineapple jam, mustard and red pepper flake for kick. Delicious...

I recently retired and began cooking dinner for my wife when she gets home so I consider myself a bonified rookie. Every once in a while I make a recipe that is so good that I can hardly believe I made it.  This is one of those treats. I made this exactly like the recipe stated except I left out the coconut only because I don't care much for the taste. I must say that I surprised myself on how good I can cook. The dip was also perfect for this recipe. However the cooking oil leaves a bad odor that spread throughout the house....

Really good company recipe.  It always impresses.  I'll agree that it is a bit messy to make but it is so worth it!  Don't forget to refrigerate the shrimp for 30 minutes or longer.  They hold up so much better when frying.

I don't like shrimp myself but am told that this recipe is just as good as, if not better, than restaurant quality.  I used the sauce from another recipe (1/2 C orange marmalade, 1/4 C dijon mustard & 1/4 C honey). This is one of the best recipes I have gotten from this website. Will absolutely make again-it is a recipe to use when you want to impress your company!

This is a great recipe. The only change I made was to make the batter a little thicker. Made it for a date and he loved it! Unfortunately he wasn't a keeper, but the recipe is.

This recipe is delicious but don't stop with the coconut shrimp.  The batter itself is ideal for frying pickles, zuchinni, mushrooms, onions...you name it.  For this dishes I make a dip of low fat mayonaise, ketchup, honey, cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  It's delicious.

The recipes from allrecipes.com just keep getting better and better!! Tried this tonight with rave reviews. Everything went like clock work. My husband helped with the assembly line process and we then placed the shrimp in the frig for an hour to have the breading set. We used the deep fryer and the 2-3 minutes was perfect. Used the marmalade dipping sauce recipe and it definitely complemented the shrimp. Thank you Linda for this awesome recipe.

This recipe is wonderful.  I used apricot preserves instead of orange marmalade in the dipping sauce.  It wasn't as sweet tasting as the marmalade.  YUM!

this was my first time makeing the coconut shrimp.
It was very,very good. I used a honey brown beer.
and canola oil to fry. I didn't use a dipping sauce because the shrimp was sweet on it's own.

These really are delicious!  I followed the directions to the letter and my shrimp were wonderful.  I came back three hours later for the left overs.  They weren't crunchy as when I first made them but, they were still yummy.

They are wonderful.  A totally different sensation of flavors and textures.  I didn't have any problem getting the coconut to stick by adding 1/4 flour to the coconut.  I tried these at Outback and this recipe is sooooooo much better, use large prawns!

This is the very best shrimp that I have ever eaten. I first made them when my son was visiting here, we all loved them and I plan to fix them again in the near future..They were all eaten and were a hit for a lovely evening.

Although time consuming, this is an easy recipe.  After they were cooked, my mother and I both agreed something was missing-they weren't as sweet as we are used to having in the restaurants here in Florida.  But, a quick, light dusting of powdered sugar solved the problem and they were delicious!

I was very excited to prepare this meal for my husband. He loves the coconut shrimp from Outback, however I was very disappointed at the outcome. When I put the shrimp into the hot grease, the coconut just went everywhere, and did not stick to the shrimp.. I ended up backing them. They still had a good flavor, just not what I was looking for. The batter was a bit runny, so I double checked the ingredients and I did exactly as the recipe stated. Any suggestions??

Love, love, loved it.  Like so many others, I pan fried them.  Fridge or freezer a must.  Also added the 1/2 c coconut, sugar and salt to the batter.  Sticking not really a problem as long as your pan is HOT.  Only flip them once as too much man handling makes for naked shrimpies.  Sauce is to die for.  We had some Jasmine rice and Asparagus on the side - kids loved it too (It's a miracle!).  The only negative IMHO is time.  Put aside a fair amount of time.  It took me closer to 1.5 hr in all.  Maybe I'm just a slow poke.  Enjoy!

I thought this was a great recipe and the shrimp turned out great. However it seemed to lack something. A spice or something because it just tasted a bit bland. Other than that, I would make this again but figure out what I need to add to give it a bit more flavor.

I made these last night and my boyfriend and I loved them! I don't have a deep fryer though so I just put oil covering bottom of a pan and fried for about 3 mintues then flipped for another 3 mintues. A great sauce to go w/ them is 1 cup mangno chunty, 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup djion mustard, and 4 drops of hot sauce.

Yummy!! Will make again for sure. Also I think adding a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the batter would've made it better.

Awesome recipe! I made a double batch of the beer batter and refrigerated it and made beer battered fish with it the next day! The family loved it and it made my dinner preparations very easy the next day!

It took longer than an hour for preparation with cleaning the shrimp and chilling.  However it was my first time making coconut shrimp and it came out great.  Next time I will sweeten the batter a little bit but overall taste and look is fantastic.  Simple to make

Yummy! Very messy and labour intensive! But worth it. I made a big batch and froze the rest. Hope they cook and serve up well this way per the other reviewers.

Great!  Used sweetened coconut but the marmalade dip worked well to cut down the sweetness.  (Don't make the oil too hot or they will burn!) Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe, quick and easy, everyone loved it. Every bit as good as Outback's coconut shrimp. One caveat though the video does not correctly follow the recipe. In the video they combine the 1/2 cup flour with the coconut when the recipe calls for it to be included in the beer batter. I followed the recipe and it worked like a charm. I did add some Old Bay to the batter just to kick it up a notch. Fantastic!

This was very good although I prefer a bit more spice. It's easy and very tasty. I served it with shrimp & chicken pineapple fried rice in a pineapple.

It was too bland for us. I followed the recipe as is and nothing really excited us about it. Perhaps next time, I will add much more herbs and spices to boost the flavor. Also I might substitute beer for coconut milk. I will try again but with modifications.

Both my husband and I loved this.  I sautéed the shrimp in coconut oil rather than deep fry them.  I did refrigerate the batter for a couple of hours and, once it was on the shrimp, refrigerated again for 30 minutes.   I had no problem with the batter adhering to the shrimp.   I had shrimp and batter left over but no more coconut, so I made shrimp cocktail with the remaining shrimp and served it cold with cocktail sauce.  It was a very shrimpy dinner for two nights in a row.  I will definitely be making these again when my son visits as it is one of his favorite foods.

These were even better preheated in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes the next day! We made a yogurt, pinneapple and coconut extract dip that paired well with it!

As suggested by others, I let the batter chill in the refrigerator about an hour before using it.  I then dipped the shrimp in the batter and put them in the freezer for about 30 min before frying.  I didn't use the entire amount of beer but next time I definitely will, the batter was a little too thick without all the beer.   I served the shrimp with sweet and sour sauce and they were a hit! The japanese zucchini and onions recipe is a great side dish to go with the shrimp!

My family loves coconut so i added some to the batter too -this was the ONLY change i made. I used pre-cooked shrimp from my butcher block in the store and strongly recommend doing that if you've never cooked shellfish. That way all you have to worry about is how the batter looks and not about cooking the shrimp(make sure the shrimp are thawed out though). also you MUST refrigerate the batter after you dip the shrimp, the batter will not set otherwise.

Crunchy coconut heavenly delicious shrimp goddesses and gods-- can you tell the gender of shrimps... shrimps? or shrimp?... do they have genders?... whatever these androgynous beauties may be they are also delicious and this recipe is genius. Keep in mind that beer batter is always a plus because the leftover beer can't be wasted.

I made coconut shrimp for the first time using this recipe. My husband said it was better then any shrimp we ever had in any restaurant.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Made it before we went out so it chilled for several hours which was fine. I used the orange marmalade but for a little spice and color mixed in sweet thai chili sauce, it was great.  I am giving recipe to my sisters. Will definitely make when we have dinner guests.

All the adults liked this recipe, but I prefer the shrimp just a tad sweeter, I might add some Splenda next time. My picky 4.5-year old liked it but my usually not-so-picky 2.5-year old did not like it.

These wings and sauce were excellent.  They were a mess to make but turned out just like resturant shrimp.  I will be making them again.

These were AWESOME! For the sauce, I used a mixture of orange marmalade, habanero jelly and a little bit of habanero hot sauce. It was absolutely delicious!

These were absolutely delicious.  A little messy to make, but simple.  Made for a great weeknight meal.  Served simply with crinkle oven fried french fries.  DH finally made me take them away from the table as he would have eaten all 24 of them.  LOL!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

By far the best coconut shrimp recipe!  I made these and added ground pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the flour - it added a nice flavor to the shrimp.  I also lightly seasoned them with salt after they were fried - DELICIOUS!!! 5*++

When I make this everyone loves it. Just made this last night but used bite size boneless skinless chicken breast and baked in the oven and it was awesome. Made the outback marmalade sauce to go with it and it was just as good as the shrimp.

Thought this was very good.  Took another reviewers advice and shredded the coconut in the food processor so it would stick better, but found that it made the shrimp TOO coconut-y.  Would've liked it better if I hadn't done that.  We ate the leftovers the next day and they were still quite good.

Excellent! Just like the ones we ate everywhere in Maui! The marmalade sauce in the reviews is perfect for them.  I have made them butterflied and just as-is. Great both ways, but butterflied are easier to eat.  DH loooooved them!

Yummy! I got coconut batter all over my fingers when I was placing the shrimp in the wax paper but after refrigerating it for around half an hour very little fell out when I was deep frying it! Really good, easy recipe! Thank you! :) Followed the recipe exactly as written!

I followed the suggestions of food-processing the coconut and I put in coconut milk instead of the beer.  Excellent results!!  I didn't have orange marmalade for the dipping sauce, so mine was apricot preserves/dijon/horseradish.  I will be making this again!

Fantastic! This was excellent. Everyone including children loved these. I refrigerated the batter prior to dipping the shrimp in and coating with coconut. I didn't loose a lot of coconut in the frying process either. I made a dip out of apricot preserves and spicy brown mustard (It's what I had on hand) and that was good as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

SOOO Good!!! I pan fried them in a skillet instead of deep-frying and it worked perfectly. Used apricot preserves, dijon mustard, and horseradish for a dipping sauce.

Amazingly delicous!  I used coconut milk instead of beer as well.  I don't know if anyone else has said this but if you do that, reduce the amount of flour you add to it,  My batter was a bit too thick.  I served mine with an apricot sauce - loved it!

Came out great, I prepared them in the morning and left them in the refrigerator before I cooked them at night.  I fried them in a large deep fry pan about 1 min on each side and they were wonderfull. No problem with the cocunut staying on.  I made a apricot dipping sauce.  Will make again

This is a great recipe!  I used jumbo shrimp, so I needed to add more flour for dredging and coconut.  Also, I didn't feel like dragging out the deep fryer so I just fried in a pan on the stovetop and they still came out wonderfully.  Just as good as Outback!  You will impress with this one.  I also mixed up a dipping sauce with the suggested ingredients using dijon mustard and adding a tablespoon of honey as well as the juice of half an orange.  Tasty!

This was soooo good!  And easy enough for my fiance to make...he's not the best in the kitchen but these turned out perfect!  He doesn't even like coconut but loved it in this recipe.  Just like what you would have in a restaurant.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  We, or I should say HE will be making this again and again in the future!

I love this recipe. It is a favourite of mine. I make it as a "special treat" for guests. The only advice I can give is that the thicker the batter, the better. The thickness prevents making a mess when you roll the shrimp around in the coconut mixture. Thicken the batter by using more flour or less beer. Also, I dislike orange marmalade so I use apricot jam instead for the dipping sauce. It is way better tasting. Apricot jam, mustard and horseradish. Great recipe!

It was really good, but I'd have preferred it sweeter. I think that was my fault because we used plain coconut instead of sweetened. Other than that, it was delicious.

Great recipe! The only thing I would change is to butterfly the shrimp next time, but that's just a personal preference. We don't have a deep fryer so we just fried them in a pan with oil and they turned out great, and not greasy.

Unbelievably GOOD, especially with the marmalade dipping sauce. I made this for my family with home cut fries and deep fried those while I pan fried the shrimp. Deeee-LISH!

These were great.  We did run our Baker's coconut through the blender a few times and it seemed to stick to the batter better.  We used large-jumbo shrimp and did not leave the tails on.  That way all of it was edible.  It did make the battering part a bit messier though.  We used a light beer and could detect no beer flavor.  We deep fried ours on the stove.  Just watch the color.  Batches took between 2 and 3.5 minutes depending on where the oil temperature was.  If they are only taking 2 minutes, you probably want to turn down the temp or alternate and cook some frozen french fries to lower the temp of the oil. We put them in the freezer instead of the fridge to save time.  Left them in there about 20 minutes.  No problem with the batter not staying on. None of us like horseradish so we did not try the dipping sauce.  We used a homemade sweet and sour sauce and it was good. A bit laborous, but so worth it.

I've now made this 2x.  Trashes the kitchen but worth the clean up!  The dipping sauce is perfect with it.  Whole family loves it!  Make sure you chill in frig - ALL THE DIFFERENCE WITH KEEPING THE COCONUT ON!

MY daughters, son  and I loved them, my hubby did NOT. I made the shrimp just like it said, I added seasoning to the flour, ground up the coconut a little. I accidentally added the coconut to the flour,but it still did the job. One more inpotant thing tp consider,buy the biggest shrimp you can afford.

these coconut shrimp are amazing!  made this for a dinner party and my guests said they were the best coconut shrimp they've ever had!  i did substitute coconut milk for beer b/c it was what i had on hand.  made one user's suggestion for dipping sauce with orange marmalade and mustard since that was what i had on hand, too.  REALLY YUMMY!!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever gotten from AR!  I got 1&1/2 lbs. of large shrimp & followed the recipe exactly.  It made a ton, which was a good thing, all 4 of us just kept devouring them as soon as they were cool enough to eat!  Didn't even bother with the steaks that night!  Thanks for the post!

These were excellent and forgiving as I made them about an hour ahead and kept them in a 250 degrees oven. Very easy though I did smell the house up with the grease!

Very good! I found that a medium high heat is best for frying - the highest setting on my stove burnt the coconut right away.

This was the best recipe, I got raves, and the sauce was perfect. I added a few red pepper flakes to the sauce to put some color and a little heat in there. I put them in the freezer for a 1/2 hour before cooking. I think it made them stand up to cooking much better.

By doctor's orders I was instructed to cut down on my red meat intake. I really don't like coconut, but I tried this recipe anyway. I loved it, the flavors together are outstanding  and the recipe is quick and easy (The Panko bread crumbs make such a difference in the crunchiness of the foods you cook with it)I will definately make this again and again!

These were delicious and easy! Instead of beer, I used non-alcoholic ginger beer that I'd brought back from a recent trip to Bermuda.  Delicious--I wanted to eat the whole batch all by myself!

These always turn out great!  There's no way you need 3 cups of oil for frying.  I fry on the stove with about 1/2 inch oil in the pan. Served with pina colada dipping sauce compliments these shrimp well.

I really like this recipe. it was fun and really easy for me.  I have made this a few times now and the first time that i made this i added the flour to the coconut and had the flour on the side and it turned out great. this is something that is worth making again and again.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I made it exactly to specifications and it turned out beautifully. I made a Pina Colada dipping sauce to go with it. (1/2 cup sour cream, ¼ cup pina colada non-alcoholic drink mix, ¼ cup crushed pineapple, and 2 tbsp sugar) I highly recommend this to everyone!

SOOOOOOO GOOD! I added a little cayenne, black pepper, and salt to the flour and egg mixture. I used plum sauce with a little crushed pinapple mixed in for a dip. My husband says there's no reason for us to go out for coconut shrimp anymore!

This recipe delivers! These are the best coconut prawns I have ever had and they were not difficult to make! 
I tweaked the recipe only in tiny ways: adding salt, pepper and a little curry powder to the flour; cooling the coated prawns on a non-stick cookie cooling rack placed over a cookie sheet rather than waxed paper so that the bottoms would dry a bit better, and adding a little cream to the marmalade, mustard and horseradish sauce to temper its intensity a tad. I served this as a meal with fried rice (purchased earlier in the day from a Chinese restaurant and re-heated) and a crisp, green salad with a rice vinegar and seseme oil dressing. Absolutely delicious!

Fantastic!  Quick and easy to make, and way better than anything you can get at a restaurant.

I did end up using more coconut than called for.  MUCH more.

I also made a dip with orange marmalade, horse radish, and dijon mustard.

Awesome stuff.

This was soooo good!  Everybody couldn't get enough!  I didn't have any baking powder so I used Bisquick in lieu of flour and baking powder.  Worked great!  A bit of work but so worth it!!

This was very good.  I double dipped the shrimp though so the coconut would stay on when I rolled it through.  I didn't have all the stuff for the marmalade so I served it with sweet chili sauce instead which was good too!

Awesome... thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I added just a bit more coconut to the batter. Used the dipping sauce as suggested using 1/4 cup orange marmalade, 1T dijon mustard and 1T horseradish. Everyone raved about these -will definitely be making them again soon :) Thank you again!

This is a great recipe and pretty simple to do though it does involve sticky fingers.  I used a frying pan instead of a deep fryer and it worked fine.

These are incredible. Everyone I ever serve them to loves them. It's very important to chill them before frying or they will fall apart while frying. Also a deep fat fryer will change your life when making these, it makes it so simple to fry, oil doesn't go everywhere and cleanup is much easier. A plum sauce bought right from the grocery store is all you need in a bowl as a sauce to go with these, they are a crowd pleaser. Eat some before they leave home because you'll never have leftovers.

Holy holy amazing!!!!!!! i have made this before and they dont stick together well and theres barley any coconut on this.  These were AMAZING!!!! I made about 30 of them for 5 of us, and they were all gone within 10 min haha... I will be making these again very soon!! Tip, don't make the beer/egg mixture until your ready to dip, when the beers a little foamy in the bowl it makes a better coating.  Also you have to put these in the fridge before frying, it helps the batter stick to the shrimp.  Awesome recipe, I am so impressed!

I made these for my mother-in-law's birthday, got rave reviews!  I added a little cayenne to the flour for extra kick.  Even my niece who dislikes shrimp loved these!  The dipping sauce was excellent, too!

Good flavor, but hard to get the coconut to stick to the shrimp.

OMG what a great and simple recipe!  I didn't have time to refrigerate so I just made sure the batter wasn't drippy before frying and they still came out wonderful!  Also looooove the dip.  I had no idea that the dip they serve in restaurants was so easy to make! 5 stars!

I made these for supper the other night and they were pretty good.  I used jumbo shrimp (U6's) and they were just too big, so I think that might have thrown off how much we like/dislike this recipe.  I think I will try it again...but using medium sized shrimp.

Awesome!!!  I made this recipe to the letter for a special treat for my 15 year old daughter who loves coconut shrimp.  She says it's the best one she's ever had!  The directions were simple and easy to follow, and I had no problems with the coconut staying on the shrimp after letting them cool in the fridge.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this and only refridgerated the coconut on the shrimp about 20 min. due to time constraints and it still came out amazing..drzzled honey on top made an extra delicious bonus!

This was the best coconut shrimp recipe ever! I used the real big raw jumbo shrimp.  I made a sauce for the shrimp with 1 jar of plum sauce, 2 cups apricot jam, a few teaspoons of vinegar and sugar...I made a lot beacuse i tripled the recipe.  They were the hit of the party and I will make them again and again!  Highly recommended

Delicious. Everyone loved it.  A little messy to make, but the key is refridgeration of the shrimp before frying. Even my 7 year old daughter gobbled them up.

We use this for EVERYTHING, not just shrimp. Tilapia (amongst any other breading fish), chicken breasts and chicken skewers. I'm going to try it on pork!

This was a great recipe.  It's a little time consuming, but easy and delicious.  I used extra large peeled and deveined frozen shrimps and pan fried them, and it worked well.  I doubled the recipe to feed my family of 7 on a Friday night.

This was great.  Only thing I did different was added a little flour to the coconut and it helped it stick a little better.  Also I made a pina colada sauce (4oz pina colada mix, 3oz sour cream and 3oz crushed pinapple) for dipping.  So good!

These were super easy and super yummy. I didn't add anything to the recipe. The sauce was perfect but I didn't have regular mustard so I used Dijon and it was wonderfu. My husband and I will be making this recipe many times.

Don't be discouraged, this recipe is easy to make and the final result is delicious.  It was my first time making this and I am not an avid cook, so I was a little scared, but everyone loved it.  I made this as an appetizer for a dinner of 9 people.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe, relatively easy to make.  Big hit at our party.  The sauce another reviewer recommended was a bit hit.  Prepare and freeze these, fry when you need them. Cant wait to make them again!

yum!  i followed the recipe exactly, except for frying it in peanut oil and i guess i probably chilled it longer than 30 minutes.  the coconut stayed on.  the shrimp was delicious!!!  my husband said there was no way we were going to eat all that shrimp and he helped scarf it ALL down!  we dipped it in the orange marmalade recipe given by another reviewer (1/2 c. orange marmalade, 2 tsp. mustard, 1 tsp. horseradish, and honey to taste).  well worth the effort!  thank you!

EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A GAZILLION REVIEWS, THERE'S NO WAY I COULD PASS UP ADDING ANOTHER 5 STARS! I HAVE MADE COCONUT SHRIMP ONLY ONCE BEFORE AND IT WAS A DISASTER. REFRIGERATING BEFORE FRYING IS THE KEY. I SEASONED UP THE BATTER, PAN FRIED AND ALSO USED THE MARMALADE RECIPE FOR THE DIP ***  E-LENT!

These are so good! I refrigerated the battered shrimp for 1 hour. My Fiance was speechless. I asked him if these were as good as a restaurant's, he said No, these are superior! Will be making these again for dinner tonight. Thank you!

Great and easy recipe! The coating was browned perfectly and the beer batter added a distinctive flavor! We dipped in a glaze of peach preserves, dijon mustard, and a drizzle of hot sauce! Great sweet flavor with a spice that will get you after the shrimp goes down! WONDERFUL RECIPE!

The best coconut shrimp I think I've ever had! And, for once, the batter didn't come off after they finished cooking. We use marmalade, cocktail sauce, or remoulade sauce as our usual dipping sauces. Thanks for such a great recipe Linda!

was fantastic! just like one gets in the restaraunts. yes, takes some time but well worth it.  I made these up and added them to a coconut red Thai curry dish with vegetable stir-fry and sticky rice. Use the sauce to dip 'em or drizzled it over. Wonderful sweet spicy flavour! Highly recommend trying. ;o)

This is the best coconut shrimp I have had. We keep trying different recipes for shrimp and nothing ever did it. Who needs to spend so much money eating out to get fried shrimp when you have something like this.  I tried it with the Japanese Panko bread crumbs and it was just as good as the coconut shrimp. I also used some spice to jazz it up a bit. Hats off to Linda for sharing this prize.

I tried this recipe for  a party this week and I have to say it turned out better than i imagined it would. I wasnt totally satisfied with the taste..now i see why some people had marinated the shrimp first. Overall it was pretty good.

This was SO tasty but messy and if you forget one ingredient the whole thing does not work out.  If you follow it exactly, though it may be messy, it is worth it because it is awesome!

Made these for my husband.  He loved them!  He said the beer and the coconut was a very good combination.  This is in my rotation now.  I didn't change a thing.

Excellent recipe, I made these for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I refrigerated the battered shrimp overnight and froze them for a few hours before frying. Used canola oil at 350 degrees and hardly any coconut came off. A+++

Soooo good!  My husband and I absolutely devoured these.  Of course, there was a little bit of a problem with making the coconut stick completely, but that is true of any coconut shrimp recipe.  Overall, fantastic!

This is the first time I have made or had coconut shrimp, and it was pretty good. Surprisingly easy as well. I chilled the batter overnight, and that seemed to work well, it adhered to the shrimp perfectly. The breading was really good, but the shrimp itself was a little bland. I might try marinating the shrimp in something before breading it. It was still well liked, though.

These tasted pretty good...it took awhile to get the temperature right when cooking them.  I used a skillet instead of a deep fryer.

Good recipe that will satisfy for your coconut shrimp craving.  It is a bit time consuming and messy (which is to be expected!), and high on the calorie count (again, expected!), but a good treat from time to time.  I made the dipping sauce as directed, and it was a great combo.  I just ate them without any sides, but with the leftover beer as a drink. ;-)

We really enjoyed this recipe.  There wasn't any problems with mess etc.  just clean up as you go. Make sure to watch the tempreature of the oil, so the prawns don't get too brown.
Our dipping sauce was 3 tbs Orange Marmalade, 2 tbs Horseradish Cream and 1 tbs Dijon mustard 
I will be having guests over this weekend and will do this again,for sure.

Delicious!  A bit of effort, but perfect if you want to impress people!  Tastes just like Outback!  Update:  made for a luau party.  Cooked as is, then when I got to the party later, threw them in the oven, covered in foil for under 5 minutes to warm them up.  Still deiicious!  I use the dipping sauce from the twice-cooked coconut shrimp recipe on this site.

Just made these for the first time and they were delicious - a big hit with all! I used coconut rum instead of beer and it was terrific. Also, there was a lot of batter left over so next time I will cut all the ingredients in half for the batter to save some rum! I prepared them in advance and put them in the freezer for about a half hour before cooking. Perfect! Very little coconut topping was lost. I cooked the shrimp in canola oil in a frying pan on top of the stove. Be sure your oil is hot, but not too hot - and you will get perfect results. Large shrimp worked perfectly. Thanks to all for sharing on this terrific recipe!

I would give these 6 stars if I could.  They are DELICIOUS! My in-laws aren't really adventurous eaters but they cleaned these up in seconds flat.  I make this recipe my own by marinading the shrimp in a lime juice/chili flake mixture for a few hours or overnight - depending if I use fresh or frozen shrimp.  I substitute ginger ale for the beer in the batter recipe.  These are truly orgasmic.  I always serve a curry mayo dipping sauce (homemade) and a pineapple marmalade mixed with horseradish and hot sauce dipping sauce. 
My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This has got to be the best shrimp that I have ever made!!! I will definately be making this a regular meal item at our house:-) I got pretty frustrated, using a medium size shrimp, after tasting this, I wish that I had been more patient. Will use larger shrimp from now on.

Certainly a hit at our Wine Group's monthly gathering.  I used the extra large shrimp 8-10 per pound. Everyone raved over them. Expensive to use the extra large shrimp but worth the effort.  The key is to keep the oil at 350 degrees if not using a deep fryer.

Made these for an appetizer on Valentine's Day. They were good. My only problem is that I don't own a deep fryer and I hesitated to waste 3 cups of oil to fry 12 shrimp (I refuse to save it like my grandma used to). So, my result was cooked shrimp in a kind of cooked coconut breading. The consistency was kind of chewy rather than crispy, but that was my fault. Think I may try toasting the coconut first, if I decide to make them again. Also, I tried substituting rum for the beer as someone else suggested and it was yummy! As a dipping sauce, I reduced about 1/2 cup of OJ until it was syrupy and then added about a t. of honey and a t. of mustard (did not have the h.radish or marmalade) Result was good, since it was a pinch. Thanks!

The prep work was easy-just time intensive. I don't know how hot the oil was in my frying pan- but I had a problem with them turning black/burning almost immediately. Turned down the heat and the second batch was done in just one minute. I'd definitely make again, but lower the heat (a thermometer might help!)- very yummy! Didn't try the sauce, they were good on their own. thanks for the recipe!

This was so good!! I made it with fresh coconut that I shredded with my food processor because I couldn’t find unsweetened coconut in the store. I added 1/2 tsp. each of salt and sugar to the beer mixture, but followed everything else exactly. Used the dipping sauce from "Twice-Cooked Coconut Shrimp" and it was awesome!! Brought to a New Years party and was gone within a half hour.

This recipe was great! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used sweetened cocnut flakes which gave the shrimp an added sweetness...so I didn't have to use a dipping sauce. This one is a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time, I only gave it four stars because I had a difficult time with the breading falling off after one bite. The second time, I changed nothing, but it didn't happen! I don't use a deep fryer but instead put canola oil in a frying pan, which works just fine. I made two sauces for this: one was a combination of hoison sauce, chili paste, soy sauce, sesame oil, oyster sauce, ketchup and a pinch of sugar (for a spicy, thai-like sauce.) The other was a combination of pre-bought sweet & sour, horseradish, orange marmalade, honey, mustard and chili paste (sounds very strange but trust me, its delicious. Sweet and spicy.) Mix both to taste and serve side by side with the shrimp for a beautiful presentation and impressive appetizer.

I used heineken beer because that is the beer my family drinks ( I hate beer), everyone else loved it, I kept tasting the beer which grossed me out about it. I've had  beer battered shrimp and never tasted the beer, I'm guessing heinekin has a strong flavor. If I make it again, I'll find a lighter tasting beer

I've had coconut shrimp a couple of times at Asian restaurants, and I thought that it would be a good idea to try and make some of my own for a party I hosted. I followed the recipe, although my one lament was that the egg/beer batter dripped onto the coconut/flour from the shrimp, causing the coconut to clump together and not stick to the shrimp. However, they fried beautifully and (to my shock/delight) my guests ate all of them! One commented that they were surprised that they were this good considering that it was my first time using this. I will definitely make this many more times to come!

This is amazing. My boyfriend and I love coconut shrimp but hate paying so much for it when we go out to eat. This recipe is even better then the restaurants! I made a pina colada dip like the one at Red Lobster with Pineapple, and pina coloda mix.

This recipes was so easy to make and the results were fantastic. I was so surprised how well the batter stayed on te shrimp while frying. I made a dipping sauce using honey and spicy brown mustard which worked really nice with it.

Absolutely outstanding! I doubled the batter and coconut for this recipe and used it with tilapia (as well as soy "chicken"!) instead of shrimp -- with EXCELLENT results! I coated the tilapia fillets with flour,  batter, and lots of  coconut; put them in the freezer for 20 minutes; and pan fried for about 3 minutes on each side.  I forgot to make the dipping suace, but no one missed it!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made the coconut shrimp last night for Father's Day and it was a huge hit!  I made the shrimp up an hour before I started frying and it kept in the refrigerator nicely.  This was just as good as coconut shrimp I order at Outback Restaurant.  The few leftovers I had were delicious the next day reheated in the oven.  The only change I had was that I fryed them for 10 to 11 minutes at 350 degrees.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Just chiming in with the chorus of accolades -- this was delicious!  Don't be afraid to use sweetened coconut in the breading; the sweetness goes nicely with the sauce.  I didn't have any horseradish so my dipping sauce was made of approx. 1 c. marmalade (or any other kind of jam will work), 2 T. prepared mustard, 1 T. mayo, 2 t. curry powder (or to taste) and 1/4 t. ground red pepper.  The curry and coconut compliment each other beautifully, and the red pepper adds just the right amount of kick.  The family raved!

I was thrilled with this recipe!  We don't drink beer, so I substituted Pepsi, and it worked beautifully! (I would normally sub. water, but it didn't seem like it would have enough flavor.) The shrimp were very sweet, which is how I like them.  I used a combination of apricot-pinapple preserves, honey, and dijon mustard for the sauce.  Just as good and MUCH less expensive than ordering at Red L*****r!

This was great!  The only thing I did different was to add some panko crumbs in with the coconut.  It really gives the shrimp that extra crunch!

These were awesome!!  I don't need to go out to eat anymore to have great tasting Coconut Shrimp!!  These were just like the restaurants!  The sauce was great too!  I had to play around with the sauce in order to make it taste just right.  I wasn't sure how much of each to add but it still tasted great!  Would recommen to everyone who loves Coconut Shrimp!

One of my favorite recipes from this site.  Don't forget to chill the shrimp first before frying.

We had this as an appetizer last evening and it is delicious.  The shrimp and sauce mixture is a perfect pairing.  The coconut and beer batter makes the shrimp crispy on the outside and succulent and tender on the inside.  It is the best I have ever eaten and deserves a 10 star rating at least.

Excellent!  Worth the work, do it ahead of time and just fry it when guests arrive.  I believe this would work well kept warm in oven as well.  I made a tangy sauce with whatever I had on hand- be creative!  Orange or apricot preserves, pineapple, mustard, horseradish, hoisin sauce, let it sit a while to let the flavors blend.   Maybe next time I'll make two sauces to serve with it- I think a peanut-based sauce would be very good with this. (Like a sate' sauce)  I've never had this dish in a restaurant myself, but my guests swore it tasted the same-or better than- Outb*ck St**khouse!  I doubled the recipe and made at least 3 lbs of the 21-25 size shrimp.  Just delicious- don't overcook.  I will definitely make this again!

I liked this recipe and I would make it again. I am a big fan of coconut shrimp.  The ingredients are simple.  I used orange marmalade and a little horseradish to make a sauce which was very yummy. I heated it in the microwave to combine the indgredients.  It is a little time consuming and I think it is too sweet to serve as an entree'.  It would be better served as an appetizer.  Also, you have to make sure that your oil is the right temp.  I had a little trouble.  I don't have a fryer or a proper thermometer.  I just heated oil in a small pot on the stove.  I had trouble regulating the temp.  Next time I make this dish I will make sure that I have better tools.

We love this recipe! I used large shrimp and didn't leave the tails on when I peeled them. We cooked this in a fondue pot with friends. It made the deep frying very easy and it was a fun way to share a special treat.

These were so good that it was worth the mess of coconut in my deep fryer. I think the shrimp should be large because I used 35 of the medium sized ones and only 1/2 of the coconut and batter, and it took forever to prepare. We didn't use a dipping sauce because we thought they were great on their own. Sweet and crunchy - yum.

OK...The flavor was wonderful and my family had a blast, however I would rather having a thicker and fluffier batter. Make sure your shrimp are big enough to make prep time a quick one, because I couldnt´find decent shrimp and used the small ones, even they were great flavor the prep time became a nightmare of neverending shrimp to fry.  On the other hand you should definetely try these with the dipping sauce in the Twice-Cooked Coconut Shrimp recipe submitted by Holly, you will have reviews and wows for several days! Thank you both Linda´s shrimp and Holly´s dipping sauce!!

I made these as an appetizer to a Valentine's Day this year.  The recipe is delicious, and I would not modify it at all.  To plate it, I positioned the shrimps two at a time to form a heart, and also drew hearts with a red Thai dipping sauce on the plate.

***This was fabulous!!!******  I made it for dinner and my husband and children LOVED it!!  I have tried other recipes and the coconut always fell off in the oil.  This is the only recipe where the coconut stayed on.  I'm sure this will be requested by my family very soon!!

I've been looking for a good coconut shrimp recipe, and this one is perfect. I tried it the other night, and it was delicious, served with a side of sugar snap peas. I used egg substitue for the egg, and light beer. I was hesitant to try the sauce because it sounded kinda strange, but I had the ingredients on hand, and was pleasantly surprised. I found that using very little mustard and a little more marmalade was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is phenomenal! It was my first attempt at fried shrimp, and they turned out wonderfully. I didn't mind the 3-step battering process, it was well worth it! I only wish the batter would've stayed on a little better during/after frying. Now that I've tested these out on my husband, I'll be making them for guests!

i made these for dinner last night, it was a lot of work dipping these shrimps into 3 different bowls but turned out very good.  I took another reviewers recomendation and used 1/3 cup coconut milk and 1/3 cup beer.  i used apricot jelly, honey, dijon, and hot sauce for the sauce...(from the twice baked recipe) yummy.  If i ever want to impress a lot of people I am sure this recipe will do it.  thanks

Expensive, time consuming, labor intensive, unhealthy, greasy recipe that burns easily. I don't know why it got so many five star ratings. Even if this recipe turned out great (didn't burn), I would recommend ordering it in a restaurant instead because it is so difficult.

This recipe truly rivals the same feature at one of my favorite restaurants....wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!  I would recommend using a beer of more substance, such as amberbock or Guiness, as another person suggested.  Even N/A beer works!

Finally a good coconut shrimp recipe. Came out great. Used GUINNESS for the beer and it made the batter a little thicker which seemed to help the coconut stick a little better. Also gave it a nice flavor.

This is a HIT to for a dinner party because you  prepare the shrimp ahead of time and it takes very little time away from your guests to finish cooking it and serve it hot and fresh.

Awesome. I also put the coconut in the food processor and pan fried the shrimp. I pureed strawberry preserves, horseradish sauce and dijon mustard for a wonderful sauce. I will make this a staple!

Sooooo good and sooooo addictive...they're eaten within minutes of being fried. The accompanying dip is excellent as well.

I pressed the coconut into the batter on the shrimp and fried in a skillet.  Had hardly any coconut fall off.  Tasted great, even cold!

This sounded great! But, I didn't care for the coconut batter on shrimp. We just simply peeled off the batter and ate the shrimp. My sons girlfriend loved it, but we didn't. Sorry :(

Pretty good. Coconut was very sweet, didn't care for the orange marbleade sauce with it. WAY TO SWEET.  Next time I will use the a deep fryer, didn't get crispy enough in the skillet.

This is awesome! I did not have any beer an hand so I used milk instead. My husband was concerned about the amount of coconut on the shrimp but after he took one bite he confessed that they were "off the hook!". Thank you for the great recipe! =0)

Awesome...Restaurant quality entree.  We serve it for special birthday dinners...too many calories for everyday!  Serve it with Thai red pepper sauce-it adds a sweet/hot flavor that compliments the shrimp.

What a great recipe, it does taste just like a restaurant....I even used the batter and thickened it and double battered and left it plain for my husband who doesn't like coconut and he said it was the best thing I had ever made.

I am an experienced cook, and mom of 5. This didn't turn out for me. It was more like breaded, fried shrimp, with a hint of coconut. I'd really like to know what I did wrong, I was so anxious to make this. :(

I was so excited to find this recipe after eating coconut shrimp at a restaurant for the first time last summer. This recipe was just as good as the restaurant served. It is a little time consuming, but well worth it. Don't forget the sauce. Yum!

This was an excellent recipe. I used the sweetened coconut which gave it a nice taste. I was out of horse radish so I made the  dipping sauce with orange marmalade, gray Poupon mustard, and a little bit of honey. Turned out great and was delicious  despite not having the horseradish. It made approximately 24 medium to large shrimp.

11.22.17  I breaded fresh, Gulf shrimp in the morning, put them in the fridge for the day, and had a delicious dinner in the evening.   They looked good enough for a magazine article, and took next to no time to cook perfectly. Served with Orange Dipping Sauce for Coconut Shrimp from this site. I don’t deep fry often, but this was an indulgence that will be repeated.  Very nice, restaurant quality, actually even better!  ****UPDATE 5.31.18:  A really good dipping sauce for this shrimp is Creole Marmalade Sauce (easy, easy to make, too) on this site.  Served last night with Instant Pot® Corn on the Cob, Three Bean Salad, and Summer Strawberry Buckle for dessert, again, all recipes on this site and all equally delicious!

These were amazing!!! I'm a huge fan of coconut shrimp when I go out, this was my first time making it homemade, and I felt it was better than any restaurant I'd ever had it in. I followed the recipe exactly as it was, and it was out of this world and so easy. The prep work took a little time, but other than that it was a delish fast easy meal/ appetizer. Can't wait to have it again!!!

This was a great recipe! My husband loves fried shrimp. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written and it came out so tasty. They came out golden brown and delicious. I let some of my husband's coworkers try it as well and they loved it!

I have used this recipe often it is my "go to" for coconut shrimp!  I follow recipe exactly and these come out so crispy and delicious. I make a dipping sauce with  dijon mustard and either Apricot jam or orange marmalade whichever i have in the pantry I have also used crushed pineapple if i have it with the marmalade and mustard!  YUMMY!

these were delicious.  coconut did fall off into the oil but I didn't think that was a big deal.  I made the recipe as stated although next time I would use a bit more beer - the batter was a bit too thick for my liking - and I would try without baking powder... don't really see the need for it.  Any other deep fry batter I use does not have it.

This recipe is delish!  Only modification I made was to add about a tablespoon corn starch to the flour....not the egg, flour, beer, baking powder, the dry flour....let the shrimp sit in the fridge for two hours, fried in coconut oil.  Just fab...thank you so much!

Oh my goodness...this is delicious as written.  Fun to prepare and you can then stick em in the fridge and go to the pool/beach/mall until you're ready to cook em.  When you FEBruary (flour egg breadcrumbs, I.e. Coconut FEC), I suggest pressing in coconut to make it adhere. Don't fear the coconut.  I'm not a huge fan of the stuff but I put a lot on and these were fab.  I sprinkled the finished product with a SMALL amount of salt.  Fam loved it with out sauce.I loved it with some balsamic fig preserves sitting in the fridge, but also loved it without sauce. Trust a southern girl; fry at 350 and you will be loved.

Wow. This shrimp recipe was the hit of my party. I made the dip that was in the description. I can't say that these lasted more than three minutes. I didn't change a thing about it. I highly recommend both the shrimp and dip!

They turned out very well, but were a bit bland.  I would suggest maybe adding some salt to the beer batter, possibly some crushed, fresh garlic.  I didn't have marmalade to make the recommended dip and used Frank's Sweet Chili dipping sauce, which was good.  My son squeezed fresh lemon juice on his and that was good too.  They need something to contrast with the sweetness of the coconut/shrimp.  Sour or spicy works nicely. I didn't follow this recipe exactly, rather the video that accompanies it.  I didn't put flour in the beer batter bowl, only in the first for the dredge and mixed with the coconut, which worked beautifully. This was the only change I noted from the original recipe. I would recommend a deep fryer as I tried a pot with oil and a candy thermometer, but I had a hard time keeping the temperature constant.  I will try pan frying next time and/or baking in the oven.  I don't think I would mix flour with the coconut if baking them, as I have found that the flour in the third/outer coating doesn't brown when making chicken wings and stays white, which doesn't look appealing (doesn't affect the taste). I have never tried beer batter before but I will definitely be using it from now on, rather than milk/egg.  I used Alexander Keith's Red Amber Ale. I would rate higher if the shrimp had more flavour.  It is a great recipe to play with to get your own signature taste.

Added some cayenne to the flour as others suggested, and just used frozen easy-peel shrimp. Tasted just like those you get in a restaurant, and were the first appetizer gone!

Fantastic recipe! I used sweetened coconut flakes to give it some extra flavor. I put a tad of garlic powder in the flour batter as well. To top the shrimp I made a strawberry yogurt. Chop up some strawberries, blend it with a mixer, and add some yogurt and sugar. Goes fantastically on top of it all. As a side, I did white rice. The sauce goes fantastic with that as well!

OMG this is good! Used Wondra mixed with dry parsley for flour dredge. Added few dashes Texas Pete to batter. Fried/sauteed in coconut oil. For the marmalade/mustard/horseradish dip, will use less marmalade and more horseradish next time - excellent, but would be better less sweet. Hope to find unsweetened coconut for next batch - that'll take away some sweetness as well. Will follow a reviewer's suggestion to chill dip overnight in future and maybe the batter too. Served with yellow rice and asparagus tips - yummy. Just as a footnote, if you are looking for true shrimp flavor, this is not the recipe for you - many wonderful flavors blend in harmony for an excellent meal.

Wonderful!! I made this today for my husband for Fathers Day. I followed the recipe and made the marmalade sauce recommended by 1Husband-1Hound. They turned out great and hubby loved them. Thanks Lindav10 for a great recipe. I will defiantly be making this many times.

My entire family loved this recipe!  My 6 year old loved watching the video and following along. We followed the video directions exactly and all worked and tasted great. One of our new favorites. We also made the dipping sauce they recommended but I didn't have enough orange marmalade so I subbed in guava jelly which I had left over for a gift basket and it was delicious. And I thought I would never use that jelly!

This is a pretty good recipe as is; however, I have a dipping sauce which is wonderful with this coconut shrimp (or any kind of shrimp for that matter).  Simply mix 3/4 cup pineapple/apricot preserves and 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish in a microwave safe dish. Microwave  on high for 1-2 minutes depending upon the power of your microwave.  Try it, I think you'll like it!

Amazing! I had this recipe made in a quaint sea-food shack up in Montreal and it turned me on to fried shrimp! I finally worked up the nerve to try it myself and OHMYGOD it was better than the Oyster Shack's!! LOVE this recipe! Will make again!

Outstanding, I might be going to Outback a little less often now. Came out perfect the first time, unlike all the other recipes I've tried, thanks!

I used 16-20 per lb. shrimp, Fat Tire Amber Ale and I broke open a fresh coconut and hand grated the longest fattest coconut flakes I could which made for and extra crispy nutty coconut far superior to what you get out of a bag.

I used the recommended orange marmalade, horseradish & mustard dip.  I may try a few others including a sweet chili sauce next time.

MMM!! Heaven sent! I have been longing for coconut shrimp (live out-of-the-country) and this recipe went beyond my expectations! I used Kona Fire Rock (Hawaiian beer) and added a little bit of black pepper and parsley to the batter. I used canola oil for frying and added in some coconut oil to enhance the taste (amazing!). I also made the suggested dipping sauce and it was fantastic! I had 6 guests over on Good Friday and they all raved about the shrimp! Thank you for a great contribution. I think I'll make this my Good Friday tradition. :)

I was a bit confused when I made this.  The video instructions differ from the written instructions, but I combined them and it was an amazing hit.  I made the beer batter as per the written instructions, but added a bit of flour to the coconut as per the video instructions.  The batter was perfect. I had no problems with the coconut sticking.  It was a fabulous flavour.  Thanks for a great recipe :D

I agree with the reviewer who said the larger the shrimp, the less work to do. My family loved this. I will try it again with some spices in the flour to season it up. Nice one!

These were PERFECT! I used 1/3 cup Parrot Bay coconut rum and 1/3 cup coconut milk in place of the beer. Followed another review and added ½ cup of the coconut, 1 T sugar and ½ t salt to the batter and then put the battered shrimp in the freezer for 15 minutes before deep frying. The recommendation for the orange marmalade is the perfect addition. They taste exactly like Outback’s!

i prepared these at night and refrigerated until the next evening and they still came out great! only thing i changed was using coconut milk instead of beer. love that all i needed to do after a long day at work was fry these up, a couple minutes on each side.

Ahhhh, this is the exception!  Beyond wonderful.   I did hope they weren't good because they were time consuming and very messy to make!  HOWEVER.... They were fantastic!  The sauce of horseradish, marmalade, and mustard was perfect!  I used Bud Light Lime for the beer and sweetened coconut flakes.  You will not regret making this, especially if you recruit someone to clean up after you!

Delicious! We used large shrimp (16/21) so the frying time was a little bit longer but it was very easy and super yummy. Made orange marmalade dip to go with it ( mix 1/2 c. orange marmalade, 2 tsp stone ground mustard, 1 tsp horseradish)

Use bigger shrimp! I didn't read the reviews like I normally do and just used medium sized shrimp. The coconut barely stayed on. I had to squish the shrimp and the coconut into a ball with my hands to quickly put it down before it fell off the shrimp.  I pan fried instead because it gave me better control of handling the shrimp. I don't think I will make this again unless requested.

We used 1/2 cup flour mixed with 1/4 cup corn starch and added onion powder, cayenne and paprika.  Then divided it for use.  We LOVE this recipe!!! We use the batter, minus the coconut for other beer battered foods.

Made these alot and it's always a hit even.  Plus, my husband is not a fan of coconut but he always asks for them.  They are light and good with any kind of dipping sauce from sweet to spicy!

This came out amazing for me. My boyfriend and I loved them. I freezed them instead of refrigerate like some people mentioned and that helped a lot and the batter stuck to the shrimp. I also fried them in coconut oil instead of regular oil and that really topped it off and gave it a nice kick.

I made this recipe at lunch today for my mother-in-law who loves shrimp and she thought it was really good.  I loved it!  Looking forward to making it for my husband.  It was really important (and worked really well) to chill the shrimp in the frig to help the coconut stick.  I didn't have beer in the frig, but I did have pumpkin cider and that seemed to work and added some nice fall flavor.  I'm a beginner cook and this was really easy for me to do.   Thanks for helping me impress my mother-in-law!

Absolutely fabulous! The flavor is amazing! I'm not sure if this was intended in the recipe, but I used sweetened coconut so I didn't even need a dipping sauce. They are also WAY easier than I expected. If you're doubling or tripling the recipe though, make sure you have someone to help you prepare them because I found that was the most time consuming part.

One word: Awesome!!! I also made the orange sauce someone mentions in the reviews and wow...my taste buds are in heaven. These coconut shrimp are also perfect for making sushi rolls... use these, avocado & thin slivers of cream cheese on rolls made with the seaweed on the inside. Smear top of roll with sriracha mayo, drizzle lightly with a thick teriyaki sauce and then get two big handfuls of flaming hot cheetos put then in a ziplock back and mash them up...once they resemble breadcrumbs cover up the roll all the way accross  - sooo yummy!! They sell these rolls at our local supermkt, they call them Firecracker Rolls. Sorry for rambling..but the coconut shrimp really helped me copy the firecracker recipe.

My mom has used this on Chicken tenders as well with the same dipping sauce that the user recommended.  It is delicious.

this was really delicious!!   I will use more beer next time, or coconut milk to make the batter thinner.   I may have packed on the coconut a little too much :)   still tasty!  I got excited..    Next time I won't pack it so densely.    I used a stick of butter, a cup of coconut oil, and 2 cups of some random canola oil because that's all I had.   I used Mounds brand coconut and it worked really well!!  I didn't need to chop it in the blender.  For sauce, I made two: honey, horseradish and mustard (will try marmalade next time) and a mayo-siracha mix which I really liked on them :)     All in all, a great recipe that requires no tweaking, that I will use often!!

this is absolutely delicious. i wouldn't honestly change a thing! i made this a long time ago for my family (a huge seafood fan), and they were all very impressed! it's fairly easy, too! just really monitor the heat while you're frying them up, cuz it can get away from you pretty easily. delicious though, will definitely make again!!

My daughter and I loved them.  SO easy and tasty.  Better than at a restaurant!  My husband doesn't like coconut so I just covered the batter in flour without the coconut at the end and they were awesome as well.

This recipe is very time consuming but worth the effort!  I baked the shrimp till golden brown instead of frying and served to eight people with rave reviews.

I wasn't sure about the marmalad mustard dip but it was soo good with the shrimp (approx equal parts marmalade and mustard).  I usually find dips for coconut shrimp to be too sweet.  Big hit everywhere I've taken these.

Made this at least 20 times and love it.  I do make it gluten free with tom sawyer flour blend and new grist beer.  Chilling the battered shrimp for 20 minutes makes all the difference.  After seeing questions about alcohol in food, I thought I'd comment
that it works just as well to substitute ginger ale for the beer.

I made these as a special treat for my husband's birthday and needless to say, they were AMAZING!! (not to mention incredibly simple to make!!) I used 1/2c orange marmalade, ~1/4tsp of dijon mustard, subsituted dried wasabi for the horseradish (though be careful, you don't need as much! start with a very little bit and add to taste) and a little honey for the sauce. Absolutely outstanding and will be saving and reusing this recipe for years to come! Thanks!! :)

This.....was......AMAZING! I'm a beginner at cooking, and this was my first time frying anything, so some of my shrimp got a tiny bit too dark, but the flavor was OH SO GOOD!!! I used a 1/2 cup of locally made orange-carrot marmalade and mixed it with 2 t. stone-ground mustard and 1 t. of horseradish for the sauce. Oh, and I followed others by adding garlic, black pepper and cayenne pepper to the egg/beer batter to give it a little extra zing. YUM!!!

We love this recipe!  It tastes just like Outback!  And the suggested sauce compliments it perfectly.  We've added coconut shrimp to our regular menu.

Only made one change to this recipe!  My husband is gluten intolerant, so I had to switch the all-purpose flour for gluten free rice flour.  He had not had coconut shrimp for years because of the breading.  He ate 3/4's of the whole batch!!!!  I barely had any!  Served it with a mango chutney.  So Good!!!!

These are delicious! We made these as an appetizer. Everyone loved them. They taste like something you would get in a restaurant. I don't own a fry daddy so I just used a pot and some oil. My first batch burned cause my oil was too hot. So make sure it is kept at a constant 350 degrees which is hard when you aren't using a fry daddy. I need to buy one now I guess! But definately worth trying and so very good. No adjustments were made or needed on this recipe

I doubled the recipe hesitantly, because I was cooking for 7 and didn't like the weird measurements that scale used. (1 1/3 egg? Who measures a third of an egg?) I used wheat flour so that they'd be somewhat more healthful, and I didn't have a deep fryer so I just used a deep pot on the stove filled with oil. I used a giant costco 2 lb bag of jumbo shrimp (with like 25 shrimp per lb), and there are no leftovers. My grandma was astounded about the marmalade sauce. She loved how it was sweet and savory at the same time and really loved the contrast. My little sisters are picky eaters and when I was cooking they were like "ewwww beer smells gross", but they both loved this as well. Perhaps I should triple the recipe next time...

I made this tonight just as recipe calls for and it was delicious!  I have never made coconut shrimp before and was surprised how easy it was.  Will make this one many many times.  I made the orange marmalade dipping sauce and it was excellent!  Thank you for the recipe Linda.

Hubby loved this! Had no horseradish for sugested dipping sauce so we just used Wal-Mart Peach Pineapple preserves, and it was perfect! I pan fried so the coconut stayed on, and doubled the batch, and we only had 3 leftover shrimp. Sooo good! Made with Baked Potatoe soup and fresh veggies with rach dip.

I know I'm amongst the minority here but it really wasn't that good.  I found the beer batter underneath to take over the flavor so much so that it was almost too "eggy" tasting.  My husband considered it a waste of beer! Now, I wouldn't go that far but I will keep looking for a recipe that is more of a compliment to the shrimp and cococut as opposed to a cover-up.

AMAZING!  Pan fried this recipe (do not have a deep fryer), and put in the freezer for about ten minutes (instead of the refrigerator for thirty).  We used about a pound of medium sized shrimp, and definitely had enough batter for more.  This was absolutely delicious!

Deeelish!!! And the for the dipping sauce I used 4 Tbl. of orange marmalade, 1 tsp. horseradish, 1 tsp., 1 tsp. Dijon mustard and it was perfect with the shrimp. Definitely just as good if not better than restaurants!

The shrimp were time consuming to make and tasted okay, but I don't plan on making these again because I feel so guilty and bad after eating fried food.

This recipe was very good and easy to prepare.  My husband loved it!  Letting the shrimp chill in the fridge for 30 minutes is key.  Great tip!  I also made the dipping sauce and that was really tasty.

Did Not Like. Used Semi-Thawed Shrimp. Oil Was Too Hot And Burned Coating. Used Too Much Sweetened Coconut. Will Try Again With Cooler Oil And Less Unsweetened Coconut.

YUMMY!! We can't get enough of these. My husband is always asking for fried shrimp and I like shrimp but I don't like it that much I usually only have a couple of pieces of shrimp or even pick it out of the dish and give to him, don't really care for seafood. We never had coconut shrimp either. From now on I will have to make a double batch for me and my family cause We all love it!! I really like the orange sauce with it but my husband likes cocktail. We will make this from now on when WE wants fried shrimp.

Really, really good! Followed to a T and turned out wonderful! I have made with and without a deep fryer. In case you want your arms splattered with hot oil, use a deep fryer. (I had a blonde moment while doing it, hence the burned arms. lol) I also found a Pina colada dip on another site that I made to go with it. Very, very yummy! ;)

Family loved this recipe!  Of course I had to double it and used 1/2 c coconut milk to sweeten it as recommended by a previous comment.  Served it with warmed jalapeno jelly.

Absolutely the best!!    I have made these several times and everyone and I do mean EVERYONE loves them.   I usually just use orange marmalade as the dipping sauce.   They are great even without dip.   They are sweet and crispy.  I usually combine the large and small comconut flakes to be sure they are covered well in all the nooks and crannies.

This is fabulous - just as good as Bahama Breeze.  I added the 1/2 cup extra coconut to the batter and it worked great!  I have tried it chilling 1/2 hour and all day and it doesn't seem to make a difference.  My college student took every last shrimp with her when she went back to school!!!!

Love the texture of this batter when fried.  Easy to make and prep.  I only refrigerated for about 10 minutes because I was in a rush.  Next time I may add some salt and some other seasonings to taste and bring out the coconut flavor.

i really like this recipe! i am a huge fan of coconut shrimp and this tasted just like the real thing. the only thing that bothered me was how long it too to coat each one and the breading didn't stay on as well as i wanted it to when eating. besides that both my husband and i LOVED it and will for sure make it on a regular basis.

Very good.  One of the better coconut shrimp recipes we've tried.  I still crave for the coconut shrimp that I had  in Miami at Don Shula's All Star Cafe.  Now THAT's a recipe I want to find!

great recipe! We loved it so much that we wanted to make it for our daughter who DOES NOT eat anything that comes from the water. So we altered it and used strips of chicken breast instead she loved it.

I wrote the previous comment at least a year ago probably longer....I just wanted to say that we still LOVE this dish!!  At the end I take the left over coconut, egg mixture and enough of the flour to make it cookie dough consistantcy (sp?) and added a little sugar and vanilla and fried up some "balls" and dusted with powdered sugar for desert. They were yummy.

This turned out great, however we do not have a deep frier so keeping the oil to a temp that did not burn was a bit of a problem but after a few to the pups we got it down my wife has not experianced the down under version of these but I think they were better, thanks so much

Very easy to make.  My hubby and 3-1/2 year old son wolfed these down so it's definitely a keeper.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of coconut but even for me they were delish.  The dipping sauce I used since I didn't have orange marmalade, was 1/2 cup plum sauce w/ a generous squeeze of dijon mustard & 1 tsp horseradish and it complimented the dish nicely - I think any sweet thick sauce/jam/marmalade would work.  Definitely try out this recipe especially if you have "little men" in the house who are finicky eaters.

Someone told me about this recipe from this site.  I tried it for New Year's Eve.  It was extremely easy and DELICIOUS!  The coconut shrimp were as good as dishes I've had at resturants!  I also tried the suggested dipping sauce.  I used Apricot/Pineapple Preserves, Honey Mustard, and Horseradish.  It was simply delicious.  It's a dish you have to try!!

Soooo yummy! I used the sweetened coconut flakes vs. the unsweetened due to one of the comments about it not being sweet- and it was perfect. I pan fried them over medium heat and they turned out just great! WOW...that orange/mustard/horseradish dipping sauce is great! I served the meal with yellow saffron rice which was the perfect compliment. I even had extra shrimp that I coated and freezed which I am sure will be great once I fry them up later.

I pan-fried these.  You wouldn't think that the coconut would stay on, but it does.  These were served at a holiday party and everyone commented on how un-shrimplike they tasted - and how delicious.

This is an excellent recipe.  I read many reviews before I made it.  Like others suggested I prepared the batter ahead of time.  I wasn't paying attention and by accident added the flour to the coconut.  I didn't hurt the recipe at all.  I still dredged it in flour before adding it to the batter then dipped it in the coconut.  I also processed my coconut to ensure that it would stick. I laid them in a 9x13 pan and refrigerated them for 30 minutes (important).  I deep fried them for 3-5 minutes and drained them on a paper towel covered plate.  I used the orange marmalade, horseradish, and dijon mustard recipe others recommended.  DELICIOUS!!

AWESOME!!! I did not change a thing.  I refrigerated the shrimp for an hour before cooking.  Served with a strawberry dipping sauce that I tried at a restaurant (mix strawberry jam with water and whisk it until it looks thin enough to dip).  Thanks for the recipe.

SO good.  I don't like shrimp so I used little chicken pieces instead.  After the had chilled in the fridge, I baked them for 25 minutes at 375 degrees and then lightly fried them in some oil on my stovetop.  The recipe itself is fantastic, I wouldn't change a thing.  Aside from the shrimp of course :)

Wow! I don't cook very often or very well, but these turned out perfect! Quick to prepare and even faster to cook. We will make these again soon. Might add a little something to sweeten a tad more to suite my sweet tooth (I didn't have any dipping sauce on hand). Great Recipe!

Made these for dinner last week. They were delicious. The only things I would change are to add some coconut to the batter, as I prefer it a bit sweeter, and I will also wait until I have a deep fryer. It was a bit harder doing this in a frying pan (some shrimp cooked faster and burned a little) but I can't wait to try again in a deep fryer. Excellent recipe. The orange sauce is great as well.

I wanted to give 4.5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't normally eat seafood, but a friend of mine made these and kept insisting I try them... So, I gave in and  much to my suprise, it was VERY GOOD!!! (she made this with cooked coctail shrimp)  The next night, I offered to make these for my best friend and her husband who LOVE seafood... I bought raw jumbo shrimp by accident and therefore it was a bit of work, and a lot of shrimp... They however loved them! I will continue to make this over and over, but I will pay more attention when I buy shrimp!:) 
(I added about 1/2 cup of panko to the coconut which gave it a bigger crunch)

I never had the opportunity to test the recipe.  I made for some company and it was a hit!!!  I liked it too.

I would have like to try it baked, but time was not on my side.  So, I just followed the directions as is, and it was very good.

I'm not generally a big seafood fan of any sort. But when my younger brother made these the other night, the house smelled so wonderful, I had to give them a try. Wow, the whole batch was gone in less than 7 minutes! I had to steal the recipe and make them when I got home the next day! Wonderful!!!

Absolutely wonderful and so easy to make. Better than I've had in restaurants. For dipping sauce we used orange marmalade, honey, dijon mustard, and hot sauce. Perfect compliment.

This recipe is awesome!  My family just raved about it.  Served with jalapeno jelly thinned out with just a little water for a dipping sauce...my family liked this even better than the marmalade & horseradish sauce described previously (though that is very good too).  Would also be nice with a Thai-style plum sauce, I imagine.  I did make the following adjustments, however: increased the batter flour to 3/4 cup (a bit too runny otherwise); added 1/2 tsp salt to the batter; added 1 Tbsp sugar to the batter (since I used unsweetened coconut); increased the dredging flour to 1/2 cup; and increased the shrimp count to 40-42.  I used half a bag of cooked, tails-on shrimp from COSTCO and had plenty of batter and coconut for this.  Will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

I loved this recipe!!! I wanted to use a hot dipping sauce, so I used 1 c sour cream, 1/2 cup mayo, adobo sauce to taste (around 2tbs) and one minced chipotle pepper. I also added a little cilantro and salt to taste.  It was a amazing and a huge hit.

My daughter loves this recipe.  In fact, it was the one she chose to include in a Girl Scout recipe book that her troop put together. It was also her birthday dinner choice.

Awesome. I printed this recipe out in 2000 and have been making it every year since. It's to the point where my friends request "my" cocount shrimp. 8 years strong and it's still delicious.

Perfect technique. Scrumptious results. A little salt and cayenne pepper were added to flour mixture. The leftovers are delicious right out of the fridge. Wasabi paste or wasabi powder/water rather than horseradish is a nice alternative in the dipping sauce.

Followed exactly as written, this is now one of my very favorite appetizers to serve. It's easy and really impressive. Like others reviewers have noted, make sure not to skip chilling the already battered shrimp!

So yummy!  The only change I made was to subsitute panko bread crumbs for the coconut cause I didn't have any.  But it was delicious and I think it would be so either way. I made the suggested dipping sauce using apricot jam in place of marmalade and served with brown rice and roasted brocoli...mmmm mmmmm!

I have been looking for a good coconut shrimp recipe and this is IT, finally!  I followed the recipe instructions to a "T" and my shrimp came out better than any restaurant has offered me.  Instead of the marmalade dip I mixed some Asian sweet chile sauce with a little black soy sauce and voila!

Fantastic and so easy!!  Followed the recipe to a T and they turned out great.  Was a little worried about dipping the shrimp in the batter and then leaving in the fridge - but I guess that is to firm up the batter for frying.

Served this with thai chili sauce mixed with orange marmalade.

Enjoy!!

Absolutely fabulous!!
I made this as an appy for my hubby's birthday, and EVERYONE raved about them!
I followed the recipe BUT I did add 1/2 cup of sweetened shredded coconut. 
I also used the dip mentioned.

Wonderful recipe. Great paired with the mustard and marmalade recipe several people suggested.  We did try to freeze some of the cooked shrimp for later. Unfortunately, after warming them in the microwave, the breading became a bit soggy and fell off the shrimp.  Anyone have tips for freezing/re-heating?

I would rate this 10 stars if that were possible - me and my husband loved these shrimp and they were so crunchy and had just the right amount of sweetness - not too much not too little. Following the recipe I ended up with way more batter so I could have made another batch if I wanted to.

Awesome! Very nutty and no need for dipping.I put the beer in the flour on accident and worked better because no need for eggs.  Also the time in fridge helps the coating stick. Well worth the trouble!!!

This recipe was ok. My boyfriend really liked it, and ate all the shrimp, but I thought the batter needed something else. I chilled it, but it just didnt want to stick to the shrimp and hold all the coconut. I might try it again...but modify it a little

These are awesome. So easy to make and just delicious! You definitely have to let the shrimp cool in the fridge before frying. Used 100% Olive Oil to make them a bit healthier and it was great.

Thanks!

First time making it.  My batter was a little thick and I chose very large shrimp which did not entirely cook through in a pan.  They had to be placed in the oven. I'll learn from my mistakes and I'm sure next time they will be perfect.

These were delicious and I don't think they were that labor intensive. You do lose some coconut in the process of frying but not enough to notice. Definately make the dipping sauce with it, I think it completes the dish.

These were a big hit around my house.  Although a little messy and I used a ton more coconut than called for it was well worth the work and mess.  Only thing I'll change next time is I'll gently salt the shrimp before dredging in the flour as I thought they needed it.

I've made this twice now, I followed the instructions exactly the first time.  And then the second time I was making them for a bridal shower where the bride has a severe allergy to gluten (which means no flour or beer).  I replaced the flour with corn starch and didn't use any beer.  First I dipped in the corn starch/baking soda mixture then the egg, then coated it with coconut.  I thought it was even better that way!  And they didn't last long at all and I doubled the recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time last night, it was so easy. My husband absolutely loved it! My husband told me to add this the "hubby's favorites" section in my recipe box. He also told me that I can use his Heineken anytime to make this recipe.

These were really good, just not quite 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I also pan fried.  I used the recipe suggested by another reviewer for the dipping sauce-marmalade, honey, horseradish and mustard-and it was excellent.  Very interesting combination of flavors.  I made for Christmas Eve dinner and chilled them all day, just because it worked out in my schedule.  The coconut stayed on fine.

This is by far the best coconut shrimp recipe I've come across.  My family loves it and it has become our weekly Sunday night dinner!  We use a carton of coconut cream pie yogurt mixed with about two tablespoons of flaked coconut for the dipping sauce.

These were awesome!! I doubled the recipes and took them to a small gathering of 7 people and they were all gone!!!!! I made the batter then night before and prepared the shrimp a couple hours before cooking, and I did not lose any coconut :) FYI if you like the sauce you may want to double it, did not make too much

This was a super-tasty way to make shrimp! I pan-fried instead of deep-fried them, and the results were still amazing. These would make excellent appetizers for get-togethers, though I'll bet you couldn't make them fast enough to keep your friends happy!

YUM! I made this for the first time for a thanksgiving get-together and everyone enjoyed it! I unfortunately didn't have any leftovers to take home. I do like using the bigger shrimp (tiger prawns) since there is more to eat and less work involved. Also, for the sauce i used the orange marmalade/dijon mustard/honey mixture and it was so-so. it tastes better when you warm it up (i put it for 45 secs in the microwave) just to liquify the marmalade and get everything mixed just right. But, i also found that this shrimp tastes good even without the sauce!

The absolute best. They walked off the platter. I battered and dipped and refrigerated for an hour. I did'nt have sweetened flaked coconut, it is not always available here in the Caribbean, so I used fresh grated coconut. Yum. Yum.

Excellent and very easy recipe.  Up the quantity you will need to - they go fast!Made this for approximately 12 people and they devoured them.  
Served with 1 jar 10 ounce pineapple preserves combined with 1/2 cup soy sauce heated until hot for dipping sauce.  Your guests will requests this again and again!

These were delicious! We had a few bags of shrimp in the freezer and were keen to try this recipe. They are excellent accompanied by a nice cold beer. I made about 30-35 medium shrimp with this recipe and pan-fried them. I also made a sauce of 1/2 cup marmalade and 3 tsp english mustard and it was to die for! Will definitely be making these again. One hint: if you choose to pan fry these, watch them very carefully as they brown VERY quickly!

Delicious!! My boyfriend couldn't stop eating them! I'm definately going to make cook this again. I am going to use this recipe to cook for football parties coming up in September. 

The dipping sauce I used was sweet and sour sauce (Asian chili sauce). It complemented the dish very well and gave it a wonderful taste! 

Love this recipe!!!

Mildly sweet and very good.  Xtra Jumbo's were on sale so I thought that bigger is always better.  Not in this case.  I had to put them in the oven to make sure they were done so I will be sure to go with a smaller size next time.  I also made a dip with mayo, duck sauce and honey mustard.

These were delicious.  I dont have a deep fryer, or even a deep pan, but if you chill them like suggested the batter wont fall off while you fry them one side at a time in a regular frying pan.  I made a dipping sauce of mayo, sour cream, dijon mustard, orange marmalade, and ground ginger.  Also, a honey mustard sauce with a dash of chili powder is also good.  We made 3 times the amount needed because we were expecting guests, they didnt come...but by midnight the tray was empty.  I made some the next day without the tails and tossed them in a green salad with an asian dressing - delicious, we are addicted!

This is absolutely restaurant quality! Ladies, get out your tableclothes and candles and pretend like your dining room is a restaurant! Preparation is work intensive so plan to make these on a day when you can leisurely put them together in the late afternoon. I didn't have any problems with "running" batter and I followed the recipe exactly. The beer was quite foamy when I poured it from the bottle which, combined with the baking powder, made a nice fluffy batter. I used the dip recipe from the "twice-cooked coconut shrimp" recipe with a little less honey than called for. Perfect combo. Thanks for sharing!

If I could give more stars I would!!! Absolutely delicious! Like others said, it's best eaten right away and if it sits around it'll get soft but you could always pop it in the oven for a while at around 200-300 degrees to get the crunch back in it. Will continue to make for special occasions since it's not the healthiest to eat everyday but it's so easy to make!

I made this with a friend the other night for our boyfriends. Everyone loved it. We doubled the batter recipe and made it with 72 medium shrimp. We didn't have any problems with the coconut burning, which we were scared about. We made the dip using orange marmalade, horse radish sauce and honey dijon mustard to taste, but the shrimp were delicious without it!

Wow these are awesome.  They are so easy to make too.  I prepared them a few hours before we were to eat them.  I used 24 medium shrimp because that's what I had.  You really need a thermometer for this too because if you're not monitoring the oil temp the shrimp will just brown way too quickly.  340 degrees worked well for me.  I made a pineapple, horseradish, dijon mustard dipping sauce and it was awesome too.  Thanks for this recipe.  I will be making it again and again.

There are not enough stars for this recipe.  This tastes just like the ones you order at a fancy  restaurant.  I will be making this again.  It's so simple also.  I used a marmalade, honey, spicy mustard, and ginger sauce.  Delish!

These were excellent.  The only problem I had was using the sweetened coconut, the outside turned almost black before the shrimp was cooked on the inside, but it didn't taste burnt so it was all good.

I was so happy when I found this recipe.  However, when I made it I found that the shrimp were sweeter and more oily than I thought.  I may try this recipe again and just coat one side of the shrimp with the coconut.

This recipe is always requested with my family! I find it is easiest to allow the shrimp to sit a few hours in the fridge before I fry them.  I serve them with roasted new potatoes, hush puppies, and a simple salad. Excellent for a special meal with Tuna or Mahi Rockefeller (Use the sauce from the Rockin' Oyster Rockefeller recipe on this site).

very good! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderfully for my fiancee's family gathering.I also made the orange marmalade dip as few readers suggested, but my ratios must have been off because I was not "wow'd" by the taste. However, the coconut shrimp was well-received and I did get good comments by others for the dipping sauce. Thanks for sharing it!

Awesome!  My girlfriend requested them again only a week later.  I used 3 Tbsp. mayo because I was out of eggs and I am going to continue to do so.  Also, I used 1/2 lb. thawed 100-count shrimp instead of the big guys.

Absolutely terrific!! I wouldn't change a think to this recipe. My only suggestion is to use a darker beer. I used Sam Adams Winter Lager and what a difference that made. Definitely making this one again!

The only thing I would change is that I would use bigger shrimp next time.  My batter was a bit overpowering, but tasty.  I also fried them in extra virgin coconut oil, although expensive it contributed to a great coconut flavor.

luv this. Next time I will soak the shrimp in salt water for about 15 minutes to some additional taste.  Also added paparika, salt, pepper to initial flour dip. Didn't have orange marmalade so used pineapple with rest of ingredients.  Good but will try with orange marmalade next time.

Made this to get rid of a huge bag of coconut I had in my pantry. Great recipe. I added sugar to the batter but won't do that again - it made the batter change and become more brittle. Keep the sweet on the side.

Great recipe and taste! It does take quite a bit of work and preparation, but well worth the work. I should have made more, because they were eaten so fast. For the sauce, I used a different marmalade recipe though. Look for the twice cooked coconut shrimp recipe on this website and use that sauce recipe. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. By the way, definitely refrigerate your shrimp after adding the batter. It helps the batter stick to the shrimp, so it won't come off during frying.

WE loved how easy it was to make. But there needs to be a nice sauce to go with it. Maybe sweet n spicy plum suace.
Thank you

So wonderfully delicious... me and my girlfriend came home craving them after trying ones at a restaurant. These ended up better than the original. We fought over the tails to get every scrap. Its worth refridgerating them at least 20 min- otherwise the batter tends to come off in the pan.

These are always the hit at our family get togethers. Make sure you have extra coconut on hand. I always seem to run short.

This recipe is fantastic!  The shrimp came out great and were loved by all.  They taste just like a restaurant made them.  I added a little cornstarch for thickness and crunchiness but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I made this for the first time during an evening get together with friends and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it and it was easy to make. I prepared the shrimp and put them in the fridge for about 4 hrs. until I was ready to fry them and they came out great! I'll be making these again for sure! Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe although I found it to be a bit too sweet for my liking.  To fix that I mixed some Japanese Bread Crumbs (Panko) with the coconut.  They stayed nice and crispy, same great texture, but a little less sweet!

1st time making Coconut Shrimp and these came out excellant! I had some left over beer batter so I made onion rings. Those turned out great as well. And the dipping sauce went well with the shrimps even considering that I don't really like sweet sauces.

Wonderful recipe, tasted just like the coconut shrimp I first had five years ago in Florida.  The batter sticks very well to the shrimp, and when fried right come out to be a beautiful brown color.  Very crunchy and sweet at the same time.  Delicious!

This was a super easy recipe. I don't know why everyone seems to complain about dipping the shrimp in 3 different batters. That doesnt take much work. Work would be dipping, grilling, baking, then deep frying. But this recipe was simple. Dip 3X then fry til brown. My neighbors loved it.

Delicious!!!
some of the useful tips I will listen to next time:
Larger shrimps better!
blitz the coconut a bit.
We liked it so much we didn't even need dip.

What a hit! This recipe took a little more time than I expected, but it was well worth it.  I did about 40 shrimp, and froze half of them.  I put them on the tray in the freezer for about 1/2 hour, then wrolled the wax paper with the shrimp, so that none of the shrimp were touching.  Took the rolled paper and placed in a ziploc for a quick appetizer at a later date.

Made these last night and the only problem was how quickly they were gone!  Husband loved them!  Even the kids ate them up.  Definately a keeper, although the recipe was really too sweet to make for a dinner.  I will keep this for serving as appetizers when we have company.  Thanks Linda!

I gave these 4 star's because my husband ate almost all of them and he hates coconut. I have never had coconut shrimp before so I didnt know what to expect but I didnt like them as much as I thought I would. All I tasted was the coconut batter, I couldnt taste the shrimp at all. I dont know if I will make these again only cuz the shrimp was expensive and it was a lot of work for something I didnt care for but if I was asked to make them again, I would use this recipe. Thanks

Super great recipe!  I used a deep fryer filled with peanut oil for mine and for the dipping sauce, mixed canned manderin orange sections with spicy brown mustard in a food processor.

Much better than most resturant ones I have had.

Overall, I thought this was a very good recipe. However, I used large shrimp, and they got very brown before the shrimp were fully cooked. I also processed the coconut for just a few seconds in the food processor just to help it coat the shrimp better.  Very good overall taste! And much easier to make than I expected.

It was my first time to fry shrimp and this turned out great.  I used sweetened coconut, but I don't know if it was supposed to be unsweetened.  At any rate, it tasted delicious, and it didn't need any dipping sauce.  It was a little messy to make but well worth it.

This recipe is great!!  A little messy but worth it.  I may have put too much coconut on a couple but they still were yummy.  I don't have a deep fryer so I just used a frying pan on med/high.

Wow!  The shrimp came out great. The only problem was keeping the oil temperature just right - it's worth it to invest in a good cooking thermometer.  I will definately make this again and again......

I used medium shrimp for this recipe. The kids loved it, but my husband and I found it to taste a little too coconutty. Overall, I'll make this again for party plates.

You won't have to order another overpriced appetizer/entreé at a restaurant again.  Although this recipe is a little time consuming, it is definitely well worth the effort.  Thanks, Linda!

So Yummy!  Much better than what we have had at restaurants.  Make these at home, don't waste your money buying them. Really don't need a dip either.

Taste just like the real thing.  I use 2 BAGS coconut, no mustard in marmalade dip but a dash of cinnamon and a tea spoon of sugar with horseradish seems to work for me.  A deep fryer is a must.  Enjoy

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!! :)  Worked great!  I chilled both the batter and the dip as suggested by another reviewer... and I tried that orange marmalade dip... but it wasn't as good as I hoped... husband wanted a pina colada dip so I'll have to keep looking... but the shrimp came out great- especially after the first few after I figured out how long to keep them in the oil... :)  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

My family loved this recipe.  I made it for my brother and for his fiance when they came over for dinner and they raved about it.  I made a dipping sauce made of mustard, orange marmalade and fresh ground ginger, and I pureed them all together to make a smooth sauce, it was unbelievable.  Even my 7 year old niece and 12 year old nephew devoured them.  This is definetly going to stay in my recipe book.

These are FABULOUS!!! We thought they were as good as "the Outback". I found they didn't need to be chilled first. it made them much Quicker too.Thanks for the sauce suggestion too. I always wondered what was in it.

This recipe is so easy and turned out GREAT! I made the marmalade dip that one reviewer suggested. I also made the batter the day before and refrigerated till it was time to bread the prawns. I refrigerated the breaded prawns for at least an hour before frying! Company worthy recipe! :)

I would say it was good. Would change up a few things next time around. I would def say you need more batter. Less  beer?? My kids said they tasted it to much, didn't like that,,, and maybe some panko to make it a little more crisp. Also would use coconut oil to fry in to get that more coconut taste.

Very good.  My guests were impressed I made this. Looks very special.  I served it with sweet chili sauce.  I would add more salt next time.  I think the salt would balance the sweet of the coconut nicely.

These were good.  I added salt and Siracha to the batter as other reviewers suggested.  I gently squeezed each shrimp in my hand once they were battered then refrigerated.  I had no trouble with losing coconut while frying.  Next time I will try more spice and maybe rum and coconut milk instead of beer.

I just made this as part of Christmas feast, and they were declared delicious!  Very easy, coated the shrimp last night and refrigerated on a sheet pan covered with plastic wrap.  (I did take a reviewer’s advice and seasoned the beer batter.) Just heated up the oil this afternoon and popped them in!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

No where on this recipe does it say uncooked shrimp unless if you review the video (Boo/Hiss)   Neither does it mention to use sweet or unsweetened coconut flakes.   Needless to say I gave it a whirl but it sure tasted like .

This recipe was perfect. I followed it to a “t”, and it was awesome. I made it for my wife on our 12th wedding anniverary. She said I knocked it out of the park.

This was AMAZING, actually did 1/2 chicken tenders as the kids aren’t big on shrimp and they were awesome too! Perfect recipe as is, chilling is key. :)

Very delicious but the written instructions are different from the video.  I made them according to the video and not one piece of coconut fell off.  I will be making these often for family and friends.

Followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  I used sweet chili sauce as a dip both to save time and because it’s close enough to the outback sauce.  I thought about substituting coconut flour for all purpose flour but decided to follow the recipe on my first attempt.  I think some salt should be added to the flour and some cayenne pepper/paprika could be added for extra flavor, but as if, if you follow this recipe, you wont be disappointed.

If you would've told me two years ago that I'd be in my kitchen making coconut shrimp from scratch, I would've laughed in your face. I've recently taking up cooking to the dismay of my family. As a new chef, I found the recipe easy to follow. It turned out AMAZING! My family thought I'd gotten the shrimp from Red Lobster! Will definitely make again.

I stuck to the recipe and I must say, it was a big mess making them (I didn't buy shrimp with tails which didn't help) and some of the coconut burned a bit so they weren't picture perfect, but they were devoured so they must have been good. (I'm not a good judge of my own cooking).  So I'll make them again but next time I'll have them prepped and refrigerated early on and have the first mess cleaned up before I start the frying.  I had 46 large shrimp but didn't have to double the flour or batter.  There was plenty.

Followed the direction with the following modifications : no beer used Fresca!! worked fine. Also seasoned the bland flour to have layers of flavor, used shredded coconut not flakes, seasoned shrimp, batters, flour to have layers of flavor.. did chill.  Used an Airfyer so I sprayed  lightly with Pam and cooked for 12 min. Very easy and yummy.

I’ve made this a few times. My wife and I love it. It’s important to let them cool in the refrigerator overnight so the batter sticks.

This was easy and very tasty, like an appetizer you could get at a restaurant.  I used a deep fryer and the shrimp I used were large but from a generic frozen bag.  My dipping sauce was apricot preserves and a few teaspoons of white vinegar with a sprinkle of crushed red pepper that I microwaved for a minute.  I will absolutely make this again (the next time for other people!)

Really good.  Used half frozen, already peeled, veined, and cooked medium cocktail shrimp.  350* was too hot for the oil, cooked mine at 300*.  Crisped the coating and cooked through the batter without overcooking the meat at right about 3 min on the first side and 2 on the flip.
 
The marmalade/mustard/horseradish dip was amazing.  I could eat that stuff by the spoonful.

This is a great recipe.  Do use the shrimp with tails.  We did it once without tails on the shrimp and it was messy.  Just follow the directions and you will have a dish as good as any you can buy in a restaurant.  Using the 16/20 count shrimp will work perfectly with the three minute cook time.

Better than anything you could order at a restaurant. Make sure you follow the directions to really press shrimp into the shredded coconut to coat well, and the 30 minute refrigerator time sets the coating nicely so it doesn't fall off in the hot oil. Use jumbo shrimp for best results; they don't get overcooked while the coconut browns.

These were just amazing. I used a cast iron skillet because I don't have a deep fryer. No problems doing it this way at all.  
Get the oil nice and hot, work quickly in batches. Everyone loved them! 2 lbs went quickly!

This was very good but sweetened coconut would have been tastier. The proportions of batter to shrimp and coating was off. I made 30+ shrimp with this amount of batter and had to at least double the flour and coconut. Of course we ate it all!!

I made this tonight and it was delish. I accidentally mixed the flour and coconut together but saw no ill effects. Made the orange marmalade sauce and it was good. I did add some heat to it for our personal preference. All I had on hand was flaked coconut without any sweetener added. Next time I may use sweetened coconut flakes. Great recipe!

I made these last night and my neighbors and I all agreed that I definitely need to make them again soon.
I had to borrow a beer from the neighbors and it was a dark beer...not sure if that made it better, but I cooked up 2 lbs of shrimp and we scarfed them down in a hot minute. Even the kids loved them :)
 I let them set up in the fridge for about an hour before frying, and the coconut stayed on wonderfully. 
I made a dip with chili sauce, raspberry jam and horseradish sauce. 
Thank you for a fairly simple, but delicious recipe!

Because I had the extra large shrimp, I added about 20% to all ingredients.  Came out great - perfect and very flavorful.  I didn't have any marmalade, so used remoulade and BBQ sauce for dipping sauces - wow, great difference in flavors!  Sweet and tangy!

Ok, this is the second time I’ve made this dish.  The first time timid, in the fry daddy {so you can’t mess it up}
The second time, this dish sings, Put Me On The Menu!
This time instead of peanut oil, I used coconut oil,
Instead of fry daddy I used trusty cast iron.
I mixed APF, beer, baking powder, egg,  and coconut flakes.  Whisked, let sit,  then poured 1/2 cup coconut flakes in another bowl.
Get the coconut oil hot, dip shrimp in batter, then dip in coconut flakes, fry!

I would add salt/spices and use sweetened coconut next time. Extremely bland as is.  Tasted like nothing at all! One of my fave meals is *good*coconut shrimp, so this was a disappointing recipe.

These were AMAZING!  My boyfriend has already requested them again and told me they were better than any restaurant coconut shrimp he has ever had. I made the sauce mentioned in the other reviews - orange marmalade, prepared horseradish, and mustard. Can’t wait to wow dinner guests this summer!!

Made (mostly) as directed and it was very tasty. I had some sparkling water that I used in place of the beer. I didn't have to many issues with batter falling off during frying although the coconut/flour mixture quickly got too lumpy to stick during battering and I had to refresh it.

An excellent recipe that I have made twice now though I don't use a deep fryer.  I have a deeper cast iron skillet and clip a meat thermometer to the side of it with the probe in the oil to monitor temperature.  350 degrees is somewhere around medium high on my stove and the temperature rises quickly as soon as I add the shrimp so I need to adjust the flame a few times during cooking.  I cook one or two to test the temperature, then add three for a minute, then three more, flip the first, flip the second, remove the first, add three more, etc.  I think 330 would be perfect if I could maintain that.

This was ok - but a lot of work.  Next time I'll just steam my shrimp and make a coconut pie .  The batter must have some salt added - about 1/2 tsp - it has no flavor at all as-is.  I chilled the coated shrimp for about 3 hours and had no problem with batter falling off.  Pan-frying worked just fine.  In spite of uneven temps and the chaos of frying 48 shrimp the shrimp was cooked well.  I just didn't like having to eat through so much coating to get to my shrimp!  It was like eating through shrubbery.  It was fun to make once, though; we made it for Chinese New Year.  If you really want homemade coconut shrimp, go for it, just add some salt to the batter.

I would give this 5 stars, but I changed the recipe significantly by oven frying instead of deep frying.  I would have deep fried, but it was 8 degrees and snowing outside (I only deep fry outdoors).  I made this shrimp for Super Bowl Sunday.  Eagles won.  Served with spicy mustard and sweet chili sauce.  So, to bake preheat the oven to 400, I laid down a layer of parchment and sprayed with cooking spray, one layer of shrimp and spray those with cooking spray, too.  Cook 8-12 minutes flipping once.  Also, I really like the dried, unsweetened coconut from the Indian grocery store for this recipe.  As per some other reviewers some salt could be added to the batter.  I just used finishing salt myself.

Very tastey.  I used sweetened coconut flakes and put the shrimp in the freezer for 15 min prior with not problems of coconut falling off during frying in deep fryer.  I used sweet chili sauce for dipping.

These shrimp were part of a restaurant quality meal we made at home and are still talking about 3 days later!  To coat them was a little messy, but well worth it!  I had no problem keeping the coconut on the shrimp; I pushed it on with my fingers and then refrigerated for the time specified.  I cooked them in my cast-iron skillet where it took about 2 minutes each side.  The marmalade dipping sauce is an absolute must!  Delicious recipe.

My go-to recipe.  Everyone in the family loves.  I follow the directions exactly and use one reviewer's advice by mixing mustard with orange marmalade for a dipping sauce.  I usually pair with oven roasted sweet potatoes fries and a raisin/Apple/berry green salad.

This was fantastic! I asked my brother what his favorite meal was, and he reminded me of a trip we took to New Orleans, and the little shack/house that served the coconut shrimp with habanero mango salsa. So I decided to make it for him for Father's Day. (He's a pretty awesome dad to his son and step sons). Ten adults munched on these shrimp... and I was asked to open a restaurant!! Lol. They raved about them!!! My brother said, after the first bite, that he was transported back to that little shack in New Orleans. Success!!! Haha. So good to hear. I used unsweetened coconut flakes. I like them flaky. I also used 2 cups of bacon fat and 1 cup of freshly made ghee for the frying oil. The flavor for the shrimp really comes from the choice of oil, and the beer you use, in my opinion. I made a mango salsa, and a spicy mango dipping sauce. The dipping sauce won the popular vote. Wouldn't change a thing. Definitely going to add to my favorites!

My 12 year old loves these ! They are her favorite ! I don't wait the 30 minutes . I just go ahead and fry them up but I only use about 3/4 cup of oil in a medium fry pan . Also I made a dip from a recipe on here that has orange marmalade , ground mustard and horseradish ... YUM!

I put off making this for the longest time as I never make anything fried but I do love coconut shrimp so I gave in and made it exactly as written.  I was so surprised as to how easy it was and the end result was as good or better than any restaurant that serves it.  It was fabulous!  Husband loved it. For the dipping sauce I used Robert Rothschild pineapple habanero that I had on hand and bought at Costco.  It was perfect.  It would also be delicious with the apricot preserve recipe that was written. I will definitely make this again. So easy.

This was totally delicious!  I made mine a little sweeter as one reviewer suggested because I knew I would want it that way.  I still used the whole original recipe, but added some sugar, salt and coconut to the batter. I 'm glad I did because it did taste sweeter. I could taste the beer and I didn't much care for that taste and the extra coconut and sugar kind of masked it a bit.  I think next time I would try using either sweetened coconut and/or coconut milk instead of beer. I made the sauce with the proportions that one reviewer suggested, but I think next time I will mess with it a bit more to get a better flavor.  I thought it was a little boring, but the ingredients were workable to do to taste. I really packed the coconut on and pressed it in and chilled them for 30-45 minutes, and I lost hardly any.  I used pink shrimp and they were a little bland. Next time, I will try using white shrimp. I cooked them in canola oil and they were perfect.

I made this for dinner tonight. Turned out amazing. I didn't have beer so like another reviewer stated, I substituted coconut milk. Definitely will be making this again. I didn't have any dipping sauce but I will make sure I do for the next time. Thanks for sharing.

I will make it again but I might try the pancake mix way. My coconut stayed on. I used just a touch of sweetened coconut mixed in with the the non.  I will also try it with kaput flour to make it more diabetic friendly. I didn't feel the need for a sweet sauce.

Simply delicious and so easy! Daughter and I made following changes: Used gluten free flour (because we were out of regular), used about 1 inch of Canola oil for frying and simply turned over after first side browned. Worked just fine in a 12" cast iron skillet/frypan. We used cooked medium shrimp and could hardly stop eating them!!! Refrigerating is the key, we hardly lost any coconut and after they cooled (and we couldn't stop eating them), the coconut flavor was more prominent. 
We will make these again, and again, and again! Thanks!

The recipe and the video do not match. That is why I gave it 4 stars. I followed the video instructions and it was a 5-star dish, but I can't give it 5 stars because I have to rate the recipe as written.

This beats some of the best coconut shrimp in fine restaurants. My wife claims it is the best that she has ever had, too.

Didn't change anything, but next time I'll try using say 1 C of coconut for first dozen or so, and repeat. The coconut tended to clog up from the beer batter when shrimp was dredged. 

I add a little Tabasco Sauce to all my beer batters - it provides a little zest whether with shrimp, cod, or other whitefish.

With this recipe I used pre-peeled/de-veined and cooked shrimp in my deep fryer.

This turned out beautifully.  I actually chilled them for about 3 hours so I didn't lose any coconut off the shrimps. I didn't bother with the dip, I think they are great just by themselves.

I've made this many times and it never fails.  These are wonderful.  I follow the recipe except when it calls for refrigerating the shrimp on a tray I put them in the freezer.  It just seems to help the batter stick when frying ... worth the work

Yum, just yum. 
Used GF beer and GF flour. Prepared according to directions and they were wonderful with some FRESH Mayport, FL Shrimp.  
Served with Apricot marmalade, whole grain mustard, and horseradish and Miracle Whip. 
Did I mention Yum!???!

This recipe is so easy! I have made it the other night, added a bit more beer, kept them in the freezer for a couple of hours before deep frying and it turned out wonderful. My whole family loved it!!!

This was the first time I had ever tried making coconut shrimp because I had bought some fresh coconut at a farmer's market.
Easy to do- I would advise to read the other reviews and definitely refrigerate the shrimp after breading and before frying. Absolutely delicious! Impressed a tough crowd who said these tasted as good if not better than at a restaurant. A keeper!

This was very delicious and I plan to make again.  I used coconut milk and coconut rum, equal amounts.   I put the shrimp after coated, on wax paper layers in the freezer and then I fried a controlled amount to perfection.  The sauce/dip I added each part till it was just right.  This was delicious Thank you!

I will make again. The only thing I would do different is, not to put all the coconut in the bowl at once because it gets wet dipping the shrimp in it and you have to keep adding more dry coconut to get it to stick. But it is better than anything you can get in a restaurant.

I made these yesterday and they were absolutely delicious! 
The coconut stayed on shrimp. I made like 30 shrimp and I only picked up about a spoonful of coconut from the pan after they were all cooked. The only change I did was I used whole wheat flour instead of white all purpose flour because is the only flour I buy now,  and I don't know if that made a big difference but the batter was so rich and thick and helped for the coconut to cling perfectly. 
 The tedious job of coating each shrimp was not so bad because I had the left over beer from the bottle to ease the job,  haha.  
Just make sure you have the time,  it takes a while between coating each shrimp and then the 30 minute chilling before they get cooked.   My girls devoured the shrimp!  5 thumbs up,  perfect recipe! This one goes in my book as a favorite and will be making it more often for sure.
Oh one more thing..  The batter was so beautifully thick I ended up using  a 1/4 cup more coconut than the amount specified because each shrimp was so fully coated.  Came out really delicious!

I made this just as written, however, I DO believe this was lacking something, and that was salt.   Even perhaps a pinch of cayenne pepper too for kick.   Other than that, they tasted great.   The dip is what makes the whole recipe.  Don't skip the dip!   These are great for any game day too.  People will rave.  I used jumbo shrimp.  I wouldn't waste time on anything smaller, because the dredge, dip, and roll process gets messy.

I made it just like the recipe was wrote and it was very good, I do agree a little salt helps add some flavor.

I also used the recipe with a slight change to cook Mahi Mahi and it was to die for. Instead of beer I used Mandarin-Lime soda with 1 1/2 ounces of Light Rum. The alcohol in the Rum really helps crisp it up during frying. I then served it with a Sweet Thai Chili sauce.

Yum! Much easier than I thought! Added cayenne, garlic, paprika and garlic salt to the flour. Did just a tad less beer and pulsed the coconut in a blender. Once coated I put the shrimp on the freezer for 15 min. Pan fried half in butter and waited until Brown to flip. Baked the other half at 400 degrees until pink and just slightly Brown. Both very good but different taste. Sauce : Did 1/2c apricot preserves, 1t horseradish, 1t spicy mustard and honey to taste with a little salt. .

Simple and delicious. We were hurting to find something to dip it in, ended up using red pepper jelly on some and vanilla Greek yogurt on others. Added some sweetness and was easier then whipping up a dipping sauce!

It's always a good hit whenever I make this dish. Agree with some review here, what I did was to have some salt and pepper spread on the rinsed/dried shrimp over night, it seems solve the bland issue. Overall, this is a very good recipes, highly recommend it. Thanks for sharing.

I made this many times and it never fails me. I have shared it with my sisters & they love it too. I follow directions to the letter and shrimp come out perfect every time. Totally agree that time in the refrigerator is crucial, the longer the better. I can always get my sons over for dinner when I make these shrimp. If you want a restaurant quality dipping sauce use a.

Very Very Good! Chilling the batter really made a difference w/the outcome, so don't skip this step. I did add a little seasoning to give it a little spice/flavor.

Made it just like the recipe, and it was delicious. Made the sauce too : marmalade, yellow mustard, and horseradish (1/2 cup, 1tsp, and 1 tsp for mine). Perfect together!

Yes, this recipe is close to Outback. it did help to finely pulse coconut before dredging the shrimp. Husband approved!

This dish was fun to make and a real hit. I used a tip from another reviewer and made orange marmalade dip to go with and that was really tasty so thank you. A great starter to a 3 course meal or even a nice snack or a great dish for a buffet. Will definitely make again.

Made these last night--they were excellent! I didn't change a thing off the recipe and I agree, the pre-chilling prior to frying seems to help.  My husband said they were better than any he had ever had in a restaurant.  I will definitely cook these again.  Used a fry pan to cook them in with deep oil.  They weren't greasy at all either.

Love this recipe!  I prefer to bake the shrimp at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes turning once during baking.  It's prefect with the Orange marmalade sauce.  1/2 c. Orange Marmalade, 2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, & 1 Tbsp. horseradish sauce.  Yummmm!

Delicious! I made this last night and me and hubby loved it! I used sweetened coconut. The coconut and flour mixture started to get doughy making it hard to adhere to the shrimp toward the end, just FYI.

You need to add salt somewhere, maybe in the flour dredge AND in the batter.  That will bring out the flavor for those that said they were bland.

Absolutely the best coconut shrimp I and my family have ever eaten!  First, let me say WATCH THE VIDEO!!! It differs from the recipe.  I used fresh coconut flakes from Fresh Market because I do not like sweet flavor.  Used Floribean Key Lime Sauce, with some honey added, as a dip.  I agree with one other commenter, this is MUCH better than you will get at high end restaurants.

Delicious and easy! Bought ez-peel raw jumbo shrimp and took the tail off too. Tastes just like Outback Steakhouse. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! I have used this several times with shrimp, but recently tried with chicken strips. Turned out great! I did put the chicken strips in a 350degree oven for about 10 minutes to make sure the internal temp reached 165degrees. Juicy and golden brown! I like to serve this with roasted sweet potatoes tossed with salt, pepper, garlic, and olive oil. Great pairing! Thanks for this recipe!

I found this recipe a few years ago.  It is awesome!  My dad requested it, so I made it yesterday.  Just amazing!  Make it just as the recipe says, and you have a hit.  For my dip..I use orange marmalade, honey, Dijon mustard, and hot sauce mixed together.  I found colossal frozen raw shrimp at Walmart.  If it weren't so expensive, I'd make it every week.  I've been told better than what you get at restaurant.  10 stars in my book.

Excellent recipe, came out as described. The orange marmalade sauce is delicious too. The video doesn't follow the written recipe as it doesn't call for the flour in the beer/egg/baking powder mix. Use the written recipe, pressing the coconut into the shrimp after chilling really helps with adhesion. Delicious.

Mmmmm yum! Just like outback's! I chilled the batter for a couple of hours and placed it an additional 30 minutes in the fridge after I coated the shrimp with the batter. I also added garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the shrimp prior to adding the batter! Deep fried the shrimp until golden brown....soooo good will make it again. Great with the dipping sauce mentioned by others.

This was my second time making it and it came out better. I changed the beer to Malibu Coconut Rum and instead of the marmalade, I used Chik-Fil-A BBQ sauce as the dipping sauce. I also used unsweetened coconut. It came out fantastic!

Perfect! I used a frying pan to cook the shrimp. I only used about a 1/4 in. of oil. I used Modelo for the beer batter; it didn't leave an aftertaste. The shrimp was great even without dipping sauce. I'm never buying the frozen version again.

Wonderful. I made a few adjustments to make it gluten free. Instead of beer I used tropical juice and gluten free flour. They were delicious. My daughter loves coconut shrimp but her wheat allergy meant she couldn't have any in restaurants. She will love these when I serve them New Year's. Thank you.

Awesome!  Turned out perfect, made as directed except I used whole wheat flour which made batter a bit thick-added more beer to compensate for that.  Thank you for sharing this Lindav!

This was absolutely fabulous! I made up the shrimp at noon put them in the refrigerater and then when I was ready to make supper I pulled them out and finished.  I made the coconut shrimp sauce (on this site) to go with it and my husband and son raved about how good it was!

These were really good!  I used low fat coconut milk instead of beer in the batter and then pan fried the shrimp instead of deep frying.  I dipped them in a sweet chili sauce which was also really good.  The only caveat was that if I had not used the dipping sauce, I feel like the shrimp would have needed a little something extra in them, maybe something to add a little kick.  I will definitely be making these again!

This is a great and easy recipe. letting the shrimp sit in the freezer for 10 mins or in the refrigerator is a great idea, that allows for the batter and the coconut to stay on the shrimp while frying!

Excellent recipe, I prepare exactly as given but use Red Lobster pina colada dipping sauce.  We love their dipping sauce!  Preparing right now, about 10th time making & always receive rave reviews from my guests.  I live on west coast of Florida so always use fresh Gulf of Mexico shrimp, huge difference from using frozen.

I ignored the negative reviews about this recipe and tried it tonight.  WOW was it amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, and had no problem with the coconut sticking to the shrimp.  I think chilling the shrimp in the fridge 30 minutes before frying really helps. I made the orange marmalade sauce too, and also added fried rice and a dinner roll to complete the meal.  It seriously tasted just like Outback.  My husband was crazy about it.  Definitely a keeper.  :)

Okay, for once I have some useful advice :) When dredging in the coconut/flour combination, just do it once quickly on each side. I kept turning the shrimp over and over, trying to get more coconut flakes on, but that actually made the batter come off. 
In general, this was okay, but I don't think I would make again. I used frozen shrimp (defrosted, obviously), so maybe would be better with fresh. 
I didnt have any horseradish for the sauce, so just mixed marmalade and dijon mustard. Good enough.

Delicious.  Simple. Moist. Really Good.  The best I've had.  Comparable to Outback Steakhouse's recipe!  You can't go wrong with this one. I followed the recipe as is, no issues.

The coconut shrimp was the best. I am allergic to shrimp so I didn't taste them myself but everyone at my party raved about it, calling it the best appetizer of the night. This was easy to make and cook with a deep frying basket (purchase a frying basket and just use one of your pots as oppose to a deep fryer). If you are making a batch for a party then these can take a bit of time to prepare (I did each shrimp individually) so I definitely suggest making them the night before.  I listened to a reviewer's advice and used warm raspberry sauce as the dipping sauce even though most people ate it without the sauce (they said it was extremely flavorful).

These were delish and a hit with my picky eater. The marmalade sauce kicked it up to restaurant grade. It is now a favorite at my house.

Tastes just like outback- so easy! I added a little cajun spice to the batter and made a dipping sauce using orange marmalade dijon mustard and a little vinegar! I will never order this at outback again it was so easy to make and tasted even better!

I did this recipe but think maybe I used the wrong shrimp. Maybe if I had used the large shrimp, the coconut wouldn't have been so overpowering. I used just the small raw shrimp. Next time I will use the larger ones and see if that works.

I have made this several times and each and every time it is wonderful! You can change up the taste slightly by the beer you choose, and we have also used this batter for chicken. (my kids don't like shrimp)  Super easy! I serve my shrimp with a sweet/spicy thai sauce. MMMMM!

This recipe turned out GREAT! I used fresh coconut and added 1 Tbs. of honey to the batter to add a bit of sweetness.  Also tweaked the dipping sauce by using mustard powder and fresh horseradish to add a bit more kick.

These were the bomb!!!  Very Very good!!  I fried in a pan instead of using all that oil in my fryer...next time I will be sure to buy alread pealed shrimp and the big ones....I did about 50 smaller ones and had to peal so this dish ended up taking a while to make....BUT GOOD

I think maybe I did something wrong because the batter did not stick to the shrimp, and it fell apart in the cooking process.  Since everyone else is giving this great reviews it was probably just something I did wrong, but I won't try it again, because shrimp are costly.

I love coconut shrimp from resturants and now I can make it from my home for half the price and I don't have to tip anyone. I substituted rum for the beer and it turned good as well, of course with a different taste. I also served these at a hawaiian themed party! They were a huge hit! everyone wanted the recipe.

wow, these are great! Made them for dinner along with fried catfish and tempura shrimp. Tastes just like the ones from Outback restaurants!  I added a tablespoon of sugar to the wet batter for added sweetness. I used Thai sweet chili sauce as a dipper.

Loved it. We used unsweetened coconut which was okay enough but I would recommend sweetened for restaurant style taste. Make or buy a really good dipping sauce and you will want to eat this 3 times a week! We loaded our dipping sauce with pineapple. Yum!

I had never made or even had coconut shrimp before but it sounded good and my kids love shrimp so I went for it. IT WAS FABULOUS!! I lost a minimum amount of coconut in frying (chilling is the key) and the recommended dipping sauce was SO good. There were no left overs that night! My only suggestion would be to use bigger shrimp if possible (and affordable) as the batter gets thick and a bigger shrimp would make it look less 'doughy'. But over all this recipe has great flavor and is minimally fussy as far as prep. I'll definitely be making it again.

WHOA!!! This is my favorite recipe from allrecipes so far.  I did not make one change and this came out perfect.  I found this recipe very simple.  I had wonderful coconut shrimp at my wedding that guests raved about - but I think these are better!  I can't wait to make it again. Thank you for this wonderful recipe I will be making this for dinner and parties for years to come.

I barely can cook box mac and cheese. I made this and it was  divine! I am wallowing in postprandial bliss now. I used apricot preserves because I didn't have marmalade and it was still tasty. I looked at a couple of recipes and a few recommended chilling in the fridge after dredging/coconuting and before frying. I did this. Don't know if it helped but again....AMAZING!

Worth the effort and time. I had way too much batter left over, so I dipped bite size chicken breast pieces and froze for later. I pressed the coconut in with my fingers to keep better in place. I placed prepared shrimp in the freezer for 30 minutes, then fried on the stove top in a minimum of oil, next time will use more oil. Next time I will also press more coconut in for more coconut flavor. I butterflied half the shrimp, and preferred them that way, they also provided a better presentation.

You must chill for the 1/2 hr but it is soooo worth it.  If this was a dish @ a restaurant I would order it everytime.  Cheers!

This recipe tasted okay, but I also found that it was a little bit too much work for the turn out I got. The batter seemed to be separated from the shrimp after I cooked it, and I could almost pull the shrimp out of the batter completely.

Great recipe, great flavor! I made the orange marmalade dipping sauce as others suggested... 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2 tsp honey dijon, 1 tsp horsradish and 1 tsp honey..delicious! I think i fried the shrimp a little to long, so next time ill just fry until lightly golden brown.

OH YEAH!!!  Awesome.  These shrimp are perfect!  We tried the orange marmalade/ mustard/horseradish thing and couldn't come up with just the right taste.  Wound up using a spicy asian chili sauce instead.  Need to find a better dipping sauce, but the shrimp?! -- PERFECT!

WOW!! This was good. I'll put it this way..when my picky PICKY 6 year old eats it, I know I've got a winner! I prepared my shrimp then put them in the fridge for about an hour, then fried them up. They cooked up beautifully! I used one of the other reviewers suggestions for the dipping sauce, and added 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2 tsp dijon mustard, 1 tsp horseradish, and a squeeze of honey. I was really worried about the combination but it was delicious!!! A must try!

Delicious. My family ate the shrimp as the main course and while its been months since I made this, my mom still rants about how amazing it was. ***Only thing I would note for people cooking this for the first time, DO NOT let the batter get warm or it gets really thin.

Easy and delicious! After 15 minutes in the fridge I lightly pressed the coconut into the shrimp. The coconut flakes stayed on wonderfully during frying! No burning either, just had to keep a close eye on them as they cook real fast! I served these at this year's Super Bowl party and they were a smash hit!  Cheers!

As Rachael Ray would say-- YUM-O!  A great way to get a non-seafood eater or non-shrimp eater to try shrimp.  I can't imagine anyone not liking these!  I was a little unclear what type of shrimp to use since the recipe doesn't specify.  I got pre-cooked regular sized shrimp (I had wanted jumbo shrimp but coundn't find any) and they worked great.  Also buy the sweetened coconut if you want them a little sweeter.  Definitely be sure to get pre-cooked shrimp with tail-on and not raw.  I used sweet and sour sauce mixed with a little horseradish for dipping and that was magnifique!  These would make a great party appetizer.

Very good!  I used this recipe tonight - first time making shrimp! - and it was really easy and tasty.  I'll definitely make this again!   (I didn't have reviewer-suggested ingredients for dipping sauce but I did mix a little Bob's All-Purpose Sauce with Pace pineapple chipotle salsa to dip the shrimp in.  Not too bad! haha)

Turned out great! I put the battered shrimp in the freezer for 10 minutes before frying. After frying them I put them in the oven for 10 minutes at 325 degrees. Delicious! I'll definitely make these again. They're worth the effort.

Loved them! and I personally don't even like coconut but the batter and the deep frying give them a sweet and almost savory flavor that was divine. Even my husband who was slightly sceptical of the idea adored them. Used sweet and sour sauce for dipping(when we took the time to dip).
I only made one addition. I am originally from Southern Maryland so a HAD to add some Old Bay to the batter.
Gave them a nice zing.
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were absolutely amazing. Everyone in my family loved them. We just got back from Cabo and we had some amazing coconut shrimp there, my boyfriend said that this recipe is comparable to theirs (it was a 5 star resort!). The only things I changed/added was that I ran the coconut through a food processor, refrigerated them for about 2 hours and I sprinkled a little bit of sugar on them right after they came out of the fryer. I wanted them just a tad sweeter. I served them with a pineapple/apricot/horseradish sauce. AMAZING!!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I probably could have eaten them all on my own. The only thing I did differently was not refrigerating the shrimp afer dipping them in the batter. I just put them straight into the pan and had no problem with the coconut or batter falling off. I also had quite a bit of batter left over when I was done, so the recipe probably could have been cut in half. Over all though great recipe and I will make these again for sure.

Better than any restaurant I've been to! I put a tsp cayenne in the batter for a kick. I also added it to my orange marmalade, chipotle mustard and horseradish dip, sooooo GOOD!

I have never made coconut shrimp before but decided to make them because my husband always orders them from a local fish market/takeout where we live. these were delicious. Very similar to restaurant but better. I used jumbo shrimp and the marmalade sauce requested by other comments.

Really good recipe. I seasoned the shrimp first before the coating and I didn't have any eggs so I left it out the recipe and it still came out great.

If you are hungry for coconut shrimp ...this is the recipe. I enjoyed tasting the shrimp flavor with coconut. Very often when you cook shrimp other flavors take over and hide the great flavor of shrimp, but not  this recipe. I made the sauce  suggested by someone(orange) and that was great on the shrimp and the rice dish I served it with. I'm adding this recipe to my file-thanks

very good and tasty. we could definitely taste the coconut. i was a little worried because i'd never fried anything before, but this recipe was easy and actually a breeze to clean up. the freezing method some reviewers mentioned was definitely helpful. thanks!

Very good!!  I added a tsp. of sugar to the batter, which is thin, but it needs to be thin.  And I didn't make a sauce, they didn't need anything else.  I made 18 jumbo shrimp and had enough of everything left to make more. Thanks!

YUM YUM YUM!  Just like Outback's!  No trouble making them at all...and I used the suggested dip too and it was SOOOO GOOOOOD!  I made them last night for Valentine's dinner with the "Easy but romantic filet mignon" recipe on this site and it was a fantastic dinner!  I can't wait to make these shrimp for my next dinner party!

Would give this 4.5 stars if I could...this turned out surprisingly well considering we don't fry very much around our house! A bit time-consuming (we had a bag of about 60 shrimp), but the results were very tasty - my husband, who is not a fan of seafood, liked them very much.  Definitely would recommend the orange marmalade sauce suggested by another user.  Be careful not to eat too many shrimp, especially if you're drinking the beer leftover after making the batter!  haha

i became a member just so i can comment on this recipe!  it was AWESOME!  one of the best things I've ever made.  i used a pina colada type dipping sauce though.  DELICIOUS!!  1/2 c. sour cream, 1/4 cup pina colada mix, 1/4 c. crushed pinapple, & 2 tbs. sugar.  YUMMY!  we had pina colada's too.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Very Good!  no complaints whatsoever!

Excellent dish. I did not care for the sauce though. I made coconut shrimp once before and used strawberry preserves. All I did was microwave it for 30 seconds and I like that much better!!!

Delicious!  These tasted just like the ones from the seafood restaurant.  They took a little bit of time but well worth it.  The coconut stayed on really well.  I fried in a pan rather than a deep fryer and they turned out perfect.  I didn't need to use as much oil as recipe stated.  I also used the dipping sauce of orange
marmalade/horseradish/mustard/honey suggested by another and it was great.

This is the BEST recipe for coconut shrimp!  I followed the recipe exactly as it states and the shrimp came out perfectly. (I did use sweetened coconut)

My boyfriend said that he'll never go out to eat and order coconut shrimp and his mom and dad sait they were amazing!  Yeah me!!!  :)

My sauce was orange marmalade with a couple of tablespoons of horseradish.  Just add until it suits your tastes.

A really delicious recipe!  I cooked the shrimp in a pan as opposed to a deep fryer and used just enough oil to coat the pan and they came out perfect!  A definite keeper.

This is such an easy recipe.  The second time a made it I used a wasabi mayonnaise dipping sauce and it work well since the shrimp is sweet from the coconut.

I made these shrimp for a going away party! and what a hit! so easy! and came out great! thanks! also i used the dip that someone else suggested and it went beautifully with the shrimp! Also, to ensure that the coconut doesn't fall off i freezed the shrimp before frying them, it really help hold everything together! thanks again!

This was really good, and I enjoyed cooking it. I might try sweetened coconut next time just for a little extra sweetness. I made the sauce to taste, but I think I probably used 1/4 Orange Marmalade, 1/2 Honey and 1/4 Dijon mustard, I just kept mixing until it tasted right, but it sure came out good!!

This recipe makes you feel like you just did something amazing. I just got a deep fryer and had no experience frying anything but followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great. The shrimp sat in the fridge a little over an hour and I didn't lose much coconut to the fryer. I used a spicy mandarin orange sauce from Trader Joe that was inexpensive and perfect.

This recipe was simple and quick.  I used jumbo shrimp and they were great.  The batter and coconut remain on the shrimp unlike other recipes I have tried.  The suggested sauce was delicious and simple as well.  I plan to use this recipe often.  Thanks to the contributor!!!

I live in FL and therefore can get coconut shrimp in any restaurant. Because of that, making it at home just isn't worth it. This tasted pretty good, but it was messy and time consuming. It is just as cost effective and better tasting to head to the corner restaurant and get it there.

Pretty good, but didn't think it had enough coconut flavor.  It may have been just me because everyone else raved about it.

I thought these were fun to make and tasted better than the ones at restaurants!  I pan fried them in vegetable oil for 2-3 minutes on each side on med-high heat.  We enjoyed them with the Ginger Dipping Sauce submitted by Susan.  I'll be making this again, soon!

Shrimp was great but for five stars we would want a recommended dip.  We used some of the store dip and didn't seem to be all that great with it.

I think I used too old beer and coconut so it was a touch bland but with a sweet and sour dipping sauce these were great and they cooked beautifully, I'll just use fresher ingrediants next time!

This is basically just fried shrimp with a subtle sweetness and I enjoyed it.  I had some batter and coconut leftover, so I tried this with chicken as another reviewer had mentioned.  The chicken wasn't nearly as good and it'll definitely need some honey mustard or something to make up for flavor.  This shrimp is going to taste really good over my lunchtime salad tomorrow.

This recipe is terrific! My husband and I ate all of them. I plan to make them for an appetizer for a small party I'm giving in the next couple of weeks. If you follow this recipe from beginning to end, even refrigerating the shrimp before frying, you can't go wrong.

I got rave, rave, RAVE reviews on this when I made it for my roommates last night! I've never attempted to make coconut shrimp before so I was a little nervous but it turned out fantastic. I even saved a few aside and brought over to my boyfriend and he LOVED them as well. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes coconut shrimp. It takes awhile to prepare but WELL worth it. Thanks for a great recipe!!

WOW!! This is a really amazing appetizer. I wanted something to go with an oriental party pack, and everyone loved the shrimp. I'm going to try this batter with veggies n things.

These were awesome and really easy to make. I made them for company and made a spicy orange marmalade to dip them in. Excellent coconut shrimp, thank you!

Absolutely fabulous!!!  I borrowed a friend's deep fryer to make these, and now I'm going to go out and buy one just for this recipe!  So delicious, and tastes JUST LIKE the ones you get in restaurants. :) Thank you!  Boyfriend loved them, too!

I wish I could give this a 3 and 1/2 star instead of a 3.  It is really not bad, but the overall flavor could use some improvement.  You could definitely taste the coconut, but the batter was uneventful, rather dull and thin actually.  Super-easy method to make.

Wow-ee!!!  Really delicious, and worth the steps.  For my dipping sauce I used sweet-n-sour sauce instead of marmalade and added a few drops of hot sauce along with the mustard and horseradish, and it was yummy -- my husband raved over it, and he's not a big fan of seafood  :)

This is fantastic!  I used dark ale beer.  I use a dipping sauce instead of the marmalade.  This is a family favorite.  I have also used regular root beer instead of beer and it comes out great!

Yummy!!  These came out perfect! I let the shrimp marinate for a few hours in a little lime juice, coconut milk, sliced jalapenos, and garlic before coating and frying them. My husband and my 2 year old gobbled them up!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Wow, great recipe.
My daughter and I forgot to add the baking powder but it was still terrific.
'Just like the restaurant versions - maybe even better.

We'll definitely be doing this one again.

Good recipe.  I need to work on finding plain shaved coconut though.  All I could find was the sugared ones in the baking aisle and that made the shrimp a bit on the sweet side.

My husband is still raving about the coconut shrimp after having it for dinner yesterday. Even if he loved a meal, rarely does he mention how delicious something is over and over. He has asked me to make this recipe again in the near future.
Thank you Linda for a superb recipe!

Wonderful recipe...The coconut was a little difficult to work with (clumpy), so suggest using a fork to assume an even coconut coating.  A big HIT... Thanks!

This recipe was quite time consuming (between deveining the shrimp, breading the shrimp, etc) but well worth the time and effort.  I would definitely make it again.

Excellent - tasted better than the restaurants.    Also liked the fact there were leftovers to reheat for another dinner.   I just need to figure the correct temperature and time to reheat....someone else suggested 450 but they burned after 10 minutes.

Pretty yummy.  I used sweetened coconut flakes which added a nice twist to it (actually I'm b.s.ing, that was all I had in the house and I just prayed it would come out fine).  

I would add maybe a couple of more tbsps. of flour to the beer batter as I found it too watery.  Aside from that, great!  Definitely something you have to eat right away though.

All I can say is Delish!  This is just great.  I followed the recipe exactly, but forgot to put the shrimp in the refrigerator.  They still turned out great.  I also used 1/2 c. orange marmalade, 1 1/2 tsp. horseradish, and 2 tsp coarse ground mustard.  It is the perfect dipping sauce!

Great recipe, use as large as shrimp as you can find and afford for best flavor. These shrimp can be deep fried and frozen for do ahead ease, just fry for 2 minutes place in container not touching each other freeze, to reheat place in 450 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes depending on size of shrimp. Tastes almost as good as right out of fryer.

This shrimp was so good. Just like what you get in a restaurant.  I made the sauce of apricot preserves(that is what I had on hand), a little mustard and a little horsradish. It was really good.  Will definately make again and again. I fried it in a saucepan with about an inch of oil and flipped it after 1-2min.  It turned out perfect. No need to buy a frydaddy if you don't already have one. Thanks for the great recipe Linda.

I made this dish for a progressive dinner. It was the hit of the evening. It is very easy to prepare and absolutely delicious! Served with assorted dipping sauces-honey mustard was the favorite. Will definitely make it again-even my kids loved it.

This came out excellent!  I used medium sized shrimp (b/c that's all I had) and followed the instructions to chill the shrimp before cooking.  I ended up frying the shrimp and everything turned out great.  The dipping sauce I made was from orange marmalade, honey, mustard and wasabi/horseradish.  It came out very sweet, but in a good way.

i made these and was disappointed with the flavour, they were quite bland.  I realized that there wasn't any salt in the recipe so the remaining uncooked ones I sprinkled with salt before frying them and then another sprinkle after and they turned out great.  I think next time I will add the salt to the batter.  For a dipping sauce I used an apricot spread mixed with a little vinegar and hot chili flakes and just heated it in a saucepan to combine.  Husband and 3 year old loved it.

I made this last night for my family as I do not like seafood.  My husband enjoyed it very much.  Not sure why some people are complaining about the time and mess.  Thumbs up!!

Very good!!  I used sweetened coconut flakes which made them delicious and just like the ones I get at restaraunts.  I made a sauce to go with them, but they tasted so good I ate them plain.

My husband loved this.. Perhaps my deep fryer wasn't registering temp correctly.  I had mine in for 5+ minutes.  My concern was overcooking shrimp/undercooking as the batter was not browning up nicely.  I will increase my temp next time... my 
husband thought they were excellent..
