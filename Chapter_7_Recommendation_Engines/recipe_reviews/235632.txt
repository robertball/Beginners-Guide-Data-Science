I will cut back on the lemon juice but the flavors with a spinach side salad and a glass of red wine were delicious. I used rice instead of couscous and put that on the bottom of the dish with the chicken on top. This one's a keeper. Excellent meal!

Made this as written and it was delicious. Season with salt and pepper to your liking to offset lemon if needed. The sauce was excellent. I served over farro rather than rice.

I rarely review recipes but this is worth praise. The flavors are so bright and fresh that I could barely stop eating it. The only thing I did different was season the chicken with paprika as well as the salt/pepper. I find it is easier to sear that way. Served along with oven roasted zucchini seasoned with fresh rosemary balsamic vinegar olive oil salt and pepper. More recipes like this please!!!

Sautéed the garlic and shallots in the oil prior to adding the chicken. I thought it gave the chicken more flavor.

I omitted olives and capers because we don't care for them. I added Artichokes and 1/2 a can of seasoned tomatoes (basil oregano). It was very very good!

I try not to alter a recipe the first time but my BF doesn't care for lemon and the comments indicated it was very lemony for some... so I used 1/2 lemon and no zest so he would try it. We both loved it so many flavors to taste! Thank you for this one!

This "Pan-Seared Mediterranean Chicken" is absolutely wonderful. I used goat cheese instead of feta.

Wow love it! Hubby said it was almost as good as mushrooms and nothing is as good as mushrooms in his eyes. I added artichoke hearts and pappadam peppers as they were in the frig and I needed to use them up.

Used less lemon juice and no basil (didn't have any). Still it was very flavorful.

Followed it with the following exceptions, I did add some cornstarch to thicken it a little, chicken was grilled and I used a rice blend. Wonderful recipe, resisting another serving!

It was really good. Served it with a black bean and chick pea salad. Did not change anything thought the lemon flavor was just fine.

This recipe is a KEEPER! I can only describe it as a party in your mouth when it comes to flavor! The shallots lemon and olives along with the chicken stock...ugh! Just FABULOUS! It's kind of hard to screw up this recipe. The flavors all go together so well it is very forgiving if you add a little more of this or a little less of that. It's quick and FANTASTIC! Served with a garlic/herb flavored couscous (no it wasn't too much garlic flavor along with the dish itself) and sautéed string beans. A MUST TRY!

The chicken was really tender and delicious! I made the mistake of getting fire-roasted red bell peppers instead of sun-dried tomatoes. It was good but I may try it again with the sun-dried tomatoes.

Super tasty, I didn't have sundried tomatoes so I used grape tomatoes.  And my husband is diabetic so I used quinoa, and it was a huge hit!

This is a great recipe! I did change it to reduce calories. I used canned peeled and drained Roma tomatoes instead of sun-dried tomatoes replaced the olive oil with olive-oil flavored cooking spray and omitted the couscous. I substituted sweet onion for shallots because I did not have shallots on hand. The result was outstanding even in this lower calorie version.

I thought this was just ok. Finishing off the chicken by cooking it in the broth poached it which is one of my least favorite ways to cook chicken. Flavorful enough but to me it was too much work to produce just an ok dish. Served over orzo.
