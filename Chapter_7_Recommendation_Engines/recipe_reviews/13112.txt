Had some extra asparagus so I decided to try this soup and it turned out GREAT!  I used a whole stick of butter because I was too lazy to measure out 6 tablespoons. I cooked it on my gas stove over low heat so the onions wouldn't burn. I also mixed it with a hand blender rather than puree in a regular blender.  I love using my Braun hand blender.  Everyone liked it and it had great flavor.  I left out the soy sauce and used a little extra white pepper.  The tips were like little bonuses in the soup.  Highly recommend it!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  My adult son stopped by just as I was serving it up, and he too thought it was excellent.  I made a few minor changes as follows:  I used skim milk for the milk called for in the recipe. 1 medium onion, chopped (instead of 1-1/2 cups), 4 Tbs. butter (rather than 6) and I replaced the 2 cups of water with 1 can of chicken broth plus 2 oz. water.  Also, I only used 1 Tbs soy sauce.  As another  had suggested, I used my Braun hand blender directly in the pan which saved some time and clean-up.  I heated the skim milk in the microwave and found the recipe came together quicker than expected.  Thanks Holly for a an excellent recipe!

I used chicken broth instead of the water for more flavor. I also decreased the amount of milk so it would be slightly thicker.  A very fresh and flavorful soup. I will certainly make this recipe again!

Yum - this soup is good!  Following suggestions of previous reviewers I only used 2 cups of milk - which led to a thick and creamy soup.  I also used two chicken stock cubes.  This plus the soy sauce made the soup a little too salty so I will omit the salt at the beginning in future.  I had one bowl leftover and it tasted good cold, too.

This came out deelish!  I too, omitted the salt since there was soy sauce included and it was fine.  I added a touch more pepper as well.  I also didn't puree the veggies, just mashed them, preferring a more substantial soup.
One very good addition was using about 1/3 c. sour cream and mixing it in a small bowl with 1 cup of the hot soup mixture at the end of the cooking.  Be sure to mix it in verrrry slowly, or the sour cream will curdle.  Once it is thoroughly mixed together, add it to the soup pot - this will make for a very creamy soup!

I liked this soup better before adding the soy sauce.  Without the soy, it would have five  stars.  I also added less milk, because I like thick soups.  In fact I used half and half instead.  It makes it very creamy and so delicious.

This was a very good soup. I also put everything in one pot and used a hand blender to blend it all together.  I used chicken stock instead of water and heavy whipping cream instead of the milk.  I was hesitant about the soysauce but overall the soup was really good!!  Made 4 servings in my family. :)

Too many changes required to rate this any higher than three stars.  First, taking the cue from other reviewers, I reduced the amount of milk by about half.  Good call. Second, I reduced the amount of tamari (by necessity I used soy sauce) to only one-third the amount called for - again, good call.  Third, the soup calls for water and I'm not sure why - it contributes no flavor and only dilutes what flavor there is.  I used chicken broth instead.  Finally, I would have much preferred the soup pureed completely.  The chunky tips almost seemed as tho' they didn't belong and added a little bitterness as well.

When asparagus is in season, the first thing I do is make this soup.  My husband won't eat asparagus any other way.  We like it so well that I've passed it along to others several times.

I read the reviews before making and I too replaced the water with chicken stock and only used 1 1/2 cups of milk and just added directly to the blended soup. This soup was very good! I DO however think if you used the milk it calls for you'd be disappointed in the consistency and color but I cannot bring myself to give it anything less than a 5. It was very flavorful and filling. Top is with some croutons and parmesean for an added bonus.

This soup does take some effort to make, but it is well worth it. The texture
is perfect and the flavor really amazing!!!! Wow, what a great new twist to the typical cream of asparagus soup!

I was tempted to add some garlic (as we love garlic in our family) but decided to do the recipe exactly as written before changing things.  The soup flavor is so multi-layered yet  delicate I am actually glad I didn't add garlic as it may been a little over powering.  Some people reduced the liquid to make it thicker but if you do the steps with the flour and the cooking times (I may have done a little more time on the flour step) the soup is wonderfully thick, creamy and flavorful.  CostCo here has a ridiculously good deal on big bags of fresh asparagus.  Take advantage.  Fabulous recipe!  Thanks!

Divine!  I would definitely not use more than 2 cups of milk - and next time I may use 1 c. half and half, 1 c. milk.  My blender could not hold the both the asparagus mixture and the milk and so I had to just puree the mixture then put it back in the pot and whisk the milk into it.  This recipe made me want a hand held mixer!  I would love to make this for a dinner party, serving in martini glasses and garnishing with an entire stalk of asparagus.  I would also want to experiment using white asparagus.  The dill added a lovely, lovely flavor.

This vanished quickly last night and was loved by all. I only added 1T. of the soy sauce, as I was a little skeptical, but I now think that 2T. would be fine, too.  I used 1% milk to save calories, and it was nice and rich.

I used a soup pot for the entire process.  After cooking the onions and asparagus I used a wire wisk to mash and blend instead of a blender.  I then added the flour and then the chopped asparagus tops. I also used 1/2 pt. of heavy whipping cream instead of the milk and used more chicken stock.  I always look for ways to cut down on extra dishes and time.  This turned out fantastic.  I got rave reviews, even from my 2 grandsons who NEVER eat asparagus!

We had cream of asparagus soup at a restaurant once and loved it and I've always wanted to make it at home.  So when I had a bunch of asparagus that I had not used yet and didn't want to just steam it as usual, I found this recipe and I can not say enough how good it was.  I made a huge batch and my husband and I ate it three nights in a row.  Delicious!!  The only change I made was I did not use tamari because I didn't realize until the end that I didn't have any soy sauce so I just added extra salt and I did not feel that it made any difference in flavor, although I will try it with the soy sauce next time I make it just to see.

Very light and fresh tasting soup.  I had to use soy sauce since I wasn't able to find the tamari, and it was fine.  Next time I will add a bit more asparagus because I love it so much - but the recipe provided was fine.  Everyone was delighted by it and I've already been asked to make it again.

Awesome soup!!!!! The flavors in this soup are great.  I only used 3 cups of milk and did not heat it up.  I added 4 tbs. white wine, 1 tbs. lemon juice, 1/2 cup sour cream and kept tasting and heating it and adding salt until I was satisfied.  I used the whole asparagus.  After I blended it, I ran it thru a cone mill and that kept the stingy pieces out.  Very flavorful, creamy and excellent.  I think the dill definitely helps this soup give it another layer of flavor that is great.

This was such a hit even with the kids.  I used vegetable bullion with my water and used 3 cups of milk instead of four although it thicken real well at the end I might use a little more next time. I think this is because I do not have a double boiler.

Oh. My. God. The most creamy, flavorful, delicious soup I've had in a long, long time. Absolutely gorgeous, and so velvety and fragrant that my guests were crowding the kitchen waiting for it to be done. Definitely going into the "must have" recipe list. Edit: I used a bit less milk (about half), subbed chicken broth for the water, left out the tamari and liked it even better.

Not having tamari, I used 1 Tbsp soy sauce, otherwise cooked it exactly as posted.  It was wonderful, a delight to all the senses.  Afterward, though, my husband said, "Wouldn't it taste great with some clams thrown in."  Perhaps it was the second tablespoon of soy that left it wanting...

No worries; I'll be playing with this recipe again quite soon.

Suggested: combine butter, garlic and fresh basil then spread on a french roll.  Toast until edges are brown and serve promptly.

Didn't have any, but a nice Chianti would be perfect!

Great recipe. I didn't add the soy sauce, and I didn't measure the milk.  I just poured it in from the carton to get just the right consistency.

Very tasty and SUPER CREAMY! I used a vegetable stock cube with the water and cut down on the milk a bit to get a nice thick soup. We absolutely loved it. I can't wait to make this in the winter as rich and creamy comfort food.

Really excellent.  The soy sauce added dimension to the taste.  I used low-salt soy sauce to reduce sodium content. I reduced the amount of mild used to keep the soup thick. Everyone loved this soup, even my 91-year old father who doesn't like vegetables.

Very good.  Followed directions to a "T".  Kids did not like it but once again the green vegetable is an automatic dislike.  Oh well, more for my husband and I.  Thanks

Very nice. I used half water/half vegetable stock, and soy rather than milk. Very tasty. Good recipe!

This recipe was amazing - I made it for Mother's Day and everyone loved it; even my sister who doesn't normally like asparagus.  I used 3 cups of milk instead of four and the soup came out perfectly creamy.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used 4-5 tablespoons of Earth Balance buttery spread and 1-2 tablespoons of Lemon-flavored olive oil to sauté the asparagus and onions. Definitely, DO NOT use water, use chicken broth (I used Better Than Bouillon Low Sodium Chicken). Add the broth VERY slowly, or the soup won't thicken right. Even after that, I still only used 2 cups of milk. The soup I ended up with was delicious!

Delicious! This soup was so easy to make. I really loved the dill with the asparagus. I didn't have "tamari" so that's the only change I made.

I just made this soup and it was amazing.  I added chicken boullion to the water as someone else suggested and didn't add the tamari, because I didn't have it, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  My Dad hates asparagus, but I took leftovers to my parents and made him try it and he loved it.  I will making a double batch next time so I have more leftovers.  It re-heats very well and I can't wait to make this again. Yum!

This soup is SO good. I did not have dill weed or white pepper (used black instead) but it was still delicious without them. It's really good with a squeeze of lemon juice right before serving.

I made this last night and it is the best!  I followed others' advice and cut the milk down to 2 cups, and skipped the tamari.  I also added a bit more of the white ground pepper for flavor.  I'll be making it again soon!

Great Soup! Would certainly make it again. Left the tamari out ... it was salty enough without it. Might try some grated cheese as a garnish next time.

This is very tasty.  I added about 3-4 tbsp. of white cooking wine to enhance the soup's flavor, and since I didn't have white pepper on hand, I used the standard black pepper.  I also used approx. 1/4 cup of half-n-half (in lieu of some of the milk) to give it a rich texture.  The end result was fabulous.  Hubby and even my baby daughter (she had about 2 spoonfuls) really enjoyed it!

Lovely!  I had some asparagus left that wasn't going to get cooked (bought too much at GREAT sale price!)  This was delicate - I had no tamari, so used a little Worcestershire to add depth instead.  Everyone enjoyed it ... easy ... great idea for jazzing up a meal with a special opening.  Will 
DEFINITELY make again!

Sorry, folks.  I usually rate recipes and make them as written.  But because I made changes, I'm leaving comments so that I can remember how I made this so that I can make it again! I used chicken broth in place of water, sautéed onion , 2 cloves chopped garlic, asparagus on the stove top.  I used less salt, 1 Tbs lite soy sauce, and no dill.  Instead of 4 c milk: 2 c milk, 1 c half and half, 1 c heavy cream.  I blended with an immersion blender.  All of these because I had this on hand.  It was delicious!!!

Not sure why so many people were complaining about the soup turning out too liquid; mine turned out thick (perhaps lack of cooking time at different steps?). I replaced the water with vegetable broth and only used 1 tbsp of tamarin. Both my bf and I liked it.

Probably not fair to rate because I didnt follow all directions.  I was out of onion so I subbed one celery rib and a large clove of garlic for the onion.  Left the lemon out....Quite nice that way.

great flavor if you love asparagus! after adding 2 cups of vegetable broth, the consistency was perfect for us, so I didn't add the milk.  Next time, I'll probably use less butter, since this way makes fewer servings.

Found some asparagus in the frig that I forgot about for a week and wanted to use it asap.  This recipe was wonderful and easy.  I tweaked it a little because I like garlic.  I used 2 cloves chopped and cooked it with the asparagus and onions.  I was very skeptical about the tamari (soy sauce), but it gave the soup just the right added flavor.  Don't be afraid to use the full 2 Tbsp. An added note:  the flavor improves greatly with a longer simmer, like an additional 30-40 minutes after all the ingredients have been included.  Just be sure it's simmering low. This is a rich enough soup that we had it with our favorite bread and called it a meal.  It was delicious.

This was just OK.  It wasn't quite thick enough for our taste.  We made one batch and it made quite a lot.  We ate it for dinner twice and still had left overs because it's just the two of us.

This is the 2nd time I have used this recipe. It is also good with broccoli. I didn't have tamari so I left it out. Also, I fried up a handful of bacon and added it.

So yummy! I didn't use dill as I didn't have any and I'm not a fan of a lot of salt so I skipped the soy sauce, too. We are allergic to milk so I used two cups of heated MimicCreme (a heavy cream substitute). I also added chicken bouillon to the water. I made a lot of changes I suppose but it's delicious! I'm eating it on the backporch during a thunder/lightning storm. What a perfect summer dish!

Excellent soup!  Best I've ever made!  I vegan-ized it by substituting vegan butter and unsweetened soy milk.  So tasty!  I added some extra dill and black pepper instead of white.  Also I skipped the Tamari.  Wow I really modified it a lot, but the result was so tasty that it's worth mentioning!

I love asparagus soup, but I thought it was something I could only eat at fancy restaurants!  Now I can make it and freeze it and have it whenever I want!

I had some asparagus that had partially frozen in my fridge.  I almost threw it out, but decided to try this recipe instead.  My hubby & kids don't like asparagus, but they tasted the soup & said it was really good.  That's a glowing review for them!  I followed others suggestions, used stock instead of water, used only 2 cups of milk (which I forgot to warm, but it worked fine) and only added 1 Tbsp. of soy sauce.  Turned out great!  Served with sourdough grilled cheese & turkey sandwiches and everyone loved it!

I thought this was VERY good!  I accidentally pureed the tips of the asparagus, but other than that, definitely a keeper!  Great with some freshly shredded fontinella cheese and croutons on top - mmmmm!

Great potential - way too much liquid as written. I cut my milk back to 1 1/2 cups, to keep a good texture on my soup. I definitely think 4 cups would kill the consistency, color and flavor of the asparagus. I love the recipe otherwise, so it's hard to give a less than glowing review, but I don't think this will come out all that great if you make it as written. Seasoned as written - love the dill in this. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe!  I made this soup-for-two, so I halfed the recipe. I used half cream and half milk, instead of all milk. I also added about 1 tsp. of sugar.  Delicious!!! Thanks.

I made this soup for my hubby's lunch this week. He just emailed me: "Oh my gosh, that soup was fabulous Honey." I've been making his lunch for a long time now and I've never heard that kind of praise before! I used whole wheat flour and 1% milk based on my hubby's request to "make it healthy". And I cut the soy sauce in half (and used low sodium) based on the other reviews. Turned out perfect.

Made this last night--very good! Put in 2/3s the milk and used chicken stock instead of water and left out the tamari... yum! Ate it with ciabatta bread. I bet a little parmesan on top would have been good--isn't it always?

As per previously recommended, I decreased the milk to 2 cups and did not use the tamari. The soup tasted great and was a nice consistency. My husband is not a big soup person but he went back for seconds on this one! Thanks!

I skipped the tamari based on other reviews.  Also, only added 2 cups milk as I wouldn't want it any thinner.  It was very good served with some homemade bread.  My only objection was that I would have wished that it had made a larger quantity!

Very tasty.  I was afraid to add in the tamari, but did add some celery.
