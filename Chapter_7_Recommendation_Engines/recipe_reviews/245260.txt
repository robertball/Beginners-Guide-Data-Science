I always want to use exact recipe ingredients when making for the first time....but only had breakfast sausage.  It was still great. 

Anytime I can contribute to household responsibilities is great.  Right honey?

Thanks for the inspiration.

We really enjoyed this breakfast. I used chicken sausage instead of bacon. I also added bell peppers. I will make this again. Yummy!

I only had one change. I did not have pita so I used NAAN flatbread. We liked it  so much we are planning on making this for Christmas Breakfast. I am going to try the Pita but the NAAN was good as well.

Excellent  idea for a Sunday morning breakfast. I had all the ingredients on hand, but used ham chopped up instead of bacon.  Feeling healthy!

I didn't have spinach, so left that out. I also didn't add the mushrooms.

I made this recipe for my annual gathering of girlfriends and everyone loved it. I do not care for fennel so I make my own sausage meat, which is the only change I made. For my keto friends, instead of the pita I made sausage patties and they loved them! Everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks!

Really enjoyed the breakfast pita pizza, easy to put together and loaded it with lots of veggies. We will definitely be having again.

I thought this was great.  I suppose I tweaked it, but I don't think so.  I don't care for crispy bacon, so didn't cook it so much.  I also fried the mushrooms a bit after the onions, and I didn't put any spinach on it.  I also used a tomato sauce instead of pesto.

This was an excellent dish. Also substituted naan for the pita, and it turned out great. It has a wonderful mix of spices, and to provide you something different to have for breakfast. I made it a couple months ago, and I'm going to make it tomorrow.

So good! I asked my husband to make this for me for Mother's Day (it was my birthday too) and we all loved it. It was a lot of effort, but worth it!  I'm making it for him on Father's Day.
