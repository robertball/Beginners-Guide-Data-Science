This was fabulous !!!I sauteed 2 boneless chicken breasts ,(flattened with a mallet),and then put about 1/2 cup of sauce in the bottom of a baking dish then put the chicken on top and then the rest of the sauce.Cooked about 25 min. in oven at 375*Served with linguine and lots of parmesan. My husband is a retired chef, he said keep this recipe where you can find it to cook again.

Excellent!  Very spicy with that much red pepper flakes - weaklings might want to cut it in half.  I used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes and was able to omit the olive oil from the recipe and it worked great!

This was a great recipe -- very tasty.  I doubled the recipe and it was barely enough for 4 people, even if you are not trying to smother the pasta.  I would recommend quadrupling it if you are planning for 6-8 people and/or leftovers.  Also, start light on the oil and then add more if needed; mine turned out a little oily.  Also, if you don't like really salty dishes, I would start light with the olives, and then add for flavor as needed.  I put fewer in than the recipe noted, but didn't taste it until I had too many and was a bit too salty.  Finally, I had never cooked with crushed pepper, and a little goes a LONG way.  If you are feeding this to kids, definitely hold the crushed pepper.  Also, sprinkle a little, then taste -- and repeat if necessary, otherwise, you will be surprised!  Overall -- great recipe with very fresh ingredients. :)

It's truly delicious! I added a jar of roasted red bell peppers and some extra capers.. The pecorino cheese is the best choice. Using whole wheat penne pasta is a great choice for this hearty sauce

One word...Fantastic!!! Tried this tonite and luckily had everything in the pantry and fridge but vine-ripened tomatoes.  Sorry, Giuseppe, but I used a good brand of canned diced tomatoes and the sauce turned out beautifully!  Will try it with fresh tomatoes as soon as we get some this season in our area (southern Ohio valley).  This recipe is restaurant quality and one of the very best pasta sauces I have ever tried!  Had the peccorino romano cheese on hand and it definitely finished the sauce.  I sauteed some chicken tenders in extra-virgin olive oil and added them last minute to the sauce; over linguine al dente it was heavenly!  Thanks for a keeper~

Delicious!  Doubled the recipe and tossed it with linguine.  After plating, I topped each serving with a grilled tuna steak and a good dusting of pecarino romano cheese as suggested (don't use the domestic parmesan).  PERFECT combination of flavors and hubby thought it was a gourmet Italian meal.

We had to make this sauce after reading and watching the "Series of Unfortunate Events."  This was a great recipe, very quick and easy.  My kids and everyone loved it, and it was extra fun for the kids after hearing about it in the book.  I did add one can of tomato sauce just to give it a litte more body (and hide the fresh tomatos from my older daughter who only eats tomato sauce and not tomatos).  I also added only a small pinch of ground red pepper...just enough zing without burning little palets. It was great!

This was too hot.  I think I am pretty tolerant of spicy foods but this was just too dog-goned hot! I would cut the pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. & then it might be good.

Absolutely delicious! I added extra olives and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and it was well worth it.  Great with grilled meats and truly superb on thin rounds of toasted baguette as an appetizer.

Great recipe with a few subtle changes, for the sundried tomatoes I add just enough water to cover and reduce until dry which plumps them up a bit, then pulse them in the food processor quickly. I also like a little more caper flavor so I add the capers to the garlic, onions, and oil and sautee for a minute as I feel this brings more flavor out of them. Canned tomatoes are fine just squeeze them to crush into the sauce to keep texture. I've made the recipe with fresh and canned tomatoes and there was no noticeable difference. Also be sure to add red pepper flakes to taste, as it can get overpowering if you use too much. A little fish sauce really wakes the dish up. Throw a little sauce in the pan add some cooked penne pasta, toss with some fresh grated cheese and chopped Italian parsley and you have a 5 star recipe.

I enjoyed this very, very much.  I doubled the recipe and left out the capers (none on hand).  Took some time to pit the olives but it was worth it.

This was a quick/easy sauce to make up! I added abit of red wine into the sauce/along with a few heaping spoonfuls of chopped canned tomatoes/abit of basil/fennel and it was AMAZING! I did add abit more crushed red pepper then asked for, as I like abit of heat. This is something I could easily make up on my sailboat for a quick meal - and not just at home!

I'm in the minority here as we found this to be inedible.  Left a bad aftertaste in the mouth.  I had such high hopes as I love all of the ingredients in this recipe.  Thank you for letting me try!

This is the best pasta sauce I have ever made-thanks much for the recipe.  I made it as directed only without the capers (didn't have any) but still is excellent.  Next time I'll use the capers - I just can't imagine how to improve it- you gotta try it.  Thanks again.

I would rate this 5 stars except it was a bit too spicy for me. Next time I will halve the amount of crushed red pepper. My nose and eyes were running! I felt bad feeding this to my mother who has trouble with spicy foods. But the flavor was great and the ingredients are all on hand so I will try again. It didn't look like this would be enough for 4, but it really was. Alongside I cooked an entire box of whole wheat penne (also for 4) and the amounts were perfect.

This was FABULOUS!  I didn't have any capers- so I didn't add them- but it was AWESOME anyway!  I served this as a 'relish' / topping over grilled salmon.  Mondo beyondo good!!!!  I can't wait to try it over pasta or chicken!  Yum!!

Very good.  The whole family liked this.  Omitted the olives as I didn't have olives and my hubby doesn't like them.  Added a splash of red wine vinegar.

For those of you who think that this recipe is missing something, try anchovy paste, all puttanesca I've had has anchovies in it.  FYI: if you don't think you like anchovies (like I use to think)...your probably wrong, the paste will add an extra kick and doesn't taste fishy at all.

This is excellent even for my Vegan son Jeremy.  I always recommend fresh herbs{so easy to grow, more flavorfull}.  Even better one day later , found it in the fridge at 10 P.M. after my job as a cook and could not stop myself from eating all the leftovers.

Best Puttanesca I've ever had.  I added a few more Kalamata olives and capers as well as used jarred hot crushed red peppers (1.5 tbs) with seeds.  Definitely a keeper.

I had some sun dried tomatoes I didn't know what to do with and then I found this absolutely delicious recipe. I didn't use kalamata olives and fresh tomatoes since I didn't have them. I put regular olives and some pelati tomatoes instead. My husband who's Italian loves it. So thamk you for sharing this recipe!

I've served this recipe twice, first with grilled chicken and next with shrimp.  It is excellent and my guests raved about it (so I didn't tell them how easy it was to make).  It's definitely a 5 star recipe and a keeper.

Wow.  This was delightful!  A little spicy for my little one, but my husband and I loved it.  I added some freshly grated parmesan cheese on top and served it over penne pasta.  This recipe has replaced my old puttanesca sauce recipe.

Very quick to make after a long day at work and very very tasty! My next guests will be eating it!  Quantity in recipe was just enough for 2 people though.

I just tried this and it was fantastic.
My husband loved it as did I and the only thing I did differently was add 1 tbspn. of red pepper instead of 1 tspn. because we like hot foods.  I'll make this over and over.

This was so good!!  I cut the red pepper back to 1/4 tsp. and the end result was perfect.  This will be showing up regularly on my dinner table.

An excellent recipe.  Very full of flavour and spicier than you might expect.  Perfect for an adult crowd but not recommended for children.

Tart and salty.  Very good for a flavourful, healthy meal.  I served it with whole wheat pasta and thought thought the ingredients was very restaurant-like.

this is by far the best puttanesca sauce ever! used canned diced tomatoes and sometimes add green olives as well. I've also added peppers and mushrooms for a different take. You can make it hotter or less with the chiles, very adaptable to all tastes.

This was excellent and very quick and easy to make.  I cut down the crushed red pepper to about 1/4 tsp as I didn't think my three kids would eat it if I didn't.  The kids loved it.  I also left out the olives as I am not a big olive fan.  I served this over penne pasta.  I will definitely make this again with the changes I made

This was so good!  I'm living in Naples, Italy at the moment and this is just like the pasta puttanesca I had at a local restaraunt!

Thought this was a nice chage of pace, and will probably make again, but not going into the regular rotation.

YUMMY! This is a classic that could be put on so many different dishes! I put it on tofu and on pasta. Added half  red pepper, and will do 1/3 less capers next time.

Yum! I added cut-up pan cooked chicken, sliced mushrooms (added just after the garlic), omitted the onion, used green and black olives instead of kalamata, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, and served it over linguini. It's delicious! Next time I will cut up the sun-dried tomatoes way smaller though.

This is one of the best puttanesca sauces I’ve ever had. In order to make enough sauce for my purposes, I used  16 Cento tomatoes canned and seasoned sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil. I added one extra clove of garlic. Since I increase the volume I used exactly the same amount of red pepper flakes so it was flavored but not oppressively hot. Easy, delicious, and a flexible recipe that you can add other meats on the side or vegetables. I put it over rice cauliflower and plan to use an over a lemon basil noodle.

Wow, was this good. 
I used a little more of the olives, sundried tomatoes and used a little Parmesan with spaghetti noodles. 
When I first tasted the sauce, I thought it would be just a little too hot, but it was perfect. 
Everyone loved it and there were no left overs.

I quadrupled the recipe and used about 1.5 gal of whole frozen garden tomatoes that I skinned and chopped. I didn't have sun-dried toms, so I boiled down about 1/4 of the tomatoes into a thick sauce that I added back to the main dish.  I also added a Tbs of brown sugar at the end.  YUMMY, Five stars!

It was good, but nothing mind-blowing.  I'd experiment with a similar sundried tomato-kalamata recipe next time...
