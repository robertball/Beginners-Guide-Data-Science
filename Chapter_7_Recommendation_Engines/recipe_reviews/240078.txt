I was hoping these would turn out great as I liked the concept of adding the pumpkin puree and using a small amount of sugar. My only change was making muffins instead of a square loaf. The issue with the recipe was without any baking powder the recipe just came out really dense. The whipped egg whites were not enough to cause levening. The flavor was okay and they werent over sweet which I did like. The pumpkin flavor is not real strong but I did not expect it to be. I hope someone tries the recipe with some baking powder to see if it fixes that issue. I got 12 corn muffin/cakes.

As is this cornbread has a good taste. It is dense but fresh tasting. I used raw pumpkin not canned. The second time I made it (the one in my picture) I used self-rising cornmeal (baking powder and super fine cornmeal) and it was still good tasting but very dry. The batter was so thick in fact I ended up adding some more milk and another egg to be able to mix it together because it was like a paste. I made one 8" round pan and then made a couple of muffins. In the muffins I added a sliced fresh jalapeno and that was very good. I will use this recipe again but will definitely add baking powder and adjust the liquid. Thanks for the recipe.
