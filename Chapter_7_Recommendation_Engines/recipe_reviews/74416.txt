I lived in Barcelona for many years and I love ensaimadas.  This recipe makes some nice little breakfast rolls, but not the flaky, dough-y pastries covered with powdered sugar that I miss.

To me it was average, but would need a little work on it next time I make this. I didn't really get the rise that I wanted for it to be fluffy, instead, it was a bit dense but soft. I couldn't get 15 pieces from the flour amount listed. I got at least 10 small ones. Also, I did put more work to this in forming a traditional dough to get that swirl pattern when you bite to it: roll out the individual doughball until you get a thin dough circle, brush it with shortening or softened butter, roll it up into a swiss roll, let it rest/rise for awhile, then gently form a loose coil.

Maybe try using bakery fresh yeast instead of dry active yeast. Perhaps this makes a difference.
