We have been making these forever! My mom mad ethem when we were growing up! You don't need to preboil the hot dogs! Slice the dogs as stated or you can also use sausage dogs and put them under the broiler on a baking sheet - browning both sides. Then put the flat side down. We add a good squeeze of mustard before putting the potatoes on. I grate 1-2 cups of cheddar cheese into the mashed potatoes (opt.) when I am mashing them and then cover the dogs with a long scoop of the potatoes and place a slice of cheddar cheese on top and put them back under the broiler until the cheese melts. No need for boiling the dogs or transferring anything to the casserole dish. casserole dish!

I love hot dogs and plan on trying this soon.. but it can't become a vegetarian meal if it contains meat.

Pretty good. Different way to cook hot dogs. An easy quick meal. Will make again but will try instant potatoes for a quick week night meal. Update - tried with instant and worked great. My 15 month old loved it!

How can you not love hot dogs topped with potatoes and cheese? My mom used to add some minced onion to the potatoes but I prefer to add chives. The oniony flavor goes really well. I agree with a previous person that said you don't have to pre-boil the hot dogs. Great busy weeknight meal just add a green veg or salad!

What a simple yet excellent meal! I used Costco Polish Beef Hot Dogs and split them down the middle and cooked them at 375 while the potatoes were boiling. I used cheddar cheese instead of American In the taters. While stuffing the "boats" I cranked the heat up to broil, then popped them in for 5 minutes and served with corn!! Such a family hit!!!

I've made these for years however what I do is: Use thick BBQ style all-beef hotdogs uncooked then place cheese strips inside the slit top with mashed potatoes & press it in/on firmly. Finally I take a lean bacon strip (I trim off any outer fat) wrap it around spiral fashion securing it at each end with toothpicks. Then bake them on a rack until bacon is crispy and serve with a green salad. The whole family says "Yummm-O". Gave this 4 stars for the concept as it wouldn't let me post my comment without a rating; adding the bacon would get it 5 stars.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend for a late night after work snack. he ate 5 of them and really enjoyed them. he drizzled ketchup and mustard on them. it was easy to broil hot dogs in the oven and make instant mashed potatoes. the cheese pulls it all together. definitely an appetizer meal to bring to parties.

It came out great. I added some sauted onions and used shredded cheese. The missing star reflects the fat content but it could be modified.

My grandmother, mother and myself have been making these since 1950 when my grandmother found this recipe in the 1950 Betty Crocker cookbook offered as an exact replica still today.  We are more generous with the potatoes and top with paprika

My mom used to make this for us all the time. She used instant mashed potatoes instead and we make them with sausage instead of hot dogs. So good!:)

Omg My mom made these back in the 70s! We called them Glorified Hot Dogs. I use garlic mashed potatoes and real cheese. Easy peasy.

Instant mashed potatoes also work. I saute chopped onions and mixed them into the mashed potatoes. I also added prepared mustard (to taste) to the mashed potatoes. Then stuffed the boiled hot dogs and added cheese and then broiled them. Tasted great and easy to prepare in 1/2 the time.
