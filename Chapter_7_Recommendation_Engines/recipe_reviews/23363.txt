These are yummy! I only had 1 cup of pumpkin left (needed to use it up), so I used 1 cup of crushed pineapple with it. Still can't taste the pineapple that much, but they're nice and moist. Also, since the pineapple is juicier than pumpkin, I added 1/4 cup of flour. I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 of white, and since I don't like nuts in my cookies, I just left 'em out! I would add a bit more spice to them too. Love 'em though, and I will make them again! I love baking in the fall :)

A mounded cookie, doesn't spread much: soft, tasty and moist.  Getting everything out and measured took longer than mixing and cooking.

This was a good cookie, even though I made a few changes. I will keep this recipe! I used apples instead of pineapple only because it's apple time of year. I will used pineapple next time. I used 1/2 white & 1/2 wheat flour also. I'm into using pumpkin right now & this is a good cookie!

Good basic recipe BUT ...spices should be doubled; I'd add lots more cinnamon, allspice.
I frosted some and filled some with lemon frosting to "kick it up" a bit.

These were almost too moist - even after I increased the bake time to 15 minutes.  I liked the flavor but no one else in my house liked them.

Very yummy, soft and chewy with great pumpkin flavour. I don't notice the pineapple taste at all so I would consider leavig it out next time to make the cookie a little crispier.
