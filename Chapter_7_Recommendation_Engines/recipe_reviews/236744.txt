I was also wowed by this recipe. How can you go wrong with these ingredients. I took the submitter's suggestion and used garlic salt. This will go into my regular rotation. Thank you Shisafest.

Made this without the mayo and substituted with medium heat green taco sauce.  It was really delicious and easy to make.

This recipe was great! However, instead of regular mayo, I made my own cilantro lime mayo! Added a fresh element to the dish! Also would recommend using fresh mango. Will have to try that next time! Definitely a dish Iâ€™ll be making in the future! Cheers!

These sound really good.  I think a layer refried beans would add a lot to this recipe.

This was a very tasty and different tostada. We both enjoyed it very much. I used frozen raw shrimp and cooked them myself because we like the way I cook shrimp better. However, I should have used smaller shrimp or cut the ones I had in half. Other than that , it was pretty great.

This is a delicious, light meal.  It was so good I was making grunting sounds!!  I did however, make a few changes.  I didn't have any tostadas (not easily found) so I used low salt taco chips instead.  I added just a bit of taco seasoning just to give it a little 'zip'.  I also put some of my homemade salsa on top.  Delicious!!!!!
