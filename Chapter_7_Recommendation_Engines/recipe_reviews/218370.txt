I loved this recipe, but I loosely followed itâ€¦still trying to be true to it and do it justice...I grilled the marinated eggplant slices instead of frying them, and used fresh mozzarella cheese, the tomato and basil was from my own garden, and then broiled them in the oven on top of crostini slices until the cheese was bubbly.  For the olive oil basil drizzle, I omitted the anchovies, and instead used a tsp. of olive oil infused with white truffles, white balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic!  Out of this world!

Delicious Summer side dish!  Because my oven isn't working I wasn't able to bake it, but I served everything room temperature and it was great.  Instead of just flouring the eggplant, I dipped it in egg and then bread crumbs before frying.  I layered up the ingredients into a stack and dressed it at the last minute with the vinaigrette.  Delish!

I have tried this recipe. Instead of frying the egg plant I roasted it with brushing some olive oil & sprinkling some kosher salt to make it light. My husband is on a low fat diet. I tried with cartage cheese. Came out delicious. Specially to serve cold.

This recipe would probably come out a lot better with a few alterations. By just coating the eggplant in flour and trying to fry them I ended up with a soggy oily mess. I recommend coating in egg and bread crumbs, spritz with oil, and bake the rounds instead. This is what I usually do with eggplant and should have done it this time. Also, the olive oil/anchovy sauce would probably be better with a bit less olive oil. My whole dish just turned out to be too oily and looked nothing like the pictures loaded here.

I once tried this dish at my daugther's god parents house. It was amazing but very rich and filling. My hubby really loved it. So its great that i can now try it out myself! Although she did not use anchovy.

delicious side dish. made this once basically as the recipe suggests. making it again with a few minor changes. 
1) salt the eggplant slices and let the sit for ~half hour to draw out the bitter juices. This will prevent that odd eggplant flavour as well as allow the slices to fry up crispier. 
2) skip the sauce at the end. instead, toss a whole clove of garlic into the oil as you fry the eggplant to get the garlic flavour and add one leaf of fresh basil per stack.

to make it easier to eat, I suggest peeling the eggplant, even just in strips so that its easier to cut.

Tasted great.  I roasted the eggplant slices instead of frying.
