This is a thanksgiving tradition now.  I am known for my sausage and green bean casserole during the holidays!  Thanks for this recipe, I changed it only by adding one more can of green beans.  I have also halved this recipe for a side for dinner.

This was delicious but still quite salty, even the way that I made it.  In lieu of 3 of the ingredients, I subbed Wampler's bulk turkey sausage, Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup, and light soy sauce.  I did use regular French's French fried onions, though.  For these 4 ingredients the sodium content per portion is 886 mg. (a bit less).  I doubled the garlic, added a few drops of red hot pepper sauce and used French cut green beans.  I would make 2 more changes next time: sub unsalted chopped nuts for the fatty fried onions (it needs some crunch), and also add some sliced fresh mushrooms.  Then it would be a 5 star recipe!!  Do try this--it is GOOD.

I accendentally picked up the wrong condensed soups at the store, so I made this with one can of condensed cream of celery and one of condensed cream of chicken.  I added in some sliced mushrooms to make up for that fact.  It was incredible, though.  VERY hearty and relatively healthy.

I tried this for Christmas dinner as a twist on the original. My meat-loving dad thought it was great, but I think most of us preferred the meatless original. I added pimentos to give it some Christmas color. We all liked the onions layered inside as well as on top. It's a great change of pace, especially for sausage and meat lovers.

I prepared this dish the night before a work function, then had a few friends over. At 2 am they raided the fridge and were eating it cold, raving about how delicious it was. The recipe is so easy that I whipped up another one right away and the people at work enjoyed it as well. My friends asked me to make another one at the next gathering I had.

Served this at a Christmas dinner for 23 people. It was declared a winner by everyone.The sausage brought looks of surprise by many, but all thought it added to the flavor. I used canned beans and added an extra can. I ,also, added slivered almonds to the beans for some extra crunch.

I did not like this at all.  I did not use any salt but thoought it too salty.  Some of my guests liked it  but I would not make it again.  It was easy to make.  That is the only good thing I can say about it.

This is just delish. Thanks, Leepergal~  During the holiday meals, green bean and broccolli casseroles have been outlawed by our family - they're so overdone. However, we make up for it with suppers between the same old expected holidays meals. This dish is always on the table now. We'eve even stirred in big chunks of leftover roasted turkey and substituted maple syrup & green onions for the soy sauce, but we always stir in a handful of the french-fried onion rings in with the beans as well as baking them on top. Great recipe.

This has great variation possibilities.  Sausage could be replaced with cooked chicken.  I served mine with cornbread muffins.

A great twist on a traditional recipe. This recipe is now a requested dish during family events. I also added water chestnuts to the dish to give it some crunch! Myself and all others who have tried it, agree that the water chestnuts were a good addition. Give it a shot!

By the way, you can make this with lower fat by substituting low fat sausage (Wampler's makes a good one) and low fat cream of mushroom soup!

absolutely loved this!!!! finally my green bean casserole has search has come to an end... ALTHOUGH I didn't have french fried onions... I thought I did but when I reached in the cupboard for the container... IT ended up being Lo Mein Noodles!!! ITS OKAY!!!! It still turned out great! Maybe the soy sauce was the secret ingredient here.... I cut the recipe in half because its only me and my boyfriend at home... Not enough freezer space to freeze half of it... It was really simple to do.  Also for my pork sausage I had Jimmy Dean breakfast patties in the freezer.. at first I just thawed 6 of them... but decided to use all 8... So i had a little more sausage than the recipe called for. Still happy.

This was very tasty and a nice change to the traditional casserole.  I did leave out the soy sauce based on the reviews of the salty taste.  I used 3 cans of green beans, extra fried onions and added sliced almonds.  I took it to a church dinner and had no leftovers.

I used fresh green beans which gave it a nice crunchy texture. I found it too salty and will probably leave out the middle layer of french fried onions the next time around.

It was ok, I agree that it needs something then other what is listed.  If I try it again I'm going to add mushrooms and use can beans.  The frozen ones just didn't work for us.

I think I liked this version better than traditional green bean casserole, but I'm giving it four stars because some of my other tasters really preferred no meat in their veggie side dish.  I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom and canned green beans for the frozen.

I just tried this recipe for the first time this past Thanksgiving and it was fabulous!  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe as listed with only one variation:  I used french-style cut green beans which are a bit finer when served.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper for me and my family and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking to try a hearty and delicious green bean casserole.

I tried this because I have had it with the traditional green bean casserole.  This was a nice alternative. I used reduced sodium cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. My grandfather couldn't say enough about this.

I used half the sausage, but added a 10 oz package of sliced mushrooms and about 3/4 of a small box of frozen spinach that was defrosted & squeezed out.  Lots of compliments at Thanksgiving!

This came out great.  The hit of the evening.  We used apple-pork sausage which was delicious.  We don't really like onions so we substituted crutons which worked very well.  Next time I think we're going to saute some mushrooms in with the sausage to add a little extra, but this was great.

Great recipe, but needs more green beans. I halved the recipe and it was a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving meal. Tastes more like sausage gravy than healthy green beans. Will try again.

I hadn't made a green bean casserole in years. Made this one yesterday for Thanksgiving as written and it turned out good. I really liked the addition of sausage.
