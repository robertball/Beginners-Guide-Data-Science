Coconut pie is my husbands favorite and I have used many different recipes over the years and have learned a few tips over the years that help cut down on the amount of time you spend standing over the stove.  When I make any custard style pie, I use a stainless steel mixing bowl that will serve as a double boiler, that will fit over a large saucepan, like an 8 quart pan.  Use just enough water so the the bottom of the mixing bowl is not touching the water. Bring water to a boil.  Using a microwave safe 1 qt measuring cup, heat milk until scaled (tiny bubbles around rim of cup). Be careful not to let milk boil.  Add sugar, flour and salt to the stainless steel mixing bowl stir to combine, set bowl over boiling water, add the hot milk and stir with a whisk until smooth.  It only takes a few minutes for the mixture to thicken and then you can follow the remainging part of the recipe.
You must be careful as the hot steam will escape for the sides of the bowl and you can get burnt if you are not careful. Use a pot holder or dish towel to hold on the mixing bowl while you stir it.  Since using this method, I've never burnt or scorched any filling that I was making and cooking time has been cut in half.

Coconut cream pie is by father's favorite pie and this is the second time I have used this recipe.  I selected this recipe because it makes a bigger pie and I like to use a deeper pie plate.  My family (& especially my dad!) just love it.  I used whole milk and the filling is so creamy - really delish!  I increased the coconut to one & a half cups and felt it had plenty of coconut taste.  I used the 4 egg whites to make a meringue topping, sprinkled coconut over the top and browned it in the oven.  It looked great and tasted better.  Thanks Mary!

A fantastic coconut cream pie.  I made my crust with 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup white sugar and 6 tbsp melted butter, mixed and pressed into a pie plate and baked @375 for 7 min. 
Keep stirring the mixture while it's on the stove or dark-brown blobs will end up in the pie and you'll have a very messy pot to clean.

It was very good, but it did not really have a coconut taste... I made 1 change: instead of using 3 cups of milk, I only used 2 cups + 1 cup coconut milk. If you don't expect a strong coconut taste, it is a very good pie. Be sure to use a non stick pan. I used stainless steel and the sugar burnt at the bottom, giving the pie a slight burned taste. That wasn't the recipe's fault though. Thanks for sharing!

I took previous posters advice and used 1/3 cup cornstarch in place of flour, used 1 1/2 cup milk and same of coconut milk, added 1 tsp of coconut extract and toasted the coconut. I also didn't have much time for the pie shell so I just crushed graham crackers and added some melted butter and sugar pressed into a pie pan. This coconut cream pie was raved about and didn't last past Thanksgiving.

Coconut Cream pie has always been my favorite, and this recipe was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I am not the greatest cook, and I managed to bust the crust and cooked the wrong part of the egg (ha ha) before re-reading the recipe, but the filling ended up tasting incredible, despite the chef!  :O)  I also fixed some whipping cream with 4 tablespoons of white granulated sugar for topping.  I know that I am probably the ONLY person dumb enough to add the whipped topping right away (before the pie cools, in which case it melts into a cream), but just in case I'm not, a word to the wise:  WAIT UNTIL THE PIE COOLS before you add the whipped cream topping.  My pie wasn't really very attractive looking, but TALK ABOUT TASTY!!!!  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves coconut cream pies.  Now I have to go make my "common sense" notes so that I don't rough up the crust or mess up the eggs again next time I try this recipe.  It usually takes me two tries on a new recipe anyway. I guess we'll have to eat the practice pie tonight and try again tomorrow! OH DARN!! HA HA

I like a recipe that works the FIRST time. I made this pie exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out perfectly. It easily filled my pie crust to the brim, set up beautifuly and tasted great. I topped it off with my own recipe for cream: 1 cup of cold heavy cream, 3 Tbs of powdered sugar, 1 large marshmallow melted and mixed in. I garnished with toasted coconut. Even the first slice looked gorgeous when I served it. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Oh my!  I had never made a coconut cream pie before, and this one was definitely a success.  I made it with two cups skim milk and one cup cream and it was incredibly rich.  You could only eat a small sliver.  Next time I will use only milk and I think it will be plenty rich and creamy, and lower fat.  My recommendation is to make this the night before.  Because the coconut is not cooked with the custard, the custard does not have a coconut flavor right away.  While it sits overnight the coconut has a chance to re-constitute, plumping it up and infusing the pie with coconut flavor.  I topped it with whipped cream and toasted coconut.

What a great pie!!  I admit I haven't had a slice of it yet (it's still cooling), but man the filling is wonderful!  I topped it with some toasted coconut, too.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is use a deep dish crust.  I had a fair amount of filling left but, needless-to-say, it's already been eaten.  My mom is a coconut freak & she already gave it a thumbs-up.

I liked making this recipe for the first time  with real coconut that I managed to crack open and use for the topping as well.  The only thing I would change is the flour to 3 tablespoons along with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to make the filliing thicker for a denser texture that will hold up to the whipped cream that I put on top

This was my first attempt at a cream pie. I found the recipe easy to follow and my first cream pie was a roaring success. I did make one change. I used Splenda, instead of sugar and it was still great. Will definitly make this one again.

the recipe was delicious! I added 1 thing but followed everything else to the "T". I added chocolate. I melted 1/2 cup chocolate chips in a double broiler on low and then poured the chocolate on the crust before I put the coconut batter in, it come out fantastic. Be sure to either use a pasrty brush or spoon to evenly spread the chocolate on the crust, comes out like a thin laver of a chocolate and tastes similar to a mounds candy bar. yummm!

I have made this pie recipe SEVERAL times. Each time, everyone raves about it.  I even won first prize in a pie bake off with this recipe.  Two minor things I did differently: (1) I added about 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract (in addition to the vanilla).  (2) A handful of extra flaked coconut.

~~I suggest using whole milk when making this pie.  It makes for a very creamy filling.

~~JUST FYI~~ I have made this lactose-free before.  In order to do that, use Nucoa margarine instead of butter and lactose-free milk instead of regular milk.  It turns out just the same as the regular recipe.  PLUS for LOWER SUGAR, you can substitute 1/2 the sugar with Splenda.  I have done this for my husband (who is diabetic) and he didn't notice a difference.

This one is just the best!  I did substitute 1 cup coconut milk for 1 cup milk.  It gave the pie a much better flavor. It is very rich and smooth and received rave reviews at the dinner table.

Very good, rich, and super easy pie. I used the microwave prep instructions many reviewers suggested and it turned out great. Just remember that if you switch the flour for corn starch you don't need to use as much- corn starch thickens better than flour.

This pie is SO good and SO easy! Every other recipe I looked at called for ingredients I didn't have or was just too much work. This one is great because it was all stuff I had! What's even better is you can omit the coconut and make it into a totally different pie! I used a graham cracker crust and it was delicious! I also added a meringue topping with toasted coconut and pecans and the pie held up great.

It did take a while to set fully which was annoying because I wanted it right away! I suggest using a double boiler though because unless you're constantly stirring your mixture will burn. ALSO the egg whites aren't supposed to be used so throw them into a meringue!

I used coconut milk instead of regular milk, and it was fantastic.  My boys (2 teens and 1 husband) loved it and they fought over the piece leftover.  It does make alot of filling so use one deep dish or 2 regular shells.  Chill it very well so it cuts easily.

Very tasty, but not quite as good as the coconut cream recipe I've used in the past.  I would suggest using 1/4 cup cornstarch as the thickener instead of the 1/2 cup flour, so that the texture will be smoother.  2 tsp. vanilla gives it just a bit more oomph, and I used 1/2 tsp. salt.

I have to admit I did get tripped up by the fact that the ingredient list cited "4 eggs," and not "4 egg yolks."  Since I am a fairly accomplished baker, I really was not reading the instructions that well, and went ahead and added the 4 eggs  instead of just the yolks.  Didn't seem to really affect the final product, other than the increased calorie content.  However, I think it would help to make a correction to the ingredient list, if possible.  Overall, this is a pretty decent little recipe.

I added an extra half cup of coconut as other reviewers seemed to have liked more in their pie, but next time I will only add one cup as directed; I felt that the addition made the texture of the filling too thick and chewy, but the taste was still good. Otherwise, I used a graham cracker crust and topped with lots of whipped cream. Will definitely make again, but without the extra coconut.

Excellent pie! I made a few changes only because I didn't have all ingredients on hand. First of all, I only used half the coconut - but I did toast it. My daughter hates coconut and she loved this pie! I also only used 3 eggs. I used a whisk while heating the custard and I didn't find myself tied to the stove. Just whisk often on med-low heat. I had no problems with lumps or brown spots and I used a regular stainless steel pan. I made a meringue with the egg whites using a scant 1/4 cup of white sugar and mixing with the blender on high until soft peaks formed. I put it under the broiler for barely 2 mins to brown and it was amazing! Both my kids have been begging me to make it again!

I made this recipe last night and my boyfriend said it was the best thing I've ever made and I cook all the time! I only changed a few minor things after reading some of the reviews. I used 1 1/2 cups of lite coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk, 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of the flour and added an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and a little bit more coconut in the actual pie. I topped the pie with Lite Cool Whip and sprinkled toasted coconut on top of it. I cooked this on medium, stirring the whole time and it only took about 10 minutes or so to thicken up properly. Great recipe! I will make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have never written a review but was so impressed with this pie that I had to comment. I followed the recipe exactly. Took this pie to a pig roast and everyone raved. I also used this as a base to make a peanut butter pie. I simply used half a cup of peanut butter in place of the coconut. The results were wonderful.

First time making this kind of pie and it was great!   I did substitue 1C of coconut milk and used cornstarch instead of flour.  It set up and was tasty!  I am not a great cook so if I can make this anyone can!

I made this for someone else who loves coconut cream pie and I was told it is a bit on the sweet side compared to others.

Cooks up quick and easy. I used one can coconut milk plus 2 cups skim milk, and increased coconut to 1.5 cups. We LOVED this pie.

This recipe is excellent.  I'm coconut crazy, so instead of using all milk, I added one can of coconut milk, which measured about 1 1/2 cups, then used regular milk to make 3 cups.

CC pie is my all-time favorite dessert; I've made a good many of them in the last 45 years in the kitchen. But even I learned a few things by trying this recipe. I read the reviews, and on the strength of those, I changed one thing: Instead of using 3 cups of milk for the custard portion as I have done for decades, I used 1.5 cups milk and a can (roughly 15 oz) of coconut milk. The addition of coconut milk increases the coconut flavor without adding a bunch of (texturally unpleasant) coconut shreds. But even better, it causes the custard part of the pie to hold its shape better than most CC pie recipes. This is great if you have pie left the second day. Also, stabilizing the whipped cream (topping) is highly desirable. It causes the whipped cream to hold its shape, not slump or weep within 24 hours. I used 1 tsp of unflavored gelatin, softened in 2 T cold water. Once it had jelled in a glass Pyrex cup (about 5 mins) I heated it in the microwave for 25 seconds, cooled it a minute, then let it fall in a steady slow stream into the bowl of 1 cup of heavy whipping cream as I whipped the cream for the topping. The two pieces of leftover CC pie were as well formed and attractive the day after I made the pie as they were the day I made it. Absolutely: stabilize your whipped cream topping. This recipe truly is stupendous. I will not use any other for CC pie in the future.

I used one can of coconut milk for half of the milk requirement.  Overall, this recipe is too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to maybe 3/4 cup.

I subsituted 3/4 c splenda for the 1c sugar. Making it sugar free (unless you use the sweet coconut, then it is not fully sugar free). You can buy unsweetened coconut flakes to make it completely sugar free. I also subsituted the vanilla flavor for coconut flavoring. Turned out so coconutty! This pie recipe is perfect!

This pie is a no brainer! Loved it- will make it again and again. I didn't change a thing except cool whip and toasted coconut on the top after the pie had was cooled for about 4 hours! This did take a bit to thicken so be patient. If you had problems with this pie setting then you probably didn't thicken it enough while cooking because this set within minutes of cooling on my counter. Great pie!

Wow!  Hands down the best coconut pie I've ever made.  It does take a little time, but it's easy (just have to babysit it while it's cooking so it doesn't burn).  Definitely worth the time and effort.  I filled a deep dish crust to the top, covered with whipped topping, and garnished with toasted coconut.  Mmmmm!

Wonderful!  Yummy!  It may take 30 minutes to make, but it is an easy recipe!  

I also used 1 cup of cream of coconut mixed with 2 cups of milk, and it was GREAT!  I would also recommend using a deep dish pie crust--there is plenty of pie filling to fill it up!

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  This will definately be a family favorite for many years to come!

AWE-SOME!  As some other reviewers suggested, I used a can of coconut milk and the balance of regular milk.  I also covered the pie with whipped topping and  additional toasted coconut.  Not only was it a show-stopper, but it was soooo delicious.  I will be making this one again for sure!

Mmm, delicious.  First time I ever made a cream pie from scratch.  Turned out fabulous.  I was a little apprehensive about some of the mixture sticking to the pot and then ending up with little lumps but once the coconut is added you can't notice it.  You must stir this mixture at all times to avoid this.
Topped it with whipped cream and sprinkled some toasted coconut on top. I will most certainly make this again.

I made this for my coworker's birthday and EVERYONE raved over it.  One of them asked me for the recipe a couple of weeks later when she told me she actually craves the pie (and she doesn't ever crave anything!)  Two changes that I made:  I used half and half instead of milk (makes it richer-tasting) and I toasted the coconut before putting it in the pie mixture (gives the pie a stronger coconut flavor).  I served the pie with fresh whipped cream with toasted coconut.  Delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is by far not only the best coconut cream pie I have ever made, but also the best I have ever eaten!  I prepared with minor changes.  I did not turn on the heat until the first cup of milk was added to avoid burning the sugar/flour mixture.  I used only 1 tsp of vanilla extract and added 1/2 tsp of coconut extract to amp up the coconut flavor.  When I made my whipped cream, I also added a little of the coconut extract and topped it with some toasted coconut.  Absolutely fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!

This is definitely a keeper,  I loved the creamy texture!!  The only changes I made were adding a bit more coconut to the mixture, as well as toasted coconut sprinkled on top of pie, then I made a really nice whipped cream border around the edge of the pie...This is a really delicious pie!!!

Overall, this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Instead of all vanilla, we did half a teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of coconut extract to give it more coconut flavor.  I also think instead of flaked coconut inside the pie, I should have used shredded, because then it wouldn't have been so chunky.

This was a wonderful pie. I followed the directions as stated except I used a can of coconut milk and then used regular milk to equal the 3 cups. I baked a pie shell to use and it broke, so I used a chocolate cookie crust I had on hand. Very good and I will definitely make again.

Everyone who tries this pie says it's amazing! I added 1/4 cup more coconut and 1 teaspoon more vanilla, and topped it with homemade whipped cream. This is my dad's absolute favourite of all the desserts I make; he goes CRAZY for it and even brags about it to other people whenever the subject of my baking comes up in conversation. Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe--it tastes heavenly and has earned me a great reputation as a baker.

This is an excellent pie.  My local grocer had half-and-half on sale, so I prepared the pie with that instead of milk.  If you like thick, rich and creamy ... this is the ticket.  I also had a couple of pre-made graham cracker shells left over from holiday baking, so the first time I made this pie I used the graham cracker crust.  It was so good that I'll probably use graham crackers every time.  Coconut cream is my husband's favorite and I was not a fan of coconut cream at all until I made this recipe.   This pie is so good that it can definitely change one's mind about coconut cream.  We top with freshly whipped heavy cream and a few flakes of toasted coconut, for a beautiful presentation.  However, this pie is tasty enough to be served plain.  Thanks to Mary for submitting this recipe.  I'll be preparing this pie for many years to come.

Great!! Only suggestion - definitely add whipped cream on top, whip it fresh, but don't add sugar to it. The pie is sweet enough!

Excellent pie.  To get a more coconut taste, I added 1/2 teaspoon coconut flavoring to the custard -- at the same time I stirred in the beaten eggs.

This is an excellent recipe, I made my best coconut cream pie ever! Coconut cream is my husband's and brother's favorite and always try to make it when my brother comes to visit. I always just used coconut cream pudding mix but couldn't find it in the store when he was visiting last month so I looked up this recipe for it. It was amazing!     My husband keeps bringing it up and asking when I'm going to make it again! Making it today! try this recipe, I will never us another recipe for coconut cream pie, this is THE one!!

I substituted 1.5 cups cream of coconut for 1.5 cups of half and half. I sprinkled chocolate chips into the bottom of the pie shell before adding the hot filling, then used a knife to swirl the melting chocolate throughout the pie. This chocolate/coconut cream pie was a big success!

Made this pie for my 9 year old son and it was wonderful.  I used 1c coconut milk and 2c regular milk for more coconut flavor.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

Awesome!  I use the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site, and it was incredible.  I made the filling the night before, to intensify the coconut flavor through the custard, and that was a great idea.  It held up perfectly through a meringue addition and baking, as well as sitting out in the warm spring air at a picnic.  We will have this again!

Added: I have used the same basic recipe without coconut to make vanilla or chocolate pudding, and they are fantastic!

Best pie EVER!!! I made it for my family and considering that I'm a teen and it tasted scrumptious, anyone can make it. Instead of buying a crust I made the one that NURSECHRIS gave a recipe for. (THANK YOU!) My Dad loves the pie and is thinking of having it for his birthday dessert instead of cake. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This is a GREAT and easy pie to make.  It does go faster if you heat your milk first.  I have made this several times and didn't have milk but had heavy cream so I used 2 cups of that and 1 cup of water.  Came out very rich but a favorite and requested again!

Delicious! Delicious! The last thing I want to do when I find a recipe is make a bunch of alterations based on the comments section. Well... this recipe is absolutely perfect just the way it is written! I followed the recipe exactly! Once the pie cooled, I smoothed on almost a tub of Cool Whip and sprinkled with toasted coconut (the coconut package has directions for toasting). Yumm-o!!!

This came out really good with one exception: It didn't really have the coconut flavor I expected. So next time I will substitute 1 cup of the milk for the coconut milk and try it that way!

My husband had intimidated me not to make his favorite pie with tales of how perfect his grandmother's was. I made this one and he loved it better than grandma's! I used one cup of heavy cream plus 2 cps milk which made it heavier and creamier. It was easy and fast to make.

This was very good however I personally didn't like the big flakes of coconuts throughout the whole pie.  Next time I think I will try to food process them before adding to the pie mix. I definately will make this recipe again!!

I made this for my discriminating 18 yr old son for his birthday, and he absolutely LOVED it!  I changed the flour to 1/3 cup cornstarch and replaced 1 teaspoon vanilla for coconut exctract.  I cooked it in the microwave rather than the stove.  After it was cool I added a merangue topping.  Excellent!!  It's a keeper for me!  Thanks Mary!

I made this pie for Easter dinner and it came out terrible!!  I must have done something really wrong because the pie came out really runny!  It didn't set at all!  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it the way the recipe stated. It looked right when I poured it into the pie crust. If anyone has any insight on what I might have done wrong please let me know!

Great recipe . The only change I made for a little more sweetness was an additional tablespoon of sugar and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla . Yummy and so easy , not sure why some had problems with the filling setting up , I had no problem but after it came to a boil I let it boil about 1 more minute while stirring continuously .

Consistency was amazing! Firm and coconutty and awesome. If you're really a coconut lover Id put a cup and a half of coconut. I covered with a layer of whipped cream and sprinkled toasted coconut ontop before serving.

This was an excellent pie.  Only few changes made.   I used one can of coconut milk in place of some of the milk amount as others suggested.  I mixed the sugar with the flour first and slowly added milk mixture = no lumps   I also made a whipped egg white topping

As good as the ones from restaurant ;) I put 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup milk, otherwise I cant really taste the coconut. And I topped with wipped cream and toasted shredded coconuts, it was a hit!

Coconut Cream is one of my husband's favorites .. well really ANY kind of pie is his favorite LOL .. In the past I have had difficulty getting custard like pies to thicken and set - I was pleased when this one was a success.  I used 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 of skim and toasted old fashioned unsweetened thick shred coconut - saving some for the top ... this will be a recipe I will use a LOT!  Next time I think I will cut back just a little on the sugar and maybe make a small one with Splenda for my mom who is diabetic.

I made this for Father's Day because Coconut pie is my dad's favorite from when he was a kid. This was my first time making a homemade cream pie and he absolutely loved it, he said it reminded him of my grandma's pie, which made me feel great. I made one for my husband too and he had it knocked out by the end of the day. Thanks for the recipe. ( I also used the egg whites to make merigue)

I used a graham cracker crust instead of the regular pie shell. I topped it with cool whip and toasted coconut over the entire thing. My family loved it.

Excellent - so very glad to find this recipe.  The one I've used for years had only 3 eggs and 2 cups milk, and this makes just enough more filling for the 10" pie plate.  The only difference was that I used cornstarch before, but the end result was still very good.  used egg whites, a bit of cream of tartar and about 1/2 c. sugar for meringue then sprinkled with a little more coconut and baked at 325 'til meringue was lightly browned.  Thanks for the recipe post.  4/15/17.  Scalding at least part of the milk before adding to the sugar and flour shortens the cooking time.  Excellent recipe - no fail.

Absolutely delicious!  Rich and creamy, no need to use cream in place of milk.  If you let the pie sit until the next day, the coconut comes through even more.  I didn't want to waste the egg whites so I made a meringue Using 1/4 C. sugar and egg whites beating until stiff peaks form and baking until peaks start to turn golden.

I used this recipe and found it delish...I cook it in a glass bowl in the microwave.  Just stir it a few times while cooking.  I also add some artificial coconut flavouring for extra flavour.  Everyone I serve this to gets rave reviews....

This turned out well - with some of the adjustments suggested by others.  I was a little concerned about the "floury" comments so used a scant 1/2 cup.  I don't know if that was necessary though, because there was no consistency problem and no taste of flour paste.  I also took the advice of toasting the coconut and adding another 1/3 cup.  I used a can of coconut milk and added enough milk to make up to the 3 cups.  I also added in a Tablespoon of Coconut Rum along with a really good quality vanilla.  With those adjustments this came out well - nice coconut flavor but not overly sweet or unbearably rich.  If you really want the taste of cocunut, I think you need to make some of the adjustments others have suggested.  Without those, we would have been disappointed.

As usual with a new recipe, I followed this one as written, with one exception.  When I stirred in the one cup of coconut, it didn't seem quite enough, so I added about 1/3 cup more.  I used a heavy, stainless steel saucepan, kept the heat on medium the whole time, and stirred like a maniac; and there was NO scorching, as some of the reviewers reported.  It turned out absolutely perfect.  I would have given this recipe five stars, except for the need for more coconut.

BEST ever..Better than the pastry chef at my fiances country club which he thought was the Best until now.  For the Liquid Used 1 Can of PET Evaporated Milk. PET Taste the best. Cup of Silk brand Vanilla Flavored Coconut Milk, Cup of Heavy Whipping Cream. Also Used Coconut Extract in place of Vanilla. Use Sweetened Coconut for sure. Also, I used the Pillsbury Pie Crust. Could win a prize !! Used the double boiler idea posted to cook it, using the microwave. Excellent Excellent !!

i really love coconut cream pie but i have never had a homeade one so i decided to make one. It was a hit for my family it went so quick so decided to make another. when i made the first one i wanted to make homeade whipcream but it didnt work out because it started to look like cottage cheese i think i whipped it to long so DONT WHIP IT TO LONG. So i used cool whip in a pastry bag and it was delich but would have been better with a little less coconut and homeade whipp cream. In the second one i put a tad bit to much vanilla butit still tasted GREAT!!!!!!!!

Taste was delicious by custard didn't "set up" to be firm.  I don't know if I did something wrong.  Recipe said to separate eggs, and whip them up separately.   After tempering the yolks with the hot milk mixture, I added the rest of the yolks and then the whipped egg whites.  I don't know if I shouldn't have added the whites.  That made it frothy and thinner.  I don't see the instructions in the recipe about what to do with the whites.  Any advice is appreciated.  Taste, however, was delicious. I also added coconut extract in place of some of the vanilla.

I made this pie (my first) for a co-worker's birthday.  He loves pies and said this was the best coconut cream pie he's ever had.  Ended up making a 2nd pie from the extra ingredients I had leftover, and her family raved!  Thanks for this recipe - it's a winner!

Made it exactly as recipe stated.  Turned out delicious.  A bit rich.  Best to use a deep dish pie crust as there is quite alot filling left over.  Would be better to mix filling with whipped cream before filling crust.  Or maybe topping with whipped cream.

Instead of a traditional crust, I used a pre-made shortbread cookie crust, and topped the pie with some toasted coconut.  It was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving dinner this year.

I made this pie last night for Fathers Day, since coconut pie is my dads fav, & it turned out fanTASTIC!  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers & made a few mods for more coconut flavor:  1/4 C corn starch (vs. 1/2 C flour), 1 C coconut milk (plus 2 C regular milk) & coconut extract (vs. vanilla).  I also toasted some of the coconut & put it on top of the whip cream.  Absolutely delightful, and my dad loved it :)

The first time was a flop. I tried the double-boiler method, but I think I was supposed to put the mixture into a real pan after adding the egg yolk, so it may have been my mistake. It didn't set. The second time I followed the recipe to a T and the pie came out PERFECT. My mother-in-law grew up with old-fashioned PA Dutch custard pie and she thought this was great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will use again for sure!!!

Medium heat is too low in my opinion.  Maybe I'm not patient enough.  Med-high with constant stirring worked better for me.

I couldn't decide between using coconut milk or regular, so I made two pies. The coconut milk version was the winner, by far. I would lighten the sugar a bit next time, since the coconut milk is so sweet. I topped both with fresh whipped cream. Delicious.

I made this pie today and it is wonderful.  It has a very creamy texture.  I did substitute the sugar for Splenda for baking (which is 1/2 sugar &1/2 splenda).  And I also added 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract just to boost the coconut flavor.  My husband and kids loved it.  I will be making this again.

I have used this recipe over and over and every time it receives rave reviews!  It comes out perfect everytime.  Takes a little while to thicken, but be patient, it will happen.  I then use egg whites and sugar for a meringue topping with a little toasted coconut sprinkles on top.  Look no further for a better coconut cream pie recipe!  I've tried so many I've lost count and this is the best.

This recipe is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!  I made this for Easter, doubled it to make two pies, and they were almost all gone (even though there were at least 6 different desserts)!  After doubling I had plenty of filling to fill both 9" deep-dish pies as well as two very small tart-sized pies (3" each) for my Mom who was in the hospital.  I "cheated" by using a refrigerated already made pie crust (pre-baking it as directed) and followed Mary's recipe to the letter.  Like several others I also topped them with toasted coconut and served it with whipped cream.  These pies were PERFECT!  They looked great, tasted even better and were such a great hit...even the professional Chef that was there wanted to know who made the pies! Hats off to Mary!!!

This is the best coconut cream pie I've ever had.  I found this recipe some time ago, but I lost it.  I was so excited to find it again.  Easter lunch would have been a disappointment without it.

Delicious, somewhat of a novice at making desserts from scratch but directions were spot on. The results were amazing. It reminded me of the pies my granny used to make. Will definitely make again to impress family and friends.

I have to give this five stars, instead of a baked pie shell, I made a crushed vanilla wafer one; with this crust, it's a four.  I should have put forth the extra effort.  The custard was yummy, with a velvety texture. I like Trader Joe's shredded coconut; it has a bit of body to it...  I will definitely make this again; as soon as I get my pie crust recipe lesson from my friend, Louise.  I used coconut cream & the remainder skim milk; also used cornstarch instead of flour.  Perfect!

Decent, but far too sweet for my tastes.  I think that I would use 3/4 or even 1/2 of the sugar next time.  I bumped the coconut content up to 1 1/2 cups (following other reviews), but that ended up being a bit too much.

I did make a few changes based on the reviews that I read. I used a can of coconut milk and whole milk. I also used the corn starch instead of flour. I followed the recipe otherwise. I made it last night, and tasted the filling which was super yum even hot, and let it set in the fridge over night. I will serve it for Easter dinner tonight. It is definitely set up `and nice and thick.

Custard is delicious but it was still runny after being refrigerated over night for 6 hours. The only changes I made to the recipe were I added one cup of coconut milk in place of one cup of milk and I used 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour as suggested by previous reviews. I will try more cornstarch next time.

Excellent pie! I'm not a fan of "too much" coconut taste, so this is perfect: the taste is delicate and the pie is delectable. 

Two things: I used only 3/4 cups of sugar, and I didn't strain the mixture. I didn't see the need. It was creamy and smooth from the beginning, and thickened up in no time at all. I'm a great fan of the double-boiler method, though, so perhaps this is the difference. As another reviewer noted, if you don't have a double boiler, just use a metal mixing bowl over a pot of simmering water.

Easy and delicious. To ramp up the coconut flavor, I used a can of coconut milk in place of two cups of the milk, and soy milk for the rest. The pie isn't pretty, so I whipped a small container of Richs Whip and spread it over the pie. That left it pretty and added a great creaminess. The whole family liked this.

This is a wonderful, easy to make pie. I only made 2 small changes to the recipe. I used whole milk for the extra creaminess and used 1 t of coconut flavoring and 1/2 t of vanilla. I wanted the additional coconut taste in the filling and it was so good! I took this pie to work and had requests for the recipe right away. A must have recipe for any coconut lover!

This recipe is very good.  Few tips for the novice cooks out there, first of all use corn starch instead of flour if you have it about 1/3 of a cup. Mix corn starch with the sugar thoroughly .  Do not add it to the milk until milk is hot and stir constantly using a whisk,  spoons only make it lumpy.  Once the taste of corn starch is cooked out of the mixture add a little of the mixture to the egg yolks before and stir together to bring up the temperature of the eggs before adding to mixture this will also avoid lumps, cook for another 5 minutes while stirring all the time , remove from heat add vanillia and toasted coconut to the mixture, this will bring out the taste of coconut in your pie.  There is no need to add coconut flavouring, if you want it to taste like something you bought in a store be my guest, but then why are you making a pie at home.  Let it set overnight in refridgerator it will taste 100%  better (like coconut cream pie should } the next day!
Bon appetite!

This was my first attempt at making a coconut cream pie and it turned out fabulous!  The only change I made was to cut back on the amount of sugar used.  I used 3/4 c instead of the full cup and added about a Tbsp of coconut cream.  

Next time will cut back the sugar to 12 c as I still found it to be too sweet.  Excellent recipe overall.

Soooo good!!  I used 1% milk. Cooked in microwave instead of stovetop for 10 minutes, stirring every 2-3 minutes.  Worked great!  Made 1 pie with bananas on the bottom of the crust too.

My husband made this the first time and it came out great. We used a can of coconut milk instead of all milk. The second time I made the pie it didn't set. I saw that other people had this problem and I believe it is because it was not cooked on the stove long enough. The filing is good though.

Great recipe! Using a double broiler makes pie set faster, but using saucepan is quicker and easier. Let set for 7 hours before topping with cool whip and toasted coconut.

Excellent pie as is. I made it per the recipe. I agree that it's a custard pie, like some of the reviewers said, but a great custard nevertheless. I put the custard mix in a glass bowl in the microwave and did the 5 minutes stirring each 60 seconds; turned out perfect this way, and much quicker and less mess to clean up. I think next time I make it I will add at least another 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut, and maybe coconut milk in place of some milk for more flavor. I saved the 4 egg whites and made a meringue to go on top of the pie. Very, very good!
UPDATE: 2nd pie made with 1 c. coconut milk + 2 c. half and half. Also increased the coconut to 1.5 cups. I liked the first pie with 3 c. milk better; this was rich and thick, but it was too much for me. I did like the extra 1/2 c. flaked coconut in the filling, however.

This pie was great!! I took the next step and whipped the 4 egg whites into a meringue about 4 inches tall, toasted in a 375 oven for about 15 min or so, until it was golden brown. Mmmm!!!

After several disappointments buying pies, I was looking for just the right coconut cream pie recipe to make one myself, and I won't be looking any further.  This one has just the right thick creamy rich consistency I was looking for.  Like others, we like merengue topped pies, so I used the egg whites to make that. i really like coconut, and ended up adding probably a whole extra cup of coconut and it was just right for me.  Also, i happened to have a can of coconut milk on hand, so i used that and then regular milk to make the 3 cups of milk since others had though the coconut flavor was a little light.  i would call this a perfect coconut cream pie. Great recipe - thank you!

I made this pie at work and it sold out immediately to rave reviews.  Before this, my idea of a coconut cream pie was instant vanilla pudding with coconut added.  This recipe was very easy and the results are outstanding!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. My husband loves it as I am sure will the children when I surprise them after dinner. I added 1/4 cup extra coconut and roasted some to top with but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I have never made a coconut cream pie before but see no reason to ever try another recipe. Thank you Mary!

We love this pie!  We made the second one with a layer of chocolate pudding pie filling on top, and homemade whipped cream on top of that.  We were still able to scarf up 5 small bowls of the filling right off the stove.  Bravo!

This recipe makes a great pie. First time making a coconut cream pie, or pudding style filling from scratch. 
Made it diabetic and celiac friendly by substituting sugar and flour and used a fresh vanilla bean.

Way too sweet! I didn't like it at all.  Tasted fake and processed even though it was homemade.

Very good filling. It does make a lot of filling as others have said, use a deep dish or you can just eat the extra as a "pudding". The only change I made was I added more coconut as I love the flavor.

Great! I was a little apprehensive that the filling was too runny when I was combining with the egg yolks, but I just cooked the final mixture for a little longer on the stove before adding it to the pie crust. After cooling, it firmed up nicely. mmmm pie!

Mmmm mmmm good!!! This pie was super good!!! I made it with Ruth Grandma's Pie Crust recipe on this site and it was perfect. I think the recipe is really good as is, and the only thing I did different was that I added a little more coconut and I put toasted coconut on the top. I would definitely recommend this pie!!Delic!!

Although I had my eye on the stovetop, the mixture still burned on the bottom. I did my best to save the good part, but of course the cream tastes slightly burnt. I hate when that happens.  The recipe didn't say what to do with the egg whites so I whipped them and added a meringue

This was very, very good. I cut the filling ingredients in half (but kept the full cup of flaked coconut) because I was only making it for two people and I didn't want a huge pie - it fit perfectly in a foil 8 inch baking dish. I made a very thick graham cracker crumb crust which was the perfect complementing taste to the coconut. Because I was only using half the quantity of ingredients, I ended up only using coconut milk, which is GREAT for lactose intolerant folks - this ends up becoming essentially a dairy-free, rich creamy dessert (but watch what you use for the crust). Topped with Lite Cool Whip and toasted flaked coconut which not only made it pretty but enhanced the flavor. One other thing: since I'm incredibly leery about eating raw eggs (I know they were supposedly cooked for 2 minutes, but that didn't seem enough for me) I stuck the pie in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes and it was PERFECT. Chilled for about 3-4 hours before cutting. Thanks for this recipe - my husband raved!

This was a great recipe!  My first success at a cream pie and it turned out really well.  I even handmade the whipped cream.  Mmm, yum, never buying it again.  I agree with the comment earlier that you need to let it sit or it doesn't taste a whole lot like coconut.  For some that might be a plus.  I made this for my father and he's a coconut freak, so letting it sit overnight helped to bring the flavor out.

A little labor intensive, but worth it.  I made the recipe exactly per the recipe except that I toasted some coconut that was left in the bag and put it on top of the pie.  We were impatient and digged into the pie as soon as it was done cooling and we thought it tasted more vanilla than coconut.  When we ate it the next day, it was definitely coconut flavored though.  Really really good.  It was a hit with me, my husband an my mother in law and the three of us ate it all.

Just finished making this pie for my brother and his family. it came out absolutely delicious! I liked the simple ingrediants and ease of makin, but also the fact that it is fully homeade (the filling at least, although I like making my own pastry shellss) and the straightforward process to make it was a plus. Will make it again!

This coconut cream pie is the most delicious one I have ever  tasted.  Made it for a holiday dinner for my husbands family and it got rave reviews!  The only addition I did was to add  a layer of fresh whipped cream after it had been chilled overnight and a sprinkling of some freshly toasted coconut.  This one is a definite keeper.

Great recipe once I got it right.  I burned the mixture twice. I then only cooked it on low and it worked great.  I added extra coconut due to the post that said it didn't taste very coconutty.  I will make this again.

I have to say I was terrified to make my very first "cream pie", especially since I was making it for a dr. I work with. I made 2 pies, the first one I over cooked only because I was so worried that it wasn't "thick & bubbly" enough(hahaa opps). Needless to say that one set up no problem, so the 2nd one I didn't cook quite as long & it also set up great! All in all, its fool proof! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great Pie! I don't think it is fair to rate a recipe after making alot of changes to it. Having said that, I did use a graham cracker crust and sprinkled the top with toasted coconut, otherwise I made the filling as written. The result was a simply wonderful old fashioned custard pie. I didn't think it was difficult or time consuming and the texture was perfect. Everyone loved it.

I thought it needed more of a coconut flavor. If I make this again I will either use coconut extract or put some toasted coconut on top. The filling had a real good creamy texture.

This was AWESOME!!  My family loves coconut and this pie was just too good for our own good!  Very creamy...I toasted the coconut slightly and added a little on top, but that was the only change.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is really good.  It did take a half hour, but like the recipe says, worth it.  I put mine in a graham cracker crust to save some time.

This recipe was HEAVENLY! Just make sure to cook the coconut cream mixture long enough to make sure it is thick enough and avoid a runny mess.  I made some whipped cream (using heavy whipping cream and a little sugar) and decorated the top of the pie with it which added a nice touch. Great for holidays or dinner parties!

I made this last night and it was wonderful!  I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe (use a little more than half for one deep-dish crust), made real whipping cream for the top after it cooled, followed by toasted coconut which made it look professional.  I cooked the pudding on a double boiler and got impatient for it to boil, so I put it in the microwave for a minute until it did.  The filling was the perfect consistency - not runny, not too firm, just creamy.  I have never made a coconut cream pie before and this recipe would be hard to beat.

A little too sweet as posted so the second time around I adjusted the sugar and the coconut flakes.  Next time I want to try substituting sugar with Splenda.

Great taste, my husband ate all but the two slices I had.  Probably just me but mine was a little runny.  Still looking for a pie like my mom used to make, unfortunately her recipes were thrown out.

This is a great recipe, it takes a little time but not a great amount. I like the coconut in the filling it gave it a great taste.  I put whipped cream on top, yummy.

I make this pie and take it to my church on special occasions. Everyone loves it. It is usually the first pie gone. I add more coconut than it calls for. I add 2 handfuls of coconut. I toast some coconut and sprinkle the roasted coconut over the meringue then I brown the meringue. Love Love  this recipe.

Worst recipe I've ever used in my life. I see a lot of  positive reviews on this where  they changed up ingredients. No one should have to change a receipt to begin with.  Like others were saying, didn't set,  soupy. The flavor wasn't even good. I tried to fix it with thickeners and tried to salvage it as a pudding. It was like eating melted vanilla ice cream. Use another receipt, this one is horrible. Wast of time, money and ruined my holiday menu!

Absolutely fantastic.  The only wrinkle:  the custard didn't want to go through the strainer so I'm going to skip this step next time.

Use 2% milk, not skim.  Also, you can get meringue powder at craft chain stores which will make a meringue for the topping without adding a raw-egg hazard. 

This just made our Thanksgiving dinner.

I love this recipe. The bread always comes out soft and fluffy. The cooking time for me is much shorter though at only 45 min at 300 degrees. I always make a cream cheese/orange marmalade spread to accompany it. Everyone loves it. Thank you Chef John once again for an awesome recipe!

I had never made a coconut cream pie before but love them. This was not too difficult and very yummy. I did add a little more coconut to the recipe which I liked. I also served it one day after making it, which let the ingredients meld . I will definitely make it again soon!

I used a 15 oz can of Trader Joe's Coconut milk, and the rest just milk. Used 3 Tbsp corn starch instead of flour. Added 2 1/2  cups coconut. Perfect! Was a big hit at the party

I made the pie yesterday for Thanksgiving.  The pie looked perfect and tasted great.  I did use a bagged flaked natural coconut that was not sweetened.  I toasted some coconut on a cookie sheet in the oven to top it.  I did not have a problem with the custard burning.  I mixed the ingredients with a whisk at first then switched to a spatula to keep the custard from sticking to the edges and bottom of the pan.  The pie was excellent and the only thing I would do differently would be to save the egg whites and make a meringue topping as a previous reviewer did.  And plan on making it again tomorrow, it was so good.

Wonderful pie, I did add a can of coconut milk and added enough milk to make 3 cups. I only used 3 egg yolks. I added 1/4 tsp of imitation coconut flavour as well. It is one of the best coconut pies I've had. I'm sure I'll be craving this all the time.

My moth in law is in hospice It was wonderful and not as hard as I thought it would be. I’m not much of a pie baker or a custard and pudding maker. I used a Pillsbury crust. I also made this lactose free by using lactose free milk and lactose free butter (Green Valley).

Followed recipe exactly.  Pie never set up.  it's just soup in a pie shell.

And it was a homemade crust... what a waste.

I followed instructions completely, except for straining the mixture the first time I made it, as it wasn't necessary. The 2nd time I cooked it, the strainer was needed, but the 3rd (yesterday morning) time it wasn't needed either.. Absolutely delicious. I used a pie crust bought from a grocery store - 9" diameter, and it was totally filled up - up to the brim. 
Psst, don't say anything to anyone, but I'm going to the kitchen now and make this for tonight's dessert.
I cannot remember a better Coconut Cream Pie in my 68 years. And that type pie is my all-time favorite.

So I followed the recipe to the letter,but the cream didn't set?   Also the picture shows a topping - either meringue or whipped cream or something?   What is it as I would've liked to add that but glad I didn't as it would've been a waste considering cream didn't set?   Any ideas?

Made this for my hubby today as a birthday treat.  Followed the recipe exactly, and then topped with cool whip and topped with fresh toasted coconut and sliced almonds.  Straining the pudding made the difference.  It was smooth and cooled just enough for the butter to give it a beautiful gloss,  My Mom said it was “fit for kings!”.  Thank you for this delicious recipe

I made it according to the instructions and found it too sweet, not enough coconut flavor...but, more critical -- it didn't "set". When I cut the first piece, the filling FLOWED into the rest of the pan. I decided not to serve it to others -- and finished it off in a bowl, eating it like a cobbler.

My other half said this was the best coconut cream pie he's ever had.  I used 1 c. coconut milk, 1/2 c. whip cream, 1/2 c. skim and 1 c. whole milk  (wanted to use what was left in the fridge), and added 1.5 +/- cups of shredded coconut and the rest was exactly like the recipe.  I used a non-stick pan over med (3) gas heat, and stirred, stirred, stirred.  And NO BURN!  Also, topped it with a pint of heavy whip cream, sweetened with Splenda and a touch of vanilla.  This was my first time making this type of pie and it was PERFECT!!!!  Not too sweet, very coconutty, and exceptionally delicious.  Thanks for the new recipe.  It s a keeper!!

My second time making using his recipe. Simple and a hit with the all who ate it. My only change was cutting back on the amount of sugar from 1C to 1/2C. Just the right about of sweetness.

I made this and followed it to the t.  Not sure what I did wrong. The pie did not settle and was runny.  The flavor was very good. This recipe just not for me.

I would give this one more stars if I could!!!  Pie was super easy to make and my family loved it.  Seconds were asked for.  I only made one addition  to it.  Instead  of the one  cup of coconut, I made it with two cups of sweetened coconut.  Firm believer that there is no such thing as too much coconut.  I will be making this one again.

Loved it! Made it pretty much as recipe stated, other than added a bit more coconut like one other reviewer mentioned. I didn't put the custard through a strainer as it had zero lumps so I didn't see the need.  Will make this again!

I didn't have the heat up high enough so my filling never congealed! I recommend watching a YouTube video on making pudding on the stove before attempting...it would have really helped me!

This was fabulous and a huge hit. I used half and half instead of milk because I had some on hand to use up. I think it made it even richer and creamier. The only other change I would make next time would be to make two! Most everyone wanted seconds. Definitely worth the time it took to make it.

Wow -  wasn't sure what the texture would be - and I had no idea why I was suppose to run the hot custard through a strainer - now I do - very rich and creamy. I followed the recipe to a T....  came out perfect. Served with whipped cream, and all I could hear was grunts and groans in the room....thats a 5 star review.

I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.   I also omitted the coconut and added 1/2 of coco powder, and put the 1 cup sugar in pie.  Chocolate Cream Pie..  Very good.

I made this pie for my husband, he loved it! The only ingredient I changed was  milk. I used 1 1/2 cups of cream and 1 1/2 cups milk.  The reason I changed out the milk was I had the cream on hand. I would never not use cream from now on! It was delicious!

I can't articulate why I didn't make it a 5; I just feel there is one higher level possible. However I don't know what it is! I didn't strain mine. I think I might like the variance in consistency.

This is a very good recipe, but personally I am a huge fan of coconut. So to amp up the coconut flavor a little I added 1 tsp of coconut flavor to the custard. Also the custard didn't turn out as creamy or rich as I'd like it to be so I think next time I will be using cream instead of regular milk. Either that or I will use evaporated. I also used a star tip for icing and dotted the top of the pie with whipped cream and sprinkled on some toasted coconut just for looks.

My husband loves this pie!  it was definitely a winner in our family. I topped with cool whip but next time I will make a meringue topping instead. I will definitely make this pie regularly.   No need to search for any other recipe. This is perfect!

I made this righteous pie.... oh, my! I followed directions exactly as given.  (Ooops, I may have put a pinch more vanilla). Definately, one of my favorites!  Thx, for sharing this with us.

I didn't have my Moms recipe handy, so I thought this looked good.  I did exactly as recipe called for and it was great.  My Mom did use cornstarch in hers, but this turned out so good.  I mixed the flour,sugar, salt with the milk with a wire whip, then put into non stick pan, stirred constantly with a wooden spoon, and watched close to not scorch. Added eggs slowly and whipped in. I also toasted a little coconut to go on top.  I will make again.

I added the extra coconut to the custard (about a cup and a half) and added a meringue with toasted coconut...this is divine!! I am coco-nutty so this was a delicious dessert. I did not realize the shell had to be baked first so I had a bit of a delay in actual assembly.

Perfection.  I had never tried to make a coconut cream pie before this one.  It was surprisingly simple and to my amazement, I did not have one lump.  I made it as directed and followed a reviewer's suggestion of heavy cream, powdered sugar, and melted marshmallow to make the whipped topping.  It was sweet but not super sweet like the ones you will find in the grocery store or a restaurant.  It makes a large impressive pie that I will be proud to bring to the next holiday gathering.

I made this Incredible Coconut Cream pie today for my husband's birthday. It came out creamy and rich and perfectly coco-nutty! Instead of 3 cups of milk, I substituted one can of coconut milk (about 1 2/3 cup) and the balance with heavy whipping cream for a total of 3 cups liquid. It blended beautifully and I did not need to strain the custard. I also upped the coconut  to 1 1/4 cups (we REALLY like coconut!)  I used a ready-made Oreo cookie crust and it was the perfect host.  I topped it off with toasted coconut for one more layer of flavor.  Will absolutely be making this again!

This was absolutely delicious, but it was more of a custard pie than a coconut creme pie. Everyone who tried this loved it, but many were hesitant to taste it.

The taste is AMAZING, but the consistency is way too liquidy. I would definitely suggest using less milk and some corn startch to avoid coconut cream soup.

I made this recipe last week. It was fantastic. My family and I love coconut, and we all agreed that this was the best coconut cream pie we have ever had. I did use coconut extract instead of vanilla, but that was the only change I made.

Recipe good but did almost triple the coconut (I used a fresh one, just seems like too little coconut and too much custard). Also, thought... make a topping with the egg whites! There is a fluffy egg white icing that is great on this recipe site. Does seem like you need a topping!

First time making coconut cream pie. Both myself and my husbands favorite. I had read the reviews prior to making and used the coconut milk instead of regular milk. I am so glad I did it certainly added to the flavor. Got the thumb up from my husband so it is a keeper that I will make over and over.

Easy "homemade" coconut cream pie. Had all ingredients on hand.  Made a homemade pie crust only because I was too lazy to go to the store and buy one.  Another easy recipe off this wonderful site. Next time I'll use a double boiler for the cream pie mixture cause my stove, even on low has a tendency to run a little too hot, so I had to continue to watch for burning as I stirred.  One little trick I use when pre-baking the pie crust is after the first bake I brush egg white mixed with a little water onto the baked pie crust. Put it back into the oven just long enough to dry the egg mixture.  Doing this keeps the cream pie from seeping into the crust and making it soggy. That's only if it's not eaten quickly!

I made this recipe twice, and my family loved it both times. The boyfriend was especially impressed. I followed the recipe closely, but I did substitute the flour for 1/3 cup of cornstarch. I added whipped cream and a light sprinkle of grated chocolate and toasted coconut flakes on top. The pie never lasts for very long. :)

I made this today for Thanksgiving dessert especially for my father in law. I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it says, it NEVER set up! It was like a runny pudding in a shell. The flavour was ok. I was embarrassed and in tears,dessert was ruined. Doubt I'll ever try this one again.

Really good - I've made this a couple of times now.  I follow the recipe exactly, perhaps adding a bit more coconut.  Use unsweetened coconut flakes for less sweetness, or sweetened if you prefer it sweeter.  I like the idea of using coconut milk in place of some of the milk - I'll have to try that sometime!  So Delicious makes an unsweetened coconut milk beverage that would be a great replacement.  I top with whipped cream, then sprinkle with toasted coconut and mini chocolate chips. :)

Mine came out amazing! The only change I made was I added a cup of coconut water with 2 cups whole milk. This was the first cream pie I've ever made, and not only did it taste amazing, but it looked good. The pieces stayed together and everything!

this is one of my all time favorite recipes. I have been making this for years. I just recently found out that I am lactose intolerant and was missing this pie. I decided to try the recipe with unsweeted coconut milk (found in the Health Foods part of the grocery store) and it set up perfectly. It is a little sweeter, but if you make sure you use unsweetened coconut, it is perfect!

I've made this in a graham cracker crust and it is great!  It also is a pudding recipe - just bake crustless.

I have tried many but this one is the best.  I also add coconut to some cool whip and put it on top of the pie.  My family loved it.  I had some filling left over so I pour it over some vanilla wafers and it was just as delicious.  GEE

Loved it but changed it a tiny bit ~ used 2 cups coconut milk and 1 cup of regular 2% milk instead of 3 cups milk plus added a little bit more coconut & topped with toasted coconut!  My husband really liked it!

This custard pie is so delicious! I wasn't in the mood to make a crust but had a pre-made oreo crust on hand. Reaaaaly good.
Also, with costs where they are I used powdered milk and had no problems!

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS PIE!!!  Coconut cream pie is his favorite if it is made right.  His grandma always makes it for him and so for father's day I did and he said it was better than his grandma's and let me tell you that is a great compliment!!  I put coolwhip on the top and he thought it was to die for!!  Great recipe!!!!!!!!

Made this for my dad(a big sweet tooth). HE loved it and he dosen't even like coconut cream pie. I think it's because its not over powering on the coconut taste.I did use gramcraker and toasted coconut on top. Making again because he's craving it! Thanks for the recipe!!

This pie was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it including those who don't much care for coconut.  I made my own crust and used whipping cream to create an excellent topping.  Excellent!

I already reviewed this but I don't see it. In a nutshell, this pie is DIVINE!!!! I made it the first time with regular milk and butter and it was VERY VERY good. Then for my mother-in-law who can't have lactose, I used Lactaid milk and margarine and it turned out just as good. I was wary at first that the pie filling would be too gooey or runny because of a few other reviews, but I found it to be just perfect and it wasn't runny at all.
