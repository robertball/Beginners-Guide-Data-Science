This was a great treat for a bridal shower brunch I threw. To add to the presention I included a maraschino cherry and some cherry juice (about a tablespoon) to the orange juice and champagne mixture. The cherry juice sinks to the bottom of the glass, making a drink that is not only tasty but beautiful.

I have frequently made Mimosas by the glass, but it is a real time saver to know how to make a large batch.  The preportions on this recipe are great.

Very simple and very good.  I served this to a group of girls for a brunch and it was a hit.  I used orangepineapple juice with inexpensive champagne.  I also added some marachino cherries with some cherry juice and served it in a colorful glass pitcher.  (The cherries will sink to the bottom of the pitcher.)

I LOVE MIMOSA's and this is a great way to make them in bulk form! Went terrific with our Sunday brunch!! Although I went through the trouble the day before to get a nicer champagne, I think any brand will do. Serving a crowd? This is the beverage to go with for the adults! Measurements are right on!

Nothing like a Mimosa to start off a lazy day! I love these because they always remind me of the vacation my boyfriend and I took to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. They served us these right as we entered the doors to the resort. Great drink and a great memory!

Served this yesterday at a ladies luncheon. They all raved about it. Just the right proportions of juice to Champagne, Sue. Thanks!

This is a mimosa in case anyone wants to order it in a restaurant.  It's a classy alternative to the screwdriver and something you can have at brunch without anyone thinking you're a lush.

I like to use Welch's Sparkling White Grape juice instead of the champagne with orange juice.  Still has the sparkle without the alcohol.  Kids can enjoy as well.

We made this to go along with a breakfast for dinner themed night and it turned out perfectly! We served the juice 5-10 minutes before the rest was done. It was a big hit and I would recommend making it with your favorite juice, even if it's not orange juice.

Orange Juice always seems just alittle too bitter for my taste, so I tried Pinapple Juice. Can't hurt to try.
