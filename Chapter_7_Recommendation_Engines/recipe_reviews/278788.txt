This was surprisingly tasty for how easy and quick it was.  There isn't enough liquid in this to really call it a stew. Most of the liquid cooks off, so I recommend doubling the liquid if a stew is what you're looking for. I served this over white rice, as suggested and it reminded me a lot of deconstructed cabbage rolls! Perfect for a weeknight meal. The cook time is spot on.

Plain, simple, but good. I added a little seasoned salt, some garlic powder, and some leftover mushrooms. Shredded carrots might be good too. Probably works for Paleo and Keto.
