This is a great recipe, no doubt.  There are a few points that should be emphasized.

First, the instructions state that the mixture should be cooled before assembly.  This should be in capital letters.  There's something about letting the mixture set-up somewhat to reduce the amount of moisture...that thing that everyone is saying to avoid.  Excess moisture kills this dish.  I spun my spinach dry before chopping it and adding it to the pan, but go to great lenghts to introduce as little extra moisture as possible.  On the subject of spinach, I think the recipe implies the dirty bunch-spinach, not the pre-washed baby spinach.  I found I lost about 1/3 weight from the bunch spinach after discarding the undesirables and destemming.  Baby spinach is more expensive, but you can take it right out of the container, chop it and throw it in the pan.  If you use bunch spinach, account for the extra time it'll take you to clean and destem the stuff...huge PITA, but much cheaper.  Also, you can't go wrong with extra phyllo.  I wouldn't layer it in the middle, because it'll just be a doughy mess between the layers of filling. But to have eight sheets on the top AND bottom would not do you wrong.

Finally, I found this dish rocks coming out of the freezer and going right into the oven.  Prepare it the same just to the point it goes in the oven.  Take the whole frozen kit and caboodle right to the oven, add some extra cooking time (20-30 mins) and it turns out identical.

In a cooking class, many years ago, I learned the trick of dry spinach to be used in a recipe.  No need for pressing in a strainer. Just place the spinach on a plate, cover it with another plate (same side up).  Holding vertically, press the two plates together, over the sink, until liquid stops flowing.  Result = VERY dry spinach!  Using this method, I have never had a sogginess problem with this recipe.

I love spanakopita and have been making it forever.  I use frozen spinach (make sure to squeeze all the water out), use olive oil flavored cooking spray instead of brushing, omit the green onion, and occassionally use ricotta.  I am a fan of the traditional triangular shapes so i layer 2-3 sheets of fillo per triangle.  to keep dough from becoming a sticky or dried out mess, make sure its fully thawed before use, and properly covered while working.  plastic wrap and dishtowel does the trick.  the biggest problem i have with this recipe is: THERE ARE NEVER ANY LEFTOVERS!

This was a great recipe that I have used over and over again!  MY kids love it! I add more feta and triple the garlic so there is more flavor.  My mother used to make this all the time and she gave me a great hint...Pre cut it BEFORE you bake it for the phyllo won't crack and break nearly as much...just be gentle in the cutting for the phyllo is slippery!  Oh, and fresh parley is a must, do not used dried.  Wonderful served with Greek salad and pita bread with hummus!  Thanks, Silverwolf!

This was an excellent recipe. I used the same amount of filling for a 9 x 13 inch pan and it was well proportioned (I added a little extra feta). I would definitely suggest straining the spinach mixture before spreading over the phyllo dough. Excellent flavor!!!!!

I a huge fan of spanakopita and this recipe is definitely a good one. There are a couple of items to tweak for me though to make this a 5 star recipe. Two must have items for this recipe are fresh dill and freshly grated nutmeg (I use about 1/2 nut). The dill goes wonderfully with the spinach and green onions but the nutmeg is the key; it just adds a spark to all of the flavors and pulls everything together.

My other personal preferences are melted butter for the phyllo and I actually place phyllo on bottom, middle, and top like a lasagna. I use a 9 x 13 pan and generally use at least 10 sheets for each layer. I also bake covered in foil for first 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I then remove the foil and turn heat up to about 375 for another 10 minutes or so until phyllo lightly browns.

It really is a wonderful dish if you have never tried it and again, don't forget the dill and nutmeg...you won't be sorry!

I didn't particularly enjoy this, although it was my own fault.  I have never worked with fresh spinach before and did not remove the stems before putting it into the food processor.  The stems made it bitter and stringy.  REMOVE THE STEMS AND ONLY USE THE LEAVES and I'm sure you'll enjoy this much more than I did.  It looked great!

Very complete and user friendly recipie. I was a professional cook for 3 years at a 4 star restaurant, and know a user recipe. I made it last week, and it came out very tasty. I made it again today for a party, and this time using butter only, as the fat, i used 15 sheets of phyllo on the bottom then 1/2 the updated mixture, 10 sheets of phyllo, then the 2nd half of mixture, and topped with 15 more buttered sheets of phyllo. I used 4% cottage cheese (24 ounces) instead of ricotta, 24oz of crumbled feta, 5 cloves of fresh garlic, and 3 boxes of frozen spinach, 1 red onion diced, 2 eggs, 1/2 lemon juiced. This will make 15 servings, for it is 4" high before baking. I used the method written in a review of squeezing the spinach between 2 plates to remove the liquid and it worked better than any other method I tried as a professional. Cheers

great recipe....very tasty filling
next time though, i wouldn't make as much filling
it was too much stuffing, not enough dough
use more phyllo, like 7 sheets
also, it was very soggy
i think i should've drained the filling before putting it in the pan to bake

I just got done eating this for dinner, and it was wonderful!  All the other review information on the proper way to cook spinach was too intimidating, so I just used frozen spinach and it was still awesome.  We have decided to put in two extra layers of dough next time (in the middle) because we really like it with more dough, but this recipe was overall great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ok, since I am almost dead anyway, I am going to give you all my secret family trick to spanikopita, baklava, and anything with filo dough.  
Before putting in the oven
Cut the top into squares
Take 1/2 cup olive oil in a saucepan and heat until it is just starting to smoke white, before it burns black,  pull off of fire.
Pour it on top of the layers of filo dough, so it crisps.
This will prevent any soggy filo dough. (which is the only major complaint I see, otherwise this is a perfect Greek recipe).
Then cook in the oven for the 40 or so minutes.

I really enjoyed making and eating this recipe!!! It was fun to make. I have some Greek friends and I asked them about this recipe and they said it was great but they recommended that I omit the ricotta cheese and add more feta. I did that and it turned out to be perfect. I did use frozen spanich and I drained it well in advance by putting it in a strainer and pressing down on it with a plate and that made a huge difference. Thanks for that suggestion from the reviews!! One thing that I did that was not mentioned in the recipe was to layer the spanakopita with a mixture of butter and oil(with more melted butter then oil in the mix). Also when layering the phyllo dough it is very very important to smooth and flaten it as much as possible, espically the top layer because it wont puff up when u are baking it. I also put the spanakopita in the frigde after i was done layering it and before i baked it so that that butter/oil mix would solidfy and then it was so much easier to cut into squares. and doing this also helps the spanakopita to bake much better on the top. I also found covering the phyllo with a damp cloth helped while i was working with it so that it was not to dry.

My family has been making this for years as we are Greek. I am first generation here in the U.S., this is very close to how its made on the island Crete except there is no ricotta cheese in it and either dill or mint is added. Most people add mint and there is no garlic in it and melted butter is used on the phyllo dough instead of olive oil, although the olive oil is a healthier option. And also when the spinach and onions are cooked put it in a strainer and press the water out with a spoon until mixture is dry. No need to let it cool. And when you take it out of the oven cover it with a damp cloth while it cools for a little bit to prevent top dough from drying out and crumbling. My mom experimented and added some plain flavored cream cheese to the feta cheese and eggs and it came out delicious. Everyone always raves about it. I make this same recipe all the time and my grown children also make this recipe for their family and friends.

You need to add lemon juice to the spinach mixture. The eggs aren't necessary, by the way. Strained yogurt works just as well. Again, I'm somewhat confused by the lack of lemon juice, and especially fresh dill weed in this recipe. I worked in a Greek restaurant and there was hardly ever a savory (but non-meat-based) recipe that went without the two together. They would make delicious additions to this basic recipe, as the lemon counteracts the slight chemical flavor of the spinach, and the dill is an excellent mate for the tart/creamy feta.

This recipe was well received from my family (my kids couldn't get enough). I followed it as written with the exception that I used frozen spinach instead. After I thawed it out, I tried squeezing the spinach between two plates as suggested by Selea, but it didn't seem to do a good job (it probably works best with fresh spinach only). Here's what I did instead: I squeezed the excess water out by hand and sauteed the spinach in a bit of olive oil until the moisture was evaporated (about 5 minutes). Then I transfered it to a bowl to cool, sauteed the rest of the ingredients, added it to the spinach, and seasoned with salt and pepper. I proceeded with the rest of the recipe. A few other tips to avoid sogginess are 1) If there is excess liquid in the ricotta, then drain it off. 2) When brushing the phyllo dough, do NOT drench it in oil (or melted butter)! Brush only enough to give it flavour. I read this in a review of a popular Baklava recipe also found on this site. And one last tip: Let pie cool 10-15 minutes, to get more flavour out of the dish (Greeks traditionally let their meals cool to room temp to enjoy the full taste of a dish). This is a wonderful and elegant dish to wow your guests. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Silverwolf!

Good recipe, just am SO used to having fresh DILL in the recipe the way my Mom makes it! The dill gives the spinach pie a very fresh and great smelling scent to it, as well as the added taste. Definitely try it with dill. Use about 1/2 a bunch per large pan, or 1/4 bunch per 9X9 pan. I would also omit the parsley if you use the dill. 

Another change I would definitely make is omit the ricotta cheese and find yourself some Bulgarian Feta Cheese. The real Greek supermarkets have this and is SOOOO much better for spinach pie than domesticated feta. The imported Greek feta is just too expensive, and kind of gets lost in al that spinach. 

Another small change is omit the garlic, and add a couple of leaves of dried mint, crumpled throughout the mixture. I know it is unusual, but trust me, it does something to the mixture that gives it "air". 

And of course, as suggested by several, DRY the spinach out! The number one thing that ruins this dish for most is excess moisture! Also, when you brush the phyllo with olive oil, brush JUST enough to each layer to allow for browning of the phyllo. Too much gets oily, and none at all makes for other issues. Spread the oil best you can without drowning it. 

Do not be afraid to use frozen spinach... works just as fine with less work! Just make sure and get "chopped" spinach not "leaf" spinach. 

You'll know the dish is ready when you lift any corner and notice that it all comes up together without being soggy. Should be nice and crispy.

This was fabulous! I modified it for personal taste, but the recipe as written would be great on its own. I used fresh baby spinach. I omitted the fresh parsley, and realized after I started making this that I didn't have fresh garlic, so for the spinach and onions, I sauteed them in the oil, then added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp fresh dill, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the mixture. I like mine a little creamier, so I used the eggs, 1 cup of ricotta, 2 cups of feta, and 8 oz full fat cream cheese for the filing. I also used 16 sheets phyllo dough (8 on the bottom, 8 on the top) and brushed the dough with melted butter instead of oil. It's more fattening this way, but so good. I live near Greektown, and this is better than what I get in the restaurants. My non-vegetarian fiance loved it, as well.

The recipe is easy, and I would have given 5 stars on the quickness, however the only time- consuming part is preparing the fresh spinach.  It is very necessary to the tase to remove the stems so it does not turn out bitter.  Other than that, it is a quick recipe.  I made it for my husband's friends, and they LOVED it. One liked it so much, he offered to pay me to make a batch for him to take to his football party the following weekend!

I love this recipe - it makes uniformly good spanakopita every time. I've varied the recipe depending on what's on hand, substituting cottage cheese for ricotta and using oregano, basil, nutmeg, red pepper. Sometimes I like adding sliced mushrooms too. After a friend explained filo can be forgiving - don't butter/oil every sheet, just every few sheets and don't have to be exact for number of sheets, just be quick working with it before it dries out- I've been comfortable working with it.

very good!  my boss in a restaurant i used to work in would make these little phyllo dough triangles filled with spinach and feta for wedding receptions we'd be hired to do.  He would let the filling "rest" and squeeze out access liquid before baking these.  We would also use a brush and brush with oil to help these brown up.  Yum!

Excellent.  i layered 6 sheets of phyllo on the bottom, then half the spinach mixture, 3 sheets of phyllo, and topped it off with 6 sheets.  I also cut it into pieces before baking it, since if you cut it after baking the phyllo sheets start to crumble.

I've been making this for years and I keep forgetting to rate it.  I usually don't change up a recipe in a review, but after making it for so long, I thought that I would tell people that I double the phyllo, use frozen spinach (about 5 boxes), leave out the parsley, skip the green onion, use more feta, and use cottage cheese in place of ricotta.  I usually put a layer of phyllo in between the spinach mixture.  I also add a tad of nutmeg and sometimes dill.  This recipe is very versatile and can be adjusted to so many tastes.  Thank you so much to SILVERWOLF for submitting a recipe our family has enjoyed for a long time.

I used two 10 oz boxes of frozen spinach, dried the heck out of it as suggested, some extra garlic, salt and pepper, 8 layers of phyllo on top and bottom with butter instead of olive oil and OMG it was delicious!!! My bf loved it and took tons to work for a long weekend. Thank you Silverwolf and everyone for sharing their wonderful tips!

VERY very nice.  As others have noted, it is an authentic and tasty version of this classic dish.   We note: 1. It is very helpful to drain the spinach mixture (in a collander) to cut down on the soupiness of the dish; 2. it is probably good to use a larger pan (9X12) to make a thinner layer of spinach mixture; 3. And it is a VERY good idea to use much more phyllo dough.  As it is, this is a thick (2") layer of spinach/cheese with very thin pastry, and can certainly benefit from more layers; 4. It may be worthwhile (although we haven't tried it) to intersperse the phyllo dough and spinach mixture layers, lasagna-style, to get more of a pastry and less of a pie quality; 5. We would also suggest a much thicker bottom layer (maybe more like 8 sheets) to give more of a base to the dish;  6. it is worth using quality olive oil, as the taste of the oil comes through quite well; and 7. The dish could benefit from a bit more spiciness and flavor.  We tried a feta that had sundried tomatoes and basil, but still wished for a bit more "zing."  Nutmeg?  Maybe a bit of crushed chili pepper?   VERY nice dish, and much appreciated the recipes and others' suggestions.

Delicious! Takes a little time and effort because of all the phyllo layers.  I added a middle layer of phyllo and split the spinach mixture into two layers.  I used a 9 x 13 inch pan.

5 stars for the recipe, no stars for the stated prep time! My gosh, just made this (for the third time) the other day, and once again, this took me over 2 hours to make, not to mention the cleanup! No doubt about it: this recipe is the real deal, one of the best I've found on the web, and it's a serious dish! I followed the suggestions from others, most especially from StewartFip, in regards to cooling the mixture before assembling! No kidding - and that part (directions, part 2) should be in caps! Other than that, I mixed in some melted butter with the olive oil, while brushing the phyllo dough - figuring the extra calories wouldn't matter, in the long run! Thanks for sharing!

My husband said I can make this again and that is saying a lot about a recipe. I used 3 boxes of frozen spinach and will probably use the whole 8 oz block of feta next time too. I used 12 sheets of phyllo in an 8x8 pan. Next time I will be using my 9x13 pan and doubling the stuffing ingredients. Working with the phyllo dough really takes 4 hands. Once I had my husband covering and uncovering the phyllo (had covered with damp towel so they didn't dry out) the phyllo removal went much faster. Also, found it easier to brush and stack the dough and then place the stack in the pan, rather than doing it a sheet at a time. By doing that I didn't have as much tearing and the layers still came out nice and crisp. Will be adding this to my recipe box!

This was fantastical!! I made a few very minor changes. I added about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and a bit of salt to the filling mixture. I also sauteed the onions in butter instead of oil, and I brushed melted butter between the layers of filo instead of oil.  I also used one full pack of filo pastry, which I think is about 16 sheets total. With those changes, the end result was magnificent. The pastry was nice and crispy, and the filling was nicely compacted inside and not wet or runny at all. It was positively delicious! My guests were raving!!! Thank you!

Stop reading and start cooking! This is a great recipe that even makes dealing with phyllo dough worth it. Cucumber salad with mint yogurt dressing is the perfect side dish.

Overall, this recipe was great. I personalized   it by adding some extra ricotta, lightly salted feta cheese and freshly grated black pepper. It was nice balance with all that spinach.    Do ensure that you squeeze out all the moisture from the spinach. Or else your pie will be a disaster.     Frozen spinach is best (green giant), use 4 boxes thawed out. Also, I used butter, to baste the phyllo leaves. Use olive oil to cook the onions and spinach. It worked really well, using one of the 8oz packet of phyllo. Spilt them into halves, one set for the bottom and the other for the top.

I loved this dish. I also tried a variant whereas I saute pine nuts in olive oil until they are golden brown. Then add chopped pieces of firm tofu, saute a bit, then add the onions, garlic, etc. Also leave the ricotta out. This is done to get protein without the fat, and nobody knows the difference. The nuts are nice complement to the spinach.

I too am a Detroiter who loves Greektown especially the spinach pie from Pegasus Tavern. I cooked this in a 9 x 13 pan. It was good but would have been better in my opinion with double the feta, more layers of filo on top and bottom, and the addition of some dill as suggested by others. Thanks for sharing.

Went over really well at a Greek-themed dinner party.  I made the following adjustments: 20 oz spinach, cooked and drained, 4 eggs, 2 C feta, 1 C ricotta, 18 sheets phyllo.  I used all 18 sheets, and sprayed them with cooking spray.    When I made it the first time, before the party, the crust along the side was thick, and leaked a little.  So, in a brilliant move, I laryered 9 sheets of phyllo into the pan, added the filling, then layered 9 more sheets on top.  Then I FLIPPED OVER the baking dish.  That way, I was able to fold over the top layers attractively.  Then I slid the package back into the baking dish.  It looked professionally done.

Love greek spanakopita. FROZEN spinach is a better value and saves a ton on time. More fresh herbs! I always add fresh DILL and MINT.  I make a bunch of  individual servings to freeze by rolling about 4tbsp of mixture in a single sheet if phyllo like a burrito log then spiral it.  This style looks really fancy and having them in the freezet is the perfect go-to for last minute dinner party or for the kids to throw in the oven for a healthy after school snack. Kali oreksi!

I had pretty good results from this recipe, and can see how a few modifications could make it even better. I used frozen chopped spinach to simplify things. The cooked spinach should be rung dry...I put it in a colander lined with paper towels, covered it with more paper towels and pressed as much water out as I could, then let it sit with a pot full of water on top of it while I prepared the phyllo. Before mixing it with other ingredients, I wrapped it in a couple of dry towels and squeezed out any remaining moisture. You definitely need more sheets of phyllo; I ended up using about ten layers on top and ten on bottom, and these I alternately sprayed with olive oil mist and butter flavored spray. It would have been better with more feta, so would double that up next time. Was good with hot sauce.

This was my first attempt at Spanakopita and it was very tasty! A few variations: I cooked the spinach separately and then squeezed out some of the moisture. Sauted the onion, garlic and parsley and then added the already wilted spinach to that mixture. I used 12 sheets of phyllo dough and melted butter. Next time I'll use more phyllo on the bottom layer; maybe an 8 bottom/6 top ratio. I also used a 9x13 pan. Three 10 ounce bags of spinach.

What a PITA to chop ALL of that fresh spinach, but it sure pays to use fresh - what a taste difference, texture, too. I know others substituted frozen, but I would not. Take the time to use the fresh spinach. This is a keeper. This takes longer than 30 min for prep.

I love this recipe! At Thanksgiving Dinner a relative of ours made "spinach pie." I went home and was determined to make it. I Googled it and found out this is a Greek dish. I looked in Allrecipes and found this particular one. I followed the directions to the tee, but it seemed something was missing, so my husband added some salt and Oh My Gosh! This dish came alive!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!! Plan to make it again later this week...P.S. even my 12 month old loved it!

I was so happy that this recipe used the Feta and the Ricotta cheese!  Next time, I'm going to make it double and use a bigger pan!

I decided to make this dish as I had a lot of fresh spinach I needed to consume. It wasn't the baby variety unfortunately so I spent an awful lot of time cleaning and de-stemming. However it was definitely worth the effort! My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. Modifications I made: I didn't have ricotta so I doubled the quantity of feta. I added seasoning to the egg / feta mixture as well as a generous sprinkle of nutmeg. I cooked the spinach separately to ensure all moisture was removed first and then I added this to the onions and garlic which I sweated in butter and seasoned with dill. All in all a great recipe.

I followed the directions precisely and it came out soupy. Definitely very important to squeeze the excess moisture out of the spinach!

Oh my god this was good. I doubled the garlic and added an extra half cup of feta cheese. This was fantastic. Can't wait to make it again.

I've been wanting to make spanakopita for a long time but unfortunately it didn't seem to catch any one's interest. And then.....there was that  dreaded S ingredient. I have at last graduated from the school of "Putting Everyone Else First" and my choices now hold some menu merit. Great flavours in the spinach cheese filling mix and the phyllo doughs texture and appearance. Thank you for sharing a great recipe SILVERWOLF.

This is one of the best spanakopitas I have ever had. I used frozen bags of spinach and it came out perfectly, just be sure to squeeze out all the water from it after it has thawed. I also made it into the triangle foldovers rather than in a pan. I cut the phyllo in 1/2 length-wise and made it 3 to 4 layers thick depending on if you like more dough. Cooked it until phyllo was flaky and golden brown. I'm making appetizer versions of this for thansgiving for my family this year and I'm planning on cutting the phyllo into 1/4's lenghtwise and only 2-3  layers thick.

This is much lighter and healthier than the recipe that I've been using for years and the taste was almost identical! The second time I made it, I added dill weed (from my old recipe) which made it taste identical - and it's now better for me.  I don't cook the spinach before assembling - and it doesn't change a thing (except save time).  It also eliminates the moisture factor.  I hope this helps!

YUM! I only gave this 4 stars because I made some changes: I used an 8x8 pan because that's all I had; I added 1.5-2 Tbs chopped fresh dill to the cheese/egg/spinach mix; I doubled the green onions/onion/garlic; I used 2 10 oz boxes of chopped frozen spinach (defrosted & well drained); I used about 1.5 cups of feta cheese. It was wonderful! I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for a great base recipe!

Ok...so I am surprised this got such positive feedback. I followed the recipe exactly what was called for. I wanted to impress my father, as he is from Crete. Unfortunately his recipe comes out much better. We both agreed that this needed more feta, 1-2 more boxes of frozen spinach, cottage cheese instead of ricotta, dill, and nutmeg. Then throw in a few sheets of phyllo in the middle and brush with oil and butter. It might just be a matter of what you get used to, but his pita is soooo yummy!

I altered this recipe slightly by using all feta and no ricotta, as well as adding dill. I used the drying technique suggested by squeezing the spinach between two plates and will do this again. Next time I will add more sheets of pyillo, especially on the bottom. 
Overall I really enjoyed this recipe.

Delicious and easy to make.  I used a tip from a chef, instead of brushing each fillo sheet I just sprayed it with canola oil cooking spray which cut down on the saturated fat.  I also recommend increasing the fillo to 10 sheets and cutting it prior to cooking it.

This was delicious!  I made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipes verbatim.  The second time I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and one chopped leek.  I served it with a tzatziki sauce (1 cucumber, 1 1/2 cups of greek yogurt, 2 tbls. dill, splash of vinegar, a tablespoon of olive oil, salt to taste, juice from a lemon slice.)  Excellent. Ill be making this again soon.

I got the thumb's up from a Greek co-worker! The only thing I change is when I lay down the first layer of phyllo, I would place it on a rack on top of a cookie sheet. That way the bottom can get crispy as well.
Great recipe though!

Never made this before or used phyllo dough, I even forgot the parsley but this turned out AMAZING the flavors are perfect! I used a 10oz bag of fresh spinach and butter on the phyllo dough instead of olive oil...it was gone in under 24 hours just between two people. Definitely making again, it was suprisingly easy

Excellent recipe. I didn't add the green onions. If you dont like garlic substitute with shallots. Whether you use fresh (cut the stems)or frozen spinach, draining the water is imperative for success. Drain using a sieve then place spinach in several layers of paper towel and press. Do this 2 or 3 times until spinach is damp and crumbles.

I used this recipe as a starting point for folded spanakopita triangles.  I increased the garlic to four cloves total and added 3/4 cup total of fresh herbs (dill and parsley).  The greens mixture was a sloppy, eggy mess.  There was far too much liquid in the fresh spinach.  The next time I make these, I will be sure to cook the spinach separately and drain it.    The mixture also needed a definite hit of pepper and salt.  It was too bland for my tastes.  I will use this recipe again, but only as a starting point.

I love this recipe...I asually use more sheets of the dough..just a personal preference...I've also made this using kale along with spinach...when I have a huge harvest of both from the garden..it's great way to add in some kale which my family isn't too fond of...they can't tell it's in there!

5 star after my changes. I used a 10 oz box of baby spinach, 9x12 pan, 1 egg, otherwise the same. It is difficult to work with phyllo dough unless you use an olive oil cooking spray.

So easy and delicious.  The best part is you don't need to be exact with the measurements of the filling, just use as much spinach and cheese and you have or like.

Despite cooking off every ounce of liquid and draining the cooked spinach, it was still soggy.  I used twelve sheets of phyllo and the filling was still too abundant-and I made a 9x13 pan.  And the filling wasn't that flavorful.  I tried it hot, warm, and cold and it just wasn't as good as I can get at any of the Mediterranean restaurants around town.

Turned out to be a huge treat.

I learned some valuable lessons with this recipe. If you're using a recipe be sure to read it and follow it, more or less.

If you're doubling the recipe that means twice as much of each ingredient. Not twice for some and four times for others.

There is such a thing as TOO much phyllo. (I was never going to use the leftover in the time recommended on the box so I added the extra to the top.) It's like I have a phyllo loaf with a nice spinach spread; still tasty, but too much phyllo.

All things considered, I thought the recipe easy to prepare with a nice finished product.

I’ll make this again.

This was excellent! Didn't change the recipe at all aside from using 4 packages of frozen spinach, low fat ricotta and adding 1/2 tsp salt. Loved it and will be making it often!

This was excellent.  I changed it a little bit, too.  First, make sure that you strain your spinach....even fresh has a lot of fluid in it and it will be mushy if you don't.  I used 3 T butter and 1 T olive oil when sauteeing to add some flavor.  I doubled the Feta (we love Feta) added an additional 1/4 C of Ricotta, a dash of garlic powder, 2 dashes of salt and some freshly ground pepper.  I, also, quadrupled the phyllo dough (we're a dough family).  My husband LOVED it.  He said that it tastes just like our Greek family makes (my extended family is Greek).

EXTREMELY disapointing! I was so looking forward to trying this only to discover that it was soooo... bland.My husband who loves spinach pie discribed it as "eating soggy grass"
As others suggested the quantities are all wrong.I plan to send in my revised recipe but for now if you plan to make this then do the following.Double the feta,garlic and green onions and use at least double the amount of filo pastry on top.Also i found that the pastry on the bottom was soggy.Im sure this comes from this fresh spinach retaining a lot of moisture.Next time i may try using frozen spinach and squeezing out the water before mixing with the cheese .Hope this is helpfull!

This was good, but not oh-my-god fantastic. I made it exactly as stated (but I did add extra garlic). Although tasty, it needed something. I suggest adding an extra cup of feta and a good squirt of fresh lemon. It lacked that 'brightness' that dances with the phyllo, onion and spinach.  It's a good basic recipe, a definite one to try.  Next time I'll add that extra feta and some lemon.

A big hit! Instead of phylo pastry I used puff pastry and made 8 portions from one rolled puff pastry dough. I sealed it with egg lightly brushed on the dough. Recipe made 32 portions.

What a hit!  Even the spinach-haters loved this and had seconds!  I used a few layers of pastry in the centre to break up the filling a bit.  The greek food lovers said this was a nice addition to the thick spinach filling.  Will make this one again!

I am not really a spinach fan, but I loved this.  I mean I absolutely loved this!  My family of six loved more than I did.  It was a little time comnsuming, but definetly worth it.

Came out great overall.  I also live in Southeastern Michigan, and just got some bad spinach pie (overcooked, dried out, probably re-heated) and was determined to make my own.  Next time I'd use olive oil spray on the phyllo dough as others have suggested, and bulk up the feta as well, and would season the filling with lemon pepper for some extra punch!

This is a great recipe. My only changes I make are add a dash of nutmeg to spinach mixture ( it adds amazing flavor) and I also use more feta and more phyllo dough. I also melt butter and brush it on every single sheet of phyllo after laying it down. It just makes the phyllo crispy with a great buttery flavor. This is a awesome base recipe that you can tweak to make your own

Turned out pretty good. But prepping the spinach took forever, maybe I did something wrong but this took me three hours to make. The parsley does not add anything. Not worth it for me.

To avoid soggy ...I butter each phyllo dough sheet (olive oil if you like) and I use lots of phyllo on the bottom, seven sheets..and then I bake those sheets.....let them cool then add your ingredients... prevents ever being soggy
Of course you will then layer the top and bake according to instructions...and its never soggy...Give it a try...you'll be surprised...
I also prior to cutting my spinach up put it in a small hole laundry bag and spin dry it on AIR in the dryer if I'm having a big party..

This was fantastic. I too would double the amount of phyllo and i'll make sure to minimize the liquid in the filling. For my first batch this was great!

This recipe is amazing and was a monster hit. Worked great as a dish for a party I threw also - there wasn't a scrap left of it! I up the amount of spinach, though, and put in a bit more salt.

Needs some salt for flavor if you didn't double the feta. Do an egg wash on top for better browning/crisp.

Once you get used to working with phyllo dough, this recipe is a piece of cake and DELICIOUS! DH and I loved it! We were surprised at how nice leftovers crisped back up the next day once added to the oven to reheat. Highly recommend you try this. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it. I'm glad there is no dill in this recipe because I think that makes a spinach pie taste weird. I increased the amount of both feta & ricotta because I really like cheese. :)

Used a 16 oz bag of frozen spinach - thawed and well drained.  Added salt to the final mix.  Used olive oil spray instead of butter or olive oil on the layers.  Added a few more layers to top and bottom and also added a middle layer.  Cooked for 45 minutes - took about three minutes at the very end to darken the top layer.  It turned out great!!!!!!

This recipe is a good base for a Spinach Pie. Its up to the individual to adjust the ingredients to taste.One TIP to avoid soggyness, is  to add some parboiled rice  to the mix you will never know is there it absorbs the liquids and it blends with the cheeses well and adds firmness to the whole thing.Simple Onion, Garlic, Mint,Salt, Pepper,Dill (option )Will do also .Great treat enjoy.OPA!

I made this yesterday and added some ground turkey to it. I put 6 phyllo sheets on the bottom of the pan and 6 phyllo sheets on top. Sprayed each sheet with olive oil and the top sheet with melted butter. I have to agree with people that it is quite bland, spices and salt are missing for sure.

This was good but I thought it was on the bland side.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta to lighten up (calories) the recipe.  I also added salt and pepper but the dish still needed more seasoning.

A wonderful, buttery tasting, rich recipe! The choice of feta seems to matter, as I've made it with 2 different kinds. The first was from feta purchased at our farmer's market and the second was from a commercially purchased cheese. The first one was the best, by far, being much richer and creamy. I used prewashed baby spinach and was very happy I did as it cut down some of the prep time. Like I said, I've made it twice and DH is requesting it as a weekly regular! Thanks for the great recipe, Silverwolf

If you are using the processed Feta - it will not contain the flavor of imported Feta you can get in bulk at some stores.  Depending on which you choose it varries greatly in the amount of sodium it contains.  See if the store will let you try a sample or 2!

This recipe turned out great! I made it for a recent dinner party. I had never made spanakopita before and this recipe made it very simple, but very delicious. The only difference I made was that I added a little more garlic to the recipe.

Sooooo delicious!  I used to go to a Greek Festival every summer that had the best Spanakopita, and this definitely matches it!  I used one box of frozen spinach instead of the fresh because it was cheaper and easier, I thawed it of course and squeezed it in cheesecloth to get all the water out, and then continued with the recipe.  I also made sure to let my ingredients cool before assembling the dish, as another reviewer suggested.  I used double the phyllo dough on both top and bottom, because I like a really crunchy crust.  This recipe makes a very thick (deep) dish, like 3-inch thick slices, so if you do not like it so thick maybe put it in a 9X13 pan instead, but I thought it was perfect.  Even my husband (who is a die-hard meat and potatoes guy) loved this and said it was very satisfying.  Great recipe!

I love Spanakopita and this dish sort of comes close to how it's supposed to be.  I think the big misstep here is using olive oil to brush the phyllo.  You definitely need butter.  I would use a half melted butter/half olive oil mixture.  The parsley is also unnecessary in my opinion.  Also, you definitely have to use whole milk ricotta and double the phyllo, especially at the bottom.

Overall good recipe but too much spinach not enough cheese and dough! I felt that way even though I made it with twice the amount of dough and cheese that it calls for. I also added more spice to the spinach mixture. I'll definitely make it again but with less spinach and at least 2 packs of feta cheese.

I use this recipe to make individual bite size versions of the spinach pie.  It was a HIT at the party and one of the few "more healthy" options on the table.

Made a few small changes.  Used only Feta cheese (no ricotta), 2 cups worth, and used 3 pkgs frozen spinach (Julia Child has great directions for preparing frozen for use in recipes that call for fresh).  Made this for a party and received several complements.  Will be making it again.  Great recipe!

I would get rid of the ricotta, more feta, use melted butter mixed with oil instead of straight olive oil, and add lemon and dill.   I did use 8 pcs of phyllo on each top and bottom...4 would not have been enough.   Skip this recipe and look for one more traditional.  This was lazy and terrible.

This is a great recipe, but to make things a little easier on myself I used frozen spinach.  I used about 3 1/2 10oz packages of frozen chopped spinach, just make sure you drain all of the water out of it.  I added a couple handfuls of pine nuts which was a nice addition.  After reading other reviews I cut this before baking which definitely prevented it from cracking so much.  Also, I put 8 sheets of phyllo on the top and the bottom, worked out perfect. the next time I make this though, I'll definitely add some more feta cheese, and maybe a little salt.  Otherwise delicious!

I use 1/2 of an onion and use one of those large plastic tubs of spinach. Definitely need to squeeze out the water! I also add a bit of dill and nutmeg to the spinach/egg mixture to add flavor. Very good and fun to make!

Very good... I made it twice. The 1st time it was too thick in the 9x9 dish. The 2nd time I used an 11x13. Much better!! Add more phyllo dough than the original recipe called for.

I only had about 8 cups of loose spinach (6 cups to a pound) so I made much less filling than the recipe calls for, which suits me fine.  Added a couple pinches of dill and salt, left out parsley since I didn't have any on hand.  Butter flavored spray was pretty handy to use on the phyllo.  I've never worked with phyllo and worried about the drying out, but when I covered it with a damp paper towel the dough got all sticky and gooey!  Maybe Florida air is humid enough to prevent that phenomenon. At any rate, the recipe is wonderful - thanks so much for adding it!

This was delicious!  I used 3 bunches of spinach, used 8 layers of the dough on bottom and top.  I took the other reviewers advice and added dill & nutmeg.  I probably added a little more seasonings also, and it came out VERY FLAVORFUL!  I had no problem with it being too moist.  I rang the spinach out really well.  And actually started out with only 2 bunches, decided I needed the third and just chopped that up and put it in dry.  It cooked just fine, I'm not sure you would even need to wilt in pan before the oven?  Anyhow, give this recipe a try, it's worth the time!

This was awesome. I'd never used phyllo dough before; OMG what a pain. But it was worth it; shared with some guests and they loved it too. I'm going to try it with Mozzarella cheese next; Yummy!

I loooved this recipe.  I made a couple of changes and my roomate who is from greece said its as good as his mothers (a huge compliment)... anyway..

i recommend using pre-washed spinach, about 2 bags should do it.  
I also found that the first time i made it i used a saltier  (local) feta and it tasted amazing.  The second time i used a packaged one and it wasnt as salty so i recommend adding a pinch (taste it first).  
I also recommend adding 1/3 -1/2 bunch of dill to the mix.  
lastly, I would use at LEAST 4 layers on the bottom and 4 on the top..
enjoy!

I love spinach so this recipe tasted good to me- just the way  it is. Used as side dish with meat. Very good. I used fresh spinach and I did cool the mixture in strainer to drain liquid before adding it to egg mixture. Great dish! as is.

This was phenomenal but I did change a few things. I replaced the ricotta with additional feta and reduced the parsley by half. I also added a dash of lemon juice and a tablespoon of fresh chopped dill.

This was my first time working with filo dough and I had no problem at all with this recipe.  As suggested, I used more sheets of filo dough, I doubled the cheese mixture, and I added a few dashes of extra spices (cayenne pepper, freshly ground black pepper, dill weed, and some salt).  soooooooo good!!!

Dill is extraordinarily important in this recipe.  I'd say go half and half of parsley and dill and you'll get the right blend.  Also, for those of you who prefer the triangles, cut the sheets into 3 long strips, and butter each strip with clarified butter before putting in a generous amount of the filling.  By folding like like a flag--grab a corner and go into the opposite corner, thus covering the filling and making the triangle--you'll be able to seal the filling into the triangle-shaped sheet of phyllo.  Also, for those of you who had the "soupy" result--drain the filling before adding the cheese.  The filling should not be drained after adding the cheese.  Also, I've made this recipe with just egg yolks, not whole eggs--this may aide in not getting that "soupy" result.

In general, however, this is a very good recipe!

My husband and I were delighted with this recipe. Spanakopita has been a favorite dish, for us, at a local Greek restaurant. This was my first attempt to recreate this treat.
  Rather than brush the filo with oil, I sprayed each sheet with oil, much easier and good for the calorie watcher. I used well washed - ready to eat BABY spinach so there wasn't excess moisture or thick stems.  I also would be tempted to be more generous with the feta.

I pressed frozen spinach through a sieve to get all of the water out and had no problem with the rest of the recipe.  I eventually began to rotate the phylo sheets by 90 degrees each time I put one down so that the dough would overlap on each side of the pan, making a better seal.  Topped with coarse kosher salt and it was perfect.

I loved this fresh alternative to the usual fare. My family voted for extra feta and ricotta cheeses. I might try it that way in the future but it was perfect (as is) for me.

This was very good, though a bit time consuming. But it was worth it. I will probably use more feta next time, and possibly no ricotta. It had a great flavor and kept well.

I love this recipe. The only complaint that I have is that I did not clean the spinach enough. 
I rinsed it 2 or 3 times and it was still gritty.  My husband liked it but said that it should
have been served as a side dish and not as the main.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use it again.

we followed great reviewer suggestions and substituted dill for about 1/3 of the parsley; cooled spinach mixture before adding it to ricotta/egg/cheese mixture; pressed water out of spinach mixture!! used more fillo dough than suggested in recipe (we used about 12-14 sheets); we added salt to the spinach mixture; turned out delicious!

I used frozen spinach and it came out amazing! Plus, I think using frozen spinach is better because you can squeeze out the water prior to putting it in the saucepan, which eliminates having to drain the mixture afterwards.

This was my first time making spanakopita...we've been eating it from a local supplier/baker to our natural food store, and have been loving it. I finally decided to make it and loved all of the reviews of this recipe. It was easy to make, and with some of the reviewer suggestions, it came out perfect!! I omitted the parsley, used a little dill and nutmeg, and was sure to squeeze out any excess moisture. My husband loved it. I will be making it again and again!! Thanks Silverwolf!

This was my first time making spanakopita, first time ever using phyllo dough actually. I was running low on spinach so I cut that in half, didn't use green onions, but added one diced tomato because I had it laying around. I also had some ground turkey in the fridge that needed to be used so I thought, "Hey, why not?"... Cooked the ground turkey and threw it into the cheese and spinach mixture... man was it great! Obviously not traditional spanakopita, but the ground turkey certainly made it more a meal. Happy cooking!

I served this as our "Meatless Monday" dinner last night. Not well-received by DH or DD, however, I will definitely make it again in a smaller proportion for myself! I used a 9x13 Pyrex dish, well oiled. I used 8 sheets of phyllo brushed with melted butter, then layered the filling, which were ingredients I had available: 2 sautéed Vidalia onions in 2T butter, some minced garlic, onion powder, black pepper and a pinch of nutmeg. I used an entire 15oz container of ricotta, 6oz of feta as well as a couple small handfuls of shredded parmesan. As I mixed the feta/ricotta/egg mixture, I kept in mind the "it was bland and tasteless" comments, so I also generously seasoned the cheese mixture with garlic/onion powders, black pepper, nutmeg and chives. I had to omit the parsley and green onion, which I didn't have. I used a tub of baby spinach (stems removed and coarsely chopped) and didn't wilt the spinach at all since it would wilt in the mixture while baking. Topped with 8 more phyllo sheets sprayed with butter-flavored Pam (I was in a hurry at this point). Baked for 35 minutes and it was perfect! I'll scale it down into an 8x8 dish next time for myself. Reheated a couple squares today for lunch and it was still delicious!

Prep time for me was way more than 30 mins.  Did add a bit more garlic and made up for the missing ricotta with more feta and a little cottage cheese.  Also used melted butter instead of the olive oil on the advice of different reviews. Thank You So Much for this recipe, Silverwolf!!

This is my favourite spanakopita recipe, it's delicious.  The only change I make is adding a bit of dried dill to the filling and maybe some extra feta.

This is such a great recipe.  I turned it into a main dish.  I'm definitely not Greek so sorry if my changes weren't according to Greek custom.  I browned a super lean pound of hamburger meat with one chopped yellow onion, about 1/2 tsp salt and two chopped cloves of garlic.  As I did this, I steamed some white rice in my rice cooker.  Once the meat and onion were browned, I added about 1.5 cups of the steamed rice to the meat and mixed them together.  I then set this aside.  I then went on to follow the recipe to a T until I got to the Phyllo part.  I turned it into a 9 X 13 casserole so the sheets are the exact size and it can hold the extra meat/rice mixture.  After layering four phyllo sheets on the bottom, I topped with meat/rice mixture and then spread the sheeese/spinach mixture evenly over the top of the meat/rice layer.  I then topped with the four phyllo sheets as called for which were again the exact size and it turned out to be a perfect size family casserole.  This might sound funny, but I purposely cut a few of my phyllo top sheets to get more crusty edges since they fit almost too perfectly.  I like a flakey top.  I baked the whole thing at 350 for 40 minutes and it was delicious.  No sides required.  I didn't even serve it with bread since it had rice in it and then the phyllow dough.  I cut it like a lasagna and it was beautiful.  I got 12 decent size pieced.   This one is a keeper.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe will become one of my favorites of all time, after I add my tweaks. I followed the advice of StewartFip; I layered the bottom as well and skipped layering the middle. I drained any excess moisture (this is essential). I used 1 package of dry baby spinach (1 pound or maybe a little less   is fine, 2 lbs is a lot) The end result could have been even better, so here's my 2 cents- I would have spent the time crisping up the bottom 8 layers in the oven prior to adding the filling. I would have used butter instead of olive oil to layer the phyllo (yes higher in fat but I don't like the taste of soggy olive oil soaked pastry.) This recipe was entirely lacking salt. Adding some parmesan cheese to the filling along with the feta would have been good, and added some salt. My local greek restaurant makes spanakopita casserole style too, I swear there is some kind of lemony element in it. Maybe next time I will add just the teeniest bit of lemon juice. You don't have to serve this right out of the oven, it was even better when we ate it the next morning as leftovers.

This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe almost exact.  The only thing I changed was I added salt and pepper, 1 extra clove of garlic and I used fresh spinach.  I did not find it soggy at all.  Terrific taste just the way the recipe is written.

This was good, but I made some adjustments.  First, no one mentioned the need for salt, so I added 1/2 tsp. (and 1/2 tsp. pepper, as another reviewer mentioned adding pepper).  I would use 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper next time - 2 lbs. is a lot of spinach, and you still have all those onions and 2 eggs!  I used lowfat ricotta and feta, and they had no effect on the mixture (I think I would use 1/2 cup more feta next time).  You have to give the spinach about 7-10 minutes to fully wilt, and spinning it in the salad spinner took away a lot of water, but it still wasn't enough.  I think I'll use 3 boxes frozen, and thaw it and wring it out with my hands next time before adding.  Believe it or not, the restaurants use the frozen spinach, and it still tastes great!  I used 6 sheets phyllo dough on the bottom, and 6 sheets on the top - that was perfect, and it held together nicely.  I think next time I will alternate how I lay the sheets in, so that you don't have one side of the pan have just a little overhang, while the other side has a lot of overhang.  I did top the final sheet with some olive oil, and that made it pretty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This wasn't as good as I expected it to be :(  It needs more cheese and more seasoning... I wanted to flavor it up a bit and added black pepper & dill based on what I saw for other spanakopita recipes, but I wanted to stay true to the original recipe so I didn't add that much, unfortunately.  It's not that it's BAD, it's just not special enough for the effort that was required

Made this for my daughter's birthday.  She loves the spinich pie from the local Greek restaurant so it was a good exucse to try this recipe.  I used fat free feta  (an attempt to cut out a few calories) and it was wonderful, just like at the restaurant.

This is a great recipe.  I changed a few things. I added one small package of spinach, and a cup of chopped broccoli. Instead of feta cheese I used Farmers cheese.  Gave it great flavor.

Not a favorite of mine but it could just be a matter of taste.  Just seemed like way to much spinach for me and my spinach was very dry yet it still came out very watery.

Thank you from the bottom of this detroit natives heart. Now living in New Orleans I can't find this one of my favorite dishes.   I used frozen spinach and drained it between the 2 plates with paper towel liners to soak up the water!!!  It was wonderful!!!

Turned out great I used a lot of the suggestions that others made for instance more layers of filo on the bottom and using fresh  parsley. I used baby spinach and frozen and it worked great.

This was okay. I added more spices, after I realized how few it had in it. Was not good as leftovers (soggy). Not sure I would make it again. Expensive and time consuming meal.

This was fantastic - my first time trying to make it and it came out great. I didn't have any ricotta so I used a little extra feta. Trying to dry spinach spinach without a spinner was a huge hastle, so i used the prewashed baby spinach it was fine, but a little more expensive. Towards the end it's a good idea to put thin strips of aluminum foil around the perimeter of the pan, just to cover the phyllo that sticks up at the pan walls, i've noticed they can can pretty burnt.

This is awesome.  We ate the whole thing in 15 minutes.  I will probably need to double this next time.  I used a 9 oz bag of pre-washed spinach, chopped, and it turned out great.  This would be great with a greek salad with olives.

restaurant quality no doubt, it was perfect and so rich and creamy, this recipie is a keeper.  I added only fetta cheese 1 and a half cup. I also thought walnuts would go with it as an option, a nice crunch to it. x  Thank you. x

Fantastic and easily adaptable!!! Thank you for this terrific base recipe. I switched it up a little to suit my taste- but come on peeps- that's what you're supposed to do! This is cooking- not baking. You don't have to follow every letter to the "t". Make it your own.   My version:  I used 2 -10 ounce packages of frozen spinach and 1 16 ounce package of frozen spinach. Drained in a squeezable colander (fantastic investment).   I used yogurt, parmesean, shredded mozzerella, a little bit ricotta, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper, nutmeg - all to taste... set aside...   Sauteed some red onion and garlic in olive oil and mixed in the drained spinach. Mixed that whole pot into the bowl of yogurt, etc. above.   Layered about 12 phyllo sheets in porcelain whiteware (9 X 3?) and brushed each sheet front and back with melted butter.... added my spinach mixture... layered another 8 sheets and buttered them... and added more spinach mixture and layered the top with about 10 phyllo sheets brushed with butter and sealed it up by tucking or folding sides around it.   In the oven at 350 for 35 min.  Fun!!

If you like spinach and feta cheese, then you will enjoy this recipe.  I used frozen spinach, I think I will use fresh next time. Not too difficult to make. Also, after starting to eat it, I found that lemon juice really helps the taste.  Try it!  Thanks for a good recipe.

this is one of my new fave foods! :):)  and what an excellent way to use up all the greens i get each week from my CSA share.  the only things i did different was used a little chard in addition to the spinach, and used 8 sheets of phyllo on the bottom and 6 on the top.  i also threw in a little bit of fresh basil and oregano.  it was PERFECT!  hubby and i ate it 3 breakfasts in a row and it was excellent reheated in the toaster oven.

Fantastic!!!! I used 2 packs frozen spinach and doubled the cheese and cut the sheets of phyllo into 3 strips each then spooned the filling in the end of each strip and folded into triangles.

This is good, but I added a lot more dough so that was good. Don't skimp!!!! Also I think this really needs some more seasonings in it and I would double the feta next time.

WOW!  Very good.  I cut out the ricotta cheese and used 2 cups of feta, I like cheese.  Also I used 6 sheets of phyllo on the bottom and 6 on the top.    This was the first vegetarian meal I have ever cooked and it got rave reviews by all!

When I visited Greece I didn't get a recipe!  Now I have one that is AUTHENTIC and DELISH!  I sauteed(sic) the onions, garlic and parsley but NOT the spinach and set it aside...then I sauteed(sic) the spinach, very lightly,... the dish has to bake yet, don't want to overcook anything as delicate as spinach... and wrung it out in a clean dishtowel before adding it to the onions etc.  made for a dish that had stability and was not wet.  Oh,  I added an extra 8 oz. of feta.  son- of-a-gun good dish...even reheated...in the oven...not the microwave. This one's a keeper!

If you're going to save leftovers, make sure it is 100% completely cool all the way through before wrapping it up or else it will get soggy in the fridge.  Reheat in a toaster oven.  This is one of my favorite dishes.

There's a Greek diner near my house, and every now and then, I'm lucky enough to go in when they have Spanakopita on the specials board (it's not on the menu).  My boyfriend hates spinach, but I was so hungry for Spanakopita, I decided that I didn't care and made this recipe anyway.  It would have been worth it for me if this had tasted nearly as good as what I get at the diner.  It didn't even come close.  The filling wasn't as good and the dough was much too thin.  I'm not sure what would make the filling better, but I'd definitely double up on the dough on top and bottom if I made it again.  I'm rating this on my own taste alone, not my boyfriend's, as I knew he wouldn't like it to begin with.  I'll look for a different recipe next time.

The recipe is easily five stars if you add fresh dill (after cooking the spinach mixture) and lemon juice to the mix. I also used half fresh spinach and half swiss chard. It had a really subtle but fascinating flavor. Wasn't too "greens" tasting either.  Also, as other reviewers stated, I would fret more about straining the spinach/greens mix than working with the philo dough. No matter how you manage to place the philo dough, it's still delicious if you brush it with olive oil and bake!

This was really fabulous! I made this for 110 people the very first time I made it (last week) and all I can say is BRAVO!! This recipe turns out *perfectly*, and even after the first fight with the phyllo dough (separating those little buggers), all went well and I had absolutely ZERO left. I paired it with fresh oven baked Atlantic salmon, fresh baked bread, and a fresh tomato/cucumber salad. This meal was a hit with all of the senior citizens I cook for, as well as the staff! Thanks for sharing this delish recipe...I can't wait to make it for my boyfriend who is going to LOVE it. :)

Excellent recipe!  I omitted the cottage cheese because I didn't have it, and I used frozen spinach (dried it out extremely well first and let it set up as directed) and this still was delicious.....I am certain the recipe as posted is probably even better!!

This was very good.  I thought the spinach would be a little thick, so I put only half the spinach mixture on top the 4 layers of filo, then added an add'l 4 layers of filo, then the remaining spinach mixture, topped off with 4 layers of filo.  I couldn't tell there was filo in the middle though.  I will make this again.  Very tasty!

I enjoyed this recipe- I used two packages of frozen spinach, well thawed and squeezed instead of the fresh stuff. I also used 8 sheets of phyllo on the bottom, and 3 on top, because there was so much overlap from the bottom. I may try it in a bigger pan next time. I would perhaps use a bit more feta and add some ground pepper as well. Like another reviewer, I made it and froze it, baking and eating it another day. Baking it for 1hr was perfect.

I made the filling the same but made appetizer triangles.  Brush on olive oil and fold fillo then add about 1 -2 tablespoons of filling.  Fold until you make a triangle or cut into triangles with pizza cutter.

I like this recipe but I gave it only 3 stars because I think the flavor needs a few kicks.  I agree with a previous reviewer that 2-3 TB of lemon juice will do the trick.  I also agree that it needs more garlic and feta because otherwise the flavor is bland.  It smells great when you're preparing it.  By the way, it took me much longer than 30 min to prep--almost an hour.  The phyllo can be really fussy to work with.  I used PAM spray and that worked great :)

This was pretty good, but it was too much spinach.  I used a 10 oz bag of spinach (which was already way less then called for).  Based on previous reviewers comments, I used 2 T of olive oil (vs. 3) to cook onions/spinach to keep it from becoming too wet.  I used melted better instead of olive oil on the phyllo dough, and laid it out in a 9 by 13 pan.  It took about 5 oz of dough, could go with 8 oz if you like the bottom and top thicker.  Alternate the phyllo to make it overlap the pan.  Making this way it turned out to be about 12 good size pieces.  Next time, I'll double the feta cheese, ricotta, egg mixture and add more garlic.  With these changes, I think this will become a 5 star recipe.

YUMMO! To make this more "appetizer" like, I made this into a strudel by spreading the filling along one end of the layers of phyllo and then rolling. I tucked in the ends and scored the top before baking. Wow, this was so much easier than making the triangles I normally do for parties which ends up being incredibly time consuming. Thanks so much Silverwolf!

this was a good start but for next time i would would make some adjustments. i followed other reviews and used more garlic (5 cloves) and half as much spinach and seasoned with salt and pepper. though it was still too much spinach and not flavourfull enough. i will try it again to suit my taste more. the next time i'll use even more garlic, the full bunch of green onions (i only used 2 stalks this time) for more flavour, and only 1/2 pound spinach.  and i would use more phyllo sheets.

I made this for a party the day after Thanksgiving.  I did use a slightly larger (throw away) pan.  However, wanting a thicker pie, I used extra spinach, parsley, onions, feta and lots more phyllo as I like it high and crunchy.  For phyllo I alternated each sheet with smart balance and Pam spray instead of olive oil.  Everyone really enjoyed it!!  Thanks for a great basic spinach pie recipe, Silverwolf.

I fold these into appetizers (like little paper footballs). Always a big hit with the guests who can't believe I made these myself. They freeze well for months!

My recipe came out perfect. I want to tell you exactly what i did so yours can come out just the same! I had a friend coming over is is vegetarian and I wanted to do something more fun than the classic mac n cheese (can you tell I don't cook vegetarian much?! hehe) ...

I forgot the parsley...oops! who cares! it didnt need it, wasn't missed at all. 

I used 5 cloves of garlic. this does NOT give a garlic-y flavor, it just boosts the flavor in general. 

important: When i was sautéing the the onions, green onion, and garlic, I seasoned with salt and pepper. I would say probably a tsp of salt and half a tsp of pepper. use your judgement. dont trust a recipe that doesn't call for seasoning!! lol. 

I used a little under 2 pounds of spinach (30 ounces) and it was nice and rich, i liked it that way. I wouldnt use less. Use baby spinach, you won't have to de stem and the taste is not bitter.

When done sautéing the spinach mixture, I transferred it to a colander. I LET IT COOL COMPLETELY. Out of fear of moisture from other reviews, I simply squeezed the spinach A LOT when it wasn't too hot to touch. I squeezed until I felt like I got a significant portion of the water out. I would recommend this. My pie wasn't soggy at all. 

Once I combined the spinach mixture with the ricotta mixture, I seasoned a final time with salt and pepper. Maybe 1/2 tsp salt and a 1/2 tsp pepper. give or take. 

I did 7 layers of filo dough on the bottom and on top. --it was my first time cooking with it,

Wonderful spinach pie!! I altered the recipe as follows:  added  a few sliced carrots to the spinach mixtures, plus pepper & some cinnamon.  I used 16 sheets of phyllo, not 8.  Instead of regular olive oil. I used  a whole fruit lemon infused oil....that added a lovely aspect.

Love this, and easily made it vegan, too.
I used a 9x13 pan, my mistake, but it was still amazing :)
I did add the juice of a lemon (about 3 tablespoons) and a generous teaspoon of dried dill. I'm sure it  would have been delicious w/o, though!

I used cleaned & boxed baby spinach. I did the recipe exactly as instructed.   DRAIN THE SPINACH AFTER COOKING. Dish way better next day.

This was pretty good. The filling is off though - I pressed the water out of the spinach but not enough - I will work harder on it next time. It was missing something - dill or maybe a little mint...lemon zest - it needs to be perked up. Oh and definitely salt/pepper.

As another reviewer or two have mentioned CHILL the spinach mixture in the fridge before assembling it with the phyllo for baking. This is a wonderful recipe -- and very close to the classic -- and well worth the effort.

This was a creamy spinach pie with a crisp factor from the phyllo dough. A few more sheets were added than the original recipe specified to get more crust. A very important thing to note is that you must press the excess water out of the spinach mixture before it is mixed with the cheese. Failure to do so will result in soggy dough. I seasoned my cheese and spinach mixture as well. These were interesting flavors.

You can use frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh. Let it thaw completely and squeeze the excess water out by hand. Makes a big difference. I've never needed to chill mixture prior to set up in the pan. Just my two cents. :)

Absolutely fantastic! This tasted better than any spanakopita I had in a restaturant.
 I didn't have as much spinach as was required, so I just used one package of fresh spinach and it was enough. I also didn't have parsley. No need it was great without it. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe the other day; it is wonderful and very easy. It does need to be seasoned up a little bit, so I added salt, pepper and a quarter teaspoon of mace but there is a huge variety of herbs you could add to this to edge it away from blandness. For a family of four, I found I could halve the amount of spinach with no detriment to the end result: the amount recommended in the recipe is great but my pan won't cope with it. I used "1 Cal Spray Olive Oil" to oil between the leaves of phyllo dough. Thanks so much for this, Silverwolf - it's a super recipe :-)

I've tried several spanikopita recipes, and this one was so far the best. What I really liked about this recipe is the instruction to ONLY cook the spinach for 2 minutes or until wilted. That is a key step (don't overcook the spinach mix because it changes the flavor and releases too much water). The other important thing I would add is to drain the spinach mixture (after cooked) in a fine mesh strainer to drain the excess liquid. Make sure it is completely cooled before adding the cheese. I would also HIGHLY recommend adding 1/4 cup of chopped fresh dill, which really adds flavor to the recipe. The only other modification I made was that I used a parmesan/asiago cheese mix instead of the ricotta - this substitution added more flavor. Overall, this was a great recipe and definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe, but I would like to add a couple smart cooking suggestions..... don't forget salt and pepper!!!! salt the onions while you caramelize them. And I also use whole wheat fillo dough to give it a little healthier side. You can't taste the difference and it makes me feel better.

very, very good! I used frozen spinach, (making sure to drain it/squeeze it very well) and it worked out great. I also substituted the ricotta cheese for cottage cheese because I couldn't find ricotta in our tiny little grocery shop (but they had phyllo?!) and didn't have time to make my own. All in all, it was really good though I will add more phyllo next time!

This was my first time making spinach pie. It turned out really well. I used the bagged, washed,bagged spinach and it worked perfectly, held it's shape and wasnt too wet. My only complaint is that it was a bit bland. If I use this recipe again, i would use more feta and salt.

This is one of my FAVORITE recipies! My sister has requested this recipie for her birthday dinner the last 2, 3 years in a row. I decided to give it a whirl for her one year and it's just been insanely addictive! My husband (who isn't a huge fan of spinach) has even requested me to make this for him as well. :)

It's VERY simple to follow and the ingredients are simple as well. I have found that the pie form is much easier than the individual triangles so this recipie is just all around easy.

I found it also takes a bit longer to prepare...but that's just depending on how pretty you want to make it.

I added 2 extra eggs and more cheese because I wanted to make enough for a 13 x 9 pan. I used extra fillo dough too. We made this for my Greek father-in-law, and he absolutely loved it! It was excellent. Thanks for the great recipe!! This will be made again in our house:)

I've made this several times. First time I only had 1 pound of spinach. I didn't have any ricotta cheese so I used cottage cheese. Used butter between layers of phyllo dough. Used extra feta. I have made it this way each time now. We love it.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night and it turned out incredible!  It was my first time ever working with phyllo pastry and so I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn’t as hard to work with as I had imagined.  I added diced chicken breast & sliced red bell peppers to mine which I will defiantly add again.  The only thing I would change next time is making it a lot thinner; maybe a bit thicker than a tortilla.  Thanks so much for the yummy, healthy recipe!  I can’t wait to make it again ?

It tasted ok, but nothing special, I would have used less spinich and added other veggies, such as carrots peppers, broccili, olives maybe. Overall, it was to much spinich taste, not much else.

Perfectly good, but not as wonderful as I expected.  Needed a touch of salt (even with the feta), and not sure what else.

We really enjoyed this.  I added some mint because I had it on hand and my favorite Greek restaurant uses mint in their spanakopita.  I made it in a pie with 9 sheets on the bottom and 10 sheets on top and it came out well.  I just didn't have the time to make all of the triangles.  I used 3 boxes of frozen spinach because i didn't have time to wash fresh spinach.  Next time I might add more dill and some garlic for a little extra flavor.

I've made this a few times now, and it's always well received. I use a few more sheets of phyllo Since I just can't do it t like the recipe explains. I just put sheets of phyllo in the pan, put in the spinach mixture, fold over the ends and add more phyllo sheets on top so it's all covered.

This was great. Made a few revisions - added another clove of garlic, ommitted the parsley but added some mushrooms and about a fourth of a red peppper. I also added a tablespoon of asiago cheese and a pinch of basil and nutmeg. Also it needed a lot of seasoning with salt and pepper. I did use quite a few layers of phyllo dough on the bottom and then on the top but it really didn't seem necessary as the flavor was so good by itself. I think I will try putting this filling in little prepared phyllo cups and serve as appetizers.

My variation on this, loved by my Greek boyfriend: Instead of fresh spinach I use 2 packs (a 450 gr) of good quality frozen whole leaf spinach, extremely well drained after defreezing. One big Onion, 4 springonions, 3 cloves of garlic, some chopped up sun-dried tomatoes, and a bunch of parsley lightly browned in some oliveoil. Four eggs mixed with 1/2 cup (125 ml) cream and 225 grams of soft white goat cheese. Everything mixed and corrected for (quite a lot of) salt and pepper. For the bottom I use 4 leaves of puff pastry, and a fifth one cut up for the top. I bake it around 50 minutes on 175 degrees C.

Easy to make, and tasted good. My teenage guest went for second helpings. I'll definitely make it again, but I'll add more phyllo layers as others suggested.

I wanted to like this, but it was way to bland. I am Greek and have had lots of different spinach pies and this one doesn't cut it, sorry! It needed spices, salt and pepper, more feta, and rice. I did add rice to mine and that gave it more texture. Also, I used a larger pan and it was still plenty thick. If I would have used the pan it called for it would have been way too thick.

This was awesome.  I made it without the phyllo dough simply because I couldn't find it. I shared it with a Greek friend of my mine and was given a "stamp of approval."  So I'm sure the dough version is excellent - but now that I've discovered the low-carb version and love it - think I stick with that one.  Enjoy.

My girlfriend and I have made this twice now (and intend to repeat it tonight), and we absolutely love it.   One recommendation I would add, and forgive me if someone else has said this already, is to prepare a side sauce of sour cream with fresh dill and a bit of salt.  Tzatziki would also work, I assume.  Thanks Silverwolf!

I really liked this, but thought it was slightly bland. Next time, I'll use this recipe again, but go through everyone's reviews to pick up on tips on how to make it more savoury.  I used frozen spinach and looked everywhere to find a good and easy way to dry it out; I tried the plate over plate and broke a plate; and I tried squeezing with my hands but didn't do a great job.   So, instead, I put the frozen spinach into my strainer and then put the strainer into a big mixing bowl. I then put it into the microwave and warmed it up for 10 minutes on medium; a lot of the water drained itself and finally, I used a potato masher to press out the remaining water. It worked really well and found it was the least soggy of my attempts.

Oh, my, goodness!  This is now in my top five top recipes ever!  So tasty, even when I used low-fat ricotta, fat-free feta, egg whites, and way less oil than called for.  So healthy, and so good!

Delicious! This tasted much better than the frozen spanakopita appetizers I bought! I used this recipe for the filling, but rolled the filling up in phyllo triangles. Make sure to remember to let the filling cool before wrapping it up. I used pam spray between the layers of my phyllo instead of butter- it made things go a lot faster, but didn't taste as good as butter would have.

I used this recipe as the base for my spanakopita, but grafted on some of a different one.  I added 1/2 cup green(spring)onion and a medium leek(cleaned and chopped)to the white onion in the recipe.  Instead of making one big pie, I made individual ones by using (at least)3 layers of phyllo(each one brushed lightly with a mix of butter and olive oil)and wrapping them into a triangle.  It's a great dish, and a good way to get veggies into the kids!

Great!  I made a few changes.  I used lots more phyllo because I like the crunch.  I used frozen spinach, added fresh dill and salt, and used butter instead of olive oil.  My friend recommended that you can freeze uncooked and it keeps well.  Will be making again.

I would add some salt and pepper to the spinach mixture and also be sure and squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible to avoid sogginess.

I loved this. I live in London now, but I miss Detroit's Greektown and this brought it all back to me. 
The other reviewers were very helpful in explaining the preparation. Tasted very authentic and the fillo pastry wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought to use. I did add extra sheets as suggested - brilliant!

I added a little more feta and doubled the garlic.  Cooked it in a 9x13 pan, and added extra phyllo.  It was great, but, unlike the other reviewers, I would have preferred more filling and less dough.  Next time I will put it in a smaller pan with a just a couple of extra sheets of phyllo.  I really enjoyed the mild flavor of the spinach and cheese.

This was okay, but nothing spectacular. I don't think I'll make it again.

Loved It!  Used two 10oz frozen spinach packages and added in some dill as others suggested.  I used double ricotta, garlic, green onions.  Definitely needed more layers of phyllo dough.  Great basic recipe that's easily adaptable to your taste--

I added a third egg for texture, black pepper, doubled the feta and tripled the garlic and added dill. It came our perfectly delicious, BUT Next time I will not add any dill. I left many crinkles and inperfections in the dough and it made it just wonderful. This will be made in my home every two weeks for sure!

My boyfriend and I threw a Greek dinner party and chose this as the main dish.  Pretty sure the recipe calls for 2 lbs of bunch spinach, because we bought 2 lbs of the baby spinach in bags (six bags!) to cut down on chopping time and only ended up using about half the spinach we bought. And listen to the other reviewers-- drain it before you cook it! We also doubled the feta (2 4oz. packages) and added 4 or 5 sprigs of chopped fresh dill. Then we used 10 sheets phyllo on top and bottom, and we brushed the first five layers with olive oil and the second five layers with melted butter to help with browning.  The dish came out BEAUTIFULLY and tasted absolutely wonderful!  Will definitely be making this again.

This is delicious!  I used 2 boxes of frozen chopped spinach, defrosted them in the microwave and drained really really well and then added to the onion mixture.  I also doubled the amount of onion and garlic and added a little bit of dill and fresh ground nutmeg. I used approximately 8 sheets of phyllo on the top and bottom of the filling and brushed each layer with melted butter. Next time I'll definitely add more feta and a few shakes of crused red pepper.

great recipe - made small adjustments
healthier option - I didnt fry the ingredients - steam the spinach for about 3 min, rinse under cold water and squeeze all water out of spinach then mix all ingredients together without frying them - also add 1/4 cup uncooked rice, this helps to soak up all the juices while its being cooked

Great base recipe for sure. Adding some chopped fresh dill was essential. Other than that I thought it was great. A close friend who is Greek recommended not putting egg in, but I did. Overall, it was great and lovely authentic taste.

wonderful recipe. It was delicious. I followed the suggestions of the other reviews and added the dill. I also used one whole package of phyllo dough (about 30 sheets). Butter works much better to brush the dough with. I used less spinach and more cheese.

The second time i made this, i put the filling in phyllo cups (smalls cups of the phyllo dough, found next to the actual dough in the fridge). It turned out to be a wonderful appetizer.

This was excellent.  After reading the other reviews, I doubled the garlic, reduced the parsly and added some lemon juice and dill.   Also, I could not find phyllo dough at the store, so I used 4 sheets of puff pastry instead (2 for the bottom and 2 for the top). I thought it worked very well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

great spinach pie.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add more phylo sheets to the bottom and top of the pie. I would definately make this again.

I used 5 boxes of frozen spinach and added a teaspoon fresh dill. I used butter instead of olive oil to paint on the phyllo.  I will use Greek (sheep's milk) feta next time.  Based on other reviews I added 8 sheets phyllo to the bottom & same for the top; plus doubled the feta & a bit more ricotta.  I would salt & pepper the spinach & maybe add another clove of garlic.  This is definitely a keeper.  Cheers!

I made this the other night for my family and they all really enjoyed it.  I used 2 bunches of green onions and used more phyllo dough (8 oz).  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 inch pan.  I forgot the eggs and it still tasted good.  :)  My dad, who loves meat and always suggests I add meat to my meals, said it was good even without meat.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Used frozen spinach(thaw and squeze water out). Used more fetta, more garlic,
more phylo and added a few tablespoons of instant cream of wheat to take care of some of the moisture. My mother does this with her spinach pie and it is always great never soggy.

Sooo good! BF and I both went for thirds... ;) The recipe needs a few minor adjustments, though, mostly because the amount of spinach is way off. Next I'll use more of everything: more phyllo pastry, more feta and more garlic!

Nice recipie - it was hard for me to clean the spinach, and it was still a bit dirty.  Next time I will buy the spinach in a bag which is already cleaned.  The end result was quote nice and it freezes well. Thanks

Turned out perfectly.  I used 6 phyllo sheets on the bottom, 4 in the middle, and 6 to top it off.  I used butter to brush each sheet instead of olive oil to enhance flavor.  I also added a couple of dashes of ground red pepper and seasoned salt to the onion/garlic mixture while cooking.  Will make again!

i have made this about 5 or so times so far and it needs adjustments to not taste bland.

doubling the onions, garlic and cheeses (while not doubling the spinach) and adding some ground pepper and salt improves this dish greatly, it is really really good!. 

if you don't get prewashed spinach it will probably be soggy when you finish cooking the spinach...make sure you DRAIN it! that is very important, otherwise you get a soggy mess. also, remove the stems.

goes great with sour cream.

I never used phyllo dough before, so the only advice I have is that if you buy it frozen, then it will take 5 hours room temperature to thaw out or overnight in the fridge, so plan accordingly. Other than that very yummy.

This was pretty good. I would recommend more ricotta and maybe some lemon juice in the spinach for a touch more flavor.

Heavenly!!! This was SOOO easy and delicious! The only changes I made to the original recipie were..1: Using an earlier suggestion in a review, I laid the phyllo in alternating directions which really kept the stuffing in. 2: I laid a sheet of plastic between the damp towel ant the dough, to keep it from getting gummy. 3:I used a spray olive oil, I could work fast enough so that the towel and plastic are really not needed. 4: I did add 1/2T of celery salt, to counter the blandness of the riccota.

but all in all Outstanding recipie, we will be eating this for years!!

Loved it and so did my meat eating significant other!  I made it in a 9" x 13" pan.  The filo dough package had 20 sheets of filo so I used all those, in three layers, with 2 layers of filling.   I loved the extra yummy dough.  I also used a mixture of melted unsalted butter and olive oil to brush the layers.  Less healthy but more buttery goodness.

I made this while fasting during Ramadhan so I couldn’t taste for seasoning. I had to put my faith in the recipe and reviews. It was amazing! While making it, I thought I wouldn’t make it again because the process is tedious but the taste changed my mind! Here are my modifications: After onions are sauteed, add dill weed and nutmeg. Drain drain drain whenever you see liquid. Use 6 oz crumbled feta. Use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Add salt. Brush with butter instead of olive oil - 1 stick total. 8 sheets on the bottom, 4 sheets in the middle (cut in half), and 4 sheets on thentop (cut in half), in a 9 inch spring form pan. Baked at 350 for 50-55 minutes.

I made the spinach mixture and put it in puff pastry tarts and a puff pastry round with a cut out top (next to puffed pastry sheets in the frozen bread/crust section of  store). It was delish and a real time saver without missing any flavor or presentation. Working with puffed pastry can be challenging and time consuming, for me. This was a real treat for my family.

This was truly excellent. I started with three different recipes and sort of combined what I thought would be the best. Well, this was it, except that I made three complete layers,  like with lasagna, which was even better. I also added three garlic, which was key. My husband loved it too, two big helpings.

Made as directed using fresh spinach, took hints from others and drained the spinach before adding to phyllo dough. Used 8 layers instead of 4 because who doesn't love crispy phyllo! A family member shared with me it was better than the family recipe! Will make again, maybe add a little more feta.

I followed the directions exactly, and it was good. Here's what I'd try next time.

The 1/4 cup of olive oil wasn't quite enough to brush all of the phyllo sheets, so make sure you have plenty on hand. I thought it could have used more feta; the ricotta took away some of the tang. Next time, I'd add at least another 1/4 cup. Also, I'm generally not a big salt person, but it seemed like this could have used at least 1/2 tsp, if not a bit more.

The bottom layer of filo gets a bit soggy, so it might be worth it to bake the bottom layer first for  a few minutes before filling it and putting the top layer on. This way you will get a nice crispy shell. Otherwise, it is a delicious dish.

I loved it! It has a nice cheesy flavor with nothing that overwhelms the basic ingredients. Loved the 2 plate tip from previous review...worked like magic! The only substitutions I was forced to do were: 1. Use some fresh chopped spinach; 2. Used puff pastry instead of phyllo dough. I used a bottom, middle, and top layer. 1 sheet each. Just rolled it out to fit the casserole dish and topped it with an egg wash.

I have made this recipe about 10 times now. I add about 1tbs of lemon juice and zest. My husband says my pies are better than Greek restaurant. Yay! I also make weight watchers broccoli and egg strudel with fillo.

I did modify this recipe as the spinach to cheese ratio was way off.  I added at least 1 1/2 cup of cottage cheese and at least 2 cups of feta. Also 4 oz of cream cheese. I also omitted the whole onion and used a whole roll of fillo.  I felt it lacked spice, so added garlic salt, salt and alot of ground pepper.  It was really good.  It took approx 30 minutes to brown at 350.

Yum!  This came out so well.  The phyllo dough is totally finnicky, but who cares if the internal layers look perfect?  It looked great, it tasted great.  I brushed with butter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

we usually make it that way but substitute dill for the parsley. if you put the whole stuffing in a food processor, the feta gets distributed better, but that's not really necessary. I sometimes add a lettuce in with the spinach but that's just me, the recipe is great without it

I did add more dough (1 sheet) to the bottom and top layers,more garlic (2 cloves), more Feta cheese (1/4th a cup), and some black pepper to the recipe, but I am reviewing to add that this recipe does actually reheat very well if you pay attention to the moisture cautions added by other reviewers.

PERFECT!  This was everything that I was hoping it would be; I also added some shredded chicken that I had leftover, to make it a one-dish meal!  Thanks!  I was so pleased that my 7-year old even gobbled up all that spinach!!

I'll find another recipe for Spanakopita before I'd make this one again, very bland filling and insufficient phyllo. If I do repeat I'd spice up the spinach mix, use butter instead of oil on the top phyllo sheets, increase the feta, increase the feta sheets to 8 top and bottom, move to a 9x13 pan as the 9x9 fit the dough sheets but 2# of spinach was too too much.

Used Swiss Chard (white stemmed variety) called Silverbeet in New Zealand. Used low fat cottage cheese instead of feta. No nutmeg so used dash cayeene, Baked as a pie & it's a no fail recipe.

This recipe was great.  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I made some substitutions, but it was so good.  I made a second one 3 days later.  I substituted mozarella for the feta (Didn't have any at home), and pie crust (didn't have phyllo at home).  It turend out fabulous.

This is an awesome and was eaten right away at Thanksgiving.  It will soft and messy if you don't prepare the spinich right though.  I diced the spinich finely and then put it into a pot of boiling water for about five minutes to soften it.  I drained it, ran it under cold water, and then hand squeezed the spinich until all of the water came out.  You can put it in the bowl after this and use it.  You won't have any problems with it being too stringy or running with water.

I made this recipe for my father who loves Greek food. I needed to use up a lot of spinach from my CSA share. I had never used phyllo dough before, but it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I did use about double the sheets of dough. It turned out so good that my father kept most of it for himself and said that this recipe was "a keeper". I will be making it again. I imagine using bagged baby spinach would be easier. This recipe is great and tastes like restaurant food.

I love this dish. It's easy to make (though it takes a little time) and it is a great dish to bring to a pot luck. It good pipping hot from the oven and it also tastes good when it's gone cold and you are coming back for leftovers. I sometimes use cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and it's still good. A few times I've made individual packets or pie triangles (instead of in one big pan) making it easy for kids to grab one and run.

This Spanakopita was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone in our family.  I did go ahead and use 7-8 more sheets of phyllo dough in the middle to divide the filling. It turned out great.  Just wish there was a way to keep the layers crispy longer.  It is best when first out of the oven.  Will probably use fresh spinach next time, but otherwise thanks for a great recipe.

As mentioned in the other reviews, this dish can be frozen and then go directly into the oven.  I think it would have been perfect except that I didn't cook it quite long enough.  Oops!  Was still delicious though!  I added extra phyllo dough and also some spices (nutmeg, etc.) - yum.

Very good! I used three 10-oz packages of frozen, chopped spinach instead of the fresh and added 1 tsp. nutmeg.  We will make this again!

I must admit I cheat on this recipe - instead of using phyllo dough, I buy the frozen puff pastry sheets and just use those instead!  I know it's not authentic spankakopita that way, but it's a lot easier, and I actually prefer the taste and texture.  I also use fresh baby spinach (separated from the stems).  I've tried frozen in the past, but I think fresh makes a big difference in taste.

Fabulous. I was a little worried it was going to be too bland so I added dill, nutmeg and oregano per other suggestions. Made a bit more filling and put it in a 9x13. Used half a 16 oz pkg of phyllo. The top layer was a little too flyaway and unwieldy so I would love some suggestions on dealing with that.

I thought this was a tad bland. I liked it though.  Next time I will add some greek seasoning and perhaps a little mozzerella because cheese makes every thing better:)

I couldn't really taste the cheese in this, and I thought that it could use more salt. The consistency was good though. Overall, I thought it was a lot of time for something that didn't taste as good as something I could just buy instead. It was okay, but I probably won't make it again.

I followed some of the other reviews and used a lot more phyllo on the top and bottom.  I also added a little nutmeg and some salt and pepper.  But I realized as I was eating it, that I forgot the parsley.  It's ok, everyone still loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Make it and froze before hand.  Had to bake an extra 20 mins.  Perfect!! Use a 11 x 13 pan and use 10 sheets on bottom and 10 on top.

I thought this tasted very good but my father said it was bland and refused to eat more than one slice. I'm not sure why since the filling was creamy with the two cheeses but also had a strong onion taste to it. The phyllo was hard to work with (kept tearing) so if I made this again I would put it in a more traditional pot-pie type crust, but the filling itself was very good. I think it would work well even as a ravioli filling.

My guests could not stop eating them and talking about them!!  Amazing.  I actually made little triangles with the phyllo dough instead of big pie.  They looked prettier and looked more like finger food or appetizer.  Will make it anyday again and again....

Great dish and so easy to make.  Based on advice from other reviews, I double the phyllo dough and was glad I did.  Also, I used frozen Green Giant spinach and it was so tasty.  Very delicious recipe.  I ate it three times in one day!

This recipe is fabulous!  All the flavors I was expecting were right there!  I followed the recipe with the exception that I also added 1 cup of Parmesan cheese to increase the flavor.  The only let down is that the phyllo dough is so delicate that its lost in the abundance of other ingredients.  Next time I will make this with a pastry crust just to see how it turns out.  But I think it will be better if I just add several more sheets of phyllo.  All in all, a delicious recipe!  Thanks Silverwolf!

This recipe is one of my favorites!  I used additional pieces of phyllo on the bottom and top and even split the filling and used several pieces of phyllo in the middle.  I used dried parsley and estimated about a 1/4 of cup (which was more than what the recipe would have called for for dried flakes), but it was fantastic!  I served it with a greek salad and drizzled some of the lemon/olive oil greek dressing over top.  It was amazing!  Recommend this recipe to anyone!

to dry your spinach (and any other fresh greens that need to be washed before being used like parsley, cilantro, basil...) just put them into an old kitchen towel. then make a "net" out of the towel, holding the gathered corners in one hand and the bottom in the other. and run the whole thing under cold water, wringing it out and re-soaking it several times. finally, wring it out as hard as you can. open it up and you've got clean, dry greens.

I used frozen spinach to save time. this was half thawed and when added to the hot mixute was just the right consistancy and temp to keep moving and finish this.  Great Pie.

This is so good! I recently became vegetarian and have been looking for a filling main course...this does the trick!!! I ended up using an 8x8 dish and it work perfectly. I also used frozen chopped spinach (make sure to squeeze out water!) because it was easier and on hand. I didn't have feta cheese, so instead I used shredded mozzarella. I was so happy with the end results! I've already put this recipe in my favorites.

This was really good and even my kids loved it. I did change some things to fit my taste but the overall recipe is great. I used 1 1/2 bags of 9oz baby spinach (no where near 2lbs)I found that for everyone's need for more pastry this made a better balance as well as using about 2 extra sheets per layer. I only used 3 green onions, 1/4 cup parsley and realized after we ate it that it would have been perfect with more feta. Since I modified the recipe to my tastes I feel I cannot rate less than a five since we loved it, so the core recipe is a winner.

it took me hours to trim and chop all of the spinach needed (4 bags of fresh spinach!), and it wasn't that great when i was finally done.  i think it was WAY too much work for the final result.  even if you use frozen spinach to make it much easier, there is really no point as it is not really that good; just okay.

I made this recipe twice. The second time I made some needed improvements: only 1 lb spinach, double the sheets of phyllo, salt and garlic added to the spinach. Still, the recipe was mediocre.

I have made baklava for the past couple years at Christmas and I always have left over phyllo.  This year I decided to try a new recipe to use it up. I had to altar the recipe quite a bit because I didn't have the exact ingredients but it still turned out incredible!  I used red onion instead of green, cilantro instead of parsley, cream cheese (about 3 oz) instead of ricotta, parmesan and a deli swiss cheese mix from my locally owned grocery instead of feta.  I added extra garlic, salt and pepper and sauteed the veggies in butter instead of olive oil.  I did use olive oil to brush the phyllo.  I also used extra phyllo on the top.  This was just so delicious.  Do not be afraid to try it!  It was easy too!

This recipe turned out to be a real good one!! Instead of using phillo dough I used puff pastry that I had made up yesterday it turned our light and flakey and just delisious.. I used frozen spinach with lots of wringing out, next time I will add a pinch of salt to the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I was very worried about the phyllo dough drying but between sheets I covered the pack with a damp towel and they didn't dry. I also prepared this the night before and put it in the freezer, the next day I just took it out and baked it for a full hour instead of 30-40 minutes. I will definately make this again!

Outstanding!  My husband and I gobbled this up so fast!  It is even better after it has been refrigerated--all those flavors mingle together...  then heated in the toaster oven.  Mmmmmm!

This was really good.  As recommended by others, I doubled the onions and cheeses and halved the spinach.  I love spinach, though, so I would have liked more.  My BF liked it. I also added 2 Tbsp fresh dill and left out the parsley.  I also doubled the amount of phyllo dough which, in my opinion, is essential. Oh, I almost forgot!  I added 1 Tbsp of flour when I was cooking the spinach to absorb any extra moisture.  I definitely recommend that if you aren't using pre-washed spinach leaves.  Thanks for the recipe.  Very good one!

This is a very good vegetarian pie. I did use more than 8 sheets of phillo dough and I liked it better.

I made this recipe with so many changes that I am hesitant to review it here, but I guess the point is that I'm reporting that the recipe is very amenable to substitutions.  I used rainbow chard (stems and all) rather than spinach, and cottage cheese rather than ricotta.  I also used more garlic and more phyllo than the recipe called for.  DBF and I loved it and I would happily make it again.  I might even follow the instructions this time!  :D  Awesome recipe - TYVM!

Not very good - too much spinach, not enough cheese mixture or phyllo dough. I'll stick to the commercial made stuff - thanks for sharing :)

Very good. People's reviews were useful and used half the amount of spinach. I used frozen spinach and squeezed it after thawing to take the water out, did not have the sogginess problem. The meal goes perfect with Tzatziki sauce on the side.

So, so good!  I did have to substitute a mozzerella/provalone cheese mixture, because I didn't have the ricotta and other cheeses, but it turned out so yummy!  Great recipe!

Only 4 sheets of  Phyllo dough for the top and bottom?  What's up with that?  I made the recipe exactly and when finished There was nowhere near enough crust for bottom or top.  Filling was good though so next time I'll make it in layers with so much more Phyllo dough.  :^)

I was slightly disappointed with this recipe.  While good, certainly, it's not nearly as tasty as the dish served at my favorite Greek eatery.  The parsley adds a rather harsh flavor I was not accustomed to.  This is worth trying, but, in my opinion, not as good as Spanakopita II.

We make this about once a week and it is really good! We use the low fat ricotta and low fat feta and it is still very excellent. Goes great with Tzatziki.

I boiled the spinach cooled and drained all moisture out.I then added the garlic onions and parsley that had been fried in olive oil. Mozzerella cheese is also a nice touch.It certainly has an authentic greek taste.

This was good but it became a bit dry as I really drained after I had cooked the spinach.  Next time I will leave a bit of the liquid.

Outstanding.  Converted my sheltered parents to this 'foreign' dish.  My mom liked it despite not liking spinach.  Using less spinach (whatever I have on hand) makes a more dense, savory dish favored by those not as fond of spinach.

I wish (like other reviewers) that I knew to drain the spinach.  I did not like this dish at all and would not make it again. I did not think that it was flavorful, my spinach was very soggy and bland, and it was a little cumbersome working with the phyllo sheets.

Delicious. Make sure to drain the spinach mixture and don't skimp on the olive oil. I added several more layers of phyllo on the top and bottom and three layers in the middle. I also made this in a 9 x 13 dish.

This was okay. I really didn't feel it had enough taste. I made this a while ago and just read the review that says to drain your spinach. I very much agree. I too love phyllo dough, especially when it is crispy and flaky. There just wasn't enough umph for myself or my husband. The bottom of my dish was also soggy.

This was very good.  However, I do think that the author forgot to let you know to drain the spinach.  I took off most of the liquid before putting into the pie, but wish I would have drained it better.  There is nothing better than phyllo crust, and my bottom crust was soggy.  Next time I will drain, drain drain!  Also, the more layers of phyllo, the better.  GOOD recipe!  I will make it again!

This is excellent. I used melted butter instead of oil to brush the phyllo dough. Also it is very helpful to cover the phyllo dough sheets that are waiting with a clean damp tea towel to keep them from drying out.

This recipe was very good, the only draw back was the liquid in the bottom of the pan, it made the dough soggy. Maybe it was the ricotta cheese? Next time I will omit the ricotta and add a different cheese. Will add more phillo dough as others have suggested. Using fresh spinach makes a difference in taste.  Yummy!

I have made this many times.  I like that the recipe uses olive oil instead of butter to brush on the phyllo - it lightens up a very rich dish but doesn't compromise the flavour at all.  As this is quite time-consuming I always double the recipe and stash one pan in the freezer.

This is a really good recipe!  Next time I'll add more feta and use much more dough (I already used twice the amount in the recipe).  Overall though, this is a great base recipe that everyone can alter to their own liking.  Thanks!

This recipe is delicous!  The only complaint I had was that I found it a bit watery.  I might be from the ricotta cheese andor the spinach wasn't dried after I cleaned it.  Make sure you do that to ensure your pie isn't soggy.

Very good recipe! The ricotta makes it so watery though and therefore makes the phyllo really soggy on the bottm. Next time I won't use ricotta but instead more feta and some freah mozerella or shredded white cheese of some sort.

A little time-consuming but really worth the extra work. Placed in 12x9 casserole dish vs. 9x9 dish and used more phyllo sheets. I loved as main meal, dh loved as side dish. Either way was a hit!

Hi. I really liked this Pie. I'm not giving five * because the directions arn't complete. DEFINITLY listen to the other readers and DRAIN/squeeze out your spinach in a strainer. There's lots of unwanted water after the Spinach cooks. Also, make sure to brush the pyhllo dough with oil, as it will be a little tough if you don't. That's it! Thanks for the Delicious Recipe Joe!!

Good and pretty easy. I made this lowfat by using egg substitute, fat free ricotta, reduced fat feta. I also sprayed my dish and sauteed the veggies with olive oil cooking spray(fat free).

I made it with tortillas as a base instead of phyllo, and with free beet greens instead of spinach, and added grated mozzarella on top of the covering tortillas and also to greens added 1T Italian seasoning, 1T dried dill, and 2T dried mint and some fresh mint mixed in with parsley. Otherwise followed the recipe, lol. I can’t believe that most people ask for the greens to be discarded at the market!

I love this recipe!! The triangles drove me nuts, plus I avoided making this because of all the butter. Now I'm happy. Olive oil changes everything. You do have to dry the spinach out. I just used some paper towels. it's all good. So glad you shared your recipe.

When I make it next time, I'll add more feta. I substituted cottage cheese for ricotta cheese and added some fresh chopped dill. Also added an additional egg (3) to be sure everything set up well. There's so much spinach in this recipe, I feel it needs additional cheese to mellow out the spinach taste a bit. Cook the spinach and use the plate method to squeeze out moisture. This worked great. I had no problem with too much moisture. One caveat, don't cover for 30 minutes then uncover for an additional 10 as one person suggested. I tried that, but it didn't brown well!! A good recipe that I will continue to make & tweak as I go.

We really liked it but the bottom layers of crust were soggy.  I don’t think I drained the spinach mix well enough after cooking.  My wife wondered if I used too much oil.  I’ll be definitely making this again.

You definitely need to strain and squeeze out excess liquid from the spinach mixture before assembly.  Spinach ALWAYS creates a lot of liquid.  I strained the spinach mixture before assembly and was glad I did.

There seemed to be something missing, though.  I liked the suggestion about nutmeg.  I'll try that next time.  I did add Greek Oregano, but it wasn't enough.

Made this tonight. It was a hit!! Ways I deviated from the recipe: I used 4oz feta, 8oz ricotta, and 2 eggs because that is what I had of each. I also used parchment sprayed with cooking spray in the bottom of the dish. It was simple and easy. Definitely will make again.

Made this for the first time.  Definite potential here... I will try again while adding more flavors... More feta for salt, more garlic and onion, maybe a hint of lemon for acidity?

I wish I would have squeezed the moisture out of the spinach mixture more than I did, I gave it a good press in a strainer before mixing in the cheese's and eggs but I think I could of done a better job on that part. Other than that it was a decent spanakopita that had no surprises.

What an Excellent dish! FYI I like to serve with a fresh lemon wedge as lemon juice squirted a top add flavor without adding sodium.

It’s delicous. Time consuming but worth it. I used pre washed, bagged spinach. 8 or 10 layers of dough on the bottom, none in the middle and 8 or so on top.

Definitely follow the advice to dry the mixture and keep the pastry as dry as possible. It could use some extra seasoning as well... dill was mentioned, but I added lemon and salt too.

I made this with my own homemade puff pastry dough instead of filo dough, and I doubled the feta and the garlic because I really like cheese, and frankly only two cloves is a crime. I did them in pastries instead of a pie, but they are delicious.  I also bought pre-chopped frozen spinach to save time, and if you decide to do that I would definitely recommend draining it first (which is what I did) and then cooking it with the onions.

I added more ricotta cheese. I used 1 cup. I reduced the onion to 1/2 cup. It was great. This recipe is authentic like the Greek women at Pizza World used to make 50 years ago!

This was so good.  Better then some I’ve had in restaurants.  I didn’t have Filo dough so I ended up using breadcrumbs for the top. I used Panko breadcrumbs and that gave a nice crispy top. It was excellent.  This is going in my personal cookbook and I’m definitely making it again.

Fast, easy, tasty recipe :)! I added few more sheets on the bottom and on the top - which worked out better for our family's liking, but other than that this is a great recipe for a light dinner, midday snack :)

This is a great recipe -- never knew it would be so easy.  Two notes - one is absolutely needs SALT which I would add in the cooking the spinach part . Also when using fresh, there needs to be some draining of water.  The second time I made it I used frozen and squeezed all the water out before combining with the onions, etc.  Very happy to have a recipe as it seems harder to come by in old style diners!

I've made this recipe several times and love it.  I do make adjustments suggested by other reviewers:  addition of nutmeg and dill; additional sheets of phyllo; a mix of butter and olive oil between the phyllo layers; and slicing the pie before baking.   I learned a tip for straining frozen spinach while watching Rachel Ray many years ago.  Place the thawed spinach in a clump in the center of a dish towel (not terry cloth).  Wrap and twist the towel around the spinach so the spinach is in a ball.  Twist the towel tightly around the ball over the sink and virtually all of the water strains through the towel and down the drain.

I really liked it a lot.  I used the baby spinach that was pre-washed and still had some moisture which I drained a bit before putting it in the cooking dish.  I definitely think it could use more dough.  I'm not much of a cook so this was my first experience with phyllo dough.  It was everywhere. LOL.  It ripped all over the place. But my daughter liked it so that's all that mattered to me!

Absolutely fabulous!  As per other reviews, I tripled the garlic, added a bit more cheese, some lemon zest, and used a whole "bag" of phyllo dough brushed with a mix of butter and oil (the box came with two).  I  then partially cut through the  top before baking and it was much easier to cut and serve when done.  PS.  Careful with the phyllo - don't keep it out on the counter too long or it dries out.  Still able to work with it but harder to use when it comes out in pieces instead of sheets.   Next time I will cover with damp cloth.  Thanks for sharing!

Used the recipe but instead of a pie, made triangles with them. Cut the phyllo pastry into strips and folded over with 4-5 layers. Cook as instructed. Good for freezing too! Just freeze before cooking, then put in the oven and cook straight from the oven when desired!

I followed the recipe as written and found that it just tasted like baked spinach. That was my family's opinion anyway.  Not sure why, it just didn't have much flavor other than spinach.  There also was not enough phyllo in my opinion; using the amount stated in the recipe.  I may try this again but will have to adjust it quite a bit to get better flavor.

I tried this recipe.  It came out beautiful, but the spinach mixture was not to my liking.  Too much onion and parsley and I would have liked a lot more cheese and less spinach.  I will be moving on to a different recipe.

Delicious! I found it fit best in a 9x13 pan if I wanted overhang on just 2 sides. My phyllo sheets must be a different size. I reheated leftovers by putting it in a cold oven, covered with foil, and heating to 375°F. It was crisp and warmed through after about 10 minutes at 375. It's also good cold, but i wouldn't recommend microwave reheating if you want the pastry crispy, not soft/steamed. That's if you have any leftovers. This recipe made 2 days' generous meals for the 2 of us.

I had extra parsley so added that in and it came out even better. Added lemon juice , doubled the garlic and doubled the phyllo dough than called for. I had no green onions so omitted that. So, so good! Highly recommend.

Loved it!  Had some trouble handling the phyllo  as I think i let it get too soft to separate, still worked out great!  Family loved it, will definitely make again.

First time I’ve ever made this and it tasted delicious! I added more layers of the phyllo dough on top and bottom, double the cheeses and garlic. I also added mushrooms and next time I’ll add some ground up sausage to make it hardier.

Waaaayy too much spinach. I used fresh spinach, de-stemmed,washed, dried well, cooked down....2 lbs is waaayyy too much filling.  You only want and need 1/2 of this as per many other recipes that have this ratio AND they use a 9x13 pan with full sheets of phyllo, which are much easier to lay out.  I wish I had referenced other recipes first before making this one.  Also, if you've never made it before, a short video is key as the instructions for the phyllo in this recipe are vague.  I also added dill and cracked pepper.   I will not make this recipe again although I will use ricotta as I thought that was a nice touch.

This was ok as is. Next time I would use many more layers of dough. Also I thought it was too soggy using a 24 oz bag of baby spinach instead I  would use 20 oz chopped frozen spinach as it would be easier to wring out. I would also add some dill.

Love this recipe!  I did make changes that I liked.  I added nutmeg and dill a very little salt.  To save time I use a package of Pepperidge Farm puffed pastry and I use a nonstick cake pan.  So easy, there are 2 layers.  I put 1 on the bottom of the pan.  I add the spinach mixture and then I put the other layer on top.  When that is done I spray olive oil on top.  Saves a lot of time and is awesome.  No need to spray the bottom sheet of puffed pastry.

This was great! I had to drain  spinach mixture even after letting it "set". One tip to make phyllo easier to work with. Nonstick cooking spray! Use it instead of butter or olive oil between the layers. It's so much faster.

This recipe turned out great! However, I did make some changes. First, I constituted the 2 lbs of spinach for 3 cups of frozen baby spinach. Second, like other reviews stated, it is absolutely integral to make sure ALL the moisture is out of the spinach/onion mixture. You can do this by pressing it down in the strainer with a spatula or with your hands. Next, the recipe comes out better when you use more filo dough. Use 6-8 sheets below the mixture, and 6-8 sheets above the mixture. When working with the filo dough, lay a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper on top of it, and on the paper place a moist paper towel or napkin. This will prevent the dough from drying out. Finally, this recipe is BLAND. You need to add salt and pepper. I even added some diced green chili for a spicier kick and it turned out great! You can also add walnuts or pine nuts and it will taste superb!

I loved the recipe. Phyllo dough is a little tricky to work with but in the end my spanakopita did not look too bad. I had both fresh and frozen chopped spinach. I used my scale to make sure I had the right amount. I squeezed the spinach dry too. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great base for a recipe but I did make some small changes based on other reviews.  I added 1/2 tbsp of dried dill and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the filling.  I also omitted the green onion only because I didn't have any.  I didn't have quite 2 lbs of baby spinach but it still worked out.  To remove all the moisture after it was cooked and cooled a bit I put small amounts of spinach in the palm of my hand and squeezed all the excess water out after the suggested colander draining. I removed about another 1/2 cup of liquid this way!

This recipe was super easy to make. It helped me get over my fear of phyllo. I had a 300 g package of chopped frozen spinach that I already had in the freezer which I think would be the equivalent of 1 lb of fresh spinach. I squeezed all the excess liquid and added it straight to the cheese and egg. The second pound of spinach came from my garden. I sauteed that with the onions and garlic. In retrospect I wish I had strained the liquid from that too. The bottom crust came out soggy. Next time I will add more feta or season with salt because I felt it lacked saltiness. But I overall I was happy with the result and found it tasty.

Really good!  I used frozen chopped spinach and squeezed the excess water out after thawing.  I also made appetizer sized bites by placing tbs portions of filling onto the dough and wrapping it like a package.

Do not worry about specifics! I eyeballed all the ingredients since I do not have a scale and did a lot of the things that many of the reviews said NOT to do- the spinach pie still turned out phenomenal. The only thing I will say is to mind your cheese-  for example, if your feta cheese is chunky, grind it into a sand texture before incorporating it into the recipe. Also, if you want more health, add kale with the spinach. Nobody in my family even noticed I used kale and they LOVED IT!

I hadn't made spanakopita in many years, so I was pleased to find a recipe that matched what I remembered. It is definitely necessary to drain the spinach, and even more so if you use frozen. I find that frozen spinach is easier and doesn't take away from the flavor, but the worst part is the draining. I agree that adding extra garlic and much more feta helps the flavor, and I definitely used extra sheets of phyllo. I tried a butter-infused olive oil to brush on the sheets, and it turned out delicious!!  Note:  I think next time I will use a more traditional feta cheese from the farmer's market here or from Whole Foods that has a sharper flavor than the typical grocery store brands; I remember it making a big difference when I used to make it years ago. Also, I found that a 9x9 pan is way too small! I used 9x13 and it made a perfect size!

I wish I had paid more attention to the recipe when I was searching, it tasted good but it fell apart easily.  Next time I'm going to do it as individual pieces similar to wontons, I think being compact and having the filling sealed will work better for our family.

The Spanakopita was good, I would add one step to the recipe. That is to  squeeze the excess water in the spinach out before adding it to the phyllo dough. Otherwise it gets really soggy when you take it out of the oven.

I used butter instead of olive oil, I used more layers of filo, 4 eggs and a medium yellow onion finely chopped mixed with the feta (one pound crumbled) and one bag of defrosted chopped spinach (drained of water) baked in a 13x9 in pan. Salt the spinach/egg/feta/onion mixture to taste. I divided the spinach feta into two parts with filo on bottom, between and several on top to make a big topping of flakiness.

This recipe was delicious, and very easy to make.  I noticed a lot of people added other flavors to it - nutmeg, dill, lemon, etc.  But I decided to make the spinach mixture almost exactly the way the author wrote it, because I like to try to stick to the spirit of a recipe when I first make it, and then try other things later.  The only thing I changed about the filling was no ricotta, because I didn't have it, and extra feta.  I thought it was truly excellent, because you could actually taste the spinach!

Otherwise, I took other reviewers' advice of adding extra layers of filo dough, and was glad I did, because mine was still a little thin with 7 layers on the bottom, and 7 on top.  I cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan, and it made 8 perfect squares, which served 4 hungry people.  Lastly, I took one reviewer's "family secret" tip of cutting the top into squares before baking, and then pouring some smoking hot oil over the top before putting it in the oven, and this really puti it "over the top".  It came out of the oven golden brown and crisp and absolutely delicious.

We will make this one again and again!

This was my first attempt at Spanakopita, and it was delish!! I did use the full amount of spinach, doubled the garlic and probably 1/4 cup of parsley.  I did add dill as the other reviewers stated and some lemon juice.  The big change I made only because I did not have phyllo dough on hand was I rolled out a sheet of puff pastry and placed it in a deep dish pie plate and folded the edges of the dough over the filling and made it more like a pie. My husband approved by eating seconds as I did as well.  I will be making a second spinach pie and sticking it in the freezer.

Hi there! I ve made this recipe and it was delicious. I added fresh dill which goes very well. I have a good trick for you guys that struggled with the water in the spinach. I ve learned it from a greek lady: in the spinach and cheese mix put a table spoon or two (depends of quantity) of uncooked rice!! You wont even taste it in the final product and it will help you get rid of all extra water!! Hope i helped !! Enjoy!!

Fantastic!  This recipe makes a Detroit Greentown rivaling spinach pie.  I took the advise of other and changed a couple of things.  1.  Make sure you cool the spinach before adding to egg/cheese mixture.  I let it cool in a colander and it released about a cup of liquid.  Can only imagine it would have been soggy had I not drained it.  No need to squeeze it dry.   2. I added about 8 layers of phyllo dough to the top and bottom 3.  I brushed each layer with a mixture of melted butter and olive oil.  Used fresh spinach as directed and baked in a 13 × 9.  Took 40 minutes to brown up.  You cannot go wrong with this one!

Excellent, and it came out as I expected it should traditionally taste. The feta I used was mild. I will look for a sharper feta next time.
I did omit the onions and garlic due to diet restrictions so that is why I think a sharper feta would be better. I also used butter on the layers instead of olive oil, but did use a little olive oil while wilting the spinach on low heat.
Since there are two packs of phyllo in a box I would double the recipe. I used a large baking sheet, not the 9x9 pan

I made it in a round pan and it turned out fine. I also took StewartFip's advice and really drained the spinach and cooled it before adding it. I also added a little salt realizing feta is salty, I still like a little in the spinach. I would definitely make this again!

I would make it again but with half the spinach and double the phyllo. It was too watery and way too much mixture and not enough phyllo . You should be able to eat this like a pizza.

Need to add at least 1 tablespoon of dill (dry or fresh).
Needs at least twice as much phyllo dough layers on top.
Okay to use frozen spinach, just press the excess water out.  Can also add a little rice to absorb the excess water.  Using olive oil spray on the phyllo makes it even easier.

This is a great recipe and a family favorite. I usually use organic baby spinach but sometimes I add some baby kale or arugula.   Because it is very important to get your spinach/greens  as dry as possible, I have a tip (don't remember where I read it)  I use a potato ricer and it absolutely squeezes out an unbelievable amount of liquid without much effort.

This was so good! I have been missing the food you get in Greek Town in Detroit, but not anymore. This recipe tastes just like you would get at a Greek restaurant.  It was easier to make than I thought. I did use frozen spinach. It turned out perfect.

Followed recipe with advice from others.  Drained the spinach mixture until very dry and cool!   Added more feta.  Next time I will add dill and more feta but LOVED the outcome.   Made in a 10x10 pan using 8 sheets of phyllo on bottom and 10 on top.   Will add more to bottom next time.

I had a 9 x 11 inch open casserole dish which fit the filo dough sheets perfectly.  I used the spray olive oil for the sheets (brilliant), doubled the ricotta to 1 cup, used the green onion but left out the other onion, added an egg, and used two pounds of frozen chopped spinach.  It worked perfectly.

Very good recipe as written.  I've never used philo dough, but it turned out perfect.  The filling did lack flavor.  I read a review about adding lemon juice, which I would try next time with a light sprinkle of salt.  I will also try making this with a pastry crust for a heat n'eat dish.

I've made this about 3 times now and really like this. You must drain and dry the spinach after cooking it. I put it in a colander and mush it down a bit. Next time I'll use one person's suggestion of squeezing it between two plates. Great tip! Make sure you cool the mixture down ALL THE WAY.

I followed the recipe but used chopped, frozen spinach (three packs), and 8 sheets of filo pastry top and bottom.  Could have used even 10 sheets each. I also mixed olive oil with butter for the pastry and put the pan under the broiler for a minute to brown the top after baking. Oh, and I used a 9x11 inch pan. The adults loved it but the children were picky about the "green stuff." No amount of Popeye stories helped. I think I'll use more Feta in it next time. I froze a second pan of it for next time.

My apologies to the purists out there but I also added fresh basil and chopped asparagus, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts!  I have made it with none of the additions, all of the additions, and a combination of the 3 depending on what I had on hand and it always turns out phenomenal!  Even my 3 year old cleans her plate; no complaints about leftovers on day three!  I agree with StewartFip that more layers of phyllo are beneficial - although I lose count - 8 on top and bottom sounds about right.

Per my husband, a fussy greek: best spankopita ever. I did used frozen spinach , thawed and drained. I did use 9x13 pan and added nutmeg and dill and garlic like other reviewers suggested. It was my first time using phyllo dough and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be; I'm going to try to make a baklava now that I've made this! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I only made this for my husband and I so I used one pound of baby pre-washed spinach, rather than the two stated. Also, I am not a fan of parsley at all so I omitted that and I didn't have green onions so didn't put those either. Pretty much followed the rest of recipe as stated except I definitely added more ricotta and feta cheese. Will make again and again. It's an easy dish to make, but can be a bit time consuming.

Excellent recipe - very authentic (and I'm Greek)!  I read through MANY of the great reviews, and can say that I picked up some GREAT (MUST do!) tips!  Making sure that the filling has most of the water squeezed out of it is very important - otherwise you'll have a mess on your hands!  Also, cutting the spanakopita BEFORE baking was helpful too. I used only Feta cheese, and added some dill. The tips about using more filo dough were good one as well. I think I used 8 sheets for both the bottom and the top. Overall, great recipe!!

I make this spanakopita for years and I eat it in Greece. In the original recipe there is some dill in the filling, also use the frozen spinach after thawing and squeeze all the water out. I found that mixing the olive oil with a little butter to use to brush the top layer gives a very nice flavor.

This recipe cries out for dill!  When I make spanakopita (often) I add it to the mixture before putting it into the phyllo until it tastes "dilly" enough for us.

This was wonderful. Tastes traditional. Only changes were that I did add a little fresh dill, used extra dough because we love it. I used about 10 pieces on the bottom and top and put it in a 11X8 pan because it is what I had. Excellent recipe!

This was handy to make ahead, freeze, and then pop in the oven when you are ready. Like other reviews said, I ended up baking it for 20 minutes longer, but it should have been 30. It was a touch on the bland side, so I will add some tabasco and salt next time. Does NOT reheat well out of the refrigerator, beware!

Very easy to make and delicious!  I used frozen spinach and squeezed as much water out as I could.  When done, the pie was firm with just the right amount of moisture.  CAUTION:  This recipe could become habit forming.

It wasn't bad at all, the crust was excellent, but the filling tasted strange.  I would reccomend greatly increasing the amount of feta cheese, and parsely, and reducing the amount of spinach.  I'd say double the amount of feta, and reduce the spinach by about a half a pound (75%). I think it may be a good idea to press the garlic rather than mincing it, too.

Soooo delicious! I made some alterations that may have made it slightly less delicious, but it definitely cut the fat.  I used low fat ricotta and fat free cottage cheese, and NO feta.  Feta is SO delicious but so fatty, which is why I left it out.  Since feta's quite salty, so I added a teaspoon or so of salt to the egg/cheese mixture.  Turned out really yummy!!  Using only 4.5 sheets of phyllo since I had a small pan, I calculated the calories and it was only about 200 per 1/6th of the whole thing.

I love this dish, and made a few personal modifications for my own taste, I used half plain feta cheese and half  seasoned feta. I used fresh baby spinach which is much easier to clean I also seasoned it with salt and pepper. Moisture was an issue but it wasn't too bad and didn't ruin the dish. I would also suggest some more cooking time. All in all this was a excellent dish.

Great recipe!  3 quick comments:   First, the importance of drying the spinach must not be understated. Second, for those of us watching clocks, note that drying can be done using the microwave without negatively affecting taste.     Finally, I reduced the fat in this recipe by substituting 2 extra egg whites instead of the amount of whole eggs orginally called for.  Needless to say, it didn't leave me feeling guilty or slightly drowsy after the meal.      I tried substituting egg whites only for whole eggs, and added more parsely.

I am lactose intollerant, so instead of the eggs & cheese, I made a thick white sauce with water (soy milk optional) and added salt, pepper and a little lemon juice. After that I stirred the white sauce into the spinach mixture and followed the recipy as usual.  It was delicious and I'll make it again.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh.

Wonderful! Be really careful with the moisture, as everyone said--dry the spinach well and let it cool. Don't overdo the oil on the phyllo, either--I used less than called for. We added a bit more feta as well. Good leftovers, good out of the freezer.

I never knew Spanakopita is so easy to make. This recipe is delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the spinach was too moist, which made the crust kinda soggy. Next time I would try to dry the spinach really good before baking the pie.

I added eggs and sauteed garlic and omitted the cheddar cheese.  My husband and I both loved it!!!  Will make again for sure.  :)

Very tasty.  Definitely better as a side dish or appetizer than a main course, though.

This was really good. I used frozen, chopped spinach and it worked just fine. Seems that the spinach to cheese mixture ratio was too much. Could've used more ricotta & feta or less spinach.

Sooo good! Added dill as noted by so many others. We liked it so much I made another dish a few days later using some mushrooms too. This is a new staple in our house - thanks!

Great main dish for vegetarians. Our family was having a greek themed dinner and I needed something for my brother who was a vegetarian as a main dish since he is not a fan of veg moussaka. I tried this and he loved it! The rest of our family enjoyed it as well. Some mod's I made..started with four half layers on a  13x9 pan (lasagna tray), then I followed with the layers that went over the pan. My spinach cheese mixture was pretty soupy so I would take a full basting spoon and press it against the side of the pot before putting it in tray with the phyllo, this process was a bit time consuming. After I finished pressing and spooning it into the crust then I mixed in a few more spoons of ricotta and feta into the mixture lightly and finished it off with four layers of phyllo dough. Would make this again, was pretty easy and delicious for my first try at the recipe!

Good flavor but too moist for my liking. I think I may skip the eggs next time or make the filling a day ahead so it sets.

This was pretty good! I made it for a potluck and it got devoured. I think I may leave some of the stems on the spinach next time, because I personally like mine more that way.

Very good.  Only used 1/2 an onion.  Next time I would probably double the feta to give it more kick but otherwise it was very easy and very tasty.  I used prewashed bagged spinach and had no problems.

I agree w/ "see mommy run". There was definitely way too much spinach and not enough phyllo and not enough cheese. I felt like there needed to be an added thicker cheese and while making it I kept feeling like I should add a lot more phyllo. I wish I had; This needed tons more.

This was excellent.  My roommate never likes when I cook and he loved this one.  He's never had it before and already wants to know how long it took to make (1:30-2)...I think I need to make it again!  LadyJayPee was very helpful!  1)Didn't use the parsley 2)added 2tbsp dill weed 3)4 flat layers of phyllo and then 4 overhanging layers before pouring HALF the mixture in.  Tuck in over filling and use 4 more overhanging layers and pour in the rest of the filling.  Tuck over filling.  Top with 4 layers and tuck into pan 4)4 cloves of garlic, 1 bunch of green onions and 2 4oz pacakages of feta (the tomato and basil one was very tasty!)

Great recipe...I feel like I'm back in Athens...yummy!  Will definetly make again.

This was awfully bland, and a waste of some super-yummy spinach, I'm sorry to say. Couldn't get the family to eat it. The filling seeped out of the phyllo dough in several places, or just soaked through. Perhaps I did something wrong, but I think I'll stick to my spinach as a side. Sorry :(

The flavor of this dish was quite good.  I did think it was very thick and would make it in a 9x13 next time as some reviewers had suggested.

I wish I had read the reviews before I attempted it, but all in all, I was delighted with the results, especially since I was intimidated about working with the delicate phyllo. Next time I'm tripling the garlic, doubling the dough, draining the spinach after sauteeing, and adding a bit of salt.

I made this for a party we had, it was easy and my entire party loved it.  Great flavor, I added more feta, more fresh chopped garlic (approx 5 -6 cloves), more filo dough, and a little less spinach.  This was my first experience with filo dough, but I just kept it covered and it worked perfectly.  I will be making this again.  It is a good use of the big bag of spinach.

I made this last summer, and it was delicious. My boyfriend was not at all excited when I told him what it was, and that it had spinach, but after he tasted it he has been asking for me to make it again ever since.

DH loves the spanikopita triangles they serve at a local restaurant and has been nagging me to make some at home. I have been dreading it 'cause I didn't want to roll all those tedious little triangles. This delicious recipe makes us both happy. Thanks!

Great recipe!  Lots of flavor and fairly easy to prepare.  Just remember to drain the spinach mixture some prior to adding to cheese, mine was a little soupy.

I couldn't find any phyllo dough, so I just made this as a regular quiche with the same ingredients (just filled a pie crust). It turned out great.

As the reviews suggested, I drained the filling before folding it into the phyllo crust.  It turned out very dry and pretty flavorless.

This was good, just not how it should have been.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted good and was easy to make and therefore a good recipe.  It was just not the way Spanankopita would have tasted at a good Greek restaurant (and part of that could have been due to "operator error").  Next time I will use melted butter on the phyllo leaves instead of olive oil, and I will be sure to butter each layer to make the crust light and fluffy.  I also used packaged baby spinach which I think was a good call.  When I found this recipe I was actually looking for a recipe for Tryopitta, so if anyone has a good recipe, they should submit it!

Great recipe!  Took it to a party with a Mediterranean theme and everyone loved it.  :)

The one change I made was to make two seperate layers of filling instead of just one.

Very nice recipe.  I accidently used the 'smooth' ricotta and it still came out very nice.

This was excellent the 1st time I made it, then I added an 1/8 cup Danish Blue Cheese to the recipe and it got even better if you can imagine that possible.

Oh WOW!!! Talk about melt in your mouth! This was awesome. My husband is a VERY picky eater, and he gobbled up three helpings. I strayed from the recipe only to add a full cup of feta instead of a half. YUMMY!

I have always loved spinach pie, this recipe was quick and easy to make and tastes just like the spanakopita you would find in a Greek restaurant.
