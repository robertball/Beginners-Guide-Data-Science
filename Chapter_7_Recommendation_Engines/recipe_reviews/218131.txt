Completely addictive!  We cut the pickle and dressing recipes in half, and used one "personal" watermelon to make 8 servings (use an entire pound of bacon, though -- the bacon really makes the dish!)  Be forewarned: the first bite is a little disconcerting, but you'll find that you have to take another... and another...

This was refreshing and very tasty. Perfect as a side dish for a summer meal. I used a personal sized melon for the two of us but I would use a regular sized watermelon in the future because the pickled rind was too thin and tough.I would also watch the red pepper amount because it did seem a bit hot for our tatse. The recipe looks way more complicated than it is. I pickled the rind the day before. Then assembled the salad the next day. Simple and delish!

I followed the recipe without any changes other than leaving the bacon on the side for people to add as wanted - we have a few vegetarians in our extended family.  Everyone loved it from the 2 year old to the 80 year old!  My 3 teenagers in particular are asking to make it again.  So glad I took a chance on this.  I'm sure it will become a family staple during watermelon season.
I did slice the rind into thin strips instead of chunks.  I also pickled extra rind and the kids are snacking on that.  
Thank you for the delicious recipe!
