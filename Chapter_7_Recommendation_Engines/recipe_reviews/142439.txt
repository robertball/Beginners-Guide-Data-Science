I got the summer craving for homemade ice cream last week so I pulled out my 6qt. and this recipe.  I made it for dessert at my restaurant as a special and it was a hit.  The cinnamon is subtle I might double it the next time, but a great creamy combination for a no-cook recipe.  It's not an inexpensive batch though, as Black Walnuts cost more, but well worth it.

This is very good. We added a splash of cinnamon extract to add a little more flavor. I'm making it again this week!

This sounds delicious.  However, I could not get past the high fat & calorie content.  I used the basic idea of this recipe for ingredients, but made frozen yogurt rather than ice cream.   My variation: 4 cups whole milk Greek yogurt 3/4 cup white sugar 2 cups candied walnuts (I did not have black walnuts) 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt.  I mixed all together, poured into bowl of ice cream maker to freeze.  DELICIOUS.  Definitely sweet enough, and rich enough for our taste.  I will probably try making it with low fat or nonfat yogurt next time.

I loved this ice cream!  I am not a fan of homemade ice cream, but this is delicious. The cinnamon and black walnuts really compliment each other.  This recipe is quick and easy.  I highly recommend this ice cream!

I thought the amount of nuts was a little too much, but otherwise it was a really delicious ice cream!

This is very good.  I used evaporated milk and half and half.  After mixing the ingredients I did not chill them since they were already cold.  In fact my black walnuts were frozen.  I used black walnut extract instead of vanilla.  Yes black walnuts are expensive but they are well worth it for the authentic taste of this ice cream.  Subbing regular walnuts will not get the same taste.  Thanks!
