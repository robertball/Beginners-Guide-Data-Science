This was good.  Pretty easy to make and nice taste.  Was a hit at a potluck and the first dessert to be gone.  I used gluten free pretzels for the crust and did not add the food coloring.

It was all I could do not to eat the whole pie myself!  I omitted the tequila and food coloring and used a ready made graham cracker crust.

Delicious and easy!  This was a big hit at a recent BBQ.  It is definitely going in my dessert rotation. Recipe is perfect as written, no changes.  If I have a bigger crowd next time I will double the recipe and make it in a 13 x 9 pan.

This was a tasty pie...however I wanted it to be a little thicker. It was refrigerated over night and it was still soft. Tasted very similar to keylime pie...

This came out very well. I've made a similar recipe with Ritz cracker crust (no sugar), lemonade concentrate (whole can) and Cool Whip (whole thing of it I think) that I also remember liking, for those of you who are wondering if this would work with Cool Whip. I made this as directed but as usual my whipped cream didn't whip at the bottom of the dish (I don't know why I have that issue) so it wound up having a non-fluffy layer of rather icy stuff in the bottom of the pie which tasted fine but it really is better if you are able to whip it completely. I enjoyed the lime flavoring on this one, or maybe it was the tequila. Either way, great recipe, thanks!

I will definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly as indicated, only I didn't use the green food coloring or lime wedges for the topping.  However, the pie came out perfect.  The pretzels did not get mushy as I let them cool entirely before adding the filling.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!

If you are looking for a great dessert for Cinco de Mayo, this is it.   Itâ€™s creamy, tastes just like a margarita, and the crust is perfect.  I didn't bother with the food coloring.

I brought to a Superbowl party and it got raves!!! My only change was to use a premade granola crust, which I think was better. Easy to throw together & a nice finish to a testosterone-heavy southwest menu. :-)

I made it as shown with just a few changes.  I used 4 tbs. tequila instead of 2.  I took the recommendation of another reviewer and added an 8 oz tub of soften cream cheese to filling.  I didn't have any orange liqueur so I added 1/2 tsp orange extract.   It turned out awesome and my company loved it.  
Definitely will make again.

Suggest adding fresh lime zest to cut the sweetness. Added a sprinkling of pink himalayan  salt  as a garnish.

I wonâ€™t make it again but itâ€™s mainly because I donâ€™t like the taste of alcohol. I didn't realize that it would taste like a real margarita lol So for those of you that like it, you will love this pie.

It is OK, but needs more flavor.  More lime would probably help.   Also DO NOT let it sit out to thaw out b/4 serving.  With the tequlia in it is does not freeze solid.  Just remove from freezer, cut and serve.

as written, 4 stars.  I'm glad I read the reviews first and looked at the measurements.  I see no way that this could be anything other than how you would keep an ice cream pie, and take out right before serving.  This would be hard to transport to an event if made as written.  I did modify the recipe and took this to work for a Cinco de Mayo party, and it was fabulous, and got rave reviews from co-workers.  I could not use alcohol d/t work, so subbed out margarita mixer for that portion.  I added 8 ok pkg of cream cheese, and whipped the cream to stiff peaks.  I also added the zest of one lime.  This made it really zesty and refreshing, with a big splash of fresh lime flavor.  Even with adding the cream cheese, although not liquidy, I had to keep it refrigerated.  The consistency was somewhere between creamy ice cream/gelato and cheesecake.  I will definitely make this again for annual May party-time but do it with my modifications.  I did not bother with the food coloring.  It was the color of a light lemon cheesecake with flecks of green from the lime zest.

well ..  doesn't  taste like  margarita ...  sorry to  say ... too sweet and no  nerve at  all .. but aw well you  can eat it nicely like a sweet. I  would  marinate the lime into  tequila and  triple sec  to  give  some spirit out of it

I rate this a 3 for several reasons.  First, even after being in the freezer over night, the pie was still sticky.   It thaws very quickly.  
I chose not to use food coloring and the pie is not very attractive without it.   
That said the pie is delicious.  The pretzels are a great compliment for the margarita filling.

Just ok. It softened up far too quickly and was mushy and runny. The family liked it but didn't love it. Also, I found it to not have enough lime flavor. Another reviewer called it refreshing and light. It was neither of those things. The condensed milk made it too sweet. I don't know how to make changes to it while still keeping the basic idea of it. I'd love for it to be less sweet and more tart from the lime, but if I cut back on one and add more of the other will it be even more liquidy? I don't know if messing around with the recipe is worth it.
