Great recipe!  I've been looking for a white pasta sauce dish that wasn't quite as heavy as a typical alfredo one.  This one did the trick.  Good flavor and easy to do.  Instead of tomatoes and spinach, we sliced red, green and yellow peppers.  I also omitted the fat free milk and went light on the butter.  I will be making this again soon and adding shrimp to it as well.

Honestly speaking, I was hesitant in recreating the pasta but I wanted to try it. In my kitchen makes hot, like extremely hot so the heat was killing me. The recipe that was given, I used but added a little twist. I didn't have half and half. So I made my own which consisted of heavy cream and low-fat milk and proceed to blend the two. I also despise spinach and tomatoes so I used green peppers and lettuce. I also just used for my Italian seasoning which is rosemary, basil, garlic powder,  thyme, salt and pepper. I was disappointed that I burn my onions and use too much olive oil but it still turns out great.

This was a solid weeknight meal, but not something I would serve for company since it looks and tastes low-fat. It needs about 1/2 tsp salt and a healthy dash of hot sauce or cayenne. IMPORTANT: regardless of how much pasta you make, the sauce serves at least 8 people. My husband and I will be eating off of it all week.
I like how versatile this is. I used the pasta and veggies I had on-hand. I made the sauce as written except that I used all fat-free half-and-half instead of part milk. In place of the spinach and canned tomatoes I used a chopped green pepper (cooked with the onions) and chopped fresh tomatoes. Just be warned that juice from the tomatoes makes the sauce separate a little.
