This tasted great! I think I would like to try black beans in it next time, and some corn, like the submitter suggested. Great vegetarian meal. The only thing was it took mine about 6 more minutes to cook so that it wasn't soupy. I sprinkled a little more cheese on top when serving. Also, I only got 3 servings, not 4, for this as a meal. Thanks for a great lunch.

It was good, but there wasn't enough liquid, for the quinoa to get tender, so I ended up adding some chicken broth & cooking it longer. I also substituted canned, diced tomatoes, for the fresh. Next time, I may pre cook the quinoa & simmer together

I needed to use more Taco seasoning, and it may need some "crunch", like celery, or......?

Great!  I made a double recipe.  I only had 1 packet of taco mix so I used some fresh garlic and individual spices for the second pack of taco mix.  To make it very low fat, I just used olive oil spray initially, and used fat free sour cream and fat free shredded cheddar.  I didn't mix the cheese and sour cream in, but instead served this on soft tortillas, spread each tortilla with sour cream first then topped the mixture with shredded cheese and folded/rolled burrito-style. My husband loved it and said he'd be glad to eat it plain also--no tortilla and no sour cream and cheese either. I liked that it was low salt and we could make it very  low fat.  I added a diced yellow pepper.  Like another reviewed, I had to add extra water and extra time to the quinoa to get it to steam up fluffy.  We will make this regularly!  It was tasty and a nice choice for healthy "comfort food," and it was pretty quick and inexpensive, with mostly pantry staples on hand.
