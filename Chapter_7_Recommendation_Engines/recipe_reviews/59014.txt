Our 8 year old is crazy about Ancient Greece so we served this salad as part of a Greek dinner night.  He loved it and he is a very picky eater.  Enough taste that it isn't bland, but not overpowering.  We just used Ditali lisci pasta instead for kiddie interest.  Quite nice and easy to make.

I love olives but this recipe seemed too dry and I would definately cut back on the celery seed.

You really need to be an olive lover to enjoy this salad, and we are.  This is a nice new twist on a pasta salad, and loved the briny flavor that the olives bring to the salad.  I used Light Miracle Whip Salad Dressing, and added a little more than the recipe called for because it was a bit dry.  Would make this again.

I used to make a macaroni salad using pimento-stuffed olives, and threw in a hodge-podge of crunchy ingredients of varying tastes (it differed from time to time).  Other ingredients to add: green onions (white and green stalk), celery, chopped fine, bread and butter pickles, and fresh bean sprouts (these are surprisingly good in this salad,).  Dressing standard mayo/sour cream/ a little pickle juice, garlic salt, pepper and salt.  I sometimes added fresh green peas.  Somehow it all worked, and I had many requests for the dish at potlucks. The contrast of flavors and textures is wonderful!
