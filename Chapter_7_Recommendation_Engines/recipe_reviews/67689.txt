This is a really good recipe.  I will add some macadamian nuts or toasted sunflower seeds next time.  I also added too many chow main noodles and was a little hard to eat.  I used my new Geo.Forman grill for the chicken and it was a little tuff.  May try a marinade and slower cooking next time.  Overall, liked very much.

This salad was great!!!  I used a Creamy Poppysead dressing by wishbone and used some montreal seasoning when cooking the chicken.  Even my husband loved this, and he is not a "salad person"!

I wanted more of a restaurant style salad, so I altered it. I used a spinach blend, and I found a great oriental dressing (Bernstein's Light) The dressing had only 1.5 grams of fat, and was oh so tasty. I also used the Dole mandarin oranges, and La Choy rice noodles. Put in my big wooden bowl, and tossed. It was better than the what I've eaten out places. Great with any Asian cuisine.

It's good, but nothing too special.  Just another salad!  Had a hard time finding oriental dressing at my regular grocery store.

Excellent.  I made it with both snap peas and bean sprouts, and used a sesame ginger dressing. I'll make this often.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used an Asian Sesame dressing in place of some of the mayo, and it was absolutely wonderful

This is DELICIOUS! Try the Creamy Oriental Dressing found on this site. I used that as a baste for the chicken before I grilled it--YUM! I would also double up on everything; this makes a great main dish, but the original makes not quite enough for two hungry people. Definitely include the Green Onions too, they add a nice kick!

Good salad, easy to make.  We ate it as a meal but it need a little something to go with it maybe soup or something.

I omitted the chicken as I was using the salad as an accompaniment to another Asian entree.  I added toasted almond slices and a few thin slices of water chestnuts.  I also use Newman's Own Low Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing.  It turned out really good.
