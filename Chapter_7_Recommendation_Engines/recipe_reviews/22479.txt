A good dish, but I altered it some, and was able to make it MUCH MORE QUICKLY.

I used only 16 oz. sausage, and added the garlic and onion during the last few minutes of browning the meat to sautEe them all together.  I used a 28 oz. can of DICED tomatoes, undrained, and 1 full can of chicken broth.  Since these already have salt (and the sausage is flavorful enough), I didn't use ANY salt.  

I don't know why people bothered to complain of it being too spicy.  Couldn't they see that 1 t. each of black and cayenne peppper was WAY TOO MUCH?!?  So adjust the spiciness accordingly.  (I only used a dash of black pepper.)

The biggest change was that I didn't cook it in the oven.  I just left everything in the large skillet once mixed.  I brought it to a boil, then reduced the heat, covered it, and cooked it for about 15 - 20 minutes, until the rice was done and most of the liquid was absorbed.  It was a lot quicker this way, and I didn't have to add any extra liquid as some others had to do when using the oven.

We had this as a main dish, and everyone in my family really liked it.  I will definitely make it again, with the changes mentioned here, of course.

Based on the previous review, I also cooked this on the stove top.  Turned out great.  Also made the following changes: Used only 16 oz. ground sausage, used a can of Rotel (undrained), added a can of kidney beans, 1 carrot chopped, and 1 stick celery chopped.  Sauteed this all together then added the rice and broth.  Used almost 2 cups of broth.  Instead of cheyanne pepper, used a few dashes each of chili powder, ground red pepper, creole powder, black pepper, oregano and basil. Cooked it on low for about 30 minutes with the lid on.  Really good!

WOW!!! We loved this.  I took some advice and added a little more chicken broth, I also cut down on the cayenne pepper because we used hot sausage (it was still a little hot for some) but the recipe was out of this world.  I will be adding this to my regular menu.  Go Melissa!

Wonderful! This is definitely a keeper for me, there are so many ways to adjust the heat level -- use mild or hot sausage, a can of tomatoes or a can of extra hot Ro-Tel, omit or keep the cayenne (plus many possibilities in between!) I added a couple of stalks of diced celery to replace the red bell pepper, used a whole can of chicken broth, and made on top of the stove rather than baked in the oven. The leftovers were delicious for lunch the next day.

Great recipe, really flavorful.  I used mushrooms instead of bell peppers, and added only a pinch of black pepper. I used low-sodium broth, and I added 1 tsp of salt, which was perfect.  I also added a tsp of paprika and powdered ginger.  One thing I found was that the rice on top of the casserole tended to remain uncooked during the baking, so stirring it once or twice would help to cook all of the rice.  My family loved this!

I made this casserole-except I modified the cayenne pepper. One teaspoon seemed a bit excessive, so I only used 1/4 tsp. That seemed to give it just enough "kick" without being over the top.

Very delicious! Easy recipe using items I usually have on hand. I followed the directions of Bethany S and cooked it on the stovetop. I also added a can of red beans. It took about 35 minutes for the rice to cook and moisture to be absorbed. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good. I make it with brown rice - just check on it from time to time to make sure rice doesn't stick - you may need to add a little water until rice is cooked properly - but its yummy and nutrious.

Delicious and spicy!  I used only 16 oz. Bob Evans zesty hot sausage, 1 cup regular white rice instead of wild and a quart of home-canned tomatoes and it turned out well.  I also cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4 tsp, just to be safe and it was still quite spicy.  Picky hubby says it's a keeper, so it gets 5 stars!

I have been making this dish forever as one of my favorite "quick to make after work" meals.  But I use 5 minute rice instead of long grain.  I make sure the sausage is thawed in the fridge so that I can cook it quickly.  I almost always have sliced red peppers in my freezer.  When I put the sausage in a dutch oven to brown, I also chopped the peppers and a large onion and fry them all together.  Then I add the liquids and add a bit more water so that I can cook more rice (large family).  Bring to a boil, drop in the rice, cover, reduce heat and you're good to go in just over 5 more minutes.  Easy peasy!  I use the full tsp. of black pepper and just under a tsp. of cayenne, but then I'm using more rice, also.  Everything is cooked in the dutch oven on top of the stove.  One pan meal!

I used spicey italian sausage and added mushrooms and sweet cherry peppers (to counter the heat) and topped it with panko crumbs and shredded mozarella and parmesan cheese. It was a very tasty casserole.

Well, we thought this was great! I used only 1 lb of Bob Evans zesty roll sausage; brown rice; 1 red bell & 2 anaheims; crushed tomatoes (why crush them yourself?); extra broth due to brown rice; and I drastically reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. since I was using zesty sausage & anaheims. We thought this was very, very good, and I will make it again. When I make it again I'll add cumin and dried cilantro to make this more closely resemble a Mexican dish we once loved. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe which I've made a version of for years. Easy, quick and delicious. Using Jimmy Dean hot sausage, instead of 28 oz. I use one 16 oz. roll, increase rice to 1 1/2 c., use 28 oz tomato sauce and approx 1 1/2-2 c. broth to compensate for additional rice (4 1/2 c. liquid all together including tomato sauce). Also, I sub the cayenne pepper for 2-3 T. Texas Pete which provides a nice tang to the dish.

Very good!  I will admit.. was curious.  Had done a search of pork garlic rice and this was one of the results.  I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes and almost left it out, but made as recipe calls for except I used 1/2 of green/red peppers, 16 oz sausage, and a bit more onion than called for.  Cooking time was dead on and the flavors of everything worked well together.  Filling, easy to make, tastes good - it has made it into my 'permanent file'.  Edited:  To give 5 stars.  I've now made this 4 times, found the best sausage (for my tastes anyway) for it and have it down to a science.  I had originally given 4 stars, but it really needed to be changed to 5.

this is really very good.  I've made many rice/tomato casseroles but think this is the first time with "spicy" sausage.  It is a winner!  I did cut the pepper and cayenne a wee tad because I added one chopped (seeded) jalapeno.  I like spicy but I also like to be able to taste all the ingredients.  Used "hot" Italian sausages, decased and mashed.  I frequently do this type of meal on the stove top if I am in the kitchen for the cooking. The oven is reserved for when I can't be there and I let it cook by itself.  In both cases it is wise, as others have said, to stir once in a while and check on the liquid for the rice. Personal preference is a moist casserole - not gummy and dry. 
And best of all is freezing a couple of meals for those days when all you want to do is push one button for your supper.

I really liked this recipe -- but, like a previous reviewer said, it's really like a stuffing for stuffed bell peppers. I made quite a few modifications based on others' input. I used just over a pound of mild turkey sausage, 2 chopped chicken breasts and just one red pepper. I upped the chicken broth to 2 cups and used 2 bags of "boil in a bag" whole-grain rice. I used a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes and an entire onion. I ended up using about 1/4 tsp. each of cayenne, Ancho chile powder, chili powder, salt and pepper. I also threw in 2 chopped carrots and a can of red kidney beans. Soooo....basically I did a totally different recipe :) But this was a good starting point and obviously very versatile. For one meal, I rolled this into some burritos for dinner, then used more stuffing to make stuffed peppers the next day.

I've been making this since I first read the recipe.  I bring it to cook outs and pot luck lunches all the time.  Everyone loves it.  I use chourico (portugese sausage) instead of italian sausage and I add some red pepper flakes to spice it up even more.  I usually make 1 1/2 recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it's easy and incredibly tasty, but I did make some changes.  After reading the reviews, I was completely freaked out that this would be too spicy, so I used italian turkey sausage and a pound of ground pork instead of the spicy sausage.  This way I could turn up the heat myself and account for the fact that I'm a complete wimp when it comes to spicy foods.  I also used brown rice (which increased the cooking time) and made it on the stovetop in a cast-iron dutch oven.  Since I had two pounds of meat, I increased the broth and the rice to 1 1/2 cups each.  I did have some rice stick, but I think that was just my inexperience in cooking rice.  I stirred it often and did add some more chicken broth about halfway through.  I also threw in a can of drained mushrooms (but I would put mushrooms in my coffee if I could - ha!)  I look forward to making this again with different meats and veggies mixed in and I'm certainly looking foward to the leftovers for lunch today.  Great recipe!

I made a variation of this. I didn't have a green pepper (used a couple of carrot instead), didn't have pork sausage (used ground beef instead) and beef broth replace chicken. I'm a bachelor and love easy dinners - this was easy and tasted great.

What a versatile basic recipe!!  May be baked or done on stove top per a previous reviewer - which I did since it's August heat.  I only had 16 oz. roll of sausage to use so I added some leftover cut-up hot dogs and keilbasa near the end.  Not a big fan of cooked peppers so only added one green one.  A couple shakes of red pepper flakes in lieu of the cayene.  Also used about a quart or so of fresh cut up tomatoes from the garden (skinned first but left juice and seeds).  Everything cooked down wonderfully in 20 min.  Hubby ate 2/3 of it in one sitting! I had about 1 cup left for today and it's even MORE deliious...if that's possible.  So I'd say this may be made in advance then simply reheated

This reminded me of the spanish rice I make.  Was very good with the addition of the sausage. I didn't use real spicy sausage, but added a dash of cumin, chili powder, and a little extra garlic powder, couldn't find my cayenne pepper!  Very good will make again!

Thanks to the poster who made this on the stovetop - that did cut down on cooking time. To make it healthier, I used turkey hot Italian sausage (20 ounces) and a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes w/herbs. I used water instead of chicken stock and had to add a bit more than a cup to get the rice to cook through. This was tasty!

This was very good.  I did make a couple of slight changes.  Upon advice from previous reviewers I used the entire can of chicken broth to prevent dryness.  I also cut back on the amount of sausage.....only used a 16 oz package and used mild italian....we don't enjoy very spicy dishes.  Finally I used brown rice instead of long grain.  It turned out great.  I also froze half of it and plan on defrosting it this weekend to see how it turned out.  If it did well in the freezer this one will go in my once-a-month cooking recipe box.  Thanks Melissa!

Didn't really care for this.  To make this type of dish, in the future I'll stick with Cindy's Jambalaya.

This is very similar to a recipe that I make. I use 2 lbs Turkey Kilbasa (lower in fat than sausage) and I use canned diced tomatoes with green chilli's....Super yummy!

I made this last night for my family. After reading the reviews I made a few adjustments. Since my family does not like real spicy food I used one roll of Jimmy Dean hot and one roll of Jimmy Dean mild sausage. I did not have any red peppers and did not miss them. I chopped up an entire onion. Used about 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp of red pepper. I added a can of Buschs chili beans in sauce. I prepared the entire dish in my dutch oven on top of the stove. Brought everything to a boil and let it simmer for 20 minutes. It was really good.

Ok...I know I'll catch some flak for this but I was having one of those nights where I didn't know what to make for supper & this recipe seemed versatile enough to make with stuff I had on hand so here's what I did: For starters I only cook for 3 so I halved the recipe but next time I'll make a bit more because 1/2 makes rather skimpy portions for 3 people. The only thing I have that resembles sausage is bratwurst so I partially thawed 4 of them in the microwave, sliced them up & threw them into my dutch oven along with 1/4 chopped onion (1/2 slice just didn't seem like enough) & a generous handful each of chopped, frozen red & green bell pepper chunks (I get them on sale, cut the meat into chunks & freeze them. After they're frozen they break apart like a bag of frozen peas & are really easy to add to dishes like this one). Once the sausage etc. was cooked I threw in a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, a chunk of frozen, homemade chicken stock (about 1/3 cup) then, since I'd forgotten the garlic, I sprinkled on some garlic powder along with the pepper, a generous pinch of thyme, about 1/2 tsp chili powder (maybe a tad bit more) & a pinch of red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne. Brought it to a boil, stirred in 1/2 cup of rice & put the lid on the dutch oven before placing it in the oven for 30 minutes. Note: ALWAYS cover rice to cook it! A 9X13 pan can be covered with a double layer of foil & sealed tight, no peeking. We all liked it & I'll make it again.

Tasted just like a stuffed green peper, however the pepper was chopped up and mixed in.  I used minute rice and let it simmer, covered on the stove for 8 minutes (until rice was done).  Then moved it to a casserole dish to blend the flavors more.  Baked on 350, covered with foil for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 10.  Served with garlic bread.

This was good.  My only problem is that the rice burned in the pan, and I was stirring constantly.  I think next time I will not add the rice until I add the liquids, to keep it from burning.  Other than that, good recipe as is.

Having an early dinner tonight and I just finished this recipe using mild Italian sausage. The aroma is beyond belief and the spoonful I swiped is pure heaven. I'll share this one with daughter, working mom of 3, who is always looking for great casserole dishes with readily available ingredients. Well, this one surely fits that category!!  Thank you for sharing.

This was GREAT!  I only added a can of black beans and put shome cheese on top right before it was done.  Only took 40 minutes in my gas oven.  Will definitely make again.

Good basic recipe.  My picky 3-year old will eat it, and it's well-balanced.  I make a big batch of it, and freeze it in small batches, then thaw and bake for an easy after-work meal.

I wasn't a fan of this. Perhaps the sausage I used didn't add enough flavor or spice. My family liked it but I had made something similar with ground beef and a jar of salsa before, from another recipe that we all enjoyed a lot. So personally I would stick with that recipe over this one, but I hope anyone else who tries it has better luck than I did :)

This was really good.  The only thing I changed was that I used regular sausage because of my kids.  Other than that it was good.  The rice took a little longer than usual so I added a bit more water.  All in all it was good.

This was really good.  I agree with other reviewers that it tastes even better later.  I too, only used 16 oz sausage.  I didn't have spicy sausage and only used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and I thought it was still plenty hot.  I might even use less cayenne next time.  I loved it with a can of black beans, drained & rinsed, shredded carrot, finely diced celery, and used a 15 oz can of diced, undrained tomatoes, along with 1/2 tsp cumin and fresh cilantro.  I also used 2 cups of chicken broth and fire roasted red peppers instead of green and red bell peppers.  I only added 1/4 tsp of salt as there was enough salt in some of the other ingredients. I tried to make it on the stove top but I couldn't get all the rice to soften even though I stirred it often.  I ended up adding 1/2 cup more of broth and baking it for a half hour.  I think next time I would make the rice separate if I was trying to make it quicker.  Definitely worth a try and very tasty.

Based on the reviews, I cooked this on the stovetop with 16 oz hot sausage and a can of undrained Rotel. I had to add some cheddar cheese to the finished product, the dish seemed to be begging for it. It was pretty good, a nice change. We're from Texas, it was hot enough for us using hot sausage and Rotel.

Everyone really liked this after I made a few changes!
I like a little spice but this was way to hot!  I used mild saugage and then added one teaspoon of crushed red pepper!  I also added some more chicken stock as it cooked! I cooked it on top of the stove! It was easier that having to check the oven to make sure it wasn't getting dry! I am going to make it this weekend for about 18 people and I think I will do it in the oven!  It is delicious with less spice!  I couldnt even taste anything with the hot sausage! it has a great flavor with the mild and you can always add more pepper flakes if you want  a little more heat!

This was very tasty and good but pretty spicy so adjust according to taste.  The only think I found was that it took way longer than an hour in the oven for the rice to cook.  Probably closer to 1.5 hours.  I did not transfer mine to a 9x13 pan but instead kept it in the skillet and put that in the oven as my skillet is ovenproof.  I don't know if that made a difference as far as the cooking time.  I also had to add extra liquid to it before it was finally cooked enough.  But overall a very nice recipe.

This had a very good flavor, but my rice was still crunchy (my error). Next time I will follow the stove top method with more broth. I used hot sausage, but will probably add a pepper to it as I like things really Spicy!

this was a good recipe and would have been much better if the rice cooked.  I used brown rice to try to make it a bit healthier.  The rice did not cook at all in the hour baking time and with the amount of liquid used.  I had to put another 1.5-2cups of water back into the baking dish and rebake.  Tasted great but the rice just didn't cook.  Make sure you have enough liquid for the rice or don't use brown rice.

Made this for the first time today.  Used one roll of mild sausage and one of hot.  Added 1/4t red pepper flakes.  Omitted salt.  Added and extra 1/2c of broth.  Added some mushrooms I had as extra from another recipe, too.  

Dish came out spicy and hot.  Very good.  Husband - who hates spicy food - went back for seconds.  

Side note - this requires a large skillet.  I ended up transferring to a large stock pot to allow room for all the liquid.

So simple and everyone loved it.  

Instead of pork sausage, I used 1 lb of ground turkey and two links of Adell chicken chorizo, chopped. One person mentioned the high fat/calorie content and I think my version resolved that.  I did everything else according to directions, except I used a bit more chopped onion and a jar of Barilla marinara instead of the canned whole tomatoes.  I also left out the cayenne because I hadn't noticed it in the recipe.  I found that I didn't need it because the chorizo was pretty spicy.  However, if I had used it, I would have added 1/4 tsp since my daughter doesn't like food too spicy.  I told my boys they could just add Sriracha if they wanted it spicier!   

 I knew it would be dry if baked uncovered, so I baked it as directed, but covered it with foil.  It worked well and was done in about 50 minutes.  At that point, I topped it with some shredded colby jack, turned off the oven and put it back in for 5 more minutes.

Everyone had seconds and I will make this again.

Just finished this great dish.  Like other, I used 16oz sausage and two 14oz. cans of diced tomatoes.  The pan was a little small for all the recipe called for so I cut to rice down to 3/4 cup and didn't need the broth.  I did put a half cup of water in it near the end.  I also reduced the pepper and cayenne.  I covered it and cooked on the stove top.  Last, I topped it off on the plate with some grated sharp cheddar.  Dad said that made it perfect.

Mine was a little dry, even when I added a little water to it.  My kids decided to put some nacho cheese sauce on top, and it made it pretty good.  In fact my kids each had seconds.  That is unusual!

The major issue about this recipe was, for me, the sodium content.  1747 mg per serving?  That's an entire day's allowance.  To reduce this, I used low sodium broth and skipped adding salt altogether.  I put in a can of diced tomatoes and chiles, but I rinsed it off first to get rid of as much sodium as I could.    I doubled the amount of chicken broth and switched the pork sausage out for turkey, which is leaner.  I needed only a pinch of cayenne because of the chiles I'd already added, threw in a smidge of oregano and black pepper, and tossed in some okra for a cajun flair.  Good stuff.

Easy and yummy to make. Not the most exciting meal, but still very satisfying. I did use my left over spaghetti sauce instead of caned tomatoes.

This recipe is super easy! I didn't cook mine in the oven - I just did it on the stove top to shorten the cooking time. When it was was then I put it in a casserole dish -topped with the cheese  and then put it into the over until the cheese was melted! It turned out wonderful and everyone loved it!

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised at the good taste. The ingredients added up to, what I thought would produce an acceptable entree but the first bite tasted of a well balanced flavourful dish.

I followed some reviews & cooked it on the stove top.  I also reduced cayenne to 1/2 tsp & added 1/2 tsp of creole seasoning.  The whole family liked it!

I think this is a fine starter recipe.  The resulting sauce wasn't as think and tomatoey as I imagined, but I thought the proportions were right on.  I used lean turkey sausages, sliced; brown rice; and added a carrot.  To ease clean up and to better monitor the rice, I cooked it solely on the stovetop.  I think this recipe turned out well, it just isn't a dish I'd make for company and I am not looking forward to the leftovers.

I didn't really dig this.  It reminded me of the stuffing in a stuffed green pepper.  It was fine but too tomato-y.

I made this for Sunday nite football dinner and it was fabulous with a few changes. I didn't have ground sausage so I used spicy turkey habanero/green chile links, 2 fresh pasilla chile peppers and 2 tsp of chile powder and everything else. I cooked it on the stove top for 45 min. This is a real keeper. My husband loved it. Thank you

Delicious!  I did make the following changes...First, I used medium sausage and used the cayenne to adjust te spiciness to the level we like.  Second, I threw the onions and peppers in with the sausage up front so they would cook and get tender while the sausage was browning.  Then I threw the rice in with the tomatoes and the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I took the advice of several reviews and cooked the mixture on the stovetop for about 15 minutes covered, then baked it at 350 for 10 minutes, then I added a layer of shredded cheese and baked for another 10.  It reminds me of the stuffed green peppers I make, but in a casserole form.  Delicious!  Will definitely make it again!

Needs more liquid for the rice, and more sausage.  Also, try to put the rice on the bottom as opposed to scattered throughout.  We had some rice that was on top that didn't get enough liquid and was quite crunchy!  Great flavor though.

This is soooo good! My husband went on and on about it. I did as some reviewers suggested and simmered it on the stove top as opposed to the oven to shorten the cooking time because my husband was STARVING! I followed the recipe with the following modifications: I used mild Italian sausage, 2 cans of rotel with chillies, a pint of home-canned tomatoes, and 1/4 tsp of cayenne-- and it was hot. Next time I will use 1 can of rotel and a quart of tomatoes. It's really good as leftovers too (had some for breakfast!) 2 thumbs up for this recipe!!

This was really delicous. I used risotto and cooked it on the stovetop. I used almost a quart of chicken broth, adding more as it was absorbed, and it came out rich, creamy and with just a hint of spice. (I only used about 1/4 tsp of cayenne.) I used frozen pepper strips and only a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. My husband LOVED it. Just realized that the recipe called for breakfast sausage. I used chicken italian sausage (just 3 links) and it was perfect.

Very tasty, and smells SOOOOO good when it's cooking.  I used all red bell pepper (no green), and mild Italian pork sausage with about a 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes (instead of cayenne).  It had plenty of heat.  YUM!!

I was looking for a receipe to use up some bell peppers in my fridge when I stumbled upon this reciepe.  We thought it was great!  The only altering I did to the reciepe was to add some seasonings.  I added basil, oregano and garlic powder.  This casserole will definately be added in as a regular on our dinner table:) Thanks.

I also cooked this on the stove top, and used only one pound of pork. Although I didn't add either the cayenne or the black pepper, it was still VERY hot. My solution next time will be to use half regular pork and half spicy. The flavor was still good, even being a bit too spicy. And like I said, I did not add any spice!

I love this dish!  It is pretty spicy but very GOOD!  I have made it weekly since I found it.  I use extra chicken stock becasue it can dry out quickly if you don't take it out soon enough.  Also, we have tried it with cajun sausage links, cut up.  That way is awesome.

Great flavor - but way too much pepper!  Not sure if I made a mistake and put too much in.  Will definitely make again, but with less pepper.  Also could have used smaller amount of sausage.  I think this would also be good with ground beef.  I'll definitely make this again!!

Since trying this recipe my husband requests it frequently.  I personally used Jimmy Dean "hot" sausage.  Really good!

This is a tasty easy recipe that can be modified to suit your tastes. I used a package of Hillshire Farms bulk hot Italian sausage, an onion, an orange pepper, a few cloves of garlic, a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, a can of chicken broth and a cup of rice. I sautéed the sausage and veggies first, then drained off the fat. I added the rice and mixed it in. I drained the liquid from the diced tomatoes, added the can of chicken broth and then added enough water to bring the liquid total to two cups. I added that to the pan along with the tomatoes, spiced it with Cajun spice mix, cayenne and black pepper, then brought it to a boil. Then I turned down the heat to simmer, put a cover on and let it cook, stirring occasionally. It probably took 20-25 minutes. My husband and I both enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

Nice easy dish made with ingredients we usually have on hand. I halve the recipe (since I am cooking for two people) using 12-16 oz sausage. If we have hot sausage, we use a 14 oz. can of plain diced tomatoes. If it is regular sausage, we use a can of tomatoes with green chiles. Very adaptable. I do like other reviewers suggested and simmer on the stovetop covered for 20-30 minutes until rice is done.

This is good. A great little busy night casserole. Used brown rice and one pound of sausage. Tastes like a stuffed pepper and it's filling, deconstructed.

It was good, had some kick, but too tomato-y for us.  Made for a different dish, but not something we will make again.

Very good flavor.  Good with modifications written by first reviewer.  Will definitely cook on stove-top next time, halve the amount of sausage to reduce the fat, not add extra salt, and try to fit in extra veggies.  I will probably use sweet sausage instead of spicy but it wasn't too bad spice wise.  My husband loved it.  I might add twice as much rice and broth next time b/c it was very meaty.

He loved it! Used 2 cans diced tomatoes undrained w/out salt, 1.5 cups broth, 16 oz sausage, short grain rice instead of long and that way it only took around 45 mins to cook. And only one large green pepper.

Just made this for dinner, and it was superb. Only had 16 ounces of sausage but would definitely recommend the full amount for next time. Used only one bell pepper and added 1 1/2 cups fresh mushrooms. As per previous reviews I subbed diced tomatoes for the whole, reduced the cayenne and pepper to a pinch of each, and only used 1/2 tsp salt. I also cooked it the whole time on the stove just to make things easier. This was a super easy, quick meal to make, and I loved that I had everything on hand already. Definitely a keeper, especially for when I'm short on time. Thanks!

My family loves this recipe!! I made it exactly as is except for cutting back on the cayenne pepper. I have one suggestion for everyone who says the rice is not cooked or is crunchy which is how mine turned out the first two times I prepared the dish. I now cover my pan with aluminum foil when baking in the oven. The dish has come out perfect every time since then and is always done in the one hour baking time. Hope this helps everyone who loves this dish as much as we do.

I made this and the whole family liked it.  I forgot to get spicy sausage and didn't remember the recipe called for 28oz of sausage.  I only had one "tube" of Jimmy Dean so I made the dish with this reduced amount of sausage and used a regular size can of diced tomatoes.  I used brown rice and stired it a couple of times while it baked.  I did not have any problems with the consistency.  I actually preferred baking it because it took just a few minutes to cook the sausage and veggies and then I could just throw everything else together and put it in the oven and do other things while it baked.

Great dish, really tasty.  I added some heat with hot curry powder and two serrano peppers.  I did about 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I only used one bell pepper and added lots of mushrooms.

This was okay, but I didn't feel like it was stellar.  It was nice that it was economical and simple, but a few adjustments are definitely needed.  For one thing, the 1 teaspoon of cayenne has to be a typo!  I used just half teaspoon after reading a few reviews and even that was too spicy.  I would recommend an 1/8th.  Also, I parboiled the rice for 8 minutes in the microwave with chicken stock first which really cut down on the cook time.  It only needed to be in the oven for 35 mins done this way.  Also, like other reviewers, I kept mine in an oven-proof skillet instead of transferring to another dish--much less clean up.

This was really very good and easy to prepare.  Cut down on the cayenne because my  husband is not fond of spicy foods.  I will par boil the rice first as it was still chewy after the required baking time.  Looking forward to making it again.

Loved this recipe as did my family.  I too had a problem with the rice not being fully cooked and will leave it in the oven next time for 90 minutes as a previous reviewer suggested.  I also may cut down a bit on the cayenne pepper.  My niece said it reminded her of eating a stuffed pepper.  Will definitely make again.

Have tried many recipes from this site but this is the best one yet!!  Easy one pot meal with ingredients I normally have on hand.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 since there are only two of us and it turned out GREAT!! I did as others suggested and added a little more chicken broth, used diced tomatoes instead of whole, chicken sausage (to make it healthier and a just a little chile pepper flakes to spice it up). It was perfect.   YUMMMY!!

Used hot sausage just a lb, doubled the onions(we love them), substituted ground garlic for cayene & added parsley(because I put parsley in almost everything).  Put cayene on the table 'cause some like it hot.  So good made another recipe for the freezer for busy pre-holiday days.  Thanks for sharing

This was delicious, but you do need to adjust the liquid slightly, and I recommend stirring the dish at least twice while baking so that the rice on top gets enough liquid to cook thoroughly.  Super tasty!!

It was ultimately delicious.  HOWEVER, I cooked it exactly according to directions for 4 servings.  The rice was totally raw after baking 1 1/2 hours so we had to order out Chinese that night.  The next night I added a lot more broth and cooked it another 1 1/2 hours, until the rice was barely tender, and we all enjoyed it - finally.

Very yummy. Served with some cornbread. Didn't have any cayenne pepper so subsititued some chilli powder. Used 2 pounds of chicken sausage instead of pork. This recipe makes quite a bit, I would say more than six servings. Half would have been plenty and left leftovers for my boyfriend and me. Had a little trouble getting the rice cooked all the way. Next time will at least partially cook the rice before adding in.

I read some of the other reviews before making this and because I have 4 kids i tried to eliminate a bit of the heat in this.  I used regular ground pork and seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt and a small pinch of cayenne while cooking.  I added only half a green pepper and half a red and i added sliced mushrooms to the recipe.  I used about half the amount of cayenne requested.  I also double the amount of rice and broth. This turned out very good and although the dish still had a bit of a kick to it, it wasn't enough that the kids complained it was too hot.

I used whole sweet italian sausage fried  then slice into 1/2 inch slices and a little more chicken broth, it was perfect, not to spicey and the sausage  had a lot more flavor than the ground up type everyone loved it .

I used 16oz of sausage, and was concerned that the rice would overtake the sausage, but it was a perfect balance.  DEFINITELY add more chicken broth.  I think 2 cups is a more reasonable measure.  I used spicy sausage, about a tsp of chili powder, no black pepper or cayenne, and it was perfectly spiced to my taste.

Very very good! I used 12 oz link spicy sausage and sliced it. I also used about 1 1/2 cups of rice instead of just one cup and a little more chicken broth. Turned really good. Almost like the arroz con pollo from this site!

Great recipe!  It is very spicy but because Im a "spicy dish lover" I was very happy with the recipe.  I took other reviewers suggestions and cooked this on the stove.  After putting all the ingredients together, I covered the pan and let simmer for about 20 minutes so the rice could cook, then served.  I also used one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  Its less than the recipe calls for but honestly, I didnt even miss it.  It was perfect just the way I made it.  You really cant eat a lot of this in one sitting since its so heavy but that only means theres left overs!  So easy and ingredients you always have hand.  Definite keeper!

This was good recipe and I highly recommend it.  It is flavorful and easy to make.  I have a hard time not changing a recipe and adding more spices but I read the reviews on this and so many said it was good just the way it is.  So I added nothing.  However I did omit a couple of things and it still turned out delicious.  I only used 1 lbs of hot breakfast sausage.  And because the sausage is so hot I used only 1/4 tsp of each of black and cayenne pepper.  My husband isn't crazy about a powerful bell pepper taste so I omitted those as well.  I put in a cup of brown rice and I cooked the whole thing in a Dutch oven on the stove top.  I served it to company last night and got wonderful reviews.   We discussed how versatile this recipe is.  It makes a lot so you can use your imagination for the leftovers, quesadilla filling, add it to broth for a spicy soup, use it as a side dish or have it again just as it is.  YUMMY!

My husband LOVES this recipe! It is actually his favorite dinner.  I made a few changes to the recipe: less sausage, normally 16-20 oz one small onion diced only 1 bell pepper (sometimes a half) added mushrooms less cayenne pepper rotel instead of whole, peeled tomates Most of the time, this requires a little more liquid to cover the rice, so I just use water. DELICIOUS!

Loved this dish. I changed it a bit for the crowd by leaving out the onion and tomatoes and peppers but I added a frozen package of mixed vegetables and it tasted just fine.

Loved this! I cut down on the cayenne when I made it, only because some of the people who would be eating it don't do spicy foods ... it was amazing! A definite keeper. I will try it in a Dutch oven next time just to see what the difference would be.

This was very good, family loved it.  But, like others, I cooked completely on stove top using a dutch oven.  Mixed everything in after browning the sausage, covered, and simmered for about 30 minutes.  Turned out great!

This makes a lot! Very economical dish. I used turkey sausage from fresh meat case to cut down on fat calories. I used my electric frying pan, and followed other reviewer's suggestions for cutting down on cooking time, and it worked perfectly in 20 min. Used only 1/8 tsp cayanne, and next time I would leave out black pepper. Also, very tomatoey flavor using diced..next time I might use 2 14oz  cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead.

This recipe was okay.  We thought that it tasted a lot like Spanish rice, which isn't quite what we were expecting.  I put a bit of Lisano salsa on it, which changed the flavor a bit.  We didn't dislike this recipe, but probably won't make it again any time soon.

This was good. I made it ahead of time and just put it in the oven when I got home. I used vegetarian "sausage" and it worked fine. I did add a little bit more chicken stockduring cooking time, to cook the rice, but I think it would have been okay if I hadn't drained the diced tomatoes I used. I took another reviewers advice and mixed in black beans and added cheese on the top towards the end. I kept wishing I had added olives too! Thanks! This is a keeper! Kids ate too. (6 and 8 yrs old)

If you don't like spice, don't make something with "spicy" in the title!! Spice can be controlled by cutting back or not adding the last few spices!!   **I needed this to go further, so I added an extra cup of rice and an extra cup + of broth.   **I had a few cups of basmati rice and used this, I cooked in pan about 15 minutes, and oven cooked for only 30 minutes and IT WAS DONE!  I added a little more moisture, because I added extra rice too...and it was moist and wonderful - maybe the lighter weight basmati rice was the key to not having to overcook it.   **my hubby melted a little processed cheese that starts with a "V" and that was WONDERFUL - I could do without the extra calories however!

I took the recommendations of others and just cooked this on the stove top.  Quick and easy, and I tossed in what I had on hand, red peppers, corn, etc...  I did leave out the salt and glad that I did.

Simple, easy to make, and I was pleased with the results.  I used a red pepper, spicy chicken sausage, and a 5 oz. package of yellow rice.  I also added one can of black beans.  It came out great and not dry -- exactly as I wanted it so I am glad I used a little less rice.  I used to casserole dishes that I sprayed a little Pam in first before baking.  Thanks!

The cooking process totally dried out the sausage and was not favorable to cooking rice because it took about 1 hour and half to cook it.  By the time it was cooked, the sausage was dry and the veggies were mushy. Not to mention that the combination of ingredients was not tasty.  My fresh sausages deserved a better ending.

I love this recipe, my husband loves it more, and we use it all the time! I can never find ground sausage at the supermarket, so I pick different sausages each time, cook them, and cut them up to add. My husband really likes the spiciness, but it's a little hot for me and some of our guests, so I like to serve it with plain yogurt - so yummy!

Very easy to make but we found it to be waaaaay to salty.  I cut the recipe in half but kept the full cup of chicken broth since so many reviewers suggested increasing the broth.  It came out perfectly.

This is a great recipe.  I ended up halving the recipe for 2, and used 1 lb of hot sausage, still used 4 cloves garlic, no bell peppers, a half can of chicken broth and no cayenne.  Next time (especially if I don't halve the recipe) I will use a whole can of chicken broth.
Probably I'll add some tomato sauce as well to give it just a little more sauce.  Otherwise its crumbly and harder to eat.  Still loved it though!

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  There's some prep time, but then you can put it in the oven and forget it for an hour.  Next time we make it we're going to try it with gnocchi instead of rice....more Italian that way!  Oh, and if  you use spicy sausage, it's a very spicy dish!

This is great stuff. I added 1/2 c. extra chicken broth and didn't drain the tomatoes. I love it exactly as it is. I love spicy foods but my family doesn't, so I'll definately cut back on the cayenne next time I make it.

Everyone in my home enjoyed this. I cut down the spice and used at least 3 cups chicken broth. I used a pack of Bob Evans sausage and a small can(15oz.) of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano. Dash of pepper and cayenne. Very good for something different.

Great dish, I tweaked a bit & cooked on stovetop based on reviews. First, I used spicy Italian chicken sausage (& wow was it ever spicy!!). In addition to a red pepper, small onion, garlic & a can of Rotel, I added 1 stalk finely chopped celery and some matchstick carrots. Added 1 c. white rice & 2 c. low sodium chicken broth. Did not use cayenne but a little black pepper. Cooked for about 20 min til rice was cooked. Delish! Super spicy - may try a different brand of chicken sausage next time. Good excuse to splurge on a glass of chocolate milk though! Nice to have something out of the ordinary :)

Based on other reviewers comments I cut back on the spice but not enough. I omitted the pepper but I should have cut the cayenne in half as well. We all love heat but we could barely eat it. I made another batch of plain rice and added that in and then it was great. Yummy comfort food. Will definitely make it again with the adjustments. Thanks for the great recipe.

spicy - I used two regular sausage packages and one hot and it was plenty hot for my family.  Good on chips or in tortilla shells with cheese.

i was looking for something to make bf for lunch and found this.. i'm glad i read the reviews, especially BETHANY S.'s.. i used 16 oz kielbasa for the sausage.. upped the rice to 1.5 cups.. only had 1/2 of a green bell pepper so i added 1.5 cups of frozen peas and carrots.. used two cans of fire roasted tomatoes.. 3 cups chicken broth (bouillon).. and subbed Creole Seasoning Blend (on this site) for the salt, black pepper, and cayenne.. like BETHANY S., i just cooked this on the stove top.. a lot easier and cooler than turning on the oven.. ty for the start of something good

Tried this and it's was very good. I personally thought it was quite spicy. My husband and son loved it. Next time I think I will try it with the sweet sausage.

Very simple.   I altered it a little because we like Rotel diced tomatoes with red and green chillies. That emanates the need for red and green peppers. It's a very simple and fast dish that's perfect for a cold day.

I thought it looked to mild so I got spicy andouille sausage, ditched the salt and added white pepper instead, and instead of white rise I used brown rice for less carbs. Found that I needed to pull it out of the oven at least 10 minutes early compared to quoted time to prevent over cooking.With these modifications I loved it, and continued to add more spice where I saw fit.

Love it and so did my family.  Made it on top of the stove in the skillet the way Bethany S. made it, which really shortens the preparation time.  You just have to make sure the rice doesn't suck up all the broth, be ready to add more if necessary. There are a lot of great suggestions in the reviews!!!

This seems like it would be a good recipe for a crockpot.   I am doing this tonight with spicy italian sausage.   So good.  I add a little extra broth and did it on the stove top the 1st time.  Tastes great.

An absolutely wonderful dish..........but 1 TSP EACH BLACK AND CAYENNE PEPPER IS WAY TO MUCH!!!!!!!!.  A dash of each is plenty. My family had a little trouble breathing when I made it following the proportions exactly.

Great recipe. I used hot Italian Chicken sausage, dice tomatoes and a whole can of low sodium chicken broth. Substituted the rice with Trader Joe's Brown Rice and Vegetable Medley (barley and radish seeds add a nice crunch.) Kept the cayenne as is, love the heat! A little healthier and still very tasty dish.

i gave it five stars because i did a little customizing. I used regular pork sausage and added chorizo to make it little more spicy. I also added some smoked sausage cut in bite size pieces. Also fresh mushrooms. This is almost like a jambalaya dish. I dont believe in measuring in most cases especially with casseroles. So I cant tell you how much of each I added

I don't know what I did wrong, if anything, but I did not care for this at all.  No one in my family would eat it.  Too many peppers in the recipe would be the consensus vote in my family.

Very good! I used 28 oz Johnsonville sausage - 1/2 mild and 1/2 hot, home canned crushed tomatoes - 32 oz,brown rice and 2 cups of chicken broth. Cooked it on stove, it took twice as long for the rice to cook, but so easy!  I left out the cayenne for the kiddos, but there was still enough kick for everyone else.

My entire family liked this dish.  I followed a couple other reviewers and added extra tomatoes (I used diced and crushed) and let it cook on top of the stove.  I also couldn't find my cayenne pepper so I used my crushed red pepper which gave it the spicy zip.  I left out the chicken broth and salt because the canned tomatoes had enough sodium and liquid.  Overall the flavor was really good and I'm not a big fan of pork.

I made a few changes to the recipe. I have 2 small children and they can't really handle spicy foods. So I used 2 packages of Hilsire Farms beef smoked sausage and op'd out on the red and green peppers.

I used whole wheat minute rice instead of the long grain uncooked. I continued to follow the recipe as advised until the baking time. I baked uncovered for 20 minutes and added 2 cups of sharp finely shredded cheddar cheese.

This turned out amazing! However next time I will skip out on adding additional salt as the smoked sausage has more sodium than what I thought. Delicious!

I would have loved it as is I'm sure...but alas, I have kids to cook for so spicy food is out!  However, I did make it very similar to this, only I didn't have long grain rice so I used arborio, and I used honey garlic sausage, not spicy, and I used diced tomatoes.  Turned out perfectly, whole family loves it :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Spicy and tasty.  We enjoyed it.  I used 16 oz regular ground sausage.  I cooked 1 cup white rice in 1 can of chicken broth and then mixed it with the sauteed veggies and sausage.  I then added only 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  Baked in oven for 30 minutes.  Still a little bit liquidy from the can of tomatoes but the rice was cooked well and it was tasty.   Shared half the dish with my friend and they topped it with cheese and wrapped it in tortillas.

Great recipe. I'm sure that it is fine to make as is, tho I made some changes... mostly for personal preferences.   Ingredient changes: I left out the peppers (mom is allergic) I used mild sausage  (don't like spicy) I used less salt (1/2 tsp for 4 servings), pepper (1/2 tsp for 4 servings), and cayenne (1/4 tsp for 4 servings)  as some of the fam doesn't like too much spice.   Other changes: Because I got lean sausage, there was no need to drain and I was able to add the onions and garlic to the sausage before it was done browning so the onions could be even softer. I added the seasonings at this stage so it had direct contact with the sausage and onions. I also I added the broth with rice because there was no liquid in the pan, therefore, I needed to add more broth later to make up for what evaporated in those 5 min.   This was a hit with everyone - thanks for the recipe!

Woo! This was spicy! But I believe this was user error. Great taste, but I will definitely try a different type of sausage next time. I used Logan's hot chorizo and even for me ( I loooove spicy food) it was way too hot. Wonderful and easy otherwise.

I try to not revise recipes when I make them the first time, but I broke that policy with this recipe.  I had already purchased chicken sausage from Sunflower Market and had that on hand.  My husband stated he didn't feel like rice so I substituted Rice Pilaf (okay, so it is still rice!) and made the rice with chicken broth.  We didn't have alot of time so I made everything on top of the stove and mixed in a large sauce pan instead of baking it as a casserole.  It was very good and I will make it again.  Also, I reheated leftovers in the microwave with some grated Mexican mix grated cheese.  Really good!

Was cooking this when my son came into the house.  His comment was "Mom that smells good".  After eating it his comment was "good job".  I found this recipe very easy to cook and the taste was great.

This was really really good.  I used mild italian sausage that I cooked and then cut up into chunks.  I am adding this recipe to my regular rotation! YUMMY! Leftovers were great too.

This dish was very easy to prepare and cook and packed with flavor.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to cook this on the stovetop.  I made the following revisions:  I used 16 oz. hot Italian venison sausage and sauteed the onion and garlic with the meat.  I added 1 chopped cubanelle pepper, an 8 oz. pack of fresh mushrooms, a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 can of chicken broth and 1 cup uncooked rice.  After bringing to a boil, I covered the pan and simmered for 20 minutes.  The rice was still not done, so I needed to cook for an additional 10 minutes. I found there to be way too much rice, so next time I will scale back to 1/2 cup and 1 cup of broth. Thanks for the recipe and all of the helpful reviews!

This was fantastic! I used a mix of sweet and hot sausages and 2 red peppers, and omitted the cayenne. The cooking time was too long, after 30 min it was done and the crust dry. The rice on top did not cook, but became chewy (not a bad thing, but would mix half way through the cooking time). Great recipe.

I used a hot sausage from a local butcher and added a medium onion, diced, I used the whole 14 ounce can of chicken broth and added a 6 ounce can of sliced mushrooms and this was the best recipe. Just spicy enough. I loved it. I cooked everything in my large cast iron dutch oven and kept it in there and baked it in the oven. What a wonderful recipe. I will make this again.

My family thought this was good, just an okay meal.  I cooked on stovetop as others recommeded.  If I try this again I will buy fresh ground sausage from butcher and add maybe beans and more garlic and more spices.

This turned out great! Everyone loved it. Basically followed the directions given, used a bit less sausage and a pinch of crushed red pepper in place of the cayenne pepper. It cooked in the oven a little less than an hour. I covered the top with a can of French fried onions. Delish!

Unfortunately, I have to rate this a 3 (which I don't do often).  I cut the recipe in half since it was just hubby and I and used turkey sausage since I didn't have any hot italian.  Like others, I opted to cook this on the stove which worked really well.  The downfall was that this was extremely hot and we love spicy food.  I purposely left out the black pepper and just used the cayenne, but wow, this was way too hot.  On the plus side, great combo of ingredients and easy to prepare.  Thanks!

It was good, but really really spicy. Even when I used mild sausage, it was still pretty spicy. Next time I'm going to cut back on some of the spices. And with the sausage I definitely don't think it needed salt, so I'm going to majorly cut back on the salt. But overall it was really good and my kids just drank lots and lots of water with their dinner.

Awesome receipe!  my family loves it!  I took the advice and cooked it on the stove - but since my family likes the bit of "crust" when its baked, I transferred it to a 13x9 pan, sprinkled lightly with some parmesan, and baked it for about 10 min more to get a crust to the top.

This is really good.  My kids weren't crazy about it, but hey, they're picky about anything with peppers or onions in it.  I used 16 oz turkey sausage and brown rice and cooked it on the stovetop.  I did use a little more liquid also.  Oh, only 1/2 teaspoon each of pepper and cayenne.  It was spicy enough for me.  Hubby and I liked it a lot.

We also made it on the stove.  Browned the onion, garlic & pepper with regular bulk sausage, then added 2 cans of Rotel and the chicken broth, and simmered until rice was done.  Makes a delicious, quick & easy ONE POT supper!

I must admit, I am quite the whimp when it comes to spicey foods. My husband puts hot sauce on about EVERYTHING I make! Not on this dish though! The taste was fabulous. I was able to tough it out as far as the heat factor goes. If you don't care for spicey things, just decrease the amount of cayanne. Scrumptious! Thank you for sharing!

Really great recipe. I added a bit less cayenne and it had just the right amount of spice. I used andoulle sausage. My husband and I both thought it was great (and easy)...will definitely be keeping this one!

A little too spicy for me, but still a good recipe.  Very easy to prepare - I put it together in a casserole in the morning on a day I had to work late, and my husband put it the oven when he got home.  Will make again with less cayenne.

This is an excellent spicy dish.  Very easy to make, and it makes a lot for leftovers.  I took others advice and doubled the chicken stock and it was just the right amount of moisture.  It took 1/2 an hour longer to cook than the recipe stated.

This recipe was so flavorful. I made 2 changes - I used 3/4 can of Hunt's tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes and also used instant brown rice instead of long grain.  It came out awesome and very easy to put together.

Too hot for my 4yr old, but the hubby loved it.  I would add more liquid next time, also, as it did tend to dry out.  It's a keeper!
