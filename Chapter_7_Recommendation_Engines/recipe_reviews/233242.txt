Refrigerated the marshmallow, cranberry, sugar mixture for about 6 hours, and it had solidified.  There was no way, Iâ€™d be able to stir in the apples, grapes & walnuts, so I popped it in the microwave for two 10-second intervals just to soften slightly...it worked.  I was able to then fold in the fruit and whipped cream, and it did end up tasting pretty good.  Think this would be a good Holiday dessert.

This is a Thankgiving tradition! Everyone gobbles it up quickly.  You can use less cranberries to cut back on the tartness. We use pecans, instead of walnuts.  We don't cook ours. Just mix the ground cranberries, sugar and half of the marshmallows and let sit, in fridge, overnight. 
Next day we just add everything else.  *Warning: it's best to drink water or unsweetened tea with this salad. If you take a drink of something sweet and then take a bite of this salad, it will definitely make you pucker from the tartness!!*

Loved it for Christmas dinner! I would cut the grapes into fourths, though. Be sure to plan ahead to refrigerate the cranberry mixture. Not one to make in the summer. It is hard to find cranberries then,

I had to use more cream. Overall, it was so good, I was lucky to have enough to take to a pot luck.
