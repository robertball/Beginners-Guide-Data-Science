This is exactly what I was looking for.
You probably want to use more than 2 1/2 cups of fruit, if you are going to have a 9 inch pie. I'd say 4 cups, at least, as they cook down. The only things I did differently are that I added about 1-2 tsp Cinnamon AND did a pre-treat on my peaches with Ever Fresh (or Fruit Fresh). Just added about 3 tablespoons to a large basin of water (large enough for 15-20 pounds of peaches). I also added 1 tsp. Ever Fresh per cup of sugar (I use a lot of estimating in my kitchen) in this recipe. I was working on a much larger scale than this recipe called for. My plan is for using this 'filling' for much more than just pie. I don't want to have to freeze this in a pie plate, so I don't want the fruit to brown when I thaw it. Will be using it for fruit topping on pancakes, cobbler, pie, and anything else I can think of. Very versatile recipe! Thanks!
SIDENOTE: I did bake up one pie. It's nice. Wished I would have had a top crust and used a smaller pie plate. You live and learn.

UPDATE: I used this recipe to make Peach cobbler while camping. I used the Peach cobbler VI recipe. I received RAVES from the camping buddies. Used in place of the peaches & spices in the other recipe.

AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME PIE:) I wouldnt be cooking if I didnt alter it at ALL though-i just cant leave well enough alone lol. SO as previously suggested up the peaches to 4 cups, toss in lemon juice to prevent browning-no need to buy fresh fruit preserver. I also threw in a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla(I know-such exact amounts)and 1/2 tbs more of cornstarch and tapioca just because I uped the amount of peaches.

I didn't exactly make this into a pie.  I had an overabundance of sweet peaches and since I made pancakes this morning, I didn't have any honey or syrup to put on them so decided to make this.  Since the peaches I had were very sweet, I only used 1/2 cup sugar and 1:1 white/brown.  I also added a dash of cinnamon and cooked it up on the stove.  It set up nicely and tasted delish on whole wheat pancakes.  Thanks for the nice addition to my breakfast!  I love the concept of this recipe.  Great for on the go.

Awesome simple recipe.  I froze the filling maybe a month ago and baked a pie with little to no fuss today.  One suggestion though... the pie crust I usually use is a pate brisee and it has some sugar in it, so... the extra baking time required to thaw and heat the filling made the edges of my crust VERY brown by the 20 minute mark.  I covered them with foil to finish baking, but I would have done better to have covered them from the beginning.  Hope this helps someone!

What a fantastic idea...I used 4 cups peaches for the 9" pie pan and added a crumb topping when I baked the pie. I also added 1 tsp. Fruit Fresh right to the sugar mixture, and the peaches didn't brown at all. My family raved about this, so I will be making a few more to have in the freezer for this winter. I will also try this with apples. Thnaks for the recipe.

Good. basic peach pie filling.  You will need to use about twice the filling recommended to fill a 9" pie.

I searched through the site looking for a recipe for peach pie. I had looked at the cans of peach pie filing at the store and balked at $3.00 a can, and two were needed (and they are heavy on the syrupy filling and light on pieces of fruit.) I bought canned peaches in light syrup and drained them to make this recipe. It is perfect - lots of peaches in the pie with the right seasonings and thickeners.

I had 6 cups of sweet peaches. I doubled the cornstarch and tapioca, added only 1 cup sugar and 3 tsp fruit fresh. I divided it and froze it in containers. However, I kept a little over 1 cup out. This morning I cooked it stove top slowly adding water (about 1/2 cup). I made pancakes, spread them with softened cream cheese and topped with the peaches. They were delicious. I think I may do try this as a cheese cake topper.

We prepared exactly as the recipe said, and it was a perfect peach pie! The filling had just the right consistency, and when prepared with a ready made, refrigerated crust, it's the easiest homemade dessert! I'm about to make a second one!

Love this recipe!   Easy to put into the freezer and pull out, then pop into premade pie crusts.     Everyone who tasted this thought it delicious.  A couple friends have prepared peach pies this way after tasting this.

Easy recipe but does not need the nutmeg (detracts from the peach flavour). I also used only 1/2 cup sugar for about. 4 cups of peaches.

very good flavor, frozen for about 6 weeks before baking. The crust didn't get done on the bottom especially. Think next time I will leave it on 450* longer than called for. Maybe because filling was frozen is the reason for longer baking time. I like dough anyway it comes, so not a problem for me

This recipe is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!  Incredible in taste and incredible in being so simple!  The only thing that I would change would be to add more peaches.  I just felt it was more gel (after the tapioca melts down) than actual fruit.  I'll definitely double it next time.  Otherwise, taste is excellent!!

I made this right away instead of freezing it and it was wonderful!  I added about 1/2 -1tsp. vanilla and a crumb topping.  It was a hit.  I also have some in the freezer so hopefully baking from totally frozen will be good as well

I have never made peach pie filling before.  We had an abudance of fresh peaches, so I looked for a recipe and found this one.  It was very easy to make and tasted delicious!  I made mine with about 3 cups sliced peaches.  I will certainly make this again.

I found the most luscious peaches at Trader Joe's yesterday.  I just processed two frozen pies and six mini pies.  One will be for the 4th of July...the rest, I will pull out of the freezer as I need them.  Hat tip to my friend, Becky, for teaching me this trick.

The taste was pretty good but did use more tapioca & cornstarch others suggested. This sure was easy to make into a pie since the work was done & in the freezer.  The problem I had was I thought it was frozen when I took it out of the pan to put into the freezer bag & it wasn't as solid as I thought so ended up with a mess dripping down the freezer walls. When I went to bake things were fine, except it took so much longer.  I'd say when I turned it down to the 350 it actually baked for more than an hour total.  Will make again & see how it goes then.

Excellent.  But I made the first one with 2.5 cups of peaches and it was not enough filling.  Made a second with about 4 cups and that seemed much better.  I was using a regular glass pyrex pie pan and not a deep dish one.

This is a brilliant idea!!

Like others have said, I would double the amount of filling.

I'm wondering if I could use frozen fruit in this recipe (if it's all I have)...or would refreezing it be a problem?  Any ideas?

It needs to bake longer  at 350 degrees than the recipe indicates.  Probably added another 20 minutes to the baking time.

Looks and smells great. Followed the recipe, but increased the peaches to 4 large per pie dish. In the freezer they go...

Fantastic & easy! I haven't baked a pie yet but can't wait till the winter and pull out the peach filling to make a pie.

This is a great recipe. I made the mistake of using peaches that werent as ripe as they could have been so my filling was quite tart. Next time I'll be using fully ripened peaches!

I placed the frozen peaches into my prepared 10 " pie crust. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes and then lowered temp to 375. Took a total of 2.5 hours to fully bake and cooked all over my oven. I won't be doing this ever again!

I absolutely loved the peach filling! I made little peach pies using it, and instead of minute tapioca, I used  an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. I also added some cinnamon. I will without a doubt make this again.

I made changes, in that we had a diabetic in the house!  It was served, telling the company that I had (10 people in all)!  We had two pies made with sucralose and anyone could have Yasso yogurt bars who didn’t want the pie!
It was delicious!

No changes. Excellent pie. Quick, easy, and delicious! Will probably be my go to recipe from now on.

I wanted to make a pie that was not very sweet and not too runny. This was the pie for us my Hubby loved it! Oh yeah, I didn’t have any heavy cream so I used coconut milk on the top.

The only thing I changed was by adding cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Delicious!

A great recipe to use the peaches from our peach tree. I used 4 cups peaches and might use more next time. It was easy to make and delicious to eat! Thanks!

I use home grown peaches and apple pies with this recipe. I can cut down on sugar because they are naturally sweeter. I’ forgot a pie for over a year in the freezer and it still turned out good! I usually make 9” and  pot pie size pies, tonight I’m wrapping the small one in a store bought puff pastry, perfect for 2-3 people.

This turned out great. I added a little lemon juice. The peaches did not turn brown at all. I would have liked a little more filling, so next time I will add more peaches and adjust the ingredients. I got rave reviews from my mother and sister who said it was the best peach pie that they had ever eaten.
