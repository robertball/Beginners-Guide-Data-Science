I made this pie for a Kentucky Derby party this last Saturday.  While it was very easy and looked great when I put it in the oven, it refused to set.  I baked it 45 min. on bottom rack as per recipe, but it was like water when I took it out.  I've never made a pie like this so I'm hoping someone who gave this 5 stars will review it and tell me what I did wrong.  Needless to say I was very embarrassed when I cut into a beautifully done pie (or so it appeared) only to have it liquid in the middle. Help please!

Great recipe. The 8th race refers to the Kentucky Derby. This is an excellent version of the Derby or "Winner's Circle" pie

For BEVTHEBROKER or anyone who has liquid in the pie/won't set: In my experience, when I overbeat the batter - beat too long or worse use an electric mixer too long or on too high a speed, it causes air to get into the batter and then as it releases when it cooks you get left with a soggy bottom in the crust or it doesn't cook all the way through, notably in the middle its raw.  I've seen this happen to me with other recipes, mostly cakes.  If you try it again, just stir to combine the ingredients once you cream the sugar and butter and corn syrup. See if this might help.  Good Luck!

I have made this pie 3 times now and it is a hit everytime, especially with men. It tastes great with a chocolate cookie crust, as well as the traditional pie crust.

I made this recipe (with walnuts) for the thanksgiving holiday but I forgot it at home.  So, 5 days later, I cut it into bars and served it at a dinner party.  It still tasted as good as it did the day I made it.  This recipe was rather simple and very delicious and sweet.  The bourbon makes it extraordinary!

Defintely follow the advice to HAND-stir the ingredients in after creaming the butter and sugar!  I used my mixer and even though I used the "stir" setting, my pie bubbled over and the inside was raw. The filling that bubbled over actually caught fire in the oven due to the bourbon  HOWEVER, after allowing it to fully cool, it firmed up quite a bit and still tasted fantastic with vanilla ice cream.

I made a smaller pie using half the recipe.  The cooking time was way off for me (needed additional time).  However, it was worth the wait.  Delicious!
