Good flavors and an easy dinner.  Only thing I would change is the amount of spinach, it was wayyyy too much.  I would probably half it next time.

Love this! I tweakedit a bit by using two cans of petite diced tomatoes, half a red bell pepper, half bag frozen spinach, about 8 mushrooms, sliced. After simmering, I added a splash of vodka and 1/2 cup of light cream. My husband LOVED this!

I thought this was easy & very good! I altered with fresh swiss chard, cooking with pasta for last 2 minutes, mushrooms, fresh tomato & my sausage was venison sausage with cheese. Topped it with fresh grated parmesan.

I used five cloves of garlic instead of three because I prefer my food a bit spicier. The hot Italian sausage was a little overwhelming for the sauce, though. Next time, I'll use mild sausage.

wonderful! The only reason for 4 stars is I did not have all the ingredients so sub'd-fresh spinach for the frozen, sauted Italian turkey sausage, mild not hot and added mushrooms and served over linguine.  Next time it will be as written.  Thank you for posting.

This dish is absolutely divine.  Deserves more than 5 stars ~ too bad it only offers 5.  I would definitely rate it 10!!!

Thank you, Pamela for this recipe. Thanks to goobubs for making it even more wonderful! Wow! I sauteed the 8 sliced mushrooms and 1/2 red bell pepper until just tender then added garlic and cooked until fragrant. Then added can diced tomatoes, sauce, return to simmer and then added the splash of vodka and 1/2 cup cream. I also added cayenne pepper because I like the zip. Then poured the sauce over pasta/spinach and tossed. Very easy to prepare and delicious. I will making this again!

With best intentions I had planned to add a photo of my finished product.  My children, however, had different plans.  They inhaled the dish and said in tandem, 'this is the best dinner we have had in months.'  I guess I will kind of take that as a compliment.
Great recipe!  Very easy to make.

My family and I love this.  I changed it a little.  I used chicken and I also use red pepper and onion in it.  Also used more garlic because we love it so much.

I made this and absolutely loved it. I added tomatoes and used the sun dried tomatoe sauce.  I also added mozzarella cheese. Absolutely loved it.
