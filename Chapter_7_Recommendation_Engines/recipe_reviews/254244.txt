I think the Rose wine needs to be a sweet rose. I used a dry rose and between that and the raspberries, it was very tart. We had to add a bit of simple syrup and then some diet 7-up to make it sweet enough to drink as a slushie.

So refreshing!  This combination of flavors works so well.  I absolutely loved the tartness the raspberries bring to the party.  I don't have a blender so I had to settle for crushed ice.  Still tasted fantastic.

If your rose is dry, this is going to be super tart. But! If you add extra triple sec, it balances it out pretty nicely and has the bonus of making your slushy stronger. I tripled the recipe for a crowd, which comes out to two full bottles of wine. I had to work in batches, but then just mixed everything together in a big bowl before moving it to smaller containers to fit in a freezer easier. Summertime backyard party hit!
