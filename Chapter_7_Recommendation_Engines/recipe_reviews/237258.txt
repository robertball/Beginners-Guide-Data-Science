I often don't like smoothies without yogurt, but this one worked for me.  It definitely does have a good punch of ginger, so if you have any concerns about that, start conservatively and add more if you think it's needed.  I wanted to finish off a bag of frozen strawberries, so I did add more than the quantity indicated.  Enjoyed!
