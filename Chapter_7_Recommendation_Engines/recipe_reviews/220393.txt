OMG...this was FABULOUS!  I joined the website just so I could rate the dish.  So here's the deal...I'm not a fan of peppers, 3 cans of beans sounded like a lot and I've never made "cheese" with nutritional yeast.  I got the nutritional yeast at Whole Foods (bulk section).  However, I made this WORD for WORD and it was amazing.  I've told everyone I know.  Expand yourself and make it!

I prepped the rice and veggies the day before to make this easier. Followed the recipe exactly, except added a layer of cheese. Was a little unsure about the yeast sauce at first, but it really made the meal! This recipe is a definite keeper for my family. I'm giving it only 4 stars because of the long prep time, but it's definitely worth it because it makes plenty!

Absolutely fantastic! 
I made this for dinner the other night, and my husband (a meat eater) could not stop raving!

The only changes I made were to use green chiles instead of jalapeno, a (cooked) bag of dried beans rather than canned, and olive oil in place of the margarine. 

Definitely a keeper!

This has great potential. However, the rice didn't stand out enough - there either needs to be a lot more, or you might as well just leave it out. I think next time I will leave it out, because you don't really need rice when you've already got tortillas! As for the tortillas, I think I will leave them whole in the future and just use more of them. The casserole fell apart too much for my taste when serving it (it ended up looking like chili on my plate); I think whole tortillas would help hold it together in layers a bit better. I only had two cans of beans instead of three, but I think that was more than sufficient, and I added LOTS more veggies because this recipe calls for so few.  I love veggies, so I used two smallish onions, 3 peppers (red/yellow/green), a whole zucchini, and mushrooms.  I wouldn't bother with the oil/marinade step. Why waste time/ingredients? Just saute the veggies in the seasoning. The yeast sauce was VERY good, though. I will definitely use that again. I like having vegan (if you take out the butter) recipes in my arsenal just in case I ever entertain vegans for dinner. And I love that this recipe calls for brown rice and whole wheat tortillas. I always substitute with whole grains in recipes anyway, but it's nice to see a recipe actually call for them. Thanks, David and Krista!

This was so good!  I ended up marinating the veggies for about 4 hours.  Skipped the nutritional yeast "cheese" step and used a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup instead.  EDIT: I just wanted to update this regarding leftovers- I wish I could give them six stars.  This dish only gets better the next day, and topped with sour cream it is simply phenomenal!

Varied recipe to be Celiac version and regular version. Honestly next time I make this and there WILL be a next time,  it will be without any tortillas or flour mixture. 
This recipe is GREAT all on its own without either of those!
My family requested, leave ALL breading off...then they ate chips with casserole! LOVED IT!
Also, bottom layer I used refried beans with green chiles from a can. They LOVED it!
HIGHLY recommend!

I followed this recipe mostly. I had to switch out a few things due to allergies to Gluten. I used Corn tortillas instead of flour, gluten free all purpose flour instead of white flour. I used olive oil instead of butter. I made the sauce but not sure I would make it again because I didn't like the way it smelled when I was cooking it and I'm really weird about my food smelling funny and then eating it anyways. I didn't hate the sauce... but will be looking for a different cheese sauce in the future. One preferably i don't have to myself to cut time. It took me alot longer then 30 minutes to prep this recipe. Regardless of all that I loved the dish in itself especially with topping it off with  Jalapenos and sour cream. Next time I will be adding more vegetables I didn't feel like it had enough. As a vegetarian/gluten free eater I love my veggies :)

This was a great dish and boy did it make a lot.  It was a great way to use up a lot of leftover brown rice and tortillas.  Will make it again but cut it in half.

I actually really liked the taste of this but I would double or triple the amount of veggies next time.  Maybe more rice as well, but definitely more veggies.  Otherwise it was very good.  I was a little skeptical about the "cheese" sauce but would never have known it wasn't cheese if I hadn't made the dish myself.  Hubby was surprised when I told him.

This recipe took quite a while to make and I was not a fan of the yeast sauce--it has a weird smell and flavor that doesn't go with a "fajita" recipe. I think without that, it has more potential.

I am committing the cardinal sin of rating a recipe that I altered. The review is based on my alterations, not as written. Since I didn't want to go to the grocery store and I had cheese in the house but not nutritional yeast, I just subbed cheese for the nutritional yeast sauce. I also used the easy enchilada sauce recipe from this site. This was good and the family all liked it. I will make it again with the yeast sauce; after all the good reviews, I am eager to try it.
