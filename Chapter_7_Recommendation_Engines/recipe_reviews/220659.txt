Easy to make!  I sprinkled the cornmeal on my pan, then put the bean mixture down on it.  At the time I flipped the burgers, I put more cornmeal on the pan. That way, I didn't have to use any oil!  Wonderful taste!

These were good, but a little crumbly.  I think they might bind better if I mix the corn meal into the bean mix.

The taste was good. These fell apart and I was not sure if I was supposed to smash the beans to make te mixture or leave them whole? The mix did not stick together and I let the mix set overnight as instructed.
