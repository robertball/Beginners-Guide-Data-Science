These were pretty good. However, my dad is a pastry chef and said that the amount of butter in them is way too much. The taste of butter was a little too pronounced. He said that as a general rule for shortbread, the amount of flour always has to be at least double to the amount of butter. Also, he said that the secret to get them to stay in one piece and not fall apart, is in the baking time. Make sure you bake them at least until the are a rich golden instead of white. My first batch was just golden on the bottom, and I was still able to manipulate well, but fell apart when biting into them, and they were a little chewy, or doughy in the mouth. My second batch, I let them get a little more color on them, and there texture was much better! Here you go, that is the secret (I think)of why many people had crumbly falling apart cookies! All credit goes to dad :)
Perfect dough for piping beautiful shapes. Pretty good when adding a bit of almond extract too!

These really are light and melt-in-your-mouth good.  I first beat the softened (salted) butter in my electric stand mixer; then beat the dough for the 10 minutes called for.  Shortbread is high on my list of fave cookies, so I didn't think I'd want maraschino cherries messing with my shortbread!  But it really did add a very nice touch.  I used Trader Joe's Maraschino Cherries (no red dye additives and they still taste great).  This does not make very many cookies, so if you want a lot, at least double the recipe!  I probably got the 3 dozen it says it yields, but they are very small cookies!  BTW, there are two recipes for these cookies on this site with one difference:  the other one calls for red AND green maraschino cherries!  Thanks for the great cookie, Carol!

Mine turned out GREAT! I think the key is making sure they are mixed for at least 10 minutes. I used my KitchenAid mixer and let them mix on medium for about 12 minutes (I also whipped the butter by itself first for about 2 minutes) and they were PERFECT!

I took them to work and got tons of compliments on them. Thanks!

Well I had high hopes for these cookies!  The instructions were super easy and the dough when mixed was so yummy and fluffy!  I made them exactly as directed (using salted butter - might try unsalted next time) and when the one reviewer said they were "grainy" like sand I couldn't imagine how it would be after you whipped them for so long, but that's what happened to mine after cooking too!  I omitted the cherry and once they were out of the oven I added a large round chocolate piece to the top without moving them off the baking sheet.  The first batch came out so fragile that I couldn't even pick them up to eat one!  They just fell apart like a cookie made of SAND.  I am letting the second batch cool on the pan (which is going to make baking these take a long time!). That might be the ticket?  I don't know what the magic touch is?  Maybe I shouldn't have fluffed the flour before measuring it?  I softened the butter a little and mixed it all together at the same time.  No creaming butter first and adding sugar then flour - that might help a little.  I did let them cool on the pan before lifting them off and that helped slightly.  At least I could sorta pick them up even though once you bit into the cookie it crumbled apart.  My 2yr old was VERY upset when her cookie fell on the ground and she didn't get a bite. :(  They do taste good and they disolve in your mouth.  I personally like a little more substance when I bite into a shortbread cookie and not have it fall apart.

Awesome cookie recipe.  Only hint I'd give is to use UNSALTED butter, it keeps the dough together and adds to it's light texture.

These came out beautifully.  I substituted 4 oz. cream cheese for 1/2 of the butter, but otherwise followed the recipe.  They were perfect.

So based on the reviews I read, I also modified the recipe to reflect the previous review, saying 2 C flour to 1 C butter...  I also decided to add a bit of the juice from the cherries for extra flavor.  I have to say that after mixing for a few moments with hand mixer the best way to describe the state of my kitchen was that of cocaine den! What a mess! So I would suggest that you do it in a food processor if you have one, HOWEVER, if you are using a food processor, do NOT mix for the recommended 10 mins, as the heat from the processor will melt the butter and ruin the mix! Mix it until it goes lighter in shade by several shades and looks fluffy and whipped, also ensure to scrap down the sides of the processor to ensure even mixing.  But do pay attention to the mix and do NOT mix it for more than 5 mins.

There are two identical recipes on this site for these cookies.  Mine were flat as a pancake and crumbled no matter how long I whipped them or how long I baked them.    I had made a double batch, so I really didn't want to throw them out.  I added another 1/4+ of powdered sugar, some vanilla, 1/4 tsp of salt , and about 1 cup more flour (for a double batch mind you).  Then they came out great, still melted in your mouth, and didn't spread all over the place.  One star because I wasted two trays before it worked.  Recipes should work the first time.  I'm an experienced baker, I will not be making this recipe again.

These were almost exactly what I was looking for! They're very quick and easy to make. 10 minutes was way too long for my arm to hold a beater for so I only did it for 5 and they were lovely...only took 10 minutes to cook (but my oven is crazy sometimes). Thanks for the recipe I'll deffinitly use it again :)

Made these today and followed the advice of the pastry chef and increased flour to 2 cups (to create a ratio of 2 to 1 of flour to butter). Also used unsalted butter and a teaspoon of almond extract and beat it prior to adding dry ingredients for about 2-3 minutes. Added 1/8 teaspoon of salt when adding flour and sugar. Chilled the dough for a bit, rolled it into balls and made thumb print cookies, which I filled with homemade rhubarb-cranberry jam. Baked at 350 for 16 minutes. Turned out perfect. Will make these again for sure! Thanks to other commentators for their tips, well worth reading before starting the recipe!

Well, I made these and was the only one in the family who liked them (daughter called them mashed potato cookies).  After about 7 or 8 of them, I couldn't eat anymore (probably a healthy reaction to eating 8 cookies).  Texture melts in your mouth, but kinda 'sandy.'  Seems people either hate it or love it.  I'm keeping the recipe though: will make them again as part of a plate with other cookie offerings for family gathering/party.  For a twist, on the third batch I hand-mixed a little melted chocolate into the batter for a swirl cookie.

Very delicate and light.  I used a cookie press to make swirl shaped cookies.  The dough still flattens out even if baked from frozen state.  Flavor is lacking but spreading melted Belgian chocolate on the flat side really made these cookies decadent and delicious!

I too had high hopes for this recipe but I was disappointed with the results. I truly dislike when someone bashes a recipe. I try to find the good in a recipe and the good thing was, these did taste good. I, like others, did find these to be overly delicate and they did disintegrate in your mouth into a sandy, albeit tasty, mouthful. I did beat the ingredients with my Sunbeam Mixer for the specified amount of time and the dough (more the consistancy of a batter) was very well whipped. I formed the cookies using a pastry bag and that worked well. I baked these on parchment paper using air-bake cookie sheets, until golden brown around the edges. Extremely fragile while warm. Even when cooled to room temperature they remained very fragile. I did find that refrigerating them did help them to hold together better while holding and eating them. I think I will use a more traditional shortbread recipe as shortbread is one of my husband"s favorites. Sorry I couldn't give this a higher rating.

I made these a couple days ago and, although they do indeed melt in your mouth (as whipped shortbread should) I found they need more sugar and perhaps vanilla extract or maybe a little of the cherry juice to sweeten and add flavor. They tasted a little "floury". As one other reviewer stated, they are very fragile and crumbly.. but you need to expect that if you want WHIPPED shortbread. I also found these ones spread out a little more than I expected but I think that's more my fault than the recipe.  Over all it's a good recipe and very easy to make... just maybe more sugar and a little splash of vanilla.

I agree with previous reviewers - these cookies melt in your mouth but crumble in your hand before you can even take a bite.  I first tried taking the cookies off the pan right out of the oven and I couldn't even get them on the spatula without falling apart.  Then I tried letting them cool first and taking them off this helped a little. At least I was able to transfer them to a plate without breaking - but once I tried picking them up once again they fell right apart.  Disappointing after holding my heavy beaters for 10 min.  Next time I'm trying a recipe with more flour/more substance.

OMG AMAZING!  I agree with previous comments.  Bump the flour up to 2 cups, beat butter for 5 min, add sugar, beat 5 min, add half of flour, add other half.  They were perfect.  I will be adding pecan meal to mine for a pecan sandie flavor!

Delicious!!!!! I read some of the other reviews. Some say add more flour, some say use less. I think this recipe is too be followed exactly as is. Hint: If you like perfectly white cookies, lay brown paper on cookie sheet before you dough on. This is an tip that was given to me from an aunt years ago who had the BEST and WHITEST shortbread I have ever seen.

Yum! I added two cups of flour and whipped the butter for two minutes before adding the sugar and flour. I also let them cool on the baking sheets and they came off easily. A dip in melted chocolate makes them taste even better!

OK.........BY FAR the best Shortbread Cookies I've EVER, EVER made.  WOW!!!!  Just follow the recipe and enjoy.  I put mine in the oven for 14 minutes but every oven is different so just watch them until the sides brown a bit.  But WOW.....melt in your mouth isn't even the word.  Thank you, thank you Carol for the recipe.  Just amazing.  And if you don't like them or they don't turn out, then you've done something wrong.  ;o)

These are fantastic.  When I make these for the holidays, I usually use the candied red and green cherries for the middle.

Simply amazing- you put it into your mouth, and it's so fluffy. You know those fluffy clouds you read about in faerie tales? That's how fluffy these are. A little bite of heaven. :)

What a tasty little treat. Definitely melts in your mouth. I must admit that I did use the modified recipe other posters mentioned as I remembered shortbread has a 1 butter to double the flour ratio. I made about 7 batches in 3 days. They were that good. Well, I also made them for a birthday party and they were a hit. I did add a little vanilla and piped them out, topping them with sprinkles or chocolate chips. I baked until the edges turned brown. They travel well and none broke before getting to our mouths. Will definitely be making again.

Very rich, flaky and delicious.  I did figure out why some of the other reviews said the cookies were too fragile to take off the cookie sheet.  The first batch I made, I baked for 18 minutes which allowed the tops of the cookies to begin to brown and had no trouble with them.  The second batch, I baked for 15 minutes and they were still fully white on top...could not take them off the parchment paper, they just fell apart.  I didn't have maraschino cherries so I used hershey kisses, and I added 1/2 a cup more flour and combined the dry ingredients separately then spooned it into the mixer steadily, allowing the mixture to become fully integrated before adding more.  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Too easy to be good (I thought) but these cookies are ABSOLUTELY DIVINE! My 3 yr old grand daughter and I, whipped the batter with spoons. They're so buttery and just melt away in your mouth. I realized at the last moment, I didn't have powder sugar, so I substituted granulated instead. I can't imagine them getting better than this.

Gotta go! Our second batch is now ready! :-)

The best shortbread recipe I have tried.  I whipped it for the full 10 minutes and then piped it onto the cookie sheets using a pastry bag.  My kids loved these cookies.  The only change I made was placing a chocolate morsel on the top rather than a maraschino cherry piece.

So many compliments about this super-easy recipe!  The trick is in the mixing - don't skimp on the time spent mixing and bake until just golden at the edges at you will have good results.

When I lost my grandma's recipe, I found this one, which was very close to hers. I made them a few months ago & they came out beautifully. Like my grandma's, I piped mine with a piping bag & star tip. I didn't make them very big, just the right size to to pop in your mouth & let it melt away. So starting my Christmas baking this weekend, I came back to this recipe. I read the reviews about decreasing the amount of flour. They seemed to whip up just like my gram's. I piped them out & baked them. They spread out like pancakes when cooked & didn't taste good at all. So I tried the recipe according to directions. As I was mixing, the mixture was not coming together, so I added a bit more butter, not quite 1/4c. They seemed to whip up great. My husband piped them out, a little bigger than what I do. I baked them & they spread out a bit. When cooled, I tasted & they did not taste good at all. I don't know what went wrong but I've never had this much trouble making cookies.

I used a cup of flour instead of the full one and half, by a mistake.. And they turned out PERFECT. Talk about melt in your mouth. I'm not a huge fan of cherries so I used chocolate chips. You really need to double, maybe triple this recipe though.

I followed the advice of Miriam (and her dad).  I increased the flour to 2 cups with the 1 c butter.  It was fabulous.  I rolled the dough out and used a cookie cutter.  I also baked till lightly golden.  Someone even commented how they liked the fact they didn't fall apart when bitten.  Our new favorite shortbread recipe.

I've made these cookies countless times now. They're like eating little puffy clouds! Fantastic! I use unsalted butter. I bake them until the bottom edge just turns brown. I let them cool 5 mins then transfer them to a wire rack and I've never had a problem with them falling apart. I've dipped them in white and dark chocolate, given them away as Christmas presents and had the recipe asked more times than I can remember! Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies taste delicious, but completely crumble when I try to pick them up.  They certainly 'melt in your mouth'.  Perhaps I should have used 2 cups of flour like some other reviewers did.   Also, my cookies are much flatter than the photo. Not very photogenic.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 1 tsp. of almond extract to the batter.  I cannot imagine what went wrong here....

My family really loved this cookies. My 10 month old son adored them! lol
I did use 2 Cups of flour instead and I added a little bit of vanilla.
otherwise...it was perfect!

I have made this about 3 times this week now for the holidays.  Everyone that has tasted these cookies just loves them.  I melt some chocolate chips and drizzle it over the cookies just after they come out of the oven.  They are absolutely fabulous.  Make sure you beat for at least 10 mins or they won't be as fluffy.  I beat the butter for about 2 mins, add the rest of the ingredients then beat for another 10 mins.

This was my first time making shortbread cookies.  Melt in your mouth is right.  My husband and his co-workers loved them. The only thing I did was to add vanilla extract.  This is the perfect recipe for shortbread cookies, you need look no further.

Taste is good, however, that is if you can get the cookie to your mouth before it breaks into sizes perfect for feeding ants. These crumble regardless of chilling dough, mixing in 3 parts, chilling on/off cookie sheet. My hubby things they taste like whipped flour. Sorry, but these just arent for us. I wanted to do cookies that my young daughters could decorate and this was a wasted day!

I've never given a recipe a bad rating before and feel badly but ... while these tasted wonderful and they looked beautiful, they crumbled when you tried to pick them up.  I told my children to pick them up like they were picking up broken glass then put the whole thing in your mouth at once!!!  They completely dissolve in your mouth...no need to chew!  Sorry to have to give a bad review but there's definately something missing in this recipe as I followed it to the letter.

Delicious cookie!  The only thing I did differently was... NOTHING!  I did NOT increase or decrease the flour and I did NOT add cherry juice or any other liquid.  Recipe is fantastic as is.

These were fantastic! I followed other reviewers advice and used two cups of flour. I piped them onto the cookie sheets and added half a maraschino cherry. Baked for 13 minutes. Perfect whipped shortbread!

Just made these cookies.  After reading a few reviews on the "grainy effect" I was a tad apprehensive to make them.  I did see this effect happen to the dough during beating, however, as I kept going they then took on a more doughy texture and I was pleased.
All in all a great, easy cookie

So smooth and buttery!  Substituted 1/2 cup baking powder instead of 1/2 cup of flour.  Also added a tablespoon of lemon juice and a dash of lemon zest for pop.  With no eggs, you can eat as much dough as you want.

I made these for the first time today and they are great.  I doubled the recipe and added vanilla also. When done, I did take a few and partially dipped them on one side in chocolate and they were also great.  I will be using these for the Christmas holidays and will definitely make them again.  A wonderful recipe and very tasty and they definitely do melt in your mouth!  Thanks Carol for sharing this.

At first I thought they were too dry, but after they sat overnight in a container they seemed to get softer and were very good.  They had a great buttery flavor.  I brought them to work and my coworkers ate them up in under 5 minutes.

These are some of the best cookies I've ever tasted(I DON'T USE THE CHERRIES). After I made it a few times, I started adding little things to it. For instance, I added 1 teaspoon of lemon extract to the cookie dough and I added raspberry preserve to the middle of the cookies. You can also make a glaze for the cookies (very delicious)!Also if you go sub. 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar...the sugars will hold up but still melt in your mouth!TRY IT..it works.

I have to agree with the other reviewers about the "sandy" texture of these cookies.  They taste pretty good, but their delicate texture makes them very difficult to eat.  They almost dissolve in your mouth -- not a texture for everyone.

This was so easy, especially with a mix master!! My husband drooled over these cookies.  I added chocolate chips to one batch.  Yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly and these are easy and very good! They definitely taste like shortbread over sugar cookies and this batter can’t be rolled out FYI. I added chocolate chips on top of half the batch and those are really yummy as well. Also I just plopped the cookie batter down by the spoonful onto parchment paper on baking sheet using my fingers. I’ll be making again for sure!

I followed the instructions exactly as it says to. These came out more like tea biscuits and were definitely not the cookies I was hoping to make. If you put some jelly or jam on top of them their fine.

I followed the recipe exactly as listed. These are so addicting,  they literally melt in your mouth. Just be careful when fresh from the oven, I used a spatula to transfer them to the cooling rack. They are VERY fragile. Even when cooled, they can be hard to pick up in your hand without crumbling. These cookies are going to be added to my yearly Christmas cookie platter.

I made these today and my kitchen aid mixer couldn't handle the consistency of the dough.  I added a teaspoon of Vanilla and about 1/4 cup of milk cause the dough was too thick.  You certainly cannot pipe these or drop them from a teaspoon.  I rolled and flattened them then added cherries and colored sugar.  They turned out fine.

Gluten Free Conversion substitutions: Using Krusteaz brand GF All Purpose Flour (and hints from others’ comments) I increased the flour to 2 cups + 1 teaspoon. I also added 1/8 teaspoon almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I sprinkled colored sugar on, but instead of cherries (eww) I dotted each with a white chocolate chip in the first batch. In the second batch I used red sugar + 3 semisweet chocolate chips and 1 white chocolate chip. As my pic shows, the white chocolate chips turned brown on top, so I think I would try folding them into the dough next time (with the original amount of flour and perhaps some xanthan gum to help them stay together.)  Rather than using a greased/ungreased cookie sheet, I used parchment paper for easy cleanup. As with many GF cookies, these look great ON the cookie sheet but tend to break/dissolve when you try to move them. NOTE FOR GF BAKERS: Adding the extra flour was a BAD CHOICE for gluten free flour—when you bite into them, they basically turn into powder. NOTE FOR ALL: I can’t imagine how bland these would be without the added vanilla and almond flavorings. Even with those added (I would add more next time!) the taste was simple and traditional, like plain shortbread or a Dutch Letter, but quite bland.

These were the most popular out of the 5 different cookies I made this year!
For those who are diabetic, I want to let you know that you can use Splenda baking as a substitute for the sugar and they come out great!
I changed the last batch to rum extract with cinnamon drops and they were the Winner!

I’ve been making this recipe for years but the last few years the cookies tended to melt or were so fragile they broke. This year, I used organic flour and increased amount to 1 and 3/4 cups. After using the cookie press to create the cookies I put them in the freezer for 15 min before cooking. 10 minutes is too long for little cookies but otherwise the y turned out perfectly. A friend who is a high school foods teacher and used to work in a bakery suggested the switch to organic flour. At the school they had noticed a real difference in the quality of product over the past few years and have discarded many cookie recipes they used to use.

Tonight, I made this recipe, and another recipe that is identical except for the addition of 1/4 cup of corn starch.  I found the cookies with corn starch held their shape a bit better, and were less delicate than the cookies without corn starch.   The cookies without corn starch baked faster.   I couldn't taste a difference between the two recipes.  Both tasted very good, and benefited from 12 - 15 minutes of whipping time for the unsalted butter.

I haven't made this kind of cookie in decades my memories were a very fragile cookie...but I read alot of the reviews and did add some corn-starch maybe 2 T to the whole batch and Oh My GOODNESS these were good. They are soft and oh so melt-able  in the mouth. Now I did use a melon ball scooper thingy to take them out so they were higher than most pictures  and I baked them on my silpate 9 minutes and a bite of heaven. I have a fondness for Almond flavours so a dash of that was added to the whipping butter. that's all and I was very pleased with these results.

I have made this recipe for 40 years and love it.  I never scrimp on beating; only use icing sugar and never granulated sugar; and use a cool oven (275 degrees for 40 - 45 min) for baking.  I was surprised to see that others have a problem with sandy texture, and have problems with the cookies crumbling.  I think the slow-low heat baking must be the secret.

Very good and delicate. I used two cup of flour and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also left the cookies on the cookie sheet to cool, as suggested in other comments. My son-in-law loves plain shortbread cookies, so I made these for him. I hope he likes them!

Delicious!  Shortbread is typically my kryptonite but this recipe was easy and turned out great!  I left the recipe as is and I don't have any complaints!   My oven cooks differently so 8 mins was sufficient cooking time.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is now my go to recipe!

I baked these for the family I nanny for and they loved them!I wish it was sweeter but over all they were easy and very tasty! I added a spoonful of strawberry jelly into the middle of each cookie before baking instead of the cherries...that was DELICIOUS!

This is a marvelous simple, customizable "shortbread" cookie recipe. Other reviewers mentioned it isn't "true shortbread", but it tastes close enough for me and my family!  I don't have an electric mixer so I did it all by hand and fork, and it turned out great. I followed one suggestion to cream the butter by itself for a while, then I slowly added sifted sugar, then flour. My arm got tired near the end, but it was fine!  I hate maraschinos so I ended up topping my cookies with all sorts of sprinkles. My favorite topping was jam-- I spooned a bit into little heart-shaped indentations-- and then green sprinkles over top, and they made attractive christmas shortbread cookies. Yum!  I went back and made another batch the very next day. I'm definitely saving this recipe!

How exciting....finally a recipe that is tasty with substitute butter!  My child is allergic to egg, milk and soy.  I followed the recipe but substituted 1 cup of butter with earth balance soy free vegetable spread.  I also placed pure choc chips in the center of some cookies and 100% fruit spread on a few others in lieu of cherries.  My family loves them...thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

I was looking for a recipe that reminded me of my grandmother's shortbread cookies and this was pretty close. The flavor was almost exactly what I was looking for however I cooked them for 14 minutes and found them to be too "golden" so I won't cook them as long next batch. Thanks -

These were your typical shortbread cookie. I had no problem with them falling apart or being grainy. Followed the recipe exact. I found at some point the batter looked like millions of peas I think one trick would be when you get to this point keep beating then the batter started throwing around my hand mixer then I kept beating until it got smooth. I think the trick is the beating.

Very sandy cookies, not to my liking though and I'm usually a big fan of a starchier cookie, oh well.

Melt in your mouth ! I used my kitchen aid & the hints from several other reviewers.  Whipped the butter 2 min first, then the rest of the batter for full 10 min. I used 2 cups of flour & added a bit of lemon juice.  Also used raspberry preserves instead of the cherries. Everybody loves these cookies! Double the recipe because they don't last long. Will add these to my holiday baking list as well !

The first time I made them, I didn't whip the batter. But after looking more closer to the recipe I whipped the batter for 10 min. and they were melt in your mouth delicious!

They really do melt in your mouth. So light and perfect as a "tea" cookie. I suspect they wouldn't hold up for many days, but we ate them all the first day, so short-keeping is only a theory. :-)

Mmmm!  Instead of cherries, I placed a 1/2 teaspoon of Mamool (middle-eastern date cookie) filling in the center of these and then dusted them with powdered sugar.  Sooo good!

I have made several batches of these cookies. While they are awesome in taste, I have yet to mastered the technique to prevent them from breaking up while being moved from the cookie sheet onto the cooling rack. They crumble at the touch of the spatula. I am sure it is due to my lack of baking experience.

Just like I remember.  My mom used to make these for Christmas each year.  This recipe was easy and turned out wonderfully.  I used salted butter and whipped for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  Melt in your mouth yummy goodness!  A huge hit with my family!

I loved this recipe! The cookies are melt in your mouth and the cherry added such a nice touch! I decided to drizzle some milk chocolate over a few in the batch. They were so good! I melted milk choc, shortening and some coconut milk together...the coconut milk gave it an interesting flavour...and I'm definitely gonna do it like that again! Thanks for the post!

Awesome!  I looked for 20 years for a "melt in your mouth" shortbread cookie and finally found it in this one. Only 15 minutes in my oven, so be carefull.  It says to whip for 10 minutes, buy my arm got sore so I quit after 4 minutes.  They were perfect.

A delicious recipe, although it would be good advice to cool cookies for 20 minutes before handling.  Very hot to the touch and the tops were very mushy until they cooled completely.  My husband loved these!

This was indeed melt in your mouth.  The only problem I had is that it didn't make enough and it was done after only 12 minutes.

I made these without the maraschino cherries as I didn't have any on hand.  They do indeed melt in your mouth.  The only problem, this recipe doesn't make near enough.  I'll definitely have to double or triple it.
