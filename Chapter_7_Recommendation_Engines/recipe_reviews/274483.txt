Overall yummy!  Made it for Thanksgiving morning for a houseful of company -- worried I guess we wouldn't get enough to eat that day!!!  Anyway, made it the night before.  I had three cans of cinnamon rolls, so I made 1 and 1/2 recipes.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Only negative is that some places on the bottom tasted a little scrambled egg like -- nobody complained and everyone ate it!  It rose nice and high, so was impressive coming out of the oven.  Frosting, cinnamon rolls, pecans -- you can't go wrong, really!  I might cut down on the eggs by one or two next time.

Simple canned cinnamon rolls are turned into this amazing dish. Your guests won't believe how simple this recipe is with such great flavors! Followed as written. I did not see where it needed topped with anything. Will make again!
