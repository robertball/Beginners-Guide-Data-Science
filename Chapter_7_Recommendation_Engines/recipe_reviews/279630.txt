I think 3 tablespoons of dill is too much....I will cut it down next time I make.

Easy to make....once you shop for the ingrediency's....not my forte, but I did it and then it was a piece of cake to make them. They were delicious, even if I say so myself.

My younger daughter loved it, but my older daughter thought it was a bit salty. I think I would just cut down the salt to half the amount. Since I didn't have fresh dill, I had to substitute with dried, but  think using the fresh dill would have made the recipe perfect. I used oat milk, & it was fine. I also added in a bit more lemon zest. Will definitely make this dish again!

I must say this recipe has become my all time favorite.  I've been cooking for my finicky parents and they also loved them.

Thank you so much for the recipe.  It will be my "go to" Swedish Meatball recipe!!

Yes, I made the Swedish meatballs and they were delicious.  It was easy and the entire family loved them, ages 71 to 3.  Thanks.

This was a a wonderful recipe, definitely a do-over! I omitted celery & pork & adjusted ingredient amounts for 1# ground beef. I needed to cook meatballs for 30 minutes to reach 160 degrees .  I also made 3/4 amount of sauce.

Made as written and it was just ok to us flavor wise. I'd cut back on the dill if I were to try this again. Felt like something was missing in the overall flavor of the dish. While the texture of the meatballs was good, we thought they were on the bland side. I didn't have that lovely jam to serve with the dish though so maybe that was the missing component.

I made this recipe and it was easy to make.  I used the dill herb that comes in the tube so I used one tablespoon because it is very concentrated.  I also substituted Olivina for butter, turned out really well.
I am actually making the sauce for chicken, asparagus and mushrooms tonight,  I think it will quickly become my go-to sauce for any meat or poultry.

Thanks!

Whenever I make Swedish meatballs, I always use ground turkey instead of beef. I like the lighter flavor with the cream sauce.  I didn’t have celery, fresh parsley, or fresh dill on hand. I dis without the celery and used dried parsley and dill paste. The meatballs seemed so wet before cooking, but they baked perfectly and were melt in your mouth moist. 
The sauce was so delicious. I only had salted butter and it turned out fine. The family absolutely loved it and I will 100% make this again! I can’t wait to make it again with fresh herbs and celery next time. I served it over wide butter egg noodles with a side of petite peas. I think I would even venture to put the peas directly in the sauce next time.

I thought I had a great swedish meatball recipe but it has been replaced by this one.  It is easy and delicious!! I cut the amount of dill to 1/3 using dried dill.

I used to make this recipe when I was a teenager and thought it was the best thing I had ever tasted! I’m a little bit older now and when I saw this I thought I hit the jackpot! I made it tonight for my mom and stepdad. It still was wonderful but it didn’t measure up to my childhood memory I’m sad to say. I would still make it again but not here. I had ankle surgery on May 1st so I’m having to stay with them for 8 weeks. I’ll be happy to get home and make it without so many cooks in the kitchen. Lol!
