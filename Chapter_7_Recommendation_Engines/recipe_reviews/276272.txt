These are so lovely! I had to leave them in the oven 20 minutes instead of ten and used almond milk instead of regular milk but they came out great! They’re not too sugary but the perfect fall treat. I’m sure my family and I will be making them for years to come.

First time making doughnuts! I don’t know if this is a well-known thing or if it was just my oven, but I learned that I absolutely need to put the pan on the bottom rack. With my first batch, I put the pan on the second to bottom rack and nothing happened for the first 20 minutes. Only when I transferred the pan to the bottom rack for an additional ten minutes did the doughnuts rise. They tasted pretty good, but were not super fluffy. For the second batch, I baked on the bottom rack for 17 minutes and they were delicious— moist and fluffy. 10 minutes was not even close to enough, but I used s regular-size doughnut pan. The doughnuts themselves are tasty but fairly understated, so the cinnamon sugar topping isn’t egregious. Bake on the bottom rack and enjoy!

These are fantastic! The only change I made was I used butter instead of vegetable shortening, because I find vegetable shortening has a weird aftertaste in baked goods. As other reviews said, they were still raw after 10 minutes, I baked them for 20 minutes.

A great Healthy doughnut option with a great topping choice. Perhaps a little less baking powder as they looked kind of like muffin-donut hybrids.

I just sprinkled some sugar on top instead of doing the glaze. I used Splenda and partial whole wheat flour. I think they turned out good, but my fiancée said they weren't sweet enough.

These we everything I hoped they would be. The bake time was longer  15 minutes for me, as others have stated. I’m guessing the size doughnut pan you use makes a difference. I used solid unrefined coconut oil instead of the vegetable shortening. I will be making these again. I expect they will freeze well uncoated.

These were amazing donuts! They were soft, sugary, and delicious. I definitely recommend making these! I am going to make these donuts again and again!

My husband and I made this last night. Absolutely delicious! We will definitely be making this again! We had them as muffins but just as great!
