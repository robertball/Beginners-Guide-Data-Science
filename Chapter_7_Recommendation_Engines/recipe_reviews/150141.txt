Read all the reviews and made them just as written except I didn't have buttermilk on hand and couldn't shop, so I put 2 tsp of vinegar in a cup of milk and let it set up. Muffins smelled so fabulous and were delicious. Only drawback was I couldn't stop licking the batter.

I believe between the three of us, Aunt Norma, charliebabe (the submitter) and me, these muffins made rhubarb lovers out of a number of Floridians who had never tasted the stuff before! I deliberately brought some of my garden rhubarb in Wisconsin down to our place in Naples, FL as I wanted to treat the folks here. I am so pleased that these muffins showcased this “pie plant” so well!  I had no fresh buttermilk on hand, but buttermilk powder proved to be a worthy substitute. Because of the brown sugar, they are a rich, caramel color. And because I mixed the batter only till combined, leaving behind some lumps, they were light, tender and fluffy.  The amount of rhubarb was just right – sometimes I find rhubarb baked goods (apple too, for that matter) that are too heavy with the fruit, with very little “cake.”  It probably is just a subjective thing, but my preference would be to make these without the walnuts – I found the flavor of them a little distracting. As for the topping, it is buttery, cinnamon sweetness, but it’s a good thing I got 18 muffins with my muffin tins rather than 24, as I don’t think there would have been enough topping for another six!  Just excellent, with old-fashioned homemade appeal and I believe these would be just as good using other fruits if rhubarb is not available.

A very nice recipe.  I added an extra cup of rhubarb and more cinammon.  Especially good with coffee!   I will make these again.

do not change a thing to this recipe unless you are like me and love cinnamon.  1 tsp (or 1 tbsp if you are like me) of cinnamon is a wonderful compliment to this already great muffin.

Muffins are my specialty and people would buy them in the dozens in my cafe.  I can tell you 2 bowls are NOT necessary.  Add all your dry ingredients into a large bowl to start.  Stir to ensure baking powder and soda are completely mixed into the flour.  Then drop in wet ingredients on top.  Stir JUST UNTIL MOIST!  Using a fork, continue to fold in dry ingredients into the wet in the centre of the bowl.  When you don't see any more dry ingredients STOP!  Batter will be thick.  If your muffins are always tough, you are stiring them too long and with too much "stir".  Be gentle.  Don't stir the air out of them.

(if you don't have butter milk, just add 1 tbsp of white vinegar or lemon juice into your milk and let sit while you add all the other ingredients). 

thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious!! I did make a few changes to the recipe.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder to make them a little more fluffy.  I also didn't have buttermilk so I put 1 tbsp. of white vinegar in a 1 cup measuring cup and filled the rest with milk and let it stand for 5 minutes.  I used 2 cups of rhubarb and it was perfect. I also omitted the walnuts because I'm not a big fan.  These were the BEST MUFFINS I've made in a while (and I bake a lot of muffins!!).  I'll definitely be making these again!!

I loved them! YUM! Quite possibly the best muffins I've ever had. I used 2 cups of rhubarb.

These muffins are FANTASTIC! I made a couple of little changes to them though.
 -I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter.
 -I used 1 cup chopped rhubarb (frozen) and 1 cup chopped strawberries (fresh). 
 -And for the topping I used a different recipe from my favorite muffins:
1/3 cup packed brown sugar 
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1 tablespoon butter 
All in all this may be my new favorite muffin! Thanks Aunt Norma ;)

I really am enjoying these ones. I messed up a little and used the big chunky rhubarb I had cut up to make a crisp - a few of the muffins fell apart because of it. Great recipe - will be making a lot of these ones!!!

This is a quality recipe.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I just used regular milk, which seemed to work out fine.  I also added a number of spices to the dry mix including ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.  This gave the muffins the extra kick we like in our family.  The rhubarb made these very unique and tasty muffins and I will definitely make them again!

The texture was perfect, however, the flavor was bland.  I too, found the nuts incongruous .  Next time I will also add lemon zest and some cinnamon and/or nutmeg to the bland batter as well as the topping.

Wonderful recipe.  The ingredients mixed up a little drier than I am used to for muffin recipes, so it had me nervous.  But they cooked up to perfection.  Note: This recipe is easily modified for other fruits.  I did not use rhubarb and nuts, and instead added lemon zest and cranberries.  I used juice from the lemon I zested to make buttermilk out of 2% I had on hand.  Update:  I made this recipe again.  This time, I subbed a little more than half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  This change made no discernible difference in the end product.  Spectacular muffins- excellent recipe.

Great recipe! These muffins are nice and crunch on top, super-moist inside and full of great flavor! I tried something a little different and added a 1/2 cup of blueberries to mix. Super-delicious!

These are yummy muffins! Very moist and delicious. I did not have buttermilk so for a substitute, I added 1 Tbsp lemon juice to a measuring cup and then filled to 1 Cup with milk. Let sit 5 minutes to set up. I also used a total of 2 ½ cups fresh chopped rhubarb (chop smaller than for a pie) and was happy I added the extra cup. I did not add the walnuts, but that is just my preference. The cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top is a nice touch. Thanks for the recipe!

I brought these in to work today and thought I should probably try one out to make sure they're good; coworkers loved them! I loved the simplicity of the recipe (trying to use up some rhubarb my mgr gave me) and I agree the brown sugar makes these both delicious AND a gorgeous caramel color. I omitted the nuts, but almost wished I wouldn't' have... the flavor of the muffin stands out as really flavorful and perfectly moist, but I missed the rhubarb! I think I found a chunk or two of it in my muffin. :( That would be my only real negative comment I can say about this recipe. The batch size is misleading, as I also only yielded 19 muffins. I'll keep this one around and try adding another cup of rhubarb. Otherwise, a great recipe!

The new favorite in this house.  These are absolutely fabulous.  I was lucky enough to have a friend give me multiple stalks of rhubarb, enough to try several new recipes.  I have now made these 3 times in the last week, giving some to friends, but most being eaten by my family.  They are the perfect moist, tender texture with that great sugary, crunchy topping.  Such a winning recipe!

These muffins are moist, but the flavor of rhubarb is virtually non-existent.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  They are good, but taste like many others muffin recipes that I've tried.  Maybe if the amount of rhubarb is increased one would experience the true flavor of the vegetable/fruit.  If I would make them again, I would surely increase the amount of rhubarb.

My two teenage sons don't usually eat muffins but they gobbled these ones down and asked me to make them again. I did add an extra teaspoon of baking powder and they were very fluffy and light with a delightful crispy sweet top. Definately a recipe I will use again and recommend!

These are wonderful muffins - the best rhubarb muffins I've ever made or tasted.  I increased the rhubarb to 2c but will make it 3c next time to get more flavor of the rhubarb; I'll also add cinnamon in the batter, as well as the topping.
The only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5:  it's a stretch to say you get 24 muffins out of this recipe - I did get 24 but there some very small muffins in the batch.  I'd say 20 might be more realistic. I'll juggle the ingredients a bit to get 24 good-sized muffins.

This is a great recipe! I did tweak it a little, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I made a traditional streusel topping: 1/4 c. butter, 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. flour. This was excellent. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and grated the rhubarb instead of slicing it. Yum!

These muffins are delicious, except for one thing - I found the flavour and smell of the oil to be pretty overpowering (I used canola oil). Next time I'll use melted butter instead.
I upped the rhubarb to 2c. Warning - don't be lazy like me and try to fit the batter into 12 cups! They took a long time to bake and still seem a bit underdone. Next time I'll do 18 cups. Don't skip the topping - it's great.

These are delicious! The topping was a bit tricky to handle; it didn't "crumble" onto the muffins, so I added some oats to make it more manageable (see photo). I love the flavor in these. I think buttermilk makes a big difference! Thanks for sharing  :)

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have any buttermilk so I followed some other reviewers advice and added 1 Tablespoon of vinegar to the milk and let it sour, worked brilliantly. Also increased the Rhubarb to 2 cups and left out the nuts as I didn't have any. Otherwise followed recipe and it was excellent, will definitely be making again!

Awesome muffin recipe, I just tweaked it a bit.  I used an extra cup of rhubarb, and an extra 1/2 tsp. baking powder, as suggested by other reveiws  I also topped with a struesel topping instead.  Baking time was spot on and this makes 18 muffins.  This recipe is my new favorite.

I enjoyed this recipe, following it exactly. I was only able to get 15 muffins out of it, which is substantially shy of the suggested 24. Having followed the recipe and filled them as directed, I could not figure this one out. They were enjoyed, however. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

These muffins turned out great! Using buttermilk is best since it helps the baking soda to work properly. It will give a better texture to the muffins too. 1tbsp vinegar with milk measured to one cup is an ok substitute, but if you're going to the store, definitely get the buttermilk.

Used 2 C rhubarb and 1 cup strawberries. Was out of oil so used melted butter-added 2T extra. Dark Brown sugar. Topping Raw sugar/butter/cinnamon. Made 12 jumbo muffins. 30 min to cook. Superb! Let rest before taking out of pan so they can set. Flavor not bland at all.

Yummy muffins. I only had 1 C of frz rhubarb so I added enough re-hydrated dried cherries for the other 1/2 cup. When our rhubarb grows again...I'll use 2 cups. Added 1 tsp salt versus 1/2. I personal liked the walnuts in these. I did cut back to 1 C of brn sugar ~ it's a personal pref. As other's I used butter instead of oil. I also made 1/2 again more of the topping so I'd have enough. Oh, also added cinnamon & a little nutmeg in the batter. I only got 11 normal size muffins for some reason. These barely lasted 2 days between 2 of us. Thanks for the recipe charliebabe. I'll make these again for sure.

These are excellent muffins. Unfortunately I must have blinked or just blanked out where it said it makes 24 muffins. I only prepared one pan and then was surprised that I had so much left over batter! Well I used a mini muffin pan for the rest and even though they overflowed a bit, they were delicious! Love rhubarb recipes!!!

These made 12 gorgeous muffins with an excellent texture and taste. The tart bite from the rhubarb is the best part. I didn't have buttermilk so I mixed two teaspoons of vinegar into one cup of 2% milk. I also used two stalks of rhubarb and they measured out to two cups instead of the 1 1/2 listed. I get the feeling this recipe would be great with a combination of rhubarb and fruit too. Excellent recipe!

These are moist, yet fluffy. I have never made a muffin as good as this. My 9-year-old said to stop looking for the perfect recipe...this is it. I did use 1 cup rhubarb and 1 cup strawberries, otherwise, followed recipe exactly.

These muffins were really nice, light and fluffy with a good crumb texture.  I substituted stewed rhubarb for the oil and they remained lovely and moist.

These are amazing!  I made them with 2 c. of rhubarb, but I used a crumble topping that contained oatmeal for the topping.  Big hit with my hubby, who says he doesn't like rhubarb.

I found these too greasy, so I recommend using less oil or use solid shortening instead. Also, I use soft butter to make the topping instead of melted. Melted butter seems to yield lumps of topping that sink into the batter while soft butter yields more crumbly sprinkle that stays on top. I add 1 tsp cinnamon, some nutmeg and ginger to the batter, as well, for additional flavor.

i love rhubarb but not a fan of muffins until my daughter made these. they were in the new issue of all recipes magazine and with all the fresh rhubarb out we decided to try them. they are the best muffin I have ever had. the only change we made was to sub the vanilla with almond extract. we love almond extract with fruit(try in cherry pie, to die for}. these are a must try.

Delicious! Didn't put on the topping as I am trying to cut back on sugars, and there is already plenty in the recipe. I used half homemade applesauce and half oil instead of all oil. Milk + 1 T vinegar worked fine for the buttermilk as I didn't have that on hand. Frozen, thawed and drained rhubarb worked very nicely. Sifted the dry ingredients before gently blending them in. Very good texture, and nice and moist.

Our family looooved these muffins.  I made them according to the recipe except:
1) I substituted organic coconut palm sugar for ALL the brown sugar in the recipe and added some extra cinnamon to the batter as well as to the topping. 
2) I had to sour some regular milk using vinegar, as I didn't have any buttermilk on hand.
My whole family loved these muffins and didn't miss the higher glycemic brown sugar AT ALL.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

This was my first time making muffins.  Great recipe!  I couldn't find rhubarb so I used cut strawberries instead.  I added 1/2 cup of oats to soak up the extra juiciness, and it worked out perfectly!  I also threw a little ginger and cinnamon into the batter and used the same spices and some more chopped walnuts instead of sugar on the topping.  With the strawberries, it was sweet enough.

These are possibly the best muffins I've ever had, and were a hit with the whole family, whether rhubarb lovers or not. I'm going to try making them with other fruits too, they are that good. I did double the topping because I didn't feel there was enough of the cinnamon sugar mix (I used Splenda) for 24 muffins.

These were good. I used the two cups of rhubarb as suggested by others. It still seemed the rhubarb taste was a bit lost. Very good base muffin recipe.

Great muffins! I was looking for a way to use up some extra rhubarb I had in the fridge. I had already made a pie and was looking to make something different. I followed the instructions exactly as written and these muffins were delicious.  Will definitely make again!

A good muffin overall; I particularly liked the texture.  I will add cinnamon or all spice to the batter next time, as they were a bit bland.

These are simple and awesome! I found the topping a little too sticky to 'crumble' so, I just mixed in some crumbled almond slices. I too, left the nuts out of the recipe, and increased rhubarb to 3 cups. The rhubarb was frozen a couple weeks ago out of the garden. No problems using frozen as long as it is diced small, but I think the fruit will blend better when using fresh. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent muffins!  I, like many others, used 2 cups of rhubarb and added another 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  I substituted ideal No Calorie Sweetner Brown for the brown sugar.  I've made them both ways, and they're equally good.

Delicious and fluffy! I used one cup rhubarb and one cup strawberries and added one tablespoon flax seed. I also made my buttermilk out of silk and vinegar and used apple sauce in place of oil. For the topping I lightly sprinkled cinnamon and sugar but no butter.

So yummy!  Can't wait to try it with cranberries.  I used whole wheat flour and two cups of rhubarb.  So moist and not too sweet.  I did not pack the brown sugar and omitted the muffin liners....added extra cinnamon to the topping.  So far best receipe I found using whole wheat flour.

The muffins tasted good and my 2 year old loved them. I generally avoid using oil where possible and used applesauce instead.  I think the biggest deterrent for me was that the muffins stuck to the liners wasting a good portion of the muffin.  This may be because I didn't use the oil and subbed the applesauce instead.  The recipe called for walnuts but did not say where to use the in the recipe description so I did not use them.  And I added oats to the topping and used less sugar. just putting sugar on the top seemed like too much sugar.    I will try the recipe again as I have an abundance of rhubarb but this time I would pass on the liners.

Very, very good.  I had run out of brown sugar so I used white.  Next time I will use brown sugar and I am sure they will be even better. Liked the fact that these muffins weren't too sweet.

As soon as I saw fresh rhubarb in the market, I knew I had to get baking. These turned out just great! Full disclosure: I used butter instead of oil (don't judge me) and I didn't add walnuts. Also, it turned out that my rhubarb measured at 2 cups instead of 1.5, so I just threw the whole thing in there. It was still wonderful. I especially love how easy it was to make a streusel topping with melted butter. Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!

Mmmm. Rhubarb! I love the tang of the buttermilk in the batter, and the streusel on top is a particularly yummy touch. I subbed in 1 cup of whole-wheat flour for some of the white. Next time, I might put the walnuts in the topping, instead of tucking them in the batter, because they'll get toasted that way and I'm crazy like that.

Made three small adjustments: left out the walnuts (I'm not sure that would go with this...), used only about 3/4 cups brown sugar, and had an extra half cup of rhubarb so I used it all. I also did the milk with vinegar trick instead of buttermilk. These are wonderful! Fluffy, moist, tasty, great crumbly, crunchy top!

Yep..good, very good but mine fell in the middle. I didn't use nuts as the kids cannot take any tree nut/ground nut products to school. I added some coarse oats for some fibre and protein. I would make them again.

Excellent! I substituted applesauce for the oil. They came out nice and dense and yummy! Didn't use anywhere near all the sugar topping. You could cut those ingredients in half and still have plenty.

i agree with some of the other commenters..put cinnamon in the batter, too, and increase the rhubarb to at least 2 cups. i also used butter (not melted) as i was out of oil and it worked just fine. the batter was lumpier but turned out fine in the end

i also melted a bit of extra butter and threw a couple of handfuls of rolled oats in the streusel part for some extra crunch.

These are great! First time using rhubarb in something other than pie and they turned out fantastic! I did make a few changes based on some of the other reviews/recommendations. I used 1.5tsp Baking Powder, I added 1tsp of cinnamon to the batter, I omitted the walnuts (will try them next time), I used 2 cups of rhubarb and I doubled the topping (which made a bit too much). I think the extra rhubarb was just right. Well definitely be adding these to my favourites!!

There is too much baking powder or soda. I'm not that knowledgeable of a baker but I know these were just a lil too bitter and bland. Wasn't bad though... Just not that great.

SO good!  I was gifted some rhubarb recently and scoured the internet looking for what to do with it.  These caught me right away, I've not made muffins before (very new baker), so I decided to give it a go.  SO glad I did.  Easy, but so much delightful flavor.  I really like the walnuts, unlike a few others, I think they add some texture that they may suffer without, however if I make them again (which I plan to) I may use a different nut.  Very, very pleased.

First time I've ever tried rhubarb, and this looked like a fairly simple recipe to start with.  It was pretty easy to make, and the muffins are delicious!! My husband's first rhubarb experience as well, and I'm happy to say he likes them too!. Bought too much from the farmer's market, so debating whether to make more of these and freeze them, or try a different recipe :)

These muffins do not last long!  They have a simple flavor, but they are addicting all the same.  The first time I made them omitted the nuts and added an extra 1/2 cup of rhubarb.  I also didn't do the topping and used coconut oil for instead of vegetable.  But I thought the rhubarb was a bit tart.  So the second time I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and then mixed 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon with the rhubarb before mixing it into the batter.  That helped with the tartness, I think I would add more cinnamon next time and maybe some nutmeg.

I've been making these for years and they are delicious, however we have a few alterations that make them even better.   First, we don't put walnuts in the batter, we grind up pecans fairly fine and add them to the topping.  It gives them a wonderful crunch and the pecans toast as you cook the muffins giving them an even better flavor.  Second, shake the rhubarb in the flour before adding it to the batter so it stays well distributed throughout the batter.  Third you can make these muffins as a cake, it works perfectly in a 7x11 pan, but it rises very high so put another pan under it just in case it spills over.  I'm usually too lazy to bake muffins so generally make it as a small cake.   It also freezes great!

I made these last week & used 2 cups of chopped rhubarb & added a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter as others suggested. These were very easy. I didn't use a mixer which can spoil the texture of these muffins. Just follow directions closely. I made my own topping of cinnamon flour sugar & butter cut together & sprinkled on top. Coffee gang gave them 2 thumbs up!

Loved these muffins!  BUT...I did change the serving size to 36 and it made 18 filled to the top.  I am not sure why the serving size ever works for me, but it doesn't...  I also recommend greasing the top of your pan, the topping is quite sticky and will stick.  Sooooooo yummy!

These were easy to make, I only had frozen rhubarb on hand and it worked out perfectly.  They are moist, the topping is just perfect for the tartness of the rhubarb...the flavours of the batter, rhubarb and topping realy balance and compliment each other.  I would make these again.

They taste amazing!!! The cooking time is perfect. HOWEVER, here are a few critiques:
a) the topping is very hard to "sprinkle" over the top of the muffins cuz its so wet
b) there is not alot of topping (just enough for 18/19 muffins)
c) and i only got 17 muffins out of this, NOT 24. And my muffins are not very big either.
I also added an extra cup of rhubarb (so 2 1/2 cups of frozen rhubarb) and it is perfect. Love this recipe.

DELISH!! Made them a little healhier by using 1 1/2 C wheat flour 1 C white flour and substituting applesauce for the vegetable oil. I left out the walnuts.  Like other reviewers, I did not have buttermilk so, I used soy milk and 2 t vinegar. Also, instead of the butter topping, I just sprinkled on some cinnamon and sugar. YUM YUM!

These turned out very nice.  I didn't modify the recipe at all.  I found that if I left the topping for 45 minutes, it was much easier to sprinkle on.

I love this recipe.  I've made many muffins in my time and this one is at the top of the list.  I've used other fruit and it works wonderful.  The only thing I changed was instead of using melted butter in the topping, I used softened butter.  It's easier to sprinkle evenly over the muffin.

A very moist muffin.  I added twice the sugar to the topping and loved it.  I'd make double the topping next time just to make sure all muffins are covered.

I love this recipe but added 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb and also put 1 tsp cinnamon in the batter as well. I don't always have buttermilk on had so I use buttermilk powder that you add water to make buttermilk.  I baked them for 20 minutes instead of 25 and they turned out great.  Will definitely make these again.

They are really moist!!! I was a little surprised that they didn't rise as much I thought they would. My crumble topping didn't quite work but I will tweek it a little next time. My husband LOVED them! ...as did I!

Great muffins!  I love the tart bites of rhubarb.  Using the brown sugar really makes them soft and moist.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I put 1 Tbsp. vinegar in a measuring cup and added milk to 1 cup.  The only other change I made was to leave out the walnuts.  Next time I might add some cinnamon to the batter.  I can't wait to have one with my coffee tomorrow morning!

These muffins turned out great.  I increased the rhubarb to 2 cups based on comments from others but would still be 5 stars with 1.5 cups.  When I make muffins they always turn out flat or just rounded a bit.  Always disappointing.  Did some searching for a solution and think I've found it.  I greased only the bottom of the muffin cups and half way up the side.  What a difference.  Best looking muffins I've ever made.  Definitely making these again especially with rhubarb in season now.

These muffins turned out absolutely delicious, even though I messed the directions up. I forgot to put the topping on until halfway through the cooking time. They were still moist and delicious, although maybe not as high as they would have been had I not opened the oven door to put the topping on. I used frozen rhubarb as there is no fresh here yet, and that worked out fine. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are very good. The recipe states it makes 24 muffins, therefore I halved everything to find it only made 6. Perhaps the presenter of the recipe was using very small muffin tins or paper cups. Next time I would use larger pieces of rhubarb and walnuts, because neither could be really tasted when diced. If you do not have buttermilk, you can use 2 tsp vinegar to 1c milk and leave to set, but I think buttermilk itself would give a better result. Also if you use grams as a measurement, 1 tbsp butter is equivalent to 15g when making the topping. The amounts for the topping given in recipe was enough to cover 6 muffins, so make double the mixture for 12. The topping finishes everything off very nicely, so don't go without it.

I have not made this as yet but do collect rhubarb recipes for both sweet and savory dishes. I noticed a few reviewers said they loved them but didn't have buttermilk. 
There are a couple substitutes for buttermilk which work quite well.:
Undrained, plain yogurt or sour cream, whisked with a little milk to thin, in recipes that call for buttermilk. 

Or combine a tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice with enough milk to make 1 cup. Set the latter mixture aside for five minutes before using.

Everyone enjoyed. I used Splenda brown sugar and I used the homemade buttermilk trick (lemon juice and milk). I made a touch larger in greased silicone cups so only yielded 19.

These are really good with a great consistency and flavor.   I love rhubarb, but it's not in season right now so I was stuck using some pretty sad looking stalks from the grocery store.   They had no flavor and didn't add much to the muffin even with 2 cups worth.   Can't wait to make these again when my friends are sharing their fresh growth from their yards!!  These would be great with any berries on hand too!   I got 15 muffins.

Wow - made exactly except put a bit more rhubarb and some cinnamon in flour mixture.  Also had to substitute vinegar & milk for buttermilk as I didn't have any. Just excellent! Thanks for the recipe -- will be making these again soon.

These were very tasty, with a nice texture.  I used all whole wheat flour, which gave them a bit more flavour and used coconut oil.  I substituted 1 cup milk with a tablespoon of vinegar for the buttermilk.  I made larger muffins, so only got 15 and had just enough topping.  If you make smaller muffins, you will need to make more topping.  Adding a teaspoon or so of cinnamon to the batter would make these five stars.  Will definitely make again!

I made these for my office.  I was a little hesitant considering the fruit is rhubarb which is not a commonly used fruit.  Well, no worries there!  They were gone in 15 minutes.  People raved over them.  I'll definitely make these again and again.

I made these the first time exactly as per the recipe (omitting the nuts) and was left with a lot of grease pooled in the bottom around the muffin cups. But I liked the overall taste.
I made them again today, attempting to make them a bit more nutritious, with the following changes:
I used whole wheat flour. Subbed 3/4 cup honey for the brown sugar. Didn't use nuts (never have since I send these to a nut-free school). Omitted the butter for the topping. Instead, just sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top. I could have used only a couple tbsp of sugar as I had a ton left over. I got 19 muffins, though I'm sure I could have made them a teensy bit smaller and gotten a few more.

These are unreal! I didn't even think I liked rhubarb!
I did the milk/vinegar sub for buttermilk and didn't change a thing else, it yielded 19 muffins for me (1/4 cup scoop).

Very tasty!! I have a similar recipe for a rhubarb cake that I was thinking I'd like to try making into muffins, but this recipe did it for me. I did use 2 cups of rhubarb and also had to double the sugar topping to be able to put 1 tsp on each muffin. Next time I may just put 1/2 tsp on each.

I made a few substitutions to the recipe cause of what I had in hand... used raw sugar instead of white, added an extra 1/2 cup of rhubarb cause I had no walnuts, and used applesauce for the oil. Overall these are great! I made regular muffin size and mini sized using paper cups. The regular turned out great and release from the paper cups well. I left the small ones in probably a minute or two too long and they are sticking to the paper a little bit. So just a caution when using paper cups not to get distracted!

Huge hit at home and at work! I made as written, but next time I'm going to increase the rhubarb to 2 cups.  There is enough batter to sustain the extra 1/2 cup.  I don't think the butter is needed for the topping.  Sprinkle on the cinnamon/sugar mixture and proceed with baking.  I baked in mini muffin pans and the recipe made 48 minis and 1 regular size muffin.  A delicious use of rhubarb!

These baked up beautifully and were well received. On a side note tho... I used frozen rubarb from our patch. As they had been in the freezer a bit, they were slightly "chewier" than I would prefer. I think, next time, I will bake up these muffins when the rubarb is fresh.

This recipe was really delicious it created a muffin that was sweet but not too sweet and it had just a slight amount of tart from the rhubarb but not a lot and that sugar topping was super delicious it added a nice little bit of texture and contrast to the moist,soft muffin

The hardest part about this recipe is getting rhubarb in season. I made 18 muffins - couldn't quite stretch it to 24.  Tasted great even with the healthier substitutions of half wheat flour, unsweetened applesauce (no oil), and Splendas for the sugars.

I made this recipe using two cups of frozen rhubarb as some other commenters had mentioned. I'm glad I did as it was the perfect amount of fruit for this muffin. Really nice balance of flavours in this muffin. If I have rhubarb on hand again I will make this again.

Loved loved loved these muffins. I added 2 cups of rhubarb too and it was yummy. A few batches I made with the sugar topping and then some other batches I didn't. Just as good without the topping, as you can taste the tartness more. Will do it again that is for sure.

We loved these, but I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons. First, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, and I think they would have been a little bland without that (though not terrible). I also felt like there wasn't enough fruit, even after replacing the walnuts with an equal amount of additional rhubarb. This recipe was still very good, in spite of those minor details! Even my picky toddler enjoyed a muffin. :-)

I can't imagine a better rhubarb muffin recipe. They have wonderful texture, not too much oil, and great taste. The streusel really makes it. Follow recipe exactly (though I used milk with vinegar to replace buttermilk). No need to change anything!

These are unbelievably tasty muffins. I brought these and some To Die For Blueberry Muffins with me this weekend for the green room of an event I staff, and they were both a big hit. The first person there who tried one stopped in the middle of a conversation he was having to state, "What you're saying is great, but the only thing that matters right now is how delicious this muffin is." The recipe makes roughly 24 small muffins, the event started Friday, and by Saturday afternoon there were only two left, and those were gone the next day. We only left them out during the mornings, so they went like hotcakes. I will definitely be bringing these to the green room next year, and plan on keeping them in my regular rotation as well. Possibly the greatest muffins of all time.

I love rhubarb and this is a great recipe. I followed the recipe with the exception of using 1/3 cup instead of the 1/2 cup measure. It was not a preference, I just read my measuring cups wrong. With this mistake, they are still tasty and moist. Thank you for the recipe.

These are very good. I followed the advice to add more rhubarb and I think that was absolutely necessary. I ended up adding a total of 2 1/4 cups and next time think I'll use another half. I also added a bit of cinnamon to the batter which was a good choice. I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil, a change I almost always make and a good choice given the oily feel of the muffin liners as I took these out of the pan. I used almonds for the nuts and also used almond extract instead of vanilla. I doubled the amount of topping using 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I worked in softened butter and also added some broken almond slices. That was necessary to get enough topping for the 24 standard sized muffins that I got out of this recipe. A good mix of flavors.

These are delicious! Unfortunately my 2 oldest boys did not like them (fault of the rhubarb, or perhaps pieces which were cut too large for their liking).
I changed it up only a bit to suit our tastes and what I had on hand. I hadn't any white sugar on hand, so I subbed brown sugar for the topping. Nor did I have walnuts, so I just left those out. We also like to add a little rye flour to all our recipes, so 1/5 of the flour was rye and we only keep milk kefir around, so I used that instead of buttermilk. Lastly, I cut the sugar down to just 1 cup for the muffins.
These were very moist. Thanks for the recipe!

This is now my go-to recipe for Rhubarb Muffins.  Fabulous!  
I had to make some adjustment due to ingredient shortage/lack: 
Used 2 c flour + 1/4 c ground flax + 1/4 c ground almond meal to make the difference. I also added a dash of cinnamon to the muffin batter.
Used 1/4 c veg oil + 1/4 c coconut oil.  
And because I have nut-haters at my house, I left the walnuts out and used extra rhubarb.  
I will never use another recipe!  These turned out 16 muffins, rather than two dozen.

I made these exactly as directed and I found the contrast between the sour rhubarb and the muffin mix unpleasant.  The muffins were too moist even though I baked them for an additional 5 minutes.  
I love using rhubarb in the spring, but this recipe won't be one I use again.

Good.  Subbed pecans for walnuts.  The predominant flavors were cinnamon and nuts.  Make sure the topping is spread evenly or any clumps will sink into the muffin.

These muffins have a perfect balance between the sweet and the tartness of the rhubarb.  The walnuts add a great crunch along with the topping. They are perfect as the recipe is written. Outstanding!

This is a great recipie, (I add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as well). The muffin tastes great and the topping gives them a fancy, bakeryl-like feel. Pay attention to the amount of rhubarb, I've made it with 2 full cups and it lost its nice, 'cake-like' bouncy ness! A nice alternative to rhubarb pie :) thanks for posting!!

Very nice!  I made only a few small modifications to the recipe.  First, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1.5 tsp. of baking powder for nice, fluffy muffins.  I also added a healthy shake of cinnamon to the dry ingredients - it just seemed like the right thing to do!  They turned out great - just the right amount of sweetness for the tart rhubarb, especially with the topping.  Thanks!

I eliminated the oil and buttermilk, and substituted Greek vanilla yogurt. They turned out great! My mother makes rhubarb sauce (just like apple sauce but with rhubarb)--next time, I'll use some of that with the yogurt to give the cake part of the muffin a little more rhubarb flavor. Yum! My husband ate 5 right out of the oven. Like other raters, I didn't use nuts in my recipe--they didn't need any.

Very good recipe.  I followed recipe as written plus added 1/2 cup fresh blueberries.  It made 20 nice sized muffins. I could have gotten 24 if I didn't quite fill papers to the top.  My topping was more drizzly rather than crumbly (probably because I melted butter in microwave )but it didn't take away from the flavor.  For a crumble topping I would just cut cold butter into sugar cinnamon mix. Will definately make again and experiment w/various fruits.

These were delicious!  After reading the reviews, I increased the rhubarb to 2 cups, chopped into very small pieces.  I also added a little bit of oatmeal to the sugar topping and I really liked the texture.  

I was missing one of my muffin pans, so I ended up making 4 muffins and putting the rest of the batter in a 8x8 pan and both versions were very good.  I think that a 9 x 13 pan would work well for all of the batter - I just wanted to try it in muffin form as well.

I really liked the texture of the muffin and I think that I will use this as my basic muffin recipe (once rhubarb is out of season).  I LOVE the flavor of rhubarb, but I think that it will work well with different fruits.

To die for! I took other reviewers suggestions and made it 2 full cups of finely chopped rhubarb (used my hand chopper) and omitted the walnuts (which I usually adore). The rhubarb definitely took center stage. I'm going to have a hard time using my rhubarb for anything else! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I really like this recipe.  I think for the topping I had too much butter because it was a bit too liquid to sprinkle, but I eyeballed this measurement so could be me.  My son insisted on sprinkles on top of some of the muffins.  In order to be able to send as a school snack (nut free) I replaced the walnuts with white chocolate chips which were very good.  Kids loved these.  I also boiled the rhubarb and also added a handful of frozen strawberries.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious & moist! Made them just as the recipe directed plus 1/2t cinnamon in the batter. It made 12 full size muffins which would be the only contradiction, but I did fill the tin to the top. Love the cinnamon sugar topping too!

Awesome!  I followed some of the other suggestions, increased rhubarb to 2 cups, used homemade cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil, eliminated nuts (personal preference).  Next time would probably increase the amount of sugar needed for the topping.  The single recipe made 18 standard size muffins and the topping just barely made it at less than a teaspoon per muffin.

I have made this recipe several times now, and love the rhubarb which I just dice and throw in, it gives it a lovely tang to the muffins. I didn't like the sugar topping much so I shall just sprinkle cinnamon over them next time. Why this fad for mixing food with hands, it is so messy, what is wrong with spoons and spatulas, they do the job just as well.

This recipe was a huge hit at our girls weekend.  Everyone loved them.  Not too sweet or tart and the  topping is just right.  Very moist so I will try with app,e or blueberry the next time.  These made me wish I had more rhubarb!  I too used 2 cups of rhubarb and they were perfect!  Thanks for this recipe, a definite keeper!

My absolute favorite muffins.  I leave out the nuts, fill the paper muffin cups to almost the top and use extra topping.  They come out big, super moist and delicious.

I was nervous when my batter was thick (like peanut butter), however these turned out great! I doubled the recipe and got 24 reg. muffins and 24 minis. Changes (recipe doubled) 1tsp extra baking powder, 1 c extra rhubarb, omitted crumb topping. I didn't have buttermilk so I used the vinegar/milk substitute. I stirred it all by hand. They were fluffy and delicious, even without extra butter! Another tasty & easy muffin recipe :)

Delicious!  Left out walnuts so the kids wouldn't complain.  I would add more rhubarb next time so you get fruit in every bite!  Will also try replacing half the oil with applesauce and half the white flour with whole wheat.

Delicious! I have celiac, so I replaced the flour with Namaste's flour blend for baking. I also had to take out the walnuts due to allergies in my house, so I threw in some dark chocolate chips instead. These were really yummy. We will definitely be making these again when we get more rhubarb from our farm coop.

I "healthified" this recipe and they were still very good. I subbed in whole wheat flour for slightly less than half of the flour, subbed wheat germ for the walnuts, and omitted the melted butter. I halved the recipe (using a whole egg with 1/2 yolk) expecting to yield 24 mini muffins, but only ended up with 14. These rise quite a bit. I will also try applesauce in place of the oil next time.

The muffins were light and fluffy, I just wasn't crazy about the topping. I think I'd like more of a streusel topping or just cinnamon sugar. I used two large stalks which equaled about 2 cups of diced Rhubarb. My batch made 22 muffins.

Aunt Norma's rhubarb muffins are fabulous! Very easy to make.  I love the sugar/cinnamon topping! Next time I might try 1/2 whole wheat flour and more rhubarb.

Moist and tasty. The rhubarb really adds a great flavour; I also added some chopped strawberries instead of the nuts. I made 1/2 the recipe and it yielded 10 muffins rather than 12. They are actually quite sweet despite the rhubarb!

I have to agree with so many reviews on this site!  These muffins are wonderful!  The next time I make them I will probably add a bit more rhubarb.  I did chop up the rhubarb in fairly fine pieces and used pecans instead of walnuts just because of personal choice.

AWESOME!!! I changed just a bit as I only had whole wheat flour on hand and not quite enough milk so I juiced and orange and added about 1 tsp of the zest as well.  They turned out perfectly.  Thank you ?

Maybe my rhubarb wasn't as fresh as it should have been or maybe it's b/c I subbed 1/2c whole wheat for some of the white flour, but I kind of found these bland and boring.  My favorite part was the buttery sugar topping (that I sprinkled on during the last 5mins in the oven).

Thanks for this recipe Charliebabe.  It is very very good and makes such a good snack or desert. Nothing is needed on them as quoted earlier.  I did up the rhubarb on my 2nd batch to 2 cups like others suggested and they are just sensational.

I needed to make something quick for my daughter's snack for school.  I didn't have any rhubarb, so I added two peeled and shredded apples.   Wow, they were really good.  The only thing I will do differently next time is mix the baking soda with a few tablespoons of vinegar and add it to wet ingredients right before mixing with flour mixture.  You can taste the baking soda in this recipe and I know it could be avoided by adding vinegar to the baking soda.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

They were delicious although  a bit dry. Perhaps because I was a bit short on the brown sugar and I used whole wheat pastry flour. The next time I'll add a bit more oil.

Delicious muffin!  The whole family devoured them.  Lol
I followed the recipe but did not add nuts due to personal preference.  I chose to add cinnamon and lemon zest to the batter.  I was also making a rhubarb strawberry sauce that called for the juice of a lemon in that recipe and didn’t want to waste the lemon zest!  Lol.  It complemented the rhubarb muffin very well.

Delicous!!  So fluffy and flavorful.  I did add a 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg to batter because reviewers had mentioned it and it sounded good.  I'm sure it'd be fine without them though too

These muffins are delicious and fluffy. If I made them again I would add an extra cup of rhubarb for more flavour. Also I would substitute some white flour for whole wheat flour to make them healthier.

Disappointing. As others mentioned, fairly bland. If I tried them again, I'd use the bread version of this recipe and add either strawberries or raspberries and double the cinnamon topping.

Very moist, but would chop the rhubarb smaller next time. Also, due to personal preferences, I omitted nuts and cinnamon and substituted orange zest and grated ginger.

I did my own sour milk for lack of buttermilk. I put 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb but no nuts. Extra cinnamon in the batter (1/2 tsp) and then put abut 1/3 cup of oats in the sprinkle on the top with another Tbsp. of butter. They look amazing and my tester/guinea pig, gave me a thumbs up!

The flavor wasn't too sweet but I found it needs twice as much rhubarb or even more. I couldn't tell if was rhubarb.

I saw all the ingredients and thought it would be complicated. It wasn't! I made 6 large muffins instead of 12 regular ones since they are for hubby for work. Cooked them for 35 minutes. My sugar crumble didn't melt but oh well. lol Love, love, love these.  Easy and so delicious. I didn't have nuts so added some frozen wild blueberries, am pleased with the result, did I say I love these? Well I do and will make them again.

Amazing recipe!  They turned out great!!!  I did use 2 cups of rhubarb though.  This recipe made 20 muffins for me.  This recipe is super simple and quick to whip up!

I didn't have buttermilk, I substituted water/sourcream. I used honey/oats/crunch in place of the walnuts and chopped up a couple of strawberries I had left over. 

Absolutely loved them, they are a little bland,  but I prefer this. The butter/sugar/cinnamon top gives it a perfect sweet balance.

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly as written though I did add an extra 1/2 cup rhubarb. Ther are a bit on the crumbly side but maybe that was my error. Either way, I'll be making them again!

I used half strawberries and half rhubarb because I was using rhubarb in something else and this was my "extra rhubarb" recipe. I also exchanged pecans for walnuts because I am allergic to walnuts and used oat milk with a tbsp of vinegar instead of butter milk because I am dairy intolerant. I will definitely be making these again!

Better than expected!  Made 15 cupcakes omitting the nuts and using 1% milk w/1 T vinegar to reduce fat.  I cut rhubarb in bigger chunks and will continue to make this recipe as it’s now one of my favorites.

These muffins were absolutely DIVINE! I made the blueberry version of them, and it tasted great! A tip is to make sure you put A LOT of the cinnamon sugar topping on top! It helps. The texture was nice and airy. I think you should bake it graudly tho. I put my tempature to 315 and baked for 30 minutes and it turned out to have A LOT of more flavor. I dont know how, but it did! Definitely a new go to!

I thought they were not rhubarby enough but my son and husband really enjoyed them.  I did not put in the walnuts as my husband doesn't eat them and I also increased the cinnamon.  The butter/sugar/cinnamon crust on top was delicious.

These muffins are moist and delicious. I made mine in muffin cups which yielded 8 large muffins. I used coconut oil in mine because that's what I always use in baking. I also used frozen rhubarb that I harvested last summer.

I used sour cream rather than buttermilk, more walnuts and more rhubarb, and added cinnamon into the batter. My rhubarb came from from my freezer so I cooked it a bit and drained it before adding it into the recipe.

1/19/19:  I thought that these were great.  I might add some cinnamon to the batter next time.  James would prefer not to have walnuts included since he thought that it distracted from the rhubarb, but I like the texture of them.   Also, I'd consider doubling the topping next time.

Very good & tasty ! I have been craving a rhubard pie but instead made these muffins, delicious . I  used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, because I didn’t have any. Also used the lactose milk and vinegar for buttermilk ,  worked very well! Made them smaller to cut portions and serve more folks.

Used pecans in place of walnuts and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar. Also mixed the liquids by hand and folded into the dry then added chopped frozen rhubarb and chopped pecans.  Really nice flavour, tang of rhubarb ofset by the nutty flavour and brown sugar batter.  Will be added to my go to muffin list. Thanks for sharing.

Perfect sweetness.  Some great tartness too.  A great way to use rhubarb.  I chopped it pretty small.  I used WW pastry flour and extra cinnamon.  A big hit with family, and grandchild.  Easy, fast, and delicious.

I thought these were great muffins. It's a great way to use my rhubarb. The muffins were moist and tasty. I made some changes to the recipe. After reading the reviews, I added a little bit more rhubarb--2 cups instead of 1-1/2 cups--and I used 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder instead of 1 tsp. Also, I used allspice instead of cinnamon because I just like it better. I added 1 tsp. of allspice to the batter and substituted allspice for the cinnamon in the topping. The muffins were wonderful. The sweet, crunchy topping was good too, but I think I might make the muffins without it next time. I think they would be great even without the extra sugar and sweetness of the topping.

These may be my very favorite muffins. They have just the right amount of tartness and sweetness. I did increase the rhubarb to 2 cups because I love it and threw in a few chopped up strawberries. My batch made 18 muffins and I used less than half of the topping.

I made them as directed but I added more sugar to the topping mixture.  They were delicious but the topping settled at the bottom and were a bit sticky and difficult to get out of the pans.

Excellent recipe!   I've  tried  other  recipes,  but this one is  the best- my family & friends  love it!  The only change I made was  adding extra cinnamon,  since we  love  that mixture with the rhubarb.  Next time  I may add  a  bit directly into the batter.  A few more nuts would be good for us,  too, as we love walnuts.  Excellent and Easy!!

A true keeper! My garden is abundant with rhubarb and I make muffins for my B&B guests so always like to try new recipes. Like others, I omitted the walnuts as I wanted to rhubarb to stand out on its own. I also doubled the baking powder. My standard ratio is usually BP is 4X soda/salt. So having it equal just seemed wrong. I didn't measure the sugar but I bet it was about 1/4 what was called for. And the rhubarb was probably more than called for as well. I went more for the look. I know rhubarb is tart, but I just couldn't use that amount of sugar. For this reason, I don't give 5 *. If I used all the sugar per the recipe it would have been too sweet (but that's me...I prefer a breakfast muffin more like bread than a sweet cake treat). I certainly saved this recipe and look forward to serving it up again to my guests, with some fresh strawberry preserve.

I made a few changes to the recipe.       I doubled the crumble top, used double the amount of rhubarb and milk with 2tsp of vinegar instead of buttermilk and also no nuts (due to allergies).    Were absolutely perfect.

I had my doubts, I love rhubarb but I've never had a good rhubarb muffin. This recipe proved me wrong, these muffins are wonderful. I had a gathering of ten people over and they all loved them. I did what other people advised to do, I added 1 1/2 tsp of Baking Powder rather than 1, I also increased the amount of rhubarb, plus add 3/4 of a cup of strawberries.

I have made this a number of times.  I normally don't use the topping.  It turns out very nice.  I have tried a couple of variations.  Rather than using fresh Rhubarb I have used powdered dehydrated rhubarb.  Take a cup and a half of applesauce and a quarter cup of dried rhubarb mixed together and sit overnight as a substitution for the fresh rhubarb.  Then add a half tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  This also works very well.

Absolutely stunning.  I love the sweet taste of the topping mixed with the sour rhubarb. I adored the taste of the walnuts with the rest of the ingredients. Next time I will add Hickory nuts instead of walnuts. Great recipe, charliebabe!

Aunt Norma's Rhubarb Muffins are delicious! I made a batch a couple of days ago for myself and to share with two elderly widowed neighbours that I have come to know since moving onto this street. My husband is NOT a 'rhubarb man' so what better way to get them all eaten than through sharing with others? As with many of us, I made a few substitions. I switched up the buttermilk with milk I'd soured with a bit of vinegar and to bring it to the correct measure I added the last of some plain Greek yogurt I wanted to finish off and I added some vanilla to the liquids mixture. Who does not like vanilla's magic? All other ingredients were the same proportions. The muffins were absolutely wonderful and my two ladies on the street loved them wanting yo know all about the ingredients! I found the recipe made 12 regular muffins and I had enough batter leftover to also make 9 of the mini-sized muffins. The next time I make them, I will increase the amount of diced rhubarb so that every bite has some of its deliciousness!

Doubled recipe and it made 3 dozen muffins.  Very good recipe - made half with the sugar topping and half without - prefer without.  Will absolutely use this recipe again but incorporate extra rhubarb next time.

Good recipe that I'll make again.  I got 17 muffins out of this as written.  One small tweak was to add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the flour mixture, which I'll up to 1/2 tsp next time, and I used pecans instead of walnuts only because that's what I had.   Very tasty.

Holy moly these muffins are fabulous.  Fluffy and moist, not too sweet. Made no changes! Next time I'll add an extra 1/2 cup of rhubarb but otherwise these morsels are perf.

Wonderful and fantastic flavor! Use muffin liner cups so that they come out of the pan easier. I did not have buttermilk and used the substitute recommended by others (1 Tbsp. Lemon juice in 1 cup milk and sit for 5 minutes). The muffins are moist and full of flavor - it is best when you use more rhubarb (I used 2+ cups diced up). Love then tang of the rhubarb in every bite! Thanks for a great recipie!!

Moist, and yummy.  I chopped rhubarb fine.  Sugar topping just sits on top, so a little messy.  I am going to try to press it in more next time.  Rhubarb is tart but this muffin was eaten quickly by my son and husband!

This muffin recipe is loved by my grandson in college as well as my 93 year old Mom.  It's moist and just a little tart on the inside with a sweet, crunchy topping.  Perfect combination.

These muffins are perfect. i made them exactly as the recipe says, and they are light and delicious. I didn't  use the streusel topping  because of time so they weren't too sweet but scrumptious anyways.

I made this recipe as a Bundt cake.  I increased the rhubarb to 2  1/2 cups and put the sugar topping in the bottom of the pan so that it would be on the top of the cake when I flipped it.  Since I was making a cake I increased the cooking time to 40 minutes.  It was delicious.

These are great! I'm not a Rhubarb fan but we have some in our yard so every year I make these. This year I took them to my child's end of the year breakfast and got several requests for the recipe. I made them as stated with the exception of leaving out the nuts and making mini ones. (It made 60ish minis.) I baked them for 9 minutes.

These are the Bomb!! I used 2 cups rhubarb and used a streusel with brown sugar. We like walnuts so I put those in and didn't feel the taste was overwhelming. I will need to tweak it a little to work with high altitude, but other than that, best rhubarb muffins I've ever made.

Could not find any Rhubarb here in the south so substituted dried cranberries instead. I just covered the cranberries in water covered it and microwaved it for about 45 seconds and let them sit for 5 mins to re-hydrate them.  Muffins tasted great.

Fantastic! I will definitely make these again! I did add a bit more rhubarb, but only because I had some leftover. It made them a little bit more tart, which I loved!

This wasn't my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly and the bottoms of the muffins were beginning to scorch by the alloted baking time was over;  possibly due to the temperature or the length of baking time. I'm at sea level so not sure if that made a difference. As well the sugar topping did burn where it ran down the sides of the muffin tin. If I were to try this recipe again I'd make a different type of topping that isn't so runny and check for doneness sooner. Not all was lost as I have one very not picky eater who finished them off but without him I think I would have ended up throwing these out.

This is an AMAZING muffin!!! I made it with the plan to freeze them to take out and eat here and there. I don't think they're going to make it to the freezer! I ate three right out of the oven--soooo yummy. As for the recipe, I changed the oil to coconut oil, increased the rhubarb to two cups, diced finely. I used pure cane sugar. I will definitely be more motivated to pick my rhubarb!

A good little muffin recipe.  I cut the sugar in half and substituted homemade applesauce for half of the oil.  I think I'll modify the topping next time by adding some oats and using cut, not melted, butter.

Really good! Also works well with apples or strawberries mixed with the rhubarb.

Chop the nuts COARSELY, otherwise they aren't that noticeable. Be conservative with how much you sprinkle on the top (I found it too sugary).

I made a vegan version using a 1/4 cup of mashed banana instead of egg, so mine had an added sweetness to them.

Very good, Found muffins were not sour but also not too sweet. Didn't have buttermilk, added 1 Tablespoon vinegar to milk & let stand 1-2 minutes before mixing into recipe. Will definitely make again, I have a large rhubarb plant, always looking for ways to use it.

I just finished eating one of these and it was delicious. I did follow the recommendation of some reviewers and I added 2 cups of rhubarb instead of 1 1/2 simply because I wanted it to be more fruity. They turned out perfect! Since I have some fresh strawberries as well as some more rhubarb, I am going to whip up some more substituting some of the rhubarb with strawberries. Since my husband doesn't really care for rhubarb or strawberries, I plan to freeze some of these for me to eat later!

Some reviewers mentioned they did not get two dozen muffins. I didn't either. I got 18 muffins. I used a standard muffin pan and used slightly under 1/4 cup for each muffin. The result was a muffin with a nice looking crown. If you want a small muffin that does not rise above the muffin cup, perhaps you could manage to get 24 but I don't think you can if like me, you want some height to your muffins. Still, I think this is recipe is a keeper!

These were great!  I skipped the crumbly topping; they're plenty sweet/good without it .  The only thing I have changed since the first time I made it is to add more rhubarb.  I add at least a cup more.  It makes the muffins even more moist, and we like the increased tart to sweet ratio you get by adding more rhubarb.

Really tasty muffins! I cut the recipe in half, but still used 1 whole egg. I cut back on the buttermilk by 1 Tblsp to make up for the additional liquid from using the whole egg for half a recipe. They were delicious! Oh, and I only got 9 muffins out of half a recipe (not 12 as I was expecting).

This is an excellent muffin that is similar to a cranberry muffin.

Changes:
1. I used gluten-free flour, but the recipe still came out moist and airy.

2.  I didn't have nuts on hand and had some extra rhubarb so I upped the rhubarb to two cups.

3. To reduce the sugar in the recipe, I didn't include the white sugar in the topping, but it would have been better with some sugar mixed with the cinnamon so next time I'll cut the brown sugar to a cup and use a 1/4 cup of white sugar in the topping.

It was great to find a recipe that would be useful for my abundant crop of rhubarb.  It did make several changes and saved them to my personal recipe box.  I made the following substitutions:  1 1/4 cups Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour;  1/4 cup + two tablespoons Splenda/sugar blend; 1/4 cup coconut oil; 1/4 cup egg substitute; 1/2 cup Silk unsweetened coconut milk; 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes in place of nuts;  extra coconut flakes for the topping.

Made the recipe as written, but added an additional 3/4 cup rhubarb, and increased walnuts to 3/4 cup.  Moist, delicious!

These were quite tasty but seemed to be missing something. Like other reviewers mentioned, I would probably add some cinnamon into the batter to add a bit more flavour. The only modification I made was to make buttermilk using milk and lemon juice. I also omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand.

I made this as 2 mini loaves of bread and 4 giant muffins instead of all regular muffins, baking at 300 degrees for well over an hour (the muffins less time).  I used 2 cups rhubarb (per others) and subbed in applesauce for part of the oil.  This was a tasty recipe, especially the topping!  I am always looking for ways to use up rhubarb and this was yummy.

My family was skeptical that anything that looks like a cross between celery and a stick could taste good in muffins, but this recipe made them huge fans.  They asked me to get more stalks so that I could make it again.  The only change to the recipe was to double the topping and I added a bit of flour to it to make it a little more crumbly.  Made for a great lid on a super muffin.

These are absolutely wonderful. Moist, delicate texture and not too sweet. The only thing I changed was using Greek vanilla yogurt in place of the buttermilk. I also added an extra cup of rhubarb.

I vegan-ized this recipe and made quite a few tweaks and they turned out very good!  I used 1.5 cups whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup regular flour; coconut sugar instead of brown sugar; used half apple sauce with the oil; used almond milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice for the buttermilk and a flax egg instead of a regular egg; and added 1/4 cup oats and 3/4 tsp cinnamon to the recipe... also for the crumb topping I only used 1.5 tbsp sugar and added 1/3 cup oats with margerine/cinnamon to make the crumble - light and fluffy muffins with a nice crumble topping!  Yum.

Well that was a great recipe.  What a fun way to use our abundance of rhubarb.   My only change to the recipe was using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  They came out perfectly moist.  Consistency was also good: not too crumbly.  I'll be making these again.  And again.  And again.  As long as my rhubarb keeps producing!

My husband and I are both diabetic so I substituted Spleda blend brown sugar. I also topped them with Spleda, butter, and cinnamon mixture. They where outstanding. My husband said they where the best muffins I ever made. I took a suggestion from a fellow reviewer and used 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda. I also made "sour milk" by combining  appox. 1/4 whipping cream with  enough skim milk  to make a cup. I added a teaspoon of vinegar. I let that sit out for about 5 minutes.  That might make it full of fat but it sure made it good! I substituted pecans for the Walnuts. I am not a fan of walnuts.

The best recipe for rhubarb, and really the best muffins I have every had.  A coworker brought them to work one day, and I asked her for the recipe.  When I made the first batch I substituted pepitas for walnuts, added orange juice to the milk instead of buttermilk, because they were on hand.   I used real butter and cinnamon I ground myself for the topping, and increased the rhubarb to 2 cups.. Awesome, the red rhubarb colour, and the green pumpkin seeds looked great.  The result was a professional looking muffin., the flavours are surprisingly complex, and the flavour sublime.  Kudos to Aunt Norma!

This is the way I most often use the rhubarb from my garden. The kids love it! And so do I. I do make some adjustments to make it a bit healthier. I omit the vegetable oil all together and substitute unsweetened applesauce. We like the tartness of the rhubarb, so I cut the brown sugar in half. Sometimes I substitute have the flower for whole wheat flour. Anyway you do it, this is a delicious recipe! Thank you :-)

1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg 
1/4 tsp cardamom

Lots of flavour, great texture.  I omitted the nuts and added extra rhubarb.  I used a little lemon juice in milk and let it sit for a few minutes instead of the buttermilk as I didn't have buttermilk.  An easy recipe, I will continue to use it.

Only problem with this recipe...... Having to make a second batch 2 hours later, they were so good. My teenage boys inhaled them. I used 1% milk instead of buttermilk, only because I didn't have any buttermilk. Still turned out excellent.

This recipe produced lovely, light textured muffins.  I did substitute the oil with homemade, unsweetened applesauce, which did not change the taste or texture of these muffins but did lower the fat.  Next time (and there will be), I 'll likely tailor it to my own tastes by adding cinnamon directly to the batter and omitting the walnuts.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Fluffy and moist! I did not have buttermilk so did lemon juice added to milk substitution. I also didn't have nuts so threw in a handful of shredded coconut which paired well with the rhubarb. The only other thing I would do next time is upping the rhubarb to 2 cups.

Fantastic, a hit with the whole family! I didn't have brown sugar on hand so I added 2 tbsp of molasses. I omitted the walnuts. It seemed like too much sugar for the topping so I cut it in half. This made it hard to "sprinkle" but I managed to dole it out.

The buttermilk makes a huge difference.  I cut the sugar in the batter and substituted some of the rhubarb with chopped apple and is turned out wonderful.

I made these for my mother-in-law who loves rhubarb. Very good recipe, but definitely be sure to increase the amount of rhubarb as 1.5 cups isn't quite enough to get a bit of rhubarb in every bite. Otherwise, a great recipe!

Too sweet, could hardly taste the rhubarb, and the tops caved in under the crumble on top. 
Next time I would start with half the amount of sugar, and add cinnamon to the batter, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar, no butter in the topping, it was too heavy.
I substituted gluten-free flour which has xanthum gum in it, and did not add the nuts, added a little extra rhubarb.

Excellent! I did tweek it a little by substituting a Motts single serve apple sauce for the oil (it cuts back on the oil and adds fruity goodness instead, all the while still baking up perfectly and very moist.) as well as adding nutmeg to the dry ingredients for a little more flavour. I have never baked with rhubarb before, and am definitely won over by this recipe. Yum, yum, yummy!

Awesome muffins!  I gave the recipe four stars only because I used a strong 2 cups rhubarb and I used another reviewers suggestion for topping, which was awesome.  1/3 c brown sugar, 1 tbls flour, 1 tbls butter, 1/8 tsp cinnamon.

This is my husband's favorite muffin recipe. I made a few changes. I use 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, use 1/2 c loose pack brown sugar and 2/3 c Splenda in place of the brown sugar, use 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c white flour, I add about 1 c rolled oats and cut the topping by half. And I increase the rhubarb to 2 or 2 1/2 cups depending on

Delicious and so easy to make. My changes include adding 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon and 0.5 teaspoon nutmeg and cardamon to the dry ingredients and decreasing the brown sugar to 3\4 c.. I mixed 0.5 cup of the flour into the rhubarb and set it aside, combined the rest of the dry ingredients together in one bowl, and all of the wet ones into another. As with many others, I used milk and lemon juice in place of the buttermilk. After quickly mixing the wet and dry ingredients, I swirled in the rhubarb and flour. I divided the batter between 12 mini loaves and topped them with a double batch of the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon crumble. The muffins took an extra 5 minutes to cook.

Option: Apple and almonds

These were so light and yummy.  The baking time was perfect.  I got 15 very full muffins.  We loved the addition of the walnuts.  I did change the topping to a bit of butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, oatmeal recipe.

Great recipe. Made it as written first time but then made some modifications to make it meet my preferences. I upped the rhubarb to 2 cups, cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup and found it to be sweet enough while preserving the tartness of the rhubarb. I've also skipped the topping to reduce the amount of sugar but it is nice to have a crunchy streusel topping. This is a keeper!

I used applesauce instead of oil, and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mix. Very good flavor, but the texture is a big tough, not as moist as I'd hoped. Could be due to the applesauce though. Overall, very tasty way to enjoy my rhubarb!

These were fabulous.  I doubled the recipe and added 4 cups of rhubarb and more cinnamon as we love it.  I brought some into work and they were eaten up in no time.  I had several requests for the recipe.  Really great muffins.  I baked mine less than called for as oven temps vary.  They were extremely moist and delicious.  This is a keeper.

Wow! Amazing. I was looking for a great rhubarb recipe since I have two giant plants in my backyard. So so great. I added 1 cup of apples and doubled the recipe. I will bring these to work and my clients will go insane! Such a great recipe. I added a bit of granola cereal to the topping and it adds a bit more texture to the muffin.

really enjoyed these! Reminder not to dice the rhubarb too small otherwise you can't tell it's an ingredient. These made 18 muffins for me.

These really are five star! I used two cups of fruit and milk soured with vinegar. Before baking, I sprinkled the topping with crystalized baking sugar. Mouthwatering good!

I used powdered buttermilk in this. I always have it on hand. Keeps well refrigerated. If in cupboard it dries out.
I doubled the topping as was not enough for 24 muffins.
Are in the oven as I type. 
Cant wait to try them

Turned out amazing!  I swapped out a few items this time for healthier choices and liked the result even better than the original recipe.
Whole wheat flour vs white.
Coconut oil vs. vegetable oil. 
(Modified baking temp to 340 because coconut oil's smoke point is 350.)
Used milk + lemon juice + 2-3T sour cream instead of 2c buttermilk (Total quantity still came to 2c).
Added about 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter.
Delicious!!!

Seriously, these are SUPER delicious!  And it makes 2 dozen muffins! (Ok, I think I made 20 very full muffins)  I added about a 1/2 cup more rhubarb and omitted the walnuts.  I will be making these again for sure!

This recipe is fabulous.  I never review recipes that I've changed.  I made this as written, EXCEPT for the nuts which I left out.  I am a muffin maker, and this is one of the best I've ever made.  Thanks so much for submitting!

YUM!!!  This is my second recipe experimenting with rhubarb.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/2 milk (I halved the recipe for our family) and 2 tsp. white vinegar and let it set until I had everything else ready.  I also used slightly less brown sugar and added just a pinch more baking powder (1/4 tsp.) and about a 1/2 tsp.of cinnamon and added 1/4 - 1/2 c. more rhubarb based on reviews.  I also replaced the vegetable oil with walnut oil; it adds a nice subtle nutty flavor.  This is definitely a keeper.

My son had picked some rhubarb and wanted me to "make something yummy" with it so I though muffins would be quick and fairly easy. I made this recipe just how it says and it was good! It was sweet with the tart little bits of rhubarb which seemed alittle strange at first but worked. Besides the topping they are a tad bit bland (my son declared after the 2nd muffin that he now only likes the top) but unless I come across a better recipe I will probably make these again.

I couldn't remember if I had left my review of these muffins but I am getting ready to make them again and cannot say enough about how wonderful these little gems are! I have honestly never had a better muffin from anyone or anywhere else in my life. These are delicious! One time, I made them for my sister (she isn't a fan of rhubarb) and used raspberries. Even with the substitution, these were still amazing! I like the recipe the way it is written. You do not need to run out and buy a container of buttermilk either. As long as you have some milk and vinegar, it is just the same. I strongly recommend this recipe for rhubarb lovers who are looking for a new, delicious way to use up some of your rhubarb and for those who aren't sure if they like rhubarb. These muffins will seal the deal!

Baked this recipe as written and was rewarded with my favorite homemade muffins to date! Moist, fluffy, perfect balance of sweet and tart with that cinnamon kick. As the recipe implores, be sure not to overmix your batter to ensure this outcome. The neighbors were delighted, as were my rhubarb-doubtful husband and son. Now, to bake more deliciousness with the leftover buttermilk!

Made it healthier. Used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup Spelt flour, 1/2 cup unbleached flour instead of 2 1/2 cups of flour. Used 1/4 cup melted organic coconut oil and 1 small container applesauce instead of oil. Big hit!

I made this as written, except that I used two cups of rhubarb. Next time I hope to add more flavour to the batter by adding either nutmeg or cinnamon to it. Should replace the oil with applesauce. May omit the topping, and spread cinnamon butter on heated muffins... or even almond butter. Will update once I've retested.

Really good muffins.  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Also did 2 cups rhubarb.  Adding nuts was great idea since it gave them a nice little crunch.  I skipped the crumb topping since i usually have bad luck with them.  I wished i hadn't since I would have liked the muffins a little sweeter, but my husband loved them.  Will try with the topping next time.
