This recipe was awesome!  I would have to agree though that the recipe calls for WAAAAY too much sugar.  I would only use 3T. of sugar.  Other than that, it was to die for!!

I had everything, except for the lime juice, and it was still fabulous. I used half the sugar and it was more than enough. A fantastic drink for summer!
