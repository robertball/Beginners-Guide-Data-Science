Outside, a snowy Boxing Day... inside, lot's of stale bread in the cubboard... Snow Day French Toast... Perfect!  
This is so easy and good!  I like how the sugar caramelizes, *slurp!*, and how this French Toast recipie does not require cinnamon (no cinnamon fan).  I did do a little variation, using buttermilk, normal bread, and light brown sugar.  Tip: Make sure you mix the batter frequently, the heavy nutmeg sits on the bottom with the result that the last bread slices are extra nutmeggy.

This turned out super sweet!  I don't know if it's great idea to dip the bread in sugar and then griddle it.  The sugar melts and gets everything sticky and burns before the toast is cooked all the way.  And after you put it on a plate it sticks to the plate and you have to literally scrape it off.   Not for me.

The recipe ended up being delicious...after a slight trial and error process. The recipe says to soak bread in the egg mixture. I would say if you want the eggs fully cooked dip and remove the bread very quickly. I also added some ground cinnamon to the white dipping sugar.

This recipe sounded like it would be so yummy, but I'm sorry to say it was not to our liking.  The only change I made was to add cinnamon to the sugar.  I used English muffins as suggested, but they were too soggy and hard to keep from falling apart.  I really wish we could have enjoyed it.  Thanks Laura Owen for sharing your recipe!

I made this recipe with cinnamon raisin bagels which I sliced into thirds.  I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of vanilla as well as a few sprinkles of allspice.  Instead of dipping the bread into the sugar, I sprinkled it on.  It proved less messy and I did not waste as much sugar.  It was a good recipe but I'll probably try another recipe next time.

Fantastic. I never thought about using english muffins instead of regular bread. This was a great idea. It's Christmas morning but now snow. I'm enjoying my english muffin french toast and a lovely mimosa!

This sounded like it would be awesome and it wasn't. Fast, very easy to fix, very different from everyday French Toast. I cut this in half and still ended up with enough egg/milk to make 6 pieces of bread. I thought the ratio was off and I like an eggier dip and the bread was soggy and I had to cook a lot longer to get it firm enough to even turn over. I do think a thicker sliced bread though than the raisin bread I used would be preferrable.  No need for syrup as this is very sweet already and the sugar carmelizes on the outside. Don't try to stack these on a serving plate and then try to serve as they stick together and they especially stick to your plate when you are eating them and I wasn't too happy about the cleanup of carmelized sugar on my dishes. This did take a lot more butter and sugar than it says. More desserty though than breakfasty and will definitely give your kids a sugar high especially if you add the maple syrup!

I wanted a different twist on making french toast this morning. I was so excited when I found this recipe but very disappointed in the results. As a previous reviewer said, it was very sweet and sticky. Maybe that's the reason english muffins are used.
