I have used this recipe for years.  It's great to have the frozen treat held in the freezer for stop-in buddies. . .especially during the summer months.  I substitute black cherry brandy with herbal black cherry/berries tea with red food coloring added.

If you are not a apricot brandy fan this stuff is awesome if you replace the brandy w/desired amt of vodka. If you don't have time to wait on the tea bags, instant can be used. Best if made the night before so it can fully chill/freeze.

I have been looking for this exact recipe for a few years- we always had this at Christmas growing up and unfortunately, the recipe died with my mom.  It is the exact right combination of ingredients.  Also, I just use regular brandy (I have never actually tried it with apricot) and it is delicious.  Thank you!

The ginger ale/lemon lime soda/iced tea that is listed in the description never made it into the ingredient list. On that note, a glass full of just the slush was entirely too tart and not enjoyable. After coming back and reading over it again, I saw the part about only adding a few scoops to the glass and then filling it with ginger ale. The ginger ale made all the different in the world to the overall flavor. Need to add the ginger ale/lemon lime soda  to the ingredient list!

My only issue is it states ready in 15 minutes, then it says freeze for several hours :(  I tried putting in blender with ice, but didn't have enough ice for "slush".  Flavor was great!
