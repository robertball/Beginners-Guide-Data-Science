I used Kate's Light n' Fluffy Buttermilk and Chocolate Chip Waffle recipe from this site, instead of frozen. First time I busted out my waffle maker in a LONG time. Kids were thrilled. Throw a dippable ANYTHING in front of my kids, I'm the best mom ever. Rock on.

DELICIOUS!  My kids -- 7 and 2 loved it.  With the peanut butter in it, it is more healthier than maple syrup alone.  This is a keeper.
