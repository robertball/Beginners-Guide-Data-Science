Strange mix of flavours that somehow blend well together. I doubled the sauce because I cooked it in a tagine in the oven with vermicelli rice noodles and vegetables so I needed some extra sauce. If you like spicy food, add some fresh hot peppers, they won't ruin the dish. The chicken comes out tender and juicy, and full of flavour. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this twice and it's absolutely delicious! The key is making sure the chicken marinates for at least an hour. The flavors blend so well together! I added a tsp of powered ginger and served over a bed of riced cauliflower.
