This is delicious and refreshing.  If you're new to green monster smoothies, it's an experience, but if you're familiar with them you'll love it! Reminds you of a healthy version of a Girl Scout cookie.

Yummy! I omitted the mint extract and added more mint - it was still minty.

Amazing!!! I used almond milk instead of coconut as it's all I had, and mini chocolate chips instead of cacao, still delicious. After my first try I've been adding a lot more spinach, maybe three fistfuls. I would also add a caveat about the amount of mint extract--I used Adam's brand, which is apparently more concentrated than others, I ended up having to double the recipe to cut the extreme mint (no hardship there, just a headsup to start small and add more extract if needed)

Made as is and it really did taste like Thin Mints. Next time I would like to decrease the peppermint extract and also use peppermint herb not spearmint.

Delish! I swapped coconut water for the coconut milk, fresh collard greens for the spinach, dark cocoa powder for the cacao seeds, 2 teaspoons sugar for the stevia, and added 10-15 extra mint leaves and left out the extract. I also just chilled the banana while preparing the other ingredients and tossed in a couple ice cubes because I was in a hurry. My sister added 2% milk to hers to dilute it. We both loved it. You can't taste the collard greens, but I think the bitterness of fresh greens subtly enhances the chocolate taste. Will be making this again!

Very good. I used low-sugar cacao powder instead of cacao seeds.

Nice and refreshing but I had to go out of my way to get a lot of the stuff to make it.

Except for subbing regular milk for the coconut milk, I made the recipe as listed but the mint was too overpowering. I tried fixing it by adding more water and spinach and then by adding a scoop of chocolate protein powder. It was still too strong.  I'll try it again, but I'll sub fresh mint for the mint extract, or only put a very tiny amount of extract in.
UPDATE (7/16/214): I made this again, only this time I doubled the use of fresh mint and didn't use any mint extract at all. It was much better this time, so I increased my initial rating. Still, as I wouldn't make the recipe as listed again, I am rating this as a 3 (my modified version was more like a 4, but the original version was a 1).
