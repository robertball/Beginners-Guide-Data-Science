Yay, I get to be the first again to rate another one of Chef John's masterpieces. This was outstanding!! I quadrupled this partly because we had company and the other part is we all love pasta! This was so very easy to make and using the bacon really made it stand out. I never would have thought about putting bacon in this sauce but it really adds a richness that I have never had in a vodka sauce. I made a dandelion green salad and had some garlic bread. It was so tasty and everyone was eating and so quiet that you could here a penne drop, lol!! Thanks again, Chef John :)

My husband is out of town for a couple of days so I cut this recipe in half with the plans of having it tonight and tomorrow night...all I can say is I cannot wait until tomorrow night to have it again.  I made it using Chef John's "tomato sauce", which is also on this site ----which is amazing in and of itself.  The only changes I made were dried rosemary and half and half versus fresh and heavy cream.  It is restaurant quality if not better.

I made this recipe last night for me and my hubby - relatively simple recipe yet full of flavor.  I used about half a teaspoon of dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh on hand.  Also, we like things on the spicier side so I added a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes in to the 1/2 cup of vodka about an hour before I used it in the recipe.  Another Chef John keeper!

I would give this five stars if it contained the changes I made (which aren't for everybody).  I added a teaspoon of crushed chili pepper, a thinly sliced jalapeno, used red wine instead of water, and cottage cheese instead of cream (it melted and made the sauce nice and cheesy). I know, no longer authentic but it really turned out well! I was pleasantly surprised how little time it took to reduce the vodka, and how rich it tasted before adding the sauce.  I think the vodka/rosemary/olive oil/bacon combo would make a nice shrimp scampi sauce.

I was surprised by how easy this recipe was. That being said, I would not use a prepared marinara sauce again, as it gave the sauce a canned taste, almost like spaghetti-o's. I added a bit more cream than the recipe called for and didn't use the panchetta (veg). Would make again with a few subs.

Haven't made it yet but giving it a 4 just because no salt was added  or garlic. For those of you that make a recipe. And don't taste  your end product to see if you need salt, garlic etc.  that is your fault. The only other thing is you can catch the vodka on fire and it will give it a different flavor all together. But I am sure John  didn't want you to catch your house on fire if you don't even know to taste your food throughout preparing it.  Plus beware of using cheap vodka. Cook your paste to your liking not to someone else's liking.  And who ever mentioned beef. You are lost. No beef, it's pork like from a pig.  Apparently you don't know the difference between a cow or hog(pig)

Awseome!  Loved this with the penne which didn't make it past day 2 in the house.  Yesterday, was out of pasta and didn't feel like shopping, but had everything else and some chicken breasts.  Well, cubed and browned the chicken, set that aside, made the sauce, and added the cubed chicken at the simmer phase.  Yummy x 2!

This recipe is phenomenal.  Made it exactly as written and it was delicious.  The bacon and the Rosemary infuse so much flavor into the sauce.  Will be making this again for sure.

Made it as suggested and added sautéed shallots. Yes you need to add the water as it becomes very thick. Family liked it very much but requested more vodka next time. Excellent recipe and very easy.

Hubby had a vodka sauce dish while on a business trip, he asked me to make it. He said this was much better than the restaurant version he had at a high end Italian restaurant. I served it with ravioli and used my own marina from my freezer instead of a jar. Delish!!

Based on reviews, I really want to make this.  My only concern, is adding relatively so much water to the sauce.  I mean, water brings no flavor and the amount in the recipe of 3/4 cup makes me think the sauce will be well...too watery and thin.  Of those who have made this exactly as the recipe states, what were your experiences with flavor and consistency of sauce?

Absolutely delicious and restaurant quality! I made exactly as written, scaled down to a smaller portion. Is it possible to give Chef John less than five stars?

This is a very good recipe - sauce is authentic and delicious. As the recipe says, use caution when adding the vodka. I made a double batch and the vodka flames up nearly 3’ and burned for a while!

Made it with Rao's Marinara sauce - amazing! I'm sure the calories were sky-high.

If anything, I would go easier on the pancetta/rosemary. But very good sauce!

As described an easy simple make with great  flavor would make again but maybe add a 1/4 cup more of Vodka and be sure to use Pancetta and not regular smoked bacon.

This is my first Chef John recipe that I didn’t give 5 stars. While we thought it was very, very good, it fell a bit short of my expectations. I will make it again, though, everyone at the dinner table emptied their bowls. So maybe 4.5 stars would be a good rating.

Outstanding recipe.......
A few minor tweaks:.......
Subbed chopped shallots for pancetta sauteed in 1/4 cup olive oil for meatless  version....
Add cheese, 2 T butter, chopped parsley to tomato sauce off heat.....
Undercook Penne until barely al dente.....
Combine all, cover and let sit in warm oven for 15-20 minutes to absorb flavors and finish cooking.

I've tried vodka sauces from restaurants and never cared for it much. But I thought I'd try again at home with a good quality vodka that needed to be used up. I was impressed. I'll admit I use this site mainly just to get ideas and have only tried and rated recipes that were made according to directions. But I do also enjoy reading the reviews from people that alter and then complain, or haven't made and then complain, or that seem only to be here to belittle everyone else. Rather childish. Happy cooking!
