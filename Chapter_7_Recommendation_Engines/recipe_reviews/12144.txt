The recipe makes a terrific, easy
lemon meringue, which was a big hit.
The directions on the meringue should
include the addition of vanilla in the
final beating process (inadvertently
omitted in the directions), and I recommend
increasing the amount of meringue on the
pie, since the amount in the recipe does
not make a very high meringue top.  I used
low-fat sweetened condensed milk, and it
turned out fine, with no impact on the
consistency of the pie.  It has great
flavor and consistency.

Easy recipe that becomes great with some changes. 
-additional egg for the meringue
-1/2cup of sugar to the meringue
-fresh lemon juice, a full 3/4 cup.
-1/4 cup of sugar to the lemon juice.
A regular pie crust works great with this recipe, and be sure to cook the pie until set, and then add the meringue! It took abou 15 minutes to brown the merginue, be sure to watch it though!

This is the recipe my Great-grandmother used and the only one my family likes.  It is sweet, smooth and creamy with a delicious lemon flavor.  The recipe is so easy and turns out great every time.

I must admit that part of the reason that this came out so badly was because I had never attempted a lemon meringue pie before & did not really know what to expect in preperation. Still, these directions were terrible & the only way to make this pie taste better would be to set it on fire & go buy a good one instead. I shudder every time I remember the taste of it.

Almost Momma's recipe.  Except she used 3 eggs (yolk and white) and 1 Tbsp of sugar per egg white for meringue.  She also added in lemon zest with the lemon juice.  Be sure to completely seal pie with meringue, leaving no holes.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  I only use 2 egg whites for the meringue and add 1/4 cup sugar to it.  I also use a little less lemon juice.

Followed according to recipe.  Thought it was good but would be great (for me) if it were a tad bit more tart.  Also could use more merinque on top.

Very simple, good alternative to the 'traditional' lemon filling- they were fighting over second helpings! (added an extra egg white into meringue)

We really liked this pie.  It was easy to make, which is required for my baking.

We followed a couple of the suggestions.  1) Bake in stages (crust for 10 min (we used regular crust, not graham), filling for 10 min, meringue for 10 min).  2) We used 4 egg whites for meringue.

Simple to prepare and pretty to look at. Increased the amount of lemon juice and sugar. Very refreshing. Topped with a slice of lemon for decoration.

Tastes great, but WHY didn't the recipe say to BAKE THE FILLING FIRST? Ended up with a tasty, runny pie, guess I learned I am an amateur at meringue pies!

This pie is great. Thanks Christine. Just a reminder, to help get a great meringue make sure there are no traces of oil or grease on your mixing bowl or beaters and no egg yolk in your whites.

I have used this recipe for years & it is great. When I make it, my husband tells me to make 2. One for the family & one for him. I usually double the meringue tho, I like it thicker. It's a crowd pleaser!

Nice lemony flavor and very easy pie to make. But it was very, very sweet, for us. Also, if I make again, I will go along with the advice of some of the reviews and use another egg or two for a thicker/higher meringue topping.

I'm not sure what I did wrong - I followed the recipe to the letter but the lemon layer never "set."  It was completely runny.  Other recipes call for cornstarch or flour, but since this one didn't, I thought it would be fine.  My meringue was perfect & overall, the taste was spot-on, but I'm terribly disappointed in the overall result.

This was excellent!!!  I too doubled the amound of meringue, and put this in a 9-inch pie crust instead of graham cracker (my Dad's preference, since I made it for Father's Day).  Everyone loved it and couldn't believe how easy it was to make!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is by far the best recipe for Lemon Meringue Pie.  I have also used this filling to fill the mini-fillo tart shells that you can by in the frozen food section.  Just bake in the oven after they are filled for about 15 minutes...chill......then add a dollop of redi-whip right before they are served.  Rave reviews every time....everyone thinks you've really slaved at making these tasty pretty tarts!!!

Easy & delicious!  I made this pie for my 8 year old son who LOVES lemon meringue pie.  The only alteration I made was to add a little more sugar to the meringue.  It seemed to help stiffen it up better.

This is a great pie.  It's easy, delicious, and uses items that most cooks keep on hand.  I doubled the filling and used it for 1 9-inch pie and 4 mini pies.  I overbeat the meringue, but that was my fault.  So it wasn't all fluffy and nice like a meringue should be, but it still tasted good.  The filling was cool, creamy, tart and sweet.  I used Graham Cracker Crust II for this.  I like how you get the taste of a lemon meringue pie without the work!

My husband didn't care for it, he said the meringue was eggy.  Go figure.  I got compliments from everyone else that tried it.  One weird thing though, the recipe calls for vanilla but no where in the directions does it tell you to use the vanilla.
