I used uncooked shrimp.  I used potato starch instead of flour and chilled shrimp prior to dredging them...worked very well.  400 for 8 minutes, remove/turn, and 6 minutes more.  Results were quite good.

This certainly had a kick.  It was a little hotter than I like, but  heat lovers  will love this.  The cooking time was a little less than the recipe called for for my machine.

Excellent!  Just got a hot air fryer and this was one of the first recipes I tried.  We will have this again.

My BF absolutely loved these! I didn't have siracha so sub whatever hot sauce was in the pantry. I did add a tad bit more chili sauce and hot sauce to the mayo just because I wanted to kill the flavor of the mayo (not a fan).  I cooked for less time...but ovens are different. Trying to make a meal out of it, I sautéed vegetables (leeks, yellow squash, zuchinni, shrooms, bell...fridge raid)  and added some of the sauce to the skillet with the addition of water, tamari, garlic and ginger to make a juicer sauce for the veggies while keeping the original flavor. I served a bed of fried rice with the tasty sauced veggies and shrimps on top! With the extra sauce on the side for dipping! You know it's good when he is still snacking while on dish duty! Thank you so much for sharing!

I followed the recipe with these two exceptions: 1. I cooked at 390 instead of 400, because that's as high as my  air fryer would go, 2. I used more panko because it stuck well and I was running out.. I used raw 16-20 jumbo shrimp that I have never had a failure with in the past. I cooked for 12 minutes. The shrimp looked good as far as browning goes. But they were dry, dry, dry, and heading towards disasterously overcooked, even at 390. The breading was crispy, but dry too on the surface, and a little doughy underneath. Finally, I thought whatever flavor the shrimp had left was stolen by the bam bam sauce. It was an injustice to some nice shrimp. Full disclaimer: this was only my third time with the air fryer. Maybe I'm not so keen on air frying. We shall see.

This was very tasty BUT, my air fryer could cook only 8 pieces at a time, and cooked them in 8 minutes, not 12. I had to cook a number of batches, and put them into a low oven, 200  degrees, to stay warm. Some got overcooked  and tough. The sauce was good, but I had to make more, and did have to dilute it with water. It did not stick very well to the floured shrimp. It took more pano than the recipe said; luckily I had plenty. The taste was delicious, but the difficult preparation lowered my rating.

These were delicious and crispy. The sauce was too thick, so I thinned it with a little water, maybe a tablespoon, and I had to use more panko than called for. I don’t know what sweet chili sauce is, there was nothing by that name in the Asian section of my grocery store, so I used chili sauce which is similar to ketchup and found near the ketchup. I’m new to the air fryer and wondered if I’d have to turn the shrimp halfway through cooking, but it’s not necessary, and I found the time suggested was perfect. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!
