This was the best creation I have ever made, right after my children. SUPER easy, WAY TOO delicious and haven't stopped crying since it's been gone. I'm making more today, but I will be making a double batch. (I use Irish Kerygold butter and only organic, all natural syrup. Of course I toasted the pecans too.) Don't say I didn't warn you.

Eagle Brand just came out with caramel sweetened condensed milk.  I made this using it and it was incredible.  You must use heavy cream, anything with less fat will NOT beat well.

Simply put, this is the best ice cream I have ever tasted. I have tried all sorts of recipes, but always come back to this one. I like doubling the toasted pecans and adding heath or homemade butter-cookie dough chunks.  Perfection.
