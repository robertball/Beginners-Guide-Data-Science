Holy moly this was good! Needed to find a way to use the fresh figs I had picked at my best friend's house. The combination was wonderful. I didn't use the food processor to grind up the figs and pine nuts, just cause I didn't have one available to me...but I think that it gave it a great textural element. Next time I might toast the nuts prior to combining them with the figs. Thank you Laura for sharing this recipe; this was a great way to end our Italian feast.

Absolutely delicious. Next time, though, I'll cut the alcohol by a lot. It was way more than needed and I felt like I was just wasting good wine.

I used nectarines instead of peaches. I liked the baked nectarines in the alcohol, but not the topping. If I make it again, I will reduce the amount of nuts and add a little honey to the topping. Also, based on DILLORDONEZ's review, I cut the alcohol in half, and it was still too much, so I'd cut it down even more.

Really flavorful, but we topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (husband) and/or a spoonful of greek yogurt (me).  Perfect.  Next time I dont think I will process the pine nuts and figs in the food processor, though.  Needs a little contrasting texture and crunch.

9.1.18  My figs were very ripe, and I was concerned that if I put them in the blender, they’d turn to mush, so I chopped them as well as the pine nuts.  Honestly, I did use the ingredients in the recipe, but I didn’t measure, just eyeballed everything.  Definitely would roast the pine nuts in the future, but the nut-fig filling on the nectarines (yes, I used nectarines, not peaches) was very good. Super simple to make with nice presentation, actually a little elegant in its simplicity.
