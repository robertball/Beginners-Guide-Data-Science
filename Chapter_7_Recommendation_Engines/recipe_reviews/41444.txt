With a few modifications based on other reviewers suggestions, this recipe was one of the best I have made from Allrecipes (and I've been a member for over four years). I seasoned the roast generously with Spike and garlic pepper before searing, and also placed the sweet potatoes on top of the roast instead of underneath (the onions and garlic were kept on the bottom of the crock, though). I made slits and shoved in some garlic cloves, crocked it for 8 hours on low, and it was absolutely perfect:  a handsome, falling apart, no-knife needed roast. The sweet pototoes also came out the right consistency. This will be one of my new favorites.

This was a very good recipe!  I only used 3 cloves of garlic and it was still very flavorful. I put in two onions instead of one.

The meat was very tender.  The sweet potatoes
were very tender, NOT mushy and tasted wonderful.

I had leftovers and when reheated in the saved broth in a saucepan was just as good as the first day it was made. I put the leftover meat in a low oven wraped in foil for a short time and it was still mosit and tender.  My husband loved this and said he definitely wants this as a "make again" recipe.  One hint,  if you open the lid even just one time before the minimum cooking time, you loose 1 to 1/2 hrs. of cooking time, which means you have to add that additional loss of time to your expected time done.

I had to try this because I couldn't imagine sweet potatoes with onions and garlic.  I trimmed all the fat off the roast and seasoned it with seasoned salt and garlic pepper prior to searing. I sliced one clove of garlic and placed the slivers in slits cut in the roast.  Since I knew I would be gone for 9 hours instead of 6, I cut the sweet potatoes into large chunks and put them on top of the roast (I used 2 large onions and the garlic to line the crock pot).  The potatoes were slighty soft, but not mushy.  The flavor of the whole dish was superb.  My mom and husband both agreed that this was a keeper!

oh my, what a great recipe!!  i didn't change a thing and it came out perfect.  my parents came to visit, and they could not believe how wonderful it was.  9/25/08...  The posting above was made a few years ago, and I've made this several times since, but I thought I'd change it up a little this time.  I've always added more garlic than called for, but this last time I seared the pork roast as I usually do, then I added about a 1/2 can of chicken broth to the drippings, let it come to a simmer to loosen up the bits stuck to the pan, then poured it into the crockpot along with the rest of the broth...that small step took this recipe to another level!!  This is really the only way I cook pork roast.  Thank you so much for this posting.

I used this recipe as a base to get the final results I was looking for.  My pork turned out excellent, extremely tender and not the least bit dry.  I left out the sweet potatoes because I just wanted plain mashed potatoes that I could pour gravy over.  I seared the pork with my seasonings of choice, garlic, Fiesta Fajita seasoning, and salt-free Cavender's Greek Seasoning.  I saved the 'drippings' from the searing to make my gravy rue then added the broth from the cooked roast to finish it up.  I cooked the roast on two onions cut in half for 5 1/2 hours and just cut the cooker off to let it 'rest' for the last 30 minutes while I was finishing up the remainder of the meal.  I haven't eaten until I was 'stuffed' in a long time, but I certainly did last night and so did my husband!

We really enjoyed this recipe. We added carrots, extra salt and pepper and used white table potatoes. Which turned excellent. Thanks

I omitted the sweet potatoes.  You have to make sure you sear the pork good.  After searing it I cut four slits in the top and put in the slivers of garlic into the pork roast (mine had the bones), then I took 1 TB crushed peppercorns, 1 tea of oregano, 1 tea cumin (not seeds), 1/2 tea of ground cloves, 1.5 tea of cinnamon.  Take a hot sauce pan and heat up your spices a bit (do not burn) this should be about 2 min or so and then rub onto the roast.  Then I added the rest in the recipe.  I cooked it at 4 hours high (starting at 7:30am) then at lunch I put it at 6 hours high.  Them meat fell right off the bone!  It was so tender and flavorful I shredded it up and heated up some corn tortillas (Milagro are the best tortillas) salsa and cheese.  Very good!  The spices are what I use when making empanada meat.

This was a very tender roast.  I used a 3 lb. boneless sirloin, tied.  I seared it in olive oil after I rubbed it with rosemary and Mrs. Dash Garlic & herb.  I didn't have sweet taters, so I just used russets.  After it was done, I poured the broth into a saucepan and thickened it with cornstarch to make gravy.  Yummmmmy!!

This recipe is incredible! I started it in the morning and by the time my husband came home the roast was falling apart. The combination of the sweet potatoes, garlic and the pork all complement each other very well!

This was very good, especially considering how easy it was to make.  I was sure to season the roast well with garlic powder, dried chopped rosemary, seasoned salt and pepper before I seared it (sear it well too, as this locks in all the juices).  I served it with honey glazed carrots and made extra honey/brown sugar/butter glaze to serve on the sweet potatoes.  A delicious meal that was something other than chicken, plus my husband said he'd like to have it again which is the true test!  Thanks for a great recipe Brandy!

This was, great! Minimal work and we came home to a great supper. But since I decided to make this about 10 minutes before walking out the door, I had to make due with what i had on hand. I used two small roasts, salt & peppered and seared really well, about a 1/2 a cup of campbell's chicken broth, and 1 Knorr's chicken bouillon cube mixed with 1 cup hot water, had no onions so I used about a 1/8 cup of dehydrated onion, and used about 5-6 cloves of garlic, also, had no sweet potatoes on hand so on the way home I picked some red potatoes up and just served as mashed. *grin* we also don't own a slow cooker and I just tossed it in the oven in my roaster, covered with foil & lid and turned oven on to 250 F and let it cook all day (8 hours). It was soooo moist & full of flavour!! Thank you Brandy!

This recipe gave an absolutely perfectly textured pork roast -- firm but tender, perfect for sandwhich slicing. (We start all our roasts from frozen). Started everything at once with the onions on the bottom, then the roast, then the sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were also slightly firm, not mooshy. I loved it!!!!

This was great!  We followed the recipe exactly, and I loved the mix of the soft sweet potatoes with the pork -- delicious!!  Tastes good over rice, or just on its own.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add some more onions -- one just didn't seem like enough.  Thanks!

This was a great meal.  I took previous reviewers' advice and sliced garlic thin, inserting directly into the meat.  I also added a tablespoon of quick cooking tapioca prior to cooking, this helped make a nice thick broth for spooning over meat and potatoes.  Previous review complaining of dry meat either didn't have a good cut of meat or didn't brown the meat well enough before placing in the slow cooker.  Thanks!

Made as per recipe except I put the sweet potatoes on top as I would have to leave it for 9 hours, and only added about a cup of stock.  Meat was tender, maybe a bit dry.  What made this is that I took the juice from the crockpot and pureed it with a hand blender.  Then I put it in a saucepan, added cornstarch and water and maybe a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and cooked it for a bit.  My little sauce really made this dish and I would definately make it again with this sauce.

The finished recipe was really bland.  When making the recipe, I hoped it would taste good, because it was really easy.  Oh well.  The sweet potatoes turn to mush and the combinations of ingredients do not really mix well together.  Not to mention, the pork was extremely dry.  Even worse leftover!

I was looking for a quick roast recipe and this is a great one!!  I did make a few changes.  I did not have potatoes so I used sliced carrots instead.  I also did not have a can of chicken broth so I added 2 cups hot water to pan drippings after removing pork, added 2 boulion cubes, stired till dissolved then poured over pork in slow cooker.  I placed 4 of the 6 garlic cloves in the cooker, made 2 deep slits(2in. each)in the meat and stuffed them with the remaing 2 garlic cloves.   It was so moist and yummy.  We just couldn't get enough!!

I followed that other readers advice with the additional spices and it was GREAT! My guests loved it. The searing is very very important to do well (you need to only learn that lesson once). I will use this one again!

This was a tasty and easy pot roast.  The garlic did not overwhelm the flavor of the roast or the veggies.  When it was time to serve the roast was so tender it was just falling apart.

great recipe!   I cooked mine in the oven for about 2- 2 and 1/2 hours.   Only thing I did different was to put both black and cayenne pepper on the loin before browning.

This was very bland and the sweet potatoes soak up the chicken broth flavors and leave them tasting strange.  There is just chicken broth left in the bottom which isn't gravy or sauce.... just broth.  Nothing you'd want to pour over your meat.

the pork roast turned out perfect! I'm not a fan of the sweet potatoes cooked in garlic and onion, since I like them to remain sweet... but they weren't terrible. I'll make this again but next time I'll try using red potatoes.

This is a quick and easy recipe!! Came out wonderful! My husband liked it and he is a PICKY eater!! I also made a few modifications.  I used canola oil to brown it.  I shoved cloves of garlic in it for more flavor, and used regular potatoes instead of sweet (hubby and I don't like them LOL).  I also used beef broth (I didn't have chicken). Came out tasty and meat was tender! I will DEFINATELY make this again and maybe add some carrots and try the chicken broth.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

~Ina :)

This was very tasty.  I made it without the sweet potatoes (didn't have any).  Followed another reviewers suggestions... seared pork roast with my preferred seasonings, cut some thick onion slices and put those at the bottom of the crock pot, added whole garlic cloves and put the pork on top of the onions, then added the chicken broth.  I had nearly a 4 lb roast and cooked it for about 9 hours.  I then used the broth in the crockpot to make pork gravy.  Turned out delicious.  Served w/ mashed potatoes and salad.

Very good,  my husband loved it! I omitted the sweet potato's, made mashed instead. I sprinkled garlic powder on the roast before browning it and then added 6 whole cloves of garlic to the crock pot. When it was done I removed the roast and added little more salt & pepper & corn starch to thicken the juice, while this was thicking I sliced the roast and then put it in the gravy. We had enough gravy for the mashed potato's also.

Used another reviewer's suggestion and rubbed with Old Bay seasoning.  It still was a bit plain for me, but I did like it.  I used a bone in pork roast and had to massacre the roast, bone and all, to make it fit.  I didn't use sweet potatoes--just used a regular baking potato.  Bf decided we are making bbq'd pork out of the leftovers, and he liked it as is just fine.

MMMMM! That's all my kids said when they were eating this. The pork turned out so good. I followed some of the suggestions and seasoned the pork with some of my favorite mixed seasoning and seared it before putting it in the slow cooker. I think the pork deserved 5 star but the sweet potatoes only 4 star. Next time I will try something different with the sweet potatoes, maybe wraping them in foil to cook along side the pork or use red potaoes instead.

The pork was excellent very tender and juicy. I will make this will white potatoes next time.  Onions and garlic don't mix well with the sweet potatoes.

This was really good, but as said the sweet potato is very mushy, which is okay if you want mashed potato. I think next time I will put the sweet potato in half way thru. I also used lots of rosemary & fresh garlic.
Will make again ;-)

the pork came out great but the sweet potatoes were very mushy and not so sweet as I thought they would be. I will certainly make this again but maybe use carrots or other vegetables instead of the potatoes.

My cooker doesn't have a 'low' setting, it has numbers so I used the same setting I use for slow cooked pot roast.
I checked it after about 3 hours and by touch appeared to be done but not falling apart tender as others described it, I was concerned it might become really dry but I threw caution to the wind and let it cook for the full 6 hours.
It was juicy, and falling apart tender. Absolutely succulent!

This was alright. Dry as a bone, not too flavorful or delicious.  More veggies needed.  I had to put about a pound of salt on every bite.

OMG!!! So good! Mike had never had sweet potatoes that didn't have brown sugar, (he did not like sweet potatoes because of that)...after this dinner he loves them!  I was scared to do it. I couldn't imagine sweet potatoes cooked with a roast.  SO GOOD!! And in the crock pot no less, so easy!  I went about our busy day and that evening we ate like I had been in the kitchen all day.  AWESOME, a MUST try. I only needed this recipe for two, but followed it completely (for two).

I have searched in vain for a slow cooker recipe with a roast that turns out tasty.  This was no exception.  They all have that steamed meat flavor.  I made this tonight, I added a few more spices and vegetables as I was hoping to enhance the flavor.  We ate it, but I tossed out most of it.  I don't know if there are others out there who think that all slow cooker recipes taste the same but if there are take heed and note this does not do a pork roast justice.  I will be deleting this one from my recipe box.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, and the end result was a little bland for our tastes.  Hubby ate it after dousing it with pepper, but after one bite, the kids wouldn't touch it.  Still searching for a good, basic, crock pot pork roast.

I changed the recipe by adding russet potatoes instead of the sweet, and the pork turned out VERY dry.  So I cannot honestly rate the recipe since I tweeked it. I don't think ppl should rate the recipe 5 stars if they had to change it.  I rated the recipe according the taste of the roast  - too darn dry.

I seasoned browned meat with 1/4 tsp of Jamaican Jerk seasoning and garlic powder (used strips instead of roast) and then, after cooking meat, onions, and sweet potatoes for about 5 1/2 hours, I added 1 drained can of vegetarian black beans and cooked an additional 1 hour on low. Served over brown rice.

This was a really tasty recipe but I think it was cooked to long, next time I will cut back on cooking time. My family didn't really like the sweet potatoes so I will use white ones next time. Te flavor was great overall.

I thought it was very good and very tender.  The meat was a little dry however so save some of the juice from the crock pot to spoon over the meat.  With the leftover meat, I pulled the pork apart and put BBQ sauce on it over night.  The next evening I made pulled pork BBQ sandwiches on a bun.  My kids loved it and asked for 2nd sandwiches.

It's good. Nice tender meat and potatoes were perfect softness.  I would jazz up the spices a bit next time, possibly put the garlic cloves directly into the meat.

This was a very easy way to make a yummy pork roast.  It came out moist and we liked that.  It also is a great recipe if you want "comfort food" and do not want to heat up the house with the oven.

We bought two very small pork roasts that were on sale. I never cooked a pork roast only a beef roast. After searching this sites many recipes, I decided to give this recipe a try. I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, so I chose to use white potatoes. The pork roast was so tender that you didn't even need a knife. The potatoes were also cooked to perfection. Everyone loved the pork roast. This recipe will be added to my favorites. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe.

I made recipe as written with the exception of seasoning the roast with salt, pepper & rosemary before searing.  I seared every side of the roast and put all in crock pot as directed.  It turned out very flavorful, the roast was nice and moist, and the sweet potatoes were done but not mushy.  I cooked the whole 6 hours.  I love sweet potatoes, but in a savory way, not sweet with brown sugar, cinnamon, etc., and cooked this way they were a very nice compliment to the pork.  I also removed meat and vegetables and added some cornstarch to make a nice gravy which was delicious over the meat and the potatoes.  After searing the roast, I did deglaze the pan with a little chicken broth and added that in to the crockpot.  Wonderful recipe, will definitely make again!

This was great,  It took no time at all to prepare and smelled great while cooking,   I tossed in a few mushrooms halfway through cooking and served this with a kale salad.   Thank you.

I love this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  I followed the recipe and followed the suggestions from some of the other reviewers.  I placed the garlic and onions on the bottom, placed some garlic inside slits of the pork loin, and added the sweet potatoes last in the slow cooker on top and around the sides of the loin.  

My meat was not dry and adding the juice from the slow cooker over the top just added more flavor. I had friends over and I was hoping to have left overs, but there were none.

Absolutely delicious! I would recommend cutting slits in the pork as the middle could get dry. Next time, I will add potatoes to it!

It was ok I spiked, garlicked and seared but my roast was flavorless maybe I added too much liquid=I didn't have canned broth so I used 2 chicken boullouin (sp) cubes and mixed with 2 cups of water mixed in  the skillet I seared the roast in. The meat was uber tender and the potatos and carrots were perfect just no flavor pork wish I knew what I was doing wrong

Delicious!! Such a simple and easy recipe!  The pork was so moist and tender!  Only change I made was added carrots and an extra can of broth, my crockpot is deep and narrow so I needed more to cover the pork.  Definitely worth trying!

Was very good set in slow cooker before work and came home to meal ready to eat. I also added some bay leaves. The sweet potatoes were perfect tenderness yet not mushy and the pork was fall apart tender.

I love this recipe. I make it with red potatoes too.  My kids and husband gobble it up.  I do pierce the roast and put slices of garlic in it also.  This is a staple in or house now.

Sorry, but this one just didn't turn out well at all for me...to the point that I threw 1/2 the roast away.  I like all the pieces, but I did not like the outcome. Cooking in a slow cooker naturally makes food a little more bland and every bite tasting the same thana regular oven -- I know & recognize that, but the taste that was there ... I really did not like it at all.   Seems like lots of people did though, so you might try it...maybe it's just me (or my slow cooker).

I love all the ingredients here, but it was lacking flavor. The meat sets on top of the veggies so it doesn't get any liquid or flavor (not that the potatoes had any extra flavor either). I cooked it just as suggested. It was edible, but not worth cooking as written. Needs some pizzaz!

This recipe was not to my liking.  It was well cooked but that is about all I can say.  Tasted REALLY bland.  Unlike a lot of reviewers I always follow the recipe exactly before I rate it so I can give an honest rating on the actual recipe as written.  My opinion: SKIP IT!

Delicious! I was a bit worried about the sweet potatoes, because we aren't big fans, but I thought it complimented the pork extremely well. The pork itself so so moist and tender. My potatoes were very mushy, so next time I make this I will add them later on rather than at the beginning. I made a gravy with the stock, and while it was delicious, you really don't need gravy with this meal. We can't wait to have this again.

This was falling apart, it was so tender.  The sweet potatoes were like mush, even after following suggestion to place on top of roast.  In addition, if you are going to make a gravy from some of the "juices", you may have to doctor it up a lot to get rid of that sweet potato flavor.  I love sweet potatoes but will surely leave them out next time.

This was good.  I used regular potatoes since that's what I had in the pantry.  I followed the advise of others and seasoned the pork wiht Old Bay seasoning and added extra garlic.  I probably could have used a little more seasoning but I would rather under-season than over-season.  Hubby said he'd like to try this again with some additional seasoning.

I think it needed a little longer to marinate. I just didn't seem to "soak up" the flavors. It still turned out tender and delicious, though.

This recipe was really good. I'm not a sweet potato fan, so I just used regular potatoes. Beyond that, this seems like a recipe you can really adjust to make something a little different every time you make it.

I love anything made in the crockpot, and you can't beat how easy this recipe is. That being said, I just wasn't wowed by flavor. I even tried adding the garlic salt, basil, and bay leaves, and carrots, suggested by other reviewers, but still didn't feel it was a fantastic recipe. Just okay.

An easy tasteful Sunday dinner.  The pork would have been a little bland had I not took the advice of some other reviewers and seasoned it.  I used garlic powder, dry basil and a couple of bay leaves.  Otherwise, followed the recipe according to directions.  Meat was tender and moist and the veggies done just right.  I dropped a few baby carrots in with mine.  Made cooking a meal a snap.  I will probably use this recipe again and try some different seasonings until I get it just right.  I strained the "juice" left at the bottom of the crock and refrigerated it overnight to skim the fat off in the morning.  Used it as a base for gravy for hot pork sandwiches, as hubby doesn't care for gravy on potatoes.  Worked fine.

Amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was adding more of my favorite veggies like carrots, small red potatoes, and mushrooms. Everything turned out incredibly moist and tender! It was perfect, and I'll definitely make this again and again!

This was a pretty good base recipe. I wish I would have read the reviews before I made it and seasoned it a little more like everyone suggested. However, I think because it was so mildly flavored my kids loved it; telling me it was the best "chicky" ever!:)

The pork was great (used a tenderloin) but you have to really like sweet potatoes because no flavor other than that - I even used extra garlic & garlic chicken consume.

Roast turned out great but have to agree with other reviews, sweet potatoes and garlic are not a good match, will use white potatoes next time.

This recipe worked out really well. To spice it up a bit, add some Mojo to your taste and the flavor will be perfect. Was a little bland before adding the Mojo.

This was a really good, easy recipe. I made a couple of boo boos though, I put in WAY too much onion and cooked a little too long. I did use white potatoes though and put them with some carrots on top of the roast for the entire cooking time and they were delicious. Thanks

Loved this recipe. Added a lot more garlic and seasoned the meat with a lot of garlic powder and italian seasoning. My sweet pot went bad so I threw in baby carrots. Not a carrot fan and my husband was not thrilled with them either. Can't wait to try it with Sweet pot. Even my picky daughter loved it.

This was AWESOME!  Only used 1 clove of garlic and mixed some yams with the sweet potatoes.  Probably won't do that next time as they were overdone and seemed like a sponge for the grease.  Thought this was excellent.

The roast turned out "ok", nothing too special. Ours was not dry either. The sweet potatoes turned into mush. The one child I have, who eats anything, passed on them.

Smells very good when cooking, but I thought it was too garlicy.  I took the suggestion of putting slivers of garlic into the pork, because we love garlic, but I think it was too much.  I will make it again with less garlic and I won't insert it into the pork.  Otherwise very tender and juicy.

Very good recipe, I followed the recipe except I used russet potatoes instead of sweet.  I think the sweet would of been better and added more flavor.  I think I'll try using some herbs next time, but will definatley make again.

The recipe was easy and extremely flavorful.  I used acorn squash instead of sweet potatoes and they had a very interesting flavor.  The liquid made a great cornstarch gravy.

I adhered to the liquid & veggie modifications in the moments & thus it turned out great!  I personally prefer this over rice vs pasta myself but it was a big hit with the family!  I doubled the spices & would honestly go over on the meat too.  I bought two packages & although I am not sure how much I got we concluded we could have used more!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I didn't have whole cloves so I used the minced that I had.  2 tablespoons of it and it still had the garlic taste. I will surely make it again.

I did it according to the directions.  Meat was flavorless and not to tender.  It was in the crockpot for 6 hours on low.  I expected meat that would just fall apart and be tasty with the garlic flavor.  No it was not.

I just loved it, you could smell the food all thru my house. Yes I did a couple changes to the recipe. Instead of sweet potatoes I used Idaho baking potatoes cut up, and instead of garlic cloves I used minced garlic . Yes I would make it again

I actually misread it and thought it said "pot" roast, so I used chuck and beef stock. All in all it didn't make much difference and  I can't wait to try again with the "pork" . Lol.

I used 2 pork tenderloins tied together to make 1 larger roast. I seared the roast with olive oil , rosemary, salt and pepper.  Put the sweet potatoes on top of the roast as others have suggested doing.   The pork was delicious but the potatoes , onions and broth didn’t taste good to me. I didn’t care for the  onions and garlic  flavor with the sweet potatoes. I think if I’d used regular potatoes it would have been fantastic!  Maybe my cut of pork was too lean and it needed more fat for flavor?

I used medium russet potatoes & followed the directions exactly. It was soupy, the roast was dry & very bland.  I pseudo-saved it by turning the watery broth into gravy & seasoning the heck out of it.  

Next time, I'm cooking for less time, adding less broth, much more garlic & seasoning the roast a LOT more but I'm still making gravy with the leftover juice.

Delicious and so easy. Sweet potatoes a bit large so I will add less next time. Used a dash of cinnamon as well which added an interesting flavour.

Added basil leaves. And baby carrots instead of potatoes.  It came out good. Chicken boneless thighs instead of pork. Next time I will try with pork or lamb and potatoes.

I made TINY tweaks as I didn't realize I was out of somethings. I knew I didn't have sweet potatoes so I made it with Regular. I also didn't have the  Broth so I sort of made some with Bouillon and water. My potatoes need a little shuzing up before cooking next time IMO but otherwise was good! Hubby and I will DEFINITELY make it again!

I made this roast exactly as written, and all I have to say is TOO MUCH GARLIC.  I would not make this again.  I felt it was a waste of a good roast, and the broth did not make good gravy.

I was disappointed. Slow cooking a boneless pork roast produced cooked but dry meat in the past but I thought I would give this a try. I followed the recipe as written using my Instant Pot to sear, Cato the slow cooker mode on low. Unfortunately, the result was the same.

Yum!  Everyone liked. I had about 4 lbs of pork (country style ribs). I didn't brown ahead of time. I used white potatoes (since my family doesn't care for sweet) and added baby carrots. I doubled the garlic.  Kept the chicken broth the same. Cooked on high for 4 hours, low for 2.

We don't eat sweet potatoes so I did not use them in the recipe.  I am not sure how much the flavor would be changed by adding them.  I stayed with onion and garlic only.  This was extremely easy to put together and my roast turned out very tender with good flavor although it seemed rather dry.  I wish I had thought ahead and used the pan drippings from the browning step to make some gravy.  Next time I will.  Due to the ease of this recipe I will try it again.  I will check it earlier as it could have seemed dry due to my overcooking it.

Tastes great! Just not much seasoning in the chicken broth so I added a lot more seasonings like adobo, & garlic powder & it gave it much more taste! Other than that such a good recipe !

Made this exactly as described.  Turned out so delicious and tasted like a beef roast.  The meat just fell apart.  I used a 2lb pork roast that comes in the 4 pack at Costco.  I'll add a few more cloves of garlic next time, because we love a stronger garlic flavor.

I had to substitute carrots for the sweet potatoes because a renal diet doesn’t allow for the potassium found in potatoes and other foods.  It looked fine but boring when done but I didn’t taste it since it’s going to my elderly parents’ house for their dinner for the next few days. I was wondering how to  snazz it up a bit and so I added about 1/2 cup brandy with a few tablespoons of cornstarch into the leftover liquid. I boiled it up and it tasted so good and makes a delicious sauce for the pork roast.

We don't care for pork with any kind of sweet coating or addition., so this was perfect! I liked that I could put it in the slow cooker before leaving for work and it was done when we came home. Sometimes do the sweet potatoes, sometimes do not. Browning the roast before cooking keeps the flavor and vitamins in! Perfect!

This was really good! I had a shoulder roast I had no idea what to do with...found this. I used homemade chicken broth I had to use so that went in and white potatoes since my husband eats EVERYTHING on this planet but hates sweet potatoes! I did add a tablespoon of balsamic dressing Neumans I believe. I just thought the addition of vinegar would be nice. I cooked it for 1 hour on high and 7 on low(based off my pot and size of roast)..it was fall apart, moist, well seasoned and made an awesome sandwich!!  So I guess I made a few changes but this was great base and I'm sure my changes didn't alter it to much!

I made this and it was ok but nothing to write home about.  It was as though something was missing.  I followed the instructions and had all the ingredients, but it was lacking in good flavor.  My husband said it tasted like cardboard.  Sorry :(

It was OK. Thought it was bland. The best part was the sweet potatoes.  This dish did taste much better when I put gravy on the pork and potatoes when serving this dish.

I made this recipe as written. Will never make again as is. Onions, garlic and sweet potatoes cooked together have a very unpleasant taste. My husband agrees.  I read some of the reviews that have the recipe rated 4 or 5. Most of them used either white potatoes or separated the onions from the sweet potatoes when cooking. If I make this again I will definitely use white potatoes.

Reviews said add another onion and the recipe said cut in wedges.  Both made the onion taste too strong.  After 7-1/2 hrs, the onions were in large pieces.  I cooked longer since double the amount of pork was used.

Cooked the potatoes on top and they came out perfectly soft.

The pork was very tender.

AWESOME. I modified the recipe based on other people's comments. Before searing, I generously sprinkled Steak Seasoning, pepper, salt, and paprica.  To the pot, i added a bunch of baby carrots, six or so small red potatoes (chopped), two chopped onions, three or four cloves minced garlic, and a container of small fresh mushrooms. Additionally, I added about a tsp. of worstershire sauce, and some onion powder along with the water. I didn't have celery. We all loved it!

Anytime a recipe says the seasoning is just salt and pepper, you should always add more seasoning. Or it will be bland. With that said, I know people that actually prefer their food very bland. Everyone has different taste buds. I added nutmeg, thyme,  sage and red pepper. And I also added the potatoes about an hour after I put in the roast. If you can get pork stock or beef stock I think it tastes better. Overall very good. But you do have to make changes to it.  If you really want Tracey - make it on the pan.

I followed the recipe with one exception: I took the suggestion to put the sweet potatoes on top of the roast. In my slow cooker, 6 hours was an hour too long.

Wasn't super impressed with the flavor of the meat. But I have to say I've never thought of using sweet potatoes like that and they really saved the dish. Delicious. Also on my crock pot the 8 hour on low was required. The 6 didn't cut it. Meat didn't get fork tender.

This was great even though I didn't have all the correct ingredients! I only has Russet potatoes on hand and just used 1 cup of chicken broth. I used spices that we like: 1 tesp garlic powder, 1 tesp seasoned salt, 1/2 tesp Italian seasoning and 1/4 tesp black pepper. Mixed the spices, rubbed into the meat (3 lb boneless shoulder roast) and seared the meat. Onions were on the bottom of the crock, then the meat with potatoes around the edges. I sprinkled a teaspoon of dried minced garlic over the meat and poured the broth along the sides. Cooked on low for 10 hours and it came out perfect! Would definitely like to try the sweet potatoes!

We had this for dinner tonight and it was FABULOUS!!  I only had 1 sweet potato so I used a baking potato as well. I put the onion, some garlic cloves and some baby carrots on the bottom, put the roast on top of that. Surrounded the roast with the mixture of potatoes. I also cut some slits in the roast and put several garlic cloves in (we love garlic). Noy did the house smell good!!

The roast was so tender. I will definitely make it again and be sure to have more sweet potatoes next time.

This was good!  Cooked it the recommended 6 hours and my pork roast fell apart totally when I tried to slice it!  Was really over cooked!  Maybe my crock pot is a little too hot but that part was a problem.  We were left with shredded pork. Flavor was good though.

We really enjoyed this.  The Pork Roast was yummy! And great for the holiday season. It was just as good the next day.  I loved that we cooked it in chicken broth! 
The only thing I did differently was, of course, not use canned chicken broth. I just use bullion cubes/granules and make my own. 
I also threw in a bag of baby carrots to the crock pot. It was delicious.

My wife LOVES sweet potatoes.  I put the potatoes on the top as recommended by everyone else.  The Pork was good, but we didn't really like the flavor on of the sweet potatoes.  Giving this 2 stars.

pork turns out great. the sweet potatoes get a little too mushy, but the flavor is really good.

very tasty.  the Pork roast had the consistency of chuck roast or brisket.  It just pulled apart.  I liked that, but my husband didnt like the consistency.

I used a pressure cooker, because I needed to cook faster. For those who complained about the meat being dry: If you used a pork loin, there is very little fat in a loin to keep the meat from drying out. I used country-style boneless pork ribs, and it turned out very moist and juicy. Yes, the sweet potatoes do tend to get mushy - they cook very fast in relation to the meat. I added them about half-way through the process and they were good. I think that next time, I would bake the sweet potatoes - or I'll try it with red potatoes instead.

This is one of the best meals I have had in a long time. We baked potatoes instead of putting in the sweet since that is what we had on hand. I seasoned with garlic powder and seasoned salt, seared then placed in slow cooker for 4 hours. It was tender as can be! Served with salad, peas and baked potatoes.  I would normally make a gravy from the drippings, but I am the only one in my family who likes gravy.

The meat was very bland and the sweet potatoes were weird, but with bbq sauce the meat was delicious and tender.

Super easy and delicious.  I loved the sweet potatoes with the pork.  I went ahead and used a "roast rub" on my pork and threw in a few sprigs of rosemary.  It came out tender and so yummy.

I have made this several times now, and it always comes out great.  The only thing I change is that I usually make it with regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes because I don't think the sweet potatoes add anything. The garlic and onion pretty much overpower them.  And I try to make it with the biggest pork roast my crock pot can handle because we shred the leftovers and make BBQ sandwiches the next night.  You've gotta love such a simple, easy, delicious recipe.

flavor of the meat was good.  I used more garlic than recommended.  I'd agree with the other reviewer that you do not need all the recommended chicken broth.  I don't think the sweet potatoes complemented the pork flavor very well.  I would have used just regular white potatoes.

this was pretty good.  I put 4 cloves of garlic in the pork and 4 more in the pot.  I also left out the salt (port does not need salt). and I seasoned the pork with my "special" seasoning mix before I seared it. The sweet potatoes came out wonderful!!

I'd say this recipe was just "okay". I cooked it in the crock pot for 6 hours on high thinking if I did this, it may be done a little sooner. The sweet potatoes I put in half way through because alot of the reviews said that they were like mush if put in for the full time advised. There was hardly any flavor at all, and I was disappointed. The potatoes were still pretty hard too.

Roast was tender and tasty but the sweet potatoes were overcooked and no one in my family was able to eat them.  The roast was excellent with chunky applesauce and whole wheat couscous.

Great Dinner Meal!  I do have to say though, those sweet potatoes are brutal to peel and slice, but other than that it was great.

I followed the directions exactly and made very sure to sear the meat well.  I even deglazed the pan with the chicken broth.  We found the roast lacking in taste and would have liked a stronger flavor. I will shred it and put it in barbeque sauce for sandwiches.  It just didn't hit the spot.

Very sweet...husband said it could use more garlic, less sweet...but still very very good.  Kids would like it.
