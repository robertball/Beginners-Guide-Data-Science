I made this with Crawfish tails and shrimp also. It is rich and has a definite "Nahlins" flavor!I did spice it a bit, but only because we like our seafood dishes, with a little "heat". One side thought. This site is meant for constructive comments and information. After all,we are trying to help each other feed our families good and tasty meals. Silly reviews do nothing to promote the good will that this site is all about. Good will and Good food!!

Extremely confusing recipe...the five pounds of crawfish tails must mean five pounds of living crawfish cooked and the tail meat extracted from them.  I used two pounds of cooked tail meat and the sauce was just the right amount to cover.  Another problem I had was that one of those pounds of crawfish were frozen from a boil we'd had earlier and were very spicy.  The other pound was purchased and had no seasoning at all.  Even after cooking...one bite had good flavor then another bite was rather bland.  If unseasoned tailmeat is used, I'd suggest at least a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning to be added.  Also, more celery and perhaps more bell pepper would add as well.  As is, this recipe barely makes a four.
