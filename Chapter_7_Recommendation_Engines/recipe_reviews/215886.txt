I have never been a huge Lasagna fan but my husband asked me to make some. I used this recipe but added hamburger to the sausage, used about 1 1/2 c. parmesan cheese (because I had extra) and it turned out wonderful!!! My husband kept complimenting me throught the whole dinner.

I made it with no changes and just as instructed.  It was sooooo dry and a big disappointment.  I now owe my husband a lasagna and will keep searching for a good recipe.

I used ground beef instead of sausage and my family said this is best thing I've ever made :) They ask for it every other Sunday now and it is easy to make...Love it!!

I haven't made lasagna in over 10 years!  This recipe looked doable and I made it with wheat noodles and lean beef.  I added some sausage for flavor, a little extra sauce, low fat ricotta, with a few spoonfuls of cottage cheese to make it creamier, and extra mozarella cheese.  It turned out perfect!

I did not put any meat in this, but used the exact directions and ingridients otherwise...my family LOVED IT.  I used extra tomato sauce for our liking and also included onion, green pepper, zuchinni and yellow squash (needed to use them up!)  Great addition to this very simply recipe!

Pretty standard lasagna recipe - nothing fancy. I cooked my lasagna beforehand but only made 9 instead of 12. Good thing because I wasn't able to get another layer out of my ingredients even though I used the same amount of everything.

Five stars with my little tweaks. I added cayenne and cinnamon to my meat. I used 1 lb turkey and 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage with lots of garlic.  I also added cottage cheese to my ricotta and doubled the mozzarella. I threw a bay leaf into my garlic spaghetti sauce along with crushed red pepper for some heat. Excellent!!
