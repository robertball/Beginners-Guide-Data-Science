The combinaton was very good. However I was not sure what to do with the grilled onion slices. IE; on top whole, set mushroom on top of slice, chop onions and put on top?? The tase combo was great, I just wasn't sure about the presentation.

As written, I would give this a four, but with a few additions (fresh ground black pepper, garlic salt and balsamic vinegar drizzled on top after cooking is complete, this becomes a five. Very simple to prepare. Left my onions very, very thick. I also rubbed olive oil on the outside but next time may try to marinade the mushrooms. Also, used Portobello. Lovely presentation also.

These are now a MUST with our family each time we grill!  They were so very delicious and complementary to the steaks we had.  Everyone needs to try these at least once...they melt in your mouth!

This was very easy. I used small portabellos and they turned out great. I just made these again and added sliced avocado before eating. I love blue cheese and avocado

These were great ~ I didn't change a thing. I did cook them in the stove instead of on the grill, and sauteed the onions on top of the stove. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic recipe for the grill! I marinated both the onions and mushrooms in italian dressing which gave them an awesome flavor. I took the onion slices and put toothpicks through them as to hold together the rings so they wouldn't get lost in the grill! Wasn't 100% sure on the presentation, BUT SO GOOD. They just melt in your mouth!

I sautee mine in a pan instead of on the BBQ to keep all of the blue cheese inside of the mushrooms.  They always turn out excellent.

Super easy and always a huge hit at BBQ's. I make this and take it along in a lasagna tin foil dish and just cook it on the grill, in the dish covered in foil. I also coat the mushroom caps in olive oil and garlic salt (shaking the caps around in a freezer bag with the garlic salt and oil) before I fill them with the cheese. There are NEVER leftovers of these!

This recipe was well received at a BBQ last night, however it was a bit salty for me.  I also did a few mushrooms with goat cheese, because not everyone likes blue cheese.  The goat cheese mushrooms were awesome.  Overall very simple appetizer, which was great.  Next time I may try cream cheese with jalepenos mixed in as the filling, along with more goat cheese mushrooms.

These are amazing! Also works very well with green onions and garlic of course. I could eat these by the dozen!

These were a little too strong for us, but if you're a big blue cheese fan, maybe you'd like them more. I marinated the mushrooms in italian dressing before stuffing as another reviewer suggested and they just turned out slimy.

I put these on the barbie and in the oven. I didn't use onions though. The family doesn't care for them. These mushrooms were a hit! They went fast. The mushrooms are juicy, and dripping with flavor. A favorite every time we BBQ now. Thanks!

EXCELLENT!  We had guest comming for dinner and one of the girls is a veggitarian.  We were having country style ribs, so I prepared vegie kabobs for her and these mushrooms for all of us.  The ONLY reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did alter them a bit.  I skipped the onions all together and used Gorganzola cheese as per another reviewer.  EVERYONE loved them and they were gone in a big hurry!

So easy and delicious! We just added some chopped up garlic and ground pepper once the mushrooms were stuffed and cooked in stove and a few minutes in the broiler! Awesome appetizer!

Overall these were good. I stuffed them with blue cheese crumbles, drizzled with olive oil and "cooked" them on the grill. I sauted the onions in a skillet on the stove and added them on top of the mushrooms for presentation. I think next time I might try these with half blue cheese and half feta as the blue cheese was a bit strong for my liking.  I diced up the left overs and added them to my ciche for brunch the following day which was absolutely delish!! Thanks for the post!

These are a huge hit with our grilling crowd!  We grill the stems at the same time and then stick them down in to the blue cheese when done.  Makes for a fun presentation, and no wasted stems.  We often just make the mushrooms without the onions.

I'm not a mushroom fan, but my husband absolutely adores these.  We have made them on the grill and also in the oven, and we have also switched up the cheese- sometimes feta, herbed feta, bleu cheese, gorgonzola....any similar cheese would work well.  We made these with the onions the first time, but haven't bothered with them any time since.  They are just a distraction.

YUM!!!!  I made these for my brother when he came for dinner (big mushroom fan!)  He LOVED THEM!  We all did!  I marinated the mushrooms in Robusto Italian dressing (my favorite to use for a marinade)...and I used crumbled Blue Cheese for some and crumbled Feta for others.  I'm going to try it with gorgonzola next time.  I will make these OFTEN!  It doesn't need the grilled onions...I made them because I like grilled onions...but these are great by themselves!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

If you like Blue Cheese, these were great.  My husband and I loved them, but my brother in-law thought eating 1 whole mushroom at once made it seem too rich.  We made them with grilled steak and I would cut my mushroom in half with a bit of steak, onion and it was perfect.  Will definetly be making again.

LOVED THESE!!!  But I do think that you need to be a really big blue cheese fan to enjoy it.  I tried gorgeonzola cheese with it and I give it more than FIVE STARS.....so much better!!!!  These where so easy and everyone loved them.

Dang it! I forgot to drizzle w/ balsamic as JDVMD suggested. I didn't grill these but cooked the mushrooms  in the oven & the onions sauteed on the stove in butter & olive oil. I drizzled the mushrooms w/ a bit of olive oil & sprinkled them w/ salt & pepper before popping them in the oven. I used really, really big buttons & I think I stuffed them w/ too much blue cheese. Next time I'll not put as much in.

I printed off this recipe, got everything together, trotted out to the grill, tried to fire it up... No gas! So, I headed back in, shook the cheese of the mushrooms, sauteed them in butter in a skillet, topped them with the cheese, then popped them in the mic for 20 seconds. Meanwhile, I grilled the onions on the Foreman. Everything turned out really delicious! Thanks, Jeff!

Very tasty very simple recipe. My husband and I really enjoyed these, but my toddler was unimpressed. I grabbed an onion on my fork, then a mushroom and popped both in my mouth at the same time. Mmm! Has to be a little healthier than breaded and fried mushrooms, right?

I didn't actually make these as listed at all so I give it 5 stars because for fans of blue cheese they'd probably be a hit.  I don't like blue cheese and don't have a grill so I stuffed portabellas with a 50/50 feta/mozzarella combination, set them to cook in a cast iron skillet (had already cooked the sweet onions in butter and pushed 'em to the sides) when the cheese melted, I put the whole thing in the oven to broil on high till the cheese browned a little.  They were SO good...easy too...will definitely make this again...maybe tomorrow. :)

I love mushrooms and enjoy blue cheese as well.  I'm doing low carb so this fit great into my diet.  I used onion powder(to eliminate a few more carbs)rather then onions and it turned out very tasty.

Simple and good for appetizers while grilling.  I used feta cheese and skipped the onions.  I've used blue in the past which is also good.

Yum!  I put the sliced onions on the bottom of heavy aluminum foil.  I put the stuffed mushrooms carefully on top. I created a foil pack that I placed on the grill and did not turn over.  A couple of the mushrooms did leak cheese but the combination of flavors was awesome! Served with grilled steak and potatoes!

Delicious! However, the only issue I have is that mushrooms can get soft quickly and turn a bit soggy.  Not sure how to remedy this? They still turned out good and the blue cheese tasted soooo good.

These were FANTASTIc and so simple.  Do not omit the onion, it adds flavor.  These are great with grilled steaks.

yummy!  i used a portobello for this instead.  i just put slices of a danish blue cheese on top & grilled it outside.  i used small homegrown onions that i just cut in half, which also made it easier b/c i didn't have to worry about them falling through.  after they were all cooked, i drizzled a nice think basalmic vinegar around the top of the mushroom, then topped with layers of the small onion.  the only thing i'll do differently next time is not forget to add cheese to the stump as well.  very delicious!  i will be doing this again!  it's so simple, i don't know why i didn't think of it before!

Who needs onions?!  We made these without onions, just stuffed mushrooms with blue cheese.  Our guest asked for a doggy bag of mushrooms!  Very easy & tasty way to use up those mushrooms!  We've now made several times as an easy appetizer.  Thanks for great idea!

These are amazing! I took them to my cooking club with around 8 girls. I would make 1 1/2 to 2 times this recipe if it is going to be your only appetizer. They go quick! It was difficult to know what to do with the onions. i just sliced them and placed them on top after cooking.

This was easy and yummy!  Being from Buffalo, NY, means we cook with a lot of blue cheese!  This was a big hit!

These were fantastic! I love stuffed mushrooms, and these are both the best and the easiest I've made. Gone in about two minutes.

This recipe was a hit.  I brought it along to a friend's "pot luck" as they were grilling the steaks.  I cooked it in a frying pan on the stove as I didn't have the grill going. apperance wasn't very nice but they were gone right away. Have made several times since, always on top of the stove.

I served this for a birthday party cookout,  everyone loved them. I can see serving them everytime we grill steaks.  I think the charcoal grill added a little extra smokey flavor.

I felt there was something missing from these, which I made yesterday for the 4th. Everyone else liked them, but I thought the mushrooms themselves seemed kind of bland (despite the blue cheese inside).

This is a delicious and easy vegetarian stuffed mushroom recipe. I tried it on the grill and in the toaster oven. Both worked great and did not heat up my kitchen in the summer. In the toaster oven, I cooked the mushrooms for about 15 mins on 350 degrees, then broiled the tops until the cheese was melted.  I also tried blue cheese, Gorgonzola cheese, and feta cheese.   This is what I learned:
1) All the cheeses were awesome. Blue cheese was the richest, then gorgonzola, then feta.
1) Do NOT remove the stems of the mushrooms. It makes too much room for the cheese and the cheese is too rich. Turn mushrooms upside down and, using the small end of a chopstick, push down or scoop out the membrane between the cap and the stem. This leaves a small space around the stem to add the cheese. I pushed nuggets of cheese in the space, and then cooked them.
2) Because the blue cheese is such a strong flavor, the second time I put less cheese in the space and then pushed some chopped caramelized onions in the space and on top. This was the best combination, from my perspective. The rich cheese flavor combined with the caramelized onion to perfectly balance the meaty mushroom flavor.
3) On the grill, I used a large disposable aluminum pan on top of the grill. I put olive oil and Sazon seasoning in it. First I had the mushrooms in the middle where it was hottest, then I pushed them to the side and put the onions in the middle. When the onions were almost done, I pushed them to the sides and pu
