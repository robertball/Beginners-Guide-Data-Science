I have it simmering on my stove now, and it is the best sauce I've ever made and I'm an old Italian fuss. I added the ingredients Chef John puts in his Tomato Sauce recipe also on this site, i.e., 1 rib celery, 2 tea sugar, 1 tea anchovy paste, 1 tea white wine vinegar and 1/2 tea dried Italian herbs. It is so heavenly and old fashion tasting it almost brings tears to my eyes.

So this is how my mother in law taught me to make sauce. We  brown the meat bones in the pot we cook the sauce in rather than in the oven. The brown bits are already there. The meatballs we do cook on a cookie sheet in the oven We also add a little vino. Red or white works . We eat it that day and freeze the leftovers in single meal containers or freezer bags .

Made as directed, as usual when Chef John is the one cooking. Simmered for 4 hours, removed meat (which was tender / falling off of the bone), simmered for another hour to let the sauce reduce a bit more, and served it with garlic bread and fresh local pasta. Really a treat. I really want to suggest not pureeing the tomatoes or using tomato sauce - using your hands to break up the San Marzano's like instructed provides some great texture. A+, 5/5!

Have been making this for years and I use a pot roast which I slice in thirds if it is a round type but if I can find it, I use a chuck blade roast as it is already flat. I also use pork chops or country style pork ribs and sometimes I add sweet Italian sausage if I have it. I brown in a dutch oven and then brown my tomato paste a bit and add my San Marzano after deglazing the pan with wine. Plenty of garlic is the key! It cooks for between 4 and 5 hours and it is sheer heaven. Nothing more soul satisfying than Sunday sauce!

JUST like my grandmother used to make -- (except she fried her paste with the onions until it turned a rich brown - AND she added a few leaves of basil - you've GOT to add the basil)  :-)   Thanks for the recipe!

This looks just like the sauce my grandmother and aunts used to make.  I've gotten away from putting meat in my sauce and really hate ground meat in sauce.  Think I'll go back to this method.  From my memories, this is awesome.  When Grandma made polenta, the sauce she used was like this only she used Italian sausage simmered in the sauce - it was outstanding.  Thanks, Chef John, for the walk down memory lane and for a keeper.

Very good sauce!  Reminded me of the sauce my Northern Italian grandmother and my mother made with deep, rich flavors.  I used whatever meat I had on hand, which included pork chops and a small sirloin.  I threw in a couple browned Italian sausages toward the end.  I browned the meat in the stockpot instead of the oven, though.  Removed the browned meat, sweated the onions and garlic in the pot, then deglazed the pot with a little red wine before adding the tomatoes, seasonings, and water and returning the browned meat to the pot.  Thank you, Chef John, for reminding me that not all sauces need to have oregano and basil.

This is exactly how my husband's grandfather (from Italy) made his sauce (which they called "gravy"!)....he used a beef roast browned in the oven and added to the tomatoes, then simmered. The meat was always removed and sliced, served separately on a platter. Buon Appetito!

There are many variations of this. We went to my grandmother's every Sunday for her version. Chef John's  looks excellent, as usual. 

My grandmother canned her own tomatoes from Italy, once or twice a year, in her basement kitchen. The whole family got together to help. Memories.

Today, I use San Marzano tomatoes.

I have made sauce seems like forever, taught by my grandmother,  used pork neckbones in the sauce, seldom chicken because it makes the sauce watery, fried the meats if they went into the sauce, never used the oven.  Once the onions and garlic were fried, then the paste went in,  fried the paste until it took on a brownish color, in most cases seldom used tomatoes  unless fresh, always made sauce using paste only. Could be why they used a little sugar. We always fried our meat balls, I 've seen some shows where the meatballs are put into the sauce raw....don't  know about that, I would think one might get scum on top of the sauce doing that. I don't think I would go through the trouble of browning the meats in the oven when they can be fried before putting into the sauce.

This was wonderful!  I had a bunch of ripe Roma tomatoes from the garden, but not enough to can.  So I used them in place of the canned tomatoes.  Only thing I did differently is not add the water or red pepper flakes and I added a minced stock of celery with leaves.  After it cooked a while, I used my hand immersion mixer for just a second, leaving a lot of tomato lumps.  This was so good, I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks, Chef John!

Once again, another hit from Chef John.  I couldn't find beef shank.  A friend who is a local chef suggested ox tails.  Couldn't find those either.  Nor did I want to buy a whole package of chicken thighs, because my grocery store didn't have any loose ones at the counter.  So I took Chef John's advice and improvised.  I used two smoked turkey wings, about two pounds of pork riblets, and some beef short ribs.  It turned out fantastic.  The slow simmer and reduction really concentrates the flavors and produces a very rich dish.  I added about a TBS of basil because I really like it in my tomato sauces.  I love cooking things like this on a lazy Sunday.  It reduced quite a bit but there was still enough for a couple of meals with my son with a lot left over.  I will probably freeze the rest after we have it again tomorrow night.

When I was a child, I would hang around the next door Italian neighbour's on Sunday evening so I could have spaghetti and veal cutlets.  I loved it so much.  I made this sauce last Sunday.  I used a beef shank  (Osso bucco style), spare ribs and two chicken thighs .  I deglazed the roasting pan with a little red wine and added all to the sauce.  All ingredients were the same.  It was amazing!  I was able to get 3 large ziplock containers of sauce for the freezer.  The only problem I had was, once it defrosted, my son ate half the sauce out of the container prior to making the pasta and we had defrost another container.  He said it was the best sauce he had ever eaten.  Kudos Chef John for bringing happy memories of my childhood to my family

My family and I loved this sauce and loved the meats that were cooked in it.  Following Chef John's advice, I threw extra meats into it:  some Italian sausage and some pork chops in addition to what he listed in the recipe.  My chicken thighs actually fell apart in the sauce so we had little shreds of chicken in it.  The kids and I both loved this.  I froze half of it so we had it available for a few weeks.  My 13-year old daughter has told me that I need to make this once a month so we always have it available!

Kids liked this.  Took some work to make, but it made a large batch and I froze much of it for later.  Tasted better after freezing.  Not a spicey sauce.  Pretty bland, but mixed meats give an interesting flavor.

The sauce is so good and so easy to make.  The most difficult step was opening 4 cans with a manual can opener!   Thank you, Chef John, for another awesome "procedure/recipe."  I did purchase two beef shanks but raided my freezer for some chicken, a skinny pork blade chop, Italian sausage as well as tossing in several slices of leftover pork tenderloin. After retrieving the meat from the sauce, I chopped it in the food processor before returning it to the sauce.

We have a very similar recipe, the only probem with ours is that the cheese gets really sticky. We add it towards the end instead of before the long cook. Is that the difference? 
I can't wait to try your recipe with the multiple meats.

I’ve made this 3 times and love having it in the freezer ready whenever I need it.  I like it just as written although sometimes hard to find the beef shank I do prefer using it.  Crushed tomatoes worked better than crushing myself (to watery) and the San Marzano yummy!

My mother used to do something similar but with chicken only. I skipped the roasting of meats because I used some leftover shredded chuck roast instead of beef shank and used pull pork. I added no water, added a little beef broth, and used only 2 cans of crushed tomatoes. I did cooked recipe in a slow cooker and it was different compared to a spaghetti tomato sauce.

Love this recipe!  I will use it again and again.  I could not find beef shank anywhere so I used 2 lbs of beef ribs. I deglazed the pan with red wine instead of water as chef John suggested in his video. Then put everything in a slow cooker to continue cooking. It was a warm day and I did not want to heat the house. And before serving I removed the meats, took out all the bones and put the meat back in the sauce.  It was pretty easy as the meats where falling off the bones.

DELICIOUS!! I’ve never made “Sunday Sauce” before but have always wanted to! I feel I would have made my Italian Ancestors very proud today. This recipe is easy yet complex and you reap the benefits flavor wise! My wife (somewhat picky) said it was better than anything she’s eaten at an Italian restaurant in a long time. Looking forward to playing with this recipe in the future and use different cuts of meat.

I am a pretty good cook.  I had NO idea that by braising meat;  I use whatever dark meat on hand; thighs with skin, ribs (pork and/or beef)  that this changes the world of gravy for any pasta; lasagna, linguine, fettuccine, ziti, etc.  This  gravy is a life-changer for me.  Now I feel like a gravy snob as I can tell when no meats/marrow have been stewed in the gravy!  Make a double batch and freeze it.  SO worth it.

Just fine as is! This is what Italian friends' grandmas made while we were all growing up.  Two rules:  3 kinds of meat, and the meat's gotta MELT off the bones!

Oh wow this was great. For the meat I used Italian sausages and the pork spare ribs. I only had 2 hours to cook this in and it was still wonderful - I can only imagine how good it would have been if I had the 4 required. This is definitely now my weekend go to pasta sauce recipe.

A very good basic "Sunday" Sauce!!  I adjusted this after first two times with a previous recipe I possessed.  Added more garlic, fresh basil, and red pepper to taste.

I made this back a few months ago when I had company coming for a few days. It was a huge hit and I personally loved it as did my company and my husband. It was different and very tasty. Yes, it was some work but the end results were amazing. I am definitely going to make it again and again and have kept the recipe to do so. I also made it as written by the Chef.

I'm a little hesitant to use beef, pork and chicken all in the same dish?.. I've never done that before, but will give it a try.
