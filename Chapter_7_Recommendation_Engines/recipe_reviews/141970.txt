These were fantastic! I wanted to make them lower fat, so I tried using apple sauce instead of the oil and it turned out great! The texture was perfect for crepes and this was surprisingly yummy considering the whole wheat flour. I added the berries while the crepe was in the pan as suggested, then I took the crepe out and added fat free rasperry yogourt. Definately a guilt free indulgence!!!

These are so, so, so good. And you totally don't need the oil. Substitute oil with 2 tsp unsweetened applesauce and this is a truly a 100% healthy recipe.  Very impressed here. Mine made exactly 5, 1/4 cup crepes, at 62 calories each!

I made these last night and they were so easy and very yummy! I put in about a tablespoon of chocolate chips with the the mixed berries in the middle, and then topped the crepe with some reserved juice from the thawed-out berries. VERY GOOD! Also, I didn't use whole-wheat flour, as I didn't have any on hand, but all-purpose flour worked just fine.

Using 1 whole egg, 3 egg whites, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, a pich of baking soda, cinnamon, and no oil works better, and is healthier (calorie and grams fat wise), plus, I think it tates better, but letting it set for a couple hours makes any doughy-floury taste go away, but add the soda just before you cook.

I have 2 leftover egg whites and this recipe was just right for it. Other recipes use whole eggs or egg yolks, but never just egg whites. Using whole wheat flour, skim milk and no sugar, this is a healthy desert for me. I use banana and a little melted chocolate for the filling though. Next time I'll try to follow the recipe to the T.

These were great! I used blueberries and strawberries as the filling. I used small pinches of sugar here and there because the crepes themselves were not sweet at all. I also used applesauce in place of oil and it worked the same. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the batter as well.I reduced the berries in a sauce pan with a tsp of sugar and poured a-top the crepe! Will surley make this again but I'm thinking cinamon apples or banannas and chocolate chips next time!

Wow.  This recipe is incredible and so easy!  Just ate them for breakfast with fresh mixed berries, instead of frozen.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp sugar.  I will make these all the time.

Absolutely delicious! I made these for a Saturday breakfast and was a fantastic hit. Instead of filling the crepe with mixed berries, I filled it with melted chocolate, sliced almonds and sliced bananas.  I also took other reviewers advice and used applesauce instead of vegetable oil. I found the ratio of flour and milk to result in thicker than expected batter so I added about two tablespoons more milk. Not only did the crepes come out thinner but made it easer to spread the batter in the pan.   Also, I found that a dash of cinnamon and half a tablespoon of vanilla extract really adds a nice flavor to the crepe.   The last alteration I made was cooking the batter in coconut oil instead of using the recommended cooking spray. It’s healthier and tastier!  I decorated the crepes with powdered sugar and served them with vanilla yogurt, sliced strawberries and blackberries.

I made this recipe to use up some frozen fruit and whole wheat flour I had on hand. They were very tasty, and easy to make. Take this hint for making the crepes - do not attempt to flip the crepes until they look almost done on top. I doubled the fruit for this recipe and let it sit with a little sugar on top before using. Topped it with whipped cream and these were delicious!

Absolutely delicious! And actually healthy! The fillings/fruit possibilities are endless with these. I didn't put the oil in but used 2 tsp of applesauce like someone else suggested. GREAT recipe!!!

It does not taste at all like crepe. It tastes very "egg-whitish" and looks egg-whitish". Very disappointed in this recipe.

These were really good.  I served them as written, with berries, and then again with apples sauted in a bit of butter w cinnamon and a touch of brown sugar.  The kids LOVED them with the apples, I thought both ways were nice.

What's not to love? It's a sophisticated, delicious and forgiving recipe. Even with my own kitchen ineptitude/bold albeit accidental experimentation it turned out to be the culinary highlight of my week. Brilliant. Sacramento kids do things right.

Very good, but it does need extra liquid - either more egg white or milk or both.  I added cinnamon, vanilla and a teaspoon or so of sugar. I cooked the blueberries with a little water, lemon juice, corn starch and sugar to get a better consistency.

I made the crepes fat free by substituting 1 tbsp plain nonfat yogurt for the tbsp of oil, and the results were fantastic.  These are going in to my regular rotation!

This was exceptionally easy and I had everything I needed on hand. I sweetened the frozen fruit with a little low fat vanilla yogurt and honey. It was perfect!! I'm usually intimidated by pancakes and crepes but this was honestly so very easy!!

I left out the oil all together and made w regular white all purpose flour for lack of whole wheat and regular almond milk. Crepes themselves came to 166 calories each which really makes filling possibilities endless if you are watching calories! I did one with mixed fruit and one with scrambled egg whites and cheese. These are wonderful to make ahead and warm and fill quickly on mornings you are running out the door!

I added a little bit of honey (1/4 cup for 4 servings) to the batter and whipped the egg whites before folding them in.  It made these crepes a little less dense and gave them a touch of sweetness.

These are AMAZING! You can eat them for breakfast, or as a late night, GUILT FREE, dessert! I do everything the exact same, except when you flip the crepe over and put the berries inside, put some nutella in there as well and follow the rest of the recipe, SO GOOD. The nutella is healthy, and goes excellent with the berries, the crepe, everything. So so so so so good!

Made these for breakfast this morning, spur of the moment, and everyone loved them! I did add a little cinnamon but kept everything else the same and they were perfect. Made a second batch with just blueberries and my husband liked even better. Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic, quick and easy. Takes some practice rolling the pan and getting the right temp to make them light and crispy! I didn't have any berries so I just used reduced sugar jelly. YUM!!

My daughter liked these well enough when i substituted brown rice flour for the wheat, but I made my batch with the whole wheat and it tasted too weird. I will definitely keep looking for a new recipe for crepes

I don't know what i did wrong but the batter just wouldn't mix for me.  I don't know if it was the whole-wheat flour but it kept separating.  I will try it one more time but any suggestions for making the batter better?

I've made this three times and it is spectacular!!! Instead of oil, I used applesauce and I added light sour cream and honey to the fruit before adding it to the crepe to make it a little sweeter. My boyfriend love it.  Amazing!!!!!!

I just made these crepes for breakfast.  I put cottage cheese in them and fruit spread (or fresh fruit) on top.  That's the way my mom made them when we were kids.  These were delicious.  I followed the recipe as written, except I used Egg Beaters instead of egg whites, and then adjusted the batter by adding small amounts of milk until it was the consistency I wanted.  They tasted so good, and I like that they are low-fat and made with wheat flour.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very good! Only recommendation is to add more fruit, otherwise it's very little fruit in each crepe. Other than that, excellent! Very healthy!

This was absolutely FANTASTIC!! I added a dash of vanilla and cut down on the oil (I think next time I'll try it without!) and they were amazing! They tasted a little different than normal crepes - but it was a better, richer flavor from the whole wheat flour. These were a relatively guilt free breakfast for me and I will be making them again!!

This was an easy recipe.  The batter came out thicker than a normal crepe so added more milk.  I also added some vanilla to sweet them up.  Without it I thought they tasted kind of bland.  Squeeze a lemon on top (or lemon juice).

When **I** smeared them with homemade strawberry jam, I thought they were okay...but like my family said, "we'd rather treat ourselves to the real thing every couple of weeks then add this into our weekly rotation."  A little stiff and just not that tasty.  3-start for making it healthy tho!

Excellent crepes! Simple and seem to be healthy. I used all-purpose flour because it's all I had, but they turned out great. I filled one with fruit and a little light and fit vanilla yogurt and one with bananas and peanut butter to add a little protein to my breakfast. Delicious! I'll make these again for sure!

Super yummy, and a simple recipe! I only had whole milk on hand, but then cut the veggie oil to about a teaspoon to balance out the fat content.  The only fruit I had was apple pie filling, which was actually a delish filling.  I've never made crepes before, and I must say that mind were a little thick... it must take practice!  Will be making these again!

It's been my experience that using fresh berries is always much better than using the frozen kind, just that fact that you can be absolutely sure what's in it and there are no preservatives. Just a helpful tip there, other than that i thought it was great!

I used fresh berries instead of frozen because it was berry season.  Also added cream cheese. Delious. I will make again, maybe using different fruit.

This was a very easy and quick dessert to make. I halved the recipe and made just two small crepes. (I had one leftover egg white) I filled them with banana and chocolate   bits. It came out very good. Next time  I will try it with the berries for breakfast.

Very good, hard to get the berries to stay in crepe tho, might try cooking them down first and the crepe is a tad thick. I just added more milk to thin it somewhat so it would spread better in the pan.

YUM! These are awesome! I make them on lazy weekend mornings and my boyfriend loves them. I usually am able to get 5 crepes out of this recipe. That's only 80 calories each (not counting the filling). For the filling I add a little nonfat plain greek yogurt and fresh berries or sometimes I microwave apples and cinnamon for the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!! Subbed whole wheat flour for all purpose because that's all I had but they turned out fine. Also, I had to double it because the portions were too small for my needs. Other than that, perfection.

C'est tres magnifique! Exceptional Crepes! Wow! I had saved this recipe to my recipe box a while back (I wanted a whole wheat recipe), but never got around to making them. But I made a Key lime pie the other day, and that recipe had called for 4 egg yolks, and I saved the whites aside with nothing in particular in mind for them. Then I remembered that I hadn't had a crepe in at least two years, and harkened back to this recipe. Obviously because of the amount of whites I had, I doubled the whole recipe, but swapped the veggie oil for unsweetened applesauce to good effect! I actually tried something a wee bit different for the filling; sliced banana, a tsp chopped walnuts, and a small drizzle of maple. Then after I took it out of the pan I dolloped some fat free cool whip and cinnamon on top. Yum! I will try the berries sometime; I just didn't have any on hand. I actually also got 10 crepes from the double recipe! I froze my leftovers in a large ziplock, layering saran wrap between each for easy removal. I popped one in the microwave for 30 seconds to defrost, then put it into a pan and put in the filling to heat up. Worked like a charm!

These were just okay. Texture was fine, but the flavor was very bland!  I feel like crepes should be delicious by themselves.  I did try these a second time using butter for the oil (butter is actually less calories--just the fat is saturated) and a whole egg (the yolk has vitamins B & D, and iron).  The crepes were much better, but I am going to have to tweak the recipe some more to get a nice flavor.  I really like the concept of using whole wheat for that extra nutritional punch.

I tried this recipe because I had some egg whites I wanted to use but, but they stuck to the pan terribly. I tried 2 different pans (both an 8" crepe pan and a 12" non-stick skillet), tried adjusting the temperature, tried adding more/less cooking oil to the pan, but every single one stuck. I had to scrape out the bottom of the pan each time and re-apply cooking oil. They tasted ok, but every one got ripped to shreds in the process of trying to get it off the bottom of the pan and it was frustrating to cook them and they looked horrible because they were all ripped up. They did not have the proper browning on them because the browned part stuck to the pan. I've made traditional full-fat crepes a few times before and did not have this issue--those came right up and were easy to flip with no effort. I salvaged my crappy-looking crepes by using them to make a corn casserole where they were covered with sauce so their appearance didn't make much difference, but they were a real pain to cook and created extra work with having to scrape the pan each time. Next time I'll just make regular crepes.

I was really craving something simple and tasty and this was just it! Very easy recipe! I added raspberry jelly on my first 3 and then ham and cheese on my fourth. Simply splendid!

Way too thick. Even when I added extra milk, it still was hard to spread in the pan. It also had a bad after-taste.

These were delicious.  I used Nutella and raspberry jam because I didn't have the fruit - and they were really good.

Fabulous, easy crepes that can be used for sweet or savory filling, especially if you have left over egg-whites.  Regular flour was used.

Great recipe! My parents loved it. I doubled the recipe and used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. For filling, I used scrambled eggs and chopped soy sausage patty and then for a dessert crepe we had chocolate hazelnut spread, chopped banana, and whipped cream. Delicious! I would definitely use this again. Thanks so much!

These were delicious, I'm going to make them again tomorrow. Only thing I did differently was that I added 1 tsp vanilla.

I used Almond milk added olive oil and stuffed them with ricotta and chicken then covered them in a baking dish with diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and seasoning, sharp, mancheco and Parmesan cheeses then baked them. Oh my yumminess!  
I’ve used this recipe before and and happy with it.

We used to make these all the time, so easy. We used almond milk and white instead of red whole wheat flour.

Delicious, made for Valentines Breakfast.  I used all natural apple sauce instead of oil like another reviewer did and also used unsweetened almond milk instead of skim milk.  It was very good and a pretty breakfast.  Will definitely make again.

It was way too thick. I added a bit of water but not enough. Otherwise it was fine.

Nice healthy recipe that you can whip up quickly on a Sunday morning . I added the fruit after making the crepe as I do not like warm fruit. I added maple syrup.

Great recipe!! Although I didn't have whole wheat flour, all purpose flour worked great. Also instead of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil and it turned out fine. Also, I substituted skim milk with almond milk. Yummy and healthy!

I didn't see any difference between this and whole egg versions. I added a splash of vanilla extract to give it a bit more flavor.

I used soy milk because I didn't have regular milk. I also added vanilla flavoring. These crepes are bad, but they don't have a lot of flavor, and the whole wheat makes the crepes  texture grainier. If I am going to make crepes I will just make the fattier version because it tastes better.
