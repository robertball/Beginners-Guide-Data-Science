Made these last night with some beef brisket.  Cut back on the thyme and found that the sugar made them a little too sweet for my taste.  A tip for everyone - put your butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes until really cold and then using the large holes on your grater, grate the butter into the flour mixture.  This makes it easier to incorporate the butter and makes a great flaky biscuit.  I will definitely make these again but with less sugar.

First time biscuit maker! I really liked them. Didn’t use thyme or cream of tartar. I used block cheddar and I shredded it myself, made the biscuits tastier. The dough was incredible easier to work with. I cut the circles using a disposable plastic cup, the size was perfect. Next time I think I’m going to use less sugar and maybe add some bacon into the dough. I’ll keep you posted. Hope the review helps!

Superb! If the limit were not 5 stars, I could have given it a lot more. I happened to have some cheddar cheese and fresh thyme on hand or I might not have made this - and I'm so glad I did - it's absolutely scrumptious. And I think I'm going to try substituting other fresh herbs for the thyme - with rosemary and then with dill. Not that the thyme isn't as good as anything needs to be - yum - but just because I think it might be equally good in other ways to go with various foods. I baked these biscuits till they were light golden brown, and then put them on top of a nice, heated, beef burgundy stew and baked it like that for a few more minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

I reduced the amount of thyme and wished I had not.  I reduced the amount of sugar to a mere 2 teaspoons and was very glad I did.  When I removed the biscuits from the oven I brushed them with melted butter to which I added garlic powder and dried parsley flakes (fresh is always an option too).   I found these to be perfectly risen, tender and salted just right for optimal flavor.  Had I used the entire amount of sugar called for, however,  I think I'd be singing a different song.

Perfect as is.  I experimented with using 1 1/2 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and that worked very well too.  Next time I'm going to try sprinkling a little grated cheese on top just before baking, in addition to the cheese mixed in the batter.  This is a good biscuit to serve with gravy, or to make breadfast sandwiches.

I've been searching for the perfect biscuit for a while now, and i've just found it. Flavourful, moist but still flaky, these were delicious! I'd make these again at the drop of a hat. I did have to add a touch of extra milk, though.

These were soooo good.  I didn't have thyme so I just used cheddar and they were still delicious.  Letting the dough sit for a while extra (15 minutes) made them rise a bit more and look more biscuit-y.

A little too sweet, but otherwise very good. Nice texture and I love the cheddar-thyme combo. Great with beef stew.

I loved these! I used less sugar than the recipe called for, and buttermilk instead of regular milk. I also used whatever cheese I had which was some sliced porvalone (I chopped it) and some shredded cheddar cheese. However what really made them special was using a suggestion from another reviewer. I put the butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes, then grated it before incorporating into the flour. They came out super flakey! and the chopped provalone browned quite nicely adding to the flavor:)

These were tasty and baked up great.  I think the 3T of sugar was a little too sweet for me, as I was making the biscuits for sausage/gravy at breakfast.  Next time I would use less sugar.

I love the versatility of this recipe!  I didn't have any thyme, so I used 1 finely diced and seeded jalapeno.  Delicious!  Now I'm making mozzarella- roasted garlic flaky biscuits.  I can't wait until my husband gets home!

I love thyme so I knew I would like these but I was wrong. I loved them. Next time I will cut the sugar a bit and add a little more cheese because I love cheese too.

I was looking for a biscuit recipe that did not call for buttermilk because I only had regular milk on hand. These were great!  Mine took a little longer to cook because I made them bigger....but delish!

These were a big hit at our Easter dinner.  I used smoked cheddar to add an extra little something.  I will be making these again.

Excellent biscuits.

I added more cheese and some rosemary, but otherwise, these were wonderful. My husband devoured them. :)

My 14 yr. old son has made these twice & they are wonderful!  He doesn't put any thyme in them because they would be too much like a stuffing for us. Love them!

I successfully made cut-out biscuits! I really liked this recipe, followed the directions to a T and it worked beautifully. In the past, none of the cut-out biscuits ever turned out so obviously I am very excited that I got it this time. I loved the slightly sweet taste that the sugar gave to the biscuit. Not too sweet, but sweet enough to give it a slightly different taste. Thanks for a great recipe, Laura!

Big hit with my recipe club ladies. I did make some changes. Substituted 1/2 cup of flour for whole wheat and reduced sugar by half.  Didn't have cream of tartar but it didn't keep these biscuits from coming out fluffy. Took the recommendation of another reviewer and grated the butter with a cheese grater. I LOVED this suggestion!! It made it so much easier to blend. Fabulous, quick and Very Easy biscuits. Will make for Thanksgiving!

I have made this recipe three times now, each time, changing it up, first I added garlic powder and onion powder w/ Mexican blend cheese which came out like Red Lobsters FINALLY, I have been trying to perfect that biscuit for YEARS!, next I made them without all spices or cheese to use w/ sausage gravy for bfast and SO good. Last night I used garlic powder and shredded mozz and every time, they are phenomenal! I will use this as a base recipe for the rest of my life, THANK YOU!

By far the best cheddar biscuit recipe on this site!! The cream of tartar really makes it flaky. Don't skip it!! As recommended by others I grated the butter into the dry ingredients and then tossed the shredded cheese into the dry ingredients. Except for those two adjustments to the process I followed the recipe exactly. Looking forward to trying it with different herbs. Yum yum!!

With all the five star ratings, I admit that I was rather disappointed at the results. I made this recipe exactly as written. The biscuits were way too sweet for my liking (they were almost cake-sweet), and there was also too much salt in them, as I got an after-taste of salt when I took a bite. I did eat two biscuits to make a good judgment. One on the day I baked them, and one the next day, microwaved. They were a little better the second day. The real problem with the recipe is that the flavor of the biscuits are just out of balance. They did rise nicely, however, hence the 2 stars. I think that this recipe might have potential, but I haven't decided if I will try it again with some alterations, or just look for another recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, but I'm just not too sure about it.

These did not turn out well at all. i dont know if it was just me or what. They did not rise at all, and had a very dense, not flaky, texture.

I didn't care too much for these. I was looking for something filling to go with soup. Maybe, I am a traditionalist when it comes to biscuits, but the thyme just didn't work for me. I used 1 tsp. dried for the 1 Tblsp. according to information from on-line. It was going to be baked and dry anyhow. I can see the thyme and cheddar combination working in something more dense like a scone. I did use low-fat dairy products, and it seemed to be no problem with the texture. Just tasted like a decent biscuit recipe with cheese and thyme oddly thrown in. I am not sure how to improve it. Maybe, brush a flavored butter on top, like the cheddar bay biscuits, not sure.

So good! I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder and baked these a little longer than what the recipe said. Otherwise delicious. I'm going to serve them with grilled trout and spinach. Thanks, this will now be my go to biscuit recipe.

Instead of thyme, I put in ranch seasoning, and replaced part of the milk with ranch dressing.  OH WOW.  So tasty.  The texture of these biscuits is quite good.  They are light and fluffy, not heavy hard hockey pucks!  Definitely making again!

these were ok- they were not the flaky type I was hoping for, they were on the crumbly side.

Amazing!  Really easy delicious biscuits~  Took no time to put together and 15 minutes to bake.  I followed other suggestions:  grated frozen butter on box grater, used 1 tsp dried thyme, skipped cream of tartar (had none).  The biscuits are fluffy and light.  They will be a hit at a baby shower lunch on Sunday.  Thanks for the recipe!

These biscuits were a great hit with my boss!  I made her borscht and these biscuits and she couldn't get enough.  I added 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of three tablespoons and I also added a variety of herbs instead of just the thyme.  Great recipe Laura.  I also added another 1/2 c of cheese (Monterey Jack Jalapeno).

These are so yummy! I did as someone else suggested and added a little more milk and made drop biscuits. Light & flaky! My 8 year old ate 3 of them!

These were my first attempt at homemade biscuits. I used "4 kinds of Mexican Cheese" as I had no cheddar. They turned out perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe.

I probably should have used a sharper cheddar but otherwise thought this was an excellent, no fuss recipe. Important to serve warm, which really brings out the thyme flavour.

Chewing on one of these flakey deliciousness as I write... Made it to the recipe ingredients but, when I rolled these out I rolled thinner ('bout 1/4"), added some small pats of butter and a few drops of water, folded it over and rolled out again. I did this 3 times with the same process before I cut them out and baked only 9 min. This adds even more flakey buttery layers!

These were perfect! I did not put any thyme in at all, because I didn't have any, but these were still fabulous cheddar biscuit. I will for sure make these again, maybe I will freeze some next time.

A new favorite in our house. Love it with soups! Altered a bit:
1 tsp dried thyme instead of fresh. Added garlic powder and onion powder to taste. Used only 2 tsp sugar per others' suggestions. I don't have the time to roll out and cut with kids running around so I just used my cookie scoop and dropped rounded balls into a muffin tin! Works just as well and it's way less work in my opinion!

These are great! I was looking for a simple biscuit mix to throw together quickly, and these worked! I slightly modified it to what I had available-- for the cheeses I threw together a little bit of cheddar, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan, used regular almond milk instead of milk, and added a 1/3 cup of sour cream, and italian seasoning for the thyme. These are friggin DELICIOUS. Fantastic. Great ratios and proportions, will be using this recipe again!

Just made them 30 minutes ago and they were superbly flaky and yummy. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 Tbsp but next time, I am going to go even lower and put only 1 Tbsp. I added fresh chives instead of thyme, used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and the rest white, and they turned out great.

i wanted a basis to make some green chili cheddar biscuits and this was a winner! i didn't use any sugar and left out the thyme in favor of most of a can of chopped green chilis that i drained and dried off a little with paper towels. delicious!

These came out great. Nice and light. Very versatile. Just change up the cheeses and herbs for different flavors or omit them all together for an all around great biscuit!

Really good biscuits.  I had some fresh thyme that I needed to use and I found this recipe for Father's Day dinner.  I did follow some of the advice from the other reviews.  I didn't use cream of tartar and I used 3 Tbsps of thyme instead of 1.  I also froze my butter for 15 min and then grated it on a box grater.  It made it so much easier to incorporate.

Wow, what flavor!  I made these exactly as stated with the exception of reducing the sugar a tad, adding a bit more milk, and using a little more cheese (personal preference).  I bet these biscuits would be good with some fresh garlic added or some browned sausage incorporated into the dough for more of a complete breakfast biscuit!  This is a very versatile biscuit recipe, and thyme and cheddar are not the only herb and cheese types that can be used.  I can’t wait to eat a biscuit tonight!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These buiscuts were very good.  They were a big hit at my house.  I used a combination of colby and monterey jack cheese for in the buiscuts and added some mozzarela cheese onto the top of them about three minutes before they were done.  I will definitally make these again

I'm going to first preface by saying, I am a horrific baker.  However, I had leftover thyme that was on the cusp of needing to be thrown out so I thought I'd make these.  Following the recipe, I ended up with a dough that I couldn't roll out.  This is not uncommon with me as I can never execute biscuits when rolled out.  I added a bit more milk to the mixture to make drop biscuits, which came out fluffy and were very good.  I would consider adding some garlic powder to the mixture for added flavor, and brushing some garlic butter over the top.

These were just OK to me.  I'm wondering if the sugar is a typo, because they seemed really sweet.  Not the buttery/flaky biscuits I was hoping for.

Made these just as recipe states except the following:
I used bread flour because I didn't have regular all purpose and 
1/2 tsp thyme because I didn't have any fresh and
Colby cheddar cheese shredded mix

These were very light, delicious and flaky. Also very easy to make. These will DEFINITELY be a go to biscuit I will be making a lot.

These were amazing. I did not have fresh thyme so used dried thyme from my garden -  Next time I will put the butter in the freezer a bit before using.

Having lost the recipe (search on this website being erratic and unreliable) I used for cheddar bay biscuits, I had to improvise, using the technical instructions from this recipe and the ingredients from a different one. When my daughter went to make them a day or so after, I gave her this recipe, forgetting to tell her about the modifications I had made. She was disappointed when they were done, because though they turned out correctly, we thought they were too sweet, the thyme was overpowering, and we felt that neither the sugar nor the thyme flattered the cheese. If we could jettison our expectation of the other biscuits, maybe we could have found them palatable. Or if they were paired with the right dish. Or if we left out one of the three: thyme, cheese, or sugar. I appreciate the recipe because the instructions were good, so I used them when I wrote down my own version for safe keeping, instead of trusting that I will ever find the recipe I really liked on this website.

They were tasty, but too sweet, especially when I needed them to be more savory for my meal. Will use this recipe again, just with less sugar as was suggested by other reviewers.

Very easy and a huge hit with the family. I substituted dill weed for thyme just for a different flavour. Love them!

I switched out the cheddar for Havarti and the Tablespoon of Thyme for 2 teaspoons of Fresh Chives (it would have been a bit better with  the full tablespoon).  I did need to add 5 minutes baking time. Next time I am reducing the sugar by 1 tablespoon and am adding a big tbsp of sour cream and decreasing the milk.

We used these for our Easter brunch "Biscuit Bar". I had to increase the 1/2 inch to get them big enough for sandwiches  maybe to 3/4 inch. That was more personal preference. Cooked 5 degree lower and for 10 minutes. All our guests LOVED them! What's even better is I had some leftovers and froze them. Took one out and nuked it then made a quick breakfast sandwich!

Fantastic recipe. Be sure not to overwork the dough or you will get tough biscuits. I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour because I happened to be ahead of schedule for dinner. I served these with a chicken and sweet potato soup. Everyone loved them! The recipe was perfect as written.

It would have been way too sweet with all that sugar.  I cut it back to 3 TSP and it was still a little too sweet.  The cream of tartar was a bit much as well.  I will make these again but cut the sugar to 2 TSP and the Cream of Tartar down to 1/4 tsp.  
I slightly froze my butter and then grated it into the flour and added the milk as needed.

Delish!  Ate 4 of them right out of the oven; so good they didn't even need any butter.  Even though I messed up this recipe they came out great.  I accidentally added nearly a half cup of flour I had set aside for bench flour to my mixing bowl.  I didn't even realize I'd done it until I looked down as I was about to add the milk to the mix and saw my measuring cup of flour was empty.  Yikes!  I just added extra milk, a little over a cup, total, and just went with that.  As others suggested I reduced the sugar to 1 Tbs. and used 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme.  It was just the right amount for me.  Additions I made were 1/4 tsp. dried parsley, 1/8 tsp. each of onion and garlic powders; all added right into the flour mixture.  I also used Lynda's suggestion (the first reviewer) of freezing and grating the butter for easy incorporation into the flour.  What a fantastic idea.  It made everything go so quick and easy, and way much easier on my arthritic hands.  I'm going to use this method for any recipe that requires incorporating butter into flour.  Thank you, Lynda, for such a wonderful tip.  I've always felt cutting out rounds of biscuits and re-rolling was silly so I just patted the dough into a rectangle and used a pizza cutter to cut 12 square biscuits.  Used parchment, and they took 20 minutes to bake--came out  light and fluffy and golden.  I think next time I'll add a little more cheese and about 2 Tbs. of Parmesan since it gives everything such a nice, nutty taste when it bak

I loved these!! These are so easy to make! My guests absolutely loved them! The only thing that was unexpected was these weren't as cheddar-flavored as I thought they would be. But I highly recommend these, and even if you don't like thyme, you can just take it out. Also, I read some reviews before making them and I omitted one tablespoon of sugar.

I added one chopped fresh jalapeño pepper, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Also hand formed biscuits rather than rolling them out. Turned out great and received many compliments.

I used crumbled blue cheese and freshly rendered lard. They were great!. I used them for biscuits and gravy and under worked them a bit for a rich but crumbly texture that soaks up the gravy a bit. I will make them at least once a week for myself and my wife's Arky caregiver. The recipe is very easy to tinker with. Just cut down on the sugar a bit if they are too sweet. Baking powder/soda recipes are not as ingredient sensitive as yeast dough. This is really a GREAT recipe.

These were tasty, served with some chilli. I omitted the sugar, as i wanted more of a savory taste from the thyme and cheddar. I froze my butter and grated it to make it easier to combine. and added in some fresh cracked pepper. Cant wait to make these again with different herb/cheese combinations.

I followed everyone's advice and reduced the sugar to just 2 teaspoons, froze and grated the butter and since I didn't have thyme on hand, swaped out chives. Before baking, I brushed them with garlic butter. These were a HUGE hit with my family. They were so flakey and the taste was out of this world. These have become a new staple at the dinner table. Thanks for the recipe!

this has become my go to biscuit recipe, I have made these biscuits several times and they always turn out perfect. They are so quick and easy to put together with only dirtying one bowl, that's the best part! I don't even bother rolling and cutting, I just put them on the baking sheet like they were cookies. easy and delish.

Delicious!  These will be a regular in our household. I cut the amount of sugar in half based on other reviews, and added about 1/4 c. more cheese.  So easy, so tasty! I only had dried thyme, so I used 1/2 tbsp., but would have enjoyed them with a bit more.  Can't wait to try them with biscuits and gravy. :)

Good texture. Try brushing with garlic butter-much better this way. Didn't roll out. Just hand. Press down.

I love these!  The only modifications I made to this recipe was using dried thyme, as I did not have any fresh on hand, and using a gluten free baking mix (Pamela's) as I do not eat gluten.  While the biscuits did not rise as much as they would have done if I had used regular wheat flour the texture was great and the flavor was superb!  I also used the tip of grating the butter into the flour mixture and I sifted my dry ingredients to help lighten the dough.  Perfection!

Mmmm, very good! I wanted a recipe for cheese biscuits that didn't call for baking mix. Sure seems like a lot of them on Allrecipes do. At least, almost every one I clicked on did. I haven't bought bisquick since someone told me it's loaded with trans fat. Is it? I've never actually looked. Yes, they are a bit sweet but I liked them. Easy enough to cut back the sugar a bit if you don't think you'd like a sweeter biscuit. I didn't have thyme so I used a bit of minced garlic and dill. Served with homemade borscht.

I mix it up and put rosemary in these instead of thyme sometimes... These are my go-to biscuits now -- they only take a few minutes to mix up, making them take about the same amount of time as the "canned" biscuits -- but these taste and smell and LOOK so much better! 
My guy does not like the green herbs in them, so I'm going to try adding some garlic powder to the next batch instead, YUM!! Great base recipe!

I am not quite sure what it is that I did wrong.  The dough was too soft to roll out so needed more flour and it took twice the baking time.  When all was said and done, they were incredibly delicious. I will certainly make these again.  It will be interesting to find out if I end up with the same results or if tonight was just a bad baking night.

Loved these biscuits!  We made 50 servings for a board of trustees meeting and they were very popular.  Easy to bake and delicious.

I used fresh rosemary and loved the taste of these but baking time was 14 minutes, not 10 in my oven.

I took a bite after they came out of the oven and literally stopped in my tracks and said "oh my god these are the best!" Double the cheese for sure.
