We loved this!  Here's my changes- I didn't add the onion salt, I used freeze dried chives, and I used frozen corn. I didn't have time to put this in the oven so I put the butter & corn in a small pot until the corn thawed.   Then I added the cream cheese, chives, and s&p to taste.  We loved it! I think it would have been even better with fresh chives so I look forward to making it again but I'll stick to my stovetop version.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious!  Even my husband (who doesn't usually care for corn) enjoyed it.  Loved the addition of fresh chives... gave great flavor.  I feared the onion salt would make the dish too salty so I used onion powder instead (and did not need to add any salt at all).  I did feel that the ratio of cream cheese to corn was a bit much so I increased the amount of corn.  That's just a personal preference, though.  Oh, and I did use frozen vice canned corn.  Again, just a personal preference - didn't change the taste or consistency of the dish at all.  Making this last night was a "trial run" since I hoped to be taking this to a Thanksgiving dinner.  I was so pleased with the result that I will *definitely* be making this for Thanksgiving!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, PPERRY0501.

Let's be honest I could have eaten the whole thing by myself it is that good. And to make it easier I used the cream cheese with chives already in it. Thank you for the recipe.

So amazing!  I highly recommend this with your Thanksgiving or Christmas or Easter dinner.  Or anytime you aren't worried about calories really.  I do recommend regular cream cheese.  I made it with 1/3 fat cream cheese once and it was very crumbly.

I omitted the green onions and added green chilies and pimentos and it was a huge hit!

I ate several servings of this but I don't know that I'd make it again.  I like other creamed corn recipes on here better.  Easy enough to make though.

This wasn't really good for us.  It was way too salty.
