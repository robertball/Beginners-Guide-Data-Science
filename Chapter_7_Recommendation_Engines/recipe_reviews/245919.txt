Someone gave me a box of corn muffin mix (you know the one) and I had to find ways to use it. This turned out to be a good answer. The sweetness of the corn muffin mix was offset by the jalapenos. The smoked sausage, another ingredient I rarely use, went well with the beans and tomatoes. Don't scrimp on the spices. I would add then a bit earlier than is called for in the recipe so they mix well with all the rest.

I thought this recipe was pretty good but my husband thought it was just ok. It was very quick and easy to make. The only change I made was swapping pinto beans for the black beans. It  JUST fits in a 10" skillet and a little started to bubble over into the oven, so I'd suggest using a 12" oven proof skillet instead of a 10".

i think it was a mistake to mix the cheese in, It disappeared into the sauce.  The whole recipe needed more vegetables, so the next day i had it as a side instead of the main course.
It would be better to sprinkle the cheese on top of the corn bread or leave it out; as there is plenty of protein from the sausage.

Made some changes since the BF is vegetarian.  Substituted the sausage for 1 cup of cooked lentils.  Kept everything else as listed in the original recipe.  Delicious!!!

Doubled the sausage, one "regular" smoked the other all-beef smoked sausage. Great weeknight meal for the family that takes little effort and little time.

Had to make numerous substitutions (used ground beef, didnt have jalepenos so used green peppers in the cornbread and red peppers in the stew, and didnt have a cast iron skillet so placed in a rectangle baking pan)  BUT turned out great!!  Will definitely make again.

I used pinto beans instead of black beans and a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of plain. I also added some red pepper flakes to the cornbread topping. It's an ok dish and I will make it again. However, next time I will definitely cut the cumin and chili powder in half. They were a bit overpowering. I will also try adding a teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder. Oh, I also doubled the smoked sausage and baked it in a 12 cast iron skillet (which was the perfect size).

I really liked this!   My husband thought it was just ok.   
The only changes I made was... I didn't have a pan that was oven proof so I transferred it to a glass
Dish.      I also used pinto beans instead of black beans because I can't stand black beans.   Other than that I made this as directed.  

I will def make again!
