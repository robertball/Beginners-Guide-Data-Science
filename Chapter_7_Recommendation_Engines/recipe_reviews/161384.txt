The flavour is good, but whoa nelly, the pasta pushes the soup over the edge (in terms of heartiness)! I would use less pasta or perhaps none at all. I also threw in some chopped cilantro and a few tbsp of cooked lentils that I had left over from another dish.

Delicious, esp. with the fresh herbs.  Instead of the pasta I added cooked quinoa for a little extra protein and whole grain nutrition - excellent.

This is a delicious soup that's comforting on a chilly night and super easy to prepare. I used leftover T-giving turkey, veg broth (it's what I always have on hand), and leftover pumpkin puree instead of tomato paste (I thought it would go better with the rosemary and sage). I also omitted the pasta. The only thing I'd change in the future is to add more kale. This will be my go-to turkey soup recipe during the holidays!

Great soup. I decided to put in a cup of dry quinoa instead of using pasta, and simmered until the quinoa is done. This made it nice and thick and stewy. I also used a lot of extra garlic (whole cloves) and hot sauce because I just do that with everything.

This was very good and easy to make. The one thing I will change is to make only 6 to 8 ounces of pasta; 16 ounces of pasta is WAAAY too much for this recipe!

I really liked the ingredients. Followed the best I could with what I had on hand. Used homemade chicken broth which changed the flavor quite a bit. Next time I think I'd prefer white beans instead of the garbanzo. The kind I used had a really rough unappealing texture.

I tried out several soup recipes this winter and this one quickly became my favorite.  It's hearty and flavorful...perfect on a cold day with some crusty warm bread.  I subbed the 3/4 water with more chicken broth.  I also cooked the pasta separate and added in just before serving.  If you have leftovers you'll probably want to keep the pasta entirely separate so you don't have that mushiness a day or so later.  Thanks Liana for sharing.  It will be first on my list to make next winter.

Very hearty and tasty. Made this after learning that Kale holds it's texture in soups and stews, and it did. I used ground buffalo rather than turkey because I had some in the freezer, but I'll be making it again today with turkey. Yum!

This was great!  Only change I made was to omit the 3/4 cup water (I liked the strong tomato taste from the paste mixed only with the broth).  Will definitely make again!

My husband and kids loved this soup. I used fresh spinach instead of kale. I added the spinach about 5 min. before serving.

This is a delicious healthy dinner option!  With the meat and beans, it's really filling.  My husband ate it all up and didn't complain about not having enough food like he often does with soups.  Will definitely make again!

I thought this was very good!
Had to make a few changes because of reviews and what I had on hand.
I used 1 1/2 lbs. ground turkey and did 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3 (big garlic fans here)
I also used 1 tsp. dried sage and 2 tsp. dried rosemary (no fresh on hand), 32 oz. chicken broth (no water), 6 oz. tomato paste, and 4 cups (packed) kale.
I wanted this to be a lot thicker than a soup which is why I did no water and a little less broth.
I did cover it while it was simmering so I wouldn't lose as much liquid.
I chose not to make it with noodles but would probably serve it with brown rice or quinoa next time.
I can't wait to try this with fresh herbs!

Nice change for a soup. I used hot italian pork sausage instead of turkey because that is what I had. I just threw the pasta into the soup and cooked it all together until the pasta was finished. Turned out great. It was spicy due to the hot sausage.

This is a wonderful, delicious, healthy, and easy to make soup. I haven't tasted anything like it before...both the 11 year old and the 50 year old boys loved it. I didn't have beans (a usual staple here) and it was fine. I used gluten free pasta al dente. Adding extra kale is good! Fresh herb made the flavor sing. My sage and rosemary are overwintering on the south side of my house in NJ. Yummy.

Don't understand why my experience was so far short of the rave reviews this recipe got.  I am pretty good at following a recipe.  I give it three stars based on good healthy ingredients.

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was delicious. Since the pasta is added at serving you can use as much or little as you like. I have tried it both with and without the pasta. It was wonderful both ways.  This can also be finished in the crock pot (and makes the house smell great as you walk in the door.) Do most of step two,  then dump everything into the slow cooker for a few hours. Cook your pasta just before serving – or omit it entirely. We had just one little issue with it. How to put this delicately?….  If you are the sensitive type you might want to try a little beano® before….

My family does not like mushy pasta.  I substituted microwaved barley instead.  I find that barley will stand up to hot liquids better and absorb some of the flavor.  It was a hit and we ended up having seconds and forgoing the rest of the planed dinner for the next night.  Good Job!

This soup was so delicious and easy to prepare. Just 2 minor changes ... used Romano beans instead of Garbanzo's and doubled the chicken stock. Ended up adding a cup or water to get more broth just before serving (pasta and beans thickened it a bit). Will definitely be making this again!

Very interesting.  I had no pasta on hand so I used brown rice.  I also had no garbanzo beans but substituted with white beans.  Despite substitutions I really enjoyed this soup.  I used only 1 tbsp of each spice but found it too "sagy" for my taste but still good enough to finish off.  Will definitely make again but with less sage.  I also loved the addition of kale, which is packed with nutrients.

I heavily edited this soup to make it both vegetarian and cream based. I used half the amount of noodles and 3/4 of the garbanzo beans amount per others' suggestions. I also used a smashed up fresh tomato instead of tomato sauce, substituted fresh cilantro for the other spices and added 1/2 cup of half and half. I topped it with chile pepper flakes and cubes of pepper jack cheese. Was delicious!

I was a little worried about all the ingredients in this soup.  But it really does mingle tastes well.  I followed the recipe almost to a T. The only thing I did different was to make 1/2 the pasta called for, cooked according to box and added to the soup just before serving.  My family really enjoyed it as well.  Plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  Thanks!!!

It was very good. I like to make things just as recipe states but opted out of the pasta this time but added 1/2 cup of Farro as I didn't have any quinoa. I also had to add dried herbs as our store close by is very pricey for fresh ones so used 1 tsp of the Rosemary and sage and it was very tasty.

I have made this many times and enjoy it more and more.  I don't put the pasta in because I really don't like pasta in soup.  I have it on the stove right now and the house smells wonderful.  This time I am using a whole turkey breast as well and the ground turkey.  I have used purple and green kale in this batch.  Almost makes going to work tomorrow something to look forward to because this will be in my lunch box! :)

So great! My mom is a health nut so I made this for her for Mother's Day and she loved it! She is a hard woman to please as well, so I consider this a great success. Even my husband liked it and he's anti-health nut. Definitely making it again.

I used all chicken broth. I added 1/2 cup of orzo to soup. I found 2T. of rosemary to be way too much and I like rosemary. I also used spinach instead of kale. No kale in grocery store . I will not be making this soup again. SJS9

This was delicious!   I didn't change a thing.   Everybody loved it.   Using fresh herbs really made the difference.  I will definitely make this again.

I made some modifications using what I had on hands. The main ingredients: turkey, beans (I used chili beans though) and kale were present. I think the recipe is very forgiving and as long as you have the three mentioned above and tomato paste it should be a winner. I really like kale in this soup.

This recipe is awesome. My husband is partial to sausage so we did half turkey/half sausage. We left out the water and noodles. Also not a fan of kale so we substituted swiss chard in its place. So good we added it to the recipe box already and his sister wants the recipe.

I liked this. It was quite different than what I'm used to. (My grandfather is full-blood Portuguese and he always made this for me growing up). His had no meat or pasta.   It tastes enough like it that it brought back the good memories I had hoped.

This soup was fantastic.  I really loved it.  I love kale, so I've been trying to find good recipes for it.  I was a little concerned about ground turkey, but it was great.  The only differences I made was I used no pasta.  I added garlic salt to the meat, more garlic than called for, and about 10 cups of kale.  I just finished off my second big bowl and I will be making this all the time now.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very good! Here are the few changes I made - used 1 C. of dry gluten free elbow pasta, used dry herbs (2 t. each of sage and rosemary) as I didn't have fresh on hand, used 32 oz. of chicken broth and added about 1 C. of water, used about 4 C. of kale (didn't measure!). I used leftover T-day turkey instead of ground turkey - approximately 3+ cups.  I saved this and will make it again!

I changed this up. I had chicken thighs and cooked them in the stock pot. I took them out and deglazed the pot with some sherry and then added the onions and started the recipe from there. I also added quadruple the amount of kale and a can of diced tomatoes. I also added one can of white beans (cannellini) in addition to the chick peas. I omitted the pasta altogether and didn't miss it!I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand but dried Italian seasonings worked great!!!

I will definitely make this meal again. I used chicken instead of turkey and I added some chopped carrots. My children loved it. They are picky eaters and usually I have to hide the veggies. They were looking at it like they didn't want to eat it. But when the oldest took the first bite.....that's all it took. They even asked me for seconds. This meal is a winner and I will prepare it again.

I made the recipe as written with the fresh herbs and it was delicious.  I like to read the reviews and it seems as if a lot of people thought the pasta was to be added to the soup while cooking.  The contributor suggested putting the cooked pasta in the bottom of each serving bowl and ladling the hot soup over the top.  That way you can have your pasta al dente and leftovers will not be soggy. Also individuals can adjust the amount according to their palates.  Great recipe!

CLEAN EATING SOUP, right here! Loved this! This soup packs a pretty nutritious punch and my husband (of all people) loved it. As always and with any recipe, I do my best with what I have on hand. By choice we didn't add the noodles (but in the future will add extra beans instead) and didn't add the tomato paste. Other wise everything else was pretty spot on. Super yummy and a keeper recipe!

Took the pasta note under advisement and omitted it from recipe.  Added half of a Bell pepper and Tablespoon of Spicy Brown Mustard, felt it needed a slight tang to it, mustard goes so well when cooking ground turkey. Enjoy!

This recipe is a Keeper.  I subbed some frozen cooked turkey breast from my freezer & cut back on the pasta - but those were the only changes made.  
My compliments to the creator! :)

Excellent recipe, tastes great. Fortunately my local grocery had fresh sage and rosemary. I used brown rice instead of pasta, and only about a cup per serving.

I will make this again; it was good. Like others suggested, I used less pasta (like 8oz maybe?). I added some carrots that I needed to use up to the sauté mixture of onions and garlic. Then browned the turkey with it. Didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried, which was fine. I added more garlic than called for and threw in some thyme, too. I think next time I will add some frozen butternut squash chunks; I think that would really add to the taste. I will also cut back on the pasta more, maybe not even add it (it doesn't need the added bulk, IMO). Definitely a great healthy and hearty winter soup!

This is a delicious soup!  Even my husband enjoyed it and he usually doesn't like beans in his soup.  I altered it somewhat by substituting the ground turkey with chopped chicken left over from a take out rotisserie chicken added in the last few minutes with the kale.

Very filling for a soup. Realized too late that I was out of sage; subbed about 1 tsp each dried parsley & dried thyme. Cooked the pasta in the soup and added about 2 cups additional broth to make up for liquid absorbed. Leftovers will have soggy pasta but I'm sure they'll still taste wonderful. :)

I made this soup with black beans in place of the garbanzo beans and served it over brown rice instead of noodles. This is a very versatile recipe and would work great with types of beans.

Not bad.  I didn't have ground turkey but it was still okay.  I also used cheese tortellini pasta and left out one can of broth so it would be thicker.  I like it, but bf wasn't so sure.  I'm thinking it's maybe the sage he didn't like so much.  He did eat most of his bowl, though, and other than that I think it's a pretty decent soup.  As other reviewers mentioned, very hearty.  I was full with just about a cup of soup and a small piece of bread.  thanks for the recipe!

This is VERY similar to a Sonoma Diet recipe. The original recipe called for turkey Italian sausage instead of ground turkey,  only 3/4 cup of pasta, and didn't include kale. It also calls for the pasta to be added for the last 11 minutes of cooking. Made that way, it's a delicious soup. I think the kale is an excellent addition and will make it with that from now on.

This is a tasty soup...very hearty. We like a little bit of spice...so I added a little extra garlic and I added about a 1TB of Cajun Seasoning to the pot. 
I love this recipe.

This is a perfect comfort soup.  I added more of the following: garlic (we loooove garlic), kale, and chicken broth (I like a lot of broth).  I also did not drain the beans (used cannellini) because I like the extra boost the liquid gives for flavor.  I always make my pasta on the side so as not to lose the great broth.  I used ditalini pasta.  I also do not use salt, so I used salt-free seasoning mix and Rienzi beans and very low sodium broth.  It came out great - lots of flavor.  I will make this soup many times in the future.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is very adaptable for special diets.

Fantastic soup. I like that the author, Liana, suggests to customize it to suit your taste. And I did slightly. I added two cans of Garbanzo beans, no tomato paste but instead used Rotel with green chilies. A little extra Rosemary.
We used whole wheat medium shells so it would cradle the soup more so than just what was in the spoon, Delicious!

Awesome soup. I changed a few things to suit my taste. I added great northern beans instead of garbanzo beans. I don't like rosemary so I didn't add that. I also added a few celery stalks and a can of stewed tomatoes with garlic and basil instead of tomato paste.I made a pan of cornbread to have with the soup. My husband and I really enjoyed it.

This has become my favorite soup. It's so hearty and the fresh herbs give it amazing flavor! I used Ditalini "little thimbles" pasta and Better than Bullion chicken stock. It's super easy to make and always turns out well. All teenage daughter even asks me to make it. It's a regular in our house.

Love this! Great way to use up ground turkey soon to go bad. My husband accidentally put in white beans instead of garbanzo beans but it still tasted great. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

Excellent soup! Love the idea of fresh rosemary in this dish. Made a few changes. Definitely half the pasta. Way too much! Using leaner ground white turkey brings the total fat content down to 2 gm per serving. Used all broth (I actually used the liquid from the pasta and beans and added veggie boullion.) Needs at least 3 more cups and the entire (6oz.) can of tomato paste if you want soup. For more flavor added 1/2 tsp. of savory, a little less than 1/2 tsp. garlic pepper instead of black pepper and little crushed red pepper, maybe about 1/2 tsp. for a little heat. Wonderful flavor. Kids devoured it!
