I made this one time..so far... served it at a party and it was the hit of the party, everyone wanted the recipe, I highly recommend this cheese ball, it is not your typical " Hickory Farms Cheese Ball"
I will make it again,  and I am not sharing the recipe!

LOVE this recipe. Be careful you won't be able to stop eating it. This is always an appetizer at our family gatherings and it's the first thing gone. Great with any butter cracker. I recommend doubling the recipe or it will be gone too fast! It also saves well for a day or two in the fridge covered.

This was great, as is! It would have been a little too much for me to eat so I did cut the recipe in half and rolled it in a log instead of a ball. Only because the ball would have been too small. I make a ham shoulder frequently and this is a great way to use some leftovers.  I chopped the ham shoulder for my ham. This would make a nice gift along with a box of quality crackers around the holidays.

y haven't tried it, but would like to.  It doesn't say what kind od ham slices.  Is it ham steak sandwiches, or like the packages with the cold cuts?  Please advise.  Thank you.

The taste was great, but make sure either the cream cheese isn't completely room temperature when you make it, or let it rest in the fridge after mixing all the ingredients because it won't form into a ball. I realize this seems obvious but it wasn't to me until I had 10 minutes until guests arrived and I had a giant blob

Instead of pecans I added sour cream and fine Mexican cheese. Was a big hit.
