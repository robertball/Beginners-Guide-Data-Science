I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  It is light and refreshing.  A few changes I made: I've made it both with couscous and with orzo.  Since the orzo was a thicker, larger substance than the couscous, it worked better with the cucumber.  I also used 2 whole cucumbers which was NOT too much.  I made it recently as a main dish, and just added sliced chicken breast (grilled on the George Forman with lemon pepper seasoning - EASY!)... it was just right.  Thanks for submitting this recipe, it's one of my favorites!

Quite nice, couscous soaks up the flavour.  Try adding some extra vinaigrette just before serving.  You may want a lower grain-to-veggie ratio, and if so toss in some chopped tomatoes and sliced black olives.  This goes great and can make a greek sort of salad.

My new absolute favorite!  The seasonings and lemon are perfect together, and the cucumber was just made for it. Could easily add tomatoes, bell peppers, or other crunchy-type veggies but it's perfect just as-is.  I'd give it more than five stars if I could. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used the advice of others and added less lemon juice, and I also added some fat-free plain yogurt and chopped mint for a more mediterranean flavor... the couscous soaked up the liquids well and it was tasty for days!

I think it needs a little more flavor. Next time I would add some minced garlic and more spices.

This is one of my husband's new favorite recipes. Light and healthy, but filling. We usually put the mixture in a wrap or pita to eat it.

This is a good cold salad that's easy enough to make.  I would recommend cutting back on the water a bit, though, so the herbs and spices are a little more prevalent.

I used this as a base to try to copy my favorite salad from a specialty store. I give this 5 stars based on changes I made. I used acini di pepe pasta instead of couscous, added 1/2 cup chopped red pepper, 1/2 cup chopped white onion and 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar.  I also added a dash of garlic powder and omitted green oinons, parsley and lettuce. Overall result was delicious!

We enjoyed this salad.  It was something different from the norm. I used bottled lemon juice because that was what I had.  Next time I will make a point to use real lemons. Very refreshing.

My go-to recipe for summer barbecues! Takes minutes to throw together. FYI - the juice of 2 medium-sized lemons equals about 1/2 cup. It's not necessary to seed the cucumbers. Add a little fresh mint for a different flavor. I like to add some halved cherry tomatoes for a pop of color and a nicer presentation.

Made this tonight.  I followed some other reviews and added some diced red pepper, sun dried tomatoes and feta.  It was a pretty good salad.  I think I might like it better with orzo.  Thanks KRISTAB.

WAY too much lemon juice. I also added fresh garlic and flip flopped the pepper/salt amounts. It's a good salad but the dressing definitely needs work. I will try this again but play around with it a bit. It has potential.

This is an excellent summer salad! Save the couscous to add last, after all the other ingredients have been mixed together in the bowl. Then you can add it gradually until you reach the couscous to cucumber ratio that suits you. I didn't quite use it all.

I really enjoy this recipe and it's super easy to make. However, I end up adding a lot more lemon juice and spices to really pull in the flavor since the couscous is so bland. have on hand extra lemon juice, green onions, and parsley. I like this when it has more of a zing to it than called for in the original recipe.

I only rate this 4 stars because I made it better by adding feta cheese, and using quinoa instead of couscous for a gluten-free version (I cook the quinoa in a watered-down veggie broth for a bit of flavor).  I didn't have basil on hand, so used a couple of leaves of mint instead with the parsley, and I added a bit of chopped fresh tomato.  This is a great gluten-free lunch to have a couple of days in a row after serving with grilled chicken for dinner!  Love it!  In fact, I'm making it right now to take to a potluck dinner.

I loved this recipe. It was so light and very fresh tasting. My fiance was pleasantly surprised as well. I double the cucumber (2 chopped seeded cucumbers is a good amount), and I used Far East Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil couscous for some added flavor. I served this salad w/ some chicken breasts I grilled w/ lemon pepper seasoning. They went together very well! The only thing that's a pain was chopping all of the fresh ingredients. It took me much more than the indicated prep time, but it was worth it!

I found this to be a great 'base' recipe.  I like the amount of lemon juice, olive oil, etc.  I did make a few alterations...instead of couscous, I used a small pasta (I like the texture better).  I cut out the parsley and lettuce and added sliced black olives and hearts of palm.  The hearts of palm give it such a great kick of flavor!  This has become a favorite summer salad for my family!

Fabulous!  I made a few changes based on what was available: I used red onion instead of green and fresh mint instead of parsley (which was fantastic).  I also added a chopped and seeded tomato.  I highly recommend serving this with salmon.  My husband initially complained the couscous was too citrus-y but once he "layered" it with the salmon, thought it was to die for.  Next time I will plate this with the couscous in the middle of the plate with the salmon fillet directly on top.  The two should be eaten together, on the same forkful, as it is an AMAZING flavor combination!

Yum! I've been looking for a good summer salad. This one is light and very fresh tasting. I believe I will mess around with the ratios next time to make it a little bit more green (ie more cucumber, basil, parsley) and maybe add a little garlic. I probably didn't add as much lemon juice as the recipe calls for (sometimes I don't measure, just go on taste) but if you are concerned, start with half a lemon and if you need more, add it at the end. I followed the directions on making the couscous and it turned out perfect! just make sure to fluff it with a fork  when its done.

I scaled this to 2 servings to go with chicken kabobs. These are VERY generous servings. I made the dressing cutting back the lemon per previous reviews, added approx twice the green onion into the dressing so the lemon and salt could mellow them a little and using minimum salt. Made the couscous adding the rest of the lemon juice to the cooking water and since I had no fresh herbs I added dry to the cooking water. As soon as the couscous was cooked I poured on the dressing and stirred it in well, set aside to cool. Used an English cucumber, diced about 1/2" dice. When the couscous was cool, I added the cucumber and returned to the refrigerator for about 2-3 hours. I did need to add salt & pepper on the plate but by not adding the full amount in the dressing hoped to not end up with a watery salad and so far it's worked. Now I plan to add tomato and black olives and a bit of balsamic dressing to serve with sirloin kabobs or steak. All in all a very good recipe with endless possibilities. Very refreshing. Thanks for the post.

I enjoyed this as a light summertime salad.  I have made the following changes to try

I have used wheatberries along with the couscous to give an extra nutty texture.  So I halved the couscous and made up the difference with the wheatberries 

I have used lime juice instead of lemon juice
I have used lemon basil instead of regular basil
I have used cilantro instead of parsley

Loved this! There are all sorts of things you can do. I used 2 cucumbers, a red pepper. 2 small tomatoes and a little more onion. Other veggie ideas would be squash or zuchini. maybe mushrooms, artichokes. Feta and grilled chicken breast would be another great addition. Have extra dressing available when you serve it - on the side.

Awesome!  Never made couscous salad before and it was so yummy!  I did use less lemon juice as suggested and not a lot of pepper so the kids will be more willing to eat it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great for a picnic because there's no salad dressing to spoil. I use two cucumbers and added cherry tomatoes. I like it because I grow the herbs and vegetables in my garden.

This salad was delicious. The lemon and herbs really shine through and make this salad light and perfect for spring. I added 4 oz. of basil, sundried tomato, and kalamata olive flavored feta cheese and that made the salad perfect. You won't be disappointed if you try this

We added a lot more of the green stuff to this and less couscous to make it more of a salad.  It was just a bit bland so we added more olive oil and lime juice, also a little bit of red wine vinegar and crushed garlic.

Thank you very much for this recipe. I used green onions/tops and parsley from my garden, seeded tomatoes and cucumbers. I used lots of veggies. Fresh is best! Play with your favorite veggie additions and you'll love it!

Love this!  Nice and light, good side to a basic fish.  I've made it a few time, and do add a fair amount of garlic and have also tried with minced onion when I didn't have the green onion available, which also worked fine.

This is honestly the first time I've been disappointed in an allrecipes.com recipe.  It was bland, the texture was mushy, and I don't think I can ever eat a cucumber again; it more or less was eating straight cucumbers with couscous. The recipe went straight in the trash. :(

This salad had very good flavor. The lemon and the basil went very well together. The only complaint I have is my couscous stuck together after I added the water. I would recommend breaking the couscous up with your hands before putting it in the salad because it is hard to stir when clumpy.

It's very refreshing.  I did it with quinoa due to a gluten issue.  I was a little confused by the picture, however, as it has red in it.  I'm sure, if you wanted to add meat, you could add some chicken cubes and that would be yummy too.

Loved this recipe, however I made a couple of changes. Instead of the green onion, I used a medium sized red onion. I replaced the lemon juice with apple cider vinegar which added a tart sweetness and switched out the basil with cilantro and that gave the flavor an unexpected brightness...my guys loved it!! -_- Charlie Baltimore

Like others it was a little bland so I added some garlic salt, feta, & cherry tomatoes. I'm not big on onions so I'll only put 1/4 c next time. Simple, tastey, & healthy!

Yum! Made it and let it chill in the fridge all night and ate it for lunch at work the next day. Really refreshing, healthy, and filling! I added some chopped red pepper and celery for some extra crunch and some feta cheese I had in the fridge. Also added a bit of plain yogurt and lots of chopped mint for some Turkish flavor :) Definitely making again, thanks!

I tried it the way the recipe read first and it was very bland. So the next time I tried it by combining another recipe here for couscous salad plus my own ideas. I added juice of half a lime and only juiced one lemon. I then whisked in olive oil (more than stated here) and white balsamic vinegar. Then I added just a tiny bit of fine chopped red onion, a bit of fresh cilantro and a bit of fresh mint. Sliced some cherry tomatoes with 3 english cukes and it was pretty darn good! Oh, and I toasted the couscous with olive oil and chopped fresh garlic first before cooking in chicken broth! Topped it with Feta.

Very easy, VERY good, and extremely refreshing.  Served this with a savory chicken dish and it complemented the flavors wonderfully.  I plan on adding different things to it for different occasions.  I will add chicken to make this a main dish like another reviewer.  

My family loved it, and it is now in my recipe box for MUCH future use!

This was incredible!  I was nervous about the amount of lemon, but honestly it was so perfect!  Light, fresh, flavor with a bit of crunch.  MMMMMMMMM!

I made this for a dinner with friends and everyone LOVED it! It was a huge hit. My only suggestion is that you really have to let it sit for a while so that the flavours have the time to blend. Overall though, it was a success!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe in every way; easy to prepare and scrumptious!  This recipe can be modified very easily if you want to change it up a little.  I followed another reveiwer's suggestion and used one box of Near East couscous but instead of plain I used toasted pine nut and Athenos crumbled feta cheese with basil and tomato. I also used grape tomatoes and just cut them in half.

First, made it as is and found there was too much lemon and not enough vegetables. Second go around I made these changes: Cut lemon juice to 1/3cup and made up the difference in liquid with Olive Oil. Then I added some celery and tomatoes (would also be a great chance to use some zucchini!). The ratio of veggies to couscous was MUCH better and the lemon was a compliment instead of overpowering. I served this with grilled chicken which everyone loved but it would also go great with some grilled salmon. With the changes, it makes a good, refreshing summer dish.

This is awesome! I have been making a version of this that includes mushrooms, grape tomatoes and thinly sliced cooked top sirloin steak with a little red wine vin. dressing added... it is simple and very yummy and works with just about any protein source.

This was a good zesty salad, but a little dry after sitting in the fridge for a few hours. Needs more liquid next time.

What a fresh taste!  I was worried as I didn't wait the hour for the mixture to blend as my time was short and I was hungry.  I was expecting it to be bland (after reading other reviews).  Instead, it went BANG when it tasted it.  My first impression was lemon, then I tasted the basil and parsley.  I can't wait to finish it.  

I halved the recipe and used half a vegetable boullion cube to season the couscous.  I used dried basil as I didn't have any fresh.  I used a tiny piece of red spanish onion as I don't like a strong onion taste and didn't have any green.  The red onion added some colour to the predominantly green salad.  Other than that, I kept to the recipe.  What a great way to use up cucumber.  I would definitely make this again.

Light and refreshing! I scaled this recipe in half and had it for my lunch. I added a tomato and would probably try adding peas, corn or even cheese pieces next time. Its a very versatile recipe and very tasty. I didn't use green onions as I didn't have any but used a little piece of regular onion chopped up finely as well as a squirt of Braggs (natural soy sauce). 
Thanks for sharing!

Substituted fresh mint instead of parsley and basil, added orange pepper, cherry tomatoes, feta, topped with grilled chicken for protein. Added rice wine vinegar as the lemon was faint. Very filling, fresh tasting!

Loved the recipe, added just tomatoes and a bit of green onions for garnish. Otherwise it was great. A nice cooling element on the plate for a spicier meal.

This was a good recipe to take onto my boat in the summer since it doesn't have mayo and we only have a small frig (no cooktop) for food.

I added some grilled chicken breasts to make it a main dish.

This would've gotten 5 stars if I could've gotten my toddler to eat it, but both my husband & I really enjoyed it. I added about a tbsp more of olive oil & used a sweet onion instead of green cause that's what I had in my fridge. Next time I will add more cucumber.

Delicious. I added 2 diced tomatoes, about 2T crumbled feta, 1t garlic powder, and 2 English cucumbers (the long skinny ones without seeds). I used the fresh basil, but did not have access to parsley (well, I could get curly but I'd don't like to use that one in recipes. . .I prefer flat leaf). I used 2 lemons, but still didn't have enough juice so I added 1/2 of a lime. My husband and I love it. We'll see what the kids think tonight--that's the true test of a recipe's success in our home!

This salad was great!  I added tomato, feta, and pine nuts to mine and skipped the lettuce.  Next time I think I'll add fresh spinach too.  You can be very creative and add whatever you like but the basic recipe is great!

Delicious salad, very easy.  Excellent veggie to cous cous ratio. So fast, and simple to make, and very healthy. I gave it 4/5 only because I felt like it needed some extras, like feta cheese, and some more veggie variety, like peppers. Very good as is, but perfect 5 with some minor tweaks.

Delicious!! The only changes I made were to add some garlic (which I blended with the lemon juice and olive oil to make a dressing) and some Mediterranean herb-flavored feta cheese. It was sooo good! I was skeptical that these flavors would all work together but I was very pleasantly surprised. I served this with Sean's Falafel and Cucumber Sauce from this site and it made a great, healthy, flavorful meal. I will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty, we served it with Kibbeh (also got the recipe from allrecipes) and the flavors blended so well together.  I only had dried herbs so I added them and part of the lemon juice to the cooking water for the couscous.  I also used almost a whole english cucumber (didn't need to seed it) and substituted red onion for some color and added about a cup of frozen sweet corn kernals (I'd add even more next time, we all thought the corn added a lot to the recipe).  I think this would be great with fresh tomatoes also.  Thanks for the recipe, I have a feeling it's one we'll use often!

Made the recipe as written and it was pretty darn good.  Simple to make, nice fresh taste.  I would sprinkle a little extra lemon juice on it before eating just to freshen it, but it kept well in the fridge for a couple of days.  Could easily be a five star by adding some other flavors...be creative!

Very good and easy! I used less lemon juice and added in chopped celery, petite diced tomatoes(rinsed), and a can of sliced black olives. This recipe is a winner!

a couple of years ago, I sent in a recipe for couscous royale, which was never published. This was an algerian lamb and couscous stew.  The cous cous salad here is basically a "tabouleh", apart from the following important ingredients... .. finely chopped spring onions chopped mint chick peas (optional - small amount of freshly chopped coriander)  otherwise, it's not bad as a fair copy of a classic North- African Dish.

I am giving this five stars even though I changed recipe a little.  I didn't have couscous on hand so I used quinoa and it was great.  Also, I used part lemon juice and part redwine vinegar with a dash of sugar in the dressing.  I also followed another suggestion to use mint instead of parsley.  Would make for family again or a get together.

Great recipe.  I left out the lettuce, but added in half a jar of finely chopped sun dried tomatoes and used the oil from the tomatoes in lieu of the olive oil - it gave the recipe a nice zing.

This was the first time I tried couscous and I thought this recipe was very good.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. (fresh would probably be much better.  I would use less green onions next time.  I also added plum tomatoes.

Pretty good, but I added more cukes & less pasta (I used orzo since that's what I had on hand.  )  Adding some feta cheese at the end added some nice flavor.

This is a pretty good basis but not exactly the Lebanese flavor I was expecting.  I'd reduce the lemon juice and add some more spices next time.  Dill maybe?  I still enjoyed it nonetheless.
