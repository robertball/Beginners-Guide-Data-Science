I've made this dozens of times and always to many rave reviews. I have substituted dried rosemary for the sesame seeds and added a bit of coarse salt on top. Using a pasta machine makes rolling the dough very thin much easier.

Just like crackers.  They do need to be rolled out very thin and even.  I sprinkled salt on one batch, sesame on another and pepper on the last.  They were all great.  I drew lines with a knife where I wanted the giant 'cracker' to break after being baked and it worked great.

When women of my Lutheran Church were having trouble finding unleavened bread for communion, I searched and found this recipe.  I baked this unleavened flatbread for Easter Sunday's communion services.  It was well received by the congregation and the pastor.  Had a little trouble keeping my husband from eating it all before taking it to church. Thank you Sally for sharing this recipe.  I have been asked to make it again and it is certainly easy. (I did leave off the sesame seeds for this purpose) I will use it with the sesame seeds for our snacks at home.

Versatile and very easy to make.  I make this bread often.  I like to add extra sunflower seeds to the mix.  This recipes makes a great thin crispy crust for mini pizzas.  Bake them almost till golden, put desired toppings, and bake again until cheese is bubbly.  Thanks!

Super easy. I did find, however, that my dough was too wet to work with, so I had to add more flour, and it worked just dandily. I'm in the process of making it again, and I think I'll just use less liquid. It does turn out much like a cracker (great for fruit salsa or yogurt cheese), but if you want a softer bread, bake for less time. Also, I tried topping the two of the bread each with cayenne, parmesean, crushed garlic, and sesame seeds (like it says), and I also made a plain batch. All of them are very nice, especially the parmesean (it  gets all wonderfully golden and crunchy). The plain one was kind of bland, but still alright. This recipe goes in my recipe box.

My family loves this recipe.  Have made it twice in the past week, with variations of toppings.  Cinnamon/sugar is a current favorite.  Fun for kids to help make, since it's so easy and they can really get their hands into it.

...I was so glad to find this recipe!  My girlfriend and I used to dine at a restaurant in Scottsdale that served lavosh.  They would top it with lots of melted cheese, green chilies, diced tomatoes and avocado...so good!  I am freezing half the dough (divided) and am hopeful it with thaw and bake up just as good when needed. Thanks Sally..this recipe will save me lots of ca$h :)

A local restaurant makes this and tops it with havarti cheese, diced grilled chicken and pretty much any diced sauted veggie you like. AWESOME appetizer! I rolled the dough out really thin and made lines where I wanted it to break. I baked it then added the toppings then put it back into the broiler to melt the cheese and get the toppings hot.

Excellent recipe. I made it several times, and rolled it out using the Atlas pasta machine, which makes it super easy and fast. I've added crushed garlic, chopped rosemary, sahe and thyme, and sprinkled with black pepper on top. What a trea not to have eat store-bought crackers. These are delicious, and sturdy, perfect for dips.

I love this recipe; it's exactly like expensive store-bought flatbreads at a fraction of the cost. I typically add a bit more butter to the dough for a richer flavour. I've also experimented with different toppings, adding some nigella seeds (sometimes called black sesame seeds) along with sesame seeds. The only downside is rolling out all those thin sheets of dough is very labour intensive. But there's no flatbread so delicious as a homemade one - it's worth the effort.

I'm so glad to have found this recipe!  I have wanted to make a very thin cracker-like pizza crust like a local restaurant serves.  This is it!  The dough is very easy to handle.  To keep the crackers from puffing up too much, I docked the dough before baking (pricked the surface several times with a fork).

Used whole wheat flour. Very cracker like. These can be wrapped in wet and squeezed paper towel or cloth to soften and then filled and rolled.

A little time consuming but an impressive looking alternative to store bought crackers.  I brushed mine with egg white and then different combinatins of garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, parmesan and cayenne. pepper.

It's a bit time consuming, but it's really good with dip!  We tried it with Hummus and really enjoyed it as well.  If you don't mind spending extra extra time, you can make shaped chips with cookie cutters!

I made this with my 4 year old... he LOVED the project.  Works beautifully with a pasta machine.  We did 1/2 as crackers the remainder were lavosh 'pizzas' with ham, onion, green pepper, olives and cheese.  I'm glad we checked the website.

Made with wheat bran added, and olive oil instead of butter. They turned out chewier and I had to add some milk, but I still couldn't stop eating them!

Very good and very easy.  I did also find the dough to work with.  Did add just a bit more flour but could not roll without adding what I felt was too much flour.  Solution was to roll on baking parchment with an oiled rolling pin.  Just perfect.  I used olive oil on my rolling pin.  The only ingredient change was to use olive oil instead of butter.

My search for a homemade snack cracker has ended!  These are delicious, very easy to make (although a bit time-consuming) and can be customized to your tastes by replacing (or adding to) the sesame seeds whatever spices you like--this time I used Kosher salt, garlic pepper, and red pepper flakes.  I would suggest only preparing one egg white at a time to use for brushing on before baking as I found one to be more than enough for me.  A second would have just been wasted.  Also don't be tempted to remove them from the oven too soon.  Browner = crisper.

delicious...put salt and pepper on some, garlic salt and italian seasoning on another, I think you could top with whatever you wanted.  I had some trouble with bubbleing, wondering what, if any solution there is.

This was ok.  I expected something softer.  Part of the "bread" were a bit too hard to eat.

Very good and easy to make!  It also seems very versitile.  Will make for a nice change from denner rolls or butter bread when company comes over.

This was so very easy to make, toppings are endless.
I think a pasta maker to roll thin would make a big difference and much easier as I read from others.  Several of mine were not as crispy as the others.

We loved these! They were a bit time consuming, but worth it. Since we used them for lavash pizzas, we divided the dough into 8 pieces instead of 10. This made 7"-8" rounds. They were much better than the large lavash we've purchased from the store!

Very nice recipe...the balance of ingredients lets kneeding work without adding flour.  Just put all of the mixed ingredients with unincorporated flour bits onto the kneeding board and they will work in.
I tried some other recipe ideas ...like using olive oil instead of egg white ...DON'T... it made it way too heavy.  The egg white is perfect.  Sesame seeds work well, esp to not compete with other dishes.  Next time I'll press them in...but I also did some with fresh rosemary and sea salt and liked that too.

The recipe seems to imply that only one baking sheet is needed.  I fit only four pieces on a large sheet. The result was very thin and very crispy with some fabulous air pockets. Mmmmmm.
