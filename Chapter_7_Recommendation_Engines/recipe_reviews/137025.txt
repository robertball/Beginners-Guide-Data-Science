These taste just like pecan pie! I had trouble with the directions in figuring out why the two rectangles were mentioned. Fairly quick and really easy. I used non stick spray but mine stuck to the sides some. The edge pieces could be hand held to nibble on, but the center ones needed a fork as the filling was gooey and too messy to be picked up. I added another handful of pecans since it seemed to need more. Overall, this was very good.

I made this about a month ago for an appetizer night. Everything had to be finger food. This was a huge hit and I have been requested to bring it to Thanksgiving instead of Pecan Pie (along with a Chocolate and Pumpkin Pie).  If you can buy the Crescent Sheet it is so much easier. If you don't get the perforations completely sealed the topping will seap out and make a mess. Also make sure the sides come up as high on the pan as possible or it sill seap underneath. I read where someone had to eat the middle with a fork as it was to gooey. I did not have that problem. It was a tab limper than the edges but was still easy to carry. Maybe their's wasn't quite done or I got lucky. I did make mine a day ahead so it is possible sitting that extra time helped. The taste was every bit as good as pecan pie and to me it is so much easier to eat and to make. Enjoy

The topping is good, but we did not care for the crescent roll crust!  Look up the recipe for "pecan pie bars I", and with just the few extra minutes it takes to make the crust, you will have amazing pecan pie bars that are better than pecan pie!

Delicious, brought them to work & people are slobbering all over them. I made a smaller amount. I used 3 of the crescents for my son's breakfast. Pressed the other 5 into an 8x8 square pan. Used a bit more than halve of the filling. Lots more pecans. Yummy! I thought I overcooked them, wasn't paying attention, but they are still so good! Tastes like a mock pecan pie.

This was good! I used more nuts than it called for and let it cool for at least 2 hours before cutting into squares.

My husband and mother loved these.  I thought they were a bit too sweet and they got soggy very quickly.  I think I didn't ensure the crust was pre-baked enough and will definately try this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were tasty I was afraid they would be to sweet so I reduce the sugar to a quarter cup but they were still delicious to us. Nuked for 5 seconds in the mic and they were like melting in the mouth will make again. Thanks for sharing.

These were good.  I added more pecans.  Also, I like my pecan pie with br. sugar, so I used part wh sugar and part br sugar.  It doesn't make a lot of topping.  But after it baked, it spread enough to cover the crescent sheet.  Good, easy and will make again.

There didn't seem to be enough topping for the pan.  I did use the extra puffy crescent roll dough which I had bought by mistake.  I had to start over with 1.5 times filling.  The crowd loved them, of course.

I made this for a Thanksgiving get together, and they were a BIG hit.  It was So easy to make, and they were so yummy!  I increased the amount of nuts to 1 cup, as another cook had. I also used parchment paper to make clean up easier.  It is a little more difficult to spread dough, but it will work.   I will definitely be making these again!

These were soooo good! The cresents make the perfect crust for these bars. Bake for the full amount of time once u have poured the batter on though. otherwise they will be a little too gooey. A nice change up from pie. :)

It never really set right, the topping was really runny and the crust was too thin. If I make this again I will use a smaller pan. Maybe a 8x8 square.

I also added extra pecans, there just didn't seem to be enough when I mixed it all together. I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chips. It was pretty good but not "outstanding". I reserve 5 stars for recipes that I can't stop eating!

Had to double recipe to cover 13x9 pan, and also doubled pecans called for.  DELICIOUS.  I made this because my husband loves pecan pie, I normally can't stand it...this is AMAZING, I can't get enough!

I thought it was delicious! Really really rich, so I could only eat a little at a time - but I keep going back for more. The only change is I don't know how this could possibly work with only 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I used three times that much, and it was a nice even layer - I couldn't imagine how it would work in a 9x13 with less. I did not change any of the other filling ingredient amounts. I used the unperforated dough, but I did not cut it in half (why?), and prebaked an extra 2-3 minutes to avoid any chance of the sogginess others mentioned. And I added chocolate...yuuuum. This will definitely be a new regular, easy on the budget, super easy and super delicious.

Simple to make.  As other readers said the center syrup didn't set as well as the sides.  But all in all not a bad recipe.  I liked the fact you got the sweetness of pecan pie...in a smaller dose

These are soo super good, especially for how easy they are to make.  Even better because I already had all the ingrediants on hand.  I will be making these again SOON! :)
