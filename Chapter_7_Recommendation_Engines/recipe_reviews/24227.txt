at cooking school my pastry chef was from England and we learned to make a wish not only for the pudding but also for xmas fruit cakes! thank you for sharing this tit bits.  I usually replace the suet with butter and like this recipe, uses what ever in the baking pantry, including dates, plum, apricot and cranberries. I like some nuts but very finely chopped.

I made this one last year, I found it very much to my taste, but my children and family found it too nutty. . .

The flavor of the pudding was good when I tasted the batter, but I steamed the pudding for 9.5 hrs, checked it, and it was very dark and the entire outside of the pudding seems burnt. I have never burnt anything while steaming before and didn't even know that was possible. :(
