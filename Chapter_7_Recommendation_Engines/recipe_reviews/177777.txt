This is even better with crumbled crisp
bacon or cooked breakfast sausage. I add in a cup of shredded cheddar or swiss.
You can substitute plain yogurt if you don't have sour cream. TIP: This is great
if you make this the night before and take it out 15 minutes before you stick it in the oven. I usually serve this with
english muffin bread or big fluffy biscuits.

Very good! I have a house full of picky eaters, so I swapped the Cream of Mushroom out for Cream of Chicken and used breadcrumbs instead of corn flakes. My family loved it.

It was absolutely delicious! Definitely a comfort food for any day. I could definitely sit and eat this all by myself. The onions and the hash browns created an excellent starchy and crunchy texture. Also, the cheddar cheese gave it a wonderful cheesy flavor. This is a recipe that all ages can enjoy. I did not use the cornflakes because I did not have any, but overall the recipe was a success!

I made this today and took it to a gathering for Mother's Day brunch. It was a huge hit!  I doubled the recipe and made only one change which was to top with a big can of French fried onion rings. I also used some cornflakes, but the next time I'll skip them. The onion rings hit the spot perfectly.  Next time I will use a low-fat sour cream to cut out some of the calories and I will let the potatoes, cheese and sour cream reach room temperature before mixing and baking. With everything so cold, it took longer to heat through to the center. Also, I recommend adding the onion rings (or corn flakes) only for the last 15 minutes so they don't get too brown. I recommend mixing everything before adding to the potatoes so that it's well incorporated. This is something I will definitely make again and not just for a brunch! It was delicious!

I really liked this recipe. My family loves cheese so I doubled the cheese. Also, I didn't have an onion so I used a package of onion soup mix instead. I didn't have corn flakes either so I left that off. I put more cheese on the top for the last 15 minutes instead. I'll definately make this again.

I made this for work. Everybody loved it. I made a double batch. I used a bag of o'brien hash browns.  They have onions and peppers and I didn't use a onion. I used a bag of country style too. I also used 1 bag of mixed colby and montery jack cheese and 1 cheddar cheese. No salt and some pepper. I doubled everything  else. Great for a group.

this was really yummy! I didn't have cornflakes and topped with fried onions (from the can) instead. Also, substituted low fat sour cream. Delicious!

This was a very simple and filling casserole.  I made it for dinner and my boyfriend really enjoyed it!  I added chorizo and it helped to make it more of a complete meal.  I would suggest mixing all of the ingredients in a large bowl and then transferring to the baking dish, because it was a little difficult to mix.  I will definitely make this again!!

I am a novice cook & this recipe was so easy to make.  And the best part - it was a hit at Thanksgiving!  The only change I'm going to make next time is less onion, but that's just my personal preference.  Overall, fabulous recipe!

Perfect balance on a classic dish. This is one of my most favorite comfort foods. This recipe is right on as far as texture and balance goes. I love it and will never use another.

I like to fry the leftovers in the morning with some eggs...Yum- even worse for you but so tasty!
Thanks for sharing this awesomeness! :)

I used O'brien potatoes versus hashbrowns so I did not add any onion.  Plus I put in a slow cooker on low for 5 hours.  Did not use the cornflakes because I did not bake this however I still added the butter...because.. I love butter.  It turned out delightfully delicious!

Absolutely DELISH.  I vary it by using a classic "crushed Ritz + melted butter" combination, instead of the corn flakes.  I also add dashes of my favorite seasonings, and always get rave reviews.  We make this for just about EVERY family gathering and there is rarely even a spoonful left.

Thanks so much for this recipe! I've had this type of dish all my life, but some better than others. I looked around for one with just right combination of flavors I love. What I did different: used cream of chicken (cheapest store brand), butter (not marg), 1/4 cup cream cheese, diced potatoes, 2 cups colby jack shredded cheese, 1/3 can of fried onions in the mix and then I used another 1/3 can of fried onions with equal parts corn flakes crushed together for topping. Oil in the onions helped the corn flakes crisp up nice. Rave reviews - of course it wasn't low fat, but I did use a light sour cream. Very yummy. This ones a keeper. Thanks to others for suggested modifications too.

I have a very similar version of this recipe I use on a regular basis.  So, so, so good.  The only difference is that my version uses Cream of Chicken soup and the topping is 2 cups of crushed corn flakes mixed with 1/4 cup of melted butter.

Now, if you really want to make this recipe WOW, substitute a bag of frozen sweet potato fries for the hash browns.  You will have to chop them once thawed so they are hash brown size.  Put a pinch of cayenne pepper in the mixture too.  Fantastic variation!! 

Or, stick to the regular potatoes and add some fresh bacon bits.  Mmmmmmm.

One other note - make ahead in the pan - don't bake but freeze instead.  Take out of the freezer, defrost and bake - Wonderful!  I often split this recipe into two batches for the freezer.

This is a family favorite. This works great with texas style hashbrowns (the small square cut ones). I substitute Cream of Chicken Soup for the Cream of Mushroom Soup. I also leave out the onions and add a dash of onion and garlic powder. If you mix the corn flakes with some melted butter before topping, it will give them a good taste and crisp. Just some changes I've picked up from others. It's pretty difficult to mess this recipe up though, as it is always delicious.

I made this last night as a spur of the moment side.  I didn't have corn flakes or fried onions so I just added 1/2 the cheese o the mix and 1/2 on top.  I also halved the butter and was glad I did, it would have been too greasy otherwise.  Very good!

Fix and forget!  Excellent recipe.  Cut leftovers in squares and froze in non-stick aluminum foil.  When I made meatloaf I put them in the oven for another easy meal.

This recipe is a HUGE hit in my house!  Whenever I make this I use Heluva Good French Onion Dip in place of sour cream.  Adds a little more flavour.

This was really, really good and easy to assemble. I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom and I think the cream of mushroom soup gives hashbrown casseroles a funky taste. Also used nonfat greek plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. Topped with fried onions the last 15 minutes. Great recipe!

Delicious and easy!  I baked potatoes  1st and also used 4 Tablespoons of flour instead of three.  Instead of cornflakes I used a can of Frenchs french fried onions and put those on the last 10minutes of cooking.  I took to brunch and  received alot of compliments!

Great! I made it for brunch. I received lots of compliments. I changed it by using cream of potato soup; I chopped up three stalks of celery and sauteed them in the butter (I reduced it to 1/4 cup) along with the onion and garlic  before I added it to the mixture. I also added some chopped ham. I mixed it all in a big bowl before I put it into the baking dish and then put some sliced cheese (swiss) on top. No corn flakes. I also baked it over an hour.  I prepared everything last night and had it in the fridge overnight. It worked perfectly.

I baked this casserole for 45 minutes according to the instructions, but the hashbrowns (used frozen as directed) were not fully cooked and a little crunchy, so after dinner I put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes and that took care of it. 
I thought this recipe was a little bland and could have used a little salt. We did not care for the cornflakes on top because we found them to be chewy after they were cooked. I would try an alternative topping, like bread crumbs or ritz crackers mixed with a little butter. Speaking of butter, I think you could easily half the amount of butter and it would be better and less greasy. 
I probably wouldn't make this again if my husband hadn't loved it so much. I will make the changes above and try it again since he seemed to really like the idea of this casserole.

I liked the creaminess of this recipe, though next time I will make it in a glass 13 x 9 pan instead of a taller casserole to get more crispy surface. I also substituted creamy chicken verde soup for the cream of mushroom and added some garlic to give it a southwestern flavor, which everyone enjoyed.

Excellent taste. It is the onions that give it some crunch in the end, if you're looking for more crispness. I like the softness of the dish, husband thought it should be more cheesy and didn't care for the cornflakes. *Sigh, to him, any casserole needs to be cheesy. He says he loved it, but requests we replace the cornflakes with a cheese sprinkle next time. I think it sounds good and I'll try it for my cheese lovers in this house, but I give this recipes 5 stars, AS IS :)

This was great!!!!  However, I made a few changes. I didn't have corn flakes, so I used crisy rice cereal, was just as yummy.  I saved back about 1 Tbsp of melted butter and mixed the crispy rice cereal with it.  I used cream of onion soup, and omitted the chopped onion.  Double the recipe and bake for about 1 hour and 15min for a larger crowd.  Thanks Jill!!!

Perfect recipe!  I left out the onions since my SO doesn't care for them.  It still was delicious and easy.  I love the corn flakes topping. I used a 30 oz package and it worked great!

I love the recipe but I always have meat with my dinners, I added diced ham once, then diced bacon the next time to complete this wonderful meal. Usually when I make a large pan of food we have left-overs, Not on Hash brown Bacon Casserole Night!!!

Very good base recipe! I subbed cream of chicken for cream of mushroom as I do not like the flavor of cheese and cream of mushroom soup... I also only used about 1/4 of an onion since one would be overwhelming to my family. I didn't have cornflakes so I used bread crumbs-still great:)

We really enjoyed this recipe!  It doesn't get as "greasy" as some other recipes we've tried!  I skipped out on the crunch for the top, and didn't miss it!  Will use again!  Thanks!

My family made this for me for Mother's Day brunch and it was wonderful!  They added crumbled bacon and since we didn't have cornflakes they just topped it with some extra cheese.  We will definitely make this again!

Great dish, just too greasy with all of the butter. I had to drain grease off the top a few times. Other than that it was really good. Big pan was all eaten at Thanksgiving dinner!

I swapped out cream of mushroom for cream of chicken, added 8oz chopped up andouille, cut the cheese in half, reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, half an onion diced , 3 cloves of garlic minced, 2 peppers sliced,and used fat free 6oz of sour cream. I'd give it a 9/10 :) The sausage provided the fat I had taken out by reducing the butter. Pretty solid main dish (think hot dish with a twist).

I have been making this recipe for years, it is always a hit even with children. What I do differently is I use the southern style hash browns, and 2 cans of cream of potato soup, I also season with season salt(low sodium),onion and garlic powder.  I usually bake for   1 hour

Not a bad recipe. I used real shredded potatoes, which might be why they didn't cook through well. There was something missing in the flavoring, but still a great side dish.

Yummy comfort food.  I left out the onions, though.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used Panko.  This definitely will be a staple around here.

Everyone for the most part loves this....it is awesome for almost anyone. This is a great recipe, however, you can kind of figure out wht works best for you...add a little more of this or lessen it. Also, great to add your own finese..we really like to use onion and garlic salt in a lot of things. Add...meats or other things but it is great like it is to be honest!!

There are so many variations of this recipe but this is the best.  But I did use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and only 2 T of chopped onion.  Very creamy and good.  I only gave 4 stars because I did make some changes. But this is a 5 star recipe.

I only gave this 4 starts because it was quite rich with butter and sour cream. A little too much fat for our liking, but I will make again and cut back on the fat and I'm sure it will be a 5 start recipe! The flavor was outstanding. Also I added a pound of hamburer and cooked the onion with it.

We had this recipe for Easter Brunch and it was WONDERFUL.  We plan on keeping this recipe for future use-it was soooooo good!  The only thing we did different was not add the corn flakes.  We just like it the way it was.  Thank you so much for this one- it is a definite keeper!

Always a hit at potluck events!  Easy because you can make it in advance.  Cover with tin foil and keep on low heat in the oven until you're ready to eat.  Followed the recipe aside from thawing the hashbrowns to fridge temp prior, that way I don't have to worry about them being too firm or not fully cooked through.

I made this last night for dinner but I had to find the calorie count since I am only eating a certain amount of things. But my son loved it so much that he wants it for Christmas too. And I cooked it for an hour covered and some of the potatoes still were not cooked all the way through.. 
 
I made a few changes see below which made the individual serving only 315 calories per serving. 

1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Kroger Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup 
8 ounces (1 container) sour cream 
1/2 bag (32 ounces) frozen hash brown potatoes (about 15 oz) 
6 oz of cooked chicken breast strips
1 6 oz of green giant mexicorn
2 tbsp real bacon bits
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) 
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 
4 tbsp bread crumbs

I love this recipe! I do use cream of chicken soup and a tad more cheese ( in our home there is no such thing as to much cheese!) This is perfect to accompany anything! Also wonderful to take to parties! Cheers!

I cooked the hash browns first
Than I used cream of celery, Philadelphia cream cheese, no butter, cheddar cheese, bread crumbs and french onions instead of all the other ingredients and it turned out great

Easy recipe. I used fresh potatoes which added to the baking time and used cream of celery soup.  It needs a little more flavor for my family.  Next time will add some diced ham or bacon , maybe some garlic , jalapenos and ground black pepper.  Heck might even try some pepper jack cheese.

I used this recipe yesterday to serve 50 people.   I made almost twice as much as I should have needed, and there was very little left.   I do prefer Cream of Chicken soup.

I made this a few years ago for a family gathering and now I'm asked to make it all the time. I add ham cubes to give it a little something more. But always a hit for anytime!!

Excellent recipe! I've added some things to it over time to switch things up. I always use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I left out the onions and use 1/2 tsp of onion powder (for picky non onion eaters) I also added 1/2 cup of fully cooked diced bacon. It REALLY adds to the flavor and can be used as breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

OMG it was sooo good! BIG hit!! I did switch the sour cream for Heluava Good dip and put a little mozzarella in as well. I also didn't put corn flakes in the recipe. It was awesome, I can't wait to have it again!

Great recipe as it is, used fresh ground pepper and paprika only to season then stir and bake. Perfectly simple, just be sure you use thermometer oven temp gauges can not be trusted.

I thought the onion in this recipe was just too much.  If I make this again, I will probably just use onion powder.  The corn flakes also didn't seem to "mesh" well with the whole thing.  Overall, not my favorite. But, super easy to make..boyfriend seemed to like it.

I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again. I had to make a couple of changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and 8 oz. of heavy cream in place of the sour cream. I also added 1/3 cup of French fried onions into the corn flakes before crushing them. When I do make it again, I'll most likely do it the same way.

This was not a hit in our house...was very bland and ended up using it as a base for soup the following day, so wasn't a complete loss.  Will be sticking with the old recipe on this one.

I really like this recipe. I use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. And I also add a lot more cornflakes--it adds texture to it. But it's an easy and yummy holiday recipe.

Hey there, great recipe! I make it all the time a suggestion I have is to add about 1/4 milk for moistness and use old cheddar for more flavour. Great with steak!

Delicious recipe.  I used Cream of Chicken instead of mushroom as well since that's our preference and had panko on hand so I mixed panko, some of the cheddar cheese and some of the melted butter and sprinkled on top the last 20 minutes.  Wonderful that way!

The ingredients were really hard to mix in the baking dish because they basically filled it to the brim, so stirring it caused the frozen ingredients to crumble and pop out of the container, making a mess. It would be easier if the recipe allowed one to mix them in a larger, separate container before transferring them to the baking dish. The dish came out of the oven quite mushy to me; I would have preferred it be crispier and better done. It was very forward on the onion flavor, and very bland otherwise, so I had to add a lot more black pepper than the recipe calls for, as well as douse it in barbecue and hot sauce in order to eat it.

Wonderful basic recipe!  I added a can of cooked white chicken and increased the sour cream by 1/2 cup. I increased the butter to a full cup and added an extra handful of cheese.  My family has raved about it.

This was a big hit! I even had requests for the recipe. I omitted the corn flakes because I didn’t have any. I used cream of chicken soup in one casserole & 1 each cream of chicken & cream of mushroom in the other (some didn’t like mushrooms). Next time I will sauté onions to put in it because I love onions. I think it would also be good with green or red peppers as well. Super easy!

This is a great dish for a crowd. It’s easy to double and everyone loves it.  Very salty so I don’t add the extra salt. The cheese and soup are really enough salt for this recipe.  I love it and it’s easy to make.

This was very good, but I didn't really like the corn flakes on top. so the next time I make it  I will use either Ritz crackers or some buttered bread crumbs, or maybe just some extra cheese.

I used cream of chicken soup and country-cut frozen hashbrowns, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Next time I would add more salt, and use the prescribed amount of corn flakes (I used more thinking it would be better--it wasn't).  Or maybe just drizzle a little melted butter over the flakes before the last 15 min in the oven.  It needed just a little more something.

I double this recipe, and use cream of chicken soup. But everyone asks for it for every church and family gathering!  Great “go to” recipe.

Was great. I used 1/4 cup butter as recommended below. I only had cream of chicken on hand, so I used that instead of cream of mushroom. I also  omitted cereal topping as I had none. We used sharp cheddar and it was a big hit with the family!

Family favorite for years. We sometimes make as a main dish by adding shredded skinless rotisserie chicken, broccoli florets, corn,  and crushed potato chips instead of corn flakes for added flavor. Most talked about recipe at our office potlucks either as a side or main entree.

This was delicious - everyone in the family liked it. The two changes I would make next time: I'll use a milder cream of something soup (maybe celery?) because the mushroom had too distinctive of a flavor and took away from the cheesy potato taste I love. I'll also double or triple the amount of crushed corn flakes for the top, because I love the crunchy texture.

Super easy recipe that's a family hit - no brainer for the "make it again" list!

This was AWESOME!! I made it for my Mother's Day brunch, and everyone raved about it! The only changes I made were due to the fact that I didn't have 2 of the exact ingredients the recipe called for. The first was the soup. I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup. DELICIOUS!! The second was the topping. I didn't have cornflakes, so I mixed panko bread crumbs with a little melted butter and spread thet over the top. It made a nice crispy, golden topping. I would do it again that way. One other suggestion I would make would be to thoroughly defrost the hash browns. I've made similar casseroles in the past and have learned that the hash browns cook much better if they have been defrosted first. This is by far my favorite hash brown casserole recipe. You gotta try it!

I also used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  It tasted great.  I also did not put the corn flakes on top, but rather covered it for the first 30 minutes and cooked it uncovered for about 45 more minutes.  It was nicely browned.

Ever since  making this 27 years ago-I melted butter in a pan and added the crushed cornflakes to the pan. Stir butter and cornflakes to coat and scatter all over hashbrowns. The top gets slightly browned .

I made this for the monthly pot luck; for Easter, we had a brunch. The only thing I did differently was to substitute crumbled crackers (I used a generic Ritz). It was a big hit with the residents! I was asked to make it again soon!

Even. Better the next day.  My only compliant is that it didn't get really crispy on top.  I also use cream of chicken soup.

Very good!  Used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. Used lite sour cream. Would probably add a tsp. Of salt next time. Also used Ritz crackers on top instead of cornflakes since that's what I had.

It came out really good. I was really happy with the results. Will be making it again for sure. I did not use the flakes as I just did not see the need for it. Added lots of cheese on top and it was just fine. I think it is great alongside sausages also.

This is my husbands favorite meal. He often asks for it for his Birthday meal! I add ham to ours and that makes it a more balanced meal. We almost always have salad with it. Left overs are coveted!

My friends and I call this Potatoes Delicious. I make it with cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. I have also substituted French fried onions for corn flakes when I make it for dinner instead of brunch.

I sauté the onion first just to cut down on the raw onion flavor for younger pallets. I have made it with raw onions for years and it's great!

Made it with GF cream of mushroom soup and GF cornflakes and it was DELICIOUS! Followed the recipe as is, but used the gluten free variety on those two ingredients.

Didn't brown up the way I would have liked.  Tried raising the temp, but I was looking for a crispy brown topping.  Still, the ingredients alone made it tasty.  Thinking it will be a good leftover tonight.

Good, but I think I will add bacon and/or more cheese- a bit bland as is.

Great recipe. After reading other reviews, I was unsure about using cream of chicken or cream of mushroom, but Campbell's makes a cream of chicken & mushroom that worked perfectly. I got rave reviews. I used italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.The only thing I will do differently next time is sautee the onions before mixing it all together so they're a little more tender.

Instead of corn flake topping I put French's fried onions on the top and cooked for another 5 minutes.  It was excellent

Very easy and whole family liked it.  To make into a main course, I add  a pound of cooked ground beef and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  About 5 minutes before it is finished, I top with a can of French fried onions instead of the corn flakes.

I've made this recipe for years and used cream of chicken soup instead and topped it with crushed potato chips.  Good use for the crushed chips at the bottom of bag that's almost gone.

Waaaaaay too greasy. I will use half the butter next time. Cook time was more like 55 minutes. It was pretty good though besides the grease. Would be great with veggies cooked in, which I will do next time.

I added chopped ham and used cheese wiz because I was short on time. Also, I used 1/4 c butter in the mix and 1/4c butter in the corn flake topping. It was awesome!

Great recipe!  I cut back on the butter & used a scratch version of cream of chicken soup to reduce sodium & eliminate gluten.  Big hit with everyone.

This recipe was very good, I have made it twice.  The first time I made as written and served it with a ham.  The second time I made it, I used 1/2 shreaded parmesan cheese and 1/2 sharp cheddar instead of all cheddar and I used cream of chicken/mushroom soup and served it with a plain herbed baked chicken, which was not a salty meat.  I liked it both ways.  
Thank you!

I made this for work it was a hit, but the onions did not soften that's the only thing people didn't like and I didn't either. 
I now use  onion and garlic powder. It's amazing awesome. I make it  every month for work by request.  
They love it.

I can never follow a recipe exactly, but still give it a good rating for the "base".  I changed to Cream of Potato soup and used the cheddar french fried onions for the topping.  I also cook a pound of bacon, drain and saute the onion in 1 tbls of the grease, and add cajun seasoning to that, before adding to the other mixture. Sometimes I use 1/2 pepper jack and 1/2 cheddar for more zip.

This was creamy and delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used half cheddar cheese and half shredded velveeta cheese.
