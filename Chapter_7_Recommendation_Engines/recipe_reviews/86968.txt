Per my "family reviewers" this was an excellent dinner "Senorita"! My gang likes the smokey flavor of bacon, so that's what I used in this recipe. I made quite a bit of bacon and used the infamous "Bills fried bacon" on this site, which I've made before, but this time I only used onion and garlic powders and some black pepper. If you haven't tried his ingenious way of cooking bacon yet, I suggest you give it a try. Before I added the spinach, I sauteed several cloves of slivered garlic in the oil which gave the dish a wonderful flavor. I did need to add some of the pasta water to get those juices flowin'. This was simple, relatively quick and delicious enough for an encore. Thanks so much!!

This was terrific and so easy to make. It reminded me a lot of pasta alla carbonara.

This was sooo yummy! Per member reviews I cut the pasta in half, a whole package would have been way too much. I used a bit more spinach and pancetta, and added a little more oil and a little pasta water so it wasnt so dry. Came out excellent! I love how the crushed peppers give it just a little bit of heat but nothing overbearing. The flavors mesh together perfectly, never would have thought. This is definitely a keeper :)

My family LOVED this!!!  There were no leftovers the night that I made this - and I have been asked to make it every week!  I did make a few adjustments, though:  I doubled the pancetta and spinach, and instead of adding hardboiled eggs, I cracked two eggs over the hot combined ingredients letting the heat from the pasta cook it as I stirred.  It tasted absolutely sinful.

This was simply awesome. A great blend of flavors, thanks to the pancetta and eggs.  I made half a box of linquine, but the entire sause mixture.  Next time I will double the amout of spinach, but other then that, would not change a thing.  If you made this with salami instead of the pancetta, you missed out on great flavor.

This was a very unique pasta dish, we really enjoyed it! As suggested, I halved the amount of pasta. I also added a tablespoon of garlic and a medium white onion, thinly sliced. Next time I will add more red pepper to give it a bit more zing.

I used bacon in this recipe instead of pancetta and it had a very bitter taste.  Perhaps it would have tasted much better with the pancetta but I don't think I will bother with it again.

We liked this very much. I used bacon instead of pancetta. I did have to use some of the pasta water. Next time, I am going to add sundried tomatoes to see if that kicks up the flavors. This will become one of our camping dishes-just 2 pots and it is a complete meal. Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe. If you use the pound of pasta, you will need to at least double your other ingredients. To make this a stand out dish, use fresh pasta instead of dried. Fresh can usually be found in the refrigerator section of your store. Remember that fresh pasta requires very little cooking time, about three minutes or so. Shaved or grated hard boiled eggs are good, but you can also take raw eggs, scramble them up, and pour into the hot pasta, to cook. Or you can just scramble them in a skillet and cook if you are afraid they won't get cooked enough. I would say if you use raw and put into the pasta that you know your egg source and how fresh they are.

This was wonderful. I used pancetta from a little Italian market around the corner. Claudio sliced it in thin slices. I wasn't sure how that would work but it actually dispersed the meat throughout the pasta better than diced. As some of the other reviewers suggested, I added sliced garlic to the pancetta while it browned. I also added more spinach to the 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. My husband agreed that 1/2 tsp. would be too much. Farfalle was our pasta of choice. All those little nooks & crannies held the sauce. A whole pound was perfect. I don't know how 1/4 pound per person would be enough. We didn't need any of the pasta water. The dish was perfect without it. I hate to say it but seconds were in order for both of us. This was a perfect summer night dinner. The pasta with a light salad & French bread was very satisfying. Of course, we can't forget our wonderful Sonoma County wine.

I made this pasta last night and the end result was underwhelming.  I added two medium sized slices shallots and 5 cloves of garlic which I sauteed after the pancetta was cooked; I also used more pancetta than the recipe called for.  The end result just didn't really mesh for us - we won't make this again.

This is a great recipe that I can throw together rather quickly, especially when I've got too much spinach from our garden & eggs from our friend's chickens.  We added pepper with the cheese at the end.  My kids loved this!

We opted to use bacon and did use some of the pasta water to make it "sauce-y" but it was still on the dry side. We prefer a more "wet" sauce, and despite the great ingredients, this won't be a repeat as-is.

I debated giving this 4 stars, but it's so easy to make, so 5 it is.  I have made this twice, once true to the original recipe and once with some modifications.  The original recipe is good, but it lacks some flavor.  I sauteed some halved cherry tomatoes and some garlic with the rest of the sauce mixture, and added some fresh mozzarella, and it was delicious

Very good and very easy.  I used fresh spinach linguine and Bills Fried Bacon from off this site.  The flavorful bacon was a terrific addition and the fresh pasta added a lot, too.

This turned out just lovely.  I used my own homemade pancetta, this was the first dish I made with it.  I did double the ingredients, accept for the red pepper flakes.  I also only used 3/4 lbs of linguine.  The husband said it was restaraunt worthy and we're already arguing over the leftovers!

We will definitely make this again, with a few modifications. I halved the amount of the pasta and that was perfect. The red pepper gives it a real kick that you can feel in the back of your throat - almost too much. Changes I will make include: decrease by half the red pepper flakes, double the spinach, add halved cherry tomatoes and use smaller noodles, such as bow tie or at least break the noodles in half before cooking.

I really liked this recipe. It was really salty because I salted the pasta. I don't think I'd do that again because the Pancetta was salty enough. I used four cups of spinach and half a box of pasta. I agree with others that a whole box would have been far too much. YUM.

I've tried this recipe twice, trying to decide if it's a keeper.  I've cut the pasta in half, a dash of red pepper, increased the spinach, added fresh mushrooms and used a summer sausage because I couldn't find the pancetta.  With those changes it's pretty tasty.

This pasta is pretty good.  I think 16 oz is way too much pasta and would adjust the proportions--either add more spinach, egg, bacon or reduce the pasta.  Even as it is, the dish is delicious.

I made after Easter since I wanted to use the leftover ham and boiled eggs.  So, I used ham instead of pancetta and I had to use vermicelli instead of linguine and I did add more spinach, but it was delicious.

Great!  I substituted ham for the pancetta.  Delicious and easy.  Eggs were already hard boiled for Easter egg dying.

It’s good but just a bit bland for me.  I will make again, add garlic and more red pepper flakes.  I’ll also add a lot more spinach.

Added more spinach, used a 4 oz. package of pancetta, doubled the olive oil and red peppers. Added  1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper when I put the spinach and eggs in. Used only 1/2 amount of pasta and still had to add 6 Tbsp of pasta water . Flavor was good and I will make again my way.

This was very good! I used hot csabai sausage instead of pancetta and red pepper flakes and I added a chopped tomato and onion and fresh garlic. This recipe is being added to my favourites.

Absolutely delicious. Even if I added a bit too much garlic as per the suggestion of other reviewers. Can't wait to make this for the family.

Read the reviews before you make this, and it will be fabulous.  I followed the recommendations of others and used half the pasta, double the spinach and pancetta and added some minced garlic along with the spinach.  I also beat the eggs and added them to the hot pasta in the skillet and let them cook in the pasta.  Very much like a carbonara, we loved it.

It was really good! easy to make and pretty tasty. I want to say that the picture is a little misleading because the pasta pictured is not linguini.

This was delicious but you definitely need to double the recipe for one pound of pasta....the measurements in this recipe was enough for half a pound of pasta, but very delish. I added a little chciken stock. Yum.

This was quick and easy to make. My fiancee loved it, although I though it need a little more flavor.

For 2 people we ended up using an entire package of pancetta (3 oz), 2 eggs, 4 cups of baby spinach, since the pancetta & spinach really do shrink up in size.  I added some minced garlic & some onion powder for more flavoring. My bf really enjoyed this flavorful & light pasta dish!

This recipe was very disappointing. I loved the idea of this combination of ingredients, but it came out very bland. The red pepper flakes overpower the subtle flavors of the other ingredients. I also felt that it was missing something (flavor?). Another reviewer suggested sun dried tomatoes which probably would be good, but it seems like the other ingredients would not be necessary if you added any other strong flavor. I will not make this again.

What a great and easy recipe.  Loved the taste of the hard boiled egg in this.  BUT - I used only 8 ounces of Penne Pasta and the sauce mixture was just perfect for this amount of pasta.  I think with 1lb the mixture would have been lost.  I will double the mixture recipe if I ever use 16 ounces.  Didn't change a thing otherwise and it was awesome.
