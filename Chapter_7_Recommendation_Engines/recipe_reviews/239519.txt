These are well worth the effort of grinding flax and nuts. They are my go to healthy snack. My 2 yr old grandson loves these.

Yummy, though not quite what I expected. I thought these would be more the consistency of granola bars, but they're not even close. I might experiment with skipping the eggs and perhaps adding some oats (though I do realize that would turn it into a whole different recipe!) to make them denser and less fluffy. 

Anyway, it's good as it is, but I did make a few changes: 
I used butter instead of oil, and only 1/3 cup, but  I increased the pumpkin to make up for it.
I used about half white sugar, half golden brown sugar (next time I might use all brown).
I used 1 cup regular dark chocolate chips, but I stirred them in instead of sprinkling them on top.

I almost didn't make these because there were so few reviews. Don't make that mistake! These are delicious! I made  them for packed lunches and the fam ate them all before we packed any!

I agree with previous reviewers--take a chance on this!  It is more cakey than granola bar-like (probably because of the eggs but that adds protein).  Not super sweet like a dessert.  I did make some subs because I was using up what I had on hand, and it was still good (used hazelnut flour instead of ground almonds, didn't have white flour so used more whole wheat and some GF all purpose (Bob's), and ran out of white sugar so used about 1/4 cup coconut sugar).  Definitely a forgiving recipe.
