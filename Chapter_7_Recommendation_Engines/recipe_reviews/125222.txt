I made this but left it in the baking dish with the marinade and baked it in the oven @ 425 for 10 or 12 mins.  It was fabulous!  Also, although I did use fresh rosemary and lemon juice, I used dried parsley and jarred garlic.  Scrumptious!

This recipe was delicious! I used olive oil instead and blended all the ingredients in a blender like suggested. I had some leftover, so I served it cold the next day for lunch on a toasted english muffin, cream cheese and some avacado slices. Better even the next day!

I was looking for an easy to make, tasty recipe - and this one fit the bill. I used salmon steaks instead of fillets, and chives for the green onions. The fresh rosemary gives this a great flavour. Will make again.

Wow- really good!!! To save time, I threw all the marinade ingredients in a blender and then pulsed until it was all mixed/chopped together.  I then put everything in a large ziploc bag and marinated the salmon for just a little over an hour.  My friends and family LOVED it- it was incredibly full of flavor for being so easy to prepare!  Perfect for summer grilling- We will be making this again!

Very good salmon!  Blended ingredients for marinade in blender as suggested, and used 1/3 c. olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  Marinated for longer than the suggested 30 minutes. Baked in 450 degree oven for 15 mins. (until fish was flakey).  It came out great!  Light & flavorful...served with pasta.  Will make again.

This was good, but I don't understand why everyone is raving so much.  It tastes like salmon with lemon and rosemary. The flavors go well, but it isn't the best salmon (and I used fresh, wild salmon)recipe I have ever used.

This had a nice flavor and was quite easy to prepare. I used a grill pan/rack on top of the grill and sprayed it with Pam first so the fish wouldn't stick. Will make it again.

This was delicious.  The marinade really cut the fishy taste in salmon.  I served it with terriaki rice and asian stir fry vegetables.  Also, I marinated it for about 4 hours.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I agree with others that it should marinate much longer than 30 min.

Blend the ingredients in a blender (use olive oil instead of vegetable oil) & put all the marinade on the fish & marinate for 45 min.  Then, broil 5 min/side then check. If needs to be cooked more, put in oven at 400 for a few min. Boil the sauce separately (while fish is cooking). Always make sure not to overcook the fish!

This was okay, but not fantastic. I added garlic & it still was low on flavor. But I think it has good potential as I tweak it more on future tries.

Very good.  I am not a big fan of salmon but actually can eat it prepared this way.  My husband loves it.  I've made it twice already and am making again tomorrow.  I let it marinate a lot longer than 30 minutes though...probably more like 4 hours or so and I use dried herbs.

I also baked this at 425 for 10-12 mins. Didn't use lemon but it was still absolutely delicious! I made a dill sauce to go with it just in case, but it was overkill. The herbs in the marinade were wonderfully flavorful and sufficient on their own. My first attempt at making a salmon dish like this, and I'll make it again and again. One of my favorites. Thanks Monell!

Excellent marinade for salmon! It was a hit with my entire family, which includes 4 kids from 13 to 3 years of age. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used a food processor to blend the ingredients of the marinade together. This recipe went into my recipe box. It's a keeper!

ATTENTION FISH HATERS:  About six months ago, I wouldn't even TRY fish.  Due to some health issues, my doctor encouraged me to eat more fish.  So reluctantly I tried a "non-fishy" fish...Tilapia!  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  But as my husband and I decided to try eating some healthier dishes, I bought some salmon on a whim.  I kept putting off making a salmon dish, but finally, at my husband's prodding, I decided upon this recipe.  IT WAS GREAT!!!  I was always told that salmon had a pretty "fishy" taste...But the lemon and rosemary really covered that up well.  We will definitely be trying this again...And maybe from now on, I'll actually make fish once a week.  :)

Argh!  Forgot to lessen the seasonings as I was using dried instead of fresh.  Thus, the salmon was overrun with parsley and rosemary.  I also prefer olive oil over the veggie oil.  This marinade needs more zest ... would try garlic with it next time.

This marinade is delicious! I baked the fish in the oven as it was pouring rain on my planned barbeque day. Absolutely delicious. My friends and family loved it. We had some salmon lovers and a couple of cod fans so I used the same marinade on both kinds of fish. So tasty. I will definitely make this again. I can't wait to try it on the barbeque!

I wish I could give this ten stars - it was superb!  I am NOT a fan of fish but this…  wow!!!
I followed the directions EXCEPT I didn't have any scallions so I used regular  onions, I forgot to put some aside for basting, and I marinated it for about an hour…  Regardless of the small changes, it was beyond fantastic;  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!   I'll be making this again next week for my daughter's birthday - I think I'll try using the blender for the marinade this time…

Not so good, it was bland, dry, too much lemon. The lemon overpowered the salmon for my taste. It was good in salad though. Not one I would recommend. thanks though.

very taste.  I used dry ingredients cause I didn't have fresh and it worked out good for me, but I bet it would have been better with fresh.

I made this receipe for two.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I put all ingredients in a blender and marinated the salmon for more than 30 minutes.  I cooked atop stove covered for 20-22 minutes on a low flame.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!  Will make again and when weather is warmer will try atop grill.

I was not expecting such a wonderful flavor with so few ingredients!  My husband said this is one of his favorite fish recipes, and he's not a big fish person!  His 20 year old son liked it too!  I made it as written except I used dried herbs and I substituted thyme for rosemary due to preference.  We will definitely be making this one again!

I made this for a decent size group of people last night and everyone loved it. This morning when I woke up I realized I wanted to use Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil. But it turned out great. I didn't use rosemary but everything else was awesome. I also just baked it in the pan with the marinade at 425 degrees. Will definitely make this again and try it on the grill in summer.

My husband and I love fish, and salmon happens to be on the menu quite often.  However, we get tired of the same seasonings so I thought I'd try something different.  I followed the recipe and made one change, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I blended the ingredients in a blender as others had recommended, and the flavor of the fish turned out so moist and robust!  I believe that fresh herbs make the difference when marinating fish.  We will definitely be using this again!

Excellent and easy recipe. I needed a last minute recipe so I didn't have the green onions or fresh parsley, I used dried parsley instead. The salmon was delicious. I did pair it with an avocado dip from another salmon recipe and the two together were outstanding.

It was ok but completely overtook the taste of salmon.  All you could taste was lemon juice and rosemary.  I didn't let it marinate any longer than the recipe suggested but it was still quite overpowering.  The recipe does make the salmon look very nice when finished though.

Very good!  My husband is not a big fish fan, and he really enjoyed this one, it is a keeper!  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil, and did not have rosemary, so used Basil.  I will try again after I get some rosemary though.

I served this salmon at room temperature with a Basil Aioli sauce.  Delicious!! I also omitted the rosemary as I thought it might conflict with the basil and grilled the salmon on a cedar plank.  My group of 10 dinner guests last night loved it!

Excellent.  I marinaded the fish overnight in a Ziplock.  I used salmon and striper (marinaded separately), and both dishes were delicious.  I made scrambled eggs with the leftover striper the next morning, and it was outstanding.  Simple, tasty, health-filled food.

The Salmon had good moisture and texture but was a bit bland.  Not a bad marinate, but not exceptional.  Both my wife and I felt it was "missing something".  If you want some kick to your fish, look elsewhere.
