These muffins were surprisingly good. I tried three "inverted" and three with the sticky topping on top. At first I thought the topping would burn but it didn't. So from now on I'm putting the topping on the top. The other way was just too messy - I even tried paper liners but the pecans stuck to the paper. Next time I will try diced apple in them.

We loved these muffins - I made them just like the recipe.  I wish I had been careful about leveling the batter in the muffin cup to make them flat when inverting.  They taste just as good tilted a little.

Muffins are delicious and an easy recipe for kids to help with.  I baked mine in a dark pan and they were done in 20 minutes.  Next time I will make more topping, but the same amount of batter, and make more muffins.  I used 1/4 cup batter per muffin cup, but because the muffins rose they don't sit flat when inverted.  With less batter they will hopefully sit flat.   Also next time, I may try the metallic muffin liners to make clean-up a breeze.

Very tasty! Make sure you follow the directions and grease up those muffin cups. I forgot and lost some topping as a result of the oversight. These are best served warm and gooey!

These were very good, but they did not taste like pecan rolls to me. The taste was closer to coffee cake with a pecan topping. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems getting the muffins out at the end. I would make again.

These are very good!!  Followed the recipe to the letter, and I had no problems getting excellent results.  I used a non-stick muffin pan, sprayed with cooking spray, and they inverted beautifully.  Just scooped up the few pecans that remained in the pan, and placed them on top of the yummy muffins.  Will definitely make again.

My family LOVED these, they weren't even any leftovers! The only problem I have is that a lot of the pecans stuck to the pan, even though I followed directions. It's one of those things that really just depends on luck whether or not you get a good turn out of how many come out easily, but next time I'll either put the nuts on top, or use aluminum baking cups to make cleanup easier, but I'm no longer trusting my Pam spray to get these out of the pan easily. Also, if you wanted to make this any more sugary, I would totally put pancake syrup over the top!

I will try again... I think I overbaked a bit the first time as they were a little tricky to remove from pans.  Also they weren't as gooey as I was expecting... also from over baking I think. The muffins were quite large... thinking of trying mini ones next time.
