This is good with leftover baked beans or even leftover chili. This also works with kielbasa or smoked sausage. Great quick lunch. This is one of the first things I make for lunch next day following a big barbeque or the day after making a big pot of chili. My husband loves this for breakfast, adding eggs to the rollup!

What if you tried it with canned chili?  Chili dogs are wonderful and already contain the beans and texmex spices.

My two-year-old is such a picky eater, but he loves hot dogs. This was definitely a win for him, and for me since it's so simple and fast to make!
