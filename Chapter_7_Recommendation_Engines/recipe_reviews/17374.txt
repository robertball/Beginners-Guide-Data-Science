I cant believe that no one has rated this!!!!  These are GREAT.  I did add a few cloves of fresh garlic in w/ the red onion when I processed it.  Also used Chicken of the Sea lump crab meat and added 2 cans. Didnt have any party pump, so did it on party rye.  Made a few to taste, as I am taking them to a party...so I have 2 cookie sheets made up, so all I have to do is broil them when I get there!!!!!  I wish I would have made the mixture this morning as I think the flavors would have mixed together a little more, but all in all these are really easy and good!!! Thanks Janet and Linda!!!

Oh, was this awesome good!  We were really taken by surprise on this one.  Maybe it was because there were no photos to show us what we were in for, and I'm happy to give it its first.  More likely it was because of the lackluster (read boring) name for these.  "Janet's Appetizer? "  This is a disservice to Janet!  Also, in my opinion the crab is what makes these!  It should NOT be optional, and the word "crab" should be part of the title.  I could easily see this baked and served warm  as a dip or spread, but I served this broiled on crostini and loved it.  As for preparation, one cup of minced onion was way overload for me.  I took that down to 2 T. and was quite pleased with that.  My suggestion is to start off with a lesser amount of onion and add more to taste.  I used a good, 4-year aged  cheddar and pasteurized crab meat.  I took one taste of this, cold, and it was very good.  Heated, it was remarkable.   It didn't look like it though.  It had a boring, pasty look to it, but some fresh minced red and bell peppers fixed that right up.  CELANE47, this is indeed delectable as your description states, but you MUST see if the recipe can be modified to include the crab in the dip as a mandatory part of the ingredients and come up with a better title.  I suspect this will not be given the attention it deserves  and will continue to be ignored (6 reviews in 11 years?) if the recipe continues as it stands.   Meantime, hopefully this review and my photo will help change that.

This is a great recipe! Janet, if you are able, I think that you should rewrite your recipe description.  It doesn't include the part where you mention the crab until you actually open it up...so it sorta reads like...cheesy mayonnaise toast.  As great a recipe as it is I think you need to make it stand out...this 'keeper' needs to be!!

Terrific recipe.  I have made twice now and these are gobbled up by my guests.  The first time, I followed recipe exactly.  The second time I made these, I reduced the amount of mayo, increased the cheese just a tad, and added two cans of crabmeat and a dash of red pepper.  The second batch was much better and not so mayonaisse-y.  You are right....the lemon pepper is the key.  Thanks so much...great recipe.

We tried these, did just as the recipe states and I didn't like them at all. My husband thought they were ok and everyone else at the party tried one and I think out of kindness just didn't eat anymore but they didn't comment either. They weren't horrible just not very good either.

I made this for a 90th birthday party. Everyone loved it. It was so quick and easy. I needed 1 1/2 loaves of bread. This recipe has become my #1 appetizer.

The first time we followed the recipe, but then the second time we put it in a dish as a dip served with crackers and the dish was still warm when the dip was all gone!

I would recommend subbing half the mayo with sour cream. Definitely include crab.

Like the reviews, I cut the mayo down to about 3/4 cup, and cut the onion down to 1/2 cup , but added 1/2 cup of chopped green pepper.  Had a better presentation. The lemon pepper is very important for the optimal flavor of the crab. I also made it in the morning and let the flavors blend . It as a hit!

This is a great recipe -- like one of the other reviewers, I added some bell pepper for color.  Everyone loved them, and it was a huge hit.  In all the flurry of having a party I forgot to add the lemon pepper seasonong, and they still turned out delicious!
