This is just delightful! I didn't change a thing, only using pecans instead of walnuts, and I'm so glad I made the recipe as is, ignoring other suggestions and substitutions by other reviewers.  This is just delicious, prettily specked with the red cherries and brown nuts and flecked with the coconut. So different from the same ol' banana bread and a nice change.  It's moist and flavorful, with a real comfort food quality about it. Set your timer at less than the full hour--my loaf was done at 50 minutes. You can always add more time, but you can't undo it!

Mmmmmm.. this is the best banana bread i have ever had!! it is SO moist and flavorful!!
i did make some changes though.. subbed half the butter for applesauce, traded the cherries for strawberries (i had no cherries), and used brown sugar for half of the white.. also added a little vanilla =)

TWO THUMBS UP!

Great bread but the first time I baked it it was a bit dry so I added 1/2 cup of applesauce the next time and that made it perfect. So consider adding extra moisture.

I used pineapple instead of cherries and added more coconut.  I think I might try macadamias instead of walnuts next time.  This was superb!

Thought it was great.  I didn't have cherries so I used strawberries, used vanilla extract, and skipped the walnuts.  Yum.  Also, I used applesauce instead of the butter and it turned out great!!

If you love banana and coconut-you'll love this.  With every bite- you'll get equal tastes of both.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar(I think the sugar could be cut back to equal 3/4 cup-coconut sweetens it up plenty), 2 cups banana, vanilla and coconut extract instead of almond, a very heaping 1/2 cup coconut, and milk chocolate chips instead of cherries(didn't have).   I baked for like 50 minutes and used two 8 inch loaf pans.  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!  A different recipe worth making.

I'd give this recipe ten stars if I could! I've been searching for THE perfect quick bread to make as holiday gifts - one that's as good as my old standby pumpkin bread which I've been making for years. I've tried several from this site, but this is the winner! I have rigorous testing standards. ;)  The bread has to be SO good and moist that it's delicious with NOTHING on it - no butter, no cream cheese - NOTHING. This one passed the test with flying colors - I made one loaf in the evening and it didn't last past lunchtime the next day. My husband singlehandedly ate just about the entire loaf. I didn't change a thing and will make it just as the recipe calls the next time I make it - I would have ALREADY made more but I'm waiting for my bananas to ripen! ;)

Wowsers. Usually quick breads taste better the next day, but this one tasted amazing right out of the oven. I used 3/4 cup coconut, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, used only whole wheat pastry flour, and 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white.  Will bake again, every time I have leftover bananas!

Wow.  This is fantastic.  Everyone is nicely urging me to make another loaf.  I didn't have almond extract, so I used coconut (1/4 tsp) and vanilla (1/4 tsp) instead, which gave it a more coconutty flavor.  Also, used chocolate chips instead of cherries.

The flavor was good but the loaf stuck to the inside bottom of the pan (pan was greased & floured) and broke apart as I removed it prom the pan.  Will not make this again.

This was rated OMG by my 12 year old, so I decided that was a 5 star!  Followed to a T up to add ins - skipped the walnuts and cherries (no walnuts on hand, kid nixed the cherry idea!) and threw in a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead. Good enough to be breakfast, dessert, snack, or if you're lucky enough to have it last that long, all three!

I cut the sugar by half and instead of using a whole half cup of melted butter, I just used a quarter cup and added another mashed banana. No cherries on hand so I just omitted them. In muffin recipes, I always use equal amounts of baking powder and baking soda. I also used pecans instead of walnuts only because we don't care for walnuts. I made muffins out of this recipe--I got 12, just as the recipe stated. 350 for just over 20 minutes and they were ready to go. This was yummy. The combination of the banana with the coconut and the nuts was really good! Next time, I'd like to try this with a little rum extract.

This recipe is delicious.  I used coconut extract instead and omitted the maraschino cherries.  Make sure to only fold in the dry ingredients with the wet and NOT overmix.  It turned out very moist and flavorful.  My family loved it.  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Exceptional bread.  This is so moist, so pretty, and there are so many different flavors going on that work so well together.  I almost didn't add the cherries, but I am so glad that I did.  Not only do they add to the color of the bread, but they compiment the flavors as well.  I made a simple glaze with powdered sugar, milk and almond extract and just drizzled a tiny bit over the top.  I love almond flavoring and was actually a bit hesitant as to how it would go with banana, and I must say, it goes very well.  This one will definitely be one that will go to the teacher's lounge this school year!

Oh Wow! We love it! One of the best banana breads I have ever made. I am out of Walnuts but had Almonds so quickly toasted them in a dry pan. Figured it was okay since there is almond extract in the recipe. I went a little heavy on the coconut and used approx. 1 extra banana and will make it exactly the same next time.  Moist and very flavorful. I did leave it in the oven for about 55 min and should have taken in out at 50. It is a little darker than I wanted but wouldn't mind if it turned out like this everytime, really tastes perfect. I have found a new recipe for banana bread. Thanks for sharing!

this was pretty good. i made a few changes. i substituted choc. chips for cherries and used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts. i used a dark pan so i lowered the temp of the oven by about 25degrees. it is really great fresh from the oven, but i cant wait to try it in the morning with my coffee, as other reviewers have said it is better the next day. thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious warm!  The coconut and cherries add a really nice, tropical flavor to the bread.  The crust was crispy but chewy - my husband and I had to keep ourselves from polishing off the whole loaf!  I omitted the nuts and used canola oil instead of butter, to make it a little more heart-healthy, plus my bananas were super ripe, so I decreased the sugar to 3/4 c figuring the bananas were already really sweet.  I'm really glad I did as the bread was just sweet enough.  Definitely a keeper!  UPDATE:  I just tried this with 1/2 c applesauce instead of the melted butter or oil and it worked well!  Of course you don't have quite the same feel to the crust as you would with butter or oil, but the bread still tastes good and it's so much healthier!

Outstanding!  I substituted nonfat plain yogurt for some of the butter because I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough butter.  So moist!  Oh and I didn't have cherries so I left that out.

I liked this banana bread I didnt have a lot of cherries. I cut them in half so that I could stretch it. Didnt have walnuts so I didnt add it. I also added vanilla extract. And used about 1/4cup of sour cream just so I wouldnt have to worry about it being dry. Overall its very good.

This was without a doubt the BEST quick bred I've ever had (much less made).  Made exactly as directed only I was short on cherries (only had about 1/4 cup) and butter (3oz instead of 4).  First impressions were a little iffy as the almond extract flavor was quite strong and I wasn't sure I cared for it ... ten minutes later, I figured I'd better go back and have another piece (grin) before I rated this - and (as I sit here telling myself NOT to go back and get that 3rd piece) I simply had to give it a 5* rating.  I do think next time I'll scale back on the almond extract a bit (or use vanilla with chocolate chips instead of cherries), but man I'm telling you this is da bomb.  The coconut and banana work SO well together.  Can't thank you enough for sharing recipe!

Fantastic! I have been looking for a good Banana Bread & this is it! The coconut & cherries really make this great!! I left out the nuts & added a bit more banana just because I had it ready to go. Will be making this again!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the cherries and walnuts. This was delicious and such a great recipe that it's going in my special recipe binder! I may sprinkle some brown sugar on top before I bake it next time. Excellent recipe-thank you!

A bit too sweet for me, but the family ate it quickly.   The coconut was a nice change of pace. It browned before it was cooked through and I needed to cover it with foil.  It was also difficult to remove from the pan as others had mentioned.

These are great. You can vary the recipe many ways. I have used wheat flour, vanilla extract, chopped brazil nuts and pineapple. The kids love them. I made muffins (only needs 20 min cooking time). Moist and beautiful any way I have made them.

Delicious! I love anything coconut so of course wanted to try this when I found it. I left out the cherries because I'm not crazy about marachinos and didn't have any anyway. It was moist and flavorful. My children and husband love it.

Wonderful.. I used macadamia nuts and it was fantastic.  Use a light colored metal loaf pan, very (black) ripe bananas, and don't overcook it and it will be very moist.

Makes a beautiful, tasty loaf of bread! Unfortunately for me, I didn't have any cherries in the house, but the bread turned out great without them. It's a keeper!

Well, this was interesting at least.  I added crushed pineapple per another's suggestion--big mistake.  Too much moisture, and it makes the bread heavy.  Had that "not quite done" flavor even after cooking over an hour in MINI loaf pans.  I think I would try this again, but without the crushed pineapple.

Excellent! One of the worst things you can do is overcook such a nice bread. My oven has issues that need addressing, but my oven temp gauge showed 350 deg, and I actually took it out at 40 min and it was done (and a few min earlier would have been better). I always cut back on sugar, so used 3/4 cup of combined brown and white sugar, and it was the right amount of sweetness for me. Replaced the walnuts with pecans. Used both vanilla and coconut extract, 1/2 tsp each. I loved the coconut taste to the bread with that. For half of the butter, I used applesauce. Very nice and different change from the usual banana bread. I can see adding a handful of chocolate chips, possibly even pineapple to this, maybe for the holidays. Thanks Carol, this loaf is a keeper!

Delicious!  Made this as is,aside from not using cherries ( I had none) and pecans instead of walnuts because we prefer them.  This was moist and very flavorful.  I also made them as muffins instead of a loaf since I was limited on time.  Took 25 minutes.

Very good recipe, so moist.  Would definitely make again.  I like the cherry twist to it.  Great way to use up those black bananas and a bit more unique than the standby banana bread.

This was delicious! So moist and tasty :) I changed it a bit by adding toasted coconut and almonds, a bit of cocoa powder to make it chocolatey, and i don't even remember what else by this point. Really nice with some natural peanut butter though!

This was an absolute delight to make and eat!  The batter was beautiful - I felt like I was making a souffle!  I doubled this recipe to make two loaves.  My only personal touches were I used pecans instead of walnuts and I added a bit of banana extract to the bananas in addition to the almond extract!!  I will use this recipe again and again!!!!!!!!!!

Great loaf! I used vanilla extract instead of almond as that was what I had, and used 1 cup coconut with no cherries or nuts. It kept its form well, crumbled only slightly when cut, and was lovely and moist, particularly in the centre. I thought the coconut complimented the banana very well. Definitely something one should savour in the mouth instead of gulping down!

Excellent.  Discovered I only had half as much butter as I needed so I subbed apple sauce, throwing in an extra quarter cup.  This worked so well I'll probably use all applesauce next time to make it a little healthier.

Loved this bread!  I only made changes to accomodate my altitude of 8000' and due to the fact that I am diabetic.  Replaced the melted butter with 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce.  For the flour I used 1 c whole wheat and 1/2 c white.  To reduce the sugar I used 1/2 c  and 1/4 c of the brown sugar splenda mix.  For the altitude I reduced the baking powder to 1 t and the baking soda to 1/4 t.  The loaf rose perfectly and browned so nicely.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an awesome bread, it turned out perfect and very taste with the coconut.  Not dry, moist and flavorful.   I didn't have cherries so I used dried cranberries and chopped pecans and still very good.

This turned out great and makes a beautiful loaf!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I ran out of almond extract, so I used vanilla.  The addition of the maraschino cherries makes this quite different from your typical banana nut bread.  Nice and moist with the added bonus of being really pretty!!

This was a very good, moist bread.  I made mini muffins and they rose perfectly and deflated slightly while they cooled.  I don't think the cherries were necessary so I'll leave them out next time.  My husband doesn't like banana bread, and he's already eaten two!

I really enjoyed the extra layer of flavors in this unusual banana bread.  I toasted the coconut and pecans that I used in lieu of the walnuts.  Other than that I made as is.  Used 4 very ripe small bananas. I do think next time I would use at least 1/2 C of brown sugar instead of all white.  I think that would compliment these flavors better. This  was done in exactly 1 hour.  Smells awesome too!!!

Excellent recipe.  Nice change from standard banana nut.  Did some slight changes with moist and flavorful results.  Eliminated fat replacing with non-sweet applesauce; used 1/4 ts each of these flavorings:  coconut, vanilla and banana; substituted cherries with 1/4 cup chopped dried cranberries; reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.  As the author suggests, this recipe can easily be modified. Looking forward to making more using dried pineapple or mango for a  tropical taste.  A keeper.

I followed this reciepe to a tee.  However, I did leave out the nuts as the kids are not allowed any nut products at school.  This loaf came out perfect, so I'm making loaf #2 today, I only made the first loaf a couple of days ago and its gone.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!! Way better than the same old banana nut loaf!  I didn't have cherries but that's the only ingredient I left out. I also used half butter, and half apple sauce. I cut the almond ext. to 1/4 tsp plus I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla too. Baking time was almost exactly 50 min, and totally moist on the inside (which is exactly what I was looking for in a banana nut recipe). I couldn't wait the ten minutes cooling time before I had to dig in. The smell from the oven brought everyone to the kitchen. AWESOME RECIPE!!! This is now the only recipe I will use for banana nut bread. I might even try to use slightly less sugar next time. It's a big hit in our house! Thanx!

This bread is amazing, very versatile and a great foundation for many variations of quick bread.  I was looking for a pep talk for my bland old banana bread recipe.  I am honestly not a huge fan of banana bread, but it is my husband’s favorite so I have endured many years of it, but this I actually really enjoy and look forward to.  I mainly used vanilla extract (a little more than called for) and did not put the cherries (only do to husband's personal preference), sometimes I toasted the coconut (and added a little more than called for), but not often and no matter how I mixed up the recipe the bread always came out perfect.  I baked them in my convection oven and after the first loaf I knew the timing for a perfect outcome.  I made over 10 loaves for Christmas and they were an amazing hit.  I put them in baked goods gift bags with a personalized label and a huge bouquet of ribbon.  I am on my way now to make another loaf - it is by far the best go to quick bread recipe ever.  Give it a try, the sky is the limit on this one!

Yum. I used 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar and used unsweetened coconut. I found the amount of cherries a tad too sweet so I would lower the amount next time. But overall, this loaf is delicious.

This recipe is loved by my kids.  The only adjustments I made were to use a heaping half-cup of coconut and I also added a half-cup of chocolate chips.

This is really good!  My daughter said "This is yummy, you're the best cooker in the world!  20 Stars!"  It's a funny-looking loaf though.  It didn't rise above the pan at all, but stayed totally flat, no dome or anything.  It's a perfect rectangle!  I used half whole wheat pastry flour, half brown sugar, and half applesauce for the butter.  I used 3 small bananas that were pretty much black.  I loved the cherries in this (used Trader Joe's maraschino cherries).  I'm not a banana bread lover, but this is really yummy!

Like other reviewers, I thought it was better the 2nd day.  I also thought it was a bit dry, so I will try to make some modifications next time to help with this.

I made four mini-loaves and substituted sliced almonds for the walnuts, omitting the cherries.  The coconut I had on hand was sweetened and the breads came out delicious.  Next time I will try adding some chopped crystallized ginger in place of the cherries, just for an added layer of flavor.  Wonderfully easy recipe; many thanks for sharing!

This is soooo good. I substituted chocolate chips for cherries that I don't care for and this is the best banana bread I have ever tasted. I would probably add half cup more mashed bananas for more flavor.

This is one of the best Banana bread recipes I tasted!  This recipe is very moist and tasty.  The second time I made it, I substituted 1/2 c. chocolate chips for the cherries.  I liked this version even better.  I will definitely save this recipe and change the ingredients for a different variety. Even though the original is wonderful.( Add raisins in place of coconut and cherries etc.)  This recipes is excellent the day after baking to allow the flavors to set in.  I highly recommended waiting one day....if you can!!!

I searched for a recipe to use up my ripe bananas and leftover coconut and found this.  Now I'll be letting bananas become ripe and buying coconut just to make this recipe.  It is delicious!  Two people who tried it asked for the recipe.  That's always a sign of a great recipe!

I don't know what to say about this one. So many glowing reviews. To me it's just banana bread with coconut. Nothing really outstanding about it, nothing bad either. I didn't have any maraschino cherries so I used the same amount of chopped dried cherries. Their tartness, when I get a bite of one is pleasing, I wish there were more in the bread. I am tasting it a couple of hours after it came from the oven, I am hoping it is one of those breads that get better overnight.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I had to make this (doubling the recipe) three times in the past week! It kept disappearing! I added a few more cherries, but otherwise followed the recipe. Absolutely delicious!!

This is a great recipe, and I made this tasty moist loaf 4 times within the last 4 weeks. Since I did not have cherries on hand I used cranberries. Today I filled large muffin cups with this yummy dough.

I followed the recipe except for adding cherries which I don't care for. I was a bit apprehensive of the almond extract, but the bread turned out tasty and moist. My loaf was done in under the hour recommended. This was a real treat, highly recommend it.

I made a lot of changes to this, only because I really was using it as a basis for getting rid of some stuff  in the pantry. I ended up making it a healthier version, cutting down the butter and sugar, exchanging some of the flour for flax, etc So It was great! Really yummy. 
My changes were: Sugar (1/4 cup brown sugar Splenda blend), Butter (1/4 cup), Banana (4 lg over ripe bananas), Flour (3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup flax meal), Coconut (full cup), walnuts (used full cup of sliced honey roasted almonds instead. Omitted cherries.
In other words this recipe is really versatile. I tried to keep the liquid versus dry ratio consistent except I know that I always like more banana than any recipe seems to call for and that worked. ~ now to turn this into cookies or granola bars! :)

DELICIOUS!!!  A tad sweet for my taste, so next time I'm gonna try unsweetened coconut and maybe stevia instead of sugar.  It is a KEEPER though ;-)

Fantastic and super moist! We loved this. I added 1/4 cup applesauce, some extra coconut extract, diced apricots and chopped fresh strawberries in place of maraschino cherries. So yummy and moist!

I really enjoyed this recipe.
I did make some slight modifications for my taste. I cut the sugar in half and used half a cup of sugar instead and found it sweet enough. I used half of butter it calls for and added the missing amount in low fat sour cream to compensate for the moisture. I had no maraschino cherries on him so did not use any additional fruit. Added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon and it was delightful!

This is amazing! I'm afraid to go in the kitchen right now, or I'll eat all of it. The only thing I changed was I substituted pineapple for the cherries. It seemed like a much better fit. To me, anyway. Also, it was still a bit raw inside when the hour was up, so I baked it for and hour and 20 minutes total. I'll definitely be making this again. Super yummy!

This is one of our favorites.  I have made often in regular loaf and the smaller ones to give as gifts.  Couple of things I do that might be helpful:  I line the pan with parchment paper.  I did have trouble in the beginning removing.  Also I find the toothpick checking is not the best; often pick is dry but needs to cook longer. It is usually 50 mins in my oven.  I wait until the top is totally brown and the center feels cooked by touch.  Usually the top has beautiful cracks.  I let melted butter cool off before adding, cut the cherries with scissors, use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown, pecans.  Add the pecans to flour but wait and add cherries when there is just enough left to coat them.  No valid reason just seems to be less lumps as you gently stir into the batter.  However, I have never been able to prep and mix in less than 1/2 hour so may want to allow more time the first time.

I was jazzed to try this today, as I had 3 medium-sized very overripe bananas to use up. Meh. Not much banana or coconut flavor. I'd likely try this again with some tweaking though...perhaps using coconut extract or subbing out dark brown sugar instead of the white.

Fantastic! I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a cup of fresh mashed papaya. I figured it would be like substituting apple sauce but it was even better. Very moist and nice crunch to the crust.

Very good.  Looked at other's suggestions and added 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt, tad bit more Almond extract, chocolate chips and substituted pineapples for the m. cherries.  Turned out nice and moist and yummy.  Would make it again.  Watch to make sure edges don't burn.

i made this using fruit puree's instead of butter, and the first loaf didn't make it the day. I am now making our second loaf in two days and am using fruit puree's again and maple extract instead of almond as i used the last of my supply in the previous loaf.   Even my dog loves this! no nuts, not dried fruit or whole fruits. Fantastic base recipe to play with!

This was a great change from the typical banana bread.  It was moist, pretty, and we all really enjoyed the different blend of flavors.  The only thing we noticed was that the flavor of the nuts was a little to strong for us, so the next time I make it, I will cut back the nuts to about 1/4 cup.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed this, and I am glad I decided to give it a try. Will definately make again!

Not a big coconut fan, but when mixed with everything, it gave an extra crunch and sweetness. Yummy. The only trouble I had was that the outside got dry, and the inside didn't cook through. I'm thinking that has more to do with the baking than the actual recipe.

This was really good! I used more coconut in place of the cherries since I didn't want the recipe to cost me over $5 to make! The bread fell apart a little easier than I would've liked though.

I gave this four stars only because I didn't follow it to the letter. I used vanilla instead of almond extract and olive oil instead of melted butter. I also cut the sugar by 1/3. I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts and I skipped the cherries. The 'base' cake remained the same, however, and was absolutely divine! (I don't recommend macadamia nuts, though - didn't like the texture they gave! Walnuts or even no nuts would have been better.)

I made exactly as directed and thought the texture was perfect. All the flavors combine but don't get lost in the bread: the banana and coconut and cherry are all distinct but work well together. I don't always have milk in the house and I appreciated this didn't call for any. Thanks very much for sharing.

Good base recipe and I made some changes:   Instead of white flour I split it into half white and half whole wheat.  Instead of 2 whole eggs I used Eggbeaters  Instead of all butter I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 cup applesauce  Instead of 1 cup of all white sugar...I used 1/2 cup brown and 1/4 cup white. (just sweet enough).  I did use sweetened coconut.  I did not use almond extract or nuts (allergic) --- so I used 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. I didn't use cherries either. Instead I added in some bittersweet chocolate chips sparingly.  Made as mini-muffins and they are scrumptious!

This turned out great...but I made changes-I only used 1 banana but added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I also switched the 1/2 tsp of almond for 1tsp of lemon extract and 1 tbs of lemon zest!  I made a lemon cream cheese glaze for on top-DELICIOUS!! Lemon-coconut-banana loaf, a real keeper!

This is a lovely banana bread.  I like that it has a different flavor than your typical banana bread.  Very nice and delicate.  I baked mine for the 1 hour and that seemed about right, maybe a little too brown, but at 50 minutes, the center was not done yet.  My loaf didn't rise very much, but looking at the other photos, it appears others' didn't either (my baking powder and soda are not expired either).  Some adjustment in that area may be required, but other than that, it's a very nice recipe.  Thanks!

I used applesauce instead of oil and baked the loaf as cake in a 9x9 pan. This is a really sweet recipe! I think if I make it again I'll add more pineapple to give it a little more tang to cut the sweetness.

I LOVE this recipe! It is so much more flavorful and exciting than regular banana bread. I did make a few small changes. I left out the cherries, used sweetened coconut, subbed pecans bc I didn't have walnuts, and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. It turned out PERFECT!

This was so yummy! I did not add and nuts and fruit, just banana and coconut, and it was still perfect! I am new to baking so this was very simple and easy to follow. I had to bake longer than an hour, maybe it's my oven but it came out great- very moist, just following the recipe as is, and I will be making this again!

I needed to make muffins, so I thought this recipe would be great (with a couple of modifications of course!).  I used 3/4c wheat and 3/4c white flour and 1/4 cup wheat bran.  1/2c white 1/2c brown sugar. 1/4c butter and 1/3c applesauce.  1/4t vanilla 1/2t coconut extracts, a splash of rum, and chopped macadamia nuts. I also toasted my coconut(used a little extra) and omitted the cherries.  These babies cooked for about 25 min and holy  were they good!!! Had a great texture with the cococnut & macadamia nuts.  Nice crispy outside and moist spongy inside.  Maybe next time I will try pineapple.

This was awesome and I will definitely make it again. I did not have walnuts on hand so I used pecans. I might try macadamia nuts next time - especially if I plan on serving the bread to guests (not sure if my family is worth of macadamia nuts – ha!).

this was delicious! everyone in my family liked it, and it was fairly easy to make. i didn't have any cherries or walnuts, but i added some almonds and it was fine. i think it would taste great even without any nuts.  i'm a huge fan of banana bread, and this is one of the best i've found yet!! definitely worth making.

Okay. My parents liked it... I too, replaced half of margarine with applesauce, and used macadamias instead, omitted cherries, and used only 1/4 tsp almond extract since it's pretty strong flavoring.

I really like this recipe. It's a good one to make to give  as a gift because it's a little more special than just plain banana bread. I've doubled this and divided the batter between three 8x4 bread pans.

I really wanted to like this one!  I followed all the suggestions: 1/2 sugar 1/2 brown sugar, chocolate chips, more bananas, not as much almond extract, toasting the coconut and adding a bit more too.  It just didn't taste all that good.  It actually could have been sweeter.  Maybe tomorrow it'll taste better to me.  Thanks for the recipe though.

This is a beautifully light loaf.  I recommend using just a bit more sugar and using really ripe bananas.  I think this recipe with pineapple would be fabulous!

If you're planning on baking for Christmas, use this one!  It's gorgeous.  It's different enough to be interesting and unique, without being so weird that some won't try it.  I mostly taste the almond, nuts and cherries, the coconut is mild.  It's sweet but not TOO sweet.  I used a scant cup of sugar, probably 7/8's or so.  This is going to be printed, laminated, and put in a prominent place in my cookbook!  This would also be great for a ladies' tea, it goes great with a cup of tea.  No butter though, it's plenty moist as is and the butter would just hide the great flavor.

my soon to be 16 yr old daughter made this tonight, with pineapple instead of cherries, it is very, very good!  It smelled and looked so yummy while it was cooking that we ate it as soon as it had cooled down a bit, I'm sure tomorrow it will taste even better!

I'm always looking for something to do with old bananas..this recipe is really different.  Not the same old boring banana breads.  Used coconut extract to enhance the flavor. Moist and flavorful.  Thanks!

The banana bread itself is nothing spectacular, it's a little dry. It's the extras - the coconut, nuts, and cherries that make it great. I would like to try adding those extras to one of my favorite banana bread recipes to make a really good one.

Im'not a fan of regular banana bread, but this is really good! I did change the recipe a little by using less sugar and more coconut. I also added vanilla extract and coconut extract. A keeper for sure!

This is the moistest banana bread I have ever tried making. I decided to do mini loaves with it, and it turned out great! Depending on your climate, I would suggest only cooking it for 20-25 minutes at the temperature mentioned (This is for the mini loaves only). I didn't have almond extract, so I substituted it with 1tsp of vanilla, and a little extra coconut. We didn't add the nuts, and I used egg beaters instead of regular eggs. It was delicious!  Great recipe, and I plan making this for holiday gifts.

Great! Very moist and full of flavor! I followed most of the recipe, but made a few changes. I did not have cherries or almond flavoring. Instead, I used vanilla (1 tsp.) and and chopped up some dried mango (1/4 cup). I also substituted 3/4 Cup applesauce for the butter and added 1/4 cup sour cream for added moisture. I also added about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Okay, so I made plenty of changes, but it turned out wonderfully!
Thanks!

Very delicious! I added extra cherries and used pecans instead of walnuts. The extract makes it taste more like cake than bread- next time I may also try coconut flavor like the other reviewer.

Too many ingredients made a bit too dense.  Had a great flavor but outside was dry and inside moist and heavy.  Perhaps because I beat final ingredients in with mixer instead of folding them in.  Always tend to think I did something wrong when a recipe receives great reviews and I wasn't that impressed.  Otherwise Carol keep up the good work.

Excellent results ... I'm not big on Banana Bread, but this one will be made again, and again.  I used Macadamia nuts instead, and a little extra banana flavor.  Everyone who tried loved it!!

This bread came out great.  Really moist and tasty.  Another great recipe from Carol.  I omitted the walnuts and cherries so I could give it to my toddler.  I substituted 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and coconut extract for the almond.

I made this last night!!! Definitely scrumptious in every bite!!! This was easy to make  and came out of the oven 
looking beautiful, but I only needed to bake this at 350 for 50 minutes instead of  the 60 minutes that the recipe said., but I think it was because I have an electric stove.

I made this one time so far, and it was quickly devoured!  I used only 3/4 cup sugar(combo of raw sucanat and turbinado), and it was plenty sweet enough.  I used 3 bananas (that had been previously frozen), which was a bit more than 1 cup.  I also had frozen strawberries on hand, so thawed and used them instead of cherries.  I will make again soon!

This banana bread is so moist.  My husband and daughter loves it.  The two things I did differently was add 1/2 teaspoon of banana extract and omitted the cherries.  Great recipe!

This is a really good alternative to a plain banana bread.  I did make one substitution.  I used frozen cranberries instead of the cherries.   One thing I would change is to eliminate the almond flavoring because I think it overpowered the flavor of the coconut.

I made this exactly as recipe suggested, except that I doubled the recipe. Loved the coconut cherry flavours together.  I gave one of the loves to a friend and she and her family loved it also.   Making it again today, but will not be giving any away!!  I will also make a doubled recipe and taking it to my mother-in-laws at Christmas to have with coffee during gift opening Christmas morning. She is 94 and loves to try new recipes. Great flavour and will definitely make it again!!

I love banana bread, but not sugar and flour.  I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/3 cup pineapple tidbits instead of the sugar. And I used coconut flour 3/4 cup, instead of reg. flour. I also lined my pan with parchment paper and lowered temp to 300 and baked 70 min. It was perfect.

Used brown sugar rather than white, about 3/4 cup. Did not add cherries or nuts. Also browned the butter which gives it a beautiful nutty flavour. Really nice loaf! Everyone loved it!

absolutely amazing, blew my friends and family away. I decided to leave out the baking powder and cherries and separate the eggs, it still turned out really good!

I tried this recipe and it was ok, followed the recipe as stated.  I will try the recipe but this time I have read other comments, and I will use some of their suggestions.  That is what this sight is all about feedback and trying to make this recipe even better.  Next time I will use a combo brown sugar and regular sugar to make 3/4 cup.  Keep the coconut then add 1/4 tsp each coconut extract and vanilla extract and use pecans.  I thought about adding my twist in the mix, I love raisins.  One comment was that the bread was dry, maybe putting in some of the juice from the cherries.  Another comment that somebody said was that the bread fell apart, maybe add some non stick cooking spray, or adding more spray.  Respectfully, Sylvia

Added raisins in place of cherries.  Added almond/toasted coconut glaze to cooled loaf.  Would definitely make again.  Delicious.

I've made a lot of banana bread and I rarely add a new recipe, but this one made the cut.  Since I had sweetened coconut I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and left out the walnuts and cherries (didn't have any) and increased the coconut to 1 cup. to make up the difference.

Lovely! Very moist with an everso slightly crunchy crust which was delightful! Just made it and didn't change a thing (apart from reducing the time in the oven to 50 mins as it was done).

Very good yet I'd like to make again to increase moisture. 
Used 1/2 cup crushed pineapple instead of cherries. 
Really should have used aluminum foil on top so it would prevent top from turning too dark.

This turned out fantastic. I added applesauce so that it wasn't as dry. I used coconut extract to which gave it just even more coconut flavor.

I baked this in my slow cooker. I just wanted to see if it would turn out. It took about 4 hours and came out looking good and was about the best recipe I have tried. Absolutely delicious. I did use applesauce for half the butter and cut sugar in half and used half granulated and half brown. I used pecans because that was what I had on hand and used 1/2 cup more coconut.

Great recipe! I was looking for something to use up some old bananas.  I made a couple of revisions.  I used whole-wheat flour as it's all I had in the house.  I also used frozen blueberries instead of cherries, and sprinkled some coconut on top while it baked which gave it a nice toasted crunch on top.   It turned out nice a moist inside, and a little crunch on the outside!  Delicious.

This is my new favorite recipe!!!!! I adore it!! It's almost too delicious, I could not stop eating it.  I believe the recipe would be perfect as it is, but for MY tastes I doubled the almond extract, added EXTRA banana, and since I didn't have cherries I used Blueberry-Crazins.  ONE THING: As one reviewer said, the bread doesn't hold together perfectly, so maybe if you are making this for an event it's not the best recipe, it can crumble a bit--- but since I was going for TASTE it didn't matter to me. The bread was moist, and with the chew from the crazins, crispy top and walnuts....it was HEAVENLY. I'm making it for my dear nephew who is away at college in Maine. Hope he loves it as much as I did.

Delicious! I did make some changes, though. Here they are: 
I subbed GF flour. Added 2tsp of xantham gum to prevent crumbling. Subbed chopped, pitted, fresh cherries for maraschino cherries. I also added about a half cup of coconut milk to help with moisture.  I think it's my new fave banana bread recipe!

Like many others I made a few changes. I used gluten free 1 to 1  baking flour, it worked really well. I also  took the advice of others and cut the butter in half , substituting  unsweetened applesauce, also substituted fresh strawberries for the cherries. I would opt for not adding walnuts next time and maybe cutting back a bit on the sugar,   I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!  This was good.  The only changes I made was:  I/2 c white sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar instead of all white, 2 c
banana instead of 1 & coconut flavoring instead of almond.
Terrific!  I will definitely will be making this again.

Great loaf! The only thing I did differently was toasted the coconut and walnuts in the oven before adding to flour mixture. Really liked the added crunch. Will definitely make again!

Pretty good. It's not the best I've had, but it's definitely not the worst. I left the nuts out, and added chocolate chips.

Very flavorful loaf! I didn't have cherries so I substituted with pineapple chunks that I cut into small pieces. I found it on the dry side although it was airy so next time I will probably add applesauce or lessen the flour. Will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Just baking now, smells wonderful. Pretty much used the ingredients but substituted ground oatmeal for 1/2 the flour and left off the cherries. Already dumped all wet ingredients in a bowl before reading directions (opps) so I hope it turns out.  Started to smell really done at 45 minutes so turned the temp down to 325 to cook longer since it is not set in the center.  Baked for just over 60 minutes. Fabulous,  Did not cool but cut into and ate right away.

So freaking good!! I had the urge to bake something and I had all of the ingredients on hand. The only changes I made were... 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C of white sugar, only used vanilla extract and I toasted my walnuts and coconut. I also threw in a 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Heavenly!! Will definitely be making again!

Excellent! I substituted pineapple for cherries, cut back on the sugar (there is plenty of sweetness already) and split coconut oil and butter, rather than adding all the butter.  Very good! Will definitely make it again.

I am not a big fan of banana bread but I carefully read a lot of the reviews and went for it. I had some very ripe bananas but I didn't have nuts or cherries. I went on without those items. I did half sugar and half brown sugar. My husband loved it and I liked it too. It is sweeter than other banana breads I've had and I like the coconut in it. I will try with pecans and cherries or even cranberries. I think that I might even try raisins or chocolate too.

The loaf was moist and light. The coconut adds to the texture of the loaf by making it less dense or bread like. It soft and great for a afternoon snack

This is a great alternative to simple banana loaf. I too made this as muffin instead. Added vanilla extract, used brown sugar instead and omitted the cherries and nuts.  Very moist. ??

Nummy!  I made a few changes, though.  I made muffins, not a loaf, so my cooking time was about 20 mins.  I used only 1/3 brown sugar + 1/3 cup table sugar, and they were still very sweet.  I also substituted 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds, 1/4 cup of oat bran, & 1/4 cup of wheat germ for 3/4 cup of the flour.  And I used egg replacer powder instead of egg and 1/4 cup canola oil + 1/4 cup applesauce instead of butter. And I added chocolate chips instead of nuts.

Changes: added  3.9 oz. cup (single serving) Mott's natural applesauce; used vanilla instead of almond flavoring; used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white; used sweetened coconut; topped lightly with coconut; no nuts or cherries (husband not a fan); perfect. Family says, best banana bread ever.

Very, very good!! Made some changes after reading the reviews...1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar; 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. apple sauce; 1 1/2 c. gluten-free flour mix + 1 1/8 tsp. xanthum gum. Use drained, crushed pineapple instead of the cherries. Will be making this often. Thank you for the start of a new favorite.

Sooooo good!  I did not use cherries or nuts, but I did sprinkle some chocolate chips on top of a couple of my mini loaves.  Yum!  I also used coconut extract and sprinkled extra coconut on top of the loaves.  I lightened it up by using a combo of no sugar added applesauce, Greek yogurt, and a tiny bit of canola oil instead of the fat, and used egg whites.

This is insanely good! I made it just as written, but also glazed it with a small amount of powdered sugar, water and almond extract immediately after taking it out of the oven before turning it out of the pan to cool. I've found a new favorite banana bread recipe!

Absolutely delicious, and beautiful bread! I made it as written, and loved the pop of color the cherries added. I did use melted coconut oil rather than butter but that was the only change. I might try to cut back on the sugar next time as I feel it is a bit too sweet. Also make sure to grease the pan well as it sticks a bit.

Made this and brought it to work, it got rave reviews. I substituted pomegranet craisins for the maraschino cherries, cut the butter in half and used 1/4 cup applesauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delish! I followed recipe almost exactly, only adding a handful of chocolate chips for fun and subsituting vanilla extract, as I didn't have almond. Boy, the smell alone was intoxicating enough to make me forget about the gift recipients this was for...then when I tasted a crumb that got stuck to the pan, I knew I was in danger of having to make another batch! I used mini loaf pans and got 3 out of this recipe. I did not have any problems with dryness/crumbling as some other reviewers did. My boyfriend insists that I make this for us often, now!

This has become my go-to recipe for banana bread.  I have tried a lot of banana breads, but the almond extract really makes this one stand out.  I don't add the nuts or cherries, just personal preference.  It always goes over well when I take it to work.

2 words... LOVED IT! I had to make some changes due to my diet and to adjust it to what I had: I subbed the fructose for the sugar (can't eat sugar) but reduced it to 70g instead of 200g. I subbed homemade applesauce (just cooked the apples-with the skin on-with a tiny bit of water till soft and pureed them) for the butter, I didn't add the cherries nor the almond extract since I didn't have any and I did 150g of whole wheat flour and for the remaining flour I used soy flour (I am vegetarian so I try to incorporate protein whenever I can) and baked it for 1h at 150C (when adding soy flour the temperature must be lower). I know, I know quite a bit of changes but the loaf still turned out great! Thank you so much!!! I will be making it again... and again and again!

This was pretty good.  I used coconut oil (1/3 c) instead of butter added about 1/2 c of applesauce.  I did not add cherries - I think next time I would add raisins.  I wish it had looked prettier - it barely rose at all.  Maybe I'll add more baking powder next time too.   I mill my own flour, so my loaf was whole wheat, but it wasn't heavy and was very tender.    With the coconut oil, it definitely tasted coconuty.  A nice change from regular banana bread.  Mine was nice and moist - no problems with it being dry like some other reviewers - but I watched it really close - I think I ended up baking it for 56 minutes.

Oh, yum. My mother always makes banana bread with maraschino cherries, walnuts and cho. chips. Without additions such as these, banana bread is boring as heck. Very good recipe.

I made this for an event that needed some breakfast goodies. I chose not to put the nuts in it because of all the nut allergies that are around.  And I didn't have the cherries. My loaf got way to dark before it was done. And it was not easy to get out of the pan. The bottom tore. Flavor was nice and moist. I added 1/4 teaspoon of cocconut extract and 1/4 of vanilla instead of the almond extract.

This was awesome! I only split the sugar (50% white, 50% brown), doubled the walnuts, and omitted the cherries.  After trying this, I must say I ditched my other banana bread recipes. Can't keep it once I it's made.

What a great twist on banana bread!  I made as directed, except that I did decrease the total amount of sugar to 3/4 c. (used half white/half brown).  Mine needed the full hour to bake, though I did cover the last 10 minutes to prevent the top from getting too brown.  Very good!

Very nice bread.  A little sweet for me, but I'm a bit of a sugarphobe.  It does look very pretty.  Oddly enough, my bread took a lot longer than stated--about an hour and 20 minutes.  I guess I'm had the opposite problem than other reviewers who felt it could come out more quickly than the recipe stated.  It must all be because our ovens are different.  Other than decreasing the sugar a tad, I would make this again without major changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  Followed recipe only exchanging the walnuts for pecans.  The cooking time was too long. I put it in for 50 min and it could have come out at about 45 minutes.  Coconut is subtle and the cherries gave a little extra sweetness.

I made this as muffins and reduced the cooking time.  I really liked them.  I was skeptical because of the cherries, but they added a really good flavor that was unique.

I have made lots of banana bread recipes and this one just wasn't very good. The only thing I didn't do was add the cherries. I was really looking forward to this but was disappointed. There was not enough banana flavor and I couldn't taste the coconut. I used unsweetened coconut flakes and maybe I should have used sweetened. Overall, this was a bland quick bread.

This was delicious!  The coconut gives it a tropical flavor, which is nice for a change.  I have made it twice now, used walnuts once and pecans the second time.

REALLY good banana brea with a twist. I used the 1/2 cup each of brown and white sugar and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla as others suggested. I also omitted the cherries and used "flaked" organic coconut.

This was the first recipe I've ever tried from allrecipes with HUGE success.  I took the suggestions from others to reduce almond extract to 1/4 tsp and add a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. I ended up using 4 medium sized bananas which yielded slightly more than 1 c.   I left out the cherries and nuts and baked for an hour.  It was absolutely perfect.  My husband and I both loved this recipe and I will definitely use it again.  It was delicious warmed up on its own or with butter or cream cheese.

Very tasty and a nice alternative to regular banana bread, but I'd make a few changes next time.  I'd cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, cut the almond extract down to 1/4 teaspoon, use unsweetened coconut, use pecans or macademia nuts, and replace the maraschino cherries with either pineapple chunks or dried cranberries that have been presoaked.  Also, this loaf didn't rise at all after baking...not like I was expecting.  This didn't bother me at first, but then it even sank a little after cooling.  Will still make again with modificaitons, though.

I was looking for something to make with my bananas besides the "same old banana bread".  This was a great choice.  I did read the reviews and took ya'lls advice.  I didn't have applesauce so I chopped up a little apple to add the moisture many of you thought it needed.  Also, didn't have any cherries so I added dried cranberries...yum!!!

This bread is FANTASTIC!!!  I used unsalted real butter since I had that on hand and it came out great!  My step-daughter had a piece and said "OMG, this is my favorite!"  Might go a bit scant on the 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  Other than that, absolute perfection!  Glad I tried it.  This one is definitely a keeper for holiday mini loaf gifts.

Thank you!!!

Excellent!  I made the variation with lemon zest, as I didn't have the cherries, and the combination of flavors is sooo good.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour, left out the walnuts, increased the coconut, had over a cup of mashed banana, and decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup.  It was still plenty sweet and had a very moist texture.  A new favorite!

This is a really simple recipe that can be easily adjusted depending on your tastes.  I replaced the butter entirely with sweetened applesauce to cut the fat, and used yellow sugar instead of white for a little extra flavour.  I replaced the cherries with strawberries, as that was what I had around the house.  I did find the coconut flavour a bit over-powering, though, so I think in the future I would use a cup of strawberries and a cup and a half of banana, and reduce the coconut by a half.  I would also like to try it in the future using raspberries!

Once again I am not sure if I should even review the recipe or not because of the many changes that I made but the 4 stars are for the coconut/banana combination... I love banana nut bread and I love coconut and I have never thought to put the two together??? The combination is delicious! So for those who are interested the changes I made were to use all whole wheat flour, canola oil instead of butter (no cholesterol) and I didn't use the whole amount stated in the recipe, 3/4 cup cane sugar, 1/2 a cup of fat free yogurt instead of two eggs (again no cholesterol), and vanilla extract instead of almond. I now have a much healthier recipe with absolutely no reduction in taste. Thanks!

It's good...maybe a tad too sweet for me. But everyone else loved it. It lasted a day. I used a scant 3/4 cup of light brown sugar. If I make it again, I'm just going to use 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. But this recipe is a great way to use up extra coconut flakes.

Very good!  A nice change from the regular old banana bread.

Very good, but not a very strong coconut flavor. I added more coconut than called for, but will probably add extract next time too.

hmmm...i think an hour was too long in my oven, the loaf turned out pretty dry, and that made me sad.:(
but the flavour was nice, i used pineapple instead of cherries and a little extra coconut.  I wonder how adding some applesauce would change it, maybe it would make it more moist.  Thanks!

We omited the cherries and it still came out pretty nice - it wasnt too heavy and the coconut added a nice touch too. I'm not normally a fan of Banana loaf.

Nice and moist.  I followed the recipe exactly and was pleased.  The only difference was that mine was well done after 40 minutes.  I reduced the temp half way through because it was already starting to burn.  My fault for not paying attention to what pan I used....  Next time I will try toasting the coconut first and maybe adding a little spice--but really, the recipe is great as-is!

Ladies at my church cafe love this. They suggested that I start taking orders for it. I get asked to make it every week now and there is great disappointment if I don,t. It is moist and sweet. Quite an unusual banana bread. Well worth a try.

I was looking for a recipe that uses coconut, and im a big fan of loaves.. and this is what popped up! I read some of the reviews and decided to try it! IT turned out great and very tastey, a type of banana loaf sweetened with cocconut! My family has decided that its a great PICNIC loaf!

This bread is really yummy!  I had all of the ingredients on hand and wanted to use them up so that was a plus.  My only alteration to the recipe was to add 1/4 cup of buttermilk since a couple reviews said it was dry.  Also the loaf wasn't very tall so next time I make it I will use an 8 by 4 pan instead of 9 by 5.  This bread, like most, tastes better the next day.  I chopped the nuts and the maraschino cherries in the food processor and that made them just the right size.  This is one of my new favorite breads. I supposed you could use macadamia nuts for a more "tropical" loaf.  Wonderful recipe, thanks!!!

Good recipe. I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and reduced the sugar content. Added more coconut (shavings instead of flake) and almonds. A moist and flavourful bread. Will keep this recipe. Thank you.

This is awesome!  I was looking for a new recipe using overripe bananas and I found the best banana bread ever.  I left out the almond extract and used 1 t coconut extract instead and used the entire jar of cherries.  I cut the cherries and the nuts in large pieces.  Every bite is a delight.

This was excellent!  I didn't have any coconut, so I substituted coconut milk.  It made the bread sweet, but it tasted great.  I'll definately make this again.

This is a very pretty and flavorful banana bread.  I have discovered that it is a "love it or hate it" recipe.  I love it, my sons love it, my daughter and husband HATE IT.  I have had to cook the bread longer than called for every time I made it, so you might want to try that.

really tasty, even without the cherries.  And I also used just vanilla (the real deal, not flavoring).  I also added extra coconut and pecans--YUM!  So good and moist.

This was nice.  I liked the coconut though I agree with other users that it needed a bit more. This made several tasty breakfasts on the run.  We will make it again soon.

Very tasty, moist bread.  I think I was expecting it to be a little less like banana bread--the flavor of the cherries, almond and coconut were hardly detectable through the banana.  It was delicious banana bread nonetheless!

This is a very good recipe.  I did add additional flavoring (vanilla), more coconut(a heaping 1/2 cup) and a whole cup of walnuts.  I also made it with Canola oil instead of butter because my daughter is alergic to dairy products.  It turned out great and she really loved it!

I used Vanilla and I omtted the cherries. Watch the time though, mine started

This banana bread was truely moist and everyone in my family loved it.  I added banana extract in lieu of the almond extract to give it a truer banana taste.  Glad I did.  Would definitely make this again!

So delicious & moist!  I also added in some dried cranberries before baking to give it an extra sweetness.

Our finicky son that won't eat coconut and nuts loved this banana bread.  One loaf of bread only lasted us 1 1/2 days.  We ate it for breakfast and for dessert.  This is definitely a recipe that we will use over and over.  Wonderful!

My whole family loved it!  I am addicted and have made it several times now.  It's really moist.  I made it in my mini-loaf pan so I don't have to wait as long to eat it.

excellent recipe!  I couldn't wait for it to get out of the oven.  Burned my fingers tasting it.  Yum!  Smells and tastes divine!
