I call this dip buffalo chicken dip and it is GREAT!!! I usually bake the chicken since boiling it makes a mess of the pan. I marinate the shredded chicken in Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce. While that's happening, mix a bar of cream cheese and a jar of MARIE's blue cheese OR ranch dressing together. Then layer that mixure and the shredded chicken in a cassarole dish with shredded chedda on top. 350 for 20-30 minutes, good to go! I am ready for some FOOTBALL.

My daughter made this for a bridal shower and what a hit.  The only difference is that we put all the ingrediants into the crock pot and let simmer.  Oh yum yum yum. Keeps it hot and doesn't last long.  We even double the recipe.

We make this recipe for all of our Steeler games. We don't use fresh chicken, but cooked canned.  That makes the recipe faster to prepare.

A friend brought this over for a potluck, and it was delicious. I tried making it again the next day with canned chicken instead of poached/shredded and did not like the results as much. Canned chicken makes the texture too goopy and paste-like, and we much preferred the chewy bits of chicken in the original recipe. I did like one thing better, though, and that was mixing most of the cheese in with the rest of the ingredients and only adding a small sprinkle on top. Otherwise it hardens once it's cool into a waxy layer that makes dipping difficult.

I make this all the time and People Rave over it! It's so easy and good. I have, however, found that it doesnt warm up as well with the cheese on top.

We love this dip around my house!  I use pulled leftover roasted chicken (actually, that recipe is on here too - its called Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style)  and I also use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and toss in some blue cheese crumbles too.  We like to eat it with tortilla chips.  It always disappears quick!!

Every time I make this dip, people RAVE about it and I end up passing along the recipe to at least three people! I also do 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese. It gives a nice balance of flavors. The crock pot is a great way to let the flavors blend together, but make sure to stir it often to avoid the oils sitting on top. Overall, this recipe is super-easy to make... and DELICIOUS! (We have also spread this on grilled pizza dough and made buffalo pizza out of it! YUM!)

Awesome! Made this yesterday and it was great. The only thing I changed was the dressing and used half ranch and half blue cheese and I made it in the crock pot. One thing to note and I should have known better but I had company and was sidetracked.. keep a watch on the heat. We mistakenly cranked this up to high since everyone was so anxious to eat it and within a minute or two, it completely separated.

I have been making this for years, we call it Chicken Wing Dip, and everyone loves it. I usually use cooked canned chicken and then bake it, its less messy and much faster!

I just took this dip to a New Year's party and everyone loved it - especially the teenagers!  I mixed in some of the cheddar cheese then put it in the crock of a small crock pot, topped with more cheese and put it in the oven for 15 minutes, then took it with me to the party.  The crock pot kept it warm and it was YUMMY!  I'll definitely be making this recipe again - very soon, if my daughter has anything to say about it!

This was wonderful. I eat a little healthier and so I used fat free ranch, fat free cream cheese, and low fat cheddar and it turned out great. I cooked the chicken in the crock pot for 8 hours on low and it was easy to shred. Then I just added the other ingredients into the crock pot and mixed. It was ready quickly and everyone raved about it (they didn't even know it was reduced fat).

I actually used a cup or so of last night's leftover turkey as that was what I had on hand that was ready to go. I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix combined with a cup of reduced fat sour cream. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. I threw everything into my small crockpot right after breakfast and set it to go until the boys were ready to snack. Super easy, GREAT pantry/fridge-cleaner-outer dip and the boys just fell in love with it. Thanks for sharing!

So good! We made it to satisfy our junk food craving. We used buffalo sauce instead of hot sauce. Didn't measure it. Just kept adding it and tasting it until we got the right flavor. It gave it the yummy buffalo flavor without making it too hot for our kids to eat. We also used more than a pound of chicken which made it thicker. Very very yummy!!!

Great recipe and great combination of flavors!  This recipe is going to be a keeper for sure.  To chop the chicken, I used my food chopper, which helped get the chicken to a nice size and able to be tasted throughout with no big chunks.  For the hot pepper sauce, I used "Frank's Red Hot" which seems to have the best flavor, no strong vinegar taste.  Some guests were a little nervous about trying it saying they had it before, and it wasn't that good.  They tasted this recipe, and immediate raved about it.  This does make a large amount of dip.  I had 14 people eating it and this was plenty.  Delicious!

Pretty good, but too "cheddary" so I used a Mexican Blend Cheese the next time and thought it was much better.

I also used canned chicken, as I had that on hand and could make the recipe right away. It is wonderful hot out of the oven, but pretty bad when reheated. Just be sure to eat it all up at once!

Terrrific!!! Next time I will have too double it though, goes too fast!! Here's what I did.. I shredded a cooked rotisserie chicken, put that right in the crockpot. Added the cream cheese, mix that up good. Then I used 1/2 blue cheese dressing and 1/2 ranch to equal 1 cup. I also used Franks buffalo wing sauce instead of just red hot sauce. Then added 2 cup of Mexican shredded cheese right on top. Only after about 10-15 minutes on low, the cheese was melted and the dip stayed warm. It wasn't around for long though!!! It wasn't enough for my 6 guests!! they wanted more. Thanks.

This is a GREAT recipe! I have made this three times in two weeks and everyone raves about it. The first two times I used the Frank's Red Hot sauce, the third time I used the Hooter's 3 mile island hot sauce and this was THE recipe for me. Everyone was practically licking the bowl! Thank you so much for this recipe!

this dip is SO GOOD!!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I find it is much better & easier to prepare if you just drain and add a big can of chicken to this dip rather than spend the effort cooking chicken breast.  Serve with a giant bowl of Frito Scoops!!!  YUM  :o]

A good recipe and i will make it again but there was way too much cheese on top and it just sat there in a bug lump.  Next time I will mix some of the cheese into the mixture and put only a small amount on top.  We ate this with tortilla chips, celery, and carrots.

I'm not sure why it is called Hot Wing Dip, because I wouldn't use it for wings, but maybe because of the mixture it gets its name.  I loved this.  I used Hooters Hot Sauce.  I would make it again without the cheddar cheese on top.  In fact, when I heated it up a second time, I scopped off the cheese.  It doesn't look appetizing and frankly adds loads of calories and fat.  I used this dip for veggies and tortilla chips.  I will definitely make this again and again, but no cheese on top.

I doubled this recipe and if I were to do again, I probably wouldn't double the ranch dressing.  A little too "ranchy" for me.  Mixed it up and put it in a crockpot.  Very yummy.  A little blue cheese crumble on top right before serving would be a nice touch.

This dip is really really good. I may have used too much chicken because it was probably thicker than it should have been, and therefore really did not look appetizing at all. However, it really does taste amazing! Didn't reheat well for me, but again I think it was just because the dip was so thick. Will be making again soon for sure!

This dip is delicious! I used canned chicken breasts instead, and it worked out just as good. It was definitey a big hit at my party.

I tried this recipe last night to see if it would be a football favorite in my house. All the guys in my house liked it- so it'll be a go.  I loved that it was so simple to make. I'm the more picky eater and thought it was missing a little something. Next time I'll add some diced jalapenos.

This recipe is awesome!! I made it tonight for a football game and my husbands friends ALL loved it!! It's got a kick , but not too spicy so everyone could eat it. It even tastes great when you eat it up late night!! My husband was alittle worried when I told him I was going to try this, but he loved it more than anyone? Even men were asking me for this recipe!! It's a must for a football party!!

Very tasty!  I used less hot sauce, maybe 1/3 c, as I was serving it to a crowd and I wasn't sure about everyone's spice level. well everyone loved it and nobody thought it was too hot!  Next time I'll add the full amount, to compare.  Easy and good.

We love this. I followed the recipe but  used the slow cooker after boiling  the chicken. Shred or chop the chicken per preference then toss it all in and cook on low. It's ready whenever you want and the slow cooker keeps it warm for repeated servings.  I think we cooked it for at least one hour to blend the flavors.

I have never been asked for a recipe so many times!
Last night I cooked the chicken breasts according to directions, shredded the chicken and put it in a large bowl. To the chicken, I added the ranch dressing and the blue cheese dressing as well as the wing sauce (commenters suggested the half ranch/half blue cheese combination and also the wing sauce instead of hot sauce and that appealed to me since I don't like especially hot food).
This morning before work, I added the cream cheese (mine wasn't softened last night so I added it this morning), and 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese.   I put it all in a crock pot (as suggested by commenters), stirred it well and took it to work. To speed the heating, I started it on high and stirred it every 15 minutes or so to avoid having it separate. When the cheeses were melted I turned the crock pot to low and served.
This dip was the biggest hit! People went back multiple  times for more.  THANK YOU for making me look like a great cook!

A big hit at our Super Bowl Party! The only changes I made- I used half mozzarella and half cheddar  and half blue cheese dressing and half ranch....I just threw it all in a mini-crockpot. Worked perfectly!

I have been making this a LONG time. If you don't have leftover chicken and are in a rush, you can use (gasp!) canned chicken, nobody knows the difference once it's cooked. And I've been known to use mozzarella as well... Very easily changed recipe. Only big suggestion is that you use Frank's Red Hot sauce to get the best flavor, tobacco is just too much, you lose the dip flavor with it... But I make a HUGE batch, about triple this recipe, and it is always gone! Sleepover favorite for teen boys!

Honestly the greatest dip I have EVER had! Beats any restaurant appetizer! Made this for my boyfriend for the Super Bowl and it was impossible to stop eating it! Took the leftovers to work and couldn't keep the coworkers away from my desk!! Just be sure to stir it after it comes out of the oven so the cheese doesn't harden on top! Favorite recipe!

Great dip! I used precooked grilled chicken, chopped up.  I made homemade ranch dressing.  I doubled the cream cheese & hot sauce (Franks Red Hot). I used and extra 1/2 cup of Ranch, but left the chicken & cheddar cheese amounts the same.  I put all ingrediants together in a crock pot and set on medium until melted all together... stirred and then set to low for the remainder of the party.  I served it with assorted crackers.  All my girlfriends loved it and wanted recipe... I almost was ashamed to say how easy it was! I love crockpots!

THE BEST!! I had two packages of thin chicken breast cutlets that I boiled, shredded and added the remaining ingredients. My husband and sons got home just in time from a day out on the water. I did make twice the amount and came up with two pans. The first pan went as fast as a blink of the eye!! The second pan has a pretty big dent in it also! I have a feeling that the leftover will not make it to tomorrow!!

I made this recipe but used some left over hot wings from a restaurant so I didn't have to use the hot sauce.  It was a huge hit.  We go to the hot  wings restaurant on the bogof night and order so we have  extras just so we can make this recipe.  I've had so many requests for the recipe!

Excellent!  Everyone loved this!  I followed the recipe mostly, using low fat ingredients where possible.  I also used Frank's red hot for the hot sauce.  Then I used pre-cooked diced chicken to make it easier.  Heat in the microwave and then put into a crock pot- delicious!

Pretty good.  I wanted to keep the dip warm so I threw it in the microwave and then in a minicrockpot.  I used 3 baked chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken because I didn't want to run to the store and had the chicken on hand.  Will try it in the oven next time to see if I like it better.

I actually use canned chicken, the more the better, and I usually shred the chicken a bit. Also, I end up just putting it all in a big crock pot, mixing it up, (all but 1 bag of cheese), and put the remaining cheese on top. Set the Crock Pot to high, and leave it be for about 45 minutes, to get it all nice and bubbly. Just keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn, and you have the best dip ever!!

I too make this with canned chicken and use a 1/2 c of both hot sauce and ranch (or blue cheese).  I serve with celery.  Also, a very good option is to micro melt the ingredients with out the cheddar then mix in the cheese at the end and spread on both sides of a crusty bakery bread loaf split down the middle.  Broil until bubbly and add a lot of shredded cheese, this is a fantastic sandwich and very easy!!

The dip itself was really tasty. I just wasn't that crazy about all of the cheese the just sat on top. Maybe I'll use a little less cheese next time or will mix it in. Over all pretty good. Hubby enjoyed it also.

This was excellent and so easy to make, my children and me absolutely loved it, there were no left overs.  The only thing I did a little different was I grilled the chicken instead of cooking it in water, then shredded it.
