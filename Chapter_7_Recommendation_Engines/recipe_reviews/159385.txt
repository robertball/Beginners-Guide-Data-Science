Great mix of flavors, you are right about draing the chicken spinach mixture though. I think you could also do without the water if your chicken mix has enough moisture in it before you add spinach it is just something you have to eyeball.

This recipe was excellent!  Very tasty and easy to prepare.  It was obvious to me that the chicken mixture needed to be drained first before putting it onto the pizza.  Thanks for sharing this, I will definitely make it again!

good flavors but too much water added with the spinach made the chicken/spinach mixture very watery and the crust was extremely soggy.  It was a globby mess.

Very very good.  I'd use less spinach and gorgonzola though, and add more chicken (just my tastes).  We omitted the onion and tomato (again, just our tastes).

I used my own pizza crust and homemade sauce which improves the flavors greatly but if you don't have the time for that, I still liked the combo of toppings in his recipe.  Go ahead and give it a try.

Delicious! My 4 year old who is a very picky eater even ate it! In odrer to avoid toppings being too juicy, I found that there was no need to add water with spinach. It cooked down just fine without it.
