Following the directions, this was good but not fantastic.  It definitely needed doctoring up.  I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, garlic salt, onion powder, cayenne pepper and mushrooms and it was very tasty!  I also substituted the milk with beef broth for less calories.  Next time I am thinking of adding a can of diced tomatoes and som Dijon as well.  I will be making again with the modifications.

I used a bag of Green Giant riced cauliflower & sweet potato instead of the canned potato. It really was good!

Delicious!  Used fresh shredded potatoes instead of the canned.  Also added a small amount of instant potatoes to thicken a bit. Will definitely make again

This is delicious!  Used 4 cups beef broth, in place of milk, did not add potatoes.  Stirred in 1/2 cup sour cream right before serving.
