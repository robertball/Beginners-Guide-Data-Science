Both my husband and I loved this recipe! the chicken was tender and juicy and the panko gave it a nice crisp crust. It did have a mild flavor but the Mayo tang kept it from being boring. Easy enough to add a little extra spice if you want more of a kick!

I used chicken tenderloins instead of thighs and non-fat yogurt instead of mayo. It came out great. Delicious.

Turned out really good. I used Italian bread crumbs and instead of siping the chicken in the breadcrumbs I just placed the chicken in the baking dish, spread the mayo mix over the top and sprinkled the breadcrumbs over all.

Absolutely delicious!!! I added garlic salt to the Mayo, and added some basil, parsley and garlic salt to the panko mixture for a bit more flavor.  It came out super tasty and very quick and easy to prepare. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was really good-especially loved by my almost three year old grandson who ate an entire large chicken thigh and asked for more! I used whole wheat panko and the chicken was very moist. The coating didn’t adhere to the chicken as well as I had hoped but still it was quick and easy. I will make this again!

Would definitely make again. used boneless, skinless thighs at same temp, but at 30 minutes. Would use a baking sheet that raises the chicken up for 360 crispiness.

My husband would have given this a 3, but I'm giving it a 4 because for families with little kids this would have been better than for adults with a flair for flavor!  I started out with 1/2 cup of mayo and added some chipotle mayo rather than paprika( I did add paprika to the top before baking it), and half a cup was right for us with the four thighs.  The panko did take the whole 3/4 cup.  I wish I would have used some of my favorite Papa's Seasoning from this site before dipping into the panko mixture.   Thanks, Brad!

Added seasoned salt to the mayo and the panko and used fresh garlic mixed into the mayo instead of powder. Turned out great!

Very good and moist. Never thought of using mayo to cook chicken but this made it very moist and tasty. Very easy to make too. This is now a staple at our home. Used cornflakes crumbs just because we like it better.

This chicken is so moist and flavorful!! I  slathered the skinless thighs with a mixture of mayo, dry ranch and a couple squirts of siracha. Put them in a baking dish sprayed with cooking spray, then sprinkled with panko and garlic powder. I was shocked when I cut into one at the moisture and tenderness. The flavor was excellent. My picky husband said it was the best baked chicken he had ever eaten. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!

Yum, will be doing this on a regular basis. I did use half and half mayo and sour cream though, as that is what I had. And I used smoked paprika rather than the  common type.

Super yummy recipe, but with some changes. I had two boneless, skinless chicken thighs left from another recipe I didn't want to go to waste. I thought I could make this recipe work and it did.
I sprinkled the thighs that had been dried with paper towels with Old Bay seasoning, garlic salt , pepper (more Old Bay than the others). I used 3-4 Tblsp. mayo and 1/2 tsp. paprika, rubbed on thighs, covered with saran wrap and put in frig for a 1/2 hour.  
When ready to cook, I sprinkled panko on each side and pushed it in. 
Cooked at 325 for 20 minutes, flipping half way. Super yum.

Tasty and easy! Also good base for some doctoring up. I used Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs, and added a couple of tablespoons of coarse grain mustard to the mayonnaise.

This is delicious and super easy! I've made it twice. I substituted pesto for the  mayo the first time and siracha hummus for the mayo the second time.  I don't like mayo and usually use a mayo substitute ( pesto, hummus, Greek yogurt).

Hooray!  (I actually got a photo resized somehow!) BUT I also found a dish that works!  For me!  I looked at the other reviews and went by their recommendations.  Used maybe 3/4 cup of mayo (that was plenty for 8 thighs), added Garlic salt and Tony Chachere seasoning; I actually had Panko breadcrumbs in my pantry! That weren't stale!  Amazing! It WAS a mess like somebody said but easy to clean up and it came out delicious!  Doubly Amazing!  It's a keeper!

Wonderful crispy on the outside and tender meat on the inside  with this recipe.  I used a ranch dressing mixed with the mayo, and it was delicious.

I used chicken breasts cut thin and added a few spices to the mayo mixture! Family (2, 6, and 37 year olds) love it! Thank you for my new ‘go to’ dinner recipe!

Simply delicious. Family really liked it a lot, and it's hard to get them to like chicken thigh recipes!

It turned out yummy. A bit messy when putting it together but it was very moist, the garlic powder wasn't overpowering. My 2 yr old granddaughter ate it up.

I made this for the first time for dinner tonight. It was quite tender and juicy but the flavors were rather bland despite the addition of 1 tsp ground cayenne and 1tsp tandoori seasoning. I probably will 
try it again with cumin and/or other additional flavors and salt. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe for which I had all the ingredients so that I didn't have to run to the grocery store. This recipe takes things that you have on hand, and it is very easy. Only a little preparation and then it's in the oven. Next time I'll use boneless chicken just to make eating easier. I also plan to try it several other ways using different spices each time. We loved it.

This turned out very well, I will make it again. I had 6 thighs and there was still too much mayo so next time I will reduce that. I also found it rather messy to prepare . It was juicy and crunchy and also good cold the next day.

This was a good starter recipe but it definitely needed more pazazz! I used 8 thighs and still had leftover mayo. Next time I'd use 1/2 cup with some seasoned salt.
