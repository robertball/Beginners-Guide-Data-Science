So simple yet so good! I served this as an after dinner treat at a Girl's night. Everyone loved it. I only used 45 ml of Kahula though. Why didn't I think of this myself?

One of my favorite winter cocktails. For best results, make homemade cocoa and top with fresh whipped cream. Great for those late night's wrapping presents by the tree!
