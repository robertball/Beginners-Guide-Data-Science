Super delicious! The best slow cooker recipe yet. 

My modifications: 

Added 1/2 pound sliced mushrooms, dry fried at high heat just after meat was removed and just before onions were browned. 


Used same volume of potatoes but cut them in to halves and added to crock pot with browned onions, meat and carrots. 

Cooked on low for 8 hours - came out perfect, and much less hassle 

Left off puff pastry. It's delicious, but so unhealthy

This was easy to make and made the house smell delicious. Even though I used small potatoes, it took much longer than the recipe stated to cook - close to 2 hours instead of 1. My husband loved this, but my daughter said the meat was weird but the sauce was delicious. Thanks!

Made it exactly as written.  It's very easy, and the meat was tender.  The rest was a little bland.  Next time I'll tweak it with some spices.

Have made this twice following the recipe pretty closely.  My kids and husband ate it all in one cold afternoon!   Used Fosters Lager the first time since I was out of stout,  was still awesome!  Took a little more beef broth both times-a cup or so.  Second time used potato starch for flour to go gluten free...still deliscious!

This was absolutely delicious and reheated beautifully. Just be careful, this is a HUGE recipe. I had to use less of almost everything so that I could fit it in my slow cooker.

Very disappointed. Followed the recipe exactly as instructed and the vegetables were extremely hard and undercooked. Needs much more time in the crock pot.

Everyone loved this dish!  I added a little more broth and Guinness beer to the slow cooker as others suggested.  Plus quartered the potatoes instead of halved to cook faster.  Cooked on high for 5 hrs as others suggested as well.  Will make this again!  Great alternative to the traditional St. Patrick's Day meals.

I made this recipe for a company st. Pattys day potluck. I did sear the meat, I did not cut up the meat either (I don't like to do this as a personal choice). I cooked it low overnight in the crockpot. I also added a ton of spices in the a.m. After a taste test. Thyme, minced garlic, pepper, salt, minced onion, parsley. Generous amounts. I also added some cornstarch to thicken it up.

Pleased my picky brood!  I was skeptical about using the Guinness, but it came out so great I won't make a beef stew without it now.  I doubled the vegetables and broth but kept everything else the same. Even the kids were asking for second servings.  And chuck is definitely the way to go!  I've used bottom rounds for other stews, but I think the chuck is more flavorful.

This is a very good recipe. I skipped the puff pastry and used a craft brewery stout from Seattle. I cubed up an eye of chuck. It is more tender and less grainy than regular chuck.

This recipe turned out great!  I was half afraid to use the Guinness, but you couldn't even taste it in the end.  My only complaint is that it took WAY longer to cook than stated, even though I followed the ingredients/directions exactly.

I made this for dinner last night. Was easy to put together. only thing I did differently was used gluten free AP flour and used baby carrots instead of big ones. Followed everything else to a T but my carrots were not done and the meat was a little tough for me. The rest of the family still lived it and I only had 1 leftover I sent home with my son-in-law. He's my leftover eater. will make this again with a better cut of meat and cook it much longer. 6 to 8 hrs. Thanks for posting.

This was fantastic!  Substituted shallots for the onion and added 3 chopped celery stalks. Put all ingredients in the crock pot for 7 hours on low. There wasn't any left!  Great St Paddy's day meal!!

This was simple to make and very good. It may take a few attempts to refine it to your tastes, but quite good as presented. 
Personally,  I'd add more of the spices and more Guinness - couldn't really taste it in finished dish. 
I left it cook cook all day in the crock pot, everything was amazingly tender.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly except I used an Instant Pot. Used the saute function for the first half of the recipe. Then 30 min and done!

Great flavor. Meat was too soft and all the veggies melted down and nearly disappeared because I cooked it too long. Next time I'll shorten the time in the crock pot.

Very tasty, has been a hit each time I've made it.  Definitely needs more spices than recipe calls for-add extra salt, pepper, garlic, etc.  Also, carrots and potatoes take way longer than one hour to cook at the end.

I made it almost exactly like the recipe. I had to add a little more liquid because it was drying out so I ended up having to use mashed potato flakes to thicken it. I also added a little celery. I also didn't have the fresh herbs so I used dried. But everyone loved it and I will be making this again.

Eliminated the pastry puffs,but overall dish was very good.
