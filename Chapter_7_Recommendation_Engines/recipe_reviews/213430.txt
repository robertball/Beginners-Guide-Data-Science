Great recipe.  Very tasty.  I sliced my potatoes instead of mashing them.  Turned out beautifully.  I also added some shrimp and scallops too make it a bit special, but it isn't really necessary as the pie is so tasty even without the high cost additives.  Whole family loved it.

Lovely recipe. I also put in peas instead of the spinach and added in some cayenne pepper, and it turned out great.

Very good recipe,I switched up the spinach for sweet pea since my husband being English prefers it to spinach.
I have made this before without the onion and garlic this adds a nice flavour:)

I cooked haddock and salmon beforehand and cooked the pie in the oven for 30 mins. I also used spring onion as well as white onion and it tasted AMAZING! Even my fussy child ate it along with my 10 month old.

Made if for my super picky kids and they loved it! I was able to sneak in fish and spinachâ€™s and they had no idea! I also replaced the mashed potatoes with Idahoan instant potatoes so it was an even easier prep.

OK, but very bland. White fish, white sauce and mashed potato is a boring combination. I used frozen green beans and edamame (defrosted) instead of the spinach. Would have been better if had cooked onions and garlic in the butter before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I also think sliced potatoes would have been nicer - more of a scalloped potato style recipe with fish at the bottom.  Yellow American cheddar (which for once I had on hand) is useless too. Better a good import - British or New Zealand. Or another cheese.

This is very good comfort food. I did use frozen fillets and put mashed broccoli on top to cut the carbs. All those things were really wet! I will drain better next time, but the flavor was great!

I made it with peas instead of spinach. It turned out delicious! I'll definitely make this again! I also used a haberano cheese on top of the mashed potatoes instead of orange cheddar. And in addiction to baking 15 minutes with the cheese on top I also broiled it for a few minutes to get a nice golden crust. Thanks for the recipe :)

Enjoyed this fish recipe a lot!  I adapted it to non-dairy by eliminating butter and using almond milk instead of cows milk. Divided between two dishes and used spinach in one and peas in the other.  Good reception from the family, and will use soy milk next time!  thanks!!

We had just under 1.5lbs of cod and 12 oz. of fresh spinach.  Cooked the spinach in just a little of the butter until wilted and the water cooked out.  Then melted the rest of the butter and added the onion, cooking until soft.  Added the flour, then also added a crushed clove of garlic, cooking until the flour started to brown.  Needed about 2C of milk to make a nice sauce and added some thyme, parsley, black pepper and a dash of cayenne.  Used a little less cheese than was called for in sauce and topping, and had about 5C of (leftover) mashed potatos for the top.  Second helpings were in order!

We made it with the spinach as in the recipe. It was very good. I used prepared mashed potatoes from the grocery store, which made it quicker. Perhaps the potatoes were already seasoned, but I added 1 tsp of salt and overall we all agreed we'd use less salt next time. But other than that, very tasty.
