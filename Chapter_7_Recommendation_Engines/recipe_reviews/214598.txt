I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was awesome!! I followed some suggestions in other reviews by using 1 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar, 2 tsp of vanilla and used about 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I also used a good honey whole wheat bread and sprinkled the top with the pecans and some cinnamon/sugar. Served with powdered sugar on top. This will definately be made again, and again, and again!!

I knew that when I saw Cooks4forty post this recipe over on the exchange that I was not going to be able to wait until fall to try it.  I'm so glad I didn't!  This was excellent!  It's a great change from the standard breakfast casserole.  The spices were great and it wasn't overly sweet.  45 minutes was just the right time to bake it.  I can't wait to make this again and I'm sure it'll become a standard during the holidays.  Thanks!!

Ok so I hate when people grandstand and blab about how they have managed to make these recipes outstanding, but I read all the reviews and several people thought this was bland and it kinda is. But I did change the recipe and I love my new one, just switch to pumpkin pie filling, and add a cup of brown suger. Bake as directed and drizzle with maple syrup. this alteration makes a wonderful sweet variation.

Made this for Christmas morning and it was a hit.  Any pumpkin pie lover will go crazy for it.  I did use french bread which I think makes it more special.  I sprinkled the nuts over the top of the dish before baking it which toasted them nicely.  It was even better the next morning warmed up!  Some people may want to bump up the spices.

I took this to Life Group at Church, and Everyone just loved it. I used 7 eggs, 2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 cup of Brown sugar and not pecans (not a fan of them)...When it was done I topped it off with a little lite sryup drizzled over it with a lil sprinkle of powder sugar, I have to say it tasted like Pumpkin pie French Toast . Will be making this agian.....

I rated this before it was published, and copied that review!  Reviewed on Nov. 23, 2009  I used whole wheat bread, and replaced the sugar with agave syrup. It smelled and tasted so good! .

Just made this, and served it, at a fall breakfast at the beach...it was a big hit ! Used basic recipe, but doubled all spices and vanilla, changed white sugar to brown sugar, and added 3 more cubed bread slices. Thanks for the recipe, I have a feeling it will be used over and over again !

I think that I was expecting too much from this recipe.  I was not very impressed with either the taste or the consistency, and I am a HUGE pumpkin fan.

Loved it!  Doubled the vanilla and ginger and used heaping tsp. of cinnamon.  Great breakfast option if you want to just slide something in the oven and have an easy morning.  Plus you get the bonus of having a bit of orange vegetable in your first meal of the day!  I baked mine for about 55 minutes, a little longer than the recipe recommends.

Followed directions but used walnuts instead of pecans. Next time I would definitely use the pecans. It was very bland, it was much better when maple syrup was added to the top. Almost like a pumpkin flavored french toast. Not what I was expecting so I'll try something different next time.

Loved this! Made it exactly as written with the exception of using wheat bread instead of white.  It was a nice complement to the breakfast potluck we had at work...it wasn't overly sweet and has a yummy "bread pudding" consistency. Everyone raved!

My children (all five!) and I loved this. I did not have evaporated milk, but if you do a net search for a substitute, you'll find it's not a problem. Additionally, I did not make it the night before, but just assembled and baked this morning. Lastly, we did not use the optional raisins or nuts. When the casserole was fresh from the oven, I softened an 8 oz package of cream cheese and then spread the cheese on top (like icing, only no sugar) and served it warm. We liked it so much, next time I plan on doubling the recipe!

I bought some sourdough bread for dinner the other night. most of it was left the next morning and found this recipe. OMG So Yummy!I prepped it before I left for work and the kids and I ate it for dinner along with eggs, sausage and fried potatoes. I only had sliced almonds in the pantry so on the top they went with a drizzle of maple syrup. I baked it and the top was done and the knife came out clean but it was a bit doughy,, still Good but maybe I needed a tiny more oven time. IDK:) Anywho This Rocked! THANK YOU COOKS4FORTY!!

Great for early Christmas morning! Prepped it up the night before used brown sugar and doubled the vanilla per other recommends. Also only put whole pecans sprinkled on top, for one young picky eater. It was a big hit with entire family. Will become our family holiday regular breakfast *or any REALLY early morning with a crowd!

Doubled the spices (except for nutmeg), used brown sugar instead of white, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie filling and still not quite enough of a "kick" for me.  Liked it, but not loved it.

I used my weekly small group of women friends as guinea pigs with this recipe and they all RAVED about how much they liked it. So much so that they asked for it again next week! I used wheat bread and had some warm maple syrup on the side for drizzle.

I made this twice because the first time I left out the nuts.  It is a very bland cassarole.  It needs some sausage on the side to pep it up, and maybe some dried fruit mixed in with the pumpkin.  I had high hopes, but we just need more spice.

This handy little recipe helped me use up a bunch of "extras" I had and didn't want to waste.  Easy to put together and great taste!  The pecans add a nice touch.

This was DELISH with a couple tweaks:  I used pumpkin bread (Wildtree brand) instead of white or wheat.  I used HEAPING measurements of the spices.    Outside of baking the bread, the whole dish took me five minutes.  I took it to a Church function, served it with a side of Cool Whip and it was a definite FAVE!  Will serve over and over again this holiday season.  My kids (7 and 5) loved it, too!

Great Recipe for GlutenFree and DairyFree!  We have a DF GF family member so finding great recipes for the holidays that everyone will enjoy is sometimes a challenge.  I used GF bread and almond vanilla milk.  This is a real hit with the family.

Used raisin cinnamon bagels instead of bread.  Needed a lot more of the liquid ingredients.  Taste was just OK.  Not enough pumpkin flavor.  Not sure how to tweak this to make it work.

Doubled and served 15 easy, not a thing left over... soooo good. Instead of milk I used coconut cream and a hand full of toasted coconut.  Side dish was the Hot Curried Fruit  By: Maryellen Hays from this site....  EXCELLENT combo and topped off with, also from this site, Homemade Pork Sausage By: Bertha Bench.  YUMbo!

I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and sugar on the top before putting it in the fridge. It turned out wonderfully!

I loved this casserole. I made a few modifications the first time I made it and have made it the same way ever since. Instead of bread, I used 8 individually wrapped honey buns and pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices. It is fantastic!

I was not a fan of this at all... Both the taste and the texture were not what I expected. I was anticipating something sweeter and a consistency more like a bread pudding. When it came out of the oven, it was crunchy and there wasn't enough liquid to cover all the bread pieces. Hubby liked it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Loved this recipe! I followed the directions and the reviews by adding more sugar and spices. It was a hit for a holiday breakfast and one I will definitely make again!

I made this exactly according to the directions.  It was very dense and took about 20 minutes longer than directed to bake.  The pumpkin flavor was nice, but it was very plain and unsweetened.  It could use a lot more spice and sugar.  It would better be described as a pumpkin French toast casserole.  It is truly not fair to anyone to rate a recipe that you have changed so completely it does not resemble the original one.  Nearly every review I read was changed in some way, so it's hard to tell if it's a 2 star recipe or a 5 star recipe.

Easy to make and a big hit at the church brunch.  As suggested by others, substituted Brown Sugar for the white sugar.  Really nice flavor.

Really liked  that I could make this the night before and then be able to serve it when we had a large group at our house for breakfast the next morning. It was good. I wouldn't say it was fantastic, but everybody seemed to like it  and the convenience of having one main dish to just make and  pull out of the oven to serve everybody was certainly worth it to me! Also an easy heat up.  I'd make it again.

I used raisin cinnamon bread and homemade pumpkin puree. I also used a 12oz can of evaporated milk and about 1/3 cup of milk. I sprinkled some coarsly chopped pecans on top instead of mixing it in.  Delicious with some maple syrup!

I made this for two, so I halved everything except the spices, subbed brown sugar for white, and cooked in a 7x11 dish. Served with syrup, and it was very good!

I doubled the recipe and had to increase the baking time.  I also used my own homemade sourdough bread, which made it extra delicious!  I served it at a church breakfast and it was a big hit.

After reading the reviews about it being too bland, I made the following changes: 
*used pumpkin swirl bread instead of white. 
*doubled the spices and used heaping teaspoons (kept salt the same). 
*used 1cup of brown sugar instead of white
*used about 7 oz of evap milk
*baked for 55 minutes
*drizzled cream cheese icing on top (from scratch)
(the icing made it look more desirable. without it, it doesn't look very appetizing. Plus, cream cheese icing makes everything awesomesauce)

Next time, I would double the pecans and use both 1cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white. 

I made this for a work breakfast carry-in. everyone loved it!

Nice make ahead dish. Go heavy on the spices. I used cinnamon raisin bagels like someone else suggested and it was really good.
