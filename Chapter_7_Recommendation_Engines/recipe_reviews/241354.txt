honestly was a little hesitant to try this as there was no reviews or rating, but this was actually pretty good. i was sort of unsure at how big or small to cut the potatoes and veggies though, but i cut them into about the size of a dime and served it over rice and it worked out pretty well. i didn't use a whole onion, just used it to my liking and only used one clove of garlic instead aswell. i also added 2tble spoon of butter and stirred in 1/3 of a cup of all purpose flour in about 5min before it was finished cooking so it had a thicker consistency to pour on the rice. definitely a recipe to save though, so thanks :)

Perfect served over rice. I followed the recipe with the exception of making only 4 chicken legs since there are only 2 of us. I also did not have bell peppers so I substituted celery. The bake time is way off, I baked it for 1 hour 45 minutes.  We enjoyed it and will make it again.

Followed this recipe almost completely, with two exceptions: didn't have enough green pepper so added 2 chopped large stalks of celery; reduced salt to one teaspoon and added a teaspoon of garlic pepper seasoning. Quick, easy, tasty, savoury dish. Love how well the  Clamato juice marries with the warm, smokey flavour of the cumin-dry herb blend to make this dish taste as good as  grandma would make; if she'd spent all day making it. Yummy!

Did as told. Was good but missing something.
Then had to add 
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
I can diced tomatoes
Then I was satisfied with profile. (Our family likes this formula)
Thank you Sponsor for the recipe.

Meh.  The sauce is a bit bland.   It does take a lot longer to cook.   I uncovered and turned up oven to 475 at the end to get chicken brown.  Veggies don't cook very well.   Skip.

Very easy to make, need to cut vegetables up kind of small and put in a big pot, I used my turkey pan, and it takes way longer than it says, I actually cooked it for 2.5 hours and the meat falls off the bones and the flavor is perfect.

I dont even like clamato but this was so tasty! it packed so much flavor, I served it with quinoa. 
I only added 2 ingredients, 2 tsp of knorr chicken seasoning, and 2 tsp of onion powder. 
it was so easy to prepare and I followed the baking instructions exactly. 
I will definitely be making this again, thanks for the recipe its DELICIOUS!

I saw this and it did interest me so I gave it a try. I only had chicken breast to use.  And my husband wanted a dinner made in the cast iron pot outside like when we camp.  So I did use 4 small potatoes and I sliced baby carrots in long length.  Only used one green pepper and half of the purple onion.  I simmered the veggies with the chicken on top for 1/2 an hour.  Then added the Clamato juice and cooked for another 45 minutes.  I add some cornstarch water to make the juice thicker.  Cooked for another 5 minutes.  I did serve over rice.  This might be a dinner to use when camping. Thanks for the recipe.

Could not find myself to add the cumin but subbed it out for a little thyme. Also went a little heavier on the pepper, personal preference. A one pot dish, quick in a pinch, and tasty enough to make it again. I kept the foil on the whole time and if you cut the veggies small enough I found it is enough cooking time contrary to other reviews. I left the peppers in larger chunks as they cook quicker than the root veg. Chicken was moist and flavourful. Thanks for sharing!

Only used the seasoning, though only half the salt. Fried everything, didn't put any seasoning in the vegetable, and put it in the soup with a bay leaves and a hint of rosemary and parsley.

This was good, but didn't feel that the Clamato added much flavor.   Most of the flavor came from the seasonings.  Took longer than 40 minutes to get the vegetables done.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it exactly as written, and the spice choices seem to clash with each other. The potatoes did seem to mitigate the odd flavors.

Followed the recipe almost exactly. The exceptions were instead of using red onion, I chose to use yellow. I also didn't have any garlic cloves, is I used 1 tsp of minced garlic from a jar which is equivalent to 2 cloves. And finally, I cooked the chicken and veggies for 30 mins before and after adding the Clamato. The wife and I loved how it turned out and the chicken was very tender!

Left the skins on the potatoes. Excellent flavors. Not sure why you would want to pair it with rice. Definitely will have this dish again!

Full family of legs. I doubled seasoning and used fresh basil. Chopped everything bite sized. Boiled the potatoes  first while I chopped everything else. 90min was enough time

Very tasty! I substituted cilantro for basil because I didn't have any , and I made my own clamato juice with chicken broth for clam juice. Again, very tasty. My family, males, really liked it a lot. I will make it again.

My family and I loved this dish.  My 7 year old son, who never eats any vegetables, loved the carrots and potatoes. I would suggest cooking the carrots, potatoes and chicken for 30 minutes and then adding the onion, bell pepper and clamato juice for the remaining 30 minutes so the peppers and onions do not get so soggy.

I used a picnic pack of meat so I 1.5x the seasoning and added the veggies to my liking. So a ton of carrots, a huge red bell pepper, an onion, and two potatoes.  The garlic I used a large tbsp of minced and mixed it with the seasoning mix. The flavor is great. It took me a hour and forty-five minutes to finish, but I cut my carrots kinda big and part of my chicken wasn't all the way defrosted.

Really like this recipe!  Used yellow sweet pepper instead of green.   Baked longer than recommended.   Otherwise used as directed....really good!  I used V8 juice instead of Clamato.

I was not sure about making this but I am really glad I did. It is different to what you'd expect with this type of chicken but it works. The sauce is absolutely delicious(I did add a little extra sugar and worster sauce). Totally worth the effort.

I prepared this generally as directed, only adding some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit and a bit more cooking time based on other reviews. I enjoyed the flavor a lot. Quite delicious and different. Chicken legs were on sale at my local grocer, so only cost about $8.00 for a meal for a family of four! Great!
