I only made one change--I used vegetable oil instead of butter. I chose to bake this in the oven instead of use my crockpot. Baked at 250*, I let this bake for an hour, stirring every fifteen minutes. I did not try this myself but the kids RAVED about it. They ate half a batch in one sitting!

I added bacon and twice the seasoning. Still not very flavorful. I’ll still to my Mom’s traditional Trash recipe.

So addicting!! I made it in the oven, baked at 350 for 1 hour stirring every 15 minutes. Also I added a handful of almonds. One of the best chex mix recipes I've found!

I thought this was wonderfully favorable and the bacon salt was a great addition. I started with a bag of plain Chex Mix and ended with a hot, delicious snack to serve at a party. I admit I baked it for an hour at 250 instead of using the slow cooker, but I plan to try the slow cooker method next time! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I wanted to love this recipe.  However, I found that the cereal just wasn't as crispy as it is when baked in the oven, rather some of it was a little chewy.  The barbecue flavor was good, but pretty light.  I might try it again, but if I do I will bake it in the oven rather than using the slow cooker.
