This is awesome, simple and easy to make a little more healthy.  I didn't tweek it much.  Just added 2 cloves garlic, low sodium/fat soups, no salt cracker, cut the butter down to 1/4 cup. I also increased the rice to 1 cup and mixed the soups with the milk before I poured over the ingredients.  This fits perfectly in the rectangle pampered chef stone.  Someone mentioned that they wouldn't add the crackers next time because the next day they were soggy; however, my family liked the flavour of the cracker in the leftovers - tasted like a buttery stuffing.  I also have a kitchen scale so i converted to help you out (cause I didnt know how much was 10 oz of broccoli or cauliflower)  10 oz broccloli florets is about 4cups, 10 oz. cauliflower florets is about 3 cups.  This of course depends on how you chop, but at least it can give you an idea.

Good, but had to modify.  Thought butter amount was ridiculous so used no more than 1 Tbsp. to saute onion (also added 2 cloves of minced garlic).  Changed order of recipe by then adding milk, soup, and about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar (not  a pound of Velveeta!) to make a sauce THEN stirred in the broccoli, cauliflower, and rice. All fit into  an 8x8 glass dish.  Sprinkled top with  freshly ground pepper, Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, and a little more cheddar.  Would be good with ham on side or even in the casserole.

Used about half the processed cheese and half the butter than called for and used 1 cup of rice.  Teriffic! Creamy, cheesy and oh so very good! I too might add some minced garlic in the onion saute next time I make this...cause I will be making it often!

The first time I made this, I used frozen broc and cauli. The cauli was fine but the broc was nothing but stalks, and some were really tough and woody. Now I make it with fresh veggies, and it is absolutely FANTASTIC! I use extra-sharp Cheddar, cream of mushroom soup, as I always have it on hand, plus I follow others' advice and use 1 cup of rice. Thanks for posting, Bridget!

I brought this to a Thanksgiving luncheon and thought that it turned out really well. I gave this recipe 5 stars though I did change the original recipe based on reviews. These are the changes I made: I doubled the amt of rice, broccoli and cauliflower. I left out the onions and celery (my preference), and I used block cheddar cheese chopped up. I added garlic to the butter when I sauteed the broccoli and cauliflower. Well, it looks like I changed the recipe completely - however I give it 5 stars because the base recipe was strong enough to with stand my changes and still be great! Thank you for a yummy recipe - I'll be serving for many holidays to come!

This recipe was wonderful! It was great the first night, and for left-overs. I made a few changes, though. I used brown rice. I steamed the broccoli and cauliflower. As per previous reviews of runny sauce, I used only 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 pound processed cheese food, and 1/2 cup (4 oz.) milk. I only had cream of chicken soup with herbs. I didn't have crackers, but figured they'd be soggy for left-overs anyway. Again, this recipe is a keeper!!!

Great Recipe! I just gave it a few of my own alterations...I used about a tablespoon of butter and a mere sprinkling of shredded cheddar/monteray jack cheese, to cut down on fat. Also, I used cream of mushroom soup and added some frozen peas. Wonderful! Thanks Bridget

Came out way too soupy! Next time will increase rice amount next time and decrease milk amount. Used Cream of Chicken Soup with Herbs. otherwise it was tasty and fairly easy to put together, especially if you have leftover rice and don't have to cook that first.

DE-licious!  Following previous reviews, I did make some changes.  Used 1 cup of Brown Minute Rice.  Steamed the broccoli and cauliflower.  Used only 2 Tbsp of butter.  Added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion.  Used approx. 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese vs processed cheese food.  And changed the order--mixed soup, milk, and cheese into onions and garlic, then added rice and veggies after the cheese had started to melt.  YUMMY!!!  (Only 7 Weight Watcher Points Plus for 1/6 of the batch).

My husband made this for Christmas day at our daughter's. It is amaZing, he tweaked it a bit. Did not put rice in the dish, added a variety of spices and durkee's, which originally he makes broccoli with durkee's, it is his mother's recipe. He also used red peppers flakes. It was delicious. Will surely make this again and again.

I came across this while looking for a recipe to replicate these delicious Vegetable Medallions they sell at the Ikea Cafeteria.  They are made with hash brown potatoes, broccolli and caulifower.  I used this recipe as a base, however I used OreIda Hash Brown potatoes instead of rice.  I reduced the amount of Velveeta like others suggested.  I am rating this 5 stars, even though my end result was very different than this recipe, however, what I came up with was delicious.  I will reduce the cheese a little more next time and leave out the soup.  Oh, I also chopped the veggies and potatoes into small pieces before I mixed it all up.

This time of year all the produce looks wonderful. It's at its peak and often at a great low price. Broccoli I eat all year, its cost is not ever too bad. Not so with cauliflower. Its price soars to where I cannot justify buying it. I have tried quite a few similar casseroles like this one and have found I like this the best. I did up the rice amount to about 3/4+ C. which solved some overly liquid concerns. Other than for grilled cheese sandwiches I don't stock processed cheese. A note to others: Shredded cheddar cheese in the same amount called for works well. I chose old cheddar as I like the stronger flavour. The cracker (Ritz) topping is a nice touch. I don't usually like this added textured layer but it's really good here. I dotted the top with small pieces of butter to finish. This makes a good sized amount. Perfect if it's destined for a social function like a pot luck. This makes a good amount so I will freeze my leftovers for another dinner. Thanks- This is a nice one.

I make mine with cream of mushroom soup, a sprinkle of garlic powder, and 2 pieces of crumbled bacon. Also, you can cut down on the butter to a couple tablespoons. YUM!

This was very good! To make it more healthy, I cut back on the butter just a bit, I used brown rice, cheddar cheese, and sprinkled with wheat germ instead of crackers. I also added some chicken to make it a meal, and the whole family loved it!

This was a little time consuming using fresh vegetables, but the end result was FABULOUS!  I was informed that it is a keeper for holidays.  I doubled the recipe because we weren't sure how many guest we'd end up having.  I ended up with way too much so I packed supper-sized servings in Seal-A-Meal bags and it froze beautifully.  Tasted fresh made when reheated!

I am a butter lover so I ignored previous comments, but I am telling you that 1/2 cup of butter is to much! I would use only 1/4 cup. Other than that it was a good recipe. I used a can of cheddar cheese Campbells soup instead of the processed cheese and just used bread crumbs sprinkled on top intead of butter crackers and it still turned out wonderful. Just back off on the butter!

I thought the dish was very good, but I had to alter it a bit. I added 1 full cup of rice as others did, 1 pound of cooked, cut up chicken, one full head of broccoli and 1 full head of cauliflower.  If I didn't add the extra rice and chicken this would have been very saucy.  I prefer more filling and less sauce in my casseroles.

Thankyou Bridget!!!!!!!!!!This is a fantastic recipe. We all know how hard it is to get kids to eat veggies, especially green ones. This recipe solved the problem. It is wonderful. The whole family loves it. I followed the others advice and used a little less butter and cheese. I grated cheddar cheese instead of cubing it. I cant say enough about this recipe. Thanks again.

I did modify this one quite a bit, but it's a 5 star recipe anyhow. I ran the frozen vegetables under cold water to break up the big chunks. I melted 1/4 cup of butter, grated 1/2 of a large stick of Cracker Barrel sharp cheddar and used 1 cup of minute rice. I mixed all ingredients in a large bowl, dumped it all in a baking dish and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes, and forgot the crackers, haha, but it was wonderful. I was in a hurry. This was so good, even without the crumb topping and so easy to put together with my modifications. Thanks BRIDG

I read all the reviews before making this recipe taking into consideration the "too soupy" and "too cheesy" reviews.  I substituted a combination of swiss, cheddar, and processed cheese in a jar for the cubed processed cheese food.  I probably used only approx 10 oz rather a whole pound of cheese.  I actually added more milk than called for (approx 8 oz)as it was too thick with only 5 oz of milk.  You may get the "soupiness" mentioned in the other reviews from the processed cheese food - ?? not sure as mine was not soupy whatsoever.  Added 2 cloves of garlic.  Used an 18 oz bag of broccoli & cauliflower florettes with carrot slices.  Also added some leftover turkey & topped with Durkee Fried Onions. The soup, butter, onions & rice was used as indicated in the recipe. Very tasty one dish meal.  Can't give it a 5-star due to all the modifications, but will make again.

This was Very Yummy, the only reason I am rating this a 4 rather than a 5 is that it isn't the most healthy dish.
HOWEVER, if you have kids (or man-kids) who you can't get to eat their veggies, this recipe should DEFINITELY do the trick.
I will TOTALLY be making this again.
This is easy to make, however if you are a general foul-up in the kitchen (as am I), I got a little overwhelmed in the midst of making it - just take a deep breath and keep plugging along and follow the directions, it'll look like a hot liquid mess but it firms up a bit at the end and the end product will taste delicious.
Kitchen-clueless people: prepare the ingredients ahead of time, as in cutting up the veggies, cooking the rice, measuring the milk out, opening up the can of soup - and do yourself a favor and look at all the ingredients being mixed together to make sure your skillet and casserole dish is big enough, and DEEP enough.

I made this using 1 cup brown rice, 28 oz frozen broccoli & cauliflower, 1/2 lb processed cheese & about 1 T minced garlic. I melted 1/2 stick butter and stirred in the crackers and topped with that. I can't imagine using a whole pound of cheese! We love cheesy and we thought the 1/2 lb was almost too much. I will definitely make again the same way I did this time. Very good dish!

Would have been a perfect score if i didn't have to tweak so many things. Don't get me wrong, this was DELICIOUS and it is a very versatile recipe! Here's what I changed:


-Increased the rice to 1 cup (could even have gone higher)
-Cut the butter down to 1/4 cup
-Used only half of an onion
-Added a couple cloves of garlic while sauteing the onions
-Used only 1/2 lb of the velveeta (processed cheese)
-Instead of crackers... try croutons!! I used garlic and butter croutons and they were awesome! Yes, they will get a bit soggy after a while, if that's not your thing, simply omit them, this will still taste great without them!

Lot of changes, but a VERY good meal. :)

This is one of those recipes that will be a hit for any type of gathering you need to bring a dish.  Very yummy!  The only change I made was that I used 1/2 velveta cheese & 1/2 white sharp cheddar.  My kids loved it.

We had leftover blanched broc and cauliflower from NYE...used only 1/4 margarine and subbed cream of celery for the cream of chicken. Used 1 cup of parboiled rice so the rice didn't get mushy. Used half Velveeta and half shredded cheddar blend (3 oz each) for cheese.  My family went nuts!!!  Served it with salmon patties and glazed carrots.  Will def make again ---cant wait for tomorrow for leftovers :)

This is a delicious recipe.  I suggest using less cheese (and I love cheese), make small cubes so cheese melts better. I used it for Thanksgiving and there was no leftovers although I doubled the recipe.  Everyone enjoyed it...thanks.

As written, this casserole definitely lacks flavor so I use salt, black pepper, cayenne, parsely and Old Bay. I put Old Bay on almost anything! I make a variation of this recipe almost every week. I include diced chicken breast, sauteed in onions and garlic, and omit the rice. Instead of cream of chicken, I use cream of mushroom soup with a couple tablespoons of milk added and some fresh mushrooms. Also, I experiment with different shredded cheeses each time. I love sharp cheddar, while processed cheese (to me) is an abomination... The cauliflower needs to cook longer than the broccoli, so I'd recommend blanching the cauliflower first and leaving the broccoli raw. Lastly, I use a mixture of regular Panko breading and chipotle Panko. I sautee in a bit of butter and spread a ridiculous amount on top. Throw it in the oven until cheese is melty, breadcrumbs are browned, the veggies are tender and it is heated through (around 20 minutes at 350 degrees). Perfection! Sometimes I serve on top of rice if it's a comfort food type of day/week/month. Otherwise, I eat it alone as a main dish and don't feel as guilty. This is a good starter recipe that you can tweak and make your own.

This was very tasty.  I also added chicken to this recipe to make a hearty casserole to serve as a main course and topped with Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.  My 6 year old daughter loved it.

Delicious! To make it a little lower in fat, we used 94% fat free cream of chicken soup, 1/2 pound 2% milk velveeta, and 1/2 pound low fat cheddar. It came out awesome, will make again!

This was delicious, I will definitely make again!  I think I may make a little "healthier" next time by cutting butter in half (I dont think it would be missed), and using brown rice instead of white.  (I love rice, so I doubled the rice quantity)  Also, I think Velveeta has a new 2%, I may try instead of the regular.  And, I used bags of frozen veggies...I think they were 14 or 16oz bags...but the increased quantity was fine.

This was very cheesy and very rich. I could have left out half the butter and about 2 oz. of cheese and it still would have been good. I loved the crunch from the topping. I used dried minced onion and didn't saute it. My family liked this so it's a winner in my book. Thanks!

What a nice recipe. I followed it exactly except I used 1/4 cup butter to saute the onions. Next time I make it, which I definitely will, I will only use half the amount of cheese. I was originally going to cut the amount of cheese, but I wanted to be able to rate this recipe fairly. I can honestly say that 1lb of cheese is WAY TOO much. It is hard to enjoy the other ingredients if each spoonful is large amounts of melted cheese.

This is great comfort food!  Made this exactly how the recipe reads.  5 and 3/8 fluid ounces of milk is 2/3 cup.  Regular Velveeta for the cheese and Town House crackers for the top.  If you need something for a covered dish event, this is ideal.  I served this with the fabulously easy and delicious Chutney Chicken recipe from this site.

I have already made this at least 6 times! I have started adding chicken pieces to it and making it the main course, instead of a side dish.  I do not add the crackers because they get too soggy, especially the next day.  Also, this recipe freezes really well!  Thanks!

I am eating a bowl of this as I write, and it is AWESOME!  I have been looking for something interesting to do with leftover steamed veggies, and this works beautifully.  I threw in cauliflower, broccoli, green beans, and even a few spears of asparagus.  I reduced the fat by using only a tbsp of butter, 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, and fat free milk.  I used about 1 1/2 loose cups of grated sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, and whole wheat bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also used 50% more rice.  Next time, I think I'll try it with brown rice, for some added nutrition.  Excuse me while I go and get another bowl.....  :)

I took the advice of others and increased the rice to 1 cup, added more veggies (14oz. instead of 10oz.) and cut back a little on the cheese and my only suggestion is... don't cut back on the cheese.  Mine was not soupy at all, if anything it was a little on the dry side.  If you increase the rice and veggies, don't decrease the milk or cheese, it will need it.  Otherwise it was good.  Enjoy

I added boiled chicken, and carrots but forgot to add the milk. Also used breadcrumbs instead of crackers. It turned out so YUMMY. I call it my spring time casserole.

I changed it - instead of cauliflower, I sauteed onions and chopped zucchini in olive oil and a splash of garlic powder.  I cooked brown rice in chicken broth, steamed the broccoli and mixed everything together. I mixed a can of broccoli and cheese soup and a can of cheddar cheese soup and 5 ounces of milk with other mixture, poured into an oval dish.  I tore up 2 slices of cheese into strips and placed on top of mixture, crushed ritz crackers on top of cheese and baked.  YUM!

The only change I made was to sub shredded cheddar for processed cheese and slightly decreasing the butter.  Well my three duaghters and I liked it but my two boys did not. I added about a tsp of salt and pepper but still came out slightly bland.

This recipe turned out great. I used fresh vegetables and cream of celery soup. Definitely a holiday side dish. It made a lot for us, so tonight I put the leftovers in a pot, added chicken broth and milk and had a nummy creamy soup. Thanks for a great dual purpose recipe.

My daugther hates vegetables but she loves this dish.  I made my own sauce because I don't like the cream of mushroom/cream of chicken taste.  This is how my sauce was made:  Take 1 tablespoon of oil, add some flour and whisk it until lightly golden.  Then whish in some milk until sauce thicken.  Add real cheddar cheese until melted.  Then I pour it to the vegetables and proceed recipe like normal.  Fantastic dish.

I have been making this for years but with a slight variation on the ingredients and the cooking directions. I use 1 cup of Minute Rice, a large can of evaporated milk, 1/2 cup of chopped onion and 1/2 of a small stick of Cracker Barrel Sharp Cheese. The rest of the ingredients are the same. Although I prefer cooking fresh vegetables, frozen here works very well and is much faster. I simply grate the cheese, mix the frozen vegetables and the uncooked rice together, setting aside. I melt the margarine or butter, then mix with the soup and the evaporated milk. After mixing all together I bake for 45 min to an hour at 350 I try not to over bake it and get it too dried out. This is one the recipes my family always wants at family gatherings, etc. So easy this way and everyone loves it. Also, I don't bother with crackers because it is excellent the way it is, even rewarmed. And I don't want soggy crackers on my left overovers.

Good base recipe.  I'm no cook but I tried this and made a few changes.  I didn't measure anything.  I used quinoa instead of rice, fresh veggies, about 1 heaping tbs butter, fz onions, shredded cheddar cheese, cream of mushroom and almond milk.  Turned out very tasty and was all ate up!

Yum!  I made some changes as advised by others.  I sauteed 2 chicken breasts in a bit of olive oil and then cooked them completely in 1 cup chicken broth.  Cut into bite sized pieces to add.  I then used the remaning broth along with about a tbsp of butter to sautee the onion and 2 minced garlic cloves.  I also used 1 cup of rice and 4 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I topped with cracker crumbs and garlic and cheddar croutons but preferred the cracker crumbs although my kids preferred the croutons. Great recipe!  Thanks so much for posting!

I brought this to a family party and it went over well.  I did make a couple of changes, but nothing major - I used just a tablespoon of butter, substituted onion powder for onion, and used low fat crackers.  Next time, if I can find it in the 1 pound size, I will use the 2% milk cheese to lower the fat more.

It says to cook the rice in water-how much water? And then to drain it? The recipe also says to simmer the veggies for 10 min until crunchy.  Mine were close to mushy by then.   I wasn't sure how much milk was 5 3/5 oz so I just added 1/2 cup.  I had all kinds of problems with this recipes.  The end result was pretty bad.

Loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing and for all of your reader suggestions as well.   I used 1 cup of wild multi-grain rice, two heaping tablespoons of minced garlic, and about 1 cup of finely shredded carrots, plus one cup of shredded and chopped purple cabbage.  Additionally, I used 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese instead of velveeta, plus about 8 string cheese sticks that needed to be used before they expired.  Since I didn't have round buttery crackers I used saltines.  

The wild rice gave it a nuttiness and the cabbage gave it a nice crunch.  It truly hit the spot!

My meat eater husband LOVED this dish!  I took others advice and used 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 lb Velveeta, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 cup uncooked instant rice (2 servings of rice).  The garlic REALLY added amazing flavor and it was not runny or too cheesy at all.  I will definitely make this healthier version next time.  Can be served all by itself.

This was fantastic!  I made this as a side for Christmas dinner, and the whole family couldn't get enough!  I kept to the recipe for the most part, just went with previous suggestions to use 1 cup of rice and add minced garlic to the onion.  You know something is a hit when you are asked for the recipe!

This is a perfect comfort food recipe, and works great as both a main dish and a side dish. It works as a great vegetarian dish too, if you replace the cream of chicken soup with cream of broccoli! I highly recommend this dish to anyone who loves hearty stick-to-your-insides meals.

This is a great recipe.  I even added a little celery, onion and green peppers and it was a hit.  I will use this again.

This was pretty good!  To make it a little healthier I cut back on cheese (1/2 pound), used 1-2 Tbs canola oil instead of butter and used a "healthy request" cream of chicken soup.  Even with these changes, I was really happy with how it came out, and it made great leftovers to bring to work for lunch!

Thank you, Bridg!  This was wonderful!  I used Gluten-free bread crumbs (because of medical condition) instead of the crackers, Almond milk instead of regular milk, and almost 1/2 cup cottage cheese (because I didn't have processed cheese on hand).  I steamed the broccoli and cauliflower, and this was amazing!  Thank you!

I needed to use up a head of broccoli and a head of cauliflower, so I choose this recipe. I don't keep velveeta on hand, so I just used shredded cheddar cheese. I used a whole cup of instant rice and a can of cream of mushroom soup. This is kind of bland, I added some minced garlic with the onion and some salt and pepper, but I think it needed more seasonings. This was a nice light dinner!( Not bad as leftovers, I am eating it for lunch right now!!)

This is excellent. I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. I did use fresh broccoli and cauliflower, and put those in after all the other ingredients were mixed together. Thanks so much for a huge winner among family!

This is a very tasty recipe. I did find that I used a lot of pots and pans for preparation though. On the advice of others I made the following changes: added cooked chicken breast to make it a meal, decreased the butter (just enough to saute the onions) and increased the rice to 1 cup. I found that to be too much rice for the amount of sauce and next time I would do 3/4 cup of rice. I think next time I will make it with half processed (Velveeta) and half grated cheddar cheese. I always tweak recipes after making them the first time but this ones is a great recipe and needs only minor changes to suit your personal taste!

First of all, this is a wonderful recipe. Thank you BRIDG!  I made a few changes that I thought others might find helpful. Because we like our veggies crisp, I skipped the part about simmering the florets for 10 minutes and simply added raw broccoli and cauliflower florets. I added one clove of minced garlic to the onions, ½ tsp of salt, ¼ tsp of pepper and ¼ tsp of hot sauce. I also increased the milk to 10.75 ounces (a soup can) and reduced the cheese down to about ¼ - ½ pound. Watch out…this is a yummy dish.  You’ll keep going back for more :)

I made this the first time two days ago.  My guest, a grown woman, licked her plate clean! The only problem was that I found too much liquid at the bottom of the dish. I made it again tonight and used half the butter and twice the rice.   It held together much better.  I used Ritz crackers for the topping.
Very difficult to stop eating. I kept  straightening out the row with my spoon a little more and then a little more and then.....yum! Real comfort food!

My 6- and 8-yr olds loved this. I made a couple of changes: I didn't add the rice, I used about 1/4 of the cheese, and I sprinkled the top with Italian seasoned bread crumbs in addition to the crushed buttery crackers. I also put a little garlic salt over the top to add more flavor. Next time, I'll add the garlic salt before it bakes. Thanks for the recipe!

This stuff is the bomb!!  I used 3 cups cooked white rice (instant rice), 12 oz ea. of  broccoli and cauliflower (we love veggies), some sharp cheddar cheese (grated) in the mix and on top (under the cracker topping), and then everything else to the T.  To die for!  This is one of the BEST casseroles!  My family loves it and I even look forward to making this one!! Thanks for sharing!

I really think it should be a 4, because I had to modify the recipe a lot. But it was sooo good. I used a cup of rice, 1/4 cup of milk, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 2 cloves of garlic, and sprinkled (much less than 1 pound, maybe an eighth of a pound) cheddar cheese on top before the cracker crumbs. I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen, and left the onion as it was. 

It was an instant hit. Even though it was just my dad and I, we ate it all.

As for the few reviews saying it tastes horrible and all, I have no idea why... I think it tastes perfectly delicious, and I am so picky. Yum. :)

Definatly a keeper!  I will be making this again for sure.  Kids ate it and I *loved* it.  Only hitch, at least when I made it, I had to double the rice because 1/2c uncooked rice doesn't make that much and the whole thing is quite soupy without the extra bulk. Once I added more cooked rice, it was super.  I did not use processed cheese (EW! fake cheese!) and I used brown rice.  I used all real cheese and the dish was soooooooooo good.

We just loved this dish!  I though there was too much sauce for the quantity of vegetables, though.  I will probably increase the amount of vegetables and rice a little next time.  We polished off every single bite of the leftovers!

I just served this for tonight's dinner and there is not a speck of it left. My five childen loved it without exception. Now that's what I call a successful recipe! The one change I made was, I omitted the rice. I used American cheese and the casserole was scrumptious. I found the flavor I wanted without using a whole onion.Thank you, Bridget for a terrific dish. My daughter, Brigid, said "put this in the active file"  I sure will. Thanks for sharing, allrecipe.com rules!!

This recipe is wonderful!  I brought it for Thanksgiving dinner, and my family told me that I was forever obligated to bring it to every family function.  My two-year-old baby brother can't get enough of it.  He makes my mother dip all of his other foods into it.  My mother is constantly asking me to bring some more over, and when I make them enough to feed forteen people, it's gone in three days!  The recipe's only downfall is how long it takes to make it.

I added a little cheddar cheese along with the processed food cheese for a little more flavor.  A big hit.  The kids loved it and it makes a good pot luck dish.

I used more cauliflower than broccoli because it was what I had on hand. Then I took a lot of the suggestions to create this: Used 1 Tbsp. butter to sauté onion, then added milk, soup, and about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar to make a sauce THEN stirred in the broccoli, cauliflower, and rice. All fit into my 9x13 glass dish. Sprinkled top with freshly ground pepper, crackers, and a little more cheddar.

Even my picky eater ate all that was on his plate!!

It was really really good ;). I just added some chicken to add some more protein to our diet. Just as a side note  I didn't drain vegetables as well so I ended up adding one minute oats to thicken up casserole. I'll prolly continue doing this so help reduce cholesterol  !!

Way too many crackers on top.  Would be better with a little bread crumbs.  Too much cheese.

Yes, we made this as a side to Christmas dinner we really enjoyed it!  I made quite a few changes but they all worked well.  I used 2 cups fresh brocc & 2c fresh cauliflour and par boiled both for 10 mins..I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 2 cups mild cheddar...1/2 cup white rice and 1/2 cup long brown rice...1/2 cup finely chopped raw celery..only used 1/2 cube of butter thought a whole cube would be too much...it fit perfectly in a square 8 x 8 baking pan and we stuck little pieces of raw broccoli and cauliflour down into the casserole to give it a crunch..this came out great...will def make it again!  Nice because you can modify it so much!  Oh also we put those French's french fried onions on the top instead of crackers..worked good!  We cooked it for about 45 mins on 350 until just brown.  Thanks for this nice recipe!

Since I was taking this to my neighbor's for Thanksgiving, I read through all reviews and implemented 'common' changes. I measured meticulously. I sauteed 1/2 onion and 1 clove garlic in 2T butter, steamed the broccoli and cauliflower, heated equal parts of processed and cheddar cheeses in 1 can cream of chicken soup and the milk. I used 3/4 cup white rice and 1/4 cup wild rice, which I cooked in my rice cooker and used chicken stock instead of water. I used lightly buttered Ritz cracker crumbs on the top. I did not care for this recipe at all and neither did anyone else. I brought 3/4 of it home. I re-heated and tried it the day after Thanksgiving and ended up throwing it out. IF I made it again, and I don't plan to, I would use cream of mushroom soup and omit the onion and garlic. I would probably use stove top stuffing croutons with flavor packet and a little melted butter on the top. I don't believe the flavor of the cream of chicken soup, cheese, onion and garlic were a good combination.

This is GREAT! Not a fan of cream of chicken soup so I used cream of onion soup and omitted the chopped onion. My family loves this! Thanks for a great recipe.

Super yummy... even for this cook who doesn't really like broccoli and cauliflower!  Next time I'm going to put chicken chunks in it and make it a whole meal!

This was THE BOMB!! I used one head of cauliflower (all I had), and melted about 2.5 TBS butter, then sauteed 1 tsp each onion and garlic powder (no fresh onion on hand either.) Then I coated the simmered cauliflower/cooked rice with the butter and spices and set aside, THEN heated the milk and soup (cream of mushroom, not chicken, once again what I had) and melted about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of shredded sharp Irish cheese in the milk/soup mix. I added the cauliflower/rice to milk mix, then put it all in a 9 in. (?) round pan, topped with crushed crackers. Baked for 35 minutes and it was sooo good. My boyfriend could have eaten the entire pan himself! Thanks for the great recipe :)

So good! I used a little cubed processed cheese food, and a little cream cheese (because that's what I had.) Next time I won't cook the rice before baking, but thumbs up!

I tried this for Thanksgiving and it was everyones favorite side dish! I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and cut the butter to 1 stick and cut the amount of cheese in half. It was so good!! I made this a day in advance and topped with crackers just before baking. So easy and delish!!

This recipe essentially inspired me to create my own twist/version, as it seems most reviewers do.  To make a healthier version, I used the following substitutions:
1) 1/2 cup Japonica rice & 1/2 cup brown rice (cooking times vary...I cooked 30 min stovetop)
2) 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup olive oil
3) 4 oz. cheese food & 1/4 cup shredded cheddar
4) 10 oz. vegetable stock (vs. condensed soup)
5) 5 oz. rice milk
6) 1 cup crushed wheat crackers

While this version will produce a somewhat different flavor (less sodium & fat), it is very similar, and was still a "hit" by those who like broccoli casserole.  Makes good leftovers.

The secret to this recipe is to not over cook the vegtables.  I took this recipe to a friends house and because of circumstances with the oven, the vegtables got over cooked.  It was declicious, but would have been much better with crunchy vegtables.  I did add the garlic which was a great idea.  I will try this again in my own home.

I enjoyed this, my BF thought it was really good. I added 1/2 glove of garlic. Added Cheddar and Swiss to the processed cheese also. Topped it off with crispy bacon bits with shredded cheese on top. It was good with the fresh chicken we had.

Wow this was so good! I did make a few changes to it, mostly to make it more vegetarian-friendly (not much, trust me!). Ended up making a huge amount and the four of us ate up almost all of it. I'll definitely be making this one again.

Delicious!  I cut the butter in half and used minced onions (husband doesn't love onions like I do).  Also, I only used half the Velveeta, but next time I'll use the full pound.  This was so good, even my 1st grader gobbled it up!

Made with with brown rice, real shredded cheese, and french fried onions.  A great change of pace.  Thought it needed just a smidge of salt, though.  Yummy on a brisk fall day!

I loved the idea of serving these two vegetables in a different way.  At first my family raised an eyebrow at the recipe but quickly changed their mind. My daughter whose favorite food has always been spaghetti now has a new favorite food.  She said it was the best thing ever.  I agree!  Even tastier the next day. 2 things I did differently was to use brown rice and I also added grated parmesan cheese to the crushed crackers.

I saw that others thought this was labor intensive, so I made a few changes for simplicity.  I cooked the rice and broccoli and mixed them together, then stirred in some French Fried onions and some salt and pepper and spread in the casserole dish.  In the same pan, I mixed the soup and milk and poured over the top.  Then I just sprinkled some cheddar cheese and baked until bubbly and added more FF onions.  (I didn't have crackers on hand.)  We all loved it!

Followed the recipe exactly. Boyfriend didn't care for all the cheese, i loved it. Didn't cook the rice long enough so it was chewy. Also added mushrooms and cajun seasoning. The only reason this versatile recipe received 4 stars is because I don't think it had enough flavor. Will probably add rosemary to my next batch! All in all, a wonderful and easy recipe.

I did a cup of rice and eye balled everything else.  I did not use the full amount of butter either.  I did add two small chicken breasts, cubed to make it more of a complete meal.  I added a few more seasonings.  Tasted great and had some to freeze.  Thanks!

Very very good!  It is a very warm and comforting dish.  I used 1 cup of rice and only 3 tbs of butter and it was great.  I will definetly make this dish again.  Maybe instead of the crackers I will use french onion rings for more flavor.

Outstanding - best broccoli rice casserole ever.  A lot of work, but worth it for parties. Made the night before, and it turned out great.  I made 1/2 topped 1/2 not, which was a hit because not everyone likes topping

I made changes to this recipe and everyone loved it at Thanksgiving. I used an 18oz can of Campbells Creamy Chicken and Dumpling Soup instead of the can of condensed cream of chicken soup. I used about 14oz, but can use the whole can. 1 cup of rice, 2 tbsp butter, 3/4 lb grated cheddar, 4 oz 2% milk poured over top before baking and 1 cup keebler club crackers crushed over top. I also added salt and pepper to the top before adding the crackers. Very good!

This was okay, but not great. Be careful not to overcook the vegetables. However, many of my family members really liked it.

This was a favorite in my family.  It was a little too much on the butter, but we like that sort of thing.  I will make this again.  My husband loved it.

Pretty good rice dish.  I doubled the rice, only used about 1-2 tablespoons of butter, and maybe 1/2 of the cheese (i used velveeta).  I used raw broccoli and cauliflower so they would still have some crunch and it made the dish easier. Will make again.

I had a couple of issues with the directions in this recipe being too vague. First off, it doesn't say how much water to cook the rice, or the vegetables in. What do you mean by cooking the vegetables until crunchy? They are crunchy to begin with. Simmering them for 10 minutes makes them softer. Also, the recipe doesn't specify if this should be cooked covered or not. I cooked it uncovered and it was fine. WAY too much cheese. Next time I am going to use 1/2 a pound. I also recommend melting together the cheese, cream of broccoli soup (I used broccoli instead of chicken as I'm a vegetarian) and milk in a separate sauce pan before mixing with the veggies and rice.

Oh wow, loved this. I had fresh broccoli and cauliflower to use up so decided to try this. Yum. I added some garlic powder and used mozzarella cheese (rather than processed) melted into the chicken soup and milk (1.5 cup)Excellent! The crumbs (which I stirred in with melted butter) added a lot. Will make again.

My son and I made this for Thanksgiving.  We used fresh broccoli and cauliflower.  We cooked it 10 min and that was too long!  Six or seven would have been better.  That being said it was sort of a really mushy dish, but still tasted delicious.  I like the Ritz crackers on the top, it added a lot!

My changes, used cream of asparagus soup to make it vegetarian.  Used a partial jar of cheese sauce and some processed cheese. 

We will definitely make it again, just not over-cook the veggies.

This was really good. I used instant brown rice and I put soup, milk and 1 cup grated cheddar cheese in a small saucepan and cooked over low heat until the cheese was melted.I used regular saltines on  top and poured a little melted butter over them.

Wonderful recipe was making this for a vegetarian friend so I replaced the cream of chicken with cream of broccoli, which worked out beautifully. Everyone mentioned how 'soupy' the recipe could get so I was very careful but once I added the veggies to the cheese and milk mixture, I used whole milk 1/4 cup butter and mild cheddar brick not processed, I thought it looked dry and added more cheese and milk. I made it soupy, remember the vegetables have only been par boiled and will therefore release liquid as they cook. I also put the casserole under the broiler for two minutes to make the top crunchy. The whole recipe went down to great acclaim and I will be sharing and making this again.

I was pleasantly surpised after reading some of the reviews but I really liked this!  I did use real (chedder)cheese instead of the processed stuff and a lot less butter to saute onions to make it a little healthier.  Oh, also I used frozen vegys and didn't cook them, just added them frozen to be easier.  But overall really yummy and cheesey.  My vegy hating husband even ate it.

I made this for dinner tonight & we liked it.  I did tweek it a bit though.  We're cheese freaks here, so processed cheese doesn't cut it with us.  :)  I used a 1# block of extra sharp cheddar, cubed.  I used frozen broccoli/cauliflower, I cut the butter in half & doubled the rice (per other reviews).  I melted the cheese in the butter before adding anything else, which worked out great.  I also used crushed croutons in place of crackers since I had them on hand.  I had no problem with the sauce being soupy, in fact it was rich & creamy.  I will use this recipe again.

Very tasty and easy to make.  It has become one of my staples when entertaining.  I couldn't make the top crunchy enough for my taste.  For an alternative top, try a little sour cream diluted slightly with milk, then sprinkle parmesan cheese on top before baking.

This is a versatile recipe, you can change it any way you want, use different cheeses, add meat, etc. I personally never cook with processed cheese and have used Cream Cheese, Monterrey Jack, Gouda, Parmesan, cheddar, colby...sometimes four different kinds of cheeses. And it's great with cubed pit ham.

I made this dish a bit differently, but it turned out great.  I used 1 cup of rice, 1 full head of cauliflower and 2 broccoli crowns (we like veggies), 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 pound of grated Gruyere and 1/2 pound of grated mild cheddar, and 16oz of cottage cheese (instead of the soup and milk).  I used the same method and used the crackers on the top.  It was lower fat and really cheezy.

I gave this recipe 4 start simply for the fact that it gave me a great idea for dinner.  I rarely cook things as is and this was no exception.  I used frozen jasmine rice for convenience.  No need to cook just throw it in.  I added a cup of corn and precooked chicken strips.  You know the kind in the refrigerated section.  I also used shredded sharp white cheddar cheese insted of velveeta(i'm not a fan) and whole wheat ritz crackers and a couple Tablespoons of butter.  It was delicious and not runny at all.  Give the white cheddar a try.

Not a lot of flavor, but still comfort food. (I cut the cheese in half and used fat free half and half). It needs salt.

Really really good! To cut down on fat/calories, we changed a few things: Illiminated the butter/onion step and just used onion powder, did not put ANY butter in. Used low fat cream of chicken soup. Substituted Kraft "Melting" shredded cheddar/american mix cheese sprinkled on top. Also, cooked everything through beforehand and just put in oven to melt cheese and toast crackers!

I made this tonight....it was GREAT...we had a couple over for dinner and they both loved it and asked for the recipe.  I put fresh mushrooms sliced in the butter with the onions.  I also didn't have american cheese so I used a jar of mild con queso I had in the closet and a can of cream of mushroom with the cream of chicken soup. Thanks for the recipe it will be
 passed around.

Hubby and I liked this well enough, though it wasn't a huge hit with the kids. I doubled the recipe and we had it reheated the following night with sausage added in - the kids like it this was a little better.

I changed it just a little and the results were great. Used shredded cheddar cheese in place of processed cheese and increased the rice to 1 cup, also used the whole head of cauliflower and the whole bunch of broccoli both of which were over 10 ounces. This would be great for a pot luck or family gathering.

This recipe was great, although i didn't follow it to a "T".  I used 1 cup uncooked rice instead of a half cup.  I didn't measure the broccoli or cauliflower, and I used fresh, not frozen.  Although I used so much rice, I still only used one can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup (that's all I had!) and 1 8oz jar of cheeze whiz, which was also all I had on hand.  The casserole turned out great!  My 5,2 and 1 year old gobbled it up!! Especially my 5 year old, who wasn't interested in the broccoli until I convinced her to taste it!  She ate all that was on her plate!  Thank you for the recipe!  We have enough for dinner tomorrow night too!

I halved the recipe.  We loved the texture, not too mushy, of the parboiled rice and the blanched veggies.  It was very tasty.

Unbelievable!  My cauliflower-despising husband had 2 helpings.  Kids wanted more.  Thank you so much--I'm doing my victory dance....(I used frozen broc & cauli, and 1/2 pound proc cheese w/ 1/2 pound shred cheddar, and increased to 1 cup rice.)

Have made this recipe twice.  Very good - well liked by my family.  I did double the rice, the broccoli & the cauliflower.  Used grated cheddar cheese and did not use as much as recipe called for.  Makes a lot of food but reheats beautifully.

I've made this twice - first as is and second with some changes because it was too rich and too good not to eat more than once a year. I steamed fresh veggies; used half butter, half olive oil and used 2 cloves of garlic with the onion; used low sodium cream of chicken; used 8 oz sharp cheddar; sprinkled cheese on top and skipped the crackers. Also sprinkled some dried thyme and basil into the mixture. Next time I will add some ham and some other veggies as well. Now I won't feel guilty serving this once a month.

I fixed this dish intending for it to be a side dish, but my husband said he didn't want anything else with it, so it was the entire meal! Plus, he ate over half of the pan by himself. So, I will be fixing it again. The only change I made was to use frozen broccoli and cauliflower, which helped cut down on prep time. It was a little too cheesy in places, but I think it would help to cut the cheese into smaller pieces next time. Yum!!!

When I was making this, my brother and his girlfriend were making comments about how this was going to be yucky b/c cauliflower has no taste....well let me tell you how they both could not get enough of this when we sat down to dinner.  This was soooo good and easy to make and everyone inhaled it!  There were no leftovers to enjoy the next day.

This was a big hit.  I followed the recipe, except I only used 1/2 cup milk (2% milk, used a whole cup of brown rice, instead of a half cup of white rice, cooked minced garlic with onions and topped with shredded cheddar instead of crackers.  I'm sure I'll make this again soon.  It would even make a satisfying main dish if you added ham, chicken or turkey.

Disappointing dish. My family hardly touched this dish and asked me not to make it again. They said the texture and the overpowering flavor of cheese was too much. My husband said it tasted like melted cheese with rice. I agree. While I won't say its terrible, it is certainly only marginal at best. It also takes alot of dishes to make which is not helpful during a holiday meal.

this was a great starter recipe but I made a few changes to fit my family... I used a pound and a half of processed cheese and about a cup of shredded cheddar under the topping to bring out the flavor. I also sauteed some mushrooms in with the onions and butter... no leftovers here!

Great recipe.  Made the following changes:  all cauliflower, real cheddar cheese, garlic and onion powder, water chestnuts used La Choy Chow Mein noodles for topping and more cheddar instead of crackers!  Turned out great with lots of flavor and crunch!

This was very good!  I made this in the morning and then stuck it in the fridge until the evening.  Then I just added the crackers and baked it for 35 - 40 minutes instead of the 30 minutes called for in the recipe.  Next time I'll try adding chicken and more veggies for some variety.

This recipe is great as is....I wouldn't change a thing!  Great as a leftover too!  I have made it many times and I am always asked for the recipe.  Just recently I made it with 2 packages of broccoli and it was tasty that way too!  Great casserole :)!

My family really liked this dish, I didn't have crackers, but topped with chedder cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking, was a little soupy the night I cooked it, but the next evening it was perfect, it also seem to taste even better after sitting, will make the night before next time

What a tasty combination!  I found the flavors very complimenting to each other.  I added fried onions to the top for a little extra crunch.  I was very delicious, but I can't imagine someone pregnant making this constantly.  I was way too impatient to wait for a dish like this!

Was a decent recipe to start with but I made some changes in order to fit my needs. I cooked broccoli and cauliflower in the same pan (why dirty 2?). Instead of a can of condensed soup, I added some flour to the butter after my onions cooked, then stirred in a little chicken broth and the milk until thickened. Then added shredded cheddar cheese instead. Then added rice and broc/caul and put it all in a pan, topped with panko bread crumbs and some more shredded cheddar. Was very good this way!

I used 1cup of brown basmati rice instead of white.  I used 1/2 low fat milk.  And used about 6.5 oz of Colby jack in the casserole and sprinkled another 2 oz of cheddar on top. I sprinkled black pepper on it.  It turned out delicious.  I will make it again

First, we absolutely loved it ... but I'll admit to having modified it quite a bit based on what I had in the house and also because some of the ingredients just made no sense to me (sorry). I know that some reviewers will feel that I am no longer rating this recipe because of the modifications so that's why I am stating this up front. But what we ended up with was spectacular and my wife is asking me to make it again tonight for her to take to a pot-luck meal she is attending. Here are my modifications: 

I doubled the amount of rice (we like Basmati) because it simply appeared that there would be too much moisture otherwise, and then cooked it in chicken broth instead of water (which I always do). I almost died when I read that it called for one pound of processed cheese food (I figured we would be constipated for a month) ... so I dialed that back to half a pound of shredded Canadian cheddar (that's all I had). We had no cream chicken soup so I used mushroom instead. I added 2 tsp crushed garlic when sauteing the onion ... and 1 tsp seasoning salt and 2 tsp vegetable spice to the mix before putting it in the baking dish. I had no crackers for the top so simply used Italian-style breadcrumbs (we use Aurora - which has Italian Romano cheese in with the crumbs).

Absolutely delicious.  I made the mistake of leaving out the milk and will definitely add it next time.  For health sake even though we were using processed chesse, I left out a lot of the butter. ;-)  My husband says he wants this on a regular basis and I agree!

Made this recipe with the advice of others, using 1 cup cooked rice, half the amount of butter and processed cheese. I used 16oz of both broccoli and cauliflower. I felt like this was too bland for my tastes. Some bites were good ( the cheesier bites) and other bites were not. I tend to agree on another users comments amount the buttery crackers not being that good on top. It was good to have a crunch, but they were tasteless to me. IF I make this again I would use more cheese, probably the original amount of 16 oz. And possible add melted butter to my crushed crackers before sprinkling them on. I think that would be way better.

Made using homemade cheese sauce since we don't eat processed cheese food, and it was really good.  It reminds me of what my grandmother used to make, and it a good use for all this broccoli and cauliflower from the garden!

Family ate the whole pan. I did modify the dish a bit...instead of boiling the white rice in water, I used 1 can of clear chicken broth; I also double the rice...therefore I cooked 1 cup of rice; added a medium sized garlic clove (minced) to the onion and sauteed all; added about a tsp of ground black pepper.  I was sure to use fresh cauliflower (4 cups) and fresh brocolli (4 cups).  This was an awesome meal...i can see myself adding about 2 cups of diced chicken for a complete meal!!!

Good base recipe.  Just made this but with healthy changes.  I used brown rice, 1 tblspn coconut oil in pace of the 1/2 cup butter, 2 onions instead of 1,  9 oz shredded cheese instead of processed product, vegetable broth plus a vegan seasoning cube instead of chicken broth, almond milk in place of cows', 2 tblspns Chia for thickening & fiber.  Will use 1 cup brown rice & minced garlic clove next time.

Delicious.  I used mushroom soup instead of chicken, and I cooked the water out of 14 oz of mushrooms and added that. I used Velveeta as my "processed cheese food".  Next time I will use something that looks nicer for the crunch on the top, the crushed crackers made it look a bit underwhelming.

OMG! I"M IN LOVE! My family loved this recipe.  I did follow others advice to double the rice and a little less butter (more than 1/4 but less than a 1/2) I used 5 wrapped slices of processed cheese food. One can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup ( Campbells sells 1 can with chicken and mushroom mixed together) added salt and pepper and garlic. Thank you for such a great recipe! My family wants it for dinner again very soon.

I made this last night for my family and it was FANTASTIC!  This will be a regular in our house.  I also doubled the rice, and used half the butter, as some reviewers have stated.  I also substituted the velveeta cheese for colby cheese (that's what I had handy).  This is a truly wonderful recipe.  Thanks Bridg!

Added garlic to the onion and doubled the rice as other reviewers recommended.  This was fantastic and my husband LOVED it. I think I may try to make it healther next time with less cheese and brown rice.

Did some changes based on other's comments. Sauteed x2 diced garlic cloves with onion. Used low fat/sodium cream of chicken soup, cut butter down to 1/4, increased rice to 1 C. & mixed soup with milk before adding. As well, did not use "processed cheese food" - is that Cheez-Whiz? - used shredded cheddar, mozarella. Very tasty, filling recipe.

Anyone who wants their kids to eat more veggies should try this recipe.  It was delicious and pretty easy to make.

Loved it, and I am usually very anti-casserole. It was perfect b/c I had a bag of broccoli and cauliflower that I needed to use up before it went bad and leftover rice. So easy! A few changes I made--I added a bit of garlic to the cooking onions, some ground pepper to the finished mixture, and due to using what I had on hand just used about 3-4 cups of leftover cooked rice which had a tiny bit of ground beef in it, used ~6 slices of american cheese and a cup or so of shredded cheddar cheese. Great for leftovers on hand (would be good w/ chicken or beef too). Sounds odd, but my husband also added some hot sauce to his serving and loved it.

This is a really yummy recipe and a great way to get lots of veggies into your meal. I added more rice and a couple of chicken breasts to make it more of a main dish. I forgot to add the crushed cracker topping and it made me sad, because that would have made it even better. I'll be making this again!

This is the ultimate comfort food.  I could sit down and eat the entire casserole.  I enjoy the sliced and sauted onions in it, so I put in extra onion.  I cut the cheese down to 1/4 the amount, as it just seemed like too much, and it was still very cheesy and good.  I've made it a bunch of times and it is good each and every time.

Yummm! As suggested by other readers, I used brown rice and doubled it's quantity (1 cup uncooked). I used crushed Breton crackers on top... delicious! It made for fantastic leftover the next day and the crackers, even if they were soft, were very tasty.  I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. Used one head of broccoli and one head of cauliflower and there was a ton of food.  Made the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect.  Next time I will try all broccoli.  This recipe is very similar to the broccoli casserole at a restaurant nearby and I have been searching for something similar for quite a while so thank you.

This casserole is tasty but really really runny.  My mother asked that I make it again for Thanksgiving.  I plan on eliminating or at least decreasing the milk and adding more rice.  I read a previous review suggestign 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 white cheddar so I think I'll give it a shot!

mmmmmmmmmm!  I made it with 1/2 the butter, it would have been way too greasy for our family.. next time I make it, I will use between 1/2 and 3/4 the amount of velveeta.. it was just a bit too heavy and salty with it. Also, I used cream of mushroom - because I had it on hand.  Even the baby (9 months) loved it! (NOTE:  be very careful with babies and salt - their kidneys are not not able yet to tolerate a lot of salt! This meal was definitely pushing it and could not be his entire supper)

This casserole traditionally is made with rice, but with the amount of food (namely carbs) we eat during a Thanksgiving dinner, I omit the rice.  Just leaves more room for stuffing!  In my opinion, you can taste the dish much better - the flavors of the veggies and cheese are more pronounced and not soaked up by the rice.  It's yumaroo!

First off I didn’t have cauliflower so it was broccoli casserole.  I steamed my broccoli over my rice as it was cooking.  I used about three rounded tablespoons of cheese spread because that’s what I had at home, and I also used 3 cooked chicken breast to make it a meal.  Oh! And I did not use the crackers, the casserole is really good without it why add all those calories if you don’t need them.

This is very high in fat and calories, but who cares?  It's really yummy, and you only live once!  I add chopped water chestnuts to give it a little crunchiness, and omit the crackers on top.  A great recipe, though!  Thanks!!!

Unfortunately, my family and I were not crazy about this.  I did make a few changes, such as cut the butter to 2 Tbsp., added 1 cup rice, and only 12 oz. of cheese.  We still felt as though this was too cheesy and runny.  Thanks for the recipe, but I won't be making this again.

This was a very good dish, however I found it was much too cheesy.  The next time I make it I am going to double up on the vegetables.  Hopefully it will have a less intense cheesy flavor.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes veges with cheese!

This was fabulous!  Made it exactly as the recipe was written. However, I think that this recipe is way to fattening to eat more than once or twice a year.  Goes great with a traditional Thanksgiving meal.

This was delicious!  My 16 month old son will not eat any vegetables at all.  Since the brocolli and cauliflower were "disguised" he couldn't get enough of it!  My 4 year old told me it was delicious.  Two thumbs up!

This was very good! I ate it for a couple days straight. Before it is baked it does make a great brocolli/cauliflower cheese soup. After you bake it the cheese flavor does intesify. For those complaining it is soupy..if you don't follow the portions ie. altering milk, cheese or ommitting rice may cause this. I prefered it without the crackers. They were soggy the next day.

I followed this recipe to the letter. I took this dish to a family reunion.  I should have doubled the recipe because there was nothing left to bring home.  EVERYONE told me it was the most delicious they've had.

Made this tonight for supper and everyone loved it ! Even my picky 12 year old ate it.  I added some fresh garlic to the onions and used mushroom soup instead of chicken soup.  Thanks for sharing

I halved the recipe, used a 16-oz bag of frozen broccoli, and omitted the crackers.  My husband LOVED this.  He had 3 helpings and kept saying how good it was.  A definite keeper in our household!

Yum.  This would be easy to cut this recipe in 1/2 because it makes a lot.  The crackers are good the first time, but get soggy.  So maybe sprinkle them on as you eat it.  :)

For a healthier version, I used half as much butter, and substituted olive oil for the other half.  Also, I used low sodium cream of chicken soup.  The result was delicious!  I will definitely make it again and again!  Thanks.

I made this without the rice and used fresh broccoli and cauliflower. I increased the quantity of broccoli & cauliflower to 11 oz. each (using a kitchen scale), and pre-cooked the veggies  with the sauteed onion for about 10 min with 1/4 cup of water in my large covered frying pan. Then I added the soup, milk and cubed Velveeta, and cooked covered on low heat until the cheese melted. Then I put into a 9X13 glass baking dish at 300 degrees F  for 1 hour, because we had appetizers at a neighbor's house. I also omitted the crushed cracker topping. It turned out beautifully. Wish I had taken a picture.

I really like this recipe and so do the rest of my family! I even managed to make it twice in a week xD.  I added some carrots too and cut the crackers in favor of another cheese layer, cut back on the butter a bit and actually used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. What a wonderful dish!

I wasn't really sure how to rate this. I hate it when people change a recipe and then rate it and I'm sure that made as stated it would be delicious. However, due to health issues, I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and the pound of "processed" cheese to a half pound of shredded cheddar and used reduced fat/sodium mushroom soup. I also upped the milk to a soup can as it seemed a little dry, I suppose due to less butter and cheese. It was delicious. I topped with a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs and grated Parmesan to cut the carbs and some of the salt. The next time I'll try it with some cubed ham or left over rotisserie chicken as a main dish casserole.

I made this 16 years ago and it was a go-to recipe.  In the last 8 years we have been vegan and tonite I modified it as best as I knew how and it was awesome!!  I'm sure I would never have used that much butter.  You don't need butter at all to saute onions.  My husband says I'm a genious.  That's all that matters!

total comfort food goodness.  only used a couple tbsp of butter to saute' the onions.  added a bit of chopped garlic to the last 30 seconds.  added the liquid ingredients and cheese to the pot to melt down the cheese in the sauce.  added the rice & veggies at the end. I eyeballed the amt of rice and fresh steamed broccoli and cauliflower, maybe added a tad more milk once I got it mixed together.   I do know I cooked 1 cup rice, and maybe added 3/4 of it.  only 8 oz velveeta, and 8 oz shredded sharp cheddar.  I liked this combo, as I am not a total velveeta fan much.  this has a really nice flavor, can be seasoned to anyone's liking.  Love the ritz cracker topping. 
great to take to functions and potlucks.  this is a keeper recipe.  thanks so much!

My family loved this! Zero leftovers! Next time I will leave the vegetables in larger pieces for more CRUNCH. I used about twice the rice and half the cheese. It was gorgeous and creamy and delicious. Thank you for this super recipe. I will be making it from now on, I think it would make a nice side dish at a holiday or fancy dinner.

Turned out pretty good, I added some pre-cooked shredded chicken to the mix and served it as a main dish. Like some of the others, I used seasoned bread crumbs on top. Next time though I might try cream of bacon soup instead of chicken. Seemed like something that could be made even better with bacon!

Great recipe. A few changes to suit my taste.Added  Garlic powder,white mushrooms, pepper., more cheese and milk for consistency and crumbs.  Also used egg noodles instead of rice.
Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe  pretty much as written except I cut the butter in half and used a little less of the cheese.  Everyone loved it including the kids!!  Will definitely make again.

Yummy.  I made this for a dinner party of 9.  It was more than enough.  I was glad there were leftovers for me to eat the next day.

It was good.  The cheese needed to melt a bit more in mine, so next time I would cut the cube up smaller so they melt quicker, but over all tasted great!

I expected more out of this dish.  I used brown rice cooked in chicken broth, real cheddar cheese (instead of Velveeta), and covered the dish with buttered bread crumbs (instead of Ritz crackers).  The flavor just wasn't there.  I won't make this dish again.

I agree with many others.  Good recipe.  I used 1/2 the butter, 1/3 the cheese, doubled the rice  and added 1 1/2 cups of fresh, off the cob, in season corn.  The corn adds an extra crunch and sweetness.  Next time I will add some cayenne pepper for a extra layer of flavor.  This has a freshness perfect for family gathering.  I did also use white cheddar Cheez-it for the topping.

Saute minced garlic with half onion in 2 tbsp butter then add cooked rice/cauliflower mixture with 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 cup of milk in pan. Stir until smooth. Pour mixture in casserole dish and toss with half mozzarella and half cheddar cheese mixture . Top with breadcrumbs.  Bake approx. 30 min. A definite crowd pleaser.  Arborio rice worked great but make sure you boil it al dente.  Do not overcook.

This is yummy..I made it with a tablespoon of butter, added garlic, some Cajun seasoning, cream of mushroom soup instead, 1/2 and 1/2 and less of the processed cheese, plus added mushrooms and it is really awesome...great recipe...It's really creamy and you can make a whole meal just out of this! Plus I deleted the crackers...

I followed the directions almost exactly. I didn't have processed cheese food (whatever that is) so I used 8 oz of shredded cheddar cheese and it was delicious.

I didn't have all ingredients, so substituted shredded cheddar, mozzarella and Monterey cheese, I use jasmine rice, no ritz crackers so I used stove stop, chicken flavor stuffing for topping,  Delish! (I added 1 jalapeño pepper & oregano to onion sauté,  salt, pepper & garlic to taste).
Very simple and definitely a dish that would be great for the Holidays!

Made it; loved it; only a few changes. I never measure anything, but I used all of the same ingredients except very little butter, and added ground pepper, and left over cooked, shredded  chicken. I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom.  This was awesome. Shared with my grown children! They loved it too!

Trying this my way :) Using up fresh cauliflower, broccoli and carrots today at my house. Steamed them after cleaning and cutting into bit sized pieces. Kept them separate so steaming was accurate. Had about 4 c each broccoli and cauliflower cooked and about 2 c cooked carrots. Divided veg between three casseroles (one bigger than the others). In each I put one third of each type of veggie. Don't use canned soup so I made 5 c medium cream sauce with olive oil, butter, flour and veg broth (homemade), add sauteed onions, garlic thyme, parsley, sage and rosemary. In whatever amount suits your taste. add at least 1 cup of sauce to each casserole and mix(big one will take at least two c). First batch will get buttered crumbs when it gets used/cooked off on Wednesday night dinner with pork chops and tossed salad. The second casserole will get white sauce & sautéed fresh mushrooms and will be topped with crumbled bacon. This will be the main dish on Thursday with lemon-butter asparagus and fresh fruit. And lastly the bigger dish will get at least two c white sauce 1 cup cooked rice, sautéed chicken, cheese and sauteed fresh mushrooms for Sunday dinner per the recipe above. So using the basic premise to make three dishes out of a lot of veggies. Also makes cooking easier in the week. Smells great so far looking forward to the results:)Thanks!

Perfect! I used fresh cauliflower and broccoli and also used freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese and 4 oz. of cream cheese instead of the processed stuff. Just fabulous! Next time I might try it with some leftover cubed ham :)

I made this recipe just as it specified and I have to say that though the flavor is good if not a little over-powering with the onion, it came out a little wetter than I would have liked.  I couldn't believe the amount of butter or cheese it called for, but I don't like to rate a recipe after I've made adjustments to it.  If I make this again, I will definitely make some changes.

Had to make some modifications, but it was fantastic!  Twice as much rice, and a 1/2 pound of mozarella instead of the processed cheese.

I liked this recipe, though I changed a *bunch* of stuff for my preferences.  First, I used frozen cauliflower and broccoli, which I steamed for almost 10 minutes before adding to the casserole.  Next time I will use fresh veggies and steam them a little longer because the texture was kind of tough.  I omitted the onions because I just don't like them, so there was no need for the butter.  I substituted 1-2 cups of shredded carrots for the rice to increase the veggie content and that worked (plus it added a nice pop of color).  I used cream of mushroom soup because I had it on hand and about 2/3 a pound of extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I melted the cheese with the soup and milk before adding the veggies since the cheddar cubes needed a little more time to integrate into the sauce.  After baking for 30 minutes the flavor was good, but the sauce was runny and the veggies were still too crisp.  So I baked it for another hour in 20 minute increments.  It ended up being ok that night, but the next day it was awesome.  The leftover factor took it from 3 stars to 4.  If I can work out the kinks (thicken the sauce, soften the veggies), I might get mine up to 5 star status.

I had a couple of bags of chopped broccoli and cauliflower to use up, so I thought I'd make this on a cold winter day! I made a few changes, and it was delicious. I sauteed the onions and some garlic in a tablespoon of butter while the rice cooked. I then added the milk, a few cups. I didn't have any soup around, so I added a slab of cream cheese and a can of diced chicken. Instead of processed cheese (ewww...do people actually eat that junk?) I added some shredded cheddar cheese, as others did. Without pre-cooking the broccoli and cauliflower I just added them raw to the bubbling milk sauce, simmered it for awhile, added the rice, and let it thicken a little bit! After pouring it in the baking dish, I topped it with some crushed crackers (9 grain from costco) and some more shredded cheese, and it baked perfectly, creamy and flavorful! I think other veggies would be delicious as well. Enjoy!

Loved it! The only recommendation is to bake it as soon as your ready to eat. If you know you will have left overs add a bit of more milk b4 reheating it so you can have that same warm creamy and cheesy taste.

I like it after I doubled the broccoli and rice, used less butter, used a can of cream of cheddar cheese soup instead of chicken and just a smattering of grated parmesan cheese. Then topped with the crushed crackers mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter. I added fresh ground pepper to bring out flavor's and a shake of salt and ground garlic.

I made this almost exactly like the recipe, except I reduced the butter a little, and I forgot to put in the milk. I hadn't bought processed cheese for a long time, but I bought a box and used it. Will probably try it with regular block cheese next time. That said, we loved it. I will definitely make it again...and will probably play around with it a bit. I don't think I'll bother with the milk the next time either. It's very good. Oh and I did put a few of the canned onion rings on the top just because I like those things.

I'm not sure where  the reviews saying it has no taste is coming from It's absolutely great! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit... There was hardly any left! I'm making it again tonight as per request by my brother  but I'm adding chicken to make it a full meal. We  LOVE this recipe!

Great recipe. I made some adjustments to make it gluten free. It didn't have a ton of flavor, so it was a great side to a strong main dish.

I Love this recipe.  I read a lot of reviews and altered as others had.  I wanted this to be a bit healthy so naturally I cut back on the amount of cheese.  I cut back a little with the butter however, next time I will cut back even more and/or use cocunut oli instead.  I felt that there was no real need for all that butter.  Only my opinion of course.  I also added left over Turkey.
After makeing this last night for supper I figured out what I would do differently.  I would make a roux and have this as a cheese sauce.  
I will make this again since after all it was so good even with the alterations that I had made.

Great recipe!  I modified it by using quinoa instead of rice, reducing the amount of butter, but using croutons on top and using cream of mushroom soup!  A mix of healthy and unhealthy but super delicious!!!!

I have just started learning how to cook, and yet this turned out delicious. One of the best things I've ever made, it's way better than my mom's casserole even! I cannot recommend this enough :) I used frozen veggies and added some pepper and grated some mozzarella on top. I wish my boyfriend loved cauliflower and broc as much as I do, he's really missing out.

Pretty good! Three of us (myself, hubby, and toddler son) liked it, one (toddler daughter) did not. I omitted the rice, reduced the milk, and increased the cheese until the consistency looked right. I prefer the "roasted garlic cauliflower" recipe on this site, but this is a nice alternative.

I began by sauteing a medium red onion, Portobello mushrooms, and minced garlic in Extra Virgin olive oil then adding broccoli and cauliflower florets to the pan while at the same time boiling water for my brown rice.  For the soup mixture, I combined by whisking 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup, 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, 5 oz. of whole milk, and a tbsp of chopped fresh basil. To assemble the casserole, I placed the cooked brown rice in a 9x13 glass baking dish along with a finely chopped bunch of scallions and then mixed in my veggies from the pan.  Next, I folded in my soup mixture and 8 oz. of grated Extra Sharp Cheddar cheese.  Before placing in the 350 degrees F. oven, I topped everything off with a generous layer of Italian style bread crumbs to form a nice and savory crust.  Woooooo Buddy, I gotta say, this was Delicious with a capital "D."  Served with a spicy coated chicken breast and boiled egg slices, this was a fantastic meal which earned me the prized golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

Great basic recipe. I used 1 cup brown rice, 12-16 oz each frozen broccoli and cauliflower and added 2 TBL minced garic when sauteing the onion.  Absolutely fabulous.  Sure to make this again, including next week for Thanksgiving.  Big Hit at our Bunco Thanksgiving last night.  Highy recommend.

It turned out well, but I incorporated many of the changes I saw in other reviews.  I used 2 T. of butter, and some olive oil; a cup of brown rice, and added three chopped leeks to the onion.  I also used grated cheddar instead of cheese product and, to be a little bad, put a few deep-fried onions on top instead of crackers.  It is a versatile dish, as other vegetables and/or meat could be added.  It is important to not overcook the vegetables and ruin their nutritional value and flavor.

Used one cup of rice, less butter, cheddar and colby cheese, fresh veggies and cream of mushroom soup(for my vegetarian),  It was delicious and will definitely make it again.

Used only broccoli and no cauliflower or onion. Used about 2 c. pre-cooked white rice, less butter, ~1/2 lb of cheddar, 1/2 c. of milk and cheez-it style crackers on top. It was a bit bland, but not bad. 8 month old really liked the texture! That alone means I'll be making it again.

I used cream of mushroom soup, a brown/wild rice blend, shredded colby jack (just can't bring myself to use the processed cheese) and added two cloves of garlic. It was very good but definitely not lo-cal! I have no idea how much 10 ounces of broccoli or cauliflower is, so I may have used too much because the ratio of rice to veggies was off. Next time I'll use more like a cup of rice.

I made this for the first time when I had company over.  Everyone really enjoyed it!  I would add a bit more rice next time because it ended up a bit runny and a little extra rice will help soak up the liquid.

I loved this recipe!  Only made a couple additions....garlic with the onions, some dry mustard, added carrots with the veggies, and used Panko on the top (tossed with melted butter first so that it doesn't burn).  I also had some left over rice from the night before which was a boxed 'roasted chicken' flavor so I only added 1 cup of white rice to the mix.   I think this is going to be a holiday favorite, time to replace those old boring veggies at Thanksgiving!!

This is one of the first recipes I ever made from this site.  I couldn't remember where I got the recipe and tried to reproduce it a couple times without success.  I finally came across it today and I'm making it right now.  Here are the couple changes I made: used 1 cup brown minute rice, about 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 a large brick of cubed cheddar + 3 Kraft singles, 1 can of mushroom soup, no milk and Premium Plus crackers on top.  Awesome!  UPDATE: If I try to make this without the recipe, it always fails

A little bland for our taste, definitely had to add some salt and pepper before eating.  However the whole pan did disappear very quickly.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty!  The only change I made was to double the rice as others suggested.  My husband and 1 year old daughter also loved it!

This was just OK.  It does need salt, maybe a half tsp.  But I cook with unsalted butter, maybe thats why.

Easy and tasty.  I did add additional seasoning and for our taste it could have used a little more but, it was a big hit at the Thanksgiving table.  My nephew was a huge fan.  What was great was that even someone who doesn't like veggies will eat this because of the rice, cheese and distraction.

I normally just boil cauliflower and broccoli until their soft but semi-firm, and mashing the together, with shredded sharp cheddar and salt and pepper to taste. 

This year, I wanted to try a variation of the broccoli and cauliflower so I went straight to Allrecipes.com and found this one and Cauliflower and Broccoli Bake. I could not make up my mind so I made both - to the recipe. They were both so awesome I could not decide upon a favorite. 

It was creamy and flavorful and I will definitely make this a Thanksgiving traditon.

I might make this again if all I have on hand is frozen veggies.  But it's just much too overpowering for fresh broccoli and cauliflower -- their tastes are completely overpowered by the cheesy soupiness.  Which is hard to do to such strong vegetables.  And what a loss.

This was decent - but there seemed to be something missing. First of all, it was way too runny and made a mess of my oven. It either doesn't need the milk - or needs a beaten egg or two mixed in. I don't think it's too much cheese like some other reviewers have suggested. I wasn't crazy about the butter cracker topping, either. I think bread crumbs would have sufficed. Just a so-so recipe with some obvious flaws for us.

I thought that this dish was good, but the rest of the family said it was just ok. I had to use cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken. Next time I'll definitely cut the recipe in half.

I actually added diced chicken to this as well (the pre-cooked kind in the bag), which made it a little more of a "meal" and was very good.  The only complaint I had was that it took so many pots and pans! A little too many dishes to do :-)

this is only "ok".  I'm convinced that those that think otherwise haven't eaten good food.  Adding the can of condensed soup made it taste like just that - and kind of bad to boot.  If I did ever make this again, out of needing to get rid of rice or for a quick "ok" meal... I don't think I'd put the onion in there either.  It was okay at first, but the next day reheated... well... let's just say the onion overpowers the chicken flavor and it tastes like onion gravy with slimy chunks of onions and mushy rice.  If including the onion, dice it really small or else use onion powder?  I don't know.

Fabulous, but I made the following changes for lower fat content and extra flavor: increased rice to 1 cup +, used half the cheese recommended (used "Light" Velveeta) instead, used less than half the butter recommended, tossed in last night's leftover chicken sauted with blackened sweet peppers and Ital seasonings, skipped the cauliflower b/c using leftover broccoli, skipped crackers...was still very cheesy...will use for leftovers again.

This was tasty, but I had to add some pepper to enhance the flavor somewhat and I definitely think it needs more rice.  I will be making it again with a couple modifications.

This is good.  Might as well add chicken for a full meal.

very good =)  i added the milk slowly while stirring in case it would become soupy as some others stated was an issue.  add more or less depending on your texture choice.  i used what the recipe called for and it came out just right-not soupy at all. great side dish and awesome for a potlock dish.  i used a 1/2 block velveeta = 1 lb and it turned out yummy, thank you!

Very easy recipe.  I used a cup of rice instead of a 1/2 cup.  I also used The processed cheese in the jar.  Easier to work with and to cook with.

I couldn't stop eating it before I even baked it in the oven! 
I made this days in advance and froze it before I put the crackers on top. Defrosted in the fridge the night before I needed it, cooked according to directions after toping with crackers!

I was VERY hesitant at first especially given that there was rice in it and I would have prefered it being just veggies, but it really was AMAZING!  Even better the next day!  I used Swiss cheese slices (.5 lb) since that's all I had and it was divine!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The adjustments I made were - I left out the milk, and used cream of mushroom soup because a vegetarian was eating with us.  I did not think the flavors melded well.  It was a layer of vegetables, a layer of cheese and then crackers on top - the flavors did not mix together.  Only half was eaten and no one commented that it was good.

I liked it well enough to make it again but I would cut the cheese in half next time. It was also good with chicken in it and french-fried onions on top.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is a very good dish as is.What I am looking for though is some input from people that have made this,it's good like it is but what could I add to it to give it some more flavor.Like some spices that would add to it and blend well.I'm not much of a cook but I'm trying so I'm coming to you for help.It just tasted like it could use something to give it some depth.To me it was just a little bland.

My family and I loved this recipe!  I too, left out the milk, as suggested by some other reviewers, and it came out fine.  I also used American cheese slices torn up into strips, because that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again!

YUM!  Great casserole.  I make it differently each time.  Sometimes I'll add bread crumbs instead of rice and I always leave out the milk.  Ritz crackers are a must!!!  Don't cook the vegetables as long as the recipe states, though!!  This is my husband's FAVORITE!!!

AMAZING!  For the first time, I made the entire Easter meal and this recipe was by far the favorite dish. My family could not stop raving about this casserole!  I am positive I will be asked to make this time and time again. Note:  My family hates rice, so I left it out.  This dish couldn't have been any better.

We weren't thrilled with the casserole, too sticky, but it makes a terrific soup.  Cook the broccoli and cauliflower in 4-6 cups water (I added some chicken base also)  Then add the rest of the ingredients and cook until hot.  Obviously, leave out the crackers.

This is the most wonderful side dish ever.  I make it all the time for my family.  It makes a large amount so there is plenty of leftovers.  As soon as the leftovers are gone, my kids are begging for more.  Way to go!!!

Made this last night and it was great! I did change a few things in the recipe like used sharp cheddar instead of what was called for in the recipe.  I also used less butter and milk.  A wonderful recipe that I'm sure I will be making again but next time will halve it, it was just too much for 3 (though I am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today).

Better without the crackers and with more vegs.
