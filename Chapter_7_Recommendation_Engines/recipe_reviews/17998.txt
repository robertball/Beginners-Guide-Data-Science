Beautiful. Nothing at all to criticize on this one! Given that the batter looked a little questionable almost curdled rather than velvety smooth I had my doubts. I cut into the cupcakes I made from this batter with trepidation! But no worries this cake is GOOD! Light fluffy and soft VERY moist and kind of a milk-chocolate color it was a nice change from heavier denser darker chocolate cakes. Didn't change a thing and wouldn't in the future either. I frosted it with "Peanut Butter Frosting " also from this site and it was a beautiful combination both in color and in taste.

I followed the recipe exact. I have to admit that I was quite worried that the cake was not going to be good because the batter looked........off. It was extremely thin the color was odd and it just seemed as if I'd missed a step as I'd made the cake batter. As I pulled it out of the oven it looked perfect! I frosted this cake with my own recipe for Chocolate Buttermilk Buttercream. I did not try this cake myself but my husband and kids raved about it all night last night. Just goes to show you you never know how a recipe will turn out!

This is originally from many of the Hershey's cookbooks where it's known as "Hershey's Chocolate Town Special Cake." When you think of the chocolate cake from your childhood that your Grandma made this is it. It's been my go-to chocolate cake recipe for many years and never once did it fail to turn out and garner many compliments as well as moans of near-ecstasy. From experience I can tell you that both the taste and texture is slightly better when you use the actual buttermilk as opposed to using fresh milk with added lemon juice or vinegar to sour it. But if that's all you have rest assured it will still turn out very well - just a matter of tiny degrees certainly not a deal breaker. It has a perfect chocolate flavor and a moist fine velvety crumb. It stays moist for days if kept covered (but it probably won't last long enough for you to put that to the test!) Frosted either with chocolate or vanilla buttercream (or even a whipped ganache ) this is a sure-fire winner that delivers dependably outstanding results.

Yes I was in such a rush to make this cake I broke the first rule of cooking: read all directions before starting to make the recipe. To my delight even though I messed up this cake came out wonderfully. So if you sift the cocoa in with yout flour mixture and you simply mix the shortening hot water sugar and vanilla - it won't look promising but it will turn out. I can't wait to make this recipe the right way ext time.

ummm sorry to say that this cake disappointed me. i've made plenty of chocolate cakes (many of them from this site) and this isn't a recipe that i'm going to keep. it lacks in chocolate flavor and if i hadn't topped it with chocolate ganche my family wouldn't have eaten it.

This is very similar to Hershey's Chocolatown Special Cake however the flour soda and salt measurements in this recipe are not the same. Hershey's calls for 2 1/4 cups of flour 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. salt. Made according to Hershey's recipe and use real butter for the shortening and buttermilk not sour milk and it is fabulous. I use the buttercream icing and store the cake in the refrigerator. It is rich chocolaty and delicious. I just bake in a 9x13 pan and it turns out fine.

My biggest issue with the cake is that it felt too heavy. I think next time I'll include less butter and fatty foods. Otherwise the cake was nice and spongy It needed a sleek icing to top it off but it tasted pretty good.
