These were a hit at the party! If yo uuse regular size mushrooms you'll need more than 48 to fit all of the stuffing in. I used regular pork sausage and added seasonings to it. Also I didn't use parmesan but pizza cheese instead. Delicious!

Used Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage and sprinkled a little soy sauce on them right before they were done.  These were SO good and held together beautifully!  Thank you for sharing.

WOW! these were gone before the party even got started good.  Been passing the recipe on to friends.  I even thought the cream cheese topping was good enough as a dip!

I liked this recipe and so did the hubby but we both agree it is a 4, not sure why. I was so happy to try this recipe because I don't eat seafood and everyone always stuffs mushrooms with crab or some other seafood. I will repeat this again not sure what if any thing I will tweak, I liked the cream cheese and He liked the meat so if I leave it as is we will both be pleased.

We really liked these mushrooms. Flavor was refreshing and tasty. I can see changing up the seasonings for different parties.I felt elegant just making these bite size beauties.

One word "YUMMY" I cooked my sausage with an onion. Followed the rest of the recipe as called for, although my mushrooms were big so it only made 12. I served as an appetizer, everyone loved them.

Very good! I actually used breakfast style hot italiam sausage. And I had to cook them for about 20 minutes instead of 8-10 minutes. I cant wait to make these again!

These were very good!  A couple tips!

*Make sure the mushrooms you choose are actually LARGE.
*Drain/Strain/Even BLOT your sausage to remove excess liquids.  
*Pipe the cream cheese on with a frosting bag and top it with a parsley leaf for extra POP! 

Thank you Johnsonville for a great recipe.

Absolutely amazing! I love these. I added the remaining ingredients to the sausage after it was cooked (and cooled 5 minutes)I only wish my mushrooms were bigger to get more stuffing in!

These mushrooms were really good however, I really enjoyed the other Johnsonville stuffed mushroom recipe more. Both are by far the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had.

I make this on a regular basis as an entrée, in a deconstructed version.  I pan sauté the mushrooms and sausage in a pan and serve over mashed potatoes. Always great!

I just whipped everything together by hand to save me having to get out the food processor, and it worked great!  I used ground Italian sausage to save on time. I also used mozzarella cheese on top, instead of the parmesan, and they tasted great.  I agree with another reviewer that a dab of pizza sauce would be great with these. I love stuffed mushrooms and these were awesome!

Couldn't be more simple and easy to customize. We're vegan so when not preparing for meat eaters to test out - easy to substitute vegan cheeses and vegan sausage products too!

These are really tasty little mushrooms. Easy to put together and my son loved the Italian sausage. I used baby bella mushrooms. Yum. I will definitely be making these again.

We were taken back by the overwhelming tang in these mushrooms.  These will not be a repeater at the LTH house.

I made these to top a luncheon salad, so I scaled back the recipe.  Now I wish I hadn’t, because these were addicting.  Absolutely delicious – and so fast and easy to make too.

These were DELICIOUS! I was leary of adding the lemon juice, but I'm sooo glad I did...it offered a great tang, that really went w/ the other flavors well. I did scale the recipe down, but that was my only change, other than not being able to find 'big' mushrooms. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added some of the stems(about half of them), finely chopped, in with the stuffing.  It helped add a little flavor and moisture.  They were a real hit!
