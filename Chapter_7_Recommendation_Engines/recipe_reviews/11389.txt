We've been enjoying this recipe for 30+ years -- we begged my mom to make them when we were kids, and now my son and niece beg for them! The recipe used to be on the chips bag, but I haven't seen it there in years.  It IS rich, but it is also soooo good!  

The only change I'd make, just to make the prep easier:  Instead of a double boiler, just combine the chocolate chips, confectioner's sugar, butter (cut into bits) and water in a medium size glass bowl.  (I use a 4-cup glass pyrex measuring cup.)  Stir to combine, then microwave on high for 1 min.  Stir again, and microwave an additional minute.  Stir til chips melt and mixture is smooth, then spread immediately.  Like other fudge, if you stir too long, it will get too thick to easily spread.  

Also, refrigerating the krispies while you prepare the fudge layer makes it much easier to spread the fudge over them.  We keep ours in the fridge after they're made and take squares out as we want them.  They hold together better and the taste is much better chilled than room temp.

This recipe brought words to my husband's mouth that I never thought I would hear, "They are too sweet."  These are very rich and very sweet and you will have to cut them into very small bars.  Don't get me wrong, they are good, but will give you a sugar rush from the Gods if you eat too many.  I also hated that I dirtied so many dishes just to make rice crispy treats.  I probably won't make again.

This is my all time favorite "christmas cookie". Because they are so rich we only make them once a year. This has been a family tradition with my mother and I for 26 yrs and now my daughter and I have taken it over.

These are awesome but who is Lori and why is she naming them? They were on the bag of Nestle's Butterscotch morsels for years starting in the 70's under the name "Crunchy Fudge Sandwiches".

These are fantastic! Loved the texture of the crunchy outside with the smoothy fudgy middle. I used natural PB and I think that prevented them from being overly sweet like some other reviewers found.

I have also made this recipe for years.  I have modified it somewhat to make a "frosted" bar.

Follow the ingredients and procedure as in the original recipe, except:

1.  Put all of the cereal mixture in the prepared pan and chill well.  

2.  "Frost" the cereal mixture with the fudge.  Chill cut and eat.

Can't keep my kids and the neighbor kids out of this one!

I thought the chocolate was a little difficult to spread and the sandwich effect would be ruined.  I was wrong.  Doesn't have to be perfect because they looked great when I cut into them.

Thanks.  I'll be making these again and again!

This recipe is delicious but very rich!  My 11 year old daughter loves it, my 14 year old son is not so keen on it.  This is perhaps more something that the under-12 age group would go for?  A bit too rich for me too.

I also found it too sweet and made the following modifications: Leave out all the powdered sugar and use bittersweet chocolate. I also use crunchy peanut butter as the original recipe called for.

I have loved these ever since my grandma made them for me for the first time! Just made them again tonight and they are always a family favorite, we love having them after theyâ€™ve been in the fridge for a good while! Ive never had the problem with them being too sweet, but I make a half recipe with one 3/4th cup of the chips and half a cup of powdered sugar.
