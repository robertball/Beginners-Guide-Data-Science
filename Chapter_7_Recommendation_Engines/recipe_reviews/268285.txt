YUM! These are wonderful cookies. I didn't change anything and they baked perfectly in about 12 minutes for me.  I've eaten 4 already and the dough isn't all baked yet! I'm estimating I'll have somewhere between 3 and 4 dozen cookies, just about what the recipe said. This one is a real winner. Try it, you won't regret it!

My family LOVES these cookies. I did make one change to the recipe. I replaced 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of quick oats. This keeps them from spreading and they cook up perfect in about 9 minutes.  Family and friends love them as well!

I measured all my ingredients and found that the dough had too much flour. The cookies were rather dry and didn't spread enough. I like mine more like chocolate chip cookies which uses 2 1/4 cups of flour ( I also add 1/4 c. of oatmeal).
I added an extra T. of coffee.
The dough didn't taste much like coffee and the cardamom taste was almost non existent.

FYI: I love the taste of cardamom and use it in coffee bread and a buttermilk cake.

10 Minutes was too short and 15 minutes was too long to bake. I settled on 3 minutes.

Would I make them again. No.

I think next time I make these I might increase the cardamom.

Made exactly as recipe said. Made nearly 5 dozen 2‚Äù diameter cookies. Cardamom flavor is great but I agree the coffee is seriously lacking. Next time will definitely up to 3 tbsp or even 4.

I made no changes, I made it just like the institutions said. 
These cookies aren't good. And it's not just me that tried them.. I had at least 6 people try them and nobody liked them.

I was thinking these had too much flour compared to a lot of cookies I make with the same amount of other ingredients. I still followed the recipe exactly. They are chewy and delicious!

Made exactly as written. Yummy! Next time I will cut the butter by 1/3 and add more espresso powder. I couldn't taste it at all.
