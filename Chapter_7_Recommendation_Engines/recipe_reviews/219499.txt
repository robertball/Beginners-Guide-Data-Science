This was good, but when we added the flavor boost, it wasn't enough to become bubbly.  Are you supposed to add any water to the flavor boost (like the box of flavor boost indicates?)  If yes, do you recommend adding one or two cups of water?  The box directions indicate one cup of water per packet of flavor boost.

Very easy to make and everyone loved it.  We did add shredded cheese and left out the onions. We will be having this for dinner more often!!!!
