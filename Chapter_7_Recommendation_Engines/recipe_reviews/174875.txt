This was a great way to use up some of my remaining white flour/white sugar and Nestle chips I had in my freezer plus make a quick treat for my husband. I followed the recipe exact, only using Trader Joe's organic chunky peanut butter. These came out perfect and were done at 25 minutes. NOTE: Huge hit with my husband and my older boy along with my husband's best work friend. Thumbs up!
