I made this recipe without shichimi togarashi and used salmon. I loved the idea of coating salmon (pork) in sesame seeds. The sauce is great here. Because miso paste is salty enough, I used just 1 tbs soy sauce. 1/2 cup butter was enough for me too. And I don`t care for ginger so much, so used just a little. The sauce goes great on anything, even as a salad dressing (I had leftovers and used it this way).

This recipe was exactly what I was hoping for. I did however use salmon instead of pork. I also added some straw mushrooms to the miso butter and served it with a side of Japanese rice. Very tasty!!

Followed the recipe to a T.  Didn't add any more salt to the sauce.  I also used sake for my dry white wine.  My husband and I loved it but I had to cut away the edges for my 4 yr old daughter.  It was a bit spicy for her.  Will def. try again with salmon.

EXCELLENT! Followed recipe exactly, except only use half the butter in the sauce. Had a 1.3 pound tenderloin and cooked for 20 minutes. Nice and pink at 140 degrees. And thanks to Amazon for the togarashi since I live in a small town with no Asian grocery.

Sorry, I wanted to like this, but...terrible balance in the flavors.  The meat is just spicy, but not balanced with depth.  The sauce was awful.  Too acidic with the lime juice AND white wine.  And too salty with both miso and soya.  All I could taste was "bright" and "acid" and "salty" with no warmth, even after adding the butter.  I notice that most other positive reviews used salmon...maybe that oil would help to counter the brightness of the sauce, but not for pork.  I was embarrassed to serve this to my wife.  I was looking forward to cooking this all week, but had to file this one under "not again."  Maybe with some tweaks, like using a miso paste with the sirchimi and sesame instead of in the sauce, and using only one acidic ingredient (wine), it might be good.  

I made this as written, except added only a little soya into the sauce.

It was awesome ! Had big challenges finding the shichimi togarashi in our area (found it at Olives & Spices at March√© Jean-Talon, Montreal); however it made it all worth the while !
