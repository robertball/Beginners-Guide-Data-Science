Yummy.  I used fully cooked sausage for faster preparation and I finely chopped the sweet potatoes instead of shredding.  It was great and I will definitely prepare it this way again next time.

Quite tasty. I liked the use of sweet potatoes in this. For me, this needs a couple of tweaks for next time:  I like spicy with my sweet potatoes, so next time I'll add a couple shakes of spicy salt to the potatoes. The dish is very fluffy.. I tend to prefer a less fluffy more dense breakfast dish. Next time I'll add some more veggies or perhaps a bit of flour to thicken it up a bit

Good recipe.  I was more interested in the method and combination of ingredients.  I had one very long slim sweet potato which I grated into the bottom of a 6 x 10 glass dish (approx. size)  I used 6 eggs, handful of grated cheese, cup of spinach chopped, half of an onion diced fine, quarter cup of Bisquick, pepper, salt, 1/2 cup water...........my point is that this method and combination of vegetables is dependable.  Follow the "how to" instructions and use the combination amounts that you like best.  Don't fret, it's like making quiche. It was a lovely brown when it came out of the oven.  I strongly suspect that it will re-heat in the microwave and still be nice.  My 17 year old son put ketchup on it, but that is not a bad thing.  Thanks to the Cook for making a recipe that I can fit into my busy life. Add a tossed salad and this is lovely breakfast, lunch or super.

Made this exactly as written. Topped it with Franks Hot Sauce. Loved it! Perfect mix of sweet and savory.

I fixed this on a Sunday hoping to have something to take to work for breakfast all week.  I'll be surprised if it last until I get home today (Monday).  My husband loved it.  I added a little more spinach, used veggie burger instead of sausage and 8 egg whites plus 2 whole eggs.  As suggested my another reviewer, I added a little hot sauce.  It was awesome!!! Will double the recipe and try again next Sunday.

I made this for a group of mostly meat-eaters and they loved it! I omitted the vegetarian sausage links, used kale instead of spinach and used 10 large eggs rather than 8 jumbo eggs. Great recipes. Thanks!

Looking for a recipe to take to a brunch next weekend.  Tried this today and I found a winner.  Added cayenne pepper to the egg mixture .  I made my own turkey sausage, so I skipped the water step with the vegan sausage.  Will add more spinach next time to amp up the vege count.  The shredded sweet potatoes (raw) came out cooked perfectly with just th right amount of crispness.  My family thought I had grated up pie crust.

I found this recipe because I wanted to use up previously frozen shredded sweet potatoes, now it will become a regular entrée at dinner. I served this with rice and steamed veggies to make it a dinner meal. I wondered about adding the savory eggs/cheese/onion with the sweet potato and it was really good.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! If I could give this 10 stars I would. The mild sweetness of the potatoes were a perfect compliment to the sausage flavor, cheese flavors and the onion. 
I made it exactly as written with the exception of using 8 oz of regular breakfast sausage instead of vegetarian. Every bite was a fresh flavor burst. It needed no seasoning at all. I loosely put the shredded (2 average sized) sweet potatoes in the pan and did NOT beat the eggs. This enabled them to be more of a binding agent and to flow a little into the potatoes.  The casserole was dense and delightfully flavorful. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Cant wait to serve it to guests but today I'm glad it was just my hubby and I - that we there's leftovers for this week. ;-)

I made this for 15 people for Thanksgiving morning- it was a hit! Delicious flavor. We used full fat cheeses, hot pork sausage, no water, and frozen (unthawed) kale from our garden. What I would do differently is: first sautee the onions with butter and garlic, bake the potatoes rather than shredding them, and spoon the baked potato with butter into the bottoms of the pans. This way the casserole bake time is only 30 minutes (for hungry morning people). Yum!

I love this recipe!  I started a Paleo diet and this fits in perfectly.  I replaced the vegetable sausage with turkey sausage, and it is perfect!  I also cut the recipe in half and baked in a smaller dish and reduced the bake time to 45 minutes.  The size was better for my family of 4.  I love that I can make it the night before and then stick it in the oven in the morning.

I thought this was a great recipe overall!  I used 2 cups of spinach and half a roll of the fake ground sausage instead of the links (and next time I'll probably use the entire roll).

The sweet potatoes give this casserole just a touch of yummy sweetness (with Vitamin A as a nice bonus!).

I served this recipe at my annual Christmas brunch and it was a hit.  My daughter is a vegetarian so of course she loved it.
I used the veggie sausage patties and it turned out perfect.

I've made this dish half a dozen times and even my carnivore eating friends love it. They don't care that it's made with vegetarian sausage. I really lighten up on the cheese - too much cheese takes away from the rest of the flavors in the casserole.  It is a bit of a pain to shred the potatoes but if you can get thru that, the rest is easy!  And worth it.

This was an excellent dish.   I used sweet sausage which I browned without water.  I also used 9 extra large eggs as that was all I had.   Finally, I was lazy and did not feel like chopping up the spinach, so I just threw in the baby spinach leaves and tore in half a few of the really large ones.  The only thing to be careful of was the baking time, mine was overdone and slightly burnt in the corners when I checked it at 50 minutes, so next time I will check in 40 minutes.  This was probably my fault as I baked it in a glass baking dish and did not adjust the temperature.  I will definitely make it again!

I used actual sweet potatoes instead of yams, and baked/smashed them (suggested by another poster) for the base. Also added some sautéed mushrooms and peppers. This is soooo delicious!

Delicious! I've made with turkey sausage and with lean pork sausage and both were great. I took it for a work potluck and had requests next time to make it again.

WOW!  This was great.  I didn't tell my son it had sweet potatoes in it and he loved it.  Everyone loved it and wants me to make it again. A great healthy meal for breakfast.  I used regular sausage instead of vegetarian but will try vegetarian another time.

This was a delicious idea! I did make some tweaks though... Instead of the vegan sausage I used turkey breakfast sausage and instead of cottage cheese I used 1/2 a block of cream cheese because I already had it in my refrigerator. Thank you for this post!

I really liked this dish a lot. The sweetness of the sweet potatoes gave it a unique flavor. The next time I make it I will add more spinach. I also think I will omit the cottage cheese and add milk instead. I did use already cooked turkey sausage crumbles. And I will add Roma tomatoes on top.

WOW just wow! This was amazing I was so surprised! I ended up using a few large handfuls of finely chopped broccoli instead of spinach and a couple more veggie sausage links. Added salt and pepper to the filling as well. Topped with some hot sauce and I was in heaven! I burnt my mouth on my first piece because I was trying to eat it so fast! You really can't go wrong with this recipe, its wonderful!!

Easy and tasted not too bad, but it's hard to mess up a dish filled with cheese.  Found it too heavy for me, but definitely a good way to mix the sweet potatos and the spinaches in the same dish.

This was a big hit at the brunch I took it to! It's a nice vegetarian option for breakfast, but even the meat eaters loved it.  Use a food processor of some sort to chop the sweet potatoes finely and to save your knuckles and a lot of time.  I made it according to the recipe; it was true to the cooking time suggested in the recipe.

Family like the recipe. Had to use real sausage though. I think next time I'll season the sweet potatoes a little bit more than with just butter.

Yummy. But you suggested serving it as a dish for vegetarians, and vegetarians don't eat eggs.

OMG! this is the breakfast casserole I've wanted for years. It's amazing! Thank you so much for sharing it. I did make teeny tweaks- I used turkey sausage instead of veggie, and I added a little minced garlic. It's scrumptious, and includes some of the best veg I want to have often: spinach and sweet potato. It is PERFECT. Thank you so much.

Delicious. Have made it three weeks in a row. 

I double the spinach and mix it up with feta cheese.

Tasted better as day after leftovers, heated up in the microwave.  Sweet potatoes blended more with other ingredients.  Delicious!

Delicious!!! The reviews on how it was "sweet and savory" sold me on it, and they were not wrong! This will become a morning staple, especially when family is around. It's simple to make and good for you. And the hubby liked it. Sold!

This was a wonderful brunch casserole, which I made for Christmas. There were no leftovers. The  veggie sausage really added a lot to the flavor . I used a little more than half of the listed amount of the ricotta just to reduce the dairy load. It tasted great!

I used browned hot Italian sausage, all mozzarella cheese, and plain yogurt in place of the cottage cheese. Really yummy and as others said, a nice blend of savory and sweet.

This is a very yummy casserole. I omitted the cottage cheese because I wanted to cut down on the amount of lactose and it's still nice and cheesy. Next time I will up the eggs to 12.

Great recipe, though a touch bland without modifications.  I upped the spinach to closer to 1.5 cups and added a handful of fresh parsley.  I also added salt, pepper, and 1/2 tsp of paprika.

Really yummy and great fluffy texture. I doubled the onion and spinach, and added 1 chopped red bell pepper. The red bp combined with the sweet potato for a lot of subtle natural sweetness; next time I'll try adding 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 tsp salt. May also try non-fat instead of low-fat cottage cheese.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I did use a full pound of pork sausage, and I added about 1/2 cup of milk to the egg, cheese, and sausage mixture, because it looked too dry.  Looking forward to having leftovers for breakfast!

it was a LOT of sweet potatoes!  I might make it again with less sweet potatoes, more sausage and serve with some sour cream to dollop on top. It held together beautifully and my vegetarian friends appreciated the effort because there were NO leftovers!

very simple and easy to make! I cut the receipt in half because we only have 2 people. I used 5 large eggs and half cup of water  ,and I baked it in a smaller pan and for 30 mins. it turned out good. very moist.

Very tasty as written.  Next time I will put the sweet potatoes on the bottom and then cook for a bit to hopefully crisp up the bottom, then add ingredients and cook through...yum!

Was looking for a recipe to use up some sweet potatoes that were given to me. This had a great taste and my kids devoured it. I used a maple flavor sausage and it complimented it perfectly.

I came across this recipe because I had all of the ingredients on hand and wanted to use new crop sweet potatoes. I was happy to see a vegetarian recipe. I made it exactly like the recipe said and was very pleased with the results. I did serve it for breakfast and everyone had very positive results. I was curious about no spices being in the recipe, and didn't add any. After baking, I tasted it and no spices were needed. Perhaps if you wanted to serve this as a brunch or dinner casserole, you may want to spice it up a bit. The sausage gives enough flavor for breakfast. Not too heavy. Serves 12 generously. This is a very good recipe. Thanks Zafah!

Very yummy will be added to make ahead dishes list for the week.  I doubled the spinach and will use Fat Free Greek Yogurt next time to make this even healthier.  Was sceptical since I hate cottage cheese, but YUMMY.  Wanted seconds, but watching the calories so had to abstain.

This was a pretty easy and savoy breakfast casserole to make.  I added bacon to it as well and didn’t use the potatoes since I’m on a keto diet.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used this recipe as a guide for a carb-conscious non-vegetarian option--In other words I used Jimmy Dean sausage in my casserole.  The sweet potato base was a delicious option to the typical bread base.   My guests (and I) enjoyed this very different variation to the typical breakfast casserole.

Made Christmas 2017. Everyone liked, even the meat eaters.  We used vegetable crumbles because they were out of the vegetarian sausage.  It's a keeper and will make with whatever veg crumbles they have.

My husband and I LOVE this. It is our go to for special occasion breakfasts. Between the two of us, we've probably made it at least a half dozen times. 
We use the cheap frozen (meat) breakfast sausage and chopped it rather  than the vegetarian crumbles.

So yummy.  I used chicken sausage instead of vegetarian.  Spiralized the sweet potato and chopped them a bit since I didn't want to shred them.  Will definitely make this again!

This did not work for me. The potatoes remained soggy and the spinach got crunchy.

I rated it high because I am hoping we love it.   I do have a question has anyone tried to make it the day before? I love lazy Saturday mornings and I want to have it oven ready when I get up.

I did not care for this recipe. Very bland. Sweet potatoes laborious to shred.
