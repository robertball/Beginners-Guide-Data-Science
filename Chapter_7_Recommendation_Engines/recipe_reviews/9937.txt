A few handy tips and these cookies aren't hard to handle at all, and the final product is beautiful and delicious! First, spreading out the dough that much with your fingers is just about impossible to do evenly. Add a large piece of parchment or wax paper on top of the dough (of course there is a sheet below the dough also) and then use a rolling pin to spread the dough out. Peel back the top piece of parchment paper and you have a nice, smooth surface to spread out your chocolate. After the chocolate is spread, use the bottom piece of parchment to help you roll up the dough, by picking up the edge near you and holding it up while you roll over the dough with your hand. Continue til the whole roll is done- don't try to pick it up until it's all the way rolled. I put it in the freezer for 30 minutes. The dough wasn't too hard, and made it very easy to slice. I had to increase the bake time a couple of minutes for the first batch since the dough was so cold going in. The cookies will fall apart if you don't let them cool at least 5 minutes on the sheet before taking them off. Beautiful, soft cookies, with a good balance of peanut butter and chocolate. Will make again for sure!

I do believe I need to practice at making pinwheel cookies!  I tried these last week and was tired and in a hurry so I did as one reviewer suggested and used whole chocolate chips.  I wouldn't recommend that--they just fell apart completely so I just sort of smooshed them all together and make regular cookies.  I tried again today, and my pinwheels were log shaped--only a few looked pretty.  So I think I need some practice at this!  I melted the chocolate in the microwave (just melt for a min, stir, and continue until it is all melted) and spread it out over the cookies.  They are very good--nice mix of chocolate and peanut butter.  Thanks!

This cookie is awesome. I sent some to my sons friends at college and that night they wanted more.  Here is a tip. If you cut the roll in half and put it in a glass and lay it on its side it retains the round shape. After 25 minutes it should be good to slice.

I used creamy peanutbutter for smoother
more refined cookie.  They were served at a party rated the best cookie of the party.

I was in the mood for peanut butter and chocolate cookies and happened upon this recipe. I got to admit they are a bit of work! But the end result is delicious and does deserve five stars on it's own. The reason I give this recipe four stars though is because the cookies did not puff up as I expected, it seemed to when it came out the oven but it quickly fell into this thin and semi-crisp type of cookie. Still enjoyable though. I may give this one another try, really does taste great.

This was a great recipe!! I changed a couple of things... I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar (this keeps the cookies a little softer) and 2/3 cup peanut butter - we like ours a little extra peanut buttery! I also used an overflowing cup of chocolate chips. They turned out great!

I divided the dough in half to roll it.  This will make the dough easier to work with and will make a neater pinwheel.  I used milk chocolate in the one half and strawberry jam on the other and enjoyed them equally.  However, if you use jam, I would recommend that you spray your cookie sheet with Pam spray first because the jam may leak out and stick.

Flavor - out of this world good!!!  Getting these to look good as a final product - not so easy.  After making the dough, it was very moist, and going against my better judgement, I stuck with the recipe and did not add any extra flour.  I spread with the melted chocolate and did my best to roll this.  Following the advice of a previous reviewer, I used the parchment paper to roll this.  It was very difficult to roll with the dough being so moist.  I did finally manage to roll it and refrigerated it for about 3 hours before baking.  It did cut and bake nicely, but the cookies still don't look like I was expecting or hoping for.  But, they taste so good, no one here really cares what they look like.  I will try again, and adjust the dough.  Also thinking of just making peanut butter cookes and swirling in some melted chocolate before rolling into cookies.

This cookie recipe is a 100 years old. My mom used to make them when we were little and they are a family favorite. It takes some practice getting the rolling down, but once you have it these cookies are well worth it. Especially for peanut butter and chocolate lovers.

As far as taste goes I'd give this recipe a 5, but for looks and ease of preparation I'd only give it a 2. I had my doubts about spreading melted chocolate over soft dough, so I chilled the dough some before I spread the slightly cooled chocolate over top. Once spread, the cookie was very hard and messy to roll, but I stil had hopes for a good cookie. It all fell apart though (literally) once I took it out of the fridge and started cutting it. The cookies fell apart and were not attractive at all once baked. I think it'd be easier to just put the whole chips into the dough and not worry about melting and spreading...the results would be quite similar with far less time and effort expended.

These cookies are delicious. I used creamy peanut butter because I did not have crunchy peanut butter. Great recipe!

Not enough PB taste for me.  I was able to roll out dough fine on my baking mat (covered it w/ parchment paper and used rolling pin) and was able to carefully spread chocolate fine too.  But the dough was too soft to roll up well.  If I made again, I would add more flour and refrigerate PB dough first (although in fairness I live in high humidity and often have to add flour).  Not enough taste for the amount of work in my opinion.

These tasted great, but I had a hard time rolling the log.  It may have been to hot here (over 100 degrees).  I may have also not made the layers thin enough.  They were more like peanut butter chocolate chunk, but they were delicious!

I probably made the cookie layer too thin so I had a lot more swirls, but they were still delicious, even with reduced fat PB! I tasted them the next day and they were JUST what I was looking for. They taste like these peanut butter cookies that I've only had at work before and can't resist every time...now I can make them on my own! I don't even think that they need the chocolate swirl, throw in some chocolate chips and I think they would be great.

Recipe turned out great. I just wouldn't have made 4 small rolls, but rather keep it at 2. Husband loved the cookies, who is the person I made them for.

I used this recipe to make peppermint pinwheels. I omitted the chocolate and used about 10 drops red food coloring and 2 drops peppermint essential oil.  I rolled out the dough between 2 sheets of wax paper than chilled in the freezer for 10 minutes, then layered and rolled up the two doughs. Once rolled, I rolled it like a play dough snake to make it a little longer. I wrapped the log in the wax paper and chilled in the fridge for about 2 hours then sliced to between 1/8 and 1/4 thick and baked on parchment for 9 minutes. yield 54 approx 1 to 1.5 inch cookies

These were pretty easy to make, although my "pinwheel" was a little messy looking.  They turned out a little too crispy for my taste so I might cut them thicker next time.  Even so, they were very tasty and my boyfriend finished them off!
