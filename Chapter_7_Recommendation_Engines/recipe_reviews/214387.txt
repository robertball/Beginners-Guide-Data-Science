I am the submitter of this recipe and I would like to clarify a few things about it. Do not drain the excess liquid in the lentils!!!  It is supposed to be like a soup.  Also, make sure your tomatillo is ripe or it will be sour!  If you follow these directions the recipe should turn out how its supposed to.

Not a fan of Lentil soup so I wanted to find something else to do with my lentils, this is it! Awesome and delicious.
I made several substitutions, based on what was in the kitchen. I used a can of Rotel Mexican Lime & Cilantro tomatoes rather than the roma and tomatillo. Chicken stock rather than bouillon. I also used shallots rather than white onion, because it is what I had. Still came out GREAT!! 
Next time I will plan better and follow the recipe, but this goes to show that you have a LOT of leeway with this recipe.

This is an unusual and interesting dish.  I used almost every part of the recipe exactly except Cotija (it's difficult to find in some places), substituting it for Pepper Jack.  I also added another cup of water during the final cookdown process (I found the initial mix didn't have enough liquid for a stew consistency).

A few final thoughts: the tomatillos provide a sour note that may not sit well for some alongside the starchy lentils.  If that's the case, use half a tomatillo.  Also, on second trials of this recipe I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles instead of a roma.  This is a quick substitute.  Finally, I'd be interested to see if anyone is brave enough to substitute black beans for lentils.

Another recipe that I changed a lot, but the concept is good, so I'll give it 3 stars. Chorizo and lentils really work well together, so this is how I did it. First off, I didn't use bacon. The oil from the chorizo seemed like enough and I was right. I also think bacon would have just tasted strange in this recipe. I couldn't find tomatillo (unfortunately, because I think that would have been a nice addition), so I just used a can of crushed tomatoes. I omitted the water because crushed tomatoes are liquidy enough. Blended everything as suggested, cooked lentils as suggested, and then mixed it all together. Next time I will use more chorizo, since all you really got was the flavor of chorizo, not the texture.

I LOVED this recipe!!!  I made it with rotel instead of the roma tomato and I thought I had cumin but didn't.  It still came out amazing! The cotija cheese set it off perfectly.  I omitted the sour cream for lower calorie purposes and the flavor was still the ONE!  My friend said to add a jalapeno or serrano pepper to the lentils while they're simmering for a bit more spice.  Depends on your heat tolerance.  No matter what I will make this again and again! Thanks!!

I couldn't believe how delicious this soup was.  I used all of the ingredients listed in the recipe (except for the cilantro, which my husband does not like), but my preparation method was a little different.  I cooked the vegetables with the chorizo and skipped pureeing them in the blender.  I also microwaved the bacon in layers of paper towels for five minutes, and then I combined everything into the lentil pot.   It tastes even better after sitting in the fridge over night.  I will definitely be adding this to my regular mean rotation.

This was very delicious and probably the best lentil dish I have had!  Thank you for sharing. I did a couple changes. I could not find the cheese so I opted for freshly shredded pepper jack. I also subbed the tomatillo for small can of green chillis. I didnt want to serve as a soup so I made rice and served it  with white rice, the lentil mixture and poured some of the juice before garnishing with cheese and sour cream. It was amazing!

Pretty tasty! I used french lentils, 9 oz. tube of pork chorizo and extra thick hickory bacon. There was so much bacon grease in the pan that I ended up draining most of it out and left 1-2 tablespoons for sauteing the  veggies.  Tastes much better the second day when all the flavors have time to meld. Thanks for the recipe!

From the first time I made this recipe, it became a huge hit in my home. At home, we prefer it with "Soy Chorizo", from Trader Joe's, over regular chorizo. Their seasoning really puts this dish over the top. Enjoy!

I drained the lentils and reduced the liquid. I had a little too much bacon grease, so I drained all but about two tablespoons .  I served it with a runny fried egg on top for breakfast. Delicious!!
More stewlike than probably intended, but worked great as a breakfast dish. 
Next time I'll try it according to the recipe. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Delicious. Used a small tomato from my garden and added a little extra cumin. Definitely will make it again.

Came out delicious!! I sautéed red chili peppers, garlic, green onion, jalapenos, and our organic soyriso . Secret ingredient: garlic cilantro balsamic vinegar. When finished, poured into the soup and let it simmer on low for about half hour - it was amazing!!!

I have made this soup several times and will be making it again to take to a "food day" at work.  It is amazing and it has not failed to be a crowd pleaser.  It is difficult to get the cheese required here, so google said a good substitute is goat feta!  That's what I used and I loved it.  Love Goat Cheese and love Feta, so no problem with the substitution.

As written, it was pretty plain but I think it's going to improve as it sits. I meant to boil the lentils in broth instead of water and I forgot, that should help. I also wish there had been better measurements for the liquid - I think I put too much in which didn't help with the lack of flavor.

Excellent recipe, thanks!  I made a couple of very minor changes.  Cooked the lentils in homemade chicken broth, and added some carrots and mushrooms to the veggie mixture.  We used this to make burritos and tacos.

This is a great gluten-free, fiber-filled dish, as long as you don't use the chicken boullion! I also didn't use the bacon (forgot to thaw it) so I did need to add a bit of salt. Also threw in a jalapeño because I had it, and used queso fresco with crema supremo on top. Delish!

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't used to be a lentil fan, but really enjoyed this.  The only changes I made was to use low sodium chicken broth instead of bullion and water. I also increased the cumin to half a teaspoon and added 1/4 teaspoon coriander.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe and it turned out to be delicious! I used veggie bullion instead of chicken, veggie chorizo, left out the bacon completely (with a little extra olive oil to add some fat), and wasn't able to find a tomatillo, so I had to make due with fresh tomatillo salsa.  Nevertheless, even my carnivorous boyfriend ate it up! Thanks!

Even my picky husband took seconds of this dish. He doesn't like soup, so I made it much much thicker. I drained the lentils, but not before I used a little of that juice to purée the veggies. since I made it so thick, it would have been good on top of something else fresh tasting, but I don't know what. It was a great earthy taste followed by a bit of spice from the chorizo I used.

I really needed more specific instructions about the amount of water to cook with the lentils. Large pot to me, meant my dutch oven, which meant I probably had 3-4 cups too much water. I ended up with a pot of colored water, no taste.
I tried to cook the water down and my lentils disolved.
I ended up cooking more lentils to add to the pot, adding mixed vegies, a can of diced tomatoes, chicken soup base and some corn startch to thicken it.
this all could have been prevented with better directions in the first paragragh.

Easy to make vegetarian, or to customize. My roommates and I loved this recipe. The things I did different: first, I sliced a single jalapeno and let that simmer with the lentils; Next, I used spicy soy chorizo, instead of pork or beef chorizo, because I like the flavor better and it has half the fat; Lastly, I added half a can of green chilies to the veggie mix because I needed to use them up. I let the individuals top their own bowl with cotija and mexican crema.

It was simple, & fast! The only thing I did different was add some fresh diced serrano peppers for a little spice. We didn't puree them. Just added into our own individual bowls. gave it a little crunch as well.  We like our food with a little heat. Delicious.

Delicious, and my husband liked it. A little spicy from chorizo but not bad with the sour cream added.

Amazing!  I used the Rotel Lime and Cilantro tomatoes instead of the Roma and tomatilla as recommended by another cook, and chose not to blend the veggies.  The result was a very tasty stew that we will certainly make again :)

very good, very simple. i didnt have bacon on hand, and i have no idea how much chorizo i used, i just knew it needed to be used up before it expired. this is a recipe that could easily be tweaked in many ways and would still be delicious.
