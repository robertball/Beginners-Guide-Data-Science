Made as written except that I left out the salt. The American cheese is plenty salty enough. I also didn't place the beef in a bowl after it was drained but stuck in right in the slow cooker because I didn't see the need to dirty up another bowl. I loved the idea of pickle juice but you really need to add more than 2 tablespoons if you want to taste it. This is a good dip and one that can easily be tweaked to your individual tastes. I'm confident this one would be a huge hit at any football party.

Turn out Great, served at a party and there was none left. Will be using this recipe for a Bacon contest...However I will use scallions or white onions for more seasoning. I also added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to make it creamier...Yummy

Really loved the way all the flavors work in this.  When I took the lid off the pan my BF was like "Wow that really smells like a cheeseburger"
