I cooked this in six small ramekins which resulted in a really nice presentation.  I think chopped red bell pepper would make it even more eye appealing.  This casserole has very nice texture, not too dry and not too moist.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and I agree with other reviewers that the flavor needs to be kicked up a notch. Something as simple as freshly-chopped onions (I couldn't taste the FF onions) would help tremendously.  Chopped canned chiles or if you want it spicier, chopped jalapeno would be good additions, too.  Sooooooo easy to make, and with a little imagination, this easily could be a 5-star recipe.  A modified version of this side dish will be made again in this house, as I think it has excellent potential.

I needed a good, quick side dish for dinner and I found it in the dish!  I didn't have any parm cheese so I used fresh Mexican cheese. Terrific flavor:) Crunchy outside, creamy inside. I will keep this one handy. Thanks so much!

As other stated, a little bland. I'm thinking chopped green chilies would be good added. I used cheddar French fried onions.

This was MUCH better than other corn casseroles I've made! The only thing I changed was I used an 11 oz can of Niblets instead of whole kernal corn. And make sure you spray the dish with cooking spray. Mine stuck a little, but it was still YUMMY!

This recipe was good but only with modifications. The first time I made this I made as directed and 30 minutes wasn't long enough to fully bake it. It tasted too sweet and mushy too me. I made this again tonight but this time I took out the corn and replaced it with 2 cups of chopped broccoli and also took out the french fried onions. When it was almost done I added 6 tbsp. of french fried onions on top. It came out better than the original recipe but it still wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I would probaly have it again if I'm in a hurry but it's not good enough to add into my regular rotation of recipes. I bet this would taste allot better with more modifications like cheese and such but I'm watching my calories so that's not for me to find out. Overall not a bad recipe.

Used cream of broccoli soup to make it vegetarian and it was good - had a lot more flavor than I was expecting!  Didn't make very good leftovers though so best to eat it same-day.

We really enjoyed this casserole. I used light soup and egg whites instead of whole egg. We also left off the fried onions because we don't care for them. The result was a lighter version with a texture like a spoonbread. Delish!

This was great! We loved it. We'll definitely make this again. I thought about trying this with creamed corn next time just to experiment with the recipe.

This was even better then what I thought it be.  I guess if you like corn and corn bread you'll enjoy this.  My family enjoyed this more then the main dish.  This will now be a weekly dish in our home.

This recipe needs major revisions to be edible.  30 minutes of cooking, plus five minutes to crisp the onions, left me with a baked outer ring and an uncooked middle that was not at all tasty.  I suggest maybe custard cups to cook this in, with the list of ingredients, it should be good, just a problem with the cooking.

I would add some precooked chicken to this recipe.  Also, if you don't have French fried onions, you could saute some chopped onions in butter and add them to the mix instead and possibly use some Italian seasoned bread crumbs on top instead.  I'm going to try it that way since I don't have any French fried onions.

Made this tonight and just got done with my 3rd piece! :) Made just as directed with skim milk. Very easy to make, readily accessible ingredients and delicious. I'm glad I saw this on the AR main page. This will definitely become a comfort food staple in our house.

did not like this at all.  Only thing I did different was, I did not use the fried onions.  And I baked this in a 2 qt round dish, took an 45mins-1 hr to bake.  Maybe if it was put in a 9x13 pan it would only be 30 mins.  Either way, will not make this again.

I made it "as-is" except I left off the french-fried onions because I don't like them. It was STUPENDOUS! I did have to bake it longer than required, but I used a fairly deep dish? Anyway, it looked perfect but wasn't very cooked in the center so I baked it longer. I am choosing to eat a second portion of it instead of having a piece of fudge so it must be REALLY good! Next time I'll try adding chopped bell pepper and more onion. I bet it'd be good with small chopped ham too!

I made this as a main dish in a 9x12, poured over wieners.  The corn bread part was good, but I did have to bake longer than 30 minutes.  I love fried onions so that is what made the dish in my opinion.

Love this recipe I add a teaspoon of sugar in the mix plus sprinkle some on top before placing it in the oven. You can also put cooked meat into the bottom of your dish then pour this mixture on top then bake it to make it more of a meal than a side.

This made a fabulous addition to the Thanksgiving table.  I added a little fresh pepper and a dash of nutmeg. There is never any left in our house. I left out the dry onions and the cheese.
