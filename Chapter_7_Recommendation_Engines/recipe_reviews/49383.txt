These muffins are pretty tasty and guiltless. If you have raspberry or lemon yogurt on hand I strongly suggest you use it! I didn't have any yogurt to use so I replaced it with sour cream and had to add a bit of milk because it was a tad too thick.  I used 1 whole egg in place of the 2 egg whites. I filled my muffin tins half full and topped each one off with a sugar crumb topping that follows:  Mix 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup flour, 2 tsp cinnamon and enough softened butter to form a crumbly mixture... about 5 TBLS.  Bake as directed.  Yummy!!

First, I must say that I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I know that my rating it at 5 stars will frustrate some, but I truly think that the base recipe is great.  I live in a very rural area with limited grocery selections.  (When I get out of town, I hit the super markets like other hit the mall.)  My local grocery did not have lemon yogurt, or rasberries.  They did have blueberry yogurt and frozen blueberries.  I made these 2 substitutions, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The muffins were awesome.  I loved the lemon/blueberry flavor.  I can't wait to try it with rasberries.

I make these muffins all the time!  The first time I made them I followed the recipe but I wanted more flavor so now I use 3 tbsps of lemon juice instead of 1 tbsp and increase the fruit by about a 1/2 cup.  I love them and they taste great the next day too.

Really good- moist, just sweet enough, nice to have a different kind of muffin besides the old stand bys.  Note to reviewers: if you're gonna change practically everything about the recipe, you should not be allowed to review it- submit your own recipe. I am so tired of reading reviews that don't honor the recipe as written.

Oh Wow! Absolutely sensational! I didn't notice that the description said not to use yogurt with fruit on the bottom, but that's exactly what I used. (Raspberry) They came out really great nonetheless. I added extra berries to the batter and topped the muffins with a crumb topping. Thanks for sharing Kathy!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I made these for my parents who are SUPPOSED to eat healthy foods but most of the time don't and they loved them! Not one of us would've guessed these were low in fat. I love pastries for breakfast but don't eat them because of the fat/sugar content. These are a great way to feel like I can still have my morning sweet treat.

This recipe is so great, I can't believe it is low fat! I made mini muffins & they took about 10 to 12 minutes to bake. I definitely recommend this one!

Excellent muffins! I used one whole lemon for both the lemon zest and lemon juice called for in the recipe. I did omit the lemon extract. The batter came together nicely -a little fluffy, and I did not overmix, just enough to combine. I filled 16 muffins tins about 2/3 full. I also took the option and sprinkled raw sugar cane on top of the muffins for decoration. The muffins were baked in 16 minutes flat. I like the light yellow color of muffins with red bits of raspberries peeking out as it is very eye appealing. I could see the sugar decorations on the round muffin top as well. And the muffins smelled lemon-y. The paper liner came off the muffins easily. The muffin itself is very moist, light and tasty. I was pleased it was not "too" tart and not "too" sweet - just right. I normally don't like super sweet desserts but in this case, the sugar works well with both the lemon and raspberries because it offsets the tartness with its' sweetness. Next time I may add just a little more lemon juice for that stronger lemony flavor (personal preference). A very light, fruity and refreshing muffin! This recipe leaves room to substitute the fruit for others like blueberries, strawberriee, etc.

Good, and pretty lowfat.  I had to add about 1 Tbsp extra yougurt because my batter was dry.  Also took others advice and added about 3 Tbsp lemon juice, about the juice from one lemon.  Will make again.

Fabulous muffins!  I had frozen mixed berries and used those...I also added about 1/4tsp of lemon extract.  I made a quick glaze of powdered sugar, lemon juice and egg whites...they turned out beautiful and tasty!

I'm sorry but these are sooooo thick and dense, I should have known to add something else when I saw the dough.  It was like eating a a big ball of dough, bummer I think I'll have to throw them away :(

These muffins are divine!  Lower in fat, but certainly not lacking in flavor.  Delicious for anyday, but beautiful enough to give away, too.  I do have to add to the baking time--about 24 minutes total.  I always double the recipe, but don't get quite 2 dozen.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very yummy muffins. I checked the nutrition info before I made these and I can't believe there so low in fat after tasting them. I made the recipe exactly as written. I don't think I'd use sour cream instead of yogurt tho. Thats probably why someone said the batter was thick. Mine was perfect. Thanks alot!

These are good. Even though they're pretty healthy as is, I used whole wheat flour for part of the ap, and fat free no sugar added yogurt. I upped the lemon juice to 2 tbsp because I didn't have the extract, and just used 1 whole egg, because I'm lazy and it seemed easier. I made a whole pan of mini-muffins and a few regular sized, and the regular sized worked better. For the minis, the raspberries took up a lot of room in the muffin cups and when if one ended up against the side or the bottom, a whole side of the muffin was soggy. The taste was great in both sizes though.

Very good.  I used lemon yogurt - plenty of lemon flavor.  The batter was too thick, so I ended up adding a couple splashes of milk.  I cut each raspberry in half so there was a berry in each bite.

Please don't believe any negative reviews about these muffins. I just made them and took them to the fair and won a ribbon. I used vanilla yogurt and blue-berries. They were wonderful!!!

I made a few changes, but I don' t think they took away from the overall recipe so I'm giving it 5 stars. Instead of 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, I used 1/4 raspberry yogurt and 1/4 lemon.  I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and I  used the lemon extract but not the lemon zest (which probably would have made it even better, but I didn't have any and didn't want to make it!)  I also used fresh raspberries since the reason I found this recipe was because I had gone looking for a recipe to use up the raspberries I had bought on sale. These were delicious muffins that stayed moist in a tupperware container for days!

Made with whole wheat pastry flour and plain yogurt. Blueberries are good, as well as frozen cherries with extra vanilla. Every variation has been really good.

I was hoping for more of a lemon flavor but they are good. I used blueberry yogurt and frozen blueberries. Replaced the oil with applesauce. Next time I will add more lemon.

Excellent as is and can easily be adapted. Today I made them with strawberry yogurt, blueberries, and no lemon zest. Have used vanilla, bosenberry, and lemon yogurts in the past. Easy to just throw in any yogurt and frozen fruits you have on hand. Also great with a lemon glaze. (Try 1 T of lemon juice mixed with 1/2 cup of powered sugar.) Makes great mini muffins, too. I make 24 mini muffins and cut baking time to 12 minutes.

I do not really have much new to add from the other reviews.  These are quite good following the recipe as is other than the addition of 1T additional lemon juice (due to other reviews) and removal of sugar on top.  As noted elsewhere, this is a thick (almost dough) batter that will not pour but instead need to be spooned into the tin and a dense muffin.  I did not sugar the tops as suggested, and will likely do so on my next batch as they could have used a bit more sweet with the tangy tart.    While I made these as a snack, they would be wonderful for a morning meal with fruit and yogurt or hot cereal.  I, as some others had done, made 'mini muffins' and it was approximately 12 minutes of cook time.  These muffins do not brown on top so test as recipe suggests by gently pressing down and waiting for spring-back.  I will definitely be making these again, and have shared the recipe with others who are excited to try it.

Really pleased with this muffin!  I did make a few changes, per suggestions and my preferences.  I used 1 C, rather than 1/2 C. of yogurt, and used vanilla, because that is what I keep.  I omitted the lemon extract and used the juice and zest of one lemon, rather than measuring.  I like lemony!  Also, I prefer my muffins very fruity, so I add another cup of raspberries, bringing it to 2 C. of frozen raspberries.  Very pleased with this muffin, will not hesitate to serve it to others!

Oh, wow.  SO GOOD!  I have made them with both raspberries and strawberries (both frozen).  I felt that the strawberries didn't work out quite as nicely as the raspberries.  I think I'll stick with the raspberry version from now on.

These muffins were awsome!  I made mine with blueberries & blueberry yogurt instead of the raspberries.  I had blueberries on hand.  They turned out great. I made these to go with my leek/potato soup.  You will love these.

My first thought when I saw this recipe was how much I like Raspberry Lemonade to drink. So, I made these muffins and now I can say how much I like to eat Raspberry Lemonade! :) I thought these were delicious and very moist! My small changes to the recipe were that I used one egg instead of the two egg whites, I used about an extra half a cup of raspberries, and I put cinnamon in the sugar for the topping! Will be making again!

One word, and I'm going to shout it... AMAZING! I made two batches, one with regular yogurt and one with lemon flavored. I think I like the one with the lemon yogurt better, but there isn't much of a difference. Both batches have a subtle lemon flavor that's hard to detect but I didn't use the zest. I also used fresh raspberries and the little bit of tartness in them is perfect. My batter was a little thick and had me worried but they came out beautifully. Wish I had the ingredients to make at least 2 more batches. These are a 10 star.

These were absolutely delicious. I substituted fresh raspberries for frozen (mushing some of them a little first), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They disappeared within a day in my house. I will definitely make these again. Thanks!

Had lots of frozen rasberries on hand and yogurt. Used activia low fat rasp. yogurt and a little greek yogurt which I had on hand.  Next time I may have to add some sweetener to the raspberries.  Other than that I liked the flavor with the lemon

i made these with fresh strawberries coz i don't have frozen raspberries.some people used 1 egg instead of 2 whites,and so did i..everything was ok except the strawberries got all mushy..maybe coz i used fresh berries instead of frozen?i also put the batter directly in the greased muffin tray without any liners,as some said they stick badly and a lot went to waste..

Very good recipe. The consistency was more like a cookie dough than muffins, but after mixing in the fresh raspberries, it became a little more manageable. The end result was pretty tasty. I wouldn't leave out the lemon extract if you like lemon flavor.

Perfect lemon flavor.  I used the optional lemon extract and left my raspberries whole.  Everyone loved these muffins.  I sprinkled them with some sugar before baking and they turned out with a little crunch on top.  Great recipe that I will use often.

I didnt have any lemon zest, so I used a full teaspoon of lemon extract. Subbed 1 whole egg for the egg whites. Used plain yogurt, which was what I had on hand. These are not very sweet, so don't skip the sugar on top. It gives a perfect crunchy and sweet balance to the not-so sweet muffin. Great to keep on hand in the freezer since they taste fresh baked after 30 seconds or so in the microwave.

These muffins were delicious and very well received!  I used low fat lemon yogurt, the lemon extract, and juice and zest from one medium lemon.  They were perfectly lemon-y, and I have been asked to make them again.

These are the BEST muffins! I have made them with lots of different types of fruits and yogurts. I like French Vanilla yogurt with raspberries the best! They freeze really well, if you can manage to save any from being eaten the first day. I usually double the recipe because it only makes about 9 muffins in my pan.

I really don't like to be negative because cooking, while fun, is a lot of work.  So let me just say, that if I had not been cooking for 30 years, I would have been totally perplexed when it came to the point of adding the raspberries.  The batter was so thick that I had to add an additional tsp. of oil I followed the recipe exactly as it was written as I agree with those people who say you shouldn't review something when you change it all around, and the spoon stood up in the batter.  I gradually added small measures of milk until I had a "batter" into which I could fold the raspberries.  I followed the suggestions and put a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on top, and committed them to the oven.  It made exactly twelve.  I did use fresh raspberries because I had some here.  I cooked them fifteen minutes and am glad I took them out when I did.  Every oven is different, but I think next time, I'd try 375 degrees.  They are dense, but they are also tasty.  However, you do need to know what you are doing in the kitchen to make these work.  I think next time, I will leave one of the eggs whole for good measure and continue to add milk until the batter is a batter and not a dough.  Yes, they were dense, but they were also good and I liked the healthy component.  Thanks for the recipe.

These muffins are so good!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and used about 2.5 T of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, instead of 1 T.  I didn't have enough raspberries so used half raspberries and half blueberries.  Sprinkled the tops with turbinado sugar, which baked into a nice, sweet little crust.  My husband, who is not a baked goods fan ate a bunch.  These were so flavorful and so good.  Will definitely make again, using the same changes.

Really nice muffin. I made it according to the recipe except I used fresh raspberries (didn't have frozen). They came out perfectly. I folded the berries in carefully, so they stayed together pretty well. I can see this will work well with other berries. I will make these muffins again.

Excellent!  I used one whole egg to avoid throwing out two yolks and I substituted white whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as closely as possible and they are delicious.  I found crushing the frozen raspberries a bit helps distribute them through the batter to avoid big mushy pockets of cooked fruit.  Will definitely make these again!

WOW!!! Sensational! Light and zingy! I've made many muffin recipes, but this one's the best. I use Splenda (2 full cups rather than 1 1/2 cup, just to make sure they're sweet enough) and they dazzle everyone! I have to make two batches every time. I've made them with raspberries, blueberries, strawberries. Always winners. I recommend the 3T of lemon juice as well, instead of the one T, esp. if you're using Splenda. Just makes much more flavorful muffins. Thank you, Kathy!

This was a very dry recipe. I had to add 1/4 C of milk to get it to batter consistency rather than dough.  I also used brown sugar instead of white to try to keep some moisture in the muffins. I added about 2 TBS extra lemon juice, as I had no extract. One whole egg instead of whites, I hate wasting things. The batter didn't make enough for 12 muffins (in a regular tin) so I made 10 instead.  Had to bake for longer, 20 minutes.  The end result was pretty good, my husband loved them.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used whole eggs instead of egg whites.  I also added extra lemon juice.  I had fresh blueberries and frozen raspberries.  The blueberry ones were more popular.  I made the mistake of letting the frozen raspberries sit out while I prepared the rest, thus thawing them.  By the time I put them in the batter, they turned the batter pink.  So they didn't look that nice, but they sure were yummy!

delicious little muffins!! they're low-fat?? no way!! you can't even tell. i made one batch with raspberry and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to make it more lemony since i wasn't using the extract or zest. my next batch was with blueberries and i did the recipe's called for 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. both were great so it's just whether you want more lemon flavor or not. i also added more fruit than called for.. but then told that i didn't need to add so much fruit. so next time i make these (which will probably be soon...) i will make it exactly as the recipe says with both the raspberries and blueberries. wonderful muffins!

After reading all the rave reviews, I was expecting a sensational tasting muffin.  Unfortunately, not only did it taste dry and bland, it was also very unappealing to the eye.  Muffins should look golden; this one was white and pasty.  I put it under the broiler to brown the top.  But that did not solve the taste problem.  While the lemon and fruit flavour were apparent, the muffin itself was decidely dry and lacklustre.  I have tried many good muffin recipes, and I will not be keeping this one.

I loved these! I used frozen raspberries and a little more lemon zest for a more intense lemon flavor. I didn't bake them quite as long as the recipe said but I think that made them even better. YUMMY!

Good thing I doubled this recipe for my party cuz these just disappeared when I set them out for my brunch. Everyone REALLY loved them. I used low-fat vanilla yogurt and they came out so light and tasty. I'll make them again and again. Thank you!

These muffins are "the bomb." My husband and I both absolutely LOVE them. The combo of the raspberry and lemon yields a taste that is not too sweet and makes for just about the best darn muffin I've ever tasted. Good job Kathy!

Kathys recipe was the best muffin recipe I have ever used.  It was so easy that even my sister, who doesn't know how to cook, can make them.  I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

These muffins were so incredibly delicious!  My two teenager daughters really loved them.  We actually used blueberries and peaches in the recipe instead.  I'd make them again in an instant.  They were wonderful!

OMG THESE ARE RESTAURANT QUALITY MUFFINS!! I read through a lot of the reviews for the perfect one so here's mine (Only Minor changes!!)
I used Greek yogurt, 2 T lemon juice (no lemon extract), 1 tsp vanilla, Fresh raspberries, and white sanding sugar for the top. The dough was very thick so I added 1 T milk.  I sprayed the inside of the muffin liners as I think someone said they stuck. I tried it with orange zest (needs 2 tsp) and orange juice-outstanding as well!

Recently made these muffins for a bridal shower - used 1 egg instead of 2 egg whites, lemon yogurt, (skipped the lemon extract) and a combination of frozen blueberries and frozen raspberries.   Wow.  Excellent.  Moist.

Excellent! I used fresh raspberries (actually i put them in the freezer for just 1 hour before using it). I also used two small packages of raspberries from the supermarket (on sale). Because they were not frozen solid, it took an extra 10 minutes in the oven. Thank you for the recipe!

LOVE these muffins!!! They were nice and fluffy, have lots of flavor, and are just sweet enough...they don't taste healthy at all :) This recipe only made 9 regular sized muffins for me and I used baking cups.
I made them as per the recipe except I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and they were plenty sweet. Next time I may even try using only 1/3 cup of sugar.
I did use the lemon extract and doubled the lemon juice cause I wanted to use the whole lemon and not waste it. I love lemon flavor and this was the perfect amount!
These are going to be a staple in my recipe box! Thank you so much for sharing it!!

This muffin is so delicious!  I actually used strawberries instead of raspberries, and I used 3 tbsp lemon juice plus an extra splash.  I also had to pour in some milk (ran out of yogurt) since my mixture was too dry.  Overall, I will definitely make this again.

I made these with very finely chopped fresh strawberries and they were delicious! I think these are our new favorite muffins in our household. I did use half whole-wheat and half regular all-purpose flour to make them a touch healthier. I also followed some others' suggestion and used 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice. It provided just enough zip. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe to make healthy muffins for my school's snack program.  Note:  I did make some alterations to the recipe to make them evern healthier.  First, I subbed in half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  Second, I used half Splenda and half white sugar.  Based on other reviewers suggestions, I added more lemon juice (doubled) and included the regular amount of lemon extract.  Because I have students with egg allergies, I used an egg substitute product.  I used a very thick 0% fat Greek Yogurt, and I assume this is why my batter was very thick (including the fact that I used 1/2 whole wheat flour).  I added a 1/2 cup of skim milk per batch of muffins to thin the batter a bit.  I am always a little hesitant to bake at 400 degrees, so I baked at 375 degrees in a convection oven.  The muffins on the top rack baked quicker than those on the bottom, but the cooking time is just about right on at 375.  I did move the muffins around from bottom rack to top rack when the muffins on the top were done quicker.  These muffins were really tasty and healthy, hence the 5-star rating!

I made this recipe but baked it in my little 6-cup bundt pan.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and one whole egg instead of the egg whites, and I did add the lemon extract.  Since I was using a bundt pan, I didn’t use the optional sugar for sprinkling.  This was very good, not all that sweet.  I did make Vanilla Glaze from this site and drizzled it over my cooled cake.  Nice recipe.

I REALLY wanted these to work since they sound wonderful... but they didn't :(  I took the suggestions and used more lemon juice (and used the extract too).  I used flavored yogurt too.  The taste was only so-so.  My biggest problem by FAR was the thickness of the dough in comparison to the largeness of the berries.  I had such a difficult time with spooning it in.  Then the juice started seeping out from the berries, the batter could bake up but the bottoms burned.  Too bad...

I love this recipe. The yogurt is a nice alternative to milk, which I appreciate since my house goes through milk so fast I rarely have it when I need it. I've been playing with it for the last two days...

 Of course, I had to make a couple of changes because I can never leave well enough alone. First of all, I like big muffins, not cupcake sized muffins, so I doubled the recipe. Instead of lemon extract, I used the zest and juice of a full lemon, and I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla to just have that soft icecreamy aroma. I also tried whole frozen cranberries instead of raspberries. Don't half them...they cook and burst in the muffins fine on their own. I also topped with milk and sugar coated almond slices. I found that I needed a full 20 minutes instead of 15 because of the larger size and extra liquid.

These taste better than a recipe I have from William Senoma. I did use a 6 oz cup of lemon flavored yogurt instead of plain and I used one egg instead of 2 egg whites also used 1 full tbsp. Of fresh lemon zest... Delicious!

These muffins are really good!  I had to make a few slight substitutions but I'm sure they wouldn't affect the final outcome.  First, I used sour cream instead of yogurt because that's what I had on hand.  Second, I used strawberries instead of raspberries - I macerated them for an hour or two and then poured them in, juice and all.  The batter was a little thick so aside from the strawberry juice, a touch more lemon juice made the batter come to the right consistency.  I used a mini-muffin tin and baked for 10 minutes.  Yum!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and I used vanilla yogurt, 3 c of frozen strawberries (with it's juice), and left out the lemon extract (and left all else the same). I put the batter in a 9x13 pan and baked at 400 for 30 min.  Came out moist and delicious!

These were pretty good.  They definitely had a different crumb than other muffins I make, which I attribute to the lower fat content.  Still, very tasty, but an odd texture.  I made mine with frozen blueberries and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  The batter was very dense.  I used 3 Tbs. of lemon juice and no extract as per another reviewer's suggestion.  I'll likely make these again for market, but probably not for eating myself.

Good muffin, not very sweet so perfect for those who prefer a less sweet tasting muffin. The tart lemon along with the somewhat tart raspberries needs a bit more sweetness. The sweetness will depend on whether you happen to get berries harvested at the perfect time (ripeness) and the variety of the berry. The frozen berries I happen to get  must have come from a less sweet harvest. I used lemon yogurt and omitted the lemon extract. The batter was very thick which  makes it a bit harder to work with in filling the muffin cups. Also, if eaten straight from oven while still warm (which is how we like them) the muffins stick to paper muffin cups, though once cooled paper cup peels off easily.

Yum!! Delicious!! I made this with frozen cranberries and doubled the lemon juice and zest to make them extra lemony. They are very pretty, excellent texture... and I'm now hesitant to share my batch since I may just eat them all myself!!!

I made these as directed with the use of whole wheat flour. As others have said, these are too dense and really don't look appealing. As for taste: My husband thought these were okay to good - while my daughter and I didn't like at all. I won't make these again.

I doubled up on all the lemon ingredients and I still could barely taste the lemon flavor. I love the idea of these muffins with the fruit in them, but I won't be making them again.

These had a good flavor with lemon yogurt, zest, and extract.   The dough is kind of dry and the texture stiff, but the little patches of fruit help.  I wouldn't make again.

These were amazing muffins. I've made them 3 times already. Reminded me of raspberry lemonade. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things; I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup and used soy yogurt since I'm allergic to dairy.  They were fantastic.

We loved these!  I used vanilla fat free yogurt (this is what I had) and fresh raspberries - and it turned out perfect! very light and juicy. These looked very "pale" and I was a little bit scared they are not done yet - but 17 min was perfect time!

These are so good! I had very large fresh raspberries and followed another reviewer's suggestion of cutting them into smaller pieces to have berries in every bite. I used the optional lemon extract and recommended this. The lemon flavor really came through but didn't over-power the berries. I also added a quick, sweet/tart glaze of confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice and though it was perfect. Everyone really enjoyed these muffins. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and super moist!  I omitted the lemon extract, but added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also reduced the sugar to just over 1/2 cup.  Seems like a very versatile recipe and I look forward to trying it with different fruit and juice combinations.
*UPDATE* Tried this with frozen blackberries and it did NOT work. They ended up being overcooked on top and still raw on the inside.  I know this is a good recipe so I think I'll just stick with using fresh fruit.

Batter was too thick.  I thinned it with milk and sour cream.  Although the Lemon Extract is listed as optional, I think it's probably important.  I used extra lemon juice and lemon zest (since I didn't have extract) but it still wasn't very lemony.  Thanks for a good recipe but I will adjust next time.

These are absolutely delicious and don't taste low fat at all. I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 whites, and used twice the amount of lemon juice and lemon extract, with a sprinkled Splenda topping -  the rest was followed exactly. They taste like raspberry lemonade and are perfect for a quick breakfast because they are moist, fruity and just a little bit sweet. I made 6 large muffins. They're so easy to make and I have tons of leftover ingredients, so I will be making more of these tomorrow because I have a feeling I'm going to eat them all tonight :)  I'm not sure how they were too dense for some, although I did end up adding a splash of 1% milk to thin the batter just a little.

I thought they were really good fresh, but didn't stay fresh tasting very long - the berries made the cake around them kinda mushy, and they didn't taste that great out of the freezer for the same reason.

These are one of my favorite muffins to make.  Everyone loves them and asks for the recipe.  I always use lemon yogurt (yoplait) instead of the lemon extract.

I really like this recipe, they turned out quite well, I did find I had to add a little extra liquid and would also put in maybe 1/4 cup more raspberries. I only had one egg so used the whole thing worked well.

we LOVED these muffins! I used mixed berries instead of raspberries and did mini-muffins.I recommend doing 10 minutes for mini-muffins and they turned out sweet and moist.

Definitely a great recipe! These don't taste low fat at all. I added 2 extra tablespoons of lemon juice, and an extra 1/2 of raspberries, and subbed applesauce for the oil. I also used a little milk to thin out the batter, as even using yogurt, I found it to be too thick. I think mostly, if you use yogurt and not sour cream, the type of yogurt also effects the thickness of the batter.   Overall, these were a huge hit! Will definitely be making these again, and soon.

These muffins are great! I used vanilla yogurt and 1c white flour & 1/2c whole wheat pastry flour. I didn't have any lemon extract, so I skipped that (they still had a nice lemon flavor). I also added about 1/4c ground flax seed. I use the "golden" kind - my husband has commented/complained that I add flax to all my baked goods, but since I switched to the golden flax meal he doesn't even know I still use it. ;-) The batter seemed a little thick, so I also added about 2T of milk. I made the muffins to take to work, but I don't think there will be enough left by tomorrow!

Not my favorite muffin recipe.  The texture wasn't my favorite, almost chewy.  Also I thought it needed more lemon flavor.  Boyfriend didn't even know they were lemon until I told him.

Good recipe. My sister kept saying they tasted healthy. I don't think they were sweet enough for her. I used lemon yogurt and fresh raspberries. The batter was extremely thick and I had to loosen it up with some milk and extra lemon yogurt. Still didn't have that much lemon flavor but the taste was still really good.

Great recipe, I used extra lemon zest and fresh lemon juice. I did use fresh raspberries instead of frozen. They came out great. I took another reviewer's suggestion and sprinkled a little sugar on them but I didn't notice any difference in taste.

I used mixed frozen berries, and used lime juice instead of lemon, substituting another tbsp of juice for the zest and omitting the extract. They came out excellent, fluffy and moist, just the right amount of sweet for a breakfast/snack muffin and all around delicious! I will definitely be making them again.

These were interesting--very GOOD interesting, that is! I made a few *slight* changes: I used sour cream in place of the yogurt (I didn't have any on hand) and omitted the sugar on top of the muffins. I also doubled the amount of lemon juice. I felt that the muffins could have used a LOT more lemon juice and zest. The raspberry flavor was powerful but I could barely taste any lemon. I love that these are so low in fat and they really finish well. I do have to admit- after the first few bites I took, I was not impressed. They are a bit plain, which is why I think they need more lemon juice. However, these muffins really grow on you after a while, and I even started craving them! So, give these a chance and you'll love them too! Thanks for the recipe.

These were really good, although I did have to make a few changes based on what I had in my fridge.  Instead of yogurt, I used half sour cream/half milk.  I also used fresh raspberries.  To add a little extra sweetness, I put on a glaze of sugar and lemon juice.

For the relatively little amount of oil needed for this recipe, the muffins turned out great.  I did a few things differently than what the recipe asked.  I doubled the recipe and used 4 whole eggs as I didn't want to waste the yolks.  This made the muffins denser, not in a bad way, in a great way!  I didn't have any lemon extract so I used 4 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice instead and I put in all the rind of a large lemon to accentuate the lemon flavour.  I also added more raspberries than required as I like things fruity.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used strawberry yogurt and that was fine too. Be careful not to overcook the muffins.  375 degrees is better than 400 as I burned my muffins on the bottom when I turned them up by 25 degrees. All in all, I would make this recipe again in a snap.

I used a cup of fat-free strawberry yogurt, juice and zest of a whole lemon, vanilla instead of lemon extract, mixed whole wheat and white flour, almost 2 cups of frozen raspberries, added ground flax, and reduced sugar slightly.  In an attempt to make a not unhealthy recipe healthier the slight changes I made still made for a great muffin.  Next time I will use greased muffin tins as a good portion of the muffin stays attatched to the paper cup.

The lemon flavor was too subtle for me, even after tripling the amount of lemon zest and adding more lemon juice (I didn't have the extract).  It was still a great flavor/texture combo, though.  I did add more raspberries - one cup wasn't enough for my taste.

So delicious!!! I lopped off one star because it needs way, way more lemon zest to equal the strong flavor of the berries. We used a combo of frozen rasberries and blueberries and extra lemon zest and juice. They are a wonderful quick breakfast because they aren't too sweet!

I've been trying a new blueberry muffin recipe every week trying to find the perfect muffin. Well...I've found it!! These muffins taste like lemon loaf with blueberries. I doubled the recipe and used the juice of 1 lemon and the rind of 2 lemons in the recipe. Then I made the glaze with the juice of 1 lemon and 1 cup of icing sugar; pouring it on the hot muffins. I used a whole package of frozen blueberries. I had to add a little bit of milk because the mix was too dense. Excellent! Thanks so much!! Doubled, it makes 12 jumbo muffins.

I took these to work for breakfast for all the girls, and they all loved them. I used blueberries in place of raspberries, and I think the flavors went very well together. I used fresh grated orange peel instead of lemon (didn't have any lemons) and baked them in mini muffin tins with a cinnamon/sugar topping sprinkled on top. Cute and delicious.

These are very good. I am glad that I read some other advice on them, though. I used the juice of half a lemon and omitted the extract (bc I didn't have any) and the zest of one lemon. I also used 2 tbl. of applesauce and 1 tbl. of oil to cut down on fat. I did add 2 tbl. of milk to thin it out a bit. Also, I made a glaze as someone else suggested with about 1/3C powdered sugar and the juice of half a lemon. What I did notice was how dense these were. I don't know really know why. So, I will just have to try them again. Great combination of zing and sweetness but not too sweet!

These were not too sweet and great for brunch.  I used fresh raspberries and a container of vanilla yogurt.  The batter was a bit thick, but I added some evaporated skim milk & they turned out just fine.  Yummy!  Thanks Kathy!

These are delicious!  They are not too sweet and the rasberries have a great flavor.  I did not use the lemon extract, and although I used extra zest mine didn't have much .emon flavor.  Next time I will use the lemon extract for sure.  Thanks!

A delicious muffin recipe!  I absolutely adore the combination of lemon and raspberries; this makes a wonderful snack or breakfast.  I made only one adjustment to this recipe - instead of 1/2 cup of yogurt, I added another 1/2 cup (because the batter was so thick) and cooked the muffins for 25 minutes, instead of 15.  The recipe still made 12 large muffins.

Like others have said, there is not much of a lemon taste.  I also found that 2 cups of raspberries to be too much.  The frozen raspberries were too tart and over powered the muffin. If I were to make these again I would tweak the recipe some. More lemon and less fruit, and plenty of sugar on top for that finished touch. Glad I tried this recipe though.  To Die for Blueberry Muffins are 5*.

These are very good, but no taste of lemon (I did not use the lemon extract).  Next time I will use the juice and zest of the full lemon.  Excellent for a low fat and calorie muffin!  Do not overmix.

Thank you so much for a great recipe, Kathy!  These were moist and just the right sweetness.  I served them for Mother's Day tea, and they were a hugh hit.  I made them as mini muffins, and I got more than 24.  I used lemon fat free yogurt, lemon extract, and the zest, with canned mini blueberries.  They were perfect.

I used lemon yogurt, an extra tbsp of lemon juice, an extra 1/2 cup of raspberries, no extract and no zest.  These were great, but NO WAY will you get a dozen muffins from this recipe.  I got 8, and the cups weren't filled as full as I normally fill them.

Light and lemony - can't believe it's this good and low fat. Frozen raspberries are so convenient - you can always have them in the freezer.Lemon juice and zest are easy to freeze.  The rest of the ingredients are ones that most people would already have on hand.  Delicious, healthy, easy and convenient.

This is a good recipe, but I don't think it qualifies as spectacular.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and that worked fine.  The batter is EXTREMELY stiff; I would thin it out a little more next time.  If you don't use lemon extract, you won't taste the lemon at all, I don't think.

These were ummm, ummm, GRRRREAT! I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and I didn't have lemon ext. either so I didn't use that. I took them out of the muffin tins right away and was afraid they'd fall apart cause they seemed very fragile but they were fine.  Really tasty muffins!! Thanks!

I saw these in the email that announces the newest recipes. These muffins were the most refreshing tasting muffins I've had. I used only the real lemon juice, no concentrate. They had a nice chewy kind of crust and sweet-tart lemon flavor. If you've got raspberries and a lemon on hand, they can be whipped up very quickly, and I highly recommend them.

These are scrumptious!! I made them for my family this morning and even my husband (the picky eater in the family) loved them. They look so nice too. What a great recipe for brunch! I omitted the lemon extract since I didn't have any, but I don't think they needed it. Thanks, I'll be making these often!

Followed the recipe but by accident I dropped the egg yolk with the white so I didn't take it out and just was gonna use 1 whole egg. But the mixture seemed very thick so I added 1 egg white and it was more creamy. (Although after I put the muffins in the oven I decided to watch the video and their mixture looked thick) either way they turned out delisious and I'm deffinitly gonna add it to my recipe book. If you make these add the sugar/flour/butter crumb on top of muffins.

Good, I made a few batches. The first was with all purpose flour, the 2nd was with pastry flour. They were both great. I also used french vanilla yogurt (all i had), lime juice, and almond flavoring. I also sprinkled pecans on top too. Oh, and I used cherries instead of raspberries. All great!

I juiced one medium sized lemon and used all of the juice. I didn't add the lemon extract.  I also used fresh raspberries (my 7 year old was happy to have the job of cutting each berry in half, that way we could spread the raspberry love).  These were very tasty muffins!  I think I'll bake the mix in a loaf pan next time, and top with a lemon glaze.

I made this recipe and used fresh raspberries. Muffins were very moist and full of berries which my family likes.  Muffins pulled away from liners easily.  I had lemon juice left over so made a glaze and drizzled it over top. Scrumptious!!  We will definitely make this again soon and try a different berry.

I thought there was a mistake when mixing the batter-it was sooo thick, surely there wasn't enough wet ingredients. Frustrated, I poured in a splash of milk and a tiny bit more oil...not much though. Then stirred in frozen blueberries and threw them in the oven without sprinkling the sugar on top because, frankly, I thought they'd end up in the trash. But I was totally surprised when these came out moist and delicious and pleasantly sweet! I added the zest and juice of a whole lemon and used the extract as well and the lemon flavor was wonderful. Instead of the two whites I also used a whole egg because I love the flavor and texture that yolks bring to baked goods. These are great-especially considering they are so low in fat. Thanks!

So i did alter it because when i was making the dough it was not liquidy enough. I added 1/4 cup of milk and used 2 whole eggs instead of just 2 egg whites (the yoke makes it more moist). I also like to use melted butter in place of oil. I also used fresh raspberries and vanilla yogurt. Came out perfect! Moist and fluffy. What a great idea to use yogurt in them!! Ill make this again!

These were really good.  I used fresh blueberries, and substituted sour cream for the plain yogurt.  Instead of topping with white sugar before baking, I made a glaze from lemon juice, milk vanilla and powdered sugar.

The batter was far too thick and there were more berries in each muffin cup than batter even though I followed the recipe.  The only thing I can think of that may have affected the batter was that I used Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt.

I made these muffins with frozen blackberries.  Absolutely wonderful.  The texture and the flavor are the perfect balance and they are so easy to make.  These dont last long, so if you are planning to take some for a quick breakfast during the week, make 2 batches!  I just wrap individually in plastic wrap and keep in the fridge to grab for a quick breakfast or snack.

The raspberries were too much, even though we love raspberries themselves. We also couldn't taste the lemon, even though we used all the zest and juice from a lemon (which is about twice as much as the recipe called for). On the plus side, they were very moist and had a good texture. 
I have gotten better results with a triple berry blend instead of all raspberries. Since the recipe states any berry can be used, I've raised rating from 3 stars to 4 (not enough lemon flavor for 5 stars). It's OK to sub sour cream for the yogurt; results are similar both ways.

These muffins came out very nice albeit not as sweet as my husband usually likes his desserts.  I made a few modification that may have contributed to this:  I used 0% Fage Greek yogurt as it was all I had on hand.  This yogurt is quite thick, less sweet, and has a sour note. The resulting batter was more like cookie dough than muffin mix.  However, to rescue the consistency I mashed fresh whole raspberry (my husband prefers the tie-die effect of the mash over the whole fruit) and incorporated it into the mix.  This loosened up the batter and added the fresh fruit element. I liked the flavor of the lemon and did add the extract to really bring out the citrus.

All-in-all after baking these muffins, I was happy with the results.  Next time I'll either add a bit more sugar if repeating with the Greek yogurt or maybe add a lemon icing to the top..  I used turbinado sugar to sprinkle on top of the batter before baking.  It was a nice touch.

Despite the burned bottoms, these muffins were delicious.  Either 400 degrees is too high, or 17 minutes is too long.  At 15 minutes they were too moist.

Carelessness on my part, but after 15 minutes, I realized I'd set the oven at 350 instead of 400.  Uncooked muffins, so I bumped up to 400, put them back in the oven, and then ended up overcooking them a little.   Not to worry, they were still good.  Used fresh raspberries and Greek lemon yogurt, and those flavors really were vibrant in these muffins! Definitely will be made again (next time at the right temperature).

These turned out very well, I made two batches with some changes after reading the reviews. I used raspberry greek yogurt instead of plain, added one egg yolk, 4 TBSP of fresh lemon juice, an extra 1/2 cup of raspberries and did not use lemon extract. I definitely suggest using the zest if you skipped it and did not like them- it makes a big difference in the taste. These are very good- Taste slightly healthy, but not in a bad way. They are a little bit dense and the muffin is a little chewy if you cook it for too long but the fruit makes up for it. Be very careful to not overmix this or it will turn out very tough and hard- you want some small lumps in the batter.

great recipe! Did it with raspberry yoghurt, (a little more than called for) and one whole egg because I didn't want to bother separating. Came out perfectly!

I just made these and they might be the best muffins I've ever baked. I only made some minimal changes in that my liquid measurements weren't quite as exact--for the yogurt, I used a little bit over 1/2 cup and I used lemon chiffon yogurt because I couldn't find plain lemon and for lemon juice, I just juiced half a lemon instead of measuring out the tablespoon. I made them with strawberries and they were soooo good. I might try them with raspberries next time, but I don't know. The strawberries were pretty amazing. Thanks for this recipe!

I used Greek yogurt in place of regular yogurt and the batter was really, really thick. I had to add some more egg white to be able to stir it. Lesson learned! Anyhow, the lemon flavor combined with the raspberries was really delicious. I'd try it again - this time, with regular style yogurt

Great flavor, but they came out hard as scones!  The only different thing I did was use a whole egg instead of egg whites, but many people recommended that.  Not sure what went wrong.

Followed the recipe but for some reason the muffins came out very dense and heavy. The flavor was great so I will make these again but alter to prevent the heaviness.

These were okay. I definitely wouldn't say they're "5 star" muffins, and lemon/raspberry is actually one of my favorite flavor combos so im already being pretty lenient. My raspberries also leaked their color a bit so i had light pink muffin tops and a swirl of white/pink inside. I guess just make sure to not take those out of teh freezer until the second you're dropping them into the batter?

Great base to use for sure. I love tart and sweet together. Another great substitute  is using Blue Raspberries, instead of red... use sugar on top, Garnish with a smidge of grinded lemon drop candy, and a smidge of fresh chopped mint leaves (Not dried!!). Lemon Drops add a little sour tang, and the touch of mint makes it oh so refreshing.

Delicious. I used raspberry yogurt for one batch and blueberry for another. I didnt have just plain frozen raspberries so i used a medley of raspberry blueberry and blackberry. Turned out great. They're even better the next day.

Loved these!  I used lemon yogurt, lemon extract, and FRESH raspberries.  I was afraid they would turn out too lemony, but they did not!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

YUMMY!  I made mine into mini muffins.  Next time I will crush up the berries a bit.  The whole raspberries in a mini muffin tin ended up being too large and made it difficult to remove the muffins from the tin. I did everything the same except used whole eggs...I doubled it and didn't have 4 eggs, so I just used 2 whole eggs.

I liked these but I had to up the amount of lemon to really taste it. It wasn't hard though, I just sub. the plain yogurt with lemon.

These muffins are FABULOUS! Very moist unlike most other recipes I've tried. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil and I also bumped up the lemon zest and juice, using the zest of 2.5 lemons and the juice of 2. I added too many raspberries, so mine are a little more tart than I like, but that was completely my mistake. They're very fresh, which is nice compared to other recipes that are too sweet. I will definitely make these again :D

I thought that these muffins were just okay.  I found them to be a bit tart and thought that the batter tasted better than the actual muffins.  I might make these again using less raspberries and the optional lemon extract to see if that helps with the tartness.

I didn't have any lemons, lemon juice, or lemon extract in the house so I made these as just raspberry muffins and they were delicious. Also made a few changes: used 1 tbsp apple juice instead or lemon, 1 whole egg, 1 full cup of sugar, 1.5 cups raspberries, and vanilla.

These were good muffins . . . but a little bland.  I used plain yogurt (that's what the recipe called for and what I had in the fridge).  I can see why flavored yogurt is recommended by reviewers as it is sweetened and provides more flavor.  If you use plain yogurt, they are good but just kind of bland . . . need more sugar maybe!  I used blueberries instead of raspberries because that's what I had and maybe next time I'll add vanilla.  Nice texture to the muffins though, nice and moist!

Just made these with frozen blueberries from last summer.  I replaced some of the flour with whole wheat, and they still turned out scrumptious, with just the perfect amount of lemony flavor.

Delicious and lemony right out of the oven, but after a few hours the outside got really tough, and I followed the recipe exactly (though, in all fairness, I'm not the most experienced baker).    They were tasty, though, and I would try them again.

I followed the recipe exactly. But...I used greek yogurt and I'm wondering if that made a difference?? My batter turned out more like dough. They still turned out pretty good. I'm going to try it with blueberries next time.

These weren't bad. It is, however, imperative that you use berries STILL frozen. With my first batch, the berries had thawed some, and the result was a bright pink muffin that tasted overwhelmingly of raspberry. The second batch (berries still frozen) had a much nicer blend of flavores and a more attractive result.

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was super! Next time, I'm going to add a lil' more lemon juice (1/2 TBL)and a little more zest. This is just my preference. I'm not sure why some comments said more fruit, I felt one cup was just enough fruit in each bite. More fruit would overload it with seeds from the raspberries.  Next time, i'm trying blueberries. Its a definite keeper.

So good! I used low-fat lemon yogurt, extra lemon juice, and a frozen cherry berry mix. I chopped up most of the berries because they were pretty large and baked them for 20 minutes. They're really easy to make and delicious, not sure how people messed them up.

So Good!!! I made changes, only based upon what I did and did not have: I used vanilla yogurt, fresh raspberries, applesauce instead of oil, and didn't use anything lemon. They came out perfect! (If using fresh raspberries, remember to barely stir them in if you don't want them to be pink.)

As another reviewer stated, I too had problems with the batter and had to mix in 2-3 tablespoons of milk to get it to the right consistency.  I used leomn yogurt instead of the plain and loved the lemony taste of these muffins. I didn't feel the raspberries added to the flavor, but rather took away. I will make this recipe again without them.

I finally found the perfect muffin recipe. Didn't have raspberries, so used blueberries, instead. They were so good. Will definitely stick to this recipe from now on. Thanks for posting it. I used sugar in the raw on top as someone had suggested.

Let me preface this review by saying that I hate lowfat baked goods.  But, this recipe sounded pretty promising, so I tried it, and I am so glad I did.  These are moist, flavorful, and I'll definitely make them again.  Try them, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious.  I used lemon yogurt. I used both rasberries and blueberries. I topped some of them with powdered sugar at the end as I forgot to put the regular sugar on in the beginning.  Works well for brunch or an afternoon tea.

Great flavor, but a bit thick so I doubled the yogurt. I used fresh unfrozen raspberries,I think a little more lemon would also be better. They were really good and I will make again!!

Yummy and Easy!!  I used strawberry yogurt, fresh raspberries, a whole egg and added a few splashes of milk, as it seemed way to thick.  Also did not have the lemon zest or lemon extract and they were still excellent!  It also took more like 20 minutes for them to bake.  This has been added to the recipe box at our house!

These were pretty good...I wouldnt call them the greatest muffin ever.  My daughter didn't really care for them, but had fun making them with me.  I'll make again but change a few things.

Delightful muffin! I used 1/4 c. wheat germ, 2 T. flax meal, and the remainder whole wheat flour in place of white flour, and used lemon yogurt. I'm sure plain yogurt is good, also. Great recipe!

These are excelent!  I made them for a brunch with an. Assortment of other muffins ans all of these were gone in a flash.  The only things that I changed was that I use lemon yogurt instead if plain and drizzled them with a lemon juice/confectioners sugar glaze.  An instant favorite!

This is pretty good.  I pretty much followed the directions except I did use a lemon chiffon flavored yogurt and added some extra lemon juice and extra sugar.  It didn't have a very strong lemon flavor, but they're still pretty good.  It's a different kind of muffin, but good.  I'll probably make it again.

This wasn't my favorite recipe. I don't know if it's because they didn't taste like "fattening" muffins, but they weren't any special. Just okay!

These are good, but not as great as I was expecting them to be. I would have liked more lemon flavor, so maybe I will try these again, adding more zest/extract/juice. I did have to add a splash of milk, as the batter was a tad dry. Thanks :)

Very, very good. Does not taste low fat or healthy at all :) I used a frozen berry mix and fat free blackberry yogurt, and I omitted the lemon zest because I don't have any. I will make this again I am sure.

Wonderful and so easy!  I've made these exactly as the recipe is written, and I've left things out or changed everything from the type of flour used, to the yogurt flavor, to the fruit, with no problems.  I usually make six very large muffins, and just add a few minutes to the baking time.

These were very good muffins.I did find the batter a bit to thick so I added 2 more tablespoons of yogurt.Perfect after that.Be carefull that you distribute the fruit evenly through the batter.A couple of the muffins were mushy because there was a few too many raspberrys in it.I will try next time with strawberrys maybe add a bit of cinnamon too it.

Munching on one right now! Pretty good.  Followed the recipe exact except use vanilla yogurt, applesauce instead of oil, fresh rasberries and threw some flaxseed in the batter for some additional fiber. Only thing is the bottom is just a tad "wet" around the edges(probably from the applesauce) but wanted them lighter in fat. Will definately make again.

These were a nice treat. I used a little milk in the batter and the egg whites. I also added fresh lemon juice, and the lemon extract. I thought it had a nice light lemony flavor. At first I thought the raspberries were too sour with it, but once they cooled the raspberries blended nicely. I'll make them again. Sugar on top gives it a nice touch.

Thank you so much for this recipe - who knew muffins could be so easy and delicious!  I used lemon yogurt because I didnt have the lemon extract or lemon zest and used the entire egg rather than just the whites.  They looked and tasted wonderful!  I also used a glaze of 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and 1 TBSP of lemon juice and spooned it over when they were still hot.  Excellent - thank you again!

Very good.  Not a lemony as I had hoped.  I even used lemon yogurt.
Next time I will use more lemon extract. They are good for Breakfast because they are not very sweet.

Really, really nice...not necessarily over-the-top amazing, but really nice. I love having the raspberries in them...it's an extremely nice shift from the usual blueberries. Sprinkling some sugar on top makes them brown nicely. The batter is really, really thick - similar to cookie dough - but the finished product is just fine...be careful not to overmix. I didn't use lemon extract, but I think it would really make a huge difference (positively) in the overall flavor & maybe add an extra star or two to my rating.

I made this with strawberries, and replaced the oil with pureed pears (a jar of babyfood pears) and the sugar with Splenda. Hubby and kids LOVED them, and I had the satisfaction of knowing they were actually good for them! I'm looking forward to trying with raspberries soon!

These muffins were very tasty, but I was hoping for more of a lemon flavor.  Since the lemon extract was optional, I didn't use it, since I didn't have any on hand.  Maybe it would have tasted more lemony with lemon yogurt.  I used blueberries instead of raspberries.

These were very good. Nice and lemony and the sugar sprinkled on the top adds just the right amount of sweetness. These are good because they're not real sugary sweet muffins.

Wow!  These are great and so much better for you than "regular" muffins.  We loved them.  I shared them with my parents and my mom immediately wanted the recipe.  I highly recommend these!

Quick and easy recipe with great results. I never have lemon extract on hand so I just use a single-serve container of lemon yogurt instead of plain to get some extra lemon flavor in there. I also just zest the whole lemon. Sprinkling a little raw sugar on top just before baking is the perfect touch on these.

I used half sour cream and half yogurt (vanilla activia)....has to add a dash of milk as the batter was quite thick.  I didn’t use lemon extract and used fresh berries instead of frozen, blueberries & raspberries.

I'm not sure raspberries are the best option for this.  My dough was thick, almost like biscuit dough.  I pre-froze my fresh raspberries.  It took longer to cook.  The raspberries lose moisture and it kept the muffins rather soggy.  They tasted ok but I won't make this one again.

Kathy has outdone herself once again with this recipe. These muffins have changed my life. I don’t think I will ever be the same again. Best enjoyed when the lemon is cut lengthwise to enhance the flavour.

This recipe is amazing.  Very fluffy flavorful muffins and I love the fact that you can substitute other berries for the raspberries.  Have made it twice and I'm going to make again using frozen blueberries.

My kids loved this! I did substitute out the yogurt for rice milk and subbed the egg for a egg substitute due to allergies. Instead of raspberries I used fresh strawberries. And it came out delicious - they've asked for more. Thanks!

These made for a super yummy breakfast! Tart to sweet ratio was awesome. I made a written, however I used 1 entire lemon for zest and juice plus 1/2 tsp lemon extract. Thank you for sharing this bright and delicious treat!!!

I made it into 36 mini muffins. I put the frozen raspberries in a bowl and used a pastry cutter to chop them into small pieces  before adding them to the batter so they wouldn't overwhelm the muffins. I also used plain greek yogurt. Baked for  about 12-13 minutes .  They turned out awesome!

family had mixed reviews, maybe cause i did used lime yogurt - that it tasted too much like yogurt.
next time, I'll sub for sour cream; and add lemon juice to taste. my dough was also dense, i used one egg  and 1/2 c sugar - and had to add some extra yogurt.

I made these and replace the egg whites with 1 whole egg.  I also used fresh raspberries instead of frozen and added about an extra tablespoon of lemon juice because the muffin batter was very thick.   I made half of the recipe with white decorating sugar on top of the muffins and the other half with a streusel topping.  I have to say the muffins were best with just the sugar on top.  I think the fresh raspberries and fresh lemon juice/zest + lemon extract made them very delicious!  I filled the cups about 2/3 full.  Delicious!

I made changes to suit ingredients I had, and they were DELICIOUS- much better than I expected they would be. Instead of plain yogurt, strawberry; instead of 2 egg whites, one white and one whole egg; instead of lemon extract, orange extract; instead of  lemon zest; orange zest from a bottle. And, I made mini muffins and baked for about 14 min.  It made 32 mini muffins.

I have raspberries from my garden! So I used fresh!!! Just stirred them in, didn’t worry about them breaking up (cause they will!!! So very yummy, and because they weren’t frozen...I didn’t have the chance they were all sunken at the bottom!!! I prefer to clean one bread pan vs. 12 muffin cup pan!!! ??

I don’t know where I went wrong. I followed the recipe and I had nowhere close to enough liquid. Ended up adding the egg yolks and milk as it wasn’t even enough liquid to make a cookie type texture without them!

Not a keeper. The "batter" was unlike any muffin I've ever made; more like dough. Muffins turned out very flat with no rise. Difficult to get out of the tin, even after using cooking spray. The second star was for the flavor, which was good, but I will not be making these again.

Made this as a loaf, cooked at 375 for approx 35-40 minutes, came out perfect. I did add 3tbs of fresh lemon juice and added lemon yogurt as suggested in other reviews. I also added dark chocolate chips 1/2 c as raspberries and chocolate just are perfect together.

These muffins are really good!  My entire family loved them.  I made exactly as written but used a 6 oz. container of vanilla yogurt and finished  with the crumb topping as recommended by the top reviewer. I did find that it made about double the amount of topping needed to cover a dozen muffins.  Next time I will cut that in half.  Otherwise, great recipe!

This recipe was easy to make and very delicious. However I did make a couple of small changes. I followed the advice of some of the others and added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. I use juice from lemon and not the lemon extract. I also added extra raspberries. My fiancé loved the extra raspberries, but when I make it again, I just might stick to a cup as opposed to a 1 1/2. I also used fresh raspberries.

I followed the recipe as written, including adding the lemon extract, but I swapped out half the AP flour for whole wheat. The resulting "batter" wasn't even moist enough to get all the flour dry. I mixed it as well as I could but then had to add probably close to a quarter cup of almond milk in total before it was wet enough. (I basically just kept adding almond milk until the consistency seemed right.)

The muffins turned out very tasty and not dense as mentioned in other reviews, so my 3-star rating applies to the original recipe. I would definitely make these again but only according to my modifications.

These are absolutely fabulous muffins!!!  I love that they are not too sweet!!  I followed the recipe, adjusting for high altitude (5280') which included:  adding 2 T to the plain yogurt; reducing the white sugar by 1 T; reducing the baking powder by 1/4 tsp: increasing the oven temp to 425.  I did use the lemon extract, which I think increases the flavor.  I did not use the sugar for decoration.  I also used 1/3 measuring cup to make sure each muffin was uniform in size.  I have tried this recipe several times and have finally perfected it, for the altitude in which I live.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  It's a winner!!!

I love this recipe because I have many many bags of frozen raspberries from my garden to use up. I’m the only one in my house that wants to eat these, so I cut the recipe in half, I used applesauce instead of the oil and liked it better that way. I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times and prefer it with the applesauce. I do add more applesauce  than would normally be called for, otherwise I find the batter to be very think and it cooks unevenly.

I really enjoyed these muffins!  They were a perfect recipe to use our fresh picked raspberries in.  I used applesauce instead of the vegetable oil and believe my proportions of milk were then off as the recipe isn't specific about exactly how much to use with that substitution.  The result was still a very tasty muffin, but a little thicker like a pound cake texture.  I used the optional lemon extract and the lemon zest - loved that tart flavor with the raspberries.  I had to bake a few extra minutes (about 6) to get them cooked all the way through.

I used vanilla yogurt and less sugar. Also added blueberries. They were quite tasty but small muffins and unfortunately stuck to the paper liners. I would make them again but will  grease the tins next time, no papers

I followed the recipe as is except I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil to bring down the calories.  This did make the mixture a little thicker so I added a splash of water before the raspberries. Great low calorie treat!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I love lemon and raspberries so I added another tbsp of lemon and about 1/2 cup of raspberries. They needed closer to 18 minutes (at 400 degrees).  Eaten 2 within 10 minutes. Will make again as I still have a pound of raspberries in the fridge.

I had the ingredients all ready to go, used blueberries (instead of raspberries) & both the lemon zest & juice, but this was just too heavy & certainly not my best turnout!   Maybe next time I won't use plain yogurt?

Really liked the flavor!  Used blackberries with lemon yogurt. 
Because they are not too sweet they are the perfect breakfast muffin.  Would probably add a bit of milk next time to make them a touch more moist!

This was a total flop for me.  I did do a few substitutions, so maybe it was on my end, but these were so awful that even my kids spit them out.   I used one whole egg instead of two egg whites, and my yogurt was greek yogurt.  The batter was like dough.  I had to keep adding water to get it to be spoonable, so all the stirring likely made them turn out crazy tough.  I pitched these.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I made some changes though. For the 2 egg whites I use 1 whole egg. I do NOT use extract but 2 avg/lg sized lemons (juice and zest).  I make a triple batch (this is b/c with 2 lemons it is too zippy as a double batch, perfect as a triple batch) These muffins freeze well too. I also use fresh rasp (we grow them). I add more on top to those muffins that need a few more before baking. I found using a 1/4c to scoop is perfect size for muffin cups.

It was the first time I was using raspberries, so maybe it has to do with that... didn't care for the sour tang of the raspberries. The dough looked really pretty and rose up well but was disappointed with the taste.

They were netter as a regular sized muffin than a mini size. Too much fruit for a mini muffin not enough cake. The cake was on the  lighter side so nice for summer. Enjoyed the lemon with the berries. Used frozen raspberries from the garden. The batter was quite thick but thinned out and a little lumpy/separated from mixing on the frozen berries.

Well, I made ir exactly as called for. When I was through making the batter it was so thick and heavy, I just could not bake it as made! The reviews I read had all added the whole egg or milk or yogurt with fruit on the bottom I knew why they gave it more stars. So I sucurmmed and added another egg and a 1/4 c milk. Then the batter was a more normal consistancy and finally baked them. They had a nice lemon raspberry flavor . Nothing out of the ordinary though, just a nice light fluffy muffin, so I'm sticking with the three stars.

This recipe is excellent with blueberries. I also used the juice of the whole lemon and as much zest as I could get. The first time I used raspberries and they were a little too juicy. A big hit and I'll be making them again.

Loved these muffins!  Only made a couple of small adjustments to the recipe...I used fresh raspberries rather than frozen, used one 5 - 6 oz container of lemon Greek yogurt rather than plain, and I added a little more lemon juice & milk just because it needed a little more liquid to get to the right consistency.  Delicious!  I will definitely make these again.

I love these muffins. They are very, very good. I also went with adding one full egg and it came out very nice and moist. They also developed a much nicer flavor the day after. I made this recipe 2x and the second time, I decided to sprinkle about a tablespoon of sugar to my raspberries since they were very tart. The outcome was perfect.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because when I mixed it all up it was more of a cookie dough consistency then a batter.  I decided to add two whole eggs instead of wasting the yolk, vanilla Greek yogurt instead of plain, coconut oil instead of vegetable, doubled the lemon juice and I added 1/2c to 3/4c of milk. With said changes these muffins were delicious and very light. My three year old was asking for seconds right away!

I am  so impressed with this recipe! I followed the ingredient ratios perfectly and didn't make too many changes. It cooked perfectly. Super moist (not dense at all) and packed with lemony flavor. The local convenience store near me didn't have plain yogurt so I opted for peach yogurt and added a little bit of  vanilla  extract instead of lemon extract. I love that there isn't a lot of butter and sugar. I will definitely make this again and experiment with different kinds of fruits in the future. This is definitely going to become a household staple. :)

Like others, found the muffin far too dense and flavors too muted when I carefully followed the base recipe.

I'm not much of a baker so was worried how it'd turn out but these muffins turned out great! As I saw another reviewer mention, I used one whole egg instead of two egg whites. Also, I didn't have baking powder so I used baking soda. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and it turned out really good. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The dough seemed very thick so I added appx. 1/2 water and 1/3 cup of milk. Also I added 21/2 cups of raspberrries, used greek yougurt and added 2x the lemon juice asked for. Added add sugar to mix not on top. Maybe too many raspberries as they are tart and the muffins are less sweet and lemony. But overall they are yummy, need the sugar topping though. Will work with this recipe some more!

Quite tasty.  I was looking forward to a more intense lemon flavor, though.  I did not have lemon extract on hand, so will try it with that addition next time.

I think these were pretty flavorless tasted like dough and not much else. Sad because they sounded so good I made a double batch! And no one will eat them.

Loved it!!!  I made these earlier this week and they went fast!  I ended up having to make them again today.  They are very simple,  delicious and moist.  Changes I made: I used 2 whole eggs,  no lemon zest,  no lemon extract and no sugar on top of muffins.  I used fresh raspberries and about 1 1/2tablespoon lemon juice (when the lemons were ripe on the tree,  I froze fresh lemon juice into an ice tray,  so I used an ice cube size lemon juice!).  This recipe is so delicious,  I'm be making them again!

The batter came out far to dry and crumbly. I added about 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of yogurt to bring it to a batter consistency.  Turned out great otherwise.

The batter for these muffins was more like a bread dough. I followed the directions, but ended up with a muffin that although the toothpick came away clean, were still doughy on the bottom even after cooking for an extended amount of time. The top however was ok and had a nice flavour. Would not try them again.

This was okay but I was mistakenly using it for a cranberry muffin recipe. All in all not a bad recipe but I was looking for a cranberry muffin recipe. I think any good muffin recipe should allow for many substitutions as far as the fruit you use goes and it was good but not great for my purposes. Crowns weer not as good as pictures either and that was one of the things I was looking for. So okay recipe but now worth the effort.

As others noted, the dough is very, very thick.  I used the Lemon Choban greek yogurt to get the muffins more flavor (the whole container - 5.3 ounces) and 1/4 cup more lemon juice than the recipe called for because of the dough being so thick.  I didn't see the recommendation for the crumb topping but that certainly would be a better addition than the plain sugar.  This is the second time I've made this - the first time with frozen raspberries and now with blueberries.  Both complement the lemon muffin very nicely and I'd recommend the recipe with some minor revisions.

These are really good. I didn't have any lemon zest, but I did use lemon extract. The lemon flavor was not very strong, probably because of the missing zest. I used fresh raspberries that I froze first. Due to the altitude here I added one whole egg and 2 tbs flour, and baked them at 425. The muffins came out very moist and fluffy, with great flavor. I will definitely make them again.
I gave four stars because they are great, but not "blow me away great".

These are awesome! I had some "ugly" strawberries (fresh) to eat up and so used those instead of raspberries. Also used plain Greek yogurt and added a 1/4 cup+ of milk because the yogurt dried the batter. Didn't have coconut oil so used vegetable. They are so light, fresh and fluffy! Can't wait to try with lots of seasonal and frozen fruit. Great healthy versatile recipe!

This only made 9 muffins for me. I altered the recipe a bit .  Used  lime instead of lemon juice. Used a whole half of a lime.  Half whole wheat flour. 6oz of Greek vanilla yogurt. Added 1 splash milk to thin the batter. No zest plus vanilla extract. White chocolate chunks. SO GOOD!

Good flavor, but I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because I thought the texture was rather heavy.  I followed the recipe exactly except substituted blueberries instead of raspberries.  I baked them for 17 minutes, which I have to do because of our high altitude (4500 ft), and when the skewer came out clean, I took them out.  The lemon flavor is very good, and they are a pretty muffin, but a bit heavy to the point of almost being gummy.  I was careful not to overmix as I know that will destroy the lightness and texture, so I'm not sure why they were not light and fluffy.  Still, I will probably try them again and perhaps reduce the oil and yogurt a bit.

Clearly, I must have done SOMETHING wrong.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt and a whole egg instead of egg whites.  I juiced a lemon instead of using bottled lemon juice.  These muffins are dense, and a big disappointment.  The muffins are stuck to the wrapper and are all around a big two THUMBS DOWN. :(

Made these with blueberries, no lemon extract, and replaced some of the oil with extra lemon juice and a bit of almond milk.  I didn't have 1/2c of plain yogurt so I used a mixture of plain Greek yogurt and sour cream.  Great flavor and texture.

I made these with fresh raspberries, a mixture of half vanilla yogurt and half non-fat Greek yogurt, and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. I sprinkled the tops generously with turbinado sugar. While the mix was very thick the muffins turned out wonderful!  Even tastier with a little lemon curd.

I tried this recipe for the first time today and my husband and I both loved it.  I typically make a recipe exactly according to the directions the first time but this time I did adjust a tiny bit. 
I used a tiny bit more salt (just didn't level the 1/4 teaspoon) because a lot of muffins seem bland to me.  I added a few drops of vanilla (about a half cap)and used 3 tablespoons of fresh Meyer lemon juice and the zest from 2 lemons (probably 2 teaspoons)and did not use the lemon extract. I used 1 1/2 cups fresh raspberries. Sprinkled the tops with two small packets of turbino sugar before baking which added a nice glistening topping.

They were really good! I loved the density and that they were not too sweet. My husband ate 5 the first night (they are small even though the muffin cups are full). Twelve muffins baked perfectly in 16 minutes. 

The paper liners were a little tough to peel off but didn't ruin the muffins. I will look for some suggestions to correct that.

Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing Kathy.

Delicious taste. The texture of my muffins was somewhat dense and more moist than I would like. Possibly because I added a whole egg instead of two egg whites. The flavor was very good though. I topped with chocolate drizzle because I love raspberries with chocolate.

Clearly I must have done something wrong.  I followed the recipe except I did not have lemon extract. The batter was way, way, WAY too thick. Then after baking, the muffins stuck like glue to the liners.

I made half of them with the cinnamon/flour/butter topping suggested by another reviewer and half of them with no topping at all. Next time I think I'll get some coarse ground sugar to sprinkle on top and that extra bit of sweet crunch will make them perfect.

A few substitutions:
I used
greek yogurt
 1/2cup oat flour
1/2 cup wheat flour
1/2 cup regular flour
1/2 cup sugar
I used mixed berries- just rasp would be better
Very thick batter!  Came out almost scone like, def more dense than regular muffins but great flavor.  I would recommend using the lemon extract as they barely tasted like lemon and I doubled the zest, too

Don't let the "dough" throw you off. These are good muffins and very tasty. The only substitute I did was use a whole egg instead of just egg whites. Instead of muffin batter I ended up with dough that made 12 mini muffins (there is no way this recipe can make 12 regular sized muffins). I baked them at 400 for 17 minutes but because they are so dense they still weren't done so I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for another 10 minutes. Still moist, just very dense. I would make these again.

A really fresh, fruity flavor! I love the combination of the sweetness and the lemon. I think they are great in summer, to bring to a garden party or a birthday! I had to add some milk to the dough because otherwise it would be way to heavy and dry and some split almonds on top. This recipe is really a keeper and even my lovely hubby, who really not goes crazy about muffins, loves them!

The muffins by themselves aren't that tasty. I agree with what other people have said in that there simply isn't enough lemon flavor. In addition, they didn't rise very much, so don't be afraid to fill the muffin tin to the top. They are also pretty dense and not fluffy like some muffins, so be aware of that as well. Some things I did to boost the flavor: I used lemon yogurt instead of plain (Yoplait makes a good one with no fruit on the bottom). I added something that really kicked up the flavor (and calorie content) - I added a lemon icing to the top. It REALLY complemented the berry flavor, and providing a sweet, yet tart kick. I highly suggest adding this for flavor. If you search "lemon icing" there is a highly rated recipe by a woman named Carol - that's the one I used. Very very good.

These muffins turned out amazing. They are a bit dense, but they are so delicious that I certainly did not mind. After reading the reviews, I think next time I will be adding a bit of milk, increase the lemon to 3 tablespoons as opposed to 1, and certainly add 1/2 cup of extra raspberries. I used fresh raspberries that I froze [Way better and tangy than buying "smushi" frozen raspberries]. I will make these regularly.

I have made this recipe over and over again and absolutely love it! The only changes I make are to use one whole egg instead of 2 egg whites and to substitute lemon extract with more lemon juice. (The original recipe actually tastes the best, but I prefer not to waste the egg yolks.) I have also tried whole wheat flour and they are still good, but taste more like cobbler than muffins.

Delicious! I subbed half of the oil for applesauce and used raspberry greek yogurt.  Used blueberries as I'm the only raspberry lover around here.  I went for 3T of lemon juice because we have Meyer lemons and the more lemon, the better! They were a healthy hit with everyone! Last time I made them I tripled the recipe and froze a bunch--they freeze and defrost well.  :)

I just made these (am eating now ;) ) I didn't have plain yogurt so I used some sour cream and vanilla yogurt. I'm sure plain yogurt would be good too. I used one egg, not two egg whites. The batter was too thick so I added a splash of milk and oil, and baked them for 19 mins. They are great! Big hit. :) Thank you for the recipe.

My raspberries were bad, so I used diced canned peaches. What an experiment! Before I threw in the peaches, I tasted the batter. It seemed PLENTY lemon tasting WITHOUT the zest, but good. After I threw in the peaches, the batter tasted weird. I went ahead and baked it and they turned out alright! Very airy/light and moist. I might drain the peaches better next time. And I might try a different fruit. I think any fruit would probably do fine in this one. I also omitted the sugar on top. It was plenty sweet without it.

These were good.  I thought they could have been sweeter.  I used fresh lemons off of my tree and raspberries we went and picked ourselves.  That was fun.  My 4 year old did not like them.

Just tried these today and my daughter, husband and brother all approve.  I did add extra lemon zest, juice and grated in some lemon peel because we like extra lemon flavor. I also added a couple tablespoons of milk because the batter was pretty thick.  I could have added more; these are a dense muffin.  Not a problrm for us though. I will make these again.

Use foil liners - never sticks! Used Chobani lemon greek yogurt, an egg instead of 2 whites, no extract, blueberries instead of raspberries, and a tad of zest -- turns out a not so fresh lemon doesn't zest well. Batter was like cookie dough, but they turned out delicious anyway. I wanted that sugar crunch so next time I'll top 'em. Waaaaaaay better than any box muffins! My kids inhaled these.

I gave these muffins a try yesterday.  I followed the ingredients of the recipe pretty much as they were with the singular modification of using lemon greek yogurt instead of plain.  The result was a very nice flavor.  However, the texture is a little tough.  But I will say that I did not follow the recipe completely.  Without realizing what the recipe said precisely, I added the sugar to the wet ingredients like one would normally.  When I combined the wet and dry, the batter locked up completely (I didn't over-stir; it was pretty much screwed from the get-go).  My batter turned out like a wet sort of cookie dough even before it was even sort of mixed -- never mind folding in the berries.  I do not know if it would have been fixed by more precisely following the instructions (adding sugar to flour, it doesn't make much sense), but there you go.
I guess what I'm saying here is that it would be unfair to give this recipe a low rating if I didn't follow it precisely as given.  They do taste very good.  Just be careful.

I'm so bummed I wasted a huge batch of "batter" trying to make these muffins- the batter came out more like a dough, it was sooo thick. I added 1-2 cups of milk and also about 2 cups of orange juice and it was STILL really thick. When they finished baking they were hard and gummy- I have NEVER come across this problem. Tried lowering the temp and cooking longer, still no luck. Also, along with the 2 cups orange juice i added a huge amount of orange zest and guess what... you couldn't taste any orange at ALL! this recipe was a total flop for me, sorry.

I'd luckily read through the reviews before hand and so added a bit more yogurt and a little milk so that I could more easily fill the muffin cups. However it was still pretty thick...even though I'd listened to others and added three tbsp of lemon juice instead of one! Maybe it was thick because I'd used plain Greek yogurt? But then others had used regular yogurt and still had this problem. Anyway I'd followed the recipe other than that, added the zest, and they were nice and lemony, and really liked the flavor with the frozen raspberries.  I would make them again, and next time use lemon yogurt, the reg. kind this time. The other thing I noticed (as someone else mentioned) was that the muffins stuck to the paper muffin cups, but unlike their experience, they were still stuck fast even after they cooled. Half the muffin was left inside the paper! 
I wish I knew if it was something I did, or partly due to ingredients used or what? Despite all this they were tasty!

Was great with my frozen feild fruits. Was hard to mix at the end so I added a bit more milk 3-4 tbl spoons. Good hit at home & work.

It was really yummy! I had to use lime juice & zest instead of lemon and it turned out really good still. I still added the lemon extract though. I made a bread loaf and it cooked faster than my banana bread recipe. Maybe next time I would add more raspberries. Yum!

I made these muffins using 2T. butter + 1T apple sauce, plain yogurt, juice and zest from 1 lemon and a splash of vanilla. Since I didn't make the recipe as written, it isn't fair to give it a bad review. However, these were not very good. I didn't have oil in the house, so I used butter thinking it would be ok. NOT! The muffins taste like greasy butter and they are hardly edible. They did not rise and were weird and flat. I guess oil is really a non-negotiable in this case. Perhaps I could have replaced all the oil with applesauce, but I didn't want them to be rubbery. I will try them with the oil next time and see if they are any better.

These muffins are amazing! I did not have lemon extract on hand, so I used lemon juice and doubled the amount.  I did not use the sugar on top, and substituted apple sauce for yogurt.  They turned out great!

I don't normally post negative reviews- but this recipe calls for it. I have no clue how people rated it so high. They were bland, dense, and didn't rise at all. I bake often, I know it wasn't my execution. They are like hard little rocks with berries in them. I ate one and threw the rest out. I would not ever make this again.

I used a 6 oz container of lemon yogurt, plus just squeezed the whole lemon so more than 1 T in mine. Maybe the density problem could be solved for some with the addition of 1/2 tsp baking soda. It might counterbalance the acid in the recipe and give more of a rise to the muffin. Better than my cooking light recipe - close to the ingredients though.

Wonderful muffins.  I used berry yogurt & frozen mixed berries.  Next time I might even add a 1/2 tsp. more zest.

These are really good but I do agree with others that they need a bit more lemon or flavor of some sort added to them as they can be a bit bland.

When asked about this recipe, the boyfriend says its rating should be tasty or delicious but not mouth orgasm...I can't translate this into a star system very well, so I am giving it a 5 anyway. I took another reviewer's advice and tripled the lemon juice (didn't have extract or zest). I doubled the recipe but it only made 21 muffins. The bottoms of these got pretty dark on the second from top rack in my tiny oven, so be careful with that. They are very tasty and I shouldn't admit it... but both of us have almost eaten all 21 in one day...

I have made this several times now with fresh raspberries and no lemon extract. Use low-fat yogurt rather than fat-free. Rinse and drain the berries but don't dry them. Don't over mix when adding dry to wet ingredients. But then mix well when adding berries to break them up a bit. Get the the batter evenly pink. Just a touch of sugar on top of each balances the sweet and tart. I freeze these in small batches so I can defrost for quick *healthy* breakfast for the kids and me.

These were good. Really moist muffins- drawback is that you can't eat them warm, they fall apart, you have to wait till they've cooled completely. I used the juice of 1 lemon, added some extra raspberries and some white chocolate chips.

These were too dry for my liking. I had to add a little more milk and oil just because it remained in powder form still (from the flour). I didn't want to add too much and destroy the original recipe though. I didn't add the zest, but used the extract and dh said that the lemon overpowered the raspberries. Overall, I wouldn't make again, simply because these were far too dry.

These were really good and not too sweet, which I really like!  I added either blackberries or raspberries to the top of a couple muffins and they look fabulous!  A few of mine were not cooked all the way, even though I left them in for 15 minutes... however, I ate them anyway! I calculated and they are 4 weight watchers points each!!  A perfect breakfast!

These are great.  I followed the recipe exactally and put in the optional lemon extract.  I sprinkled the sugar on half of them, and that seemed to even out the tartness.  I will make them again as is!

Very good indeed, but a little too citrusy for me.  I replaced the lemon extract with vanilla extract and removed the lemon zest altogether.  I also used fresh strawberries instead of raspberries.  The yogurt gives it a delightful flavor and prefer using only egg whites instead of whole eggs.

These muffins were great!  I don't really care for rasberries but these muffins were sooo good.  Rasberry and lemon go together perfectly.  Lemons were really expensive so I used bottled lemon juice, no lemon zest, and 1 tsp lemon extract.  I followed suggestions of others and used rasberry yogurt instead of plain, plus used 3 cups fresh rasberries.

So, I made this and used mild instead of half and half, used seedless raspberry jam, used more extract and made it in a loaf pan...just tasty! I also made one with the frozen raspberries, but I just didn't like the sourness of them...just stick with the jam!

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of two minor changes:  Instead of using lemon extract and plain yogurt, I just used yoplait lemon custard yogurt, and I used fresh blueberries instead of raspberries.  Lemon juice from the bottle works fine.  I also recommend only baking them for 15 min - I checked at 13 minutes, and they still had a little way to go, checked again at 16 minutes and they were slightly overdone. I love that this is something you can mix without an electric mixer, and that in the end you only have two bowls to clean (I used paper linings in the muffin tray, so I only had to rinse that off after it was done).

These muffins had a nice flavor, but the texture was a bit chewy, as is typical of reduced-fat baked goods.  Although some reviewers seemed turned off by the light color (no egg yolks), I thought the muffins looked appealing.

These are okay, but not great. I really like the lemon flavor, but I didn't care for the raspberry pairing. I may try blackberries next time instead.

Very tasty for a lower fat recipe.  I did use a whole egg in place of 2 egg whites so they would be denser.  I opted to use lemon yogurt instead of plain and blueberries instead of rasperries (personal preference). Next time I would really like to substitute applesauce for the oil to really cut the fat.  I didn't bother with the sugar on the tops because I didn't feel they needed it. The best part is the kids really loved.  They will make a good healthy snack for school.

I tripled the recipe.  used 1 whole egg for two whites and fresh strawberries instead of raspberries.  I also used 3 tbsp of lemon juice instead of one.  turned out very lemony.  the muffins are very light and yummy. I was quite generous with the strawberry portion. I ended up with 42 muffins.

muffins were very dry and not sweet enough.  They still tasted a lot like flour.

I made this as a quick breakfast for my family and they asked me to make it again as soon as the last muffin was gone. The only thing I did different was omit the sugar on top as my husband doesn't like things too sweet. Thank you for this one. It is a keeper.

These were okay, but I made a few alterations.  Instead of yogurt, I used coconut milk, diluted.  The whole wheat pastry flour may have been too much.  Needed more lemon juice, and alot less sugar.  Blueberries worked great and kept them moist.

I made this recipe with fresh raspberries  -I needed to use them up before they went bad and raspberry organic yogurt.  I used colored red sugar on top so that  my kids would eat them too!  Good muffins -I agree with an earlier poster about the color - they tend to stay light in color making you doubt they're finished but they got brown at the edges and the toothpick came out clean!

These were just what I wanted. They were lemony(I added the zest of a whole lemon). I also used fresh raspberries(probably too many, as they wanted to fall a part).
Will make again with fresh or frozen berries, thanks :)

I followed this recipe pretty closely - only changes I made were to use a whole egg rather than two whites, and an extra tablespoon of lemon juice in place of the lemon zest and extract, neither of which I had.  Maybe it was because of the substitution, but I couldn't taste much lemon, even with a lemon-powder sugar glaze.  The texture of the muffins was a little odd.  Overall I wasn't very impressed.  They weren't bad, but I won't make them again.

These are tasty, though not quite 5-star amazing.  I used plain yogurt and didn't even put in the lemon extract, but I thought the lemon was strong enough--just a light lemon flavor to compliment the raspberries.

really nice recipe. unfortunately i didn't have ANY lemon juice, but used assorted frozen fruits and 1 whole egg instead of just whites. For a little exrta flavour, I added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg...SO good! The sprinkle of sugar on top was great. my boyfreind really liked them too!

These muffins were so so. Batter was bland. I love raspberries, so I enjoyed that part. They were also very pale in colour even when fully baked.

Mmm! These were lovely! I used the full egg instead of just the white, and definately sprinkled sugar on top. It adds a nice touch. They took much longer than 15 minutes to bake for me, but that could just be my oven. I used an easy-release icecream scoop to spoon these out so they were all the same size. Turned out really nice!

Very good.  I liked them even better the next day.  Did not have plain yogurt so I used vanilla instead.  Nice lemony taste if you use all the lemon ingredients in the recipe.

ok. I used frozen blackberries, which must have been larger, because they took much longer to bake. Also, the berries were very, very sour. The muffins weren't very lemony, and had a sort of rubbery texture. All in all, they were ok, and I will definitely try them again.

I was a bit disappointed in these (debated between three and four stars).

I used 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract instead of using lemon zest.  The lemon flavor was good.  But I had to add a fair amount of milk to make it the right consistency for muffin batter.  My high altitude had something to do with it, but it was VERY dry.  I also used an egg substitute (Ener-G) as my daughter is allergic.

All in all, they turned out well (my two little girls LOVE them), and I will probably make them again.  They just aren't my first choice.

Serve them hot out of the oven and the rasberries
burst with flavor! I used more lemon juice and no
zest. I had some granulated brown sugar that I 
sprinkled on top and it gave a little browned 
impression. If you used more they might appear
golden instead of pasty looking.

These muffins were really great adn LOW FAT!!!  I used raspberry yogurt, lemon zest from the whole lemon, and a smidge more of the lemon extract for a more intense flavor.  I doubled the recipe and I think the extra mixing required made the muffins a little heavier than they should have been.
