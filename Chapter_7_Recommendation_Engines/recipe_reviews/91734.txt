I thought this was extremely easy to make.  Good flavor, althought I overheard someone say that it was too sweet.  I would make it again.

If you want just a simple, fail-proof creamy fudge, this is it! And because it's so simple, you can get creative! Add coconut instead of the peanutbutter chips, or nuts, etc. One tip if it's your first time, get the cond. milk and vanilla in the saucepan first, let it get hot, and then add the choc chips so the choc melts quickly and doesn't clump up.

This fudge is very good.  But if you are looking for a strong peanut butter flavor you won't find it here.  Its very subtle.

This was my first time ever making Fudge, and i don't know why i've been so afraid of it.  This was the easiest recipe, and the Fudge was very good.  I used Carnation Sweetened milk cause that's what i had on hand and I thought it was just great.  Will make this more often, now that I know I can do it haha.

This was a huge hit at Christmas on my cookie tray.  I also add just a dash of salt to the mixture to help bring out the flavors.

I didn't know what to think after reading the reviews but I thought I'd try this anyway.  I love peanut butter so I said "what the heck" and put the whole package in and it didn't have any effect on the outcome of the fudge.  It did give it more of a peanuty flavor and that was what I was going for.  I stirred the package in while still on the burner because I didn't want chips in the fudge.  I did take it off the burner and completed the stirring.  It ended up with swirls of  peanut butter.  All in all it turned out very good.  I will make this again.

EASY, QUICK, AND YUMMY TOO!  My only disappointment was the chips appeared brittle when the fudge was cut.  I used Reese's Peanut Butter chips that I know were fresh.  I do believe the brittle look was due to refrigeration during the 2 hour chilling.  Anyway, they were a nice addition to my fudge assortment tins.  Thank you Eagle Brand for sharing your recipe!

made this for the first time... very easy, but very sweet.  I would add a pinch of salt as suggested by another person to level out the sweetness.  I added toffee chips instead of peanut butter ones - that may have put it overboard on the sweetness scale but either way was still very good!

So quick and easy. I used 1 1/2 c PB chips and they do melt as you stir them in.  For the ease of the recipe, gets a 5.

This fudge is very easy and yummy. It had a very nice, creamy texture. The peanut butter taste is there, but it's subtle, so if you really love PB, I would double the chips. Still delicious as written, though.

Fantastic! Easy to make and very yummy, though you may want to enlist the help of a partner because if you're not a bodybuilder, it gets tiring.  It also makes a surprising amount.

I've never made fudge before so this was my very first time. This was so simple. It's a little sweet but it seemed dry to me. I'll try it again and see if it's better next time.

I give it three stars because it was pretty good, but it's not very creamy for fudge. It was kind of hard. Plus, I felt that the chips in it were just a waste of time. You couldn't even taste them.

I followed the recipe exact, only throwing in a generous amount of chopped salted peanuts. The boys liked this fudge but were honestly hoping for something more peanut buttery. This fudge is a harder fudge, not as creamy as I was hoping for. That's not a reflection on the recipe, just a personal observation.

So simple, yet so deliciously rich and sweet but with a little saltiness from the peanut butter chips. Just what I needed to satisfy my fudge craving. Everyone keeps asking me to make it again!

Loved this fudge, and it was so simple to make.  Most of the peanut butter chips began to melt into the chocolate when stirring, so I added some additional chips on top of the fudge.  The flavor combination was delicious, and I know this one will be made again soon.

This recipe was very easy to make, but it really just tasted like chocolate.  Didn't have that real fudge taste I was looking for.  I did use 2 cups of peanut butter chips, which added more of a peanut flavor...overall decent recipe.

Super easy.  Like others I added a dash of salt.  After melting the chocolate chips, I turned the heat off but kept the pot on the burner and added the peanut butter chips so they could melt a little bit but not totally.  Plan to try again with other chip flavors.

Not bad.  I'll make it again simply because it was quick.  I added the whole bag of peanut butter chips for more PB flavor.

I made this for Christmas. It was extremely easy to make and a big hit with my family. I did substitute the butter chips for regular creamy peanut butter and it was delicious.

I loved making these, but I used 2 cups of mint, and 1 cup of semi sweet to change it up a bit. Still tasted really really good :D

While it was really easy to make, it was too "thick" for my liking.  Also, it's too "dark chocolate" for me but I knew I should've used milk chocolate morsels but followed the recipe anyway.  I'm craving Mackinaw Island Fudge but can't travel to get it.  I was hoping this recipe was like it, but it's not, so I'll keep trying.  (grin).  It is a quick and easy recipe, though.
