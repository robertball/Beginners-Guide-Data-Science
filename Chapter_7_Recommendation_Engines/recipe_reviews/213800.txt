Huge hit!  I did change one thing - I whipped my own whipping cream instead of using Cool Whip.  I just couldn't bring myself to use Cool Whip when it's so easy to make the real thing.

Absolutely fabulous! I didnt even have a springform pan, I made it in a pie plate and it worked out fine. I would make this again.  The blueberrys are so contrasting. Did I mention that this recipe ROCKS?

What an amazingly yummy cheesecake!! The only change to the recipe that i applied was to double the crust ingredients and added some super fine chopped walnuts to the crust as well. That nutty crust was awesome with the super vanilla flavor of the cheesecake. :)

My husband requested this for his birthday. This was only the second time that I have made a homemade cheesecake and it turned out heavenly. My hubby took the leftovers into work the next day and one of his co-workers said it was so good, that it was better than the "Cheesecake Factory" cheesecake. What a compliment!!!

Very good! This was my first time making an actual cheesecake. I used Keebler Vanilla Wafers since they were on sale, 1/3 less fat Philly, a little more vanilla than it calls for, and only 2 eggs because I accidentally looked at the other recipe I was mixing at the same time! I actually LOVED the consistency that it gave it though so I may just stick to doing that from now on!  The only thing I wasnt crazy about was the second layer on top. There was just too much! I think if you halved that amount it would be soo much better. Overall though it was a hit with our friends!  *Making this tomorrow (minus the top layer all together since I just realized I forgot Cool Whip!) and putting out a DIY topping bar. Crumbled Oreos/hot fudge and apple pie filling/caramel...Cant wait!*

Made this for our Christmas dessert and it was amazing!  Everyone loved this, my husband told me I better remember what I did to make that because he loved it, and he usually picks the crust off and actually complimented me on how great the crust was.  I followed the recipe, except for the crust I used 4 tablespoons melted butter.

I did not care for this version of cheesecake at all.  It's not the rich, thick, dense style of NewYork Cheesecake, that's for sure.

Rarely do I make a recipe that turns out looking just like the picture.  This cheesecake turned out perfectly.  Another plus - it's absolutely delicious.  I made a graham crust because I didn't have any Nilla wafers.  For the filling, I used 2 packages of reduced fat cream cheese and 1 package non-fat.  For the topping, I used reduced fat cream cheese and light cool whip.  Even though the top doesn't show, it did not crack at all.  I baked it for 55 minutes, then opened the oven door and left it in for about 2 hours.  I then spread on the topping and refrigerated for the given 4 hours.  There's only 5 of us, and it is almost already gone.

This cheese cake is amazing!Made it for Valentines Day and my husband who doesn't like cheese cakes tried it and just couldnt stop eating it:)...I have to confess I did cheat a bitt. I didn't have a CC pan so i used a disposable pie pan instead and i was lucky enough to find one with the crust already in it:) It worked just fine.And put strawberrys instead of blueberrys. At the end I used scissors to cut the pan off and served in dish. I left a picture above if you want to see it:) Once again please do try it

Made it for my dad for Fathers Day and he loved it. Couldnt believe it was homemade. I think this is a very forgiving recipe because even if it cracks in the oven you're going to cover it with the topping anyway. Also not too many ingredients make it affordable too.

Look so good and would just love to make it for the family. However, I am in Denmark and I cannot get hold of eny COOL WHIP whipped topping here. Have some Bird's topping ( english powder that I have to mix with milk) - but will I be able to substitute it - or does anybody know what I can use instead of the whipped topping????

This is an excellent recipe for cheesecake that even a first time cheesecake maker can make successfully.  I topped mine with a singel layer of blueberries with a simple glaze. It was a hit, and there were absolutely NO leftovers! *** Made it again and topped it with red raspberries... made a lovely presentation.

Tasted like it was from a restaurant! I had to improvise on some of the amounts since I wanted to make smaller version and it still turned out heavenly! I followed someone else's suggestion of using real whipping cream instead of cool whip and it was fabulous - EVERYONE asked for seconds!

The cheesecake was good, but I wasn't crazy about the fluffy topping... I think I would prefer a sour cream type. I did not do the cookie crust, I did a graham cracker crust which is delish. It is just crackers, butter, sugar and cinnamon.

Excellent cheesecake recipe! I definitely received lots of compliments and requests to make it again. I followed the recipe, however substituted crushed white oreos for the crust instead of NILLA wafers and served it with fresh blueberries...yum!

I made this as is, but next time I make it I'll use a graham cracker crust instead. Seemed like the Nilla wafers got soggy. I'll also make whipped cream from scratch. The cool whip was good for a shortcut, but I'd rather have the real thing!

maybe I overbaked it, but I was hoping for a more creamy bottom layer.  Wasn't crazy about the nilla wafer crust either.

Such a pretty end result!  Tasted great too.  This was really great, and really easy! Don't open the oven while the cheesecake is baking and don't over bake.  5 stars!

I was SO IMPRESSED with how this cheesecake turned out!!  It was AMAZING.  Perfect amount of each ingredient.  Perfect combination of cheese and vanilla.  The crust turned out perfectly.  Thank you so much for providing such a delicious recipe!  I will make it again and again.

TO DIE FOR!!!  This was my first cheesecake that I made, and I can't believe how amazing it was!  So creamy!! My husband loved it, and I gave some to my parents who also loved it.  Actually my mom told me it was just as good, if not better than hers, which is a huge compliment because she makes an awesome cheesecake.  I will definitely be making this again - soon!

Excellent!  I made this for Easter dessert and my husband totally loved it. It is so easy to make and really elegant. I was pretty proud of myself, to be honest. The cheesecake was creamy and the mousse was light and fluffy. My husband thought a little fresh fruit would be a nice addition. A keeper!

Excellent cheesecake!  Simple and easy....my kind of recipe!!!!  Everybody loved it.  I took the advice of another and left the cheesecake in the oven to cool for 2 hours and then put the topping and place it in the refrigerator.  Delicious!!!  I'm making this for Easter!

This cheesecake is so good.  I skipped the mousse layer and the plain vanilla cheesecake was fantastic!  I used the hints and added some vanilla bean seeds to add to the vanilla flavor.

I baked the cheesecake exactly as the directions said, but I did not have the right pan so I used a normal pie pan. It came out GREAT! My husband was actually glad it was thinner and not as thick- so i am going to keep using the pie pan. i am making this again for a party. it wasn't too sweet, which sometimes cheesecakes can be. i absolutely loved it!!! Winner recipe.

Because of the great reviews, I had to try this recipe for my cheesecake-loving family.  We all thought it was delicious.   The 2 textures make it unique and special.  I followed another's suggestion and put some finely chopped walnuts in the crust which was a nice addition.  I served sweetened fresh strawberries on the side.

Tastes a lot better when you wait the entire 4 hours to refrigerate.  I couldn't wait and took my first bite after 2 and wasn't impressed.  Tasted MUCH better the next day!

Delicious!  I made this to bring to a family gathering, and everyone loved it.  I whipped my own cream (with vanilla and a tiny bit of powdered sugar), since cool whip is too sweet for my taste, and I used a sweet topping anyway:  I spread canned blueberry pie filling instead of fresh berries on the finished dessert.  So yummy!

This is seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had! My husband's grandmother made it for a family event and I was craving it, so I scoured Allrecipes.com and found it! I used graham cracker crust instead of the nilla wafers, and it was wonderful.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have tried! It was amazing! I did make one change. I used a cup of sugar in the filling instead of 3/4 cup that the recipe called for, because the first time I made this cheesecake it wasn't sweet enough for my taste. My family and friends ask for this dessert all of the time. This is a staple in my house. Its definitely a crowd pleaser anytime!

The best cheesecake recipe I have made. My family loved it. Easy to mix up.  I added more vanilla than called for. My daughter wants this again soon.  It was lovely looking when it came out of oven. No cracks at all. I did chill this overnight. I also used parchment paper in the pan. Thanks again

This is one of the recipes that people request often! Even my dad loves this, and he usually hates cheesecake. It's a little lighter version of a cheesecake too. I use an entire stick of butter and full box of Nilla wafers, making a crust that covers the sides of the springform pan as well.

I could not believe the non-stop compliments about how amazing this was when I took it to a 4th of July get together!! I used the spring form pan suggested, and I lined the bottom with parchment and put the ring around it. It made for less cleaning and easy transport. I just slid it off the parchment onto the cake cardboard. Everyone liked the creaminess, of the top layer, and the Nilla wafer crust.

YUM! This is a delicious cheesecake.  Someone commented about the density...it isn't particularly dense, but it's a wonderful consistency.  It's smooth and creamy and still holds its shape well when cut.  I added extra Nilla Wafers to the crust (just basically threw in an extra handful) and used real cream instead of Cool Whip.  Otherwise, everything was the same.  It came out perfectly beautiful.  I cooked it for 50 minutes, then turned off the oven and let it sit with the oven door open 6 inches or so for 10 minutes.  The top didn't crack at all.  This is an easy, delicious dessert!

This was the first at home cheese cake I've ever tried and it's the only one I'll ever make! As per other helpful reviews I try an combine most suggested alterations after trying the recipe the way it supposed to be made. Now this is how my family/friends love it. A little extra vanilla in both layers. I add walnuts to the crust, plus I made the crust a little thicker by adding more wafers. An easy way to get the wafers super fine (because I don't have a lot of kitchen appliances) is to put the wafers in a ziplock, an just use a rolling pin to roll over those cookies. Fast, painless, an easy clean up. I always make my own whipped cream too as I can control exactly how that will taste.
And last, this time I decided to step out my comfort zone and instead of whipped cream w/the vanilla extract in it, I used raspberry extract. And for the top cheesecake mousse layer, instead of vanilla that too was substituted with raspberry.
Hoping for an awesome vanilla raspberry cheesecake topped with chocolate sauce? We'll see!

Delicious! I topped this with fresh raspberries. I've made it twice now, and it was a hit both times! 

Also, the vanilla mousse works as a great fruit dip.

I crushed the Nilla with a pestle and mortar (only way to obtain tiny crumbs), added crushed walnuts to the crust,  a few extra drops of vanilla, and made fresh whipped cream using heavy cream, confectioner's sugar and vanilla.  The end result is fabulous and delightfully delicious! It made me post my first recipe review!

After reading the review that said the crust got soggy I decided to bake the crust for 10 min. before pouring in the filling.  Turned out quite well.

What an amazing recipe!! This is the first cheesecake that I have ever made and it came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly. I love how creamy this recipe is and the mousse is a perfect soft addition to it! I plan on adding vanilla beans to the mousse next time. Was awesome with strawberries OR alone!

I tried making a reduced calorie version of this recipe and it came out surprisingly well.  I was imagining something along the lines of the "Vanilla Bean" cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory, which is VERY sweet and very vanilla-y.  This recipe is not like that - it tastes much more like "original" cheesecake with a bit of sweet vanilla added here and there.

Here's what I did in case anyone wants to try a "diet" version:
- Substituted all sugar with the same amount of granulated Splenda- it works great in cheesecake (vs many other baked goods)
- Used 3 packages of fat free cream cheese and 1 package of "1/3 less fat" / neufchatel cream cheese, all Philadelphia brand.  
- Used 2 fat free and the 1 neufchatel for the base layer.  The fat free cream cheese has a somewhat alarming texture when you take it out of the package (even when "softened" to room temperature), but after creaming it together with the neufchatel and mixing on high for several minutes (before adding the other ingredients) it came together quite nicely and became very creamy.
- Added an extra egg yolk to the base layer.
- Beat the remaining pkg. of fat free cream cheese and combined with "Cool Whip Free" for the top layer.

This took less than 50 minutes to finish, so keep an eye on it.  It certainly wouldn't win a competition against a "real" cheesecake, but sneak someone a slice without admitting its nature and they probably won't guess it's low-fat and -sugar.  It just tastes like a pretty good cheesecake!

Oh my word, what a "cheese"cake! I love the layering of cream cheese. The whipped cream cheese topping is a great compliment to the wonderfully creamy filling. It's an interesting dessert. Other than making my own whipped cream (heavy whipping cream & powdered sugar) everything else was on the mark. I am very pleased with the results, it's one of the best tasting cheesecakes I've come across.

Yummy cheesecake but I would use less cream cheese in the topping... it was too "cheesy" for my taste. But overall, great recipe.

This is SUCH a good recipe! I made my first cheesecake 3 months ago using this recipe. At that time, i had only been baking for about five months or so. For an beginning baker, the cake turned out wonderful! Ive made two of these cheesecakes so far, plain vanilla, and peppermint. Trying my kuck with chocolate today! All in all, I definitely recommend this recipe, even if you are a beginner!

I was only able to find reduced fat Nilla Vanillas. Made the crust dry and we all felt the cheesecake didn't have a lot of flavor. I would prefer the top layer to be half as thick. Made it for a birthday with sprinkles on top. Made it really pretty at least

This is a great tasting cheesecake and so simple to make.  I have made it twice and the second time I cut ingredients in half because there were only two of us.  I did use two eggs but will only use one large one next time.  I also cut the baking time by 9 minutes.  I used one package of Dream Whip topping mix instead of the cool whip which worked perfectly and tasted as good.  I used the a 7"  springform pan.

This turned out just like the picture. The only change I made was to make the crust  one and a half times thicker because it seemed a bit chintzy. I also baked it in a water bath as I always do(using the temperature and time given-50 minutes), turning the oven off and letting it sit with a cracked door for about an hour before setting it on the counter to cool completely- then refrigerating overnight, and it was the perfect consistency-super creamy and smooth from the edge to the middle. I struggled with getting the top layer to spread nicely, and finally I found that the easiest way to get it nice and smooth like in the picture is to use an offset spatula to spread it evenly with a very light hand. The bottom layer is not very sweet, but combined with the sweetness of the top layer it is the perfect amount. I am pretty sure that this recipe will please my friends who do not prefer the heavier cheesecakes. I normally like to make sauces for the tops of my cheesecakes, but since this cheesecake has the lighter top layer, I did not want to cover it up, so I topped it just like the photo with fresh blueberries and they were perfect together. One more positive: it cuts like a dream into beautiful firm pieces.

Made this last week and everyone loved it! This was my first time succesfully making one. I did however didn't  make the top layer because my fiancée ate one package of cream cheese! And i made a cinnamon grahmn cracker crust with just melted butter no sugar addef.despite that it was absolutely delightful. It didn't really need the top layer and I think it might have made it too sweet. I think I might have over cooked it because it cracked and was a bit crumbly (I added 15 mins because I didn't know it kept cooking after taken out) no one cared because it was still creamy and light tasting! I will be making this again soon!

Easy to make and a HUGE hit with whoever is lucky enough to get some! I cut calories and fat without comprising taste one bit by using low fat cream cheese and Splenda instead of sugar.

Huge hit! Kitchen friendly EASY but gourmet taste! I loved the rich whipped topping the best!  I normally prefer a graham cracker crust, but most of the guests stated they preferred the vanilla cookie crust over graham cracker. Even the dieters' plates were empty, as I used all light ingredients and topped it with strawberries. Not your 'cake style' cheesecake, but not too creamy either. Perfect dessert to please a crowd!

This was wonderful. My only complaint is that my boyfriend (a cheesecake fanatic) said that it didn't taste much like cheesecake at all.

Yummy!  I changed it up a bit and made mini cheesecakes!  I pressed the crust mixture into the bottom of lined cupcake pans, then filled each 2/3 way with the filling.  Bake 375 deg. For 25 min.  When cool, top each off with the topping (and fresh berries, if you like).  Great to bring to parties!
