This is truely wonderful! I did add a few extras for my own taste. I used chicken broth in place of water, white pepper, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. sage, nutmeg and cinnamon to taste. I served this soup at a tea and it had everyone asking for more plus the recipe!:)

Surprisingly good! I was a bit apprehensive at first, but it turned well ^^ I did have to subsitute the condensed cream of potato with condensed cream of chicken. I also didn't have any cream, so I added milk instead. 

It's a very thick and hearty soup. Delicious! (think winter soup ^^)

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone wanted seconds!  It's creamy and tasty, especially with extra garlic and potato chunks-- make sure you follow the recipe and use heavy cream, by the way.. thanks =0) So easy to make!

WOW, this recipe is great.  I was looking for a way to use up some canned pumpkin and thought soup would be an unusual choice.  Saw this recipe and thought that it was quick and easy - so I decided to use it.  Mind you, I have only had pumpkin soup once and it was from some gourmet recipe that required fresh pumpkin and a long list of ingredients.  This simple recipe was much better than that one.  I made it exactly as called for and found that it was a wee bit bland, although I could definitely taste the pumkin and only used enough water to get it to the right consistancy.  So as several reviewers suggested, I spiced it up.  I added onion 1 tsp onion powder, 1 Tbs. sugar, 1 Tbs. curry powder - and 2 tsp of a Morrocan spice blend (cumin, paprika, cinnamon, corriander, ginger) I had left over from another recipe.  YUM!  This was total perfection!  Now we like things savory, so that you may want to adjust the amounts, but this is delicious and definitely a keeper.  My cream of potato soup (Campbells) had chunks of potatoes, so I purred it with a stick blender before serving.  Thanks, Katherine, for the wonderfully easy recipe.  There is a bit left over - and it is MINE.

This is so good on a cold fall evening. I decreased the fat content by not adding the butter and using fat free half and half for the cream. Of course I used "Skim" milk too.
I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 2 Tbsp of dark brown sugar.
This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was very easy and was tasty.  I needed something to take it to work for the food day on the 31st. But I did not have time to make anything ahead of time.  So I grabbed the spices from home and bought the rest of the stuff from the store that morning and headed to my office with my crock pot.  I put all the ingredients in the crock pot in front of my co-workers and put it in high till it started to bubble and turned it to low.  They all liked it.  Especially it was so easy.  Thanks.

I like to find easy recipes to involve my little ones in the cooking process. Very easy, and quick clean-up.

Smooth texture, but I added about a cup of more water over teh cooking process, as I did not want it too thick.

Creamy and delicious!

So quick and easy! Used skim milk instead of cream and was still nice and thick and creamy! Had to substitute cream of chicken soup, but still yummy.

Ease of preparation escalates this soup's rating.  It's tasty, too, esp. if nutmeg and sage are added ala Harvest Pumpkin Soup recipe--potatoes in crm of potato soup MUST be blended so no chunks are present--consider substituting some of crm of potato soup and cream with non-fat chicken broth

The snow is falling on this early December morning here in the beautiful countryside of N.J. and I have just finished making this delicious soup for tonights dinner. Needless to say, I had to "taste test" and I know that after my hubby's commute home (and shoveling) he'll be very pleased with this tummy warming soup. Thanks!

I cooked my pumpkin from Halloween ( cut up with a little water in a baking pan covered with tin foil and baked) Scooped out the cooked pumpkin and pureed in a blender with a little chicken broth. Then I followed the recipe.  Used the same spices but, did add more of each for the taste.  I thought it had a bisque like flavor and texture so I added stone crab which I had the night before. Picked out the fresh crab meat from the cracked crab claw's  Oh! My! was this wonderful.  I put some in the freezer and hope it freezes well.  Nice meal with a loaf of warm crusty buttered bread.

Wow. I cannot believe how delicious and easy this soup was! I did not have the cream so I used evaporated milk. I also added crushed walnuts on top.  I will be making this all throughout the season. It was a hit! :)

This was a great base to start with. I loved the cream of potato soup in it. I used fresh pumpkin that I had in the freezer.  I didn't love it so I added a can of pumpkin.  I had to add it little more water.  I liked it thicker though.  I do prefer a little bit of sweetness to anything pumpkin so I added honey and cinnamon.  I just did it to taste.  I also sprinkled some garlic salt in it.  We loved it!!1 it.

I altered the recipe according to jody1's review and it jumped up from rather bland to 5 stars.  I loved the subtle spices.  And it was just as easy.  Add the broth, brown sugar, and spices!

This is an amazingly simple yet satisfying recipe. I brought it to a dinner party of 20 
where everyone brought an entree  it was the only thing that was totally gone at the end of the night.

Made a sample batch before serving for Thanksgiving dinner,liked it and added it to my Thanksgiving day menu.  Thoroughly enjoyed by all, even those who do not like pumpkin.  Will surely make it again, even just for my husband and myself.

This was pretty good. Now, I wouldn't run out and buy the ingredients JUST to make this soup, but for a good soup on a cold night, this is perfect. I used chicken broth instead of water and used fresh garlic and ginger. This is simple and uses ingredients that I keep on hand so we'll be making this one again. Though I'm hoping that we'll be done with cold weather soon!!!

So disappointed in this recipe - bland and canned flavor. Took a ton of spices to semi-rescue this. The potato soup was a major misstep. It totally subdued the pumpkin flavor. We threw most of it out. What a shame.

This was perfect.  I was trying to duplicate a Pumpkin Soup we had in Japan several years ago.  they served it in a flat soup bowl with 1 crouton on top; very elegant. My only changes were substituting lo-sodium chicken broth in place of water, and Lactaid milk in place of cream (which I always do because of an intolerance). It turned out delicious. Exactly the savory flavor I was looking for, nothing like eating Pumpkin Pie Soup. I will double the recipe next time. Oh yes, and I cooked it in the Slow Cooker 4 hours as others had suggested, I believe that melded the flavors nicely. So easy, so good.  Thank you so much.

Loved it! Followed a previous review to make it lower in fat content and it still turned out great. I love pumpkin flavor, and am going to add more pumpkin next time. Even my husband liked it, and he hardly ever considers soup a meal!

A good base for a recipe, but it was a little bland for my taste.  It wasn't pupkin-y enough, so I doubled the pupkin, but instead of adding more cream I added about 1/2 cup vegetable broth.  I also sauteed some mushrooms in butter and more vegetable broth, and threw that in, along with some cumin.  It turned out great!  Will definitely make it again, and play around more with spices and add-ins.

THANK YOU, Katherine! The only change I made  to this recipe was using evaporated milk (like I do in a lot of my soups) instead of cream. Talk about comfort food!!! It looks and tastes like it took so much time to make, but it is so simple. We will enjoy this recipe for years to come - a real keeper!!! Thanks again.

This was a hearty soup and VERY EASY to make. My family liked it more than I did. I couldn't find condensed potato soup and used a Chunky style potato soup w/ roasted garlic. I also used half & half. They ate ALL of the soup (Mom had 2 bowls)! I think if I had the right potato soup, it would have been more "pumpkiny"...like I was expecting. Will try this soup again...great for COLD winter days/nights.

This was very simple to make, but good.  I used 2% milk instead of cream.

This dish tasted very canned to me. I think it was the canned cream of potato soup that put it over the edge. I love Pumpkin soup, but this just did not hit the spot.

My very picky 6 year old called this "Amazing!" - which is amazing in itself!  I didn't have cream, so I used evaporated lowfat milk.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly - until the garnish.  I used gorgonzola cheese and bacon sprinkled on top, as another recipe recommended - wonderful!  A couple of croutons would've been nice as well, but I didn't have them on hand.  As another reviewer said, Campbell's cream of potato has chunks, so the stick blender comes in handy for this soup.  This very easy recipe is a keeper!

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading all the great reviews. Both my husband and I didn't care for it. First I made it exactly like the recipe. I tasted it and thought it was much too "garlicy." So I took the suggestion of a reviewer and added a tsp cinnamon and 2 tbsp brown sugar. This helped somewhat but now it had a weird garlicy sweet flavor.

I doubled this recipe and made it in the crock for my party this weekend. Even people who didn't think they'd like pumpkin soup liked it. They drained the crock! I only got a half serving. I used half water and half chicken broth, omitted the ginger, increased the paprika and pepper and added some chopped garlic. I left the chunks in the potato soup and I think that made it more like from scratch. But no one knew how easy this recipe was except me!

My husband LOVED this, particularly compared to other pumpkin soup recipes I've tried from this website.  I also thought it was good although I'm still searching for the perfect cream of pumpkin soup to replicate some I had a few years ago that was to die for.  I had been initially a little skeptical about the potato soup in this recipe, but it really made it thick.

This was a good soup but I didn't taste much pumpkin.  If I had been blindfolded and given a taste I could not have identified it.  But that didn't stop me from a second helping.

I make this soup often and have made it numerous ways, it's easy and delicious! My first change is that I use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato. The chicken soup just makes the pumpkin flavor "pop" and flourish. I use water as the recipe says but I do use broth to thin the soup if needed. I add 1 tsp  of onion powder, 1 tsp  of pumpkin pie spice, 1 tbs brown sugar (or to taste-don't sweeten too much!) 1/2 tsp cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon and salt to taste. Have fun with this soup, experiment and don't forget that absolutely everything, including this, is better with bacon!

I've tried this a couple ways, all have been hearty & delicious!! My favorite modifications... Swap out Cream of Chicken for Cream of Potato, Vegi or Chicken broth for water & increase to 1cup, evaporated milk for heavy cream & add petite diced tomatoes! I also sprinkled with Smoked Paprika instead of reg, added a "dollop of Daisy"and made Cheesy Garlic Biscuits on the side! There are so many ways to modify this dish, or leave as-is and it is still good!! New family favorite for quick dinner nights...and did I mention healthy?!

It was easy, I'll give it that, but I really wasn't impressed with it. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or I just don't like pumpkin in a soup. Either way I only half-heartedly finished my bowl and still felt hungry after and the boyfriend didn't care for it much either. Ah well.

This was a really great soup! My husband absolutely LOVED it. I wanted it to be a bit sweeter than it was, so I added brown sugar (maybe 1 tbs), cinnamon,  pumpkin pie spice, and 1 tbs sugar. I did not use ginger because I didn't have any. I served this with hot french bread and butter and it was delicious. Perfect for a cool, fall evening. :) Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Not bad, I enjoyed it after I added some curry & nutmeg because it still maintains the canned cream of potato flavor.

This was very simple and taste.  I added whipping cream instead of table cream and used minced garlic instead of powder.  Came out really nice and tasty.

This is a great base for an easy recipe - though I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 2 tbsp dark brown sugar as I'd seen others do and it definitely helped! I couldn't find cream of potato soup so I subbed lowfat butternut squash soup to keep with the fall theme, and the flavors mixed wonderfully - I'm keeping this adjusted recipe on hand!

The recipe is great with a few adjustments.  I use only 1/2 Tablespoon butter and instead of the cream I use 1 cup skim milk.  The cream was much too heavy for my taste and the Skim makes it more healthy too!  This is going to be a great addition to Thanksgiving this year!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I work in a tearoom and we serve it to our customers.  I haven't had a complaint yet.  We are using this soup for the fall.  We serve it with warm bread.  
It will be on my Thanksgiving menu.  Thanks for the recipe.

If the recipe is followed exactly, I think the soup comes out a little bland. I added more pumpkin, more garlic and nutmeg. It's a very hearty soup--I served it with crusty sourdough and it was a meal in itself.

I made this recipe for an early Mother's Day dinner  . It came out great ! My step mother is a " Foodie " . She had her own catering business and really appreciates a good recipe  . Everyone raved how good it was . It was as good as it was simple to make . It will become one of my go to recipes . I'm going to make it from scratch when pumpkins come in season .

Thanks for the recipe.  I refer to it as one of my "Making Something From Nothing" meals.  Substituted milk for the cream, chicken broth for the water, upped the ginger, added a generous pinch of nutmeg, and served it garnished with crushed bacon that was leftover from breakfast.  The end result was tasty and satisfying.  I'll make it again.

My husband thought this was amazing and called it pumpkin pie soup!  I did like it as well, just not as much as him!  I added 2 Tbsp brown sugar, as well as 1/2 tsp each of cumin, sage, and cinnamon.  Also used chicken broth instead of water.  I do recommend using heavy cream for the most creamy soup.  Very nice on a cold winter evening!

This is an easy and very tasty recipe. Made a few changes. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and half/half instead of cream.  I warmed this on the stove and then put it in the crockpot for a few hours.The chicken broth seemed to make it a little salty so I added a mixture of cinnamon/sugar to it and discovered that it is the secret ingredient that took this soup to the next level.

This soup is easy and awesome! My only changes were that I used roasted butternut squash and low fat milk. I served it with crusty French bread that I warmed in the oven and a green salad. My husband licked the bowl!

This was easy and tasty, but pretty bland as is. I don't think it had enough spices in it to really bring out the pumpkin-ness. I would add a lot more garlic, more paprika, white pepper, allspice, and probably whatever else I had laying around. A good base recipe, but be prepared to experiment.

i like the concept of this recipe and how easy it is.  however, i like a sweeter/spicier flavor in my soup, so i used chicken broth instead of water and the following spices: brown sugar, cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg.  it was easy to make and very satisfying!

Instead of creamed potato soup, I drained/added can of diced potatoes. Best of all, I browned 1/2 lb. sausage with some chopped onions, stirred that in with fat-free half/half, and instead of ginger, added a pinch of cayenne. Oh, I reduced water to 3/4 cup.  YUM!

Since 2004 this has been my favorite thing to make. After traveling to a friends house in ireland that made us a similar soup with zuccini I was inspired to find  a soup i could make. Having pumpkin on hand I feel apon this recipe and was in love with it. I added cayane pepper to it to give it a kick and this year used roasted garlic and potato soup. It is great for rainy cold days and a knock out at gatherings. I have only about 6 things I know how to cook and this is one of them. Hubby is the cook. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This soup was so easy and delicious... I took the advice of some reviewers and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon (1 tsp seemed like a lot), 2 tbsp brown sugar. I also omitted the butter and used half-and-half instead of the cream to make it a bit lighter but not sacrifice taste. My husband loves it!

I thought this tasted a little more like potato than pumpkin, but it was still great.  I'll definetly make it again.  I used fat free half and half instead of cream, but the consistency was still creamy.  I also added a little nutmeg and used less salt.

I was looking for a recipe that tasted like the one I had on a cruise over the summer.  My husband liked it but we both felt like it needed a little something else.  Very thick which I like but a little too pumpkiny for my taste.  I can try to rework it but I'm not sure what to do with it yet.

Was not impressed with this one.  It was nice & creamy, but the flavor was bland.  "Edible but not exciting" was my husband's opinion.

This soup was wonderful!  Every time I have someone over for lunch I make it and the recipe is always asked for.  Everyone raves over it.  It is also so incredibly easy.
