2.8.16   Uunfortunately, it didn't emulsify into a mayonnaise.  The taste was OK, but it ended up more like a thin sauce, so we used it for dipping our egg rolls.  I'm not yet experienced with my Vitamix blender, so it could be that the speed was too high, and mayo broke?    I don't want to discourage others from trying; this simply didn't work for me.
