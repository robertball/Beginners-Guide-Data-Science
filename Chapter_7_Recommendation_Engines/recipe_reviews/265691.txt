I left the oil out of the batter.  I heat the cast iron in oven then move the pan to stove, add olive oil (which should be shimmering) pour batter.  Leave on stove medium flame until the bottom is firm and begins to brown.  Then place pan under broiler until the top is fully cooked, firm and crispy brown.  Sometimes I add caramelized onions to batter, parmesan cheese, dried herbs, whatever strikes my fancy.
