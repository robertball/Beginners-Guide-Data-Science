This was a good recipe for one of my favorites. Picture a pop in your mouth cookie with the texture of a powdered lemon cookie. The trick to not getting a bland, dry cookie is the cookie to sugar coating ratio when you roll them in the powdered sugar. The cookie should be a small ball, slightly larger than the size of a small marble, cooked through but not browned so the flavor is mild. Then while they are a little warm still you coat them in the powdered sugar. After they are cool you coat them one more time. This creats a wonderful smooth coating that melts in your mouth right before the inside crunch from the cookie.
Thanks Lana for the recipe!

I have been looking for this recipe for years.  The only time I have ever had these they were store bought, but I loved them.  These are great and easy...

Hard and tasteless. I've had Mexican Wedding cookies several different ways, but never this bad.

Wonderful cookies. Very few ingredients and fast to make. Tried them as a "plan B" do to the failure of another dessert I was making for a Mexican potluck. With time running out I found this recipe and still made it to the party on time! Real keeper and a big hit at the potluck. UPDATE: 12/22, Six months, can't believe there hasn't been more kudos posted to this recipe!! Made it again tonight to give as gifts tomorrow. This is one fast and bullet proof cookie to make. It's easy, looks great, and tastes wonderful!

These were AWESOME.  Not too sweet, but nutty and buttery.  I've tried other recipes, but these were by far the best I've ever made.  I made one change and that was to cook only 20 minutes.  They were perfect!

These are wonderful. I read some reviews and I also only cooked for 15 - 20 minutes. I used half butter shortening and half butter and rolled them in the sugar after cooling for a few minutes and then again when completely cooled. My son and husband loved these also! It's a keeper for us!

This recipe is almost identical to the one my family has passed on for years.  We like to use black walnuts, and consider the holidays incomplete without what we refer to as Mexican Wedding Cakes.  Most delicious.

This is the basic recipe for Mexican wedding cakes.  I only bake them 20 minutes. And roll them into small balls about the size of a quarter and then pat them slightly when I put them on the cookie sheet.  Drop immediately into powdered sugar and roll around. They turn out PERFECT every time.

These are super good cookies! I only baked for 12-15 minutes and they were brown on the bottom. The bake time of 30 minutes is way too long...they would burn. Shake in powdered sugar in a ziplock when still warm.....let cool, then shake them again in the powdered sugar to serve. These freeze easily. just thaw and re-shake in the powdered sugar.  Chopped pecans or walnuts work! Really tasty cookie!

I made these cookies for a mexican buffet and everyone loved them.  I doubled the recipe and felt that I would've been making cookies all night.  I pressed the dough into a jelly roll pan, baked until very light brown & cut into small squares.  I then took the advice of another poster and coated them w/powdered sugar while warm and after they cooled.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top and they were absolutely delicious, easy and I was asked for the recipe more than once!

Very crumby and quite bland.  They're so dry that I HAD to drink milk with them.

This was my first time to make this recipe which I used as part of a my Christmas baking.  I loved them!!  Unfortunately only a few made it on my gift trays because I stood there and gobbled most of them up before I realized it!

This is a wonderful cookie !! I find if you lower the temp.  to 300 for 30 minutes it works very well. I make these cookies every year at Christmas sometimes more if I have someone ask you remember those cookies you make and roll in powdered sugar? Sure would like one . I then get the hint . Cookie time!!
