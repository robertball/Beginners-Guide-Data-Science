Instead of one large quiche, I pour the mixture into the bottoms of a greased muffin pan, a little less than half full.  It makes bite sized portions that are perfect for a party.  My friends always ask me for "my recipe"!  Easy and delicious.  Oh, I use whatever shredded cheese is on sale at the store.

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS ( VERY SIMILIAR ) FOR YEARS . I USE A 10 OZ. PACKAGE FROZEN SPIANCH (DEFROSTED ), 4 EGGS , 2 1/2 CUPS MIXTURE OF ANY TYPE OF CHEESES ( I LIKE SWISS WITH PARMESAN OR MOZZAELLA WITH RICOTTA ) , ANYTHING WORKS . I THROW IN CHOPPED SCALLIONS , A TOUCH OF NUTMEG AND GARLIC SALT . I ALSO TOP WITH BOTTLED MUSHROOM SLICES , GREEN OLIVES , TOMATO SLICES  OR WHATEVER I HAVE ON HAND . BAKE AT 375 ,IN A 9 " PIE PAN , FOR 30 MINUTES , OR UNTIL THE EDGE STARS TO BROWN AND THE CENTER NO LONGER BUBBLES ( WITH MOISTURE ) . WHEN ENTERTAINING , I DOUBLE THE RECIPE AND BAKE IN A 9" X 13" GLASS BAKING DISH , CUT INTO SMALL SQUARES AND SERVED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. IT IS ALWAYS IS A HIT .

Yummy!  I didn't use muenster cheese.  Instead, to make this lower fat, I used 3 eggs, 1/2 cup light sharp cheddar, 1 cup fat free cottage cheese, and a 1/4 cup light parmesan cheese.  I added a few sliced mushrooms and green onion in the saute.  Although not as rich, still tasty and forgiving recipe.

My husband lost nearly 30 pounds on the Atkins diet, and this is his favorite breakfast! I bake a quiche each Sunday night, and he just heats up a slice before work. 
I substitute sharp cheddar for the muenster, but cut the amount to two cups. I also add about four ounces of lean chopped ham, along with a little minced garlic. Delicious!

I love the base of this recipe but when made as is, it was too thin and stiff from too much spinach. I made it as written the first time and ended up with a very stiff, thin, dry spinach pie. I have continued to use this recipe so to speak, but have since used 5 large eggs, only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the spinach called for, chopped bell peppers and 1/4 cup milk, and only 2 cups of cheese (I usually use cheddar). Other add-ins I have used with fantastic results - 1/2 cup cottage cheese in place of cheese, 1/2 cooked chopped bacon or ham, 1 can diced green chilies, chopped sun dried tomatoes, 1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese  or feta, mushrooms (saute first), or caramelized onions.  I usually assemble this the night before and just pop it in the oven the next morning. With extra eggs and milk, I add about 4-5 min. of cooking time. Also, no need to saute spinach. I just drain and squeeze it dry before throwing into the egg mixture. If using onions, sauteeing is a must.  With more eggs and some milk, you get a slightly thicker, more moist and tender quiche.  You will never miss the crust it's so good.

I've adapted this recipe to be a bit healthier - I use EggBeaters in place of the eggs, use lowfat feta cheese and I put in a bit of chopped lean ham.  I bake them in muffin tins and two muffin sized mini quiches are less than 100 calories (2 points if you're a Weight Watcher!).  I slightly under cook them so I can pop them in the microwave at work for a nice breakfast.

Very gourmet yet simple to make. Substituting 1 c. chopped scallions for the diced onion cuts down the frying time and gives a nice aroma - just add directly to the egg mixture. Freshly chopped herbs can also be added such as dill or basil for a fragrant aroma. If using fresh spinach instead of frozen, use 8 c. washed and chopped. Excellent!

I made this nearly every Friday during Lent and my whole family loves it. Sometimes I would vary it a little, using fresh spinach, adding mushrooms or green peppers or an extra egg. I always doubled the pepper and used fresh cracked. This is a fantastic recipe and very versatile.

This is great and super easy. I was looking for a quiche without the crust! I made it for my friends and they raved. I am making it again today (Sunday) so that I can have it for breakfast during the week. Heats up great. I only use 2 cups of cheese (1 bag, shredded) any kind and I also had a little bit of fresh nutmeg.

I have been making this quiche for many years.  It is so easy and delicious.  I use a good sharp Cheddar cheese.

This is almost identical to a recipe I got from a B & B and have made many times.  I use Egg Beaters or similar product for the eggs, add a little flour, and use various combos of cheese.  Everyone loves it, and leftovers (if there are any) are equally good.

I made these in regular muffin tins it was enough to make about 14 muffin size quiches.  There were done at about 25 minutes.  I made a few in mini muffin tins just to test it and these turned out great too and were done in about 20 minutes.  (My oven usually takes a few extra minutes to cook things).  I brought these to a brunch with 6 people and they were gone in about 3 minutes, before we even sat down to eat.

Update: I made again recently and substituted 1 cup of cheese with one cup of cottage cheese.  It worked great and you would have never known there was cottage cheese in them.  Since cottage cheese is denser I got a few extra "muffins" (18 exactly)

Love this as a base recipe. You can add pretty much whatever you like to the base to make it your own. My first cooking included chopped green chiles and jalepeno peppers. I then sliced cherry tomatoes to garnish on top before going in the oven, and served with sour cream and salsa. It was beautiful and was a HUGE success. Everyone had seconds.  My second cooking had a Greek flair. I used Feta cheese, added chopped artichoke hearts, oregano, six large shrimp arranged on top as a garnish, etc. I say "etc." because you really can custom this to ANY taste you desire. Only hard fast rules are to use 6 eggs instead of the suggested 5, and depending on the ingredients you opt in, you will have to adjust the cooking time up -- check in 3-5 minute intervals until a knife comes out clean. Have fun! Experiment. It's all good!

This is probably one of my favorite foods. I could eat it every day and not get tired of it! The only changes I make are using fresh spinach (melt the butter in the skillet, cook the onions in the butter, add 10 ounces fresh spinach until wilted; let cool slightly and chop with a knife on a cutting board) and using whatever cheese I have on hand (usually cheddar; I've actually never tried it with Muenster cheese). I've also mixed in fresh, firm, diced tomatoes and it's good. This is a spring/summer standby in our house; even two out of my three kids love it.

I would give this recipe a 4.5, but a 5 with these changes - I cut the spinach down by almost a half. All of the spinach was too much and made it too dense. I also added two finely crushed fresh garlic cloves, added about 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan, and about two tablespoons of finely diced red peppers. I also used the mini muffin pan since this was for a brunch party. I first filled them 3/4 of the way and they turned out too dry so the next time I filled them to the top and they puffed up perfectly and they were so moist and fluffy. It took about 25 minutes at 350 degrees. They were such a hit and they popped out just perfectly!! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this tonight for dinner, but I made it in the nonstick skillet that I sauteed the veggies in(mushrooms,onions, spinach).  I simply put the egg mixture in and covered it, cooking it on low, and lightly tossing it to have it cook through.  It formed beautifully and I put shredded sharp cheddar on the top with diced tomatoes and crumbled bacon.  Turned the heat off and let it set for a few minutes - it cut just like a pizza/pie.  My husband raved over it.  All in all it took me less than 1/2 hour from beginning to plate!

My tip for this delicious recipe? Sprinkle 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese on top of the quiche before it goes in the oven. This will add a slightly browned, crispy crust on top that adds a little texture, and makes for a beautiful presentation!

I love this recipe. You can do anything to it and it is very forgiving and tasty! The first time I made this I wanted it a little less dense, so I cut the spinach in half and added fresh mushrooms,it was delicious! Since then I have used sauteed asparagus tips, smoked salmon and brie (that's my favorite) chopped apple wood smoked bacon etc... and I only use 1 cup of shredded cheese and 2 oz low fat feta  or 3 sticks of lowfat string cheese(chopped) and 2 tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan cheese. I also only use 2 eggs and 1 cup of egg whites it is always delicious and healthy! Each slice is about 160 to 200 calories! If you do use egg whites you have to increase the cooking time to 45 minutes, and cover with tin foil for the first 35 min., though, well worth the wait! I make this recipe different every week and eat a slice for breakfast on my way out the door. Yummy!

I substituted mozzarella and cheddar cheese for the muenster and loved it.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It looked very thick when I mixed all the ingredients.  Resist the temptation to add milk or more egg.

Perfect! Used a suggestion to pour the mixture in muffin forms for mini-quiche - instant hit! No additions/alterations required, except for one: add some feta cheese to the mix! Goes wonerful with spinach!

Added the 8 cups of chopped fresh Spinach instead of the bag of frozen spinach. Added 1 cup of sharp cheddar and 2 cups of Mozz, because I didn't have any Munster. Sprinkled Paprika on top.

I have been using this recipe for several months now, and it is awesome!  I use fresh spinach that I rinse and microwave for about a minute before adding it to the onions, and I use less spinach than is called for.  I recently found myself with only Mexican style cheese on hand, so I stirred in some salsa with the spinach and onion and it was incredible!!  What I really like about this recipe is that you can pretty much throw in anything you have on hand (bacon & sausage are favorites at my house) and use any kind of cheese, and it still turns out great.

I added 1/2 of a chopped red pepper, reduced the cheese to 2 cups, and added about 5 chopped up links of vegetarian breakfast sausages. This was delicious on it's own, and also very good crumbled up in a tortilla shell as a breakfast burrito.

Yummy! I had every intention of making this to recipe but got carried away. My changes were sauteeing the onion in 1 lb of sausage, adding that to 8 eggs beaten, 3/4 cup of milk, dry ground mustard, garlic powder, 2 oz. pimientos, used italian blend cheeses. Mixed wll, poured into a 9x13 that I had sprayed with baking spray. Baked for 40 minutes and let sit for 10. Perfect! Nice Sunday morning dish!

I'm so happy I found this recipe! I'm low-carbing and this is perfect for me.  The variations are endless. I use about 3/4 cup of ricotta cheese and thin it out with a little cream. I add the spinach right into the cheese/egg mixture and skip adding it to the pan.  I love the addition of the sauteed onions and I also saute mushrooms and add them in as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I have made this for a few different breakfast events and it is very popular. For the most part I double the recipe because I am making it for large groups. Next time I will try the muffin tin idea. I do add one more egg but otherwise have made the recipe as written. A recommendation from the deli dept. for Muenster cheese was to use either Boars Head brand or Finlandia. Both of these are not too soft and will shred easily. I have added sliced tomatoes on top and that adds to the presentation. I also like the idea of roasted red peppers mixed in. There are so many options!

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 glass dish.  I only used 2 cups of cheese but it still was very good.  This recipe is a keeper!

this was very delicious, however i did change a few things.  I used fresh spinach, green onions, dill and parsley and cooked them together for a few minutes on the stove.  I only used ~ 1 cup of cheese (i've used more before and thought it was a bit too greasy) and added 2 extra eggs.  I sliced some tomatoes on top and crumbled feta.  one of the best quiches i've ever made!

Awesome, substitute fresh spinach, add 1/8 cup fresh parsley, 3 tbsp of minced garlic, and 8oz package of immatation crab.   Switched the cheese to 8 oz of pepper jack.  Instead of a pie plate, made in in standard size muffin pan (filled half way), made 12 mini quiches. Adjusted time to approx 22 minutes, or until top starts to turn slightly brown.  This is now on my must make list for guests.

Very nice!  Mixture fit perfectly in 12 muffin cups and cooked in about 20 minutes.  Mini quiches slide right out and would be super easy to freeze and have on hand.  Next time will try with a stronger cheese though.

Thought this was a great starter recipe, though I added lots of things to it to give it more flavour. Added garlic, mushrooms, celery, sundried tomatoes, soy sauce, nutmeg and chilli flakes to the spinach(used half an onion),and used fresh spinach. Also added some chopped toasted nuts and seeds for texture and added some dried coriander to the eggs. Used a mature white cheddar (2 cups) and topped with half a sliced beef tomato for presentation. Think it might have been quite plain otherwise.. Great to experiment with though!!

Love this recipe!  It's easy & healthy and you can add whatever veggies or even meat that you'd like.  I made it as written the first time, but added ham.  Delish, but I agree with other reviewers that a whole pkg of spinach was too much & overpowered, so maybe use half.  Making this now with sauteed onions, peppers mushrooms, some artichoke hearts & steamed broccoli...looks so colorful.  Skipped the cheese this time.  Also, add extra egg whites to stretch it further.  Thanks for this very versatile recipe!

This is SO super easy and SO delicious.  I use whatever shredded cheese I happen to have in the house.  So far I've tried it with shredded 4 Cheese Mexican (so-so), shredded muenster (very good, but more work because I had to shred the cheese myself) and tonight I used shredded sharp cheddar (best yet).  I also used LOTS of mushrooms (about 2 cups) and 1 cup of onions.  I love making this in a muffin tin.  Not only do the mini-quiches look darling, but they all have a yummy crust going around the entire little quiche.  I will be experimenting with Egg Beaters and low fat cheese to make this a tad healthier.  Bon appetit!

I use this recipe constantly with whatever vegetables I have on hand. My two favorites are sweet corn or zucchini and onions. This is a perfect recipe and I'm so happy I found it. I recommend just a small dash of something like garlic powder of even a bit of actual garlic to give it a flavor boost, but aside that, great as is!

This was my first time making a quiche and this recipe exceeded my expectations. It was super! My husband doesn't like quiche and now likes mine (this recipe). It is chock full of spinach, which we love, and is full of taste. I love it not having a crust to save on calories and I'm not a big fan of pie crust. I will make this one of my staple recipes.

I was really surprised at how good this quiche was without a crust.  I made it as directed except I did add a dash of nutmeg.  I liked the difference of a quiche with Muenster instead of the usual cheddar or Swiss cheese.  We had it for dinner and I also reheated some for breakfast--it was great for either.  It's a versatile recipe that can be a great starting point for a lot of variation in ingredients.  A keeper!

I added one more egg..cut the cheese down to 3/4 of a cup inside the mix..reserved a 1/4 for on top to lower the calories.  Quiche was excellent and only 150 cals per slice.  I didnt miss the extra fatty cheese.

Actually, more like four and a half stars.  I think it could be five though, with some changes.  I added tarragon and nutmeg, because the recipe didn't seem to call for enough spice.  I think next time, I will add even more tarragon and nutmeg.  My boyfriend suggested less spinach, and maybe add some other veggie.  Perhaps mushrooms, or red peppers?  Also, Muenster cheese is pretty mellow, might go with something sharper.  I used shallots instead of regular onion and sauteed it with about a clove of garlic.  I might step it up on the garlic next time too.

This was my first time making and eating a crustless quiche so I wasn't sure what to expect. I wanted a healthy breakfast and we love quiche so I decided to give this a try… and make it even a little healthier. It was delicious! It's easy to warm up a slice for a quick breakfast. With the following modifications there are 240 calories per slice: I added chopped mushrooms with the spinach and sautéed together with the onions, decreased the cheese to 2 cups using an 8 oz block of swiss that I shredded, added 1/2 cup of low fat cottage cheese, added a few green onions and topped with roma tomato slices. I read online that your quiche is done when the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees. Do not let it go over 185 degrees as it will get tough.

This was the best quiche I've ever made! I fried one large finely chopped red bell pepper with the onion and 2 cups chopped fresh spinach. I used 6 jumbo eggs, 2 cups of Lucerne marble cheese, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a generous sprinkle of roasted garlic and red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, salt and pepper.

This was my first quiche and it came out delicious! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and a blended shredded cheese. I think I'll use a little less cheese next time but otherwise this was fantastic!

An absolutely wonderful recipe!!!  Very forgiving also.  I used a 14 oz. pkg. of frozen spinach. I sauteed some fresh mushroom(could use canned if that is all you have) in with the onion and several cloves of garlic.  This is the second time I have done this and this time added fresh chard from the garden, about 8 stalks, cook the stalks with the onion and garlic, then the chopped tops with the spinach.  Also added fresh parsley.  I added some low fat cottage cheeese and about 2 C. of mixed cheeses (all I had), a mix of cheddar and mozarella, though any cheese will do. (used jack/cheddar last time)  I also added plenty of ground pepper and some salt, generous grinding of fresh nutmeg (note to newer cooks, buy a nutmeg grinder or a rasp, and nutmegs, then are they are always fresh)and fresh basil(dried in a pinch). I used the 6 eggs and a splash of milk this time as I had more veggies but the number can be changed depending on how much veggie you use.  And, to make it even easier, use a pan that will go into the oven - cook everything, add the eggs/cheese and cook in the pan.  A one dish meal!!  Just wonderful and delicious!!

Great for us who are trying to do low carb.  I used lots of fresh chopped baby spinach that I added to the onions after they were starting to get a little soft and added fresh garlic and a minced cayenne pepper for some heat.  I only used about 2 cups of cheese but added a 6th egg.  Tasted very healthy and delicious.

This is really a yummy egg dish.  I wouldn't classify it as a quiche as there is no cream in it and it is much denser than a quiche.  I used an 8 oz container of tomato/basil feta instead of the muenster and it is delicious.  Great for a low-carb breakfast during the week.  I just made it on Sunday and then divided it into serving size pieces so that I could warm it in the microwave in the morning.  - Thanks Susan

5 stars for ease and 5 for flavor.  I used 2 bunches chopped green onions and 2cups lowfat Monterrey Jack cheese and sprinkled parmesan on top since that's what I had.  Great SouthBeach Diet breakfast!  Thanks!

Fractured my foot, in pain, can't walk, alone at home...WHAT DO I EAT???   Hobbled over to the kitchen....well...considering I had to use what was in my fridge I made quite a considerable amount of changes to this recipe.   I'm not so sure about the combination of ingredients I have in my fridge! LOL  While kneeling on a kitchen chair in front of the stove to keep pressure off my foot, I greased a 9" square baking pan with olive oil and lined the bottom and sides with 2 sliced boiled potatoes. Sprinkled potato with 1/4 tsp: salt, pepper, oregano, paprika, and garlic powder. Sprinkled a little more olive oil over seasoned potato. Placed in oven at 350 and baked until slightly browned (about 20 minutes).   Meanwhile, I diced 3 small red onions & 4 garlic cloves and sauteed in 1 tablespoon olive oil until softened. Then I stirred in 1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms and corn removed from 2 corn on the cobs. Sauteed until tender. Removed from heat, stirred in a handful chopped cilantro.  In a large bowl I beat 6 eggs. Beat in 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 tsp paprika & cumino, 1/4 teaspoon: salt, pepper, & crushed oregano. Stirred into 2 cups mozzarella cheese into eggs. Stirred vegetable mixture into eggs. Poured over potatoes. Smoothed out with back of spoon. Topped with slices of tomato. Placed in oven uncovered (wanted liquid from tomato & corn to evaporate).  Meanwhile,pureed: 1 avocado, 1 jalapeno, 4 tomatillos, 1/2 lime juiced, pinch salt, pinch ground cumino, 1 small red onion, 2 garlic

Absolutely sensational!  I added sauteed mushrooms and red bell pepper and thought the Muenster cheese was perfect, but the combinations are endless and exciting.  I can't wait to play around with this one!  We felt positively virtuous eating this, and didn't miss the crust at all!

Great crustless quiche recipe which can be modified by using broccoli(as I did). I made mine in a round 10" quiche pan and should have increased the ingredients a bit. I think the key to this recipe is cooking the onions and spinach in oil before baking. Try adding a little garlic, ham, sausage or bacon. This is a recipe which can be easily altered.

Delicious, quick and easy. I did make a few changes....I used two boxes of spinach, red onion and swiss cheese.  Less eggy than normal which I like a lot. This is a fantastic addition to a low carb diet. Next time I'm going to add some sliced mushrooms.

Nummy! This is *fantastic*! I used a stalk of fresh spinach rather than the 10 oz frozen package- after you cut the stems off and chop it up the fresh spinach ends up being about the same amount when you saute it in the oil. I used olive oil and added quite a few extra seasonings, and although the olive oil was great I overseasoned it. I thought that with that much spinach it would need to be seasoned a lot more than the recipe stated but I was wrong! Maybe a little sprinkling of herbs on top next time and it'll be perfect.

Oh, YUM!!! This was OUTSTANDING! My boyfriend exclaimed, "This may be the best quiche I've ever had in my life." I'm doing Atkins, and I was searching for something different for breakfast and decided to try this. I used a bag and a half of fresh baby spinach because that's what I had, and I added a 9.6 oz. bag of fully cooked breakfast sausage crumbles to brown with the onions while they cooked. I also added more salt & pepper to the whole mixture before pouring into the pie plate and it came out perfect for our tastes. This came out full-bodied and perfect textured, too. Sooooo delicious!!!

My perfect idea of breakfast: (1) Easy to eat healthy breakfast in hand, running out the door; (2) Pretty enough to serve for brunch.  Delicious!  I bake in muffin tins (without papers), sometimes with a tomato slice on top to make it look good.  Hubby loves them and is in awe of how I can make spinach taste good, ha ha.

I used another reviewer's idea to bake it as mini quiches in regular muffin tins and they turned out fabulous! Baking time was 23 minutes and yielded 16 beautiful mini quiches. One tip: if you use muenster, omit the salt, as muenster is salty enough already. This one's a keeper!

This is a delicious and healthy recipe.  I took other's suggestion to personalize my quiche.  I use fresh baby spinach, mushrooms, shredded carrot, diced red pepper, 6 eggs, a good pinch of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper.  I also like cheddar cheese and only use 2 cups.  It is a very versitle recipe. I then top it with slices of tomatoe.  I'm sure I will experiment with other vegetables.  The leftovers are very good. I like to make up a quiche let it cool and then cut up and store for breakfast and lunches.  My husband loves taking it to work with him for breakfast.

Great recipe. This was made on a rainy day and I did not want to go outside. I used ingredients that were in my kitchen already. I used frozen broccoli instead of spinach.  After microwaving the broccoli for a few minutes, I cut it into small pieces. I used butter instead of vegetable oil. Instead of the cheese the recipe called for, I used 1 cup of Colby and Monterey Jack blend and 1 cup of Parmesan. I did not have a single onion in my kitchen so I used 2 cloves of garlic (chopped), Emeril's Original Essence, and a few dashes of salt. Also, I lightly sprayed my glass baking dish with cooking spray before putting the mixture in.

Absolutely delicious... and so easy to make!  Also so easy to change- it's also great with any combination of spinach, broccoli, ham, tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, etc.  I think the meunster is the key to this delicious recipe!

This was delicious, light and fluffy! To lower the fat and calories a bit, I added 1/4 cup skim milk and used only half the amount of cheese, substituting cheddar for Muenster. I also used fresh spinach and a Roma tomato. Just heavenly!

This is a winner tonight! Husband asked for it to be placed on the main list of dinners to have and he always says he doesn't like quiche!  Note: I used half as much cheese as they recommended. I use a little bit of medium cheddar, parmesan, low fat mozerella and feta. Coconut oil was used instead the unhealthy vegetable oil. I used 3/4 package frozen spinach, 1/2 sweet onion, 6 oz sliced mushrooms, 1/2 bell pepper, satayed in coconut oil with a bit of white wine at the end cooked out. Spices added: sea salt, fresh ground pepper, a dash of nutmeg and a dash chili pepper. Enjoy!

Easy, turned out great!  I had a bunch of fresh spinach that I needed to use, so substituted that for the frozen.  You don't need to be too strict about measurements.  As near as I can figure, 4 oz of cheese = 1 cup.

Great quiche.  I only used 4 eggs, and since I didn't have muenster cheese I used provolone.

My daughter and I really liked this dish.  The only thing I added was some garlic powder, and only used 2 C of cheddar cheese.  This recipe is very versatile, you can experiment with different cheeses and fillings.  May try again using a different veggie or cheese combination.

Addictively good. Had to use sharp cheddar instead of Muenster as that's what I had to hand and also added chopped fresh red chilli as I had some that needed using up. Came out beautifully, only problem is that it's supposed to be for Mr P's lunch and I can't stop picking at it myself! Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty, simple recipe.  I have made this twice, last time at a luncheon and it was all eaten.  I substituted cheddar since it was in my fridge, and added chopped garlic, green chiles and cooked them in white wine instead of olive oil.  I also added an extra egg to accomodate extra ingredients and it came out perfectly.  This will stay in my recipe book, thank you.

This is sensational!  Even though the lady at the store expressed doubt about me shredding muenster cheese, since it is so soft, I had no problem.  My salad shooter shredded it in a jiffy.  I used a 9 by 13 pan and cut squares.  This is a great recipe for Atkins dieters too.  Thanks!!

I chose this recipe for my breakfast unit in cooking class. Yummy yum yum. Instead of three cups of cheese I used one (teacher only had 1cup left) but it still turned put great. It was a big hit with my classmates and my family. Definitely making this again.

My 20 year old son ate half of this quiche in one sitting! I did add two extra eggs, and 3 1/2 cups of havarati cheese. I like my salt, so added a 1/2 tsp. (+) salt. Used 8 cups of fresh spinach. By the time it sautes down you would've never known there were 8 cups to begin with. I also added sliced (long) grape tomatoes, cut side up to the top of mixture in pie pan. My son said that was why he loved this recipe so much. Amazing recipe. Side note-sauteed fresh mushrooms for those who wanted to add those on top of the already cooked quiche.

As I was cooking for a crowd, I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 x 11 pan @ 360 degrees for about 40 minutes, which is when the knife in the center came out clean. I used fresh spinach from the garden, added mushrooms and minced garlic. I also used a mix of swiss, pepper jack, and muenster cheeses. I think next time I'll also add some chopped pepper. Excellent recipe!

This was delicious and a great way to utilize some of the eggs from our "girls".  The only little tweak I made was to add some sliced tomato rings on top during the last 10 minutes---just for a pop of color.  Thanks for posting!

My husband and I are doing a low carb diet two days per week and this is great! I normally make every recipe "as is" the first time through, but I used the cheese I had in the fridge (sharp white cheddar and asiago) and added 4 oz prosciutto. The cheeses were great, but the prosciutto got lost. Definitely looking forward to trying it with Muenster.

I added chopped bacon pieces and still it was lacking in flavor diversity as the spinach just blends in and too much cheese. So cut back on the cheese. Also next time I will add an extra egg along with red pepper strips and keep the bacon I had before. It just needs the red pepper to break up all the strong cheese flavor and add a little freshness to the quiche.

Made this with red onion and thick shredded mozzarella instead of a normal onion and Muenster. I also doubled the recipe, with one half in a pie pan and the others in muffin tins (taking them out of the oven sooner). Perfect amount of flavoring and cooking time, and the ones in the mini muffin tins came out like perfect little appetizers. Easy and quick-highly recommend!

This was exceptionally delicious!  I served it at a casual breakfast with friends and everyone loved it.  I don't eat wheat or gluten so this ha become my "go-to" quiche.  In fact I'm serving it next week for a Christmas brunch.  The bright green of the spinach makes it very festive.  I would recommend (as some others did) that you really drain the spinach well.   I used a clean kitchen towel lined with paper towels and poured the spinach in.  I then rolled it all up and twisted the towel to really squeeze out the extra liquid.  Worked like a charm!

I doubled this in a 13 x 9 inch pan and cut into squares. It was a big hit at a brunch, with several requests for the recipe! I used margarine to saute the onions instead of veg. oil. & 16 oz of muenster for the double recipe. I added about 1/4 cup extra cheddar to add color, and then grated extra cheddar on the top. I also prepared it the night before, then baked it the next morning (allowing it to sit out 20 min prior to baking). I can't wait to try it with some additions such as mushrooms or black olives, but it's delicious as is!

Very tasty. I used cheddar cheese, as that's all I had on hand, but I look forward to trying this again with a mixture of cheeses.

Excellent  flavor and quick to make.  I will keep this one in my regular rotation.  BTW just about any shredded cheese will do in this recipe however I wouldn't recommend swiss........too greasy!

I have made this many times since I first got the recipe here. We find that you can do endless variations on it. Try chopped vegies (green works best) and just about any kind of cheese. We like a mix of cheddar and swiss. I also have used sun dried tomatoes and peppers. Good stuff. We eat it for an evening meal.

Being Gluten Free this was great! I used egg substitute to cut down on the fat and calories and swiss since I didn't have the muenster cheese on hand. Next time I may add mushrooms too!

I love this recipe!  I make an entire pie then eat it for breakfast all week long.  It's a dieter's dream--I use reduced fat cheese and cut the cheese down to a cup and a half.  It's so delicious.  You get protein from your eggs and cheese, and you get plenty of healthy veggies with the spinach and onion.  I like to throw in a tomato or two as well for extra healthy measures.  It's very filling, and the way I make it, 1/4 of the entire pie only has 250 calories!!  That's a pretty big serving for 250 satisfing calories!  This is definitely one of my favorite recipes--go make one now!

I don't think I've ever made anything that's tasted as good as this, with as little effort. Make it like it says, with whatever cheese you have available. It is awesome, no doubt!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I love quiche, and this one is fantastic. I took kellyo22's advice and made 12 mini quiches in a muffin pan. Everyone loved how cute and delicious they were. I made them with gouda as recommended and thought the flavor was great; I will experiment with other cheeses in the future. These also kept very well in the fridge. I reheated several in the toaster oven the next day and they were still moist and fantastic.

This was very good however this is not a Quiche but rather a breakfast pie. After tasting it we realized the recipe doesn't call for milk or cream so it did not have the consistency of a Quiche. Still good but I continue my search for a Quiche recipe.

Loved this recipe!! I actually used a mini-muffin pan and served as an appetizer at a family gathering (made about 18). Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. I added 1/2 cup chopped ham and also threw in 1/2 a chopped tomato. I used swiss cheese simply because I like the taste and thought it would go well with the spinach. These were very good and I will make them often. I think they will freeze well and so will be handy for breakfast on the go or a quick snack. Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this so that I would have leftovers to use for breakfast the following couple of days. I added lots of onions, chopped ham, and lots of garlic. Pretty dang good. Is it the best? Probably not but I would make again because I'm always looking for an easy low-carb breakfast.

I added chopped ham, used sharp cheddar, and used only egg whites.  Bake time was about 10 minutes longer than original recipe.  This was SUPER tasty, eat for breakfast OR dinner.  Left overs reheat well too!

I loved this recipe!  I'm a big fan of basic recipes that are great on their own, or can be tweaked depending on my taste or mood, and this one definitely fits the bill.  I didn't make any changes at all except to use a mixture of shredded cheddar and shredded mozzarella, and instead of vegetable oil, I sauteed the onion in unsalted butter.  It turned out wonderful!  I will definitely make again and can't wait to experiment with ingredients!

This was great!  Here are the changes I made:  (a) I only used 2 cups of cheese.  I used the Kraft Italian blend of 5 cheeses.  (b) To cut down on the cholesterol I used organic "egg beaters" (a carton of organic egg whites).  (c) I bought a big organic beefsteak tomato and sliced it thin and placed them on top of the quiche.  For me, possibly because I used organic egg whites, I had to bake the quiche for 20 minutes at 350 and then 10 minutes at 375.  This was great!  My husband, who LOVES meat, really really liked this dish.  I made spaghetti with meat sauce on the side so he would get his "meat fix" and he actually thought a tossed salad would have been better as a side dish.  Go figure!  But thanks for the great recipe, we will definitely be making it again and having the leftovers for dinner tonight.  We will probably warm up the leftovers in our toaster oven.

This recipe is very good!  I also used cheeses I had on hand - cheddar, mozzarella - plus some sauteed fresh mushrooms, an extra egg, and some sliced tomatoes on top with a sprinkling of parmesan (and thus had to cook it a bit longer).  If I'd had artichokes, I would have put some of those in, too!  We loved it! * * * Update * * * Added a can of water-packed artichokes and a teaspoon or so of basil, and it was so unbelievably good.  I have to make it now for my son every time he comes home!  Very gourmet!  I bought the munster cheese to try next!

Very delicious and so easy.  I didn't have muenster so I used cheddar and it came out great.  In a convection oven, it needs only to cook for about 20 minutes.

I thought this was excellent.  I don't care much for munster cheese so i used cheddar, monterey jack, mozzerella, and provolone, and topped it with some parmesean.  I also added very coarsley chopped garlic and some garlic powder.  It was one on the best quiches I've ever had!

I am so glad to add this recipe to my recipe box.I have some physical challenges that include not being able to stand for hours (max 10 minutes and that is a challenge) over a hot stove, so finding something yummy, easy, and quick is great. The other thing I see here is the endless ways you can adapt this recipe. It's basically vegetarian (but not vegan) and you are a meat lover? Add some meat-ham, bacon, even some spicy left over chicken or shrimp. Clean your fridge of leftover veggies. Do not like spinach? How about using broccoli?  Want to lighten it?  Try some non-fat or lowfat cottage cheese to replace some (1/3) of the cheese (did that-yummy). Too bland? Experiment with herbs and spices you think would work-also vary the types of cheese.  I add garlic, some red pepper flakes, basil. I, also, added a teaspoon or two of ground flax seed for more fiber. I had a friend over and asked  her if she wanted to have a taste of my new recipe. She was skeptical until she tasted it, then I had to send the recipe home with her. Thank you so much for an excellent offering.  I know this will be made frequently in our house. I especially love that you don't have the added fat, calories, and carbs of traditional quiche with a crust.

With a few changes this became a 5-star recipe.  I added about a half a cup of milk.  Quiche usually has milk in it.  This makes it more fluffy.  I decreased the amount of spinach to 4 oz instead of 5oz.

One of my family's favorites!  We substitute broccoli on occasion for the spinach.  I usually have to double or triple it though since it's exactly enough for six (our family size) but they usually eat several pieces.  We never use muenster though, always shredded cheddar since that's what we have on hand.  We also add a package of bacon - which as my boys say, "Makes everything better!"  This also translates nicely without a lot of extra prep for my gluten/dairy/corn allergic son since I only have to change out the cheese for him at the last minute for non-dairy cheese.  And hen I'm truly feeling lazy, I use dried onions reconstituted in chicken broth.

I made this recipe using fresh spinach.

My ingredients:
1 pound fresh spinach. washed and chopped.
5 cloves of garlic, minced.
7 scallions, chopped.
1/2 inch ginger, grated.
3 full cups of grated cheddar cheese.
5 large eggs, beaten.
1/4 cup milk.
3/4 tsp salt.
1 tsp cumin seeds.
1 tsp pepper.
1/2 tsp italian seasoning.
Pinch of onion salt, garlic salt, nutmeg, cheese jalapeno popcorn flavor. ( basically anything you feel will go well with spinach)
1 tbsp oil.

In a pan, heat the oil and add cumin seeds. when they crackle, add garlic and ginger. Once the raw smell of garlic goes away, add scallions. Saute for a minute and then add spinach. Cook till spinach is tender but not completely cooked. (At this point, there will be water in the pan from spinach. I took it off the flame and used a slotted spoon to pick the spinach. You may try cooking till the water evaporates, I was afraid of overcooking so I avoided.)

Now as directed by the original recipe, mixed the ingredients and poured in a 9.5 inch pie pan.(I know, 9.5 inch?? anchor hocking set)

Cook for 35 mins, but let it remain in the oven for another half hour before you serve. 

I garnished it will tomato slices and olives as an afterthought.

I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen spinach. Added onion powder & basil. Yum!

Previous reviewers mentioned two main complaints with this recipe: (1) too bland, and (2) too cheesy, so I made some modifications.  I cooked six slices of bacon and then used a little of the grease to saute the onions, a couple cloves of garlic (new addition), and a bag of fresh spinach.  I salted and peppered to taste rather than measuring and added the crumbled bacon to the quiche.  I also used cheese that I had on hand - a combo of white cheddar and mozzarella - and although I did not measure, it probably came to less than three cups.  My vegetarian daughter refused to eat the quiche because of the bacon, but the rest of us enjoyed it.

This was absolutely wonderful! I couldn't find shredded Muenster, so I used shredded extra sharp cheddar and it was a great substitution. This recipe could be easily altered to make any kind of crustless quiche.

This quiche is so simple to make and even easier to eat.  I substituted pepper-jack for the muenster but I'm sure any kind would taste great.  I also topped the whole thing with tomato slices for popping it in the oven.

This made for a delicious low carb breakfast. I used 2% Kraft Sharp Cheddar as well as some low fat Jarlsberg. I used red onion and egg beaters. Very good!

Excellent!  I used fresh spinach (since I think it's much easier to work with than frozen) and just wilted it in the pan with the onion.  Super easy recipe and great reviews from everyone!

Great starter recipe.  I love the fact that it is crustless.  I use 16 oz of Egg Beaters, whatever cheese we have on hand (although I have never used 3 cups!) and sometimes add meat or not.  It's great with sun dried tomatoes and roasted red bell peppers, heck whatever veggies you have on hand.

I just made this quiche this morning for my lovely lady, and let me tell you it was bangin!  I added bacon because - even though we both need to fit into our wedding dresses in one wee little month - um, bacon is delicious.  Instead of muenster, I literally used whatever cheese I had in my fridge.  1/2 cup of parmesan & 2 cups of "mexican mix" which had monterey jack, cheddar, asiago and some other deliciousness.  Our slices were gobbled up in seconds.  I highly recommend this dish - quick & easy!

I have made this at least 10 times, I'm not even joking. My fiancee loves this so much. It super easy to make and it tastes great, what more can you ask for? The only thing I will say is that this is NOT quiche, but rather a frittata. Quiche not only has no crust, but also is custard based (eggs and cream). Frittata has no cream or crust.

This is my favorite recipe for quiche, and it's the only quiche I make on a regular basis. You won't miss the crust with this, and why bother making a quiche with a crust when you can have it simple and delicious like this? This recipe is great as is, but it also serves as a good base recipe and you can alter it to your own tastes.  I up the eggs to 7, saute a yellow pepper with the onion, and add a generous sprinkle of nutmeg.  I shake the nutmeg on top once the vegetables and egg mixture are combined together, then I mix it all in until it's incorporated.  I would say I use about 1/4 t. to 1/2 t. of the nutmeg. It's so yummy!  Oh, and if you're feeling lazy and want to skip a step (or accidentally forget this step) don't fret about heating the spinach to get rid of the excess moisture.  If you wring it out well enough, it's not a big deal.  I forgot to heat it in the pan the last time I made it, and it still turned out fine.  Highly recommended!

tasted great, and i could see how it would be good cold too as appetizers.  although, for me, i just didnt feel good eating such an unhealthy dish with all that cheese :)  my kids passed on it too, which makes it hard for me to make again.  very easy easy dish and very good too though.  thanks!

Made this on Saturday for a potluck.  Made few changes ... added a shallot (sauteed with the onions) and some diced mushrooms (into the final mix).  Substituted feta for one-third of the cheese and used fresh spinach (blanched), which I decided not to chop ... which worked just fine.  Very tasty -- I brough home an empty pan!

I prepared exactly as listed, except added a little feta cheese, since I was short on Muenster.  Very yummy!  I prefer my quiche to be a little more tender, so next time I might add a little more egg.

These are quite yummy.  I used about 2 cups of shredded cheddar and 1 cup of mozzarella since that was all I had.  I baked them in a mini muffin pan for about 12 minutes.  I got about 30 muffins out of it.  Great bite sized appetizers for a party.

This was pretty darn good even "lightening" it up.  I used about half egg beaters and half eggs, 2% cheese of choice plus added mushrooms and garlic.  I rarely add salt to anything and it was fine. Next time I cooked it I just added a dash of 1/2 & 1/2 plus topped the two quiches the recipe made w/ Monterey Jack and the other w/ Sharp Cheddar. I spiced themup a bit w/ some hot sauce...no mushrooms this time.

Wonderful. I cooked mine in muffin tins as suggested by another reviewer. If your pans are non-stick, cook at 325 degrees. I just used up all different kinds of cheese I had in the house. Tasted great, mmmm.

This is such a great basic recipe, and mine turned out so yummy that I couldn't stop myself from getting just one more piece:). I threw in some diced ham & used about half of an 8 oz. bag of shredded cheddar cheese & it was delicious! Next time I think I'll try adding diced tomatoes.

This quickly became a family favorite. I like it better with a crust, but that is just personal preference. I used some of the earlier suggestions - nutmeg (1/8 tsp), flour (2 1/2 tbsp), garlic salt (1/8 tsp).  I used sharp cheddar (2 cups) and parmesan (1 cup)I also garnished with tomatoes sliced and placed in a rosette on top - the tomatoes taste good cold on the hot quiche.  This is a great recipe.  THANKS!

This has become a favorite! Sliced tomatoes on top are yummy! It's good hot or room temp.I also use whatever cheese is in the fridge. Always a mixture of the old stand bys. Mozza, cheddar and parm.

I took some of the suggestions from other reviews and used the muffin cups. Using what I had my quiche had onions, sweet red pepper, Aspergras, low fat Feta cheese and 96% low fat ham. I would not add the salt next time as he feta has enough. Would definetly make this again. You can use almost anything you have on hand.

This was a very tasty quiche that can be so versatile. I've made it with 5 and 6 eggs, different cheeses, mushrooms, garlic salt, etc and it was all great. I didn't use all the cheese - just 2 Heaping cups and still very sturdy. Thanks for the recipe!

Its good but don't substitute the eggs. I made that mistake when I tried using egg beaters and was not satisfied with the results.

This was really good.  My first quiche and it came out great.  I brought this to a pot luck and every one wanted the recipe.  I used sausage links that I crumbled up and then used a Tbsp of the grease to cook the onions and used a 1/2 can of diced green chiles.  The only thing that I may cut back on next time is the amount of cheese.  I used the three cups and used cheddar/jack combo and felt that it was just a tad too much.

Update! 
I made again and didn't change anything but the cheese amount and type and was a hit also.  I used a 2 cup bag of Mexican blend cheese.

This was sooo yummy. I used olive oil, and 4 eggs instead of 5 to make it a bit healthier, and it still came out fabulous. I also used 3 types of cheeses: cheddar, mozarella, and pecorino. VERY GOOD.

Excellent with a few changes I made on my own and from following the reviews. This is what I did.....I added an extra egg, a jar of well drained artichokes, 1 clove fresh garlic a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and some cottage cheese and parmesan cheese and diced butter cheese all instead of Muenster. It is MARVELOUS!! Very similar to our favorite spinach artichoke dip...only in the form of quiche. NOTE: make sure you squeeeze dry the spinach and drain the artichokes well! I also tried putting some into the microwave in a small glass bowl to bake and it worked great. Just microwave until it is cooked through. I think I did about 4-5 minutes for 2 cups of unbaked quiche. (Depends on your microwave.)

Delicious!!I am diabetic and crustless makes a huge difference in my blood sugars. I used 2 cartons of egg beaters,1 egg and garlic salt. I only had sharp shredded cheddar on hand so I used that and added some parmesan. Otherwise I followed recipe. Definitely something I will make often but may try low fat cheese because of the 23.6 g of fat.

Great results using the recipe exactly as is...except baked in mini muffin pans. I served the mini quiches along with traditional breakfast foods at a large family gathering. They added a nice bit of color to the buffet and my guests kept snacking on them after the meal. Actually I baked them the night before and they reheated nicely.
This quiche would be good for the main dish at any meal or the mini ones could be used as an appetizer or party nibbler.

Yum!! I have made this dish a few times. I noticed it tastes better to season the eggs with pepper, seasoning salt and garlic powder.

I used this recipe as a base, but instead of spinach, onion, and muenster, I use all my leftover vegetables and a lesser amount (4-6 oz) of whatever cheese I want (usually smoked gouda).  I also add some skim milk to the beaten eggs.  This is a great recipe for using up leftover veggies, particularly if they've already been seasoned and cooked as some other side dish.  Just chop them up a bit and throw them in.  I was surprised how good it turned out.  Just make sure to choose a cheese you really like as it makes a huge difference.

Cue the choir of angels: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!" This is low-carb breakfast nirvana. Amazingly good. I promise you won't mis the crust. And the best part is it's totally customizable. All I had was an Italian blend of shredded cheese and a Mexican blend of shredded cheese. I added some minced garlic to the onions and put in some petite diced ham. Heaven in my mouth. To save on calories and fat I used low fat shredded cheese and it was just delightful. Def add this to your arsenal if you're living a low-carb lifestyle!

This was easy to prepare and we really liked it. I used 1-1/2 c mozzarella and 1 c parmesan and added a little (maybe 1/2 c) diced ham since that is what I had on hand. Update: changed from 4 stars to 5 even though it isn't heart healthy, because we keep making it anyway and like it more each time! Every cheese combo and every twist we have tried has been great.

Excellent, although I would go lighter on the salt next time.  I added chopped mushrooms and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also made them in muffin tins and they turned out fantastic!

yummy... I broke the cheese down to make it lower fat: 
2 C. cottage cheese, 1 C. shredded cheddar.  I used 3 eggs and 4 whites and one large onion.  cooked 5 min longer. It was great cold the next day and the next.

This was SUCH A PLEASANT dish! I used fresh spinach and heated it in a pan just enough to wilt it, then squeezed it dry in a towel and chopped into small pieces. Cooked the onion until soft then browned slightly, added the spinach and evaporated any juice. Followed remaining directions exactly, except didn’t have quite enough Muenster, so made up the difference with Smoked Gouda (about ½ cup).  Served at room temperature as a side dish.  This could easily (and proudly) stand as a main course.  Really EXCELLENT -- my guests gave it rave reviews!  Was served at a birthday dinner with Marinated Grilled Shrimp by Rachel and Grilled Portobello Mushrooms by Michael (also from this site and 5*****).

Delicious!!! I sauteed onions, a clove of minced garlic, some chopped red pepper, baby bella mushrooms and then added the drained spinach. Used reduced fat shredded cheddar about 2 c. Loved this recipe....kind of like a frittata. So many options to make this quiche. Family loved it!

Pretty tasty.  Had to cook for much longer than 30 minutes-- then again I used a small high pyrex dish.

Tips:  do not undercook onion; it's ok to double onion amount; add full salt amount if you are using cheddar/monterey cheese combo; add frozen artichoke pieces;  bake in shallow container; put tomato slices on the bottom of pan so you can flip it and have them on top.

When low-carbing, this is excellent. I use whatever cheese I have available and it's still tasty.  I usually bake it in muffin cups for a quick South Beach breakfast - way better than the recipe in the book.

YUM!! This was a great recipe! I used 8 eggs and about 1/4 cup milk because I cooked it in a glass casserole dish. I also added some sliced mushrooms and ham for added flavour. I used cheddar cheese and put half in the mixture and sprinkled the other half on the top. Excellent leftover as well!

Wonderful and easy recipe!   Three of us ate it all up fresh out of the oven with not a bite left over.  My friend, who is on an Atkins diet, even got to have dinner with us tonight since this quiche has no crust!  I used a combo of Italian mixed cheeses, Parmesan and Swiss ( what was in my frig) and some chopped fresh parsley (which I needed to use up).  I even gave this recipe to my friend before she left my house.  Thanks for sharing it.

This quiche was so easy and so delicious.  I loved it with the muenster!  I added water chestnuts when I sauteed the onions and added a little garlic powder to the egg mixture.  It's very pretty also.  I think some diced red peppers or pimientos would be a nice addition.  The only change I would make next time is to use cooking spray instead of oil but just to cut down on the fat a little.

This quiche is wonderful!  I have been eating pieces of this for a few days now (after beginning a low carb diet) and it is a great way to start the day!  My non low-carb husband looks jealously at it each morning!  I lowered the cheese to 2 cups and left out the onion.

My toddler touches nothing that is green and he ate four servings!!!  He gave me an "mmmmmm", a "yea!!!", and a butt wiggle in his highchair-so I know it was good!  Thank you for this recipe!  I used swiss cheese and added some leftover grilled salmon from the night before.  My husband liked it, too.

This is a great recipe!  I made it for a group of missionaries and substituted cheddar cheese!  Everyone including the kids loved it.  My daughter enjoyed helping with all the cheese.  I got non-spinach lovers to eat seconds and thirds!  Thanks for the great recipe, Susan.

This recipe is delicious .  I have made it with one cup of cheese and one half pound of sausage.  I cook the onion and sausage together then add it to the rest of the ingredients .  I also add a clove of garlic and some Italian seasonings.  Soooo good!  I double it and my husband and I eat it all week for breakfast.

This recipe is perfect! I add all sorts of stuff to it,  whatever vegetables and cheeses I have on hand. Sometimes I put ham or bacon too and leave out the salt and it is amazing. Everyone Raves when I make it and asks for the recipe.  I always use fresh spinach & kale, healthy & delicious :)

Excellent!  In an effort to make more low carb meals I made this for hubby and I.  We both loved it!! It was very tasty and super simple to make.  I didn't have any muenster cheese so I used sharp cheddar and it still came out great!  And I also left it in the oven a few minutes longer than the recipe called for so that the edges would be a little more crispy.  Even with no bread, the eggs gave the feel that we were eating a hearty meal.  I will definitely be making this again, but I am going to try it with broccoli next time!

This recipe, without modifications, tasted like delicious scrambled eggs. Unfortunately, quiche calls for a custard composed of eggs and milk/cream. I would make this recipe again, but with modifications surrounding the custard. Also, remember to pass the custard through a strainer to ensure a thorough mix and preventing chunks of egg in the pie.

This was excellent!  I put in a muffin pan & made 8 servings @ 203 calories each. I used fresh spinach vs frozen.

I used a tiny 12 hole Bundt cake pan ( a bit smaller than most regular cupcake pan holes. The recipe made 12 with the recipe as follows. I didn't have frozen spinach so I took about 2/3 of the fresh packaged spinach I had and cooked it in water with some chopped mushrooms. Drained the lot of it once it was cooked down, then followed the recipe as stated,  I used Swiss cheese. I should mention that I did not have as much spinach into my batter as the recipe called for due to the fact that I was using fresh spinach cooked down, however I loved the way it came out and did not feel at all that there was not enough spinach once it was done. 350 degrees for only 25 minutes with the pan I had.

I love this dish! So quick and  easy to make, with amazing results. I tweaked the recipe a bit and added more vegetable oil to it because I found it is to dry without it. But other than that I think it is an excellent recipe, whenever I make it for my family I get requests for seconds!

This was pretty good.  It's slightly lacking in flavor, so if I make it again I think I'll had some chopped up pieces of sausage or bacon into it.  But... for a healthy, meatless meal, this really was a winner in my book!

My family LOVED this.  I used fresh spinach in mine.  The only thing I sauteed was the onion and I sauteed it in a little butter rather than oil (I know not as healthy).   We made two quiches: one with spinach and mushrooms, and one with spinach, mushrooms and bacon.  I used only 2 cups of shredded cheese and choose to use Colby Jack.  There was still plenty of cheese even though I cut the recipe by a cup.  I don't know if my 'large' eggs weren't large enough, but I used an extra egg and about a half of a cup of milk (I didn't measure).  Because of how I beat the eggs (with a hand mixer), it was really light and fluffy.  It's a very versatile quiche.  I ended up cooking it closer to an hour (about 50 minutes( as thirty minutes wasn't nearly enough.  I'm thinking it was the extra stuff in that made it need to be cooked longer.  Definitely a keeper!!!!

This was very easy with a good flavor. I added 6 slice of packaged ham for sandwiches, diced. this is a good recipe!...the options are open. artichoke hearts could added, or a touch of sour cream fat free of course....yum. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

A wonderful base for any kind of crustless quiche. I substituted the spinach for blanched broccoli; I also threw in some mushrooms with the onions.

Pretty good. I started prepping to make this and discovered that I didn't have the box of spinach in the freezer that I thought I did, so I made sort of a 'clean out the crisper' version, using some bell peppers and some wilty kale. I subbed in cheddar and parm for the muenster, since that was what I had on hand, and I baked the whole thing in the cast iron skillet that I sauteed the veggies in. Since it was still hot, my quiche was ready quicker! A nice, easy breakfast recipe.

I usually make a recipe the way it is written,  however, this time is different .  I  used cheddar and mozzarella cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I also used fresh spinach and kale.  I added minced garlic to the onions because I like garlic.  One person indicated that it was too spinachy .  But you can put in as much or as little as you want.  I also think you can add mushrooms and green pepper ( or red) if you want. Really good!

Brianna, Ryan, Matthew, and I ate it.  Caitlyn didn't.  However, she ate a lot of food after school, so that could've contributed to the fact that she didn't eat.  She never did say whether or not she liked it.  Served it with Breakfast Sausage.  Might add another egg or two, though.  Bake it in the deep dish pie pan.

I made this last night because of all the great reviews and had high hopes since it smelled so good while baking.  Unfortunately, it tasted too "spinachy" and had far too much cheese for my taste.  I like recipes that don't require any tweaking and this one would need too many to make it a keeper in my home.

This was amazing!  My husband had seconds and wanted to have the leftovers again the next night instead of freezing it (both of those things rarely happen!), and my 10 month old daughter loved it too.  Following other reviews, here is now I made it: Put frozen spinach in colander, ran with hot water until unfrozen, then squeezed out as much water as I could; sauteed onion, then added 2 chopped green onions (6 stems) and spinach to pan, continuing to cook on medium heat to evaporate remaining water from spinach; combined 5 eggs, only two cups Kraft mixed cheddar cheese (the kind that is made with Philadelphia cream cheese, it really made the quiche creamy), 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder (I love garlic, if you don't, you may not want to use as much) and 1/8 cup whole milk (could vary this depending on taste); added in the spinach mixture and mixed it thoroughly.  I baked this in a 9 inch metal cake pan sprayed with pam.  It cooked perfectly at 350 in 30 minutes.  I would highly recommend the cake pan over a pie dish as I think the quiche baked more evenly than when I have tried with a pie dish.  I really couldn't recommend this recipe more.  Enjoy!

This is our new favorite quiche!  I use cheddar instead of muenster because that is what I always have but make it just as the recipe states other than that.  I sometimes, depending on who I am making it for, add cayenne too.

I've made this countless times - sometimes fresh spinach - sometimes half kale - whatever cheese is in the refrigerator - maybe fresh tomatoes & maybe tomatoes & green chilies - whatever you come up with seems to turn out yummy! It is also great warmed up - since there is usually only two of us  - we eat it up a day or so later...still good! Thanks

I absolutely love this. Have made this a few times, and I find that it's a very versatile recipe. More cheese, or less cheese, a little chilli for flavor. Have used different cheeses with good results. I make a lot, cut into squared, and freeze each aluminum wrapped piece. In a rush, I just pop a frozen square right into the oven and it's good to go within pretty fast.

This was wonderful!  I added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms to the onions with a green pepper and yellow pepper after a couple minutes, then threw in 1# of fresh spinach (large container from Costco) and put the lid on it to cook with no extra liquid.  I also used 6 eggs as some other reviewers said.  Great way to use up odds and ends vegetables!

Try substituting the Muenster cheese for smoked Gouda and shred it with the skin/wax on it.  Also, add about two tablespoons of worcestershire sauce.  It adds a smoky flavor and texture (tastes like it has bacon in it).  I also cooked them in mini cupcake foil for fun.

I received tons of compliments on this and I loved it too!  I left out the onion and vegetable oil and sprinkled in some onion powder instead.  I used sharp cheddar cheese in place of muenster, although I think it would be good with that kind of cheese too.  After I saw how much cheese was mixed in, I felt it would be a bit much and added another egg.  I will definitely be making this again.  To make it lower fat, I would reduce the cheese and add another vegetable to it (maybe red pepper, artichoke, or broccoli).

It turned out really well. Used cheddar jack cheese instead. Very good with less carbs! For some reason, I can't add a photo but it was gorgeous!

i assembled the quiche, wrapped in saran wrap and stored overnight.  i baked it the morning of my event.  it was definitely a crowd pleaser and there was none left!  only suggestion i have is if you make ahead, give it a stir before you bake because the spinach settled to the bottom of the dish.  still tasted great though.  i opted to use 10 oz of fresh spinach and half a container of white mushrooms in addition to the onion.  i used 2 cups of trader joe's cheese blend and 1 cup crumbled feta.

This was a nice Mother's day brunch item I made. I love quiche but didn't want to go thru the work of blind baking a crust. It's also lower calorie this way. I did saute a little bacon with the onion and added some diced red bell pepper. To the eggs, I added a little nutmeg and milk. I didn't have muenster so used cheddar, colby jack and parmesean. I baked them in a 12 hole lg muffin pan for 30 min. My family loved them.

Pretty good, but it stuck to the dish horribly even though I greased it.  The pan is STILL soaking.  Will make again but try egg beaters and only after I figure out how not to get it stuck.

This is such an easy recipe.  It seems that every time I bring this to potluck, the crustless quiche is gone before the regular quiches.  I substituted mozzarella for the Muenster cheese and it turned out just fine.  There's more cheese than egg, though, but it holds up great!

I used feta cheese (reduced fat) and added some greek seasoning and bacon.  I cooked mine in a muffin pan (made 10) and only cooked them 20 minutes.  Turned out great!  I dont see how you could use less than five eggs with the amount of spinach.

I've made this a few times already and it never fails me! LOVE THIS!
I did add more seasoning as others had suggested like nutmeg, garlic salt and basil including sauteed mushrooms and white/green onions.  Also I used a regular cupcake pan and it came out so adorable! Before I popped it into the oven, I placed slices of tomato on top which adds that needed tart compliment and presentation.  This can work well with frozen or fresh spinach, whatever's convenient at the time. :D

Excellent quiche! I made as appetizers baking in mini muffin tins. Followed exactly using Muenster cheese but did add some minced garlic, few dashed red pepper flakes and some freshly grated nutmeg. The nutmeg brought an nice extra layer of flavor to the dish.

Great base recipe. I used cheddar cheese, but next time will use the cheese the recipe calls for. Also, I added ham and a bit of feta cheese to the top. I still gave it five stars even though I changed it up, because I know prepared as is it still would have been fantastic!

yummy!  I used mushrooms, frozen carrots/onion/celery mix, and frozen spinach.  Also used only 1 1/2 cups of cheese and no salt as the cheese was salty enough.  These are perfect when made in a muffin pan!

Wow, this was awesome!  I sauteed the onions in 1 Tbl. butter instead of oil to give it better flavor.  I used only 1 cup of cheese to cut down on the fat. I thought a whole chopped onion would be overkill for such a small quiche, but it wasn't at all! Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious when we had breakfast for dinner one night.  Left out the cheese because we didn't have any and used Tone's chicken base and minced garlic when sauteeing the veggies before adding them into the egg mixture.  Also used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  I just wilted it a bit before adding it.  My gf thought it was the best she ever tasted.

I made these as mini quiche for a shower and they were really good.  I used swiss cheese because that's what I like with spinach but I'm sure that any cheese would work.  Also good to add chopped mushrooms.  Nice flavor.

Added 12 slices of bacon and sauted 8 ounces mushrooms in bacon grease. Greased pan with bacon grease and used 1 cup cheddar cheese to 2 cups mozzarella (did use frozen spinach). Made in an 8 inch round cake pan. Thanks!

Orgional recipe is great but I have made a few alterations for personal taste.  I use 10 oz fresh chopped, sauted spinach, 2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend & 8 oz Feta with basil and tomato.  I prepare it as instructed and serve it topped with fresh diced tomatoes.  So delicious!

Crustless Spinach Quiche Haiku: "Low carbers rejoice! Loaded with eggy-veggie, this is so awesome!" This recipe is very close to something that I make on a weekly basis (5 eggs beaten w/ a variety of veggies and baked in muffin tins for a quick, portioned breakfast), but I wanted a dish more "polished" in appearance to serve for brunch guests. I used 2 packed cups of fresh spinach, and added diced red bell pepper (for some color), as well as some ham, a pinch of nutmeg and a heavy splash of milk. It looked beautiful, and tasted just as good at room temperature. The wonderful part of this recipe is its limitless potential for different ingredients, which is why it's no less than 5-stars!

This was very tatsty.  I've never made a crustless quiche before, and at first my husband thought I screwed up!  I did add more cheese, including moz, and I just finely chopped fresh spinach and threw it in cuz I was feeling lazy.  Next time I'll probably add the turkey bacon I was going to put in...but was feeling too lazy!

This was my first quiche-like recipe. It was delicious. I loved it, and so did my husband and 16 month old son, neither of which I can ever get to eat eggs willingly. But this was at least as much vegetable as it was egg, so it won cheers all around. I love how adaptable it is, too, because I can just use what I have around the house. I used 2 cups of cheese instead of 3, and 6 eggs instead of 5, cooked for 30 minutes at 350, and cooled for 10 minutes before cutting. I also added mushrooms, garlic, and most of a red pepper. I am really proud of how it came out. I cut the leftovers into portions and put half in the freezer and half in the fridge. I plan to make this maybe once a week with alterations to keep it interesting. A definite keeper!

Delicious!  I took others advice and added 2 4 oz cans of drained mushrooms, a can of drained diced tomatoes.  Used 2 packages of spinach and upped the eggs to 8.  Next time I would separate into 2 pie pans.  Took about 50 minutes to set.

Yummy!  I was looking for a recipe to use up extra spinach.  I used 2 green onions, fresh spinach, 2 cups of Muenster.  I cooked it for about 40 minutes before the eggs were set.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband loved this - and he doesn't like onions, so that's saying something. I used fresh spinach, and pepper jack cheese to give it a tiny kick. I think next time I might add a couple of peppers too since we like things spicy. This recipe is nice because it's a great base recipe that you can add easily to. But, personally, my favorite part of quiche is the crust, so it just seemed like a baked omelet to me.

I added mushrooms to this and reduced the cheese by half.  Yum!
_____________________
Edit: 8/30 

I also made this adding leftover crabmeat.  Double yum!  My kids don't even complain about the spinach.
_____________________
Edit: 10/7  

Made this again tonight using Parmesan cheese (only 1 cup), adding a cup of cooked salmon, and sliced mushrooms.

I baked one in a pie dish and the other in an 8x8 square so I can freeze portion-size squares for a quick breakfast option.  

This quiche is definitely a regular at our house!  You can do so much with it!

Wow. This is fantastic!! I used 1/2 onion only because I made a 2nd quiche and used it in that one. 2nd quiche was 5 pieces cooked crumbled bacon, about 3/4 c chopped ham, about 1 1/2 c sharp cheddar cheese, onions and 7 eggs.  I used more eggs due to young chickens still laying small eggs.  Used 6 eggs in spinach quiche.  I was amazed at how good the quiches were.  My daughter and husband loved it.  Leftovers will be great for breakfast!

The great thing about Quiche is that you can use whatever you have on hand as long as you follow the basic recipe.  I added some chopped hot peppers, panchetta, smoked paprika and used a Tex Mex cheese mix that we had left over in the fridge.  I also loved the suggestion to use muffin tins and make small quiches.  I used the 6 large muffin tin and the amount worked out perfect!!!

First time making quiche I found this recipe a great starter! I ended up using 6 eggs to finish off the carton in the fridge. Added two shredded carrots, 3 chopped garlic cloves and about one cup of finely chopped mushrooms. Also ended up using cheddar cheese (all we had in the fridge) and added closer to 4 cups to counter balance all of the extra veggies. It needed closer to 35 minutes to finish baking, but well worth the wait.

This was fabulous! Made a great Christmas brunch egg dish that's sure to become a family favorite for years to come! My pie pans were all "occupied" at the time, so I used 8 eggs and a 9" x 9" square casserole dish instead. Baking time was still 30 minutes. Perfect!

I agree that this is a great low-carb dish. I just used 2 cups of cheese and it was plenty--and this is someone who loves cheese. :-) I also stirred in some milk to the egg mixture, like I was making an omelette. Save a dish: I cooked the onions and spinach in an ovenproof 14" skillet that could accomodate the whole dish. When the veggies were done, I just put the egg & cheese mixture into the skillet, stirred to combine, and baked it just like that. It worked great!

I've tried a lot of recipes on this site and this quiche is at the top of my favorites list! Two ironies:  1) I was never a big fan of quiche before now.  2) I modified it to make it lower in fat... usually doing this makes it taste less than amazing, but not the case here.  I calculated the ingredients to 9 servings because I had a 16 oz bag of frozen spinach on hand and wanted to use it all. Instead of using the 4 1/2 cups of muenster cheese, I used 2 cups of shredded reduced-fat pepper jack cheese, 1 cup lowfat cottage cheese, and 1/2 cup parm cheese. I also added broccoli (2 stalks, no stems) and about 4 oz of chopped mushrooms. Like others recommended, I scooped most of the mix into a muffin tray. There was some mixture leftover so I baked it in a tiny casserole dish.   Everyone loved it!

Absolutely delish!!! I didn't have Muenster cheese so I used 2 cups Gruyere and 1 cup Asiago. I added mushrooms as well.  My husband AND 16 month old son loved it (I made sure the onions and mushrooms were very finely chopped in the food processor).  Will most definitely make again!

This recipe was a hit at our house. Only additions were crumpled bacon,chopped mushrooms and I used egg beaters instead of 5 eggs (1 1/2 cups).Delicious!! I will surely make this again as it is easy and fast and only requires a frypan and pieplate.

This recipe is almost identical to one I have been making for years. However, I do not bake mine. I cook it initially on the gas hob on a low flame until the eggs are just starting to set - without burning the base; I have a stainless steel pan which is perfect for this. Then I add the cheese - usually homemade feta or haloumi - sprinkled on top and place under a preheated gas grill until set and lightly browned. I also add a dash of nutmeg and mushrooms (and anything I have which I feel like adding to the initial saute) as per other reviewers. Very useful dish especially for a quick lunch. Living on a farm, we have our own veggies; this dish is very versatile so I can always find something in season in the garden to add apart from spinach - Swiss chard also works well as long as it is freshly harvested.

I cook something similar but add some cream for richness. The main difference is that I cook in the microwave in a shallow dish. The quiche shrinks from the side of the dish and crisps up a little so that it replicates a quiche made with pastry.

This is absolutely wonderful, so easy and so very tasty. I used half crumbled feta and half cheddar cheese. I've made it in muffin pans and have made it in a slab for get togethers. Every time I make it it disappears in no time at all.

this came out very greasy---i love cheese, but this was a bit off-putting...for the second try, i substituted EggBeaters, used a combination of fat free cheddar and fat free Monterey Jack cheeses, more onion, and a bit of minced garlic---that came out great, and not greasy at all

Very good. Made in 10 inch pie plate.  I used fresh spinach - sauted in pan with a little butter with some mushrooms and onion.  My husband and I enjoyed, daughter did too.

The quiche was tasty but there was far too much spinach.  Next time I will reduce the amount of spinach, add diced red peppers and add some hot sauce for flavor.

I thought it was lacking a little in the seasoning dept so next time I will use more pepper/garlic etc.  I used a combo of cheddar cheese and monterey jack and used crushed ritz crackers on the top for some texture.  It was easy to make so with these additions I would make again.  I served w/ turkey bacon and some fresh fruit for an easy supper.

I was looking for a healthy meal to make tonight and came across this recipe. I added some fresh asparagus and ham cubes that I already had in the fridge. I also used parmasan cheese and only used half of what the recipe called for. It came out beautifully and it was delicious. Even my burger loving boyfriend enjoyed it

This recipe is the best. I have used many recipes from allrecipes and this is my first review. I am a breakfast person. I love eggs, potatoes, bacon, everything that has to do with breakfast. I am trying to eat healthy and so I made the quiche as written only I used 2 cups fat free sharp cheddar, 1 cup regular sharp cheddar and egg beaters. The quiche was yummy. I even tried it in the microwave the next day and it was just as yummy  Pat

Very good & super easy. Used a cheddar/jack mix just b/c I had a bag of the pre-shredded, so I think that it was less than 3 cups also. I will definitely make again & am freezing half of it so I'm interested to see how it does with freezing!

This was a hit!  Served it for Sunday brunch to my sister & brother-in-law (visiting us) and she even asked for the recipe!  I substituted sharp cheddar for Muenster (had it on hand) and added one more egg.  With our high altitude (6750') I cooked it 10 minutes longer and it was perfect!  I'm fixing it again tomorrow for my Charity Craft group and adding cooked & crumbled bacon.  My hubby wants to try it with Swiss & ham with mushrooms.................

Great for breakfast.  My only complaint was they stuck to my muffin pan (even after spraying).  Next time I am going to make them in those individual little meat pie pie trays and I think that will do the trick.  The flavor was terrific!

This was a great basic quiche.  I needed something quick and easy and that called for ingredients I had on hand.  I used fresh spinach and just cooked it up with the onion.  I also had a little cottage cheese that I threw in as well as shredded mozzerella and mild cheddar.  Came out great!

This was a great recipe, thank you it is a new favorite!!  I tried to cut out some fat so I used 10 egg whites, and 2 cups of a reduced fat cheese.  I added 6oz chopped 98% fat free ham for flavor.  It was wonderful, we ate it for breakfast for days.

OK, I've never made quiche before, so I was a little nervous. This was the best quiche I've EVER eaten and I do mean EVER! I made a few modifications by using 1/2 onion, only 2 cups cheese (1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese 1/2 cup mozz cheese)and added one small roma tomato. I baked it for 28 mins, and it was perfect. My 14 year old daughter even went back for seconds! If you are thinking about making this recipe, then do it, because you will not be sorry.

Great recipe that I've made two weekends in a row now, and gotten compliments from everybody who tried it.  I followed another persons idea and baked it in muffin cups.  I used 8 eggs, only two cups of cheese (swiss), green onion instead of normal onion, and diced up some ham.  This amount of ingredients fit perfectly into 12 muffin cups.  They store really well too, 60 seconds in the microwave and tastes just like it was out of the oven.

This recipe was a huge success. I doubled the recipe and did one pie pan "crustless" and poured the other half in a "Cream Cheese Tart Shell" (pre-baked) topped with a bit of cheese and cooked country sausage. People were scrapping their plates clean and asking for the recipe. Will definitely be making this regularly for breakfast/brunch with company!!

Awesome! I had medium eggs so I added an extra egg (total of 5 eggs). I also added diced ham, some chopped mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. I sauteed all the veggies with the oil from the sundried tomato bottle. Also added some roasted red pepper and garlic powder. Used cheddar cheese. I used the muffin tray to make mini quiches for appys. Froze half of it. Good on its own or as a side dish or to make a wrap. Will surely make these again. SO easy.

I have also made this recipe using different cheeses; for example:

1 cup mozzarella
1 cup parmesan
1 monterrey jack

plus I only use egg whites (maybe one yolk) to make it healthier.

Tastes delicious!

I made this quiche for company as a labor day "brunch" item. It was a huge hit. It proves you do not need crust. I took some tips from others and cut the cheese to 2 cups using 1 1/4c organic shredded cheddar and 3/4c ff cottage cheese. The cottage cheese gives a more creamy texture. To cut some more calories I used 3 egg beaters and 2 organic eggs. I sauteed the leeks ( little zestier than onions), fresh organic spinach and arugala chopped, and shitake mushroms in Organic Pam with some chopped garlic. Seasoning the mixture with red pepper flakes, ground lemon pepper and garlic powder puts in the final touch. I suggest serving it with a freshly baked breakfast bread ( I baked apple/cinnamon) and a fresh fruit salad. This will wow your guests.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. He ate 1/2 of the pie plate worth. I added some ham and tomatoes to get rid of them. I also added some garlic and flour per other suggestions. I then added some bread crumbs on top to get rid of them also. I had to cook it longer than expected but it turned out great. Thanks for yet another great recipe!

I doubled this recipe for Easter brunch and it was a huge hit.  Followed some previous suggestions like adding a generous splash of milk or 1/2 and 1/2 and using less of the spinach and about a cup less of the cheese.  If you follow the original recipe exactly, you get a very dense, spinach heavy quiche.  The milk and less cheese give it a lighter, and fluffier texture more like a true quiche (in my opinion) should be.  I also added sundried tomatoes and a cup of frozen (but thawed) artichoke hearts for added color and flavor.  Like another reviewer, I thought thinly sliced tomatoes on top added nice presentation.  This is a very easy dish to prepare even if you aren't much of a cook.  If you use a glass pan as I did, be sure to grease it well with plenty of butter as the quiche will stick otherwise.

I just made this for a  brunch and doubled it. Cooked it in an tinfoil 10x12 pan.It came out perfect. I could not find munster cheese so I used cheddar and cheddar blend. I also made it the night before and cooked it in the morning. Perfect.

Excellent and easy.  Might try chopped broccoli next time as one reviewer suggested.  Add whatever spices or extra flavors to suit individual tastes, but it makes a nice meatless dinner as well as a breakfast.  Good with canned mushrooms and just about any kind of cheese.  This will become one of my 'regulars'.

I changed the servings to 2, and put in one egg and one egg white.  I also used 2% Mexican mix shredded cheese, 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon of cream cheese as I did not have Muenster cheese.  It was very good.  My husband liked it, and I will make it again.  It is about 4 points for Weight Watchers.

Easy and delicious!  Used 2C sharp cheddar goat cheese and 3 eggs, 2 egg whites.  Held up very well without a crust.

This recipe was so good and so easy to make. I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of muenster, and I also used fresh chopped spinach with an additional cup of chopped mushrooms. I baked the quiche using a 12-muffin pan instead of the pie pan for exactly 30 minutes and they were perfect.

Absolutely wonderful!  It was so easy and everyone loved it. I did double the recipe and put in a 13x9 pan for about 30 minutes.  I also made it the night before and cooked it in the morning so it would be easier. I am going to bring it to work now. I've made this many times, but this time I decided to substitute 2 cups of low fat ricotta cheese for 2 of the 6 cups of cheese. It was fabulous.

WOW..everyone in my house went nuts over this quiche.  I replaced some of the shredded cheese with ricotta and added garlic, crushed red pepper, and imitation crab meat.  I will def. make this again, especially if I'm having company:)

This was delicious! I used part skim mozza cheese and cut the amount down to approximately 2 cups; I also added mushrooms that I sauteed with the onions...they really added something.

This was really good but it was too salty for me.It was probably the cheese so the next time I make this,I won't put any salt and will reduce the amount of cheese.

Delicious!  You won't even miss the crust!  I added one red bell pepper and used two cups of mild cheddar and one cup of mozzarella.  It tasted even better reheated in the microwave the next day.  Great for stay-over guests.

Perfect! 5 star taste and texture, especially after I added some garlic powder to the spinach. Very nice in its simplicity, I wouldn't go adding lots of stuff to it. My quiche dish is quite large so this came out quite thin but it's not a huge problem. It'll make it easy to double the recipe if necessary. As it stands, I think it feeds 3 people as a main cours. UPDATE: Here's a nice idea for the leftovers. I cut a poppy seed bagel in half, toasted and buttered the top, layered the bottom wih squares of the quiche (as I said, mine was very thin) and cheese and toasted it in the oven. Put the two halves back together and ate it with garden tomatoes on the side. It was great!

EXCELLENT RECIPE, especially for low-carb dieters.  You won't even miss the crust!  I added some mushrooms, which were sauteed with the onions ahead of time to remove excess moisture.  I also added some crumbled bacon to the bottom of the pie pan before scooping the egg mixture in.  To compensate for the extra ingredients, I added 2 extra eggs.  It was FANTASTIC!  Muenster is the PERFECT cheese for this recipe because of its creamy texture and subtle flavor.  You must try it!  To find shredded Muenster is impossible (it is usually only sold in slices).  However, you can go to the deli section of your grocery store to ask them to cut off a 1-lb. "brick" of Muenster for you.  It's worth the effort.

We had a birthday breakfast buffet at work today so I decided to make this.

I made two small adjustments. I added minced garlic with the onions and to the final mixture I added some roasted red peppers for color. I put it in the pie pan in the fridge overnight then baked it this morning.

It looked so pretty and tasted even better! Everyone commented on how good it was!

This quiche couldn't have been easier to make and it was a crowd pleaser. I will definitely make this again.

Yummy!  My take: fresh spinach, about half a 8oz very finely shredded white cheddar (it virtually disappeared with the eggs, two cloves of garlic sauteed with the onions, and one jarred roasted red pepper.  Can't wait to try more variations.

I loved this quiche!!! I recently began the south beach diet and wanted something that's a quick breakfast fix and decided to try this recipe.  I did make some substitutions, used green onions and added minced garlic and mushrooms to the saute step and used 2 cups cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  YUMMY...will definitely make again.

This was so delicious! I made individual portions by pooring the mixture into grease muffin tins. They were perfect for my friend's bridal shower!  I also added choppped red pepper and cut back a tad on the cheese.  I will definitely be making this again!

What an easy and delicious quiche!  Had to substitute broccoli for the spinach.  Didn't have Muenster either, so I used 2 Cups shredded Cheddar and 1 Cup Mozzarella as per another reviewer.  My hubby said it was 'GREAT!' after the first bite.  And, yes, this could be the perfect base for other ingredients.  Thank you Susan!!

Delicious and healthy!  I added several dashes of Tabasco to the eggs and used EggBeaters instead of regular eggs to cut the calories. Also, took another's advice and pour egg mixture over the vegetable mixture.

This is a wonderful crustless quiche.  I substituted liquid egg substitute evenly for the 5 eggs and used fat free cream cheese instead of whole fat muenster for a very low calorie breakfast.  My husband loves for me to make this quiche on Sunday and we just reheat a slice each morning for a wholesome, hot breakfast!

Yum!  This was good and very easy to make.  I made minor changes:  I used 2 cups Munster and one cup Mozzarella (just because I had it in the house), an extra egg (cause mine were pretty small and it seemed a bit dry), and a sprinkling of nutmeg as per others' suggestions.  It turned out delicious.  I served w/fruit salad and warmed sourdough bread.  EXCELLENT.

I served this a side dish for a diabetic using lowfat cheddar (2 cups), and egg beaters. I replaced the spinach with a 10 oz package of chopped broc. It was delicious. I will definitely try this again with spinach. Ideal for breakfast as well.

This an excellent recipe! I made it twice in one week.  First time with swiss, second with cheddar.  Both times I've ommitted the spinach, which I love, but will add spinach next time.  I've also added cooked, roll breakfast sausage.  I did use 6 eggs because it seemed like it needed one extra.  This is an extremely versatile recipe that will work well with just about any cheese and extras you add to it.  Very quick and very delicious!!  5 stars all the way!!!

This method nails it every time. I make it a lot, especially more often now that I’m more keto based. I will switch up the ingredients sometimes and add black olives and mushrooms. Have added artichokes, jalapeños, anything you want really. If you add more wet ingredients, it just takes a little longer to cook. Just keep an eye on it.

Did it exactly as the recipe states... Delicious!!! And my first time making a quiche.  The second time I used a pound fresh spinach in place of frozen, and wilted it in a skillet, leaves chopped and stems removed, before starting the recipe.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe!! I like to follow a recipe exactly as it is written the first time I make it, THEN decide if I want to make any changes the next time I prepare it. This is an excellent recipe as it is written; simple, delicious and definitely a keeper! One of the reasons I love this recipe is because it is so easy to "mix it up" by changing the vegetable and cheese combinations. Be versatile and choose a combination of ingredients based on your preferences....broccoli, mushrooms, bacon, etc. The second time I made this recipe, I did make changes based simply on MY preferences and dietary habits. I used olive oil to saute the onion and fresh spinach (although frozen is just fine). I substituted the  Muenster cheese with 2 cups of Monterey Jack cheese and 1 cup of Pepper Jack cheese (grating the cheese rather than using pre-packaged) to give it a bit of a kick. I have made and shared this recipe with many, many people because not only is it delicious, but also because everyone loves the simplicity and flexibility of this recipe. I also usually double the recipe so there will be left-overs to reheat for a hurried Monday morning breakfast :)

Very good and easy. I used 2 cups cheese(mozzarella & mild cheddar). I added 1/2 c chopped mushrooms, 5 garlic chopped cloves, an extra egg & 2 Tbspn oregano; I drained the spinach well with paper towels and squeezing; added 1 tbspn butter after cooking onions and mushrooms; I doubled the recipe and made the recipe in foil muffin papers.

Used 8 oz pkg of swiss that I then shredded(all I had). Delish!

I also tried the recipe using half a large (Sams) container of spinach with a Vidalia onion.  Used a tsp of red pepper flakes, 3 cups of shredded mex mix cheese, 1 1/2 c. of shredded rotisserie chicken and baked in lg sauté pan for 30 min. Excellent,
without the chicken it's about 1700 calories for the entire quiche.

I have made this quiche several times - I have always baked the quiche in cupcake pans so it's easier to serve or freeze and take out at a later time. This recipe is by far the best spinach quiche recipe I've ever had

All I can say is YUM!! This is a delish recipe!!!!i added my few special twists of course such as: I minced a few mushrooms and added them into the quiche (I love mushrooms in quiche!), I used mozzarella cheese (my favourite), I added a few spices: like dill and oregano, and for a pretty touch: sprinkled a bit of ground cheddar cheese on top! With these small changes, it was HEAVENLY! Thank you for sharing the recipe! :p excuse me, I have to go devour the other half with my family now :) mmmmmmm so good!

Trying to reduce carbs and didn't miss the crust one bit.  A tad bland - will probably double the pepper next time.  Plus would add a sixth egg and cut down on the cheese a bit.  But definitely proof that you don't need a crust for a delicious quiche.

Delicious! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also substituted the muenster cheese with a combination of Romano, Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Lastly, I used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Next time I think I might add mushrooms.

It was good.  However, the cook time was much longer than what the recipe said.  It took close to an hour to bake...also I needed much more prep time, but I don't work fast.

As written, just OK, but excellent with extra egg, less spinach and 2 cups of cheese and additions like seasonings, cooked turkey sausage, other veggies.  Thanks for posting and for all the comments.  This is a wonderful versatile low carb dish with protein, fat and veggies and it is supposed to freeze well.

Awesome. A lot of flexibility with the ingredients. I just used broccoli and spinach and mozzarella. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out delicious. Keep an eye on it in the oven, it only took about 20 minutes in the oven for me because I used a wider pan.

I have made this a number of times, but usually substitute the 3 cups of Muenster for an 8oz package. Also good is to saute some fresh mushrooms along with the onion. My most recent modification was to actually use one of the pie crusts I use for my other quiche recipes.
Laugh all you want...it was delicious.

Delicious - I did not like to saute the onions first - I like them to have a bit of crunch.  I added some Italian herbs and crushed red chilies as well as a red jalapeno.  You do not need to add any salt.  The cheese has enough salt for the dish.  I used a blend of organic cheddar cheeses - feta would be really good too. Fresh spinach works well just saute and allow to cool. I also wanted to serve this in square pieces with more height so I added an extra egg and baked it in a square glass 8x8 baking dish. Worked great! Easy

I don't even like quiche, but this turned out great. I followed the recipe except I used 2 cups of shredded Mozzarella, as well as 7 cups of fresh spinach (which is about 2 1/4 cups chopped). I highly recommend adding some sort of meat like ham or bacon.

Instant hit! Like some other reviewers, I added a couple vegetables: mushrooms and olives. I used 1/3 of a yellow onion but still thought the onion overpowered the dish and would use less next time. I used sea salt, and I forgot to buy shredded cheese and was inspired by some of the reviewers, so I "grated" muenster and sharp cheddar in a food processor and used both in the dish. The quiche was delicious and still yummy for leftovers the next day!

Great base recipe!  I added fresh sauteed mushrooms & 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onion, a handful of diced ham and used 2 c of Muenster and 1 c of sharp cheddar (I may switch those ratios next time).  Topped the quiche with halved cherry tomatoes before baking.  Baked it longer (40 min) until the edges looked done and slightly browned.  We are on a low carb diet and didn't even miss the crust one bit.  Very flavorful as is yet I will be experimenting with other add ins in the future.

I think this recipe is great as is and you can add to it easily.  I sautéed the onion with cut up mushrooms and 1 9oz bag of fresh spinach. I also always use plain cheddar cheese. Nothing weird should happen to it, flat or tall or whatever if you follow the directions. My kids gobble this up!

I've been making this recipe for years. It's delicious. The only difference is that I cook hash brown potatoes and then mix it in the mixture before baking. Helps the quiche stay together and gives it a touch of deliciousness.

I made one third of the recipe in a tiny skillet, no oven required. Also replaced Munster with mozzarella cheese, and added a clove of garlic. Amazing flavor.

This was fabulous!  I omitted the onions, and only used 2 cups of cheddar, but it was still great! I think next time I will try the full 3 cups with sharp cheddar, because I felt like a stronger cheese would enhance it even more.  I may also try adding bacon. It reheated well, and I ate on it all week. The hubs even tried it.  Will definitely make again! Thanks!

I substitute egg whites for 3 of the eggs, and use some low fat feta to replace some of the cheese.  I could not be happier with this recipe!

This quiche was excallent, IMO.  I ended up using less cheese (probably only used two cups, which was just right for us).  I also added 1/4 C milk, like another poster suggested.  This made the quiche moister and fluffier.  I used cupcake liners and a cupcake pan to bake (same temperature and time as suggested) and they were the perfect size portions.  I made this for brunch and it was a great menu item, and easy for kids to serve themselves, and the adults loved them too.  One last thought, next time I make these in the cupcake liners, I would spray a little cooking spray to the papers, as they did stick just a little bit.  Overall, LOVED this recipe and will make it again.

Super easy!  My son loved it.  Made it with only 2 cups sharp cheddar as that's all I had and fresh spinach.  Turned out beautifully.

Just made this according to directions and ate a piece. I'm a bit disappointed. I expected this to be incredible. Especially for the amount of cheese that was in it. But it really just turned out ok. I might keep the recipe around as a base, but will not be making it the same way again. It needed something. Pesto? Tomato? Garlic? It was just off.

Follow MommyFromSeattle's suggestions - I did except I cooked the spinach for a bit with the onions. It came out great! Served with crusty bread and a salad for our meatless Monday.

Yum, used a bit less spinach (also used fresh instead of frozen) and used 2 cups mozzarella and a small container of ricotta and it was amazing. Made a triple batch for a bridal shower brunch and everyone thought it was catered.

Love this recipe. So much flavor and the spinach didn't overpower it. I added a bit of garlic and nutmeg but those were the only changes. Great recipe!

The spinach amount was perfect.  I baked them in a Duncan Hines mini loaf pan/brownie pan (each loaf is about 2.5 x 3.75). I love the pan because it's like a muffin pan but there are 8 mini loaves instead.  The mini quiches baked up perfectly, not too much spinach at all and they are a great size for breakfast.  I doubled the recipe and made it with eggbeaters and light sharp cheese, it made 10 filled to the rim mini loaves that are about 288 calories each and are perfectly filling with just one.

I loved this quiche!  I'm on Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet so I needed an alternative to boring old eggs and this was great.  So easy to make and great reheated.  I sauteed onion, garlic, red pepper and mushroom before adding the spinach.  Also only used two cups of cheese, 1 reduced fat cheddar and 1 reduced fat feta and it was perfect.  I would definitely recommend...did not miss the crust...yay!

This was pretty good. I added a few cloves of garlic to the onion, and used monterey jack cheese. I did think this was a bit too cheesy, next time I'll try using less cheese.

Quiche with crust can taste so heavy if the crust is real flaky and buttery. So I loved this without the crust. I used fresh spinach (about half a bag I think), couple cloves of garlic, diced bell pepper, shredded zucchini. Sauteed all of that with the onion. Then to the egg/cheese mix, I added pepperoni. It was great!

Delicious gluten free/primal meal. Had pork sausage on the side. I cut back on cheese by one cup (used swiss and mozarella) just because it seemed like plenty. I used olive oil for the pie pan and cooking onions. So quick and easy. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious.  I threw in a cup of chopped ham and a little red pepper.  The Muenster is fab!  Even better the next day.  Served with fresh cherry tomatoes.

This was very good! I didn't have Muenster so I used a Mexican blend. I used a spring form pan which made the presentation nice. I wrapped the leftovers wedges and put in the frig to be reheated for breakfast later in the week. I liked the fact it had no crust Thank you!

This quiche was perfect for Mother's Day! My family is trying to watch our carbs and sugar so it was great to have a quiche that didn't really need a crust to make it spectacular. I almost opted for a different cheese instead of the Muenster but went with it anyway and it really tasted amazing. Definitely adding this to my favorites.

I went the mini quiche route (took the comment advice about making them in muffin tins - genius!)
I also added garlic, pepperjack cheese and used 1 1/4 cups egg beaters instead of 5 eggs.. 

I got SO many great comments on it!

My mother & I really enjoyed this, we added fresh mushrooms to it. The recipe is too much for the 2 of us. I cut it into 6 servings, & for us to have over the course of 2 dinners, (& then some)  Idk if it's freezable, but next time I'll adjust it to make 4 servings instead.

This is awesome and very popular with my friends.  Make sure to drain the spinach really well because extra moisture can make the quiche soggy.  I usually use a little more spinach than the recipe calls for.

first attempt at quiche.  Have always been too nervous to even try.  Mine turned out a tiny bit too soft in the middle but that was my fault for not getting all of the liquid out of onions and fresh (not frozen) spinach.  So easy, wish I would have tried making this years ago.

This quiche is so simple and delicious!! I use 8 cups of fresh, chopped spinach in place of the frozen, and I also throw in some garlic with the onions. I just use whatever cheese we have on hand. Other additions that I've tried are mushrooms and ham. The first time I made this I put the quiche into mini muffin tins and it turned out great. Thanks so much for sharing!!

Loved it.  Only thing I changed was the cheese type - didn't have that much muenster so used a combination of muenster, chedddar and cottage cheese.  Looking forward to making it again and playing with different additives like garlic, tomatoes, maybe broccoli or artichokes!  From reading other reviews it sounds very versitle.

I eliminated the oil and one cup of cheese from this recipe and added chopped ham and garnished the unbaked quiche with halved cherry tomatoes. Delicious!

I love this recipe! I've tweaked it a bit, but that's what's so great about this recipe you can change it to suit you and what you like. I changed the cheese to Italian shredded cheese mix, added basil, cilantro, garlic, mushrooms, bell peppers, breakfast sausage, and whatever else I feel like, as long as it all fits in the pan. It's always a big hit, even one picky guest turned it down because she doesn't like spinach but after taking a bite from a friend's plate she went back for her own piece. I like to serve it Christmas morning when the family is over for presents, especially with red bell peppers in it so it has a festive red and green look to it.

Added some honey smoked ham, which added a nice sweet/salty flavor to it.  Also used swiss cheese instead of muenster.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.

I just made this recipe, and it is, as the others here have said, delicious and very adaptable. I used 1.5 packs of frozen spinach, because I love the green stuff. I added some shitake mushrooms, about half of a green pepper, and a hint more salt. I didn't have Muenster, so I used about 2.25 cups of shredded low fat mozza-cheddar cheese, and a few crumbles of feta.  

I placed the mixture in 6 jumbo muffin tins over night and baked them this morning. I had a bit more moisture than I should have (my fault), so I baked for maybe 10 more minutes than stated. These were perfect! And they would certainly be ideal for sharing...should they last that long.

I'd actually give it a zero star review. I made this recipe to the T except the only thing I changed was that that I used the kraft italino four cheese. The cheese tasted just fine but the spinach mixture was not to my liking! Definitly not the recipe for me.

Fantastic recipe. I used 2 cups of sharp cheddar instead of the Gruyere & blended the sauteed onion since I don't like onion pieces, but no other modifications. It's absolutely delicious, easy to make, and results in a fantastic presentation. I found I didn't miss the crust at all.

The only reason I am giving this four stars is because I changed it up a little. I used 6 eggs, 2 cups of parmesan cheese, a can of mushrooms,and red pepper flakes. The spinach is just right on time, this was so freaking yummy!!! I will be making this often. This is a dish to impress =)

Foolproof, easy, and delicious.

The Husband loves spinach, and one of our frequent breakfast guests is a no-carbs kind of guy.  Thus, this is my go-to breakfast for both of them.  It's super easy to make...in fact, I usually make it the night before (all but the cooking), cover it in foil and store it in the fridge.  Those who choose to follow this example would do well to take it out of the fridge about 15-20 before cooking or to leave it in the oven a little longer.  

Many sorts of cheese work.  I often go for a jack/cheddar blend.

I also usually add a handful or two of diced ham (a cup or so).  Diced Canadian bacon or sausage also works.  I've also been known to toss in some sliced black olives.

One of the most enjoyable things about this dish is that leftovers can be saved and served...either warmed up or cold.  

This one's a keeper!

Great for the low-carbers out there! This recipe is so versatile. I usually add in some minced carrots and cubed ham, use a 2-cup bag of shredded colby-jack cheese (our favorite), use a full 16-oz bag of thawed and squeezed frozen chopped spinach. If needed, I'll add more egg (Eggbeaters and egg whites are great, too), and will just shake in extras of garlic powder, salt and pepper. Onion powder also works. We eat this weekly!

Made for a breakfast at wimbledon party we had earlier this month.  Made as stated, but there was not enough egg to cover the spinach mixture so i added 2 more eggs.  i also added a little chopped garlic.  i used a 16oz block of cheese and shredded it myself. it was better than the cheddar sausage egg casserole i made!

This recipe is fantastic.  I did a few things differently and I just love the flavor.  I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, 1/2 a chopped red onion, only 4 eggs, 1/2 a red bell pepper and 1/2 a yellow bell pepper chopped, and 2 cups mixture of shredded sharp cheddar and shredded taco cheese.  I also did a few shakes of onion powder and garlic powder. This recipe is SO easy and has great flavor, and is so colorful when using the bell peppers!  Definitely one of my new favorite breakfast dishes.

It was okay.  Kind of bland from the lack of seasoning.  But it has potential.  I would attempt this again, but I would add some different veggies and some more seasonings, like garlic powder and cayenne pepper maybe.  Good base recipe though.

Who needs crust?  This is packed with wonderful flavor, and texture, and it holds together well.  I added green chile for a little heat.

Not the best quiche ever, but definitely really good. I think it would get 5 stars if there were other flavors in the recipe, and I also think some of the cheese should be reserved to sprinkle over the top. Otherwise, great base recipe.

Really good!  I added about 1/2c Bisquik mix since we like things a little more set up and used cheddar since we always have it on hand. Made a nice easy dinner with some salad on the side. Even my 4 year old liked it!

1 1/2 cups asiago cheese (3 seemed like way too much) + 1/2 cup crumbled bacon + 1/2 teaspoon gourmet mustard = 10 stars!
I also added an extra egg and used fresh spinach.  No added salt but lots of fresh garlic made this wonderful...

excellent recipe. Worked great for Easter Brunch especially for my sis-in-law who has a gluten allergy. I made a quasi-double batch, using only 3-1/2 cups of mexican blend cheese and 8 eggs. Everything else I doubled. Oh, I also added a pinch of fresh nutmeg & 1/2 of a julienned, lightly sauteed red bell pepper for  the very top. perfect.

I love this recipe because its so easy to prepare & make. Its a cheap, healthy meal for college students and you can really add just about anything you want in it to spruce it up. I recommend throwing in more veggies likes mushrooms and tomato.

Incredible and easy! I used olive oil instead of veg oil, fresh spinach from the farmers market and mozzarella cheese (around 2.5 cups, which was plenty.) I also added a tiny pinch of nutmeg per suggestions. I used a glass pie pan and lightly greased it with a little butter. SO tasty! I am definitely adding this one to the vault!

I'm doing low carb and this is as low carb as you get.  About 5 net carbs per serving (which comes from the onion and spinach).  I made it for the first time today following the instructions exactly and it was delicious!  Tasted just like a spinach quiche should without, of course, the crust!  It was wonderful!

THIS. WAS. FABULOUS! Easy to make & bake, and dissapeared in one day in my 2 person household! (My boyfriend ate nothing else yesterday; I made 3 of his favorite dishes and all he ate was this quiche!) I had to substitute cheeses b/c I goofed & was out of muenster. I used 1 1/2 c swiss, 1/4 c mozzerella/provelone mix, and 1 1/4 c reduced fat cheddar. I will be making this over and over and over again so I look forward to using munster, but this recipe is as forgiving as it is EXCELLANT!!! Less than 24 hours later, I 'm making another one now.  **UPDATE** I've made this several times with many variations on cheese & even adding crab meat. Tastey & forgiving as long as you have 3 c of some kind of shredded cheese. :) Fantastic.

Awesome & delicious! I did use cheddar cheese as many other suggested and only 2 cups of it. Added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder to the egg mixture also. Next time I may use the muenster cheese though to see how it is. I loved this and it was the perfect low-carb dish I was looking for.
Reheats well too, really yummy for lunch or breakfast the next day!

Really great flavor and so easy to put together. I added some nutmeg because I really like that with spinach. I used less cheese - maybe just 2 cups - a mixture of Italian blend & Sharp Cheddar because that's what I had on hand. 

My only complaint is that I tried to make these bite size by using a mini-muffin tin (recipe turns out 32 mini quiches). Even though I have a non-stick pan and used PAM spray, they were still very difficult to remove and the presentation suffered. If I made them again, I would use this filling with a crust.

Excellent low carb version of the original quiche. I changed the recipe slightly and used half an onion and sauteed with a couple of cloves of fresh garlic then added fresh spinach (about 2 large handfuls) and a cup of mushrooms until the spinach was wilted. I then made a custard with 3 eggs and half a cup of milk and grated a cup and a half of sharp cheddar.  It turned out perfectly.  My 2 1/2 yr old even ate ever bite of her slice.

Made this for dinner using cheddar and parmesan cheese (didn't have muenster).  Added cubed cooked chicken, minced garlic, and canned mushrooms.   It was a great way to get the family to eat veggies!!

I served this for Christmas brunch and to say that it was a bit hit would be an understatement.  I’ve never seen people eat so fast so they can get seconds! It really was a nice dish; I think it was the Muenster cheese that made it different than most Quiche.  Differently going to be making this one again, and soon!

Made this in muffin pan as other reviewers suggested. Perfection!! I used a cup of low fat cottage cheese and 1 cup half mozarella and sharp cheddar (mistake!) and also 1/4 cup parmesan. Added a can of diced tomatoes & green chiles (drained). I used the garden blend egg beaters and half the pkg of spinach. The problem with the sharp cheddar was that it took over the flavor. I don't know if that's bad or good, depends on your outlook on cheese, I guess. I will definitely make this again.

My first quiche and I'm so proud of myself.  I used mozzarella, parmesean and cheddar cheeses. Fantastic! Sliced tomatoes on top..served with a little salsa. Great lowcarb meal...breakfast, lunch OR dinner. Even my boyfriend wants to try it...he's 64 and NEVER had quiche before.  LOL

WOW!! Great recipe, will make this one again and again.  I used two cups mozzerella and one cup sharp cheddar cheese, I think any cheese would be good in this one.  Six eggs. And I cut up one large tomato and it gave it some very nice flavor. Mushrooms would be a good addition as well.

This was great, but mine needed much more salt than the recipe called for.  So I would suggest to those who want to make this recipe, don't forget to taste it to see if it needs more salt.

I made a diet friendly version of this that turned out great. I used egg beaters, and reduced fat cheese (try some of the pre-shredded kraft or sargento ones from the grocery store). I used sharp cheddar and reduced fat feta. I used spinach and asparagus instead of the onions, I bet you could also reduce the spinach in water if you wanted instead of the oil to reduce fat content further. I poured it into pam-sprayed muffin tins. Excellent!

We made this for dinner last night. IT WAS SO, SO GOOD! So filling, and so satisfying!!! I didn't have Munster cheese, so we used cheddar/jack cheese combo. I just had a leftover piece for breakfast. YUMMY. Thanks for the great recipe - I will be making it often :-)

This is a great recipe, my family loves it, you don't even miss the crust. I have used other kinds of cheese such as swiss or cheddar which are just as good. I like to add a little sweet red pepper with the onion for color. I also use less egg yolks (use 7 eggs, but only 3 yolks) to cut back on cholesterol.

Love this, tastes great and very healthy.  I added more onions than called for and less muenster cheese to make it healthier (I used 3 slices of chopped muenster).  Will definitely make this again, would be great with ham too

You will NOT miss the crust in this quiche!  Yummy!  Had to cater a breakfast that had some people that had to have a gluten-free diet.  THEY loved it.  I LOVE it...  I will make it again.  Nuff said!

Great, versatile recipe!  To make it a bit healthier I used 4 eggs and 1 egg white, 1 cup each of 2% sharp cheddar and mozzerella, and some garlic to the half of an onion I had.  I also diced up a lone roma tomato I had and added that to the spinach mixture when it was almost ready to combine with the eggs and cheese.  I served it with Fluffy Whole Wheat Biscuits from this site.  A definite keeper!

I've made this a few times with slightly less cheese and it always comes out great! I used FRESH spinach (trimmed of stems of course) by sautéing w/ a tiny bit of olive oil and with the onions (saute onions first!).  Then, I put it on a plate to cool. Once cool, I gently squeeze out some of the juice and add to the egg and cheese mixture. Then I add 1 teaspoon of flour.  I think this helps keep the quiche from being "watery." I've found frozen spinach to come out watery a few times (but if you squeeze it enough it will be fine).  My mother suggested that I use melted butter to coat the glass pan and sprinkle w/ parmesan before adding the egg mixture.  I liked that idea.  If you use a smoked cheese like smoked gouda, it gives the quiche a meat-like flavor that I like.  A tip of what not to do (in my opinion) is add black olives--- I usually

This was great---I added the crust to this recipe (I know it's the unhealthy part!!) So simple and easy. Cut back on spinach and replaced cheese with Colby and Parmesan (next time I will use a white cheese) Husband loved it!

My husband and I loved this dish.  He is a recent vegetarian and I am experimenting with new things.  Also, we live in China, so it's not always easy to find the ingredients I need.  I actually used cheddar, mozzarella, and smoked gouda and topped it with fresh parmesan.  Since I was short one egg, I added 1/4 c. of milk.  I also added red peppers.  These were all things I had in the refrigerator.  This recipe was a real winner!

This recipe is great! I made them in muffin tins filled 3/4 full to make single servings then freeze and pop in microwave in the morning..sooo good!  I used the muenster chz perfect blend of flavors (also added just a little sweet pepper for color and added flavor).  This is a great way to get protein and vegtables first thing in the morning.  Hubby loves them too.

This is a terrific basic recipe.  I added a Mexican flair by substituting pepper jack cheese for the cheese and added 1 T of fresh minced jalapeno.  Then topped each serving with sour cream and some green tomatillo salsa and cilantro sprig.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  Thank you.

I loved this recipe. I read some of the suggestions and it came out perfect. I added chopped baby Bella mushrooms and chopped jalopenos when I sauteed the onions. I used 1/2 box of frozen spinach, about 1 cup of muenster cheese and about 2 tbsp of shreddded parm cheese. I also added cooked bacon and chopped tomatoes before baking. I used 1 egg, 1/2 cup of liquid  egg whites and a splash of milk. I put the mixture in a regular sized muffin pan (12 muffins) and baked at 350. Awesome!

Sounds like a fritatta to me.I have onelike it many times. For my ingredients I omit the spinach but add mushrooms add precooked bacon bits (conveniently available in a package) medium salsa which helps the egg mixture to remain moist and grated 4 cheese mixture, some added in and the rest on top to broil for two minutes just before serving.

This is a great basic recipe. You can use any veggie and cheese that you need to get out of your fridge. I like to use 2 cups of cheese and 4 eggs. I often omit the oil and cook the onion with a slice of chopped bacon. I've made variations of this for breakfast, lunch and dinner with great results every time.

This is a great basic recipe. I have made it many times with different variations, and always have people asking me for the recipe. This morning I added diced red & yellow bell peppers, shredded carrots & some garlic in the pan with the onions. We like it a bit thinner with crispy edges, so I bake it in a 9x13 for a just a few minutes longer than it calls for. YUM!

Very very good. and easy! I added peppers and tomatoes to the onions, would highly recommend tomatoes - goes great with spinach. Also used a combination of cheddar and swiss because i didn't have any muenster. Very appetizing, quick, easy, and cheap! We have eaten for breakfast and also for dinner.

I just made this and I'm eating it as I type!  It is absolutely delicious.  I was afraid a whole onion was going to be too much, but it is wonderful.  I used shredded cheddar instead of muenster and it is yummers.

I used one cup fat free cottage cheese, one cup spicy pepper jack, and one cup low-fat Italian blend for the cheese.  I thought it was really good.  The only place I like spinach is in a quiche and this is a much healthier option than the kind with the crust.

I have been cooking for over 40 years, and consider myself to be skilled - can't quite figure out how such a simple recipe can yield the most superb results.  The proportions of ingredients are perfect, wonderful reheated, and this is an all-around keeper recipe.  Marvelous!

We used a combination of other cheeses and it worked out very nicely. We also added some garlic to the onions. I think we'll be redoing this recipe with different ingredients for years to come!

Delicious. Although I'm sure the original recipe is excellent, I too made a couple of changes, like some of the other contributors. Perhaps these helped because of cooking at high altitude (New Mexico).   At the last minute, I decided to add about 1/2 cup cooked brown rice to the mixture, which seemed a little too moist, and it really did the job of adjusting the texture. I also grated about 1/4 cup of Romano cheese and mixed it with 1/4 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs, and sprinkled the mixture on top of the dish before baking. The result was a slightly crunchy and very tasty golden crust. My family and I really enjoyed this dish.

This is a wonderful recipe for quiche.  I tried it because it is crustless and it was very good and easy to make.  I also have tried using frozen chopped broccoli and a colby jack/cheddar shredded cheese mixture.  Was very good and will make again.  Thanks!   Peggy Ann

Made this with a mixture of cheddar and wensleydale cheeses. Think the wensleydale was a little sour for this dish, but will try again without.

This is a great recipe.  We even make it totally low cal by using egg whites, or egg substitute.  Then instead of putting cheese in pie mixture just sprinkle parmesian cheese on top.  You can eat 1/4th of this pie for just 250 calories.

Very good. Used 1 cup fake eggs with 2 real. Sauted fresh spinach along with fresh mushrooms and scallions. Then cheddar cheese with a 6-blend italian. Used the recommendation of adding about 1 Tbsp. flour. I think it firmed up the consistency better than any of the other quiches I have tried before. Great recipe!

This was great for a light dinner. I used a 1lb bag of fresh spinach and wilted that with chopped mushrooms then sauted that with the onions. Like other reviews I cut the cheese down to 2 cups, and used a reduced fat blend. I beat together 7 eggs instead because I made this in a 10in. skillet over the stove then finished in the oven for 30 min. at 350.

This was a great and easy recipe, we really enjoyed it. I used egg beaters and I skipped the onions since I don't like them. I didn't saute the spinach in oil, I just pressed the excess moisture out with a fork. I used garlic salt and 2% mexican cheese (the one with taco seasoning in it. Then put some of the quiche in a tortilla. It was excellent. Great for a breakfast on the go. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This recipes is Yummy! I did make some changes baseed on the reviews.  I used fresh spinish, olice oil instead of cooking, couple dashs of milk and I cut down on the Muenster cheese to 2 cups.  Also, after you Lightly grease a 9 inch pie pan.  I sliced up Red potatoes and lined the bottom and edges then poored the quiche mixture over the potatoes. The eggs mixture was nice and fluffy.  I may have cooked it 5 minutes longer but this is a keeper!  enjoy

This is a great recipe that can be altered to fit your family's needs.  I usually add whatever vegetable & cheese are on hand.  I double the recipe using 10 eggs & cook it in a 9X13 pan instead.

This was very good.  I put into muffin tins and it baked up 12 perfectly.  These were a huge hit with my 16 month old son and my husband. I froze 6 and kept 6 in the fridge. It was a super easy and relatively healthy snack.

With the changes I made to this recipe it turned out phenomenal, but I had to double the cooking time for the recipe, in order for the quiche to set properly, so I didn't give it the 5 stars. I added mushrooms and diced red bell pepper to the onion and spinach and I used 2 cups of Italian cheese blend and 1 cup of a Mexican cheese blend and added one tablespoon of crushed red pepper for a little kick. Definitely a great recipe, just prepare yourself for the extra time needed.

Super good! Really easy and quick, too. I usually make spinach pancakes from this site, but tried this for something different. I only had 4 eggs and also used a blend of shredded mexican and shredded mild cheddar. I DID have one slice of swiss cheese so I made that slice into 4 triangular pieces and used that for a topping. I also added a dash of nutmeg and about 3/4 tablespoon of paprika to the mix. Plus I browned minced onion in butter rather than the oil. My new favorite dish!

Easy to make and pretty flavourful, especially if you use shredded cheese with herbs and garlic added. Nice with sliced tomatoes on the side. Would be good to take cold for lunch as well (just be careful of spinach caught in your teeth!). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this quiche for dinner tonight and we thought it was just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception of the cheese.  I reduced the cheese to 2 cups and used swiss instead of muenster.  We thought it needed more eggs for sure and I think if I were to make it again, I would further reduce the cheese as that's all we could taste.

I love quiche.  I love spinach.  BUT, this was WAY too much spinach in this quiche.  Gag! Maybe my quantities were off, I don't know.  I even added scallions and black olives and the spinach totally overwhelmed the flavor and texture.  This is definately a recipe that I can work with, and the "crustless" factor is excellent for my South Beach lifestyle.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I sauteed smoked sausage and garlic with the onions and spinach and added a touch of nutmeg and red pepper flakes to the eggs.  Instead of muenster cheese, I substituted sharp cheddar.  

It tasted great and was an easy breakfast casserole to eat before leaving for work.  I would make this for company as well.  

Thanks for the recipe!!

This was an easy to doctor recipe.  I followed another user's suggestion and put these in muffin tins...I was able to add cheese on top to half and not put cheese at all in the other half, to knock out some calories and for those that were lactose intolerant.  I also used fresh spinach, which I thought gave it a nicer flavor.  For the ones with cheese on top, I added the cheese to melt the last 7 - 10 minutes or, cooking them in the muffin tins for a total of 20 minutes.  I also threw some low-fat turkey smoked sausage in there to give it a little more of a savory taste.  So half the folks got a vegetarian dish, while the other half had "breakfast".  Oh!  And I also used 6 egg whites instead of the whole eggs.  Trying to keep it light before swimsuit season, for those that are counting calories!

Awesome recipe! I served this to my parents (and other family) at their 50th Anniversary Brunch and they RAVED. I used shredded monterrey jack/colby cheese instead of muenster, and put the quiche in an 8 inch cake pan instead of a pie pan, and it came out tall and wonderful. This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is a great recipe. We are on the SB Diet and I used low fat cheese. I now make it in place of the quiche cups listed in the diet book. Much easier to make. Maybe I'll add mushrooms next time. Super recipe.

I'm making low fat recipes, so this one is perfect.  I love the other quiche recipes on this site (Clark's quiche is the best), but the crust, bacon, creme ect. is too much.  This one is perfect and surprisingly tasty.  I used low-fat old cheddar (about a cup) and Parmesean Reggiano.  Because they're strong cheeses you only need a bit, so that decreases the fat drastically.  I'll make this one again.

Wonderful! I am the only one in my household who will eat quiche so It is mine alone. I followed the directions exactly but had to use swiss cheese with a little cheddar as that is what I had. I also arranged sliced tomatoes and mushrooms on the top. I will make this again as I am sure to crave it.

My mom introduced me to this a few years ago when I was low-carbing it . . . and this is one of the only recipes I continue to crave over and over again.  It is really, really fantastic!  I like it better than any quiche I've had before!  UPDATE: So, I've been playing around with this recipe.  I have doubled it for a "pan" of quiche, and it tasted way too spinach-y or something.  I merely doubled the recipe, so I was confused by that.  Also, I tried using reduced-fat cheese once, and it just wasn't nearly as good.  Finally, adding about five strips of cooked, chopped bacon makes it taste even better!

There were so many wonderful suggestions with this recipe who knows where to start. I added ham, another egg and little milk. I used sliced Muester and cut it up and added some Montery Jack I had. I also cooked it in large muffin tins - the kids loved that. I'll try it with cheddar next time - but I love cheddar. Bacon would be an awesome addtion. Very easy, very quick, very adaptable, very good! Thanks for a great recipe.

Really love this recipe - it is so easy.  My 2-year old loves it, too.  I usually make it just the way it is, or, for a little extra kick, I'll add in some chopped ham.

Loved this recipe!  So easy!!  I did add about 2 to 3 cloves fresh minced garlic to the onion.  I cooked these in butter (always better when cooking eggs ) and after adding the spinach I added fresh ground nutmeg and pepper.  I also added 6 eggs instead of 5.  I have even used this recipe as an appetizer cooking it in mini muffin pans.  If doing this the cooking time is cut in about half.  It was perfect for my friend who has a gluten allergy!

I do not like eggs, in fact I hate them, but this recipe was absolutely deliciious!  I am doing a vegetarian low carb diet and this surely fits the bill!  Next tiime though, i think i can get away with using 2, instead of 3, cups of cheese.  Fabu!

My roommate and I had a huge tub of fresh spinach that we needed to get rid of before it went bad, so we decided to make a quiche. This one was surprisingly easy to make. Since we didn't have the pre-packaged frozen spinach, we finished off what we had, which was probably between 3 and 4 cups chopped. We also eyeballed the amount of cheese, and instead of Muenster we used mozzarella and cheddar. Didn't measure the salt and pepper, or oil either (tend not to measure things exactly when cooking). We did use the same amount of onion and followed the actual cooking instructions and bake time. It turned out delicious and will probably make again. Also, would like to try recipe in a pie crust.

A really tasty and easy low carb/lower fat meal.  To cut down on cholesterol, I used 3 whole eggs and 6T. egg whites from a carton (equal to 2 eggs).  I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, diced ham and canned mushrooms.  I also cut the cheese to 2 cups, using 1c. part skim mozzarella and 1c. sharp cheddar.  My husband & I loved it!

I love it and it is perfect for my low carb diet.  I added chopped mushrooms and a few diced tomato.  I made 1 large and 1 pan that were mini muffin sized.  I will make them all in the mini muffin pans from now on.  They are perfect for little snacks throughout the week!

This is really yummy!  I used 5 eggs and added some cubed ham.  I love spinach and eat it often but I did find the spinach flavor a bit overpowering. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  I'll definitely make this again, maybe only use 1/2 package of spinach next time.

I love recipes that are quick and easy and this one definitely was!

This is really a great recipe.  I think the trick is to really cook those veges until they are moisture-free.  I don't think that the recipe needs any changes.  Lots of fresh ground pepper is always helpful.

Perfect for a quick brunch, and everyone likes it.  I made two, and added mushrooms to one, and red pepper to the other.  Both were popular.  Great for leftovers too.

Delicious! I took the advice of a previous poster and used eggbeaters & low fat feta cheese & made mini quiches in muffin tins. I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic and turkey bacon to mine. They made a mess of my muffin tins though, even though I sprayed them with Pam; maybe next time I'll try using muffin liners.

Try adding a 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg to the mixture - spinach and nutmeg pair really well and it adds a lot more flavour to the recipe.

Oh my goodness, I never thought I would ever crave eggs and vegetables so much! This is an excellent, superb recipe! So easy, yet so elegant and tasty!
As people have said, warming the empty pie pan for a few minutes before pouring in the mixture prevents a soggy bottom.  Try this recipe with shredded carrots, a mixture of muenster and cheddar cheese, chopped mushrooms, and pam instead of oil.

Made for Christmas breakfast.  However, I used frozen onions and canned spinach, switched up the cheeses, and did a lot of guesstimating with the measurements.  Topped with sliced fresh tomatoes.  It turned out surprisingly good!

Awesome!  Made this for my family for Christmas morning breakfast and it was a huge hit!  I did as many suggested - used olive oil instead of vegetable; sauteed garlic, red pepper along with the onions; used sharp cheddar instead of muenster; added chopped tomatoes and cooked bacon to the mix;  added sliced tomatoes to top of quiche for color;  This is a very healthy dish and I will make it again, not just for special occasions.

Wonderful! A pan of this does NOT last long in my house.  My husband devours it.  I make sure to add some chopped garlic to the mix.  It's super easy if you pre-chop fresh spinach and freeze it for use later.

Well my 8 yr old made this quiche tonight...with my assistance.  We sauteed fresh spinach in olive oil and onions.  Used cheddar cheese instead of muenster.  Added a touch of nutmeg and garlic powder.  Oh and I put about 3 TBLS of half & half.  Turned out wonderful!!!

Awesome low carb recipe!  Easy to prepare and very delicious!  I used Tillamook medium cheddar cheese and threw a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes in to spice it up.  It was absolutely delicious!  I bet it would be great with broccoli as well.

Who needs crust?  We added bacon to it and couldn't get enough.  My boyfriend wants me to make this every weekend.

Cheese, spinach.  How can you go wrong?  I used plain bagged/shredded sharp Cheddar cheese instead of the Meunster.  Also added some roasted red pepper.  Everyone liked it.

I gave this 5 stars because I made it like the recipe said and it was great, the I made it with 1 1/4 cups egg substitute, mushrooms and onion, garlic salt and absolutely no cheese - and it was amazing!  This is an incredibly adaptable recipe - can't wait to make it with vegetarian 'sausage'.  Thanks for such a great addition to my recipe collection!

I love this.  I have made it several times, altering it every time whether it was with different cheeses, or using muffin cups, and using refrigerated biscuits as a crust in the muffins cups.  I personally prefer it crustless!  So good.  Try it, and do what you want with it, cannot disappoint.

This was a really great recipe.  The only problem that I had was when I took the spinach out of the freezer I didn't check to see if it was chopped or whole leaf.  It was whole leaf. I would definitely use chopped as the recipe specifies.  The whole leaf clumps together in the center of the quiche.  Other than that it was great.  Oh, I also used 1 cup sharp cheddar as well as 1 cup baby swiss.

i changed a lot of things about this recipe and it was still amazing which i think goes to show what a fabulous idea it is and that you can't really mess it up! :) i did not have veg oil so used olive oil instead... i doubled the onions as mine were small... only had fresh spinach so just sort of eye balled it and nuked what before preparing the pie... and for the cheese, we were tryihng to use left over mozzerela, romano, and parmasan. it still came out great!

This was so easy to prepare, was delicious and looked just like the picture!!  The only change I will make next time will be to halve the cheese.  I used 3 cups of a jack/cheddar/mozarella blend and while delicious, it was too heavy for me -- mind you I ate every bite!  Thanks for a delicious recipe!!

Awfully good and very easy! I did take some liberties (ideas from other reviewers) and add slivered ham and some sharp white cheddar instead of the cheese called for. Also, because I had about 1/3 cup of light sour cream that I either needed to use or toss, I whisked that into the egg mixture too.

My 6 year-old son peeked at the finished product and said, "I don't think I'll like that." I served him the tiniest serving - so he could at least try it - and he ended up taking another HUGE serving. Thanks for this keeper of a recipe!

I made this last night, and also made some changes. I added two cloves of garlic with the onions and only used two cups of cheese: one blue cheese and one cup of shredded cheddar mix. It was great!

This recipe is amazing. I used two packages of shredded swiss cheese, and organic frozen chopped spinach. After I baked this, I would take some of the quiche and a slice of thin deli ham, and roll the quiche inside the ham to make a sort of wrap. It tasted delicious and was easy to make.

Really great base recipe!  We ended up adding some crab meat, scallions, and feta cheese that needed to be eaten.  It turned out fantastic!  Really great texture and consistency.  You really don't miss or  need the crust.  Next time I will try a swiss, ham and green pepper mixture in addition to the spinach.  If you use a salty cheese (like feta) you may want to cut back on the salt.  Since I added so many extra ingredients I had to use a deep dish pan and cook at 400 degrees.

Very tasty and easy to make! I added mushrooms (pre-cooked to remove excess fluid), about a cup of cottage cheese, and reduced the muenster to 2 cups.  It was excellent. The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I did not have Muenster cheese on hand, so instead used a combination of Feta, Parmesan, and Cheddar/Jack cheeses.  The Feta gave the quiche a little sharper taste.  I also added  chopped artichoke hearts.  This one definitely will go in my personal favorites.

Really good. I made a couple changes. 3 cups of Muenster is alot of cheese, so I reduced it to 1 cup of sharp white cheddar instead and added deli thin slices of Muenster on top of the quiche. It made a really nice top crust. Instead of 5 eggs, I used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites to cut down on fat and cholestorol.  I also sauteed crushed garlic along with the onion. We served it with a greek salad!

This is soo good, I perfer the no crust.  I used swiss cheese and I think I could have this everyday.  I'm going to try it next time with the muenster.  This recipe has to be ranked up there with some of my all time favorites.  I will make this one over and over --no doubt!!

This dish turned out great. The texture was perfect and it was easy enough. My only complaint was the cheese. I have made this type dish before using Parmesan cheese, Mozzarella cheese, and other cheeses. Since I have never used Muenster cheese, I wanted to give it a try, but I didn't think it added as much to this dish as the other cheeses have.

I love this recipe. I've never had muenster, can't wait to afford some. It works with any kind though. And also is so versatile...you can add anything you want. I use another egg and sometimes a jalepeno pepper. I make it every chance I get. Thanks so much!

I followed this recipe almost exactly, just adding a little garlic to the onion saute.  It was great!  All my guests loved it.  I was tempted to substitute a different cheese because so many others did and I wasn't familiar with Muenster; but I didn't and I'm glad.  Muenster is not the strong-flavored cheese I thought it was.  I might have been thinking of Limburger or something.  Oh, and it was SO easy!  I will make this again, definitely!

This delicious recipe is wonderful and it's very versatile to any change in ingredients.  I have made it many times, but my favorite would have to be the exact recipe with one shredded carrot in it.  Excellent.

YUM! I completely changed the recipe since I didn't have the proper ingredients and it was sooo good! I didn't have muenster so I used one ball of fresh mozzerella (in water) shredded into the egg mixture, and also fresh shredded hard parm in there (didn't measure). Then layed 2 slices of cheddar over the top so it bubbled when it baked, mmmm! Also used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen. Added garlic too, and no salt due to the large amounts of cheese. I will definitely make this again for brunch guests!

I make this often. It is a great quick, healthy dinner. I use just 1/2 a package frozen spinach - and one extra egg. My kids age 2 and 4 LOVE it - I use whatever cheese I have around - cheddar or mozzerella. I serve with italian turkey sausage that I grill or bake in the oven. Thanks for the great recipe!

3-26-12 - Just recently revisited this recipe after not having made for a while. I added some ground mustard and am now making in a non stick cupcake tin and freezing them for quick low carb breakfast or lunch. Double the recipe to make 24 regular cupcakes and fill 3/4 of the way. Perfect! These are so easy to make! And delicious!!

This was great! I followed another reviewers idea and made it with 8 eggs and 1/4 cup milk. I also added some colby/ jack cheese and topped it all off with fresh tomato slices and feta cheese. Yummy!

Very good, but you must like spinach (obvious by the name)  The muenster cheese was a nice change as well.  Next time I think I will add a bit of ham or sausage just to give it a little more flavor.

Delicious! I added fresh chopped garlic to the onions, used a mix of 3 cheeses (fridge clean-out)and tossed in a few slivered fresh basil leaves and it was outstanding. Serve with sliced homegrown tomatoes...who could ask for more? Thanks for sharing!

Very good, great to skip the crust.  However I think it could be made with a little less cheese, and I added 2 more eggs.

This quiche was awesome! I never made a quiche in my life and I was so surprised how well it turned out. I'm on the South Beach Diet so I used egg substitute and just 2 cups of reduced fat cheddar. I also added a handful of mushrooms and two brown turkey sausage patties. It was fabulous.

This was great!  I used sharp cheddar and added mushrooms.  Next time I will go to the store and buy Muenster, but I can't imagine it could get better.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good. I like the crust part best.  I used swiss cheese because I didn't have any muenster, and it was very good.  Thanks, Cathy

This was an easy recipe. I substituted fresh spinach and used mild white cheddar cheese. I also added cooked crispy bacon. It was delicious, even my 12 year old who said "I'm not eating that" asked for seconds.

This is absolutely fabulous.  Very impressive.  Made it for my dad for Father's Day and served with the Blueberry Baked French Toast casserole on this site and he loved it.  I subsituted Monterey Jack and Colby.  AWESOME!  Looks very impressive.

Not bad.  It's nice to find an quiche recipe without a crust or milk, neither of which I can eat.  I thought this had a bit too much spinach, but that is easily remedied, and I used a garlic and dill cheddar that really punched it up.

This was a great base recipe as others suggested I added some garlic, onion and peppers to spice it up and I doubled the eggs to 10 which was a great consistency. It was a huge hit with everyone!

This is easy and good, it gets better the next day.  I used fresh spinach and wilted it once the onions were done.  I added !/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of oregano.  I also used a pound of cheese.  Next time I will probably add bacon or sausage.  This is a keeper, thanks!

This turned out okay, but not as written.  Entirely too much cheese and onion is called for.  These over quantities are easily seen during the preparation compared to amount of spinach.  I took away at least half of my chopped onion and cheese and crossed my fingers.  Entertaining a work associate for dinner tonight and I was delighted to find the cooking time and temperature suggested produced a very solid quiche with good flavor.

I have made spinach quiche many times but always used a crust. I decided to try this simple recipe. I always use nutmeg and never use salt as the cheese is salty enough; that’s the only change I made.  Because it’s Crustless,  I decided to use a 9in square Pyrex dish. I usually use either cheddar or Swiss cheese. This time I used extra sharp cheddar and Swiss cheese.  It’s delicious but! I took the picture after I had a taste.

I used this as the base but really modified it from there - I used bacon, cut down the spinach by at least half and added brown mushrooms. I cooked the bacon then cut into small pieces. Sautéed garlic, onions, frozen spinach (about 10oz) and diced mushrooms. I mixed all this in with 10 eggs, 2 cups cheese (mozzarella and marbled cheddar) and some milk. Baked as per the directions given in muffin moulds. This recipe got me about 20 muffins. They turned out spectacular!!

It was good, I would probably add a little more kick to it if I made it again.  I made it in a muffin pan and used cupcake liners to avoid sticking-didn't work.  Next time I'll just put straight in the pan and spray really well with non stick spary.

Very good ! Slightly altered recipe to 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese. Added 1  cup cup low fat whipped cottage cheese, 2 chopped onions and some sautéed mushrooms (or canned mushrooms. No one can tell the difference). Thanks for the starter recipe. It made a hit at lunch

I too make this recipe in a muffin pan.  It works great for portable breakfast or lunch at the office!  I've made the recipe enough times that I often add in or substitute ingredients with whatever I have in the fridge & still comes out great every time!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used fresh spinach from my garden, added mushrooms and sautéed the the veggies in garlic olive oil.  I didn't have the cheese called for, so I used a combination of sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack  cheese.  Yummy! I will definitely make this recipe again.

I Love this dish! I added some ground italian sausage and substituted the meunster cheese for swiss and cheddar. Also made a low-carb crust with almond flour. Delicious and didn't break the KETO diet I'm on!

I’ve been making this quiche for years, this recipe used to be on a gluten free recipe board. 

Here’s what I do, I use farm fresh pastured eggs  from a local organic farm, huge difference in taste. I use organic super greens, organic cilantro, & organic sweet onion, I sauté them in raw butter from grass fed cows, I under cook the greens since they’re going to be baked in the quiche. I use organic sharp cheddar cheese instead Munster, only because organic cheddar is easier to find. I use the same raw butter to grease the baking dish, then top the quiche with sliced organic heirloom tomatoes before popping it into the oven. So worth it to go organic. I don’t skimp on the fat either, it’s good fat, and we love it

I chop up mini red, yellow and orange peppers and 1 red onion. I sauté this with  about a tsp of minced garlic. Then . I add 1 package of fresh spinach.  I've used any kind of hard cheese. ( no feta or goat or cream cheeses). I have also used canned and frozen spinach, just squeeze it very dry then chop it up with a sharp knife. I pour it into mini greased muffin tins. I cook in between 20 to 30 minutes. (I check it with a toothpick) it comes out perfect every time.

I didn't have Munster so I used an Italian cheese mix.

Fast, easy, great tasting and inexpensive.

I didn't realize you could make a crustless quiche and not lose the taste!  I used almost a full bag of fresh spinach and added other vegetables: broccoli, mushrooms and peppers, zucchini,tomatoes.  I didn't measure my ingredients. Once in a rush I used onion powder.  I doubled the s & p, and added a bit of Italian seasoning. The mix doesn't need to reach the top of the pie plate.  Watch their video!

Love this recipe and highly recommended it. It's very versatile.
If I do not have spinach, I substitute other vegetables or ham. I use the cheese recommended or gouda.
I make these in mini muffin tins and bake for 10 minutes.
Kids love them. Great for breakfast. Great for lunches.

First time making quiche. I looked at other reviews for additional guidance and added dashes of Italian seasoning, adobo seasoning, and garlic power, and a splash of milk and used about 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, since I didn't have Muenster. Served with tossed salad, but could have eaten it alone. I agree about not missing the crust. And a "this was good, Mom" from my picky 18 year old son was 'the icing on the cake' for me.  Will definitely be making this again and again. Can't wait to try other ingredient combinations.

I make this all the time, for a low carb dinner. I have made the recipe as written. Occasionally, I have to use whatever cheese I have on hand and I use butter instead of vegetable oil. It is always good. It is more "spinachy" and less "eggy". I like it that way. Also, I like to use a square casserole dish instead of a pie pan. I prefer it cut in squares. I make this three or four times a month. That is how much we like it.

I used most of an 8 oz. bag of fresh spinach (stems removed) and sautéed that with the notion and a dash or garlic salt.  I also used egg substitute and 2 cups of a 3 cheddar cheese mix, and some freshly grated Monterey Jack for the rest of the cheese - delicious!!

Great gluten free quiche!  I used fresh spinach, added  chopped red pepper and decreased the onions.  Based on other reviews, I only used 2 cups of cheese.  I used an Italian cheese blend because that is what I had.  Delicious!  Also good with other vegetables and cheese combos!

My whole family LOVES this recipe!  My picky 2 year old likes it more than anyone!  I have been making it for a while now and you just can't go wrong with it.  The only comment I have is that I have trouble finding the recommended cheese blend so I usually use casserole blend from Kroger.  If I can't find that one, I get colby jack blend or even a Mexican/fiesta blend.  And I only use the 2 cup bag and its still plenty of cheese.

Very good. This recipe is pretty flexible. I made it more healthy by using 1.5 cups low fat cottage cheese and 1.5 cups mozzarella instead of the muenster. I have also made it with double the spinach. Just make sure the spinach is pretty dry before mixing in, or you run the risk of a soggy quiche.

I made some changes like others had suggested - I added ham and feta cheese. Unfortunately I didn't think to decrease the amount of salt (my own fault) - so it was way to salty. I'd definitely try it again, but refrain from adding any additional salt.

Excellent quiche recipe. All I changed was adding some garlic and cooking it in muffin tins (for ~20 minutes instead of 30). In the future I'll try making some with ham as well.

Great recipe - would have given it 4.5, but couldn't figure out how.  We did cut down the cheese to one cup of Manchego cheese, and added fresh mushrooms.  Delish!

I make this often. The recipe is great as is, but I also love it with many variations, changing up the vegetable and/or cheese. It's great with leeks or asparagus. I've also added tomatoes to the basic spinach recipe. I use cheddar or a combination of different cheeses, whatever I have on hand. All good.

very easy and yummy.  Can make it easily on a weeknight with some frozen bisquits and fruit and call it dinner.  I use any kind of cheese I have on hand.

With 4 main ingredients this is easy and delicious. Used a mixture of 3/4 Mozzarella and 1/4 Emmental. A perfectly browned top and nice chewy texture. I'd add a little more salt the next time for more taste.

Really wonderful. I added garlic to the onions & changed the cheese - I used a 5 cheese mexican blend. Thank you, our guests enjoyed this as well. I might try it with less cheese to be a little healthier next time.

I am not a spinach fan, but this recipe is delicious! I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of muenster cheese and I used canned chopped spinach drained instead of frozen. It's really tasty!

Loved it!  Switched it up with what I had on hand.  Used broccoli & cheddar cheese.  Also added red & yellow peppers to the onion sauté!!!  Yummy!!!!  UPDATE! 11/1/14  I'm trying to watch my weight but wanted this because it was so good.  Lowered the calories this way….Again I used red and yellow peppers along with the onions and sautéed them with cooking spray rather than the oil.  Used 2 cps of cheese (I use cheddar) instead of 3.  Used 2 eggs and 6 egg whites.  I also used cooked broccoli instead of spinach.   I used a glass pyrex pie plate and cooked it for 40 min.  Delish… sweet and savory!!!

Excellent!  Added 1/2 chopped green pepper and used low-fat cottage cheese instead of Munster. And just because we like a little heat, added a bit of red pepper flakes.  Yummy!!!!

I served this with a side of sliced fruit for lunch. I didn't have the full 3 cups of muenster, so I made up the difference with Vermont white cheddar which gave it a little sharpness. I will certainly be making this again. Thanks!

LOVED with modifications per other reviews! I used 7 eggs, 1.5 cups cheese (and used sharp cheddar), half the amount of spinach, added chopped mushrooms, nutmeg, and garlic powder. No pepper because I don't like it. Cooked perfectly in 30 minutes in glass 8in dish.

wanted something quick, easy and low carb with flavor. very good. used an 8x8 silicon pan, had no pie pan, and casserole cheese instead of muenster. added a dash of nutmeg and seasoned salt instead of salt/pepper. of course, it came out thinner than in a pie pan, but the flavor was great and the texture was nice and filling. Will make again!

The only changes I make to  this recipe are about 1/4 tsp. cayenne and a couple tbs. of bacon bits, then I cook them in a muffin tin for personal-sized "quiche cups." Everyone I've served them to - which is quite a great number of people - have given very good feedback and have often requested the recipe. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Loved this quiche! Very easy to make and it comes out great every time. My mothers asks for it whenever she comes to dinner. Note: be careful not to overspray the pan like I tend to. It will make the quiche a little oily on the bottom. :)

I made this as a side dish with ham.  Great flavor and consistency. Went very well with the ham. And the left-overs made a great lunch!  I am ready to make this for company.  Maybe next time I will try lightening it up with some of the other reviewers' suggestions.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first quiche.  My mother is gluten intolerant and this came out great.  I would suggest cooking at 375.  I baked at 350 and had to keep it in for an extra 15-20 mins because the middle was still loose.  I cooked up raw spinach that I cut up after I sautéed the onions.  I added 1/4c. milk to the egg mixture along with some ground nutmeg.  I used cheddar cheese and will definitely use a different kind of cheese next time.  I topped it off with sliced tomatoes and spindled park cheese on the top.  I will have this for breakfast every morning.  A+++

This was super easy to make and delicious. I used mild cheddar because I had it on hand and it was absolutely fantastic.  I will be keeping this on hand for quick and easy breakfast.

I recommend making two! It disappears fast! The whole family loved it. For cheese, I used 2 cups cheddar and 1 cup of mozzarella. This has definitely been added to my recipes.

I made this for some friends and they asked for the recipe (only difference was mozzarella cheese instead of muenster because that's what I had on hand and I added a big tomato)! While I was making it, I wished I had doubled it in the first place for myself. A couple days later I made it again for me and my fiance and his family. Only this time, trying to please various people, I left out the spinach, used the mozzarella cheese, chopped up a big tomato, threw in a heap of dried basil, and a little garlic powder. FANTASTIC! Only change I may make is to cut back on the cheese. I love cheesy, but I think a little less wouldn't take away from it at all and 3 cups is a lot.

I often make it in a 9x13 pan, using 7 eggs, 4 cups of cheese (usually use cheddar) and 16 oz frozen spinach or 18 oz fresh spinach that I sautee with the onion to reduce it down.

This is my to-go quiche for brunch. It's a hit every time. The receipt is very forgiving, always comes out well. I began adding 1/2 cup of milk to make the mixture lighter for pouring into muffin pans. Also, I sometimes use green onions and mushrooms.  I have also tried different cheeses, all with great results.  You won't miss the crust at all.

LOVED the recipe but made a few changes. I used one cup of light cottage cheese, and then half cup of mozzarella or cheddar, some diced mushrooms, and half a red pepper. Kept the egg/ spinach ratio the same.  Added a little bit of dry dill, and baked for 30 minutes.  Comes out as an amazing breakfast, brunch or lunch option, and the dill makes it taste like a healthy greek spinach pie!  I have already made this 4 times in the past month! Will make again and again

Fantastic. I've tried tons of variations, all of which have turned out wonderful. From adding sausage and green chillis to changing the cheese to mozzarella. Really it just depends on whats in my fridge, but I love that it turns out great every time. My husband has never been a fan of quiche but he loves this one.

I loved this idea!  I wanted it a little healthier, so after reading some of the comments, I replaced the muenster cheese with 1 cup low fat cottage cheese and 1 cup low fat mozzarella cheese.  I used only 4 eggs, added a little garlic salt, left out the vegetable oil and used olive oil cooking spray.  Baked at 375 for 30-35 minutes and it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

This is a fantastic staple for any chef's repertoire. It is easy to customize to your personal taste or with what you have on hand.  I like cheddar.  Added browned mushrooms, just because I had them on hand.  You could add asparagus. . . anything!  I added about a teaspoon of cream of tartar.  Wonderful.  You will never miss the crust.

I made little mini quiches to bring to Christmas dinner at my bf's aunt and uncle's. His uncle has a gluten intolerance, so was looking to bring something he could eat. This was a big hit with everybody. I did add some mushrooms I happened to have around, but I've made it by the book too and it's great both ways. One thing to note, if you make minis, be sure to grease your muffin tin well, a full size one is easy enough to deal with using the pie cutter, but you can't get anything like that in the muffin tin if some cheese gets stuck on.

I added some crushed red pepper, minced garlic and an extra egg. Put them in muffin pans and baked for 18 mins. They were awesome!  I used an Italian blend of cheese...1 pkg, so 2 cups instead of the 3. I think you could use any kind of cheese.

Made this recipe for Christmas Brunch and it was a hit.  I made it in muffins tins as another reviewer did.  I doubled the amount of eggs to ten and used shredded cheddar. I made it the day ahead and baked it the day of.  The only issue I had was even though I sprayed the pans ahead of time they stuck a little.  This made 24 mini quiches and I filled the tins to the top.

This was great!  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a casserole dish. The edges started to get too brown, so I just covered the edge with foil and let cook a little longer. It was a hit for my brunch. I was worried about the onions...but they were fine.  I think next time I am going to add some other vegetables to see how they work.  Awesome recipe and very easy!

This is delicious, quick and easy!  (Very inexpensive, too.)  I used Cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand, but I think you could use any cheese you want, and it would work.  I also only used 2 cups of cheese because I ran out...but it seemed like plenty!  I will probably stick with two cups in the future, just to make it a bit healthier.  This would be good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!  My five-year-old liked it too.

**I am completely new at cooking/baking!**
This recipe was easy and yummy!
I could not find frozen spinach at Festival Foods, so I used fresh, which worked fine. (I had to google how to cook spinach on the stove, haha)
I also used provolone and motz cheese, that is all I had.
I think next time I will add salsa or peppers, just to add something extra, it was just a little plain.

3-16-2017 I've made this quite a few times, but tonight I had an idea at the last minute. I added some ham that needed to be used. A really delicious variation of this quiche recipe. 
9-20-2013 A delicious meatless entree! I used part-skim mozzarella instead of the muenster cheese, and I added some garlic powder and a little crushed red pepper flakes. Even my husband didn't miss the meat.

This was missing something. I should've followed other reviewers suggestions and added more spice. I used 8 oz of fresh spinach, mushroom and cheddar chesse.

This was very good and easy to make. I didn't have Muenster cheese, so I used a 2% Cheddar Jack blend. I served it with Sourdough bread & olive oil. I will definitely make this again.

Super easy and delicious. I sauteed portobellos with the onion. I used shredded swiss in the egg mixture, and sprinkled sharp cheddar on top right before baking.

Best ever quiche recipe! So fast and easy. I double this and sometimes switch out the spinach with broccoli, ham, bacon or whatever else I have on hand. My kids love it! I can get dinner on the table in 30 minutes with this recipe!

AWESOME!! I made a few changes based on the reviews.  I used 2.5 cups of Swiss, added 1/2 lb. of cooked, chopped bacon and added an extra egg.  This was so good, we ate half immediately! I will be making this often, thank you.

Loved it. Very easy and lends itself to variations of cheeses adding or omitting sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and spices.   very healthy economical and light. My husband enjoyed .

I just tried this recipe this week and it was perfect! My only change is that I baked it in a cupcake tin instead to make individual portions for entertaining and I did add onion and fresh garlic to the spinach. My mom, who doesn't eat gluten, loved that it was crustless and really enjoyed them. I'm being asked for the recipe by others also. Very happy with this recipe. I only wish I had oiled the pan better since it is crustless (had just given a light spritz of Pam because I didn't want them to be greasy.) However I am still having trouble cleaning the pan. I know for next time and will definitely be making these again and again.

Made this for a lunch and it became a favourite at once. I used mozzarella and little feta instead of the muenster cheese, it was delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes and a salad- tasty and healthy.

I really loved this recipe. I'm not a big fan of egg dishes, but I was looking for a quick meal I could make with ingredients I had on hand. This dish was delicious-it didn't taste "eggy" at all to me. I didn't have muenster so I just used whatever shredded cheese I had (I think it was cheddar and a Mexican mix) and it was still awesome. I'll definitely make again.

I love this quiche. It is so good and smells amazing while the onion and spinach cooks. I used fresh spinach and have made it with cheddar cheese and also with mozzarella - both taste great. It always sticks to the pan a little but maybe I just need to grease the pan more.

Love this recipe!  The only change I make is the cheese... using what I have on hand or a mixture of things.  I make it for a "girlfriends lunch" and everyone raves about it!  Thanks.

I use this recipe whenever I need a quick dinner or something to serve to guests for breakfast/brunch. I often substitute white cheddar cheese for the Muenster (based on family preferences). I also use this recipe as a base recipe for other quiches.

Delicious! This is the first quiche I've ever made and it was so yummy. I had company over for brunch and made this with some gluten free pancakes, and fruit platter.  I can't eat wheat so the crustless option was delicious and no one even noticed it didn't have a crust. I used fresh spinach and added a little bit of ground sausage. SOOOO good. Love how much spinach is in the recipe--- healthy, easy recipe to make. I definitely recommend!

This was great!  I usu use a diff recipe (w/ a crust) from All-recipes however I am looking to cut carbs!  I doubled recipe & put into a 9X13 as suggested from another.  This amount was right for my family of 5 (3 teenage athletic girls). I had fresh spinach & added 3-4 c lightly chopped (the amount the recipe called for seemed too much), 2 T sundried tomato, and some seasoned turkey sausage + onion. I used egg beaters bc I was curious if it would taste different, and was surprised this tasted so good! Thumbs up by everyone - husband didn't like sausage.

Like my quiche with less cheese (call me crazy) and more eggs. Used 1 cup egg substitute, 4 eggs, 14 oz frozen chopped spinach (bag), 5 slices cooked/chopped centercut bacon, 2 cup cheese (lite blend cheddar, mont jack, mozarella)and it was great.

With a little tweaking to meet our tastes this turned out great.  I used 2 cups of Swiss cheese and 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese in place of the Muenster.  I also added some sliced baby bella mushrooms and garlic in with onions and spinach.  I didn't notice at the time, but my pkg. of spinach was 12 oz. instead of 10 which was way too much spinach.  I think next time I'll either add some additional eggs and bake in a larger dish or cut back on the spinach a bit as I thought it was a little much.  Will definitely add another clove of garlic next time as well.

Easy! I used broccoli (which I sautéed with the onion & a shallot) instead of spinach & cheddar cheese. Added 2 eggs & threw in an 8x8 pan. This is a great quiche template.

Great recipe! I used 5 large eggs and I sauteed red onions,jar of mushrooms, 11 oz of spinach. i also added garlic powder and bacon bits. I used 3 cups of a bag of shredded sharp cheese. This is one of those neat recipes that you can really make your own by adding different cheeses and herbs and spices. Also if you are doing the atkins diet, this recipe should be a staple in your rotation;-)

This recipe is easy and so delicious.  Last summer, we kept a foreign exchange student who was vegetarian, and this was the perfect recipe for her - delicious, healthy, and easy!  She loved it, and my 17-year-old daughter who usually doesn't like spinach tried it, and she has asked for me to keep making this dish.  I used a combination of cheeses that I had on hand, and it was very good.

Was better after cooking for an extended amount of time. 3 cups of cheese seems a bit "fatty" but it made a tasty breakfast.

This was so delicious, quick and easy to make.  I sautéed fresh spinach and onion in 2 tbsp olive oil. Used reduced fat sharp cheddar and reduced fat feta cheese.  Served it with baked salmon and a side of grits (for my son). Turned out fantastic!

One of my favorite recipes on this site. I've been on Atkins for over a year, and this makes a great low-carb breakfast or lunch! I usually use shredded cheddar instead of Muenster because I can buy it in bulk - it tastes great no matter what cheese you use though. I also add some Feta cheese when I have it. I also like to add a cup of sour cream - if you're trying to eat low-fat or low-calorie I wouldn't recommend this, but it gives the quiche a nice texture! That being said, I still think this recipe is perfect as written! I make it at least twice a month.

Frozen spinach always tastes "fishy" to me.  You can substitute a pound and a half fresh spinach for the 10 oz frozen, which will cook down rapidly to the right amount in about the same time it takes to evaporate the liquid from the frozen.  Add it at the same step in this recipe and pull it when well wilted.

I used this as a start to a crustless quiche. My parents just brought over the bounty from there garden so I used a lot from what they brought me....zuchini, onion, jalepeno, tomato. This is very good!

I like this recipe because it's relatively very healthy; even leaving out the crust, many other quiche recipes contain flour, butter, and other fatty ingredients.  This is almost all vegetable, and I found that 1 cup of cheese instead of 3 works well.  It's also very easy to add other vegetables, like potatoes and peppers.

A great 'starter' recipe. I changed the spinach to broccoli - about 2 cups or more (lightly steamed and chopped to get some of the moisture content out). I've also added a 6th egg - changed the cheese to Pepper Jack and a small handful of fresh Parmesean. Added 1 or 2 cloves of minced garlic, crumbled bacon bits, a small amount of chopped turkey deli meat (less fat than ham - but ham is good too), a tbsp or so of cream cheese (melted first), and I sauteed the onion with some fresh mushrooms too - I used 'baby bellas'. You have to put the pie plate on a cookie sheet - it might bubble up a bit and keeps the oven cleaner. I also increased the cook time by 5 min due to the added amount of items and the extra egg.

This quiche is perfect!  When I made it, I subbed out 2 cups of mozzarella and 1 cup of gruyere for the muenster.  I also made it in a store-bought frozen pie crust which made it extra delicious.  Next time I have a breakfast event or visitors, this is what I'll be making!

This was really easy and sooo tasty! Like other reviewers have said, I basically used what I had in my fridge.
I had a bag of fresh, organic baby spinach that I needed to use up, so I washed and sliced up the spinach and sauteed it with the onions. Along with the onions, I added chopped garlic and crushed red pepper and sauteed until soft, then added spinach and sauteed until wilted. Put in a colander and squeezed all the water out until dry. I also seasoned the spinach mixture with a little bit of salt and pepper.
With the eggs, I added about a 1/4 cup soy milk, some chopped black olives and the cheeses I used were: Mediterranean style feta cheese, cheddar cheese, mozzarella, parmesan, pepper jack, and a mexican blend. Sounds like a lot, but I just put a small amount of each to make about 2 1/2 cups.
Poured into a greased 8x8 glass pan, and put some sliced tomatoes on top with sliced nacho-style jalapenos in the middle of each tomato.
The aromas coming from the oven...OMG!
I had to add 10 more minutes to the time and set the oven to 325 because the middle was still a little wet when I inserted a toothpick.
The addition of the pepper jack and tomatoes were delish!

I'm on a diet, I used eggbeaters for 4 eggs, 1 1/4 c Red Fat Swiss cheese, 3/4 c Parm Cheese, 1/2 c mushrooms, 1 scallion (not gr onion), the salt, pepper and dash of nutmeg. My husband even loved it :) A total keeper. Next time I will try adding canadian or turkey bacon

Good and easy. You don't have to be exact with the ingredients and can easily substitute with whatever you have on hand. For the cheese, I used a mixture of conte, fresh mozzarella, swiss, and feta and it worked well.

Added 2 additional eggs.  Sauteed the onions with garlic, salt and pepper.  Overall, delish and super easy to us.  Used jack cheese, but would try cheddar next time around.

I made this for Mother's Day morning and added anything and everything I thought of adding.  It was delicious!  I mixed cheddar cheese w/bleu cheese, added real bacon bits and some diced ortega chiles plus more...just can't recall what.   When I served it, I put a tad of sour cream and salsa on the top.  I think I prefer it with only the salsa.  BUT, it will DEFINITELY be made in my house often.  Thanks, ANY14TNS!  UPDATE:  I've made this three times since Mother's Day.  EVERY time it turns out delicious.  Today I used tomato/basil feta cheese as suggested in another review.  IT IS TO DIE FOR!

This quiche turned out great.  I followed others suggestions and used a different blend of cheeses.  I used shredded mozzarella, provalone, and swiss cheeses.  I also added mushrooms.  This was a big hit at my Mother's Day brunch.

Oh boy...love, love, LOVE this recipe!  Found it this morning and made it for breakfast.  I used fresh spinach, shallots, mushrooms and pepperjack cheese.

I love the fact there is no crust, never imagined making quiche without one.  I like it better!!!

THANK YOU for posting!

So delicious!! I made this using mozzarella instead of Muenster and fresh spinach. I also sprinkled some extra cheese on top about 15 min before it was done cooking. Absolutely phenomenal! One of the best quiches I have ever had. I couldn't help but have a second serving!

I used minced garlic instead of the onion and fresh sauteed spinach in place of frozen.  I baked them in a silicone muffin "pan" and they turned out great!  Kids weren't crazy about them, so more for me and hubby!

This was so, so easy and delicious! I bought the HUGE bag of fresh spinach at our local warehouse store and searched for recipes to use it up. It was absolute fantastic as is, but I think next time I might try making it in muffin cups and freeze the "quiche muffins" for a quick and healthy breakfast.  I did use Muenster cheese, but could only find sliced, so I just chopped it up. Honestly, I think any cheese would work just fine.  Will definitely make again and again!

I was really happy with this recipe.  I didn't have enough eggs (4), but it was fine! I used fresh spinach, and sauteed some frozen bell pepper slices and some low-fat turkey I had on hand.  It was delicious!

I was very happy with how this "stayed together" after slicing. A hit with my 7-year-old. We made this recipe together--I showed her how to use the mini chopper to make the onions and mushrooms (added at the advice of other reviewers) smaller and more appetizing. Other than that, we followed the recipe to a T. 7-year-old asked if we could make it more often. The whole family answered, "yes!"

Was a little concerned how my first crustless quiche would turn out, but I shouldn't have been worried for it turned out excellent! Even my vegetable disliking partner ate half of it to himself. Only change I made was that I already had a bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese in the fridge and had used that instead of Muenster, but plan on making it again for family with the Muenster next time.

This was a great way to get our son to eat veggies! I made a few changes, only bc I wanted to use what we had in the fridge. I used 6oz fresh spinach roughly chopped, added bacon pieces, and used a four blend shredded cheese instead of the cheese called for. It was so good! 30 minutes was the perfect cooking time. We prefer a crust with our quiche, so next time I'll use a pre-baked piecrust.

Excellent dish, easy to make ahead, and very forgiving. I made it healthier with egg whites and added cottage cheese for more protein, and use fresh spinach. This dish is easy to be creative with and always turns out great.

Made this for a baby shower; it was loved by all. I added artichokes and I used the cheese I had on hand (mozzarella, provolone, cottage cheese) and it still tasted fabulous.

We really enjoyed this, it was fast and easy to put together.  I used Monterey Jack Cheese--I didn't have muenster on hand. Also sauteed some diced red bell pepper and fresh sliced mushrooms with the onion.  Doubled recipe and put into a 9 x 13" pan.  Done in 45 min.

Everyone seems to love this recipe.  Even my kids.  I double the spinach in order to get as much green stuff as possible into my toddler.  I use garlic grapeseed oil to saute  the onion for a little extra flavor.  There are never any leftovers.

I upped number of eggs.  3 cups of cheese sounded like too much to me, so I used about a cup and a half of feta and mozzarella mixed instead of Muenster.  Still delicious!

This is delicious and very versatile.  I used fresh spinach and a mixture of whatever cheeses I could find in the fridge.  It was amazing, and I'm used to making the breakfast casseroles/ and quiches with meats and all kinds of veggies.  I was reluctant to try something that seemed so basic, I thought it would be very bland and boring.  But to my surprise, this is delicious!

Great recipie.  I have made this several times.   I've added diced ham and I've also made it in a muffin pan so that my kids can easily take it to school.  I've even made it for people that dislike eggs.

I made this for the second time this morning, and made some modifications based on what I did and didn't have on hand.  I added some sour cream and greek yogurt, garlic powder, sundried tomatoes, used maybe 2 cups Tillamook cheddar cheese sliced into small pieces instead of Muenster, added some french fried onions into the mix, and topped with fresh grated Parmesan the last 10 minutes or so.  Dee-lish-us.

This is an amazing basic recipe that you can alter with different veggies and cheeses that you have in the house.  I added chopped ham, an extra egg and cheddar cheese.  It turned out wonderful and got rave reviews!  You don't even miss the crust one bit!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I make this once a week or so.  I have changed it to our liking.  I omit the onion.  I typically like onion, but in this recipe it is overpowering.  I use 7 eggs to make it go a bit further.  I use 2 cups of cheese, usually the mexican mix.    I add either 1 cup of sliced mushrooms or 1 cup of chopped ham.  I add the ham or mushrooms to the spinach and saute it together.  Even my 2 year old will eat it.

Delicious and easy recipe! I, like other reviews, cut the cheese back to two cups and it was still plenty cheesy. I also used sharp cheddar and a dash of parmesan instead of muenster. Thanks for sharing such an easy, cheap and tasty option.

I added some pancetta to please my family, which gave it a great flavor to compliment the spinach.  Next time I think I would cut down the amount of cheese so that more of the egg can shine through.

When I made this, I added broccoli, a little dried basil and oregano and substituted scallions for the onion. I also used havarti cheese and cheddar. It had really good flavor, but was too salty, so next time I will leave out the salt that it calls for. I'm keeping this recipe!

Easy and delicious.  I'm on a low carb diet, so this dish was perfect for me.  I went ahead and made two of these - the second one, I made with bacon.  It was really good for breakfast the next day.

I came upon this recipe while looking for ways to use up all the eggs our chickens lay..they're up to laying 2 dozen or more per day now..uggghhh  I've tried it with colby jack cheese and monterey jack cheese, as well as muenster and it comes out great everytime, especially with the farm fresh eggs.

This was easy and excellent!  I substituted the cheese for what we had on hand (Monterey Jack/Cheddar) and added a tbsp of dry minced onion as I didn't have any onions on hand.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent!  Wasn't greasy.  I changed one thing- I used cheddar cheese instead of Muenster.  I also added 6 strips of Morningstar Veggie Bacon cut up.  So it was a vegetarian meal.  My kids hate spinach but all 4 loved it (14 months - 8 years).

What a great recipe! I've made it in a 9-inch pie pan, and also in muffin tins. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and cut down on the amount of cheese used (10oz) and I used a combination of the cheeses that I had in the fridge. I sub'd bacon for the vegetable oil (because bacon makes everything better) and I added 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg. Muffins take about 20 minutes to cook.

I remember something like "real men don't eat quiche." This recipe changed my husband (in a good way lol)! Instead of frozen spinach I steamed fresh spinach, 2.5 C Mozz and 1/2 C Feta were substituted for the Muenster and I used a dash of cayenne instead of black pepper. My oven cooks hot so I'll take it out 5 minutes early next time. Otherwise, perfect! Thanks for submitting such a great recipe!

I live a low carb lifestyle and just love this recipe!  The first time I made it the only substitution I made was (1) small carton of cheese and chive eggbeaters and I used cheddar vs. muenster.  I added a few dashes of tabasco as well. So good.  I took another reader's suggestion and put them in muffin tins sprayed with non-stick spray.  It makes 12 perfect egg muffins.  Next time, I used sauted green onion, ham chunks and swiss cheese.  Amazing.  I love that one container of egg beaters makes 12 perfect little snacks.  I refrigerate them and take to work for breakfast or lunch.  My kids love them too.

this was yummy, and great the next day as well.  I used 7 eggs, a splash of milk and a pinch of nutmeg, and used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella.  This is perfect for experimenting with a variety of different cheese

This is a very good, versatile recipe.  I used what I had on hand.  As I only had a small amount of fresh spinach, I also sliced and sauteed a carton of fresh button mushrooms.  I used a 9x9 glass baking pan, and as another commenter did, I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  It was nicely brown on the edges and tasted great.

My husband has requested this as a weekly dish now :)  It's a great way to use up extra veggies that you have in your fridge.  I used fresh spinach and added garlic, a tomato, and fresh mushrooms.  So good, thanks so much for the recipe

Awesome recipe! I would recommend throwing some fresh, sliced mushrooms in and a couple dashes of hot sauce! But even as is, it was delicious! I also have made it several times with shredded cheddar instead of Muenster!

I made this quiche for brunch today.  We had a gluten free guest.  I served it with cut up fruit, bagels, and smoked salmon as part of a nice spread.  I thought this quiche was very good.  I admit, I did miss the pie crust for texture reasons, but I thought this came out great.  I prepared it mostly as written.   These are the changes:

I used a 2 cup bag of shredded sharp cheddar (I couldn't find shredded muenster and didn't want to shred it myself).

I used about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan to kind of make up the difference for my cheese shortage.

I added in a chopped garlic clove, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1/4 cup of milk.

This was really tasty and can be made many different ways.  Even the men loved it.  This will be featured again on my brunch rotation.  This can be made with ingredients that most people have on hand, which is nice.

I did not care for this as much as my hubs, but he loves spinach. I'm not as much a fan. Good recipe though and can cater to your own tastes. I have used cheddar cheese(2%), feta cheese, added bacon and tomato...I always always cut down on the egg yolks. Use maybe 2 and only whites for others just to make it healthier.

I took these to a company party.  Big hit! I didn't have an onion so I used 1 tbsp onion powder and 1/2 cup mushrooms instead.  I also used a mini muffin tin and it made 24 mini quiches and 6 regular muffin sized quiches (cups half full on the regular size).

My guests and I loved this.  Served it at a Christmas brunch.  Followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing.  I prepared it the night before and popped it in the oven on the morning of the brunch.  The meunster cheese gives it a unique flavor.

This quiche was so easy and simple. I wasn't terribly experienced when I made it and it turned out almost perfectly. When I make this, which is quite often, I make sure I add salt and pepper. I also have never used muenster cheese. I use an assortment of cheese that needs to be used up. I've replaced the cheese with swiss, cheddar, mozzarella, and colby jack. Usually a mixture of any of these cheeses is best. Great recipe!

One of my favorite recipes from this site.  Can use any kind of cheese you prefer and can add extra ingredients such as proscuitto, salad shrimp, bacon etc.  I make it all the time - good with any meal.

Very easy to make, but I found 3 cups of cheese makes for a very heavy filling quiche.  Next time around, I'll cut back on the cheese and add a few vegies for variety.

This was my first time making quiche and it was great! I used half spinache & half broccoli and 2.5 cups of the cheeses I had in the house (mix of ricotta, feta and cheddar). So good and easy. Will definitely be making this one again.

Fairly easy...I don't find frozen spinach easier than fresh...don't like all the squeezing to get rid of excess water. The rest is very easy. I added some nutmeg. The flavor is fine, but not outstanding.

I thought this was a great recipe: Easy, quick, economical, healthy, easily adapted to what you have on hand! As mentioned by other reviewers I chose to add green onions directly to the egg mixture to avoid getting a pan dirty. I used mozzarella, added garlic salt & fresh basil. Topped w/ fresh garden tomatoes a bit more cheese. Just added stuff I had. A keeper--even my kids ate it. Thanks!

So easy and delicious! This always satisfies me and its a great way to get spinach into my diet. I have tried this recipe in muffin form, and the quiche always sticks to the wrappers or the muffin tray. I would recommend making it in a regular glass baking dish and cutting into the size pieces you want. This recipe freezes and reheats really well, although it never lasts more than a few weeks!

I made this recipe for the first time last weekend and it was DELICIOUS!  I agree with other reviews, this is a totally flexible recipe.  I added the recommended amount of spinach but I used other veggies too that were about to turn (1/2 a red pepper & a tomato) and even my boyfriend (who won't eat plain veggies) ate it and then ate seconds!  I will definitely be making this over and over!

Great recipe! I used muenster, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and sprinkled 1/4 cup of cheese on top after taking it out of the oven. Served with orange slices.

Making this again! I followed others' suggestions--basil, garlic, bits of ham. I was worried about too much onion, but it turns out it was perfect! Loved it! Will add a few more egg whites next time.

Great recipe!  The changes I made were to use fresh spinach, 2 cups of a different cheese (I did Colby Jack, I'm sure you could use whatever kind you like), and to add a sliced tomato on top as I saw in some of the photos.  My boyfriend and I ate the whole thing for brunch this morning.  He really, really liked it.

This tasted fine.  Not too much egg though.  I added some ham to it.  I prefer the more egg like quiche but this was good for my lo carb husband.

A phenomenal quiche! Simple to put together, easy to alter (I added tomatoes to the egg mixture for some color) and absolutely delectable! I made these in a cupcake tin for bite size quiches for a brunch, with no problems. Made 21 individual ones in a 12-muffin tin.

Good base recipe, but needs more "stuff" to make it worth repeating. Used 6 eggs and a combination of muenster, baby swiss, and sharp white cheddar cheeses. Added diced green olives, sun-dried tomatoes, reduced onion to 1/2, and sliced fresh tomatoes on top.  Now THAT was incredible! It was juicy, tender, and sooo much flavor. Doubled recipe and cooked in 9x12 pyrex, had to almost double cooking time as a result. Served cut in squares for a baby shower - rave reviews!

Good quiche. I added slices of deli turkey to make it more of a meal and didn't have as much spinach (used fresh) as it called for. Also, I used cheddar and some mozz, as I didn't have muenster. Still delicious, but next time, I'll add more spinach and garlic.

Didn't make it as directed(which I'm sure is wonderful as well). But giving it 5 stars because of it's diversity! To use a healthier version: I sub. 1 1/2 cup egg beaters in place of the eggs, steamed fresh spinach(just becuase we had it), added very small heads of broccoli and diced celery(yummy), for the cheese mixture, I used 1 cup low fat cottage cheese, 1 cup fat free shredded cheddar, 1/4 cup regular shredded cheddar. Added tomotatoes to the top(a must).  It was GREAT! I will be trying diced ham next. Can't wait!

Very tasty. I was concerned that 3 cups of cheese would be too much, but I trusted the recipe, and it worked just fine. I did add some diced ham and mushrooms, and about 1/3 cup of sour cream. Thanks for the excellent recipe, and I will make it often.

4 stars for ease of preparation and texture, but I'm not sure how tasty this would have been as-is since I made some flavor additions and was still left slightly unimpressed. I would have liked a little more egg, or perhaps less spinach. If I try this again, I'll add another egg and mix up the veggies a bit.

Simple and good.  I'm trying to go low carb and this is perfect for it.  I did make some changes though.  I used about 2 cups muenster, 1/2 cup mozz and 1/2 cup cheddar.  Used 6 eggs, 5 didn't look like enough, and added an extra pinch of salt because of the extra egg.  Baked about 33 mins.

I was determined to only use what I had in the kitchen, so I used a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach chopped (I took off the stems), about 3 cups of mozzerella cheese, and about 5 fresh mushrooms, plus the onions, oil, and spices.  I did have one pie shell, so i put half in pie shell and half in casserole dish.  Both were wonderful.  I will probably add a bit more spices next time or maybe tomato for color.

I was in search for a spinach dish because I had a bunch of fresh spinach from my mother. I was so glad I found this recipe. My family loved it! Since I didn't have canned spinach, I had wilted them in the microwave (in a large bowl fill it with spinach;1/4 cup of water;cover it well with a plate & make sure it's not resting on the spinach; microwave for 3-4 minutes;transfer to colander;press w/ a spatula to release excess liquid). I also used half parmesan and mozzarella because that's what I had and still turned out fabulous!!

Best quiche I've ever had in my life!  I think the muester cheese makes a difference.  Don't change anything in the recipe, it's perfect!

This was so delicious! I read other reviews and did the following - cheese mix of muenster, gouda, swiss & mozzarella. Added cremini and baby bella mushrooms, and roasted red peppers. Also added minced garlic to onions while cooking. Then to the egg mixture added onion salt & nutmeg. After mixing all together added 2% milk. Then topped with roma tomatoes. Delicious!!

I think this is a great quiche recipe. Easy, simple. and not too much work. I used smoked cheddar cheese instead of the Muenstar. This gave it a fantastic, bacon smell because of the smokiness.

I did a few modifications, as I wanted to use what scraps of leftover cheeses and spinach I had left in my refrigerator.  I did use about 12 ounces of fresh spinach  and mushrooms which I added to the onions after cooked down.  I grated up smoked gouda, monterey jack, sharp cheddar and a touch of feta.  I added fresh dill as suggested and it turned out so delicious.  I think this is a yummy, great recipe to use some bits of cheese and produce left over.

This lacks the richness of real quiche, but I expected that. The flavor isn't "wow"--but it's pretty good. I will try again following some of the recommendations for nutmeg and cracked pepper. Might even try a pinch of nutmeg or adding some bacon. It cooked up nicely in the ramekins I used for single servings. My two year old ate it and "green" usually has to be very well hidden!

This recipe rocks. It'd be great as is, but I used a bag of Trader Joe's shredded smoked cheeses (Gouda, Mozzarella, Cheddar, Provolone mix) and that smokiness really gave it a delightful twist. I also chopped fresh spinach, because I have a HUGE bag from Costco that needs to be used. I've never been a crust person, pie or quiche or otherwise, so I love that this has all the good stuff without the wasted calories of crust. We make up for it by topping it with sour cream (though plain yogurt would be good and less fat). I used three eggs and two eggs worth of Egg Beaters, because that's what I had. Best of all, my anti-green vegetable 2-1/2 year old ate as much of it as I did. Woo-hoo!

This was my first time making quiche and I found this very easy to make. I had never had crustless quiche before and was a little skepticle, but this was really good! I did make some additions. I also added mushrooms, I used Egg Beaters Garden Vegetable (which added a little extra flavor), I used a combo of low fat cheddar and mozzerella cheeses, and a little italian seasoning. I will definetely make this again. I also added some turkey breast. YUMMY

This was easy and delicious. I didn't have all of the ingredients. So I used 6 eggs, 2 cups of sharp chedder, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 1 bag of baby spinach wilted over sauteed onions and mushrooms and some left over sauteed beet greens. I can't wait to try this with broccoli and ham, red peppers, beans. This seems truly versatile and very healthy.

Few changes based on others reviews & I wanted to make a little less so I used 4 eggs, 2-1/2 cups colby, 4 handfuls of baby spinach sauteed with onion & 1-1/2 tsp garlic.  Came out AWESOME, did not miss the crust at all because the cheese made a nice crisp base.

I've made this quiche a couple of times for potlucks and never bring anything back home.  If I'm not in the front of the line, I don't get any!  Simple to make, and you can use any kind of hard cheese.  I used sharp cheddar.

Needed a low carb meal for my boyfriend and this quiche really hit the spot. Filling, but no crust! You can really substitute different fillings to your liking for this recipe. We used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, because it is better for you. We also crumbled some bacon inside the quiche, omitted the salt, and it came out great.

I've been watching my carbs lately and was getting tired of eating fried or scrambled eggs for breakfast, so I made this one evening and cut it into slices for breakfast the next morning. It was wonderful, even re-heated. I was a little worried that the eggs and cheese would stick to the pan, but it came out cleanly without much struggle. I think that next time I might cook it a bit less than 30 minutes as it did seem a tad overdone, but that might be because of the re-heating. I think I'd also try cutting down the amount of onion - it was very onion-y.

This is excellent.  I did make it a bit healthier by only using 1 egg and substituted egg whites to make up the difference of the remaining 4 eggs. Also used only 2 cups of cheese and added mushrooms. I will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this.  To make it healthier, I decreased the amount of cheese to one cup.  To keep it a protein packed meal, I added about a half cup of diced deli ham, and one cup of cottage cheese. It turned ot great!

Easy, quick, and good.  This is my kind of recipe.  I added mushrooms, red and orange peppers, and used 3 cups of various cheeses.  I was pleased with how it looked and tasted.   I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes when we have weekend guests. I use whatever cheese we have on hand, and substitute fresh spinach for frozen in the summer. It's always great, and guests always rave.

Excellent and so easy.  I can't do omlettes but I can do this.  I didn't know what that cheese was so I used cheddar and it was fabulous.  Also I am a vege nut so I addes a little mushroom, reg/green pepper also.  Great job!

Added a crust with it as I think the crust makes a great quiche. Took longer to bake but oh man was good. Used a already made crust from the frozen section.

This was pretty good. I added a little bit of hot sauce to the mixture because I like it with all types of egg dishes. I still felt like something was missing to make it really stand out. I did like how the spinach taste wasn't overpowering. This is a great dish to get young ones to eat spinach. My toddler loved it!

This was very good!  An excellent low-carb dish.  I did add about a cup of diced ham, used half the spinach, used cheddar and swiss cheeses (1 cup each) instead of muenster and also added a cup of milk. Next time I think I will add mushrooms.  Delicious!

This is very much like a recipe in South Beach Diet except that one calls for individual ones.  This larger one is much more convenient, easier to make--and delicious.  Very low in carbs!  I didn't have a pie pan so used a square cake pan and it came out perfect.

Great quiche recipe! I used 4 egg whites and 3 whole eggs, next time I'll try 6 egg whites and 2 whole eggs. I used almost the whole 3 cups of cheese. Thanks!

Delicious & easy to make.  I loved the savory flavor & never had a quiche hold together so well.  I did modify the ingredients because my husband & I need to lower our cholesterol.  I used egg substitute instead of eggs & 2 cups of reduced fat Mozzarella cheese in place of the Muenster.

I love quiche recipes and this one was very good.  Like others, I added red pepper, some tomato, ham bits, and more cheese. Being crustless, the calories were reduced.

This was a GREAT recipe.  DH raved about it.  I added 2 chopped bacon strips and sauteed the onion and spinach in some of the fat, which added great flavor. I also threw in some chopped tomato since I had garden surplus.  I used lowfat cottage cheese and sharp cheddar.  FABULOUS results!  Definitely a winner!

This was very good and easy. I only used about 3 cups of whatever leftover shredded cheese I had - mozarella and cheddar. I used a bag of fresh spinach  - put that in the pan with the onion after it was cooked, covered it and drained as much liquid out as possible.  Then mixed about 1/3 cup of panko breadcrumbs with enough olive oil to moisten and spread that on top.

All the reviews are right - perfect basic recipe that you can make your own.  This gets 5 stars AS IS and it can even be better!  The second time I made this I added bacon and omitted the oil (and cooked the onions in the bacon greese).  I also added 2 more eggs (most people say add one, but I went off of consistency.  Enjoy, be creative and have fun! :)

This is quite tasty. One suggestion, not to cook more than 20 minutes.  A half an hour would have destroyed this.

Wow we had it for dinner last night and it was a hit.  Am bringing it to a BBQ, will double the ingredients.  Since I give my dogs a taste of most of what I make I left out the onion and used celery instead and it worked fine. Also I used a  glass casserole dish instead of a pie plate.

What a simple, fantastic recipe! I used 4 eggs and 2 c. cheddar cheese, per other reviewers' suggestions. I also added a little minced garlic and basil. The basil is excellent and adds a delicious aroma to the quiche.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added Gouda cheese instead. That is what I had on hand. If you plan to use Gouda just make sure to reduce the salt. Very versatile recipe to play with.

I really liked this recipe! It was super easy but I did make a few substitutions with the onion and cheese. I used scallions and I used low-fat mozzarella cheese and it came out fabulous :) Next time I think I will use half the butter the cheese makes this cheese creamy enough. It makes a great breakfast food...a definite keeper!

This is awesomely scruptious !  I added turkey bacon bits and sundried tomatoes. In the picture on this recipe it looks like they must have left off an ingredient (see the red?) looks like red bell pepper...so that would be good I think. I didn't EVEN miss the crust it is so good.

super easy and super good.  you can pretty much throw whatever cheese you have in the fridge and add any vegetables you want in the quiche.  was seasoned very well i used 1/2 red pepper, 1 onion, didn't have any spinch and pepper jack cheese. not quite 3 cups.  maybe 2 cups.  it all fit into my pie shell perfectly.

This was really easy and delicious! It took me about 15 minutes of prep and the 30 minutes at 350 was right on. The spinach flavor is pretty strong, so I might include something else with it like mushrooms next time, just to have multiple flavors. This will be a go-to recipe for me every time I'm on a low-carb kick!

I love how all the reviews consist of "This is amazing, I just changed it!" I too changed this recipe to suit the ingredients I had on hand, I omitted the onion but added some chopped fresh parsley, basil, and chives, about half a fresh tomato, and some leftover frozen veggies. Oh, and a good dollop of diced garlic. Yum yum!

Only made a change of cheese - used half cheddar and half Italian blend.  My family loved this - the 1 yr old and almost 3 yr old cleaned their plates and wanted seconds!  Also adding this to our Lenten rotation next year!

Yum! This was truly fantastic! My mother suggested to make it with less cheese and sub some skim milk next time to reduce fat. I will try it and see.

I made this one just like the recipe. I was wonderful. I also made it again and added another egg like others suggested. I like it both ways. My family also. I do think it is wise to add another egg, esp. If you are going to add other items.

We used sharp cheddar cheese rather than muenster, and cut it back to 2 cups.  Also added 1/2 tsp of diced garlic with the onion, and put thin slices of tomatoes on top.  A new family favorite!

Fantastic!  The entire family loved your recipe.  Thank you so much.  We used a blend of cheddar, provolone and mozzarella (it's all we had in the refrigerator).

What a delicious and sinfully easy recipe.  I'm sure it will be a regular in our rotation.  The recipe is great as is, though I've played around with it a bit.  We enjoyed the recipe with sweet red bell pepper, and 1 cup Mexican cheese blend with 1 cup fat free cottage cheese for the cheese mixture and garlic powder added a great depth of flavor.

Delicious!  It has become a house favorite.  I like to make recipes as healthy as possible.  I literally add 9 cups of spinach and it turns out delicious! So add all you want!

Very good, made with spinach, garlic  and onions. Used only 2 cups of cheese, 1 cup old cheddar and 1 cup jalapeno cheddar. Bumped up the eggs to 8 and added 2 tbsp each of skim milk and water, baked in 25 minutes in my oven, 4 servings tops not six.

This was really good.  This was my first time making quiche, too lazy to make pie crust.  Used swiss, added a little red bell pepper for color, some mushrooms, and water chestnuts for crunch.  I know I should not be rating a recipe that I altered, but you can tell even without the extras this is a really easy and tasty meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

Turned out excellent! I added left-over chicken and a little Cayenne pepper. I did substitute 1 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, only because that's what I had...other than that, I followed the directions and served it up with some couscous. Yum...will be making this again and coming up with other variations. Easy and tasty!

I really like this recipe because of the fact that it can be made with frozen spinach (cheaper and easier) however this time I actually had fresh spinach to use and also green onions from our garden! I didn't change much, just added about 1/2 cup of milk to stretch the servings a little farther and also used half the cheese because my reason for making a crustless quiche was to save calories :o) Very good and the cooking time was right on!

I have never made a quiche before without heavy cream before and I will never make another one with it!!! This was the best quiche I have ever had. I used 8oz fresh spinach and sauted it with peppers, onions and mushrooms in olive oil. I also used cheddar cheese and some feta that I needed to use up. Also topped with bacon. So many ways to enjoy this crustless quiche!

I made this recipe for my daughter's baptism and many times since then. I usually use a blend of cheddar and mozzarella cheese instead of the muenster and it comes out great.

Yum!!!  My husband wrinkled up his nose when I told him I was planning on fixing quiche for dinner so I made them a little more manly by adding lots of chopped deli ham and chopped tomato.  As he was chewing on his third muffin, he ACTUALLY said, "I shouldn't have wrinkled up my nose, these are good!"  How's that for a compliment to the chef?  I served them with "Emily's Famous Hash Browns" from this site.  Both are now highly recommended.

This was a great recipe. I doubled it and put it in a 2 Qt. dish. I also used a bag of fresh baby spinach,and shredded mozzarella and colby jack. I added 2 diced tomatoes, 1/2 a red pepper, and diced ham. Used plenty of fresh ground pepper and salt and we all loved it!! It was really satisfying. I did change it up quite a bit, but we loved the outcome.

I have made this recipe about a dozen times due to being on a low carb diet. I have changed it up quite a bit. I have never had onions to chop up so i use about 3 tbls of Salsa instead and mix that with the oil. I also you shredded parmesen cheese instead of meunster and i pour the mixture in a muffin pan so i can take one to work everyday and just pop in the microwave. Delish.

FANTASTIC! The only changes I made were the following: I used only 1/2 of the spinach pkg., added 1 clove garlic minced, 1 cup cooked crumbled turkey sausage, pinch of nutmeg, and 4 Tab. of mild chunky salsa. Also, I used only 2 cups of shredded sharp cheese instead of 3 cups of muenster cheese. PERFECTION! Everyone loved it including my 21 month old granddaughter who had 3 helpings!!!!

This quiche has a very unique flavour; not for those who don't appreciate spinach.  Lovely with the Muenster cheese and easy to make. However, where we are Muenster is very expensive, and I don't think this recipe is quite amazing enough to warrant the cost. Perhaps with a different cheese, though.

Perfect breakfast dish for anyone watching their carbs.  I make this at the beginning of the week using whatever vegetables I have on hand.  Instead of muenster I use herbed feta cheese--a lot of flavor with just a small amount of cheese.  So easy and so good.

I also put in orange and red bell pepper and a few mushrooms to up the color/flavor. Also, I reserved 1/3 of the cheese ( I used aged cheddar) for the top, which gave it a cheesy crust- yum!) My husband looked a little skeptical when I was cooking the vegetables down but he went back for seconds tonight and hasn't done that in months!

i like how this quiche is crustless as i am always looking at ways to make recipes healthier. some changes: used under 1TBSP of the oil as it wasnt necessary in my non-stick pan; added mushrooms, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2cup soy milk (that's all i had), 1 tsp basil, left over ham, and reduce the cheese to 1 cup soy cheddar and 1 cup lite mozzarella. i bake for 35min but i think i couldve left it in for another 5min. the quiche was very light and had a nice blend of flavors. it's a nice basic recipe that you can modify to suit your own taste. i definitely didnt feel guilty devouring this!

Both my husband and I LOOOOOVE this recipe, and so have all the guests we've made it for!! I normally use a 16 ounce bag of spinach and sometimes I use a little less cheese (half to 2/3 the amount called for). I also often end up using whatever shredded cheese I have on hand since I don't normally have muenster (though it is great with muenster) and it always turns out DELICIOUS!! It's also very, very easy to make.

I like a little more flavor, so I replaced a portion of the Muenster with some herb feta...just right! I really like the lack of crust...a tad more healthy and just as good.

Pretty good recipe. My only problem was that it stuck to the dish, which is entirely my fault. I managed to overlook the instruction about scooping it into a "prepared pan." Oops. Next time I'll use cooking spray on the dish first.

Delicious!!  I followed the recipe exact, with the exception of using fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I followed suggestion of putting them in a greased cupcake pan.  They were inexpensive to make, quick to put together, and looked like fancy gourmet.  It was a big hit!

Gluten free!  This is a good basic recipe, similar to what I made as a kid (which you microwaved for 9.5-11 min on med-high).  I cut the cheese in half and added 1 c. fat-free evaporated milk.  Also added some cayenne pepper.  I'll try the muffin tin and egg beaters next time.

Very good. I used olive oil and added a red bell pepper, 2 big cloves of garlic, and half a shallot after the spinach.  I would add the garlic sooner next time and maybe use a little less - I love garlic, but it was definitely present as a flavor.  I also added 1/2 c milk to the eggs.  Used two heaping cups of cheese - one part-skim mozz and one of italian blend.  Finally, I added a shake or two of nutmeg.  I baked in the 350-375 range for 40 minutes.  Perfect!  I might add bacon next time, but this way is healthier and still really tasty!

The recipe is simple as many other readers have stated...and light. For my quiche I used frozen broccoli and spinach along with 3 (real)eggs and 1/4 egg white substitution. The end result was nothing short of perfect. Great recipe!

This really gets all the points from its simplicity.  I used only 2 cups of cheese (Mexican blend), omitted the onions and chopped up a couple of cloves of garlic to saute with the spinach.  Delicious and so easy and quick to make!

I made this with what I had on hand, and ended up using a huge bag of spinach, 10 eggs, and a mix of cheddar cheese and pepper jack.  It came out incredibly well, and was a huge hit with a bit of applesauce and plain yogurt.  Just like my granny makes.  :)

This quiche is awesome.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and a 16 oz block of munster cheese.  It was just a little salty so I'll leave out the salt next time.  My whole family loved it and there were no leftovers!!

I made this it was really yummy. I doubled it as in a review and added ham, cheddar, spinach and tomatoes on top. Baked in a 9x13 glass baking dish about 40 minutes. When I saute the spinach and onions I added onion powder, garlic powder and lots of black pepper. I also added some Parmesan cheese.I will make this again soon.

I've made this twice so far - and will continue to - it is delicious and better on days 2 and 3.  I've substituted onion for leek, added garlic, and some crushed red pepper flakes - terrific!  I've also substituted leftover cheeses of various types, mixed together; finally, I;ve also substituted frozed broccoli rabe leaves for spinach - awesome.  This would also be good with swiss chard.  Thanks for such a great, versatile, recipe!

I made these in muffin tins and froze after cooling. They are delicious heated up in the microwave about 45 seconds each!
Easy to make - easier to have ready for a delicious weekday breakfast.

This was really good.  I made a few adjustments - used shallots insead of onion (personal preference) and added a cup of sliced mushroom when they were sauteing.  I also added a half teaspoon of nutmeg.  

Definitely will be remaking this.

I thought 10 oz. of spinach was too much, even though I am a spinach fan. Next time I'll try 1/2 pkg. and cheddar. Overall very good.

Delicious recipe.  I used two more eggs than the recipe called for and it came out great.  This dish re-heats very well and served as breakfast for my husband and I several days in a row.

I was looking for a crustless quiche recipe, and came across this one, and made it..WOW! So simple and so yummy!
I added some garlic to onion in pan, and used swiss instead of muenster with awesome results! Next time I might even use chopped broccoli & cheddar. Hubby even liked it!
Just wonderful!

Very good combination of flavors. I used a red onion, which added a beautiful color contrast to the spinach in the dish. Also, I didn't have a 9 inch pie plate, so I used an 8x8 glass baking dish. It still turned out perfectly with the same 30 minute baking time.

As suggested by previous critics, I added tomatoes, feta cheese, cottage cheese and cayenne pepper. I also put the mix in muffin tins and the little individual quiches were a HUGE hit!

WOW - thats all I can say! I was thinking, this sounds easy and its a quiche, I can throw this together for dinner and it will be fine. But, I threw it together and served it and everyone couldnt get enough! Everyone at the dinner gave RAVE reviews, and there were people saying how if they werent so stuffed they could just devour the whole thing... Very pleasantly surprised at how well this went over. The cahnges I made - put in about 1/2 c crumbled apple cinnamon sausage, used the extra sharp low fat cheddar, and egg substitute.  I didnt drain the spinach, and I used frozen pepper & onion blend. I nixed the oil (due to the sausage) and I just cooked it down until the pan was ready to be de-glazed. I will definitely make this again, if you're considering trying this recipe, GO FOR IT! :) Thank you so much for sharing this with us all!

I made this recipe for my family, and they absolutely LOVED it. It was so easy to make, yet it tasted high class and time consuming. I too, put some fresh tomatoes on top, which added a really nice touch to the dish.

This tastes great!  It takes a long time to bake though.  Maybe it's because I used an 8X8 square pan (I didn't have a pie pan) and an extra egg (since my eggs were small).

This is fantastic.  I used fresh chopped spinach and mozzarella cheese and it came out unbelievable!  Make sure you cook your chopped spinach with the onion to remove extra moisture like the recipe says, there is a LOT of moisture in spinach.

Tried it and LOVED it!  Even got my picky 12yr old to try it and she LOVED it.  Because I did not have one ginormous pie plate I only used half the spinach and 2cups of cheese.  I also put in some pre-cooked breakfast sausage.  Will def make again!

Fantastic!  I will definately make this again!  Variations as follows:  Instead of the 3c cheese, I used 1/2 c sharp cheddar + 1 c ff cottage cheese + 1/4 c parmesean.  I also added a small can of diced green chiles (but will toss in a few jalepenos next time to kick it up a notch) and tomatoes.  Also thinking some feta and pinenuts would be yummy!  I didn't have a pie pan so I used my 9x9 square and had to bake it 10 extra minutes.  Ate the leftovers for lunch and dinner today!

I added bacon to this and it was quite good; I'll definitely make it that way from now on.  And if I can afford it next time, I'll do Meunster as well (I used mozzarella, which tasted just fine). I cooked it for exactly 30 min, but the top seemed a bit too stiff, so next time I'll be more careful and cook it a few minutes less.

Instead of using vegetable oil, I had a half package of bacon, which I browned and then used a tablesoon of the bacon grease to saute the onions and spinach.  I also threw in some crimini mushrooms.  To compensate for the added ingredients, I added two extra eggs.  It worked out great and the bacon really added another level of flavor.  I will definately be making this again!!

Sooo good! I used 2C Mozzarella cheese and added 2 chopped Roma tomatoes (seeded), 1/2 green bellpepper (cooked with onion), 4 cremini mushrooms, 1/2 small can of green chilies for more taste...and otherwise the same. Very healthy too because it does not have any crust...good way to get kids take in daily spinach and eggs. I'll be making this every couple of weeks :)

Great easy recipe.  I used a large sized muffin tin for individual servings which worked out great.  I also just use whatever veggies are leftover from dinner the night before.  Will definitely be making these again!

This has become a breakfast/lunch staple.  It's so easy to change depending on what you have on-hand. I usually use a combination of fat-free cottage or mozzarella cheese.  I also usually add mushrooms to the mix and diced tomatoes on top.   I like to make them in muffin tins-perfect portion control.

Wow, was this one spectacular quiche. I used a full 9 oz. bag of fresh spinach (just wilted it with the onions) instead of frozen and added 12 slices cooked, crumbled bacon. Subbed monterey jack for the muenster and it was still great. This disappeared in no time.

Super yum! I substituted the cheddar like others did and put it in a muffin tin to make 12. I baked them the night before and then just reheated them in the morning. Big hit for a mother/dauther brunch that I hosted.

This was so easy and everyone loved it, both hot out of the oven and later at room temperature. I doubled the recipe, added three additional eggs, a couple of sauteed red peppers, some worcestershire and garlic sauce, and it came out great.

Would give it ten stars if I could.  I used about 2 cups of sharp cheddar and 1/2 cup parmesan and added about a teaspoon of garlic powder (of course) to the eggs. YUMMY! So delicious and made with things that I always have on hand.

This is delicious as a healthier version (without the crust). I've made it with different types of cheese for a different flavor each time. A smoked cheese (like smoked gouda) is good, also a good shredded parmesan/romano. Mushrooms are also good in it.

Great for any meal of the day! My sister and I are on a sugar detox and it turns out there's sugar in almost everything. This was a great way to break up the monotony of chicken and vegetables! We took this recipe and ran with it.. we added chicken, turkey bacon, mushrooms, onions.. It was a full meal for days, and it was delicious to boot. Oh, and if you have fresh spinach you can wilt it by rinsing it and putting it in the microwave for a minute or so. This was awesome and healthy ...I highly recommend it!

Served these for Easter Brunch and they weren't the hit I had hoped.  Not a bad flavor, but I think the muenster was a little on the strong side, and also made them a bit oily.  Next time, will use a different type of cheese.

We liked this recipe. Our grocery store didn't have shredded Muenster, so we used a combo. of cheddar and Monterrey Jack, and it turned out nicely. Very nice for people who can't have gluten or who are going low carb. We'd make this one again.

Best crustless quiche I've ever made!  Thanks for the recipe.  UPDATE: This time I used about 3 oz of fresh spinach instead of the frozen, added 1/2 cup of milk to the egg mixture, and used about 2 C of cheese.  Even better!

Excellent recipe! Easy and delicious! I would maybe next time try a phyllo dough crust... not a heavy pie crust, but something to give it a little more crunch. 
Will definitely make again!

Added splash of milk, diced red peppers, and topped with sliced tomatoes, YUM.  It didn't taste too "quichey", and when baked in a 9x9 square pan only took 20 minutes.  Will definitely be making again!

Excellent! I used Egg Beaters and a mix of mozzerella & provalone (I couldn't find shredded muenster, and didn't feel like shredding 3c. myself!). Held together nicely. The women loved it. (Men tend to prefer a meat quiche.)
Thanks!

Great recipe!  However, I would cut the onion and cheese by half & use 1/3 less spinach.  This was a very rich recipe but was wonderful.  I think next time I will use egg whites only.  I cooked these in a muffin tin and they were great bite size portions!

Wow!  This recipe was my launch for a lower fat lower cholesterol recipe... I can't get enough... I sprayed my skillet with oil, sauteed my onions (frozen, chopped) with 1 tsp of prepared minced garlic ...added 1 cup egg substitute (no cholesterol or fat), one half bag of fresh spinach and 2T of canned fire - roasted tomatoes. I reduced the cheese to whatever I have to 1 and half cups... 
I did sprinkle some nutmeg as well... I love it!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe.  I've made it several times and I love that it always turns out, regardless of how you tweak it.  Today, I used swiss rather than gruyere, and added thinly sliced cauliflower and jalapeno pepper, sauteed with the onion and spinach.  It was excellent.  I also like to add ham and fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for a great low carb recipe!

Perfect! I tossed in some diced sundried tomatoes which went really well. It did take about 10 minutes longer to cook than the directions said, but every oven is unique!

Okay, the only thing wrong with this quiche is the fact that you will want to eat the entire thing in one sitting.  YUMMY.  This is simply delicious.  My husband likes crust, so I just put it into a frozen ready made pie crust.    Also, to make sure the pie crust cooks well, I first bake the crust for about 10 minutes on 400 degrees before putting the filling in it. My husband and I both loved this, and I will definitely add it to my recipe collection!

Absolutely delicous and sooooo very easy.  I used 2 cups of pepperjack cheese vs the 3 cups of munester and it turned out perfect and the pepperjack gave it a little extra zip.  Can't imagine making a quiche any other way now.

Family and I loved this. Needed a little extra spice. We also added some delicious low fat sausages (chopped) to the mix after grilling. Added a great meat element and really made the pie. We made double the pie and ate leftovers all week. (Also used leeks rather than onions - yummo!)

It was pretty good but a tad blend. Would try adding more seasonings (salt and pepper) or sharper cheese next time!

Surprisingly very tasty - and sooo easy to make.  We dont have muenster cheese in New Zealand so I used Port Salut cheese, which I think is similar.  have made twice and the 2nd time I added some chopped mushroom which was nice also

This was a delicious dish. I augmented it with 1/8 teaspoon of garlic salt instead of plain salt, a pinch of dry mustard, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

WOW!!!  I made this for breakfast for the first time, and the only change was that I cooked a few slices of bacon - crisp - and then after draining most of the fat, added the onion & spinach to that, then crumbled the bacon into the quiche.  It was absolutely wonderful!  Oh, I had bought a red pepper to dice & add, but forgot.  Next time...

Very yummy and easy to put together!  I chunked up some leftover chicken and added it to the mix just to give it a little more substance.  Rounded out the meal with some crescent rolls and fruit.  Will definitely make again!

I have rated this recipe highly before but last night tried it with asparagus as I had a bunch that needed to be used up.  I just sauteed them with the onion prior to mixing with the eggs and added some onion powder and Mrs. Dash for extra seasoning.  I also added just a splash of milk to the eggs.  I just love this recipe because it is so versatile and fun to make and always tastes wonderful.

The flavors were yummy.  I added mushrooms in with the onions and then chopped cooked ham with the spinach.  I used 8 oz. of colby jack cheese because I couldn't find Muenster (I probably didn't look hard enough).  I saved some of the cheese for the top.  I used 5 jumbo eggs but 6 would have been better with the extra stuff I added.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper or use some pepper jack cheese for some kick.  The family LOVED it.  This is a recipe you can do anything with.  Bacon would have been fabulous in it.  It is a keeper.

Made the described recipe the first time except I used Fat Free sharp cheddar, mozzarella and threw in some swiss...came out awesome! Served to guests, and had many compliments. I made it again using egg beaters and I also threw in sliced portabellas, artichokes, & sun dried tomatoes (again using fat free shredded cheeses)....AMAZING!!!

I have to give this 5 stars for 2 reasons. 1. It was easy to make and tastes awesome. 2.My boyfriend, whom Ive been trying to get to eat spinach for 2+ years ate a slice and loved it! That in itself rates a 5+ IMO. I took some other reviewers tips and added garlic and diced ham with the onion.I used the cheeses I had at home which was monterey jack and ricotta...Will definately make this again!

Made this for the first time this morning and it turned out great.  Very easy to prepare......I used a bag of fresh spinach..white onion....some grape tomatoes.....garlic......salt and pepper....and cheddar cheese......mixed it all with the eggs and baked it in a square baking dish.  I did put the broiler on for a few minutes to brown the top a little before taking it out of the oven.  You don't even miss the crust.  My husband loved it.....the leftovers will be gone by the end of the day...

This recipe is awesome! The entire outside surface gets a wonderful self-crust instead of the typical burnt around the rim - gooey on the bottom quiche crust. And you don't even have to think about gluten! Thanks for sharing!

This is really good. I think next time I will use a little less onion and I will saute the onion with some crushed garlic. Also, I didn't use the Muenster cheese--I just used mozarella with a little sharp cheddar.

My boyfriend is on the South Beach diet so this quiche was perfect for him and he loved it.  It also reheats pretty well so he had it for breakfast all week.  I used a mild mexican blend package of shredded cheese and it was great!

This was a very delicious, quick meal.  I used old cheddar as the cheese, and cooked fresh spinach instead of frozen.  This was my first attempt at making a quiche, and it came out better than I expected!  Very quick and simple recipe!

Oh, my gosh!!  This is absolutely fabulous!  I admit that I did change things just a little, though. I used Pam cooking spray instead of oil and added 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic and a can of mushrooms (diced) to the veggies. I didn't have muenster, so I substituted 2 cups of sharp cheddar. Since I was using more veggies than the original recipe called for, I also added an extra egg (I used medium eggs). I also baked this in a frozen pie shell, so mine was not crustless. I think I just found a new favorite meal!!

A-MAZING! This was so good. I ate way too much of it. Like a frittata, and so fluffy. Used egg beaters, and it was still fabulous. I added mushrooms and vine ripe tomatoes. Delish!

This is a very easy and tastey recipe.  Although very similar to the quiche cups in the original South Beach book, we found it very good to eat.  We have played around with the recipe and found that mushrooms, asparagus, brocoli, tomatoes, ground turkey, turkey bacon and different cheese work well also.  Fontina and Havarti were tasty.  Also, we did add a few drops of hot sauce.  I recommend Franks and not Tabasco as Tabasco is not recommended for cooking.  It adds way to much heat as it is a hotter condiment and intended to be added after food is cooked.  

This is my second go round on the South Beach diet and it tends to be a little repetative during phase one so this was a good change!

I made this as individual quiches using a muffin pan for a brunch, per a user's suggestion. I also added diced red pepper, mushrooms and garlic. Thank goodness I doubled the amount - they were gone by the end of the brunch and many asked for the recipe. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! I thought the spinach might be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. This is a great option for low-carb dieters, but anyone will think it's yummy. I will try this next time with chopped broccoli for a little variety.

In 1 word...awesome.  Light, fluffy...perfectly low carb.  Since my dish was a bit bigger, I used 7 eggs.  I left everything else the same.  You don't even miss the crust in this dish!  As far as the cheese, I used what I had on hand which was a mix of Fontina, Asiago and Parmesan.  Thank you so much for sharing....this will be a staple in my home!

This was awesome.  My boyfriend and I made it for our moms for Mother's Day brunch and everybody loved it.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the cheese in half, and I also used Egg Beaters instead of eggs, but it was just as good as any quiche I've had.  I added roasted red peppers to it too, and may experiment with some other veggies in the future.  Delish!

Delicious and so easy!! I used a mixture of cheddar, mozza and monteray jack in my quiche which gave it a really nice cheesy flavour. I also made this the night before, and popped it in the oven the next morning. Worked perfectly.

Although I think this recipe is good, I changed it quite a lot. I only used 1 cup cheese and used cheddar. I also added 2 oz fat free cream cheese and about 1 cup plain fat free yogurt. I did not use the cooked onion step. Instead I substituted crushed red pepper flakes, dried minced onion, garlic powder and nutmeg.

This recipe is easy enough, but I substituted the cheeze in the recipe for Cheddar. I thought it really made the spinach taste funny. All eggs and spinach. no flavor.

Very easy.  I changed the cheese to what I had on hand - 2 Cups of low fat cheddar and 1/2 cup of low fat feta.  Had lots of zip.  Added some julienned sun-dried tomatoes.  It was great!  I have made it several times.

This is a great recipe!  I am already planning on making it again.  My husband loved it.  I didn't have enought Muenster cheese, so I used half mozzarella cheese and added a tablespoon of parmesan cheese.  This is a great low carb recipe and easy to make.  It was even good warmed up the next day.

I used 2 cups jack cheese, 1 cup feta, 2 green onions, green tops only & seasoned with dill.  It was great, so easy.  Sorry to change things, I was looking for any easy base for a greek style "pie".  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good indeed and a nice change of pace from meat. Even the meat-loving BF liked this. I added crimini mushrooms and a bit of chipotle pepper for a flavor boost. I bought a bag of frozen spinach that was 14 oz and with the added mushrooms, I added an additional egg and a bit more cheese.  Need a deep dish pie plate and a little longer baking time, but it worked well. Muenster cheese was very good.

Love this!
Subbed cheddar cheese, tossed in some chopped deli ham - it went far for a small family, and received Five Stars with me: it's simple, relatively healthy, and versatile!

This recipe is excellent!  The only thing that I changed was the addition of a bit of julienned sun-dried tomato. Great recipe!!!

very good recipe.  i mixed qith cheddar and topped with muenster.  also added a bit of minced jarred garlic and some red bell pepper.  could be considered bland by some by this recipe has so many possibilities.  will make again and try with different cheeses and fresh garlic.  might even add a bit of bacon and see what happens!

Great, easy recipe. I used 8 eggs and half a bag of fresh spinach. I only had sliced Muenster cheese so I tore the slices into small pieces and mixed it in with the egg mixture and placed 4 slices on top of the quiche. I ended up using an 8oz bag of cheese and that was plenty for me. I also added Italian seasoning and cooked green lentils for extra flavor. I would reduce the sodium or omit it all together since the quiche was a bit too salty for me.

Outstanding! I served this recipe as written for a company Christmas brunch..to rave reviews. I did not mix the spinach with the eggs as completely as in the picture to avoid the "green" look. All the guests, including the men, gave it a "thumbs-up".

I made several of this   recipe for a brunch. By not blending the ingredients, my quiche was far more appetizing than the picures shown. Will make again!

These tasted great! I added in button mushrooms and used mozzeralla cheese instead. I cooked it for 35 min but the eggs didnt look fully cooked. I will bake longer next time. These make a tasty and nutritious meal. Thank You So Much For Sharing!

I _may_ try this one more time, but only when I can get baby spinach again. I used a 16oz bag of frozen and it had an odd taste to it. Maybe because I am only accustomed to baby spinach. As per other reviews, I also only used 2 cups of cheese, an italian blend. I carmelized my onions, added minced garlic and one chopped portabello head.  I also added a few extra spices to it.  I gave this 3 stars because of the potential, but I really couldn't eat much as it is now.  But again...I think the frozen spinach is my issue.

SOOOOOO Good!  I added a little swiss cheese to the mixture and extra spinach.  The more the merrier!  I thought it might be too many extras, so I added an extra egg too.  Works well with green onions.  Came out perfect! Thanks, great recipe!

and added some sliced mushrooms. Very tasty!

SUPER GOOD!!!! I used 2 cups pepper jack & 1/2 cup reduced fat cheddar cuz that's what I had & it was awesome. I also added mushrooms. My boyfriend was sad at first to have no crust, but the overall flavor made up for it!!

This recipe was a great as I thought it would be!  I loved it.  My husband wasn't too crazy about the onions; but to me they brought out the flavor of the spinach.  I did add a bit of nutmeg to cut any bitterness of the spinach.

I said to myself, "I hope I am not wasting five eggs on this new recipe...."   No waste at all!  This was absolutely delicious. I used cheddar and mozzarella because I had no Muenster handy.  Friends who had some sat there with eyes shut, mmmmmmmmm-ing over and over.  I made a second one and added thinly sliced mushrooms and that was lovely, too.

The best!!! We love quiche and this one is soooo easy!  Probably pretty good for those low carb diets too (since there is no crust). My hubby said it was the best quiche I had ever made, and I pride myself on my homemade quiche. I did use fresh spinach that I cooked and chopped myself, but I had some I wanted to use up. I think it would be just as great with frozen chopped spinach and even easier!

Although I modified the recipe (I did a double batch, and used a dozen eggs), it still turned out fantastic.  The cheese was expensive, so I just used one pound per batch (two pounds total).

I used green peppers for half the onion & a third cup of milk, garlic powder, swiss & cheddar cheese I had which I floured w/ 2 tbsp. flour.  Was very tastey but a bit heavy/dense for quiche.  Replacing a cup of cheese and an egg w/ 8 oz. sour cream or plain yogurt, baking at 375 for 45min- an hr. would give it a lighter, creamier texture.

LOVE this recipe!!!  My husband and I are on low carbs and I will make this often.  Next time I will double the recipe and make in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  I wouldn't change a thing except maybe to add mushrooms or ham like others suggested.  Thank you for sharing!

Very delicious and extremely easy.  I actually combined two recipes.  I added about 4 oz cream cheese garlic powder to taste, and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese.  I also lined the bottom of the pan with muenster cheese and the last 5 min. put triangle of the cheese across the top.  My kids wouldn't eat it by my husband and I loved it!

This was pretty good.  It seemed a little bland like it needed some peppers or something added.  I'll make it again, but first I'll have to figure out what modifications I want to make.

Great addition to brunch!  Even my 2 boys (non-spinach lovers) liked this.  I substituted pepper-jack cheese which added an extra zip that we all liked.  Next time I'll add a little diced canned roasted red peppers or pimiento on top for added color contrast and eye appeal.  Thank you!

This recipe was good and a hit but not very exciting.  I substituted 3 cups of munster cheese with a mixture of 2% milk chedder and mozzarella cheese.  Next time I make it I want to add some spice to the quiche, I think dill would be good.

Nice basic quiche. My family enjoyed it, and we'll be making it again. Loved the muenster cheese - not something I think to add to quiche.

I was amazed at how good this was without a crust.  I didn’t have muenster cheese so  I used what I had which was a little mozzarella and cheddar with Colby.  I also added some bacon bits.  It was very good.  It firmed up nicely and the recipe time was right on.

Great recipe to get us eating our dark, green veggies! I used cheddar and parmesan and cottage cheese in my recipe, which was delicious combined with the spinach. We didn't miss the crust at all; everyone enjoyed this one!

This crustless spinach quiche is magnificent! I used one cup of mozzarella cheese and two cups of colby/jack cheese. Sprinkled a little salt and Morton’s Nature’s Seasons Seasoning Blend. Immediately shared the recipe with my sisters and daughter.

Excellent and easy meal! I used cheddar cheese and a good quantity of red pepper flakes. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!), we'll add crumbled bacon. I highly recommend this recipe as it is easily customizable and so yummy! Great for company or a relaxing dinner in with the family.

I made this but added 1slice of bacon, chopped and used cheddar cheese instead of muenster. I also added a little Fiesta (Mexican) cheese on top for the last 10 minutes. It was delicious.

I made it as a side dish for Christmas. I added a clove of minced garlic and a little extra pepper. 

I'm on keto and loved sharing this low carb meal. I served it with pan seared, foil roasted lemon peppered salmon. 

The family appreciated my low carb skills,  and I was happy to be able to eat without guilt.

I usually make new recipes as is the 1st time through, however, as I had extra veggies in the fridge to use up, I changed things up a bit. I used 4 green onions, one bell pepper, two roma tomatoes - all chopped and sautéed in a bit of OO and maybe a tsp of minced garlic until soft. Added in the spinach and cooked off the liquid. Added this veggie mix to a bowl of: 7 whisked eggs, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, the S&P as stated, about a 1/2 Tbsp dried marjoram (basil would do just fine as well). And baked for 30 min at 350 - eggs set and a bit golden brown. Turned out delicious! Will be making again!

Loved this simple quiche as it's so easy to add extras without changing the base. I added 1/4 cup of cashew milk to the eggs and instead of 5 eggs, I did 6. I also added a cup of mushrooms and some garlic as well. This is a delicious dish that is easy to prepare and the veggies can be substituted with literally anything. Next time I make this I'll try a muffin pan for easy breakfasts

Great, and pretty quick to throw together. I substituted feta cheese, taste preference and also it cuts a total of 300 calories for the whole dish. I also cut mine into 8 servings instead of 6, so total calories per piece was only 194. The spinach and feta combo tasted like I was eating spanokopita (Greek spinach cheese pie) and it was so delicious! I could see this being a great appetizer for that reason, baking in a muffin pan.

Even better with fresh spinach and mozzarella cheese, add a pinch of nutmeg.  Top with fresh tomato slices and a sprinkle of Italian Spices and Parsley.

I’ve made these as written, with extra cheese, and with sausage (pre-cooked into crumbles) and they’re delicious every way. My favorite way to make them is as mini egg cups. The minis cook at the same temp as the recipe in 18 minutes for me. They freeze well and defrost in about 30 seconds in the microwave.

I had every intention of making this is in a glass pie dish as the recipe suggests. When I got ready to assemble, I realized I couldn’t find the pie dish. Luckily, I had read another review that had used a muffin pan successfully so that is what I did. They turned out great and I actually preferred them since they were bite size. These would make an amazing appetizer. My only deviation to the recipe was to add some minced garlic. My family really enjoyed this recipe. It is a keeper especially if trying to eat low carb.

Great recipe to use up some eggs. First time making this quiche. Didnt go the spinach route. I used what i had on hand....fresh mushrooms, peppers, broccoli and cut up tomato to which i pan saute. Also had a few strips of bacon too. Threw in some mince garlic along with salt and pepper. Would have added onion but DH doesnt like it.  I followed the recipe with the specified cheese. But wondered how it would taste with creamy cheese like gouda or asiago. We didnt miss the crust .

I put the ingredients together a few days before I made it.
After I cooked the spinach and the rest of the ingredients, I didn't like the look of my eggs (I had whipped them together and kept them in a mason jar).
So, basically, it was a stovetop Spinach Quiche.  It was pretty good.  I think the next time I'll get fresh spinach.

I adjusted the recipe only because I didn’t have the exact ingredients called for.  It still turned out absolutely delicious! I used:  cheddar cheese; 1/2 of medium onion; fresh spinach and approximately 1 cup of chopped deli honey ham.  The great thing about the recipe is that you can manipulate the ingredients to suit your taste.  It was done in exactly 30 minutes. I let it set for 5 minutes and served.  I feel it serves four nicely.  If you have 6 people, I would make two.  It is great reheated in microwave.

I have made this recipe several times with the following changes: I used 20 ounces of fresh spinach, steamed first.  I then added it to the onions while cooking to give it some flavor. I also added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic to the onions. While that was cooking, I shredded the cheese. I couldn't get muenster cheese as a block so I used half sharp cheddar and half Monterey Jack. To the cheese and egg (I only used 4, not 5) I added thyme and basil, a teaspoon each. I have also added other vegetables to this, like zucchini or peas, and mushrooms. If you like bacon, this would be good also. This made a very, very yummy dish.

Wow!!! So tasteful. My upgrade was 2 cups of Muenster and 1 cup sharp cheddar instead of 3 cups Muenster. And, 3 minced sautéed garlic cloves. It’s easy for me to change it up every time I make it.

Pretty bullet proof. Maybe I don't fully know what "excess moisture" means, but I left a bit of liquid in my fry-pan with the onions and spinach. I may try butter next time instead of vege oil for a bit more richness, but the end result is perfect every time I make it. I used a Mexican blend of cheese and it was perfect as well.

This is a great base recipe. I did make changes, used old cheddar and parmesan instead of meunster, added mushrooms, fresh tomato and celery. It tastes so good my grown kids took most of it home! I will definitely make this again and being on Keto, love that it is crustless!

Easy and delicious. I have tried fresh spinach instead of frozen, and it works beautifully as well. Any cheese mix is good. I have made it with Muenster, Cheddar, feta, parmesan - this recipe is so versatile. It works well in lunchboxes as well. 10/10 would recommend

SO many reviews!  I read as many as I could and took a few into account when making this.  I did increase the eggs to 8,  used a splash of half and half, used whatever cheeses I had in the fridge (swiss, cheddar, mozzarella - it's a GREAT way to use up cheese before it goes green!), 10 oz bag of frozen chopped spinach which I sauted in a non-stick pan - then added a couple pats of butter and dumped in chopped onion and cooked on low until moisture was all but gone.  mixed everything together and dumped in a pie plate. I quartered some grape tomatoes and placed them on top and sprinkled on some grated Parmesan.    Baked for exactly 30 minutes and it is AWESOME!!  Thanks so much for your recipe and for other's reviews about what they did.

My family LOVED this.  Made it in greased Muffin pan for grab and go servings. Didn't have Meunster so used Cheddar Jack cheese.

I added lots more veggies.  Delicious.  I divided into individual servings and sealed in airtight containers.  It kept beautifully and was a quick warm-up, nutritious breakfast.

I love this quiche! I made it exactly like the recipe and it was perfect. Flavorful, quick and easy. I’ve never used Muenster cheese in quiches - only Swiss & cheddar - melts nicely and not heavy.

This turned out really good.  I varied a little and in addition to the spinach and onions, I added broccoli and peppers.  I cut back a little on the spinach to add the others.  For the cheese I did a half shredded cheddar and half feta.  The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

Made a few subs as did others. Combined Guiness Stout cheddar, sharp white cheddar and parmesan cheese.  Gave the dish a deep rich earthy flavor.  Also placed diced tomatoes on top with more shredded parmesan to add color and even browning.  Finally, because let the mixture sit in fridge overnight, added additional egg and a bit ( 1/8-1/4) c of heavy cream.   Assembled in morning and it was wonderful.  Told my husband I could add this or that and he said, leave it just like you did it.

Excellent as is or doctored up according your taste.  Try a few drops of tobacco or your favorite sauce. You can use a combination of cheeses- mozzarella, Swiss, Gouda, cheddar...yum!

I didn't have anywhere NEAR 3 cups of cheese in fridge. I used 1/2 cup grated cheese & a lot of the emergency dried parmesan. It still turned out fabulous enough to share with coworker.

I have made this several times. Instead of the frozen spinach I use chopped fresh spinach.  I add a cup of chopped bacon and instead of the muenster cheese I use 1 1/2 cup of monterey jack and 1 1/2 cups of cheddar jack.  This is a family favorite!

Awesome recipe and SO delicious! I only had a 10” glass pie dish, so I used 7 eggs, few handful of fresh sautéed spinach, mushrooms, green onions, feta, rosemary, parsley, salt & pepper. Baked for 30 min. So easy!

Okay. We have made this recipe so many times, I have lost count. We just love it. So much so that, we double the recipe and make 2 pies instead of  1 now. One of my daughters, who is EXTREMELY picky and hates spinach, loves this. The only thing we change is the type of cheese we use. We usually use triple cheddar or the mexican blend...basically whichever we have on hand. But it is one of our favorite, regular recipes. Thank you to whoever submitted this recipe.

I substituted feta for the muenster and added a bit of ham and some kalamata olives for a very Greek tasting quiche and it was great.  Probably should have reduced the amount of cheese to 2 cups since feta has such an overwhelming flavor, will probably do that next time.

A beautiful recipe, easy to make and turns out fabulous. Substitutions were 1 cup of shredded chicken, 235 gram of frico mimolette cheese, 450 of frozen spinach and a dash of smoked paprika. 13 minutes at 170 c for 12 muffins in an convection oven.

This quick
Quiche was delicious! I followed the recipe but decreased the cheese( cheddar) to a cup and a half. Next time I will use one cup. I think I will follow the advice of other reviewers and add an additional egg and some milk. It was delicious but a little dry. You could use  any veggie or cheese that you have on hand. Thanks for a great recipe!

This quiche is amazing, I added some broccoli in there too for some flavor and it came out awesome. The muenster cheese works really well in it, and it's one of my weekly staples!

I've made this several times, trying out different cheeses each time, and adding 1/2 cup to one cup of whole milk or half & half to lighten the dense filling a bit. We don't have a favorite cheese, but the recipe overall is pretty bland. (Kids might like it that way, however.) I think it could benefit from some cooked onion or green onion, some chopped ham, a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg or something to elevate the flavor a bit.

This was very good. Like everyone else, I also modified it.  I used an extra egg. I used fresh spinach, one bag ( 6 oz.) I also used  1 bag ( 7 oz.) of weight watchers reduced fat Mexican blend cheese. I also added some garlic to the onion. I will be making this again!

This was easy and quite good, although I did make a few changes as suggested. I added another egg, 1/3 C milk, sauteed onions, mushrooms and green pepper, and decreased cheese to 2 C.

One of my new make ahead favorites. I use fresh spinach and cook it down to my liking which is much better than the frozen stuff. I’ll also add a few spices depending on my mood to kick it up a notch. Perfect for the Keto diet by the way!

I added some cooked wild rice and used fresh spinach.  would use half and half next time instead of 2%.  Still great.  Cooked bacon or ham would be great in it, I'll bet.

I cute the recipe down to make for two people, used 3 eggs, one 6 oz bag of fresh spinach, 6 T of red pepper, 5 whole mushrooms, 3T chopped onion which I sauteed in olive oil.  I squeezed all of the liquid out of the spinach mixture and added to the 3 eggs and one cup of cheese with 1/4 t salt.  Baked for 30 min and it was excellent. Next time I may add  one more pinch of salt and possibly some garlic.  You could throw any veggie in this and it would be good, you do not miss the crust at all.

I've made this several times. I use fresh saute spinach and add cut in half cherry tomatoes on top with a little parm cheese. It is delicious.

I used a bag of fresh spinach that I wilted after the onions were soft, and swiss cheese with a little cheddar. I also used six eggs (since mine were a bit small) and a half cup of milk. Delicious!!!

I used 1 C. shredded mozzarella cheese and 2 C. Mexican Mix shredded cheese instead of  Muenster.  Worked well.  I also added some garlic powder. This recipe is pretty adaptable.  Next time I will NOT use additional salt in the recipe. There is plenty of salt in the cheese.

I cut down on the onion because a whole onion sounded like too much for this dish.  I also went with 2 cups of cheese instead of three.

Everyone ate the dish. With just three people it was gone within an hour.  It was light, easy, and I'll make it again.

This is the third time I’ve made this dish. The first time by the book. The second I added mushrooms which was ok. Don’t know if I’ll do that again though. And this time I needed to change it up a bit with all Organic ingredients. It took a while to chop 10oz’s of fresh spinach. Wasn’t quite ready for that first thing in the morning. The judges have all rendered their decisions now and once again have unanimously given the thumbs up for this Crustless Quiche recipe. Thank so much for making me a star in the kitchen.

Made this for Easter morning - so good. Did not have frozen, but used fresh spinach. My daughter and daughter-in-law loved it and left with the recipe. Thanks for a fabulously easy wonderfully tasty recipe. Except for the spinach followed recipe exactly. So very good.

Oh my, this quiche is sublime! I did use different cheese to kick it up a notch. Instead of muenster, I used half smoked Gouda and half gruyere, coarsely grated. I was thrilled with the flavor! I didn't add any salt and didn't miss it. Simply delicious!

We really enjoyed the quiche. I used ingredients I had on hand, so I used swiss cheese and added canned mushrooms to the onions and spinach. We will definitely make it again. I was easy to double and make two at a time.

This was fantastic. But I do have some notes. I used a muffin tin to make many instead of one big one and cut, and it worked perfectly. I also used a blend of Muenster and mild cheddar, was very good. It’s very easy and a fantastic brunch dish.

I  used this recipe as a basic guide for making a crustless spinach quiche with eggs and cheese (any kind).  I improvised with what I had in the fridge, I just wanted something hot and yummy like this for my family on Sunday morning.  It worked great! I used a blend of Italian shredded cheeses and shredded mozzarella, and I even used one less egg and it still tasted great, everyone loved it!

Substituted following low fat version but added Swiss instead of cheddar. Really like the easy no crust versions. Sauté of mushrooms and onion, added cottage cheese and Parmesan and only 3 eggs. Yumm!

As I had no cheese or spinach, I used green onions, kale, and mushrooms. In fact, I added an amount of each that meant I had to add three more eggs. I'm eating some now, and it's delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I added garlic while sautéing the onions, then added fresh spinach until leaves were soft. When I added everything together I also added sausage. I tend to use what ever cheeses I have on hand when I make it. So far all have been delicious!

Loved the simplicity of this, didn't have the cheese called for so I used Swiss and feta.  It was perfect, tasted great, looked just like your picture.  I will make it often.

I thought this was yummy, a little bland though. I added some red bell peppers and milk, but I think it could have used more seasoning. Overall it will be a yummy breakfast this week!

I used fresh spinach, and added some mushrooms. Didn't have Muenster cheese but had some swiss and parmesan. Also I mixed some heavy cream because I had a little left. Turned out awesome. Complimented with some cantaloupe

A little dry and needed more, so I remade it, adding sliced mushrooms to the saute and a layer of thinly sliced tomatoes under the cheese. Very good.

Made it, Loved it!  I did make some adaptions.  Did not have enough Muenster so I added what I had and supplemented with swiss.  I also added bacon bits.  I will definitely be making this again.  Considering making it as mini quiches using muffin pans. Thank you

I will be keeping this in rotation. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, added garlic and dill and used feta & mozzarella instead of muenster. I served this with a mixed green salad and some fruit, perfect lunch!

I used frozen onions. Then the sautéing didn’t have to be done. My family isn’t a fan of onions. The frozen ones are mild. Mixed everything together first then folded spinach a cheese. I used Colby jack because that’s what I had at home. Loved it! Very versatile. Easy. This is going to be a weekly dish in my house. I made it on Sunday. Had it for breakfast every day.

Straight from the oven this was okay, however reheated was not.  The consistency was odd.  Will stick to my own recipe which calls for a can of evaporated milk.

My hubs and 14yo son are gobbling it up! I used fresh spinach  with a pinch of nutmeg and added an extra egg. I used cheddar because that's all I had. Served with fried potatoes. They both want it again, that's high praise!

I made this and used Monterey jack cheese- next time I would use swiss cheese and/or parmesan cheese, to give it a sharper flavor.  I also 2 deep dish defrosted pie crusts to cook it in.  I didn't add the onion and I increased the eggs to 15 total for 2 quiche.  I also only used 1- 12 oz package of chopped spinach total and split it between the 2.

I blind baked the crust first. I used fresh baby spinach. 
I sliced the left overs and then reheated on my cast iron griddle. Gave it a wonderful new flavor. Didn’t try for hot, just warmed enough to soften the cheese. Preferred to the first bake.

Made crustless spinach quiche with crusts. I used jumbo eggs and 6 rather than 5. I used fresh spinach that I chopped and sautéed with onions, garlic, and mushrooms. I used shredded sharpe cheddar cheese. I was able to use pour the mixed ingredients into two regular nine inch pie crusts.
They were delicious.

I made the original recipe for Christmas brunch.  I also made two other recipes.  This was the favorite.  I just made it again.  This time, I used an "italian mix."  I also put in some italian essence herb mix.  I like it, but not as much as I liked the original recipe.

This was delicious, and I was pleased that it sliced so easily.  Although the recipe indicated 6 servings, I cut the quiche into 8 equal portions, and the size was fine for me.  I am hoping that it freezes well so that I can pull out individual portions for breakfast.

I used a ceramic pie dish in place of the cast iron skillet (because I don't have one).  I also chopped up some cilantro and added it to the eggs (because I had some left over from the previous days dinner).  And I added fresh baby bella mushrooms in with the onions as they were sauteeing.  My fiancé and I both loved it and it is on our list of dishes to have again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did read some of the comments.   A half cup milk, 1 egg, and different cheeses were used.  I plan on making again.  I think you could take the basic recipe and add whatever are you favorite ingredients.   Easy to make!

I'll make it again but with a little less spinach the next time so you taste the cheese and onion mix more.

This is my emergency dinner or my "look at me whipping up a quick quiche, feel free to be impressed" dish. I almost always have all the ingredients and people love it, even quiche haters. No fail recipe.

it was made.  I will certainly make it again & two of my guests
wanted the recipe as well.

Came out very well the first time I made it.  I used a Monterey Jack and Cheddar blend as a substitute. Guests raved about it.

After reading all the reviews, I agree -- this is a great base recipe.  I made the following changes.  I used a normal sized bag of fresh baby spinach that I cooked in olive oil.  When the spinach was about 1/2 way done I added minced garlic, minced onion, diced red pepper and fresh mushrooms that I sliced.  Meanwhile I beat 10 eggs, added a some milk and used a whole bag of Kraft Italian blend cheese.  Once the veggies cooled I added them to the egg mixture.  Buttered a deep dish casserole pan, poured the mix in.  Sliced grape tomatoes in 1/2 and placed on top.  Then I grated fresh Asiago cheese on top of the tomatoes, sprinkled with some fresh ground pepper and into the oven it went.  350 for about 22 minutes.  It was PERFECT!  Will make again!!

This recipe is delicious and I love that there is no crust! I substituted cheddar and mozzarella because that is what I had on hand. I also broiled it on high for the last few minutes to brown the top.

It also reheats great.

This came out really well with a couple small changes. First I used 6 eggs, next time I'll use 8. Also this recipe didn't call for muenster cheese but I added some anyway and it was delicious. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the lack of cheese and only 5 eggs would make it too thin..

Very good and healthy.  The next time that I make it though I plan to use egg beaters.  I also made mine with cheddar cheese instead of muenster.  Yum Yum

I just put a little less salt, due to the fact that the cheese has it's own salt. I baked them small muffin sized. That size was better appreciated and they went over very well for our Christmas brunch. Pay close attention to the temperature of your oven. Mine was too high, so they turned out a bit over baked. I will definitely make again. Sorry, I forgot to take a pic. Next time.

I made it Christmas morning for  my sister who is on one of those ketogenic diets.  It was perfect for her and the rest of us liked it as well.  Yes, I would definitely make it again.  I might add a half cup of cream to make it a bit fluffier.  This is a very good recipe.

I followed the recipe as stated. The onion I used was yellow and large; I was surprised that it gave a sweetness to the quiche when first baked. Otherwise, the quiche has a very mild flavor, bland. The recipe is simple and would be helped by adding some savory items.  I noticed that the sweetness was not noticeable when I reheated the quiche the next day.   The next time I make this I will add chopped bacon or ham and maybe some hot sauce. The recipe filled a 9” pie pan plus a one cup ramekin.

I used gruyere cheese and added  1/4 cup feta cheese and 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes... yummy! I also partially filled (2) 8-1/2" pie pans and it was perfect! My kids loved this and so did the adults!

I used 1 package of a Mexican blend shredded cheese, which was approximately 2 cups and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. I sliced Campari tomatoes and layered on top, other than that I made the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect. I was looking for a quiche recipe without the crust. This was easy and could be made with ingredients that are always on hand. I love the idea that you can refrigerate, cut a piece and microwave for a delicious breakfast or  snack. Perfect recipe!

I have made this twice and it was a big hit. I appreciate that someone wrote in their review that you can double it and use a 9x11 pan instead of two smaller pans. Will try that next time. Very easy and very delicious recipe.

This was excellent!  I used 6 eggs instead of just 5 and cut the cheese down to about 1 cup.  I also added about 1/4 cup of sun dried tomatoes.  It turned out super tasty and was a huge hit at our Christmas brunch!

Easy, easy, easy. I used the Munster cheese, but I think you can use Mozzarella as well. I also added a little chipotle Tabasco because we like just a small kick. Made several for my low carb friends, baked and delivered warm on Christmas morning

We loved it and the  recipe was easy to make it be your own. I added some mushrooms, 2 slices of crumbled crisp bacon, used 3 cheeses: munester, cottage cheese and feta and added some nutmeg. I also used 6 eggs,  2 tsp. flour and a pinch of garlic powder. I microwaved a box of fresh spinach. The quiche took 10 minutes longer than suggested before it was done and that may due to changes I made.  Definitely a keeper.

I added some chopped red and orange bell peppers to add color for the holidays and used a simple olive oil crust.  It turned out great.  I like the flavor of the Muenster cheese.  Next time I may just use my muffin tin and no crust to make grab and go bites for breakfast before work.

Quiche turn out great. Only use as a template. Added Chinese Sausages, Imitation crab meat. Use Eggbeater instead of eggs. Quarter cup = 1 egg. Also added 2/3 cup 2% milk.

I didn't have spinach, so I  used mixed vegetables instead. I also loaded it with grated cheddar cheese and garnished it with cocktail tomatoes. The dinner table was quiet except for the sounds of good food being enjoyed by my appreciative famy. Thanks for the inspiration and the recipe.

I’ve been reducing carbs in my cooking, and this fit in perfectly.  I used almond flour, and added finely chopped spiral ham.  It also reheats perfectly.  I didn’t miss the crust at all.

LOVED IT - made some changes after reading reviews, also to balance my nutrients and calories - such as 2 cups of cottage cheese and 1/2 cup shredded cheese, 3 whole large eggs and 3/4 cup egg white product. It was SO GOOD without a crust! We will eat this again and again!

This was very good.  My husband even commented a couple of times how much liked it.  The only change I made was to add a little nutmeg and some ham bits.  The quiche set up really nicely and we didn't even miss the crust.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made two for brunch and added a crust to one of them. Used more spinach and less cheese because the frozen spinach was loosely packed in a larger bag than called for.  Everyone enjoyed both versions. The Muenster cheese was surprisingly good.

Excellent taste and gluten free.  I loved it. My only comment is that it is heavy to eat with all that cheese.  A little piece is all you need with frui or a salad.

I took elements from this and another recipe and changed it a bit. Instead of the 5 eggs and 3 c. Muenster cheese, I used 3 eggs, 1 cup low fat cottage cheese, 1/2 cup low fat grated cheddar,  and 1/4 cup grated parmesan. I also added sliced mushrooms to the spinach saute mixture.  I make this often, and usually double the recipe. You'll need to double the cooking time if you double the recipe. And,  adding cooked turkey sausage is a nice change.

I would love to say I made this as written, but I can't lie, I didn't.
I used fresh spinach, Mexican cheese blend and keeping with the Latin theme, a couple of teaspoons of Taco seasoning. I also added a cup of non-fat milk because, in my world, quiche needs milk. What came out of my oven was a golden-brown, puffy, pan of deliciousness. If I had any less self control I would have eaten the whole thing.  Play with it, and find out what other wonderful things you can do with this recipe.

Very good, however I used cheddar instead of Munster cheese. It was salty. I’m thinking it was the cheddar but not sure. Next time I’ll omit salt altogether.  Will make again. Easy and tasty.

This is my go to recipe. I love this quiche! I'm not a fan of Muenster cheese so I did Cheddar instead and baked in a 9x9 or 8x8 pan. It's great with breakfast and a slice of toast. ??

Nice recipe, but not really a "crustless quiche".  Quiche is made with cream or milk as well as a crust.  This is a frittata.  I use whatever cheese I have on hand and enjoy the addition of mushrooms and/or artichokes, too.  Monterrey Jack is a good substitute cheese if you don't have Muenster.

I’ve been making this forever, but I add the eggs to the pan after it’s all cooked and cooled a bit, then put the pan in the oven and it’s called a frittata... since there’s no crust it’s not a quiche from what I’ve been told... but who cares it’s delicious! One of my favorite things to freeze up an take to work so I can have a nice hot breakfast at the office!

I love this recipe.  I switch it up quite a bit.  Sometimes I use aparagus, bell peppers, different cheese.  I love making it with 6 eggs 3 of which are egg whites, spinach and goat cheese.  

I always use one onion but I like to add a small pad of butter to my oil for flavor. 

sometimes Ill throw in ham or bacon also.  Quick easy and a great on the go treat

We love this recipe and it has become a regular at our house. You can add some extras if you like - at times we will add Canadian bacon or mushrooms. Literally we went from not knowing what Muenster cheese was to adding it onto our weekly grocery list. I think the cheese is the key. Don't try to cut corners by going with something different. This cheese blends / cooks perfectly. It is THE BEST!! LOVE THIS. By the way, we have made it upwards of 50 times, each time it has come out absolutely perfectly.

It was ok. It was least favorite quiche i have ever had. I was going for healthy with the spinach, but it just didnt work. I ate the first piece, but the rest sat in the fridge for the week and ended up being thrown out. I think i just do not like spinach no matter how i fix it.

I love it.  I doubled the recipe and put it in 9X13 pan.  I used butter instead of oil for added flavor.  It is delicious.

Easy recipe! I added some parsley into the egg mixture right before pouring into a pan. Then put 5 fresh thyme on it also as garnish :) Sprinkled salt and freshly grounded black pepper and baked in oven. :))))) It was so delicious!!! Will definitely make it again.

Excellent. The only deviations I made were I used an 8-inch glass baking dish, and I only used 1/8 teaspoon salt. Otherwise everything was the same, and it was delicious. The whole family enjoyed it for breakfast.

I can't believe I'm going to say this, but it's too much cheese. It's definitely tasty, and I'll make it again. But next time, I'll do less cheese and 1 more egg. Also, I used half an onion because I'm not a huge onion fan. However, I think it needed more, so a whole onion is probably a good call.

Absolutely delish!  As with others, I had a BYOC (be your own chef) moment and added a few tweaks:  1) added fresh diced garlic with the onion, 2) added kale with the spinach, 3) added diced red/green peppers, 4) added sundried tomatoes, 5) added 1/3 cup of cooked red quinoa and 6) used a cheese mix of cheddar and manchego cheese.

I made three quiches in one day.  All cooked at the same time.  All were fantastic.  We grow Swiss Chard in abundance and use it instead of spinach.  The quiches were perfect.  This recipe is a keeper.

I doubled the recipe and I added turkey sausage, and 4 different cheeses (one cup each of mozzarella, swiss, medium cheddar, and muenster.  I baked it in a 9x13 glass casserole.  It was a HUGE hit for my ladies bible study group.  They all want the recipe.

Used what I had on hand, fresh spinach and cheddar cheese. Had to add a couple more eggs because of the amount of spinach. Easily adapted recipe! Would be good with mushrooms too!

This was a great foundation for a recipe....however, I’ve made a quiche before so I was able to adjust the recipe for something a bit different. I used 6 eggs, 1 and 1/4 bag of shredded Italian mix cheese,  a 5oz bag of fresh spinach, some cubed ham (no real measurement but enough to know the amount was going to work), 1/2 chopped onion, and chopped white mushrooms.  And I had to cook it for 45 minutes at 350 b/c there was more substance tot he dish. Came out beautifully!!!  It was a great brunch quiche!

I just made this to take as breakfast for the next week.  It was very easy and has a lot of flavor from the muenster cheese.  I added some chopped mushrooms for texture and would probably use fresh spinach next time.  And there will definitely be a next time.

Super easy to make. Everyone loved it. I did not add onions because the kids don't like them. I used the microwave spinach and cooked as directed. Then cooled and squeezed the water out by draining as much as possible then wrapped the spinach in paper towels the get the rest of the water out. It turned out great

I used cheddar, a lot of it, and butter rather than oil. It had a rich creamy texture, and was absolutely delicious. I will be making this again, and again.

I make this all the time. It's great to take a piece to work and zap it in the microwave for lunch. I modify with whatever I have handy—different cheese (like shredded cheddar), fresh spinach instead of frozen (I prefer), chopped tomatoes or ham, it's all good. I do add a bit of milk or half-and-half when I beat the eggs.

I rated it a 5 because it is simple to prepare, turns out a great crustless quiche, and is very versatile.  I have added some additional seasoning, chicken, and  feta. I also use cheddar cheese because Muenster is not as readily available where I am.  No matter these changes, the quiche comes out lovely!
So I see it as a versatile recipe.

I've been looking for a healthy, low carb option for breakfast and this one fulfills the need. It's tasty and easy to put together. I did use ingredients I had on hand (2 cups mozzarella and 1 cup sharp cheddar in place of muenster), but followed the recipe otherwise and it came out perfectly delicious!  Would be great  brunch offering for low carb or diabetic guests. Will be my breakfast for the rest of this week and I will definitely make this one again!!!

Wow!  I made this yesterday for my family. I added an extra egg and mushrooms to the mix, but the outcome was fantastic. What a great solution to grabbing a quick meal in the morning before heading to work or school. Very delicious!

This Quiche is Amazing!  I've made it many, many times. For Dinner, All Holidays, Girls Appetizer night (and Wine) :) picnics. So, so Good!!  Each time I add some different  ingredients.  Canned Crab, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Red & Orange Peppers. What ever I'm in the mood for.

This is more of a cheesy frittata than a quiche, as it is dense and lacks the “flan like texture” of a quiche because it lacks milk or cream. A disappointment, given all the positive reviews.

This quiche is great!  I used pepper jack cheese instead of muenster and broccoli instead of spinach.  I think green chiles would have been a nice addition, too.  But, alas, I didn't have any available

I can not eat Gluten but I love quiches. I was so happy to find this recipe. I have made it more than once and often add other veggies. I add less onion's and I cook them longer than the recipe asks for because I do not like onion's very much. I always share all my food that I make with other's and this was a big hit!

Based on other's tips, I used large muffin pans (made 9 but could've made them larger). I also used 10 oz. of fresh spinach which I roughly chopped and simply mixed it with the cooked onion (didn't cook the spinach). Prior to baking,  I sprinkled additional shredded cheese on the individual quiches.

Made this for a brunch and it was a huge hit! Needed to make it ahead and travel so I made the mini quiches in the muffin tin and froze them. They thawed beautifully and tasted fresh and yummy! Making it again for another crowd this weekend. Thanks Allrepices!

Great option especially if doing low-carb. I did not have any Muenster Cheese on-hand, so I just used Mozzarella and some cheddar, and it turned out just fine.  Whole family enjoyed so I will be making this again.

This is awesome!  Very easy to make, I have made it several times.  Even works when you accidentally upsize the cottage cheese.  I see this as very forgiving, can easily add meat if you choose.  I rather liked it with out.  Keeper for sure!

I love this dish! I eat it every morning for breakfast. It's a delicious way to get vegetables into your breakfast and start the day off right. I have made this as written, but I have added these changes that work out very well based on other reviewers comments:
1. I don't add any salt to this dish - the cheese adds enough sodium to be salty enough.
2. I add whatever leftover veggies I have on hand. Sometimes broccoli, but usually I will add sweet bell peppers or jalapenos. I add about 1 cup of extra veggies and fry them up with the onions and spinach.
3. I increase the eggs to 10 medium sized eggs. 
4. I use whatever cheese I have on hand, and not very much of it. Probably about 2 cups. Usually I add feta, but I love adding pepper jack if I have it.
5. Lastly, I bake these in greased muffin tins (it makes 24) for about 20 minutes. They store beautifully in the freezer and I pop 2 in the microwave for 30 seconds each morning for breakfast. 
Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I love, love, love this quiche! It's so easy and without a heavy crust (which I love, but don't need anymore). Thank you for a wonderful recipe which is great as is written or adaptable to add one and whatever is in my fridge. My family loves it, even my picky eaters! ??

This is a good base recipe, I had friends show up unexpectedly and whipped this up for lunch with what I had on hand. Now for the changes... I carmelized the onions, added 1 T of minced garlic (from a jar), added diced ham (lunch meat ham), I used sharp cheddar on the bottom of the pie pan (it made a crust of sorts), monteray jack for the mix in cheese. I also added 2 T of full fat rocotta and blended into the eggs with a splash of heavy cream. They are it all and requested I make it again so I'll take that as a success.

Yes!  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I:
1) Mixed cheddar and  ricotta cheese until I had the correct amount.
2) I put into my spinach onions, chopped garlic cloves, and my oil was strained bacon grease. I did that mostly for flavor.
3) Then I added the salt, pepper, and two Tbs. of garlic powder.
I then went on to cook as directed.

The first time I made this, I mostly followed the recipe, except I substituted Swiss cheese for the Muenster, since my grocery store's selection was limited, and I also added 2 extra eggs.  It was very good.

The second time I made this, I used a 12oz. package of chopped spinach, Swiss cheese, a chopped and sauteed onion, some heavy cream, more eggs, and a whole package of bacon, cooked and crumbled.  Even better!

The third time was the best - 9 eggs, 1/4 C. heavy cream, 12 oz. chopped spinach, lots of sharp white cheddar, one chopped and sauteed onion, and a package of cooked and crumbled sausage, baked for an hour.  Very tasty, filling, and low-carb!

That's what's great about this recipe, you can monkey with it all you like, and the results are still fabulous!

AWESOME recipe! I hate to be “one of those people” who comments on the original recipe with a bunch of alterations, but I just had to pass on my remarks because this is a truly versatile recipe - and pretty hard to screw up! I swapped the onions for chopped green onions/scallions sautéed in oil and minced garlic. To lighten the recipe a bit, I used 3 whole eggs + the equivalent of 3 eggs (via egg beaters/whites in a carton). I only used 2.5 cups of sharp cheddar (which tasted awesome with the green onions!). By the time I added the onions/spinach mixture to the egg/cheese mixture it was pretty thick. So I dumped a little bit of milk in there to thin it out. Not much - but just enough. Threw in a dash of nutmeg and baked it in a glass pie dish for approx 30 mins and let it set up for 10+ mins. This is a fantastic recipe!! So easy and versatile! I can’t imagine it with crust - I feel like a crust would take away from how flavorful it is without!

Excellent, moist, easy to make.   Muenster add a great flavor and is not stringy.  May add bacon or hame the next time that  I make it.

I have made this dish so many times. It is great! I always sauté fresh mushrooms with the onions and add the spinach frozen rather than thawed in the interest of time. It turns out perfect every time. Fresh garlic is the key!

I thoroughly enjoyed this crustless quiche. My husband did not although he cannot tell me why......I think he needs to gnaw on flesh....so nothing wrong with the recipe!  I used Gruyere, perhaps 2 cups. I am looking forward to having the remainder all to myself. Today for lunch, perhaps cold and later in the week for dinner, reheated. I like the firmness of the quiche, the flavor,  as well as such easily digested protein. LOVE the spinach with all the vitamins and minerals it adds. Delicious recipe, simple to make with standard pantry ingredients. I will be making this again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe! I altered a few things: sautéed onion and mushrooms, then threw  fresh spinach in with that.  Added a few tablespoons of milk, a pinch of nutmeg, and only used four eggs. Cheddar was great with this.

This came out perfect! I substituted gruyère for the Munster and it was amazing. Came out perfectly the first time, and I’m no chef. Very easy. Love the lack of crust, because I eat around the crust normally with any quiche.

Easy and delicious! I used white, sharp cheddar as I didn't have the Muenster, doubled it and baked in a 9 x 12 baking dish. Will certainly make again and was awesome the next day for a quick take to work breakfast!

This was great. I used fresh spinach and added a few dashes of Cayenne pepper. I used the cheese I had on hand which was about half mozzarella and half Swiss for about 2.5 cups. Delicious.

I've never made quiche before, and this was amazing!  I didn't miss the crust!  After searching for my missing pie pan, I wound up using a 9x9 corning ware dish that worked just fine.  This is a great base recipe allowing for customizing to your own taste.  I sautéed fresh minced garlic with the onions, used half sharp cheddar and half Swiss cheese, and added about 6 oz. of diced ham.  Wonderful and so easy!

This is not really quiche. More like egg pie. There's no milk or cream to make a custardy body with the eggs. And the spices are rather boring.  So if you want a creamier, richer, more flavorful dish add two cups of milk or half and half and nutmeg. much better with just those two additions. It is a good breakfast casserole as written however, though rather flavorless.

So delicious and simple.
I used 5 eggs and a mixture of sharp shredded cheddar and shredded swiss (not a huge muenster fan).
Topped with sliced tomato 10 minutes before timer.
I couldn't find my pie plate (!?), so I used an 8X8 glass square.
Thank you!!

Easy, quick, and very tasty. It also freezes well. I make it for myself then freeze in quarters for other days. Every time I serve it someone asks for the recipe. It is easy to swap vegetables to what I need to use up or have on hand.

This recipe is amazing for using up leftovers! Today I made three versions of it. I had leftover ham steaks that I chopped & made two quiches with. One has Pepper Jack Cheese chopped and I made the other ham and Mexican blend shredded cheese. The third was leftover fresh broccoli and cheese. I have made this recipe as written! My favorite recipes are the ones you can switch up and still enjoy! I’ve done Roasted Vegetables, Onions and Cheese, whatever seems to work. We like things with some spice. Add hot sauce, pepper flakes, fresh ground pepper, hot Paprika....it all works! This is a simple staple that I use all the time! Great to take to work with a side salad!

Fabulous!  Added some corn.  Made it with 2/3 Muenster and 1/3 Swiss.  Put in some of my favorite spices.  I will definitely make this several more times.  Perfect for pot lucks.

So easy to make. Based on previous reviews, I made it with 2 cups of cheese and 6 eggs. I baked them in 48 mini muffins tins for about 12 minutes. Came out great. Even my egg-hating kid ate a dozen (of the bite sized mini muffins quiches).

Excellent recipe!  It has all the right flavors when made according to recipe.  Adding an extra egg or two would decrease it's density.  Will be making this one again!

wonderful dinner with items we always have on hand.  I used a mix of cheddar and pepper jack because that's what I had.  Also added some cooked bacon bits.  Made into small muffins, decreased time by 10 minutes.  Even Jesse liked this quiche!!

I made it the first time and it tasted good. I made it a second time and swapped out the Muenster for crumbled feta and a hand full of parmesan. I also thought it tasted better with just egg whites and a half cup of half and half. No salt needed since feta is a bit salty.

I've been making a very similar recipe for years. This one is a little heavy on spinach, and I use 1/2 cup of half and half or heavy cream in mine.  I very often add chopped marinated artichokes, crumbled cooked bacon, chopped ham or any combination. Almost any kind of cheese will work, so experiment to suit your own taste. Very easy and tasty.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I used fresh spinach that I sautéed in butter and I added a can of mushrooms. I had various shredded cheeses that I needed to use so it got the mild/sharp cheddar and Colby jack treatment. It’s a great recipe for low carb and keto lifestyles. It’s still great reheated too.

I will absolutely make this again.  Everyone LOVED it including 3 kids, 1 of which won't eat anything green.  I have a family of 6 so I made a double batch.  Trading some of the other reviews I opted to use 12 eggs instead of 10 (remember I am making a double batch)  and I used 4 cups of cheese instead of 6.  It was moist and fluffy.

Great basic recipe!  Like many other reviewers, I added a lot less cheese.....I'm sure its fabulous with 3 cups of cheese but that's at least 2 cups too much for me.  I've made this many times, with all different vegetable combos.  Everything works with this recipe.  I also make it in a 10" deep dish pie plate so I add 2-3 more eggs then called for, it turns out perfectly every time.

I made quite a few changes as I was actually making quiche and Frozen deep dish pie crusts and just use this as a basic idea of what to do as it had been lots of years since I had made the quiche I used to make quite frequently. I think I ended up using a total of 12 eggs two packages of frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry and like four cups of sharp cheddar cheese. I also added some garlic powder onion powder. I also added some garlic powder onion powder a little bit of salt and some

Delicious.  I did a mixture of Parmesan and muenster cheese instead of just muenster, use fresh spinach, and omitted the onions (I always omit the onions because I can't stand them.)  I also poured the mixture into a pie crust.  Turned out great.

This is an excellent base recipe you can fiddle with for your family's specific tastes. For instance I used cottage cheese, feta, and parmesan cheese instead of the Muenster that was called for in the recipe.  I like the cottage cheese because it adds some creaminess to the eggs. Quiche is one of my favorite meals no matter what time of day, so I always make one batch in a pie pan, and a second batch in muffin tins for an easy breakfast on the run.

I found this quiche pretty good. It was easy to make and good for those that are wanting to watch their carbohydrate intake. I made the recipe as is with the exception of using fresh spinach and cooking it down instead of using frozen spinach.

This recipe is so versatile, I've made it several times and each time I try something new.  Feta, swiss, gouda cheese.  Try adding some sun dried tomatoes or mushrooms.  YUMMY!  Always turns out great.  I Always use two boxes of frozen spinach.

Didn't have the muenster cheese so I used a combination of aged cheddar and mozzarella.

Very tasty!  I like to follow a recipe exactly the first time. Amazingly I had everything I needed. Cooked in an 8x8 glass dish. 30 minutes. Didn’t turn out super fluffy but not too thin either. Yes it was very dense with spinach but I liked that. Also if you reduce the spinach the saltiness might be overpowering. Next time I might try a combination of cheeses and less or no salt. Kids don’t like mushrooms or that would have been a perfect combination.  Good starting point to adding bacon, skipping the salt, adding a crust.

I read many reviews before I made this and like the vast majority of cooks I too made a change.  I made this over weekend and we had the leftovers for breakfast. I did change 1 thing and that was the addition of 3/4 cup whole milk.  Next time I make it I will add another egg and make it a whole cup of milk making the texture more quiche like.  It is a nice basic recipe that I will change up.

First try for quiche and it was wonderful. This recipe is a keeper. I had fresh spinach so I wilted it and place on cutting board to cut into pieces as other reviewer suggested. I had gouda, mozzarella, Irish sharp cheese in the frig and I added a German soft cheese with a pecorino shredded all left over from another recipe and it made the dish. What I really like is that the leftovers (there's only two of us) were great for two lunches. Yum. Will definitely make this again. Don't miss the crust or the calories. :-)

Good base for a very adaptable quiche. I cooked up some mushrooms with the onions and added some bacon I'd already fried the morning before. I had a strange collection of cheeses on hand so I put 1 cup fresh parmesan and 1 cup of cottage cheese in the quiche, then sprinkled a little leftover aged cheddar on top. Came out better than I expected, so I'm pretty sure any cheese combination would do - and I think that 2 cup+a bit is plenty rather than the 3 cups called for. I'll probably keep making this which whatever mix-and-match additions or cheese I happen to have around.

I made this two days ago and am making it again today for a potluck. I loved making it and eating it. Great for my low-carb, high-protein diet. And great, too, I guess, for people avoiding gluten. I used six large eggs and mozzarella instead of muenster. This time I'll use half mozzarella and half Swiss.

I only used 8 oz of the cheese. It was plenty and tasted great. I also left out the salt and pepper and let each person salt to taste.

Loved this low-carb recipe - It was a little plain (but delicious), so I added ground sausage and a little extra cayenne the second time, and loved it even more.  Either way, a wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

I changed the shredded cheese from Muenster to an italian cheese mix (Mozzarella, Provolone, Romano, Parmesan, Fontina, Asiano) because I couldn't find the shredded Muenster.
I also added additional fresh ground pepper.  This will no be a regular in our home. I tasted even better the next day when warmed up.

Fantastic recipe with some modifications.  I lost track of what I was doing when I was breaking the eggs and ended up with too many in there, so I added another handful of spinach to even it out, then threw in some bacon and used cheddar instead of munster.  It turned out awesome!

I followed this receipe exactly both times that I made it. It is so easy and tastes great. I served it with fresh fruit on the side and it was both filling and tasty. Knowing that the quiche was nutritional made me feel like a responsible cook as well.

This is REALLY good!  Watching our carbs closely, and my SIL is gluten free, so this was a great find.  I've made it several times.  It is very good as written, and this reheats nicely in the microwave (reheat a slice 1 - 2 min only).  Over time, I've played with this depending on what I've had on hand, and the recipe adapts readily to changes in cheeses or herbs.  I've used part cottage cheese before, and I sometimes add 6 oz. of plain yogurt to the mix.  We usually have cheddar and jack in the house so our standard is to mix these two for the cheese component.  Gruyere and cheddar is really good too.  I've added a pinch of cayenne or a couple of Tablespoons of salsa before.  Fresh parsley or thyme.  It all works.    I STRONGLY recommend cooks add 1/2 - 3/4 tsp ground mustard powder to the eggs.  For new cooks, ground mustard adds a special something that really perks up the flavor to  dishes with eggs and cheese.  You'll see the mustard powder in a lot of recipes for macaroni and cheese or frittatas etc..  No, your dish won't have any mustard taste.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a great base recipe. And my 1st time making quishe. It came out so yummy! Luckily, I read the reviews 1st, so I was able to adjust the ingredients and amounts a bit. I used half of the spinach, which helped not make it so heavy and added about a 1/4 cup milk, which helped a lot with keeping the fluffiness. I look forward to trying new ingredients and making different kinds of quishe to find my favorite.

Recipe was simple and good. The only changes I made were to use cheddar cheese and I didn't use all the spinach.  Even using less spinach, it was still too "spinachy" to us.  Next time I will probably only use 1/2 the spinach.

Came out great!  I used a mix of cheeses, more salt and pepper, a few shakes of  hot pepper flakes and a little nutmeg.   Easy to tweak to suit individual tastes, quick to put together.  I also sliced some Roma tomatoes and put over half of it, but I can't say they added anything very special to it.

This is a great, easy recipe for quiche. I sauteed all the veggies first: sliced green onions, thinly sliced ham, mushrooms, and fresh spinach. Then, I whipped up 7 eggs and 1/4 cup of milk  and 2 cups of shredded cheese and parmesan until foamy. I didn't have a round pie pan, so I poured the mixture into a 8X8 brownie pan, adding in the veggies and then another layer of egg over the mixture. It took 50 minutes to cook, browned around the edges and top—it was delicious! I served it with a tossed salad with ranch dressing. Next time, I will try adding crumbled pork sausage to the egg mixture.

Great base recipe! I needed a basic crustless quiche recipe to adapt into a sour cream-dill-smoked-salmon quiche, and this worked great. Of course, the quiche was naturally thin without crust and without spinach, but it was a utterly delicious. I look forward to trying the recipe, as-written, and I also look forward to trying a few other variations, which I would now be fearless to try. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was fast, easy, and delicious! I made it while holding a baby, so bonus for that! My spinach was a 12oz bag, so I added another egg. I used mozzarella and cheddar, since that's what I had, probably only 2 cups. My husband and I really enjoyed it, and our 2 little boys ate it right up! WE topped it with homemade chili sauce or salsa.

Great recipe especially for low-carb diets.  I followed others' suggestions and added a little chopped fresh garlic, chopped Canadian bacon (or ham) and reduced the cheese to 2 cups.  I also added 2 tbsp plain Greek yogurt to the egg mixture for flavour and texture.  

Makes 12 individual quiches in a regular size muffin pan and bakes in 20 minutes.

Tasty and filling for breakfast.  I will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! My husband recently had bariatric surgery, and it's nice to give him a low-carb version of a dish. I'm a vegetarian, so it's one of the few dishes we can agree on.

This was a quick and easy recipe for brunch party. 5 eggs seemed like it would be too thin, so I used 9 eggs and also added baked applewood smoked bacon and cooked a bit longer. Everyone loved this dish!

Really good and easy. I used cupcake tins for dish per someone elses idea on site. Great, but know you don't want to fill too high as they expand upward.  Also salt is plenty...I added a little more and it was a little too salty for me.

I think frozen spinach is too tough and next time I make it I am will try it with fresh.  It could also use a little more of the egg mixture and a cheese with stronger flavors.

The first time I made this Quiche, my family loved it,  it was gone in no time, I have already made it again and doubled the recipe to make two. I think it's perfectly delicious written as is but it is certainly a recipe that you can play around with. I will make this recipe over and over, in fact, I've already bought the ingredients to make another one for next weeks dinner. Awesome!!

This was excellent.  I made my own changes to it - used Better n' Eggs to cut cholesterol.  I also added some ingredients I had on hand - onions, goat cheese, and zucchini.  Leftovers heated up easily as well.

I'm not a huge fan of Quiche due to the texture of it being so soft.  I chose this dish because it looked simple enough to prepare and I had the ingredients, except for the cheese, already on hand.  I have attempted quiche before but have never been this successful.
It turned out to be easy enough.  I used my castiron skillet instead of a baking dish, and used more Spinach than was called for.  The texture turned out much firmer than I expected, which is one of the things I like best about it.   The flavor is still mild.  This seems to be a nice basic dish that could be modified easily, as many of the other reviewers have done.

This was a delicious success all around! I will admit to finding the process of drying out the frozen spinach quite tedious, but I do believe it to be the most effective way doing so. I misread the recipe and bought shredded mozzarella cheese instead of muenster and I used 4 jumbo eggs because that's what I had on hand and did not want to make the result too eggy. I skipped the salt and pepper entirely and also used an 8x8 baking pan instead of a pie tin. The resulting quiche was very solid but tasted wonderful - seconds all around! This recipe is definitely a keeper - Thanks for sharing!

Good just as the recipe is written, but changes and additions are easy to make. I prefer fresh baby spinach to frozen. Just add to the cooked onions long enough to wilt the spinach. It is easy to add additional vegetables such as grated carrots. Use whatever kind of cheese you like. I  may add cooked bacon and a friend added sausage. Sometimes I top with thinly sliced tomato and sprinkle with additional cheese.

I’ve been making this for years but with a twist. I add 1 small container of fat free ricotta to the mix. I also add one teaspoon Siracha to the eggs when beating them. Then lightly grease a pan, peel and slice a sweet potato into thin potato chip size slices and lay them in the baking pan, pie pan or quiche pan, I place the slices all-round the edges and cover the bottom. You can substitute any kind of potato for this part. If I use a russet, I wash well and leave the peeling on, It makes for a nice and tasty presentation and it also serves to soak up some of the liquid that you normally get with quiche, especially if you put moist cheeses in it.
Personally, I never cared for a pastry crust with quiche, but I understand the real purpose of it is to absorb all that moisture from the cheese’s.

Excellent quiche.  Love the "crustless" aspect to save on carbs.  Had tons of flavor and wasn't flat at all.  I substituted about 2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1 cup mild cheddar only because I had it on hand.  Will make again for sure.

Read other reviews and made slight alterations:

Used 10 oz package of spinach, 
sautéed in carmelized garlic and olive oil
6 eggs
1/3 cup half and half
1 cup onion
1 bunch of green onions
1 cup swiss, 1 cup cheddar, 1/4 cup parmesan reggiano
salt and pepper
Garnished with a half dozen grape tomatoes out of the garden.

I will be eating this quiche base for the rest of my life.

In the end this turned into my own recipe, but the base is still this one :) I added three medium sized carrots, no peppers (since I didn't have any at the moment) and liberal amount of sheep milk cheese and sheep milk white cheese. In the end I baked everything in a very thin pie crust shell. It was really delicious. My family really loves spinach and all leafy greens. So, the recipe is definitely a keeper.

I needed a recipe to use up spinach that was about to go bad. I used that instead of frozen spinach and it turned out just fine. Super quick prep work then just threw it in the oven. It turned out so great. I will definitely make this again!

The only change I made to this was to use mozzarella cheese (because it was on hand), and it still came out delicious, enough that my vegetable-hating husband helped himself to another serving. Super easy to prepare, which is a plus on weeknights after a long day at work. The amount of spinach is just right. If you prepare everything as directed and bake per instructions, this does NOT come out "thin and stiff" as another reviewer commented. Would definitely make this again, as is.

Very tasty and even good reheated. Our store didn't have Munster in stock, so we did 2 cups of mozzarella and 1 cup of Parmesan. The Parmesan browned on top which gave the quiche a little crunch. We will definitely be making this one again!

Loved it.  I used green onions and threw in some chopped mushrooms. Sauteed them with a little minced garlic, in butter, not oil.  Very tasty and low carb which is why I chose it. Thanks!

Wow! Made exact to recipe - Delish!  Love that you can play with the cheeses and seasonings to make your own if you want. Very satisfying for low carb-no carb diets and I agree, sausage would be a perfect side, or maybe just throw it in there! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I like to add garlic and green onions to this recipe, and I sub smoked Gouda or gruyere for the Munster cheese.  I pour into a muffin tin and bake a few minutes less.  Then, I can freeze leftovers for quick breakfast another day.

I made it last night and my husband and kids loved it. I added some cream to the mixture and mushrooms. Next time I think I will try adding the cream cheese that I meant to add but forgot it. Good recipe, I'm keeping this one. :)

Very delish, but mine wouldn't set up until it had been in the oven for 50 minutes even though I cooked out all the moisture from my spinach.  Perhaps it's my high altitude...next time I'll plan on cooking it longer and cover it with foil so it won't turn brown.

Wonderful and so forgiving! I didn't have enough spinach, only had 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, tossed in some chopped bell peppers and it still came out great! Next time I'll try cheddar and add diced ham.

This was great because my tenn decided to become a vegetarian, but I'm not. No cream, so it's a little healthier than real quiche. And it was soooo much faster than real quiche. Great brunch or breakfast choice. Next time, I'm trying a muffin pan for minis!

Turned out really well.  My eggs were small so I used 6 and 10oz of Mexican shredded cheese.  Hubby thought it was great and ate 2 pieces.  Recipe has potential to be customized to anyone's taste.

I made this with Monterey Jack as that's the cheese I had on hand.  I also chopped the onion fairly small.  I almost diced it really.  I used a glass pie dish since that's what I had.  I wasn't sure if the recipe was calling for a pie tin or not.  Cooked it for the same amount of time that the recipe called for, and everything set up nicely and it turned out great.   Next time I might add a little Dill Havarti cheese to give it a little zing.

Made some alterations...used half the cheese and instead added a half cup of milk and quarter cup of flour to make it creamier and fluffier. Also added some red peppers and tomato. It was a little light on the flavor (probably because I cut out so much cheese) but it was healthier that way. Would make again

Outstanding! I added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and 2 pinches of cayenne pepper. Instead of frozen I used a bag of fresh spinach. I also added about 8 baby bella mushrooms diced and added in with the onion before the spinach was thrown in to reduce. Wonderful texture and the whole family loved it. Made it twice this week! I used the muenster and loved it.

It's very good.  I used fresh spinach and wilted it before I mixed it in.  I only used about 1 cup of shredded cheese , added 1/4 cup of freshly grated parmesan and finally, some finely sliced ham and chopped cooked mushrooms.  Great meal!

We enjoyed this quiche! Made some changes: used 6 eggs, 2c FRESH, chopped spinach, 2 c cheese (shredded Colby jack was what I had on hand), added a 1/4 c milk and 1/4# bacon. My husband especially appreciated the meat added in! I also increased the salt to 1/2 tsp and used butter with the onions. It set nicely and was quite tasty!

Awesome recipe!  Easy to make and very versatile. I made it for the first time today and used mozzarella cheese, a bit of goat cheese, and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. I also used fresh chopped baby spinach. Love this recipe!

I made it with fresh spinach instead of frozen, so maybe it was more soggy than usual. Used cheddar cheese -loved the taste anyhow. Saw one of the reviewer's suggestions to pat dry the spinach, which I think I'll try next time.

I made as is except added fresh thyme because I had it and felt it needed some type of herb.  I took it to a brunch and it work well for the people who are gluten free.  I will make again.

It was eaten by the parents of an Allrecipes staff member and got a rave review!  I stir fried fresh spinach with the onions instead of using frozen.  Also substituted Swiss and Extra Sharp Chedder for the cheese.  Chose recipe because it did not need a crust.  I plan to use it again this weekend.

Great, It was just what I was looking for, Simple, Quick, Tasty and Healthy.  I only made one adjustment... I used mozzarella cheese instead and next time I think I will again use a different type of cheese, just because I love cheese. It's Thumbs Up from me.

I doubled the recipe and used fresh spinach, following some suggestions from other reviews I added sun dried tomatoes and Canadian bacon. I threw this together the night before and since I didn't want to go to the store for Muenster cheese I used the cheddar I had on hand. It was a big hit at our church social hour and a nice healthy alternative to the typical cookies. I had lots  of requests for the recipe. I also found in the reviews to substitute frozen (yuk) spinach with 8 cups of chopped fresh spinach. Perfect!

Love making this recipe! Easy assembly.  After making several times I now add montery and jack cheese. 2 cups is more than enough. I also add fresh miced garlic to the sauté onion and spinach mixture to kick it up a notch. Yum!

Excellent!

When I mentioned what was for dinner my two guys didn't look too thrilled, but by the nights end - there was none left! I made mine with fresh spinach and added a can of mushrooms. I also used 1 cup of  grated Parmesan cheese and 2 cups of cheddar - since I didn't have Munster. 

I served it with sliced ham.  I am on a low carbohydrate diet and this is great to add to my diet plan.

Loved this!  It was fast, with easy clean-up, & a snap to modify.
I sautéed a little onion with yellow squash, sprinkled in some chopped sun-dried tomato, & a few bacon crumbles on top.  We will add this to the line-up!

This was good, but I found it a little too cheesy. I didn't think it was possible for something to be too cheesy, but the flavor of the cheese overpowers the taste of the spinach. Next time, I would use a little less cheese. Otherwise, it was yummy! I added hot sauce on top to give it a kick.

Wow!  This is so good.  I had a 16 oz. bag of spinach, so bumped the equivalent of egg beaters up to 7 eggs and added an extra cup and a half of cheese.  I also sprinkled some real bacon pieces into the mixture and 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper.  I baked it in a 13"x9" pan sprayed with non-stick cooking spray for 40 minutes.  Perfect and so good!

I made this recipe exactly according to the instructions and it was great! Next time I might try some of the changes that other reviewers made, like making it in muffin tins and using green onions instead of a regular onion.

I doubled the eggs, and halved the cheese and onion. I added diced mini sweet peppers when I sautéed the spinach and added crushed red pepper. By doubling the eggs (using 9 or 10) it perfectly filled 6 jumbo muffin cups. These are great to make ahead and eat for a low carb breakfast option all week at work.

This was super simple and a versatile recipe. I used 5 eggs from my girls (fresh eggs are amazing!). I used 2 cups of Mexican cheese & 1 cup of pizza cheese. Sauted up spinach and kale with red onion and garlic. Some salt and pepper. Amazing!  I'm going  to try vegetarian sausage and cheese next time with peppers and onions. Low carb recipe and perfect for losing weight!

Very good used 3 eggs and egg beaters, garlic,
no salt, 16 oz of fresh spinach, 1 cup scallions
next time would do 2 cups of cheese.
This time I used mostly mozzarella and monterey 
jack also use just 1 slice of bacon.

This was so easy and absolutely delicious!  We had it for breakfast and then ate leftovers for dinner with a salad.  This would be a great dish to serve for brunch or breakfast to guests.  Will be making again!

Both myself and my partner really enjoyed this quiche..... I  only used a small portion of cheddar (all i had in the house) as I was attempting to make the quiche healthier. But it still tasted great. My only real negativity would be it was slightly soggy I assume due to using frozen spinach, even though I cooked it off for quite some time. I think in the future I will use fresh spinach to reduce the amount of excess water. but other than that.... This is a great dinner for nights where you don't fancy anything too heavy.

Tried this recipe today and it was delicious! My fiancée scoffed at me when I told him I was making a crustless quiche, but as soon as he tried it he loved it! It tasted so good we didn't miss the crust at all. Definitely will be making this again.

It made a lovely quiche in my Royal Dalton quiche/flan dish. I should have taken pictures. Next time. I didn't add quite as much salt as the recipe called for since the cheese has so much salt in it already and I added an extra egg.

I sauted the onions with a few diced fresh baby Portobella mushroom caps. 

Very nice recipe. Going to try variations in the future.

We liked this quiche but I think 3 cups of cheese would have been way too much.  I used fresh spinach and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. It was plenty cheesy for us, in fact there is no way 3 cups would have fit into my pie pan.  I also made it with a crust, it was very good.

I made this a month ago as a side dish.  It was so good,  My husband ate 2 big helpings and raved about it,  I changed only the type of cheese this time,  I used 3 kinds of cheese.  (Krafts mixed cheddar cheese.)  Had this for supper tonight, then for our snack we finished it off.  Thank you.

I doubled the recipe for 2 pies for a luncheon with a salad.  I liked no crust, as some guests were gluten free.  I added bacon, broccoli and Monterey Jack cheese.  Everyone LOVED it.  I will make this again!  Great recipe!

I changed it up a little. I used only 1/2 red onion and mozzarella cheese instead of munster, added two diced roma tomatoes, 1 7oz can of hatch green chiles, 1 garlic clove, 1 tsp of turmeric and diced rotisserie chicken to the heated coconut oil. I cut another roma tomato for the top, sprinkled some mozzarella cheese and parmesan on the top. Yummy!

I make this quiche all the time, changing it up a bit based on what I have on hand. I use whatever cheese I have, from cheddar to mozzarella to fancy goudas. I generally like to add some diced mini sweet peppers in lieu of the onions, which don't agree with me.  I also like to add a teaspoon or so of my favorite Italian seasoning sometimes.  This is a very versatile and easy recipe.

I only had four eggs in my fridge, and about 2/3 of an 8oz bag of fresh spinach and I sent my husband to the store to get me a bag of shredded cheddar, but he wouldn't get me an onion, so I made do. I baked it for only 25 min as my oven tends to burn things if I follow cooking times, and it came out browned so I'm sure 5 more min would've ruined it. It came out a bit thin, but that's probably because of the lack of 5th egg, but other than that the taste was great and the texture and consistency was good too. I would definitely make this again. Just wish I had some bacon to go with it.

This is a great, low-carb recipe that can be easily tweaked for your own tastes.  I typically use cheddar cheese, because we like that the best, but you can easily use different cheeses or combinations of cheeses.  I've also made this recipe with chard, and I would think that kale or other sautéed and drained greens would work well too.  I see other reviewers add in mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, etc.  You can sprinkle in your favorite herbs, as well.  Lots of variations available.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Super easy and delicious! PLUS you can adapt it to you own taste so easily!  Add meat, don't add meat, add spinach or add any other vegetable or vegetables of your choice.  It's a quick dish to whip up at any time, not just for breakfast.

squeezing the spinach aside, this is a pretty easy recipe with tasty results, even if you don't follow the recipe faithfully. my last onion went bad, so i used dried granulated onion. i also reduced the cheese to 1 cup of whatever I had available (equal parts cheddar and parmesan cheeses) and used ~6-7 packed cups fresh spinach. One cup cheese was plenty cheesy for me, so 3 seems excessive. even with the substitutions and omissions, i thought it came out delicious. definitely will make again.

A super easy and simple recipe. I added some peppers I had laying around. This is a really easy recipe to alter and use as a base to experiment with.

Love this recipe.  Have made it numerous times.  I follow the recipe as is except I add fresh chopped garlic to the spinach when it is cooking and crumbled bacon into the mixture. Also try different cheeses, my last being pepper jack cheese. My hubby loves it too and is always asking when I am going to make it again. Perfect for low carbers.

Awesome recipe, tasted like it had a lot more ingredients in it than what was actually used. You can use any cheese you have in the fridge really, I'm not even sure what cheese I put in there but it turned out very well!

Very nice recipe, lends itself well to modifications.  I had leftover salmon and roasted potatoes, diced and added to the spinach and egg mix.  I didn't want to put so much cheese into it, and had a 2" dab of cream cheese to use up, so in it went with about 2 cup cheese.  Also the last quarter cup of a sour cream/pesto sauce.  Paprika on top.  I will use this again.

Based on the reviews I added some red bell pepper--I would highly recommend that.  I used sharp cheddar and reduced the amount to 1 1/2 cups. That was not enough cheese. I will try 2 cups next time. The main reason I wanted to write a review, though, is so someone doesn't make the same mistake I did. I made the quiches in a non-stick muffin tin. I didn't use enough cooking spray. I have been scrubbing and soaking ever since!

The 10 oz. of spinach was a bit much for me, but this was my first time making it. Next time I am going to add about 5 oz. I added sausage, muenster, Parmesan, and cheddar cheese to mine. It was delish!!!!

Loved it! We did alter the recipe a bit.  I omitted the cheese and added 1 cup of 2% cottage cheese. Really good, no need for a crust

This was delicious! I made it with an 8 oz package of spinach rather than 10 oz, a mixed shredded cheese rather than Muenster,  and a touch of milk.  Otherwise the exact recipe. It was really flavorful and heats up well.  One of those not difficult recipes that looks like youve done a lot,  great for serving to company!

I did not have an onion or Muenster Cheese. However, I used approximately 1/8 cup of garlic and 3 cups of sharp cheese. Came out EXCELLENT. Next time, I will try the original recipe to see how it comes out.

So so good!  We added some mushrooms, red peppers, and garlic.  We used feta and parmesan cheese (just 2 cups).  And we baked them in muffin tins.  We frozen and defrosted the leftovers in the microwave.  The recipe is very flexible and delicious!!!

This is good. I'd add an additional egg or whisk a little milk into the eggs. I sautéed fresh spinach but I think I might have used too much. Next time, I might try scallions for a milder taste. This is a good base recipe and you can adjust it to your tasting very easy. I can't wait to make again and adjust seasonings and fill-ins.

basically good if a little boring. Next time will add some nutmeg (because I love it with spinach). Tried a little cayenne this time but maybe not enough.

My husband loves this recipe! I have to make it once a week and it usually doesn't last more than two days. The first time I made it mistakenly omitted one egg it came out very cheesy. The second time I made it with 5 eggs and it had less cheese flavor so I will make it with four eggs from now on. delicious!

Loved this. We didn't have large eggs though, so I just added an extra, making it 6 eggs instead of 5. Husband loved it too. Definitely making it again.

So delicious!  Supermarket didn't have Muenster, so I used shredded Monterey Jack/Cheddar blend.  I also added a liberal amount of Penzey's Fox Point seasoning.  The seasoning complemented the flavor really well.  Will be making this one again!  Was a hit with my low-carb sweetie. :)

So easy and simple. I wanted a crustless option, and this is so moist does not need a crust. I did add cooked low fat sausage pieces, and I dabbed the top with bite size pieces of boursin goat cheese. This added a nice look to the top of the quiche and also was extra delicious. My husband said this receipe "changed his view of quiche". We have another man eating quiche!

This was a great base. I used 6 eggs, 1.5 cups  fresh spinach (chopped), and added 2 Tbsp milk, and a handful of chopped broccoli florets and chopped cherry tomatoes. It tasted just like a quiche I get down the road at a local French bakery. Loved it!

I made this using fresh baby spinach, no other substitutions. Very nice. In the past this would have been a private note to myself, but allrecipes seems to have done away with that option. Ugh.

A good base. I tossed in a variety of the cheeses I had on hand- feta, cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.  Diced up a small can of mushrooms, and threw in some crumbled bacon. Also sauted  a couple cloves of garlic with the onion.  I don't miss the crust at all!

I followed the recipe exactly. This dish was absolutely delicious my family wishes I made a double batch. I may add diced up ham steak to this recipe next time I make it.

This recipe is so easy,  and tastes great!  I agree with others, that you can add in almost any veggie, or any kind of cheese.  I used fresh spinach, chopped, which I added to the oil/onion mixture at the very end, just enough to soften it up.  I also added some red and yellow peppers, which I had on hand.   
The second time I made it, I added just a tablespoon or so of milk, and found that this made the recipe a little bit more moist.

Made this and it turned out great. It freezes well too. I will be using this as a base recipe and trying other ingredients like roasted poblanos, bacon, ham, etc.

I had an oversupply of eggs and needed to use them up. I love that this recipe is crustless, as I live in Korea and it is difficult finding pre-made crust. I don't think it matters what type of cheese you use; I used Mexican cheese. I also shredded a carrot into the mix. Will definitely make it again. Thank you!

Such a great recipe! I've made it a lot. It's extremely versatile, too. I just made it with some grated squash instead of the spinach and ground turkey instead of the onions. Came out great!

This was delicious! I love the delicate meshing of flavors. I used 16 oz of spinach because that is all the store had. Also, I added a pie crust since I love it. It was baked in a 9.5" pie pan for 38 minutes at the same temperature. Will definitely make again!

Very good! Great for a low carb, high protein diet. Made some modifications such as using green bell peppers and Chedder cheese instead of onions and Munster cheese. Also added some tomatoes and used fresh spinach. As well as substituting coconut oil for the olive oil. Turned out great lots of lovely flavors, very filling and super easy to make!

Easy to make and hubby loved it (I liked it). Made with 1 c shredded Emmental and 1 c (3 slices) of Mimolette. Use 3 bricks of spinach, 2 cloves garlic, 5 sundried tomatoes and 4 eggs. Would be nice with mushrooms as well. No extra spices needed.

It was so perfect, I almost ate the entire thing! I used a rectangular Pyrex dish and used mozzarella instead; a little easier to clean up and less fattening.

Easy to make and delicious...I wouldn't have made any changes except that I only had the choice of Parmesan instead of cheddar and I used half of the amount listed in the recipe.  I also threw in a handful of chopped mushrooms.   Turned out just right.

This is one of my go-tos. I've been making it for years and pretty much have it memorized. I love that I don't need to worry about making/buying a crust, which is just extra carbs anyway.

I added 7 eggs, roughly 14 ounces of mozzarella cheese instead of muenster, used 16 ounces of spinach, and sauteed the onion before adding it.  It was very good this way, but needs a more flavorful cheese like muenster to add to the taste.  I used a 12" cast iron pan in the oven, and it took roughly ~40 minutes with the adjustments.

I can't believe I never rated this - I make it all of the time! I always double it and bake in a 9x13. I always add mushrooms. I've tried different cheese combos including half cottage cheese and half shredded hard cheese... they're all delicious. My kids gobble this up and guests love it as well!

This recipe has tremendous versatility! In addition to varying the cheese and seasonings, I  carmelized the onions and found that subsituting roasted eggplant plus bell pepper for the spinach is even better. Okra works very well  in place of the spinach also.

This was a fabulous, fool proof, recipe!  I love mushrooms and garlic, so I added those to the spinach mix and sauteed it all in butter, instead of vegetable oil.  Also, I had an excess of shredded Colby Jack cheese, so I used that up with this recipe--even as leftovers, this is delicious.

I've made this recipe twice now and surprisingly my kids love it. I use trader joes Gruyere/cheddar blend cheese. Based on other reviews I used 2 cups of cheese, 5 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk. I sauté onions and mushrooms in butter and I added that to the spinach and cheese mixture. Delish!

It was delicious the only thing I changed was the cheese. I substituted mozzarella and used a tiny muffin tin instead of the pie plate. My husband likes to snack on pies.

I've made this recipe several times, it is five star as is, but over time I've made a few adjustments. I start with the oil and onion in a dutch oven. I add a teaspoon of minced garlic. I then add a 10 ounce bag of fresh spinach leaves, and just cook them down, then if I have any fresh mushrooms, I slice and add them to the pot (up to a cup or so). Finally, I add just a couple of shakes (or pinches) of red pepper flakes for a kick (then add it to the egg/cheese mixture). My whole family loves it! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I used 5 eggs, garlic power, onion powder, pepper, hot sauce, and shredded cheddar cheese for the egg mixture and chopped ham, two ounces of spinach, and a teaspoon of mustard for the spinach mixture! Beautiful picture!

Excellent, easy and quick recipe. I saw this recipe after finding out friends were coming for lunch unexpectedly and I had little time to prepare. The closest supermarket to us is a half hour away, thus, I am so glad I made this!! My friends loved it!! I did not have Munster cheese so I used cheddar instead.  I was hesitant about a crust less quiche but this turned out beautifully!  I definitely will be making this again.

It turned out so well that my hubby thought it was store bought!!!..lol. He had such a proud look on his face when I told him that I actually made it. I cut down on the some of the yolks and added an extra egg white to subtitute. I also used fresh spinach. There is no need to cook it in advance, but I think it would be a good idea to do so if you have a lot of it so that it looses volume and it will all fit. Medium cheddar cheese was on sale so that was the way to go this time. Oh, and I only used 1 cup so that the flavor doesn't overpower everything else and to cut down the calories/fat. For the pan, I used a rectangular loaf pan so that the quiche would come out thicker. This way it's good for 3-4 generous servings. You can also add a few squirts of hot sauce or chipotle sauce to spice it up! I served with bbq vine ripened tomatos (seasoned with garlic, salt & pepper) and a thick slice of traditional style ham thrown on the bbq as well to warm up and get some grill marks. Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent...so tasty! I did add some minced garlic to the onion to saute, and I added some nutmeg, which I think really enhanced the flavor. I love spinach, and try to cook gluten free when I can, so this recipe was perfect!

This recipe is being added to our family favorites. I added about 50% more spinach to make it a little healthier and it turned out great. I followed other reviews and used whatever cheese I had on hand (cheddar and colby). Thanks very much for the easy and great tasting recipe!

This was a delicious and healthy meal! I added an additional egg, garlic salt, a little nutmeg, a little cayenne pepper and a splash of milk. I only used half of an onion. Be forewarned: this is a very spinachy quiche. More like spinach with eggs instead of the other way around. I thought it was delicious that way but others may be scared away by the level of green.

I like having a quiche with no crust, which can sometimes make it so heavy. I sauteed the onion with a small can of drained and chopped mushrooms. I only used three eggs, and it worked well (less eggy and more spinach). For the cheese, I used about a cup each of sharp cheddar and cottage cheese, a little mozzarella and grated parmesan (which I also sprinkled on top). Also added a little nutmeg, cayenene, garlic and onion powders, and fresh basil. Baked closer to 40 min and let rest for 10 min. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

This is the only way we make Quiche now. No Munster this time, I had to use mozzarella cheese. It worked very well. I put in a 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg just because I am the cook and I do it my way!

Great base recipe.  I combined some tips from other reviews.  Added splash of skim milk. Used only half a bag of spinach and 2 c of cheese (1 c each of cheddar and mozzarella) and 1/4 Vidalia onion.  Added 1/3c chopped ham and dash of nutmeg, as well as 2 crushed garlic cloves.  Topped with halved grape tomatoes and sprinkled with shredded parm.  Great except that was too much garlic (my fault) even though we are crazy about garlic.  I make this frequently now and sort of double the recipe and cook in a 9x13 glass baking dish for 40-45 minutes. 10 eggs, about 4 c cheese but just 1 bag frozen spinach.  Cooking or defrosting the spinach so you can drain it really helps keep the quiche from getting too watery.  I also add 1-2 c frozen broccoli (in the double recipe) and cook with the spinach.  A cup of crumbled or cubed feta in the cheese mix really perks up the flavor.

I love this recipe and often make it.  It's great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I fry up some ham or bacon with the onion, use fresh spinach, add mushrooms and some sliced tomatoes on top.

these are pretty darn good! I changed it up a bit as I can't have gluten or milk products. I used artichoke hearts, bell pepper, onion and since I didn't have spinach I used kale, and used a little bit of coconut milk to thin the eggs a bit, it needs a bit more than salt and pepper, but overall good !

I've made this many, many times and it's always good. My youngest kiddo has been requesting spinach quiche since he was 5 or 6 which makes it even better. I love taking the base of 5-6 eggs and 3 cups or so of cheese and using whatever is on hand to construct dinner too. For example, tonight I'm going to make a quiche using a little bit of leftover chicken, sauted onion and garlic and swiss, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. An easy, tasty dinner (I hope!).

I made this tonight for dinner, I used cheddar cheese instead of muenster since that was what was in the fridge, when I sauteed the spinach I added about 2 teaspoons of real maple syrup, subtle touch but definitely made it super delicious. Surprisingly easy and tasty to make. Definitely going to make it again!

With no possibility of making a pie crust, or going to the store to buy one (Polar Vortex 2014, Michigan), stumbled across this recipe and decided to give it a whirl. 
Added a pinch of red pepper flakes, a few dashes of dry mustard, and a lil lemon pepper. Tomatoes were layered on top with a sprinkling of the Parmesan-Romano and dried dill.
Great recipe! Will definitely make again.

Loved it! I did use fresh spinach (don't like using frozen in quiches). I only had mild cheddar cheese and some Parmesan, that's what I used. Added a small tomato. Poured the mixture into a muffin pan (suggested by another user) and baked for 20 min at 375. Maaaaavelous! :) so easy and quick! My teenagers loved it! Next time I'll make double because this one batch was gone in 60 seconds!

This is a very simple, basic recipe.  You can use whatever cheese is on hand.  Green oinon or Scallion work very well in this. Alway get rave reviews.

Delicious! I used fresh asiago and aged parmesan cheeses.  I also added one tablespoon of Cajun Chef Hot Sauce.  THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT TOO HOT & SPICY.  It just really kicks up the flavor. Try it you'll love it! I made the quiche using Pam sprayed muffin tins, made about 16 babies.

I have made this a few of times now. It is very easy and tastes great! I don't cook the spinach and onions anymore. It tastes the same and there's one less pan to clean up. I've also added extras like ham, sausage or mushrooms and I've switched up the cheeses too. It's hard to mess this recipe up as long as you keep the basics the same. Thanks for this recipe!!!

This was excellent! Super easy and very tasty.  I didn't have frozen spinach so I used 4 cups fresh.  I will definitely make again.

Only change  I made is that I used half mozzarella and half sharp cheddar.  I really like this recipe, however, I would HIGHLY recommend throwing some type of garlic in with it. Next time I will saute a clove of garlic with the onions. * I have made this several times and I LOVE it!  I just made it for the first time with fresh spinach, WOW! That makes a HUGE difference.

I’d like to thank the person who shared this recipe. I’ve been making this recipe for several years. It’s very forgiving with cheese and vegetable choices. I’ve been known to add bacon or herbs. I like that it fits in a 8x8 or brownie pan nicely to cut into squares for breakfast on the go.

I thought this was very good and easy to make. I have never made a quiche before and I think this was a great recipe to start with. I only made one change. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and sautéed it with the onion. It probably did not yield the same amount as the frozen but my husband doesn't like things "too spinachy".

I made this tonight and was pleasantly surprised!  I'm on day 7 of the Dr. Atkins diet (5 lbs down, woohoo!) and this was just the meal I needed to keep going.  Flavorful, filling and most of all, low carb!
I lined my 8x8 pan (I don't have a pie dish yet) with butter - after all, it's low carb!  I used 2 cups up cheddar instead of Muenster cheese and only half of a large white onion.  I also crumbled 5 strips of bacon and mixed it in.  It was fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used sharp cheddar for this recipe. Other than that, I followed it exactly and it was DELICIOUS! This is definitely going into my recipe rotation.

This was so simple and tasty.  I used a variety of cheeses and then threw in some spices and it was great.  Didn't miss the crust at all.  I will use this over and over again.

Just made the quiche and it was wonderful. I added mushrooms in addition to the spinach and onion, and I used cheddar cheese instead of meunster cheese. It's filling without the crust and a wonderful dinner and breakfast food.

I loved this recipe! My friends and family raved over it! I had to wake up and write down my modifications today because my fiends were nearing the bottom of their extra quiche that I sent them home with! To avoid a family feud, I sent them the recipe so they can make some more!!!

This is so simple and customizable and pretty much idiot proof. 
And also very delicious. I didn't have fresh or frozen, so I used a CAN of spinach. I wanted to use a cottage cheese/cheddar mix, but was out of cottage cheese. So I only used cheddar. I very much liked some of the suggestions that I've read through. Sausage and mushrooms will be is my next quiche.

Excellent taste. I used a 16oz bag of frozen spinach. It seems you could definitely use less than 3 cups of cheese. I used a multitude of cheeses (whatever was in the fridge...to get rid of leftovers); there was baby Swiss, gruyere, cheddar and Colby jack. I will make adaptations and definitely try this again.

This turned out really great! It tasted really good and will make great leftovers. I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen, added red peppers and zucchini, and 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar instead of 3 cups muenster. I think it could use a little more spice - maybe poblano peppers or something would add a nice kick to it.

I had a can of spinach I needed to use, which worked very well in place of the frozen spinach.  After browning the onion, I drained the can of spinach and cooked it with the onion until the water had steamed off.  I took the advice of another reviewer here and added a pinch of nutmeg, a little garlic pepper and some chopped scallions.  I had some fresh guacamole in the refrigerator and spread it on top of my slice of quiche.  The flavors of the quiche and the guacamole went incredibly well together!

Easy, healthy, and delicious!  I add one diced tomato and a few mushrooms and use 4 ounces of fresh spinach instead of frozen.

I'm glad I found this recipe. Thanks to another reviewer I decided to use this recipe as my low carb breakfast. I cut it into 4 pieces so every morning I can just grab a piece and go. I use 2 cups of cheese and 1/4 cup of feta. I was amazed at how delicious it taste. Now, every morning I can't wait to eat breakfast!

I made this with what I had on hand, a bag of mixed veggies instead of spinach and non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Omitted the whipping cream because I didn't have any.  And made it gluten free by using corn flour instead of regular. It was wonderful! I'll make it again for sure but use low fat cheese to make it even healthier.

Loved this as written, next time might add a little bacon and a few more herbs.  I liked using the Muenster cheese, but think it would be great with any cheese.  Will make again.

It was alright. Even with taking into the account that mine was a little over done, so the texture was off, I give it a few stars just because I thought the flavors were a bit...meh. Nothing to write home about.
   My mother still liked it well enough, even if it was over done. :)

Yum yum. Had fresh baby spinach, but not enough so added 1/2 cup of cottage cheese and BAM! Ding-Ding-Ding. I'm sure it's just as good as originally posted.

Per my 1 review, I made a suggestion to add mushrooms as a variation, mixed it with spinach 70/30. It turned out to be spectacular! Highly recommend, can be served with sour cream.

Love this, I added bacon and sausage, mushroom, spinach, onion, olives, topped with thinly sliced tomato, parmasen cheese and dried parsley.  Very easy to add variations depending on what I have in the fridge,  perfect for carb free eating, thanks

I made this today and my friends loved it.  Here are the alterations I made:  I used 2 cups of mild chedder/monteray jack cheese (Sargento brand), 1 cup of sharp chedder cheese, and a handful of parmesean cheese (probably 2-6 tablespoons).  I also liberally buttered the pie pan with unsalted butter.  Everything else was the same.

Great recipe! I'm an idiot and totally forgot to put the cheese in until about 25 minutes into baking, so I pulled it out and spread some Mozzarella on top, and put it in the last 5 minutes mostly just to melt the cheese - and it actually turned out really good. Big hit with the hubby (who gets tired of the same old breakfast casseroles). I WILL be making this again!

This recipe is liked by all 5 family members.  My vegatarian son likes that there is no meat.  My carnivore son doesn't feel deprived.  My husband and daugther and I simply loved it.

This was delicious hot or cold.  I used pepper jack for most of the cheese and it gave it a nice flavor.  Makes a great picnic or lunchbox addition.

Yummy and versatile.

Thanks!

I make this often and experiment using a variety of different veggies and cheeses. I do add an extra egg or two as needed.

Great recipe! I make it often, with different variations depending on whats on hand. Sometimes I like to slice roma tomatoes and lay on the top!

Made exactly as directed.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I used to be anti-crustless quiche just as a rule (the texture was never right and I missed the crust).  This recipe has converted me and I will sing the praises of crustless quiche (or at least this one) hence forth.  Husband is not a fan of spinach, but liked this so much he even ate the leftovers (which he NEVER does).

Great! I used mozzarella instead of muenster and added broccoli and garlic and it turned out de-lish! Also is a good recipe with a crust as well.

Love this recipe!  It is very easy to make just as the recipe states, or change it up depending on what you have on hand.  I added goat cheese, very yummy!

Perfect for brunches. I put them in a muffin tin to make individual servings. Also, I can never fidn Muenster cheese at the grocery store, so cheddar works well too.

This recipe was so tasty and very! After reading some of the reviews, I altered the recipe a bit.  Instead of adding 3 cups of Muenster cheese, I added about 3/4 cup low fat cottage cheese, 3/4 cup reduced fat sharp cheddar, and 3/4 cup reduced fat monterrey jack cheese.  Instead of regular salt I added a little bit of Lowry's seasoning. I also added some cut up turkey sausage links for some substance. This was such a great recipe.  Thank you!

I used 1 1/2cup of mozzarella & 1 1/2cup of parmesan cheese.  I also added diced fresh mushrooms when cooking the onions.
Another version is adding bacon bits or sausage.

This recipe worked for my low-carb program and was enjoyed by the whole family, including my often reluctant 2 and 6 year old eaters!  Cooked chopped, fresh spinach with the onions and used only 1.5 cups cheddar, since it's what I had on hand this morning.  Worked out just fine.

Great starter recipe!! The onions give it great flavor! I also added ham and sausage, 1 more egg, and I topped the quiche with parmesian cheese, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Will def use again as is!! :)

We had to alter the recipe, due to what we had on hand:  used cheddar cheese instead of muenster (although I'll bet that tastes GREAT!), I carmelized the onions since I don't like a lot of onion flavour and also added some leftover, chopped ham.  Good stuff!  Quick to make and bakes up nicely!

This was SO yummy!  I used about 2 cups of cheese instead of 3, and used Swiss instead of Muenster.  I also added some mushrooms.  This was extremely easy to make and super delicious.  This will be a staple in my dinner rotation!

Incredible Basic Quiche.... very very versatile... you can truely make it to your liking... I added mushrooms and used 2 cups monzarella cheese and 1 cup chedder instead of the muenster... it turned out very very good too... if you wanted I am sure you could put a crust under it... or make any other changes you desire... next time I am considering putting a few tomato slices on top... very easy to make... will make again

This is a quick and easy. My family loves it and request it almost every time they visit. To add a little flavor I grate about 2 TBS of ginger root into the mixture.

This was super flavorful..and easy to make..I like it a lot..the only reason I gave it four stars was because I feel it may need more veggies in it..maybe some mushrooms, peppers, or something like that.

This was a very good and easy quiche recipe. I added about three cloves of chopped garlic and about 8 slices of crispy chopped bacon.  Instead of muenster I used colby jack.  Baked in an 8 x 8 instead of a pie plate. Will be making again!

Made this on 12/26/10 and it was AWESOME!  I made it exactly like the recipe but used 1 cup mozzarella and 2 cups sharp cheddar because that was what I had on hand.  Also, I had a couple of egg yolks left over from another recipe I had made so threw those in as well to use them up.  Baked it in a lightly greased 8 x 8 pan and served it in squares. This is a very quick and easy to make recipe.  Try it....you will love it!

Really good and really easy. Used motzarella and cheddar because that is all I had. Tasted great.  **Update** made this just as stated with Muenster cheese this time and it was so darn good! My family LOVED it!

This recipe is so easy and extremely delicious!!! It has become a family staple for us. You can also use this recipe and substitute the spinach with different vegetables. I've used mushrooms and Orieda's hash brown blend w/ peppers. That tured out great!

It was easy (made it the night before) and tasty. A little bland, even with added nutmeg. I topped mine with tomato slices, and that was delicious. I think next time I may add tomato into the quiche. Great for early morning parties.

This was great.  I've been looking for easy recipes for my 13 year old who has recently become a vegetarian.    I followed the recipe except I used the cheese I had on hand which was an Italian blend, threw in some leftover broccoli.  Even my picky husband and my son who doesn't like cheese, liked it.

Good and quick recipe. The only changes I've made the few times making this recipe was using whatever cheese I had on hand (marble usually) and for those people who like to have SOME sort of crust (which, we do) I put a plain large flour tortilla down on the bottom of my dish!! Worked really well! Not as bad for you as real pie crust!!

This is a wonderful quiche that turns out perfect every time I make it.  You could probably put anything you want in it and it would still be good!

My family enjoyed this very much.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  We don't like a lot of added stuff in our food and this was just perfect!  If you like, you can add whatever you want to this quiche and I guarantee it will always taste awesome.  Thank-you!

Super easy to make and it packs a great punch of protein and iron. I used the Kraft 3-cheese Italiano blend because it was on sale. Might have been better with another kind of cheese. Also would like to try it with freshly cooked spinach. I normally love spinach, but the store-bought frozen stuff I used didn't help the recipe. I threw in some tomatoes for colour and they were really nice. Definitely will make again but will try variations.

I actually wanted a quiche with a crust, but this sounded like the best mix of ingredients out of all the recipes, so I figured I'd just make this up and throw it into a crust. I used a different mix of cheeses (cottage cheese, fresh mozzarella, and sharp cheddar), a tbsp of dijon mustard and some shots of hot sauce. Yum.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  Tonight, I used 2 cups of mozzarella and 1/2 cup of provolone. I added chopped white and baby bella mushrooms to the onion. My husband had 3 slices.  It was superb.

Yum - great to have crustless, can probably use with other veggies too.  All the cheese makes it very rich and slightly oily

Super good and easy!  I added some chopped garlic and salted the spinach and onions in addition to the 1/4 tsp called for.  I think it would have been pretty bland without it.  I will definitely be making this again!

I have made this as is and I have "tweaked it" and it is great both ways.  this is great on it's own, but also a great starter for alternatives.  I only use two whole eggs and 5 egg whites, non-fat cheese and add some feta on top for a little salt - great either way!

i only gave it four stars because i altered the recipe a bit.  i didn't have muenster cheese on hand, but i had about a 6 ounce chunk of extra sharp cheddar.  other than that, i followed the recipe exactly and it was super delicious!   i ended up cooking it for clost to 40 minutes, and sprinked a bit of the cheddar right on top.  my mother really dislikes spinach - but she loved this!  she and my husband spooned a bit of sour cream on top and said it went well.  we'd like to try slicing a tomato on top next time.

This is delicious. THANKS THANKS TAHNKS for sharing this.  I made it today and my 9 year old daughter almost ate the entire thing.  I used regular cheddar cheese, added a little nutmeg, 2 crushed cloves of garlic, some red pepper for color and an 8oz container of sour cream.  I also added the salt and pepper to the spinach. WONDERFUL!

I have made this 2x already and both times turned out great.  First time I added some spinach and broccoli.  I sauted some frozen peppers and some fresh potato shreds.  I would recommend if you use broccoli to start out with small amounts.  I used fresh broccoli from my garden and to me that is all you could taste even though I had many other flavors in there.  I cut back on the cheese just to make it a bit more healthy and used more egg whites than full eggs.  You can tweak this to your hearts delight.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have muenster cheese, so I used 2 cups Mozzarella and 1 cup sharp cheddar.  Definately can't wait to make again with the Muenster!  I lightly greased mini muffin pans - this recipe was enough for about 40.  Will make again!

This is a fantastic quiche.  I usually use Gouda cheese and I add crumbled bacon, but the recipe is great as is.  I was never a fan of pie crust so this is my ultimate quiche recipe.

Very good!  Even better as left overs. I make this on sunday night, pour the mixture into a muffin tin and have little mini quiches that are easy to grab and go during the week for breakfast.  Experiment with different cheeses, I really like extra sharp cheddar in mine. I also add sauteed mushrooms. I accidentally bought frozen broccoli one time and used that instead of spinach and it was good too.

Good for a quick meal. Husband gave me the whole "real men don't eat quiche" thing, but he admitted he really like it! Used red onion and cheddar/monterey jack cheese blend. Took reviewer's advice and used 6 eggs, which seemed like the right amount.

We didn't miss the crust at all. Threw in some ham, added mozarella, ricotta & cheddar & cut down the muenster (it's hard to shred!) The cheese forms a sort of "crunch" along the edge that's almost like a crust.

I've made this several times now and it is fantastic for brunch or an easy dinner. However, I make it healthier by using 1 cup or less cheese rather than 3 cups and it still tastes phenomenal.

I have made this recipe so many times- exactly as is, it's great! I also have added to it- bacon & red pepper, it's very versatile! And very very yummy. I bake it in mini muffin tins for parties. I use whatever white cheese I have on hand, it always turns out great.

Loved this.  We have 4 kids and even the 3 year old ate it happily.  Our 8 year old asked me to make this again for her birthday meal.  I served with a side of bacon and English muffins.  Quick, Easy, delicious.

I made this for Easter Sunday breakfast.  I don't really love onions so I didn't use them or the veg oil.  I also added some cooked turkey sausage and used cottage cheese, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses instead of the Munster cheese.  We loved this recipe and I love that you can change it up to whatever you have on hand.  I will definitely try this again!!!

Great recipe!  Great with any kind of cheese and/or spices.  I added a clove of crushed garlic when I sauteed the onion.  I actually used leeks instead of onion since I needed to use them up.  You don't miss the crust and you omit and lot of fat and calories without it.  Thanks for sharing!

I added 4 eggs b/c my pie pan was a big larger than average. This required an extra 15 min of cook time;  UPDATE:  This time baked in mini-muffin pan - took about 20 minutes.

Delicious & will make again! Only change I made was to use 2 cups of a reduced fat cheddar (since that was the cheese I already had) Made an easy weekend supper with some turkey bacon & organic multi-grain rolls.   Also liked the taste of the spinach cooked with the onion & oil that I may make that as an easy side on its own.

Fantastic! Instead of making one large quiche, I made cupcake sized quiche. I also used cheddar cheese in place of Muenster I also added red peppers and once in the pan, I placed a slice of roma tomato on top of each little quichlet.  They looked beautiful and tasted heavenly.    My boyfriend loved them.

I have made this for 2 brunch parties, and both times it was a hit. If you like spinach and eggs - this will not disappoint.  I found that Muenster cheese is a bit pricy, and you have to shred it yourself (something I am not a fan of).  Shredding 2 cups took awhile, but it was worth it in the end!  Also, I only used 1/2 cup finely chopped onion... which was less than 1/2 yellow onion.  I suppose the amount you use is a personal preference, or maybe I just had a huge onion!

Very very good...  This is a wonderful recipe for low-carbers.  I really enjoyed it - and I don't even like spinach.  I plan to make another one tonight substituting ham instead of spinach to see how that turns out.

This was fantastic! Everyone LOVED it. I used fresh spinach and a sweet vidalia onion as well as a mixture of cheddar and swiss. It was just great! I brought this to a potluck and this was definitely gone first!

We make this at least twice a month. We use the basic recipe but with less cheese (cheddar) and sauteed fresh veggies. My favorite is broccoli and tomato. We usually add turkey bacon. Great for a quick, cheap, weeknight dinner or brunch.

Turned out lovely, but I used 9 oz frozen spinach, and it was still too strong. Overall, though, very nice looking and flavorful. My family loved it.

Wonderful recipe!  I used a pound of fresh spinach and cooked it down.  The cheese I had was pre-grated cheddar and it was sooo easy and tasted great.  It's such a crowd pleaser!

Great, simple recipe. I use less onion or omit it entirely, and use whatever cheese I have on hand. Great for breakfast or a quick protein-rich snack throughout the day.

My roommates and I absolutely devoured this. The only difference was that I used fresh baby spinach. I didn't miss the crust at all and it is a great base recipe that you can add other ingredients to!

Delicious! Thank you for sharing! I have made this a couple times now and learning to tweak it to my idea of perfection. I like to use fresh spinich, a variety of cheeses, as plain munster can be boring and also it needs garlic IMHO. It is SO good and the leftovers are even better!!

I was looking for a crustless quiche recipe, and I'm glad I came across this one. I actually changed the ingredients of this recipe quite a bit to suit what I had on hand, but it turned out great, and I am sure it would be great as written. I used 2 cups shredded mozzarella and 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar (instead of muenster), and 1 cup raw shredded carrots (instead of spinach), and I added 3 cloves minced garlic to the onions while they cooked. It was delicious and enjoyed by everyone in the family, even the 4year old :). Thanks!

Yum!  Just had this for dinner- you don't miss the crust at all.  I added about 1 tsp of garlic salt to the mixture and it gave it a nice kick.  Can't wait for breakfast to have it again :)

This is a great, easy quiche recipe.  3 cups of cheese was a little too much, and I also substitued with some swiss.  It was great!

I made this using store bought egg whites and turned out really good.  The recipe is very versitile and next time I plan on adding some black beans, fresh cilantro, and jalapenos instead of spinach.

I make this a little simpler by using dried minced onion and just mix them into the eggs. I have used several types of cheese- none disappoint. I always add broccoli as well- to up the fiber and veggie content. Love this as a base recipe for trying new things!

Thank you for a crustless quiche! This was easy and so tasty! I used mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. I used all the spinach but added one chopped tomato and mushroom pieces and some garlic salt. Because of those additions I increased the eggs to 6.  I baked them as mini quiches - 12 min. and served them as appetizers. I will definitely make these again!

OUTSTANDING recipe!  I just made it again, but this time I substituted broccoli for the spinach and used swiss for 1/3 of the 3 cups of cheese.  I also sprinkled a bit of parmesan on the top before I put it in the oven.  It came out SOOOOOOO good!

I used extra sharp cheddar and a little bit of feta instead of muenster.  It was a bit salty most likely because of the cheese I used.  Otherwise very yummy.  Have made this before with pepperoni and broccoli too.

It was good but for me and my family the taste of spinach was overwhelming. This is the 1st quiche we have ever had. I think it would be better with half the amount of spinach.

This was a very easy and delicous recipe. I followed the recipe as directed except I only add 2 Cups of sharp cheddar cheese. I added canned mushrooms which gave it a good flavor. I also sliced up tomatoes and put that on top. Baked it at 350 for 35 minutes. Will def make again!

Love this! Quick and easy to make and nice for breaky, brunch or lunch with company. Crustless is the word that got me to try it because I'm not great with crusts and it's a lot less carbs without it.

This is a fabulous low carb recipe. You don't feel cheated at all eating this. I didn't have Muenster cheese so I just used 2 cups shredded cheddar & 1 cup mozzarella. I keep a couple of cans of spinach in the cupboard to save on freezer space & it works almost as well as frozen. You just have to make sure it's rinsed & drained. The onions really add flavor. Either way it is YUM-MEE!!!

Can't get muenster cheese here, so I use a combination of Gouda and Swiss and occasionally add bacon and tomatoes to change it up a little. Amazing recipe!

Excellent!  My husband claimed he "hates spinach" but, he loves this dish!  The only changes I made is that I use fresh spinach and whatever kind of white cheese I have in the house (Italian blend is always nice).

I cooked it with 3egg whites and 2 w/yolk, added 1 cup munester and 1 cup feta, great taste but was flat. It needed the 5 yolks to make it more like a quiche. My version makes it a great appy w/tooth-picks.

My whole family loved this.  I had to get the Muenster cheese at the deli by weight, and guesstimated a pound.  Turned out that 3 cups shredded and lightly packed was around 10 oz.  I kept the onions tender-crisp, and put the filling into a pre-baked pie crust.  It was fabulous, and we loved biting into the crispy onions.

For some reason, I don't have a pie pan, so at the suggestion of another user, I made these in muffin tins.  It filled 12 muffin tins perfectly.  This is a terrific recipe and sets up very nicely, although I definitely think it's too spinach-y and I love spinach, so it's not that.  I had to use Monterey Jack cheese instead of Muenster (which is obviously more mild) because I couldn't find shredded muenster anywhere and shredding it myself seemed difficult since it's so soft.  In retrospect, I should have used the muenster, but I would have used 2 cups rather than three.  Next time I'm adding bacon and decreasing the spinach content just a bit.

This is of course really tasty, but it's also very high in fat. Quiche is usually high in fat (since it's mostly eggs and cheese), but I was looking for one with lots of veggies and no crust to lower the fat/calorie content. This one isn't that great as such, but does taste very good. I recommend replacing some of the cheese with sour cream or lower fat cream cheese to lighten it up a bit.

This turned out to be a very good recipe. I made a few changes to accomodate my personal tastes but the recipe is good as is. I added mushrooms to the spinach and onions. I used a combination of mozzarella, colby jack, and cottage cheese. To the eggs I added a few drops of Frank's hot sauce and 2 teaspoons of prepared mustard. I placed the mixture in 5 individual ramekins and sprinkled crumbled bacon on top. I then baked for the time and temperature the recipe called for. This was very good.

This is a keeper! The muenster cheese is great! Provolone works well also. But I always add a bit of cayenne pepper and garlic powder. The whole family loved it!

So yummy. Used about half the onion and only 2 c. of a mexican blend shredded cheese. I also sauteed fresh garlic with the onion. Made in muffin pan and had exactly 12 perfect quiche's!

Excellent recipe.  I went a bit more Italian and used Sargento Bistro cheese, mozarella and provolone mixed with sundried tomatoes and basil. I also added Italian spices.

This quiche is so easy to make and absolutely delicious. The texture is very pleasing to the palate. My family scarfed it up and begged for more.  I added 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.

Awesome.  I used to make something similar with a little Biscuit mix thrown in, which settles to the bottom, kinda, but always seemed "gooey" and grainy.  I love this new version! The only thing I did differently is I added about 1/4 diced red pepper, to add a little sweetness to the spinach.  Loved it.  Husband and Daughter ended up eating more than half before I even got to serve myself.  Thanks for this new "Keeper".

This came out ok--not the best quiche ive ever had, or hope to make! As suggested I used a cupcake pan to make individual sized quiches, but I found that they came out over cooke--my sugestion is to cut down the time a few mintures if you use this type of pan. I also realized from this recipe that i like the crust on quiches!! not awful, but not the best--just an average dish.

Delicious although I made it w/Feta and Mozzarella mostly feta cheese. Would like it to be a little less heavy maybe I will try to use 2 egg white instead of one of the eggs or something.

I gave this 5 stars because it's versatile, easy and delicious!  I like that it's crustless and it goes together with whatever you have on hand.  I browned my onion in butter instead of oil and added fresh spinach.  I used Muenster and a part of a purchased bag of shredded cheeses. Excellent!

This was great and very tasty.  I adapted some suggestions from previous reviews such as using 2/3 of the spinach, adding tomatoes and using 2 whole eggs plus 1 cup of egg whites.  Will definitely make again.

The newest recipe in my "arsenal of good eats". Will become a regular menu item AND will give me another place to utilize multiple cheese & veggie ends & leftovers.  Love it! (Didn't miss the crust and I'm a CRUST lover!)

Pretty good, though I don't really eat eggs. I sauteed half an onion in two tablespoons of butter and added about half a box of the defrosted frozen spinach (make sure you drain it). After it cooled, I added the mixture to the eggs with a touch of cream and yellow American cheese. I garnished the dish with cherry tomatoes and a little Parmesan cheese.

Yummy :) I made small quiches. Used a muffin pan :) These are good when they are right out of the oven and when they are cold. :) These could be used as a wonderful snack. I did change it a bit when I made it. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (fried it), then i also used sweet onions which gave the quiche a sweet taste i also placed a slice of tomato on top. Really good :))

This was fantastic!  I added some homemade roasted red peppers (about 6 strips) and used fresh spinach.  My husband who doesn't even like spinach said it was great!  Thanks!

I made this more for my boyfriend than for me since I'm really not into quiche. But I tried it and loved it just as much as he did!   I did make a few small changes to make it a bit healthier... I used only 1 1/2 cups of reduced fat feta cheese and I used a little more spinach (I used canned, not frozen). I also added a little scallion. It was delicious!! This is my new favorite on the go breakfast!!

excellent recipe! used soya mozzerella instead for a wheat, dairy free quiche. would probably add another egg or two since i felt like there was a lot of spinach.

Excellent!  Used 1 cup parmesean,2 cups cheddar b/c that's what I had and it was fantastic.  Next time I'll try adding tomato and nutmeg as others have suggested.

This came out really good!!  I followed the directions as stated but added one shredded carrot, one yellow bell pepper, and one chopped and seeded tomato and used cheddar instead of muenster.  It was hit with my kiddos and I will be making this again!!

Fantastic and easy. After reading reviews, I decided to use only two third of the spinach package and it was enough for my taste. I added red pepper for the color. Works well with swiss cheese too.

Great!  To make it a little healthier, I used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites, instead of 5 eggs.  I also only used 2 cups of cheese and it was plenty.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious! It was a little heavy on the cheese, though, so I might cut that down to 2 1/2 cups next time. I used a shredded cheese blend. I also made it with fresh spinach and it came out to about seven cups of fresh spinach.

Good but definetly needs work... was better when garlic and a little cayenne pepper was added. Very cheesy with lots of spinach. My mother would probably love it but ehh... me, I'll probably not make it again.

Much more dense than quiche with milk.  I added a crust at the last minute and it still baked up fine.  I also added some curry powder, white pepper and granulated garlic.  Very good!

I made this for a brunch.  These were really easy to make and turned out great.  I used parchment squares instead of muffin cups to give them a more professional look.  They were a hit!

Fantastic !Wish I would have doubled recipe instead of making a different dish - this was gone in minutes, everyone raving while the other dish was barely touched.  Used fresh baby spinach and jack/cheddar cheese - To Die For !Will be a staple recipe.

Just lovely!  I added some green onion, a small amount of chopped chives, finely chopped mushrooms, and some extra spinach since I like a quiche that has more veggies in it.  Also added a few extra eggs to account for the added veggies.  I only had sharp cheddar on hand so used that in-place.  Also had extra pie dough I wanted to use, so I used a cookie cutter to place a crust on just the base of the quiche, and they came out fantastic with just the right flavor and everyone asking for the recipe!

These were pretty tasty AND easy, I have to admit! I had some egg leftover from a blown-egg craft project and wanted to fix them up, this was perfect. I used different cheese and added some tomato. The recipe is pretty flexible like many have said. Thanks!

Great quiche! I changed a few things but I'm sure it would have been great as is too. I added a pie crust, a little nutmeg, and replaced a cup of cheese with reduced fat ricotta. For the rest of the cheese I used up some mozzerella I had in the fridge. I also left out a little of the onion because it seemed like a lot. Very versatile and delicious recipe! Thanks!

Great recipe! I substituted a combination of cheddar and mozzarella in place of the muenster cheese. I used 7 eggs b/c I had a 10 inch pie plate. As others recommended, I added a pinch each of oregano, garlic powder, and Old Bay seasoning. Easy & got rave reviews!

This was a great foundation for a wonderful quiche!  I didn't give it five stars because I made some changes.  I actually did use a crust (had one I needed to use up), added chopped tomatoes, used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and substituted swiss cheese.  I'm sure it would have been delicious as written, but these changes kicked it up a bit.

This was so easy and very tasty.  I didn't have any spinach so I used brocolli.  My kids devoured it!  Thanks.

This was really, really good.  It had so much flavor and it was a breeze to make.  I actually did use a crust, but I can see that it would be just as good without one.  I also used shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Thank you!

This was fair.  I probably will not make it again.  It tasted like a cross between a biscuit and quiche.

To much spinach.  If we were to make again we thought we would make with less spinach.  We made two quiche and we liked the one with Sour Cream better than this one.

Remarkably good. There was so much flavor. I think sauteeing the spinach gave it the wonderful flavor. I used sharp Cheddar. Reheats very well in the microwave. I will be making this recipe again & again. Thanks.

Good base recipe.  I cut it down to 2-3 servings.  I sauteed 1/4 cup chopped onion and a small can of mushrooms in olive oil, then added about 1/4 pound of fresh baby spinach until wilted. Mixed with 2 beaten eggs, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, S & P, and some dried basil and oregano and baked for 20 minutes.  It made a nice breakfast with sausage links and fresh fruit.  Next time I'll add some cooked bulk pork sausage to the mix before baking to make a one-dish breakfast!

This was AMAZING!!!  I had a bad experience with quiche as a child, so I was a little hesitant about giving this a try, but I'm soooo glad that I did bc  it was superb!!! I used a spray "butter" when cooking the spinach and I seasoned my spinach with garlic salt, and soul food seasoning, and I added fresh red peppers. I used a cheddar, and mozarella blend in addition to 5 cheese Italian blend, about 2 cups, and 6 eggs.  I just began the South Beach diet, so this dish works perfectly. Thanks so much for the great recipe, I can't wait to heat it up for breakfast in the morning:-)

Great flavor!  I had a huge block of cheese I was trying to use up so I did add more cheese than the recipe called for but I think it would have been just as good with the amount in the original recipe. I served this at a brunch and several people asked for the recipe.  It was very simple to make, which was also a plus.

FANTASTIC!  I altered the recipe for our tastes (used cooked bacon, one finely chopped jalapeno, and chopped mushrooms).  I also used a mixture of feta and gouda cheese (which is what I had on hand), and it was absolutely delicious.  I loved other reviewers idea of using a muffin pan and it worked GREAT for my husband and I (there are only two of us), which made packaging them for leftovers a breeze.  Thanks reviewers - what a great idea, and thanks to the submitter for a total keeper of a recipe!  Love it! A+++

Have had this several times now...delicious! As others have said, the cheese can be changed based on what you have available. This last time we used fresh spinach, red onion, cheddar cheese and added mushrooms.

I added an extra egg, used fresh salsa instead of sauteeing onions (to make it easier and add a little extra flavor), and only used 1 cup of cheese. I did it in muffin tins as other reviews mentioned, they turned out perfect. I now have a whole week's worth of breakfast ready! Thanks!

Pretty good - 5 eggs would be better (I only had 4) and possibly a bit less ricotta and more shredded cheese. Some sausage would be great too!

Very good recipe.  It definitely needs to be spiced up.  I added carmelized half red onion, chili powder, curry powder, and salt.  I also added chopped bell peppers.  I reduced the number of eggs to three and used two cups of sharp cheddar cheese (instead of the recommended three cups).  I took the liberty of adding some sour cream which gave it a really nice flavor.  Had to keep it in the oven slightly longer (at least 35 minutes).  Overall, good for breakfast or brunch!

My 5, 4 and 1 year olds were begging for more for Christmas lunch.  It was quick and easy to make.  I made the recipe as directed, but I added in some finely chopped garlic, tomatoes, mushrooms and ham that I wanted to use up.  As well, I added some basil and dry mustard.  Delicious.  It will become part of my regular rotation.  Thanks for an easy and quick Chrismtas lunch!

A new favorite!  We weren't quiche eaters, but we are now.  I sometimes add leftover veggies to the base recipe to change things up a bit.

this is an awesome dish - i doubled it the mix and spread it into 2 9in pie pans to serve at a brunch this morning.  Followed the recipe exactly, and everyone really liked it.  I might try to add some chopped ham next time though, with a little meat mixed in it would be a great one dish breakfast with maybe some juice and toast.

Made the recipe as written, and added 1 shallot and fresh mushrooms to the saute, plus a sprinkling of dried chives. My brunch guests loved it!

Yum!  This is absolutely delicious!  I used 2 eggs and 5 egg whites and substituted 2 cups montery jack for the meunster, because that's what I had around.  I could make this a million different ways and still be in love.

I rate this a 4 only because I substituted kale for the spinach and used Season All for the spice. It truly deserves a 5! Easy and quick dinner!

Great recipe, I did take others advice and use 6 eggs. I also used shredded Italian cheese blend b/c I wanted something more flavorful than munster. Swiss would be good too. I also put in a pie crust. . . it was tasty

So yummy! I made mine in muffin/cupcake pan for individual servings and it was awesome. I think my husband ate 5 of them! Now I have several for breakfast this week. 

I also added a small can of mushrooms to the onion/spinach mixture.

This was pretty good. We thought it had too much spinach and not enough egg. I might add an egg and go down a couple ounces on the spinach; adding a red pepper gave nice color. Adding herbs to this recipe for flavor was good too (basil, oregano).

I love this recipe for it's simplicity.  I usually use 6 eggs instead of 5.  I've also used Italian blend cheese and a variety of different ingredients.  Since I bake it in order to freeze individual servings, I sometimes use a giant size muffin pan with the liners.  Easy to bake, easy for individual servings to freeze and easy to clean up.

Excellent! I bought a red pepper but forgot to add it to the mix and it was still great. I made them into a mini quiche and use one cup of sharp cheddar, and one cup of mozzarella. Topped with tomatoes. Loved it!

Loved this recipe.  Very adaptable.  I added an extra egg because of my high altitude and a little half and half.  I made this in a muffin pan so that we could have individual toppings for me and the kids.  I will make again!

As someone who watches her carb intake this recipe is PERFECT.  It's very easily adaptable to suit one's taste.  Personally, I use six eggs and 2 cups of any kind of shredded cheese and I add some garlic while I cook the onion. It's perfect with some lean protein for a filling dinner!

Delicious, but I made some changes.  I sauteed half a green bell pepper with the onion and a teaspoon of garlic.  Then I mixed in some chopped lean ham.  I only used 2 cups of low fat shredded cheese.  I topped it off with slices of tomato.  Because of all the add ins I cooked it for about 45 minutes and it came out perfect.  Will make again.

This is so extremely easy and quick to make and that is very important at our house!! To cut the fat content I used 2 cups sharp cheddar and 1 cup of fat free cheddar. I also used 5 eggs but removed the yolk from 2 of them. Turned out very yummy !! I also added a dash of red pepper flakes and some garlic before i poured into the pie pan. Will definitely make this again and will probably take the advice of other members and use a muffin tin for indiviual servings.

I have made this numerous times, and we still love it! I find it's not necessary to saute' the spinach beforehand, especially if it's thawed and thoroughly drained. I do saute' the onion, and occasionally toss in some canned mushrooms with them. I am currently trying this in a muffin pan... we'll see how it turns out this time! Great I'm sure.

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I added mushrooms and garlic to it as well. I found I had to cook it longer than 30 minutes. (Added 10 minutes with a lid) This helped to prevent runniness.

I've tried this recipe a bunch of different ways and you can really put anything in this that you want.  Some days I'm feeling like I want spinach, other days, I leave it out completely.  You can also change how light the end product is by adding or decreasing the eggs and milk.  I still haven't found the "perfect" combo of these 2 ingredients to make them fluffier, but I'm still trying!

The best Quiche I have ever tasted, and so easy to make! Especially for beginners like myself. I used pre-shredded cheddar cheese on sale at the supermarket, and added cut up deli ham. I will definitely be making this dish again.

This was a great recipe! I was looking for something easy to make with ingredients I already had in the kitchen. That said, instead of using muenster cheese, I used some feta that I had in the fridge. The taste was excellent!

This was incredible. I made my quiche with mozzarella, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. Superb flavor and texture, perfect baking time, delicious for repeated leftovers. Thank you so much for this recipe!

VERY GOOD QUICHE!!! I added some tomatoes on top. Also, half the quiche I put in a preformed muffin pan and a anothe in a circle pan with a Ritz cracker crust. Both of them were great!!!

This was a pretty good quiche, but I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and a medium sized diced tomato.  I also used 2 cups of Italian cheese and 1 cup colby jack instead of the muenster.  Next time I will add only 2 cups of cheese instead of three - the texture seemed a little funny because of the large amount of cheese.  I'm glad I added the tomato because it gave it that 'something extra' that it needed.

Wonderful recipe! After looking over the other reviews, I decided to cut back on the amount of cheese. I used 1 cup of crumbled feta and 1 cup of mozarella. I made mini quiches using mini muffins pans. They were very easy to make and a big hit at my baby shower brunch. This recipe is a keeper!

This was really good! I tripled the recipe- 2 for work, 1 for the fam and they loved it.  I used 8 cups of Mexican shredded cheese and about 1.5 cups of finely shredded 75% fat free sharp white cheddar.  I drained the spinach using a colander and the back of a spoon to get most of the juice out.  I also cooked the spinach with the onions.  I was a little scared that I didn't dry the spinach enough and also the batter was really thick compared to other quiche batters I have made but it turned out great! My coworkers and family really enjoyed this recipe!

This is great and so easily to make.  As other reviewers have suggested, I only used two cups of reduced fat cheese, and it turned out perfect.  Red peppers add some desired color and flavor.

So easy!  I love to make this (making it tonight).  I swear it's even better the next day, served cold with a salad for lunch.  I usually add a bit of crushed red chillies to give it some bite.  And, I usually use lower fat shredded cheese.

mmmmmYUM! I made some changes to the recipe for the ingredients we had in the house.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and a yellow bell pepper to the onions.  And I used 2 bunches of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I also changed the cheese to 1 1/2 cups mozzarella and 1 1/2 cups cheddar....um... I still used the 5 eggs, pepper and salt though lol.  Seriously GREAT recipe.  I stuck it in the fridge and we had breakfast every morning.

I made this last night. Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 dish. I did saute fresh mushroom slices with the onion and added a pinch of nutmeg and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and a dash of tobasco. Yum

I substituted broccoli for the spinach and cheddar for the Muenster becahse that's what I had.  DH is diong the low carb thing and really enjoyed the quiche.  He asked me to make it again.  I hate broccoli so had a Trader Joe's Mexican Quiche instead.

I really liked this recipe.  I added an extra egg and used 2 c. Monterey Jack instead of Muenster.  It turned out fabulous.  I'm sure it would be even better with Muenster.  This one is going to be a regular on my low carb diet plan.

When I said that we were having quiche for dinner my husband was less than excited. However, he helped himself to two servings and said it was the best! I only used 2 cups of cheese (monterey jack) and next time I would use a little less spinach. I served with zucchini bread and chicken sausage. Will absolutely make again.

WOW! If I could give this more stars I would! This was wonderful! The only changes I made was that I added two roma tomatoes, one green bell pepper, and mushrooms. I also used 1 1/2 cup swiss,and 1 1/2 cup sharp cheddar instead of Muenster! My husband loved it! I will definitely be making this again!

This was a pretty excellent recipe, although I didn't follow it exactly.  I used pieces of swiss cheese and low fat feta instead of muenster (I love the flavor of feta), and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I just threw the spinach in the skillet for a few seconds after sauteing the other ingredients, just enough to wilt it a little bit.  I also added two cloves of garlic to the onion in the skillet.  The cooking time was right on target!  My husband loved it - we ate the whole thing between the two of us!

This was wonderful! :)  I used 2 c low fat cheddar cheese and 1 c colby jack/mozz mixture.  I also threw in a red pepper for a bit more color. It was DELISH.  Thanks for the recipe.  I love the fact that it's pretty low fat.

My husband absolutely loved this. I added turkey bacon and used cheddar cheese and onion powder instead of onion. I made it again using mozzarella and without bacon and it wasn't as good.  Maybe a mozarella/parmesan mix would be better.

I just made this with a few minor differences, and my roommate and I have decided it's the best quiche we've ever had.  I accidentally didn't buy enough muenster, so I used a cup of shredded 2% mild cheddar.  I think that made it so much richer.  Next time I think I'll use a cup of extra sharp cheddar and see how that tastes.  

Last summer I was on the South Beach diet for a week.  I hated it, but some of the recipes weren't too bad.  They have a crustless quiche that isn't nearly as good, but I stole their idea of using aluminum muffin cups to bake in.  They came out beautifully and perfectly portioned.  Yum.

So good.  A definite must try.  I added a can of mushroom peices, some chopped ham, and instead of muenster cheese I used cheddar and some parmesan.  Really good recipe.

I made this recipe for Mother's day brunch and it was a huge hit.  I added mushrooms as well as onions which I sauteed together.  I used a mixture of sharp cheddar and parmesean cheese.  This is a recipe I will use over and over again....  Delicious and so easy to make.

I loved this recipe.It gave a great base for a quiche.  When I made this I added canadian bacon and jalepeno, added one additional egg.  Turned out perfect!  I also used a large muffin pan (6).  Filled up each cup to the top and cooked for same amount of time,  PERFECT!!  Tonight, I used 1 med onion, 2 cups asparagus, 1 package of center cut bacon, 1 jalapeno, with swiss cheese.  YUMMY!! Will do a lot more experimenting with this recipe.

So easy and love the "no crust"!  I used fresh spinach and cut back the cheese, Monteray Jack and Motzarella to one cup each.  I added red pepper flakes(all I had), basil, dill, garlic, mushrooms and a few spitzs of Braggs Amino Acids. Baked for 20 min. in a glass square pan, prebuttered and warmed.  It was a little salty for me(don't use it) so I might get low salt cheese next time, otherwise, super!  I will make for my company next week with another recipe from here, Banana Fruit Smoothie.

This was awesome and easy.  My husband, a firm believer in "real men don't eat quiche" had his own piece after reluctantly trying some of mine and then encouraged our kids to try it because it was "really good".

I basically cut this recipe down so it only used two eggs so I could make my own personal quiche and it turned out great! It didn't take long at all and I found it to be delicious! Normally I have trouble with quiches because the eggs don't set, but this one was no problem! I added a tablespoon or so of milk to the eggs because I find it makes them a little fluffier, but other than that I didn't change a thing. Will definitely make again and again and maybe try throwing in some more veggies or something in the future.

This was great!!  I'm not an onion fan so I subsitued  green pepper and increased the spinach to 16oz I too exchanged the muenster for monnteray jack and cheddar blend I also increased the eggs to 6 and added a jar of antichokes. I topped the cooked dish with parmasean cheese after taking out of the oven.  Just delicious.

Yum! This was really good. I served it with sliced tomato w/ salt & pepper & lemon juice. You could also make mini quiches in a muffin pan, and you could also toss in some broccoli, carrots, or zucchini for more veggies. I really like the idea of not having the crust - makes it healthier!
 Great recipe! Thanks!

This recipe was great!!!  I added garlic and bell pepper and cooked them in olive oil.  I also added a few extra spices.  I used 1/2 cup of mozzarella and 3/4 cup extra sharp cheddar cheese b/c that's what I had!  I would definitely recommend this!  It turned out a light and fluffy quiche.  My 12 month old loved it!!

this is a wonderful healthy dish for Low Carb dieters.   I tweaked it by sauteing fresh mushrooms with the onions.   I also added diced ham.  It was even better with Crystal Hot Sauce which I added to mine after serving it.

I have been trying out lots of dishes like this one, and this one is simply amazing. I did nothing to it, except cut down a bit on onion since the hubby doesn't like onion. We both love spinach and muenster so this was like heaven! Thank you for the great recipe!

used 2 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar and a splash of milk.
May want to either reduce the spinach or add more eggs next time.

So, I gave this a 5 star even though I tweaked it.  Added sliced olives, chopped ham (leftover) and used fresh spinach (that's what was on hand).  With my additions it became a touch salty (how I love the salt), but the meunster made the recipe for me, nice and creamy.... keeper!

Oh my gosh!! This is the BEST base recipe for quiche. I doubled the recipe & I added a container of fresh mushrooms, 1 jar of roasted red peppers, 2 tsp's of jarred minced garlic, some red pepper flakes, nutmeg & a bag of diced deli ham. I also used pepperjack cheese and put sliced Muenster on top before baking. Made for a brunch I was having & everyone commented on how yummy it was. Several wanted the recipe.

this was an easy way to make quiche, I added bacon and the family loved it.  I used the microwave bacon,(it is already cooked) just cut it up into mixture, no need to cook before adding.

I made these in the muffin tin (like the other suggestions).  I baked them for only 16 min and they came out perfect.  I made the basic recipe as is and next time will add mushrooms or maybe bacon!  These were great!

My 16 m.o. loves this, need I say more? I find that I actually have to cut down cooking time, so maybe just my oven? Delish, and i love that it's crustless.  My very first quiche and it couldn't have come out better!  Thanks.

yummy! I added frozen artichoke hearts and topped with asparagus spears in a silly design. Very delicious and extremely easy! I made this again recently and used less spinach (fresh) and sauted it with a finely chopped, fire roasted poblano chile and lots of garlic powder. As well as about a 1/4 c. of heavy cream and an extra egg. This was excellent!

The best!   Only thing I did different was I added red bell pepper just for color.   My husband is a picky eater and he even liked it.  He got upset cause I froze the left overs instead of saving them for him to eat!

Very yummy quiche! Next time I will definitely add more garlic and a little more salt, pepper and maybe a little hot sauce to give it more flavor. Still, a very good recipe that can easily be adjusted for personal preference.

This recipe is so yummy and sooooo easy!  We love the flavor of the Meunster cheese.  I love how it's so versatile.  I added some chopped roasted red peppers to the recipe and it was delicious.  Bonus--I got my 1 year old and 3 year old to eat spinach without any complaints!  The whole family loved it.

This was awesome...after reading some of the reviews I did make a couple of substitutions..I used 1 cup each of white cheddar, provolone and reduced fat colby jack.  I used 1 1/4 cup of 3 cheese better'n eggs...for spice Mrs Dash instead of salt, a little pepper and a dash of nutmeg..I only used 1 tsp of olive oil with the onions.  I cooked it for about 23-25 minutes.  I'm on a diet and have been looking for a recipe like this...it was truly awesome...thanks for sharing!!

I used Romano and cheddar cheese, which I had sitting around, and it worked out great.  I, too, was looking for something low-carb for breakfast that was easy, and this definitely fit the bill.  Pretty high fat, but at least it has plenty of spinach in it, and I could add other vegetables.  Great, easy, recipe.

Excellent quiche...I used a mozzarella mixture...note because of the large amount of cheese it was a little more dense, if reheating in the microwave quiche will take longer for a complete heating

Easy & good, but since we added smoked sausage, mushrooms, red peppers, & garlic I could only give it a 3 for the original recipe. With all the additions it is 4/5. I think I'll add some hot sausage next time or red pepper flakes for more umph.

Very good.  I used egg beaters and whatever cheese I had on hand.  I also added a half pound of turkey sausage.  Yum.

Very good and easy.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I added an extra egg and since I didn't have a white onion, I used minced shallots (sold in jars)and sautéed that with 5oz. fresh spinach.  I also added 6 oz. fresh mushrooms, sautéed.  I used 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of Majon cheese, and 2 slices of Munster (on top).  It was absolutely scrumptious!

A good, quick and easy recipe !
I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times with some changes : I'm using 3 eggs for about 400g frozen spinach, only 1 cup of grated cheddar is fine for me or 200g of diced hard goat cheese which is my favourite.
You can also add a finely chopped leek to the onion and some creme to the eggs.
Next time I'll try to cook it into muffin cups as adviced.

I made this in mini muffin pans.  I substituted cheddar and egg beaters.  Baked for 45 minutes and it was mushy, not dense like other reviewers.  The flavor was really great but the texture was not.  Perhaps I will use whole eggs next time.

Great dish!  My changes - I used Muenster and sharp cheddar cheese (a little over 2 cups total) and added chopped sun dried tomatoes to the adult side (my 3 year old is not a fan).  My husband and I both prefer this to regular quiche where the crust adds so much heaviness (and calories!) to the dish.  I will definitely make this again!

Great basic recipe.  I was making it for friends, so I left out the mushrooms (by request), added roasted red peppers, and used fresh spinach.  Worked great!

I substituted fresh spinach (wilted then chopped) and cheddar and parmesan cheeses. Added diced red pepper in with the onions. Added some leftover bacon. Touch of garlic powder and dry mustard with the seasonings. I used half whole eggs, half egg whites, and added a few extra egg whites.

Just made this recipe, EXTREMELY tasty! I made my own little version though, I didn't have enough eggs - so I only used two. I didn't mind that it was more vegetable based than egg based, but it still tasted fine. I added bacon which I think enhanced the whole dish. For cheese, I used what I had and added mozzerella and feta. I think the feta with the spinach and the bacon meld very well together, and gave it a little kick. I also added tomatos to the dish, since its one of my favorites. Awesome dish, will be making it again.

Aboslutely delicious, and SO EASY.  I used shredded cheddar, and lightened it up by using egg beaters.  I didn't miss the real eggs.  I made this for a group of friends, and EVERYONE raved.  You do not miss the crust.  I found that it took a little longer to cook in the middle, but I just blasted it at 400 for another 15 minutes.  Excellent recipe!

Quick and delicious! I used egg beaters in place of regular eggs to reduce fat and cholesterol, and used a combination of colby and monterey jack cheeses (what I had on hand). I'm cutting carbs in the evening, this will definitely go in my rotation of low carb dinner recipes!

A great basic recipe. I used broccoli and a low fat French cheese (5%) as well as feta. It turned out pretty good. I don't think I used enough cheese though, so the egg was a little much.  But it was my fault, not the recipe's.

Wow!!! Loved it!  only change was I used whatever cheese I had on hand (munster, cheddar, colby/jack) and I don't know the amount as I just dumped it in.  I absolutely love it! haven't even offered to share any with the rest of the family yet! :)

Very yummy.  Reheats well the next day.  I was afraid the mixture would overflow my pie pan, but it fit exactly.  I used an equivalent amount of eggbeaters instead of eggs and couldn't tell the difference.

Great recipe. My husband even liked it, though he is not a big fan of quiche. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and reduced the cheese to two cups and added an extra egg. Thanks!

I used cheddar because that's what I had on hand- next time will try with Meunster. This was a snap to prepare and my teenager raved about it. Will become a regular in my house.

I think that this is the best quiche I've ever had!  I love the green color so much, too.  I did modify it some - we didn't have onions, and I put in two cloves of garlic to cook with the spinach.  I think I used a little less cheese, too, and I added a whole wheat crust.  To add to the green color, we pureed the whole mixture a little to really mix in the spinach.  We'll definitely be making our version of this again!

This is a great recipe. I have made several times with the following changes:  used fresh spinach (best when chopped in food processor); added about 1/2 lb of crumbled, cooked hot italian sausage (regular would be good too, but this is what I had on hand); added some dried basil, dry mustard, and a pinch of nutmeg.  Have made with variations on the type of cheese (Italian mix) and all are good.

Pretty good-I made this following the recipe exactly, next time I think I'd add some ham and maybe mushrooms.  Very easy to put together!

Simply delicious, easy, and versatile! I used a combination of mozzarella, cheddar, and edam cheese, since that's what I had on hand. I also used fresh spinach. I will definitely be making this again! My whole family enjoyed it.

I had never cooked anything with muenster cheese before but I definitely will from now! I doubled the spinach which made the quiche a bit flan-like but I'm sure both ways are giving good results.

This was wonderful. Very dense and not too eggy.  I did add 1 extra egg, 2 cups chopped brocolli, and 1/2 tsp of galic salt.  My husband who is on low carb loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A great easy lunch or dinner.  My kids 5 and 2 years old also ate it all up. I didn how ever use cheddar and also added feta for bit of a kick and it worked.

I made this for a mother's day brunch.  It was fabulous!  I liked that the recipe didn't have a crust.  Leftovers were very tasty too.  I used reduced fat cheddar instead of Muenster cheese.

this is such an amazing recipe.  it sounds so unlikely that it would work but it is divine....made it for brunch for a family reunion and I should of made 3 instead of one.  It was an easy, tasty and impressive dish.  Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe!  I made a few changes, added some ham cubes and milk rather than some of the cheese.  I was a little concerned that the bottom would burn without the crust but it turned out great!

I love quiche, but this just didn't do it for me.  I made it twice.  The first time just as the recipe says and I found it too cheesy and not eggy enough.  The second time I made it with less cheese, added 2 more eggs, some mushrooms, and used pepper jack instead of meunster because another reviewer suggested it.  Somehow it was still too bland.
