8.20.17  I’m the submitter of this recipe.  There were some minor changes made from the way this recipe was submitted, so I’d like to add that this is best served immediately “hot.”  Once you have the sauce consistency to your liking, it’s even best to remove the inner pot, so that the residual heat from the Instant Pot® will not continue to cook the mac and cheese.  If it’s not served hot, the texture of the cheese sauce will change, as will happen with any creamy mac and cheese side dish.  Also, 2 cups of shredded cheese is about 6 ounces, and 1 cup is about 3 ounces.***12.7.18*** This is in response to the review by Cathy S.  I submitted this recipe as an Instant Pot® recipe, but it was edited to be more generic to all electric pressure cookers.  AR’s intent on the “10-15 minutes” is just to let you know that it may take that long for the pressure to build before the 4 minute countdown begins.  As far as the “30 minute” saute in the video, if my memory is correct, I think when you first hit the Saute button, it defaults to 30 minutes, and then you make your adjustment in time.  They’re really not telling you to saute for 30 minutes, that would totally destroy the mac & cheese which takes only a few minutes at the Saute function.  Have fun with your new Instant Pot®.  I know it can be confusing to a new user, but trust me, it gets easier.

This recipe is awesome and perfect in the Instant Pot. It was easy to make and turned out amazingly creamy. I used two cups of old cheddar and one cup of mixed Mexican cheese blend. Next time I make this I would like to try three cups of an old sharp cheddar cheese. The beauty of this is that you can pretty much use any cheese that you want!

This is a great, and very flexible, dish. I've found you can add different types of protein and veggies to this base recipe, and it's delicious. Tuna and peas is a favorite for us. We prefer cavatappi noodles over elbow, as they are a little thicker and hold up nicely in the IP. The sauce is very thin when the cooker stops, but if you take the inner pot out and stir together, it comes together perfectly every time.

This was simple  and very quick, my ultimate prerequisites for all recipes!!!
I did make a couple of changes... chicken stock instead of water and cream of chicken soup instead of  milk.  Also,  no peas or ham, not a fan. 
Yummy!!!

It was pretty good, definitely better than boxed mac and cheese. It was nothing special though, just another pasta in the one pot and then making a cheese sauce when the pasta is done.  I did it a little differently though. I threw everything but the dairy products in all at once, cooked for 5, then released the pressure and added in the milk, butter and cheese.

Made this again and used Turkey Kielbasa instead of ham. I love the recipe. It is so easy and creamy.  The kielbasa just made it even more delicious, but I love kielbasa so I am partial.

My daughter loved it. I thought it was ok. I think I need to cook the noodles less. They got a little mushy/clumpy.

This was a very easy, gooey, cheesy dish to make. It was very delicious. My son loved it so much that the leftovers were gone before I got a chance to reheat it!

I used Chicken broth instead of water. I threw in some Velveeta   cheese as well. Teenagers and toddler enjoyed it! This will replace my other mac recipe for gatherings. This is super easy and quick. Recommend! YUMMMM

I found this recipe to be horribly confusing for a new Instant pot user. 
The first paragraph.... Close and lock the lid. Set timer for 4 minutes. Set to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes.

Why not just say cook on high pressure for 4 minutes?  What does the 10-15 minutes even mean?
In the video is shows 4 minutes-release pressure, then set to simmer at 30 minutes? 
So which is it?

I took a guess and cooked it on high pressure for 4 minutes.
Released the pressure. Opened the lid and threw all the remaining ingredients in and cooked it on simmer until everything was hot.
It came out good but I could have done without the mystery timing guessing.

Thanks so much for the recipe, and for all the reviews from everybody!  This was my first time using an Instant Pot, and wanted to make something that would hopefully turn out tasty, and was super happy with the results :)

I used half a box of macaroni, and 2c of vegetable stock instead of water, and then just added 1tbsp of butter, 1/3c fat free evaporated milk, and Hoosier Hill cheddar cheese powder from Amazon for the cheese, (plus salt and pepper), and it turned out great.  The macaroni was perfect - not too soft, and the sauce turned out rich and creamy. 
 With the cheddar cheese powder, this recipe reminded me of the microwave cups of Kraft mac and cheese.

I was expecting this Instant Pot method of making mac and cheese to be faster than making it on the stovetop, but maybe it's about the same, if it takes 10-15 minutes for the Instant Pot to pressurize?   But it was nice to not need to have to make a roux, so this recipe was much more forgiving.  Will likely use this over the holidays, since it will free up a burner on the stove for cooking something else.

It was delicious. It was soupy when we first opened the vent, but it thickened up by the time we were ready to eat. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy recipe.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of Monterey Jack - it’s what I had on hand.  Family loved it.  

I would suggest not using the quick release of steam, I had starchy water everywhere! ??

I made this twice at the request of my children (19 and 17)The first time I left out the ham and peas the second time I had to switch up the cheese a bit as I had run short on Monterey Jack but I added the peas and ham.  My husband didn't like the cheese as much the second batch but overall this recipe was a home run.  Two batches gone in two days.  So delicious!

We had this tonight and it was delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water. I also added a 1/2 cup of cubbed up velveeta. It added just a little extra creaminess.

I doubled the recipe for absolutely no reason. I don't recommend doing that - it caused my instantpot to spew mustard and tabasco-infused water out of the release valve when I released the pressure.  I saved the day by throwing a towel over the valve and having it catch any released moisture.

After things had settled down I was able to open the lid and make the recipe uneventfully.  It was pretty good!

I was able to find 8oz prepackaged, pre-cubed ham next to the bacon in my grocery store.  And while the recipe itself doesn't specify the strength of cheddar to use, I went with the submitter's comment to use extra sharp and it turned out great.

My only deviation from the recipe (other than the doubling) was to used frozen, non-defrosted peas because I'm lazy.  Came out fine.

Kids loved it and so did I.

I did use only 2% milk ( I had no evaporated milk) and added 1/2 teaspoon of paprika. I did quick release after 4 minute cook time which was perfect for texture. And added 8 ounce diced ham and sharp cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon of steakhouse seasoning instead of salt and pepper to taste. ( ham is salty enough for my taste)

This was quite tasty . The family enjoyed it. It was super easy and quick too. I was really impressed with how well the cheese and milk incorporated. I did reduce the liquid for the noodles to 3 1/2 cups after reading other reviews about the noodles being too mushy. I like my noddles a little more al dente. I probably could have gotten away with 3 1/3 cups pasta cooking liquid. I subbed veggie stock for water and don't feel it really brought anything to the party. I'll use water next time.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the finished product was too liquidy. Tasty anyway. Hoping the pasta will absorb some liquid and the leftovers will be better.

The taste was very good. Mine was soupy after cooking, so I removed as much water as I could, about 3/4 of a cup and did not use milk. Next time I will cut the water to three cups. I also doubled the peas and ham. I used Barrilla cellentani (spiral) noodles.

Too much water remains and it becomes soupy.  3 Cups of cheese is definitely not enough.  Wound up adding Cheese Whiz to cheese it up more.

It was bland and it was dry. I might try it again but will have to add something for flavor.

It's best when served right away. If reheating the next day, be sure to add a little milk or cream.

Very good. Next time I’ll try with 2% cheese and a leaner meat.
