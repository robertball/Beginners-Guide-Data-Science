We'd all love a blenderless hummus recipe. Alas, this is not it. The problem is that the moment the chickpea flour touches the hot liquid it seizes up. No amount of whisking unclumped them. I thought about blending it anyway, but i fear it was too late.

Good taste, strange texture. Be careful when adding the flour, it might help to pass this through a mesh strainer to eliminate any lumps. Thank you for the recipe.
