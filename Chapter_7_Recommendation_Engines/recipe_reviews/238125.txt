I made this for my family and they ate all of it and asked for more! So good. Followed the recipe to a T (except for the garnishes).  Most time consuming part is roasting the peppers. You can buy a jar of roasted peppers from the store to save on time.

This was absolutely delicious!  The peppers roasted nicely on my outdoor grill, and I prepared nearly everything else just as the recipe directed.  Only changed a couple of things.  I used canned diced tomatoes (it's not tomato season here right now), which probably doesn't really matter and made the whole process quicker.  Also, I processed the soup in my Cuisinart until it was nearly smooth and served it with a dollop of sour cream.  That was the touch that made it awesome, and we will be having it that way again.  This is definitely a keeper!
