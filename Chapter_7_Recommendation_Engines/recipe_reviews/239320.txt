I would not make this again.  It was O.K. and it had a good texture, but I have more flavorful recipes for a can of pumpkin and a spice cake mix.  It freezes well.   I used a caramel flavored frosting and also whipped cream to fancy it up some.  I made it as a cake in a Pyrex 9 x 13.

made this for the same reason I am not good with breads.  My family absolutely loved it. I made two loaves instead of the muffins and this turned out well. Thank you  paisleyorchid  for the recipe!

I made this for my pets (with slight modifications)
I only added 1/4 cup of sugar. I had almond/coconut milk on hand. I made two small loaves for the doggie's cakes, the remainder went into a muffin pan. I was out of chocolate chips, so I shaved so semi-sweet baking chocolate onto a few muffins which I shared with my biped friends. Everyone loved them! Especially my pups! I topped their cakes with a thin layer of whipped cream cheese.

Very good and easy. I used yellow cake mix and added a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice to the recipe. I made 2 loaves and only baked for 45 minutes.

Everyone loved it. Super moist and delicious. I used a full bag of mik chocolate chips, plus added a little nutmeg, all spice, and cinnamon. It had a wonderful flavor. I used bread pans instead of muffin tin.
