I modified this considerably after a first attempt that was just too bland, with flavors that didn't compliment each other.  To my second batch, I added sauteed onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I also changed the cheese to a mixture of provolone, gruyere and swiss.  I decreased the milk by 1 cup and added a can of cream of celery soup instead, along with 1/2 cup of evaporated milk.  This turned out fantastic and got rave reviews at my weekly gal's poker game.

I ran across this dish looking for a way to use up leftover dinner rolls. It was pretty good, but my hubby said it's not better than tuna casserole. Instead of the ham, I substituted prosciutto which added a richer flavor to the dish. I used a can of cream of celery soup and condensed milk in place of the milk as suggested above. I felt these changes made this a more appropriate dish for supper. I'll try it with the ham and leave out the asparagus another time for a brunch.

My family did not enjoy this at all and we love asparagus.

This one was good, the best part about it you can use this recipe as a base and improvise switching the veggies, meats or cheeses with whatever you have left over in your fridge.  A very satisfying meal.

I made this as written with the exception of the cheese - we don't care for processed cheese so I used a Cheddar / Jack Cheese blend.  You don't have to pre-cook the asparagus - that saves a  little time.  This is a great recipe to use up left overs - perfect after Easter.  I have made recipes like this in individual oven safe ramekins.  Each can be customized to suit different tastes.  It is a fun kitchen project when we do a sleep over with the kids.

This was an okay dish as written. Made it a second time using sharp cheddar cheese & as suggested previously, a can of cream of celery soup in place of 1 cup of the milk. Will make again with other veggies & meats. A great idea & easy to adapt.

The family liked this dish, but we had some difficulty with the preparation. We used a glass baking dish and after the baking time was up, we had to bake an extra 20 minutes...and even then the center was still a little wet. The extra time resulted in burned rolls on the top. Perhaps a metal pan would have worked better. Other than that, it was a flavorful dish.
