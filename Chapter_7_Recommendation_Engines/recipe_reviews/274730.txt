Very good although I used poblanos instead of cubanelle because I couldn't find them. The flavors were different but in a very good way. made this recipe a favorite

Never made anything like this before.  Only sub I used was a Yellow Bell instead of Green, and I used Bouillon instead of stock (We love the salty bouillon).  My 12 year old literally drank the liquid out of the pan like soup.  My wife and kids were happy to tell me to add this to the rotation.  I make homemade Yellow Rice with Black beans and corn in the rice cooker.  It was very good.
