A friend a mine did hers without the cream cheese but, I worried that it may be to runny, so I used your recipe and added a container of cool whip and deleted adding the fruit cocktail juice. I recommend using fresh fruit instead of canned. It gives this dish a good taste. Great recipe, bravo!!!!

I have made this several times - most recently just now! - and I think its very yummy!  I add toasted pecans or walnuts (adding some toasted nuts is a must!), apples, grapes, and remove the honeydew, cut the fruit cocktail to one can and take out a little of the liquid to make it not so soupy, and it turns out AWESOME. I've even added mini marshmellows to it for a more ambrosia style salad. My hubby who doesn't like cream cheese even likes this. Thanks Veronica for a great fruit salad staple recipe!

I love sweetened condensed milk! There are not many things you can make with it that I don't like. Add cream cheese to that and you make it even better! This is a great recipe. I did use fresh fruit instead of canned: apples, pears, peaches, nectarine, strawberries, grapes, plums, kiwi, and banana. It is a great change from an ordinary fruit salad.

I usually make a citrus vinegrette with my fruit salad, but my nephew is allergic to both citrus and vinegar!  I'm not fond of mayo and cool whip salads, either - needless to say I was pleased to find this recipe.  The flavor of this salad is great - it doesn't overpower the fruit at all!  I added 1 cup chopped nuts.  I had some of the cream cheese mixture left over, so I used it as fruit dip the day after Thanksgiving.  A real winner!

Yummy flavor but mine was a little soupy, and I had only used 1/2 the sweetened cond. milk the recipe called for. Regardless, everyone loved the flavor.

The recipe had good flavor but turned out very, very soupy. Not a very neat dish for a breakfast potluck

Tasted good, I didn't particularly like the melons, better with fresh fruits instead of canned fruit cocktail.

When I put this together it was a bit runny, so I added half a bag of shredded coconut to thicken it up a bit.  The taste is okay, but the appearance is not very appetizing.  I took this to a potluck Christmas party and not many people even tried it. Maybe some added fruit garnishes or something pretty sprinkled over the top might make it look more enticing.

The flavor was THE BEST I've ever tasted for a fruit salad.  I'm so tired of the typical Cool Whip dressing.  I used apples instead of bananas, and omitted the melon.  I also used less-fat cream cheese and fat-free sw. cond. milk.  Eveyone at our picnic loved it.  I, too, found the dressing too runny so I added al dente noodles.  This recipe is a keeper!!
