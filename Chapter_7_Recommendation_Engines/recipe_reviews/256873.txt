I make this soup frequently, however, I omit the pasta as called for and add fresh tortellini (Butoni ) just until it cooks at the end for a few minute- if you add it too soon - the tortellini will disintegrate. But it makes for a heartier soup

I halved the recipe because I only had 1 lb sausage. The soup definitely needs more seasoning, I added basil, onion powder and garlic powder, I also added 1 tbsp of brown sugar as it tasted very tinny from the tomato paste. I had half a green pepper to use up so I added that in, I think mushrooms, zucchini and baby spinach would be nice additions as well. I used vegetable broth for the beef and added about 1 extra cup of water after I added the pasta to make it soupier. I used whole wheat penne pasta because that is what I had. I added the pasta to the soup and heated through then served. The cheese mixture was very dry so I added some milk to it to make it scoopable, I aslo added oregano, basil and minced garlic to it. My son and his friends enjoyed the soup, especially the cheesy part. I made this for Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless

It was just okay. It needed more seasonings for flavor in my opinion and husband agreed. I might make it again, but will change up the seasoning for sure.

Followed recipe exactly. Loved the bow tie pasta in the bottom of the bowl with a spoonful of the ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheese mixture on top. Then ladling the soup over the pasta and cheese was perfect. Nice blend of flavors and a step up from a regular bowl of soup. This will be one of our favorites!

Love the cheese of the recipe, a smidge too hot with the red pepper and hot sausage.  Added green pepper with the onion.  Added more basil.  Really a keeper!

Being lazy I did not follow the suggestions to cook the pasta separately.  Indeed it became a big vat of pasta rather than soup the next day.  But it is yummy!  Don’t be afraid to add a little more meat.  
I will make again, and even follow the directions.
