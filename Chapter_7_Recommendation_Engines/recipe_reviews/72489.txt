Good soup.  To be honest I didn't have super high hopes for this soup.  I only made it b/c it looked really easy and I had most of a can on tomato paste leftover from another recipe I wanted to use up.  I added more pepper than written but I love a lot of pepper and I added a few shakes of franks red hot.  I would for sure make this again!!

I made this today and it's a great base for soup. I added the entire 6 oz can of tomato paste. I also added one cup of shredded roast beef I had leftover, one cup of frozen mixed veges and I used orzo instead of rice. It turned out great!  You can adjust any ingredients to what you like or have on hand!  It's a keeper!

We used elbow pasta instead of rice and added chicken broth and diced chicken. Good slow-cooker recipe! We really enjoyed it! It was really good. We are definitely making this again.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was VERY salty! I may have used the wrong kind of bouillon.

I used brown rice and ate it the day after making it; it was thick enough, so I would call it "hearty." It didn't look hearty when I was making it, though.

This was a very good and easy soup.  I made it for a soup exchange - done like a cookie exchange.  I liked it a lot.

Good brothy base...I added a few leftovers (chopped up steak, added cooked rice).  Would be nice the way it is or adding any vegetables desired (we added onions and corn).  Easy.  Had everything on hand for a last minute dinner decision.
