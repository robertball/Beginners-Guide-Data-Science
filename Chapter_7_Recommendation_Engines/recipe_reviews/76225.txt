Awesome! I was looking for a recipe to use pumpkin butter in and found that I had all of these ingredients. The apple and pumpkin taste amazing together!

Very good and very easy.  The only thing I did different was cut butter and cream cheese into the pumpkin bread mix and then sprinkled that on top.

This was a huge hit at work that I forwarded a link to this page and had to add a picture to this delicious and easy to make treat! For recipe to fit a 9x13 pan just calculate ingredients for 12 servings. YUM!

This recipe is super easy, and gets tons of compliments! It was abig hit at a fall party I recently attended. I use Trader Joe's stuff for all the ingredients as follows: 1 box of bread mix, 1 stick of margarine, 2 jars pumpkin butter, and 5 or 6 Granny Smiths. Super yummy--I make it all the time!

The cobbler was delicious, but not as wet as I'd like.  Next time, I think I'll add a little apple cider to give it a little more juice.  And I think I'll just put the butter pats on top rather than mix them with the bread mix.  My guests LOVED it and asked for the recipe.

This recipe was super easy and awesome, and I am not a big fan of pumpkin. I doubled the recipe in a 13 x 9 pan and used two jars of Trader Joe's pumpkin butter and 1 box of bread mix as another reviewer suggested. Would definitely make again!

made this recipe over the holidays for two family get togethers, it got rave reviews. I had a request to make it today for a super bowl party.  I couldn't find pumpkin butter, so I've used cream cheese as one other reviewer did and today think I'll try using apple butter.  Yummy!

I made this and everyone in my family loved it.  I couldn't find pumpkin butter anywhere, though I'm sure I can find a recipe for it somewhere.  So I just replaced it with apple butter.  I'm going to make this again later in the week after I make some pumpkin butter.  This is definitely going to be a recipe I will use each year.

So easy and so delicious!  This was a hit at Thanksgiving, and I will definitely be making it again.  The pumpkin flavor was there, but not overpowering.

This was just ok for me. It's a good basic recipe and very simple, but it lacked a richness in flavor that I was hoping for. My husband agreed that it was just "alright". I doubled the recipe and followed proportions exactly. Whole foods sells large jars of pumpkin butter so you only need one. I think with such simple ingredients the quality/brand of the stuff you buy may make a big difference in the taste. Be sure to serve warm, when it cools it tastes a lot like bland baby food.

This was not bad, just can't say it was better than a standard apple cobbler.

Love the combination of apples and pumpkin in this recipe.  I used pumpkin butter but actually subsituted gingerbread mix for pumpkin bread mix because the only pumpkin bread mix I could find was Pillsbury (Trader Joe's was out; apparently their's is a seasonal thing for Thanksgiving) and the Pillsbury label said"may contain egg ingredients."  Well, I was making this as an egg free dessert option for one of my nephew for Christmas so that box mix wasn't an option but the gingerbread was ok.  My other thought was since this is really more of a crumb than a cobbler was to make a standard crumb topping mix and just add pumpkin pie spice for the extra flavor.

Super quick and easy to throw together!  The combination of pumpkin and apples is really wonderful and healthy too.  Next time I'm going to try adding some oatmeal and a little flax seed to the pumpkin bread mix topping.

Made this for a Thanksgiving dessert.  It's SUPER yummy and go excellent reviews from my family. :o)  It's even better in the days to come!  We finally finished off the leftovers today (3 days later) and I think it may have been even better today than it was the first day!

Great combo!  Good use for Pumpkin Butter.  Had to double the recipe to use a full box of Pumpkin Bread Mix + used Apple Pie Filling which made it a bit sweeter, but absolutely delicious!

Mmm...this was yummy.  However, I'm not sure that the pumpkin itself really added much to the yumminess (it was really just the spices that came along with the pumpkin making it good).  Even though using the pumpkin bread mix as the topping was tasty, but I'm wondering if maybe a spice cake mix or something would be even better.  Something to try in the future.  

I took another reviewer's tip of adding a little apple cider.  I added about 1/2 cup of cider, and it came out the perfect amount of juiciness.  I also used more butter than the recipe called for, because the 4 tbs didn't seem like enough to make the crumbles when I was mixing it in.  I ended up used about 6-7 tbs (most of a stick of butter) and it came out perfect. I also saw other people say that they couldn't find pumpkin butter, and I just want to say that I was able to find it at Trader Joe's, along with everything else to make this.

Really enjoyed this!  Made Pumpkin Butter from a site on here.  Had another couple over for dinner and cards and served it.  They loved it so much I sent some home with them for breakfast!  Thanks for sharing!
