Very Very tastey! My husband and I like a bit more "gravy" so we doubled everything but the chicken and potato with the exception of the cayenne pepper. We used peeled, cubed sweet potatoes instead of red, because it's what we had on hand, and we prefer them to white flesh potatoes. Total simmer time went up to an hour, but it was totally worth it. The sweet and the spice flavors together were SO good.  I would highly recommend starting off by cooking all the spices in the oil first, then adding the onions, tomatoes ect. Then it's a proper gravy. Oh so good, and tastes even better the next night!

Cayenne pepper is ground red pepper.  You may be able to use crushed red pepper in it's place.  This msg is for um ahmed.  I have not tried this recipe yet but it looks quite interesting doing the stir fry today.  It sounds like a 3 or 4 rating.

I made this dish tonight and it is very tasty.   I added 2 more potatoes to it and had to add about 1/2 cup of water.  Also needs salt.

Very good! I would recommend probably doubling all of the spice ingredients listed (with the exception of the cilantro). You can also add coconut milk for a bit more sauce and a smoother texture.

Delicious and Spicy with a kick! I will be making this one again. I wished it had more gravy but it ended up a little drier than I had hoped, maybe next time I'll add a bit of water to make a little more soupy. Just my preference though. It was great!

This sounds great! I especially like the thought of using sweet potatoes. A precious friend from Ceylon introduced us to rice and curry which is now a 3 generation family favorite :) She used ginger for "heat" but I may try the cayenne.

I did what the other reviews said. I agree, not enoough sauce for us and I added a lot more curry and doubled the spices. Different taste than other currys I had. Nice alternate.

This is an awesome recipe!   I marinated the chicken with some salt, peper, garlic powder, garam masala and plain yogurt before adding them in.  Like the other users, I prefer more sauce and added water and a lot more of the spices.  Will make again!

LOVE! I doubled it, used bone-in legs and thighs, canned tomatoes, a little more oil, cup of filtered water, cinnamon stick, and simmered for 90 minutes. This recipe is amaaaazing! A must for anyone who loves a Bengali kitchen :)

My in-laws are from Bangladesh and I made this for them. I didn't use tomatoes because of a medical condition. I thought it was really good and my MIL said it was very good. She hasn't been eating much due to illness but she had a 2nd helping. I'd call that success! I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not as good as MILs chicken curry. I know she doesn't use tomatoes in hers so I know that's not why. This is a keeper until I can get her to give me her "recipe."

Making this was so much fun, smelling all the flavors as I saut√©ed each ingredient, but adding the masala sauce, OMG that made the dish and sent the aroma throughout our complex!!! A must try recipe I highly recommend it, but don't forget for those of you wanting more sauce, add water also, because that will help cook the potatoes well, and like myself, I love carrots so I added them to give more volume. SNAPS TO THE CREATOR OF THIS RECIPE!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added about a cup of water because it wasn't "saucy" enough. I cooked it on a low heat for about 1 1/2 hours. I added some sugar and some salt and it came out amazingly. I didn't have cilantro so substituted with parsley. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! My partner usually doesn't like Indian food, but I made this for him (I'm trying to convert him) and he came back for seconds AND thirds. So delicious! I'm even thinking about trying it with shrimp next time.

Very delicious.  I made this dish last night after reading the reviews from others.  I didn't have fresh tomoatoes so I used two 14 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes which gave it a lot of depth.  I doubled all the spices except for the Cayenne pepper.  The one teaspoon gave it lots of heat.  If more is needed, it's easily added at the end.  I also added salt to the tomato mixture and the cut-up chicken.  I used six red potatoes which made for a better potato/chicken ratio and added two cups of chicken broth.  The only thing I will change next time is to add the chicken ten minutes after the potatoes have already cooked so the chicken is softer.

This was super delicious and so easy and relatively quick for something with such great flavours. I didn't have ginger garlic paste so just grated some fresh ginger and garlic. I also was cooking for a cilantro-hater so subbed parsley. I found 2 chicken breasts with 4 medium potatoes to be the best ratio of meat to potatoes with all other amounts left the same. I would recommend adding 1 tsp-1.5 tsp of salt to this since none is listed in the recipe. Almost forgot, I also covered the pan after adding the potatoes so they would steam and cook through and I would recommend doing that. I liked someone's suggestion about adding a little coconut milk and may do that if I feel like making it a bit saucier next time.

I added the spices after I had saut√©ed the onions and ginger-garlic and cooked for about 1 minute.  Then I added the tomatoes.  I found that once the chicken and potatoes were added and had cooked for a few minutes it was too dry, so I added 1/2 cup of water and some salt.  I carried on with the cooking and it was absolutely perfect.  Just right.  Will definitely make it again.  This was my first meal in a renovated kitchen!  A winner!

This is great! I only used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper as I have a little one but I added a little bit more of all the other seasonings and a can of coconut milk to make more sauce. Served over rice.

The ingredients in this recipe remind me very much of what I imagine a simple Indian dish to be. I follow recipes to the T and one thing this recipe taught me is that you can't cook onions for 15 minutes on, and I quote, "medium-high" heat without turning them into blackened mush.

Once I charred the onions after five minutes I realized this recipe was written by someone who doesn't grasp the concept of time. I ended up adding all of the remaining ingredients, added water, brought everything to a boil, then covered the pan and let it simmer for 20 minutes.

I'm not Gordon Ramsay, heck, I'm not even remotely close to a fast-food chef, but I have better intuition than whoever wrote this recipe.

Tasty!  I doubled the curry powder and added a pinch of salt to bring the flavors together.  So nice to have a curry recipe that I don't have to feel guilty about.  Cheers!

I tried it and it tastes good but It's not Bengali chicken curry. We bengalis use mustard oil for chicken preparation, and curry powder? a big no no.

A very good dish, but I changed a few things.  I'm glad I stood close by as the mixture cooked because it may have ended up getting burned.  Like other reviewers, I agreed that there wasn't enough sauce.  Throughout the cooking process, I added at least 1 cup of water (maybe more) and then added more of the spices to counter the additional liquid.  I read one review that suggested cinnamon, and I ended up trying it, as well.  It was very delicious!  I had to extend the cooking time by quite a bit because the potatoes were taking longer to cook through.  Overall, I liked this recipe with a few changes, and I will make it again.

I used passatta instead of tomatoes, added some thick cream and 1 1/1 cups of water as its impossibly dry otherwise, changed curry powder to hot curry powder, Doubled the spices and didn't know what the final ingredient was so replaced it with spinach!    Works fantastic with egg instead of chicken also and kids even enjoy it.

I added fresh garlic and browned chicken first. I like more sauce so i added some soy milk with some extra curry, cumin, and paprika for extra flavor.

Quick to make and tastes great.  I added lots of potatoes, and essentially served them instead of rice.  We loved it.

I have made this dish about four times and it has always been well received. I double the spices because we like intense flavour in our home. To avoid the dryness other reviewers have complained about - you can just pur√©e the tomatoes in a blender. I usually pur√©e about 4 medium sized tomatoes and it turns out perfectly.

This was very good. I didn't know what the ginger garlic paste was or where to get it, so I just added ginger and garlic. About a teaspoon each. It needed a little salt. I didn't add the cayenne because my wife doesn't like heat. I just added it to my portion. My wife really enjoyed this and she isn't a fan of curry. She especially liked the potato in it, which I didn't care for. All in all I think this is a recipe that you can tweak to fit your own taste.

Very good recipe.  I also doubled everything except the chicken and potatoes to give this dish more sauce.  I also cooked the potatoes with the tomatoes because first time I made this the potatoes were still not quite done.

Pretty good. I used half the cayenne and still found it a bit warm for my taste. I didn't have ginger garlic paste so I minced fresh garlic and ginger to saut√© with the onions. In the end I think it did need a bit of salt. Next time I think I would like to try pur√©eing some of the veggies like submitter suggested, for something different. I was doing lots of other things while cooking, so it was lower and slower, which could be why the spice was too much for me? I like that this uses fresh tomatoes. Thanks for the nummy recipe!

Watch out for that cayenne pepper!! It was way to spicy for my husband and I to enjoy. I think next time I will add the cayenne ONLY to taste. Otherwise it had good flavor.

Very delicious! I love all the spices that are used in this curry. I am not usually a fan of curry, but my husband is so I gave this a try and I'm glad I did! I agree with the other reviews -- I added about 1 cup of chicken stock and doubled the spices because I prefer very spicy dishes. Definitely give it a try!

A very tasty dish. I doubled the spices to turn up the heat a bit. It turned out awesome.
