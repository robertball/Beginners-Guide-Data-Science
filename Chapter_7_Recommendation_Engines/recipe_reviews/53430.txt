This shrimp is the ultimate summer appetizer!  I double the amount of Old Bay and add a half stick of butter to the mix, this adds flavor and allows the Old Bay to adhere to the shrimp.  Find nice large shrimp deveined in the shell.  Serve this with the sauce fron the "Chicken the Old Bay Way" recipe from this site, and Club crackers or saltines to soak up the extra broth and sauce.  The only thing you need to add to this recipe is an ice cold beer or sangria!

Not all that flavorful and our shrimp turned out way overdone.  I'm not a great cook and am not exactly sure what "steam until tender" means.  Are you supposed to keep the shrimp on the heat or take off the heat and just leave the cover on?  I think I left the heat on  medium low for the 5 minutes and that could have been how I ruined it.  I love the idea of shrimp like this, so please post and let me know what I did wrong.  Thanks!

This was excellent and I am making it for the second time. Do splurge on big shrimp and leave them in the shell. Boil mixture and add a tsp of butter as others have suggested. I turned the burner off after adding shrimp and let them steam, covered for 4-5 minutes. I also used a seasoning  bought in New Orleans with less sodium as I think shrimp can be salty all alone. I will make this again, many times.

I rated this recipe 5 stars becasue it gave me the basic idea of how to steam shrimp, and they came out PERFECT. I used a 2-lb bag of frozen deveined (headless) shrimp, about 20-24 per pound, ran them under cold running water for 10 mins while the water and vinegar heated. I cooked them in a covered pot for about 2 1/2 mins total, and stirred them quickly twice.
 I used another seafood seasoning mix, but it didn't add much to the flavor. I used almost half a lemon. I used about 2 cups water, 1 cup vinegar. 
They were good in cocktail sauce, but FANTASTIC dipped in melted butter!

Can't beat it! Been doing shrimp like this for years. Amount of Old sprinkled over afterwards depends on how spicy you like your food.

This is pretty much the same recipe printed on the tin, so no points for originality, but  that extra teaspoon of Old Bay does make a difference.  I wouldn't dream of reducing the vinegar in this dish. It balances the richness of the shrimp... though I'd say that one pound of boiled shrimp would serve 2, not 4, if you're buying your shrimp in the shell. Also, since shrimp comes in a variety of sizes, it's impossible to give anything more than general cooking guidelines.  I buy my shrimp frozen. Unless you buy shrimp fresh off local boats, you'll be buying your shrimp at a grocer, and the shrimp will have been flash-frozen on the fishing boat itself. Buying frozen shrimp actually gives you a fresher product than buying shrimp that has been "previously frozen." It makes a difference.  When I cook this, I buy 31-40 count, frozen and cleaned but unpeeled shrimp, meaning that there are 31-40 decapitated shrimp per pound. I do not thaw or peel the shrimp before cooking, but place the still-frozen shrimp in the pan with the rest of the ingredients plus 1 teaspoon of salt (unpeeled shrimp only), cover it, and bring it to a boil. I immediately take the pan off the heat and let let the covered pan stand on the countertop for about 10 minutes, like I was making hard-boiled eggs, and then drain it. This produces tender, flavorful shrimp which we peel and eat. If you're using frozen peeled shrimp, you would need to eliminate the salt and reduce the standing time by about 2 minutes.

I cook this recipe all the time. But I put my shrimp over baked beans and rice. Sometimes I wrap some of the shrimp with bacon & melt cheese over the top of all of that!!!

Way too much vinegar! 1 Tbspn would serve. Its purpose is to kill the cooking odor.  To sweeten and have no odor, use a can of beer instead of water for cooking the shrimp. Or mix beer with water if needed to cover shrimp.  If the shrimp are mediums, 2 1/2 min. is enough cooking time.

This was great. And very easy to make. Even if you don't know how to cook you can make this dish. All you have to know is how to read. Now if you can't cook or read, then you're screwed.

This is a simple, delicious way to make steamed shrimp.  I served the shrimp cold (with Super Al's Cocktail Sauce from this site) as part of our Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone loved it!

I make this alot.  Once I put the shrimp in and stir, I cover and set the timer for four minutes.  Then I dump the shrimp in a collander.  Five minutes seems too much.  You might actually get away with three.  The shrimp is cooking as soon as you put it in, during the stirring and covering part.  Plus, it keeps cooking when you have it cooling in the collander. You do NOT want to overcook the shrimp.

I steam shrimp in beer, add some Old Bay coating the shrimp, then add 2 tablespoons of pickling spices, then steam cook for about 5-6 mins for 2 lbs of shrimp.

Been making this one for years!!  Simple, easy and absolutely delicious.  Use extra Old Bay and maybe some drawn butter for those that like to dip.

Follow basic recipe with a few modifications: Use a 1/2 cup of white balsamic vinegar and also add a 1/2 cup of beer(or more to cover shrimp) and the juice of two lemons and two limes to the recipe (double the amt. of Old Bay spice and and also add a stick of butter) add shrimp. Also have used the same recipe to cook lobster tails - serve either the cooked shrimp or lobster along with melted butter dusted with good garlic powder.

This is a quick and great meal.
I like to add salt and pepper to the Old Bay mix and make extra for serving on the side with a small dish of vinegar for dipping.
After removing shrimp from pot, I immediatly sprinkle with mix.
Just like as though I was eating crabs.
Mm Mm Good !!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe gave great flavor to the shrimp, I don't think I would eat it just the way it is though. Perfect for shrimp salads!

I used a colander and a large pot to steam my shrimp and I added more seasonings than called for. Good flavor and they cooked up perfectly.

This is SOOOO good and super easy to prepare!  I used large precooked shrimp and only let them boil for 1-2 minutes.  The Old Bay does make it a little spicy, so I don't think my kids could eat it, but I thought it was great. I will be making it again but I'll make the kids something else.  I also ended up using 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 apple cider vinegar because I ran out of the white.  It still turned out great!

Only a 3 star rating because 5 minutes is way, way, WAY too long to cook the shrimp. I'd say 2 (possibly 3) minutes will work much better. Love the vinegar, water, old bay mix though.

I replaced the vinegar with additional water and added 2-3 Tbsp of pickling spice to this recipe and it added a touch of sweetness to the spice of the Old Bay seasoning. LOVE IT!!!

This is not steamed shrimp. This is boiled shrimp. There's a difference. Use a steamer basket and your shrimp will taste much better.
