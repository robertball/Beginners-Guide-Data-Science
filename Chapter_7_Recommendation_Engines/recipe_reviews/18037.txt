I omitted the flour sugar and baking soda and used a box of white cake mix in it's place. I also adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg to give it a "spice cake" taste. I frosted with my own allspice cream cheese frosting (which is your basic cream cheese frosting using vanilla and 3/4 tsp all spice). This is a super easy recipe even if you aren't as lazy as me and use cake mix. The spices are not overpowering.

I was very skeptical that this would turn out well because it seemed so easy. It came out perfect. Great for a breakfast bread. next time I will probably omit the nuts and maybe add a glaze for a topping.

Eliminated nuts due to allergy issues. Followed recipe exactly after that. Came out great! WATCH THE TIMER! Removed from the oven at 47 minutes and toothpick was clean and cake was perfect. 55 minutes would have killed this. I was worried that there wasn't enough batter for a 13 X 9. It is a great brunch recipe and alternative to my constant Banana Bread. 4 1/2 stars. Was good! Submitted three pix because I couldn't decide which pix was best. Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!!! This is better than any other apple cake I've made. I sliced through some of the apples to make smaller pieces (You can do this while they're still in the can) and added a generous 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

Super easy and really tasty! Watch the time - I pulled it out after 50 minutes and it was already a tad overdone. Might be my oven but haven't noticed this before with other recipe times...

Just what I was looking for to use my quart of home canned apple pie filling! I cooked it 45 minutes and it was perfect using the entire quart. Husband liked it too!

I would be very careful with the timing. I saw the reviews so I cut the cooking time down to 45 minutes and I think it was still too long.
