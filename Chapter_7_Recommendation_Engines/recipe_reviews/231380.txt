I'm usually the one who makes turkey meatloaf, one of my few gifts along with omelettes, fish and not much more.  My husband really is the true cook in the family. Having worked late my husband tried making meatloaf using this recipe tonight ... not so good. I don't mean any disrespect, but there is no flavor. Should you try this recipe I'd suggest leaving out the milk, trading the butter crackers for smashed saltines, adding a half cup of grated cheese, cut the onion portion to half, and add 2-4 tbs of 57 or favorite steak sauce(s) and 2 tbs of mustard.

This recipe makes fabulous turkey meatballs.  I cut down the salt by half, used bread crumbs instead of butter crackers and sauteed the onion and garlic.  Cooked the meatballs in a frying pan.  Placed meatballs in a baking dish close to one another and covered with sauce.  Broiled until sauce bubbled for a couple of minutes.

Tried this last night and it is superb. My mom makes a ground beef meatloaf similar to this and she always said that the ground turkey would be dry. This recipe is not dry!! I didn't have the regular ritz crackers on hand but rather the vegetable ritz crackers and it turned out phenomenal. I also cut down the salt to abt 1/2 tsp, everything else was the same.

I cheated on ground beef with ground turkey once and I never went back :)  I was craving meatloaf so I thought... why not.  I picked this recipe and WOW!!!  Hubby and I loved it.  His only "complaint" was not enough topping.  So next time I'll double it :)

I made this as per the recipe (except I didn't add the salt).  Used a country-style ketchup which gave it a bit of zing.  At the 30 minute mark, there wasn't any juices to remove.  Against my better judgment, I put the sauce on and finished cooking it as directed.  As I expected a lot of the sauce ran off of the loaf, pooled in the pan & burned.  Next time I will use a loaf pan instead of a jellyroll pan (which is now soaking in the sink!).  Otherwise it was a hit.

So in love with this recipe!!!!! This will be my third time making it today and my family loves it.  My step dad hates trying new foods so when I brought this to family dinner one Sunday I didn't tell him it was a new recipe. He devoured it!!! Even had seconds. He was asking who brought it to dinner because Sunday dinner in my home we all bring a dish. Needless to say it was a hit!!!!!

I have made many turkey meatloafs over the years but this one definitely is my favorite! Many family commented how delicious it was. I used 2.5 lb turkey and doubled the other ingredients. The only substitution is I used BBQ sauce instead of worcestershire just because I didn't have any on hand. I probably  didn't measure the glaze ingredients . I just mixed it and i wanted to cover the entire top. I know it's simple ingredients but it's surprisingly very tasty and moist!

I love this recipe, and have made it several times. I didn’t have buttery crackers, so substituted 1/4C dry bread crumbs and 1/2C rolled oats. I also added a bit of hot sauce and about a teaspoon of dried herbs. It’s a nice recipe to play around with. I’ll continue to use it.

Hands down best meatloaf I've ever made.. I usually only make this with ground turkey but I like to change things up a little to make it my own. so I mixed together 1lb ground turkey and 1lb ground lean beef. I also mixed in a small portion of the topping for extra flavor and along with about 1 tablespoon onion powder and 1 tablespoon garlic salt and 1 bell pepper.

I don't know what has taken so long for me to write a review on this recipe. It's the best recipe I've found for meatloaf (turkey or otherwise). I make this at least one a month and the family eats it for dinner and takes the leftovers for lunch the next day. They look forward to meatloaf night. I've made it exactly as the recipe and I've also tried a few variations. The recipe always seems to be the best.

Made this as my second time attempting meatloaf and it was successful. I had to bake it for a total of 1.5 hours, but wanted to be safe because I don't like wet, mushy meatloaf.  That worked very well!  Next time I will use slightly less brown sugar on the topping since it was a little sweet for my liking, but overall, this is a delicious recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it with a large diced Vidalia onion and baked it in a 12 serving muffin pan. For WeightWatchers it came out to 3 points per serving if you use the light butter crackers. Thank you Isabella104

I made it exactly as written but had to use club crackers as they were all I had on hand...very moist and flavorful. The topping is pretty sweet but a little on each bite tastes good!

This recipe was a success! I didn't have any crackers and therefore replaced them with bread crumbs. Also, I added chopped mushrooms, celery and shredded a few baby carrots. We will definitely be making this recipe again!

The meatloaf itself is delicious but the topping on top makes it undeniably the best meatloaf I have ever tasted! I was feeding 2 adults and 5 kids (3 of which are not ours and are VERY picky eaters) but they gobbled this stuff up like it was candy. Have now made it 3 times in the past month :)

Best meatloaf I ever made. All my husband commented on is it needed more sauce, so I doubled it the second time. I will never use beef again for meatloaf. This will be my recipe for now on. Thank you!

It was good, but it could use something else to help give a little more flavor.

This turkey meatloaf is great! I've always used ground beef in the past and am trying to eat healthier. My husband was very impressed. It has just as much flavor as any other meatloaf. I didn't include garlic bc my husband doesn't like it. But, I used all of  the other ingredients. Will definitely make again.

I used 2 lbs. of turkey, no onions, and added some rosemary and thyme, but otherwise followed the recipe for the meatloaf--even going to the store to get crackers.  There was no need to drain the pan at 30 minutes.  I topped it with bottled BBQ sauce (instead of the sauce included with the recipe) and put it back in the oven for the remaining 30.  I still had no trouble with excess liquid in the pan.  This is a good recipe, and one I will turn to again.  I was a little concerned at first because the meat felt a little 'soft', but the finished texture and firmness were just right.

It was a little on the sweet side for me, but I liked it. My son loved it, so that's a plus.  I substituted bread crumbs for the crackers. Next time I might use half the brown sugar.

I doubled this and my only changes were: 1/2 the salt called for, 1C italian flavored bread crumbs in place of the crackers, and 1/2 C minced celery. It took atleast 65 minutes to bake. None of my family knew it was ground turkey until I told them. Really good taste and much healthier!

This was a great recipe!  I changed it a bit by sautéing mushrooms, onions, carrots, fresh garlic and celery before adding it to the turkey.  Also, I cut the milk in half.  Instead of the crackers I used Melba toast (all I had).  As for the topping I did the same but added some dried red chili (1 teaspoon) and some crushed garlic in the sauce.  When cooking after putting the topping on I used a knife around the edge to get the juices back to the bottom (about every 15 minutes and respread the topping).  I used a traditional meatloaf pan and only drained it once after the first 30 minutes.  We  used about 2.5 lb of turkey and it filled the pan to nearly the top.  I can tell you this was the best meatloaf my family has ever had...or at least by me :).  Oh...forgot, I also used ketchup and tomato paste mixed, I ran out of ketchup and we added a second egg.

This recipe turned out great! I made a couple minor changes to bump up the recipe. I used 2 pounds of ground turkey, 1 1/4 cup cracker crumbs, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup milk and added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire to the meatloaf. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Recently started replacing hamburger with ground turkey and was not having the best of luck with my meatloaf recipe with turkey meat. This recipe made the difference and the family enjoyed it much better then my other attempts. Very tasty and moist.

It's delicious. I don't keep fresh garlic so I used garlic 1 tablespoon of garlic salt instead. The first time I made it I forgot to use milk and it turned out fine. I also use wheat ritz instead of regular. I add some mustard and exrta spices to mine. Really Good!

Was very delicious - only thing I did differently was to sauté the garlic & onions.  Very nice & moist, but, didn't really have any excess moisture to drain mid-way through the baking.  We will definitely be making it again!

We LOVE this meatloaf. The only thing I changed was to omit the onions and garlic (husband hates both) and sneak in a wee sprinkle of onion powder and garlic powder (what he doesn't know won't hurt him). ;-) I double this recipe because one just isn't enough to enjoy the leftovers in sandwiches, and it's more convenient and less expensive to buy ground turkey in a 3 lb. package. I use Kroger's ... just great. Served with "smashed" potatoes, peas and carrots for a comforting meal.

Made as per instructions, and it was the best meatloaf we have ever had.  After dinner my husband said he wouldn't have hurt feelings if I made it regularly and to double batch it every time so he could take leftovers in his lunch.

Mixed reviews- I thought this recipe was bland but 2 other diners really liked it. I had to omit onions and sub in onion powder due to a picky eater which probably affected the flavor-  just not the same.  The topping was also a bit too sweet but I may have over poured the brown sugar when I doubled the recipe. I will make it again and try adding something to boost the flavor A bit as turkey is so blah. Worcestershire? Herbs? Good base recipe though.

A keeper! All I heard were moans when I announced to the family I was making meatloaf...but once they tasted this recipe, they told me to make it again!
 I baked it in a bread loaf pan, rather than the recommended cookie sheet and it was moist and flavorful. I also substituted the ketchup with tomato sauce.

We loved this recipe!  After perusing the reviews, I decided to halve the salt and sauté the onions and garlic first. Whatever we did worked because this was the best meatloaf recipe ever!  I would serve this to company without a second thought. It was absolutely amazing and this recipe ROCKS!

Excellent recipe! Probably the best I've ever made in consistency, taste, and soundness of instructions. I did saute the onion, garlic and added diced green bell pepper. I used my favorite topping instead of ketchup, balsamic vinegar and red pepper flakes

Moist. Flavorful. Will be a regular on my weekly menu. I just used seasoned breadcrumbs, an egg and 1/2 cup of milk formed into a loaf and cooked as directed for 1/2 hour topped with the sauce and backed for another 1/2 hour at 350. Perfect. Delicious. Timer just went off (making this again) time to make the topping! :)

Just made this and highly approve! Modified by using crushed saltines, 1/4c milk, tomato sauce, and dried onion soup mix and used a 13x9 Pyrex not needing drainage. Nice mix of flavors and moist factor perfect!

I really liked this! It was moist because I didn’t pour off the juices. I cooked it for 1.5 hours and added 1 cup Italian breadcrumbs instead of crackers. 
Will definitely make again!

Made this with 2 lbs. turkey and Italian bread crumbs as that's what was on hand.  Cut down onion a bit which I first gently  sautéed w/garlic; did not use milk but added 1/2 Tbls. Worcestershire to the meat for some added zing.  There were no juices to drain and loaf was firm yet moist.

Sauce:  Cut brown sugar to about 1/8 cup but should also have cut back on the worcestershire a bit too.
Hubs and daughter liked the sauce and were both surprised when told it was turkey loaf.  Son said "That explains it" :)
They said they'd eat it again.

I loved this recipe. I do not eat meat or poultry and needed a meat recipe for my parents. I followed another member's suggestion and used this recipe for  "swedish" meatballs. I sautéed the onions with butter and ~2 tablespoons cream cheese. I did not have any fresh garlic or crackers on hand so I added onion powder, rolled oats (same quantity) and additional seasonings, fried the patties, then baked in the oven with a homemade gravy. It was a hit! Thx!!

I used just one pound of meat, and then 2/3 of the other ingredients, and a whole egg.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this meatloaf as an alternative to beef meatloaf and it was absolutely the best meatloaf we’ve ever tasted! I added dill mustard to the ketchup mixture and a little more ketchup and Worcestershire than it called for and it was a hit at my house! I will definitely make this again as it was just so much more tender and juicy than regular meatloaf!

Great, moist meatloaf recipe! I did cut the salt in half as I see others did, as well. Realizing it later, I put the topping on before putting into the oven. I ended up making about half more topping recipe and added it half-way thru cooking. I would like to have some on the side with the meatloaf, so another time, I'd make more. It does come out lighter in color because of the turkey, but it is SO good! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a staple in my household! Everyone who has ever tasted this meatloaf has declared me the queen of the meatloaf. It truly is that good. I always double the recipe and often substitute plain breadcrumbs for the cracks. I also put the Worcestershire sauce right into the mix as I sometimes skip the ketchup glaze (just not necessary). If you’re doubling make sure you make appropriate time adjustments.

I added siricha to the topping to give it some spice.  I also added a Lipton onion and mushroom soup mix for more flavor. This was one of the best turkey meatloaf’s i have had. My husband enjoyed it as well and he rarely eats meatloaf. Thank you!

Wow, this was much more delicious than I thought it would be! My husband and I both enjoyed it - we ate almost the whole thing. A few substitutions I made simply because I didn’t have all the right ingredients: 1 pound of ground turkey instead of a pound and a half; onion flakes instead of an onion; barbecue sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce. I am putting this on our regular rotation!

My family absolutely enjoyed it. My husband said it was the best he has ever had and loved it. They already ask for me to make it again. I didn't have garlic cloves so I had to substitute it for garlic powder. I also used lactose-fat free milk and it still molded just fine and turned out great.

Unfortunately, I put the tomato topping on earlier.  It didn't burn, but I would have liked to see how and when it browned. I also added thinly sliced carrot and 1 clove of garlic.   I added another 7 minutes of cook time.  It was delicious.  I will use this recipe again.

Only had 1 lb turkey so used left over cooked sausage and ground it up/mixed it in. Didn’t have crackers but had triscuits so crushed and used those, and added a pig Lipton onion soup mix instead of any dry spices.

I doubled the recipe and it came out very good. I used unseasoned breadcrumbs instead of crushed crackers, I omitted the onions & pepper (family doesn't like), I added a tablespoon of steak sauce and ~1/2 cup of shredded Mexican style cheese. I also reduced the salt per others suggestions.

This was surprisingly very moist and extremely tasty. I made a few modifications using ingredients that I had readily available and it turned out perfect. I used 2 1/2 pounds of turkey, 11/2 c Italian breadcrumbs, 3/4 c Lactaid milk, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt , added liquid aminos , seasoning salt and others to taste, 4 cloves of garlic, and no Worcestershire sauce as I didn't have any on hand. I added some pasta sauce to the mixture prior to adding it to the pan. 

I would definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Changes... I had no garlic, no buttery crackers, no brown sugar sooo. I used one cup of vegetable crackers from aldi and for the sauce I used ketchup, with two tablespoons of maple syrup and one tablespoon of worcestshire. I also omitted the milk as I thought it would be too mushy. It turned out tasting savory instead of sweet and surprisingly moist.

This recipe works with beef too. couple changes. I didn't do the topping of ketchup i just blended it with loaf. added 2.5 tablespoons of Worcestershire. light on the salt and pepper. marinating meat with Worcestershire for a while will really bring flavor out.

I made this using Italian bread crumbs. I did not have buttery, or any type of crackers on hand. 

I doubled the meat mixture portion of the recipe using 3 lbs of ground turkey, and added a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce.

I did not double the topping portion.

I baked it in a 9 x 9 pan, and used a bulb baster to extract the excess juices.

Makes great meatloaf sandwiches lunches the next day, if there is any leftover after dinner.

I made this as directed with the exception of having to use 1/4 cup of  Italian bread crumbs because I didn't have enough butter crackers.  I served this with mashed potatoes and a dinner roll. My husband would rate this a 3.74 ...He had seconds!

Wow! I'm trying to eat healthier and came across this recipe. The only change I made was that I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers (I already had bread crumbs in the pantry). This recipe was perfect. I may have added a little extra seasoning. My husband was skeptical. He usually makes the meatloaf in our household, and of course he uses beef. We both agreed that this recipe is a keeper and we may not ever go back to beef meatloaf!

Excellent! I added 1 tbsp Siracha to the topping, and a few shakes of chili flakes to the meat mixture for an added kick. I served with garlic mash and green beans.

I made this recipe and put it into my smoker. It came out really nice. I lined the pans with parchment so I could flip the loaves out onto the grill at the 1 hour mark. It was on 2hrs total and got a nice smokey flavor from the hickory chips. Very simple recipe. I tripled it and made 3 loaves and it worked out just fine. I recommend adding a little extra seasoning to the meat mixture. I added Hy's no MSG seasoning salt. It was amazing!

It was good. Actually it was better then good. But not my favorite for turkey meatloaf. I have made this twice now . The second time I wanted to change it up a bit, but still use the majority of the ingredients bc it's almost like the one I normally make. But this time I added inpackage of ground pork. And I stuffed it with cheddar cheese and spinach.  I felt the first time it was a bit bland and dry. I used the ritz crackers and the worstashire sauce.  i used the Worchester sauce in the meat . As for toppings I used a chipotle brown sugar BBQ sauce. It was fantastic. I will make it again and again and again.

This was good, but watery even after I drained it. I don't know how to drain it even more than what I did. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had been less watery. Maybe next time I'll cut the milk in half.

My entire family loves this meatloaf!!  I have followed the recipe on most occasions but a few times have used gluten free crackers for those that can't have gluten.  It is still very delicious!

I had to decrease the amounts of the ingredients because I only had 1lb. of turkey and the recipe called for 1 1/2 lb.  All I can say is, it was amazing. Plenty of flavor and the texture surprised me, because of the texture before it was cooked. After it was cooked, it was firm and moist. LOVED IT!!!

I give this recipe 5 stars for being easy and tasting good. I make it according to the recipe, minus the milk. I've made it a few times and this time I added some diced red and green peppers I had on hand. Next time I make it, I'm thinking I will add some mushrooms. ??????????

I added a layer of spinach and garlic infused cheese in the middle.  Also, for the last five minutes of cooking, I fired up the broiler make sure the top sauce was nice and cooked.  Came out well.

This turned out so so because the instructions didn't include cooking the onions prior to mixing it with the meat and it just turned out raw and crunchy.  I thought about cooking the onions prior to mixing the meat but I decided to follow the recipe and it was rather disappointing .

This was really good; the only thing I did differently is I put it on a broiler pan so the fat drips off. I lined the bottom pan with foil for easy cleanup.

Loved this recipe, light and delicious.   The only thing I added was 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese.  It cooked into the meat, making it creamy!

I'd make this again.  We used 2 pounds of turkey meat and I'd use less onion than the recipe calls for.  Next time I think I may add red bell pepper for more flavor.  I didn't have any brown sugar so used lets ketchup, bbq sauce and worstershire and it was tasty.  I'd definitely make this again and this will likely be on a regular rotation.  Easier than I thought it would be to make.

Had to use plain breadcrumbs since I didn't have crackers, but this recipe was still a huge hit.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly. Very juicy, great flavor. My picky 4 yr old ate 3 helpings, and then had leftovers the next day.

I didn't have 'buttery round crackers' on hand so I had to substitute italian style panko breadcrumbs. It was so delicious, everyone loved it! The sauce was especially tasty. Thanks for recipe, will definitely make again!!

I didn't need the jelly roll pan.  Any pan just slighter bigger than the actual meatloaf would have worked because there was some juice but not enough to pour out after 30 minutes of cooking.   I decided to add extra garlic, 1 1/2 t. basil, catsup and Worchestershire sauce to the meatloaf itself because the recipe looked bland.  Even with the additions, the meatloaf itself was still bland.  I also didn't have crackers so I added fresh bread crumbs and some oatmeal.  I gave three stars because the sauce saved the dish.

I will definitely make this again. The kids loved it. The only change I made was I omitted the garlic simply because we didn't have any.

I found this to be dry and low on flavor, plus the onions didn't cook all the way. 
Ideas:
Cook it in a loaf pan to preserve fluids and cook onions and garlic
Pre cook onions and garlic
Add 2 tsps thyme

My boyfriend and I love this recipe!! I made the mistake of  only making one loaf the first time.  We literally ate the whole thing that night, and he then begged me to cook it again the following night! I personally like to add a chopped up green pepper to the loaf and some crushed red pepper flakes for a kick! For the sauce, I cut back the brown sugar and add half bbq sauce in with the ketchup and garlic powder. Be sure to double the sauce because it's just that good!! Thanks for the delicious recipe!!! :)

Thanks so much Isabella.  This was a most excellent turkey meatloaf recipe.  I followed the recipe, made no changes and it came out of the oven perfect!  This was  way moist and way good!  In the past I have followed recipes that ended up with a dry and tasteless turkey loaf.  This one is a keeper!

Such a delicious recipe. My husbands favorite! I make it a couple times a month. I do make a couple changes: I substitute bread crumbs for crushed crackers, onion powder for fresh onion, and put the Worcestershire sauce in with the meat and not the glaze. Highly recommend

This was such a hit!  Followed the recipe exactly until I misread the Worcester came at the the end. I put the same amount int the turkey mix as in the sauce mix. It was good!!

I loved this recipe! 

I followed the directions with a just a few tweeks... I used a glass loaf pan instead of a jelly roll pan, Italian style bread crumbs instead of the crackers, and only half of an onion (more than enough). 

At the 1st 30 minute mark I took the pan out to attempt to drain but there was nothing to drain. So I put the topping on (amazing by the way) and cooked it for the additional 30 mins. 

Came out perfect and everyone loved it. Even my Dad who hates that I make him eat turkey -win!

**The only suggestion I would make for next time is to use less salt (it was bit much for my taste).

This meatloaf was excellent. I added a little seasoning salt and garlic pepper to this but other than that iI followed the recipe. It was moist and very good. I will definitely make this again. I got approval from my family. My thirteen year old said she would give it a 10. Thanks for the recipe.

Add 4 good shakes of worstershire and 2-4 4T A1. If you have any steak or hamburger seasoning throw some in to really give it some nice flavor, completely omit the milk and add a quarter cup of parmesan cheese. A packet of Lipton onion soup mix can be used in place of a fresh onion. I used two sleeves of the roasted vegetable Ritz crackers. I buy lean turkey from Sam's Club so no grease, so no need to put in a flat pan as original directions suggest. I used a stonewre loaf pan From pampered chef. I poured sweet Baby Rays wing sauce instead of the ketchup mixture. I encourage you to use your favorite barbecue or wing sauce and experiment!

This turkey meatloaf is awesome.  If you make it with lean or extra lean turkey, you don't need to drain off the liquid after 30 mins.  Make sure to chop the onions finely.  Also, next time I make it, I'll prob halve the sauce.  It will save on calories, and it seemed a bit excessive!

Turned out well but I too found it a little flat on the taste as did my son. We will cut out the milk next time and maybe add some BBQ sauce or something else instead.

Everyone loves this recipe.  I change it up a little.  I saute the onions and garlic and use herded  breadcrumbs.  I also add a little ketchup into the meat mixture.  For the topping I add a little Stubbs sweet BBQ sauce into the ketchup instead of using all ketchup.  Always a hit!

I first made this recipe approximately a year ago. It is so good. My boyfriend's 10yr son old begs for me to make this all the time. He would live off of this if we would let him. The last time I made it I doubled the recipe to freeze some but i don't think it freezes to well?? The only thing I did different was to make more of the topping so after it is sliced we can drizzle a little extra on the slices. This topping is also great on my frozen turkey burgers instead of catsup!

I love love love this recipe. Only things I change: (1) I use saltines instead of round crackers. (2) I use the mince garlic that comes in a jar instead of mincing myself. (3) I add Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce to the meatloaf topping. (3) Actually I make A LOT more topping than the recipe calls for so sometimes I just taste test the topping and vary the amounts of BBQ sauce and Worcestershire sauce. This comes out so so so good! Especially if you use Butterball ground turkey

Wow. The glaze is what makes this loaf a must repeat. The only two things I did different was used almond milk instead of milk and used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers. Super tasty.

This was pretty good, and I made it exactly as written. I did find that the loaf didn't produce very much juice, even though I used 85% ground turkey instead of the available 93%. I did like this glaze more than the last meatloaf recipe I tried, which had mustard in it. Also, I preferred the way this loaf used crushed crackers for the bread filler instead of slices of bread cut into cubes; it just resulted in a nicer texture. Worth making again, I think.

Good starter recipe because the consistency was great, but really lacking in flavour other than the taste of turkey. Next time I would add a generous amount of seasoning. I have to say that leftovers did make great sandwiches.

First time making it, was very good.  Second time around I added a little more seasoning than what was recommended and some red bell peppers.  This is a very great recipe.  So easy to make!

Milk made it mushy. Cut by 1/2 or more.  
WAY too salty!! Cut by 1/2 to 2/3 (or make without salt and add salt at the table if you wish - tastes the same as cooking it in).
Flavor was good, if mild.  I was looking for stomach friendly foods. Turkey meatloaf works.  I replaced regular onions with green onion tops, which are easier on the stomach.  Then I could add more sauce at the table, since it's not MY stomach that's the problem!

I used BBQ sauce b/c didn't have worc. sauce. I used 1.25 lbs. turkey. I added just a little chopped red pepper. My salt was about 3/4 tspn. I didn't have crackers or soft bread crumbs so I used some panko I found in my cupboard. Finally, I added in some shredded mozzarella, but I didn't measure it. I would make it again. It's a good staple recipe.

I added 1/4 teaspoon sage and 1/2 teaspoon chili powder. Next time I will also add 1/4 cup chopped green pepper and substitute a small can of tomatoes sauce for the milk. I will cut the salt in half next time. The men loved it as did I.

Great standard recipe.  I added 1 small carrot and 1 stalk celery both finly chopped.  Also cut down on the salt.  Cut down just a bit on the brown sugar and added some honey for the topping.  Actual cook time was 50 minutes.  Wife said its the best she has had.

Easy recipe and my kids liked it.  They agreed that this is something to make again.  My only criticism is that it needs some more savory seasoning.  I will add cheese as suggested by another reviewer next time.

I liked it, but I will make it without the salt next time.  It was too salty for me.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was very good. Cooked it a little longer because mine was still pink in the middle after the hour of cooking time.

It was very delicious. I used the same recipe with few modifications. I crumbled brown bread instead of butter crackers and a of little panko bread crumbs. I used a quarter of an onion and no garlic. For the sauce I had no worcestershire sauce nor brown sugar so I used a ltttle soy sauce and schriracha and organic ketchup. I baked according go directions and it was so so moist. My husband loved it, will definitly make again using my modifications.

Love the sauce but it takes away from the healthy aspect.

I made this when a friend requested turkey meatloaf. I'm not usually a fan of meatloaf of any kind and I was definitely worried I wouldn't like this. But I was way off. I used the highest fat dark meat ground turkey because I figured it would be the most juicy. Followed the recipe to a T. Now one of my favorite dishes :)
