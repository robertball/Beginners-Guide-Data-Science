Three stars as written, or maybe a generous four stars, as this dish, as written, needs some pizzazz-ing up.  By the time I was done with this, Hubs thought it was “professionaI.” I sauteed up some bacon to which I added shallots and fresh, minced garlic.  Tossed in some fresh baby spinach and cooked it just until wilted.  Once cooled, I mushed that into the cream cheese along with the mozzarella and some chopped, roasted red peppers.  What a boost of flavor those few additions gave this!  I could have eaten this concoction all on its own, spread on some crostini!  But I didn’t.  We needed dinner.  Instead of crushed Ritz crackers I used seasoned bread crumbs – another layer of flavor!  Finally, instead of commercial spaghetti sauce I used tomato sauce I had put up from my garden seasoned with some herbs.  I served this over penne pasta.  This was unquestionably the most delicious and delectable dish I’ve had in some time. Thanks to Kraft/Philadelphia Cream Cheese for the basic “canvas” with which to create my own masterpiece.

Ohhh so yummy! Used the whole 8oz box of cream cheese, 4oz seemed not enough for 10oz of spinach, and added 1 more TBSP of parmesan. Turned out to be a good mix. I also didn't have ritz crackers, so used italian style bread crumbs (what I had on hand). Wrapped the chicken in a slice of bacon and used a toothpick to secure it. I served it over pasta with spaghetti sauce. My family LOVED it! I will definitely make this many times over!

This was very good, only because I used BLSL chicken thighs, it was too fatty. DON'T DO THAT. Use chicken breasts like the recipe states. I will say that I doubled the coating because the amount called for wasn't quite enough, used fresh spinach that I cooked down in a little EVOO and I made my own sauce. I also added a little italian seasoning to the filling. Little changes like that really make it more personal and make this dish even more flavorful. I'll make this again. Combo of everything together was really tasty.

Great little recipe that's a wonderful creamy, cheesy take on traditional chicken parmesan! Plus, the filling is a great base for add-in's so get creative and adjust to your own likes or use what you have on hand. I used fresh spinach that I sauteed with a little garlic just until wilted along with some baby portabella mushrooms. I also added in some sun-dried tomatoes that I had on hand. I didn't have Ritz crackers, and even if I did I still opt for Italian seasoned bread crumbs. For the pasta sauce, I used "Bertolli Marinara" that I added a little white wine to along with some fresh basil. Wow - this turned out to be a really awesome dish that was perfect for Sunday dinner! Great with a side of angel hair pasta and a garden salad - YUM!

I used breadcrumbs instead of ritz crackers and cooked it in a pan with some extra virgin olive oil and it got a really yummy crunchy browned crust.  We will make this again!  YUM!

Awesome and college dude friendly. Yeah I will make this on at least a few dates, so it must be good.  Looks very very pretty too.  I was more of a fan without the spaghetti sauce; thought it was a bit too strongly flavored and tended to take away from the amazing-ness inside. I am thinking about topping with parsley next time. Oh and I used Whipped Cream cheese to cut down on the fat a tad. Seemed to work really well!  THanks a lot, great dish!

This was super easy and delicious!!!  What a great recipe.  I didn't top with cheese and sauce, just baked as directed and served on pasta with my homemade tomato sauce.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

I made this for my family and friends. They loved it. I followed the recipe and it was great. Served it over Fettuccine noodles along side a salad. My friends asked where I was taking a cooking class .

This is one awesome chicken recipe.. I've never tried the pounding and the rolling thing, but the filling was so easy to make I just had to do it... It was a huge hit.  My daughter thought she was eating in a fancy restaurant.  It's worth it when your family raves about it.  I'll be making it again and again.

This is one off the best chicken recipes I have had in a long time. Made it for 8 of us and everyone loved it. I did pound the breast to make it thinner and easier to roll.

Very good...I did change a few things, used fresh spinach, seasoned with onion and garlic, used bread crumbs instead of crackers. Cooked up quickly and I didn't bother with the toothpicks. Served it with my own homemade sauce over whole grain pasta.

This dish had all the ingredients I was looking for in tonight’s meal. However, instead of frozen spinach I used fresh spinach. I sautéed a bag of fresh organic baby spinach in olive oil with minced garlic before adding it to the reduced-fat cream cheese w/shredded mozzarella cheese . I opted to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of ritz crackers. I served the chicken with,"Homemade Tomato Sauce I," from this website, that I made today with fresh herbs and roasted garlic. I topped it off with some sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and served over bed of, "Garlic Angel Hair Pasta," from this site. We all enjoyed this very tasty and satisfying meal. Next time I might add mushrooms to the spinach mixture. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is really good.  I made a few adjustments.  First, I didn't have cream cheese so I subsituted boursin.  I think it gives it a little more flavor and I used more than the amount listed.  Second, I also used more crackers to get a thicker coating.  All in all, a yummy and easy dinner

This was good just not great.  The filling wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  Chicken did come out very moist.  I, too, used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.

I cooked this last night and my husband could hardly eat for telling me "how good it was". Even at bedtime he was still talking about it. My 19 yr old son gave it 10/10!. I added fresh parsley and basil along with garlic granules to stuffing, mixed Italian bread crumbs with Ritz! FABULOUS AND PRESENTS WELL....LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM FINE DINING RESTAURANT

This is definitely a keeper!  I took a few tips from the other reviews.  I used the bell pepper and onion cooked in a saute pan with a little olive oil and two cloves of garlic.  I also substituted the fresh spinach for the frozen.  I just put it in with the other veggies until wilted.  Bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Husband said to put this one in the keeper book.  Seven year old said "oh mommy I love it.  Thirteen year old cleaned his plate.  We will do it again

Pretty good to us.  I used about 6oz cream cheese because it seemed like it was too small an amount.  I only used about 8oz frozen spinach and that was plenty to our tastes.  The filling is rich and creamy.  The chicken coated with the crackers was also tasty.

This is amazing! I made it for dinner tonight. The only things I changed: I used chicken cutlets so no need to pound the breasts. I added feta and garlic to the spinach mix. And I followed others and browned the chicken before I baked it. I served it with linguini. And used Classico tomato basil sauce, which is my family's favorite. I wish I could give this 10 stars! Yum!

Loved this recipe.  Just a few minor changes though:  First I sauted 2-3 T diced onion, 4-5 diced mushrooms and 1 clove minced garlic in evo.  Drained it then continued recipe as written only added small amount of red pepper flakes and a bit of salt to the filling.  I also used 1/2 crackers and half seasoned bread crumbs for the breading.  This recipe was a hit at our house.

Great recipe! Would use less spinach next time though. I also combined the ritz crackers with some Italian breadcrumbs to give it a nice texture. I served the marinara sauce on the side. Next time I'm going to add some pancetta to the mixture to give it some more flavor. I pounded the chicken breasts thin to make it e3asier to roll up. But overall I think this was a good recipe and super easy to make!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and wished I had added seasonings to the spinach/cream cheese mixture.  I thought it was a little bland.  My husband however said it was perfect.  But we both agreed it made a beautiful presentation and were very tasty.

When I made this I thought ah it's okay and definitely would have rated it three stars. But the next day I ate it for lunch and it was 5 stars. Tasted much better the next day. Hmm why does some food taste better as left overs? :0)

meh. this was ok. I love cream cheese, but I thought in this, it was a little overwhelming. Next time I'd use less cream cheese and more parmesan and mozzerella. I'm not sure if I'd make this again though.

Love this recipe, was delicious I lightened with Fat Free parmesan, low fat cream cheese and whole grain brown spaghetti.  I also used the Sweet Basil sauce recipe I found also.   Definitely a keeper

Just made this recipe but gave it 3 stars coz i made couple of changes. I flatened the chicken breast and seasoned it with fresh ginger along with salt,pepper, and paprika. I substitute the cream with non fat yogurt to make healthy and the mozzarella for a fat free one and the crackers with italian seasoned breadcrumb. It took 10 min longer in the oven but it turned out delicious!

These were pretty tasty. I used some lemon pepper and garlic powder to season the chicken, and it was a nice combination with the cheese and spinach filling.

This was delicious.  I used a jar of pimento cheese spread instead of the cream cheese.  I sauteed some onion, garlic and kale ( I didn't have any spinach) and added that to the cheese mix.  I used fresh parmesan cheese.  To the cheese mix, I also added fresh basil.  I used Glutino's gluten-free crackers and added Italian seasoning to the crumbs.  I used additional garlic salt and lemon pepper to the chicken breasts once filled and tied them up with unwaxed dental floss.  I did not add any pasta sauce since the cheese mixture was so flavorful.  I only added the remaining mozzarella.  It was out of this world!

This chicken is fantastic!  I always dry chicken in the oven and this was really moist.  The only addition I would do next time is add prosciutto to the chicken before I spread on the spinach mixture!  YUM!

I made this tonight - fantastic!  There were only a few slight modifications made based on our personal tastes and previous reviews.....I used Italian bread crumbs as I was concerned the Ritz may give it a sweet taste.  Also followed a previous review and sauteed some fresh spinach, onion and seasonings in bacon pieces.  Seasoning the chicken breasts before adding the cream cheese mixture enhanced an already great recipe!  !  Thanks for sharing - this will be a regular at our house!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  My husband gave it a five star rating.  I bought thin sliced chicken breasts to make this dish a little less work.  I used a bag of fresh spinach that I wilted in a pan with minced garlic and onion flakes.  I used whipped cream cheese (appx. 6 ounces) and mixed with the spinach mixture.  I placed a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of breast, then the spinach mixture, rolled and dipped in egg then Italian Panko bread crumbs with some grated Parmesan cheese.  I also used a 24 ounce jar of pasta sauce, because I had Penne pasta as a side.  Will definitely make this again.

SO SO GOOD!! I pretty much followed the directions except for I used non fat cream cheese and reduced fat Ritz. I'm not a huge marinara fan so I opted to use alfredo sauce instead. It did not disappoint! I used a store bought "lower fat" version and decided to add a little white pepper, garlic pepper, and leftovers of the spinach filling into the sauce! SO GOOD! I also added a little of the mozzarella and parmesan to my store bought sauce. Served it over penne pasta for my boyfriend and he loved it as well. Next time I will try adding roasted red peppers inside as well. I think a homemade alfredo would be better for next time when I'm not watching my fat intake (better than the olive garden alfredo from this site is yummy!)

This was a great recipe.  It is a lot of preparation but totally worth it.  Instead of pounding the chicken if it was too thick, I sliced it in half and rolled up the chicken that way.  It was still thick enough to where it warranted pinning it together with toothpicks.

Additionally, we added red pepper flakes and Parmesan to our liking before serving and it gave it great kick!

We are making this recipe again tomorrow night it was so good!

This was good and easy to make.  I didn't have enough mozzarella left to put on top so I served with noodles in marinara sauce.  I thought the Ritz crackers gave the coating a nice flavor.  Will try again!

These were a little messy to put together, but SO worth the effort. I had to make a few emergency substitutions based on what I had on hand. I mixed the cream cheese & spinach with about a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning blend for the filling and rolled the bundles in 1 1/2 cups of crushed cornflakes & 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Unfortunately, I forgot the part about dipping the bundles in egg so the topping didn't stick to the chicken very well. After baking them, we topped them with warmed alfredo sauce instead of a tomato based sauce and they were a big hit with the entire family.  Definitely a do-over!

Turned out great and really simple. I just grated some mozzarella cheese added some powdered parmesan cheese and cream cheese. Mixing all that together with the warm spinach thawed in the microwave made a nice butter like spread to smear on one side of my butterflied chicken breasts.

These were really satisfying and sofisticated for being so quick and easy to make!  We really enjoyed them.  They were missing some flavor, so I'd recommend adding italian seasoning and garlic.  Also, must serve with spaghetti.

They were so good, I made them for Christmas and have made them multiple times since. I added Kraft Shredded Triple Cheddar Cheese With A Touch Of Philadelphia. It made it even better!

My husband cannot get enough of this. If I made this every week, he would be happy! 
For a change of pace I made some with chipped deli ham (instead of spinach) and it sort of tastes like chicken cordon bleu. (Make sure you get the ham chipped @ the deli. I tried thin sliced ham but it was hard to roll up, when making them & was too hard to cut, when eating them). 
Even though we like the spinach ones, we prefer the ham ones.

I made this for dinner tonight and it couldn't have been more delicious!  I omitted using the pasta sauce and it didn't need it.  The chicken was juicy and delicious.  I seasoned the chicken before I rolled it, seasoned the egg with S&P, as well as using fresh spinach and sautéing them in a bit of EVOO with seasonings and onion before adding it to the cheese.   I've added this to my regular rotation.  Thank you!!!

As written my family did not care for this recipe.  Since then I started making these using ricotta instead of the cream cheese and Italian bread crumbs in place of the crackers. Aside for the ricotta I use the rest of the ingredients listed, I also add salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of parsley. I use homemade marinara sauce and top each bundle with extra mozzarella. Delicious! They freeze very well uncooked for a quick meal on a busy night.

I subed the spinach for romaine lettuce, and next cheese instead of mozzarella.. served over a bed of rice. I used bacon crackers for topping and it was a solid hit.

This dish is easy to make but if I would have followed the recipe, it would have been very bland. I used more spices and salt, I added mushroom to the cream cheese and spinach mix, I used panko that I seasoned to Italian spices. At the end, it was delicious!!! I'm glad I read the reviews before I made it and decided to add more flavor

Hmmm really yummy, but I modified it so I don't know how the original tastes. 
I cooked some mushroom, onion, minced garlic, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and lastly added fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Then I added this to the cream cheese. And this became my mixture.

I also sprinkled salt and pepper to my chicken breast. Then for the coating I added garlic and onion powder. Cook as directed. Soooooo soooo good. 

I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I just made some rice and a side of broccoli.

I make this for my husband to be all the time. I don't put the spinach in it but I put a slice of ham on the chicken before the cream cheese mixture and he LOVES it! His favorite thing I make by far.

Oh my gosh, this was DELICIOUS!! I will continue to make this probably twice a week. I changed a few things.. Instead of crushed Ritz I used crushed saltine crackers and added chicken rub, sage, and pepper into it for some more flavor. I think the Ritz with the rub, sage, and pepper would have been even better tho. I also didn't have mozerella so I used the shredded mexican blend and it was awesome. I'll do that every time. I used plenty of it and it turned out really amazing. Don't feel the need to follow the measurements exactly, use what you think would taste good! I just used the directions as guidelines. Happy cookin'!

As another reviewer said, I don't know why more people haven't rated this recipe.  Glad I took a chance on it.  It was wonderful.  I followed the recipe (mostly) but skipped the parmesan cheese (my hubby doesn't like it) and subbed gf breadcrumbs for ritz crackers.  Honestly, I'd skip the breading entirely next time.  I am not sure it added anything.  This was a really nice twist on the classic chicken parm.  The creamy spinach filling really added something wonderful to this dish.  I cooked my chicken covered for 20 minutes, put on the spaghetti sauce (classico carmelized onion & roasted garlic) and remaining mozzarella, and baked for the last 10 minutes.  Delicious!  I served it with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto from this site.

Absolutely Awesome! and easy :) The "hardest"  part was flattening the chicken, which wasn't hard at all. It came out perfect, following the recipe. This is the best ever chicken recipe I've ever made.

Very good!  I modified slightly by adding green onion to the cream cheese & spinach mixture.  I had used fresh spinach that I cooked down a bit on the stove-top and cooked the green onions a bit as well.  I also ended up using shredded cheddar after realizing after I got home that I didn't have shredded mozzarella after all (so then I didn't serve it with the tomato sauce).  I also just springkled some whole grain bread crumbs on top vs. the egg  & crackers.  We thought it was delicious - will definitely make again.

Mmmm really tasty! The only reason I gave it a for is that I think you could subsitute break crumbs (1/3 cup) for the ritz crackers and save some time crushing them. Also it took about 10 minutes longer that the recipe said, but was very good! Next time I will try a different cheese as mozzarella is not that tasty.

I've made this twice now and my husband raves about how good it is.  I like it too!  Very easy to make and deliciious!  I substituted bread crumbs for the Ritz crackers and it still came out good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy, I could see a lot of people liking this recipe. I will cut down the spinach next time though and also be sure to use smaller chicken breasts. I tried to make it with 3 larger ones and it was just a bit too much on the inside.  I'm also not a huge fan of spaghetti sauce, i think in this it took the flavor away from the chicken. I would serve it on the side.

Wow!  I'm trying to teach myself how to cook before I get married.  This is was the first dish I made that I considered "fancy."  It turned out great!  My fiance loved it and said that we needed to make it again.  To date, this is the tastiest dish I've ever made!
