To the person who gave this one star and wanted to give it zero. So your garlic turned blue. THERE IS NO GARLIC IN THE RECIPE. Don't change the recipe and then give it a bad review.

Wonderful, I left out the sugar for two reasons, one it cuts down on the carbs and two I like my pickles a little tart. This is a keeper

This is a very good recipe.  The only difference I did was add a teaspoon of celery seed and a tablespoon of mustard seed.  I also made a recipe and a half of the vinegar, sugar and salt mixture.  I like more liquid in mine.  This was very easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made these today....yuuuummmmmmy!! I used 6 large cucumbers, 1 large vidalia and 2 green peppers.  I added 2 tbsp mustard seed and 1 tbsp celery seed to the mix. One thing you need to know, the cucumbers really reduce down once they have sat in the vinegar. I filled jars and processd them in a hot water bath, and when they came out the jars were only half full.  I would let the mixture sit in the bowl for at least 2 hours and then fill your jars if you are going to process them. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I rated these 4 stars because I made some modifications.  I added 1 tbsp of mustard seed, 1 tsp of celery seed, and 1 tsp of turmeric (to make them bread and butter pickles).  Also, not mentioned in the recipe but very important, if your brine doesn't cover your cucumbers, don't add extra water.  The cucumbers will release water into the brine and then it will cover them.

If this is your first time making pickles, here are a few notes so you can avoid the mistakes I made:
1. Don't use white onion, it's too strong.  Use sweet or vidalia onions.
2. Slice the onion and green pepper into strips, don't dice them.  If you dice them the flavour is too strong.
3. Cucumber sliced thinly (1/8-1/4 inch) will pickle in 1-2 days, and will stay crisp for 3-5 days.  Cucumber sliced thickly (3/8-1/2 inch) will pickle in 3-4 days, and will stay crisp for a week or more.  So if you want pickles now and later, do a jar of each.
4. If you use this brine to pickle other things (I did cauliflower, green peppers and asparagus) you need to use more brine on those vegetables than you did on the cucumber.  I added water to the brine thinking that when I made cucumber pickles, they released water which added the extra liquid to the brine.  That didn't work.  You need to cover the almost completely, then finish with water, to make a strong enough brine for other vegetables.  Steaming the vegetables first might help too, I haven't tried that yet.

These are really good!  How long will they last in the refrigerator?? I've only made one batch so far but I could make a lot more if they'll last a while.

Ok, I made these and they were easy and look totally fantastic....but the garlic slices I put in there turned BLUE after 3 days in the fridge.  What happened? TheStaff@Allrecipes Note: The acidity of the vinegar turned the garlic blue. Garlic contains anthocyanins that turn blue or purple in an acid solution (the pickle juice). It is ok to eat the pickles.

This was a good pickle recipe and it was the first one I had ever made since I had so many pickles from my cucumber plant this year.  I used the same recipe, except using splenda instead of sugar.  I did add more vinegar with others advice but found (since it was the first time I made pickles) that after the cucumbers sit in the fridge overnight the 1st time, they will create more juice and more liquid will appear.  So, I would not fill up my bottles completely with liquid before letting them refrigerate.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am 67yrs. old and have done more then my share of canning different recipes.  I have to tell you this is the best out there.  If I could give more then 5 stars I would.  I used a fork to grate the peeling to make it spriped.  I chopped red and green peppers to make it colorful.  I added 1 cup of peppers to each recipe.  As for the onions, I cut the onion in half then sliced thinly.  I one and a half timed the vinegar,salt and sugar. I added 1 t. celery seed and 1 t. mustard seed to each recipe.  You won;t be disappointed   with this recipe.

I started off looking for a bread and butter pickle recipe but liked the simplicity of this recipe.  so I decided to make triple this recipe and put them in jars for the winter.    I added celery salt and tumeric and mustard seed (my personal favourites) and followed this recipe with the exception, since I wanted to store them, I heated the liquid ingredients to boiling, dumped in the drained cucumbers and let them sit until almost boiling again.  I put the pickles into the jars, brought the liquid to a full boil and poured into the jars.  Cleaned the lids, sealed and boiled in a hot water bath for 15 minutes.  This worked wonderfully.  Tip 1:  If you use a mandalin (large plastic slicing machine) it saves you TONS of work and your cucumbers are uniform in size.  Tip 2:  If you have hard water, pour 1/4 cup of vinegar into your processing water and your jars wont come out all white and scaley.  Thanks for this wonderful and easy idea!

I HATE sweet pickles!  But I love dill pickles, and am a fan of cucumbers and anything vinegary.  After reading some reviews, I also decided to cut the sugar in half due to my dislike of sweet pickles.  There ended up being just a hint of sweetness, but it is overpowered by the vinegar.  A perfect combination!  I also added some mustard seed, celery salt, and dill weed.  I can't even wait for these to fully cool, I'm eating them already.  Thanks for posting this pathetically easy recipe!!!

I thought these pickles were great!  I made these twice and love them.  I would really like to get them to keep longer, can you process these and put them up without refrigerating?  If so, how?  Thanks!

This recipe was so easy and the pickles were wonderful.  I read all of the reviews before making this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written,however, I did allow them to sit in the bowl for two hours for reduction.  They are beautiful in the jar and absolutely wonderful.  This is a quick recipe that I can do everyday with the few cukes I get out of the garden.  I also did this with some of my squash and my Mom loved it.  This is a wonderful recipe to keep!!!  I am adding a photo of some of my jars.

PICKLES?  NOPE, not here...salad topping!  I peeled the cukes, made thin slices of onion and chunked the peppers.  Poured the "hot mixture" over them and cooled in fridge a couple of hours.  Served over a lettuce mix and VIOLA...some sassy salad we had.  

P.S. I used 3 cucumbers, 1/2 onion, 1/2 a green pepper and made 1/2 ther recipe for the marinate.  GOTTA TRY THIS!

Fantastic recipe. Quick, easy and a great way to use those cukes!
I omitted the green pepper and cut sugar to my taste.

To the person who gave this a one star ...  garlic has anthocyanins, water-soluble pigments that turn blue or purple with acid like vinegar.  I have seen this so many times before ... it does not affect taste or the recipe.

In my opinion giving a one star to a recipe for naturally occurring properties is sad!

This was a great recipe as is and I am rating it as such. At first it doesn't look like there will be enough liquid for all the cucumbers but after letting it sit the juice from the cucumbers sure made up for it. As is, the recipe makes a slightly sweet pickle.  I prefer mine a bit tangy so I intend to continue using this recipe with an adjustment to the vinegar and sugar ratio for my particular taste.

DEE-lishous!  What to do when you have too many cucumbers (they are like zucchini, they multiply when you arent looking)  used 1 cup of sugar an 1 t of stevia.  Plenty sweet perhaps too sweet!  sliced onions thinly and added banana peppers and yellow and orange pepper slices.  made double juice but would not do again as i dont think they need to be covered completely as they probably make more of their own juice while pickling.  easy and divine~ very versitle.

Excellent!  I too cut back on the sugar. Used 2 cups of vinegar and 1 cup of sugar.  It's the perfect mixture of tangy and sweet.  Added 2 tsp of celery seed and mustard seed and a bit of turmeric.  So easy and delicious!

This was our first attempted at this recipe.  We didn't want REALLY sweet, so only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  Added a tsp. of dillweed and a few garlic cloves.  We let everything soak for a couple hours in the bowl.  The samples before the jars were EXCELLENT... we're giving them a few days until the next sample.  I'm thinking after the kids try them, it'll be the LAST sample of THIS batch.  Definate THUMBS UP!!

This was my first time making pickles and I think they turned out very well! The recipe is super easy too, which is great. I didn't have that many cucumbers, so I cut the recipe back a bit. I also cut the sugar by about 3/4 and it was perfect. I had to double the liquid because as is there just wasn't enough to cover. I also added a couple clove of garlic. I chopped some of these up and put them in my macaroni salad for dinner tonight :)

Forget about it!  I could eat like 20 lbs of these.  CRAZY EMAZING as my 7 year old would say. You talk about easy and so, so good.  I used yellow and orange peppers to give it color.  We made the batch and it lasted about 10 minutes at our BBQ.  Next time I will have to make probably 3 huge pickle jars full.  You can't stop eating.  Total winner.

I found this pickle recipe last summer and made it many times using home-grown cucumbers, to rave reviews.  It is incredibly simple, and the pickles taste great.  I shared the recipe countless times.  If you are looking for a foolproof, simple recipe, you just found it!

This is very similar to my grandmother's refrigerator pickles recipe. The only difference is that I layer the cucumbers, peppers and onions in a bowl with the salt for an hour and then drain before adding the vinegar and sugar. I may also use apple cider vinegar when it is on hand rather than white vinegar. Probably the biggest hint is to slice the vegetables paper-thin. It adds a wonderful texture and they stay very crispy. These keep for up to six weeks in the fridge, but they never last that long in my house. I give these away frequently to friends and family and now August can't come without requests for Grandma Leona's Refrigerator Pickles.

Didn't change a thing and they turned out excellent! Crisp and sweet. I waited three days to eat any to ensure the pickling had a chance to do its thing. Just about to make another batch with more of the cucumbers coming out of the garden.

These are SO GOOD. Next time I'll slice them all thicker, I did some thick and some thin and the thicker they are, the crispier they are. I might cut back on the sugar, too, though the little people in my house may object - they LOVE the sweetness of these. I want to make a batch w/ some sliced fresh jalapenos in the mix, too. Next time I'll use way more onion, too, the onions are my favorite part!

I have never made homemade pickles before.  Simply awesome!  I doubled the vinegar solution because I had a lot of cucumbers and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup for the double batch.  i.e. I cut the sugar WAY back.  Next time I will double the vinegar mix and only do 1/4 cup sugar for the entire batch.  I love a sweet pickle but I don't want a massive batch of sweet pickles.  Even with the 1/2 c sugar, the pickles are still plenty sweet.  I added 1 T mustard seed, 1 T celery seed and a sprinkle of dried dill.  I think these would be awesome with a jalapeno (cut in half) instead of green pepper.  If I ever end up with tons of pickle cucumbers again, I will certainly be making these again!  It was SO incredibly simple too!  Lastly, I didn't completely cover the cucumbers with the vinegar.  Other posters assured us the cucumber water would work it out, and it did indeed.  We started eating our pickles the day after I made them and they were great!!  Cut thick slices and spears.

These were just so YUMMY!  They got even better with a few days age.  I took another members suggestion and added 1 tsp. of celery seed and 1/2 tsp of ground mustard.  I made another 1/2 batch(recipe cut in half)of the juice.  Just cause I thought it needed more liquid.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will be making these again very soon.  I gave so many jars away I am almost out.

This is a great basic recipe and so much can be added to it to please anyone's taste. Beware of adding garlic due to the acidic content. You can either use already pickled garlic or add some turmeric to disguise the discoloration. For those of you with problems in processing these pickles for canning; both shrinkage and no-crisp. This is NOT a recipe to be used for canning. To can you need to adjust your liquid to contain more acid for crispness and when you "cook" (canning does cook them) they will reduce as the natural water evaporates into the canning liquid. Please use a recipe specifically designed for canning.

A good starting point.  Based on other reviews, I cut the sugar back by more than half and skipped the peppers.  Will play around with it more next time.  I will make thicker slices of cuke, add some spices, and cut out the sugar entirely.  I really want a cukey, half sour pickle.

Delicious! I don't think you would need all the cups of sugar though. I used 2/3 cup of sugar and about 1/2 tsp of pure stevia white powder (equals 1/2 cup sugar) to make the calories much less. It's plenty sweet!

This is a great way to use up all of your cucumbers.  I followed the suggestions to add 50% more liquid, and also added a teaspoon each of mustard seed and celery seed to each jar.  For additional flavor, try adding sliced garlic or hot peppers too.

My rating here is false as I did not make the recipe.  I have instead a question about the comment of using sterile jars.  I understand the need for sterilized jars but doesn't putting raw veggies in an unsterilized bowl compromise the bacterial free process?   Does the pouring and incorporation of the vinegar pickling liquid accomplish & restore the sterile state?    Thanks, just never pickled anything before.

Very good basic refrigerator sweet pickles.  loved it and the grandkids enjoy helping me make them.  We also tried with some extra cucumbers (not enough for a whole batch) making it exactly the same but adding some pickling spices to it.  The grandkids just sprinkled a little in both the jars and when consumed they LOVED those.  AND, just to pass along the grandkids EVEN ate the onion and green pepper in them, which they HATE otherwise, so THANKS sooo much for the recipe!

Very easy and tasty.  As suggested by other reviewers, I cut the sugar in half, and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.  Also, I omitted the green pepper since that did not appeal to me.

Very good but too sweet and I even reduced the sugar by half a cup. I added some crushed black pepper and a pinch of dill weed. Next time, will use only one cup of sugar.

I've made this twice now; first as written save for the peppers and the second time also reducing the sugar as other reviewers have suggested. I must say that I prefer the sweetness of 2C of sugar. Still good at 1.5C and probably good at 1C but 2C is my preference. I've used both Persian and Armenian cukes (skins intact) and both stay wonderfully crunchy.

Awesome.  Didn't have pepper but doubled everything else.  Had maybe 8 or 10 cups cukes.  Poured mixture over cukes and put in fridge.  The cukes wilted a bit but stayed crunchy and had more brine than cukes in the end.  I would use more cukes next time with same amount of liquid.  I was afraid not enough liquid but I had plenty!!

These pickles are fantastic! Easy! Delicious! I have given it to at least 5 people and given jars and jars of pickles to friends when we've gone to their houses for barbeques. I substituted one cup of the sugar with one cup of Splenda because we have lots of diabetics in our family. Works just as well.

Loved this recipe with no alterations.  Pickles came out crisp and sweet, good on sandwiches. I stored the pickles in a glass jar in the fridge without processing them any further, but another reviewer said that she could process them to seal the jars to store in the pantry.....note she did say to leave them soaking in the 'brine' longer- about 2 hours to get enough liquid to process them in a hot water bath.

I just made these for the second time and both times they are outstanding! This is a very variable recipe. This time I used a combination of red wine vinegar and white balsamic vinegar and reduced the sugar by half. I used sweet red, yellow and orange bell peppers minced finely, and I used diced red onions--the colors are so pretty in the jars. For seasoning I added to the boiling vinegars, sugar, peppers and onion: Herbs de Provence, garlic slivers, ginger puree, whole cloves and peppercorns. The aroma was very zingy and the flavor yum as can be. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had SOooo much fun with this recipe!!  the taste is awesome ( I added pickling spice to a couple jars) and the recipe is SO versatile!!! I got 7 lbs of gherkin cukes at my market about a day before they were too ripe, got them for $2.00 and played for a 1/2 hour in the kitchen and got - pickles w/peppers, w/vidallia onions, and then anything else that needed to get used up. On the "chunkier" pickles I set the jars in simmering water for about 5 minutes or so and thay were awesome just 2 days later.

I've been following this recipe for a long time. It's so easy and delicious. Here's a few variations I make: add a lot of dill to the jar of cucumbers. Want to use less sugar? Add some baby carrots to sweeten or balance the sour of the vinegar. Want to make it spicy? Add some cayenne (just a little) or some hot peppers to the mix.

Do you have to boil the vinager? I made these without doing that and they came out great. I do this with hot peppers as well.

Trying using honey as the sweetener instead of sugar.  Makes a great change!
I have been using a similar recipe for more than 40 years and this year someone told me about using honey.  We love it!

This was a great recipe...made it exactly to the recipe on the first batch...The second batch I added nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice, ground cloves, and ginger.  My son says it's the best... I am letting them set for a couple of hours before canning them.. I read other peoples reviews that recommended this.  I agree. They do reduce... Thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent! Have never made refer pickles before and found this recipe to be easy and delicious. I had about 8 cupes of sliced cukes so added 1/2 more ingredients to the recipe and also added celery seed (1.5 T) but not mustard seed as I didn't have any. Also used red pepper instead of green. I would advise that they sit overnight in a big bowl then pack into containers the next day as they do shrink and create more liquid.

I read the reviews about the sweetness.  I did 1/2 cup sugar to every 1 cup of vinegar, and did 2 tablespoons of salt.  I left out the bell pepper because I didn't have any & I used seedless cucumbers.  My pickle loving 4 year old gives them 5 starts & we are eating them warm 1hr after making them.  This would have been so perfect when I was pregnant!  I plan on making these often. In the way I have made these the sweetness is just an aftertone & very mild.  Happy tummy.

I give this 5 stars, but would give more.  This is great for a first timer - and that is what I was.  I used the cucumbers from my garden and I did process mine.  They were fantastic.  I did let them sit for 2 hours and it did make more juice, but I also doubled the vinegar,sugar and spices to make sure I had enough to process them in the canner.  
I think you could use any type of onion or pepper   I used Banana peppers, cubanelles and some red cherry bomb peppers - because my garden has an abundance.   We have already eaten one whole container.   Super happy with outcome.

These were ok if you like sweet pickles. I tripled the liquid and only did 2 cups of sugar... it was still way toooo sweet. Next time I think I will cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup even with the other liquid still tripled. I used regular cucumbers and did some spears and some chips. Some I took the skins off and some I left on. I think I like the skins on because they seemed a little crunchier. I think I will add some fresh dill weed and a pepper next time for a little change.

Sweet, tasty and easy to make.  My one year old couldn't get enough.  I peeled the cucumbers but only because the ones from my garden had tough skins this year.

These are very good! I too added celery seed & ground mustard. I also added some thick slices of garlic & in part of the batch, I added chopped jalapenos to add some heat. I took MICHELLE_MANDELL's suggestion to let them sit in the solution for a couple of hours until the cukes are reduced...thanks!  And thansk to Diane for a wonderful recipe.

What an easy, absolutely delicious recipe. I love that I can make up a couple of jars in half an hour whenever we want them. Of course we have to have a taste that evening before they are ready. But then, the next day.... Oh so good. Anyone who has tried them has raved. (I usually don't change a recipe but I did add the mustard & celery seeds.) I have a hubby who loves pickled beets so I tried the same recipe also adding onions with the exception that I added a teaspoon of ground cloves (no mustard & celery seeds) and O M G they were wonderful again with raving reviews from family and especially hubby. No more store bought pickles or beets for us. Thank you so much for this wonderful addition to my refrigerator.

Reduced the sugar by half and added 2 T of McCormick's pickling spice to the vinegar/sugar mixture.  Big hit with my husband and my 6 yr old.

We all have our "first time" stories, but this is mine! I love this recipe! I made as written with the addition of 1 tbsp chopped fresh garlic, 1tsp mustard seed , 1 tsp celery seed, 1 tsp turmeric and only 1 tsp salt. Let it sit on the counter for 2 hrs then packed in two peanut butter size jars and put in fridge. In a week they were great and in a month were fabulous. Next I have to try canning them! Addition: As I have made this many more times, you don't have to boil the sugar mix for just a minute or two, until the sugar is dissolved. As the cucumber mix cools, liquid from the cucumbers makes enough to cover the cucumbers.

Super easy and very tasty.  As others did I reduced the sugar, using 1 1/2 cups.  I added the T of mustard seed and t of celery seed before boiling.  The liquid was the right amount as after sitting in the bowl for an hour or so it was quite juicy.   I found it makes about 4 pints (if they last long enough to get in the jars)

These were just like I remember my Great-Grandmother making when I was a kid.  I put in the green peppers this time, but didn't like them, so I won't do it next time.  But the cucumbers were sweet and delicious.

Wow!  Way too sweet!  After reading the reviews I cut the sugar back by half!  I can't eat more than one so I KNOW I will not get through 5 jars of these before they go bad.  My husband won't probably like them either.  They aren't awful, just something I can't eat a lot of.   Thanks goodness I added a lot of red pepper flakes and some pickling spice to the vinegar, which probably helped cut a little sweetness....

Very good and easy recipe.  We love these and we can keep these pickles in the fridge until Christmas (from fresh cucumbers).  I make a 2 gallon batch every late summer and put them in the 2nd fridge.   MMMMM

I added onions and jalapeno peppers to these. I thought it would give the pickles a sweet hot taste but it really didn't. All in all, not a bad pickle and really easy to make.

Zucchini growers, celebrate!! Here's a solution to the over-abundance of zucchini. I made my first batch with small zucchini just to get ahead of the onslaught from the garden. They were terrific, and were a hit at the potluck at work. The second batch was half cucumber, half zucchini. To be honest, I like the texture of the zucchini better than the cucumber, and I can't taste the difference. However, the zucchini definitely smell like zucchini while they are soaking in the brine, so give them overnight to season. I've canned two batches of these, making three full pints each time, with some left over for snacking. If you plan to can some, I would suggest making just a bit more brine with 1/4 c vinegar and 1/2 c sugar to make sure you have enough liquid to fill the jars to the top.  Addition: If you use the pickling solution and minced onion, you get a terrific onion relish. It is the best ever on hotdogs and brats!

Lost this recipe a few years ago.  When I saw this, I knew it was the one I had.  I also added one tsp. of celery seed.  Once you start to eat them, you won't want to stop! Everyone who eats them will be requesting a copy of this recipe, I guarantee it.

Wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe.  I made several different jars, one with jalapeno peppers and red chili flakes in it, another with balsomic vinegar.  I too left out sugar.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I made this recipe 3 different times, as I had so many cucumbers coming in at at once. It was a big hit in my house. I added extra liquid and celery seed. Wonderful recipe...I will continue to use this recipe again....

I tried this recipe for my first attempt at making pickles w/ the cucumbers from my garden last summer.
This recipe is so easy and yummy!
I've been making them all winter w/ store bought cucumbers too.
I also add extra vinegar to this recipe.

We like these pickles.  I recommend packing the vegtables tightly into the jars, then adding the premixed liquid.  The vegtables will shrink.

I LOVE this recipe. I did modify mine quite  bit. I pickles green tomatoes. I don't really like onions so, I added a whole garlic, some fresh dill, one sliced Jalapeno, and just one cup of sugar. They were tart, sweet, and had a kick, and super crunchy. I also left them in the back of my fridge for a week.

I have tried this recipe and its amazing. I thin sliced my cucumbers and added 2 cloves of garlic and 2 thin slices of ginger to give them a little more zest. Also The longer you let them sit the better they get. This is a stand by for any of my dinner parties.

I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar back to about 1/4 cup.  These were excellent!  My husband and my son LOVED them.  I enjoyed them when I first tried them (after 2-3 days), when I had them again they were too sweet (after 6-7 days).  They are begging me to make them again!

Reminds me of pickles from grandma as a kid.  I read some of the other reviews, and made the following changes:  1. Used Truvia sweetener at 1/2 the amount for the sugar.  2. I added 4 cloves crushed/chopped garlic  3.  Used sweet banana peppers instead of green.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  Great on sandwiches.!

Wow! Even after sitting in the fridge for just an hour or so, these are already delicious!  I halved the sugar (actually, used a bit less than half), as I don't like super sweet pickles, and they are a perfect balance between sweet and tangy.  I added some peppercorns, dried dill and celery seed to the mix, as well as a couple sliced pepperoncini peppers from my garden and red bell pepper for color.  Beautiful to look at, delicious and oh so easy!  UPDATE:  These just keep getting better and better as they sit in the fridge!

Easy recipe and great way to use to the garden cukes in addition to making dill pickles.  My family loves these.  I did add the mustard seed and celery seed recommended by several reviewers so I'm basing my rec/review on those 2 additional ingredients.

These were good. I decided to cut the recipe in half. I was still worried about 32 servings, but strangely it came out to be about 2-3 servings with half the recipe so something isn't correct on the servings part. Unlike a cucumber salad, the cucumbers really can't be peeled or they will get soggy. I tried that by using garden tomatoes and that happened. I would go with a seedless style cucumber and definitely not peel it. To make it quicker I just microwaved the liquid part, let it cool slightly, and then poured it on the vegetables. I may try this again with a different style cucumber to see if they stay crunchy.

This was the 2nd recipe I have tried and it is terrific.  There is no dill in the recipe, so don't look for that flavor, but its a great combination of both savory and sweet.  It leans on the sweet side, but NOT like a sweet pickle from the store at all.  Delicious and easy!!

It was actually a little hard to find a lot of recipes online for refrigerator pickles, so I went with this one.    I  did make quite a few changes:  I used small whole cucumbers (not sliced), I left the sugar out, I added 1 tsp celery seeds, 1 tsp mustard seeds, a few whole black peppers, a few whole all spice and whole cloves to the brine.  I also added a sprig of fresh dill to each jar while stuffing the jar. I did add 2 garlic cloves to one jar even though I was kind of afraid of the "BLUE Garlic" thing happening (i think that happened because of the sugar).  I ended up with 2 quarts of pickles.  However, even after doubling the recipe I still didn't have enough brine.  I just combined a little vinegar with water and topped it off.  Well see how they turn out!  Thanks!

The Result: 24 hours later I tried my first pickle and WOW it tastes great! It was a slight shock because it was quite a bit more tangy/vigegary than store bought dill pickles, but I actually love that part.  I think if I had actually added the sugar it would tone down the vinegar.  Maybe next time I'll just add a few tablespoons of sugar.  Nevertheless, these are GREAT and SUPER crunchy! Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and delicious!  And without the usual 10-day wait, which is an added bonus.  This time, I halved the sugar and replaced it with Splenda, since hubby is diabetic and I'm borderline.  I'm sure going all Splenda would be fine too.  Used cider vinegar because I prefer the taste of it to white.  No green peppers this time--only because I didn't have room for anything more in the jars!!

I only had one cucumber on hand but wanted some pickles, so I used this recipe. I only added one cup of sugar. No onions or peppers. But I did add a few shakes of dill and celery seeds, and a couple black pepper corns...yummo!

Good! I did skip the onions and I used jalapenos instead of the green peppers. A little too sweet, but good. Thanks!

I was looking for something simple to make pickles for the first time.  I loved this recipe.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes, some celery seed, and mustard seed and then I decided to can it so I water bathed it for 10 minutes.  I double checked with my canning book because I wasn't sure on how long...I found two similar recipes with cukes, onion, and pepper and one processed for 10 minutes and the other for 15 minutes.  I will be making these again this week!  Thank you Redlass!

They were great! We made them with cucumbers from a friends garden, they were awesome.   Also, we microwaved the vinegar and sugar and salt and it turned out fine!

I made these last night & they turned out perfect! 5 STARS:)
I did make a few changes though. I have 4 small children, so i peeled the cucumbers. I also left out the other things..onions, bell peppers..because i was in a hurry. Next time though, i will try it w/ those things!
They were so good that my kids ate 2 whole jars full!!!

this rescipe is very easy, we had planted pickling cucumbers this year, and the kids picked them and sliced them and we made these pickles.  They are ready to eat the next day.  I gave a jar to someone at work, who said her and her husband ate the whole jar at once.

I've been making these all summer after a bumper crop of cucumbers.  I've given away countless jars and everybody loves them, even people who don't like cucumbers.  I've reduced the sugar in half in some recipes and they still taste great.  If you like more of a dill flavor, you can add a teaspoon or so of dill or add red pepper flakes if you like them a little on the spicy side.  The possibilities are endless with his recipe.  Just wish I could make them last longer.

These were my husband's favorite refrigerator pickles so far. I reduced the sugar a little (1.5 cups) and will probably reduce a bit more on the next batch. I also added 1 tsp of celery seed.

I have made this recipe twice.  It is so easy and the taste is fantastic!  Both times I have added habanero slices to give them some heat.  I did use two pieces of garlic just because I like the flavor.  (Mine didn't turn blue).  I love the sweet with a little heat.  The only problem is, once you start eating them you can't stop!

Easy and delicious!  I used 3 cucumbers, 1 whole onion, and 1 whole green pepper, which meant I had more veggies than brine, so next time, I'll probably double the vinegar/salt/sugar amounts.  I filled three pickle jars and only had a little left over (little enough for a guilt-free snack!).  QUESTION:  what is up with the "sterile containers"?  I gathered pickle jars I'd been saving (and which had been through the dishwasher once) along with a pickle jar I just pulled from the fridge (dumping the existing pickles into Tupperware).  Is that generally all right to do?  Seems so, but I've never followed a recipe which required "sterile containers" before.

Just made these and I love them!  I used only 1 cup sugar because I thought 2 cups would be too sweet. I also added celery seasoning and left out the green pepper.  Great way to use up the cucumbers from the garden.

These pickles are habit forming! Soooo goood!! I peeled the mini cukes so they looked striped. Lovely. Added more sweet onion, red bell pepper because they are sweeter tasting, 2 cups of white vinegar and 1 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon celery seed, 1 teaspoon mustard seed, 1/2 teaspoon peppercorn melange and 1/2 teaspoon turmeric. I put them in 2 xtra large jars so they had room for the liquid that forms. Delicious! So easy to make! A keeper!

To the person that had blue garlic.  If you want to add galic to one of these recipes you should boil the garlic with your brine for a short time.  It will stop it from turning blue.  Also it is safe to eat the blue garlic.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the lead of another reviewer and added mustard and celery seed, and threw some dried hot peppers into the liquid. The sweet heat is amazingly addictive. Keeper!

I made a version of this recipe: striped my cucumbers & used 8 - 10 cups, added a tablespoon celery seed. EASY & SO DELICIOUS! Now my son wants me to add some heat, so I'm going to put some in a jar with a little red pepper. I'll let you know. For now they're very sweet, but I like that.

Excellent,  
Cut the sugar in half, made a tangy with a little bit of sweet pickle.  Also added 1 TBS of pickling spice and one dry Thai pepper. Will be making more fo sho!!!!  Use 2 quart jars, two lbs of cucumbers.  Left out the green pepper.

oh yum yum yummy, recipe doesn't call for garlic...I doubt anyone would want garlic in a sweet pickle, that is for sour pickles. But I added celery seeds to the rest of the ingredients.

Mine have not set for four days yet but I am really liking the samples. I added jalapeño (the ones you buy in a jar) just a little zing.

Super simple and tasty. It is really an easy basic recipe that you can put additions in to change the flavors as you see fit. What a perfect way to use all those cucumbers in the garden.

I like making these pickles, and I also like mine spicy so I add hot peppers and peppercorns to the mix as well as dill weed to make them sing!  This is a nice recipe to take to pot lucks dinners because no one else will bring home made pickles.

I am giving 5 stars because of my husband liking these so much. I found them to be too sweet and not what I like for pickles.  When I made them and told my husband they were sweet pickles he sort of grimaced and said I don't like sweet pickles.  He then proceeded to take all 5 pint jars I made to work over the next two weeks and is now asking for more. (yes he is eating them, his co-workers tell me he very rarely shares these)  Pickles truly are what an individual prefers. I say give it a try you may find you like it even though you don't like store bought sweet pickles.

Super recipe...especially for first time pickle makers. Just a couple notes...only use the amount of liquid noted in recipe because the pickles will become smaller in size...and you can eat them after a couple hrs in the fridge

As written this was entirely too sweet and I like sweet pickles. 4 stars since I rate as written.   So the second time around I cut the sugar in half and it was the sweetness I like. 5 stars (according to our taste) made this way.  I have also added onions and some hot chile pepper and it tastes like the cucumber salad they serve at Thai Restaurants. Thanks for sharing.

I made these today with the following substitutions:  - One a half times the salt and vinegar - Added celery seed and dill weed - Used 1/2 cup green peppers and 1/2 cup yellow  I think that it's helpful to know that I I had two long seedless cucumbers and four baby "pickle" cucumbers.  I cut the little ones into spears and used my mandelin to slice the long ones.  I only used TWO bell mason jars and was somehow able to shove all those pickles/peppers/onions in.  I was REALLY nervous that I wouldn't have enough juice (even with the increasing the vinegar) but I had exactly enough liquid to fill right to the top!  Next time I'm going to add mustard seed I just didn't have any - uggh.  Anywho, these were really good and super easy!  Although everyone in the house complained about the smell they all loved the taste when they were done!

These were pretty good but way too sweet.  Next time I would probably cut the sugar by half.  I added some thai peppers and red pepper flakes which gave them a nice spice.

I made these pickles, but when i canned them there wasn't any juice for all the jars.  Isn't the juice suppose to cover up the pickles in all the jars.  Anyways, I cover them with vinegar and added some sugar.  I hope they will taste ok.  I will let you know.

My husband made this recipe, and we added some red roasted bell peppers, 2 cloves of garlic, and doubled the 'pickling' liquid. We let it stand for a couple of hours and then bottled the mix. We left it to mature in the fridge for 3 days. It is delicious! Tasty and crunchy!

I love these pickles and so does my husband, which is picky. I leave out the peppers cause I don't care for them. Will differently make again.

I used white wine vinegar, I didn’t have any white vinegar. I used less sugar they came out awesome! Reminds me of bread and butter pickles with the white wine vinegar.  I can’t wait to make more! Such a simple yummy recipe.

The pickles don’t really taste like pickles, they just taste like really sweet cucumbers no matter how long they sit in the jar. I added spices to the pickles and they tasted much better. I recommend the sweet pickles recipe, I still think they were really tasty.

Easy and quick. This technique keeps the good probiotics. I use it as a base recipe and add other flavors. This year I added fresh dill, peppercorns, and garlic cloves.

Super easy base pickle recipe. I throw in a chopped red pepper, 3 small yellow peppers, 2 celery stocks, 2 habanero peppers, half an onion, mustard seed and some turmeric powder to make it more of a bread and butter taste yet has some heat.

LOVE THIS RECIPE.. but all the refrigerator pickle recipes I have ever used call for X-AMOUNT OF  DAYS that they should sit in the frige before eating.  there is no instructions for this. I left them sit for 2 weeks,, as that's what I have used in the other recipes, and they were perfect!  great recipe!.. ps.. I DID NOT add garlic either and had no problem

Wonderful!  Just what I was looking for to use as hot dog/sandwich relish, garnish for peas or other vegetables.  I added some chopped seeded jalapenos to half my batch, and it flavored the pickles nicely with just a little added heat.  Everybody loves these pickles.

I made  about 10 quarts of these pickles and gave a few to family and they loved them.  They were easy to make and simple. All cucumbers came from my garden.

My whole family loves these pickles and it's great to have a recipe to use right away. These stay so nice and crisp! I used only half the sugar though, they were way too sweet for us! I also don't bother with the peppers- my family doesn't like them and they are not ripe yet- would probably be good, especially if  let go red for some pretty color contrast.

This is it!!! I will never have to search for a refrigerator pickles recipe again. I followed the recipe, but scaled it down using the tool provided for two cucumbers. I cut the sugar in half as recommend in a lot of the other reviews. Absolutely delicious. I don't think these will last 24 hours in my house!

I made this with an English cucumber that I didn't want to eat yet and didn't want to waste.  I don't buy or eat pickles because they are not my favorite food.  But I didn't want to loose the cucumber so I gave it a shot.  I made 1/2 the recipe and I have to say, the recipe as given is perfect and this is the 1st pickle that I actually enjoy eating.  I could literally sit down with the jar and a fork and go to town on these.  I changed nothing in the recipe.

My picky hubby loves them and they are so darn easy to make.
The 1st time I made them I did not have any white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar and I forgot to put the bell pepper in the jars.... It was a hectic day lol. They were still amazing. I sometimes add a few red pepper chili flakes, but the recipe is good just as it's written. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us

Thanks for the recipe!  I like a recipe that can be tweaked to individual taste.  We like lightly seasoned food.  The sugar was reduced to 1 cup plus a 1 tbsp.  Only a tsp of minced sweet onion and orange bell pepper.  3 tsp pickling spice plus 1/4 tsp dill seed.  Reduced the salt to 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp. Increased the vinegar to 1 1/2 cups.  1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp water.  1 pound of pickling cucumbers were used. It was my first time making pickles and these turned out great!  More flavor than the national brand I always used.

I made a few changes because I did not have celery seed in my pantry.   I added a small amount of pickle juice  from a jar of pickles I  had from the grocery store.  Came out tasting great.

I added the celery and mustard seeds. So easy to make and they are delicious. With an influx of cucumbers this year I will be making lots more to give away. This was my first attempt to pickle and it won’t be my last. Thank you for this great recipe.

These are really good.  I let the brine cool before adding to the cucumbers and onions so that they didn't cook and soften.  After I sampled the mixture a day later, they were a little too sweet and "oniony" for my taste, so  I added an additional cup of vinegar to the mix; a couple of hours later, they were just right.  Next time, I'll only use 1 cup sugar, and either use a sweet onion or cut the onion to 2/3 cup, as well.

Wonderful Recipe!  I’m making double batches and decreased the white sugar from 4 cups to 3.  Adding color with a mix of red, orange, yellow, and green peppers.  This recipe is a keeper and sure to be s craving too!

So far so good!  Taste before its time..  I had to make another 1/2 of the brine to cover pickles.  I am bringing them in to work to share so I will give an update on how everyone liked or would make a change. I also added celery seed.

Great pickles! I used Apple cider vinegar and added the mustard seeds and celery seeds as many of the other reviewers did. Everyone who has tried the pickles asked for the recipe.

I tried this with pickling cucumbers cut into circles that were a little thicker than some recommended in hope they will retain their crunch a bit longer.  I also added red and yellow sweet pepper slices for a bit of color as well as the suggested 1tsp celery seed and 1tbl mustard seed.  Can't wait to try them in a few days!

This is the BEST and EASIEST recipe for pickles. I use this same juice for pickled jalapeños—-oh so good! In fact, this juice is great for pickling whatever vegetable you’d like. I sometimes slice carrots to put in the pickles. It all tastes great on a sandwich.

In response to the review about the garlic..  Natural sulfur in the garlic interacts with the vinegar.  The resulting blue/green garlic is perfectly natural and safe!

This recipe is a HIT! Even my family members who don’t like pickles absolutely love these!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added mustard seed and celery seed but also added dill seed and dill weed and used red, yellow and orange bell peppers. DELICIOUS! So addictive. Awesome recipe!!

I have made this recipe numerous times now and it is the perfect stepping point to customize your way. It truly is good just the way it is but even better when you start adding your things to it. I ALWAYS add dried dill to mine and it's awesome.

3.26.18  Used my mandolin to slice the cukes and onions, and I omitted the green bell pepper, since we’re not fans.  Two cups of sugar seemed excessive to me, so I reduced the amount (and I sub’d Truvia®) to suit our taste preference.  The brine seemed too vinegar-y, so I did add a little water to mellow it out a bit.  I’ll do an update in a couple days if things change, but at this point, there’s not enough liquid to cover all of the pickles, I’m assuming that the cukes will release water, so it may not be an issue, although the recipe doesn’t state to wait a few days. ***UPDATE 3.27.18****  If you're concerned about not having enough liquid to cover the pickles, don't be.  By the end of the day, the cukes had softened, released liquid, and all pickles and onions were covered...and they'e still crunchy!

Great and simple way to pickle veggies.  I did not use the amount of sugar suggested, but simply a tablespoon of sugar to take the acidic taste to a minimum. Otherwise nice and crunchy. Oh, I did add some spicey chili peppers to give them a little more zing. This is a keeper.

These were great!  I didn't have a pepper so skipped that part.  I was really worried there wasn't going to be enough liquid as it didn't come near to covering my cukes but after sitting all night they are covered and taste great!

I halved the recipe and only used a half cup of sugar.  We didn't have green peppers, so those were left out. We loved them! My husband wants me to use even less sugar next time since they were pretty sweet. I was able to slice more cucumber into the sauce after we ate them all and that was good too.

These pickles tasted good, I just thought they tasted more like a cucumber salad than actual Bread and Butter pickles. I might try them again but just tweak the amount of sugar.

I also added tumeric, and these were wonderful!  Great way to use extra cucumbers from the garden!

Super easy added minced garlic and a dash of pepper.  Only thing I have a question about.  Are they ready next day or how long should I let them sit before they are officially "pickled"

I thought it could use a little less sugar, my boyfriend thinks it's perfect.  It states not to overfill it, I'd fill it to the top with the vegetables because the liquids really take over after a couple hours of sitting.

Love this recipe. So easy and delicious. I had an abundance of cucumbers all at once so tried this recipe and I'm about to make another batch. Only change was to cut the sugar in half and then I processed the jars to keep longer. Not sure they'll last that long though.

Excellent recipe.  I did omit the bell peppers and cut sugar in half. I also added the celery seed and mustard seed as 1 person suggested. I added crushed garlic.  I do put them in a very large tupperware bowl overnight before canning. I think this helps release the natural juice and you end up with more brine. (This is only my take on it). I made these and gave several jars away to friends. Everyone wants more and they didn't even wait the 2 weeks!. Great recipe!!

Never made pickles before. had a bunch of leftover cucumbers from my garden so I gave this (and a couple other recipes) a try. I found the amount of sugar in this recipe completely overbearing. I like dill pickles, tart and vinegary.  I had to throw these out. Other reviewers seem to like them, but definitely not my taste.

Uncomplicated and delicious!  Made two large jars of pickles using this recipe and some of the other reviewers suggestions.  Reduced sugar slightly, added red & green pepper ( just because I had it) added some mustard seed and celery seed.  My husband has declared this recipe "a keeper".  He is eating these cukes like a salad & putting them on nearly any kind of sandwich he puts together.  Thanks for sharing!

There should have been a warning in here somewhere that these are like bread&butter pickles.  I followed other recommendations and used half the sugar but they're still really sweet.

Made these pickles with fresh cucumbers from our garden! So easy! And delish! I added celery seed and a tad more vinegar to my halved recipe. Would have added some mustard seed, too, but we didn't have any. Read many reviews, and next time will also add red dell pepper for color!  Thank you for a great recipe. Will be making again, soon!

Very good. I reduced the sugar by half and still found them to be nicely sweet. Fresh and easy to make. The addition of celery seed and mustard seed that many have suggested was also good. Next time I'm going to try just 1/2 cup of sugar.

These pickles are to die for and the easiest I have ever made! I also added the mustard seed and celery seed and eliminated the bell peppers because I don't like them. In addition I processed these in my canning pot and put up 14 pint jars. I am making more tomorrow to give to all my kids?? If you decide to process them for longer keeping I processed the filled jars in the boiling water for 30 minutes then took them out to cool on a butcher block.

First time making pickles and was a bit unsure but I followed this recipe to a T and they turned out great.  I can't believe how much better these were than the store-bought ones; my family devoured them with meals and as snacks.

Super easy and tasty. I added 1T of celery seed, 1T yellow mustard seed and 1T of brown mustard seed. Also, my husband and I are not fans of green bell peppers so I put in red, the color looks nice and tastes good too.

Wasn't sure to expect just pickles or sweet pickles. I didn't use green pepper, instead used fresh jalapeño rings. If you like sweet & spicy, this is fabulous. Overall a great recipe that I will continue using. Great flavors. Thanks for sharing:)

These are delicious!!!! The green pepper really adds something but just a hint of flavor, can't really taste "green pepper" but its a very nice addition to the typical cucumber/onion recipes I've used before- SUPER! AND so so easy, ready to eat in 24 hours!  Hint: after you pour brine over cucumbers, allow to settle for about 15 min as they will shrink a bit, then pack in jars.

If ones garlic turns "blue" it is because one has used table salt instead of pickling salt.  Pickling Salt will not turn garlic blue as it doesn't contain iodine as does table salt.  When pickling use PICKLING SALT.

Slice the cucumbers and pack them in jars.  Add 1 clove of garlic and 2 big pinches of dill weed to each jar.
Now make brine:  3 cups of vinegar, 2 cups of water, and a scant ¼ cup of salt.  You don’t have to heat; just stir it up ‘til the salt dissolves.
Pour it over the cukes and seal ‘em up.
Put ‘em in the icebox and they’re ready in a few days.

I cut the sugar and a half. Still too sweet for my taste, but my kids absolutely love them. The onions were delicious on sandwiches.

Yum! Yum! Yum! I like my pickles tart so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, but when I make them again tommorow, I will use 1/2 cup. I left out the green pepper just because I don't really care for them, but did add the onions which made it super yummy! This recipe is definately a keeper!

These pickles were great.  My daughter loved them and ate a whole jar by herself.  I found them very easy to make (first time making pickles).  I made these last summer and just dug out the recipe to make them again.  I am going to cut back on the sugar this time just because I don't like things as sweet as my daughter does, but I think the recipe is fine as it is and if you like sweet pickles, then you should be happy you made these!

Love this recipe! I substituted Stevia for the sugar and only used one cup. I also used red and green peppers, red onions and a tablespoon of pickling spice. The pickles come out great!

I know taste is quite subjective, but these are just too sour and salty compared to other quick pickles.  Cut the vinegar and salt down to 2/3 strength similar to other recipes.

I made it just as it reads It turn out great. Even my daughter who not a pickle fan loves them. I used the slicing blade on my food prosier on pickles, green peppers and onions to get thin pieces. If you want to spice them up a little, add a teaspoon or so of chili flakes. This is my new pickle recipe.

I love this recipe for pickles. I didn't have the peppers on hand, so I didn't add them, but I did add a few peppercorns (not sure if it made any difference). Absolutely delicious. My whole family is now addicted. Thanks!

I made these over a three-weekend period of time - as the cucumbers got ready, etc.  My lifesaver was a new mandolin I bought on which to slice the veggies.  I have given many jars to my work friends and employer.  I put red pepper flakes in mine and also some chopped garlic and sliced banana peppers - and everybody loves them.  I have some in the frig that are getting to be a month old - the vinegar is getting a little cloudy and they need to be used up. SO, next year I'm going the whole canning route so that they will last longer.  The recipe is wonderful and makes a beautiful looking jar.

I cut the sugar as some suggested, and was quite happy with the results ( if you're more into a sweeter bread & butter type pickle). Next time I will cut it even more and up the dill to see if it tastes more like a Dill pickle. Love that it's super easy!

These are fabulous pickles and so easy to make! I'm not a fan of sweet pickles/relishes so when I saw how much sugar was used I felt I needed to tweak the recipe a little like everyone else, adding fresh dill and a handful of generic pickling spice mix from my pantry... I used three gigantic English cucumbers to make 6 cups, a Walla Walla sweet onion, yellow bell pepper for color and since I'm a fan of Alton Brown's "Firecrackers" I tossed in some thin-sliced baby carrots as well-- for some stupid reason (probably fearing the results) I waited four days before opening the first jar and now I can't stop eating these!!

Loved these pickles.   If you follow the original recipe, and don't start adding other ingredients, the pickles are perfect.

This recipe is easy and the pickles taste wonderful! I have never canned pickles before, and I was able to follow this recipe easily and the pickles turned out great! They are a hit with the whole family, and one of the best parts is that you can be done with the whole process (including clean up) in less than one hour!! I will definitely make these again this year!

I am afraid 'Weird Aunt Martha' was aptly named. She either adds additional ingredients and THEN complains when the recipe fails, OR she imagines the appearance of 'blue garlic' in the pickles (when there is no garlic at all in the recipe). I have a feeling 'Weird Aunt Martha' is still having acid flashbacks from her hazy daze at Berkley in the 70's. Sheeeeesh.

I was very pleased with the outcome. I sliced, julienned and actually used an apple peeler on the cucumbers to vary their shapes. It all worked. Flavor was wonderful, even if it was a tad sweet for my taste.

Re garlic turning blue - that is not an unusual reaction with dill pickles - has something to do with the vinegar leeching some of the color out of the cucumbers which turns the garlic blue. It's completely harmless and doesn't affect flavor at all.

these are quite good pickles. I changed a few things. I added some red bell pepper slices, and a bit of both celery seed, and mustard seed. I like that you can just add more cucumbers,to the liquid. very good.

I was trying to use up the cucumbers from the garden (had a lot of them this year).  Made this recipe and as others suggested, reduced the amount of sugar by half.  They certainly are easy to make and are tasty.

Delicious and EASY!!!  Perfect for using up the few cucumbers I couldn't pickle and can.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe; per other's advice, I also increased sugar/vinegar amounts as I also like more brine.  Packed the cucumbers in quart jars, and after sitting over night they reduced to around a pint!

We LOVE these! And everywhere we take them, we get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I have always liked the cuke salads like this, but this is the easiest, tastiest version ever!  I don't add the peppers, but keep the pickling exactly the same.

I made pickles before and this recipe was so different then the one I had so I had to try it. It was quick and easy. They taste great, my kids are putting them in baggies and eating them. I doubled the recipe so I would have a lot but I don't think it will last with my kids. Love it!!

This has been a very good year for cucumbers and I wanted an easy recipe for pickles.  Easy it was.    I sliced the cukes and onion and put them in two quart jars.  I left out the green pepper because they are so expensive.  I also reduced the salt by half.  I let the vinegar mixture cool slightly and poured it in the jars and realized I didn't have enough liquid so I boiled another batch of vinegar and sugar.  A double batch filled two jars nicely.    The pickles taste very good but they are limp.  No crunch at all.  Wonder why?  Could it be that I used only half the salt?  Or that I didn't mix everything in a large bowl?    I saved the liquid from one jar and will boil it and try again.  Next time I will use a green pepper and add dill to the jar.  I will also eat them immediately.

We made these one Sunday morning in just a few minutes. Our first attempt at pickles. Everyone loved them!! Definitely easy and taste fabulous. We used only onions and cucumbers because we had not bell peppers.  Turned out great!

I thought these were good, but a little too sweet for my taste. These are more like Bread and Butter pickles. My son loved them, so I will probably make them for him, but will use less sugar when we make them for my husband and I.
