I don't normally keep ice cream in the house so I used two extra spoonfuls of Stacy's organic vanilla yogurt. I didn't add the extra sugar, used fat free milk and I used my own homemade chocolate syrup. The kids thought this was great.

Pretty tasty.  I threw in a small handful of chocolate chips during the last few moments of blending, but it still could use more chocolate flavor.  Skipped the sugar and added milk to make it my desired thickness.  Will make again and increase the chocolate!

I thought this tasted pretty good. At first sip, it tasted a bit tart, but the more I drank it the more I liked it. It mostly tasted like strawberry frozen yogurt with bananas. I couldn't really taste the chocolate. Only changes I made was using 1/2  the fat vanilla ice cream, 1% milk, and a packet of Truvia for the sugar. I also only had about 6oz of yogurt, but it was more than plenty. This is definitely closer to a frozen yogurt shake or drink than a smoothie, but I wanted something like that anyway. TY

This smoothie is amazing! I was a little hesitant about the chocolate syrup, but you can't really taste it. I'm a huge fan of strawberry smoothies and this was one of the first recipes I tried and is still my favorite!
