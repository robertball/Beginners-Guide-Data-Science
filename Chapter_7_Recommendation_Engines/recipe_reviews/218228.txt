This is one of our favorite breakfasts. I like it because it's so simple and the family likes it because they get bacon and eggs on a pizza. This works with pretty much anything you want to throw on it and if you have crescent roll dough, that works for a good "crust", too. Just lay it out on the baking sheet like the recipe states, pinching together the seams, and bake for 12-15 minutes. My husband and kids like their breakfast pizza with bacon AND sausage but I like mine with a mix of veggies, like red pepper, red onion, mushrooms, black olives and jalapenos! This recipe is always a winner, no matter what you want to put on it AND if you coupon, it costs you next to nothing for the biscuits/crescent rolls. NOTE: Very important. If you have cranky pans, you might want to squirt a little non stick spray on your pans before you lay out your dough, otherwise you might have an issue getting your pizza out of your pan. I learned this the hard way.

Awesome, was a big hit this morning.  Even the pickiest of kids loved it. Followed directions to a T.  Might try it sometime with some sausage gravy over the top of it or either under/over the eggs.

Made this for my husband on father's day. Used crescent rolls because I had them on hand.  He raved about it! My kids loved helping out in the kitchen and it would be great with any combo of toppings. I can't wait to make it again! Yum!

I THOUGHT THIS SOUNDED A LITTLE DRY SO I MADE CREAM GRAVY TO SPREAD OVER THE BISCIUTS AND THEN TOPPED WITH EGGS, BACON, HASH BROWNS AND CHEESE. TURNED OUT GREAT. I'VE MADE IT A FEW TIMES AND MY HUSBAND LOOOVES IT :)

Oh, my, gosh!  I can't believe people would actually rate a recipe low because the picture didn't match the recipe directions!  People!  There are 7 photos submitted by different people who put their own spin on the recipe and submitted a picture.  They are all different!  If you don't like the looks of one, click on it and find another! As to the recipe, I made my own crust-it is so simple and doesn't contain all the weird stuff in pre-made stuff.  I did make some gravy out of the sausage I added and put it on a partially baked crust.  I did it because my husband loves biscuits and gravy and thought he'd like it better that way.  He said it reminded him a little of a breakfast bowl he had at a restaurant.

Those are interesting scrambled eggs in the picture, when I make this I do not scramble them but just break the eggs in a shallow pit pre-pressed in the crust, so they stay in a small area, and bake in the oven until they are set.  Also add any other additional toppings as your tastes desire, as you would to a regular pizza.

For a gluten free option, preshredded hashbrowns, thawed with butter, pressed into a pizza pan and baked for about 20 min at 400 degrees works great!  Season the eggs....I used parsley, cayenne, salt and pepper and sharp cheddar cheese.

Best way to spice up breakfast! I though cut it in half..  What the recipe calls for is a huge amount. and after about 4 or so days it is quite gross. also add a little salt and pepper to the eggs along with cheese. it gives it a little more oomph in my opinion

This came out pretty good.  The only change I would make is to cook the biscuits a bit longer.  The center was a bit undercooked even after cooking with the eggs on top.

5 stars for the recipe, but not the amounts of ingredients. Definitely need to tone it down a bit if you're using the 9x12, an entire onion is waaaay too much, as are most of the other ingredients. Other than that, add some hash browns between the rolls and eggs (make sure they're mostly cooked first), and this recipe is phenomenal.

Yummy!! We made this as "Breakfast for dinner" and my teenage daughters and their friends loved it. I made it last night for my husband, using diced deli ham, and again, it was a hit.

Enjoyed making this and it tasted great.  I only use four eggs and used pizza dough from grocery. I used all the same ingredients in the recipe but it is like any pizza that you can just put on topping that you like.  I also did not scramble the eggs because I make quiche and fritattas and wanted a differnt taste.

I have made this several times and love how flexible it is.  I usually add some sort of cream gravy and whatever cheese or toppings I happen to have on hand.  It makes it like biscuits and gravy with cheesy eggs all wrapped up into one!

I love this stuff! I've made it several times, and everybody comes back for seconds. I'm kinda lazy on Saturday mornings so I used a store bought pizza crust. I also did like another reviewer did and pushed out circles in the dough and just cracked the eggs in them. Baked at 350 for 20 mins. Great breakfast!

I liked this recipe...it has good texture with the onions and bell peppers. I had to use less biscuits than it called for to keep it from being too bready but it is tasty.

Really good! Looking for something different to make, this was it! I've had breakfast pizzas before but never made one myself. It's simple but a little time consuming pre cooking everything, bacon, sausage, fried onions & peppers, eggs, biscuits, but it's worth it! Will be making for weekend breakfasts again! :)

We liked the idea of presenting the same old breakfast food in a new and creative way. Since my family loves anything with runny egg yolk, I did make a small change: I put scrambled egg on the biscuit dough as directed, but I also cracked 4 eggs onto the top of the pizza to bake. The runny yolks really helped prevent a pizza that was too dry. We liked it, but overall, it was just OK for us.

I made this today for a Valentines Day Brunch for our family.   It was so easy to make and it came out great.  Everyone loved it and was impressed with "dad's" creation.  I would highly recommend it for a brunch dish and would be great to bring to a friend's and heat up there.  Thanks to Original Recipe poster!

This was great!  I precooked the bacon, scrambled the eggs and partially baked the ‘crust’ the night before an early flight.   I assembled it all on the baking sheet with parchment paper in the morning and stuck it in the oven and it was ready to go by the time I was!  The family loved it and I loved that they got a hot breakfast and I had no pans or dishes to do on a hectic morning!  I will definitely make again and again!

i love this recipe! but it seemed a bit too dry for our taste, so i read the reviews and used a white sauce, biscuit gravy, put on the semi-cooked biscuits, then topped with bacon, cooked onions, scrambled eggs and shredded cheddar cheese. what a great way to start the day..  i also cooked the "crust " the night before, as suggested by cook, and saves time and prep in the AM. thanx for a great new breakfast fave!

I made this with my 4 year old granddaughter.  We used a 10 inch Pyrex pie pan, 6 biscuits, and 6  eggs.  We made it to our taste with a layer of cheese, then  scrambled eggs very soft set,  bacon, and shredded cheese.  Topped it with snipped chives when it was out of the oven.  I did  both bakes on the middle shelf at 400.   I think next time I will pat the biscuits thinner and do the first bake longer.  I would prefer the crust less doughy.  Kids and adults were very happy and I can see lots of variations in the future.  It  will serve 4 adults.

Biscuits!  What a great idea for the crust.  Of course, any pre-prepared dough would work and be a time saver.   Sausage, ham, prosciutto are good bacon substitutes if bacon just isn't your thing...which I just can't imagine.... you really want a soft scramble on the eggs or they will be like eating flubber after being in the oven.  If you want whole eggs, you will have to add some sort of sauce to the dough, such as a hollandaise.  Sprinkle the onion, pepper, meat, and cheese on top of the sauce, then break whole eggs on top, making a small well for each egg, before baking.

Loved it even though our sunny-side-up eggs were still a bit runny. will definitely make again and will try with scrambled eggs this time

Great recipe for beginners ish; I wish there were more details about how to spread the dough without so much effort- I had to pinch and spread often so there were no holes in the dough and perhaps I needed to make it thinner to get a crunchy crust, instead of biscuit consistency. Thank you for sharing.

This is the best thing ever, you can buy pizza dough in the dairy case premade, I've varied the recipe, using pepperoni, salami, bacon bits, or hamburger. Love the cheese.

The biscuit dough was still raw after cooking it for 3 times longer than it said, and everything else becomes horrible.

It was delicious didn't use the biscuits  that it called  for a used pizza dough that was in the biscuit aisle and I use Sunnyside eggs I baked it for about 20 minutes at 300- 350 so that the whites could get hard. We ate it for dinner and then for breakfast the next morning.
