I make this a lot. The only change I make is instead of the onion soup I use a pack of Lipton's Onion soup mix. (I add one can of water)
Delish!

I got so many compliments on and requests for this recipe!  I used half the amount of butter called for, low sodium broth, added some sauteed mushrooms and used half brown rice. Also, when it was time to remove the foil, I stirred everything again. It was delicious - thanks!

BRAVO!!! So simple to make and with such delicious results! I love it... mix it all in a pan and forget about it. It sounded too simple to be good, but I was wrong to think that. I used 1 can of Campbell's French Onion Soup and 1 can of low sodium beef broth. (There's plenty of sodium already from the Campbell's soup!) When I took the foil off for the last 30 minutes of baking, I added a cup of frozen peas and some chopped scallions. It was perfect. Not too watery and not sticky; just the exact right texture. This was WAY easier than my other fried rice recipes, and just as tasty! I will be making this one again for sure!

The first time I prepared this dish I found the taste to be a little flat.  So, the next time I made it I replaced the can of beef broth with a can of beef consome, and added a small can of mushrooms and a finely chopped onion.  It turned out much better.. enjoy.

Really great rice recipe.  I used Onion soup mix and added 1 cup of water instead of using the can of condensed French Onion Soup because I didn't have any.  I also added mushrooms like others suggested.  Yummy and really easy.

Delicious, even without changing a thing! This is an easy side dish that can really dress up a "plain meat" meal. Be sure to cover it tightly and for the full 30 minutes (or more) or you could get crunchy rice (which happened to me the first time I made it).

So my hubby and I liked this rice a lot.  "This is what I'm talking about" he said when he tasted it.  He likes the boxed rice and I won't buy them 'cause they're expensive.  I ended up changing the recipe quite a bit simply because I found it last minute and had to go with what was available.  I used a 14.5 oz can regular strength beef broth, 3/4 c. water, a package of dry onion soup mix, 2 T butter.  I added an extra 1/2 c. rice just based on personal preference-the amount of liquid in the original recipe seemed like a lot.  I had to cook it on the stove as the oven was in use.  Boiled the liquids, soup, and butter, added the rice and turned to medium-low for 15 minutes, then turned off the heat and let it rest for another 15 minutes.  I make all my white rice this way and it turns out great each time.  I don't usually change recipes like that right off the bat, but I had to this time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made.  I followed the instructions completely, except I only put it in for fifty minutes.  Even then it was REALLY burnt on top and the sides.  I think 35-40 minutes is more than enough.

Made this rice for dinner, we liked the flavor. I used one package of Lipton's dry Onion Soup, one can of Campbell's Beef Consume,  one can of water, and one cup of dry white long grain rice. I used the full 1/2 cup of butter but it ended up being much too oily for us. I will try using only 2 tablespoons of butter next time. I will also follow another reviewer's idea & add a cup of peas next time, maybe some fresh mushrooms, & some green onions chopped up & sprinkled on top. Maybe a bit of garlic powder too.

The first time I made this I did it exactly as instructed and it was really good. The second time, I just put everything in my rice cooker (used onion soup mix plus 1 cup water, 1 cup beef broth, 1 cup rice) and left out the butter. It turned out great that way too plus was less effort and took less time.

A very good, simple recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.  The only problem I had was that the top layer of rice got well done and the edges were crispy.  I didn't see anyone else mention a problem with the cooking time, so I may have to check my oven temp or it could possibly be the cook.  :)  I might try lowering the temp to 400 next time.

This was really great.  I heard some reviews which didn't make sense to me like this rice tastes like blah.  It made me wonder if they 1. actually put in the ingredients it states in the recipe and 2. did they stir everything up a little so all the french onion soup and beef broth gets into the rice and 3. did these people actually ever have french onion soup, because it does not taste like blah.

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't have the condensed can onion soup or the packets of dry soup on hand so I made my own substitution for the packet. I also wanted a 9x13 size for our large family so I doubled the rice amount totaling 2 cups of uncooked rice, added 2 cans of beef broth (mine were each 14 oz) Then for the onion soup substitute I mixed aside the following (this equals 2 packets worth): 

5 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon dried onion flakes 
3 teaspoons dried parsley 
2 teaspoon onion powder 
1 teaspoon celery seed 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon sugar 
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper 

I sprinkled this over the 9x13 rice mixture and added 1 more can of water.  Then I took 1/2 cup butter (didn't double this) and cut slices over top.  Baked for the same amount of time as listed.  Delish!

This rice is fantastic.  Everyone raved saying this was the ebst rice ever.  I couldn't find "condensed" french onion soup, so I used a can of Progresso French Onion Soup.  The recipe was great. My kids can't wait until I make it again!

My husband and I both loved this. For those of you who think it's to salty use unsalted butter next time. I'm going to use the leftover for chicken fried rice tomorrow night. Adding some egg and blacked chicken. Thanks for the recipe oh I also used the Lipton soup with 1 cup of water and added peas after I removed the foil.  BIG HIT

I loved this recipe, it was tasty and very easy to make.  But it seemed that when I was making it and even though my oven is very hot, that the rice didn't need a full hour, after a half hour with foil covering the pan was sufficient baking time.

This was a good recipe taste wise, but next time I'll have to try it with white rice instead of brown.  I suggest if you use brown rice to cook it  before you follow this recipe  because mine didn't cook before soaking up all the fluid. =)

I tried it the original way & then tried it with the dry onion soup reconstituted.  Dry soup will work, but original is simply the best way.  I don't know that I will make it with dry soup again unless I'm desperate.

The rice was fairly flavorful.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because it tasted a lot like pre-made onion soup and it was pretty boring.  Not surprising, but next time I'll make it with just beef broth and add caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms.  I'll try making it in a rice cooker and report back.

This rice is so yummy!! It's moist, flavorful, and best of all, easy to make. I used half the amount of butter called for and it was still delicious. This will be a regular side dish for me from now on.

really good, really easy, I make it with brown rice and it came out great.   You can add fresh or canned mushrooms also.  Don't use instant or wild rice.

This recipe makes some DELICIOUS rice. I dont like to change recipes the first time I make them (otherwise how are you giving a fair review?) so I didnt and it was great. Now I make it with only 1/4 cup of butter which turns out just as yummy. And sometimes when I want this with a quick meal, I will substitute instant brown rice and it cuts the cook time in half!

This was really easy and a great way to jazz up some plain rice. Based on reviews I used brown rice, dry french onion soup mix instead of canned, 1 C water, 1/4C butter. It was a bit salty...but we like salt and I am sure that was due to the dry soup mix. Thanks!

Added a can of mushrooms, drained and used Lipton's Onion Soup Dry mix with a can of water.  The rice was very good but a bit mushy for me.  I tend to like mine a bit al dente.

We thought this was ok,  without the extras i added it wasn't  tasty just plain. ...... After adding the other items is was Good. .......After 30 min of cooking i added mushrooms, broccoli, chopped onion & garlic powder. Covered with foil & baked 15 more minutes. Then removed foil and added parmesan & shredded cheese baking 15 minutes.

This was okay. Cooking it in the oven was not the best method in my opinion. I cooked it in the oven and then also cooked it in a rice cooker. The rice cooker rice faired a-lot better. Cooking it in the oven didn't really cook the rice well for me. It was still hard. I also agree with other reviewers, the measurements are off. Beef Broth comes in a 14.5oz can so you have to adjust all the other ingredients accordingly. Finally, I would recommend adding mushrooms or green onions to enhance the flavor. This was just okay for us. I've made it twice now and it is just okay. Not sure if it is worth making again.

Like megin480, pretty good, more like 4-5 servings. I cut the butter in half, and could even cut that amount in half. Although butter almost always makes everything taste better, a little too greasy for my taste. Also, my beef broth comes in 14.5 oz cans, not 10 oz., and I only had dry onion soup mix, so I added 6 ounces water with the broth and mix. Could've gone to 4 ounces, would've been fine. An easy side dish that the family loved. I'd make it again and maybe try to find a way to jazz it up a little more next time (mushrooms, more onions, etc.) Thanks for a great recipe.

This was GR8. I made some adjustments though. Use only 1/2 stick of unsalted butter and I think brown rice works better. DON'T make this with wild rice.

This was super fast and easy to throw together and get in the oven. After that, it's all just waiting. This was actually delicious and had a fantastic onion flavor and no doubt it was not the healthiest dish on my plate but it was my favorite. I used unsalted butter. I even went back for a second serving. I loved Maria's Rice!

This was a big hit tonight. It was easy to make ahead, added the butter to the rice, bouillon, and lipton soup mix, and set aside for my husband to add water and pop in the oven when he got home from work. I used 1 cup brown rice, 1 package Lipton onion soup mix, 1 beef bouillon cube, half the butter, and 18oz water. Cooked it at 375 for an hour and 5 minutes, half covered, uncovered for the rest of the time. Easy and yummy!

LOVE this rice! Like others, I didn't have canned French onion soup so I used a packet of onion soup mix and a cup of water. Loved it so much that way that I've made it every time like that! I also place my pork chops in the same pan to bake with the rice and they turn out fantastic and moist!

I use the same thing but I use non meat based broth which is also fat free and only a table spoon of butter. I also add assorted veggies after the first 30min. Mushrooms, bell pepper, green peas. Very good side to any salty dish, or meat.

I think this was very good.  However, WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER! I used white sticky rice, cream of mushroom soup with garlic and beef broth.  I will make it again, but with 1/2 or less of the butter!  I should have went with my gut feeling when making it, I knew it would be too much butter!  Also, I cooked it for about 30 mins covered and about 12 mins without foil and some of it was burnt on the bottom of the pan.

I attempted to make this and then put it in the crockpot for dinner. Not a good idea, it came out really mushy. Otherwise it tasted good when it first came out of the oven. My friend has the same recipe but uses dry onion soup mix.

This is fantastic!!!  I substituted Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Condensed Soup (couldn't find French Onion) and added a can of mushrooms and some diced onions.  For the last 15minutes in the oven, I stirred in some sueteed beef cubes with onions and green peppers and it turned out phenomenal!!  My kids loved it!!!

Wonderful!  Made according to recipe except cooked under lid entire time.  ***I made this at a later time and substituted chicken broth for the beef broth.  It was still good, just not as rich and flavorful. ***Made another time and browned pork chops first, then added to the rice dish, and baked app. 50 minutes under foil. I totally omitted the butter. Really good!

This is such an easy and tasty recipe!  I have a large family so I doubled the recipe. I used dry onion soup mix and increased the beef broth.  I only used 1/2 cup butter but even then I think 1/4 cup would have sufficed for 2 cups of rice.  I also added some leftover diced sirloin steak...about 1/2 cup.  The flavor was incredible and my family wanted more.  This is a keeper and I will make it often.

Lovely additions! To avoid a long cooking time and the crunchy edges some people had, I cooked my rice in the following way:
- brought soup and 1 tbsp butter to boil in a stovetop/oven safe bowl
- added rice, then covered tightly
- baked at 350 C for 30 mins
Delicious and fluffy, no hard edges! Thank you for this recipe!

After reading some of the reviews I replaced some of the broth with water hoping to reduce the salt content. I had something taking up the oven so I too made it stove top. to quote randy jackson.. "it was just alright to me" I won't be making this again, sorry.

Really delicious side dish. I took suggestions from other reviews and used 1 can beef consomme and 1 can water with a packet of onion soup mix. I forgot to take the cover off and it still turned out perfect. Perfectly seasoned - not too bland, not too salty. Whole family loved it and will definitely add to the rotation!

I made exactly as written the first time. Although yes, it was amazing, mine came out very burned on the sides and top. I think I will reduce the uncovered time by 15 minutes and go from there.

I love this recipe! Simple and flavorful and goes great with any beef entree. I did it on the stovetop, used onion soup mix plus water plus 1 can of beef broth, and basmati rice. Garnished with chopped green onions for color. Served with meatloaf. Super good!

I made this recipe exactly as directed... The rice texture was perfect, but my family and I thought that the onion flavor was over-powering. Too much onion for my taste.

In my house we eat rice everyday, my husband he's Puerto Rican and he can eat plain white rice, but me im Southern andI need a little more flavor in my life. This recipe was FAST and EASY!!! I wish there were more fast, simple, and easy rice dishes! I added some of my own spices but this recipe is perfect the way it is! I'm making it again right now as we speak!

I used Lipton French onion and a can of beef broth instead of the water.  Did it in the microwave and it turned out very very good.

So simple, yet amazing!  I followed the advice of the other reviews and used the dry onion soup mix.  I however used instant rice.  I mixed 2 cups of instant rice with one can of beef broth(almost 2 cups of liquid), 1/2 can of water, and 1 package of dry onion soup mix.  I only had to bake it for 30 minutes.  I served it with fresh grated paramesan cheese.  Amazing and only a few ingredients!!!

We liked the flavor of the rice, but there is way to much butter.  I cut the butter in half and it was still too much.  I will try it again with a Tbs and see if we like it.

This was good but quite salty. I followed recipe as written using beef broth, one packet of Lipton Onion Soup, and 10 oz. water. I baked at 400 (425 seemed too high), and the rice only took 40 minutes to absorb all the water and become tender. I would make again - it's a nice change to plain rice.

This is a great basic recipe! I had a pork roast that I needed a side dish for & I have mastered nearly everything in the kitchen but for some reason rice has eluded me. I decided to try this recipe since it was baked & I am amazed at how well it turned out! I didn't have the french onion soup or beef broth so I used golden mushroom soup & chicken stock & it was delicious! Thanks so much for such a versatile & easy way to put rice on the table.

Just OK.  Made with a packet of instant onion soup mix and 1 c water.  Also used a cube of beef bouillion and a cup of water as I didn't have a can.  When I removed the cover at 30 minutes, it was scorching to the dish, dry as can be and the edges were very dark.  So I added a little water and checked on it often.  Turned out to be good tasting mushy mushy rice.  Like a paste.  Maybe because I added water, but it would have been burned.

Pretty good.  Followed recipe and next time would maybe add some mushrooms or some Gruyere cheese at the end.  After removing the cover it started to get dry and edges got crunchy so I added some more broth and recovered for the rest of the cooking time.  And, I would say it serves 4-5 people.  Double if you have more than 4.

This recipe is truly easy and tastes excellent. I have made it 3 times now, and what works best for me is using 1/2 c white rice and 1/2 c brown rice. I used dry onion soup mix and add 1 c of water, saute mushrooms, and 1/4 unsalted butter. The first time I made this I used salted butter and it was too salty. My husband and I love this dish.

I make this over and over again.  It's my favourite rice and perfect for entertaining!  It's easy and always comes out perfectly.  I've used the canned soup, but I find the dry onion mix plus 1 cup of water has a bit more flavour...and less expensive.  But both ways are great!!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. Everyone raved about this dish and I had several recipe requests. I used a dish smaller than the 9x9 and used low sodium beef broth. I did use salted butter, but only used about 3/4ths of what the recipe dictated. Cooked for 30 min then stirred and it only needed about 20 more minutes. DELICIOUS! Will definitely make again.

This turned out really wonderful. I am vegetarian so I substituted the beef broth with vegetable bouillon and then I used onion soup mix and a little mayonnaise. I will make this again!

It wasnt as fantastic as everyone said.  I found much better ways to make it.

It was way to strong.  I like to actually taste my rice!  Sorry!

Definately a keeper!  I'm always looking for new ways with rice and this one was so easy and so delicious.  The only changes I made were to add fresh mushrooms and use less butter.  It was perfectly cooked and tasted fantastic.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  Thank you for sharing.

This certainly was not bad but like my recipe better using cream of mushroom soup, a soup can of milk, 1 pkg. dry onion soup, and fresh mushrooms.

All we can say is WOW! this was awesome. We didn't have a problem with saltiness, we used low sodium beef broth and unsalted butter. We followed another reviews suggestion and added mushrooms. This rice dish was perfectly done and had both a wonderful taste and texture. Thanks.

This recipe was great! My family was tired of plain white rice and butter for Sunday dinners, so I tried this with them and they fell in love with it! Plus, I'm an aspiring cook, and the recipe was so easy. The only thing I would change is the amount of butter...it was a bit overwhelming. Cutting the amount down to 4/5 tablespoons did just fine when I tried it again.

I'm not sure I can fairly rate this recipe because I made changes, but here goes!  First, I cooked this stovetop, instead of in the oven, because I was short on time.  Second, I substituted water for the beef broth.  And lastly, I only used about 1 TBSP of butter.  But, it came out great!  I have sometimes used chicken broth to cook rice, but never thought of using beef broth or any beef based soup.  My husband said he really liked it, and I thought it had good flavor.  My young kids even ate it!  When I have more time, I will try making this according to the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Great recipe! I increased to 1 1/2 cups rice, cut down the butter to 2 tablespoons, and threw it all into my rice cooker...so much easier! 
Very flavorful...my husband thought it was a little too strong so I might even add 2 cups of rice next time. I loved it!

Didn't have french onion soup so used lipton mixed with beef consomme; also added freeze dried mushrooms. Overall a good recipe, but salty. Next time I'll use low sodium everything!

Excellent dish! However, next time I will use half of the butter called for, as it was extremely greasy. Unsalted butter preferable due to the sodium from liquids. Will definately make again soon!

This was delicious in flavor, but too oily for my taste.  Next time I will use half the amount of butter.  Half way through the cooking time, when I uncovered the dish i stirred into the mixture, some chopped scallions, sautéed mushrooms and water chestnuts.  Put it back in the oven for the remainder of the time.  Fabulous!

Instead of French onion soup, I used cream of mushroom. It was really tasty, but stuck to the casserole dish really badly, so next time I'm going to grease the dish.

A really tasty recipe.  One can reduce the butter by half at least with no loss of flavor or other alterations needed in my opinion. And I love butter!

I can see how this rice may taste good and maybe it's me but I followed the recipe exactly and my rice  came out burned. We could event eat it. The cook time was way too long. I saw others mention this in their reviews after the fact and wondering if people are shortening the cooking time or just leaving the foil on the entire time. I would like to try this agin but I will be cutting the cooking time in half for sure.

The 2nd time I made it, I used more rice (1.5 cups) and half the butter.  I also decided to use the rice maker.  It was much more easier.  Definitely added to my go to recipes.  Stocked up on Campbell's French Onion Soup and Beef Broth cans...LOL

This is a real 'go-to' recipe that I especially like to serve with pork.  It goes over well with guest.  My kind of recipe.....Easy, but Good!!!  Yes, a little salty from the french onion soup, but I usually serve it with steamed veggies (unsalted) and I am not one to over salt my food so it balances it out.  Also, sometimes I add some sauteed fresh mushrooms and that really takes it to the next level.

I only made changes to accommodate what I had on hand. I didn't have any condensed onion soup but I did have 2 cans of Progresso Onion Soup. I used enough soup to equal the broth & soup. I cut the butter in half & I baked in a casserole with a glass lid. It was a bit overcooked but I just added a little more of the soup, put the lid back on & let it cool a bit. It was perfect by the time I served. This made a nice side dish to the chicken & broccoli we had and I would definitely keep this on my list to make again bc of its ease. I love throwing something in the oven with no fuss.

have made this many times, the family loves it, as we are all onion lovers. Sometimes I add mushrooms. I use the low sodium bullion beef cube in place of the beef broth. Seeing how the oven is already on, we bake a chicken ahead of the rice. It's a great side dish for the chicken.

This was a lot like beef/onion flavored boxed rice. A good everyday dish, nothing fancy as recipe is written. Could be elevated with addition of mushrooms, peas, onions. I used 2 cups water with one pkg of dry onion soup mix and one portion of sodium-free beef bouillon (that would normally yield one cup of broth) to reduce sodium level. Otherwise it would've been way too salty. I reduced butter to 2 tsp. My rice cooked in about 45 mins, and dried out a little on top. Maybe the extra butter keeps it moist, but next time I will just leave the foil on longer.

This was so easy and it was the first rice dish that all my kids liked!!  I made it just as written but added some dried seasonings.  I will cut back to a half stick butter next time to see if we miss it.  Thanks for this awesome recipe.  This will hit the rotation often!

I made this rice dish because it got very good reviews and I wanted to try something new. I followed this recipe to the T. Too mushy for me. I like rice with more texture. Sorry, but I didn't like it, my boyfriend said it was okay.

Really liked the flavor, but I had to make a small change. Instead of onion soup, I added 3 tsp of minced garlic (didn't have any onion soup), and used 2-1/2 cups broth. Tasted great! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the rice kind of burns around the edges of the baking dish and lightly on the top. This caused my daughter to spit it out (not the recipe's fault) and not eat it. I think next time I'll keep it covered for 45 minutes, and uncovered for only 15 (may help). But this really had a great flavor!

Thanks for such a good recipe that is EASY to make!  Family loved it.  I also. as suggested by another, added frozen peas and green onions.  It's the perfect rice when bbqing because you add everything all at once in the pan and pop into the oven.  Will make this again and again.  YUM!

Loved! Made just as recipe said to, however added mushrooms because we love them, and only baked for 45 minutes which was PLENTY. Any longer would have burned the rice. So easy and delicious thanks!!

I had a pork tenderloin in the oven at 350 and was leery of trying to adjust temperature on it or the rice...decided to follow one reviewers lead and try this recipe on the stove.  It worked fine.     I used Progresso's French Onion Soup which is 18.5 oz , 1 C of water and 1 beef boullion cube with 1 1/4 C rice.  I added a little minced garlic and some chopped green onions.  It was good --next time I might add a 2nd boullion cube and some diced onions and maybe bellpepper.

Great side dish! I used the Campbells French Onion Soup and chicken broth since I didn't have beef broth. After taking off the foil, I only cooked the rice for 15min more.  It came out perfect & tasted great!

The rice cooked to the sides of the baking dish and was dry. The taste was good though, so I will probably try the recipe again and rerate.

Absolutely love this! Made as written the first time and decided it would be good as a "fried rice" so the next time I added about half a bag of mixed frozen peas and carrots halfway through cooking time and also scrambled a couple eggs and mixed them in when the rice was done cooking. Wonderful! Thanks for the easy recipe :)

This was very nice and easy.  I used onion soup mix, beef boullion, and 20 oz of water instead of the canned soup and broth.  (I try not to buy too much water weight when I grocery shop. EcoFriendly.)  I also added some mushrooms I had sitting around.  Very good, my family enjoyed it and I'm sure I will make it again whenever I need something fast.  Thanks

Loved this recipe!  My family loves rice but we get tired of plain rice or fried rice.  This was a wonderful combination of flavors.  Next time, though, I think I'll back the butter content to 1/4 cup.  It was a little greasy for my tastes!

ABSOLUTLEY fantastic! I am quite the rice fanatic and I am in love with this recipe, however i did as well substitue the condensed French onion soup for Lipton Onion soup mix and 1 cup of water. It was the first time I made it, so I'm not surprised that the rice turned out a little crunchy. Next time I will be sure to use the right amount of water. Made with Garlic Cheddar Chicken, but found the meal too heavy altogether. Best served ALONE! =)

This rice had a good flavor and was easy to prepare. I cooked it in the oven right along with a meatloaf and cabbage casserole. The time it takes to cook is perfect as it coincided with the other dishes. Next time i would probaly add fresh  minced garlic to the recipe for more flavor.

I get the majority of my recipes from this website and generally the results are very good.This dish however,was a major disaster. I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was an unappetizing grey brown colour and the rice itself stuck to the pan.What was left of it was gluey, mushy and incredibly salty.

I made this tonight to go with lemon garlic rosemary grilled chicken and wow was it good! This recipe is really simple and calls for ingredients that I usually have on hand. Instead of the french onion soup, I used an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix mixed with 2 cups of warm water. My family really liked this rice a lot! Thanks!

This is so simple, and so tasty!  My husband loves it, and I love how easy it is.  Like others recommended, I only used 1/2 the butter.  Thanks!

This rice was a great side. Not too bland. Simple. I just added some frozen veggies to it to give it some color. Great.

This was really good rice. I followed the original recipe, but next time I think I will make some changes like adding some water (it came out slightly  undercooked but with the top burnt) and cutting back on the butter (I really think it would taste about the same using half the amount). Tastewise, though, I thought this was a really great tasting dish, that required minimal effort. A definite keeper. Will make again.

This recipe was good but a little bland. I used half the butter as suggested. Next time I will use a little cayenne and Garlic.

Really good and flavorful.  Absolutely use low-sodium beef broth.  I did not and mine was a delicious, but just a bit too salty.

Flavorful and cooked to a great consistancy. My picky son gobbled it up. Made a few changes because didn't have some ingredients. Used 1 package of dry ranch dip, 1 can beef broth 14.5 oz, 1/2 the can of water, 1/2 the butter and drizzled a little olive oil at the end. With such a flexable recipe will definitely make again.

Good flavor but rice turned out "pasty".  I don't know if it was something I did or the rice I used.  I used regular long grain white rice.  Reheated leftovers the next day were much better.

Next time I will try browning the rice first in butter/oil much like making Rice A Roni from the box.

Wow!  What a delicious rice dish!  So easy to make.  The only change I made was to cook it at 350 for the first 40 minutes and the remaining at 400.  It was in the lower rack of the oven because I was cooking other items at the time.  This will be a keeper for sure.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Melissa. :)

I make this every week. A friend used to make this and added cayenne pepper to taste, and called it "hot rice". I use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp, because we love the heat.My family's absolutely favorite rice dish.

I was looking for a good side dish for dinner tonight and came across this. It was definitely a hit, with a great taste!  I was able to find the canned french onion soup, so made it exactly the way the recipe directed. Note the weight of your beef broth container; the recipe calls for a 10.5 oz can, but the brand I purchased comes in 14 oz cans.  I will try using less butter next time, as it did seem a little bit greasy.  But overall, this is a winner!

Yummy! I made this as directed, decreasing the butter to about 2 tablespoons and increasing the rice by about 1/2 cup, also a little water because of the extra rice. I love this so much, in fact I have another batch in the oven right now! What an easy wonderful meal or side dish. I've been eating this with roasted brussel sprouts, I put the sprouts in the oven when I take the foil off the rice.

This was a very flavorful, easy side dish.

I was in a rush to find a side dish that i also had all the ingredients to and this fit the bill perfectly.

The only changes i made was to use about 1 and 3/4 cup instant rice (what i had on hand-which cut the cooking time down to thirty minutes-covered), onion soup mix instead of the creamed kind (added one cup extra water) and only 1/4 cup of butter.

It turned out great.

Delicious! I also used 1 package onion soup mix + 1 cup water in place of the french opnion soup. This dish is very buttery and NOT for the health conscious but it is yummy. I have made it with less butter and it was very good also.

This is one of those ridiculously easy recipes that you want to share with everyone.  It was super good!  I only put 5 tbls. butter and added a little extra rice.  I used instant so I only baked about 30 minutes and it was excellent!  Company worthy!

I made this recipe and doubled all the ingredients. Unfortunately, there was too much liquid for the amount of rice so it ended up being smushy. The taste was good but I would adjust the broth and french onion soup quantities next time.

I had to modify it a bit. I only had beef broth so I put in 21 oz of beef broth and then a few shakes of the Tastfully Simpl, Onion-Onion. It was perfect. Yum!!!!! Thanks!

I made this to take to a potluck.  It was so easy to prepare.  It was a nice and tasty rice dish.  But...how can you go wrong with a stick of butter??:)

I really liked this rice! It was very easy to make. I was concerned about the amount of liquid the recipe called for. I thought it would turn out with excess liquid, but it didn't. The rice was moist, but not wet. I will make this recipe again.

I got "it's a keeper" from man... I did cut down on the butter by 2T. and I could probably cut out 2T more.  I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and did a total of 40 minutes for the baking time - worked out well.

This was really good and super easy.  My DH and I did not find it too salty as some other reviewers have mentioned (and my DH is very sensitive to salt).  I did reduce the amount of butter to about 4-5 Tbsp and it turned out great.

My Mom use to make this when I was a kid.  When I came across this recipe I knew I had to give it a try.  The rice was delicious.  I used my enameled cover casserole dish.  Very simple and only four ingredients.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

If your going to make this with soup and broth, it would be better with a cream soup, like cream of mushroom, or some dried onion soup mix.

Great and easy recipe for rice.  Pretty foolproof and excellent for Holidays and served with Beef entrees.  I like to add extra chopped fresh mushrooms, (never canned)and grind some fresh black pepper in the rice.  Can make on the stovetop but it's extremely easy in the oven.

Very tasty, but I don't think that it requires the full hour, as the rice tends to get a bit hard.  I added mushrooms as suggested in one of the reviews and it came out great.  A good side dish for sure.

very easy recipe, but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  Time was another factor. I don't always have time for a 1 hour side dish.  Otherwise, I'll make this again because it was very easy and we did enjoy it. I'll look for some way to season it up a bit though.

this was a great sidedish.  It was so easy, but to make it even easier I used minute rice and cut cooking to half hour.  Also had no can soup so used dry onion soup mix with 14oz can of broth and added mushrooms.  It was tasty!
