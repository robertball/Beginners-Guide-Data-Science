Amazing recipe! I don't have any experience with plantains but I knew they came either green or yellow so after googling the difference and learning the yellow are a bit more sweet and flavorful that's what I went with. I used extra firm tofu, fresh mushrooms and folded in the bread crumbs with a spatula after processing. There wasn't enough moisture in the recipe to allow it to turn in the food processor so I added about 1/2 cup egg whites and that did the trick. I used vegetable spray rather than butter to cut calories. I cooked my patties a bit longer- maybe 8-10 minutes per side with the lid on the skillet to cook from both sides. They turned out a little crispy on the outside and still tender in the middle. This may be my favorite veggie patty recipe!!

Made it tonight with a few changes just because of what I had on-hand.  Used banana instead of plantain, didn't have any sun-dried tomato so, randomly, I used some capers.  I also added some flaxseed meal (like I usually do with bread crumbs).  Then I served it in a pita with plain greek yogurt and an orange sauce (1 cup OJ, 1 Tb sugar and 1 Tb cornstarch).  It was delicious.  My meat-loving hubby liked it too.  Not hard to make although a bit time-consuming to fry up the patties.  I'll definitely make it again.

A recipe so insane it just had to work.  It does, but I must share my variant:  soyriso instead of tofu.  An entire tube of that stuff.

The batter came out very gooey. I added quite a bit more of bread crumbs to try to get it to a consistency for patties.  It was fairly tasty, but I would probably not make it again.
