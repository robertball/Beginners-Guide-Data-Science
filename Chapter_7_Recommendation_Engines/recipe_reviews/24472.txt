One pound of apples equals 2 large, 3 medium, or 4 small apples. You need 4.5 large apples, or 6.75 medium, or 9 small apples for this recipe.

This pie was outstanding.  I didn't have any brandy (imagine that, I'm from Wisconsin) so I added Kahlua instead.  I didn't have allspice so I added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I used a combination of Rome and Jonathon apples.  I made one with a double crust and another with a crumb topping.  Both were delicious.  I was afraid the dried cranberries (Craisons) would be too chewy but they were just perfect and a delicious addition.

I used Fresh Cranberries and a little more spice. The apples were fresh frozen and I left the peel on, my Father-in-law loved this pie.  Try putting a little cinn. in the crust too

I love the different ingredients in this pie. I've made it several times and it always comes out great. I use half the cranberries, though. Just enough to get a little kick!

Yum... this filling was terrific!  I've served it at 2 family occasions and it was a huge hit both times.  Tasty and not TOO sweet. 

I changed the cooking directions so that I cooked the pie at 450F for 10 minutes and then turned it down to 360F for another 50 minutes.  Perfect!

This pie was a hit at our Thanksgiving! I'm not a fan of allspice, so I used cinnamon instead. I also used Granny Smith apples for a little extra tart kick. The filling is a perfect combo of sweet, spicy and tart with the cranberries. Definitely a keeper!

Great Pie! Tried it for Thanksgiving and it was a champ. I had extra of the filling though, but hey, good for a new half size pie.  My apples, they were crunchy ...  I cheated by not cooking the filling long enough, and  my family loved it that way.  My boyfriend can't resist it specially if I serve it hot with Ice Cream on top of it.

Good.  A little different because of the allspice, but we prefer it with plain cinnamon.

This pie is great.  Even the kids loved it. I don't have a working scale so the apples measured by number of apples or number of cups of apples would have made this easier for me.  I had to guess on the amount.  I used a mixture of Harelson and Cortland. Yummy!! I will be making this pie for the holidays.

This recipe is amazing!!

I added my own twist by using pink lady apples, and added a teaspoon of both cinnamon, and ginger.

My whole family loved it, and begged for me to make it again!

I did not follow directions to the letter.  I used a bit more sugar and brown sugar, fresh cranberries, no allspice. used over riped granny smiths apples, no brandy.  Twas the best pie I have ever made.  Just to make sure I let my wife taste it too.  She was blown away as well.

This was fantastic.  I made it for the hubby since he was craving a mixed fruit pie. He's requested this to be added to Thanksgiving this year.

I use orange zest, cinnamon, clove powder, vanilla extract. I put the apples and fresh cranberries in a pot cover with water and cook until tinder. Then I add a tablespoon of flour to some cold water, again two tablespoons. Stir and then drain off most of the liquid from the mixture, then add the flour mixture. heat until thickened then add to the crust and bake fifteen minutes or until crust is brown. I also sprinkle cinnamon and clove powder to the crust top before I cook the pie. Sometimes I use red hots instead of brown sugar.
