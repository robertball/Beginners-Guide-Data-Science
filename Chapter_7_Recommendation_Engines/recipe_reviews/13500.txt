I have made this twice now since Thankgiving, it is sooo good! The second time I made it I doubled the peanut butter to 1 cup. Made it more peanutbuttery and a little less creamcheesy.

One of my kids favorite pies.  I add chocolate pudding to the bottom of the pie shell and then put the peanut mixture on top of it.  A favorite of all that have tried it.

This was really good. I think it really needed the peanut butter cups as I didn't think it was all that rich.  I crumbled them up all over the top and just let my guests put extra Cool Whip on top if they desired.  Most did not.  Super easy!  Tastes great.

This pie is fantastic!!  My family requests I make it often.  It is soooo easy also.  The only change I made was I put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while preparing the pie and then I chopped them up in a food processor to make crumbs and sprinkled them over the top (I used only 6 for this).  It is a rich dessert but awesome with a glass of milk.

Very delicious and extremely easy to make.  I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.  Serve small portions because it is very rich.

I made this and my guests and family agreed it there is far too much Cool Whip.  Even my kids complained it was too rich (and that never happens)!  I think it will be better with half the Cool Whip...I will try it again and omit the top layer.

1/4 of my cream cheese was missing when I went to make this recipe, but went ahead anyway.  This is probably why mine wasn't too cream cheesey like most reviewers say.  I think this pie tastes like Reese's Pieces!  Next time I will chop the PB cups b/c leaving them whole is too rich.

I didn't think the peanut butter/cream cheese layer was sweet enough.  Still a good dessert, but if I had to make it again, I would add more powdered sugar.

I made this at Christmas, and I think everyone really liked it except me. It wasn't really as firm as I wanted--I think I really needed a freezer pie, rather than a fridge pie. It wasn't un-firm, but it was no firmer than your average cheesecake. 

It did not hold up well to heat (unlike the other three no-bake cheesecakes I made). That's not a fault with the recipe, just a warning for others--it really needs to be kept quite cold.

Wow! You don't get any easier or any better than this!! Like other reviewers I doubled the peanut butter and halved the whipped topping. I didn't have any peanut butter cups, so I just drizzled a little chocolate & caramel syrup over it. The pie was sooo peanut buttery and held together really well. I will be making this a lot!!

Very good pie - every bite of it went tonight at a pie social, where it was up against some yummy pies. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a bit more peanut butter and a few more spoonfuls of the whipped topping to the blended mix. I don't really care for whipped topping by itself, so I just topped the pie with crumbled Reese's peanut butter cups. It was like a peanut butter cheesecake - very rich!

Good recipe.  Very easy to make.  My only suggestion would be to chop the peanut butter cups and sprinkle them over the top.  This way you get Reese's in every bit, instead of in one or two bites per slice.

I brought this pie to a potluck and there wasn't a crumb left! I did manage to get a piece before it was gone. It's a very rich and decedent dessert.   I added more peanut butter then the recipe called for to enhance the peanut butter flavor. I also put it on a chocolate crumb crust.

Followed other reviews and increased peanut butter to 3/4 cup, used a 12 oz. container frozen whipped topping divided, chopped peanut butter cups and sprinkled on top.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat graham cracker crust, and light whipped topping.  Every little bit helps, right?  Sooooo good!

this was a big hit with my whole family. really easy and really good. I didn't change anything and I left the crumbled peanut butter cups on the side and let everyone put what they wanted on it. The peanut butter cups really make a differance on the sweetness. So I am glad I let my family choose.

this might have been a five star for me, but I don't know because I forgot the powdered sugar. The funny thing is I didn't notice the missing ingredient until my husband told me it wasn't sweet enough-after I had eaten a piece! Next time I'll remember the sugar.

I'm in love!! So easy, and incredibly yummy & peanut-buttery. Perfect! I made this in a 9 x 9 Tupperware square & just made my own graham cracker crust, so it wasn't in the pie shape, but one you'd cut in squares. My mom was putting it together & accidentally put some peanut butter cups on top of the peanut butter mixture before we had the top whipped cream layer done, and that was actually kind of nice - the chunks of cups within it were a tasty surprise. Huge hit!

Most excellent!  Extremley rich, not the the weak hearted however, next time I will leave off the miniature peanut butter cups, that with the already rich pie was to much. I couldnt keep my kids out of the mixing bowl so make extra!

I would recommend using mini Reese's and making a layer at the bottom of the pie then out the mix. Also if you really like peanut butter add more of that. For presentation I sprinkled a small amount of Hersey powder. Delicious
