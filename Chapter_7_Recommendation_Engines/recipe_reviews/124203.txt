Very good recipe, but on the oily side.  Sliced the chicken into strips and reduced oil to 1/4 cup the 2nd time I made these and it was better ~ more heart healthy without losing flavor. Increased the honey to 1 tbsp for a little more sweet and spicy flavor.  Helpful Hint:  Using fresh squeezed vs bottled lemon juice really makes this recipe stand out!  Whole family enjoyed it.

Great marinade for kabobs! The chicken was very moist. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and doubled the amount of honey to 4 tsp.  I also added 1 Tbsp. of dijon mustard.  I let it marinate for 8 hours.  I skewered red onion, red & yellow peppers, and cherry tomatoes to go with it.  The red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick, my husband likes things a little cooler so I made him a dipping sauce: 1/2 c. mayo, 1 & 1/2 tsp. sugar, 1 Tbsp. cider vinegar, 2 Tbsp. buttermilk (you can sub regular milk), 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper.

Excellent marinade! We all loved it, I followed the recipe very closely adding a bit more garlic, it was a keeper! I used bell pepper, mushrooms, red onion squares, and cherry tomatoes in the marinade as well as on the kabobs and it was GREAT! I also did a separate shrimp skewers with another recipe from this site, we all agreed next time to use this recipes marinade on the shrimps next time!

This recipe as is is fantastic.  If you make a Greek salad and some taziki to go with the kabobs and wrap them up in grilled nann bread that has been lightly brushed with olive oil, you will find you have a winner especially with those teens.  A little too messy for the little ones unless you put it in a pita pocket.

Most of the other kabob recipes I'd found called for soy sauce, which I didn't have. I had everything for this one, and it came out grand. I used red and green peppers as well as red onions as well as the chicken, and everything was very tasty.

This is pretty good. Although, spreading the marinade on it while cooking is not the greatest idea since it's an oil based marinade. Tends to flame up a lot! But overall it is good!

This was a very good marinade.  I followed directions exactly except cut my chicken into chunks.  My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the spiciness.  I'm not sure why mine turned out sooooo spicy.  I loved the spiciness, but I made it for guests who don't like spiciness as much.  I thought it was extremely spiciness and next time will try not to add as much black pepper.

I followed the recipe exactly.  They were great and I didn't have any leftovers.  I will comment that some people thought they were a bit on the spicy side so if you have picky eaters reducing the red pepper flakes is a must.

We have a winner!!!!!!  I made the marinade exactly as written, except used 6 cloves of garlic because my family are the type of people that put garlic on our garlic.  Made it into kabobs with mushrooms and green & red peppers and everything was DEVOURED!  Thanks for making me look good in front of the family by sharing this recipe Sharon H!!!  :)

Used fresh lemon juice, halved the olive oil and doubled the honey. Cut 2 large chicken breasts in cubes, along with onion and orange bell peppers. Grilled on the Weber on a grill topper, instead of skewering. Served on Near East Rice Pilaf mix mixed with toasted slivered almonds and parsley. Very pretty dish. I'm adding this recipe to my grilling favorites.

This was great!  I cut the oil in half and left out the red pepper since my children were going to be eating it.  I threaded the chicken on skewers with mushrooms and sliced red onion.  Everyone cleaned their plate and wanted more.

This was very good. I marinated and cooked whole chicken breasts rather than kabobs and served with rice and grilled asparagus. Yummy.

This is the yummiest marinade for chicken. I use this chicken recipe and serve it with some mexican rice & corn on the cob & people LOOOOVE it. I only omit the red pepper flakes because my son doesn't like it spicy and yet it is still flavorful !

these were so juicy and tender. I added some jerk seasoning and used chicken tenders instead of breast. Served them with brown rice and grilled veggie kabobs. Delicious!

We really liked the flavor of the marinade and I appreciated that it wasn't made with soy sauce, something that you find in most marinades.  The only downside was I found it to be a little to oily so I will cut back on the amount of oil next time and increase the amount of lemon juice a bit.

I thought there was way too much oil when I made this the first time but it was otherwise really great, so now when I make this, I use 2 tbsp olive oil and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp lemon juice. Thanks!

Love this recipe. I have been out of lemons and have used vinegar instead. Also have been upping the honey to 1/4 cup. Excellent!

Delicious! I marinated the tenders and then froze them until the day I was ready to grill. I decrease the oil to 3 tbsp. of olive oil. These were delicious!

This was very easy to make. The flavors were very subtle - I would have like a little more "punch." This was a nice base on which to build flavors. Thank you.

Very Good.  I let the chicken marinate for a day.  We grilled these at the beach for a picnic and they were delicious. The kids loved this dish even with the crushed red pepper.

Excellent flavor.  Easy to make.  In fact, my kids helped!  I did let it marinade longer than for hours due to being at work but I think that if anything that only made it better!

This recipe was REALLY tasty. I cooked it for my picky boyfriend and his VERY picky kiddies and it was a hit with the whole fam! I only marinaded for 2.5 hours and it was still very flavorful. I was surprised at how simply yet DELICIOUS this recipe is. Definitely a winner. TRY IT!

I've used both lemon and lime juice for this marinade.  I haven't made the kabob part of the recipe but the marinade is great for boneless skinless breasts. On the grill the honey carmelizes and gives the humble chicken breast a great flavor.  This summer I always paired it with a mango salsa which I make with a fresh mango, red bell pepper, fresh jalopeno finely diced and a videlia onion (or purple onion).  Add salt and a dash of teryaki marinade and you have a really pretty alternative to the kabob veggies and a great presentation as well.

Very good recipe, I followed it exactly and was very pleased with the results. For me it had a nice blend of heat and seasoning. I used my BBQ skewer set that rests above the grill and it came out perfect. I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

We let our chicken marinate for two days and then grilled them.  Very good recipe and one of our new added favorites.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is very good which gives the chicken a very suttle spicy flavor from the red pepper.  The chicken comes out very tender.

This has a very strong spice kick.  Good but not an everyday recipe.  Marinade works well on pineapple.

OMG this was really, really good -- and easy. We had friends coming for a BBQ to help celebrate our new pool with us. I prepared everything ahead of time so that when our guests got here, I wasn't feeling stressed.  I thought I had made so many Kabobs, but there wasn't a single Kabob left. I made both chicken and shrimp and they were delicious, very moist with a wonderful flavor. Love it, love it. will use it again and again and will pass it along to only good friends and, of course, my Mom.

Great -- easy and delicious. I only marinated for about 2 1/2 hours and did not cut or skewer the chicken. Everyone loved it.

Wonderful flavor. I didn't cut up the chicken breasts and it worked out great. This will become a regular recipe in our house!

My husband and I eat a lot of chicken, so I'm always looking for new ways to eat it.  The blend of ingredients came together wonderfully to make a new uniquely tasty chicken!
