Just wonderful! In my opinion, it just isn't authentic Texas sheet cake without the addition of coffee.  My husband loves chocolate cake and had never had this before.  He said it was the best cake he'd ever had and now has a new favorite!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I have made this before but never did use coffee.  It was delicious.  In response to a previous reader that said the icing hardened before the cake could be spread...when my cake is done I pull out the rack and leave it right on the rack (with the oven still on) in front of the open hot oven and spread on the frosting at once.  Someone had suggested this to me and I've never had a problem with spreading the frosting.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  I must say, I was a little disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  The cocoa powder may have been too old. My husband loves chocolate, and it just did not have a rich chocolate taste. I most likely will not try again.

I made this cake last month for a potluck we had at our church to honor our pastor. I never made Texas Sheet Cake before and our pastor loves coffee and chocolate so I thought this would be a good thing to take. When it was time to clean up I happened to see one lady putting four pieces on a plate to take home. Everyone loved it and said I could bring it again. Tomorrow I am making it again for my son's birthday party. What a great tasting cake!

this recepie didn't work well for us because we made three sheet cakes at one time and weren't able to get the frosting on before it started to get hard.

A very moist cake that went together quickly. The secret is to frost immediately as it comes from the oven. I have a family of chocoholics, so I doubled the dark cocoa powder in both cake and frosting and cut the sugar in both by 1/2 cup. Delicious! Couldn't keep my hubby out of it. Oh yeah, make sure your jellyroll pan is 13X18.

This is a very old recipe of mine....A true crowd pleaser with on-hand ingredients, quickly throws together and not much effort.  You will always get requests for more with this one!  The only change I make is I use all butter in the batter rather than the shortening (don't like to use shortening at all).  You won't be sorry!

It was good, although I've had better Texas sheet cakes.  I didnt notice the coffee taste, so I'll omit it next time.

Absolutly perfect sheet cake. I made this for a family party and another person also made a sheet cake, this one was gone and there was more than half of the other left over.

This was good!  I would probably add cinnamon next time.  I used a Hylander Grog flavored coffee and it added a rich butterum flavor to the cake.

The best of the texas sheet cakes so far. Good cake, but the frosting is still a tad too sweet and lays too thin over the cake. But so easy to make.

These were easy and good. I would probably add a little more chocolate in batter, maybe chocolate syrup, to make more chocolate flavorful. Otherwise, they are good, not too sweet. I used tip, about putting frosting on while just out of oven, pulling the rack out a little bit, and it worked perfectly. I will make again.

This was fantastic!!! I tasted it when it was still very warm and I thought it was a little bland, but after it cooled, I LOVED it! My whole family LOVED it! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe tonight to have for Sunday dinner. We are having a baby dedication at church for my granddaugher. It is a great recipe. I sifted all the dry ingredients together prior to starting any of the steps. There were no lumps. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk in the batter and icing. It is scrumptuous! We had to 'taste' a piece before tomorrow. LOVE it. I will definitely make this again.

the cake part gets a 4 star the frosting gets 1. cake was moist and delicious. the coffee part was great without dominanting the taste. brilliant addition. I'm going to incorporate into other chocolate recipes. frosting :  two problems  (both my fault) first..I should have known something wasn't right when other reviews mentioned trouble  with the frosting. and second...I had in the back of my mind that 3 and 1/2 cups of powdered sugar seemed like an excessive amount especially on top of an already sugary cake. and of course it was. turned into sugar cement within minutes of spreading on the cake immediately after taking it out of the oven as suggested. should have taken the helpful tip of just dusting with powdered sugar.

7 9 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8307/texas-sheet-cake-iv/ ... For years, I've made this as "Texas Brownies"  as it was named on a printed recipe card.  No matter what it's called, it's yummmm!  Here are the micro directions it gave - getting to the nittygritty of baking it - "Pour  mixture into a microsafe 9 x 11.  Micro on mediumhigh for 18 minutes, turning every 4 -5 until brownies test done.  They may appear soft on the surface."  I haven't tried it micro because I interpreted "9 x 11" as "less brownies".  ;D ... Btw, this is an excellent  nonchocolate version ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/125130/white-texas-sheet-cake/ ... I don't add the nuts & reduce confec to  3 1/2c.  As listed it's good, too; less is just more of a thick glaze.  Full amount is a bit too sweet so maybe add a pinch o'salt.  :) --- 8.28.19 ... 'Made for Faith, moving to Chattanooga.  E really liked this - & isn't a big chocolate guy.  :D

I made this today to go along with my Mother's Day meal. The cake was wonderfully moist and full of flavor. I lightly sprinkled powdered sugar on top of icing. Oh..I didn't have any coffee made, so I substituted 1 cup strong instant coffee. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.
