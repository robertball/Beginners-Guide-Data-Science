Hi - this is my recipe and I just wanted to note that I have switched from using 1 lb ground beef to 1 lb "meatloaf mix" (a ground beef/pork blend) and it really enhances the flavor of the sauce. Enjoy! :)

I made this for the recipe group selection of 8/13/11. I made very few changes: Browned the carrots and onions w/o the garlic, added them to the crockpot. Browned the beef/pork combo, drained the oil, added the milk and simmered until the milk was incorporated. (I felt this was an important step as I've never seen it in any other recipe!) I then added the meat and rest of the ingredients (except the cheese) plus a few shakes of garlic powder to the crockpot. Cooked on low for 7 hours, turned the temperature down to Warm and stirred in the cheese. This was definately worth the prep time. Hubby kept eating the sauce like chili (sans pasta) and asked me to put the rest in the freezer so he wouldn't OD on it....lol

Wonderful and so easy to make.  I have to admit that I took the advice of another reviewer and I browned the hamburger meat, drained off the grease and added it to the slow cooker.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients and set the slow cooker on low for 5-6 hours.  It was delish!

I made this for the recipe group selection of 8/13/11. I've never had Bolognese however had just seen a cooking show on how to make it. Even though this recipe is slightly different, the one thing the chef said was how important is is to cook the carrot and onions separately, then adding the meat and cooking thoroughly for the right flavoring. So I followed the recipe's instructions to a tee and cooked the time specified. I thought this would taste just like regular spaghetti sauce, but it had a distinct rich meaty flavor. Everyone raved about it...lots of yum yums being murmured.  I served it over wide egg noodles to hold the heavy sauce better. For certain I'll make this one again.

The only problem with this and other recipes is they cook vegetables and add the meat after and then drain fat. When you do this you drain all your vegetable juices along with the fat. Reverse the procedure and brown meat first, drain the fat, then add vegetables!!! Much more flavor!!! Saying this, the recipe was great!!

This is a very good, authentic recipe that's hard to mess up. I think next time though, I'll use Italian sausage instead of the ground beef just because we prefer the seasoning used in sausage. Thanks! :o)

This recipe was delicious!  I made a couple changes - skipped the basil, oregano, & red pepper flakes and I only browned the meat, not the carrots, onions, & garlic.  I also added 1 16oz can of tomato sauce.  Once the meat was browned, I threw in all the ingredients & turned the crock pot on low for 8 hours....PERFECT!!  Even my mother loved it and my brother said it was just like grandma's!

So many people make so many changes and then post their stupid comments. If you have your own way to do it post your own and stop waisting our time with your bable.

This was GREAT and my family loved it. I definitely appreciated the convenience and lack of mess--normally when I simmer pasta sauce it splatters and creates a mess, but this solved the problem.  It won't become my go-to bolognese, but it was flavorful and delicious!

This was the Recipe Group Selection for 8/13/11.  I had never had a Bolognese before so I had no other Bolognese to compare it to, but we thought it was delicious. The changes I made were minimal: using 1% milk and half the amount of red pepper flakes.  I had bought organic grass-fed chopped beef at the farmers market which was an incredible quality.  I browned the meat separately as other reviewers had done.  If you are looking for a fast, throw everything in the pot, stir and head to work type of recipe, this isnâ€™t it . . .  but it is very good.

Very easy to make and simmering in the crockpot took a lot of stress out of the usual bolognese method. I think next time I would use more carrots and onions to add more flavor.

Meh. This was allright. I wasn't particularly thrilled, but my hubby seemed to enjoy this. I hesitated to give this a try, mainly because it really isn't authentic at all (but the slow cooker convenience appealed to me...). True bolognese is made with a mixture of beef, veal AND pork. Celery is also typically added although not necessary (it just adds another level of flavor). Served over spinach fettuccine (ironically, the one thing my hubs didn't care for), this was just "OK." I much prefer my slow cooker meaty spaghetti sauce recipe and will stick with that from now on. Thanks anyways, VD711. :-)

Just finished eating this and I had to review immediately.  This is delish!  The ease of preparation alone made this great, but the flavor is outstanding.  My daughter has been begging me to make bolognese forever but I put it off because of time.  With this recipe, time is no issue.  The only change I made was using Italian crushed tomatoes only because the store I went to didn't have plain.  I think it just added to the flavor.  Maybe will cut back on the added oregano next time as I tasted that more.  My family gobbled it up as fast as I put it on their plates.  I will never use jar sauce again!

I think this is a good standard bolognese, and bet that someone's suggestion for sausage or the author's suggested meatloaf mix would be really good.  Followed the recipe pretty much to a T (other than an 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper) and also threw in a piece of parmesan rind to the second cooking section, but not sure if that did very much.  Definitely as people said - got a good meaty flavor to it.

I usually just make meat sauce by browning some ground beef and winging it - a couple cans of crushed tomatoes, garlic, onions, and a few shakes of Italian seasoning... but when my kids order spaghetti "bolognese" when we are out to dinner, it was just so much better than mine, so I thought I would try a real recipe. And what a difference it makes! The biggest change was adding carrots (for just a touch of sweetness and cuts the acidity of the tomatoes) and the milk. I would never have thought to do that...
We ate it one night over spaghetti (kids ate all the pasta so hubby had to have it over a baked potato since he got home late) - and tonight I made a "beefaroni" casserole with the leftover sauce - basically just macaroni and sauce and a few handfuls of whatever Italian cheese happens to be in the house. 
Delicious and something the whole family likes!
I might try with the Meatloaf mix or also with some Italian sausage next time.

Recipe Group selection from 8/13/11.  I do think the meat needs to be browned before it goes in the crockpot.  I used a beff/pork/veal mixture from my butcher, which was very lean so there wasn't much grease to pour off.  I used regular carrots and tomatoes from the Farmers Market, increased the garlic to 4 cloves and left out the red pepper flakes.  Because I had no tomato paste, I also left out the last 1/2 cup of milk.  This was tasty, but I don't see any advantage to using the slow cooker over the stovetop unless you need to be out of the house.  Thanks for a new recipe.

I thought this sauce turned out great!!!  I only made a few minor changes per other's suggustions.  I added a bit of celery, and browned all the vegetables first.  Removed, then browned a mix of ground beef and ground pork.  Also at the end, I threw in a splash of red wine with the last milk addition.  It was a big hit with my crew!!!  Will definitely make again.

I made this as a Christmas Dinner.  It was great!  I did make the change as to not add in the tomato sauce as the canned tomatoes had so much liquid I was afraid it would be too watery.  It was fantastic.

Simply amazing!  I added 1 cup finely chopped celery to the veggy mix.  I also added 1 lb pork, since I didnt' hace ground I put boneless lean pork chops in my chopped and minced it up.  Then I browned the beef and pork together.  I ommitted the 1 cup whole milk in the beginning process, but did add the 1/2 cup milk for the last two hours.  I also used 2 28 ounce cans of drained diced tomatoes.  My crock pot is huge!  I also am planning on freezing 1/2 this batch since I am expecting twins any day now.  Will be making this again and again!!!

I think this is a good basic recipe.  It was recommended to me because I had some whole milk to use up.  I am not sure the purpose of the milk but it seems to be a necessary part of the recipe.  I added my own homemade Italian pork sausage as 1/2 of the meat and home canned tomatoes.  I used red wine instead of the last addition of milk.  I've only tasted it on some homemade rolls so far but look forward to boiling up some pasta and having it for lunch today!  Thanks!

This was good!  I did double the recipe but used 1 pound beef and 1 pound ground pork.  Leftovers worked so well in a baked rigatoni.  Would I make this again?  Sure!  Thanks!

Made this for recipe group. We really enjoyed it. I used ground venison which had quite a gamey taste at first, so I added just a touch of sugar & let it simmer longer. Very nice recipe.

We really enjoyed this one! I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce (when adding the extra milk and grated cheese), plus some fresh basil at the very end. Next time I'll probably add more garlic plus some red wine (in lieu of the extra tomato sauce, but will add the wine in the beginning). This is definitely a keeper.

DELICIOUS! The hardest part is chopping up the carrots and onions, but other than that, this was a breeze to put together, smelled wonderful and tasted great! My only issue, and it's due to my own personal preference, is that next time, I will cut the oregano and basil both by half...it was a little too 'herby' for me, but again, that's my preference. I used meatloaf mix, as others suggeated, as well. If you're really short on time, I don't see why this couldn't be assembled the night before and just cooked when ready. This is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good recipe. I'm giving it 3 stars because I followed it and it was bland to me. So glad I tasted it and I was able to add more seasoning. I added onion powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and upped the red pepper. After I added the milk and cheese to the crockpot I let it cook on low for the next 2 hours. Tasted much better after that. I'm serving it over spaghetti squash and freezing the rest for later.

I was really excited about making this and it was just ok.  It was a very generic meat sauce, nothing out of this world.  Not sure if I'll make again.

Our family just didn't care for it.   It was a little bland for our taste. I made according to recipe and everyone said it was just OK.  I heated the leftovers but added more garlic, oregano, salt and some cayenne pepper and they liked it more than the first time but asked that I stick to what I usually make.  I admit we are an extremely picky family when it comes to spaghetti sauces.  Thanks for submitting though.

I made this for the family last night and it was a huge hit. I used a combination ground beef & ground sausage (meatloaf mix w/out the veal) that was just a little over a pound. I also used crushed tomatoes with Italian herbs and I kept the pasta separate using spiral noodles. This recipe will be used again and again! Yum!

I made this yesterday and we all loved it (including a 7 yo who doesn't like gravy or ground beef). This is the best recipe I have made on here in quite a while.  I made almost as directed, but substitued meatloaf mix for the ground beef.  I didn't have dried basil, so I used some italian seasoning.  I think I added a bit less seasoning too.  If I were making for myself, and not 3 little kids, I would kick up the crushed pepper.  I removed the carrots/onion/garlic before I sauteed the meat.  Cooked on low 4 hours, added remaining milk and cheese and cooked on low another 4.  Served over fresh pasta.  Will make over and over again!

Can't figure out what I did wrong but following the recipe exactly, our Bolognese was tasteless.  Fortunately I had cooked a side dish of sweet sausages and that added flavor.

I thought this turned out really well.  I would have given 5 stars but I changed a few things.  I used a frozen mirepoix mix and threw it right in the crockpot, and I used 2% milk instead of cream because it was Christmas and that was what I had!  My 2 year old and 5 yr. old ate it all.

The final product was great! The only beef I have (no pun intended) with the recipe is the prep time. It took much longer than 20 min. It took about an hour because it takes a long time to finely chop and mince all the vegetables. The only way I can think this would take 20 min. is if you have a food processor.

Came out excellent! My recommendation is to to cook on high per the directions in the first half then turn to low and cook for an additional 6 hours, stirring on the hour.

Best sauce I have ever made. I did use meatloaf mix, And 3 garlic cloves.  Followed directions except I did add rest of the milk and the cheese as soon as I put everything in the crock pot. I chopped carrots, onion, garlic in a food processor so the pieces were so small any picky eaters could not tell (by the looks) that they were in there.

Very simple, and very tasty. I served it over spaghetti squash, which also made it very healthy! I loved how meaty it is.

UPDATE: Made it using 1/2 mild italian sausage and 1/2 very lean ground beef. Delicious!

Can't give 5 start because I did change a few things. I doubled the recipe using 1 lb. beef & 1 lb. italian sausage. Did not have whole milk, used 2% with some 1/2 & 1/2. Next time try all beef. Family enjoyed including the 15 year old grandson. Will make again.

Very good! I made this on the stove top.  I simmered for 60 minutes total.  After 40 minutes I added the 1/2 cup of milk and the parmesan. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent Bolognese sauce, I was having a ton of company so I doubled the recipe, using 1 pound ground pork and 1 pound ground venison.  It was great, and those who don't like venison didn't have a clue, just raved about this dish.  lol

This is a great recipe! My husband, 2 year and I were all taste testing and eating it just like chili! 
I used almond milk instead of cow's milk and it still turned out delicious :) I halved the red pepper flakes because I don't like spicy food, but I probably could've added all of it and it still wouldn't have been too spicy.

Made exactly as recipe calls for but simmered on stove top.  My dad said it's the best sauce I'v ever made. This was the first time I tried adding milk to sauce.  This made the difference.

I saw this recipe about a year ago and it's become my favorite, spaghetti sauce. It has such a good flavor and is so little work. I use a lb of ground beef and a lb of Italian sausage. It's fantastic!

Pretty tasty and really convenient from the slow cooker. My husband and my younger coworker gobbled it up. I was a bit apphrensive over the milk (I used cream instead, as that's what I had on hand) but it was fine. I usually use bacon in a Bolognese, so I missed it a bit in this dish. On a whole though, quite good.

Very easy assembly.  I used the left over sauce for lasagna.  I changed it up a bit and used meatloaf mix (ground pork, veal and beef), used heavy cream in place of the milk, browned the chopped vegetables and after a few mins added the tomato paste to the pan. I put the raw meat in the crock pot and occasionally lifted the lid to break it up with a potato masher.  This came out fantastic!  Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight for dinner and it came out excellent. My changes: used 1 lb hot italian sausage (instead of beef) and added about 1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley. Will be my go-to bolognese. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for sharing:)

This was GREAT!  Tasted authentic to a good Italian restaurant.  I used a 'meatloaf mix' rather than just ground beef.  The meatloaf mix contains pork and veal.  This is a fantastic way to stretch one pound of meat! I recommend using San Marzano tomatoes for a richer flavor.  My oven has a 'slow cooker' setting so I cooked it in that.  Delish!!

This was a great, easy to use recipe. It was very flavorful. I'd recommend to anyone wanting to make an excellent bolognese. I'm not a fan of the meatloaf addition though as it makes it too sweet with the ketchup (which is mostly sugar).

I have not tried it yet, but authentic bolognese (Marcella Hazan Classic Italian Cookbook) contains celery and does not brown the meat, just removes it of its color before adding the milk. Fresh grated nutmeg is stirred in after adding the milk. Then a cup of dry white wine is added and allowed to evaporate. Only afterward are the canned tomatoes incorporated. Then it is to be cooked 3 hrs. uncovered at a very, very low simmer. The end result is a very delicate, subtly flavored thick sauce. I will uncover the crockpot for the last couple of hours to allow it to thicken and not add any additional liquid until necessary. She suggests thinning it with a little water if it becomes necessary.I will make this tomorrow and let you know the results.

I love LOVE this recipe!  I've made several times and always use meatloaf mix so you also have some ground pork and ground veal with the beef for added flavor.  Also I add some finely chopped celery and some chopped celery leaves.  Serve over tortellini or cavatelli and this recipe is fantastic!!

Wow, this sauce was great!  I prepared everything the night before, took the crock-pot dish out of the frig in the morning, and when I got home from work, the house smelled amazing.  I added in some diced celery and 2 fresh bay leaves.

I added 3 strips of crispy, cut up bacon pieces, as well as doubled the amount of red pepper. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!! I highly recommend this. The amount of ingredients can seem intimidating, but there truly aren't that many steps.

Great flavor!  I ended up just cooking mine on low for 6 hours.  Carrots fit into the sauce nicely.  I served this on some spinach, tomato, basil linguini pasta.  Thanks!

This sauce is thick and has a deep rich flavor. To save time and get the sauce simmering in the crock pot more quickly, I cooked the carrots and onions in the oil in one pan while browning the meat then simmering it with the milk in a second pan.

1/26/20 - My first time making this sauce, was super easy and smells amazing.  I didn't cut up my carrots small enough so next time I'd probably puree them after cooking so it's more "saucy" and less chunky but my step-son liked it and said the chunks were fine!  Overall a good recipe that I would make again!  Made 3 good servings for dinner and I froze the other half for another day.

My husband and I thought this was delicious!  I used sweet turkey sausage and mirepoix (pre-chopped onion, carrot and celery mix).  No chopping involved for me!  The sausage breaks up much more easily than ground meat does and is very tasty too!  The spices and other ingredients totally masked the turkey flavor.  I used my Breville fast slow pro cooker (similar to Instapot), so it was a one pot process, with very little clean-up.  Overall, a great recipe!

While it did taste good, I cant say it felt worth the effort or dishes. Perhaps if you were to use the finest ingredients you can find, but otherwise it didn't seem any better than store bought bolognese. If you enjoy diy and lots of fine chopping, it did turn out tasty.

I made this yesterday after reading about it in the January 2020 AR magazine. So good! I didnâ€™t have pork on hand so i used ground beef. It turned out great! I got busy with the kids and forgot to add the milk and Parmesan until 20 minutes before it was supposed to be done. Turned out just fine regardless. The whole family enjoyed it so Iâ€™ll keep it in the dinner rotation.

I took the advice of some of the people on here and cooked the meat first and drain the fat. then I added the onion, carrots, and garlic. I also added sausage meat and used some red pepper ( chopped) because some of the reviews said it was a little bland. My only other suggestion is let it sit overnight in the fridge and heat it up the next day. My mother always did that and it seemed to make a difference in taste to me.

Very easy to do and turned out pretty good. It just lacked a little flavor and needed something a little extra to enhance taste. I'm going to experiment next time because I'd like to make this again!

Wow this was great.  I cooked the carrots, garlic and onions first along with the seasoning to toast it a bit.  I put that into the crock pot.  Next I browned the meat and cooked it with milk.  Put that into the crock.  I sautÃ©ed a bunch of sliced white and crimini mushrooms along with the tomato paste then dumped them in.  I used some canned san Marzano tomatoes and a can of tomato puree.  I let it cook for a few extra hours though and the flavor was fantastic.  Will definitely make this again.

Put this in the slow cooker mid-afternoon on Christmas Eve and when we came back from Christmas Eve Mass it was ready. Husband and child raved about this. Used about 1.3 lbs mixed pork and beef. Delish!

This is fabulous, but I made just a few changes: I added so much more garlic (2 heads); I ended up adding 2 whole red peppers, also; I used fresh basil towards the end of the cooking time; I ended up cutting short the cooking time because it seemed to cook much more quickly. I loved the addition of the milk (I used half and half) for a creamier sauce. Next time, I think I'll add some ground sausage for even more flavour.

As per other suggestions, I browned meat first, drained fat, removed from pan. Then sautÃ©ed carrots, celery, onion and garlic using an herb infused olive oil. Tossed meat back into pan & followed instructions from there. I will definitely make this again. It was a giant hit. Thanks for the recipe

I have made many bolognese recipes in my slow cooker and this is my favourite by far. I used 500g of beef mince and 500g of pork mince. Although I had double the meat quantity I still used the same amount of ingredients but I doubled the spices and added two beef stock cubes. In Australia we don't get 28oz cans of tomatoes so I used two 14oz cans. I cooked this on low for 11 hours and it was probably fractionally dry so next time I may add some liquid beef stock.

My new favorite sauce. Far better than any jarred spaghetti sauce. It's rich and creamy and subtle in flavors. Cook it as read and adjust later if you wish. I love it as it is (well maybe a little mushroom) :)

Omitted the carrots, doubled the onion and basil, extended cooking time by an hour but last hour was placed on low. In the last hour, I added a mixture of 1/2 c Gouda, 1/2 cheddar in last hour, and a half a cup of chicken stock.

My family consumed EVERYTHING. Feedback was phenomenal.

My only change was browning and draining meat (burger and sausage) first.  Able to make all the mess and dump in crock pot and clean up kitchen.  My dinner guests loved it.  I made it twice for our company at the lake.  Then just had to boil the pasta.  I used a hearty papadelle.

With small changes (( read all the reviews), this recipe is GREAT!  I used ground veal, ground hot sausage, ground GOOD beef (don't get the cheap version).  I added brown sugar to the cooking meat.  I added a can of tomato sauce, and more basil, but most importantly I added WINE to the recipe (don't be stingy).  Came out great! Hubby loved it and won't stop eating it.

I really enjoyed this sauce and so did my family. I added 1 chopped celery stack and used meatloaf mix instead of plain beef.  Did not have whole milk so I used half skim milk and half light cream. Everyone commented on how much better this bolognese was then my old meat sauce.

Taste wise it was good, but to me it was a lot of work for a sauce I could have made just as easily over the stovetop.  Also the cook time didn't seem to agree with my slow cooker as the sides began to burn.

I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce but next time I might just modify and cook strictly on the stove.

I love this recipe. I follow all the instructions but add just a bit of dry red wine which I think kicks it up just a notch in the flavor department. If Bolgnese wasn't so fattening I would probably make this recipe all the time!! We serve it on no yolk egg noodles.

OMG this was SO good! I didn't add the cheese and extra milk since I'm not a huge cheese person (and figured  I could  sprinkle cheese on top when eating the sauce if I desired). I also didn't cook the sauce as long as the recipe suggested as I noticed it cooking a little too much. I did two hours on high and about one hour on low (but without the milk and cheese to melt/warm up, I think it shortened cooking time).

To simplify the prep, I also used shredded carrots from a bag and frozen onions.

This sauce is good to eat and easy to make. I agree with the member who said you should drain the grease first, then add the veggies and simmer, otherwise you lose some depth of flavor.  We also used a combo of beef and pork.  Speaking of depth of flavor, I used hunts tomato sauce and paste, the sauce is too tangy, but I am almost certain it is due to the paste or tomatoes.  If anyone has any suggestions for another brand with better flavor, let me know!  I also added more spices and cheese than the recipe calls for, using both asiago and parmesean. I usually like my food a little heavy on the spice.   It also helped with the tang.  Think i may use heavy cream in place of milk next time.  Thank you, OP. My family really enjoyed their meal tonight!

For slow-cooker, you can't really get much better when it comes to spaghetti bolognese sauce unless you stood over a hot stove for 3 hours stirring. Not as good as standing over a hot stove for 3 hours stirring, but pretty darn close! Highly recommend this!

I've made this a few times now. My family loves it! I sometimes use Italian chicken sausage instead of beef. That taste great too. I use unsweet cashew milk to make it dairy free since we have a food allergy. Nutritional yeast for the parmesan. I double it and freeze half.

Very easy to make, and great for a quicker crockpot meal. Does not need to cook so long in crock pot though... I went ahead and made the spaghetti and served after 3 hours, and felt that was pushing it a bit, because a lot of it is precooked when you start it. If you have a hard time after a couple of hours with it sticking to the sides, just add a little more milk and use a rubber spatula and it will come right off and back in with the rest of the sauce.

I made this recipe today and it was ok my family loves garlic and spices so I made need to adjust for my families taste. Definitely a good base recipe. I did use ground turkey because that was what I had on hand which might be part of the problem.

This certainly isn't pretending to be a "real" bolognese, but it was easy and very budget, time, and clean-up friendly.  I followed the directions as printed and found it to be quite bland.  There are lots of possibilities here to customize/up the flavor to your liking with this solid base recipe, so I'll probably keep it on file and make it "my own" next time.  Love the slow cooker element though!

I have a habit of tinkering with recipes a bit and adding this or that, or more of one thing or another.  Well, with this recipe I decided to make it exactly as written.  Made if for my sons birthday, and we had the inlaws over.  Everyone loved it, was just perfect!  Served it over Barilla whole grain thin spaghetti noodles.  Very meaty and rich.  I really cannot think of changing anything.  One person mentioned adding some bacon, sounds good maybe will try that.  But truly this is a great recipe just as written and very easy!

This sauce is so flavorful and delicious. It's easy, too, and it freezes well. I made a double batch and divided the leftovers into 3 freezer bags, then laid them flat in the freezer for future meals. I might leave out the crushed red pepper next time since I don't love hot spices, but it's a great addition if you do. I agree with another reviewer that egg noodles are best with this.

AMAZING! This was one of the best things I've ever made. Thank you so much for the recipe. I did double the recipe and used pork and ground beef. ( I was going to use a meatloaf mixture but I couldn't find one.) I'm not sure if that changed anything but the flavors of this were amazing. I used a little more garlic and a few more spices to kick it up a little. I can say I'm making this again. So good and super easy to make as well.

This was really good.  My family liked it a lot.  Much easier than regular Bolognese.  Serve over heavy noodle such as rigatoni.  Add a pinch or two of sugar and whatever tomatoes you have on hand (diced, whole...) Very, very good.

This was so authentic Italian that I thought I was back in Italy! I would not change anything. The recipe was perfect!

Just made this today and it was a five star recipe. It was easy to make and delivered as promised. I followed other's suggestions to drain the meat and used a meatloaf mix. I also cooked it on low for the last hour.

I know people take issue with reviews using different ingredients, but I all I had was mild itlaian sausage on hand, so I used that instead of ground beef.  The whole family LOVED it.  It was so tasty and not hard to make at all.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I tried this because of the convenience of a slow cooker recipe. First, the preparation took about as much time as preparation for a traditional Bolognese sauce. More importantly, the sauce was really tasteless, even though I added sausage as the recipe writer suggested. I could not eat it. I had cereal instead. I only gave it two stars because my husband ate it. Sorry, but I will go back to my traditional recipe.

I am glad I saw the comment to use the pork/beef/veal mix. For my first bolognese I thought it was excellent. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze it and have extra on hand.

I did everythg to make it taste better. Neither of us cared for it. I love the bolognese you get at Macaroni Grill; I guess I thought it wd taste like theirs.

Great recipe! I added extra crushed red since we love heat but otherwise cooked it by the recipe! Was great!

This is a great recipe. Very tasty and authentic.  I happened to not have carrots when making this and substituted it with a teaspoon of sugar. Came out great.

This was very good. I made it with ground beef & pork as well and I think it added more flavor.

Loved this recipe. Only thing I changed was added a tbsp of sugar to add a bit of sweetness.  I'll be making it again.

Made this exactly to the T- except I ran short on time and didn't have enough cooktime to make in the crockpot- I just did it on the stove top and let it simmer for a while. Delicious!

The flavour and consistency was incredible! Excellent recipe. I didn't have canned crushed tomatoes, so I quickly searched online and made a substitute with fresh tomatoes. I will absolutely make this again & recommend to others. Thank you for sharing!
