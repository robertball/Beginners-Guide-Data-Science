I use fat-free sweetened condensed milk and low sugar dried cranberries with great results. Parchment paper is key. Always a hit!

I used the triple chocolate chips sold by Nestle, with white, milk and dark chocolate. It takes one bag, much easier than the two different chips! These are amazing, even the picky kids loved them!

I swapped out the bittersweet chips for Hershey’s special dark mainly because they were on sale. Had family over and gone in a flash! Seriously I caught Steven snatching extras to hide

Yum!  So easy to make and little ones can join in, too.  Lots of experimenting with tastes and textures while stirring.  I made this the first time for a cookie exchange.  I thought they would be adorable made into individual bites using decorated paper liners in a mini muffin pan with a single pecan on top.  They were absolutely beautiful to look at but impossible to eat because you can't get the paper off.  The parchment paper is a must.  My second try was a slam dunk.  Everyone loved them.

This was fairly easy to make. I used parchment paper and the whole thing lifted right out of thw pan.  But, in preparing the graham cracker crust, I folded in rhe half cup (4oz) of butter and it didn’t seem to be enough. So I doubled the butter and it STILL wasn’t enough to sufficiently wet the graham cracker. As i cut into the cooled finished product, the graham cracker crust crumbled as I thought it would.

I think the crust was a bit thin.  Next time I will make half again as much.  
(Side note on the crust. When I saw this I really wanted to make them but did not have graham crackers in the house. So I processed Ginger Snap cookies that I had and they turned out to make a great crust.  Next time I think I may add some crystallized ginger to the mixture)
I liked the mixing of this rather than layering each ingredient like the "Magic Cookie Bars" or "7 Layer Bars" .  The mixture gets coated more fully and seems to bake better. 
This is a "Keeper" recipe.

This was a fast and easy recipe, if you have all the ingredients. I had to make a grocery store stop to get just the right stuff. The bittersweet chocolate chips don't add that much so go ahead and use semisweet in their place. I made these just to have around the house for snacks, but I'll make these bars again for a gathering of friends. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a party yesterday.  Added 1/2 cup more graham cracker crumbs to the crust and used all semisweet chocolate chips. We all loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Might try an oatmeal crust the next time, I think it would cut some of the richness/sweetness.

This was DISGUSTINGLY sweet!  Often I make a recipe and, after tasting the finished product, modify it to better meet my taste.  Tthe recipe was not worth trying to improve.

Found this in All Recipes Magazine.  I thought they were too sweet, but my guests all loved them.  I used chopped pecans instead of halved pecans, and the Nestles three flavor of chips.    I also lined my pan with non-stick foil instead of parchment paper.  This recipe is now in my  permanent recipe file.

Terrible recipe because of the crust, which just falls apart.  Would probably be OK with a  shortbread type of crust, but I do NOT recommend the graham cracker crust.

This recipe was quite delicious. I used ginger snaps instead of graham crackers. It came out slightly gooey. I don't think that I used enough pecans. I will make this again.

The taste is good in these bars, as I like all the ingredients. The only change I made was, as suggested by another review, using a package of triple chips instead of the two separate chips.  The crust is somewhat crumbly, though, so the presentation isn't as nice as I hoped. But they taste  very good!

If there was a sixth star, that's what I'd give these treats, and change the name to Died and Gone to Heaven. No changes to recipe but I made 2 pans the first time to give as Christmas goodie gifts. Now I need to make more for us!

This is a very easy recipe, and also easy to double and put into 2,  9 x 13 pans.  You must use parchment paper or the bars will be difficult to remove from the pan.  I used chopped pecans rather than pecan halves which made them easier to cut.

I made a half batch to try this one out - delicious but didn't set up as much as I would like, ended up putting in fridge.  Since I still have a half can of the milk, I may try pouring the sweetened condensed milk on top of the graham crackers and then pressing the other topping ingredients into it like the old Magic cookie bar.
