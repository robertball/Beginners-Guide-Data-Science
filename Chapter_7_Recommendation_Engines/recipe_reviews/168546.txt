This was too tart and tangy for my family! To tone the vinegar, mustard and onion, I added 1/4 teaspoon of white sugar. The dressing was thin and runny. Served over a fresh garden veggie salad. Everyone really LOVED this (especially since the kids only eat ranch dressing) after modifying with the sugar.

This was awesome - I used regular mayonnaise, as that's what I had on hand, and added a few twists of fresh cracked pepper.  Delicious, easy and a new favorite in our house!  I think it's the fresh parmesan and fresh herbs that put it over the top.  I used this over Layered Spinach Salad from this site and it was a perfect match.

This dressing was very runny.  I made it for the Layered Spinach Salad--which it worked fine for.  Next time I'll double to pour over the Layered Spinach Salad.

Pretty tasty. I used this dressing for Patty's Pasta Salad, which is also from this site, instead of using a bottled dressing. It was a nice understated dressing for a cold pasta salad that had a few loud ingredients, which is what I needed though it was a bit thin. I did one heaping tablespoon each of FF sour cream and FF yogurt and that helped thicken it up just enough to latch onto the salad ingredients. If I were to use it for a green salad, I might want to play with the spices a bit. NOTE: A doubled recipe of this was the perfect amount for Patty's Pasta Salad.

4 stars for flavor, 2 stars for body. This is tangy as promised, and while it is creamy, it is still lacking in body, being much too thin. I thickened it up with a little softened garlic herb cream cheese which was an improvement. I would make this again, but with a lot of tweaks.

Was looking for something along the lines of Carrabas Parmesan house dressing, but this wasn't it. Sorry. Way to runny and not creamy and thick at all. Just not for me. thanks

This was okay.  A little too much basil for my tastes.  I'll keep working with it.

This is delicious!  I did end up adding a little sugar to balance it out, but other than that, it's perfect.  I used it on the layered spinach salad from this site, and found that doubling the recipe worked great.

Followed the recipe and this is very good! Not sure why other reviews said it was runny as mine was thick. Maybe it is how you grate/shred the parmesan? I shredded it quite fine. I like the herb-y-ness of this!
