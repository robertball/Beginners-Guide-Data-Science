8.14.16   I had some london broil in the freezer, so I used that rather than round steak.  Sliced it partially frozen, as thinly as I could, and the beef was so tender it just about melted in my mouth.  The broth has the perfect combination of ingredients and is so flavorful.  You definitely know it’s Asian, but it doesn’t reach up and smack you in the face either; subtle may be a good word.  With all of the veggies and pasta, it is a thick soup (I liked that), but if you’d prefer a thinner consistency, you certainly could just add more beef broth.  Islandartist, fabulous soup, LOVED everything about it.

This is quite tasty. I didn’t cut the noodles, leaving them intact. I added a dash of white pepper and tripled the Sriracha. Thank you for the recipe.

It had a great flavor. The noodles were very mushy which turned the kids off. Next time I'll make the noodles separately, and add them as we eat the soup.

Great dinner tonight. I didn't add sriracha, don't like it much personally, and added a couple TBS of sesame oil for flavor but that's it. pretty good soup and super easy to adjust for personal taste.

This was great!  My husband AND my kids really enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe. Used flank steak, sliced very thin while partially frozen. Added 4 cups water to 2 containers of beef broth. Next time will add 8 - prefer more broth to noodle ratio.  Added 1 TBSP fish sauce and 1 TBSP hoisin sauce. Used fresh ginger instead of ground. Only 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Shredded the carrots and sliced the onion very thin. Added noodles at very end and simmered additional 5 minutes. Thank you so much for sharing this!

This recipe is very tasty. Both my husband and I couldn't stop eating. The only thing I did differently is cooking noodles separately.

My husband and grandson really liked this. The only change I made was omitting the peppers. I will definitely make this again, experimenting with different meat and broths.

Definitely needs pepper or more Sirachna. Also, I would shred the carrots next time to keep veggies consistent. Used ground celery seed vs chopped celery. It was good. I think these changes would make 5 star.

This was a hit with everyone at my fiber art retreat.  I added half the brown sugar--2 Tablespoons rather than 1/4 cup.  I also substituted broccoli for the peppers, because of dietary restrictions of one of the participants.

Made this tonight only without the cabbage and used stew beef that I sliced thin.  The family loved this soup.   I'll be making this again!   Yummy!
