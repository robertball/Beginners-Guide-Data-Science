Great alternative to the messy bacon wrap that does not always cook to ones' liking.  Everyone loved these.  Not a single one left on the plate.  Made just as the recipe states.

These were pretty good. However, I will not make them with the pastry again - just a bit too much/filling for us and it dulled the taste a little. We like the hotness of the Jalapenos!

Ok why are my soooooo spicy. I took out all the seeds and insides and they are still inedible but I still want to eat them weird. I used crescent dough they look really pretty but too spicy and I am a total spice lover. Will try again somehow lol

This recipe is wonderful.  I have made it with and without the pastry and it's great either way.  I didn't have any Monterey Jack last time and substituted 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup sharp cheddar.  It was just as good.

OMG!  I was hooked on the bacon-wrapped jalapenos, but now that I have made these about 10 times, I'm hooked for life!  I have even gotten people who don't like jalapenos to try these and they love them.  It's something about the puff pastry!  Mmmmmmm Mmmmmmmmm!!
