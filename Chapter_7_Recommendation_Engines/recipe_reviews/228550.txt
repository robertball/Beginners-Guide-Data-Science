Nice!  I had some spare pasta laying around and no dessert and this recipe fixed that!  I used elbow macaroni, a can of condensed milk, and cinnamon and nutmeg instead of cardamom.  I also added a little shredded coconut that I had on hand.   The key is having the patience to wait until it goes from soup to pudding in the saucepan!  Thanks for the recipe!
