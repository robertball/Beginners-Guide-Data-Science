This salad was a huge hit at our family barbeque.  The blackberries were hard to toss so next time I will add them last.

We enjoyed this. As an experiment we also tried red raspberries, strawberries and also good. One note; add rest of salad things and toss and add berries last so they won't crumble. Thanks for sharing.

Very unique salad - nice combination of flavors and colors.  Used almonds instead of walnuts and served with a balsamic dressing.  Next time I will probably mix some romaine lettuce with the spinach, but I will definitely be making this again!

Awesome recipe - and so quick to make!  I made a huge batch of it and ate it every day for lunch for nearly two weeks.  Everyone that tried it at work went home and made it for dinner.  I skipped the tomatoes and used the no dressing version.  Loved it!!

Outstanding.  The table full of junior-high girls "eeewww"'d at the written recipe but delighted in the tastes and appearance of the finished product.  The table full of their parents was equally thrilled.  Any recipe that can accomplish THAT is a winner and goes into our Keepers file!

Easy to make and beautiful presentation. As other reviewers recommended, I added the blackberries last and tossed in some balsamic vinegar. Delicious.

Mmm, yummy recipe. I added canned mandarin oranges, sliced almonds, crunchy sesame seeds,and omitted the feta cheese. For a dressing, I used raspberry vinagrette. Make sure you prepare this right before serving, as it will get soggy (due to the dressing, juices from the fruits).

This salad is a simple blend of various flavours that packs a total punch.  I used raspberries since I couldn't find blackberries, and they were just the right amount of tart to substitute.  I used balsamic vinegrette with a touch of honey.

Tasty and healthy. I was surprised that it was so good without any dressing. I didn't think it needed any. I left out the nuts (daughter is allergic) and flowers. I'm not much of a salad person but I did like this one a lot.

Delicious! No dressing was mentioned, but I did my standard.....a bit of garlic salt, a bit of olive oil and a dash of balsamic vinegar.

I made this salad for a dinner party.  It was not as unique tasting as I had hoped.  However, it was definitely a very pretty looking salad.  I would probably not make this again.

All the flavors worked very well together in this!  I really wanted to use the edible flowers but my store didn't have them.  OBVIOUSLY this recipe is JUST a salad recipe so you will need to come up with a dressing. I just used some oil and red wine vinegar.  Balsamic and oil would be good too!  Yum!

Very tasty! I loved everything about it. I could only get frozen mixed berries since blackberries aren't exactly in season here in January. I'm sure fresh ones would have been much better. It was fine dry but a balsamic vinegar would have been an excellent balance for the alkaline in the spinach.

I'm rating this as I took the essence of the recipe & changed it a bit.  I substituted blueberries for the blackberries & blue cheese for the feta.  I tried it with Italian dressing one day & balsamic dressing another time.  I liked it the best with slivered cooked chicken & blue cheese dressing.

There was too much cheese for me, it made it too salty. I would cut it down next time. Also it needed some sort of dressing. I just added a bit of balsamic vinegar.

Well, I'll be the dissenting voice.  This salad wasn't bad, but it wasn't special, either. I had it without the dressing.

This was really good! I modified a bit to make it for a holiday meal: dried cranberries instead of blackberries, and I left out the tomatoes. It was a hit!

I catered a friend's bridal shower and make this salad.  I used a combination of baby spinach and romaine lettuce.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, but that was a personal preference.  And I did not use the edible flowers.  I mixed everything together with an Italian vinagrette, and it was very good and very popular at the shower.

Very good salad.  I forgot the nuts, used raspberries and added a little fresh mint.  I topped it with a balsamic vinaigarette.  Delicious and healthy.

This is outstanding.  I made it for the ladies of my book club who all like fresh fruit and their salads with dressing on the side.  I'm more of the raw veggie salad with a pile of creamy dressing on top kind of person.  Everyone loved this and I am its biggest fan.  I used fresh from the garden cherry tomatoes, more green onion and toasted the walnuts.  Didn't use edible flowers.  I made a spicy balsamic dressing and sweetened it with about a tablespoon of honey then lightly drizzled it over everything.  It definitely is a keeper.

I had some leftover blackberries to use up, so I decided to make this recipe.  I didn’t have spinach so I used green leaf lettuce.  I eyeballed the ingredients rather than measuring and increased the onions, using two green onions for two salads.  I toasted my walnuts in a skillet with a little butter to enhance their flavor and I didn't use the optional edible flowers.  For the dressing I used Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette also from this site.  This salad was quite good and I would make it again.  I’m not sure the tomatoes worked that well in this, although they did contribute additional color.  Next time I will use strawberries instead.  Other than that I wouldn’t change a thing!  Nice recipe!

I used some of my blackberries from my bush. The salad was pretty good especially paired with the sweet cherry tomatoes. I didn't especially like it without a dressing though.  It wasn't bad, but it does need something else.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I used regular green leaf lettuce, partially defrosted frozen blackberries and instead of feta used swiss. It was still really delicious and makes a nice alteration for salad. I will definately be making this again.

Colorful salad and the flavors all went well together too. I didn't use edible flowers. I served this with a walnut vinagrette dressing. It was delicious. Thanks for a wonderful salad. I'm having this again tomorrow.

We're both adventurous eaters, but I'm sorry to say we didn't like this. It's just uninteresting--I wouldn't say it's bland, but there's no complexity or depth to the flavor. The only way I can describe it is it's all "high notes"; it needs something savory. I think it might be better with goat cheese, but I don't plan to make this again. Thanks, anyway.

I absolutely love this salad. I've found that as long as you keep the feta, spinach, walnuts, and tomatoes you can add pretty much whatever you want (chicken, blackberries, and so on). I make a balsamic vinaigrette to go on mine.

My only complaint is that everything tends to sink under the spinahc, so when you are adding the psinach make sure to kinda press it down a little bit.

I loved this salad.  I don't like salads that are really sweet, and this one wasn't, yet it was still refresing.  I left out the edible flowers, but everthing else was according to the recipe.  I dressed it with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, but I think I'll use a balsamic vinegarette dressing next time because for me, it's hard to control the amount when I use straight vinegar and I sometimes get too much.  My only complaint was the seeds from the blackberries.  At first I thought there must have been some shells in with the walnuts, but then I pinpointed it to the blackberries.  So next time I think I'll do as another reviewer suggested and use blueberries.

Great salad, although a shame it did not have a home made dressing to go with it.  I omitted the green onion (didn't have any) and used sliced almonds in place of the walnuts.  Thank you for sharing.

A simple, different yet tasty salad.  I used just a little white balsamic/olive oil dressing, and may try a raspberry balsamic dressing next time.

This was a very delicious salad that my husband & I enjoyed. I didn't have the edible flowers, but it didn't need them. You can use about any dressing you want with this salad. I liked raspberry viniagrette with it, but my husband liked blue cheese.

This was very good.  Fresh on a hot summer day!  In the salad that I made I used half raspberries and half blackberries.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I served it with raspberry vinaigrette.  The entire party loved it.

So goood. I used almonds instead of walnuts, garlic and herb feta (didnt have plain) and frozen blackberries and rasberries instead of fresh. I let the berries melt and then added to salad also with their juice. Next time I want to try to blend some berries to the juice to make it thicker.

This salad is amazing!  I add pomegranate and used a red onion cut thinly instead of green because I didn't have any on hand. Didn't need dressing and was the first dish that people came back for seconds of!

I made this for a dinner party and it ended up being the highlight of the meal. It’s a light and refreshing salad to serve with a heavier meal. Perfect combo of sweet, tart, and crunch. We served it with a raspberry walnut vinegrette.

This is a really good salad. I have a local store that sells a kinds of really good olive oils and vinegar and olive oils from all over the world. I used their blackberry and ginger vinegar and just some olive oil as the dressing and it was amazing. It also kept well for dinner the next day. I would make this again the same way.

This was quite good. I added leftover pan-seared salmon to mine to make it a meal. I just added some fresh lemon juice and olive oil to it. A great way to eat my fresh fruits and veggies from the farmers market. I'll make this again for sure!

Loved the blackberries.  Added some olive as I felt it needed it think I will put a squeeze of lemon in next time as I feel it would compliment the cheese.  I swapped the nuts for walnuts which was really great.

OMG!  This is worth 8 stars, though I opted to use dried cranberries instead of cherry tomatoes and goat cheese instead of feta.  Since I doubled the recipe, I used 3 green onions, some romaine with mostly spinach, and 1 1/2 pints of blackberries.  I served it with a peach balsamic vinegar that I had and mmmmm.....SO good and beautiful too!

Delicious!  I took this to cards last night, and it went over well.  Used pecans instead of walnuts, red onions instead of scallion, and used a balsamic vinaigrette, and the flavor combination was spot on!

I think this is good, unique salad and I've made it a few times to bring to get-togethers.  I use a candied nut (like sugary pecans, any that look good when I'm at the store) instead of the plain walnuts.

Absolutely Delish! I substituted pecans for walnuts simply because it was something that I had on hand, didn't have edible flowers (bummer) but thought this was simply fantastic. I love salads, essentially live on them and this is a perfect addition. Thank you for sharing.

Pefect! My guest were at the door so I had to scratch the green onion and I know some people don't like walnuts so I left them out!  Two of the guest were a middle schooler and high schooler and their mom from England and they loved it!  For dressing I just did extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Who would have thought that these ingredients are absolutely delicious together?  The only thing I didn't have was the edible flowers, which would look really pretty if you were serving it at a luncheon.  It's great all by itself and also wonderful with balsamic vinaigrette.  Thanks for a new and exciting salad to add to my recipe box!

I really loved this salad!  I had to rush out to buy more blackberries before the season ended.  I used raspberry/walnut vinegrette for dressing.
