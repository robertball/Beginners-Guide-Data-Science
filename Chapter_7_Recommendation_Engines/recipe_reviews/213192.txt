Great! Went really well with tortellini (white sauce) and salad. Surprisingly sweet and delicious!

We eat a lot of chicken and this is one of the best recipes I had so far. I did use Brut instead of Asti but everything else was per recipe. We all loved it! I will make this again and again.

I wouldn't make this again. It's way too sweet! The first couple bites were good but then I got sick of eating it.

Made this tonight. I admit, I did not measure everything that went in. I used baby bellas as the mushrooms and a moscato as the wine. Overall, it got good reviews. I loved it; my husband was a little leery of the sweetness. I served prosciutto tortellini with the sauce as well. The sweetness in the sauce sparkled off the savory prosciutto. I will make this again, playing with different wines.

This was delicious. The only thing I changed was that I used a regular White Wine to avoid sweetness and I added chopped onions to the mushrooms and garlic.

Tastes AMAZING when you add fruit! My favorite is strawberries! Will blow your tastebuds away! :) ...Also tastes good with buttered potatoes as a contrast.

I always find what I need.  And there's so many different choices.  It saves me from wasting food all the time.  I'm saving 5 ripe bananas today and making a cake.  I saved a bunch of extra half and half and made a custard sugar pie.    I always get compliments on my recipes  this web site has been fun, interesting, and a life saver sometimes.  Love all recipes!!
