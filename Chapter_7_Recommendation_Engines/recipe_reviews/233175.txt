This was quick to put together and very tasty. I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts, a fresh mandarin orange instead of canned and brown onions instead of red because that's what I had. I used Kraft Lite Raspberry Vinaigrette and it was delicious!

This was a tasty little salad.  I only deviated from the recipe by adding some fresh raspberries, which added nice color.  For the dressing I used Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing, by JAN W,  also found here on AR.

Tried it. Everyone loved it. I just used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.
