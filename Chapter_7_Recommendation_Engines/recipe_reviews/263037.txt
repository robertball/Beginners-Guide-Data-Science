There are 6 of us, so I used 2 lbs. beef stew meat, 4 cups of beef bone broth, 6 medium russets, and basically doubled the seasonings.  I mixed about 6 teaspoons of cornstarch with some of the broth in a small bowl when it was done, added it to the pot, and turned it on sauté to thicken it, and it was perfect!

It turned out great! I added carrots and parsnips both cut into 1 inch pieces.  I also used fresh rosemary. It was better than I expected. I took a 1/2 cup of flour, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper and put it into a gallon sized zip lock bag. I then added the cut up stew meat and shook it until the meat was covered. As I removed the meat from the bag I made sure to shake off the extra flour.  I then browned the meat on the sauté feature of the Instant Pot. This made the sauce thick and rich. It was much better this way than the original way which had a very thin broth.

10.27.18  Used stew beef instead of beef chuck and added more carrots (just because we love them).   The  Worcestershire, tomato paste, rosemary added to the beef broth created great flavor, so once the pressure went down, I removed the meat and veggies from the inner pot, turned to Saute and made some gravy, put the meat and veggies back in the pot, and reheated.  Good recipe, would make a again.

I pressured cooked for 25 minutes, then released the pressure and placed my carrots and potatoes in and cooked for 5 more minutes. I like my vegetables al dente. Turned out well, then I released and added my frozen peas and let them cook in the hot sauce. My husband loved it.

This was the first time I used the instant pot and the stew was awesome.  I doctored it up a bit with a package of onion soup mix (mixed with about a cup of water), 1 can of beef broth, some red wine, anchovies paste, herbes de Provence.   I used small round potatoes instead of Yukon because I had them  on hand.  I did have to thicken the liquid so it was less like a soup and it was delicious.  There are only two of us so I had plenty left over to freeze and have at another time.  I couldn't believe I could make something that rich in taste in only 35 minutes!

I followed the directions pretty much exactly and got a result that was pretty much what was shown.  I used one of those trays of "stew meat" from the meat department, and it turned out so tender.  I couldn't believe it.  I peeled two potatoes and didn't peel the other two as an experiment.  The un-peeled ones turned out just fine.  I wouldn't bother peeling them next time.  I cooked for 35 mins, naturally depressurize for 10, then vented.  All veggies were perfect.  The liquid is more akin to soup than stew, so I made roux and stirred in the liquid which thickened it closer to a gravy, which is a step I would recommend to anyone making this recipe.

This was the first recipe I made with my new InstantPot.  It turned out very well.  I used russet potatoes since I did not have yukons.  I substituted thyme for rosemary since I prefer it.  In the future I may use a little red wine and decrease the beef broth to enhance the flavor.  I also followed the recommendation of others and mixed 1/4 cup flour and salt and pepper in a plastic bag and shook the stew meat in it and then sauteed the meat.  The flour helped thicken the sauce.  The stew tasted even better the next day.  This is a keeper!

I cooked on Stew/Meat but only for 25 min. I was worried 35 was too long. Glad I did.  My vegetables were very soft, any longer they would have been too mushy. The meat was tender and some pieces still had a little pink to them which I like. I followed another reviewers idea and made gravy afterwards on sauté function. Lots of flavor, great recipe.

My husband is picky about beef stew and said this is the best one he's had in years! We would add at least another lb of beef and some more carrots, possibly celery, too, but the basic recipe is delicious and easy and cooks perfectly in the Instant Pot.

Excellent stew - great recipe Fioa!  I'm a little full writing this now:).

I followed some of the other recommendations (cutting veggies up into bigger chunks, and used stew meat, etc.). Great advice, everyone!  And, as someone else mentioned, I tend to add somewhere between 1.5-2x the spices including garlic, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce.  Measuring is optional, right. 

From other suggestions, I also added extra veggies (whole mushrooms cut in half, thick-cut carrots, and potatoes).  My 8 quart InstantPot had about 2-3 inches of room from the top when everything was added.  

I set the InstantPot on 'Stew' mode for 25 minutes and 10 minutes of it auto pressure release before I opened the vent.  My carrots were still moderately firm (because of the larger cuts), the potatoes were phenomenal and the venting had me drooling from the aromas.  And because I used stew meat, it was the perfect tenderness!

I also made the broth a little thicker, but not to a gravy consistency as I prefer mine somewhere between soup and gravy.  The addition of 2 beef bouillon cubes added a nice flavor as well, but I didn't add them until I thickened it up a bit on saute mode.

Not many changes to the core recipe (just more of the good stuff) and the flavor was phenomenal!

I only used 2bouillon cubes but should have used 3. Would add 1more Tblspn of tomato paste.  Would have liked the broth to be a little  thick rather than so broths.  Over  all it was good.

Thank you Fioa!  Definitely will make it again.  Unfortunately I didn't have mushrooms or rosemary.  Will try that next time.  I did make a larger version of this recipe.  I used entire 3lbs bag of yellow potatoes (cut in 1/2 or 1/4 depending if the potato was big) and entire box of beef broth (32oz).  I also placed entire trader Joe organic baby carrots at top - so they didn't get as mushy.  This made my instant pot full to max line.  So, it took a lot longer to build pressure (about 35 minutes).  And after the pot was done cooking, I let it cool naturally for 10 minutes and then opened the venting valve.  Veggies were perfect!

Very good and easy to put together.  I used a venison roast cut into chunks. I also added one stalk of celery cut into chunks a couple of bay leaves and fresh rosemary and more salt and garlic then the recipe calls for to add more flavor.  Also I added two cups of venison stalk along with the three cups of beef stock..  The liquid did not cover the veggies but was close.  Used the recommended settings and time.  The venison came out tender but the veggies were not over cooked.  Served with homemade buttermilk biscuits......to die for # :-])

Potatoes and carrots disintegrated by 2/3rds into pasty base. Still tasted OK. Recommend separating cooking times for meat and vegetables.

This was super easy to make and it had good flavor.. I have young kids who don’t like vegetables but I diced several others squash, zucchini and spinach in with it and they never even knew and my 8 yr old daughter had double helpings two nights in a row she loves it so much.. so for sure kid friendly I think =)

Made this for dinner tonight. Only changes I made was to use beef stew meat and add a bag of frozen peas at the same time I added the other vegetables. I also shook the stew meat in a ziploc bag with some flour before sauting.  Definitely a keeper.

I have avoided pressure cookers for years. I finally decided to try an electric one. The beef stew was fantastic! The meat was tender and juicy. The vegetables were not soggy. The recipe was easy to follow. I did add an extra carrot. I’ll definitely make this dish again.

Thanks to other reviews I did the following:
s&p  2/3 cup of flour, added season salt, dredged 2 lbs of stew meat in the mixture
Saute all meat, add back into pot, with 6 potatoes, 4 carrots. 3 stalks of celery, 1 chopped onion,
added beef stock, 3 Tbs worcestershire, 3 Tbs tomato paste, 3 cloves of garlic then added red wine until it almost covered everything. 
selected meat/stew on insta pot for 30 minutes. (It took 25 minutes to unpressure before I could open the lid)  Added sliced mushrooms & peas. Turned on saute for 3 minutes.
 Next time I will try with 25 minutes because it was to long for the potatoes.    LOVED the flavor!

The flavor of this stew was very good. I agree with other reviewers that it is too soup like. I added cornstarch slurry at the end of the cooking time ( 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 1/4 cup of liquid from the stew), restarted my Instant pot on sear/sauté , added the slurry and stored until it was thickened.  I don’t think the recipe needs 3 cups of broth.i think 2 cups is probably enough.

I did not add the mushrooms and I opted to brown the beef in olive oil instead of butter. 

It was AMAZING! The beef cooked so tenderly in the Instant pot. Will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested except I left out the mushrooms (husband doesn't like them). It was delicious and I will certainly make it again. I would try reducing the cooking time to 30 minutes next time as the carrots and potatoes were pretty mushy.

This was amazing! My husband is easy to cook for, but he doesn't often say "delicious". He did with this one. 
I made this in the Ninja Foodi and it turned out great. I wasn't sure the pressure temperature to use so went with "high". Next time I'll use a lower temp because some potatoes began to break down. But still amazing and definitely a do-over in my house. :-)

Easy recipe !  I didn't have tomato paste in the pantry so did without. Used cornstarch at the end cause it was more like soup and wanted to thicken it up.   Only gave it a  4 because Im not a huge beef stew fan in general. I forgot to start the crockpot in the am so decided to use the insta pot.   I would make this again.

I made a double batch, so that we would have  enough for 5 meals. We love leftovers in the winter. It was tender and juicy and so delicious.  I put in 6 different vegetables. It is better on day 2 , as gravy gets thicker. I  serve over Cuban Yellow Rice with a side salad. Amazing!!

Quick, hearty and tasty! My modifications: I omitted the mushrooms because...kids. I tossed the beef chunks in flour before browning then I deglazed the pan with dry wine. The potatoes came out much too soft, so next time I think I will cut them into larger pieces. I only cooked for 15 minutes under high pressure and the meat was fall-apart tender.

Very good stew, and very easy to make. I added 1/4 cup of Cabernet to the recipe, which added a nice flavor. Next time, I'll use 1 1/2 lb of meat, because I like my beef stew a little heartier than this.

Liked by all. I doubled the recipe and made it in the 8qt machine. It took 30 minutes before the 35 minute pressure cooking cycle started. I wanted it thicker so I added a couple of tablespoons of dissolved corn starch and let it boil on the sauté function for about 10 minutes before serving.

It was great. I added a bit of beef gravy mix at the end as I like mine more like a gravy stock.

I used 5 cups of broth instead of 3 and left out the tomato paste - why open a 6-oz can to use one tablespoon - the rest would go to waste in my kitchen.  I also used round steak instead of stew meat, and added some beef base to the broth. Beef came out tender!  I agree with others that this is better if the broth is thickened.   After mine was cooked and decompression was complete, I added 1/3 c flour mixed with a bit of water, and put it on saute until thickened.   It came out really good and cooked in a very short time.   Great with French or Italian bread for dipping.

Eccellent.  Perfect flavor.  I am making it for the second time now, and it’s no oh been about a week.  One of thosse foods you will probably crave on a regular basis.  

I made it again. This time I added three grains of allspice, a dash of thyme, and an extra clove of garlic.  I also cut the salt in half.   I used baby carrots instead of big sliced ones.  My husband said it was excellent!  He said I did a phenomenal job with it. :)

Fioa, thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Added bok choy.  Used 2 T ketchup instead of tomato paste because I didn't have any tomato paste and used green onions instead of regular onions.  My family didn't think it thickened up enough, so I added one pkg of Pioneer brown gravy mix (dissolved in 1/2 cup cold water).  My family LOVED it!

Super Easy Beef stew. I substituted Turnips and parsnips for the potato for a low carb option.

I followed the recipe as given and the stew was very good. The only change I would make would be to add some more Worcestershire sauce to give it a little more flavor. I had extra asparagus on hand and I threw that in and it was surprisingly a nice addition.  We ate it with some flat bread and it was a nice Sunday night meal. I will be making it again, no doubt.

I made it and it was wonderful!  I did use Knorr Homestyle stock beef flavor (one little bucket mixed with 2 cups of water-heated to dissolve).  Coating the beef with flour in a zip lock bag added the light gravy once the dish is done! I would recommend this to anyone.

instant pot, cooked for 35min and let rest depressure naturally (40 min). Result was very tasty but definitely overcooked. Stew seemed very overcooked. vegetables mostly reduced to broth. Need to cook shorter or forced depressure next time???
We do like the recipe and taste results.

Way too sweet because of the carrots.  Beef was not tender, and the potatoes were turned to mush.

Stew ended up being very watery, though the flavour was quite good, the runniness of the stew was offsetting.

Excellent recipe, was easy with the Instant Pot.  Used my own choices of spices instead of the rosemary and added extra vegetables at the end.  I used cornstarch to thicken the gravy before serving.

I’m just starting to use my Instant Pot and this came out great!  I didn’t have tomato paste so I substituted an individual serving of a tomato pepper soup I had on hand.  I also used a can Campbell’s cream of mushroom soup for the mushrooms.  I doubled the recipe and was able to cut back on the liquids by using “beef base:” instead of stock with half the amount of water.  Husband loved it too!

I can't say enough about how good this is!  I love the spices. I have made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe except I didn't have mushrooms or tomato paste.

The second time, I made a 2# roast and added whole peeled potatoes, extra carrots and the mushrooms. Cooked for 45 minutes. Turned out great both times!

Easy and delicious. I added red wine and a couple more potatoes and carrots.

Made broth with boullion richer than directions. Went a bit heavier on carrots and used bigger cuts. Should have done mushrooms bit smaller than halves. Very tasty and tender and rich
