I liked this recipe but I used only the green portion of the onions which is my favorite part. I didn't want to waste a whole package of ranch dressing mix for just one tablespoon so I used Penzeys garden herb mix. I love the sour cream instead of mayo tangy-ness. I also skipped the sweetener and used one red apple in place of one green apple. Just trying to make do without a trip to the store!  I will make it again!

This didn't do anything for us at all.  Between the onion and the ranch dressing mix the only thing we could taste was salty onion.  Skip the ranch and possibly the onion, and just mix some cider vinegar and black pepper to taste.  I really wanted to like this and taste the apple...but all we tasted was crunchy salted onion.
