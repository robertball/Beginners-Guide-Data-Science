This is a FANTASTIC recipe. The secret to make it perfect is: Form and freeze the dough pieces about half the size as you want the final piece. When you thaw them to room temp and let them rest a few minutes they'll stretch very very thin. Family rating is "Better than the beach!"- the ultimate compliment. Thank you Erin.

Very good and they are just like the Great Canadian Beaver tail that you get in Ottawa on the Rideau canal. My boys and their friends gobbled them up fresh - really, the only way to eat them. My only comment is to make sure you stretch them nice and thin. Squeeze fresh lemon juice on top when they are hot and then sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon. Yum! Thanks for the recipe. Give it a try!

EH! As an Ottawa native these are the best homemade i have ever had!  i like these better than rightt on the Canal because they don't freeze up as fast!  a great variation for this shape is the make balls and gently drop them into the oil then roll in the cinn~sugar mix before cooling. as a beaver tail you can be creative with the toppings as well, i have seen pretty much everything for sweet to savoury (and sometimes gross!) be inventive and have fun!  enjoy these around a campfire or around a local rink!

Really wonderful! I made these with my Home Ec class and they were a HIT!  As our deep fryer is a smaller 'home' one, this batch made more than 10.  The key is knowing how thick to make them so that they are true to those found on the Rideau Canal.  Awesome!

Perfect just like at country fairs. My kids like butter, cinnamon and sugar, and conf. sugar. WTH how many times does one have such a treat! Make sure oil is perfect temp and each side does not take long at all.

My husband made this tonight and it was the best fried dough recipe we've tried. We have gone through about 4 different kinds. We used it for Pizza as well! YUM! Love using our bread machine to make it. Ours only took 55 min. on the dough setting. Our new favorite recipe!

It was so good!  I made them for hubby and neighbors and they were a hit!  I cheated though.   I used frozen  bread dough that I had thawed.   It worked perfectly!   Thanks for  sharing.
