Awesome!!! Just like Mom used to make!!! I have never rated a recipe before but one thing I noticed with the reviews...if you are going to rate the recipe make it the way it is written. One of the previous reviewers gave it a four because she changed it all over the place and obviously thought hers was better, I looked at other reviews she has done and has done the same thing to other recioes. Review it on it's merits, not on what you think you did to make it your own!

So Good! Among my friends, I'm known for my mac and cheese, but using this recipe, I really blew their socks off. The addition of the onion really added flavor. The only thing I did differently was used different types of cheese (the secret to my mac n' cheese) I use white sharp cheddar for taste, plain yellow sharp cheddar for appearance, and hot pepper cheese for a bit of spice.

I have made this twice in the past week! Very good and don't leave out the Swiss cheese even if you think you don't like Swiss. I'm still in shock about a reviewer who took away stars because of an ingredient that she doesn't like. More frustrating is all the people who found that "helpful". For example, I don't like mushrooms, but I don't give recipes a bad review if it calls for them...I just leave them out of the recipe. Wow.  I'm in the minority here, but personally I read reviews to find out about the recipe I "click" on, not to see other people using it as a way to get their recipe "out there"...no time for that...sorry:(

I LOVE THIS MAC & CHEESE and so did everyone else who had it, even the kids.  I only tweaked it a little - I cut down on the onion to taste.  I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk and for my 3 cheeses, I used white sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, and monterey jack.   I had so many rave reviews, someone just asked me to make it for a party of 40!  Sounds easy enough!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I make this for every family gathering, only because they ask for it and it has to be the best mac and cheese I have ever made. The only thing different that I do, is omit the swiss cheese and add 8oz. of cream cheese. It's the best and richest you will ever taste.

I and millions of other people have been using Velveta for many years.  Thank you for sharing your recipe JAYDE. This is exactly how I have made mac and cheese for a long time.  With the exception of the swiss cheese (personal preference).  The Velveta turns a plain cheese sauce into a creamy cheese sauce.  I usually leave mine on the stove on low heat while cheese melts completely.  I only bake in the oven if I use cracker or bread crumbs with butter on the top.

I was looking for an easy but knock your socks off Mac and Cheese for Christmas dinner.  This was definitely it!!!!! The only thing I did different than in the recipe is I added the cheese to the white sauce and melted it in after taking off burner before adding to pasta.  I also doubled recipe.  Just for some little extra something I took tbsp of butter melted, half sleeve of saltines and three strips of crisp bacon and crumbled all together in my food processor and added to the top.  That topping was the perfect compliment to the cheeses used in the recipe.  I also made this the night before.  Next afternoon put in oven at recommended cooking temp and added about 15 minutes to cooking time, but came out perfect so definitely a dish u can prepare ahead and bake later.

This recipe is great! For those that do not like the texture of onions, try grating them. So much flavor. When I take this to potlucks, bbq's, etc., I make it up in one pot and pour into a crockpot and keep on a low setting. Do not change the ingredients for this recipe. If you do... write and submit your own. Please. Thanks JAYDE175!

Oh, YES!  This recipe turned out so-o-o-o creamy and cheesy.  I doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers and my family is really glad I did.  I highly recommend!

This was not to my liking.  I decided to change the recipe, used same amounts of everything but the cheese.  I did 2 cups of cheese (1 cup pepperjack, 1 cup cheddar) mixed into the sauce and then topped the mac and cheese with 1/2 cup of cheddar and baked.  the processed cheese food was not a good addition.  I found it was much better with just cheddar and pepperjack.

I love this mac and cheese.  I get nothing but compliments about it. At first we thought it a bit plain but we added some pepperjack, and ham and that gave it the flavor we were looking for. Wonderful recipe.

This recipe never disappoints me! I have made it several times, but I use any cheese I have on hand which is usually cheddar & montery jack. Sometimes I use a combination of half milk & half cream if I have it. Always good!

Very good base recipe!  My personal favorite, however,  must have dry mustard, nutmeg, cardamom and corriander added.  I puree a sweet onion, saute that with the butter and then add the flour for a bechamel sauce with the spices above added along with a splash of white wine.  This was a really excellent recipe for good comfort food, even though my family immediately knew it was a "new" recipe I tried on 'em.  I really love it when folks write in their own personal tastes and changes as I think it adds to the flexibility of the recipe!

Velveeta was developed in 1918.  My grandmother (born in 1912) only made her Mac and cheese with velveeta. Old fashioned? I think so!

Come on people, this is a good, solid, basic macaroni and cheese recipe. You can use what ever good melting cheeses you prefer like Provalone, Gruyere, Fontina, Mozzarella - what ever you like. If it melts well, you can use it. But with the reference to "Old Fashioned" it means that Velveeta can be uses to get that "Old Fashioned" taste and texture you can only get with Velveeta.

Everybody absolutely loved it.  I used a large bag of shredded mexican cheese and a little onion powder instead of the onion. If you double it it fits perfectly in a 13x9 pan

***update - a friend ask me for this recipe, she took it to a pot luck and won 50 bucks for the best taste competition ! Another reason to love this recipe! ***I recently took this to an Easter dinner at a friends house and got rave reviews. Friends have asked for the recipe and I have just emailed this one to them. It was simple and quick to make with a wonderful flavor.I fully expected to spend my day in the kitchen working on homemade Mac and Cheese (as I have heard horror stories) but this one is a definite keeper. Thank you !

The only reson that I did not give 5 stars is becuse I changed a few things.  I used Barilla pluss noodles, whole wheat flour, added a few dashes of hot sauce, werchester (sp?), and a small suirt of mustard.  Finally I mixed some left over provalone and munster slices.

This is the macaroni and cheese recipes I've been searching for.  Don't pass it by just because of the processed cheese it doesn't taste like velveeta.  Would be delicious with ham and peas added in or the addition of hot sauce or pepper cheese.  I made a triple batch when I was 38 weeks pregnant divided macaroni into three freezer bags, ladeled sauce on each and froze to reheat after the baby arrived.

My Mom made this recipe, it was a staple growing up.  The crusty top is yummy.  I make it for events and change it up with cheeses EXCEPT I always put Velveeta in the mix.  YUM!

Turned out very good.  I used some bacon fat as butter and bacon bits also.  Used swiss, velvetta, and cream cheese. Grated parmesean on top with crushed ritz crackers and a pinch of smoked paprika.  I also mixed in some imitation crab meat and baked in individual crocks.  I hope this inspires you to tweak this recipe to your cupboard and likes.

Instead of processed cheese, many super market delis sell american cheese ends (the end peices of the blocks of cheese) for $1.99 to $2.99 lbs.  Not only is this affordable, Its great for recipes. American cheese melts beautifully to create a tasty and creamy cheese sauce,  I use it in my other mac & cheese recipes as well.

Delicious (with my few alterations)!  As another reviewer suggested I switched out the Swiss cheese for cream cheese.  I also didn't understand the reasoning behind layering this like lasagna.  With my milk mixture still hot, I melted in the cheese food and cream cheese.  I then stirred all ingredients together in the baking dish.  I did not add add the "small pats of butter" either.  Why all the butter when you have the cheese?!!!

This was good!  I added an extra tablespoon of flour and I think next time I'll mix the white sauce in with the macaroni instead of just pouring it on top.

Very good basic Mac and Cheese recipe but was wondering what the forth cheese was! The title said use 4 cheeses but only 3 in the recipe. The change I made was to crumble one link of Chorizo sausage into the cream sauce.

This mac and cheese was amazing. I didn't layer it I just mixed everything together and I topped it with three tablespoons of bread crumbs. The onion gives it amazing flavor. My husband wasn't thrilled about having Mac and cheese until he tried it. He polished off the whole pan. Great recipe!

FINALLY!! A mac and cheese recipe my entire family can agree on!!!! My husband and I like one thing, my kids like another. This recipe solved the dilemma! It is easy to make, and delicious. Even my very particular brother in law admitted it was "pretty good." (high praise, I can assure you!) The one change I make is to omit the onion and add some onion powder to the bechamel. We all felt the raw onion was too harsh. I would have simply sauteed them, but the littles can detect the presence of onions in any food, lol, so as a compromise, I used the powder. That satisfies everyone. Thanks so much for sharing this-now it is the one mac and cheese recipe EVERYONE asks me to make!!

This was okay, i make my own quite often, and normally what i do is when i cook the butter and flour together i generally add velveeta to that until it all melts into a cheese sauce. Then i mix the shredded cheese and the noodles together, and pour the cheese sauce over it as a binder. It seems to work a bit better than this recipe, and is super cheesy

This recipe has been around awhile but it remains a great one. I enjoy using different types of cheese just to change the flavor a little. I leave out the salt and pepper, but that's my personal taste. For a south of the border experience I some times use some of my homemade jalapeno salsa. That really spices things up and adds a little color to the dish. By the way, if someone wants salt and pepper they can add it before eating, there is a ton of salt in the cheese.

I used 16 oz of "mac and cheese" shredded mix (cheddar, swiss, american) which made it a simple and tasty dinner.

I've been making this for years! However I take out the swiss and use a mixture of velveeta, mild cheddar, and vermont extra sharp cheddar cheese. In the white sauce I also add a dash of powdered mustard and a dashof worchester sauce. Excellent!!

Super one, hearty and delicious. In Egypt we add minced meat in the middle layer. That is we put a layer of the macaroni at the base of the pan, a layer of minced meat with onions (pre-cooked) and the a top layer of macaroni. On top of all we add the sauce and cheese and bake.
Thank you

Great recipe! This is the exact recipe I have used for a while to make macaroni and cheese at home, it's always a hit and tastes soooo much better than anything you can buy! Make sure to let the flour brown once you have whisked it into the butter to develop some great flavor!

So far this is my favorite mac and cheese.  The only thing I do different is I use only cheddar cheese.  I always have cheddar cheese on hand, don't always have swiss and I don't like processed cheese.

I've been making homemade mac & cheese for over 20 years using the same recipe but this recipe may replace it. Absolutely delicious! I did change it slightly by using pepper jack in place of the 'processed cheese food' and lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk. I also cut up a ham steak and layered that in as well. It was a hit. Next time I may omit the pats of butter on top as I had to add some crushed crackers for the last 10 minutes of baking to soak up the butter. Although that did make a nice tasty crust on top.

Made this for my husband and two picky pre-teens and we all agreed it was a make-again. I liked the blend of three cheeses. Very good flavor. I sprinkled some crumbled Saltines on top mid-way through baking because my mother in law does that and my husband likes the cracker topping. Delicious!

Superb, creamy moist.  Loved it.  Cooked it covered at 350 degrees as the recipe said, for 45 minutes, but it did not brown on top, so I removed the cover and cooked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and browned up the top a bit, then it was perfect.

I love this recipe. The only thing I did different is that I added some chicken bouillon to the white sauce for just a little more flavor. I was concerned about the minced onion but it ended up being my favorite part of the overall flavor!

This is very similar to my late Mom's macaroni and cheese recipe. To make it creamier, you need to cut back on the cheese a little. I would use a little less Swiss cheese, which tends to be a bit dry. Also we always baked it for just half an hour in a two quart casserole.

I grew up on this type of mac 'n cheese (have never been a fan of the box type).  What I do while the macaroni is cooking is to chop up the onion, tomatoes and a couple rashers of bacon.  Fry the bacon until crispy, remove from pan and discard the bacon fat, then with a little bit of coconut oil I fry the onion until translucent and then add the skinned tomatoes and the bacon.  Then make up the dish as per Jayde's recipe.  This is so yummy and guests keep coming back for more.

YUM!!!  Quick, easy and so much more delicious than a cardboard box mac & cheese.  I added buttered parmesan breadcrumbs when I baked it just to up the yum factor.

Really good, made exactly as recipe stated.  Net time I will try putting the cheese in the milk mixture as I would get clumps of the different cheeses.  Thanks for posting!

This was not good - I made it exactly as it is written here and the cheeses curdled and the flavor wasn't very good.  I'm going to continue my search for the worlds best mac and cheese because I can't figure out why this one was rated so well.

This recipe was allright, but for me there was too much butter. It was a bit oily and greasy. I followed the recipe exactly, except left out the onions as my kids don't like that vegetable. I would use 2 tablespoons in the milk sauce, use less milk, and not put butter over the top next time.

I melted the cheese with the milk mixture and mixed in with the macaroni before baking. Then, i added some extra cheese and about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs to the top before baking. Very good!

i liked this, the swiss adds a nice flavor. it came out grainy though, not totally creamy. every baked mac and cheese i've tried is grainy, so i think i'll do this as a stove top only recipe, and just combine all and eat it, because the sauce is smooth before baking and i really like this.

Just like my grandmother used to make!  Never could get my mac & cheese casserole baked to compare anywhere near as tasty as hers, but this recipe helped me edge closer to her prize winning dish.  It's a keeper in our family.  Thanks Jaydene!

This is really great, being the cheese freak that I am, I added a bit mroe cheese to my liking. I also used sharp cheddar rather than colby.  I was very satisfied and will definitely make it again.

Just like my grandma used to make! Been trying to copy hers unsuccessfully. Think the trick was the white sauce. Grandma' s recipe was just milked poured over top and mine just wouldn't set. Took my white sauce quite some time to come to a boil but it was worth the wait. Think there can be some flexibility with cheeses used, my grandma used to use the big block of government cheese which I used to think was processed cheese but now I think it was actually American cheese. Definitely a keeper!

excellent comfort food. I don't have access to processed cheese so just used more of what is on hand. My tweak in order to make it like mom is to add crumbled fried southern style sausage. yummy. lots of fresh pepper on top. I actually use Toulouse sausage these days due to no JimmyD at the local supermarket.French twist on an American crowd pleaser

Thid is the best recipe!  The only thing that I added was to brown up some smoked bacon,sauted the onion in the bacon grease and removed with a slotted spoon.  Put the sauted onions and bacon between the two layers of pasta and cheese.  We feed a group of about 45 teens at the local youth center once a month and this was a huge hit!

WONDERFUL!!! This recipe was fabulous!  It even pleased my pickiest eater. I believe the onions gave it a gourmet taste - very different from any other I have tried.  Now, I hate it when people change ingredients and then rate it. Sadly, I will now do just that, but I believe that the ratios in the original recipe are what make it a success. I only had available 1/2 pound of Colby Jack cheese and 1/4 pound of Cheddar cheese so I used them.  I also added about 1/8 tsp of dried mustard to the butter/flour/milk portion. Originally, I was looking for a mac and cheese recipe with a crunchy topping.  I found this recipe, made the above changes and added 6 crushed Club Crackers (Garlic Flavor) to the top.  Baked as directed and was it ever delicious!  This recipes is a keeper.

Awesome!!! Thank you Jayde & all the other reviewers that contributed HELPFUL hints. I, like others, believe if you are going to change a receipe so it is nothing like the one posted...don't bother - be brave enough to submit your own receipe so people can do to your receipe what you do to others. If you are going to review a receipe make it as written, then review it, if you make changes after that so be it...then I'll appreciate your feedback...prior to that I don't place any merit on your feedback.

Sooooo delicious! Just what I was looking for. I'm not a big swiss cheese fan, but you definitely do not want to substitute anything for the swiss, you can taste its importance in this dish. Thank you so much for this great mac n' cheese recipe!!

This was my first attempt at making homemade mac and cheese, and I loved it!  I think I waited so long to try making homemade because I was intimidated a bit.  This recipe was very clear and simple to follow!  I also liked that there weren't a hundred different ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I was a little leery about the Swiss cheese because I'm not a big fan. You can't tell Swiss cheese was added, and it tasted great. 1 out of 3 kids ate it (that's typical though), and my husband enjoyed it, but he said he would give it 3 stars.  Since I'm the cook and the boss, I give it 5 stars anyway.

I have made this recipe numerous times & love it. I do add the cheeses into the cream mixture. Makes it much simpler than layering. I also take off the alum foil about 10 minutes before its done to brown the edges. I like sliced tomatoes on top too. My family loves it, thanks so much for sharing.

This was really good and I really enjoyed it!
This was my first time making home made Mac and Cheese (I'm 14 and it was really simple to make), I don't see how you could get this recipe wrong.  Some people had regrets about using onion and I wasn't going to use it but decided to try it and I really liked it.  I didn't use Cheddar or swiss cheese, instead I used a mozzerella and it tasted great!

I felt like it didn't taste cheesy enough and more of a onion casserole. It was ok, but definitely prefer a cheesier mac and cheese

Wow!  This is so easy and is one of the BEST Mac and Cheese recipes that I have ever had.  I did saute the onions in  butter whilel making the cream sauce only because they were so strong.  However, kept the rest of the recipe the same.  It was delicious, my family LOVED it and I will definitely make it again.

I made this for part of our Christmas dinner, 2011.   I substituted Montery Jack for the Velveta and omitted the onions.  It was awesome and a big hit.  It was different from Grandma's "recipe" and I heard a few "I like this recipe better".  I was just glad it came out okay.  Use your imagination on the cheeses, ingredients and etc.  This is a good basic recipe to start from.  Make your own memories.  I will be using this next year for sure!!!

This tastes just like the mac and cheese I remember eating at Sunday dinners as a child. It was a big hit on Thanksgiving this year. It didn't last 20 minutes and I made a big batch! I used Velveeta for my processed cheese, sharp cheddar, and cream cheese since I'm not a swiss cheese fan. I also melted the cheese in the roux after it came to a boil rather than pouring the white sauce over the cheese and macaroni.  Fabuloso!!! I was reluctant to add the onions because I was afraid they would be too strong, but I sauted them until soft (around 3 minutes) and they really add to the flavor. I think dried onions or powder would probably work well too. You could add some cubed up ham or turkey ham, or bacon if you're feeling extra decadent. Thanks for sharing Jayde!

This dish is yummy!  I made it for a mac n cheese cook off and won 1st place!!  I did modify it a bit.  I made 1 1/2 batches of the cheese sauce and reserved the 1/2 batch for the topping.  I only baked mac n cheese for 20 mins, then topped it with remainig cheese.  I made a cracker crumb mixture of 1 roll of Ritz crackers crumbled mixed with 1/2 stick melted butter and added 1tsp of minced garlic to crackers and topped mac n cheese.  Bake another 10 mins.  It was cheesy and creamy with a little crunch from the cracker topping.

Great basis for a recipe I will definitely make again with a few changes.  Next time I will omit the onions (didn't care for the texture).  I also think I'll use more of the Velveeta Cheese and might throw in a few ounces of cream cheese.  Another reviewer suggested some hot sauce - something else I might try if the lack of onions makes the flavor too bland.

5 Stars!  Made this for my Thanksgiving dish to share and everyone loved it.  I put fresh broccoli in the boiling noodle water the last couple of minutes and added to the dish.  Didn't have Swiss so used fresh mozzerella.  Very good, thanks for sharing.

This was my FIRST time making mac and cheese from scratch. This recipe made it taste like I have been making this for years. I loved it. I did add a teeny tiny bit of sugar and truffled salt to the recipe and left out the "cheese food". I was considering using Campbell's cheese soup instead of the processed cheese but I was only making enough for 2 and didn't want to waste the can.  I saved this recipe and will make it again.

THANKS JAYDE FOR SHARING!!

This is fabulous- everyone I have served it to- loves it. The bashing on this is messed up. Velveeta ups the creamy factor and the onion and swiss give it an extra special something. Salt and Pepper to taste and it's fab. 

This is my go to recipe.
Thank you again!

This is a very good, grown-up mac 'n cheese! Good-bye boxed stuff. I cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us. I followed the recipe ingredients however I need more flour to make a paste for the white sauce. I also did a short cut and added the onion, salt, pepper and cheeses to the white sauce and then added the elbow macaroni; mixed it all together and baked for 30 min. Yumm.

I was disapointed with this...I made the sauce exactly as written but I did not use the processed cheese.  Maybe that was the problem?  I used shredded cheddar american and jack. While I think the onion did add some flavour it was not creamy.  It was goey and chunky despite the fact that the white sauce was smooth. If I try this again I will increase the milk, mix it with the macaroni instead of pouring it over the top and make sure velveeta is one of the cheeses I use.

Yummy! I didn't have the three cheeses so I used half pound of shredded sharp cheddar and six slices of American cheese instead. My white sauce didn't soak into the bottom layers of the macaroni so I stirred it after taking it out of the oven and it was a wonderful, creamy, delicious mac and cheese. Hubby loved it - even ate what I couldn't finish on my plate. I will definitely make this again...and again...and again :)

I'm not a mac-n-cheese fan, but I love this so that is really saying something!  One caution is to ignore the instruction of, "until a cream colored paste forms."  Never formed, only burnt despite constantly stirring.  Third attempt I just whisked it for a minute and then added the milk and it worked great.  I also just used a Mexican shredded cheese blend for convenience and it was perfect.

Just made this recipe for my son's kindergarten thanksgiving party. Here are some small changes that I feel saved some time. After adding milk to the butter and flour mixture I added a 1/2 tablespoon of onion powder (I didn't use fresh onion as I thought the kids would think it was too harsh!) then I added the velveeta cheese and melted it and brought the mixture to a boil. I then took it off the heat and added the remaining cheese and stirred until all melted together. I didn't think the kids needed the extra butter so since I left it off I also didn't see a need to pop this in the oven. WOW. Does this Mac and cheese taste good. I have made my share of Mac and cheese in my days but this recipe is THE. BEST. HANDS. DOWN. The onion flavor is very subtle and adds an extra layer of oomph to this. My husband can't stand Mac and cheese but he has already eaten two big bowls of it! I can't wait until I try this recipe with fresh onion so I can have it all to myself!

This recipe is awesome.  Turns out creamy and smooth.  The onion added a great flavor.  My only change was that I added a teaspoon or so of yellow mustard that I heard about from other recipes.  The mustard adds a very slight tang.  This will be my keeper recipe for mac and cheese!

This is a great basic, old-fashioned macaroni and cheese recipe. I must address those reviews where someone substantially changes things up and then complains that the recipe wasn't good. Maybe *your* recipe wasn't good, but what you made wasn't the original recipe. Like another reviewer mentioned, I want to see what people think of the actual recipe I'm interested in -- not read their complaints about their own changed-up version. I wouldn't dream of giving a recipe a poor rating when I substantially changed it. I'd have sense enough to realize the problem may have been MY changes. I wish there were a down-vote button so we could designate those type reviews unhelpful.

This recipe was delicious, I used shell macaroni and I did add some dry mustard, a sprinkle of Cheyenne pepper and a package of chopped crab and I also  doubled the recipe as well. It was very creamy & cheesy. I also topped it with a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and dotted it with butter. I also sauteed the onion & minced garlic in the butter before adding flour and melted the cheeses in the hot sauce before mixing with cooked shells. My hubby and friend loved it too. I will definitely make this again.

Rating this a '5' although I prefer my Mac & Cheese with a a bit more complex a flavor. After the first few run-throughs, I greatly increased the % of cheddar and its sharpness (Cabot's "Seriously Sharp"). Have also added garlic & 1/2 tsp of half sharp paprika, topping the dish with Panko crumbs dusted with sweet paprika. Nevertheless, still a delightful recipe in its original formulation.

I made this for company since it was so highly reviewed and was greatly disappointed.  I found it very bland and while I love onion, the fact that it wasn't sauteed made it stand out as tasting raw.  I would make it again but would greatly add flavor with more salt, pepper, garlic, and by sauteing the onion.

This is so good.  Mac and cheese is one of my all-time favourites anyway, and this version is as good as it gets.  I never have Swiss cheese, so I just use grated Mozzarella instead, and it tastes great.  First time I made this I baked it according to the recipe, but it came out way too dry for me.  The second time I didn't bake it at all, and I loved it, but the hubby missed the brown baked bits.  So next time hopefully we can find the happy medium.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect.  I love the blend of three different cheeses, which made it not too sharp.  And the small bit of onion gave it a little something extra.  Great recipe!!

Perfect. The only change i make on occasion is to add crumbled cooked bacon and omit the swiss cheese (use 1/2 pound cheddar/colby mix), just personal preference.  As is, it is excellent as well.

This recipe was a hit!  Everyone liked it. :-)  Sure glad I tried it. I did add holiday left over ham, parmesan cheese & bread crumbs. My son suggested we incorporate grilled jalapenos next. We will be having this dish again for sure!

Love it.  I melt the butter & saute the grated onion with that.  I use about 1 pound of cheese (don't like to waste it) & add about 1/4 cup more of milk to compensate for the extra cheese.  Sprinkle the top with bread crumbs.  It is the Best !!

Sounds good.  I make my sauce with a little fresh grated Nutmeg and a little Paprika.  Really gives it a great taste.  I don't add the processed cheese, but do put a little cheese in the sauce.  It makes it so yummy. - Laura

This was excellent.  Even my husband, who doesn't like macaroni and cheese, enjoyed it.  I used shallots instead of onions for a milder flavor and substituted about half of the Swiss cheese with smoked Gouda (just because I ran out of Swiss and had a tiny piece of Gouda that needed to be used).  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe.  Reminds me of a recipe I made as a new bride that I fond in the Better Home and Garden cookbook.  That one called for onion as well, but I left it out because to me, onion and macaroni and cheese do not go together.  JMHO.  Otherwise, great recipe.

This was a hit. Did not have Swiss so used additional cheddar. Skipped the onion because of children eating it. Will make again. No need for additional salt if using the processed cheese food. That will add all the salt you need. Very easy and tasty recipe.

I gave this recipe four stars because I added garlic and onion powder, salt, pepper, paprika and 8 oz of cream cheese to the roux. 
This made it tasty, and I didn't need to add salt to the layers, just pepper for added flavor. I didn't add Swiss cheese. 
I would suggest that you add the creamy sauce between layers for added flavor.

Tum tum is happy. That's what it would be saying if it were a three year old, at least. This mac was pretty tasty. It was cheesy and delicious. Only think I would change next time is a little less onion, it was just a bit much for me. The stuff still somehow vaporized into all of our stomachs and there were no leftovers.

I was expecting velvetta type mac and cheese. This was nothing like that. It didn't taste bad, just not what I was going for and a lot thicker than I like.

Had some cheese left from Christmas and this recipe called for so I made it. Not as good as my usual mac and cheese recipe but good enough for 4 stars. And the end of the Christmas leftovers are gone so that is a big plus

Really good recipe. I used the advice of the other reviews and added pepper jack cheese to spice it up!  I also didn't have much milk on hand so I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk. Still came out good!

Good recipe, except that the cheese and the white sauce don't mix well when layered and baked.  The second time I used this recipe, I mixed the cheeses with the white sauce first before pouring it in with the macaroni.  The sauce was creamier and didn't have curdled sections from the white sauce.

Great recipe except the onions.. I felt like they over powered the dish and word to the wise skip them if serving kids. My girls eat the layer till the onion taste kicks in. Next time I'll skip onion too

I loved this mac 'n cheese! and so did my Church!  Shortly after a wind storm, the electricity had been out for a number of days, and on that following Sunday, I made this for a luncheon at the Church for 40 people, it was so cold outside (for Southern California), this was a GREAT comfort food for all .  Thank you so much to JAYDE175! 

The only item I changed was the processed and/or Velveeta cheese, I do not like either one of them and used 1 pound of sharp chedder grated cheese (I like my mac and cheese, cheesy).  I love the swiss cheese (one of my favorite cheeses). I omitted the onion. I am making it again (as a request) for another Church function.

This turned out really good.  I did two things different.  Instead of mixing the onion in close to the end, I sauteed my onion with the butter and before I mixed it with the flour to make the sauce.  For my 'processed cheese food' I used ricotta cheese.

I never met a mac & cheese I didn't like--until now.  This was the worst mac & cheese I've ever had.  I should have known better by simply reading the ingredients and instructions.  Processed "fake" cheese in the recipe.  And pouring the milk & flour mixture on top of the recipe instead of mixing it in??  It didn't sound right, but I thought I'd give it a try.  Big mistake!

Super good, a classic recipe!

I omitted the swiss and had to add some extra milk and some butter while it was cooking because it seemed a bit dry for my taste...so check it midway through...but even so, this was delish!

Okay...I was just wondering, the description states it consists of four cheeses as well as a creamy white sauce.  Yet, there are only three cheeses listed (processed, cheddar and swiss). So, I will try it with adding Jack. I would love to know what the fourth cheese the creator actually used....yum!

I made this dish to accompany the Easter ham.  I used the cheese I had on hand - colby jack and cheddar.  It was good, though I will try a different mac and cheese recipe next time.  This recipe just seemed to be missing a little something...

Great recipe. Made it for Christmas dinner and the family loved it. Will be a keeper for our family. The only change I made was substitue sharp and mild cheddar for the swiss cheese. Didn't think the kids would like the swiss. I used velveeta for the processed cheese food.  The white sauce diffinitely made it nice and creamy. Loved it.

This recipe is really great and pretty simple too.  The white sauce adds a nice touch of creaminess.  I also don't like the texture mac n cheese takes on many times when reheated, but this was great re-heated.  It was perfect for work lunches!  I didn't make any changes to it.  Hubby loved it too.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This dish baked up beautifully.  I had high hopes.  And, it wasn't bad.  But, the flavor was a bit bland.  After one bite, everyone reached for the salt shaker.  Once they added the salt, they all said it was good.  But, it didn't wow them.  I think that adding a splash of Tabasco or hot sauce or hot pepper jack cheese like some reviewers have suggested would solve that issue.  I'll make this again and try to spice it up.

I have made this a long time. I soften the onion in the butter and flour though! It is sooo good. I just use velvetta block cheese though. On occasion I will use any leftover ham (cubed) from a previous dinner.

AWESOME recipe!! I didn't have any all-purpose flour, so I substituted WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, but other than that it still came out AMAZING!! I made it this past Saturday for an "All Time Favorites" Potluck dinner at my church-they LOVED IT! In fact, I was LUCKY to get some, as there was barely any left by the time my team, and I were finished serving. DEFINITELY going to be making this again/from now on!

This was a very easy recipe to make and it was delicious! I have tried several other Mac-n-cheese recipes that had more expensive cheeses and other things but this has been the best yet. My whole family loves it, and believe me if they didn’t truly love it they would say so.

Really good and so easy!  I have a recipe that I've been using for years, for mac and cheese but it calls for a can of either cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup which I didnt have on hand.  I found this recipe and I must say I was a little nervous at first because my family actually likes "my" mac and cheese.  But to be honest, this was great!  I did add buttered Panko breadcrumbs, but thats because I like them lol.  Not sure anyone noticed the difference

This was a really good recipe. I liked the Swiss cheese and onions. I softened the onions a little in some butter, and didn't do the layering method. Just melted the cheeses into the warm milk/ flour.  Next time I'll add a little more Velveeta for more creaminess and flavor. Also added a sleeve of crushed Ritz browned in butter for a little crunch on top.

I made this recipe as stated, except used more cheddar instead of processed cheese,  and a couple of poached diced chicken breast halves. It was a hit. Several of my family thought it had a bit much onion taste, but they still liked it. The sauce was quite thick and sat on top of the casserole. I might add a bit more milk next time.

Too cheesy not enough pasta. If I make this again it will be with 4 cups pasta and 2/3 of the amount of cheese used.

 First time around i added some garlic before putting into oven along with some cooked peas/beef  and turned out tasty besides the too much cheese/not enough pasta

It was delicious but definitely needs less time in the oven (about 10 minutes) & more liquid, turned out a little dry.

Made this many times and one of our favorite go-to meals. Easily a 4.5 star recipe based on the original recipe. We have been making this for years. I came back update my review to rave more. 04/25/18.

Great as is but also a great recipe that you can tweak to your liking. Easy to change the cheeses and make it your own. We don't use 'cheese food' in our house so we use any other cheese we want which adds a fun twist every time we make this.

I have made this dish twice. We did not like the additional onion flavor the first time and it was two bland the second time. I might try a third time and cut the onion in half?

Oh.....my.....gosh!! This recipe was amazing! I followed directions exactly, except I didn't have shredded swiss cheese, so I used shredded three cheddar (vermont, sharp and cheddar) cheese instead. Amazing dish. My husband and son came back for seconds. Happy Thanksgiving!!!

Delicious, now a staple in my house.  We make it exactly as written but sub broccoli for onion and use at least 1/2 cup of it.  Great way to get my toddler to eat some veggies!  It's easy for her to pick up herself (Baby lead weaning...)

I've prepared this recipe twice now. The first time I made it exactly as stated. The second time I did not have any Swiss cheese. Both of the times that I made this it was completely devoured by my guests. This Thanksgiving we were traveling so I needed a recipe with a few ingredients but a great taste. This was a hit! I was relieved because bad mac and cheese at an African American thanksgiving will get you  excommunicated and your "black card" would be permanently revoked.

I make this once every couple of weeks. It is my boyfriends favorite dish I make. I've played around with different cheeses, including pepper jack or spicier cheeses. All of them taste great! 

I had never made homemade mac and cheese before so I did my research to make sure I didn't pick a bad recipe. This one was perfect!

My husband is really picky about macaroni and cheese and usually doesn't like it homemade, but this reminded him of his grandma's Mac n cheese which he raves about :) it was a big winner for our house, made exactly as stated except I put the processed cheese in the sauce.

That was really good. Instead of the processed cheese that was mentioned, I substituted it for pepper jack cheese. I also added real bacon bits and cilantro to give it some extra kick.

Good recipe, will make again. I didn't care for the Swiss cheese so I will likely omit it next time and double up on the cheddar. I left the onion out because I was making this for a potluck and not everyone likes onions. I found that 45 minutes was way too long to bake it, it dried everything out. 10 or 15 minutes would have been plenty long enough. But good recipe overall.

I had to make minor changes so as to use what ingredients I had on hand.  I used about two and a half cups of uncooked medium shells instead of elbow macaroni, skim milk, and a half a pound of reduced fat mild cheddar cheese only.  I mixed everything together rather than layering as the recipe specifies.  I also did not put butter on the top before baking, but I did crush some Garlic and Cheese Croutons, which I sprinkled on top during the last 15 minutes or so of baking.  I only needed to bake for about 30 minutes before hot and bubbly.  Delicious!

Made this with gluten free noodles and was delicious!! Yes-add the Swiss, gives it a mildness and the onions add such a nice flavor...I am also sure any type/combo of cheese would be great...thanks for this great recipe!!

This recipe is fantastic!! Creamy, cheesy and the onion adds nice flavour and is not overwhelming. The only thing I did differently was I added melted the butter pats and mixed in Italian breadcrumbs and crumbled it over the top. It was Not necessary but it added some more flavour.

I was dissapointed with the lack of flavor in this mac and cheese.  It seemed that the sauce made it quite runny rather than the rich cream I like to see when making mac and cheese.

Good, but I'm looking for great. I admit though I used jack instead of swiss since I don't like it. But what I didn't like mostly was the onion. I used less, but should have skipped altogether or just done a bit of onion powder.

Loved this dish! Based on others reviews, sautéed the onions, doubled the velveeta and melted it with the roux, and mixed the elbow mac with the swiss, cheddar cheese. Tossed in some diced ham. Topped with buttered panko and broiled at the end. Very delicious and my little guys tummies were happy!

This recipe is amazing and would be perfect as is... However I made a few changes, mostly to get rid of what I had at home. My three cheeses were the velveeta, cheddar, and Swiss. I also added 1/2 cup Monterey Jack for a kick. I added a little more onion (because we like our onions) but did fry it up beforehand so the taste wouldn't be overbearing. I also fried up some Italian sausage and layered that in addition to a can of peas (I had to throw a vegetable in here somewhere)! You couldn't even taste the peas! Then I sprinkled with approx 1/4-1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs. It turned out awesome!!! The dish was done when the timer went off, but I added a few minutes on broil to add a hardened surface. Everyone loved it and had seconds, and thirds! No leftovers here!

Give a man a batch of M&C and he'll be grateful, or in my case I'll grovel at your feet. Teach a man to make his own (not difficult) M&C and you'll save time or money and make him independent from you for that dish. Maybe that's not the correct quote...guess it was something about fish. This is a great recipe for any age group to learn about experimenting with cheeses etc. Make it as is and you can't lose. Play with spices, cheeses, add ham, chicken or prawns, sky is the limit. I use the harder to find 2% Velveeta, might add reduced fat cream cheese. The tough part of M&C is the calories. Often I add chopped broccoli, mushrooms etc to get some veggies into the mix. My Mom's simple M&C was always my birthday dinner...and often I talked a sister into it.

This had a great cheese flavor, but the next time I might try it with some dry mustard powder.

God Bless this recipe! I have never made home made mac and cheese as the parents and in-laws seem to always get that task. Finally having the opportunity to make a dish, I gave this one a go.I followed the directions and my whole family raved. It was moist and excellent flavor. It was even great the next day, not dry like some others. I can not wait to make again. TY : )

We really enjoyed this, altho initially it doesn't taste like a traditional mac & cheese. It was much better(to us) the 2nd day.

I made this as a side for Christmas Day (thought it would be the kid friendly option!) but ALL the adults loved it too- I only had two small changes- I only used Swiss & cheddar and skipped the processed cheese all together (mostly because we did not have it) and I sprinkled a few bread crumbs on top. I really think making it in a 9x13 baking dish is a good idea- don't  try and layer it in a smaller pan- I think it throws off the consistency and you may end up burning the bottom of the pan to get it hot all the way through

This was very good.   I did change some things.   I used the cheese I had on hand, which was 8 ounces of cream cheese and cheddar.  I made the white sauce and put the cheese in that....then combined it with the macaroni.   
Sprinkled with bread crumbs and baked.   Reminded me of what my mom use to make

So this was part of a huge potluck and let me tell you this did not last one hour in a 9x12 pan. I used Swiss, Cheddar, Velveeta, and 1 cup of Cream Cheese, and mix the cheese together. The feedback was extremely positive and I have been inspired to make this again quite soon. This was amazing to offer, delicious to eat, and relatively easy to prepare. Be prepared to be wow'd by your guests. Bon Appetit!

I made this exactly as written and I LOVED it.  The flavors just meld together perfectly and the onion adds an extra flavor that I wasn't sure would help, but it did!  Great mac and cheese.  I agree with a few others here about ratings.  Please, if you're going to rate a recipe then make as written.  It does no one any good if you're going to substitute left and right and then say it didn't taste good.  Or if you don't like onions, skip this recipe, obviously it's not for you!  This will be my only Old Fashioned Mac and Cheese recipe going forward.  I can't believe how good this came out.  I had tried so many mac and cheese recipes on here and none were up to par for me.  But this one?  It ROCKS!!!!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

I have made several versions of mac and cheese because it is my husband's favorite food but this is the best yet. I even liked it and mac and cheese is not my favorite. Excellent recipe.

It was very good and everyone enjoyed it. My daughter says it was gooey and delicious. Next time I will probably check and take out 3-5 minutes sooner so it is moister.

This M&C has a strange after taste, it is a combination of grease from butter and all kinds of cheese?  I had to have a strong coffee to refresh my mouth.  I had changed the recipe a bit by omitting the processed cheese and used extra sharp cheddar, maybe it was because of that?  Also I'm not sure about pouring the sauce over, rather as many people say, I would mix it into the macaroni.  The problem was, when I poured the sauce over the macaroni, it still cooked the macaroni, so the texture of macaroni was some part too soft, and some part not that soft, as pouring doesn't go even over the macaroni.  Also, I would add some seasoning (at least salt & pepper) to the cream, and would add some cheese and something else for added flavor, maybe a bit of mustard or sour cream?  Not sure, but the cream appeared tasteless to me.

DELICIOUS! This has become my new way of making mac and cheese! I changed the recipe a little by adding the velveeta cheese to the flour and butter "rue" mixture which created a nice cheese sauce to pour over the top, in addition to adding the shredded cheeses as stated. I didnt use the foil until almost to the end of cooking time to get a nice brown top. My family absolutely LOVED it! Will be making again and again and again..... Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe because it was the recipe of the day, and let me tell you this recipe was fantastic! I didn't have elbow macaroni, so I substituted penne, and instead of cheddar, swiss, and cheese food, I used a cheese blend that I had on hand! I also added bread crumbs to the top to add a little something extra! This recipe is fantastic and I would make it again!

Great comfort food dish. I didn't have the processed cheese on hand so we used more Swiss & Cheddar cheese, which worked very well. Next time I will exclude the onion or cook seperately as it was not fully cooked at the point that the rest of the dish was ready to be removed from the oven.

I made this recipe twice over the weekend for two different events and got great compliments both times. I did not add onion due to personal preference and I melted the cheese into the white sauce because it wasn't all already shredded, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I saw one review that said that she mixed it together and served it from the stove top. I tried it before baking it and thought it tasted okay, but after baking it was delicious. I've never made macaroni and cheese with processed cheese because it doesn't really appeal to me but it does make a difference. 

This is a basic macaroni and cheese recipe. I'll probably experiment with other cheese combinations to see what I can create. I love feta and think a little might give it the extra kick I really love.

I made this last nite, and it was yummy. I followed the recipe but after covering the bottom with macaroni I added cooked mild sausage and diced ham, then pouring half the cheese sauce, then finishing it with more macaroni and cheese sauce. What a meal. Wow

This is the first "from scratch" Mac n cheese recipe I've ever tried and I was amazed at how easy it was! I've made it twice already, once with bacon added and the second time topped with those fried onions you can buy at the grocery. Loved it both ways! Definitely going to make it again and again :-)

This is by far the BEST mac & cheese I've ever made... and I've tried a lot of different recipes over the years! My large family of 8 agrees unanimously (even though most of them would say they hate swiss cheese)!! It is creamy and cheesy without being overpowering, and the balance of cheeses is excellent. And unlike some of the reviewers, we felt the addition of onions was wonderful.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I added fresh minced garlic and a little dry mustard powder to the roux mixture, and I did NOT add extra butter pats after layering all the ingredients.  I used 2% processed cheese food and low-fat milk to cut down on the fat content somewhat.  Only one caution: this recipe states that it serves 6-8, but I DOUBLED the recipe and there was only a spoonful left after the 8 of us were done.  Of course, that includes 4 teenagers, but just thought you'd wanna know...  :D

I skipped the onion and reserved some of the white sauce to mix with bread crumbs to spread on top and it was really good.  For cheese I used cheddar and two bags of a Mexican blend.  Well received at our party, brought the kids in all of us!

I always thought old fashioned mac and cheese would take forever and so much work but it's not- this recipe is great- I used swiss, colby and cheddar for my cheeses - turned out great- next time I think I will put some of the sauce on the bottom of the baking dish first and then start layering.

So good!  I was a little uneasy about not melting the cheese into the milk mixture on the stovetop.  But I decided to follow the recipe instructions, and it turned out very smooth and creamy.  Wasn't sure how to do the Velveeta, so I just cut it into thin slices an placed evenly on each layer with the other cheeses.  And my flour mixture never became the paste the recipe described, but I went ahead and added the milk once it just started to brown.  Added a few buttered bread crumbs to the top.  Great dish.  It turned out to be everything I hoped it would be!

Very delicious and a big hit with the family. The only thing I did differently was melt the cheeses with the milk sauce instead of layering the cheeses. So I made a very cheesy sauce, poured it over the pasta and stuck it in the oven. Awesomeness!!

FABULOUS!!!!  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I look forward to making it again!  I even made this in a crock pot!  I doubled everything, cooked the noodles only half way, then layered everything in a crockpot.  I put the setting on low for 4 hours without stirring.  It was the first dish GONE at the potluck!!  I have to say I do use a little more cheese than the recipe says... but not much!!!

I made this over the weekend for my son's birthday party and it was excellent!  It was the 1st tray of food that was emptied at the party.  Everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe & left out the onions since I had a lot of kids and some don't like onions.  I made it the night before the party and the day of I put it in the oven to bake then left it over a sterno during the party.  I will be making this again for my family & for every party we have from now on.  One thing I did different was I melted the velveeta into the milk mixture and I added extra milk (about 3/4 cup more).  Since I was letting it sit overnight I knew the pasta would suck up a lot of the liquid so adding extra milk helped it from drying out the next day when it was reheated.  If I make it to be served the same day I will not add extra milk.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is the same recipe that I use however I use the following:
1/2 cup light cream, minced garlic, chopped fresh onion, 1/2 tbsp dried mustard, colby and sharp cheese 1 cup each.  Prepare in the same manner.

This was without a doubt the worst Mac and Cheese I have ever tasted. I had people over for dinner and we often try new recipes out with each other. Their opinion was the same as mine. Not sure if it even deserves the one star...

Tried it twice, exactly as written.  Unfortunately, we have an electric oven that tends to cook high, so the second time I took it out 10 minutes earlier.  Both times, it was on the dry side and not very creamy.  It seems to me that a 9x13 pan isn't ideal.  Will try one more time in a casserole dish, just not sure which size to try....any ideas??

This is a wonderful base recipe. The great thing about this recipe is keeping the cheese and the sauce separate. It makes a much more interesting dish than when you mix the cheese into the sauce - also much neater to make. I am a bit snobbish about cheese food, I'm afraid; I only ever cook with good quality cheese, so instead I use whatever I have around that needs using up. I  like to sautée the onion and use it in the base for making the roux, adding as well a teaspoon of mustard powder and a bit of hot sauce. I also add a couple of layers of cubes of ham and top the casserole with a thin layer of bread crumbs and parmesan mixed. Even my critical old mother, after turning up her nose at it as kids' food, asked for seconds!

I made this receipe last night and all the adults loved it.  My 4 year old and 6 year old, on the other hand, hated it.  I think that if I had omitted the onion they would have liked it better? My 4 year old complained of the onion and spit out the food.  Refused to even choke it down.  I thought the onion was a nice subtle touch--an adult palate would like it.

My husband loved it but I didn't find the cheese combination strong enough. Melted the cheeses in the white sauce and mixed in the macaroni. Added buttered bread crumbs to the top. Not bad but wouldn't make again.

Awesome recipe but mac & cheese can be altered in so many ways its hard to give it 5 stars... I changed the cheese variety to gouda, mozzarella, provalone, and cheddar ( sharp cheddar would be great too).  I also took it out 5 minutes early and added "panko" bread crumbs all over the top and broiled it for the additional 5 minutes (watching & rotating to golden the top evenly) this added additional texture to the mac & cheese & tasted awesome! Great recipe.

Mac and cheese is so common of course, but until now i've never felt like i had a good recipe.  This one is great!  Simple, easy and just like mom used to make.  I eliminated onions and used monterrey jack instead of swiss. Other than that, i followed the recipe exactly and  it is just wonderful.  In fact, I've made it two weekends in a row and have now shared this one with friends.

This was quite good, but it lacks something.  I think next time I will use pepper jack and sharp cheddar cheeses.  The only things I changed were I didn't layer it, I just stirred it all together.  I melted the velveeta into the cream sauce.  I also added seasoned ground up croutons over the top for added flavor.  I baked it, and then froze it to eat later.  It turned out great!!!! I put it in a cold oven and heated it up gradually while still cold but not frozen (I thawed it a day ahead).  Good recipe though but you need to tweak it to your liking regarding the cheeses.

Excellent!  I had some left over turkey sausage which I simmered with taco seasoning and black beans then layered with the macaroni and cheese.  It gave a little more protein punch.  A big hit!  I'm sure this is terrific without the added meat though!

Great recipe - exceptional taste!  This was better than my grandmothers and she was KNOWN for her Mac & Cheese.  Made again with a few additions - added red onion, 1/2 heavy creme, 1/2 whole milk, added a little of all the cheses I had on hand, English Glouchester,Mozzarella,Sharp NYS White Cheddar, Port Wine Processed Cheese added proscuitto and drizzled with White Truffle Oil.  Will try again using a variety of bleu cheeses.

My 6 year old loved it and so did my husband and I.  The cheese amount was perfect. Topped mine with a little bit of bread crumbs for some texture. Would be good with or without the bread crumbs.

This is really good!  I didn't put any butter on top and didn't miss it.  I love Velveeta, but I didn't like it in this dish.  I added half colby and half sharp cheddar and the swiss, but next time I will add more colby and no velveeta.  My niece and very picky 10 yr old nephew had seconds.  The onion really added great flavor.  Great recipe if you like cheesy macaroni!

I didn't use pats of butter but before I put it into the oven I added a small can of evaporated milk because it looked as if it would be dry, and thank God I did.  The white sauce tasted good but didn't permeate the entire casserole, and it was a bit dry.  I wasn't much impressed.

This receipe was super easy! I don't think you really need the processed cheese, real cheese works great! I added a little garlic and nutmeg in between layers to give it a more southern taste. Also added crumbled bacon on top...  After all everything tastes better w bacon! My guests loved it, which made clean up a breeze!

Thanks, Jayde175!  I think this is very close to the same way my Mom made mac & cheese when I was growing up.  She always baked it.  Can't wait to try it!

My 5 year old loves macaroni and cheese and asked for it for her birthday dinner. I wanted to make something a bit more special then the kraft box so I found this recipe. My whole family loves this recipe. Only alteration I made is switching out the processed cheese for a 1/4 pound of sharp cheddar. Was so delicious!

This is the best recipe I've ever used for Mac and Cheese. Super creamy and lots of flavor. Tonight was my first time to make it.  I love the Swiss cheese in it.   The sharp cheddar I used was not flavorful enough.  Next time I will use a better cheddar!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of ground mustard. I added my onion to the butter and sauteed it very briefly and then added the flour, mustard, salt & pepper.  Other than that, followed recipe as posted.

Excellent and by far one of the best mac & cheese I have ever made.  Guests at a party raved over it and I only got to sample it before it was gone!  I have had this with onions and without and I love it both ways.

I dont usually give 5 stars , but for this recipe I must give 5 stars. I changed a couple things A Little . We didn't have any processed cheese, so we used Sharp cheese in it's place. We added 1 egg, 1 tsp Oregano , and put a light coating of bread crumbs on top before baking. SOOOOO good !  We will definitley be making this again ! thank you.

This is a creamy delicious recipe. It's not necessary to make changes. However, when I made the recipe, I wanted to first sautee the onions. In addition, in the last 5 minutes in the oven, I crumbled sour cream and onion potato chips as a topping and placed the dish under the broil for 3 minutes. These changes gave a little extra taste to an already yummy casserole.

This was great and a crowd pleaser at Thanksgiving. Next time I would mix it all together rather than layer. Taste was great but left for some strange consistencies in it.

The only thing I would change is I make all my sauces in the microwave and then I have no fear of burning the milk.  Much easier lol...I’m a lazy cook.

This was a good recipe to follow for basic mac-n-cheese. I did however tweak it. You definitely need more than 2 cups of pasta(I used farfalle) and a lot more cheese. I skipped the baking part but I did add breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese and stirred it all together. I also added garlic powder, thyme, and onion powder (instead of real onion since I wasn't baking it). All in all it turned out great and also perfect for Tabasco.

I added about 3/4 cup chopped up leftover kielbasa.  We liked the added spice from the meat. The dish will likely be on our menu again!

I didn't have processed cheese foods with me, and my baking dish wasn't 9x13 inches, but the mac and cheese still tasted great.  Instructions were easy to follow and there wasn't a lot of room for error. A perfect dish for a hungry family.

Best Mac and cheese. Always a big hit with everyone. I omit the onion and don’t use a lot of velveeta cheese (personal preference). I add extra Swiss and different kinds of cheddar. Awesome to make as is or change it up a bit as I’ve done. Thank you for this recipe!!

Amazing! I made the mistake of doubling the noodles (I had penne) because it seemed so watery even after it thickened. It looked fine in the casserole dish but when I took it out of the oven, the noodles had absorbed any remaining sauce so it wasn't very creamy. I'll definitely make it again, leave it with the 2cups of noodles then bake

I give it five stars.  It’s my favorite, better than any restaurant.  It’s the blend of cheeses that does it, creamy without that overly bitter after- taste straight cheddar can give you.  Can’t imagine making this without the Velveeta, hence the creaminess.  I mince the onion finely in a mini food grinder/chopper so the onion flavor is there without the coarseness of chopped onion.  Don’t panic if it looks like a lot of white sauce; it all gets cooked in and absorbed.  I have made this for Christmas, potlucks, and a football team and every loves it.   Thank you for the perfect mac and cheese.

This was a huge hit at a dinner party last night and extremely easy to make. Everyone kept saying it reminded them of the Whole Foods mac and cheese.

The only thing I did differently was I used extra old white cheddar and swiss cheese. I did not use the fake stuff.

Yes, I melted the cheese and mixed it in with the white sauce.
Poured 1/2 over 1/2 of mac and then the mac and the sauce.
I also used gluten free pasta by Jovial and only cooked it 6 minutes so it would not get soggy!

Easy to prepare and better than good as described, but I  do like to increase cheese quantities to 8 oz each and stir half the sauce into half the ingredients in the pan to blend before layering the 2nd half of ingredients on top. For a  richer dish I add 1 lb of cooked langostino to the mix.

This is fabulous!!!  The only change I made was to saute the onion in the butter when I made the white sauce.  I also wish I had layered some of the white sauce on top of cheese of first layer.  However, it turned out great and everyone loved it!

I was so hopeful with this recipe that I made it for a large gathering. Sad to report that my family and I weren't big fans of the taste and the crowd must have not been either since I brought 3/4 of it back home. It has a very odd flavor and not in a good way. Certainly not one that you'd expect with a baked mac and cheese.

I have tried mac and cheese recipe after recipe and this is finally a keeper! I used medium cheddar and pepper jack cheeses because that’s what I had in the fridge. I also added 1/2 a can of stewed tomatoes for color and added flavor. I seasoned with pepper and garlic salt to taste. Then, I finished it off by sprinkling the top with parmesan cheese and putting it under the broiler for a few minutes. So yummy! Everyone in the family loves it — will be making this again!

I have made this many times.  We love it and it is easy to make.  The only thing I do differently is that I do  not layer it when putting it together.  I am not a fan of layering.  I melt the cheeses, one at a time, in the hot white sauce.  Then I pour the mixture over the pasta and mix well.  I have seen this done on the various cooking shows that I enjoy.  It comes out great.

I made this because it was quick and easy. Everyone really liked it, and some asked for the recipe. I was not familiar with minced onion so I hydrated it and I only used a little.  This 
recipe is a keeper.

Yummy!! Everyone loved it, even my picky 3 year old! I use sharp cheddar instead of regular. The onions were a nice touch. I changed the serving size to 12 people, I should have used a BIGGER sauce pan while making it. Great leftovers too!

I made this dish for my son's preschool Thanksgiving feast last week. I'd never made it before and I want sure the other kids would like it with the onions and swiss cheese (my son has a varied palate), but I went with it. I did sub white cheddar for the Velveeta and didn't add much salt and pepper (I like food saltier and didn't want to give the kids hypertension before kindergarten) and used a roux that I already had in the fridge, but it was GONE when I picked up my crock pot!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. I melted in some Boursin herb & garlic cheese spread (don’t like Velveta) and topped it all with panko/seasoned bread crumb mixture. We can’t do onion so the guys added more salt & pepper. Next time, will add more herbs.

I was asked to make mac and cheese for 100 people for a wedding reception and then again for 70 people for a dinner at our local veterans club. I found this recipe and used it for both occasions... I got more compliments and was told how awesome it was!!! Now I keep getting asked to make it again...

I only made one difference: I doubled the recipe for the same size baking dish. It just fit, and I am glad I doubled it!! It was a smashing hit! Made this to go along with some pork butt I smoked, and it complemented it perfectly! The recipe is simply amazing.

Delicious! I didnt have an onion at home, so i used 2 shallots instead, and I'm a little lazy, so I took a couple of shortcuts.  Sautee shallots in the butter before adding the flour, add the salt and pepper to the sauce as well. Mix the cheese with the pasta(I used lentil pasta to make it more carb friendly), pour sauce on top, off into the oven it went. It was a big hit!

Delicious! I've made it twice now and found that I needed to do 4T flour (to the 4T butter) to make it thick enough for roux. I also subbed Monterey Jack for the Swiss because that's what I had on hand. The family scarfed it down and unfortunately, there were no leftovers.

This was sooooo good! I hadn't ever done homemade mac and cheese before and I made it for a friend that was in desperate need of "comfort" food.  It was very easy and turned out great.  I loaded it with bacon and jalapeno for a little bit of spice.

I have always melted the cheese into the hot milk mixture but I tried this recipe and it was delicious. Creamy, not dry and much easier than my method. You really need the grated onion, it adds a nice flavor. I didn't top,with pandora but that sounds good. My Mom aslways sprinkled a little paprika on top.

I doubled the recipe and instead of layering, I added all the cheese to the roux in the sauce pan and then poured over the macaroni and mixed.  I also added bacon but forgot the diced jalapeños to spice it up

Really yummy!  I added 1 teaspoon dry mustard to the white sauce roux for a little  extra "zing."  Also used a 9"x9" pan rather than a 9"x13."  This recipe reminded me of my mom's  mac and cheese of 1950's / 60's.

I used 1 lb. Velveeta and about a cup of shredded Parm (not from the green can!) instead of the suggested cheeses (due to what I had on hand) and cooked it on the Rec Tec BBQ until lightly brown and bubbly. After cooling I put it in the refer overnight. The next day it was cut up into 2" cubes, dredged in egg, rolled in bread crumbs and deep fried! OMG! Talk about a fun treat!

I'm not a big fan of mac & cheese in general but I thought it was good.  This has a good texture and taste, way better than the stuff from the box.  However the only 3 star is because my wife and kids didn't care for it at all.  They barely ate any the night I made it and wouldn't touch the leftovers.  They love the stuff out of the box, so take it for whatever that's worth.

Ok, hate to admit but the only macaroni and cheese I've ever liked was Kraft in the blue box, until now. This was creamy and a perfect blend of cheeses. I was hesitant when I saw "processed cheese food" but the entire recipe was outstanding. ??

Pretty good! Easy to make, and the kids liked it. I changed the cheeses to what I had in-house, and it will be fun to play around with different kinds of cheese.

Came out exactly as expected. Sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top to add a bit of texture. A little bit bland for my taste, but a super simple recipe to throw together quickly.

Made as written I'm sure it's still a 5 star, but I have to admit I made some changes to accommodate what we had on hand.
I added about 6 pieces of crumbled bacon, substituted half and half for the milk and used a combination of goat cheese, gouda and mozzarella (what was on hand).  I finished by topping w bread crumbs.
This was a fantastic dish and will definitely be making this again.

We really enjoyed it, creamy for some of us and flavorful with a bit of crunch for the rest of us.

Made this for Christmas Eve.  My family 3 men all loved it.  My boys love mac and cheese and said this is the best they have ever had.  Only difference is I used large shells instead of elbow macaroni.  Put bread crumb topping.  Will definetly make this again.

Made Mac/Cheese for the first time and followed this recipe.  It was a hit and the picky eating child LOVED IT.  Thumbs up and I absolutely recommend this recipe.   I gave it a 4 star rating only because I forgot to add the processed cheese so I have to make it again using all the ingredients and then will change my rating.

I made this exactly as indicated. The cheese sauce is AWESOME. I'm not usually a fan of swiss cheese, but this really was just right as written. I had assembled this the night before and baked the next day, which seemed to make it drier than I prefer. I think when I make this again I might skip the baking and/or bake immediately (instead of prepping ahead) so as to yield a creamier result.

I made it very closely except added brown spicy mustard with seeds in the butter and flour mixture. It came out really well. Loved the layering of cheeses ect the pouring liquid over it. At end added more cheese and breadcrumbs for a topping. It was delicious.

This was the best mac and cheese I have ever made.  The only changes I made was to add crumbled bacon and a bread crumb topping with parmesan.  This was delicious!

Made this as part my thanksgiving menu and it came out amazing!!!! I changed a couple things around. Firstly, doubled the recipe and used four cups of pasta. Also, I used cavatappi instead of elbow macoroni. And instead of using equal parts cheddar and swiss, I used about 3 cups of shredded cheddar cheese and half a block of swiss. So instead of doing half and half, you should put half the recommended amount of swiss and make up for it with the cheddar. I think it came out so much better that way. Swiss can be kind of overpowering (to me anyway), but it ended up coming out perfectly. I also omitted the onions completely and added a bit of paprika. Also, had to use lactose free milk. It was seriously amazing! The best homemade macoroni and cheese I ever had!!! I don't even like swiss cheese and I still found this to be amazing. Everyone in my family liked it. I even got my 4 year old to eat some and he is extremely picky. I'll definitely be making this recipe again soon.

there is not enough characters to explain how great this recipe this game out. i received so much praise from a cultural diverse office on how wonderful & amazing it was. I was told this was what mac & cheese is supposed to be creamy, gooey, cheesy and buttery. not one noodle was left over.  I'll be making again. i did add pepper jack to use it up. i used swiss cheese not the shredded kind like the long deli slices just diced it's what I had.

Amazing!!! Unlike most reviewers I make it exactly as written. Don't rate a recipe if you change it. Then people that try it the first time get confused and do what reviewers said then blame the recipe if they don't like it. If you change it. Don't review it. I don't know why you would want to change anything anyway! It has a perfect flavour and is super creamy. I always do the recipe 1.5x as we love having this for leftovers. Note: don't skip the butter in top. I forgot it once and it definitely made a big difference. If you're trying to be "healthy" don't look up a mac and cheese recipe. It's a cheat day meal!

This is actually pretty easy. We have a lot of food sensitivities so I adjusted with gluten free noodles, goat cheese and almond milk. Really yummy and creamy. Be sure to let your milk boil down the flour so it isn't gritty.

I did not use the processed cheese but instead used a can of cheddar cheese soup. Remember to cook the onion until soft and translucent. No one wants crunchy mac n cheese. I also use browned kielbasa for the meat. This is a family favorite and never lets me down when a friend has a baby ??

This was, hands down, the best mac and cheese I've ever had. I used shell macoroni for this recipe which cradles the cheesiness in a creamy little cheese pocket. I almost opted not to use the onions but I'm so glad I did. Surprisingly, they complemented the dish nicely. My hubby had reservations about giving me the crown, but he said it was the 2nd best mac and cheese he's ever had, next to his mom's. We may have to settle this once and for all this Thanksgiving lol

Excellent recipe. The only change I made was  adding more milk like others suggested and the dish was so rich and creamy. I tripled the recipe and used 8 cups of whole milk. Everything fit into 2 9x13 pans. This is definitely going to be a holiday staple!

Luscious! The only thing I added was some Panko crumbs and melted butter on the top for texture. Put it under the broiler for a few minutes to toast the crumbs. I want to eat the whole pan, just give me a fork!

Have used this site with great success so I thought I should do a review. Never made Mac n cheese before so this easy recipe was a great way to start. Did it as per recipe but needed some veggies. Grilled up some  Onions, then added mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower. Layered it in as per recipe but as I had added volume I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. We loved it. Made it again for my wife's girls day and added most ingredients from Chef John's recipe and the ladies loved it. None came home!

4th of July success! I doubled the recipe and it was gone in a matter of minutes. I omitted the onions and spiced up the sauce. I also replaced processed cheese with shredded cheese. The Swiss cheese is a must!

I had made this for dinner last night (20/6/2016) and this was my first time ever! This recipe is amazing!!! my first Mac and Cheese was a super hit. My mom took 2 extra servings after her first try! she couldn't have enough of it. Although she was sceptical at first because it was her first time eating M&C. Thanks for sharing!

I substituted the onion with shallots( cuz its what I had) and I didn't have swiss so I just used equal amounts of really good quality sharp cheddar and velveeta. I also didn't do any of the leyering...once I had the cheese sauce seasoned the way I wanted, I poured the noodles into the sauce pan and stirred, coating the noodles and scraped it all into the baking dish.  I also threw in diced ham to make it more of a meal instead of just a side dish. 
I couldn't stop making yummy sounds while eating it
I also used lactose free milk to make it easier to digest for my husband.  totally worked...no stomach ache!!!

I made this today and had to boil two more cups of pasta as the ratio of cheese to pasta seemed way off. I then had to go back and make more white sauce, which I added Worcestershire sauce and a bit of Dijon to, so this took a long time to make but it looks good! I baked for 60 mins at 350.

I loved this recipe!!! The best only suggestion I have is you don't need processed cheese and if u use it make sure it isn't on top of it will burn. But still 5 stars

Pretty good! The rioux didn't cover the entirety of the pan so next time I'll mix all of it together since some noodles got crunchy and dry. But I followed the recipe exactly.

I love this recipe. Easy to make. I did change it by putting bread crumbs on the top and then the small squares of butter. I also added basil to mine. When I did the butter and flour mix I added the cheese there and poured it over the already cooked elbow macaroni. Came out fantastic !!

Great recipe!  my whole family loved it! I made a few modifications and would only make a few more next time i make this.  I used rotini noodles instead of elbow macaroni, a mixture of shredded cheddar and colby jack cheese, 1 cup of half and half  and 1 cup milk, and 1 tsp of dried onion instead of the chopped onion  and 1 tsp of dried mustard ( I had seen this on a bunch of other recipes to I gave it a shot).  I also tossed some seasoned breadcrumbs on top and put it all in the oven til it was golden brown.  It was just a tad dry for my taste so next time, I will add more milk.  I like my mac&cheese a little more cheesy.  Everyone absolutely loved this recipe and will be keeping it around for future dinners.

Yum yum!  I will definitely make this again. I used white velveta, cheddar, and mozzarella (melted into the white sauce) and I love love bacon in my Mac so I cooked up bacon and crumbled it and added to the layer of noodles and cheese. I also like a little bit of crunch so processes some crackers and butter and sprinkled across the top. Last couple minutes of baking turned on the broiler and browned the top. So good and creamy!

I may have added a bit more cheese but otherwise I made it just as directed, and wow! It was awesome, and went in quite a big hurry at our thanksgiving dinner. I made enough for 21 people, we had around 17 people and it was gone! I love this mac and cheese. It tastes just like my grandmother use to make!

We absolutely loved this mac and cheese! I would not consider it 'traditional' but delish all the same!  I cut back on the onion by half, since I made such a huge batch for Thanksgiving. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was creamy and tasty! If you're wanting a run of the mill box taste...this is NOT for you!

I didn't have any onion and I may have browned the butter mixture a little too much, but it still came out DELICIOUS. I have always been a boxed mac and cheese person, but this is THE recipe! I will absolutely make this again.

Finally made great Mac and cheese!  Try the spreadable cheese for the "cheese food" product in the tub that you out one crackers (maybe even the port wine one).  The tang from that cheese makes it really good.

I think I overcooked my noodles, but it was pretty good.  I used swiss, sharp cheddar, and american cheeses, and melted them in with the milk then mixed it in with the noodles before baking.

Original recipe tasted kind of bland and relied too much on cheese for flavor. I recommended seasoning the macaroni with 2 tsp of curry seasoning and perhaps adding some red bell pepper. For the white sauce, add some rosemary. Doing this will allow you to reduce the amount of cheese and still enjoy the dish. I also recommend adding some bread crumbs to the top.

I made this tonight. It was amazing, I added double the onion because we enjoy the tartness of the onion and the cheese.  I used Velveeta as the processed cheese and increased the amount of all of the cheese in general. It took about an hour to cook, rather than 30 minutes, but this may be due to extra ingredients. Absolutely delish!

This was awesome!  I did make a few minor adjustments.  First, I doubled the recipe (excellent decision!). Next, I used extra sharp white, sharp cheddar and Monterey cheeses.  Great choices for personal preferences. I think this recipe will come out amazing no matter what cheeses you use.  Last, I added panko bread crumbs to the top and inadvertently cooked it without covering it.  Came out crispy!  Love this, and will definitely make it again!

I took some license and added fresh tomatoes that needed to be used TODAY and changed nothing else - this was fantastic.  I think what I liked best was the addition of minced onions - have never even thought of this before, but this took a simple yummy dish over the top for me! I'll never make mac & cheese without ever again!

I made 2 casserole dishes of this recipe and froze them.  One for my family and one for a friend who just had knee surgery.  When we had ours, my husband wanted to go take the other one back from my friend, haha! Topping this with crispy bacon was the perfect finish to this recipe.  Great to make ahead for busy weeknights.  Delish!

Less Swiss & more cheddar! Mac & Cheese is supposed to be yellow/orange - not white! Way under salted for me. I noted on my copy to add salt in the "rue" next time.

I added a bread crumb/Panko/butter crumble to the top which was nice.

This is one of those easy and great recipes. Whenever I make Mac & Cheese this is the recipe to follow. For the kids I will make it just as instructed, however if we have adults over I will sometimes add goat cheese to give it a more mature flavor. Great on it's own and a wonderful side dish.

Adding to my other review, I forgot to say I like to make it into a cheese sauce by melting the cheeses into the white sauce then tossing the elbows and sauce and pouring into the pan. I like that technique better, but the ingredients here are perfect.

This is my go to recipe for mac-n-cheese every time. I make it a little different but it's good just as the recipe says. I omit the onion because I have picky eaters, and I add 5oz of shredded parm to the cheese. Also I melt the Velveeta into the cream sauce. This is the only mac I'll make and we rarely have leftovers! It's awesome

I made this recipe for tonight's dinner...Because I did not have any Swiss cheese on hand, I added a pinch of nutmeg to boost the flavor of the cheese sauce (which I also combined with the white sauce before adding it to the macaroni)..it was delicious!

This was absolutely the best homemade mac and cheese I have ever made or tried. I have tried a few other recipes only to find out after making it, it was terribly bland and had no flavor.  I made this recipe as is and as other members stated don't forget to add the onion. It is a wonderful ingredient in this dish and works extremely well with it by adding additional flavor.

We loved this.  I would love to say I didn't change a thing but I ended up using up a few different cheeses we had in our dairy drawer in addition to the cheeses the recipe called for.  I made this in a glass bottom dish and baked it with the ham.  It got a bit brown on the bottom.  (I should have thought of that)  Even the brown was tasty but a bit tough.   I will make this again.  I just made my husband his lunch to take to work and I have to say that this recipe is just as good if not better the next day.   YUM!!!

This recipe is great!  It's the best Mac and Cheese we've ever made.  I'm a huge fan of Mac and Cheese but my kid prefered the box kind, not any longer!!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  We had to double the recipe to have it as a side dish for a family get together (18 people).

This was delicious - followed the recipe for the most part but used about half the milk because I don't like when it's too watery. Improvised with the cheese (half cheddar and half american cheese) and omitted the onions. Everyone loved it!

We thought this was ok. I made it exactly as written and think that next time I will melt the cheeses and grate the onions. The flavor was really good but we didn't like the onion pieces and the cheeses would have been better blended together.

It was very similar to a recipe that I have used for years, but couldn't find.  I used Tex Mex shredded cheese in this recipe instead of processed.  And I added bread crumbs throughout the recipe along with on top I put butter on the bread crumbs and mixed the shredded cheese with the crumbs.  My husband loved it and I did too. Loved it!

I followed the recipe to a T but I halved it since there was only 2 of us eating. It was a hit! My boyfriend's a picky eater but he absolutely loved it. He said it was really good and he's quite selfish with the cooking compliments so when he says it's good, it must be really good. I separated the macaroni into 4 ramekins, just so that it would be individually portioned. He ate 2 ramekins! Next time, i might add ham. It was really good. Thanks for the recipe!

We enjoyed it with a special birthday lobster dinner and green beans, per my son's request.  Easy to make and very good.  Only change was to melt the cheeses into the milk sauce.

Awesome mac n cheese recipe hands down! My advice is to substitute the onions with shallots since I didn't have any onions. Worked out great!

This is awesome!!!  I like not making the cheese sauce on the stove and just doing the milk!  I did do a cup of cream and a cup of milk, and a Mexican shredded mix of cheeses with shredded Swiss.  Skipped the Velveeta, too much sodium.  (Not that one should be too concerned with this meal?  LOL)  LOVE it!!!!

I love Mac and cheese and this is an amazing recipe! My only suggestion would be to use gruyere cheese and slate cheddar mix instead of the processed stuff. Always a hit!!

My teenage boys grew out of the box mac n cheese years ago and always hesitate when someone makes homemade m-n-c!  Made this last night (as written) and those 3 boys were diving at the dish 3x over!  And if I like something I cook, I usually don't comment out loud that it's good.... But I was raving around the table with everyone else on how awesome this is!  Definitely a keeper ---WHEN I'M NOT WATCHING MY FIGURE! LOL

So I did not make it exactly the same, and was disappointed with the instructions.  I am using this to experiment with recipes and learn how to cook as I am a guy and didn't cook a whole lot growing up.. that being said it seemed fairly easy, but a warning should be put out about how faster milk boils over!! haha.

This is my families absolute favorite Mac & Cheese. My hubby is in charge of making this and there are never any leftovers. Tonight he has added seasoned ground beef and bacon to it so it is our entire dinner along with tossed salad and homemade dressing. I am sure it will be just as delicious with the additions.

I did not like the Swiss cheese or the onion in this Mac and cheese. The butter and flour for the roux should be in equal amounts and NOT cooked over medium-high heat!  I learned this the hard way because it did not form into a paste, but instead it started turning a dark brown and smelled like it was burning. I saved the roux, but still didn't like this because of the onion and Swiss cheese.

Great mac and cheese. I did not use the swiss cheese, but only because I did not have any on hand.  I baked longer than the recipe called for because we like our mac and cheese dry and not runny.  This is  classic good mac and cheese that everyone will love.  I get rave reviews every time I make it.

I was very skeptical about putting onions in the macaroni, but I gave it a try because I wanted to try the recipe as written. I am so glad I did. The onions added a very unexpected kick! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this Mac and cheese!!!! It's definitely a keeper. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was excellent!  I didn't use the processed cheese (Velveeta) that was suggested, instead I used American cheese and used sharp yellow cheddar cheese with the swiss cheese.  Since we like a little heat added red pepper flakes and panko bread crumbs on top.  Was a hit in my house and will make again!

I am absolutely horrible about following recipes to the T, so of course I made my own adjustments.  Either which way, even with subbing things both my boys ate it like they have never eaten a meal before.  I have a 3 & 1 yr old.  I never buy the prepackaged Mac & cheese.  Will be keeping this recipe!!

I followed it exactly and just didn't care for it. The onions were just odd (although I've had garlic in m & c before that was great) and the Swiss cheese made it taste odd. I had high hopes, but was disappointed. Regardless if you want a creamier texture you'll need to at least double the amount of velveeta and probably melt it in the béchamel as it was really hard to work with since you can't shred it. I'd also toss the onions with the pasta before putting in the pan as spreading them was impossible in any even way.

This was amazing!  I took this to an office potluck, and it was cleaned out in a matter of minutes.  The Swiss adds such a great flavor, and my kids can't get enough.  I will never make mac and cheese from a box again!

I want to preface this by saying I feel like a total noob after making this mac and cheese. Things I would do differently in the future making this recipe, that maybe other people automatically know to do but I didn't: (1) cook the whole box of macaroni noodles, not 2 cups measured out; (2) melt the cheese product and mix it with the noodles to cover before dividing; (3) don't get distracted when I think the milk isn't getting hot fast enough. -- I have hope that with these clarifications, especially the first two, this recipe could be 4-5 star worthy the next time around. This time some of my noodles on the edge got dry and crackly from not having enough cheese on them.

I didn't have american cheese on hand (processed cheese) so i replaced it with left over pepperjack, along with swiss and cheerer, but it still came out very very delicious!!!! Love this! Next time, I will try it with american cheese! Simple, easy to make, and full of flavor!!! Waaaaaaaay better than instant or restaurant mac and cheese! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Excellent!! My family loved it. We don't like onions so I left them out. I also covered top with  crushed ritz cracker & melted butter & browned. It was simple to make, perfect for a relaxing Sunday afternoon. Will definitely make again & again!

This was good. I think it would be better if it was more creamy, so I think I might add either more milk or some cheese sauce next time. Very good reheated in the microwave too.

Finally found the perfect Mac n cheese recipe! Changes: onion powder instead of real, didn't have processed cheese so used combo of mozzarella and jalapeño jack. Will never try another Mac n cheese recipe again!!

I followed this recipe exactly how it's written. I gave it 3 stars because I felt the original recipe was a bit bland for my taste. It was good, just very mild and what I would consider a "safe" recipe flavor-wise.  However, you could easily remedy this by switching up cheeses or adding a little spice(garlic salt on one of the layers?). I will definitely use this as a base recipe and try to tweak it to my taste.

This was a huge hit at the thanksgiving table this year!!!! Stayed true to the recipe in regards to using the swiss cheese but I swaped out the processed cheeses for extra sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheese to add a little spice. Will be making this again, delicious!!!

Layering the noodles and cheeses is not a good idea. I tried this because I love swiss cheese and onions but the final product wasn't right. The cheeses should be blended into the rue and milk mixture not layered. I rely heavily on the reviews and appreciate substitutions and changes

I love the receipe and have used it over the last couple of years.  It is comparable to my family recipe except for the processed cheese food and the onion.  The processed cheese I don't like so much, so I don't use it, but the onion addition is great.  I'm not even a big mac n cheese fan. but everyone loves it!

Needs more flavour - doubled the cheese, still wasn't cheesy enough.  Maybe add tuna?  Sauce didn't seem very tasty - maybe add cheese to the sauce?

I have never made Mac and Cheese before and this was simple and easy to follow. I did not use velveta because it's one cheese I do not like. I replaced it with some fresh Parmesan. Instead of layering I sautéed the onions in the butter flour mixture. Then added the cheeses. Very similar to the sauce I use for potatoes. I then mixed in the macaroni. Topped with cheese and breadcrumbs and it turned out fabulous.

Meh. This was just alright. My husband didn't care for the onion in this and complained that it overpowered every bite. I didn't mind the onion (I actually enjoyed it quite a bit), but hated the bechamel sauce. I've tried quite a few mac & cheese recipes on here and this certainly is not one of my favorites. Mouse's version is MUCH better, IMHO. While I appreciate the opportunity to try something new, I think I'll stick with what I know we like from now on. Thanks anyways, JAYDE.

this was the most delicious mac and cheese I have ever eaten.  I made it a complete meal by adding diced ham and frozen peas. and added a little grated cheddar and crushed ritz crackers to the top.  also threw on some chopped green onion at serving time.  I used all 3 cheeses as jayde instructed and they are a fabulous and delicious combination.  the swiss really adds a subtle nutty sweetness that is unbeatable, please don't skip it. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze one for a busy day.  I have the 2nd batch in the oven right now and it is making my tummy rumble just smelling it baking.  if you like good old fashioned American comfort food, this is the recipe for you.  thank you jayde, you really outdid yourself with this delicious recipe.

Love this recipe! After making it a few times, I tweak it just a little. I always cut up my left over ham from this recipe, http://allrecipes.com/recipe/classic-ham-glaze/detail.aspx, and add it to the mac and cheese. I bake 25 minutes and then top with Kraft Fresh Takes Cheddar Jack and Bacon, and bake uncovered for the remaining 20 minutes.

Fabulous recipe...probably the best Mac and cheese I've ever had.  The 3 cheeses along with the minced onion give it such a wonderful flavor.  As previously suggested, I also added breadcrumbs the last few minutes of baking time and placed under broiler.  This one's a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

Made exactly according to recipe and I couldn't love this recipe any more. Needed to use a slightly smaller pan bit that didn't make any difference. Two thumbs up.

I got rave reviews from my family with this one.  My son said that this is the best Mac he has ever eaten and my husband said I have to make this for get togethers.  I think the only thing I would do differently is add some butter crackers on top for some crunch with some bacon and maybe even a little bit of green onion on top.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  I will be making this recipe many more times.

This is an excellent recipe. I had doubts when I was making it because it looked like the pan required would be too big for the amount of macaroni and cheeses. It was truly wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and have to say that the swiss cheese was a nice complement to the other two cheeses. This will be my go to Mac & cheese from now on.

What A Treat! Used Mexican shredded cheese instead of processed (omits additives), fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, and baked in a smaller pan. Added a layer of fresh baby spinach just b4 last cheese layer and substituted snipped green onion tops. Finally, topped with flavored panko and did not cover with foil. Crispy top and ready in approx 35 minutes. One of the best yet, and we've tried 'em all, including in our smoker. Thanks, Jayde175!

This absolutely is the best mac and cheese I have ever eaten.  Usually change something about a recipe but with this one I went exactly by the recipe.  The swiss cheese is what makes it.

This recipe was delicious!  The cheeses melded together beautifully and it didn't take long for the dish to be demolished.

Great recipes. I didn't add pepper because of personal prefrence. l didn't add salt because I thought it would have enough flavor from the cheeses. Next time I will add the salt either when layering like it says or to the pasta water. I was also unsure how to add the velveeta. I think the best option would be to melt it then pour it as needed but because of lack of time I opted to cut it into thin slices and drop it here and there. After baking a mixed it all up and although it was great it looked messy. If you have the time I would suggest the melting then pouring method for presentation purposes. All in all, it was a great recipe that everyone loved and complimented me on.

I have made this twice (exactly as written) and it was a huge hit both times.  In fact, my 72 year old mother said it was the best she had ever had (even better than her own recipe which was pretty darn good).  It really is the ultimate comfort food.

I made this for the first time. I was in a rush so I just added the cheese to the milk/flour mixture, let it melt, and then stirred in the pasta.  The finished product was delicious.  I will make this again, although maybe with a little less milk if I don't have time to bake again. It probably firms up in the oven, but the way I had to serve it, it was a little runny. A slotted spoon worked great and everyone loved it.

Got rave reviews for this! I did not have the processed or swiss cheese on hand so used a combo of sharp and a mexican blend. I know we need to rate on the exact recipe, but gave this 5 stars because it does seem very flexible on your cheeses available or preference!

I truly enjoyed this dish. I'm not a lover of onions, so just sprinkled onion powder in between the layers. Definitely a keeper for me, quite easy.

I have been using this recipe for about a year now and have received nothing but rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Everyone loves this stuff!

The original recipe is wonderful but I have come to enjoy the following mix of cheeses; 1/4 lb shredded Sharp Cheddar, 1/4 lb shredded Mozzarella, one 10oz can Campbell's Cheddar Cheese condensed soup (undiluted, dropped in dollops evenly across both layers).

I also top the entire dish with a thin layer of crushed Ritz Crackers before baking.  For a crispy topping, I uncover the dish for the last 15 minutes of baking.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree with the other reviewers.  The minced onion and swiss cheese give it a unique flavor.  Kids and adults loved it.  Was great reheated as leftovers the next day.

The whole family loved this recipe. Didn't have Swiss cheese on hand, but topped it off with fresh Parmesan.  Had to hide the onion in the rue/cream sauce because of the kids.  Will make again.

This Mac & cheese was very good. I would definitely make this again. I did make a couple changes. I used 1/3 package of sharp cheddar and 1/3 package of taco mixed cheeses. I also roughly crumbled some whole wheat crackers on top and added some pats of butter over the crackers. I might try sautéing the onions next time, but it was tasty as is.

Make a gluton free version of this and no one can tell the difference! Just use rice pasta. I have found that the fusilli from Tinkyada works really well. Make the white sauce with cornstarch (heat milk and butter to just about boil then add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch that has been mixed with 2tablespoon COLD water or milk, stir constantly until it boils). Voila, glutton free and people love it!

This recipe was easy and we all liked it. I have very picky eaters, so I took out the onion. We also do not eat processed cheese food, so I didn't add that either. I used a milk substitute also. This will not be a creamy mac and cheese unless you use a processed cheese food like Velveeta. This is the mac and cheese I grew up on. If you are used to the creamy stuff, you may not like this version.

I made this for the first time a few weeks ago, and loved it.  The Swiss cheese really does make the difference.  Even my picky son ate it. I've got a pan of it in the oven now, but didn't have the Swiss, so we'll see. I'm sure it will still be almost as yummy.  Great texture. Smooth and creamy.  This time, I also crushed up some buttery crackers to put on the top.

I thought this was great!  I did use rotini pasta and I should have cut down the amount of pasta to keep the mac and cheese from getting to dry.  Just an fyi for anyone who may not use elbow macaroni.  Delish!  Another family keeper:)

Very flavorful, but mine turned out a bit dry and I followed directions exactly.  I like my mac and cheese with more sauce for sopping up with bread.  I will add a bit more velveeta and milk next time.  Other than that...yum!

I experimented a bit with this. I used a little bit of cayenne pepper and a thick cut steak house flavored bacon. Pepper mixed in the sauce and bacon sprinkled on top. Tasted amazing !!

This didn't turn out like I had hoped. I followed the recipe, but found it to be dry and not much taste to it. I added more salt and pepper after it came out of the oven as well as additional pats of butter. It helped. Will add more spices next time around and more liquid and I think it will be perfect.

Add 1/4 pound of smal curd cottage cheese if you like the textured type of Mac and cheese

The recipe turned out great! The right amount of cheesiness & flavor. The main difference between this recipe and the traditional way I make mac 'n' cheese is the onions & layering. My family enjoyed this recipe on Thanksgiving Day and wished there was more.

What really intruiged me about this recipe was the onions. I thought it was a unique idea. After I actually tried the dish, I immediately fell in love with the onions. They made all the difference. Those, combined with all the cheeses really made this dish a winner.

This was really great and a huge hit with all 25 of my guests.  Will definately make it again.  I made it the day before and baked it one hour before serving!

Loved the recipe as written.  I added chopped parboiled broccoli to the dish to add some green, fiber and added nutrition. I typically use all the left over cheese spreads such as garlic herb and jalapeno and for the shredded cheese I use sharp cheddar.  Also, instead of plain shredded onion I saute until dark brown for a wonderful flavor boost.

I absolutely love mac and cheese and I made this tonight and it was my main dish.  I did not do the onions in it but I topped it instead with Crispy Fried Onions.  The prep was quick and easy and I ate half the dish at one time (I did half the recipe!)  I recommend this!

This recipe was so easy to make. I did make 2 changed because my stepson is a picky eater. I omitted the onion and added bread crumbs to the top before baking. It was so delicious and cheesy but not too cheesy. Next time i'll try pepper jack cheese and some hot sauce for a kick. Definatly a keeper!!

I cut the recipe in half and just used whatever cheese I had in the fridge (mostly cheddar plus some gouda and a little maasdamer and parmesan), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was perfect!  I'm already looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.

This was good but not the best I have tasted. Followed the recipe exactly...and it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked. Very super cheesy, though...almost too much (like that's possible!).

I made this with Veggie cheese and took out the onion because I made it for my 3 year old who is lactose intolerant. She loved it and she is one picky eater! I thought it was pretty tasty myself. So easy to make as well. : )
