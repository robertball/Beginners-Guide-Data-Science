DEELISH!  I loved this soup - the only changes I made were to use fresh Spinach.  I chose not to puree the end result and was pleased with the texture.  I will probably omit the bacon next time.  This is a very filling dish on it's own as the blue cheese gives it a very rich flavor.

I am the chef at a sports bar and grill in Dania Beach, Florida. My clientele consists not only of local residents but tourists from around the world. I am expected to prepare extraordinary soups and specials on a daily basis...on a limited budget with limited time. My ratings are based on customer response...so take them seriously. I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).  I hate bleu cheese but liked this soup. I used cream cheese instead of milk and fresh spinach (frozen spinach often has a fishy smell and taste). Customers like a soup with texture so I didn't puree anything. Tastes good and looks good. A bit of parmesan on top when you serve is a nice touch.

Wow!!  Maybe the best soup I've ever tasted!!  I made it exactly as directed, except that I only hd about half of the cheese that the recipe called for (I mis-judged at the grocery store).  It still turned out fantastic.  I can onlt imagine how rich it would have been with all of the cheese.  I will be making this again soon, and would definitely make it for company!

This soup was phenomenal!  Tasted like something you would get in a high end restaurant.  Very rich and creamy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly but instead of thickening with flour I thickened with 1 package of cream cheese (because I'm eating low carb).  The blue cheese flavor was mild enough for someone like me that enjoys blue cheese now and then but doesn't totally love it.

We found the blue cheese to be just a little bit funky in this, despite the fact that we like blue cheese quite a bit. Live and learn -- nothing wrong with this recipe. Thanks!

I made the recipe as written, only dividing everything in half. I sit at my computer eating the bowl of soup in the pictures I submitted and it is creamy and smooth and just the right thickness, but extremely light in both spinach and bleu cheese flavors. Oh, they are there, but you've got to concentrate to find them. No doubt that is why young children and spinach- or bleu cheese-hating adults like it, and that in itself is a plus for the recipe. However, I was looking for something stronger in flavor. I'll make it again and make my broth with lots of spinach plus double the amount bleu cheese. PS: I used no-salt-added broth and added 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp cayenne and that seemed about right for the half-recipe.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!  Both my kiddos ate it and it is very hard to get them to eat veggies (especially green ones).  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm a big fan of blue cheese and cheese soups, so I thought I would love this. Unfortunately, I didn't care for it, and neither did anyone else I tried to give it to. It didn't seem creamy enough for a cheese soup. I made it according to the instructions, except that I used fresh spinach as some other reviewers did.

Who would've thought to put blue cheese and spinach in a soup?!?!  It was delicious!  Followed the recipe pretty closely only using fresh spinach, switching evap milk for cream and just sprinkling real bacon bits on top upon serving. And I didn't puree.  Would've liked to see it thicken a bit more.  Might up the flour some next time.

This was a tasty soup. Just to make it easier, I did not puree it and completely omitted the cream, and it was just as good.

I used half canned broth, half homemade broth, and I cut back on the spinach a little as I'm not a huge fan of it. Absolutely outstanding. Rich, delicious, simple to make. Thanks, Holly!

It tasted okay, but I would advise using fresh spinach....I liked it better hot than cold.

I used gorgonzola, not that special a result. It was good but not great. I question whether bleu cheese would have vastly improved it. but it was a decent dinner, reheatable lunch, and freezable future meal.

This was an absolutely AWESOME soup!  I love finding recipes that are not your normal "safe" recipes to try.  When I told people I was going to make this soup, they cringed at the name...especially my boyfriend (who went back for seconds!)but I am so glad I'm willing to try new, interesting things!!  I only made a few changes...I halved the recipe, which then called for 4 oz of blue cheese, but I still added the 8 oz it called for in the original recipe.  (I bought a generic brand of blue cheese and it was VERY mild...after adding the 4 oz, I couldn't taste ANY blue cheese taste).  I also added some cooked chicken, and some white cooking wine with lemon flavoring (about 1/2 cup).   I will DEFINITELY make this again, but will not half it next time so I can freeze some!

I really enjoyed this soup! I added a minced garlic clove and some parsley and used fresh spinach. I also did not puree and really enjoyed the end result. This one is a keeper.

Great recipe.  The blue cheese was not overpowering at all.  The only change I made was to skip the cayanne pepper entirely (don't like it) and I sprinkled Hormel Real Bacon Bits on top instead of cooking a whole pound of bacon. This recipe makes a TON of soup.  For a small family, I'd cut the recipe in half.  My family enjoyed it.  Even my kids 2 1/2 & 4 who are not blue cheese eaters gobbled it up.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow! I tried to halve the recipe but that still made three quarts. Instead of adding the flour to the hot oil and onions, I mixed the half cup of flour with cold water, which made one full cup(no lumps). In my Ninja I chopped an 8oz. pkg of fresh/frig dried spinich and used a cup of milk to help it move easier in the chopper. My machine is on the small side and I chopped all the spinich in two batches. In the pot with the butter and onions, I put chicken broth, the balance of the milk and slightly less than 8oz. of gorgonzola. I brought that to a boil with frequent stirring, then added the spinich/milk and stirred to a boil again. I lowered the heat,stirred in the heavy cream. I put some in a bowl with a pinch of ground sannam pepper and loved it, however, the rest of the family can't do hot peppers. We then tried ground black pepper and that touched it off nicely. I didn't have any bacon, but next time, I'm thinking that some deeply browned lean ground beef, cooked in olive oil and some garlic, would be nicer to mix into the soup. Oh yeah, I put in extra onions and only sauteed them on low heat till they turned clear. As green as it is, this would be a great St.Patricks meal starter before a lamb stew.

The soup turned out awesome. After I had salted it to taste, I puree'ed the bacon in with the soup which made it a little bit saltier... Whoops. Next time I'll salt to taste afterwards. Great soup!

This was quite good.  I pureed during the first step after adding about half the broth. This avoids putting hot liquid into the food processor and removes any lumps that developed when I was distracted from stirring.  It then went back into the pot with the rest of the broth and proceeded according to directions except that I used fresh baby spinach leaves and left them whole. The aroma of bleu cheese permeates the house, which might be a consideration for party food, whether it's a plus or not.  I omitted the cream and bacon for health reasons and didn't miss them. I think it would also be great with chopped Brussels sprouts or mushrooms instead of spinach.

Wow-wow-wow!!  Wasn't quite sure how this would turn out, but I LOVE IT!!  Used half-and-half instead of the heavy cream.  Also left out the bacon garnish (too lazy to make it!).  I loved that it called for frozen spinach.  It's easy to keep everything needed on hand for a spur-of-the-moment treat.  THANK YOU All Recipes!!  This will go in my "make again" file for sure!!

Recommended by a friend to try and glad I did!!! I used only 1/2 pound bacon. Fried it 1st off so I could use 2 Tbl of grease with butter. I also added 1 glove chopped garlic with the onions. I went heavy on the blue cheese and it was wonderful!

I was so excited to make this. I read all the reviews...followed the directions EXACTLY and waited for a wonderful soup.  The only thing I got was a mess.   I love spinach, and I love blue cheese.  I even love them together in salad.  But as far as this soup goes....

I had similar thoughts as some other reviewers, not sure if this was a good foor combination or not, but boy was it!  Great soup, even my three kids under 6 ate and they usually won't eat spinach let alone blue cheese.

I love this soup!  I have made it twice now.  The first time I only had 5 ounces of blue cheese and liked it MUCH better than using 8 ounces.  In the future I will continue to cut back the amount of blue cheese.

This soup is terrific! Both my sisters-in-law wanted the recipe and both made it the day after I served it.

I used chicken boullion granules, and it didn't need salt or pepper. I  skipped Step 3 entirely, including the bacon.

Freezes perfectly. Make it a day ahead, if possible. If your family likes spinach and blue cheese, don't miss this!

I'm not a fan of blue cheese but my husband is. So I halved the amount of blue cheese. My husband and I liked it very much! But this recipe does yield quite a lot of soup.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars -- only because although i thoroughly enjoyed it, my husband did not...so I quess I must add that this soup has a particular taste for particular taste buds! But if you like the spinach/artichoke dip from TGIF, then you will love this!

Wow this is yummy! I made half a batch but used about 2/3 the blue cheese called for in the original recipe.  It was super!  The half-recipe made at least 6 LARGE dinner-sized portions.

UPDATE: I made this again recently, made a full batch but doubled the called for amount of blue cheese. I used two varieties, Maytag and a smoked blue. The smoked blue gave it a great flavor. And using an emersion blender is the only way to go. Super easy.

Made this soup exactly per the directions, it was wonderful. Both my husband and I love it as a main dish, very filling! The recipe makes lots of soup, so I froze it. This  soup recipe freezes very well. You could change the vegetables around to mix it up a bit!

The first time I made it following the recipe, other than veggie broth instead of chicken, and omitting the bacon since my husband is vegetarian. He liked it and gave it 4 stars, but I don't care for bleu cheese and really didn't like it. The second time, I omitted the bleu cheese, used fresh spinach, and instead of cream, I used 4 oz light cream cheese, and 1/4 c of grated parm. I also thicken all my cream soups with 1 c of quinoa instead of flour, before blending. If you blend until smooth, you'd never know there was quinoa in it, and you get all that added protein. For me, it's 5 stars with my changes.

Very good tasting soup! I omitted the onions and used 2 bags of fresh spinach. Great combo of the blue cheese and spinach. We ate this one hot. Will make again!

The first time I made this....it was a mess, there was too much of it, it wasn't very thick, didn't look very appetizing, and while it tasted OK, I had to do a lot of 'tweak as I ate'.

However, I thought this was promising, so what I did the second time was halved everything except the chicken broth and the flour.  I only used four cups of chicken broth, and 3/4th cup of flour.  I also added the briefish splash of lemon juice.  This time I got creamier soup with a better balance of tastes, and a much more pleasing color to the eye.  I also got 8 cups of soup (I consider 1 cup to be a serving), so I won't have tons of it leftover--which was another problem I had with the initial recipe.

We both loved this recipe. I blended half and left half alone. I used fresh spinach and left out the bacon. I don't like bacon in soup. I used milk, but will use cream or cream cheese next time. I used 5oz cheese because  I didn't check the package size, it still came out fantastic. Experimenting with different spices changes the flavor dramatically but in a way that is just as tasty as  the original.

This made way more soup then we could possibly ever eat so if there's only two of you, I strongly recommend cutting this recipe by 75% which is what I will do next time.  I did double the blue cheese, used 8 oz cream cheese and only 3 cups of milk and used 2 fresh bags (20 oz) of fresh baby spinach.  Forgot to add the bacon bits the first night but remembered the second night. I don't think they really added all that much.  I did puree mine and I really can't imagine anyone not puree-ing this.  It was extremely unappetizing prior to the puree and I would never serve it to anyone like that. It just looked like a big pot of warm milk with green leaves floating in it. Ugh. Anyway this was really good soup after the puree with a full teaspoon of cayenne because we like the bite. I'm adding it to my regular soup collection but I've got two large containers in my fridge leftover that will go to waste so next time, cutting way back on the quantities. I'm going to try freezing what I have leftover and see if it holds up. Update:  Can confirm that this soup holds up to being frozen.  We had one of two frozen portions already and it might be even better than the day I made it.  Even more reason to keep on regular soup rotation.

We made this with fresh chard instead of spinach (what I had on hand) and didn't garnish with bacon. Very yummy. It makes a lot and was great reheated the next night too.

I read the comments before I made this soup and I used the cream cheese which made it amazing and I didn't purée the soup which I rely liked and I think it's great wo the bacon if you don't want to hassle w it.

Rich and delicious! The bleu cheese flavor is so distinctive, so make sure you really love it! I used less broth and milk, and omitted the cream entirely. It was thick and creamy. Perfect!

Super, I ran too low on blue cheese so added grated cheddar as well, a lovely soup.
Careful with the cayenne it gets stronger as soup matures.

Delicious and made exactly as written except using fresh spinach and vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Word of caution - you really have to love bleu cheese to like this soup.  The taste is VERY, VERY strong.

This soup is absolutely amazing.  I used the recipe calculator to halve the ingredients.  I make a batch and then freeze it for easy weknight meals.  I have made this at least 5 times.  You can heat a bowl of soup and make some pasta and dinner is ready in less than a half hour.

This was really yummy. I guess that for some reason, I was expecting a creamier thicker soup. Even the kiddos liked it. We sprinkled it with bacos instead of using bacon.

Fantastic recipe and a definite keeper.  My kids gobbled it up and my hubby, who is not a soup fan, decided he wanted seconds.  

My modifications: I broiled the bacon while I was starting the onions and butter.  I added precooked cut chicken breast meat when I added the broth.  I used the bacon grease to saute mushrooms I added near the end.  I omitted the 4 cups milk as my pan was getting too full and substituted a can of condensed milk for the heavy cream.

Made this soup very quickly with ingredients from around the house and loved it! Didn't realize we were out of cream, so omitted that as well as the bacon and it was wonderful!
