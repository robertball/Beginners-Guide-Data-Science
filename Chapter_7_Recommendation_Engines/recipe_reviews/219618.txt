While I like the idea of the cupcake flavors, the result is far too processed-tasting.  Perhaps taking the idea and converting to ingredients that are less chemical/pre-made will be the next step.

Yummy! Wow these are really good. I made no changes to the recipe. Creamsicles are my favorite popsicle so I was really excited about this cupcake. And they came out great. Lovely orange flavor. My hubby who is usually a one sweet kind of guy ate 3 while I was still frosting them. They kept disappearing. Easy to put together and they came out really pretty. I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

Orange Dreamsicle+Dream Whip+Miracle Whip=My Boyfriend In Love. I made these for my boyfriend's birthday and almost everyone loved them. A few of us, including myself, thought the orange flavor was a little to pronounced which really took away from the cream filling. (I filled the cupcakes with the marshmallow cream mixture) I would make these again but will probably skip the orange zest in the cupcake itself, since it is already orange flavored. Thank you for this recipe :O)

Wonderful recipe. I like a few others didn't have access or on hand, orange cake mix. So I had to do a little doctoring..not much but it worked. I asked the submitter about the difference if using mayo verses Miracle Whip before executing the recipe and was told it shouldn't make a difference. SO I proceeded. Everything came together nicely and the marshmallow creme frosting was very nice and light, which gave a nice contrast to the orange flavored that topped it. I will make again My kids just loved them. TY TY TY it's delish.

I reviewed this a few days ago but the review disappeared via an AR glitch.  So here's a new review.  I made the frosting only from this recipe.  I added two teaspoons of orange extract to it.  The orange flavor was very good and the frosting piped well.  I used the frosting on Marianne's Sweet Vanilla Cupcakes and it was a perfect vanilla creamscicle kind of flavor.  Thank you MrsFisher0729 for sharing your recipe.

Oh my gosh - DELICIOUS!  I love orange anything and these cupcakes ranked right at the top of my favorite orange tasting foods.  I made these into mini's and the recipe made 98 cupcakes.  I had cupcakes for the neighbors, 3 friends and their families, co-workers at school, my own family and I froze 2 dozen of them.  The frozen cupcakes with frosting thawed very nice and competely held their shape. The filling and frosting are such a wonderful topping for the cupcake.  Thanks Mrs.Fisher0729 for sharing this recipe!

These were amazing. Ignore the calories. This is well worth the splurge. I made 28 rather than 24 and had none left at the end of the day. This will be a repeat!

OMG!! Amazing!! Delicious! I couldnt get these iced fast enough. My son was eating them without icing on them. Definitely recommend making the filling/icing 1st. The only thing i had to do was use vanilla cake mix(i couldnt find orange). I added orange food coloring to the cake batter & followed everything else exactly. EXCELLENT recipe. Tastes just like a creamsicle. Thank you for sharing. :)

I got about 28 cupcakes out of this recipe. It turned out great! I didn't change a thing. If you are making this for someone who LOVES the flavor orange this will be a hit! And the buttercream piped great! YUM!!!!

I made these for the first time over the weekend for a party and they were the biggest hit!!  I was even asked to make them for a baby shower coming up later this month.  Many party go-ers were eating at least 2 at a time.  Great recipe and so easy to follow!!

These were good and I got some good feedback but I wasn't "super" pleased with them. I didn't like the lack of sweetness in the white icing and ended up adding some powdered sugar and a little vanila to the icing. They were pretty though! Would make them again, but only for an orange lover!

I made these for my daughters 2nd birthday into cup cakes.  They were a huge hit!  I didn't add the food coloring because I was making them into a spagetti cake and I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  Will make again!

They were just ok - I made them almost exact to recipe, and found that they were a lot of work, and the two different kinds of icing is probably not necessary.  The orange had a slight artificial flavor, although they did taste like orange creamsicle.

I also couldn't find an orange cake mix and used a golden mix instead and added a tsp of orange extract to the freshly squeezed O-J. The cake turned out great, orange flavour and moist.  Trouble started when I made the marshmallow part of the icing, good thing I tried it before putting it on...all I could taste was the shortening, horrible! Is it possible that you're suppose to use butter OR vegetable shortening?  Instead of following the buttercream recipe as stated above, I left out the veg shortening and used only the butter, it turned out great.  Disappointed that I don't have the marshmallow but overall the cupcakes still tasted great.

I had second thoughts about this recipe when I saw that it had creamy salad dressing, but these were delicious! One small problem though, the marshmallow frosting tended to slide right of the cupcake! but that didnt matter since these were gone really quick. But beside that problem, these are fantastic and definitely worth a try!

5+ stars!  No adjustments needed for this recipe.  Made these for Easter dinner.  Gobbled up immediately!  Extra icing left though.  Plan on using it up on some Sugar Cookies!

Made as a contest with the grandkids.  Perfect.  There is a lot of  “orange elements” to this cupcake, but it is perfect. Very delicious. We did use the sugar sprinkles. I would leave this off,  the cupcake doesn’t need it at all!!

Please disregard the one star I gave this recipe.  I have not made these.  I had to give it a star in order to leave a comment/ask a question.  Has anyone made these without the Miracle Whip?  If so, how were they?  Can the Miracle Whip be substituted with something else?  I love orange creamsicle, and I so much want to make these but the thought of putting salad dressing in a cupcake mix scares the heck out of me.  I just can't do it.  Especially Miracle Whip.  That stuff is aweful!

Made this for Father's Day. My husband gave them ten stars. A little time consuming but very good. I think the cream filling is missing something (a little greasy tasting). Maybe next time I will leave out shortening and just use butter and maybe add some vanilla. Will definitely be making again!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!
