This is a distinctive cookie and the result is quite enjoyable. The texture is more like that of a blondie, just in a cookie shape.  I followed the recipe and instructions exactly and enjoyed the final product.  This recipe is deceiving in that it seems simply (due to the few ingredients), but is actually hard to do correctly, because the dough is very dry. If the chef over mixes, the glutens will become tough and ruin the cookie.

These cookies were an instant favorite the first time I made them and they are a "hit" everytime.  The only thing I would suggest is to flatten them slightly before baking.  The dough freezes well and I often mix up a double batch and freeze half.

EXCELLENT base recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used 3 over ripe bananas, substituted splenda for the white sugarand used old fashioned oats for 1/3 cup of the flour.  Also used two heaping  1/4cup fulls of chunky, natural peanut butter.  I could not keep my two year old out of these.

These were an interesting change of pace--not exactly cookie consistency, but still delicious. A great way to use up leftover bananas. I used two bananas, 1/2 c of chocolate chips and natural pb to make mine. I agree with another reviewer to flatten the cookies before you bake them. I will make them again.

I had to change the recipe a little, my boys are allergic to peanuts, so I used soynut butter. I didn't have any brown sugar so I use 3/4 c. of white sugar and dipped my leveling knife into molasses and added that to the mixture.  I also took a tip from one of the other reviews and used cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips, and I feel it strengthens the flavor of the banana.  The dough was extemely sticky and I wasn't sure how they were going to turn out, but like other reviews it's crisp on the outside with a soft and chewy inside.  This is a recipe we will surely keep.  It's a different type of cookie, but my boys loved them. It almost seems hard to mess this recipe up, so see what you can come up with.

Im sorry but I did not like these cookies at all. I LOVE the combination of chocolate, peanut butter and banana and I was so excited to try these. I followed the recipe exactly and I took the advice of previous reviews and flattened the cookie before baking. I didnt like the texture, color or taste. sorry!

This is a good recipe for me, since I like to make small batches of cookies (less guilt when we finish the batch in one sitting).  Since there are no eggs, this is easy to scale down.  These tasted REALLY good and were extremely soft.  Next time I'll probably cut the white sugar down by half, because they were a little sweeter than I prefer.

Great recipe if you have no eggs or butter! I was surprised how well this turned out without those ingredients. It's a very satisfying cookie.

I made these cookies because I needed to get rid of an overripe banana and my husband loves peanut butter and banana sandwiches.  Their texture is wonderful.  Lightly crisp outside, and chewy inside.  Unfortunately, hubbie wasn't overly impressed with the flavor.  I thought they were pretty good if not a bit odd.  It seems the tastes of banana and peanut butter are fighting for dominance!  And the chocolate chips at only 1/4 C, are hardly enough to matter.  I would either leave them out or put in a 1/2 C instead.  I didn't mind them, nice to have something sweet around, but probably won't make them again.

I decided to make these cookies because I absolutely love the combination of peanut butter and banana! I used whipped peanut butter instead of regular and Splenda blend instead of the white sugar. The mixture was a bit dry, so I added about 1.5 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce. They turned out pretty well! The banana flavor was not strong, but neither was the peanut butter; however, I thought they turned out well considering my substitutions, and it cut the calories by almost 20 calories per cookie!

I used whole wheat flour for this recipe and these cookies are awesome! You do need to flatten them like other reviewers suggested and you could probably add more chocolate if you wanted. I will be making these again and again! Thank you for such a yummy recipe!

Loved this! And it's acutally pretty guilt free...with beneficial stuff in there. (Bananas, peanut butter). I added just a LIIIIL more peanut butter cuz I'm a PB fiend. But still delicious as is! I mixed up from choc. chips to walnuts too for experiment. It's a fun recipe for sure!

I used 2 over-ripe bananas, and took the suggestion of using cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips.  I also noted the suggestion of not overbeating once the flour was added, and just folded in the flour till mixed. I chilled the dough well before scooping into rounds of a heaping tablespoon for baking, then dipped the balls in sugar and did not press them down before baking. They came out puffy with cracks on top, crispy outside, tender and moist inside.  I could taste all three flavors; the peanut butter, banana and chocolate.   If you wanted a flatter cookie, pressing them down lightly would accomplish this, but I like the soft center created by leaving the balls "unflattened."    Warning- they do not keep well.

This is exactly what I was looking for in a banana cookie.  I didn't have brown sugar, so I used 3/4 cup sugar with about a teaspoon of molasses.  I also used a cup of vegan chocolate chips which made a perfect blend of peanut butter, banana and chocolate.  It makes a nice vegan cookie without having to sub eggs and butter.  Yum Yum!!!

Not crazy about these......would make banana bread to get the same effect and it would taste better.  I still give it three stars since I didn't put the chips in it but used cocoa powder instead.  Next time my over-ripe bananas will be used for something else......not that thet tasted bad just not worth the time

I didn't have brown sugar or chocolate chips when I made these cookies.  Instead, I used 1 cup of the white sugar.  Also, I added 1/3 cup cocoa powder to the flour and baking powder mixture which gave the cookies a wonderful rich chocolate flavour and colour.  They soft and chewy, just the way I like them!

it was chewy and soft. And easy to make! Made a few adjustments. I used chunky peanut butter! I also used 1/4 cup hazelnut nutella instead of chocolate chips and baking soda instead of baking powder and it worked out just fine!

These were ok, but not something I would make again. Too much time and effort for only an ok tasting cookie.

Interesting cookies, a little doughy on the inside, but the flavours were really good, I used half peanut-butter chips(I'm a peanut-butter fiend!) and that worked really well, I took everyone's advice and pressed them with a fork and sugar and I'm glad I did, they don't really spread all that much, I think they would be even doughier if I hadn't, all in all I don't think I'll be making them again anytime soon

This is a good recipe...I love the texture. My husband and I weren't big fans of the banana taste though, so I substituted applesauce instead and they came out great!

Although my hubby liked these cookies, I found the flavours competing with each other.  We ate this batch, but I won't be making these again.

I used half baking powder & half soda, a ton more chocolate chips, and added 1 egg.  They were fluffy & delicious!  couldn't really tell the peanut butter was in there though.

I'm putting five stars for my alterations to the recipe. I added one egg and a fourth cup of coconut oil. I also upped the flour to a cup and a half.  Kids loved them. I loved them! Hopefully you'll love them. Happy cookie making!

These were really interesting and pretty yummy! The consistency is light and semi-spongy, different from normal cookies but overall very good. They made a great snack for hiking. These were super easy to make and brought me out of my cookie-disaster slump.

Love the idea & recipe... Tried it couple of times, my boys love it.  The last time I made, I forgot to set timer, so it was over baked on one of the two batches.  It was hard as a rock after it's cool down, LOL! :)

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I really think it needs an extra 1/4 c of peanut butter. Other than that, delicious and picture perfect! These little cookies come out looking adorable! I have to say, I was really pleasantly surprised by these cookies.

I love baking (and eating the rewards of what I bake) but these cookies....awful!  I didn't mind the texture (they are soft, chewy) but the taste.  Just not good!  You must keep the dough chilled to be able to work the cookies into a ball - very, VERY sticky dough.  Would not make again and definitely would not recommend.

I did not like these and the kids thought they were "just ok".  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did take out of the oven at 8 minutes because they were getting too dark.  The texture is wrong, not like a cookie.  And I thought the flavor is gross.  I usually like pb and banana, but it just came out too strong, like bad bananas or something.  I won't be making it again.

I really liked the combination of banana and peanut butter, but I feel like with all the other ingredients that it was just too much.  They were good, but I feel like it had a healthy taste but with the amount of sugar in it I couldn't eat too many or I felt sick.  I think next time I will make a couple changes.

I LOVED this cookie, not only was it simple to make but quite delicious as well. I like that it is low calorie but flavorful too. No eggs, no oil, no butter and I love that. I did add a 1/4 C. of chocolate chips and pressed to cookie between my palms after I rolled it and they turned out so yummy.

Good recipe for a soft banana cookie. However, I hoped that the PB would put them rather on the crispy side, which was not the case; what is more, I barely tasted the PB. Not to be remembered as a PB cookie, but rather as a banana cookie that tastes good...

These were very easy to make but we found them just "okay".  The banana flavor is very overwhelming and unfortunately my family wasn't impressed.  Thanks anyway.

I was excited for this recipe because I like bananas and peanut butter and of course chocolate. The cookies have an interesting flavor, but are too sweet. Might be better if it includes butter and an egg.

These cookies are excellent. I substituted part of the all purpose flour with oat bran flour to make them a little healthier. They have everything a good cookie needs - chocolate and peanut butter, and that little hint of banana makes them just perfect.

Craving has nothing on these little cookies, gluttony is far more the sensation. Fantastic and easy. Crisp on the outside, chewey in the middle. We had to keep tasting them as they were cooling down to ensure the optimum eating time...there are only 6 left now - I'd best whip up another batch!

My son found this recipe due to the fact it did not contain milk or egg products of which he can have none.  I was alittle leary of the recipe due to the lack of all that wonderful butter but made them for him.  They didn't flatten out in the oven as I expected but the result was great.  A semi flat cookie with a thin crust and moist and tender inside. And they taste as any other chip cookie with the slight taste of banana mixed with chocolate!  Yummm,,,
