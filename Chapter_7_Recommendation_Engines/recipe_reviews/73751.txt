i hate when people change everything and then review the recipe poorly BUT i have made this many times (exact instructions first then made changes).  this cake rocks.  the glaze is delish.  i find light brown sugar tastes way better in it than dark.  i also baked it at 325 for 70 min.  i used half white and half brown sugar and sub'd apple sauce in for 1/3 the amount of oil. (1/2 cup ap. sauce, 1 cup oil)  i also increased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  that's my fave way.  made it for my aunt's bday.  she hates sweets and had a second piece!

I've already made this cake twice this week because I just can't get enough of it! 
I did take the advice of several reviews to bake @ 325 for 70 minutes, and used applesauce for 1/3 of the oil - thanks!
I also used the tips to put foil or a paper plate under the rack to catch the glaze drippings - until today. 
Instead, I put the cake plate under the rack, then set the cake right on top of all the drippings - no mess to clean, no waste, and now underneath is saturated as well. Mmm-mmm!

I substituted 1/3 of the oil with applesauce, doubled the cinnamon, added a dash of nutmeg, substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar, and half of the other half of white sugar with Splenda. To use as much of the glaze as possible, I put a large plate underneath the cooling rack as I drizzled the glaze on the cake, and then switched to a clean plate. Then, I drizzled the glaze that dripped onto the first plate. The only thing that seems off is the cooking time and temp. 325 F for 70 minutes was enough.

OMG! This apple cake is so moist and so delicious! It's the perfect fall dessert.  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and next time I would probably cut back on the oil because it was almost too moist.  I used 3 Granny Smith apples and didn't add the walnuts to the cake but rather sprinkled them over top of the cake along with the caramel glaze which was fabulous.  I did add just a splash of vanilla to that to give it more of that "caramel" flavor.

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday and everyone loved it! They raved over the caramel glaze and loved the fact that it had apples and walnuts in it. I'll be making this for future family get-togethers, too!

This was SOOOOO yummy!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, the Splenda browqn sugar blend instead of brown sugar and added 2 extra apples.  AWESOME, moist and sooooo tasty.

I served this at a party and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe! It was great because I made it the day before the party and just drizzled the glaze over it when I was ready to serve it. I doubled the cinnamon like others had suggested and only baked it for 70 minutes at 325. It was moist and delicious! I'll make it again for sure.

I thought this was very tasty but I found the batter to be really thick and the end result was a dense cake with a very hard crust.  I agree with another reviewer to cook this for less time.  I would also double the caramel glaze because I couldn't taste it at all.  All that said, everyone still enjoyed it and I will try it again with some changes!

This cake was DELICIOUS!  My whole family loved it.  It was very, very easy to make.  The only change I made was that I doubled the cinnamon and the cake was moist and wonderful.  The smell was heavenly also.  The glaze was a nice touch.  Thank you for the recipe, I'm sure I'll be making this many, many times in the future.

My husband fell in love with me all over again.  I didn't have a bunt pan.  I used a regular cake pan.  I cooked it for 85 min.  did half sugar and half brown sugar.  No nutz.  Added nutmeg and more cinnamon.  The glaze I had trouble with. It was really watery when I put it on the cake.  But still tasted great.  I did find a recipe for the glaze that is perfect.  1 stick of butter melt in pan then add 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1 cup of brown sugar!  Perfect!

As written, this cake has too much oil. I cooked it at 325 for 70 minutes and doubled cinnamon, per reviews. I did not have any applesauce so I could not sub. it for the oil. It is worth trying again with the 1cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce. Maybe then I can give it 5 stars. After baking, it still tasted too "wet" for me. Nice taste though.

WOW!!! Very yummy cake!!! Not a big apple fan but was looking for something different to make for my dad's birthday. I am so glad I did or I would have missed out on what is now one of my favorites. I have since made it 4 more times all to rave reviews. Family, friends and co workers... they all love it. Have another baking right now! I did as others said and dropped the temp to 325 and the cook time to 70 minutes. Comes out perfect everytime. Also, I double the caramel sauce using dark brown sugar and half and half instead of milk... butter is also a must. No margarine... That being said. if you have not already made this cake then what are you waiting for??? It is amazing!!!  Thanks so much for this incredible recipe! I will be making it for years! =)

I, too, am one who has never written a review, until now.  This cake is wonderful.  I always have awful experiences when trying new recipes (or any recipes for that matter). But this cake is scrumptious.  I made it on Saturday and by Sunday it was almost gone.  And there were only two people in the house at the time.  I was concerned when I made the glaze because it is awfully wet, but I ended up loving it because it gets a little crusty and gives the cake an almost coffe cake texture on top.  It is incredible; I will make this cake many times in the future.

Most of the time, I have either Fugi or Gala apples on hand and I used those (one each) in this cake in lieu of the Granny Smiths. I also split the sugar between white and brown. I let it sit for an entire day before I let DH know I had a cake baked. I don't know if that helped the flavors meld or not. I do know that it surely did not hurt!! The only thing that really bothers me is that I wanted to take a picture and submit it. The cake was beautiful, absolutely delicious and gone in a flash. DH took half to work where 4 co-workers have asked for the recipe and I shared the remaining half with BF and neighbor. Will I do this one again? You betcha!!

Superb! I made this last night & half is already gone.  I dropped off some to my daughter's babysitter & co-workers and everyone wants it for their next gathering.  I made minor substituions. Instead of 2 cups white sugar, I used 1 c. white & 1 c. brown.  I only used 1 apple too.  It was awesome and I will be making it for my family's table this & every Thanksgiving to come.

Excellent. I made it as written and it was very good. Only suggestion I have, is you need to let the caramel glaze cool and thicken before you pour it over or it all pours off.

This cake is really good. I followed other reviews and used 1/2c. applesauce and 1c. olive oil. I also used 1cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. The apples I had were on the small side. I shredded 5 apples, skins and all. I did lower the oven temp to 325, but it took longer than 70 minutes to bake. One review recommended doubling the glaze. I made 1&1/2, and I think making the regular amount would have been fine. I did add 1tsp vanilla and 1-2 tsp cinnamon. I thought it called for it. This cake was really good. Moist, but not really heavy. The glaze was good, and it didn't weigh down the cake, or make it soggy. This one is a keeper!!!

Brought to a family gathering and all said it was to die for! I did adjust the recipe according to many reviewers using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and doubling the cinnamon. Due to traveling, I spooned the caramel glaze on individual slices. The glaze makes the dessert! Was told I have to make it again for the upcoming holidays!

I did have to change this a little-couldn't find my Bundt pan and I am allergic to walnuts so I cut them out. Normally I don't review when I make changes because I feel like I am not really reviewing the recipe (wish more people felt this way). However... I feel like this is more or less the same cake and I wanted to rave! This cake was a huge hit at the dinner I went to. NO leftovers.

This was FABULOUS!  I boiled the glaze for about 90 seconds to make it more like caramel and then poured half of it over the cake on a cake plate.  I waited until it cooled and thickened slightly and then poured the rest over it.  It was like a caramel candy coating.  We couldn't stop eating it warm with vanilla ice cream on top!

I hate to change a recipe and rate it but.... if you are in a hurry or you are like me and don't have much luck with homemade cakes this may help...I used a white cake mix prepared as directed then added the vanilla, walnuts and apples kept everything else the same, this cake was so good next time I may add the cream to the glaze as the other reviewer suggested.

Very moist cake that I will make again.  Used modifications posted by other users and subbed 1/2C applesauce for 1/2C oil and reduced oven temp to 325 and baking time to 75 min.  Also, I'm too lazy to chop the apples so I grated them.

My son found this recipe 3 years ago and made it for me on Mother's Day.  I have requested it for my birthday and Mother's Day ever since! It is AMAZING! He also makes it for family gatherings and it is requested for those now too.

Wow! I have never, ever had so many people compliment my cooking so much! Only thing I changed was adding a half teaspoon of cinnamon because I really like cinnamon, and omitting the walnut because I didn't have any. Baked it at 325* for an hour. I poured the caramel onto the cake right onto the plate. After that, I cut up some apples and let them soak in some lemon water so they wouldn't brown, and placed the cut apples around the cake where the caramel was on the plate and into the hole of of the cake. It was nice to look at, and they served as apples dippers and an extra treat!!

This cake was a hit with all!  Very moist and perfect for an autumn dessert. I took the advice of others and used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of light brown sugar. I also doubled the cinnamon. I cooked it at 325 for a little over an hour.  For the glaze I increased the ingredients to 1 and 1/2  sticks of butter,  3 tsp of milk, and 3/4 cup of light brown sugar. I Let it boil for 2 minutes. Afterwards, I  remove it from heat and added a splash of vanilla. Then I beat it with a spoon until it thickened and was just  about to get a little dull.  Very easy cake to make!

What is there not to love - please don't change this recipe.   Granted it isn't for every day because it is rich but great for special occasions.

This cake is FABULOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly...I'm not really sure what I did wrong with the caramel glaze, because it was a little runny.  But it didn't matter, because the cake was fabulous with or without the glaze!

This cake was fabulous!! My lady friends all want the recipe!  I did follow the advice of a few before me and used one full teaspoon of cinnamon.  I substitued the granny smith apples with Fuji apples, I used half n half in the topping instead of milk and also added about 1/8 tsp. of vanilla to the topping.  I let it cool slightly before drizzling it on the cake. This is a recipe I will definitely use again!

Served this still warm and it was sooooo good!  I only had a cup of oil left so added 1/2 C melted butter, only used 1-1/2 C sugar, and 3 C of chopped up apples from my back yard.  It was done baking after only about an hour.  We really loved the caramel glaze over this!

I don't give many negative reviews but I'm doing this more for the sake that I remember not to make this cake again, at least per instructions. I followed the recipe exactly, though an overwhelming number of reviewers subbed applesauce for some of the oil and changed the bake time and temp. I did not have applesauce so I went ahead and followed the recipe as stated. It smelled delicious and the bake time as stated worked for me. The big turn-off for me is the amount of oil. It was INCREDIBLY oily, so much so that it left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even finish my piece.  Perhaps it would be better with the applesauce substitute but I think I'll just keep looking for another apple bundt cake. Sorry, as written, this just wasn't for me.

A good recipe, and delicious autumn dessert. I followed some reviewers and cut the oil content to 1 cup, and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. This keeps the moisture without making it greasy, and adds more apple flavour. Also, I didnt believe the baking time when I read it so I checked it after 45 minutes and it was done, a bit overdone even. I reccomed checking after 35 minutes.

I just made this for my granpa's 66th birthday and he LOVED it!! I have never made a bundt from scratch so I was a little worried, but I followed the recipe to a T except I did take the advice of other's with cooking temp and time at 325 70min. It was super moist and delish, a gorgeous non traditional birthday cake thanks for sharing!

Ahhh, this cake tastes really good, it's really sweet though.  I'm making this cake for my girlfriend's birthday and this was trial run since she's out of town.  The only thing I did different was use a 10in Bundt pan instead of a nine. Also I baked at 325 for 70 minutes like some of the other reviwers suggested although I don't think 10 more minutes would have made to much of a difference, but maybe so.     I got excited and flipped the pan to early so it fell apart a little but it's still somewhat entact.  Good lookin cake and a good recipe.

This is a great bundt cake! So moist and delicious! I served the sauce on each piece as rec--warmed up the sauce and served w/ vanilla ice cream. I made a few slight changes based on comments:  I used 1 t. cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. Cut oil a bit to 1 and 1/4 cups.  I used 2 large Granny Smiths apples and used pecans, as I didn't have walnuts. Baked 70 minutes at 325F.  Came out perfectly and everybody loved it--even w/o sauce eaten for breakfast.

This was a great spur of the moment cake. The topping took minutes and the cake was easy as well. Apple pound cake, caramel topping, a great combination.

I must say this was so simple to make! My daughter and I made this together! I did read reviews and I made a couple of changes. I used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar, 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce and 1 c of oil. I did not put in walnuts. Overall this is a great recipe!

I have never ever reviewed a recipe before but this was so good I couldn't pass up the review! I Followed suggestions of using half white and half brown sugar, used a teaspoon of cinnamon and baked on 325 for 70 mins. Mine was actually done in 68 minutes. I didn't have vegetable oil or applesauce so I used crisco (wasn't worried about trying to make this low cal obviously). I also used 4 small gala apples instead of Granny Smith. Wow this was so good and my husband and I both said it's the best thing I've baked so far!

I didn't add any nuts due to allergies, but this was a delicious homemade cake. It seemed a bit dense for my family's taste, but it is something that I'd make again anyway because it had such wonderful flavor. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a delicious cake, solid 4 stars, but 5 stars with changes.  I made it twice.  The first time I did like other reviewers and subbed 1 C brown sugar for the white, increased the cinnamon to  1 teaspoon and added applesauce for 1/3 of the oil.  The second time, I didn't have enough brown sugar so I used the 2 cups white sugar and it was even better.  A lot better and I preferred the color as well.  This was our Thanksgiving dessert, but it was quite nice in the morning with coffee or tea.  I will make this again, perfect for fall!

I made this for a project in my baking class.  The chef and others thought it was really good.  I brought the left overs home and my dad gladly ate them up.  It is a nice tender cake with the perfect amount of spice and apples.  It goes really well with homemade ice cream.

This was absolutely fantastic.  I did take the advice of some fellow reviewers below, and made a handful of changes to make it healthier.. but this was demolished at Thanksgiving!  I used 1 cup of suger/splenda blend in place of 2 cups of white sugar, 1 cup of applesauce in place of 1 cup of oil, replaced one egg with an egg white, used 1.5 cups of white flour and 1.5 cups of wheat flour and upped the baking soda to 2 teaspoons.  I also used 3 apples instead of 2.

I thought there was actually too much glaze so next time I'll reduce the butter by half.  I also replaced the brown sugar with 1/4 cup of splenda/brown sugar mix. 

I also cooked on 325 for about 65 minutes.  70 minutes was a bit too long. 

This was amazing though! Thanks!

CARAMEL GLAZE was 5 stars! I came to this recipe looking just for the glaze (already had an apple cake made), and this glaze was super easy and a big hit.

This is very delicious and I don't like things with apples! I used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce and  I did bake at 325 for 70 minutes.  It is so perfect and very moist.  I feel bad for the people that this didn't work out for!  For the glaze I also added vanilla and cinnamon. Now I understand the people saying that they will make this for Thanksgiving...because I will as well! Thanks!!!

Took this to a halloween party, everyone loved it. Only thing I changed was cooking time because my oven is hot.

This cake is soooo good, after reading the reviews I put in 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. The cake is very moist, will be making again. I didnt add the glaze, I dont think it really needs it

This is one of those cakes that tastes better the next day.  I have to admit that I did not care for the carmel topping, but it is easy enough to mix some icing sugar with milk, a bit of butter and some vanilla, then top this with some toasted walnuts. I had no problems with the cake being dry, but I would check for doneness at about an hour.

Excellent cake! I made it twice in one week! The only change I made was adding more cinnamon. I used 1 1/2 tsps.

Wonderful cake.  And easy to make.  Served it to 30 people today and got many requests for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe to serve my crowd. We poured the sauce over each serving rather than over the whole cake. I'll be making this cake again in the near future.

This was excellent, super moist and full of flavor,Mine of course stuck, slightly but I think I didn't let it cool completely.  Because it was so moist I could easily tack it back and the glaze covered any rough spots. I would only change my cooling time on the counter everything else was GREAT!

I thought this cake was okay. I made it, along with two other desserts for my thanksgiving dinner. Some people said it as their favorite. For me, it just didn't do it... Maybe, like other reviewers said, it had too much oil... Not sure.

Veryyyyy very delicious! Its similar and much better than a streusel cake or coffee cake. Tastes like something that'd go greatttt with a cup of coffee
The caramel glaze all seeped to the bottom (best part) but it was clear and so the cake didn't look frosted. Suggest using something to make it thicker and/or perhaps mix in some powdered sugar for aesthetic purposes

Made this cake for a co-workers B'day.  Everyone raved.  It was great.  Will make again and again I'm sure.  I will use cream instead of milk next time but it was great just by the recipe.

Wow!  After making this cake I knew it would go over well, but I had no clue how EVERYONE would rave about it.  My neice, who NEVER eats anything even had 2 slices and took another 2 home.  That's saying alot.  It was moist, not too sweet but sweet enough to cure a sweet-tooth.  I used applesause instead of 1/2 the oil and baked it per the original recipe as far as time and temp.  I was quite a success, sadly there weren't any leftovers.

This cake has a nice taste but the batter is very thick. Once it's cooked, the inside is moist but the outside hard and crusty. Didn't love it!

I so wanted to love this, but didn't. I made it for a friends birthday. It was just ok, which was a dissappointment. I think this would be better stated as a bread than a cake.

So good and easy.  My daughter LOVED it and she hates all dessert with fruit.  The only modification I did was to use 1/2 Cup oil, 1/2 Cup applesauce and 1/2 Cup Pear sauce. Thanks for sharing.

the first time I made this exactly as directed and it came out very moist and tasty. the second time I made it I substituted 1/2 of apple sauce for 1 cup of the oil and it came out a little bit dry, but definitely still edible and tasty.

The best Apple Cake recipe I've ever made! By reading the other reviews I doubled the cinnamon & kept the cake in the oven for only 60 minutes. I used Honey Crisp apples which are sweet and juicy, and I used more apples. The cake was delicious with taste & moisture. Everyone loved it, and I will be making it often!

This cake is fantastic.  Perfect autumn cake on a rainy day.  I did change a couple of things-I only used 1c oil and added 1/2c apple sauce.  I also grated 1 apple w peel and chopped the other very fine.  Only made 1/2 the caramel(my daughter wanted me to make the rest so she could eat it w spoon-lol).  Oh the apples were gala.   I will definately make this a keeper.  Thanks so much for delicious cake!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and subbed 1/2c of applesauce for 1/2c oil.  I also used all whole wheat flour - that was probably a bit much, as it was much more hearty-tasting than most cakes.  I'd probably go 3/4 ww 1/4 white next time.  I added probably 4 medium/small chopped apples, and I'd add more next time. And, last sub: 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar.  I didn't go with the glaze, as I didn't want to add a stick of butter to this thing, and it was very tasty without it.  Disappeared very quickly.

This was the first recipe I ever saved on here and the first one i ever made - I'm still making this cake and always always being asked for the recipe -   This cake is amazing!! I've been trying to find good bundt cake recipes and this is the best yet!! The cake was moist for well over a week.  I just didn't add the nuts but added an extra apple. I kept the oil as it was, it was not too oily at all.  The whole family loved it and it will definately be made often!

This recipe was amazing.  It was moist, baked evenly, and had the right amount of apple (even though I worried it called for too much apple).  I followed the instructions exactly except I substituted cinnamon chips for walnuts (not a big nut fan) and followed the suggestions about the cooking time and temp. (325 for 70 mins) and for half/half white sugar and brown sugar.  I also used "caramel frosting I" as a glaze instead of the one in the recipe.

I think I proved that this is a fool-proof recipe last night when I made it for the 1st time! I went into it and realized I had 2 eggs, not 3, so I substituted 2 tsp water, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp butter and 2Tbsp flour. Then when it was so thick (it was like stirring play-doh lol) I added some milk and sour cream. I worried the whole time it baked, because I was due at a party with cake in hand. It was perfect! I didn't have time to wait the 20 minutes for the cake to settle, and turned it over immediately (next time, will wait because it wasn't as pretty) and the glaze was perfect amount, just using it while cake was on platter and not wire rack. So, while I made some major mistakes, all of my own making- this cake was perfection and I can't wait to make it again- the REAL way! lol Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out really good.  My only complaints were that I had way too much glaze and I had to adjust my baking time.  It got a little well-done on the bottom, but it was still good. I do think that next time I will halve the glaze.  I had to throw out a lot of it.

Amazing!!  I added extra apples, additional cinnamon, and apple sauce for 1/2 the oil.  Just be sure not to over bake!!  I've never have so many requests for the recipe.

Yumm. I followed several suggestions concerning brown sugar, applesauce and temp and this is a great cake. I drizzled the top with ice cream topping instead of preparing the glaze - only because I was distracted watching those Texas Tech Red Raiders win their football game. And five teenagers couldn't wait to dig in.

This cake was wonderful.  I like others added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce like some others did.  I didn't have walnuts so they were omitted.  I think the next time I make it I will let the cake cool completely before I put the glaze on it.  This is a keeper.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars!  This cake is scrumptious and easy to make!  Even my picky bf loved this cake and requested more.  The glaze and the cake are like the perfect combination!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked at 325 degrees for 70 minutes and my cake came out perfect each time.  Definitely a keeper because it's simply the best!

This was one of my first bundt cakes, and it turned out so great!  I loved how the glaze turned into a candy like shell.  It made for a very impressive dessert - served even to the inlaws!

I thought this cake was delicious!!! I love how the top of the cake was crunchy so that when you flip it over, it's like a crust! I didn't pour the glaze over the whole cake, I just drizzled it over individual pieces. With the leftovers, I didn't use the caramel at all, I just ate the cake the way it was for a breakfast treat! So YUMMY!

Awesome recipe.   I dont have a bundt pan, because I actually am not known to be the best baker, lol.  But this was a pretty easy recipe to follow and I put the mixture into a two 8" cake pans.  Surprisingly, it came out perfectly:).  I got so many compliments, that I'm looking for something else to try baking. The icing was my actual favorite.  Now I know how to make it!  thanks so much for sharing.   As far as all the people complaining about the oil or using applesauce, good onya, but its not necessary.  We don't eat tons of desserts at my house, so that's not an issue for my family.  This is a treat.  I wouldn't try a recipe with substitutes and then review it, lol.  Either make it as written or submit your own recipe.  When you change the recipe, you arent rating the recipe, your submitting yours.   Just do that to start with.

This an absolutely wonderful cake!  I made both a bundt and a two tier round cake to see which came out better.  The tiered cake I prefer because I added the caramel topping in between the layers and therefore it was more moist and more flavorful.  The bundt is a great coffee cake option because it is less sweet as the topping is light and most of the cake you will not be getting carmel with.  I cooked the round cake for about 28 minutes.  My husband took the tiered cake to a work function and it won out of almost 100 options.  We didn't even know about the contest!  It's a winner for sure!  Enjoy!

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it for a big group of people from church at our home last night, and they were raving about it, especially the guys and one of them asked for the recipe.  I followed a couple of suggestions from others and it turned out perfectly:  baked at 325 for 70 minutes, used 1 C white and 1 C brown sugar instead of all white, boiled the glaze for a little over a minute and let it cool/thicken for a few minutes before pouring over the cake.  Also, I did use the full amount of oil and it was not oily at all, but had the perfect consistency.
This will be one of my favorite recipes for desserts and I'll be making it often.

Really good cake! I did as suggested and baked at 325 for 70 minutes. Used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce cuz that's what I had.  Doubled cinnamon and added dashes of nutmeg and cloves. Used three granny smith apples and walnuts.  It was the perfect moistness! Caramel i used was 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 1 cup brown sugar and a dash of vanilla.  Very, very good, and definitely a keeper!

Used the revised recipe from LoveCheese.

“i hate when people change everything and then review the recipe poorly BUT i have made this many times (exact instructions first then made changes). this cake rocks. the glaze is delish. i find light brown sugar tastes way better in it than dark. i also baked it at 325 for 70 min. i used half white and half brown sugar and sub'd apple sauce in for 1/3 the amount of oil. (1/2 cup ap. sauce, 1 cup oil) i also increased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. that's my fave way. made it for my aunt's bday. she hates sweets and had a second piece!”

Good cake but not the best pound cake I have made.  Do not exclude the walnuts.

Wow! Great apple cake! The cake was moist, the caramel had a perfect crispy, sugary finish. The couple of minor changes I made was (1) partial substitution of applesauce for oil, and (2) I poured the nuts into the Bundt pan to form a crunchy 'topping' on the cake. I used all the caramel and puddled the extra in the center of the cake. By the time half of the cake was gone, so was the yummy puddle. I never imagined that an apple cake would be the star of our Thanksgiving meal. Delicious.

I love this cake.  I make it often here in fall as apples are ripe.  Excellent.  Cake can be dusted just with confectioners sugar if the Carmel glaze is too sweet.

Very very moist cake!  I let it rest before turning it out from the pan to allow it to continue cooking.  The caramel glaze does sink in to the cake if you let it set, which makes the cake even more moist.  If you are looking to wow your guests, you can drizzle the glaze over the cake right before serving for a beautiful presentation that will catch everyone's attention (who doesn't like watching caramel being drizzled on everything!).  I made no alterations, came out great.

My son's favorite cake. It is very moist and really delicious. The only change I make is to put 1 up of oil instead of 1 1/2. The first time I made it as written but we found it too oily. Also I use Golden apples because where I live we do not have Granny Smith.

I have been making this cake exactly the way it is for my family since I was a little kid (10 years old). Everyone who tries it, loves it. I will try to do some of the substitutes. This has been the best cakes I have ever made. I do make others but can't compare.

I fixed this for my family's Christmas dinner, and it was a hit.  Like other reviewers, I changed the baking time to 325 degrees/70 minutes, and it was perfect.  I used a different glaze and served it on the side.  I'll make this again.  Oh, I used 2.5 granny smith apples and substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.

This was amazing I never made a bundt cake....successfully lol.. but this one came out perfect I followed this to the T except for the apples I used just normal sweet red apples and instead of vanilla extract, I used almond extract. Overall this was an amazing recipe and I am definitely keeping this one on hand great texture, good crunch and so easy to make! Big kudos!

This cake is awesome.   I did make a goof, but it still came out great.  I had six eggs laying on the kitchen counter intending to use them for another recipe.  I mistakenly put all six in my cake recipe, but it came out just fine.   I did the suggested changes of 1 1/4 cup oil, one cup of white sugar, 1 cup of brown, 2 t. cinnamon and some ground cloves and nutmeg.  Baked it for 70 minutes in my convection oven at 330 degrees since I was worried that the six eggs would effect the cooking temperature.  Made it in a 10-inch angel food cake pan and it came out of the pan perfectly after cooling for 15 minutes.  Before adding the glaze I made some holes in the top of the cake with a toothpick.  That allowed more glaze to seep into the cake.

I made this for the first time today and I don't have a bundt pan so I used my Angel Food Cake Pan. It smelt like it was burning, so I had to take it out after one hour and scrape off some of the edges. Looks ok. Just hope inside is done and ok and taste good. I stuck butter knife into a couple places and it came out clean, so I an hoping.  I tasted the glaze & it was really tasty.

Warm, wonderful and reminiscent of autumn days gone by! I substituted half the white sugar for dark brown, doubled the cinnamon and omitted walnuts. Everyone, especially my 84-year-old father-in-law, raved! Will DEFINITELY be making again (and again) this fall!

I didn't change a thing and it was AMAZING! Made this for an impromptu dinner party and everyone loved it. By the way, it was just as tasty the next morning for breakfast :)

Made this for the big Christmas party last night.  Huge hit!  Really delicious... and actually, even BETTER this morning for breakfast!  The caramel drizzle is great also--in fact, I've now put the caramel sauce recipe in my separate "sauces" recipe file to make it in the future with other baked goods.  Even so, I think the next time I make the bundt cake I'm going to melt caramel candies and drizzle that caramel sauce over the cake--just to experiment.  
By the way, I didn't have Granny Smith apples on hand so I used what I had--Golden Delicious.  They were a bit small so I used three instead of two.  While cutting them up I added the diced apple pieces to a bowl of cold water to which I had added lemon juice.  (I did this for two reasons: one, to keep the apple pieces from turning brown, and two, to help make them a little tart to more closely resemble the taste of Granny Smith apples.) I kept them cold and covered in the fridge until it was time to fold them into the cake batter with the chopped walnuts.  This cake recipe is a holiday keeper!

The sauce is good, but the flavor of the cake is just alright...that is a lot of oil, so I used applesauce...not sure if that changed the flavor of the cake that much.

I went with some of the suggestions like using applesauce for a part of the oil and dividing up the white and brown sugar. Absolutely delicious!

This cake turned out beautiful, and everyone liked it. The glaze was nice and thick, after cooling for a minute or so and slowly spooning it on. For me though, the cake had way too much oil, and I even cut it to 1 cup. I could taste the oil in the finished cake and on my tongue afterwards. The glaze is amazing though, and no one else mentioned tasting the oil. This is a recipe that is a good base for me to try to tweak.

So good!  I prepared this for my In-laws anniversary party and it got rave reviews.  I did the suggestions by a couple other reviewers and used the applesauce in place of some of the oil and baked at 325 for 70 minutes.

This recipe was really good.  I did use half brown and half white sugar and doubled the cinnamon per the other reviews.  The cake is so moist and has great taste, I just wish the apples didn't get lost in the taste.  I used Jonathan apples thinking that you would be able to taste them more, but they didn't really stand out.  This was a really good spice cake though!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a great dessert - but I found it lacked flavour on the first day. This is definitely a cake that tastes better on the second day. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and although I started applying the glaze when the cake was warm (per the instructions), it simply melted into the cake, so I waited until the cake was cool to apply the rest of the glaze so that it could actually be seen. I served the cake along with some cinnamon whipped cream.

So good!  I used 1 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  The glaze was really runny, next time I might let it sit and cool a little before drizzling it on the cake.  However, the cake soaked up the glaze and it tasted great.  Definately a keeper!

This review is for the glaze only.  I was looking for a glaze to pour over a pumpkin spice cake so I gave this a try.  Delicious!!!  Will try the cake another time.

Very good! Absolutely delicious. Brown sugar topping is delicious. Only complaint is with baking time. I baked mine for just under and hour, and even then I think I could have taken it out a couple minutes earlier. Keep an eye on it while baking to determine how long it should be in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 changes, I used a loaf pan and omitted the walnuts adding more apples. It turned out great! Everyone loved it and it was very moist. The caramel glaze is delicious and MAKES the cake.

Fantastic recipe!!  I substituted whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the flour.  It was moist and delicious.  Definately put a pan under the cake to catch any drips from the glaze.  You will not want to waste a drop, so just spoon it back onto the cake!

This cake has 'way too much oil in it for my taste, and I tried reducing the 1.5C of oil with 1C applesauce, and 1/2C oil, and it just wasn't all that good.  I suppose if you put 1C oil with 1/2C applesauce, it would make it richer, and I might have enjoyed it more, but the extra calories just aren't worth it.  I think I will  try another apple cake next time.

I usually rely greatly on reviews. I think this "cake" was a big miss. I would call it more like a dry bread. The cake is so dry and flavorless. I didn't alter the recipe at all but it needs more spice and moistness. The caramel topping needs more flavor too. I also think I would chop the apples into super small dice. YUCK

Awesome, awesome, awesome. Used 3 small granny smith apples and doubled the brown sugar in the frosting (which I spread all over the warm cake, letting it absorb - ended up looking like a honey bun! Mmmm).

I have made this cake three times in the last five days!  It is awesome!  I made the suggested modifications (1c brown sugar and 1c white sugar, 1/2c applesauce and 1c vegetable oil, and double the cinnamon).  My husband and our five children can't get enough of this cake!  Wonderful recipe!
*Note*--I tried it with the correct amount of sugar because I ran out of brown sugar, and we liked it a lot better that way!

Gave this recipe a shot, and it worked out WONDERFULLY! I reduced the cook time to 70 minutes, and doubled the cinnamon. Dough is very thick, which concerned me, but it turns out perfect. Before serving, warm a slice in the toaster oven and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Wow!  I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit.  The perfect fall recipe.  I would mention that I wouldn't consider it a pound cake, but a bundt cake.  I added more cinnamon as mentioned by other reviewers and baked at 350 for 70 min.  The outer crust was a little hard so next time, I would bake at 325.  Also, I did not glaze the entire cake.  I made the glaze and took it along to my dinner, reheated it in the microwave and poured it over each slice right before serving.  The glaze is INCREDIBLE and really "made the cake".  By glazing each piece, you were able to get all of the flavor!  Try it!

I made it as a pound cake first,  then as oversized (think Costco) muffins.  Very easy recipe and very delicious.  It'll stay in my recipe box for years to come.

Delicious...everyone loved it. I also cooked 70 minutes at 325 degrees, and doubled cinnamon. Let the glaze cool a bit and thicken before spooning or pouring it. I topped with chopped pecans, which looked nice.

Most awesome ever. I'm an old Vermonter looking for something like this for awhile now. I did not make the topping because we feel it would be too sweet. I also split the nuts between walnuts ,  roasted sunflower,and pumpkin seeds. Apples and pears 50/50. I bet a scouche of bourbon did not hut it either! as As Mr Welk used to say Wunnerful, Wunnerful, Wunnerful.

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert. Friends and family raved about it. I used some of the suggested changes; 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar, reduced the oil to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce, and I baked it at 325 for 70 minutes. It was wonderful and I'll definitely make it again.

I made  the cake twice, for thanksgiving. On One I added chest nuts and on the second some cranberry. Didn't get a chance to get a picture.  But it came out awesome.  The  only thing, I had to add like 1/4 of milk. Batter to thick.

For those complaining about the amount of oil, you can do what I did and replace the oil with cinnamon applesauce! Same amount. It came out perfect! Loved it!!! Easy to make!

I was looking for a recipe to make in my mini harvest bundt pans and this was perfect! The only change I made was reduced the sugar to 1 & 1/2 cups because I don’t like things super sweet. With the caramel glaze this was just the right amount for me. It turned out a bit crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I’m adding it to my harvest recipe collection!

Definitely needs less oil. I'd probably add more apples. The Carmel sauce was just heavenly.

I cut down the butter with applesauce, used 1 cup of regular sugar and brown sugar and floured the apples before adding to the dough. This recipe makes a huge cake and I thought it came out a little dry and more of the consistency of a bread cake.  We enjoyed it but it made way to much cake for 2 people to eat.

This cake is fantastic! I took this cake to work and it got compliments from everyone. I did make some changes based on another reviewer that worked out really well. I increased the cinnamon to 1 tspn, used half white and half brown sugar in the cake, and subbed 1/2 cup of the oil for apple sauce.

Took this cake to a church function.  It was gone in a minute.  I was asked to make it again.  Very attractive to the eye, and good on the pallet.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe.

I did not have a Bundt pan so just put it in a 9 x 13 and it tasted wonderful. My grand kids loved it. I would like to try to make it lower calorie and lower sugar if possible. I will make this again.

Made it almost as described however when I was about to make it, I realized I had no walnuts but had slivered almonds instead. My oven was preheated to 350 for the cake anyway so I popped the almonds in for 5 minutes to toast them, and used them instead of walnuts. The cake was excellent, moist and light and everyone loved it. Recipe is a keeper!

I didn't adjust the oil and didn't think it was too 'wet' at all.  I DID adjust the baking temp and time (I think my oven runs a little hot) to the suggested 325 degrees for 70 minutes. I added a bit of nutmeg, just because I love nutmeg. I thought the glaze was a bit too thin after making so beat it with a wooden spoon for a few minutes until it started to thicken. Turned out amazing!

The only changes I made was that I substituted 1 cup of pecan pieces for the walnuts as my husband does not like walnuts.  I also used 2 teaspoons of half and half cream instead of milk for the glaze.  It was so yummy that my dinner guests goobled it up.

Only one change. I was a little short of vanilla, so I used about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract. Doubt anyone would notice the difference. 

However, I have two questions: 1) my cake was a little difficult to get out of the pan. The recipe said to "grease the pan", which I did, but should I also have used flour? 2) I waited until the cake came out of the over to make the glaze, so it was still pretty warm and ran more than I expected. Should I have made it while the cake was baking to give it more time to cool before drizzling over the warm cake?

One of the most incredible apple bundt cakes I've ever made. All I can say, blown away. Now if I only can get my fiance to stop having it for dessert and breakfast I will get it to last longer than 24 hours. It has fall and early Christmas written all over it!

It was delicious but didn’t need 1 hour and 20 minutes in the oven. I baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes and it was a bit overdone. This recipe is a keeper.

I don't know if the baking directions are correct because an hour 20 was way too long! the cake was so dry that it had a crust on the top, and was stuck to the pan. I had to scoop it out with a spoon and then drizzle the caramel sauce over it in a pan. I don't know how it was, because I gave it away.  I would give it another try, but would not bake so long, and would grease AND flour the pan!

This is the same recipe I've used for years from my Grandmother.  It was always my favorite cake as a child.  I use Granny Smith Apples, and Pecans instead of Walnuts & the Glaze is meant to be poured over a hot cake, just as it comes out of the oven.  I cover the Bundt pan with foil after pouring over the Glaze, and leave it to sink deep into the cake- overnight. The cake always slides out easily.  It's Always Delicious and a hit wherever you serve it!

I made this with the recommended changes of 1C brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  Also decreased the time to 70 minutes which was spot on, if not slightly overcooked.  

The cake has a nice texture, maybe it could have used more apple, or maybe I chopped them too finely.  

As per other recommendation I placed the cake plate under the rack so it caught the extra glaze so there is glaze on the bottom as well as the top.

This cake is awesome. I used 1 c sugar, 1 c splenda and glaze was with brown sugar splenda. Other than these changes I made exactly as written. I let the glaze cool for about 10 minutes and it was a perfect glaze on the cake.  So delicious!!

This cake is definitely a winner!  Like many other reviewers, I too made some improvisational changes that just sounded right to me: 325 degrees for 70 mins was perfect; used 1/2 cup of walnuts; substituted 1 1/2 cups of veg. oil for 1 cup of walnut oil and 1/2 cup of fat free greek yogurt, used about 3 1/2 - 4 Honey Crisp apples, doubled the cinnamon, added vanilla to the glaze but only applied 3/4 of the amount to the cake and used 50% white sugar/50% light brown sugar.  Then did a light dusting of confectioners sugar on top for contrast.  Oh yeah...and add a little rum to that caramel glaze! (if you just want to add an added flavor dimension, add rum while cooking as it will cook out the alcohol.  If you want the little extra “kick” from the rum, add rum (to taste) after cooking and just prior to drizzling over cake.  :-)

It was alright.  I took the advice of others and use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1 cup oil, and I doubled the cinnamon.  Still lacked much flavor.  Even the glaze was somewhat bland and didn't bring the richness of flavor I was hoping for.

Made it twice - first time didn't chop apples small enough and it fell apart - tasted great just not pretty. Second time chopped both the apples and the nuts in my chopper - BEAUTIFUL and tasted super!  So much fun to watch friends enjoying it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Definitely a keeper.  I never made any changes. This cake stayed deliciously moist for nearly 2 weeks. I must admit cake does not normally last this long in my house usually a few days, but I  forgot that my sons were going away for a week.

Love this cake.  I did make a few changes.  Used sugar in the raw instead of regular sugar, decreased walnuts to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of craisens.  I also added 1 tbs rum to the glaze.  This is now my most requested dessert.

I did as others suggested and increased the cinnamon and added a pinch of nutmeg
I also needed to make a second batch of glaze as one wasn’t enough 
Thanks for the recipe, it’s a keeper

I made this to bring to a Thanksgiving gathering, and everyone loved it! Took a chance, as I never made it before! I followed some of the recommendations by the top reviewer. For the oil: used 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 1 cup of oil. Half white and half brown sugar. Used 1 tsp cinnamon. Baked at 325degF for 70 min. (It's been a while since I made this, but I believe that I took it out sooner.)  I left out the walnuts since I some people don't want them.  A reviewer suggested just topping the glaze with some, which is a good idea. Dani, thanks for the great recipe! UPDATE 11/28/19: At 325degF, this tested done a lot sooner, 55 min.

The family that was supposed to bring the apple pie for Thanksgiving couldn't make it so I saw this recipe and tried it.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, LOVED it.  I baked it the night before and made the glaze right before serving.
My changes per other reviews: applesauce in place of 1/2 cup of oil, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown, 1 tsp. cinnamon, toasted pecans (have a no-walnut eater), baked at 325 for 70 minutes and used dark brown sugar for glaze that I let sit for a bit before drizzling on.  I did have a little trouble getting it out of the pan but I had only greased it; next time I will flour it too.
I will be making for Christmas along with a gingerbread cake.

I substituted 1 cup brown sugar for 1 cup of the white sugar and I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil + 1/2 cup melted butter (everything's better with butter) and 1/2 cup applesauce for  the 1-1/2 cups oil.  I also increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon. 
Made this for our It's 4 U Mom meeting  at our church and everyone asked for the recipe.

Super easy and very delicious.   I cooked the caramel drizzle a little too long (more like candy than glaze), but will adjust next time.   Thinking about trying it as muffins,  too.

I made this for a Supper Club that we belong to. I took the advice of several previous reviewers and substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c of the oil.  The cake was great, and received rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe which is going into my file for future use.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband loved it.  The only thing I did differently was to use about 3 cups of apples only because that is what I had thawed out.  The caramel  sauce was so easy to make and tasted wonderful.

It fell out of pan out on the dish in a big blob. I cut the oil down and cooked 70 minutes as recommended. It tasted pretty good. I formed it into a volcano shape and put sauce on top. I called it an Apple Mountain cake. Not enough sauce to cover it. I’m not trying this one again.

What did I do wrong?  Used the exact recipe - no changes nor substitutions. It smelled heavenly!  It came out of the oven beautifully, but it wouldn’t come out of the bundt pan without a lot of coaxing. I Pam’d the pan - should I have “greased the pan” with shortening or something else?  Thoughts?

A delicious moist, rich cake with a delightful apple flavor and the crunch of nuts.  I always use pecans instead of walnuts and one additional apple, otherwise exactly as written.  The glaze adds a nice pop of sugary sweetness.  A favorite in our family.  Thank you, DaniBanani!

This is a great recipe for a gathering of 8-15 people.  The cake looks beautiful, much like the picture.  Many people said they liked it, but I noticed not everyone was able to finish a slice.  It is very rich so cut slim pieces so you don't throw much away.  The cake is better served warm so stick it in the microwave one slice at a time for 20 seconds.

This cake was a real hit with the family.  My only challenge was the length of time I cooked it because I used a springform pan as I didn't have a bundt pan. My oven is hard to gauge as it tends to overcook things.  Will have to try it again using the bundt pan and adjusting the time for my oven.

My family love this cake (it's a good thing, I would have eaten it all myself!) Unfortunately I can't eat nuts so I didn't put them in, but it was still delicious. I'll be making it again soon.

I made this cake today to get rid of some apples I had on hand. It is really moist and delicious. I substituted coconut oil I also added 2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter and 1 additional tablespoon of almond milk to the glaze, after I accidently added too much vanilla extract. It gave the glaze a rich, nutty taste. I will be making it again.

The only change I made was to cut back slightly on the oil as per other reviewer suggestions (I did not substitute anything for it; just cut back by about 1/4 cup). Also, I only had macadamia nuts so didn't put them IN the cake; just chopped 'em and sprinkled them on top of the glaze. Yum!

This is fantastic.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I used 1 cup of vegetable oil and then 1/2 cup apple juice.  I used  1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2  tsp of nutmeg.   Instead of vanilla, I buy a myriad of flavored extracts from OliveNation.com for baking, so  I used their apple extract.   I baked at 325 for about 55 mins.  This was really really good, a great alternative to banana bread.   This will be added to my staple recipes.

This cake was so easy to make.  And it turned out great.  One of my new favorites.  Everyone loved it.  I made it for a birthday party and not a crumb was left.  Was just by a friend to make it for her birthday, so will be remaking it tonight.  Maybe I'll make two! LOL

If you want a fast, easy, delicious, moist cake this is it for you.  You probably have almost all the ingredients at home right now.

I only had gala apples so I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups to compensate for the sweetness of the apples but other then that I followed the recipe as is.  This cake is easy to make and absolutely delicious.  It tastes even better the next day when it seems to settle more.  It is a keeper for anytime of the year.

A lovely and flexible recipe. It has become one of my favorites, especially with the suggested changes by other reviewers. Being a Southerner and fresh out of walnuts, too, I subbed pecan pieces this time. Then, for good measure and holiday spirit, I sloshed in just a bit of bourbon. Made the caramel sauce with heavy cream and a little coarse salt. OK, and maybe the wee-est splash of the bourbon.

I made changes to this recipe, didn't like the amount of oil in here so I only put in 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 1/2 cups like it said, and added approx 2- 2 1/2 cups vanilla yogurt , and I added 1 tsp baking powder. Taste was great. Served this to a bunch of ladies, and they all liked it.

This is  no pound cake.  It needs butter.  I followed a suggestion and substituted 1 cup applesauce for the oil.

It was overbaked at 350 degrees.

The carmel sauce was good & just enough for the bundt cake.

Made this 2 days ago. Brought it to work and work colleagues loved it. I didn't make many changes to the recipe but I toasted the walnuts beforehand and reduced the sugar a little. Turned out great. Moist and tasty!

Super delicious! My coworkers dispatched this in less than an hour at our carry in. Did I make some changes? Yes... I did.... (she said sheepishly after she gave the recipe 5 stars.) 1.5 cups of oil is too much oil. For anyone. So I replaced half with applesauce.  Also I added some cloves and nutmeg. But only because of personal preference. That having been said, it looks super impressive and makes the house smell like Christmas.

Amazing! Everyone loved this cake. The only changes I made were to bake for 80 minutes at 325, and I subbed brown sugar for one cup of the white sugar as some reviewers suggested. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for the first time today. Followed the ingredient and cooking adjustments of other reviewers - replaced 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce, doubled cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 325 for 70 minutes - and it came out beautifully. My husband, a crotchety critic by nature, loved it. And he is truly hard to please.  The glaze is everything, don't you dare use margarine!!!

I'll def make it again. However, my suggestion is tweak the baking time. I know ovens different, but I shortened the time by 7 min. Cake was delicious, but not as moist as I'd like it.

Terrific recipe!  I followed advice of many other reviewers and cut oil to one cup and used 1/2 cup pumpkin purée.  You could use pumpkin, applesauce or apple butter. I used full teaspoon of cinnamon. Everyone loved this cake and I'll make it again soon.

I made this cake for a dinner party in October, the perfect time for this apple cake. I made it exactly like the original and it came out perfect. Everyone loved it. It is so moist, does not need ice cream. I did microwave it for about 2 minutes on High before serving.  Grandmother’s knew how to make desserts!

Very similar to my my Mom's recipe but for few changes.  Follow recipe but for substitute small can of (drained crushed pineapple instead of oil. Use only 1/2 c of oil.  3/4 c of coconut and bake 325 for 1 hr.  No need for glaze unless you love all that sugar.  FORGET THAT APPLESAUCE!  USE pineapple

This tasted heavenly. I made it exactly as printed. Used light brown sugar since it didn't state which and it was delicious. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because as I was making it, I read that it stated to grease the bundt pan only. It didn't state to flour it as well. Well, even though I used a nonstick bundt pan and greased very well, my cake stuck and would not release at all. So in the end we had some very very delicious deconstructed apple cake that had to be scooped from the pan. Taste is still phenomenal so I will for sure make again but next time I will go with my gut and flour after greasing the pan. Thanks for a great cake recipe. Loved it!

This was great -- very moist and also very pretty to serve. Only change I made was to sub 1/3 of the oil with applesauce, as suggested by other reviewers. I will definitely make this again.

This cake is delicious and only gets better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly, only omitting the nuts, which sadly, no one else in my family likes.  The cake was moist on the inside with a deliciously crisp crust; the glaze was terrific.  It is an incredibly good dessert.

Loved this cake...unfortunately I only had 1 apple and it was a Honey Crisp..went ahead and made it anyway and it was fantastic! I highly recommend this recipe and next time I will make sure to have the required ingredients, but its good to know that minor substitutions will still make it taste good!

I agree this is absolutely delicious. I used 4 apples not Granny Smith just regular apples. I added a container 8 oz of Carmel dip in between 1/2 of batter. Added 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 t of nutmeg 1/2 ginger. Oh my gosh this is awesome I can eat the whole cake please try this is really worth cooking

This is the best cake I have ever eaten!!!   I will always make this cake during the holidays!!  Warning:  if you are not used to baking using a bundt pan, I would suggest you watch a You Tube tutorial on how to prepare the pan.  I used Baker's Joy and have a very detailed bundt pan and it came out perfectly.  Also, set the timer for 10 minutes (instead of 20) and then invert the cake out of the pan.  I had one totally fall apart from improper pan prep and/or possibly waiting too long to invert out of the pan.

Amazing! I followed other reviews and replaced 1/3 of the oil with old fashioned applesauce. Also left the nuts out of the batter, and mixed them into the glaze. Hands down best cake I've ever made!!  Very moist with great apple-y flavor!

This cake  was amazing!!!  I substituted half  cup of oil with applesauce .   I did add one more cup of Granny Smith apples and pecans instead of walnuts.  I also sprinkled the bottom of the pan with  cinnamon and sugar as well as the top of the cake before baking. The sauce is delicious!!! I also added  the sauce until a few hours I made the cake.   I only baked it for @ 65 minutes!

Love making this cake to celebrate fall!  Like others I used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of some of the oil and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  My bundt pan is very dark, so I ended up cooking mine 90 minutes at 325.  Also, I let the cake cool completely, and let the glaze cool off a bit before spooning on top. That kept more on the cake and less on the plate. And a sprinkle of chopped walnuts makes it pretty. Delicious!!

I followed the original instructions -1/2 a cup of sugar. I baked it according to the recipe. It was very dry. If I bake this again I will add apple sauce and bake it according to other reviewer's. But if you make the cake according to instructions I would skip this cake.

In a nutshell: Fantastic! In detail: first time I made this, I only had 2 5" bundt pans. I used the regular recipe (as is) and figured I'd split it, but for whatever reason I ended up getting it into one. I wish I could remember the cook time - but it was a huge hit!! Second time, I used the applesauce (1/2 cup) with 1 cup vinegar and an egg substitute by Red Mill. My MiL is allergic to eggs. I didn't feel like using the bundt pan so a lined a 9x13 with parchment (so lazy that night!) and baked for the same required time. I checked as it got closer but the same time worked perfectly. Another huge hit - maybe even better!! The caramel glaze is fantastic as well!

Love it! I use whatever apples I have in the house. Big hit with everyone who has eaten it! I add more cinnamon because we love cinnamon in our house.

I gave this 4 stars because the thought of 1 1/2 cups of oil  sounded too heavy. I made this, and substituted 1 cup of applesauce for a cup of the oil. I also increased the cinnamon (personal preference). I cut the apples into big chunks, next time I will toss them with a bit of cinnamon before putting them in the batter. Everyone loved it, and it was great for breakfast the next morning. I will definitely be making this again.

Quite good! I followed the recipe as written except for substituting homemade glazed pecans for the walnuts, since I didn't have any on hand.  I didn't invert it as is typical with a bundt because the top looked so beautiful after baking.  The glaze emphasized the gorgeous golden brown color.  This tastes like an apple coffee cake.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

The cake was great but the caramel glaze was not a glaze at all, it gets chewy like a piece of candy. Will make the cake again but with a different glaze recipe.

This is one of the best pound cakes I've had. This was a very popular desert for Thanksgiving meal, and it was still great for breakfast! Only thing I changed was that I used an angel cake pan, but it still turned out similar (just not too fancy of a shape), and delicious! I recommend this to anyone considering making this.

This cake was moist and delicious even the next day. I made it ahead of time for Thanksgiving dinner (taste-tested the crumbs from leveling the bottom the day I made it), and it tasted fresh when we ate it the next afternoon. I did make a couple changes. I opted for a cream cheese drizzle rather the caramel (just used my Cinnabon clone icing recipe) and added that just before serving. Also, the thought of all that oil made me queasy, so I used 1/2 cup canola oil and the rest was unsweetened applesauce. I also doubled the cinnamon just because I know my family loves it. I used a 9-inch Nordicware bundt pan (well greased and floured) and it slid out with no issues at all after baking at the specified temp and time.

I changed the oil out for butter. I shredded my apples instead of dicing them. After I shredded the apples, I sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on the apples before I added them to the cake mix. The caramel sauce was the easiest caramal sauce I have ever made.

Just made this cake in my new bundt tin! Really like the outer crust and the glaze. I followed the recipe but used slightly less oil. I think 1 1/4 cup oil is good. Used 3 apples. If I make this cake again I would cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I baked it for 75 mins at 325. Nice caramel flavour and it needs, in my opinion, tangy crisp apples that cuts through the sweetness (Or use less sugar). Important to fold in the flour and not overwork the batter as it gets too dense and chewy.

I made this recipe as written because it was my first attempt. Very easy and tasted fabulous. I don't think I will bother with changes from the base recipe but I would add more glaze, which gives this recipe its five star rating from me. It got rave reviews from all who were lucky enough to get a taste.  Sliced and given about 10 secs in the microwave, along with a little dab of whipped cream,  was pure autumn heaven.

The walnuts completely took over the flavor of the cake so I couldn't taste the apples. The consistency was good and the icing was delicious, but if I make it again I will either omit or cut down on the walnuts and add more apple. I cut back on the oil and used !/2 cup of applesauce as others suggested.

I have my 2nd one in the oven right now.  The first was delicious.  Everyone loved it!  The batter was so thick that I had to add an additional egg (it was like cookie dough) and I used 6 apples instead of 2 which made it very moist and sooo good.  I didn't make the caramel sauce for on top and don't think I will this time, either.  I don't need the extra calories and it is perfect without a sauce.  Also, no nuts were added.  We have a tree nut allergy in the family.  Very easy to make.

Cake turned out perfect! I didn't change anything. There was no hard crust and the cake wasn't overly moist. It is a pound cake and has the texture of a pound cake. The caramel glaze is awesome I out wax paper under the cake when I went to drizzle it that way I could scoop up what dripped off and put it back on the cake. It's a good fall dessert!! Will make again!!

I had every intention of following the recipe exactly.  However, I found I only had whole wheat flour on hand and didn't have enough time to go to the store to buy all purpose flour.  So I made this with the flour I had and then on the advice of other reviewers added more cinnamon and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown.  And baked at 325 for 70 minutes.  The cake was perfection and I will be making it again and again.  In fact, my six year old granddaughter loved it so much she has requested it for her birthday in a few months.  Brought to a cookout-no leftovers!  It was that good.

Delicious and moist. As other reviewers suggested, I used one cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. My cake was done in about 65 minutes.

Great recipe! I did modify to make it more healthier & taking all the advice from prev reviews. I used 1.5C apple sauce, 2C cubed apples, 1C brown 1C white sugar & 1 tsp cinnamon. Baked 325 for 70 mins. I mixed everything by hand too. Very dense cake & the glaze was perfect. Daughter loved it, thanks!

Delicious and so moist.  I did make changes other people suggested.   Baked at 325 for 70 minutes.  Used cinnamon applesauce for 1/3 of the oil.  doubled the cinnamon.  also, I just spooned sauce over individual pieces of cake, not over entire cake.  I had to travel with the cake and it was easier this way.

Served this to my family for dessert last night. They LOVED it. My mom, a very picky eater, said it was so good that she didn't want to swallow! I substituted raisins for the walnuts since my father can't eat them. Baked it at 325 for 70 minutes as suggested, but I think that might have been too long in my oven. Will try 60 minutes next time and will add an extra apple. I did not care for the caramel glaze but it was a huge hit with the fam. Thank you!

This was my husbands FAV dessert that I have ever made!  I have made it 3 TIMES this week for him to take to work.  I did follow suggestions for substituting 1/2 cup of oil with applesauce and baking it at 325 for 70 minutes.  The only suggestion that I have is to make the caramel glaze the day that you plan to serve because it gets gritty if made the night before or find a different recipe for caramel. I was told you can caramelize Eagle Brand Condensed Milk but haven't tried it.  All in all this was a FANTASTIC dessert! Thank you for sharing this!

Very good cake. I made as a sheet cake because that is the pan I had.  I also subbed 1/2 cup of oil for cinnamon applesauce, only added 1 3/4 cup of sugar and regarding the apples used 3 cups of red rome-not sure how much the 2 apples would have yielded.  I cooked on 325 and at 50 minutes it was done.  Brought into work today and everyone has said how much they love it!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was just wonderful. There is nothing I would change.  This will be going to my next potluck. It is so moist and the topping gives it that something special.

This cake was absolutely wonderful! I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I loved that the glaze hardened. I got many compliments on how good this cake was. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this cake was wonderful. The only change I purposely made was to bake at 325 for 70 minutes like the reviewers suggested. Now my accidental change, I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. Dont ask me how I did that. I was very worried by how much that was, but was pleasantly surprised! Was so good and was complimented on at Thanksgiving dinner. The second time i made this i used slightly less cinnamon so the apples can stand out a bit and somehow this was even more wonderful this time!!! YUMM!!!!!

Came out lookin' great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only downside to it was that the caramel glaze wasn't quite glaze-like.  Though, the additional flavor is tasty.  Overall, I really liked it and it's definitely something I'll be making again.  Maybe I'll learn how to make the glaze better, hehe.

Great recipe.  I brought the cake to Thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed it.  I did make a few changes ~ I used 1 cup of butter (rather than the oil) and a 1/3 cup of applesauce, doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg.  Next time I'll add a bit more cinnamon and more nutmeg.  But still really yummy!

I needed a glaze that didn't call for confectioner's sugar as I had run out.  I used this to top a pineapple cake and it was awesome!  Thank you!

This is pretty good. But like others I doubled the cinnamon after tasting the batter and realizing there wasn't enough. Other than that, and baking for 70 minutes at 325 (too many people suggesting that to ignore) I made this exactly as written. 

This needs more spice for my taste. Next time I will add allspice and cloves, like in my mother's apple cupcake recipe. 

The glaze is nice, but next time I will try a thicker caramel frosting.

This was a great recipe. The only thing I did different was melted caramel candy apple wraps over the top as the glaze just didn't have the look I wanted and I cooked it for 45 minutes as any longer and it would have burned. I took this to a cookout and it was a huge hit! Thanks for a great recipe!

I had baked my own cake and really wanted a caramel/nut topping. I used this topping and put pecans on top. The sauce is excellent!!!!!

All that oil left us tasting it in the cake afterwards. Might try substituting another fat...
