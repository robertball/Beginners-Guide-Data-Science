Made as stated. Liked except it was too dry. Made another batch of dressing, poured it on, mixed it up, let it sit in the frig most of the day , turned it a couple of times and had it for lunch the next day.  Very good!  Hubby had it for supper and he liked it too!  I will try it with garbanzos next time.

Great salad. I replaced the kidney beans with garbanzo. Personal preference.

I really liked this recipe. I subbed garbanzo beans instead of kidney beans.  I also used parsley instead of the spinach.  I like this recipe over a bed of lettuce.
