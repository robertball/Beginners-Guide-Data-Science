This is my kind of dinner! Easy and a unique, yummy flavor.  I thought it might be just a bbq sauce; but it is much more... It reminds me a little of Cuban food.
Some of the reviews said this was too sweet. My guess is it was their stewed tomatoes. This was not a real sweet dish with PLAIN DICED CANNED TOMATOES(instead of stewed)like I used. The idea of adding onion (esp. RED onion)sounds, to me, like it would be great; but I don't think mushrooms would work with this(and I love mushrooms). I think, a mix of sliced red onion,and red, yellow and green peppers (in the last 15 min.) steamed in the sauce, would compliment this sauce better; although the recipe is perfect just  AS IT IS.
I made with white rice and stir-fried, garlicky, fresh-cracked peppered green beans to make a meal. Although, any starch (noodles, rice etc.) and any green vegetable would be excellent with it. 
It made about a cup of sauce with flavorful chunks of tomato that we spooned over the chicken and rice. I made only four breasts, so I will double sauce for more servings. 'Gotta' have enough of the sauce to add to the rice!
Nancy, you said your husband hasn't gotten sick of this in 15 years... mine liked it a lot too. I have a feeling I will be making for the next 15 years, also. Thank you so much for sharing this one!

I would rate this even higher - these are ingredients you normally have on hand or they can easily be substituted.  I scaled it to three using the exact measurements provided when scaled down.  As a preference I used canned diced tomatoes, chicken broth (had it left over in the frig - water would have been fine), cayenne pepper since I didn't have hot pepper sauce.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and added a small onion sliced into rings - I would never leave that out now. Also had some leftover corn in the frig which I threw in at the end.  I pounded the breasts so they would be the same thickness, cooked them in 25 min. and they were incredibly moist.  Keep an eye on it when it simmers - I did have to add some more broth which was fine - it held its rich, spicy flavor and was great over the rice. Another keeper.  Thanks Nancy.

VERY GOOD! Per previous reviews, I used 1/4 cup red wine and 1/4 cup water and served all over white rice. Next time, I think I will add some chopped onions and fresh mushrooms.  In addition, I think I will cut the chili powder to 1 tsp instead of 2 (it overwhelmed the chicken).  Overall, still really good and my family agrees that it should be on the "regular" list!

Excellent!  My husband, a professional chef, said, "This one's a keeper!"  Only substitution I made was chicken broth instead of the water.

My family loved this recipe! 
I prepared this in my SLOWCOOKER browning the chicken first. (I did cut the chicken breasts in strips) I ran out of mustard powder so I used prepared mustard.It worked just as well. Because the reviews were so enthusiastic I decided to double the recipe to have lots of sauce. We had leftovers and tried this with both Whipped potatoes and small italian pasta. Yummy any which way you decide to eat it!

Next time I would like to add some green or red pepper and some onions.

This is a real keeper! Thanks

Why am I leaving a review on a recipe with so many reviews, when nobody will probably get to read it? Because it was THAT good! SO divine I couldn't stop eating it. Put it on top of a chicken broccoli flavored rice and paired it with a salad smothered in an imitation Olive Garden dressing. The tastes together in your mouth were unbelievable. Am definitely going to have this when Pastor and family come over next!

This recipe is one of our staples.  We have been making it for the last year.  We do make a couple changes though.  We reduce the amount of chicken breast halves from six to two.  Also, we cube the chicken.  When the sauce and chicken is complete we pour the sauce and chicken over fresh steamed white rice.  Yummy.  This will yield 2-4 servings.

I always add a chopped onion to this too for great flavor and texture. 11/1/06: This was EX-cellent!  I reduced the chili powder to 1/2 the amount, used 1/2 the amount of water so that I could do the other half in WHITE WINE; the wine really made the recipe as we've since used it and forgotten the wine, and could tell the difference. An extra splash of Frank's Red Hot Sauce doesn't hurt either! I love the combination of flavors and using all of the somewhat unusual-together ingredients to get there. The meat is tender, moist, and flavorful. SO good! A definite keeper. Thanks, Nancy!

A fine and easy recipe. I agree with other reviewers that red wine for water and white wine for vinegar worked well. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced red onions once the simmering starts. This is such a flexible recipe that "approximate" measurements of the ingredients works fine. I little more or less of anything just gives you a different taste the next time.

As TV Chef Micheal Smith says, "a recipe is just words on paper." I agree; that being said, I made this for two and changed the water into red wine (not as in the Bible), used Balsamic in place of the white vinegar, and added green onion and green chillies. Served over rice. 10 stars

This was good but not great.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I'll make it again because it's so easy and will cut back on the chile powder.  This tasted a little too much like chili.  There wasn't much sauce either so if you're making 6 breasts, I'd definitely double the sauce ingredients.

Nice easy recipe with great flavours but way too much salt. Id cut out the entire 2 teaspoons from the sauce as most of the time salt is already present from the soy, stewed tomatoes and the flour rub.

Fantastic! This recipe's a keeper! Easy enough for a family meal and special enough for dinner parties. It is so delicious with rice, salad and crusty bread. I did take the suggestion of using chicken broth (using 3/4 C.) instead of water. Also, as per the request of my husband, I flattened the chicken breasts out slightly prior to cooking.

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious!  I made and took it to a dinner party and it was a hit.  Reading others reviews, here is a synopsis of slight changes to the recipes that turned out great:

-1/4 cup of red wine and 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup of water
-double the entire sauce recipe to ensure plenty of this delicious sauce
-adjust hot pepper sauce and chili powder according to your own spice threshold
-I added diced onions with about 15 minutes to go
-I browned the chicken and then cut into bite-size pieces for when I threw it in the sauce mixture
-diced tomatoes instead of stewed
-served over brown rice

This recipes is very easy and super cheap if you already have all the spices!

Phenomenal! I would give it 10 stars if I could!  I changed very little, mostly to use my pantry items: I used 4 chicken thighs, large can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup vermouth for the water, and omitted the vinegar. I only adjusted the Worcestershire to 3 Tbsp to accommodate the larger can of tomatoes. The other spices & sugar were measured as specified.

I added step 1.5: saute about 1/2 cup onions and 1/2 cup peppers in the chicken drippings, and toss in the garlic when the onions & peppers are transparent. Deglaze (wash down) the pan with the vermouth, stirring and boiling for a few minutes to incorporate any brown bits. Continue to step 2!

I made this almost as directed except for a few changes.  I skipped flouring the chicken (personal preference) and browned chicken breasts in butter and put them in a shallow roasting pan.  Then I mixed the remaining ingredients in a bowl and poured that over the chicken breasts.  I baked it uncovered at 350 degrees for 50 minutes and served with white rice.  My husband and I both thought the combo was different and extremely good tasting.  Even the leftovers were fantastic!

I got 4 thumbs up on this one!  My hubby REALLY liked this dish.  My kids had two servings each.  I made this with chicken tenders as we are having really bad weather here in the big TX so all the chicken breast were sold out.  They were just as good and it did not take near as long to cook.  I served this with rice and steamed broc. I will make sure I add this to my often menu per hubbys request. Thanks for such an easy and flavorful recipe!

Excellent way to make juicy, tender chicken.  I didn't dredge the chicken in flour, I just seasoned with salt and fresh cracked black pepper, then browned in a little olive oil.  I took them out and sauteed half a white onion and about a teaspoon of minced garlic out of a jar with a little bit more olive oil.  I then followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few red pepper flakes and some mushrooms.  I served with a salad, steamed sweet potato, broccoli and yellow squash.  Great, healthy meal!  And I have enough for dinner tomorrow!

This was AMAZING! I had gotten this in an email while my daughter was at the dentist. I knew I had to stop at the store for a few things, including chicken breast. After reading this recipe and the reviews I decided this would be our dinner. So glad I made the decision to make it! I made it exactly as written except with less chicken. Great served with rice and a salad on the side! Mmm....

I used 14 of the salt called for, only 1 12 tsp of brown sugar and only 1 tsp chili powder.  When mixing the flour, I added 14 tsp each of paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  These changes made my daughter wish we could give it seven stars out of five!!  We also fought over the left overs.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I believe this was the first recipe I tried from all recipes years ago.  It is one of our favorites.  Very flavorful and not lots of fat. (Although don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of fat!)  We double the sauce it's so good and serve with rice and broccoli. Thank you Nancy!

Fabulous!  As per other reviews, I used diced tomatoes, and wine instead of water.  I also doubled the sauce amount.  Can't imagaine having enough of this relatively heathly reicped with out it. I have 5 kids, and everyone said how great this was.  I served over rice, but know it would work well with spaghetti.   Just to make it a tad healthier, I used Olive oil.  After making this, I think the next time I will  not dredge the chicken in flour.  I made this in my electric skillet which is made with teflon so I even used less oil.  This is a great recipe and where it is great the way it is, you can make your own little personnal adjustments and still get something great. Perfect with just a salad and the rice/pasta.   It's easy too.  Thanks so much Nancy.

This was OK but it just wasn't amazing. The chicken was ok on the outside but really dry inside. My hubby really liked it though. I followed the recipe as is except I substituted Worcestershire sauce with soy sauce and celery seed with celery salt. served it over rice or a choice of thin spaghetti noodles (which I liked better) Thanks for the recipe may try it again

I gave a 5 because it tasted good and I was able to use ingredients on hand.  I replaced the water with chicken broth as I saw in one of the reviews and doubled the sauce to saturate the rice I made with it. Thanks!

Per some of the other reviews, I threw in some red onion with the melted butter and some red wine with the water.  But I accidentally put in Cheyenne pepper instead of chili powder (I was thinking 2 teaspoons of red pepper was a lot)…even with my faux pas it had great flavor although it practically burned my lips off. My brother-in-law (he likes the spicy stuff) LOVED it and took home all the leftovers. I can't wait to try it without all the heat!!

This chicken was very flavorful.  The only thing I changed was I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Will definitely make again.

Used Rotel diced tomatoes for an extra kick.  Loved it and will definitely make again!

I made this tonight for my husband and two small children.  I served it with rice and brocolli.  My kids didn't care for it but my husband and I loved it.  Here are some changes I made;  I used Italian stewed tomatoes, chicken broth instead of water, 1 teaspoon of brown sugar (too sweet otherwise), less salt in the sauce because I used celery salt instead of seed and after putting the chicken back in the pan I added enough water to cover the meat before simmering.  The sauce on the rice was amazing.  Since my kids aren't crazy about it I might even add a little more of the hot pepper sauce next time to give it more kick but really it was great this way.  My husband doesn't want me to tinker with it anymore than I have.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy.  It's a keeper for us.

This was very good. Served over egg noodles with garlic toast.  Made servings for 4 but still doubled the sauce. Very yummy.  We like LOTS of flavor so just keep adding seasonings until I got it where we loved it. Used about 1/4 BOTTLE of hot sauce - YUM!

Wonderful! I made this exactly as written (right down to the crusty French bread on the side) and the flavour was AMAZING! My husband said it's his new favourite meal. Thank you, Nancy!

I give this a five star rating.  A simple recipe that can be the foundation for so many variations.  Right away, I sauteed an onion in the chicken pan.  Instead of water, I used vermooth which is always a good liquid with chicken.  I also had some summer squash that I threw in the pan.  Next time I might add some green pepper.  I see someone add soy sauce and that might be another twist.  My only criticism is that I thought is was a little too sweet for my taste (kids would love it).  I am going to try reducing the brown sugar a little to increase the tang factor.   My dish turned out more beautiful than the photo.  I would not hesitate serving to guests as it is easy, letting you prepare the rest of the dinner while the chicken bubbles.

I really liked it; it is very good.  I cut the recipe in half for two people.  I didn't have any celery seed so instead of using 1/2 teaspoon salt and a 1/4 teaspoon celery seed, I used 1/2 teaspoon celery salt.  Also because I love tomatoes, I used one full 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes with the liquid in lieu of the 1/2 can and 1/2 cup of water.  I wish I had more sauce though so maybe I'll add water or chicken stock next time.  My husband LOVED it and that is quite a feat considering we have opposite tastes.  That's why I'm giving it five stars.  We'll definitely make again.  Way to go!

This was surprisingly fantastic! I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used diced, I don't have celery seed, and I upped the garlic to 3 cloves, but it was SO yummy! The chicken was done just right, my kids ate it up, as did my husband!  I had to add 1/4 cup of water, because when I put the tomatoes in the pan when it was very hot, and boiled off a lot of liquid. Will be adding this to my regular recipe list! :D

Really great taste to this sauce...I made double because I only had a big can of diced tomatoes, and we'll use the extra sauce on rice, potatoes, even as a pasta sauce. Made the recipe as is, but added white wine instead of half of the water; delicious!

I must offer a dissenting opinion on this one.  Brown sugar and worcestershire dominated all other flavors.  Pierre won't be invited back for dinner at our house.

I have to say that this is the first recipe that I am really disappointed with. After the rave reviews...the whole family said don't make it again! After all the prep...(I pounded the breasts for even cooking) the breading, the frying and then the cooking, I should have made a Parmesan or something. The taste of chili powder was overwhelming and would have been better suited to a chili type meal. Sorry, but this wasn't our cup of tea!

I want to meet you Nancy!  I have read this recipe over & over again and was hesitant about chicken and tomatoes. I finally made this the other day and wow, we were so impressed.  My husband is in love with this dish; I think it's his new favorite.  Thanks a million for sharing this recipe!  :-)

My husband and I loved this recipe. I substituted 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes with liquid, didn't add the water and used, based on other reviews, 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. The flavor was awesome. I served it over wild rice as that is the rice my husband really likes.

This was simple and tasty and I will definitely make it again.  I had french bread and salad with this, but I would definitely put it over white rice or noodles next time.  I only used 1 tsp of chili powder since I was worried it might overpower the other flavors.  I'm glad I did, but I also enjoyed the kick from the Tapatio I used as the hot sauce.

This was pretty tasty.  Spicy, but just the right level for us. Here's another way to make this that worked for me: Put all the ingredients in a bag and let it marinate for a few hours. Make a dish of rice and put the chicken on top.  Put a tablespoon of flour in the bag and shake it all up.  Then pour the marinade on top of the chicken and bake in the oven for half an hour.  It solves the juice problem while flavoring the rice.

This is quite good and it came together simply and quickly; two things high on my criteria during the work week.  However the chili powder was quite strong and almost overpowered the other ingredients coming first and foremost as the front runner of flavor.   Even with the strength of the chili, the other flavors did come through subtly and with less chili next time, and yes there will be a next time, the ingredients would marry better.  Sometimes, as my grandma used to say, less is more.....  Thank you Nancy for sharing!

Good recipe.  My picky triplet daughters liked it and my husband LOVED it! I recommend some of the tips in the highest rated review.  The red onion is a must and I added green pepper and corn mid way through the simmering and it was awesome.  My husband said it looked like a Santa Fe dish. My favorite part is that all the ingredients are ones everyone should have.

I loved this recipe! since i only needed to make 2 chicken breasts i had to scale back a bit, but it tasted soooo good. I did not have celery seed so i didn't add it and i used canned diced tomatoes with some liquid. I also made shell pasta with this. I took the chicken out of the pan and added some of the pastas water to thin a little and added the pasta to the sauce and served it with the chicken. Delicious!

Wow, this was a great dish.  
It is so flavourful and the acid from the tomatoes help to keep the chicken very moist and tender.
The couple of substitutions I made were simply because of a few things that were missing from my pantry.
I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, red wine vinegar instead of white, and 1/4 tsp celery salt instead of celery seed. (reduced the remaining salt)
My husband loved it.  I served it with a simple whole wheat pasta with sauteed veggies and the extra sauce from the chicken was delicious on the pasta as well.
This one is staying in my recipe stash for sure.

I've been trying to eat healthier, so I've been eating a lot of chicken breasts -- and I am not usually a fan of chicken breasts.  This recipe, however, changed my mind.  It's very flavorful, and my chicken was still very moist.  My substitutions (only because that's what I had on hand are) - Chicken broth instead of water, Diced tomates & chiles instead of stewed tomatoes, Steak sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce, Ground Corriander insated of celery seed.  Also I added chopped red onions, red bell pepper, and orange bell pepper.

Now I see what all the rave reviews are about; this is fantastic! I had chicken thawed but my cupboards were a bit bare so I searched for a recipe that required common ingredients that I have on hand and this was it. What a surprise; sounds simple but the flavour has depth. We had with pasta but this sauce will be good on rice or potato as well. This is going into the rotation for sure. I would even serve this to guests; it is restaurant quality. Thanks for sharing!

Wow, delish! I only substituted 1/4 cup of red wine/1/4 water for the 1/2 cup water, and added in some chopped onions and green bell pepper. Served on top of basmati rice. My husband, a somewhat picky eater, loved it!

Pretty good.  Taste like watered down barbeque chicken.  Troy loves this and request it pretty often.  Usually add 1/2 diced onion.  Sometimes I make with pork, but simmer for only 30 minutes then.  Oh and double the sauce.  Pretty much always serve with brown rice with sauce spooned over top.  Only thing is it's not as good leftover.

This is a really good recipe with one slight change.  I prefer to cut up the chicken breast instead of them whole.  Otherwise, the breast are pretty flavorless even though the sauce is awesome.  I serve it over noodles.  This is really easy to make and very flavorful.

I actually created an account to warn people on this recipe.  I have loved all chicken recipes I've tried on here so far that have used tomatoes as the base sauce.  I'm always on the look out for a healthy and flavorful dish so I though this would be perfect. Wrong. This tasted like something that should be served at a bbq on a bun...I took the reviewers advise and added onions.  This actually made it worse.  The bbq taste does not mix well with rice either.

This is the first time I'm writing a review here and it's purely because this recipe is amazing. I added red wine as suggested by previous reviews and served over basil white rice and it came out great. This will remain in my recipe box for quick impressive dinners.

This was absolutely fabulous!!!!! My whole family loved it. I cut the breasts down the middle to make them thinner, more like cutlets, and doubled the sauce ingredients to make it saucier. I also used petite diced tomatoes because thats all I had.I cant tell you enough how delicious this is. Thank you Nancy for an awesome recipe!!

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It's super easy to make and delicious. I make it once every 1-2 weeks. It goes great served over linguine, with the chicken cut into pieces before breading/browning. I just use a large ziploc bag and toss the pieces in there before browning. I substitute red wine vinegar in the sauce, but I follow the rest completely. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

My family all ate this and found it quite tasty, but beware!  My professional soldier said, "this tastes like country captain chicken."  Country Captain Chicken is a MRE (Meal Ready to Eat) the bagged meals the military uses, like sea rations!  Needless to say I will not be making this again, too bad too, but I just can take the comparison, but congrats to the MRE makers for a tasty meal!

This is a good recipe... my husband and daughter really loved it.  I can't say I "loved" it but I did like it a lot and, if you're contemplating making it, I'd say go for it.  I made suggested changes... I added a can of stewed tomatoes for more juice, and I sub'd red wine for water.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  The overall taste is almost like a BBQ-style sauce... it's definitely not an Italian dish.  DEFINITELY needs the bread for sopping.  I give 5 stars to things that I just LOVE LOVE LOVE so i'll give this recipe 4 stars.  Wish I could give 4 and a half.  EDIT:  I just ate the leftovers and boy, were they good!  I think my only problem w/this meal is that I expected something more Italian-ish tasting, mainly because of the picture and because everyone is serving it w/pasta.  Personally (and I saw at least one other reviewer felt the same way) I think this would be better with mashed potatoes and that's what i'll be making it with next time.  Changing my 4 stars to 5.
ANOTHER EDIT:  I made this again, extra can of tomatoes only thing changed, served w/mashed potatoes and it ROCKED.  YUM.

This was very good, made it as directed but left out the salt and added a hefty dose of black pepper. Yummy, served it with brown rice (finally got my family to eat it and now it's 'normal') and steamed broccoli. Thanks Nancy!

My husband and I thought this dish was very good.  I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces before flouring and I served it over angel hair pasta because of what I read from previous reviews, and served the leftovers the next day over rice.  The dish was tastier the next day and I liked it better over the rice.  The chicken was nice and tender!  Would make again.  Easy to prepare!

Very, very, very tasty. I took some suggestions and substituted white wine for the water. I also found it easier to cube the chicken. I did not have celery seed or mustard powder on hand but it still was very tasty. Next time, I may use more sauce.

Very good recipe - wonderful flavor.  Served this two nights in a row - first with pasta and then with rice.  Rice much, much better.  Did reduce brown sugar to 1 tbl., used balsamic vinegar, used sherry since I had no other, also used mushrooms and onions.  Will make again.

This was delicious and different!  Very spicy - nice.  A long list of ingredients but a snap to make, and had most of the necessaries around the house.  Was afraid to feed it to my 14 month old, but my husband and I really enjoyed it.  Didn't change a thing about the recipie, and did serve it over white rice, as suggested by others.  Thank you.

It's patently wrong to blast a recipe because it didn't meet your expectations.  I wasn't sure I wanted to try it based on the flavors I know I prefer.  I watched the video twice, looked at the recipe three times looked at the negative reviews and then went for it!   

I know what I like and what I can tolerate and I'll make those adjustments in the future.  I always try the recipe as produced first because you need a starting point before adding or taking ingredients away.  As it stands I'd make this one again with no modifications.  

This is good and hearty, even for chicken - perfect for a rainy fall afternoon.  I'm not sure it would be as good to me on a hot summer day.   It does remind me a bit of bar-b-que, but not the type I'd eat on a bun.  I pulled the chicken out and let the sauce thicken up on it's own with the lid off.  

Served it up with some mashed potatoes and green beans and everyone was happy.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, instead of breasts,  and I used diced tomatoes, and added fresh chopped celery and onions and green pepper, to make my own stewed tomatoes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and will be making it many more times.

Served with Sarah's Rice Pilaf, Fabulous French Loaves, and broccoli. Very nice rustic taste. As the submitter advised, I did serve with French Bread. Unfotunately, we didn't have enough sauce for dipping. Next time, I would double the sauce. Last of all, I did use the remaining flour to thicken the sauce after it cooked.

Yum! Great recipe, lots of flavor.  The only thing I substituted was using the homemade chili powder mix from allrecipes and used caned diced tomatoes.
Also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.

Loved it! I have made similar recipes to this and this one was the best.  I added red onion and made it in the crockpot and added the flour shortly before serving.  We had it over rice cooked with half water half chicken broth.  Awesome!

Supreme it is! Thank you so much for sharing. I ONLY USED 2 CHICKEN BREAST, BUT THE FULL SCALE SAUCE PART as mentioned by another reviewer. I wanted a lot a sauce and there is only two of us). This is perfect as is and fun to tweak to one's own taste. In lieu of celery seed, I added sliced celery along with a chopped shallot when cooking the chicken in the first phase. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I added 1/4 tsp of sugar along with the 1/8+ tsp of the pepper sauce.. (idea got from internet search). Then I cut the chili powder in half. Not the biggest fan. Half was fine. I also cut the chicken into long strips before cooking. Served over noodles. Chicken was SOOO MOIST! Again, Thank you angelfadedblue!!! (Fairly Simple too!)

WOW - this is good! Reading a few others I made a few adjustments. Some used red wine instead of water, didn’t have red – used white. What I had on hand, used a little fresh ground caraway instead of celery seed (out of celery seed). I had some ground chipotle pepper on hand – used 1 teaspoon of the chipotle and 1 teaspoon regular chili powder (instead of 2 chili). Some added red, yellow and green sweet pepper toward last 15 minutes, along with onions – I did that, ,but used frozen had on hand. Taste testing - recognized why another person put a little frozen corn in theirs -corn adds a soft balance. We served this sauce over rice, the chicken was juicy and oh so tender. The ‘Nobody's Strawberry Watermelon Shakedown’ smoothie I made – a perfect contrast to the meal. My husband ate quite heavily. I also did the salad and French bread - Nancy – thanks – what a WOW meal!

I made this recipe with vegetarian chicken breasts from President's Choice Blue Menu. It worked great and was surprisingly good! I didn't really change anything except shorter cooking time because there's no need to worry about undercooking soy based foods.

I will definitely make tthis again. As an FYI, I didn't have all of the ingredients - Rotel instead of stewed so didn't use the hot sauce. I also hate celery seed, never have mustard powder, etc., so made some substitutions. All in all, pretty much the same. It cooked a little longer than needed because I decided in the last 10 min to throw together biscuits and the sauce got "jammy." What a happy mistake! I saved the leftover jam and used it today on my turkey burger sandwich - I'll use this recipe to make more jam. I've also decided it would be good with about any meat AND would probably work out really well in a crock-pot. So versatile - no way you can't add this to your cooking repetoire.

Addn'l, I made this for my parents and my Mom, who doesn't like anything outside the box ("why can't you just fry chicken like I do?") really enjoyed this.

I wish we could give 1/2 stars - I don't like giving anything 5 stars - thus, the 4 star rating and 5 star ranting!

Delicious BBQ sauce taste. Simmered it for 40 minutes, and the chicken came out juicy. Will definitely make again.

This was so delicious! The flavors were great, the chicken breasts very tender. I did use olive oil instead of butter, but changed nothing else. Definitely a keeper!

This is excellent and so easy! I used chicken broth instead of water, and a can of diced tomatoes (just because I had some to use up) but this recipe is perfect as is, and great because you usually have all the ingredients in the pantry. I served it on top of mashed potatoes and a side of fresh steamed green beans, yum! The sauce is sooo good! Thanxs for sharing!

My family LOVED this recipe. No changes made, no additions, no substitutes. Sounded a little odd when I first looked at the ingredients, but the kids siad they loved the sweet and tangy taste of the sauce.

Very good. Only suggestion- I always use half butter/half olive oil when sauteeing. Let's you saute at high temperature.

Great recipe, followed exactly.  We served with a salad a bread, but rice would be good so that the sauce could be used over it.  We did 2 chicken breasts and ended up with a lot of liquid left over.

This dish is good ... was expecting it to be better though. Followed the recipe exactly as it was written. However, I have no stewed tomatoes in my cupboard and have crushed tomatoes, so I used that instead. Followed the other reviewer's suggestion, added chicken broth and onion too. I halved the chili powder as well. Next time I cook this I will replace the chicken broth with red wine as others suggested. Then will follow the original recipe of 2 teaspoons chili powder. Thank you Nancy! =)

This recipe was very good! However, I didnt follow
all the directions. I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salt before placing it in the seasoned flour. Also I put the can of stewed tomatoes in my mini chopper which made a very nice sauce. After mixing in all the ingredients, make sure it has enough salt because I had to add more. I also added chopped onion.

Yum! I used other reviewers suggestions to use diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also used a combination of white and red wine instead of the water.

Delicious dish, and very easy. The combination of ingredients in the sauce may seem a bit eclectic, but it makes for a rich and flavorful result. Definitely use stewed tomatoes for best results.

this was really good!  even my picky two year old loved it.  I will definately make this again.  I used chicken broth instead of water after reading the other reviews.  Other than that the only thing I changed was that I used celery salt instead of celery seed because that's all I had.  I left out the extra 1 tsp. of salt and I cut the chili powder down to 1 teaspoon as other reviewers suggested.

This was delicious!  Family loved it.  I did not have celery seed or hot pepper sauce on hand so left those out.  Still fantastic.  Only other change was taking others advice and subbing chicken broth for the water.  Mine came out a wee bit chewy but I think it overcooked.  I cooked for 35 minutes but will check for doneness at 25-30 minutes next time.  Definitely going into my dinner rotation.

I rarely give a negative review, but we, my family and I, really didn't like this.  I would imagine this combination of ingredients is an acquired taste and since I never use celery seed with mustard powder, we just didn't enjoy this combination at all.  Would not make it again.  Sorry

Great sauce.  I used diced fire roasted tomatoes with garlic.  I like it a little more spicy so next time I will double the hot sauce. My kids loved it.

Although I rarely cook chicken (or any meat, for that matter), I really loved this recipe! 

We didn't think the sauce was too sweet, however I substituted diced tomatoes for the stewed (stewed generally have sugar added), and I cut down on the brown sugar (to about 1 tsp). I didn't have any hot pepper sauce or celery seed, so I just skipped those - added a bit of cayenne pepper instead (maybe 1/4 tsp or so). Instead of water I used some vegetable broth I had in the fridge - about 3/4 c. 

Flavor was quite good, there was enough sauce for eating over some brown rice. A salad and green vegetable - green beans, perhaps, would be great with this.

This was a good lesson on checking my cupboards before starting a dish.  But despite having to substitute white sugar with a little mollasses for the brown sugar, not having worcestershire sauce or mustard powder and having bone in chicken, this was fabulous.  I want to try it again, true to the recipe and I am sure it will be just as good, if not better.  We served it with penne pasta and the zucchini provencal recipe from this site.

Easy and delicious. While I wanted to try the wine substitute, I didn't since we have three young children. The flavor was still rich with a nice balance of acid. I especially enjoyed it and next time will at least double the amount of sauces. We served over white rice.

UPDATE: The second time I made this, I only used two chicken breasts, but sliced them into thirds so they were thin. I then dredged them in the flour mixture, dipped them in egg, and finished them off with Panko breadcrumbs.  This made the chicken quick to cook and so crispy! I left the sauce at the original amount, but next time I'm going to double it. I cooked the sauce in one pan, chicken in another, and then just added the chicken with a quick stir to coat and served. That way the breading didn't get soggy. Huge hit! ORIGINAL:  This was a huge surprise for me. It has been sitting in my recipe box for a year, and I finally decided to try it. I was expecting an Italian-type dish, but was pleasantly surprised by the spicy Cuban undertones. My one year old couldn't get enough of this. I did use diced instead of stewed tomatoes, and garlic powder, since I had run out of normal garlic and didn't want to go to the store. I served it with rice, and the sauce was to die for mixed with the rice.

I found this recipe on allrecipes about 5 years ago.  My family is very picky and hard to please.  From the first time I made this recipe they LOVED IT!!!!  I have been making it ever since.  I usually serve it with penne pasta, french bread and a salad.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!

This was fantastic! I only made a few changes to suit my cupboards, I didn't have plain vinegar so I used half apple cider and half balsamic. I also used crushed chilis instead of chile powder as my family likes spicy food. We served it over rice with a green salad. Oh, yes, I also only used 4 chicken breasts, we had just enough sauce! We will definately make this a repeat dinner!

This was really nice but I think a few added vegetables would improve the overall texture and taste. Next time I make this I will add whole button mushrooms and peppers.

Hubby and I both loved this one!  The only things I altered was the ammount of Hot pepper sauce- I added more, and it went so well with the sweetness of it!!  Also, I didn't have any celery seeds so i used celery salt in place of the salt called for. This is a definite WINNER!!

This was really good and different! It uses ingredients that most will have on hand, which makes it really easy to throw together on a weeknight when you had nothing planned. Although it uses common ingredients, I thought it was nice because the ingredients used are not necessarily ones that are often used together, and they blended together very well! Definitely one to serve over rice, rather than pasta- the chili powder gives it just a slight Mexican edge, rather than an Italian taste, so it lends itself to rice more than pasta I think. I think this would probably work with pork or beef too.

This was pretty good - I made a few changes, left out celery seed as I didn't have any and substituted 1 tbsp prepared mustard for the mustard powder as I had run out.  Also left out the flour and butter - just combined all the sauce ingredients in a baking dish, threw the chicken breasts in with it, marinated it for 4 hours and then put the whole lot in the oven for 1/2 hour.  The chicken was incredibly tender, the sauce had quite a bite to it but not too much.  Made it for guests who commented on how tender the chicken was.  Served it over Quinoa and Black Beans from this website.  There was lots of sauce left over so I baked pork chops in the remaining sauce and they were really good too.

My husband loved this. He even licked the plate! I made as written except I used olive oil and much less salt. I think I would use less sugar next time also, but that's just a matter of taste. Will make again.

We really enjoyed this meal. I was quite surprised that it wasn't too spicy for me either. I did have to substitute a few things probably changed the consistency of the original recipe, but we really liked the version I came up with and will be making it again. This is what I did: I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used tomato paste (with a little extra water than what the recipe calls for). I also used Garlic Garlic (by Tastefully Simple) instead of a minced garlic. Turned out fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

After all the rave reviews, I was disapointed with this one. I agree with another reviewer that there are too many flavors competing with each other. If you make this serve it with a bland side dish like white rice or potatoes. This is one of those recipes either you hate, or love it. Sorry, I'm in the hate catagory.

this recipe was almost great - something was wrong, but i don't know what. i followed the directions exactly. i think next time i'll omit the vinegar and worcestershire and use white wine instead. it's definitely worth trying to work with, because the general flavor was very good. it wasn't what i expected. i'll try it again with the wine, but i would not make this exact recipe again.

This was a good recipe, but I didn't think it was all it was hyped up to be.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, but it was basically just BBQ chicken that took a long time to make.  I served it with mashed potatoes and corn, and the three foods seemed to compliment each other well.

I'm not sure if I maybe did this wrong, because it got very good reviews, but no one in my family liked this.  Myself included.  I think it tasted a lot like it was made with balsamic vinegar which I cannot stand the taste of, so perhaps it was my own personal taste-other reviewers here obviously enjoyed it!

This was just okay.  It was pretty much glorified bbq chicken.  Although I must say my husband enjoyed it but I don't think I would make it again.

Great flavor. Super easy. Wouldn't change a thing except maybe to pound the chicken breasts a little first to make them thinner. Thanks for a regular addition to our dinner menus!

Made this recipe just the other night for some house guests.  I wanted to try something different with chicken breasts.  Much to my selight, and my guests, this recipe turned out to be just what I was looking for.  What a GREAT recipe, and VERY easy to prepare.  Just one small suggestion, when using the canned stewed tomatoes, try a variation of the different flavoured stewed tomatoes that are available for a slightly different flavouor when you use this recipe!!  One SUPER recipe!!

This recipe deserves ALL the great reviews! It was so savory and delicious. I didn't think the kids would like the hot sauce and other spices, but the resulting flavor is so incredibly good! The kids sopped up every drop with the homemade French bread (from this site) I made as Nancy suggested. I can't wait to make this for company. I topped it with some long green beans (haricot verts) and let them steam on top of the simmering sauce and chicken. A superb meal!

I'll admit - the combination of seasonings does sound kind of strange, but this is a great dish.  My boyfriend does not eat tomatos, so I pureed the sauce, and every last bit was eaten!  Next time, I will use red wine for the water, and use 1/2 the brown sugar (this is very very sweet).  I threw in cooked rice (1 cup uncooked, cooked with 1 1/2 cups water) with 10 minutes to go, so I had a nice hearty, sauce with rice.  You need to at least double the sauce.  Cannot wait for leftovers today (never thought I'd ever hear myself say THAT)!!!!

Absolutely amazing flavor!  Made recipe with more sauce and probably still could have used more...it was just so tasty!  Added a bit more hot sauce (about 1/4t.) and it was perfect!  Definite fix again!  Thicker chicken takes longer so cut up chunks of breast might work better.

My whole family loved this one... even my picky 10 year old. Next time I'll double the sauce ingredients so I can serve it over rice or noodles. I wouldn't leave any of the spices out, as some readers suggested. They all add up to make one fantastic tasting dish!

This dish is fabulous!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. Have made it 4 times now, with 4 minimal changes. Used chicken broth instead of water, apple cider vinegar instead of white, and used crushed red pepper instead of hot pepper sauce. I omitted the 1 tsp of salt, and I also used less chicken, about half of what's called for, as it is just my husband and myself. I serve it with white rice. The sauce is delicious over the rice. A green veggie on the side and you're in heaven. The ingredients sound kind of odd at first, but the flavor is complex and melds very well. And the left overs are even better the next day! I highly recommend this dish. Rivals any fine restaurant dish I've ever had. Tip- to simplify, I measure all the dry ingredients out into one bowl and the wet into another bowl before starting the cooking, it makes the process much easier.

I used 4 individually packaged thin sliced chicken breasts (16 thin slices) and I couldn’t fit them all in one skillet side by side so I used another’s suggestion of cutting them into bite size pieces. I needed about 3/4 C flour to coat them all then sautéed in a 12.5” skillet. Pieces were basically cooked by the time I was done giving all the pieces a turn on the bottom of the skillet. I  Removed chicken, added a double batch of the rest, let that cook to a simmer then added the chicken back in, covered and let reheat 5-10 min. Served over a rice-a-Roni pilaf with added broccoli. Teenage boys and hubby enjoyed. 4 stars because it was good, not unbelievably fantastic!

This chicken and sauce were phenomenal.  Made exactly as stated except decreased the chile powder to 1 teaspoon.  Husband loved it.  Will make again (many times).

The only thing I did differently was used celery salt instead of celery seed and than omitted the salt.  (Didn't have celery seed).  Was incredible.  Very unique flavor.  Very easy to make and was great with the recommended crusty warm bread.  Will definitely be making this again.

One of the best chicken recipes I've ever made, and I've made many over the years. I followed the recipe exactly but used petite diced tomatoes instead of whole stewed, used a 50/50 blend of butter and olive oil for the browning and I replaced the 1/2 cup of water with 1 cup of chicken stock to make more sauce. It doesn't need the hot sauce but I had some leftover baby portabella mushrooms that I had to use up so I sliced them and added them the last 15 minutes of cooking. They were a great addition. I think the cook time is little long, so use a meat thermometer instead of the clock. Mine took less than 30 minutes and my fairly-thick chicken breasts temped out at 175 degrees.

Tasty! And something a little bit different from an Italian tomato sauce. I modified the recipe slightly by baking it. Also didn't have celery seed so omitted it, had to use a tbsp of prepared mustard as I was out of mustard powder. Next timer, I will reduce the sugar as I found it a bit sweet, and use boneless chicken breasts. Very adaptable.

We will be having this again with a few minor adjustments.  We like things spicy and the heat was negligible.  To cut the ketchup-y taste, I will be halving the amount of brown sugar used.  Instead of the 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 celery seeds added to the sauce, I will simply add 1 tsp of celery salt--as a personal preference.  Otherwise, the recipe is great and easy!  Thank you for sharing it.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this. I thought the recipe was going to taste very "tomatoey" because of the stewed tomatoes, but to my surprise the seasonings really added a lot causing this to be a very flavorful dish. I followed the recipe exactly with no adjustments. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I'm sooooo happy I tried this! I have been craving something new for almost a year! It is now my favorite pork recipe. I accidentally got out lean pork chops and I didn't change anything else! I was tempted to add onion or veggies and so glad I didn't. Have a salad if you want to be healthy. I haven't tried it with the chicken but I will! Best pork recipe I have now! Easy, everything was already at home! I bulk buy and freeze my meats. Surprise guests? no problem! I also accidentally put way too much Chicken Wing sauce in it and it was still amazing! I love the flavor!

Forget the chicken and just make the sauce for vegetarian dishes or use with pork chops - anything. Sauce was amazing. 
I used Aylmer Accents Spicy Red Pepper, petite cut stewed tomatoes and therefore omitted the hot sauce. Loved it.

I love finding new ways to cook chicken breasts and this one is a keeper for sure! Took lots of suggestions (diced tomatoes over stewed, wine over water, ditched the salt altogether, no celery seeds cause I didn't have any) but this is delish. Hubs wrote to me from work saying how good it was. Made with spaghetti and fresh green beans on the side. Thanks Nancy!!!

This is a thank-you note to Nancy who submitted this recipe.  Tried it for the 1st time tonight.  It was fabulous! I had to sub a couple of ingredients - prepared mustard for powder and diced tomatoes for stewed - but it turned out beautifully.  I only had bone-in chicken breasts so I used them, and served the whole wonderful mess over spaghetti squash.  I am SO keeping this recipe.   Note to those lovely folks out there who like to make a recipe their own:  This one is easy to add/subtract as needed.  I added a bit of onion and bell pepper, sauteed after the chicken and before the sauce.  You could add 'shrooms, zucchini, whatever, and the sauce will work wonders for whatever you throw in.  Thanks again, Nancy.

A great way to FLAVOR UP basic chicken. And it's great to utilize everyday staples in the pantry. I like to make extra sauce to spoon over rice. My family loves this dish!

This was excellent.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and didn't add as much chili powder and used chicken broth in place of water and added sliced onions.  Glad I did.  Next time, I think I may decrease the amount of sugar, it was a bit too sweet for us.  Other than that, it was delicious.

Would say 4.5 stars.  Nice to find a "different" chicken dish to add to the rotation!  I was tempted to add the onion and peppers but decided to try this recipe as-is.  It didn't dissapoint.  Also the stewed tomatoes I used had onion and celery in them so I think that helped.  I was going to make a simple boiled yukon potato with butter and parsley but didn't think it'd go with the chicken after I tried the sauce. So instead I boiled the potatoes then thick-sliced and pan-fried in peanut oil with salt and pepper until nicely browned and crispy.  They went along nicely.  Thanks for the recipe, it's nice to add another chicken dish to the repertoire! :)

Great recipe.  Chicken was very tender and had great flavors.  I substituted white wine for the water (I try to avoid using water whenever possible.)  Had a lot of leftover sauce, so I froze it and later used it as the main base for a shrimp and sausage jambalaya (which also turned out great!)

WOW! I was soo pleasantly surprised by this dish.  All the different flavors come together so perfectly.  My BF Cleaned both his and MY plate, whereas a typical chicken breast dinner may go slightly unfinished as the chicken around here comes from Mutant huge breasted birds.  He was raving about this, it was great.  Made a few substitutions due to what I had on hand.  First off I did not have canned tomatoes, only 2 fresh Roma tomatoes.  I boiled quick to get skins off and diced them.  I almost did not make it because I found no other reviewers with this substitution but it was MORE THAN FINE!! I added diced onions since i didnt have stewed tom. I also subbed Chicken broth for water.  I used the same sauce quantity for only 2 servings of chicken (one HUGE breast butterflied) and I am glad I did. I reduced the amount of chili powder and brown sugar by about 1/2 tsp, it was perfect! Oh and there is always room for an extra clove of garlic in any dish, this one is no exception. I did not dredge in flour either, due to that slimy texture that sometimes happens, I am sure the flour addition is to aid in sauce thickening, but I found that a tsp of cornstarch/water worked just fine to thicken slightly.
Once again I really loved the flavor and it was really simple, quick and easy THIS IS A MUST TRY!! I imagine anyone who rated this badly may have not had the exact ratio of spices right, idk or their tongue needs some practice with delicious FOOD!!!!

Love this! Do double the sauce, especially if serving with rice. I leave out the garlic, because there's really no benefit from that little bit of garlic anyway, and this is a no-chop meal without it. Lazy. This is a good dish for the lazy. :-)

First recipe that I would give more than five stars if I could!  Made exactly as stated except I forgot to add hot sauce. So tired of making the same old things and this was a nice change.  Smelled so good cooking too. Very easy to put together. I think this would be a great dish to make a lot of if having a party and need something for a sterno rack. Delicious!  We didn't have bread to soak up every last drop but no worries....some of us licked the bowl clean! Lol. Seriously. :) kids loved it too. 

Thanks!

This was really good. Very easy to make and the leftovers were delicious! I would def make again. Served with white rice and a veggie, but I think it would be better with angel hair pasta and perhaps asparagus or steamed brocolli.

My husband and son loved this.   A sweet and tangy sauce which boiled down to be more of a paste.   I only used two chicken breasts with the rest of the ingredients and I was wishing for more of the paste/sauce.   Not sure 6 chicken breasts would yield anything on the top of the chicken.   I didn't use the hot pepper sauce, but put a fresh home grown chili pepper (1 whole chopped) into the mix.   I will probably add 1.5 peppers next time.    We will make this one again !

Used same amount of ingredients of everything but with 4 chicken breasts. Yummy. Didn't have celery salt and omitted hot sauce for the kidlets. Also used 2 big tomatoes fresh instead of canned.

My husband loved this but I am still on the fence.  It tasted good but something was missing for me.  I followed the recipe exactly but only cooked mine for 20 minutes in the sauce and it was done perfectly. Anymore and it would have been overcooked.  I will make this again and see what it's like next time.

I liked the flavor and the ease of cooking, but the sauce was way too runny; also I had to add chicken broth in place of the water.

This is by far the best new recipe I have tried recently. The sauce is AMAZING! I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand so I used diced, but it's still great. Wish I could give more than 5 stars!

This is a winner!  I could not believe how easy this was to make. It's a great one-dish dinner.  My guests loved it!  This will become a regular dinner at our house.  The spices were fantastic and the chicken came out so tender.

My family LOVED this. Will be making again- often. I did add about 3 Tbsp minced onion to the sauce (which I doubled).  I chopped up the chicken prior to browning. Served over brown rice with green beans. PERFECT! Thanks for sharing!

Mr. LTH deemed this a "3", me a "4", so we'll round up and go w/the "4".  Oddly enough, Mr. LTH deemed this "bland"!  I didn't find it bland, in fact, I thought it might be a bit spicy for HIM!  I enjoyed the pan juices over rice, but the chicken just wasn't my favorite.  The only deviation I made from the recipe was to eliminate the celery seed per personal preference.  Our chicken breasts were small and only took about 25-30 minutes to reach 165.  THANKS for the nice change of pace, Nancy!

Loved it!  Found this recipe last night while I was searching for a meal I could make with just my staples.  Unfortunately, I didn't have stewed tomatoes, but I did have some fresh tomatoes and spaghetti sauce (which I was a little weary about substituting with).  It was still wonderful!!!  Also, I did add rough cut white mushrooms and I flattened the chicken breasts a little...I will continue to do both with this recipe.  So yummy - and great over white rice!

This was really delicious actually! I was a little surprised. I wasn't sure what it was going to taste like, but it was delicious! I took some suggestions from previous reviewers. Only did half the amount of chili powder, i didn't use the celery seed because I didn't have it, and I only did two chicken breast halves. I would say four is the max for the amount of sauce this provides. I used chicken broth instead of water, and we poured some of the sauce over Jasmine rice which was out of this world!!

I love this. I usually cube chicken breasts instead of leaving the breasts whole and serve over penne pasta. It isn't your typical tomato sauce, but the whole family enjoys this recipe.

Great recipe. I was out of the can of stewed tomatoes and substituted using left over salsa sauce and omitted the white vinegar. Wonderful spicy and bold taste.  I served it over bow tie noodles with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. A+

The chicken came out great but the sauce was WEIRD (and not in a good way). Sweet but tangy...just not our style. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed b/c I heard stewed made it a little sweeter. Still not a huge fan...

5 stars all the way Nancy, thank you. My husband loves this too! Which is saying a lot considering they're chicken breasts. If you have anymore great recipes please post:)

Oh, so GOOD!! I doubled the recipe, replaced some of the water with white wine, cut back on the chili and met in the middle on the tomatoes: 1 can stewed, 1 can fire-roasted diced. I had just started some brown minute rice when I remembered I had leftover "addictive mashed potatoes" (from this site) in the fridge. I don't know what got into me, but I decided to combine the cooked brown rice, a little olive oil, and the mashed potatoes, and somehow (weird as it sounds) it was the perfect sturdy yet absorbent starch for this rich, flavorful, tangy dish. My 9-year-old devoured two huge helpings, and my boyfriend went crazy over it! He took the leftovers for lunch the next day, and he works with five guys. That night, ALL FIVE significant others called me for the recipe! This is now in my regular rotation (and at least five other households'!) Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!  This was awesome!!  I think this is my new favorite chicken dish.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except for a few small changes.  I only used one teaspoon of chili powder and added about a 1/2 teaspoon more salt to the sauce.  Also I only simmered this for 30 minutes.  It turned out so deliciously.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

AWESOME recipe!  I will make this often!  Only thing I did different was used fire roasted diced tomatoes, because I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand... so I added an extra TBSP of brown sugar to compensate since stewed tomatoes are normally sweet... and I added a few extra shakes of hot sauce for good measure :)  WOW... I loved it!  Thanks Nancy for such a great recipe!

Used only 3 chicken breasts, but kept the sauce ingredient measurements the same. Didn't flour the chicken first, just browned in 1 tsp olive oil. Used canned fire roasted tomatoes. Flavors were just right and we loved it.

This is soooo good. I made it just as written but used EVOO to cook the chicken instead of butter. The ingredients come together to make this rich, yet surprisingly light, well balanced sauce. I did not have problems with the sauce being too sweet as others have said. If you put even amounts of sugar and vinegar, as the recipes says, you should get more of a tangy taste, not sweet. I served this with home made creamed spinach and wild rice. This goes into my dinner recipe rotation for sure!

This is a keeper!  It is delicious as is, but next time I may skip the flour step b/c I noticed the coating becomes a little soggy after it cooks in the sauce.

I served this over oil/herb angel hair pasta with creamy spinach.  We mixed everything together - the boyfriend really liked it and said it was a good mix of flavors.  I thought it wasn't bad, but he liked it more than me.  :)

I didnt no what to expect from this recipe, but was pleasantly surpised.  I served this over pearl (israeli) couscous that was boiled in a thin chicken base broth.  Seems like it would go well with just about any pasta though.  Next time will add sauteed vegetables, like squash, leeks... whatever i have on hand.

Everything in the pantry and so easy to put together. I had boneless, skinless chicken thighs which were very moist, also added some red wine and reduced the salt as other viewers suggested

Excellent! Added red onion chicken stock and white wine in place of water, added green pepper the last 10 mins, eliminated the brown sugar.... Served with jasmine rice and asparagus.

Smelled fabulous. Tasted great. Easy to assemble. Next time I will double the sauce, and use the left over for spaghetti or something on that line.

I have tried A LOT of recipes from this website, and this is one of my favorites!   The only changes I made:  I omitted the last tsp of salt, I left the cover off of the pan for the last 15 minutes of cooking to thicken the sauce, and next time I will probably cut the amount of celery seed in half.  I forsee myself making this often!

So quick and easy.  I did everything but the hot sauce.  Onions sounded good, as did things like black olives, but it didnt need it.  You could save those ingredients for something else.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous.  I used the white wine, and green peppers, and it was great.  My dog licked the plate clean, so it wasn't to hot.  This is a big 5 stars for me.  Thanks all for the recipes and the reviews.  I am not a creative cook so I can use all the help out there.

I made this last night as I was emailed the recipe. Let me say, I didn't have celery powder or mustard powder, but I thought it tasted like chicken with ketchup sauce. I really didn't think it was that good. If you look at the majority of the ingredients it is what you use to make ketchup. Won't make this again!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  As to the reader who commented on the cooking time being incorrect...my boneless chicken breasts were quite thick and took way over 20 minutes to cook through.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, my family loved it.

YUM!!  I put the sauce together earlier in the day, then sauteed  the chicken an hour before dinner time.  While it all cooked, I made some brown rice.  I will definitely be making this again!  The only change was that I used canned diced Mexican-style tomatoes because I didn't have stewed ones on hand.  So good!

This is by far the best chicken recipe I have ever made.  My family raved over it and we plan on making it on our family vacation it was so good.  Not only is this recipe amazing, but it is really simple to make.  I think the celery seed and worcestershire sauce are important because they are what give it awesome flavor.

Excellent dish and so easy.  Very seldom will my entire family like the same dish but this one made the cut for everybody.  Even my picky son went back for seconds.  The only changes were to add onions, cut the chicken into medallions and cut back by half on the chili powder since he (my son) hates spicy foods.

I added Onions, Zucchini, and Squash during the simmering process. The vegetables soak up the juices. This recipe is amazing!

Excellent - only word for it. I used skinless drumsticks because that's what I had. Instead of water, I went for the red wine. We served it with penne. What a great meal. Thanks so much for posting this one Nancy!

This was pretty good. My picky 7 yr old didn't care for it, but hubby and my other daughter loved it. I thought it was good, just not great, but I'd make it again. It actually tasted better the next day, as leftovers, to me!

I tried this recipe because of the high ratings. I followed the directions as given, for the mere fact that the ingredients are unusual. I did not care for this recipe.

this was soooooo tasty! The changes i made were the following: added half a white onion, subsituted A1 Sauce for the worsteshire and used canned tomatos with chili already in it so there was no need to add the chili and i served it with white rice. I also pounded my chicken breast to thin them out and used half italian bread crumbs and half flour and seasoned the flour.

Very good and different.  Forgot the water and didn't have any celery seeds, and used cider vinegar instead of white, but other than that used this recipe.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and only added sliced red peppers and onions to the recipe towards the end of cooking time. Served over onion barley and a side of green beans with toasted almonds.  Delicious meal!

This is a great recipe, served over angel hair. I made it the 1st time exactly as written using chicken breasts also have done it using 1” thick boneless pork chops and our favorite version is cutting the chicken breast into bite size medallions. When using pork chops reduce cooking time to 20-25 minutes and with medallions 15-20 minutes. Also I use diced tomatoes rather than stewed and I add to the flour mixture a teaspoon of McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Chicken. Awesome dish give it a try.

This was VERY disappointing. I was sure by the rating and reviews it would be good. I thought it was WAY to sweet and not spicy at all. I will not make this again.

This started out years ago as a family favorite, but for the past 3 years I've used the recipe to serve 25 homeless men plus 15 volunteers during the warm nights program at our church. 
 I use breasts and thighs, and I always double the sauce.  Serve with buttered noodles, green beans, french bread and salad - the reviews are amazing!

I made this exactly as the recipe states and was pleasantly surprised. Both my husband and I loved it. It wasn't as hot as I thought it would be and the flavor was very good. I served this on rice but next time will make sure I have pasta on hand. About the only thing I would do is add mushrooms to it (only because we are mushroom lovers) but other than that I love it just the way it is. I will be making this again and again.

This is something new and different and I'm glad I tried it.  It definitely has a different flavor - I liked it but I didn't love it.  I added a green bell pepper and a zucchini (used it instead of a chicken breast) so I could increase the veggies.  I think this is worth making but will not be a staple in my house.  I just didn't know whether to pair it with pasta or rice.  I didn't feel like it really belonged with either.  But worth trying.

This was amazing. It was a nice change from other chicken breast recipes. All five of us loved it --including my three (often picky) kids! I made the recipe as written except I used olive oil in place of the butter and left out the hot sauce. I think if I were planning on serving over noodles, rice or potatoes, I would double the sauce. I'll be adding this to our regular dinner rotation.

We really liked how this turned out. It is definitely sweet with the brown sugar and stewed tomatoes. I left it simmering too high and it got super thick, almost burnt, but that didn't take away from the flavors.   Some slight changes (which I think may have actually helped) - I didn't use the teaspoon of salt. Does not need more than a dash. I used celery salt instead of celery seed (all I had) and I didn't have mustard powder so I used a little squirt of brown mustard. The result was sweet and tangy and the simmering made the chicken really juicy. I will make again.

Love this twist on chicken.  I used mild Rotel tomatoes and green chilies, because that's what I had. Cut the chicken into large chunks.  Everything else as written. Yummy!  I serve it with angel hair whole wheat pasta.

This was delicious. I followed directions for the most part. The only changes I made was that I added 2 large fresh tomatoes and this made a HUGE difference in taste. I also added regular balsamic vinegar along with some white vinegar. I added some cayenne pepper and green onions too. IT came out very rich , and very tomatoey which I loved! Definitely a keeper and very easy to make!

I wasn't sure of this recipe when I read the ingredients.  I thought it would taste weird...  But it turned out amazing.  My husband and I actually had a little argument over who would get the leftovers!    I followed the recipe exactly, and was really impressed with the way the flavors worked together.  I served it over sticky rice.

Yep!  This is a keeper!!  Every single drop of this dinner was gone!  I only had 3 chicken breasts so I cut them into bite sized peices. And of course I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I started out thinking I had a can of stewed tomatoes...  I did not..  So I used 2 cans of tomato sauce.  Most everything else was the came though.  Since I used small chicken chunks, it cut the cooking time in half.  I served it w/ minute rice and corn.  Super easy dinner that I will definately make again

This is a 5 star plus recipe.
Make double sauce, do not double sugar.
Add onions red and green peppers.
You can substitute red wine for water.

Made this according to the directions, thought it was going to be very good, but it really wasn't. I told my husband (after he ate it) about one the bad reviews that says it chicken with bbq sauce over noodles and he said thats exactly what he was thinking too. Won't be making this again, sorry.

This is soooo good and easy to make. Followed instructions almost exactly. Used diced tomatoes and added bread crumbs to make sauce slightly thicker. Just the right spices in there. Will make it again soon!!

I really really liked this recipe - though I did make some modifications, the basis of the recipe is really good and flavorful. Instead of coating the chicken breast halves in flour, I cut the chicken into strips and panfried. I then doubled the sauce recipe, adding half an onion (minced), using chicken stock instead of water, omitting the salt and doubling both the garlic and hot pepper sauce (I tasted as I went, until it was as spicy as I wanted). I then brought to a boil, added the chicken back and baked it in the oven, uncovered - in the same pot - for about 45 minutes. I served it with honey glazed carrots and baked potatoes. However, if you don't like celery seed or chili powder, this is not the recipe for you, as the flavors are strong in this recipe.

So sorry-hated it. It cant decide if it's Chinese or Italian. Kept to the recipe except put uncooked breasts right in the sauce and simmered away(to keep down on fat). Big surprise with the ratings it is getting.

We really enjoyed this. I added on onion and cut the chili powder in half like some other reviewers. For the vinegar, I used half red wine, half white balsamic. I only had to simmer about half the time listed before the chicken was done. I only made two breasts, but kept the sauce the same- we used it over brown rice, and had broccoli on the side.

This recipe was really great!  A few changes I made: I used olive oil instead of butter, I didn't have any celery seed, so I omitted the salt and used celery salt and instead of mustard powder I used regular dijon mustard and it turned out great!  The friends I had over for dinner absolutely loved it!  Thanks!

I thought this was exceptional - it really hit the spot and was simple to prepare.  I used balsamic vinegar in place of distilled white and chicken broth in place of the water.  I could see where this recipe would benefit with the addition of sliced onions as well as some white wine for depth.  It was delicious - perfect blend of sweet and spicy and I will definitely make it again.  Perfect served over brown rice with a side of green beans.  Yum!  Thanks!

well, i made 2 minor, and 1 major alteration to this recipe: for the minor changes, i used a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and i replaced the white vinegar with balsamic. for the major change, i made this with swordfish instead of chicken--it was pretty good. the sauce sort of overwhelms the fish, but for those who are trying to get their families to eat more fish, this might be a good meal to start with. served it with couscous, but any grain would do also.

Yum - just my type of supper - easy and tasty. I used boneless turkey bottoms and it was great. I followed reviewers advice and doubled the sauce, but I think 1.5 times would be perfect. Use chicken broth instead of water.

This was ok. As I was adding the ingredients I had to stop and ask myself if I was making ketchup, cuz that is exactly what it smells like. I was hesitant about feeding this to my husband. I used dry white wine instead of water & reduced the vinegar to 1Tbs. I put the plate in front of my Hubby & avoided eye contact until he ate it. He said he would eat it again if I was cooking in a hurry.  Sorry but I just can't take that as a compliment.

I prefer this dish with a little less chili powder and smaller pieces of chicken but overall, very quick and delicious.  This will be a regular for my family.

I was definitely disappointed by the flavor after reading all the great reviews. Followed recipe exactly and it tasted wierd--all the flavors did not blend well for me. Also, the "sauce" is very thin. I will not be making this again.

Awsome! Love this one. Couple of suggestions...If you have very thick chicken breasts cut them into two filets. This makes for a very moist breast with this recipe. Also, thicken the sauce with flour. It makes this meal from a good meal into a great one!

Hello everyone,  I made this dish tonight and it was very tasteful and It was excellent.  I suggest to use rice instead of pasta becasue with pasta it doesn't get the flavor but I think if you use rice it will be great and everyone who you serve it to will be thanking you forever for making it for them.  If you don't like hot foods don't try it!  But if your tastes are good then try this dish.  I served it too my family (4 People)  they all said it was good and excellent and that they would have it again.  good luck!!!

Really good - even my 2 kids ate it up.  Next time I would substitute petite diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes as the stewed tomatoes were too big to incorporate easily into the sauce.  The chicken was incredibly tender and moist.  A hit!

This recipe was delicious! I did change it a tiny bit though, but all the basic stayed the same, I had no celery seeds, but it didn’t take away any of the flavour! I also made the recipe in the slow cooker and left it for 4 hour, once finished I added a cup of sour cream… YUMMY!!!!!!!!! The chicken was soooo soft and sour cream just took the sharpness away, eventhough you could still taste the spices! It was amazing! Thank

I seem to be the lone dissenter here, but I really didn't care for this recipe. I followed it exactly and the sauce was OK, although it tasted mostly like chili powder. Sorry, this one isn't for me.

I'm usually not one to gush but, I LOVED this recipe!! It has a very unique flavor.  After reading other reviews, I doubled the sauce, using half red wine, half water, and cut the chili powder in half.  I pounded boneless chicken thighs, and browned them in a mixture of butter and macadamia nut oil (healthier than even olive oil, I'm told, and delicious). Perfect!  Served with mashed cauliflower, this was a healthy carbers dream meal.

This was pretty good, but I will probally not make it agian. If you decide to make it I would not simmer it as long as it was suggested because the sauce gets a little pasty. The meat was nice and juicy, but the sause wasn't very good.

WOW!  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  This is one of the very best recipes I have found on Allrecipes.  I made it with half breasts and half thighs and tripled the garlic.  I discovered Hunts makes a diced tomato using the same recipe as original stewed tomatoes, so I used them instead.  I was amazed by the combination of flavors.  My husband raved and my picky 19 month old daughter ate more than usual.  This will become a regular in my recipe rotation!

I was skeptical about this recipe but was I ever surprised.  What nice flavor.  This one will have a place of honor in my recipe book.  It is so quick to throw together.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of spicy brown mustard for the dry mustard because I didn't have any.  Like some other reviewers I just couldn't picture this with pasta so I tried with rice.  It was fine but after considerable thought, I will serve with a cheesy mashed potato next time.  I think the yummy sauce would go nicely with potato.  Great recipe.  I found and cooked it last night and have already e-mailed it to two friends!

Chicken is super-moist! Good recipe--doesn't have quite the "kick" I wanted--expected more flavor...I will try again, adding more spices or something. If anything, good way to make excellent chicken!

Yummy!!! We loved this.  I have actually served this for a dinner party.  Everyone loved it!!  I made these changes...chicken broth instead of water, balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar, and omited the celery seed...personal preference, I hate them. :) The flavor of this dish is delightful.  Very robust!

i should have stopped when i browned the chicken breasts in butter and served that with pasta instead of adding all those other ingredients. i followed this recipe to the tee. this is VERY spicy.  i can't imagine kids eating it. the chili powder and all the other ingred. make for a very spicy meal.  i was disappointed. oh well, if you like it hot....try this one!  very mediterrian!

I put off making this recipe for a long time, and I really wish I would have made it sooner! I didn't use chili powder or hot pepper sauce, I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, white cooking wine in place of the water and 1/4 tsp. celery salt instead of the celery seeds. I served this with angel hair pasta and French bread and it turned out AWESOME. Next time I will probably double the sauce and use chicken tenderloins instead of the breasts. This was absolutely delicious, everyone in the house loved it, even my 4 year old daughter. We almost always have leftovers after dinner, but not this time! Thank you, Nancy, this dish will be a staple in my house from now on!

I am baffled by how this one became a 5-star recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the whole family hated it.  It tasted like chili gone horribly wrong.  I'm not even going to try to fix this recipe, there was nothing about it that I liked.

This was one of the best dishes yet on this site.  If I could rate it more I would.  Followed the directions exactly except I omited the hot pepper sauce because I did not have any.  My husband and kids raved about this dish.  My youngest son looked like he licked his plate clean to get every last bit of the sauce.  I served with a warm sour dough bread and it was wonderful with the sauce and chicken.  Thanks Nancy!

AWESOME!! I used balsamic vinegar, white wine instead of water, and added a bouillon cube and sliced onions. My 12 year old who hates everything that doesn't come in a paper sack out of a window ate ALL OF IT!!!!! For him to eat an entire chicken breast, it must be good!

This will definately be a family as well as a 'make for company' dish! I pounded the chicken breasts equal thickness, used two cans of stewed tomatoes, used white wine rather than water, and balsamic vinegar rather than white.  Everyone age 8-50 loved this, very little plate clean-up!  Two friends asked for the recipe.  The sauce reminded me of the wonderful flavor of a shrimp dish I've had.  I may try this w/ shrimp, being careful not to overcook...Thanks Nancy!

Chicken was extremely tender.  Used 2x stewed tomatoes and substituted white wine for water.  Very tasty.

Loved this recipe. Although I don't like to have to measure lots of spices, this was manageable and tasted so good! My husband continually raved about it as he ate it. It is going to be a standard around our house!

This is probably the best chicken recipe I've ever made. It goes great with garlic bread to mop up the sauce.

This was just wonderful. The only changes I made were: Browning the breasts in olive oil instead of butter, adding a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and using more hot pepper sauce. When I first saw the recipe, I wasn't sure how the ingredients would come together. I was worried over nothing. This was terrific. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe for all ages. To spice it up a little, I quadrupled the chili powder. Also, I cut the chicken into 1-2 inch cubes for easier eating and it seems to make it even more flavorful.  This dish is easy enough to prepare on a busy weekday evening, but fancy enough to use for an alternative holiday or celebratory meal.  A huge hit for my whole family.

Just made this for dinner this evening and like so many other reviewers...it's a hit!  I had a 'brain fart' and couldn't remember if I added the vinegar (even when tasting the sauce), so I only added 1 tablespoon that I can account for. I also substituted chicken broth for the water.  Next time I will check for doneness at 30 minutes...35 minutes and the chicken was just a little overdone.  I can't wait to make this one again...THANKS NANCY!

My family loved this! I was a afraid of trying it with all of the ingredients...I didn't think it would taste good, but most of the reviews were 5 stars so I tried it!  I did use 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine, 2 Tbl. brown sugar, 2 Tbl. white vinegar and 2 Tbl. red wine vinegar and used 2 cloves of garlic, but kept everything else the same.  Great served with rice or pasta.  And great the next day for lunch! Everyone I have given this recipe to loved it also!  Thanks!

I know I'm in the minority but this just tasted like a bland barbequed chicken.  I always try a recipe exactly as it is written the first time, but this time I guess I should have added some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, but it just didn't work for us.

This dish is wonderful!  I was concerned with the odd ingredients, but what a wonderful flavor.  The only thing I added was chopped onions after cooking the chicken, and added more spices to flour to coat the chicken (garlic/onion powders).
Will make again for sure.  Thanks Nancy!

Oh My, this is wonderful.  My husband made this recipe but cut the recipe in half and used a whole can of stewed tomatoes. It was just enough sauce to serve over noodles. It was not too spicy, just right.  Really delicious.

Loved it.  Easy, with plenty of flavor.  NOTE:  the recipe calls for mustard powder.  However, when I created a grocery list for this dish, it asked for mustard seeds instead.  This is a little confusing.

Excellent!  This has wonderful flavor, I added more chili powder than the recipe said and it turned out great.  Also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but next time I'll cut the water in half.  Wonderful served with egg noodles - will definately make again.

This was a wonderful dish! I scaled the sauce WAY up (to 12 servings) and only used seven chicken breasts and it was perfectly proportioned. I put in a lot more hot sauce than recommended to suit our own tastes. I will definitely make this often!!!

This is a GREAT dish. The chicken was amazingly tender and moist. The flavor reminded me of a cuban dish. Next time I make it I will use double the stewed tomatoes to make more sauce and because I love them :) I also substituted white wine for the water.

For anyone else who is nervous about trying this recipe--just try it, it's worth it!  I really wasn't sure about the mixture of flavors, even with all the great reviews.  But I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to try it.  Used only two chicken breasts so I had a lot of extra sauce, it was delicious!  We will definitely make this again, I'm so glad I tried it!!

Wonderful!  This is the best chicken receipe that I have had in a long time.  It reminds me a bit of my 100% Italian grandmother's tomato sauce with the sweetness.  We used Chardonnay Vingear instead of white (it was what we had on hand)and served over wheat pasta.  I was so disappointed when I was full - I had to stop eating!

I read the reviews and said to myself, "this can't be true - too good to be true".  It was Monday night at 9 pm and I said to myself, "I'll give it a try" and voila IT IS EXCELLENT!  I had to stop myself because I wanted to eat all of the chicken breasts.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I did the recipe exactly (except used red wine as noted in most of the reviews).  Can't wait to pass this one on and will use again and again. . . . .

I try new recipes often, and this recipe is by far my favorite to have picked up from the net.  It's really easy and my wife and kids love it.  I typically leave out the hot sauce for the kids and use diced instead of stewed tomatoes for chunkyness... but anyone looking for an excellent, different chicken recipe really needs to grab this one.

Wonderful! My husband told me it was just like a 'fancy' restaurant dish. Served it over angel hair pasta and with homemade rolls. Will definitely make again, but I will add mushrooms and skip the salt. I also added a bit more pepper to the flour mixture and more water to tomato mixture when it was done.

My whole family loved this. I would highly 
recommend using white wine instead of the water
and white wine vinigar rather than the distilled.
Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

I prepared this dish late in the evening and served it the next day for supper. The sauce was flavorful, the aroma filled the house. I have five kids who loved it. I served it with rice and green beans. I will make it again. Thanks, Nancy!

I LOVED this recipe!  My husband I almost ate the entire pan-full ourselves!  I used 4 chicken breasts and added fresh mushrooms.  I could make this every week!

This was really good.  I needed something to whip up quick one night, and found this.  I had everything in the recipe, except celery seed, so I just left that out.  I also didn't drain the tomatoes, because I was going to serve this over rice and I wanted more sauce.  I used boned and skinned thighs as well as the breasts; both turned out juicy and delicious.  After the chicken was cooked, I removed it from the sauce and sliced it, then returned it to the pan.  My kids liked it, and I found it to be very easy and yummy!  Next time I make it, I will add sliced onions; I think the sweetness of some onion would go well with the slight sweetness of this recipe (the same reason onions go well with brisket).  Overall, I would recommend this for a quick weeknight dinner.

Yum!  I made it for company last night and was just tickled with the result.  Classy combination of flavors...Company loved it, we loved it, my 2 year old loved it, 7 year old wanted PB&J.  His loss.  Thanks for a keeper!

This dish might have a french name...but don't be fooled!  It is a great recipe for barbeque chicken.  We loved it and will use the sauce for other cuts of meat as well.

I made this recipe as stated and I thought it was delicious. Hubby did not like it but he is very picky. That made leftovers for me for lunch and having it then I realized I liked it even better than the night before. I will add this to my list of meals to make when hubby is not home for dinner!

Oh My Goodness! I am not even gonna lie...this was incredible! The only thing I did different was omit the hot sauce. We are spicy wimps in my household but it still had a nice kick with the pepper (I use white pepper), chili powder and ground mustard. I served on top of steamed rice with the tomatoes and sauce poured over top of chicken and rice. I will definitely be adding this into the rotation at least once a month, if not mre. Sooo good! Thanks for sharing. :)

Okay, the first time I made this, it just tasted weird. Too sweet, too much vinegar, odd mix of spices. I couldn't even bring myself to eat it after all that work. But I couldn't bring myself to throw it away either. So I put it in the freezer for year. ?? Then I heated it up in the oven and let it cook in the sauce for about an hour. I was afraid to try it again, but when I did.... Fabulous. ?? I don't know I hated it the first time, maybe the flavors just needed time to blend better. I only gave it three starts because I hated it the first time.

This is a great chicken dish with a few changes. I did not have mustard powder so used Dijon mustard. Substitute white vinegar with either balsamic or apple cider vinegar, use white wine instead of water. I also added red onion and mushrooms. Served over cauliflower rice. Do not add any salt to sauce mixture. Plenty of flavor from all other ingredients.

I followed the recipe exactly, and this chicken is a winner!  All the ingredients were in my pantry, making this a great “what should I do with chicken tonight?” recipe.  I served it with spaghetti squash and a green salad. Yummy!

Will definitely make this again!  Both my husband and I loved it. The only changes I made were substituting  wine for the same amount of wine and using a 19 ounce can of  diced tomatoes. Delicious!  Also love the fact that it’s low calorie.

Delicious!  This was the 1st recipe I tried using the instant pot to sear and pressure cook the chicken.  Only used 2 breasts and pounded them just enough to even out the thickness.  The rest of the ingredients and amounts were kept the same as written except I didn't add any salt (Dr's orders), or celery seed (all out).  Used chicken stock in place of the water.  Under pressure the flavor went deep into the breasts and they were very tender.  Will definitely make this again  Had plenty of sauce left over.  Strained the liquid and used it to make rice the next day.  Add a little bit of ground beef to the rice and this would make a flavorful Spanish rice dish.

Unique flavor and YUMMY. Next time I'm going to try this with shredded chicken over rice. I used regular canned diced tomatoes and this was on the sweet side, but not overpowering.

The only change I made to this recipe was that I omitted the hot sauce, as nobody in my family will eat spicy things. 

Let me start by saying that this was a weird tasting recipe. The spices were okay, minus the amount of chili powder, and would probably make a good marinade/rub. I would combine the spices again with the liquids to create a marinade/rub, but I would lessen the amount of chili powder- it is way too strong. In fact, the whole thing tasted like chili powder.

The plus to this recipe was that the chicken turned out tender.

The sauce is watery and if you look at the ingre dients, you're essentially making ketchup here. If I were to do it again I might try substituting wine for water, throw in some aromatics. and definitely reduce the sauce after.

This is one recipe I keep going back to, over and over, with great results.   The first time I made it, I followed the directions, as written, and we loved it.  Since then, I've changed the ingredients simply because of what I've had on hand.  I've found we like using garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic, and I use fire-roasted diced tomatoes with seasonings (great flavor) and omit the hot pepper sauce.       Additionally, I like to  slice the chicken breasts horizontally into two or three pieces, place in a plastic bag and pound slightly; season with salt and pepper and dust lightly with cake flour (cake flour gives a very nice light coating), before sauteeing.  This is wonderful served with angel hair pasta and fresh steamed green beans.   I'm a personal chef - clients ask for this dish repeatedly!

Holy Amazing! This was ridiculous-mouth watering- fantabulous! I used 4 large chicken breasts instead of 6 since that was what I had and the rest I made AS IS! I wouldn't change a thing. It was sooo easy and my Hubby loved it so much- he wrote it in his calendar LOL! There was still plenty of sauce left over too- and the sauce turned out perfect and so flavorful. So looking forward to have it again for lunch tomorrow. I served it over white and wild rice, roasted garlic asparagus topped with parmesan cheese, with crusty french bread ....MMM  MMM  MMMMM! Thank you so much for sharing!

Great and easy.  Family loved it.  I'm not a fan of spicy food. i cut the chili powder in half and omitted the hot sauce.

Like another reviewer I added chunks of green pepper, red onion and then some canned pineapple, substituting the juice for water, used balsamic vinegar instead of distilled.
Husband loved it.

it was easy and flavorful, but I agree,  to  salty for me. I think I would add some scallions , mild peppers, carrots and mushrooms to the dish

Used chicken broth instead of water (increased it to abt 1/2 cup, doubled since doubling the sauce, so 1 cup) and used fire roasted diced canned tomatoes instead of stewed. Double the sauce!!  And skip the extra 2 tsp of salt. Yummy!

first time making this, won't be the last.  I didn't change a thing except used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed.  Given the sauce consistency, it screamed to be served over spaghetti, which the whole family loved.

I've made this many, many times in the last few weeks.  Most of the time I've followed the recipe as written, however I did add a can of artichokes and served it over rice and it was just as good.

This was good...not great. but good. I am rating it as I cooked it exactly as listed with no variations. I will most likely make it again because it has potential. It just needs to be tweaked a little to add more flavor.

I was excited to give this a try after reading all the great reviews. I wasn't a fan. For my personal taste tomato and chicken simply didn't float my boat. I am happy I tried, but this one isn't for me. Thanks. Kim

Myself and husband thought this was delicious.  I didn't have to make any changes just did because I had some beautiful red peppers that I needed to get rid off so, I sliced some and added them to the sauce.  Will make this a regular in my house and it is quick and easy too.

My family loved this .  At first it seemed like a lot of steps, but then you just sit back and let it simmer so that frees up alot of time.  I didn't have celery seed but that was my only change.  And i used muir glen fire roasted diced tomatoes with the juice.  We loved it as is but I may try some of the other reviewers suggestions just to see.  This won't let you down....try it!!  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!

Only put 1tbs of vinegar and 1tsp of sugar.  Used boneless chicken thighs.  Would leave out vinegar or substitute with white wine.

Made this tonight  and it was so good!! Even my picky 10 yr old loved it!  Only changes I made was I only used 4  boneless chicken breast, I used diced tomatoes  instead of stewed and only used 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  And it was perfect  I'm not big on spicy food that burns as u try to eat it.  This was  perfect! I couldn't get enough of the sauce. I put it over my chicken and whole grain brown rice.  So good! I will definitely make this again and again!!! ??

I've been making this since 2011, so obviously we love it!  The only thing I do differently is cut the chicken breasts into medallions so they cook faster.  Great recipe!!

What a good dish, my husband loves anything piquant with a tangy flavor (me too).  I made this with just two chicken breasts halves but all the measurements the same, in other words, lots of sauce for the chicken and rice. I used a can (14.oz) fire roasted diced tomatoes, chicken broth, chopped a small yellow onion and proceed with the rest.  I did the browning on the stove but did the simmering in the oven (350).  I like using a ten inch cast iron enameled pan with lid for this wonderful  ONE pan dish!

I didn't used the flour, just browned the chicken quickly on both  sides. I made no other changes to the recipe as submitted. GREAT chicken! Flavorful and spicy. I will definitely make this again.

My mother made this recipe for our family and it was AMAZING! The flavor is very unique and went along with a side dish of vegetables quite nicely, if I do say so myself.... I was convinced that it contained barbecue sauce,  so I was surprised when my mother showed me the recipe. :) I definitely recommend this recipe for someone looking for a new recipe with a unique flavor. I can't praise it enough. Just...wow!

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE I'VE EVER MADE!  And, i've tried many.   Chicken Pierre reigns supreme!  There is something subtle but incredibly savory and delicious about this.  I did read the previous tips and substituted chicken broth instead of water.  I pounded the chicken.  I lessened the chili power in half. I added diced red onions..  I added cayenne pepper in the flour.  I doubled the diced tomatoes.  My husband asked for angel hair and it was perfect.  I also seared spinach in olive oil with garlic and red peppers to splash on top.  UNBELIEVABLY GOOD and beautiful presentation.

This was awesome! I used chicken broth and wine instead of water and steak sauce instead of worchester sauce (I didn't have any). Very easy. I loved the way the ingredients are those that are usually on hand. Definitely a keeper!

Saw five stars. Had ingredients available. Commenced cooking without much thought.  It was barbecue sauce.  Tried to salvaged with mushrooms and onions... no go.  Need to find buns to make barbecue chicken sandwiches.

Soo easy and quick! I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar, omitted the Worcestershire sauce and used 1 tablespoon of mustard instead of mustard seed, plus I used chicken broth instead of water...I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!

Family says this is a keeper!  Had to use a can of Rotel though that and the chili powder made it a bit spicy for me but not the reset of family.   My daughter wrapped it in a tortilla.

I was not a fan of this recipe. I didn't change anything in the recipe, but just didn't care for the flavors. I wouldn't recommend making this dish.

For two people, I used two boneless skinlees breasts. I used a tenderizer mallet to beat them down to a 1/2" and cut them into cutlets. I then followed the recipe. The finished dish was a hint of chili vs. barbecue and delicious!

Wow - Chicken Pierre is delicious. Loved the suggestion of the french bread to mop up the sauce. I cooked snow peas with it and it was awesome. Thank you, Nancy for sharing this. My husband said it was the best thing I've ever cooked.

This was EXCELLENT. I'm sure this would have been terrific exactly as written.  Howevre, like many others have mentioned, I used a good white wine in place of water and omitted the vinegar. I also doubled the sauce recipe, using fire roasted diced tomatoes in place of stewed. Like SUNKACHER2, I added a step 1.5 and sauteed 3/4 of a very thinly sliced white onion, and sliced red and green bell peppers. Deglazed the pan with the wine and then moved to Step 2. I only had boneless skinless chicken breast tenderloins on hand so this is what I used, although I did cut them into bite sized pieces before browning. I did reduce the chili power due to personal preference.  I will definitely make this again and again!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

We all ate it but the agreement by all was to not make again.   Did cut down on the Brown sugar by 1 TBL since we do not like sweet main dishes. It still was too sweet.

I've made this recipe for a few years now and it's a favorite in my family. I adapted it once for a buffet dinner party, and instead of braising in the skillet, I put the chicken and sauce in baking dishes, covered them in foil, and let them bake about 35-40 minutes. This worked very well. When I made this last night, I placed trimmed fresh green beans on top of the chicken in the skillet and simmered them together. The green beans were perfect when the chicken was ready. I'll do this every time now!

This came out delicious!   Great recipe for when you can't think of anything "new" to do with chicken breasts.  I love it because all of the ingredients I usually always have in my pantry!  Served over white rice and broccoli as vegetable.

We were surprised at how well this turned out!  I did not have chili powder, so made my own variation using cumin and oregano.  I also subbed balsamic vinegar and used liquid stevia (in place of brown sugar).  OH - I also softened onions and celery first and added the liquid ingredients.  This turned out thick, which we love.  Next time will double the liquid ingredients and add sausage and shrimp.  A keeper!!!

Chicken Breasts Pierre Haiku: "Fairly tasty dish. Taste was salty bbq, little watery." Guess I'll smack myself for assuming that "Pierre" in the title made this a French dish b/c once I started putting it together, I realized that it was basically a bbq sauce that unfortunately never thickened nor reduced, so while the taste was great, it was just too much liquid (and too much of a salty liquid) that slid off the chicken. I scanned the hundreds of glowing reviews, most of which changed this or that, but I was entirely faithful to the recipe. I guess if I made it again I'd heed alot of the reviewer's suggestions, or I'd at least tool around w/ making it less salty, or I'd whisk in some cornstarch w/ water at the end to thicken up the sauce.

I made this recipe but did not have stewed tomatoes or diced tomatoes. I added pace picante sauce (about 3/4 cup) It was delicious. Everything else was as called for. I'm not sure if I will try this again with stewed tomatoes, or stick with the Pace picante sauce.

Awesome recipe and VERY flavorful and tender. The "sauce" it makes is wonderful. Followed the recipe in every way except I only had canned diced tomatoes, not stewed. Served it with rice and roasted Brussels sprouts. This will be an easy go-to recipe for us.

This has to be the best chicken dish i've ever had.  The initial was too spicy for my husband so i did a second batch of sauce (I used the spicy batch for my lunch the next day).  The chicken was so tender and full of flavour, the chunks of tomato were just as great.

Thanks for posting this recipe.  It's a keeper.

Super easy!  I love that you don't have to follow all the ingredients.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stew tomatoes.   I didn't have garlic powder, celery or chili powder so I used Adobo.  I also didn't add hot sauce. I also only had apple cider vinegar.  It was delicious.   I think the tomatoes and sugar really make the dish.  Definitely making again!

This was so good!
I was looking for a different way to prepare chicken breast.
I used fresh tomatoes instead of the stewed and added some onion, zucchini and haberno pepper as I had these on hand.
I also diced the chicken and added some pineapple chunks before serving to take out some of the "bite" of the dish.
Thanks for this recipe!

This was possibly the best chicken I have ever made.  I loved it and so did my husband.  I made a few small modifications to the sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I diced fresh roma tomatos (instead of canned) and used chicken broth instead of water.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used red wine vinegar.  I also omitted the mustard powder because I don't like it.  I used a meat tenderizer to make the chicken breats thin so they did not take quite so long to cook.  This recipe was fairly time consuming, but it was SO good!

Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe, it is a family favorite now!  I make it almost exactly as you, but occasionally I add a couple more garlic cloves and leave out pre-flouring the chicken before browning.  Since my husband does not enjoy chunks of tomatoes, I throw all of the sauce ingredients into a blender and pulse for a few seconds then add to the pan and bring to a boil.  We sometimes add freshly grated Parmesan to the chicken on our plates!  Add a side of rice and you have incredible comfort food!  (I've accidentally left this simmering for over an hour and the chicken melted in our mouths!)

Love this recipe and I make it all the time! Very rich and delicious, and also very forgiving if you accidentally pour way too much hot sauce in... I usually make this recipe as written, and I love that I have all these ingredients in my kitchen regularly - no special trips to the supermarket!

This was pretty good.  The sauce had a nice flavor.  I used chicken breasts and found them to be too big for this recipe.  Next time, I might cut them in half or try using thighs.  Overall though, not bad and will make again.

This recipe is my husbands new favorite! I did do some things different. I cut chicken breasts into cubes and covered those with flour and then salt and pepper. When they were fully cooked I took them off the oven and added the rest of the ingredients to the pan I already used. After it was all done I topped the chicken on some jasmine rice and added the sauce on top...so delicious!

I made this last night.  I followed the recipe exactly but doubled the ingredients for the sauce/gravy.  It was perfect.  Flouring the chicken is important because after browning the chicken the flour left in the pan thickens the sauce. I did use only 1 can of diced tomatoes because my kids don't like them but did eat them in this.  I had no problems with the sauce thickening and used 1c of water and all the juice from tomatoes.  I also pounded my chicken breast flat because I always do.  My family loved it!!! Very easy!!

Always looking for new chicken recipes, and this one got race reviews from myself and my husband. The flavor is amazing and unique - not your typical italian or Mexican or BBQ influence -- just really good flavor. We had it over rice and will definitely make it again!

Made this dish last week & it was excellent & easy to make. A little variation from the original receipe; I seared the chicken in olive oil instead of using flour; I added the last of some white wine I had; used a homemade herbal vinegar instead of white; added extra tsp of chili powder but left out hot sauce. Also added more garlic. Everyone loved it.

Was pretty good and kinda thought I might taste the chili powder but it just has that hint after the fact.  Will make this again, and try it in crock pot too.

It was easy to make it, and my son said that the butter makes it smell really nice. Wait until hi tries it! It looks great, and it tastes even better.

I made this because I had some extra stewed tomatoes I wanted to use up. It was alright.  It had a little bit more bite than I was expecting, between the vinegar, tomatoes, and chili powder.  Definitely an easy dish to make.  Nothing wrong with it, just not my favorite. Probably won't make again.

Delicious. The only little thing which kept me guessing was the quantity of water when I started making the gravy. I thought it was too much water and so instead of keeping it covered and simmering, I turned up the heat to medium-high and boiled off the water. After 40 mins I got the consistency I wanted and the chicken was perfectly cooked. Thanks for this great recipe.

Awesome!  Added chopped red onion, yellow peppers, zucchini, and corn…what a great taste!  I did only add 1 tsp of chilli pepper and 1/2 the salt. Perfect, redo!

We just finished and I really liked this dish a lot! So did family! Only changes I went with was added some red onion saute'd used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have white. Also used equal amounts of chick broth/whit wine in place of h20. I always double sauce recipes would rather have to much vs. Not enough. Saved to recipe box and will make again. This dish had lots of flavor and nice colored sauce

What a great recipe for chicken.  I thought I had tried them all.  I served with orzo and green beans, with some crusty bread.  We absolutely loved it.  I folowed the recipe to a tee, with the exception of using chicken broth for the water.

We loved the flavor, noting that it is a bit heavy on the sweet side. I heard others say it was too salty, but I was happy with the amount of salt. 
The chicken is tender, flavorful, and the sauce is delicious. I shaved about 20 minutes off the time by slicing the chicken breasts in half width-wise (on the flat), making them more like cutlets. They cooked up quickly when I browned them, and I left them simmering for more like 15 to 20 minutes rather than 35 to 40.

I would serve this dish to company - - it was THAT good!  The only change I made was I substituted red wine for the water.  But otherwise, the sauce was absolutely delicious!  I would serve that sauce over ANYTHING!  I could imagine this served over mashed potatoes with a veggie and crusty bread.  A very hearty meal and PERFECT for the cooler weather coming here.  Thanks for a great meal, Nancy!

I have to admit, I had low expectations about this one when it was cooking. When I ate it, I was super pleased, as was my husband and my buddy!  I followed what other reviewers said and used regular petite diced tomato's, I think it was a wise choice cause it was a pretty sweet tasting dish as it was.  Well done!

Made this for dinner tonight and my whole family is still raving about it!! Thank you for sharing!! I only cooked half the chicken and all of the sauce and it was the perfect ratio. Next time I will double the sauce for 6 chicken breast. I served it over rice so we need the extra sauce. Oh and I didn't have mustard powder so I just put in a squirt of yellow mustard. So GOOD!!!!

Magnifique!  délicieux!  I'm French so of course I added white wine, Pinot Grigio will do nicely, Just enough to cover each of the chicken breasts But at least half cup!  This makes the chicken even more tender the longer it simmers.  Excellent choice on powdered mustard seed so that it is not as strong. I left out the celery seed and added I need powder.

The best chicken recipe I've found here on allrecipes! Heck, the best one I've ever had! Loved the fact it's not a creamy sauce. I've never made a dinner dish with brown sugar and hot sauce, so there was a minor doubt.  TOTALLY dropped that doubt when I tasted it before it cooked, and was blown away when it was done. There isn't one thing I would recommend changing for your first time with it. The only thing I'm going to do differently next time is add some onions. I absolutely love this!!

This was delicious, though I had to modify it to suit what I had on hand.  I browned the chicken in olive oil rather than butter, then moved that to the oven to keep it warm, and sauteed half an onion and the garlic.  I doubled the sauce because I wanted to serve it over pasta, but only used one tablespoon of brown sugar.  I also used coriander and cayenne in place of chili powder, dijon instead of mustard powder, white wine instead of vinegar, chicken broth instead of water, and grape tomatoes for the stewed.  Once I returned the chicken to the pan I added some flour to thicken it and a pat of butter for flavor, and then let it simmer for about 40 minutes, turning the chicken over once.  Served over whole wheat thin spaghetti.  It was one of the best meals we have eaten in quite a while and I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used fresh tomatoes, otherwise followed the recipe.  Very good.  Next time, I'll double the sauce.  Not sure why other reviewers thought this was too spicy.  Ours didn't turn out spicy at all.

This was fabulous.  My 8 year old literally licked her plate.  I made as written except added some red pepper flakes and much more hot sauce.  Also added the step of frying some onions.  I object to the name, though - I think we're going to call it "Chicken Zip" cause it is so delicious.  Next time I may just toss it all in a crock-pot - frying up the chicken first doesn't really fit into my schedule.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

absolutely delicious! I have no clue what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe, and it ended up looking like barbecue sauce. I'll try messing around with it and seeing if I can do it better next time.

This recipe is fantastic.  Really didn't expect it to be so good, but it is. I didn't do anything differently except to halve the amount of chicken breasts used and cut it into six pieces (which equated to double the sauce for the amount of meat). I also reduced the salt just a tad. And I used honey instead of sugar. The sauce is AMAZING!!  I uncovered it during the last 15 min. of cooking and that helped to reduce/thicken it. Yummmmmmm. This is going into our regular rotation, for sure.

My husband also loved it.  It has a bite ( I only used 1 tsp chili powder) but just adds to the appeal of this dish.  A nice change from all the creamy chiken recipes.  Only 5 pts on weight watchers .

the sauce is great.  I only use one tbs of chilli powder and just a splash of hot sauce due to the kids in the house.  Very tasty stuff.  I served it with homemade bread (first attempt), the bread in the sauce is like heaven on earth....

This is by far one of my families all-time favorites! We didn't have stewed tomatoes so we used a can of whole tomatoes and diced them, then left a little of the juice out. Very good recipe!

Wow, this was absolutely delicious and everyone had seconds. Did not change anything in the recipe except a little less salt and chili powder in consideration of some family members' stomaches. I cannot imagine ever getting tired of it.

Made this today for the first time.  Vary good, but next time i'll cut back on the chili powder to 1 tsp., as two made it too spicy for my liking.  Added this to my recipe to make again.  Thanks for sharing.

this was delicious! Martin loved it. I made the sauce for 6 even though we only had 2 large chicken breasts and if was perfect. Really good sauce and the acidity means that the chicken is really tender. Changes I made:
1. Used glutenfree brown rice flour
2. I added garlic and onion when browning the chicken
3. used a larger can of tomatoes
4. added celery
5. only used half the chili powder
6. Added fresh parsley in the last 5 minutes.
7. added an extra half cup of water

followed directions to the letter, the chicken was very tender, the sauce was a bit too sweet.  I would add a pinch of hot pepper, and reduce the brown sugar.

Awesome Flavor! Instead of 1/2 cup water, I used 1/4 cup cooking sherry and 1/4 cup chicken stock...AWESOME! Next time, I'll cut chicken in chunks before cooking and serving.

We used italian diced tomatoes because it was all we had on hand. This was delicious! My picky eater didn't like the looks of the dish, but ate seconds. He told me the next day I should cook the same meal.

Great recipe.  My wife especially loved the flavors and my two young children also devoured it.

Like similar reviews, I added sliced onions, substituted 1/4 cup white wine and  1/4 cup chicken broth for the 1/2 cup water.  I also substituted 2 TBSP Balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  And cut the chili powder in half.

I changed nothing else.  Very easy and unique flavors.  Served over rice.

Tastes good, but 2 teaspoons of chili powder is far to much for the average family. Wife and kids couldn't eat it. Cut the chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon or double everything else and this would be a 5 star recipe.

Delicious!  I would use half the chicken and still make all the sauce; I wanted more sauce for my rice.  If you're in a hurry, I think you could skip the flouring & browning and still have it turn out well.  Going in my recipe box!

I was skeptical while cooking this. but it turned out great. I had a large fresh jersey tomato that I diced and added along with the can of stewed tomatoes. I also forgot the heat element (hot sauce) but it was delicious anyway!  since I added extra tomato I increased the brown sugar and white vinegar by one tbsp. I also used chicken broth instead of water as suggested by other reviewers and added extra.

Sorry, but this recipe did nothing for my taste buds.  I was intrigued by the variety of ingredients, since I like everything on the list. I made this with pasta on the side that just added to the confusion in my mouth.

I make this all the time, and even added a custom version to my recipe box.  I have made a few changes to this recipe on occasion....not because the original recipe was bad, but because I've adapted the recipe on the go depending on what ingredients I had available, to include making this with pork chops, or adding different vegetables to the sauce.  It is a wonderful, versatile recipe, and a family favorite for sure!!

YUMMY! We loved this! I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, and I used red wine for half the water. Everything else was as is in the recipe. Will be adding this to my "regulars".

Very good dish. I probably messed up on some ingredients because I had to reduce the amount of servings, that said it was too spicy for my husband and son. Then again, who cares! I loved it and plan on making portions just enough for me.

I also thought that this would be like bbq sauce, but it had some kick to it, and to me, it was lighter.  I tried this dish with dark meat chicken and another time with shrimp since we had leftover sauce.  The shrimp version was quite delicious.  I did add corn starch the thicken the sauce up the second time, and it worked out well.  I followed other's advice and added thinly sliced red and green bell peppers and onions to very good results.   This will definitely be a repeat.  O, used diced tomatoes with jalepeno b/c that was the only canned tomato we had on hand.

Very, very good.  So tender. Next time I'll use fresh quartered tomatoes because the stewed tomatoes have added sugar and were a bit too sweet. Definitely a make again recipe!

This was delicious. I forgot to add the water, but it was still good. Spicy just the way I like spiciness. I used chicken tenders as that is what I had defrosted, and served it with rice.

Even though the sauce was very yummy, I made the mistake of simmering the chicken for the amount of time the recipe called for. It came out WAY too over done, very tough and stringy. 

If I were to make this again I would only simmer the chicken for about 7-10 minutes after browning. Maybe reducing the sauce on it's own for 10 minutes before adding back the chicken.

I had had a similar recipe at a friends house and loved it.  I made a few changes - instead of stewed tomatoes, I used fire roasted tomatoes.  Added 1 onion and 1 large green pepper - chopped in bite size pieces. Used 1 cup wine instead of water.  Very tangy.  Also, cut chicken breast pieces in half. And doubled the ingrdients for more sauce.Served over brown rice.

Can't miss easy to make recipe with a very tasty sauce that has a slight bite that tells you it is there. Served with a side of sauced farfalle pasta and a loaf of Italian or French bread.

My husband and daughter thought it was very good.  I thought it was sweeter than I would have liked, in the nature of a sweet and sour dish.  What was interesting about this dish is I didn’t care for the smell of it as it was cooking so I was surprised it tasted better than I was expecting.

This was a good recipe, pretty easy to make. Left out the chili pepper and hot sauce for my kids and it paid off b/c they all ate it without complaint.  That's a good sign for our house!  I will make this again...

We loved this recipe with a minor tweek.  We did not cook our chicken breasts ahead in the flour/butter, but just cooked them in the stew.  Enjoyed it over brown rice.  Hubby said it was a definite recipe to repeat!

Absolutely delicious!! Very unique taste and as described by others, tastes like a Cuban or Hispanic seasoning.
Like another reviewer suggested added half of an onion in thin slices everything else exactly like the recipe.

Super easy, I admit I substituted vegetable oil for butter to avoid saturated fat, otherwise followed to the "T".  My family loved this. I think the mustard powder helps to give the chicken a lovely color, but I really could not identuify the taste of mustard in the finished product which I wondered about while preparing. I have a hard time making chicken breast interesting and this works well!  Thank you!

I made this pretty much as written, except I only made 2 chicken breasts, so there was plenty of sauce.  I did add a packet of chicken flavor boost. I wanted to serve it over rice, but was out, so I served it with mashed potatoes.   It was great!  My husband commented on how good it smelled while cooking, and said this is a do again - often!  Next time I might add onions - but it is so perfect without, maybe I won't!  Bottom line, easy to make, used ingrediants I had on hand, and tasted great!

Scrumptious!! I used yellow tomatoes from our garden, but otherwise followed the recipe. It has a very faint taste of BBQ, but is also reminiscent of Swiss Steak. We ate it with Arborio.

The sauce is delicious, deep, and rich. Perfect over rice. Big winner in our house because it is yummy and quick to prepare. I used Red Wine Vinegar instead of white. Also good with a diced onion in it.

Very good, and while cook time is a bit long, it's easy to make.  I recommend upping the amount of seasoning to ensure a fuller flavor.  Highly recommended!

Good, but not spectacular - a little bland for my tastes. However I think it would be a good dish for people looking for a dish that would satisfy the different taste preferences of a family.

This is actually a five star for me and my husband.  But becuse my two boys (10 and 11) didn't care for it, I deducted a little.  I cubed the chicken to make it easier to eat.  Added much more salt and pepper along with paprika and garlic salt.  Also used 1/4 c chicken broth and 1/4c white wine instead of water.  Will make again and add even more spice.  Overall, terrific!

This easy to fix chicken dish was very good.  The flavors blended nicely and it would go well with vegetables and pasta or potatoes.  I followed the recipe with two exceptions, I browned the chicken in a small amount of olive oil instead of butter; and secondly, based on other reviews, reduced the chili powder from two teaspoons to one.  This will be a recipe that we make again.

This was awesome! I didn't have mustand powder or celery seed, so made it without. And I used diced Italian tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand. The sauce turned out great and the chicken was very tender. Would be great over rice. Very easy, will definitely make this again!

We used fresh tomatoes (blanched, peeled, and diced) with basil, onions, and the dry ingredients for the sauce.   Simmered for 30 minutes or so to reduce, then did the chicken in a cast iron skillet to sear.  Added a bit of Marsala wine and some eggplant and mushrooms for added nutritional kick.  Was fantastic!  We can our own stewed tomatoes so this will be a great way to use up some of it!

Used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Served over mashed potatoes.  Excellent.  Easy, healthy, delicious.  A winner.  Thanks so much!

My husband kept saying mmmmmm good.  We served this with brown rice.  I think you could add anything you like to the sauce, next time it'll be onion slices for me.

As written, this recipe was WAAAAY too hot for our humble tastes (all 3 adults) and too vinegar-y as well.  Fortunately, I had a feeling to proceed cautiously when I made this recipe.  So I only put in 2/3 of the chile powder, skipped the hot sauce altogether and doubled the brown sugar to tone down the vinegar. That done, the tastes went together very well and this was a big hit with all of us,  served over basmati rice. Because my gang likes thicker sauce, I used my immersion blender just before serving to whirl the sauce thick and smoother.  Both my guys asked me to make this again.

This is a delicious meal. I have been making it for awhile now. Great over rice or noodles. I like to add mushrooms, onion and peppers. Substitute balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Thanks for sharing this flavorful recipe.

My husband and I loved this!  Instead of using bread to sop up the juices I made some couscous and it was fantastic!!  I also added a little bit more hot sauce for my husband's taste and it was still really good!  (And I don't like hot food!)  Will definitely be making this one again!  It reminds me of the food I had in France with my host family when I studied abroad, especially with the couscous!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was SO good! I did not have any hot sauce so I used crushed red pepper flakes instead. I might have use a little too much, as always, so it had a little more kick than it was probably intended to have. I was only cooking 2 chicken breasts so I added the rest of the can of stewed tomatoes to my rice with some onion and garlic salt. It was a great combo!

Husband (named Pierre - haha) loved it. I used 1/2 merlot 1/2 water and I omitted chili powder (none in the house). The vinegar was a bit overpowering, so I'll use 1 tbsp next time instead of 2. Very food recipe!

As suggested, I added green peppers and onions, doubled the sauce, and served it over rice.  The family enjoyed it, although my daughter commented that it needed even more vegetables.

Awesome! Excellent  taste. Followed others and combined marsala wine and low sodium soy sauce instead of water. added only 1/2 the salt. was a little salty, could be from the soy sauce. I also fried onions with the meat. Will definitely make again.

Sub white wine for water. I used two breasts slightly flattened and cut in half lengthwise but did not cut back on sauce. This is so easy and even my finnecky eater loved it. Spouse said you could sub thighs for the breasts.

Made this tonight according to recipe. Served over Brown Basmati Rice. Tasted it and knew it was great but too hot for my Husband so quartered a Russet potato I had to reduce the heat. Also used white wine as others suggested, sliced red onion and a sliced - up yellow pepper. Very good!

I made this last nite for dinner. The only changes  I made because I didn't have boneless chicken breasts, I used chicken tenders & instead of coating the chicken in flour, I used "pan searing flour" because it coats it lightly & the results are much better, & this is what restaurants use when making seafood so you don't get that thick pasty consistency. We loved the spiciness of it and it's a quick, easy, is done in one skillet & have all the ingredients in the house.  The sauce thickens to a nice consistency & I made rice with it and green beans.  It's fantastic & will definitely make it again!! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. I did add the onions. I had left over shrimp I needed to use so put that in the last 2 minutes. I tasted first, to give real review of the original and it got rave reviews. Shrimp would be awesome on its own with this sauce.  Will definitely make this again either method.

Absolutely amazing. I've made this twice for my family and both times they've LOVED it. The only change I make is instead of putting the flour mix into a bowl and dredging the chicken, I add it to a quart-sized freezer bag, add a breast, and shake (repeating for each breast). This gives a much more even coating.

Husband loves this one everytime. I use chicken thigh as I can cook it as long as I want without it going dry. Comes out very juicy!

Very good!!  Has a small kick to it.  We only used 3 chicken breasts but followed the rest of the recipe (did add half a sliced onion with the tomato mixture).  Next time, I would cut down the chili powder if I use less chicken again.

I really liked this dish but I thought it was just a tad too sweet as written. I will definately make this again but will either use diced tomatoes over stewed (sugar was listed as the 3rd ingredient!) or will cut back on the brown sugar. I should mention that I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have white vinegar so maybe that's where the extra sweetness came from.

Served with a garden salad and "Coconut Rice with Black Beans" (recipe from this site), and all was amazing. I only used 3 chicken breasts cut up, to allow for extra sauce to go over the rice.

This is a perfect recipe. The flavors in the sauce make finding a side dish super easy and as other people have mentioned, this basic sauce is perfect for minor tweaks to produce delicious variations. This was a huge hit with my kids.

I fixed this for supper tonight and it was so good!! Prepared just as written but didn't use hot sauce, don't care for spicy food, I did cut chili powder to 1 tbs. Next time I'll add some sauted onion, because love onions. I will make again!! Served it on top of wide egg noodles and had fresh steamed asparagus for side dish. UMMMM. Thanks

Amazing flavor! My husband doesn't care much for tomatoes, but he inhales this dish. Definitely one of my favorite quick fix meals. It's simple and I always have all the ingredients on hand.

This one was odd for me....my normally picky boys liked it so much they wanted the left overs for breakfast in the morning.....My husband liked it okay, and I was just okay with it as well.  Any recipe that wows my 5 and 7 year old boys like that has to stick around in my house though!

This was good! I added an onion, but otherwise kept it the same. Next time I'll try adding red wine like other reviewers suggested as I think that would've really rounded out the flavour. We'll definately be making this again!

This will be added to our rotation. My husband hates rice, but he gobbled it up with this. What a great and easy recipe. I had no celery seed so I left it out. I also used a little less chili powder since I didn't want it too spicy.

This  is very good.  I pounded out the chicken breast, halved the sugar (stewed tomatoes are already sweet) & used a potato masher on the s. tomatoes because my Husband & son prefer to not have large chunks of tomato.  It's great on rice, mashed potatoes or pasta.  Made it on the stove top & also in the slow cooker after browning the chicken.  Both equally nice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I used diced tomatoes since I don't like bell peppers which tend to be in the stewed tomatoes.  I would add more pepper while simmering.  I served over jasmine rice which a side of sauted fresh green beans.  It disappeared.

I really like this recipe as it is very different from my normal flavor pallette.  I do think it is too sweet so I cut the brown sugar (for less sugar I also used Splenda brown sugar).  I did a double recipe of the sauce to have plenty to serve over rice.

Lord, help me! I wish I could rate this higher. I just cut into a chicken breast and tasted a bite to see if it was ready after simmering for 40 minutes. It was delicious!!! I can see this becoming a favorite at our house. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  Used 1 teaspoon chili powder and diced tomato.  Also added green pepper and red onion to mixture when mixture started to simmer.  This reminds me of a dinner my mom use to make.

I substituted honey for brown sugar, diced tomatoes for stewed, and red wine vinegar for white, just b/c it's what I had on hand. Turned out fantastic! My family loved it and I served it over white rice. Will definitely make this again and again!

Not loving this dish.  My husband said it was confused...is it chili or a tomato sauce?  I cut the chili powder in half and it was still too much for me.  I expected so much more with all the high ratings.  It was like a barbecue sauce with chili powder.

Very good.  Made same amount of sauce as recipe but only 3 chix breasts.  Substituted olive oil for butter and home canned tomato sauce w/ onions & parsley for store bought canned tomatoes.  Liked that you drain chix breasts as it removed some oil on paper towel even though I only used 2 T to saute the breasts.  Served w/ boiled potatoes vs. noodles & had leftover rolls to sop up juices too.  Very nice blend of flavors & easy weeknight meal.

I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings following some of the side recommendations and some of my own judgment. I used broth over water but I stuck with the stewed tomatoes. I found the sauce a good balance of sweet and spicy. It was so yummy and definitely a keeper!

I am a convenience cook. Not very confident in my cooking ability, and want my meals to turn out right. This dish pleased me in both aspects the first time and each time since. I have used Italian Recipe Stewed Tomatoes, added Onion Soup Mix packet and this is fantastic. I have never used the flour, and have done both skillet and slow cooker and love how this dish is delicious EVERY TIME! Sincere thanks for the recipe and love the name, as it makes me sound so professional when my girlfriends ask what I'm making for dinner and I say, "Oh, just Chicken Pierre" and hear them ooh and ahh thinking it's more difficult than it is!

It was alright.. Definitely a different kind of flavour.  It's edible but the flavour was lacking.  I added a ton more garlic and 1 can of tomato paste to up the flavour.

This was really good!  I made this with beef broth, instead of water, because I had a carton already open in the fridge.  I also used a bit of cayenne, instead of the hot sauce, and added sliced onion and chopped red pepper.  I cut the chicken breasts into small cubes, before cooking, and served it over basmati rice.  Next time I would like to try skipping the flour part, and just cook the cut up chicken, and then add to the sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent dish. I added red wine and mushrooms and onions and served with rice. Great concept with unlimited variations. Good one.

I knew that was a winner when I took a brief sip of the sauce (before I had ever added the chicken) and realized that it was freaking delicious!  What a winner.  Im a sucker for slightly sweet sauces, too, so that was a plus.  As an added note:  We entirely forgot to get Wor...chestshire?  Whatever it's called.  Well!  We used soy sauce instead, and it was still delicious!  Just a little side note if you're low on...that other sauce.

I love this recipe so much. Making it right now for about the 10th time. I like a sweet sauce and this is very at least i think. Low fat was a key factor the first time i made it.

What a great recipe!  It is easy, and tastes fantastic!  The only changes I made, were cutting up the chicken into cubed before tossing it in the flour mixture, used crushed tomatoes, and I used 1/2 Chipotle chili powder and 1/2 regular chili powder.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I will be making this again, and again, and again....  Served it over basmati rice.  Thanks Nancy for the delicious recipe!!

I thought this was really yummy!  I actually varied the recipe a bit.  Instead of using whole chicken breasts, I cut them up into bite sized pieces and sauteed them this way.  Per a previous suggestion, I used chicken broth instead of water, and used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I also threw in a dash or two of Cumin for an additional flavor.  I also used plain canned diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  Served over a bed of pasta.  Came out wonderful!  Will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I made it in the crock pot and added chopped onion.  I really liked it.  The chili powder and hot sauce really made it great.

I've been making this recipe for at least four years and it's one of my absolute favorites.  It's super versatile.  I use white or red wine in place of the water (whatever I've got leftover from last night's dinner).  I have served with rice and egg noodles but having crusty bread on hand is key.  I usually throw in half a bag of frozen peas five minutes before serving and it is super.  I recommend for company as you can do most of the work ahead of time.  One more thing - I've browned the chicken and thrown the whole thing in the crockpot for the day and it works really well - super moist and such a nice thing waiting at home after a long day.

i can only give this 4 stars because i wasn't able to really taste it.  my boyfriend ate it before i could really give it a good tasting.  so it could be a 5-star easily.  BTW, he said it was the best thing i've ever made...hmmmm.  i took other people's suggestions, added onions, mushrooms and cut the chili powder in half.

Now this was a great basic meal recipe.  I did make quite a few tweaks based on some things that sounded good that other reviews had tried but I think the recipe would have been good as written as well.  My changes:
-Canned chopped tomatoes instead of stewed
-White cooking wine instead of water
-Red Wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar
-Added a handful of chopped multi colored peppers
-Onion powder since I didn't have any onion but I think onion slices would have been excellent

Everyone in the family loved this recipe. I made it exactly as written without any changes and it was delicious. I cut 4 chicken breasts in half (like a book) and I think the thin cut is what made it so yummy and tender. Thanks for this easy and tasty recipe!

Quick and easy for a homemade dinner!  Loved the flavor!  
My husband was surprised although I told him it wasn't Italian; I think he was expecting it to taste like your usually Italian red sauce.

Yummy!!! 
We eat heart-smart and very little red meat. I don't add salt, so I'm always looking for recipes with different seasonings and ingredients to add flavor. This was GREAT! It's definitely NOT another BBQ recipe!
The only change I made was using diced tomatoes(all I had on hand)and a small sliced onion. We ate it on rice and can't wait to try it on pasta next time.
Thanks for a very tasty recipe! Looking forward to serving this one often!

This is my favorite chicken recipe!  However, I do cut the chili powder down to 1/4 tsp (we are lightweights!) and omit the hot pepper sauce.  I CRAVE this recipe!

I thought this was really good. I liked mine over the french bread which made it soggy and I got to tastes all the flavors. My boyfriend liked his bread without the juices and he rather soak it up himself. Doesn't make sense to me but whichever way you like it, it's good! We loved it and I'll make it again.

This was very good.  The chicken was juicy and had good flavor and the sauce was real good too.  As many suggested, I reduced the chili powder by half and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also skipped coating the chicken in flour and just browned the breasts because that's the way we prefer it.  All in all it turned out really good.  Next time I'll probably add a little onion and a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.

I thought the sauce had great flavor.  I diced the chicken breasts, subbed chicken broth for the water and added sliced onion towards the end of the simmer time.  As one reviewer recommended, I put the stewed tomatoes in the food processor to avoid large chunks of tomato.  I'll definitely have this again!

This was different and good. Normally silent hubby said, "I like the flavor." He's stingy with the stars though, giving it a 3.5 (no recipe EVER gets a 5). I thought it was very good, especially for a different way to have chicken breasts. I did substitute chicken broth for the water and omitted the salt. I also used petite diced tomatoes, as I had no stewed tomatoes on hand. I halved the butter and instead used non-stick spray to coat the pan. This worked out just fine for browning the breasts. Lastly, about halfway through cooking, I felt the sauce was too thin so I added a half a can of tomato sauce (about 7.5 oz).  I made this again last night, the same way as before except this time I added onion and red pepper. I sauteed them in the butter before browning the breasts. Very delicious.

For braised chicken in barbecue sauce, this is quite tasty - but that's exactly what it is.  Braised chicken in barbecue sauce.  Still, braising the chicken makes it nice and tender, so that part was worth it.  I added onions after frying the chicken but before adding the tomatoes (which I would do again) and served it over pasta (which I wouldn't - the sauce isn't really strong enough to hold up to pasta - try rice instead).  Not sure I'll make this one again, but it has the benefit of being made from things that are usually hanging around anyway, so I might.

instead of adding hot sauce I added diced tomato with jalepeno for an extra kick and served over whole wheat noodles.  It definatly was a whole lot spicier than I thought it was going to be, but it was sooo good! and the extra sauce was great on the noodles.

Yummy!  My husband and I are dieting so I did a lower fat version--no breading, just seasoned the chicken breasts and sauted in a little olive oil and butter.  I also used petite diced tomatoes, substituted chicken broth for water, used spenda instead of brown sugar and added thinly sliced red onions and pepper strips (frozen).  Served over brown rice it was delicious and a very healthy, well balanced meal!

THIS WAS VERY GOOD. AS PER OTHER REVIEWS I ALSO CUT THE CHILLI POWDER IN HALF. I USED BROWN SUGAR SPLENDA TO CUT SOME OF THE FAT.  WEIGHT WATCHER POINTS ARE 5 POINTS AND SERVED WITH RICE AND STEAMED BROCCOLI THIS MAKES A VERY HEALTHY MEAL

Followed recipe exactly initially except used whole breasts. After fully cooked, I shredded the chicken into large chunks and put back into the sauce. We loved it. Subsequently added sliced mushrooms; red bell peppers and topped with capers when serving. This has quickly become a favorite.

Very good.  We had it last night and it disappeared.  I only added garlic powder to the flour & the tomatoes, and omitted the chili powder as I didn't realize I was out.  Very easy, liked it a lot.

Very enjoyable, and easy to prepare as a college student. (Not too expensive either. 10 dollars, assuming you have the sauces and spices already.) Made in less than an hour for myself and my roommate. Will add less of the juice from the stewed tomato, or else boil down the sauce so it's thicker. Also, I added several cloves of garlic, rather than just 2/3 of one clove.

This is one of the easiest and best chicken recipes I have ever made. I had everything but the tomatoes on hand. I used a doubke can of diced tomatoes, poured out the excess liquid (after measuring to the listed amount needed) and added the additional tomatoes. I also used wheat flour and olive oil for health reasons. I didn't have Worcestershire on hand and substituted low sodium soy sauce and terikaki sauce. I served the chicken over a bed of brown rice and made the sesame green beans from this site. I already have this one in my recipe box!!!

My family rated this between a 3 and 4 star.  I absolutely loved it, but the rest of my family said it was too spicey for them.  I would make again for my family, but would have to reduce the heat a bit for them to eat it.  If you have a sensitive mouth, reduce the heat and enjoy!

This was amazing! I think now in my top 5 for chicken recipes. I pretty much followed the directions exactly except for a little bit of cinnamon added in. I made this with the "Orzo with Mushrooms and Walnuts" recipe on this site and the two went together wonderfully.

Sorry this one wasn't for me. Too sweet and I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Overall a strange taste however, chicken was moist. Will not be making again.

Delicious. My family is not a fan of tomatoes and loved it.  Worcestershire flavor kind of overpowers, so maybe cut down a bit.  Other that that, it was easy and great.

This recipe was a surprise. I made it because I liked the name and I had all the ingredients at home. The surprise was that my really picky 6yo loves it. I've made it 3x and the family celebrates when I announce this is for dinner. My 10yo niece was over for dinner one evening and later asked her mom to make it at her house. She thought the it was fish because the meat was so tender so she calls this dish 'Chicken Mystery'. She said it tastes like pizza but I think it's more like a tangy BBQ. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

The celery seed gives this an interesting flavor. This was very simple to prepare and tasted good. It didn't take 30 minutes to finish cooking the chicken so I suggest to keep an eye on it so it doesn't dry out.

This is a very different dish.  It was good.  I doubled the sauce and added cream of mushroom soup to thicken the sauce to a gravy consistency.  Tomorrow I will add the sauce to pasta for lunch.

Wow, we loved it!  I used diced tomatoes and chicken tender pieces which cut down the cooking time.  Made enough for 2 of us but didn't half the sauce.  No reason to change a thing! I think the best thing about this recipe is that it's just a can of tomatoes, some on hand spices and it's cheap, healthy and original!

This was very good!  My Husband really liked it.  The stewed tomatoes made it seem a little sweeter than I would like so maybe I'll try plain whole tomatoes next time and cut them up.  It was easy to fix too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just made this tonight and it was wonderful! However, I did make it with a LOT of differences, only because I didn't have many ingredients on hand. I used diced tomatoes with basil/oregano/garlic, because I don't like the big stewed tomatoes that much.  I didn't have brown sugar, so just used white.  Substituted chicken broth for water for some extra flavor.  I also didn't have any flour, so just used a mix of italian bread crumbs, old bay, salt and pepper to coat the chicken.  I didn't have hardley ANY of the spices (at my dad's, all my cooking stuff is at home!), so just used the vinegar--apple cider--,sugar, and hot sauce. very good mix of flavors. kinda runny though. will make again soon!

This is one of my favorite recipes- I make it at least once a month.  I've tried different variations, including not breading the chicken, but I think it is best when following the recipe exactly!

This is my husbands favorite dish.  Don't be scared by the long list of ingredients, I have found that I will measure out and put all of the dry ingredients in an airtight bowl and the wet in another early in the morning.  When it comes time to cook- just open and pour, it saves a lot of time.  I have also made this like a fried chicken breast with the sauce on the side.  My husband likes this better because the chicken stays crunchy.  Just make the sauce in a small pan and let it simmer for 20 minutes.  I have served it with jasmine rice and egg noodles- both were great.  This dish has such a unique and delicious flavor.

Could have been better but was just too salty. I will try it again but without the salt and 1/2 the worcestershire sauce which is salty in itself. i also noticed another lighter version. I'm gona try that one.

Followed recipe exactly. The sauce and the tomatoes tasted ok on the chicken, but really did not go completely over as well as I had hoped. I was expecting the flavor to absorb into the chicken more during the simmering process, it actually absorbed into the tomatoes. The browning of the chicken probably prevented the chicken from absorbing more flavor. Served with white rice. Could possibly try again by upping the sauce about triple and putting it in the slow cooker.

Pretty good... I used chicken stock instead of water and reduced the chili powder to 1tsp (instead of 2tsp) for personal taste.  I didn't have celery seed so I used celery salt instead of reg salt.  My husband didn't ask me to make it again, but it was quick and easy.

I make this dish all the time. My husband and kids love it.  I also subsitute pork chops for the chicken.  I reduce the amount of chili powder to 1/4 t and leave out the hot sauce(the kids don't like foods that are very spicey)

I first started making this recipe a couple of years ago and my friends and family still love it!  I typically cook this in a large insulated wok.  I cut each breast into 2 or 3 large pieces and brown them in butter with the flour mixture.  In order to use this method, you must use a lot more butter, but don't worry - if anything it improves this dish.  I have been known to double the sauce or multiply it by 1.5 and serve chicken over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!  You can also add chopped jalepenos for extra kick.  This recipe is heavy, but oh so good.

I have made this several times to rave reviews.  This last time I did a "light" version and just cut up the chicken and baked it in the sauce mixture sans butter.  Still GREAT!  Served with hot rolls.  Yummmmm!!!

This is a huge hit in my house.  My husband is always asking me to make this dish for him.  I actually changed a few things after preparing this many, many times...I decided to add all the liquid to the pot and simmer the chicken the sauce.  The chicken comes out very tender and full of flavor.  I usually serve this over white rice and that's it!
Thank you for a great recipe!!

I had looked so forward to making this recipe and was disappointed when I finally did. Not to say it was bad, but it tasted like plain old BBQ chicken to us and required a great deal more effort.

VERY YUMMY. Didnt have celery seeds, but didnt seem to make a difference. I served with baked polenta, but this would be fantastic with rice or pasta to soak up more of the juices. Definately easy and a keeper.

My family loved the sauce.  I used crushed tomatoes instead.  I have decided to try and use this sauce to make cabbage rolls.  Yummy and sweet.

First sweet, then spicy... no wonder it's a 5 star recipe.  I used skinless bone-in chicken breasts and subbed the stewed tomatoes with petite diced, but left the remaining ingredients the same.  Served over fine egg noodles... Ooo-la-la Chicky Pierre!

Great Recipe!  I have made this several times and have not used boneless chicken breasts.  I sautee chicken pieces (dark) then mix the remaining incredients in a bowl and add to the chicken and simmer until chicken is done.  The meat is so tender that it practically falls off the bone.  I recently made this dish for a dinner party and had three requests for the recipe.

Good recipe with a nice kick.  I mixed the tomatoes, water, brown sugar, red vinegar(nicer flavor), salt, chili powder, mustard powder, garlic, and hot pepper sauce and let the chicken marinate in that for hours(didn't have celery seed or worcestechire sauce)then floured chicken and put olive oil in skillet and sauteed more garlic with some onions-then browned chicken on that and added all the liquid ingredients without removing the chicken.  Came out nice. I served over egg noodles.

Very good.  The sauce didn't infiltrate the chicken as much as I had hoped so next time I am going to try this in my slow cooker to see if that helps.

This recipe had a wonderful flavor.  It was not as spicy as I was expecting and since my hubby and I love spices and bold flavors, next time I will add more chili powder and probably add cayenne to give it more of a kick.  The sauce is excellent but there is just not enough of it to serve over pasta.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe because it just tastes so great!

I will definitely be adding this recipe to our rotation.  Some changes I made: I pounded the breasts thin between two pieces of plastic wrap.  I used two cans of stewed tomatoes, substituted red wine vinegar, doubled the amount of Worcestershire and vinegar (red wine), and brown sugar.  I also added approx. 8 oz. sliced mushrooms to the pan after I removed the chicken and sauteed those in about 1 Tbsp. olive oil for about 4 minutes.  Then I added the chicken back to the pan, and I only needed to simmer for 20 minutes.  The chicken was moist, tender, and had an absolutely delicious, very unusual flavor.  Loved it! My three boys all ate it, too--not too spicy for them since I didn't double the amount of chili powder.

Unbelievable! I thought I'd give this recipe a try because of all the rave reviews and I'm so glad I did! My husband who is incredibly picky and hates sauces on things agreed to give it a chance and he loved it! The recipe looks complicated, but it's actually quite easy. I strongly recommend trying the recipe as it is (with the exception of using a little more or less chili powder depending on your tastes). All the flavors blend together so well. Thanks so much for an excellent recipe. Will be making this regularly!

WOW! I *loved* this recipe.  The flavor is so interesting and just delicious.  I used about 7 chicken tenders and thought it was just enough sauce (even with my bigger can of stewed tomatoes), so to use 6 breasts, I think the would yield much too little sauce.  I followed the recipe fairly exactly, just cut out the chili powder and hot sauce (don't care for them).  I simply forgot the garlic, although I'm sure it would have made the flavor only better.  Thought the chicken turned out beautifully, very moist and flavorful.  Because I used smaller pieces of chicken, I only simmered about 30 minutes total, the last 10 mins uncovered so the sauce would thicken a little.  Served over pasta, which I thought was a fine compliment.

I wish I could give this 3 1/2 stars because it does have a great flavor.  I think I will make it again but without dredging the chicken in flour before cooking it.  I'm not too sure what to serve this with either because the flavor is slightly unusual.  It didn't go with french bread, and noodles or rice just sound icky with it so I'll have to experiment on this one.  I would recommend trying it though as it has great flavor.

Quick to make and pretty tasty. My boyfriend does not cook but I was busy tonight so I picked the recipe, set out  the ingredients and he was in charge of the rest. It was tasty - we ate it with crusty french bread which was perfect. I don't think it will taste very good over pasta because it was a really sweet sauce, like a bbq sauce almost. Great for a weekday dinner. That's why it gets a 4. Wouldn't serve it to guests or anything.

This is really good.  I accidentally used 2T chili powder instead of 2t, and I don't regret the goof.  Used half white and half balsamic, and 1 can of stewed and 1 can of diced tomatoes.  Husband and 10-year-old loved it as well.

A little different, but really good. The only things I changed were cubing the chicken instead (cooking in margarine not butter), using celery flakes instead of seeds, dijon mustard instead of powder and petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. We ate this over thin spaghetti, and it was a fairly easy dinner, especially with no produce to cut!

I have made this a number of times and my husband actually requests this as he really likes it.  I do, however, put the stewed tomatoes in a food processor and chop them up completely as we are not big tomato fans in our house!  This is actually one of the few recipes on this site that I actuallymake time and time again and have put into my "rotation" so to speak.

This was edible, but not nearly as good as I expected. My boyfriend hated it. The first few bites were good, then it had a weird after taste.

Don't let the picture fool you!!  The photographer took a picture of "cubed" chicken breast pieces, however if you follow the recipe you serve them whole.  The sauce in this recipe is delicious!  The reason I'm only giving it four stars is because after simmering the chicken breasts only 33 minutes, they were well done and pretty dry.  My husband says maybe I browned them too long, I will try again.

Excellent.  Will make again!  I cut it down to 2 chicken breasts and halved everything in the sauce.  When I make it with all 6 breasts, I'll double the tomatoes.  I also omitted the celery seed and substitued a tsp of yellow mustard for the mustard powder, because I had neither in my cupboard.

This recipe was pretty good. I would change the stewed tomatoes for diced. Also if you only simmer for 25 minutes your chicken will still be really juicy and tender. It was a very interesting flavor.

Great recipe - quick easy preparation!  I used olive oil/garlic powder with no impact on taste.  Next time I'll add a little cream and serve on pasta.

The sauce was very, very good for this recipe - but next time I will put the raw chicken with the sauce directly in the slow cooker. Didn't like the effect the coating and browning had on the dish at all.   This sauce would also be very good for meatballs.  Will use again - but with changes.  Thanks for the sauce idea.

This is a great recipe!  One of the best chicken recipes I have ever eaten.  Preparation is extremely easy.  I freeze a second serving of this when I make it so I can cook it again.  Just mix the tomato mix and place in freezer bag, put the chicken in a freezer bag, and the flour and the butter in separate snack sized bags, then when ready to make it just pull it out and thaw and cook as directed.
I have read that some people don't like this which absolutely shocks me, I guess you either love it or hate it.  It makes a lot of sauce which is what the french bread is for, I could see serving it over pasta.  
PS. My children who do not like really spicy stuff, all loved this, of course we are from the south west and they are used to lots of mexican dishes. I think the pan browning seals in the juices so it is nice and tender.  I serve just the chicken portion to the kids without a lot of the sauce.

Wow!  No wonder there were so many great reviews.  This is easy, different and very flavorful.  My picky husband & 7 year old loved it.  I will definitely make it again and recommend anyone trying it.  I didn't put in celery seed because I didn't have it.  I served it over rice and I cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  It came out so tender!

This recipe adds a change of pace from regular chicken recipes. I used canned organic stewed tomatoes, and substituted balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar for extra flavor. Yum!!

I did the same as a previous reviewer and put off making this for a while, but wish I would have made it sooner!  This is absolutely fabulous.  If you like a combination of strong tastes and spice, you will love this recipe too.  In every bite you can taste all the different flavors that went into it from the celery seed to the mustard powder.  I think the people who are giving it poor reviews just aren't prepared for that.  I started making this about a half hour before my husband came home from work and when he walked in the door he was already raving on how great it smelled.  He continued his praise when he finally took a bite.  We also think this might be good with pork, so we're going to try that soon.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe instructed was adding more hot pepper sauce.  I use Frank's Red Hot and I love the stuff, so I think I added 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1/8.  I will definitely make this again and pass it around to others.  Thanks a bunch for this winner of a recipe, Nancy!

Very Good! Made exactly as stated except cut back on chili powder to 1 tsp and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. The only thing I'll do different next time is to add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it, and perhaps top each breast with a slice of swiss or provelone cheese prior to serving. Very nice dish! Almost a 5 star!!

For me, this recipe gets a 5 star rating because it worked well and tasted good exactly as written. The changes I made when I did it the second time were only to suit my family size and use what was on hand. I did try it with 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of stewed(I prefer smaller chunks of tomatoes)as suggested by others but found that it thinned out the flavor of the sauce a bit. The chicken was tender. (I only used four pieces for this family of 2 and a 19 month old) I served it over rice and my husband loved it. I used red wine for the vinegar and only 1 1/4 tsp chili powder as that is all I had left. It was still wonderful and I did not feel that there was too much competition for flavor with all the powerful spices used. This is a definate keeper as is. I wonder if this would double well for company.

What a disappointment. After all the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try this. I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't good. I can't even put my finger on why it was bad, except perhaps to say that all the different spices and flavors competed with each other, instead of complementing one another, and ended up a big unsavory mess. My partner said, "If you want to tweak this--" and I interrupted him to ask "Why bother? There are so many good chicken-breast recipes out there."

YUMMY!  I took the advice of others and used balsamic vinegar instead of the white vinegar.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with onions, green peppers, and celery (same ingredients as the stewed tomatoes).  I also cut the chicken up and then served over bow-tie pasta -- what a unique dish!

This recipe is fabulous and easy. I've already made it 4 times and will continue to use in our rotation.  I ran out of white vinegar one time and had to use apple cider vinegar. It really changed the flavor - stick to the white.

This recipe took awhile to prepare but the final product was delicious.  The chicken was tender and packed with flavor.  I added an extra can of tomatoes. A little bit salty- I'll skip the salt next time around.  Husband loved it!

AWESOME recipe!  I really liked the sauce and think it would go really well with shrimp and scallops.  Also, I reduced the recipe to 2 chicken breasts and it was still great!  Its kind of sweet and sour at the same time!

I think that it was a great recipe!  I think that next time i will cut the chicken breasts up into cubes, add another can of stewed tomatoes, and use the chicken broth instead of water as many others have suggested.

Delicious- makes the chicken so moist and flavorful! Since there are just 2 of us and we like alot of tomatoes, I only used 2 chicken breast halves to 1 can of tomatoes. I halved the remainder of the ingredients which I think kept it from being too sweet and left out the chili powder and hot sauce since I didn't have any. I also tried this with venison in place of the chicken and it was fantastic!

This was absolutely delicious!  of course I added half a chopped white onion, and half of a chopped red pepper.  I didn't have mustard pwder so i used half the amount of prepared mustard, and a dash of A1 sauce in place of trhe worchshire sauce.  Also didn't have hot sauce so used a dash of cayenne pepper.  came out DELICIOUS.  gave some to my next door neighbor and he LOVED it as did everyone in my household. will definately be making again.  served over white rice.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would in an instant....And it is still on the stove! What a great and unique flavor. Never would have guessed it would have been this good. I cannot wait to hear the rave reviews from the family once this hits the table. Great stuff. Try it.

My husband and I thought this was fairly good but not great.  I pounded and cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces and added onion powder, garlic powder and finnes herbes to the flour before breading.  Good thing, it definitely neede the flavor.  The "sweet-tart-bbq" tasting sauce didn't knock our socks off.  Lots of work for an okay dish.  I may make it again just because the ingredients are readily available.  Definitely add onions.  I can't imagine the dish tasting half as good without the 1/2 sliced red onion I put in there.

This was "okay" -- not "restaurant fare" and I wouldn't serve this to company.  I have never even had anything like this in a restaurant.  Definitely a "home-cooked meal".  There are better "sweet and spicy" recipes out there.  It was fine for a weekday meal. I made it with 1/4 wine, 1/4 water in place of the 1/2 cup water as reviewers said.  The chicken was wonderfully cooked through and my kids (age 4, 2) liked it (and ate all their chicken sans sauce).  I personally didn't like that sauce.  Strangely sweet.

I knew I had hit pay dirt when my husband spontaneously said this was really good.  I did make a goof and thought I was following some of the other reviewers advice and used red wine vinegar.  I thought it was too vinegary and then I realized that the suggestion was to use red wine, not red wine vinegar.  None the less, it was still quite good and I will make it again (this time with plain ol red wine!)

This was great, my entire Family loved it. The next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar just to make it less sweet. Will try it with more spice the next time.

I made this for a dinner party. The flavor was different and it was tasty. I was not really to my personal taste, but my husband and our guests enjoyed it. I doubled the sauce as well. I will pass his on and I may make this again if requested.

Not much to be said except I loved it!  It was so very easy to make and so good to eat.  If you want it a bit zippier you can up the hot pepper sauce a wee bit.  Taste as you add as it can become spicy very quickly.  For those novice cooks looking for a simple chicken recipe, this is one to try!

Really good.  I added zin wine for part of the water, more garlic, a can of tomato sauce, cut-up green onion and it was exactly to my taste. It probably would have been good with beer instead of wine, but I didn't think of it until too late.   I recommend this terrific, pretty fast way to use chicken breasts.

This is wonderful! I used white wine for half the water, 1 1/2 t. chili powder, & just a couple shakes hot sauce. We don't put it over rice or pasta; we just cut the chicken up on our plates & pour the sauce over. Also used diced stewed tomatoes. Didn't bread the chicken either, just browned in light butter. I especially love how this recipe is healthy & tasty!!! Thanks so much.

FABULOUS!!!  This is such an amazing chicken recipe ~ my husband and I loved it!  It's even better the next day as leftovers.  I'll be making this one over and over again!  I did add extra chopped garlic and spices but everything else stayed as is.  Can't rave about this one enough!

Wow!  This had great flavor!  The only thing I did differently was I omitted the salt and used celery salt instead of celery seed.  Since the breasts I used were pretty thick, I turned them halfway through cooking..turned out perfectly, served over egg noodles.  Will make again!

It took me a little while to prepare this, perhaps because it was my first time. But it was every bit worth the wait.  I fixed it for my boyfriend and I and we both agreed it was delicious.  I would reccomend this to all my friends and family and will definitely prepare it again.

Absolutely delicious! I smashed the breasts before cooking for uniformity.I put leftovers in separate dishes with some sauce -it tasted even better the second time around!! 3/18/03 Sauce was a bit loose so I eliminated the water-could always be added at end if necessary.Have made this many times-always great response!!

This recipe was good, and it had a sweet taste to it.  I thought it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it was a good recipe.  I would reduce the celery seed by half because I thought it left an after taste.

What a great recipe! The chicken was flavorful and moist and the sauce was delicious.I did add onions and mushrooms to the sauce, omitted the water and cut the sugar in half. I served this with rice and green beans and there were no leftovers! Next time I need a barbecue/tomato sauce, I will use this recipe and let it simmer for an hour or two. Thanks Nancy!

This is a quick and easy chicken dish to prepare.
My family loved it.  I put all the sauce ingredients in the blender until smooth.  (left out the hot pepper sauce and the 1/2 cup water) Uncovered pan the last 10 minutes to thicken up the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.  I will make it again, soon.  Thanks Nancy.

This was fabulous.  I used the thin sliced chicken breasts, the cutlets, and cut them in half before breading, so the pieces were smaller.  I one and a halved the sauce, and I elimiated the water, as was suggested, and added 1/2 can of Rotel Tomatoes, drained, and elimated the hot sauce!!!!  Served over NO YOLK Noodles w/ a salad, and there were NONE left here!!!!  Very easy to make!!!

A nice little change the whole family enjoyed. A little less tomatos, a little more spices, and it's perfect in my opinion! A definite 5 star for the whole family.

This is a very tasty dish! I used diced tomatoes with garlic instead of the stewed tomatoes and I left out the hot sauce. I served it with steamed rice and it turned out very nice.

What a great change! I did use Balsamic vinegar and white wine instead of water and used 2 cans of tomatoes. I also only used 1 tbs. of brown sugar. My husband loved it and we had it over some leftover angel hair pasta...no kids so can't comment there. We highly recommend!

This is really a great dish.  My recommendations: use balsamic vinegar in place of white vinegar and use only 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  Next time, I will use red wine in place of the water (but this was still very good with the water).  I omitted celery seed because I did not have any.  Makes a very flavorful and healthy dish. I highly recommend.  Serve with white rice.  Blackeye peas make a nice side dish.

MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I ADDED MUSHROOMS, ONIONS, AND GARLIC TO THE SAUCE..ALSO USED RED WINE INSTEAD OF WATER AND A MIX OF BALSAMIC AND RED WINE VINEGARS, FOR THE DISTILLED VINEGAR. NEXT TIME I'LL USE ANOTHER CAN OF THE TOMATOES..THE SAUCE WAS SO GOOD, COULD OF USED MORE!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe tonight. I followed some suggestions- wine not water, 1T sugar, wine vinegar not white. I only used 4 breasts- plenty of sauce. I used 1t celery salt not salt and celery seed. I didn't put in the pepper sauce either-small children. They loved it. I will use this regularly.

this is a great recipe...my boyfriend normally doesn't eat tomatoes and he actually ate all of them!...this is a fast recipe b/c most of the time consists of just letting it simmer..i took other people's advice and (1) used less butter, (2) used red wine for water, (3) used red wine vinegar for balsamic, (4) added veggies, and (5) doubled the sauce...i'll definitely make this one again!!...thanks, nancy! =)

Tasty and quite different from my usual chicken dishes. I added red pepper flakes and balsamic vinegar as a few folks suggested. I think next time I'll back off a bit on the amount of red pepper flakes (I over did them, I think) and I might also cut back on the Worcestershire. But all in all this was a darn good meal. We'll definitel have it again.

This was a delicous pan o' poultry!  Moist and flavourful, it was gone in minutes last night.

My alterations:  plum tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions.  I went with a previous reviewer's suggestion for the red wine/water and balsamic vinegar/white vinegar;  both worked very well.  I may up the spice intensity the next time... overall, a fantastic and easy dish!

THIS IS EXCELLENT!  It is so quick and easy and the chicken is so tender and juicy.  We all loved this, even my picky husband and teenage son.  I used apple cider vinegar, honey instead of brown sugar and I didn't drain the tomatoes.  I will definately make this again.  This should be in the top 10!  Thanks!

This chicken was really good.  It makes a great sauce, and the chicken is really juicy.  I made it for the first time for company, so I'll admit that I was nervous.  We loved it!  I'll try it with pork chops next.  Thanks, Nancy!

My aunt made this one night while I was visiting and I loved it!  I came home and made the recipe and came out just as great (and I'm a horrible cook).  I'm not big into spicy foods, so I cut down a little bit on the hot spices.  It's the best chicken dish I've ever had.

This was a wonderfully aromatic dish with just the right blend of spice and savory.  It was easy to prepare, and went over very well with white rice and a salad of mixed greens.  I substituted merlot red wine vinegar for the white vinegar, and used diced stewed tomatoes.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Thank you!

AWESOME!  So easy, flavorful and delicious!  It is easy to manipulate the amount of spices to control how hot it is.  If you love tangy, flavorful recipes, then try this!

Enjoyed this but was not spicy enough for me - perhaps as I lacked some of the spices. Tried to adjust accordingly . Would still make it again also added red green pepper and onions

Amazing even though breast meat is definitely not my favorite. Juicy and full of flavor. I plan to try the sauce with other meats as well. A keeper for sure.

Delicious sauce, I did double that part because I have a “saucy” family. I took the advice of some others and used white wine in place if the water. I will also say that my cooking time was about 15-20 minutes once I put it bs

This was simply outstanding.  There are chicken recipes, and then there are CHICKEN recipes - that standout and grab you.  I added onions and red bell pepper and some fresh mushrooms - and This grabbed me.  Served on angel hair.

LOVE this recipe. I did make a couple of changes because I was looking to use what I had in the pantry and not shop. I substituted a can of peeled diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes. I used a couple of squirts of Sriracha (rooster) sauce because we ran out of hot sauce. Also, I placed the chicken breast halves into a zip bag and smashed them a little with a Mason jar. This will become a regular in our rotations.

I love this recipe! It's easy, I usually have the ingredients on hand and my family loves it too! :) Very simple to prepare, especially if you measure everything out ahead of time. 

And it tastes out of this world! I don't know why some people have a problem with the stewed tomatoes.  I think they are perfect in this recipe. I can't even imagine plain diced tomatoes in it, too boring.

Delicious, fast and easy. The only change I made was to use a large can of fire roasted tomatoes and adjusted the hot sauce to our taste.  The ingredients are things I normally have in the house so I didn't have to run out and get anything. Next time I will pound the chicken  so they are a more uniform size as others suggested.  An absolute keeper, thanks for a great recipe.

I felt that this was super flavorful for not such a high fat recipe. I used three huge chicken breasts. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Chicken broth instead of water and cut the chili powder back to one teaspoon.

I wasn't going to add yet another review, but this is "that good!". The only change I make was to use fire roasted tomatoes, and olive oil vs butter, but have no problem using either.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing, and we have this pretty often.  I serve with Vigo yellow rice, which goes well with the sauce.

I really wanted to like this  but it was just okay. I followed the recipe except for a few extra shakes of the hot sauce but it was still bland. Giving it three  stars was probably too much. Sorry,  but I expected a flavorful dish with all those spices. Most of the taste came from the stewed tomatoes. I won't be making this again. It isn't even tweak worthy.

One of my go to recipes!  Very easy to assemble.  I use half the amount of chili and I use a tbsp of butter and olive oil to saute the chicken. I also use fire roasted diced tomatoes for some more flavor.  Very tasty recipe!!

I made this last night and served it over angle hair pasta. It turned out delicious. The only change I made was to double the sauce and added more garlic and diced onions.

I thought it was just a little on the sweet side. But the fact that I couldn’t get a picture before it was gone means my family thought otherwise. Served it with egg noodles and sautéed green beans. Great quick and easy weekday dinner.

I served this to my fussy spouse, who rarely comments more than saying 'this is good', but in this case, he said, "This is so good, we can have it for company"!! I have since done so and everyone raves about how yummy it is. The best part is that it's soooo easy to make.

I made this the other night for my sons family.  It was a big hit.  The only thing I did different was cut up the chicken after I browned it.  Added a little extra spice to the flour to brown the chicken.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to make.  Thank you very much for the recipe.

Good meal. Might be a bit spicy for some but you can adjust the amount of spice you add. Would also be good with mushrooms in the sauce.

This is so easy to make and really delicious. I will say I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and it was plenty sweet for us. Also, I thickened the sauce with a small amount of corn starch to serve over the chicken. I served it with roasted cauliflower and sweet potatoes. It was a nice combination. Enjoy!

This  chicken recipe went beyond anything I have ever tried. 
I wasn't really sure what to expect. It was a trendous got with my husband. Only thing he wanted more tomatoes sauce concoction he called it. He kept racing about the chicken how delicious it was.
We have thirteen dogs and we usually feed them the left overs. Not this time he said.
The chicken was so absolutely tender. We loved it. Thanks Gj

We've made this multiple times now. As written it is a fantastic use of a cut of meat no one in my house really likes - the ever boring boneless skinless chicken breast.  This recipe actually turns it into something good.  4 stars as written.  ------  We modified to our own preferences, and switching to bone in, skin on chicken really makes this a stand out recipe. The nutrients from the skin and joints really makes the sauce thick and flavorful. Finished with truffle oil salt and you have a holiday worthy meal.

Awesome on veggies! Less brown sugar next time. Also I didn’t have the celery seed but it still tasted great.

Very good recipe. Unusual Mix of flavors. I was in a hurry so I threw everything in the crockpot on low for 4 hours. Everything was moist and fall apart tender. Good with rice or pasta.

Used double the tomatoes, half the salt & half the hot spices, plenty hot. Great flavours! Served with angel hair pasta. Added asparagus to top of sauce last 10 mins to steam.

I have now made this twice. The only modifications were mainly due to my wife requiring a FODMAP diet so needed gluten free flour and no garlic or Worchestershire sauce and since she does not like spiciness I also left out the hot pepper sauce.  However, I did add Italian seasoning to the flour mixture before coating the chicken.  It still had a wonderful taste of seasoning despite these changes. Also, because the tomato sauce did not fully cover the chicken breasts in the pan I flipped the breasts halfway through the cooking.  The recipe called for 35 to 40 minutes of simmering  which is too long. I had very thick breasts and the first time I simmered them for 35 minutes and the temperature was 190° but the chicken was not dry or  seemingly over cooked. The second time I simmered them for just 30 minutes and their temperature was still 185° but again they still were moist and not tough even though I had not pre-brined them.  Next time I think I will go with 25 minutes or else take their temperature in 20 minutes.  If they are cooked to just 165° I am sure they will even be far more moist and less dry.  All in all, however, this is one of the best chicken breast dishes I have ever tasted and not needing to pre-brine them certainly saves a lot of time.

I've made this dish several times and my family absolutely loves it! Another reviewer suggested omitting the additional water. I've made it both ways and I prefer it without the added water. Regardless, the dish always has great flavor. 

I hate cooking but I find this recipe easy to follow. I've made it using chicken breast, thighs, or drumsticks - it's versatile for whatever I have on hand or whatever is on sale.

As the chicken simmers, I make rice. A few minutes before the chicken is done, I add fresh or frozen green beans to round out the meal. Thank you!

made this last night over bow ties. besides using "cayenne pepper" instead of chili powder (have to learn to keep them two apart)it was rather tasty. the only OTHER thing i would have done different, was not coat them, since it falls off anyways

Delicious! I made a few personal changes. I had to cut my raw chicken breasts in half, because they were so dang thick.  So, I ended with 6 pieces. Instead of water, I added 1/2 cup of white wine and I used canned diced tomatoes. Only 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon of hot sauce. I also sliced 1 small onion. Amazing! Chicken came out sooooo soft. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe makes the best sauce!!! Only thing I did additionally is that I pounded my chicken flat then dredged it in the season flour. Made for super tender chicken with an amazing sauce. Served it with jasmine rice.

I've made this a couple of times because my husband loves it.  I don't eat much meat so skirted  around the chicken but the sauce has a wonderful flavor.  The only "changes" I made is that I reduce the salt and the chili pepper.  Definitely will make this again.

I made this tonight I only had 3 thick chicken cutlets to use so I made it exactly as the directions state minus 3 cutlets I cooked the chicken first in the skillet with butter and without draining or patting the cutlets dry I added the tomato compote to the skillet and sautéed it for 40 minutes. It turned out delicious. I will it again

This was very delicious, and a very tasty sauce indeed. My only complaint is this recipe is too salty. This is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Next time I make it (it was that good!) I am going to omit the 1/2 tsp of salt that it called for and use low sodium diced tomatoes. Really enjoyed this dish. Goes great with wild rice and spinach.

This turned out to be quite good - not exactly a barbecue sauce,  as one reviewer suggested, but still very nice for a change.  I used diced tomatoes and cooked them for about 10-12 minutes to cook the tomatoes down before adding the chicken breasts back in, because my daughter-in-law has an issue with the texture of tomatoes; otherwise I followed the recipe.  She even said she would like me to make them again!  My only caution is to check your chicken often while cooking - mine was at 160 degrees after 30minutes, so check often, or you might have the dreaded “rubber chicken “.  Thank you for a nice addition to my dinner options!

My family loved this!!!  I used diced tomatoes with garlic basil and oregano, and kind of squished them up since my husband isn't a huge fan of big chunks, but other than that, the only change I made was by not adding the additional salt.   We ate this with smashed skin on potatoes and green beans, and I swear I wanted to just drink the sauce...I may have to double it next time!!!

This is an excellent recipe! My picky Cuban husband loved it ?? So few recipes are spot on and, this one I really did not need to tweek at all. My whole family loved it. It is definitely, a keeper. Only thing I would change is, you do not need to use paper towels to drain chicken once it is done being browned. Just place chicken in a baking dish and set aside covered with foil, while you start the steps for the sauce. I did not have distilled white vinegar so, I used white wine vinegar instead and it turned out fantastic. I decided not to add the hot pepper sauce until I blended all the other ingredients and, as the sauce was boiling, it smelt kind of spicy in flavor so, I opted to not add the hot sauce after all. The dish was not spicy at all and was so delicious. I think next time I will try it with the hot pepper sauce but, to be honest with you, the hot pepper sauce could remain optional. It didn't make or break the recipe. There was plenty of sauce for all of the chicken so there was no need to double the recipe for the sauce. A lot of times recipes leave you short on the sauce. Not this one. I'm French and Italian and my husband is Cuban. So, we love our garlic. I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It is perfect as is but if you like green olives throw them in because, for me, they are the icing on a glorious cake!  I also liked the addition of cubed yellow or red peppers!

I would not change a thing  with the recipe, but  the sauce needs to be doubled. The spices are spot on. My family prefers chicken tenderloins  and Instead of the stove top, I choose to bake at 350 for approx. 40 minutes. The sauce is outstanding, and if I were 30 years younger a big loaf of buttered Italian bread dipped in the sauce...Ahhhhhh. Thank You for Sharing

I made it exactly as written. The only thing that I needed to adjust was the cooking time. It definitely didn't need to simmer for 35 minutes... maybe 15, tops. Delicious and my daughter asked if we could add this to our "Keep this Recipe" book! She loved the sauce!

Followed the recipe pretty much to a tee. I thought it turned out really good. I would add the sauce was great! Would maybe add some fresh basil. Also with some mozzarella would make a great chicken parm.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I did follow the recommendation of one review and doubled the sauce because it is sooo good.  I served this over black rice. It WILL be on our regular dinner rotation.

This is such a versatile sauce.!  I have made it with chicken and with pork chops and both were delicious!  My son asked me if I wrote this recipe down so we could have it again.  Next I am going to try using this sauce as a base for swiss steak.   I did omit the salt. It was not needed.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Good addition to the weeknight rotation.   Per other reviews, I pounded out the chicken breast, added 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of the water and added a small sliced onion.  Omitted celery seed since I didn't have any.  Didn't serve with any starch to save carbs and served with a salad.  No leftovers, yum!

Delicious unique favour. I served it over rice and it was an instant hit. I left out the hot pepper sauce, just to accommodate my family's tastes. Will be making it again for sure. My partner said it was like something that you would get at a really expensive restaurant. Try this for dinner tonight!

Whole family liked. Made exactly as written although I didn't measure very exact. Sliced 3 fat chicken breasts in half their width, thinner cook faster. Took advice and used red wine for half the water (and I don't have celery salt).

Very nice dish with great exotic Latin flavor.
Next time I think I'll put in some olives and mushrooms and a little cumin to take it up a few notches.
Definitely a keeper.
Thanks

My go-to main dish when having guests over for dinner.
I always get rave reviews.

Delicious!  Next time, in addition to a whole 14.5oz can of stewed tomatoes, I will add an additional can, but strained, so I can have more tomatoes in the dish.

Delicious... I double the amount of sauce- just a personal preference.

Love this recipe!  I love that its a 1 pot dish and so easy.  I didn't change the seasoning but used fire roasted diced tomatoes and cut back on the brown sugar.  I think the sugar could have been eliminated altogether since the fire roasted tomatoes added a huge depth of flavor.  I doubled the sauce and added sweet onion and red and yellow bell peppers at the end.  Big hit!!

Good, easy meal. I didn’t have stewed tomatoes so I made a pasta sauce. I split the breast because I don’t like it thick. It was delicious!  Also I omitted the celery seed because I didn’t have any. Overall one of the easiest dishes to make.

I will make again; only change would be less hot sauce and chili pepper.  My wife thought the chicken was slightly seasoned on the hot side.  She ate it without repercussions. I personally thought it was excellent.  Meal included, roasted asparagus and pasta.

When you’re hungry and you almost have the ingredients in the pantry, and when you’re in the gulf you need to have a variety in cooking chicken! It’s a hit! Love the sweet and spicy and sour taste. Thanks for sharing

Delicious, quick and packed with flavor! I took other reviewers' advice and added some onion and mushrooms. Only used half the amount of chili powder and it was plenty (even for my husband, who tolerates much more heat than I do). As my husband said, "this recipe is a keeper."

Very good tasting sauce! I had a bit of trouble with the chicken sticking to the pan, so I’ll look into fixing that next time.

Excellent.  Made this for the first time.  Smash hit with the family.  As some suggested, I sauteed onions and added green peppers.  It was amazing.  (I didn't have red or white wine, so stuck with water this time).  Will definitely try it with the wine another time.

A quick and easy delicious meal served with rice.  Makes great leftovers too.  The chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was so good over rice and sopped up with some crusty bread as someone else mentioned.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes in my pantry, so I just used a can of diced tomatoes.  I'm  going to keep this recipe handy since it's quick, easy to make, and so tasty.

My teenagers would not eat this.  They said it was too tangy which may have been the vinegar.  They aren't picky eaters and love chicken so I was surprised.  My husband and I thought it was okay.

Delicious!  I used 3 chicken breasts and made enough sauce for 6 so I'd have lots to put on top.  I used a little less butter, and chopped tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  I'll definitely make this again.

Hands down -super easy super flavorful go to meal. This is one of those "add what you think sauces". I listened to other reviewers and added their thoughts to my recipe and WOW. Husband loved it (saw him lick his plate). Chicken was juicy - tender- delicious. I am so happy with this recipe idea. THANK YOU!!

Easy to make and kids liked it.  I will cut the sugar back a touch next time and I only used diced tomatoes not stewed.  I did hunk substituting olive oil for the butter when browning the chicken would not change the outcome served it with rice but I think mashed potatoes would work too.

Made as directed. Delicious! Served with green beans and white rice made with chicken broth. Chicken-sauce-rice was great combo. Chicken itself was not too spicy, but the sauce had a good kick to it. This one's going in the book.

Very tasty and moist.  I used rotel tomatoes bec. I didn't have stewed on hand.  Added a little kick which we liked.
Served with mash potatoes, rice would also be good.

This sauce reminded me of the tomato chutney I made  last year - it has a rather strong, very recognizable flavor.  I like it, but I find that a little of that flavor goes a long way.  My husband loved it, but he isn't writing the review ;).  The chicken was very tender and juicy cooked this way, and if you like vinegar flavor, you will like this dish.  I had no celery seed, so I chopped up fresh celery very fine and added it.  I don't think that changed the recipe

Recipe was delicious.  Added sauted onion, subbed chicken broth for the water, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned (was all we had), and served this with spagetti squash and spinach.  A+!

This was so good! I added a yellow pepper, a jalapeño, and 1/2 onion to skillet, deglazing with a 1/2 c. wine instead of water. Used a can of Cento tomatoes and simmered to thicken. Amazing!

Left out chili pepper because I didn't have any.  Prep was easy enough for a simple cook like me.  Excellent taste.  Will make this again.

I did use chicken thighs instead of chicken breast only because we prefer them. Otherwise, we loved it just the way it was! I will definitely add to my favorite chicken recipes and have it often.  Can't wait to have it for guests. Thanks

I made this as dish by the recipe (o.k. I doubled the amount of chili sauce...I like a bit spicy...and I used Brummel & Brown margarine). Other than that, I followed exactly. It is super easy and super tasty. I will absolutely make this again. I think this would be great over rice or wide egg noodles, or other noodles. You can add items if you want, but if this is the first time you are making this, stick to the recipe and experiment later. Thank you for sharing another easy, lite and delicious meal.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about this dish. It's not something that I would typically make, however, I have had it in my "saved" list on this site for 5 years so I decided that I needed to give it a try tonight! I followed the instructions and the final product was tasty but different. Most of my family enjoyed this. One reviewer said it tasted "Cuban", which may be accurate. I doubled the sauce. I didn't have celery seed so I left that out. In place of some of the chili powder I used a 1/2-tsp of Indian chili pepper (hot) which gave the dish a nice kick. I served this over basmati rice, but my Dad had it over spaghetti which he enjoyed. It might be good with some onions and mushrooms as others have suggested... it did feel like it was missing a vegetable. **Update** I ate this reheated for lunch the next day and its official, I don't like it. Wont make again.

Because of my wife's diverticulitis we left off the celery seeds. Didn't miss them at all.  Excellent recipe. We will definitely do again.

In dishes like this, it's all about the sauce. It was great. I eyeballed the ingredients, so my sauce was a bit too spicy, but I did take other reviewers' suggestions and substituted water and white vinegar for red wine and balsamic. I don't like breaded fried meat, so I just diced and sauteed the chicken (in a bit of olive oil), then added it to the sauce. Instead of serving it on a bed of greens as suggested, I mixed in some cooked elbows, and it became a great casserole! Even picky kids enjoyed it!

Made this and found it delicious.  The only thing I found was that 1/4 cup flour was not enough for 6 breasts. The sauce was excellent.

The sauce was doubled based on other's recommendations. 
 I did not add the extra brown sugar, as there is sugar in the stewed tomatoes.  For a chipotle flavor I added liquid smoke.  Also, one yellow onion, one red bell pepper and one green bell pepper were sliced and added to the sauce and were able to cook while the sauce simmered a short while.

The breasts were browned in olive oil prior to the sauce being made.   I placed them in a 9x13 glass pan, poured the 
sauce over them and baked it uncovered at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  This was made for a small dinner party and I wanted a nice presentation and did not want the meal simmering on the stove while my guests were enjoying their appetizers.

I served it with a salad, sauteed asparagus and ciabatta bread.  There is enough sauce and chicken left over to enjoy it over rice as a second meal.  Delicious and an absolute winner.  All my guests enjoyed it.

This is AWESOME! My whole family loves it!  I made it as per the recipe-no changes and it was perfect. I served it with French style green beans and Naan. Yes, Naan is Indian but it goes wonderfully with the sauce.   I will be making this on a regular basis. Thank you for this fab recipe!

Didn't have celery seeds came out great! Kids are always asking for it. I make extra sauce and rice, within 24 hours it is always gone. Leftovers don't stand a chance. Never anything to throw away....
Ever! One tip, use a quality chili powder.

I made this for Sunday dinner recently.  While it was relatively simple, I wasn't all that neat while putting it together.  The only things I changed were to use chicken broth in lieu of water and I used only 1/2 the amount of chili powder.  It turned out really well.  The flavors came together well.  It was good as a leftover and while I have one more serving left, I plan to shred the chicken and use inside a baked potato.  I will make this again.

Used ingredients listed but skipped cooking instructions for the chicken.  Cooked in crockpot.   I thought it was too sweet and i like sweet.  would definitely cut back on the sugar.  even my hubby liked it and that says alot. i thought it was delish.

This was a very simple dish to make with items you likely already have. I used chicken bouillon and cooking wine in place of water. 
The "boys" 2 adult sons and husband rated it as good but not stellar  however they sure gobbled up the leftovers the following day. I loved the thin sauce and the chicken was very tender. My daughter and I give it 5 stars. We swerved over white rice too!

This was a big hit here! Used 4 blsl so re-sized it to 4 but used the entire can of tomatoes (and juice). I reduced the sauce maybe a bit too much - we wanted more sauce! It did come out saltier than I prefer (and I did reduce the salt a bit). Next time I'll let an onion fry up while the chicken is browning, too. Om nom! Thanks for sharing.

Is there ever a recipe that doesn't get "personalized"? This is soooo good - and I did make a few changes per some of the reviews - red wine instead of the water, a bit of Blackberry Fig Balsamic vinegar, thighs instead of breasts, and served it over Israeli Couscous. It was a definite keeper - will make it again - with breasts and again with thighs (makes it a richer flavor, I think!) Loved it - and so did my Sweetheart Husband!

I used both chicken breasts and thighs, and covered them in flour that was in a Ziploc bag.  After browning in a pan, I also softened mushrooms, onions and peppers.  Could easily use diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  There was so much to the meal that I finished baking in the oven.  Good ideas: Doubling the sauce, using a little bit of red wine instead of all water, adding cut vegetables and serving with brown rice.

Only two chicken breasts. Same quantity of sauce (used half can of chicken broth instead of water). After searing both sides in a cast iron skillet, I put the chicken, still in the skillet, in an oven pre-heated to 350 and then turned oven off when the skillet was put in the oven.  This extra time allowed me to pick up my husband from the airport. The hot skillet continues to cook the chicken. I removed chicken from skillet and made sauce (adding Sriracha). After sauce came to a boil, I put in the chicken with the lid. And the chicken turned out tender and the sauce flavorful.

WE LOVED IT, especially since I always like &n appreciate a recipe for a tasty, quick, & E-Z dinner on a busy day!  I have a well stocked pantry, but I always use 'lower sodium' products (anything which comes out of a jar, a can, or a bottle).  IMO, by doing so, it doesn't actually affect the recipe by much, (since everyone can add salt at the table, if they wish.)  In the last step, I added a generous handful of sliced 'Baby Bella Mushrooms' while simmering.  I served this dish over a bed of buttered whole grain linguine, with fresh chopped Italian Parsley over it all.  It was SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS!

Love, love, love this chicken! I serve it with cauliflower rice and broccoli; for some reason I think the broccoli goes great with this sauce. Fyi, I switch the brown sugar with coconut sugar. Try it, you'll love it!

Easy to do and packed with flavour. The chicken was moist enough and had a little crust thanks to the flour. But there was way too much salt in there. I'd take out the last 2 teaspoons out of the recipe...

Was very good.  I did use petite cut diced tomatoes & I cut my chicken breasts in half so they would have lots of flavor.  Will make this again.

With apologies to those who think you shouldn't make a review if you altered the recipe, I don't measure when I cook something like this. And I'm not about to follow a recipe if I think I can improve it. So here goes -

I pounded the breasts and seasoned but skipped the flour, cooking them in olive oil and butter. After taking them from the pan I caramelized onions, then deglazed the pan with wine. For tomatoes I used fire roasted diced. I added the other ingredients to taste and used red pepper flakes instead of chili powder.

We enjoyed this a lot and some of the family had seconds. It really was quick to make and quite tasty. I'll be making this, or some form of this, again.

This was good, in the few reviews I saw I did not see any complaints of sweetness, so I added the brown sugar as stated, but next time I will only use 1 1/2 tblspn. Otherwise this was  good! Thanks for sharing

At 357 calories (with half a cup Uncle Ben's basmati rice) this dish is super tasty! I prepped per instructions, but simmered on low in the crock pot for 4 hours rather than in the frying pan for 40 minutes. I also went a little light on the chili powder and a bit heavier on the brown sugar (my fiance doesn't enjoy spice). I added a diced orange bell pepper for good measure...this was SUPER savory and delicious. It's definitely a meal I'll make again.

Absolutely amazing, this is one of the best recipes I've made, instead of mustard powder I used a half teaspoon of hot mustard, and added two teaspoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce, would recommend this recipe to anyone! It was amazing!

This was OK. I made it because I had most of the ingredients already & the recipe was easy. I used 2 thin chicken breasts, and kept the sauce amount the same as listed for 6 pieces of chicken - it was just enough sauce. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. 2 tsp of chili powder was overpowering.

This was a fantastic recipe. It's a new favorite at our house. I did make some alterations based on our taste, however. I stewed some cherry tomatoes myself instead of using canned tomatoes and I omitted the celery seed. I served it with a salad and a warm baguette.

This was surprisingly good. I subbed prepared spicy brown mustard for the mustard powder, low sodium soy sauce for the worsteschire sauce and celery flakes (those dehydrated bits of celery) for the celery seed. I also used regular tomatoes instead of stewed, because I really didn't want to go to the store and I had all the basic flavors already.  Also, I didn't flour the chicken, and omitted the salt entirely.  I cut two huge chicken breasts to make them thinner, and only had a shade over a teaspoon of chili powder, but kept everything else the same.  It smelled amazing and heated up even better the next day.  Boyfriend didn't overly like it, but I'll make it again. It was enough chili powder flavor for me. I think if you used stewed tomatoes it would be too sweet but this was just right. I think next time I will add some onion and summer squash or zucchini. I might figure out this cooking thing yet lol.

Very good and different way to prepare the ubiquitous boneless, skinless chicken breasts that have become a staple of our diet.  I doubled the sauce but not the chili powder (personal preference) and salt, and omitted the celery seed and hot sauce (because I didn't have any on hand).  This is a great alternative to boring breasts and can be tweaked to suit your personal tastes and the contents of your pantry.

Of note, I like my food fairly salty but found the half-serving more than sufficient:  it would have been too salty if not served with egg noodles.  The chicken came out pretty much fork-tender which isn't easy to achieve with breasts.  The flavor is tangy-sweet with (at a half-portion of chili powder) just a hint of warmth that most any sensitive stomach should be able to handle without pulling out the antacids.  

I would typically have all the ingredients in my pantry, so this will probably enter the rotation of go-to meals for our family.  The egg noodles were good, but could easily be replaced with pretty much whatever you prefer.  I think next time I'll plan ahead to have some fresh, crusty bread to soak up the juice and a green salad instead of noodles or rice.

This was delicious!  I used think bone-in pork chops in place of chicken.  The flavor was amazing.  I had about a cup of sauce leftover and poured it over spaghetti squash for lunch the following day, so good.  Will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe!!! I just added onions, added half water and white  wine as others suggested. I always doubled the recipe for extra sauce.   My picky 9 year old loves it and I can see making this over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe Nancy!!!

Oh... my... goodness...  this was sooo good!  I made It on a whim and now it's in the regular lineup.  I make it with crushed tomatoes (which is basically marinara sauce anyway) and serve It over pasta.

Excellent! Will absolutely make this again. Was in a hurry so I didn't actually measure, and ended up simmering it for 90 minutes while searching for our dog, so it's clearly a forgiving recipe.

No changes.  Won't make again. It was like chicken floating in orange watery tomatoes. Sorry.

I was sure this was going to be a mess as I mixed the ingredients together. But it turned out thoroughly delicious. The recipe is right--buttered French bread is so perfect with this sauce. It's like a tangy/spicy bruschetta. My husband told me the sauce tasted like some kind of really fancy ketchup. I don't like ketchup, but he loves it, so from him, that's high praise.

Will make again.

Ps: I subbed diced tomatos for stewed tomatos because I can't stand stewed tomatos.

Great recipe, and not very difficult.  You don't need the salt, I didn't use any, and I did not have celery seeds, but it was fantastic.  I served it with steamed green beans and roasted red potatoes.  I'll be saving this recipe.

I followed the recipe and it was delicious! The only change I made was to cut down on the salt. I omitted the 1/2 tsp. to be added to the tomato mixture and probably put 3/4 tsp. instead of a whole teaspoon in the flour mixture. It did't need any more than that. My husband and I both loved it!

A Keeper!  Made this seasoned just as the recipe states, except I used canned diced tomatoes (not stewed), and substituted chicken thighs for the breasts. It was delicious and filling served with a tossed salad. Would also be exceptional with crusty bread, pasta, rice, polenta .... whatever floats your boat!

Fantastic recipe. Tomatoes were great. Spice level was superb. Added mushrooms, subtracted the brown sugar, and served it over pasta. Simple strawberry feta salad on spring mix with a white balsamic. Oh and I generally triple any garlic amount that I read in a recipe. Just my household preference.

My SO is picky and dislikes spicy foods but LOVES  this recipe. I enjoy it too but not  the mess of "frying" chicken. I finally got wise and began  using a Dutch oven to brown the chicken and leaving it in the pan. Also, while it's browning, I microwave the sauce ingredients (always doubling it), with 2 TB of butter. When the chicken is brown, I carefully stir  into the chicken and simmer as directed  It tastes just as good but is much less time consuming and there are always leftovers. Thighs also taste great.

Followed recipe to the letter.  Don't know why this is a 5-star dish.  It's horrible I'm sorry to say.  Don't want to offend the cook, but the combination of herbs/spices and stewed tomatoes made for an awful taste.  My husband did not finish dinner, and neither did I.

The sauce is so good my wife and I pulled out spoons to finish it off after the chicken was gone.  

I cooked the chicken on the grill and added to the finished sauce.  Just loved it!

I am SO glad that I took another cook's suggestion about only adding 1 tsp. of chili powder as opposed to the required two tsps.  It would have been WAY too spicy for my taste.  I did use the required amount of salt, even though another cook thought that it was too much.  I did not find that to be the case.  Chicken was extremely tender, but don't think that I'll make this again because I wasn't crazy about the combination of flavors.

I tripled the recipe to make sure there would be leftovers. I used 2.5 to 3 pounds of cut up chicken breast. Oh the smell as it cooked was so delightful. I used (1) 14oz. stewed tomatoes and (1) 28 oz. of petite cut tomatoes.  ( We liked the smaller pieces of tomato).  This one will be made again.

I would add a little more water to the recipe due to mine being burnt but the chicken taste itself is amazing. It's tender and has a perfect texture.

Followed the measurements exactly . Loved the flavor , found it a little too spicy. As other reviewers recommended I added sliced onions and mushrooms and doubled the sauce , great over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely makes it again but reduce the amount of chilli powder.

Definitely 5+ stars - I used chicken thighs, chicken broth in lieu of water, espresso balsamic instead of white vinegar.  I didn't think this was spicy at all and I used far more of each of the spices.  I did not add onion although I think I will next time.  I agree with everyone that posted - this can go with rice, pasta, great enough alone, etc.  I served with roasted brussel sprouts (halved, drizzled with olive oil, sea salt and cracked pepper) I only lightly salted the flour - I did not use any other salt and it was great!

This will definitely be on my rotation list. I was looking for something different and I happened to have all the ingredients except for the white vinegar. I used red wine vinegar instead. It was AMAZING! I only had one large chicken breast which I cut into 1/2. The sauce was not too much. We practically drank it it was so delicious.

I was skeptical when I read the ingredients list. This turned out freaking amazing. Subbed chicken stock for the water (never add just moisture when you can add both moisture and flavor) and omitted the hot sauce to account for munchkin taste buds. This is great because it works out of things that are already in the pantry. The only thing I had to buy for the dish that I didn't already have on hand was the chicken.

My goodness! This was yummy! I made a couple of little changes... I didn't put in the celery seed because I didn't have any. I didn't put in the water because my can of tomatoes was a bigger one. I used only 2 chicken breasts cut into strips because there are only two of us. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic but those are insignificant changes I think. I served it with penne pasta and just dumped the drained pasta into the chicken & sauce for a couple of minutes at the end. There is a little bit of heat to the sauce but we loved it. I will certainly be making this again! Oh I forgot, one of the reviews said it was too salty so I left out the salt on the chicken and the salt in the sauce. I think that was the right decision. One could always add some when eating if it seemed to need it but I thought it was perfect without that salt.

As per other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, cuz I just can't ever get enough sauce.  I substituted half chicken broth and half red wine for the water.  Also added sliced onions, red and green bell pepper and mushrooms.  Whole family loved it. They even went back for seconds, and wished they had leftovers.  Definitely added to our meal rotation!

This was delicious, and would be great to serve to company for a casual supper.  Cut quantity to 3 and made that sauce amt for 2 chicken breasts, which worked great.  Served with saffron rice and roasted some asparagus with the extra diced tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, S&P.  High-five from the entire family - yum!

This recipe was very good!  Only change I made was to use some fire roasted diced tomatoes because I didn't have any stewed ones.  Very flavorful.  Served it over some soybean pasta for a relatively low carb meal.

delicious.  i actually modified the recipe due to the fact i made it last minute and didn't have all the ingredients.  It was a life-saver for a day i didn't know what to have for tea!
Modification was I added some leftover roast potatoes which added body to the dish and helped it to go further.  I missed out the hot pepper sauce, mustard powder, garlic and celery seed and i swapped the worcestershire sauce for soy sauce.
It was delicious as is so no problem to miss those ingredients out although garlic would be great to have in it :)

This dish was truly wonderful!  At first I was a little skeptical of the spice combination but it really comes together to elevate the flavor of the sauce. I did double the sauce and used red wine instead of the vinegar as suggested by several reviews.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

I had thawed out some chicken breasts & came across this recipe while browsing thru the website. I had everything on hand & thought what the heck. WOW...I am so glad I tried it. The sauce is amazing. So flavorful. I couldn't get enough.  Yes, I modified it a smidge but just because I used what I had on hand. 1) I only had 4 chicken breasts so I cut them in half like tenders. 2) I only had plain diced tomatoes not stewed tomatoes. Other than that, I followed this recipe as written. It was such a wonderful change to my regular baked or bbq'd chicken recipes. This dish was super simple to throw together & would be perfect to serve at a dinner party or just a casual dinner in front of the tv, as my husband & I did! Lol

Instead of using salt and pepper on each individual chicken breast, I used a seasoned flour to save time. The recipe was super easy, and super delicious!!!

Easy and amazing. I used a cast iron skillet. I followed the recipe  except I halved the chili powder.  Perfect if you don't like it too hot.
When I returned the chicken to the tomato mixture I put the skillet in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes- turning the chicken once at 15 minutes.  Amazing! Served with a side  of brussell sprouts.

I made it as printed.  I cooked four leg quarters in the slow cooker at 250 degrees and they were done in 30 min.  The extra sauce with rice, peas and carrots made a great soup.

This was delicious! My husband also said this was one of the best new recipe that has come around in awhile. It will definitely go into the rotation. The only changes I made is I added half an onion thinly sliced to the butter, used red wine and chicken broth instead of water. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. I served it over brown rice and quinoa with sautéed spinach and mushrooms.

Honestly I didn't want to like it. The thought of sweet brown sugar and tomatoes does not appeal to me.   Changes I made doubtfully would reduce stars from original.
I sauteed a green bell pepper and one onion to add to the sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes. I started to freak when it was tasting sweet to me, so I threw in a few extra shots of Texas Pete and a bunch more mustard powder to try to balance it. I probably didn't have to do any of that. In the end the flavor was so Awesome. My husband loved it too. I added this to my personal cookbook so I will remember to come back to it often.

Oh yes!  this is a five star.  Believe the author and serve with rice or crusty bread to soak up extra sauce.  Otherwise, use sauce and leftover chicken to mix with spinach and cannelloni beans to serve over linguiine.

While easy to make this is not a favorite of mine.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and substituted  canned diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes.  I also used kosher salt, which isn't as strong tasting as the salt that's been around forever.  The finished dish wasn't salty;  it was sweet.  And sweet isn't what I'm looking for when I make dinner.  On the plus side, it was quick to make.

OMG good.  What's even more impressive is the ease in making this dish.  I'm teaching my 15 year old son to cook and let him make the entire dish.  I came out perfectly.  If I had known about the sauce it creates, I would have made mashed potatoes to go along with it.  Seriously, one of the best meals I've ever had!

Chicken, we probably have it 2-3 times a week, and I was looking for something different.  Well, I found it!  I had all the ingredients...I didn't have chicken breasts, only legs...no matter, it was just so GOOD!  Both my Hubby and I were smacking our lips on the flavor...sopping up the extra "gravy" with rolls was beyond tasty.  This is a keeper and I'll be making it again!

I liked the flavor a lot!  I will only add a little water next time (maybe 2 tablespoons). I think it would be really good with a thicker sauce!  Also, I used bone -in thighs, since I think they are tastier, so I added another 10 minutes to the cooking time.

Will not make again.  The flavor sounded interesting but just tasted awful!   Perhaps it was the celery seeds that did it.

Will definitely make again.  Want to explore how to make it in the Instant Pot. 
The only thing I changed was I made 2 big breasts for the two of us. Made the same amount of sauce but at the end spooned the chunks over the breasts, added 1/2 cup old vine zin and reduced the cooking  liquid by half. Sooooo good. We ate every morsel. The only other sub was DelMonte diced tomatoes with chilies, onions and garlic in place of stewed tomatoes because that was what I had on hand.
Id say double the sauce if making more than 3 breasts unless they are small, then double if making more than 4.
I served with chunky, seasoned, oven-roasted potatoes which were good with the sauce too.

I wanted so much to love this but it was sooo sweet!  I doubled the sauce, used 3 large breasts cut in pcs.  Substituted  white wine vinegar and red wine for half of the water.  Also used diced tomatoes rather than stewed
  Added some red & orange peppers  (not a lot), otherwise the same.  I want to try again but I'm not sure if reducing the brown sugar to half will do it.  My husband also said way too sweet.  Good flavor though.  The amount of sauce was perfect. Served over rice.

Simply Scrumptious chicken breasts. I've made this a lot and get raves from my guests. I use a can of petite cut diced tomatoes instead of stewed ones. I also use chicken broth in lieu of the water and usually cook them about 20 - 25 minutes depending on the size of breasts.

This is way too sweet for a chicken dish that has no fruit in it!! If I made it again I would omit the sugar completely! Made the recipe exactly as written except the salt due to other reviewers suggestions. Used chicken broth in place of water. Had to double the vinegar, garlic, Worcestershire, soy sauce and chili powder in order to counteract the sugar and get some flavor into the sauce. Added 1/2 tsp Kosher salt. Even so, it left somewhat to be desired.

I made with a few modifications based on other reviews & what I had on hand. I browned 3 Purdue perfect portion chicken breasts then sauteed onion, mushroom, garlic & chopped fresh celery (did not have celery seed). Added all other ingredients (but due to our oreferences, I left out the hot sauce and only used 1/2 t chili powder), & cooked as directed. Served over angel hair pasta, it was quite tasty. The full sauce amount was perfect for 3 smallish breasts. If I were making 6 breasts, I would double the sauce. Very easy and quick to make.

Made this last night with chicken thighs and it was so good! Way tastier than the recipe sounds.  I was skeptical but the reviews are right on! My partner who is tough to please loved it,  too. Served it with Jasmine rice, Caesar salad, red wine and it was a perfect dinner!

I followed then directions exactly. I doubled the sauce and cut 2 chicken breast into thick strips.  The chicken was SO soft and the sauce was excellent! Super spicy so if you don't like spice then I'd cut back or totally exclude the hot sauce.

I made this mostly as written (wine substitutions and less hots per reviewers).  However, I was stunned when I realized I had no brown sugar in the house.  I substituted with some nice cherry preserves instead.  It was really nice, but I think the brown sugar would have been better.  Nevertheless, I loved this recipe.

Delicious!!  This will be a staple in our home.  The sauce is so yummy.  Some of the reviews said there wasn't enough sauce.  My family is small so I only made 3 chicken breasts but made the entire amount of sauce.  It was great.  I served it w/  white rice, fresh steamed green beans and some crusty bread.  SO good.

Probably one of the most delicious chicken recipes I have ever made!  Obviously one would adjust salt content to taste with any recipe.  Made exactly as the recipe states and have only one word to describe it - WONDERFUL!!!  Thank you!

I made this both ways, with and without the chili powder and hot sauce..I have kids who don't  even like the slightest heat, whereas, I prefer a little sometimes. The dish was great to my taste both ways. but I can't understand why every chef,  cook and home cook  that writes a finds it necessary to throw
anything from red pepper flakes  to ghost peppers into every family dish they make.??

LOVED!  We put this on the do-over list because we loved it so much.  I left out the hot sauce just because I was out of it, and used a little less salt than recommended and loved it.  Made with wild rice and fresh green beans as the side.  The left over sauce was great poured over the rice.  We will definitely make this again.  Be warned, it was a time commitment, but worth it!

Very good!  Used olive oil instead of butter.  Added a bit of cayenne.  Sauteed some sliced onion and garlic before adding the tomatoes.  Used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Used red wine and chicken broth instead of water.  Used balsamic vingear instead of white.  Used about 1/3 of the sugar.

Had great flavor, family said a keeper! A few changes: skipped dredging the chicken in flour, didn't add the celery seed since I didn't have, used petite tomatoes (just a preference) and replaced 1/2 the water with wine.

Super simple and very yummy. I am new to "cooking new dishes". I've got maybe 10-12 "go-to" dishes (I cook every night since my wife tends to work late often times). This is the first new one I've tried from this site & it was great. I really like the sweetness of the brown sugar with the tanginess of Worcestershire sauce. I made some broccoli as a side and served it over rice. Wonderful. I like Tabasco a lot, so I added a bit more than the recipe called for, but I don't think that's necessary. It actually took away from the sweetness.

I used canned diced tomatoes because that is what we had on hand. I also used turkey tenderloin due to using what we had on hand. It turned out great! My family loved it. The meat was so tender, juice and flavorful! Looks like a 5 star dish and tastes like one but is really a cinch and can use your general kitchen ingredients... no special shopping required! Great recipe.

This was really, really good.  I made it tonight and my family enjoyed it.  I made it exactly as directed, and we devoured it.  When I make it again, I will definitely double the sauce (as someone else suggested).  It was very good, but we'd like to cover our rice with this tasty sauce next time. Yummy!

I have the absolute impossible to family to cook for.  My sons have completely different taste as does my step daughter.  This recipe is one of the few that EVERYONE eats, and low calorie too!  I do add more garlic than called for (double it), and I put a few pinches of cajun spice.  Yummy.

This was delicious! I added chopped onion, sweet peppers and mushrooms as I love my veggies. Also I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a small can of tomato sauce. This was an easy dinner and very flavorful. Will make it again.

I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and used red wine instead of water. Everything else was used as written and it was perfect. Served over Angel Hair pasta.

Just made it - served with wild/brown rice and veggies.  Very good. Used a little more hot sauce - we like spicy. Will be added to my favorites to make again . . .and again.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I was short on time, but didn't want just a bland, dry chicken breast dinner. This recipe was anything but bland. I followed to a tee except that I didn't have mustard seed powder, so I just used the whole grain mustard. My husband loved it. I served over rice with a side salad. I think I found my go to recipe for chicken breasts. Great flavours! Thank you so much for sharing.

Made this ahead of time for a a pot luck (kept it warm in the oven).  Substituted ancho chile for the cayenne--so it had a slightly smoky taste.   Everyone seemed to enjoy it--there was very little left from a double recipe.

Very easy and tasty. Used stewed tomatoes with garlic. Chicken was fork tender. My finicky husband even complimented the dish. Definitely make again. I think I'll try it with filleted fish next!

Wow, this is delicious. I questioned it with all the different spices but it was just perfect! The sauce over rice is what really makes it. The only thing I did different is used 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of Merlot wine instead of the water. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Both my husband and I loved this meal - loved the taste of all the ingredients.  In fact,  my husband said if I put that sauce in a mug, he would drink it.   The only change I made was to reduce the amount of salt.  Very tasty - will definitely make again.

I enjoyed it.  I cooked it in a small electric pot on top of the refrigerator in a hotel room in the north of Thailand.  I didn't have flour or the celery seeds, but the rest was fine (even the brown sugar).  I knicked across the lane to a restaurant to buy a 5 cent bag of rice and everything was wonderful.  Shall certainly make it again (when I get home).  Ah, my neighbour has just asked what was it that smelt so nice.!!
Well I'm now home and I made it again.  I made it with more care and I liked it even better than the first time.  Quick and easy too.  I made it with wings as I do not care for breasts.

I made a few changes. Ripe garden tomatoes instead of canned. Honey instead of brown sugar and I added some white wine in place of water. I've made it a couple times. It is always a hit, down to the last drop of sauce.

This is so good!  I did make 1 change only because I didn't have stewed tomatoes. I used Contandina sweet onion & basil diced tomatoes and I think it added this nice bit of sweetness. The sauce was so good I even saved the extra so I could make a another quick breast later. My kids loved it to.

I pretty much cooked it as it was, but ran into one problem. The amount of liquid will cook down too low and needs to be watched. Wonderful will cook again.

35-40 minutes is way too long. I simmered it 35 minutes and burned the sauce through. It should be more like 15-20 minutes. It was a very good recipe except for that one unfortunate part. I'll try it again and not burn it!

Great, easy recipe with complex flavor .  Used bone-in thighs because we like those better. I halved most of the spices because it seemed like too much; glad I did, wouldn't have liked the full amount of chile powder, mustard, etc.  I did add back in some of the brown sugar (surprising because I don't like sweet dishes, but it seemed better for the full amount). Used 1/4 C chicken broth & 1/4 C red wine in place of the water. Used white wine vinegar in place of white vinegar. Served with salad and crusty French roll.  Couscous would be good with this. Adding to the recipe favorites.

This was yummy and well received at my house which includes a picky teen! I followed the recipe with just small changes as suggested by other reviewers: used red wine instead of water, used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed and cut chili powder to one tsp.  I did not get the bbq flavor some have mentioned and didn't find it too sweet or salty either. The flavor of the fire roasted tomatoes was nicely evident. My husband and I agree it will probably be even better the next day, so I may make it ahead of time or in the crock pot next time. It's a keeper!

I will probably make it again.
Better with rice. I thickened the sauce or it would run all over the plate.

This was great!  There is a subliminal taste of barbeque, but it's so much more than that.  It has a deep, earthy flavor that's fabulous over rice.   I doubled the recipe and served some of the leftover chicken as a salad topping.  Yeah, it's that good.

Excellent !  When first reading the ingredients, thought it might be a bit unusual, but I was wrong.  Only small changes I made was to add thin sliced onions, cut chili powder to one teaspoon and added more garlic powder.  Served over white rice and leftovers were even better the next day.  I eat lots of chicken and always looking for new recipes so boredom doesn't set in, and this recipe did not disappoint.  Its now on my chicken recipe rotation.

This is a great recipe! My BF told me which ingredients he was bringing over to make dinner, I found this recipe and actually had all the other ingredients on hand, which rarely happens! It was a tad too sweet but I had also added an onion so that might have been why. The chicken was very moist and the aroma was divine. We will be making this again.

I used 2 huge legs and 1 giant breast for us. Otherwise made exactly as recipe state except for the salt. I never use salt in any recipe except bread when yeast is involved. Served the sauce over quinoa with broccoli cauliflower casserole ( from this site) and tossed salad. No bread! My tomatoes were the no salt added diced variety. This was easy to prepare ahead of time so when it was time to cook all I had to do was pop  the chicken pieces in the ziplock bag with the flour mixture, brown it and pour all the other ingredients in the pan to boil.  While the chicken was cooking I had the time to prepare all the fresh vegetables for the salad. Thanks for sharing. We will probably eat this every so often especially if I am short on time because we eat a lot of chicken!

This recipe was easy to put together and absolutely DELISCIOUS exactly as. The chicken was incredibly tender. I served it over rice. My husband loves it and I have sent it on to several people.  I look forward to this dish again!!

This was an absolute hit ! Both my husband and I loved this dish.  Will make again soon. The only thing I did different was to cut the recipe down for two by using two chicken breasts and having all other ingredients.

Mmmm mmmm mmmm.  Loved this.  I enjoy dishes where you do a minimal amount of prep and then leave them to cook, and this was one of them.  I was able to brown the chicken breasts (used three large chicken breasts - not halves - with rib meat) and mixed together the sauce ingredients (I used Italian style diced tomatoes instead of stewed ones), got my kids from preschool, and then started the actual cooking once home.  

This tasted like a not-too-sweet BBQ chicken, tbh.  The sauce does not penetrate the meat, so be sure to dump a few spoonfuls on top of the meat once plated.

My husband insisted that I add this to "must make again".  He even asked to take the one leftover piece to work for lunch and raved again when he came home!

The flavor is so savory and interesting!!

I've never written a review for a recipe before but I loved this one so much I had to.
My husband and kids loved this just the way it is, I'm a vegetarian so I swapped out the chicken for eggplant for my portion and added it in with the sauce for the last 5 minutes only. Didn't want it getting too soggy. 
It was AMAZING. I've just made it again tonight for tomorrows lunch.
Definitely will make this many more times.

The reviews were so good, I tried this. Of course I had to add my touch. I used arrowroot powder and coconut flour instead of flour. I added Cajun spice, s & p, garlic powder to the mix. Browned it, set it aside. I used a can of organic fire roasted diced tomatoes, white rice vinegar, worscestershire sauce, a tsp of Dijon mustard and the rest of the spices and br sugar.  I cooked it in the skillet for 30 mins and turned it off. Reheated for dinner with gluten-free pasta (brown rice and quinoa) with thin green beans in garlic butter. My brother and I loved it. The flavor is unique. I will add this to my  menu for sure. Easy and delicious.

Excellent!  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I only used 1 teaspoon of chili powder.  It still gave a little zing but not too much heat.  This one's going in my regular rotation. :)

As I only had three chicken breasts I halved the ingredients except for the stewed tomatoes. I added one teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder and just a little bit of water. In one word DELICIOUS!

Very disappointing!  After all the great reviews, I was so excited to make this for our family Sunday dinner.  It wasn't good, it wasn't horrible but definitely not something I'd make again.  I followed the directions exactly, only substituted chicken broth for the water.  I'm giving it 2 stars and not just one because my 8 year old VERY picky eater, ate it and actually liked it!

Love this recipe. It's easy and quick.  I don't used canned tomatoes, simply because they're not as readily available here.  However, even with using fresh tomatoes, this recipe is still awesome.  I just "stew" the tomatoes for around 10 minutes.  My family loves it, especially my hubby. :) I skip the hot stuff to be kid-friendly.

I quite liked it.  Robert said it's ok.
Had used 1 can Rotel and the enough canned my tomatoes to fill 14 oz.  So, no hot sauce.  Was plenty spicy.  Red wine vinegar, instead of white vinegar.
Made 2 breasts, but the same amt of sauce.  Browned the chicken without flour.

I made the recipe almost as written. The only change was to use Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes. I did that in response to reviewers who said it was too salty as written and perhaps that was due to the stewed tomatoes. I have no idea if that is right or not. BUT, the results using the diced tomatoes were phenomenal. I used chicken tenders (9 of them) browned as directed and because they are smaller than the breasts, I simmered the sauce (covered) for half an hour before adding the browned tenders. I let them simmer (again covered) for 20 minutes turning them over after 10 minutes and the result was wonderful. Great recipe Nancy... thanks.

This was very tasty and just different enough to not be boring. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and white wine and chicken broth instead of water. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts. It made a good Dinner with rice and garlic bread.

I would rate this a 5-star recipe.  My husband and son both rated it 4 stars.  The chicken is very moist and tasty. I used stewed tomatoes and chicken broth in place of water.  Next time I will add some chopped onion, as other reviewers have suggested.  Very good recipe!

It turned out really good without changing anything. I served it over pasta, but with the flavor of it  I will serve potatoes or a wild rice on the side instead the next time. Very easy and husband loved it!

I made this for my drama class with only one change.  Replaced flour with corn starch as one of my  students can't have gluten.  The crust on the meat was very delicate, and very tasty.  The sauce was out of this world delicious, and my students devoured the food like they were starving.  They all asked for a copy of the recipe and have demanded that I make it again--SOON!

Very good recipe, did exactly as recipe indicated, and family loved it.  Next time I may add onions and peppers just to kick it up a notch.

I made this dish and my husband and I both loved it so I am making it again this week!  I doubled the sauce and I don't add additional salt if any ingredient already has salt, which my canned tomatoes do.  Very easy and pleasing taste.  I served it over spaghetti sauce.  Making this again this week!  Total winner!

So I made this, and follow the direction as written, I though it was good, but a little too sweet for my taste, my picky husband, who does not like to try anything  new, tasted a piece of chicken from my plate & he was hocked , he  loved it, and asked for it  it 3 times that night, I will make this again, since he loved it. But maybe I will used regulars can tomatoes, and use a little less sugar.

I was really unsure of this recipe with the odd mix of spices (chili power with celery seed and mustard powder). But I went ahead and made it as written. My husband and I were convinced it must be good just from the aroma as it was cooking. It tasted as good as it smells. Considering making this for an 8-person dinner party coming up.

1st time I made it. We do a family Sunday dinner and the family loved it.  I made a couple o f minor changes as I cooked for seven.  I had some leftover chicken broth from the green beans I made to go with this dish so I used it instead of water.  I also did brown rice and felt like 1 can of tomatoes wouldn't begin to deal with seven servings.  I used two cans of tomatoes with basil and oregano and next time I'll use three.  The tomatoes cooked on a slow siimmer for over an hour and cooked down to very little juice so when I added the chicken breasts I added another full can of chicken broth and simmered the breasts for about 40 minutes.  It was so good it surprised me.  Everyone loved it and it will definitely be on our annual Sunday dinner list plus I'll do it for company at other times.  This ones a home run.

Delicious. The only thing I will cut back on next time is the chili powder - 1/2 the amount called for (or less). Otherwise very flavorful and easy.

Big hit with husband and kids.  Easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand. Good tasting sauce.  More complex than I expected.  Used diced instead of stewed tomatoes.  Will make again

This was an excellent recipe! I put all the ingredients in my pressure cooker.  The meat was so tender.  It was wonderful.  The only change I made is I put 1/4 cup of red wine and 1/4 cup of cooking brandy.  Excellent flavor!  My husband loved it too!

Made it exactly the way it was written teamed it up with a quinoa/brown rice combination. Probably one of the best chicken breast recipes I have. Perfect for a company dinner. Easy to prepare in advance.

It was great.  I added spices to the flour.  Paprika, garlic and onion powder as well as the salt and pepper.   I used chicken broth instead of water.  It was a big hit with my wife.  She has been telling everyone how much she liked the meal for 4 days now.  I promised to do it again this week.

I was surprised at what a unique flavor this chicken recipe had. It was simple and quick. I would serve it to company. Try it for a little something different.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes (and my husband doesn't like them anyway) so I used diced tomatoes. I thought they were perfect.

I took the advice of one who said she had used less chili powder. I did and was quite pleased with the taste.  I also used pork chops once and chicken breasts the other.  Absolutely delicious.  I consider myself an experienced cook and would never have guessed this sauce would taste as good as it does.  Kudos

My husband loved this! (this is the mark of a recipe that's going to be repeated,)  I used the frozen tenderloins they sell at Costco in approximately the correct amount. I didn't have any celery seed and I cut back a bit on the brown sugar, but otherwise the recipe was as written.  Very tasty and there were NO leftovers. I served it with noodles instead of rice. Nummy!

After reading other reviews, I double the sauce ingredients and added chopped onion and artichoke hearts. I also substituted white wine for the vinegar. It turned out great and I serve it over rice. I would definitely make it again. Thank you for the submission.

Made recipe as written except added stock instead of water. Was tasty and husband enjoyed it. Definitely need to double the sauce. I did not like the addition of chili powder and would not make this again as is because of that . I'd rather have added artichokes or capers

This turned out awesome. After reading all the reviews I did make some changes. Instead of water I used white wine. It was supposed to be red but I opened the wrong bottle. Oops..  I added chopped onion and I doubled the sauce and served over rice. Even with the white wine it tasted great. The hubby loved it. The left overs tasted better the next day. This will definitely go into my rotation of cooking.

The second night, the flavors had a chance to meld, and it was out-of-this-world! Usually, I make it as written, but I read the reviews and did incorporate a few of the suggestions.  I doubled the sauce using 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I used dry red wine in place of water; and balsamic vinegar in place of white vinegar.  I used only half of the chili powder, omitted the celery seed, and a little extra hot pepper sauce.  20 minutes before the end of the cooking time, I added a sliced vidalia onion; then decided to cook it a little longer because the chicken breasts were quite large.  I did have some the first night, and I thought it was good, but knew from experience it would "rock" the next night.  It's an unusual and unique combination of flavors [for me] but I was wowed by them. I served it over orzo because I love orzo!  Thank you, Nancy, for an outstanding recipe!

I  followed the suggestions of many of your reviewers: Used chicken broth instead of water; wine, instead of vinegar; diced tomatoes, instead of stewed. I omitted the flour, to make it gluten-free.  I think  next time I'll omit the hot pepper.  Overall, I thought it a very good recipe.

Followed recipe but with less chili powder and no celery salt since I didn't have any. Also used plain diced tomatoes.  Very good depth of flavor. Will make again, but we like more sauce so will add more tomatoes and try the wine idea, also want to try adding onion and bell peppers as someone suggested.

Awesome recipe. I used 8 chicken thighs instead of breasts because we prefer them. I didn't have stewed tomatoes but I had a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes and they worked quite well. We had it with brown rice and it's a definite make again. I took one reviewer's advice and left the salt out.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was I cut down the 1 teaspoon of salt to a half a teaspoon and served it over jasmine rice. I think next time I may try adding some button mushrooms. My family all loved this dish and I will definitely be cooking it again.

This recipe was rather bland.  The cook time was way too long.  Chicken which has been browned really doesn't need more than 10 minutes in the sauce.  I removed the chicken from the pan, added all the sauce ingredients and simmered for about 10 minutes and all the liquid was gone.  I needed to add more liquid, bring to a simmer and then return the chicken to the pan to finish cooking and heat through.  But  it was kind of boring.  I notice in the picture that there appears to be diced onions.  Perhaps that recipe used other than plain stewed tomatoes.  Perhaps that recipe used diced tomatoes with herbs which would certainly have ramped up the flavor a bit.

Great, healthy, easy, comfort food dinner! My husband loved it too! Adjustments: coconut oil instead of butter and I simmered the chicken for only 30 minutes, flipping halfway (I reduced the recipe to 2 servings instead of 6)
It fell apart it was so tender!

Just for fun I added a can of tomato paste to the basic recipe, and it made the sauce nicely rich and flavorful.

I used crushed tomatoes, that's what was available. A different interesting taste! I will make it again.

When I cook something new I always follow the exact recipe, then if I make it again I'll experiment. This recipe was good as it was very flavorful. I understand why some said it tasted too much like chili but we like that profile. The chicken was over cooked though and the sauce was too liquidy for my liking. Next time I will cut the chicken in strips first or use very thin breast filets. I will allow the sauce to thicken before adding the chicken back in and only simmer for a few minutes to cook the chicken. My husband wants more hot sauce (Tapatio) added, which I'll do. Flavor-wise my family really enjoyed this. We served with crusty bread one night and leftovers with rice. A big green salad would go well with this.

This recipe is definitely going to be a staple in my home. My family and friends loved it. I read the reviews so the only change I made was exchanging wine for the water. I also cut back on the chili powder. I served this over rice. It was delicious!

This was delicious!  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I just omitted it.  It still had a great robust flavor.  I loved how simple the recipe was to assemble.  I served it with Rotini noodles and spooned the sauce over the noodles.

Delicious!!! Pound the chicken breasts so they are about 1/3 in thick and you can reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes in the sauce (check them to be sure they're done of course).

My husband, my 8 year old son, and myself loved it! I made it with 2 lbs of chicken which was 3 breasts and added 1/3 cup white wine, one onion sliced and 2 orange bell peppers. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I didn't have the celery seed so left that out. Served with white rice and brussel sprouts. So yummy!!!

Wow this was really good! I only had two big chicken breasts so I really didn't measure out all the ingredients just eyeballed the brown sugar and worstershire sauce. I also used fire roasted diced tomatoes cause I don't like stewed. Added baby Bella mushrooms too.. Yummy will definitely make again.  Thank you.

Very easy to make with ingredients that you typically have on the shelf.  My whole family loved it and commented later on the great flavor of the sauce. I made it earlier in the day and let it simmer on ultra-low for 2 hours and it was very moist and tender.

This is an awesome recipe! As some others suggested I subbed red wine for the water and balsamic for the vinegar. Cubed the chicken and added mushrooms before adding to sauce. Amazing!

The only thing I changed was to cut my chicken into pieces before flouring and frying, Cooked the chicken through and set it aside. I doubled the sauce reduced it and added the chicken at the very end so it stayed crispy. Served over pasta. A drizzle of good balsamic vinegar over the top. My family loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight and we all loved it. I only made a couple of changes because I cannot eat spicy food.  Eliminated the hot pepper sauce, didn't add Chilli powder either. It was very good and will be making it again. Thank you for sharing, I loved the fact it was made in one pan.  Chicken was moist and tender.  I will make rice with it next time for all the wonderful  liquid.

I used a 28 oz can I'd stewed tomatoes because I love them. I used Penzey's dried celery instead of the celery seed, just for personal preference. I kept everything else the same. It was delicious!

This was very tasty and different , I enjoyed very much. The only change I made was substituting the water for chicken stock, as others have mentioned, and simply because I had chicken stock in the fridge I wanted to use up. I did find it a touch sweet for my taste, and am thinking I may 1/2 the brown sugar when I make again which I definitely will. But that is just my taste obviously, you cant go wrong making this per the recipe to start with and then tweaking for your own taste when you make it again.

I did omit the hot sauce, this had a lot of flavor some how the chicken was over done but with all that sauce it was still good.

We have made  this dish several times, with plain diced tomatoes and with stewed tomatoes.  My family thought it was too sweet when made with the stewed tomatoes, but gave it a five star rating when make with plain diced tomatoes.

This was delicious and easy. Just brown the chicken and throw everything into the same pan and simmer! Delicious. It's got a sweet, smoky, savory taste that is delicious over rice. My only wish was that the flavoring soak up into the chicken breast more. Perhaps tomorrow the leftovers will be more absorbed. Great dish!

5+ stars!  What a wonderful dish!  My husband and I truly enjoyed it.  I only made a couple of changes based on the other reviewers suggestions.  Used 1/4 c. red wine for half of the water, only 1 tsp. of chili powder, and balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar.  Served over brown rice with a side of green beans.  Delicious and healthy!

I made this recipe as directed,  except I doubled the sauce and used chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also cooked in an electric frying pan and made a Spanish rice on the side. My husband and I both liked the dish and the rice helped make the dish. Not sure I would make this again, but it was worth the effort for a different dish.

The flavor was absolutely delicious. I'm glad I checked the chicken after only 20 minutes instead of 30-45 as per the directions, because they were already about 200 degrees internally according to my meat thermometer. I'll cut it short next time, but I will definitely make this again.  I didn't have any leftovers!

This recipe was so good that my picky Goddaughter inhaled it! The entire family loved it. I didn't have celery or mustard powder, so I just added some regular mustard. We don't really eat spicy food either so I reduced the chili powder and did not as the hot sauce at all. Added some thin slices of onions the last 15 minutes. Had a little leftover so my husband diced it up and made scrambled eggs with it for breakfast...amazing! Keeper recipe for sure!

This was a hit. I doubled the sauce. I substituted red and white wine for vinegar and water. Also, I added a couple good scoops of sour cream. It was a hit.

I'm not a cook....really hate to cook....seriously.   But this was actually very easy and tasted phenomenal!  I made as directed but omitted the celery seed (I didn't have it, and don't like the taste of it anyway).  I omitted the salt as well, because I think there is plenty of salt already in the worcestershire sauce.  I also DOUBLED the recipe, as I wanted to have sauce for the rice I served with it.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, used 4 cloves of garlic (instead of 2 when the recipe is doubled).  I opted for all organic ingredients, which I think can make a difference in terms of taste.  My family loved it, and I would definitely make this again.  It's a keeper!

I was looking for something new to make.  After the baby we kind of fell into a food rut.  With a 12yr old and a 4 week old it was what ever was easy and fast.  This recipe was very easy and even our daughter loved it.   Great share!

This dish was absolutely delicious and my husband and son loved it too! I did not have celery seed or stewed tomatoes on hand so I substituted celery salt for the celery seed (and used less actual salt) and canned diced tomatoes for the stewed. Super yummy! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really good. We loved the flavors of this dish. I made it as is except I used only 3 breast halves. If I was going to make 6 I would double the sauce. I also used chicken broth for the water and red wine vinegar. I served it with mini-bow-tie pasta and a salad. Thanks, it's a keeper!

I omitted the chili powder (didn't have any) and only used one tablespoon of brown sugar.  I used white balsalmic and sea salt/pepper to taste, not measured.  It was insanely good.

Made this exactly as the recipe but used thigh tenderloins. Added a handful of chopped green pepper towards the last 10 minutes of simmering. Fantastic recipe. Husband had this with french bread, I had it on white rice. Both tasted great. The sauce is really good.

I have made this recipe twice and would not change a thing.  Next time I will double the sauce so that I can use it with fresh vegetables like green beans, zucchini or broccoli.
I will also try this with pork......fabulous!

we must have made this recipe at last 10 times in the period since we found this recipe... 3 months ago. Love it, pretty healthy, loaded with protein.... the only minor change we make is using half of canned stewed tomatoes, and we use few fresh tomatoes.
Nice recipe!

I have made this several times for my family and they love it! This time, I added some carrot and red pepper (it's the only way I can get my son to eat veggies without knowing it!!)

This is so delicious and is now a staple in our house. I make a large amount, portion it and freeze for quick meals. The only thing I do differently is finish it in the oven after a brown the chicken and simmer the sauce a little.

I would give this 5 stars, but my husband would give it 1. To each their own... I made it exactly as the recipe suggests and served with rice and veggies. I thought it was excellent - a little sweet and a little spicy.

Very tasty, though I should mention that all the flavor is in the sauce - if you're cooking for someone who doesn't like sauces, they'll find it very bland.

I thought this chicken was awesome. The ingredient that surprise me the most was the celery seed. Was not sure which dish went well with celery seed added to it and was amazed when I found this recipe. I will be preparing this again in the future!! Delicious chicken!!

I made this recipe, Chicken Breasts Pierre, exactly as written and it was delicious.  I like to try a new recipe at least once a week, usually more, and some are winners and some are not.  This is definitely a winner.  My husband and I really liked it and I will definitely be making this again.

Easy and delicious! I used what I had on hand, omitted the brown sugar and celery seed.  Added 1/2 cup white wine.  Used chicken broth in place of water.  Next time will add an onion and maybe mushrooms!  Excellent recipe that can be tweaked to your own tastes!

Very good!  Easy and flavorful. The only changes I made were using chicken broth instead of water, omitted the celery because I didn't have any on hand, and used a tablespoon of white sugar because I didn't have any brown on hand.   I also added a pinch of parsley.  Next time I will use the celery powder and brown sugar and add an onion.  We served with white rice and steamed broccoli. Yummy!

Wonderful flavors.  I substituted red wine for the water and balsamic for the white vinegar.  I also added onions.  I cut the chicken breasts up after browning them so they absorbed more of the sauce.  Yummy!!

As I made this, it seemed I was making slightly chunky barbecue sauce chicken.  Thankfully, I wasn't.  It was a bit salty, but I'm blaming chili powder rather than salt.  Good, but didn't wow.  'Think I'll use the sauce in soup.  Very tender though, & not much cleanup.  Oh, I didn't add water, but 1/4c homemade chicken broth; reduced sugar to 1T.

I think I added too much water because it was bland. I did not omit any of the ingredients and even added a thinly sliced onion. I would reduce the sauce more if I made it again.

This was fabulous. I did add onions because everything's better with onions and cut the chili powder in half, as suggested. I also simmered without the top for a bit to thicken the sauce, but otherwise used the original ingredients. If you don't like sweet very much, you might cut the brown sugar back a tad. I served over rice.

This recipe was amazing... I added hot sauce instead of hot pepper sauce.. I took the advise of the reviews and added half a yellow onion the last 15 minutes of cooking time and I put shredded cheese on top one it was complete... It was delish... this recipe should be made with mashed potatoes.. Yum!!!

I absolutely love this recipe. I did what others suggested and added onions and peppers..I also used diced tomatoes as opposed to stewed tomatoes and added a little extra (1/2 teaspoon) of hot pepper sauce to give it an extra kick. This is my favorite recipe that I've tried on this website and the only one I've ever reviewed.
Thanks Nancy!

Excellent. My husband and I loved it. I would add a second can of stewed tomatoes. It was a little dry. I also pounded the chicken breasts for faster cooking. I served it on rice pilaf and this is a keeper and I will make often.

This is a good, solid recipe. I didn't read the reviews before cooking, but did so after. I ended up doing some of the things others did, white wine vinegar, white wine instead of water, diced tomatoes instead of stewed, leaving out the teaspoon of salt. I use thighs instead of breasts so didn't have a dryness problem, but also only cooked 25 minutes.  This is an interesting combination of sweet, salty, spicy and tangy. I do think that onions would not be out of place in the sauce and would add another dimension to the flavors.  Also, I wish I would have added more hot sauce or some red pepper flakes for a little more of a kick.  Overall, a recipe that can be adapted to tastes and is easy to make.

This was very good.  I did cut back to 1 tsp of the chili powder and a few drops of the hot sauce.  I also pounded the chicken breasts before cooking as I prefer a thinner cut. Used petite cute diced tomatoes. Served with mashed potatoes. Very good and will make again.

I thought this was a great recipe! I did make some changes but nothing major. I subbed balsamic for white vinegar (because I thought I didn't have white-used it to clean and couldn't find it!), added more garlic than it called for and added some garlic powder with the other spices-probably about 1 tsp. Also since it's only me I used 2 chicken breasts-could've fit one or two more but if I was making six I would definitely double the sauce. I made rice and when that was done, added it to the chicken mixture. It was very tasty and I will be making it again. Thank you!

I really enjoy this recipe.  I have always made it just as is and my husband and nanny love it as well.  The kids (all under 5) aren't huge fans, although I find if I boil up some pasta, shred the chicken and add some of the sauce (which I always double up on) they will eat it.

This sounded more promising than it actually turned out to be. It has flavor, but the cooking time is way too long. I only cooked it for 20 minutes in the sauce, not the recommended 35-40 and the chicken came out very dry. I used white wine in place of water, added onion and cut the chili powder down to half as was recommended. As I said, it had flavor but we just didn't like it.

This is a keeper,I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful, far better than I thought it would be.   My husband is super picky and he loved it as did I.  I did however make a couple of changes.  I eliminated the can tomatoes all together and instead used a full can of chicken stock and added in 1 green pepper and 1 onion.  It was perfect.  We had it over brown rice and mixed veggies on the side.  This will be in the dinner rotation.

Uh-MAY-ZING!! And it didn't take me the full hour and 10min, probably around 45 minutes total. I didn't change anything other than omit the celery seed and hot pepper sauce because I didn't have them. Definitely a do again for my family!

I just tried this recipe tonight.  I'm usually not a fan of chicken and tomatoes together, but this was very good.  The only things I would change for next time is to cut back on the salt and brown sugar by half.

I have made this twice, and it turned out great both times! The first time I made it, I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced. It was just as good. The Worcestershire sauce really adds the flavor, so don't skip that ingredient!

Fillet the chicken so it's not so thick. Add atleast 1/4c red wine and only 1/4c water.

This is restaurant-quality fare.  I used vodka to deglaze the skillet and a shot in the sauce while reducing. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  Poured it over rotini pasta.  Excellent!

This sauce is amazing. I tweeked it a bit to turn it into one of the best chipotle sauces I have ever tasted. I diced up my stewed tomatoes and only added one Tbspn of brown sugar, I also omitted the celery seed. Then I added about 4 adobe chipotle peppers in sauce, from a can, and there you have it authentic chipotle sauce that goes great over chicken or mixed in rice. My husband was both satisfied and impressed!

While I liked the coated and sauteed chicken--a very simple technique--the sauce was not my cuppa tea, at all. I thought the ingredients were weird and the  technique, too: there is no way you could satisfactorily brown that much chicken in one skillet at one time.  It was just nothing special. Won't be repeating.

I make this recipe all the time! I don't have vinegar and I use chicken tenders. I also use crushed tomatoes. I put the chicken and sauce over angel hair and it's so fantastic! As a matter of fact, I'm making it tonight! Way easy and delicious!

This was incredible.  When my husband says "you can do this one again" means it was REALLY good.  Thanks for sharing!! (I left out the hot pepper sauce because I have bad heartburn so I don't know what the difference would have been other than it was GREAT without it!!)  It smells wonderful too while cooking it!!!

This recipe was AHH-Mazing.  It's a keeper and a sleeper, meaning, that it is even better the next day.  I followed the recipe exactly as written (I always try to the first time I make any dish). My only suggestions have been noted by many other reviewers: 1. DOUBLE the sauce and 2. No need to bread the chicken (a personal carb reduction preference).  Served over rice, this was completely yummy!.

I was a bit skeptical because the ingredients didn't sounds like they would go well together but man this was amazing!!! The only change I made was that I coated the chicken in bread crumbs and browned it in olive oil. DO NO CHANGE THE INGREDIENTS TO THE SAUCE! It is awesome, my super picky son gobbled it up! 5 stars all the way!

Fantastic!  I really can’t find the words to describe this or even begin to to pinpoint the flavor other than to say that it is uniquely delicious.   It has a little sweetness to it, but it also has a spicy kick.  I was worried that my husband wasn’t going to like it.  Turns out he loved it!  The best part is dipping the French bread in the sauce.   This is a recipe that will go into our regular meal rotation.

This recipe was really delicious. I am only cooking for one, so I had a lot of leftovers. The chicken was delicious with brown rice and pasta, and was really good even when reheated.

I made this recipe a few days ago ... since my family and I don't like spicy foods at all.. I left the chili powder and hot sauce out... I wasnt sure how it would turn out.. but to my surprise it was super delicious! Husband gave the recipe a 9 out of a 10... he never gives me a 10 (he's afraid if he gives me a 10 I would stop cooking lol)... so it's basically a 10! Would make again for sure! Thnx

We loved this recipe and I'll definitely make it again!  I took some of the advice in the comments and used chicken broth in place of the water, and added about 1/4 c of red wine for another layer of flavor.  It's nice because you add the hot seasoning at the end to your family's taste.

I would rate it higher except I don't use canned sauces. I used a homemade marinara sauce.  No water or salt added, except I didn't have celery seed so used a little celery salt instead. My sauce was a little spicy to start with so I didn't add any hot sauce. Delish! Definitely a keeper!

What a delightful recipe! Lots of interesting ingredients, but the prep is simple because it doesn't require any chopping. The flavor is incredible. I substituted chicken broth for the water and skipped the hot sauce because I don't like spicy. I forgot to 'flour' the chicken before I browned it it the butter, but it was still perfect! This will become a regular in our house plus a great company dish!

My husband said "this is a keeper recipe".   I asked him what rating and he said very high, which is why I gave it 5 stars.    

The only minor change I made was substituting 1 T olive oil for one of the tablespoons of butter, so it would have a higher smoke point for cooking.   I tend to use too high of a temp for butter.

I wouldn't change a thing in the spices or quantities as we felt that the sauce was nicely balanced.   I served it over jasmine rice with a side of broccoli.

Mmmm Mmmm!  This turned out to be one delicious meal.  I sauteed an onion in the pan after removing the chicken, and added the sauce ingredients to that same pan to simmer.  I used chicken broth instead of water and diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I absolutely loved the flavor of this dish and I will definitely be making this again.

This was amazing. I read a few reviews and made some changes. I cubed the chicken. Added prepared mustard instead. I also added onion and bell pepper at the end. 
I also added a 1/4 cup of red wine and used chicken broth instead of water.  This was served with brown rice. I will be making this again for sure!

Absolutely fabulous.  I used a parmesan cheese chicken coating that I bought for another recipe.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes seasoned with oregano and garlic.  We will definitely be having this again for dinner in the future. Next time will use chicken broth in place of the water (as others recommended).

I made this recipe last night, and we all loved it.  The only change I made was that I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed...that's what I had on hand, and, based on reviews, I figured it would be fine. I agree with those reviews...the resulting dish was definitely sweet enough.  The whole meal was a delightful combination of spicy and sweet, not too much of either.  I agree that it really reminds me of Cuban flavors I've enjoyed in Miami.  Over rice, it was a perfect, DIFFERENT, AND DELICIOUS chicken dinner.

Lots of flavor in this--mine ended up somewhat sweet and spicy, due to a probably excess of cajun pepper.  Regardless, it hit that perfect point where something is noticeably spicy, but not too spicy that people can't eat it.  In fact, it just kept disappearing every time I looked over at the pan...

Great stuff :)

Love this recipe.  It can be cooked in skillet or in the oven.  Turns out great either way.  Always use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and splenda instead of sugar, turns out great.

A lot of different flavors going on in this recipe, but just a bit too sweet for my tastes.  I mixed up the sauce ingredients in the morning, put in the fridge, and this made dinner preparation even easier.  The sauce thickened to a nice consistency that would have been great over some noodles.   In the future, I will cut back the brown sugar, but definitely will make this again.

I made this dish last night on a whim and I'm so glad I did! It was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend was so impressed and asked me to make this again sometime! He's the fussiest eater, and he hasn't said that about anything else I've experimented with. The flavors were wonderful, the chicken was so juicy and tender! I made a couple changes to the recipe based on other reviews. Instead of using water I used red cooking wine, and also substituted the vinegar for white cooking wine. I used only 1 tsp of chili powder, instead of 2. I'm glad I did otherwise I think it would have overpowered the other flavors. I also used a can of organic diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I didn't have any celery seed on hand, so I substituted with celery salt. I added red onion cut in rounds once the sauce came to a boil, replaced the chicken, and added the rest of the onion on top and around the chicken. It smelled fantastic while it was cooking! I made a cheesy hash brown casserole as a side, however the flavors were too rich together. In the future I'll probably opt for a green bean or asparagus side dish, and maybe saffron rice. I will definitely be making this dish throughout the years to come!!

Good.  Almost like a sweet and sour chicken.  I didn't have mustard powder or celery seed, so I just added a tsp of brown mustard.  I used 2 chicken breasts and a whole can of tomatoes still.  Very tender chicken, and a tasty sauce.

Outstanding! I had everything on hand and did not need to alter it. The savory flavor with the mild sweetness has a taste all its own. Not bbq, not sauerbraten, not teriyaki. You have to try for yourself to know what I mean. Out of this world delicious.

Absolutely amazing dish. Everyone loved it! It went really well with oven-roasted asparagus and white rice. I did use "fire-roasted" canned tomatoes instead of the regular ones and it was very flavorful!

I never get sick of this recipe! My boyfriend and I love it so much that we have it weekly. I agree that red wine should she substituted for half of the water called for. Also I cook it with the lid on for 30 min. and then remove the lid for the last 10 minutes so that the sauce can thicken up a bit. Caution, because this will leave you with less sauce but a more intense taste. Bon apetit!

I'd been looking for something barbecue-y for chicken. I was feeling lazy so browned the breasts in olive oil with no flour and used garlic powder in place of clove. Added white wine instead of water because everything tastes better in wine, in my opinion. At the suggestion of others used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and halved the chili powder. This is a nice combination of spices and no one spice overshadows the others.

Other than to change the 1/2 cup water to 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup red wine, I made no changes. We loved this.

After a few minor tweaks in the recipe, my family of picky eaters all agreed that this was a good recipe. First, instead of celery seed, I used one stalk of celery, roughly chopped.Also, not having stewed tomatoes on hand, I use a can of chopped tomatoes instead. Finally, I cut the butter out altogether, using olive oil. After that, the recipe came out wonderful!

I have made this part of my weekly meal plan it's so good! 
The only modification I make is adding half of an onion (chopped) and I top each breast with a slice of swiss when I serve it. It's an amazingly good dinner!

Quite tasty & even my picky kids liked it!  Changes were based on other reviews & ingredient availability: 1) Subbed fire roasted diced tomatoes for stewed. 2) subbed Teriyaki sauce for half of the Worcestershire required because I ran out 3) Reduced fat by browning chicken using a light drizzle of olive oil in electric skillet instead of frying in butter on stovetop 4) Omitted hot sauce & let it be added at the table, as my kids don't like spicy-hot food.  5) Subbed Splenda brown sugar, using half the recommended amount.  6) doubled the sauce to chicken ratio, as it boils down quite a bit.  Very moist, flavorful chicken dish that was a pleasant break from the same-old routine.  Try this one, you will like it!

It was tasty but I probably won't make it again. It tasted a lot like BBQ sauce, and I have a much easier and tastier baked BBQ chicken recipe. Maybe adding wine as some other reviewers suggested would have made for a more interesting flavor.

Easy to prepare. I did not flour the chicken before browning and I substituted red wine for the water. I think it needs some tweaking - the next time I think I will try small pieces of chicken so the flavor could penetrate the chicken more

This was an awesome recipe! I had every ingredient with the exception of the brown sugar.  

I read through the reviews, which is always helpful, prior to cooking it up to look for any tips or suggestions that would sound good.  I did read one review that stated they substituted the brown sugar with honey, which was so clever, especially since I didn't have any brown sugar on hand.  I also, don't care for stew tomatoes as I'm not a fan of large chunks of tomatoes in any of my dishes, I rather prefer to have small pieces so that there is a piece of tomato in every bite, so I opted for a can of diced tomatoes.

Since chicken breasts, have the issue of being thick on one side and slender on another, I decided to slice three chicken breasts in half lengthwise, to get a thinner cut of chicken breasts so that they would cook evenly and so I would also have the six pieces as is suggested with the original recipe.  I paired the chicken recipe with rice, and cooked the rice in a little bit of chicken broth, smothered the Chicken Pierre over the rice on each persons plate and added a side of broccoli to finish the plates, and the family loved it! 

There was just a hint of spice, as the honey was a nice pairing in the recipe to give it a good balance.  My 2 year old even loved it! That should tell you, that its really not that spicy.  This will be included in my rotation. :)

I make this in a slow cooker. I simply eliminate the flour step. Throw it all into the slow cooker for 4-6 hours. When its done, just shred the chicken and put it back in the 'cooker for a 1/2 hour while waiting for some pasta to cook. Ta Da! Done. :)

Pretty good, given the relatively small amount of time and effort required to prepare. I replaced the water with chicken broth and left everything else as is.

Great flavors! The only thing I didn't like (which may have just been my own problem) is that the coating on the chicken didn't stay on when I added it back to the tomatoes to simmer.  Other than that, it was great!  My husband LOVED it and asked me to cook it again with okra.  For him, the flavors reminded him of a dish his Grandmother used to prepare...

Made this with half the salt in the flour and no additional salt in the sauce.  It was excellent!  Before adding the chicken, the sauce had a strong vinegar taste, but after it was done, the flavor was outstanding!  One note, I only simmered for 30 mins, but could have cut 5 mins off.

Very good.  We diced our chicken first, before coating and pan frying in olive oil.  As others suggested, we added onions to the sauce; 1/4 c. of green onions is what we had on hand and I thought it worked well.  Since the chicken pieces were smaller, we only simmered for about 20 minutes at the end. Served over rice.  Will make again.

The whole family enjoyed this! It is a healthy version of a bbq flavored chicken. The only change would be to drain most of the fat before adding the tomatoes, etc. We also used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter and used whole wheat flour...this made it a little healthier to fit our lifestyle.

This was fantastic. I made 3 minor changes as follows: sub'd 1/2 C red wine for the water, decreased chilli powder to 1 teaspoon and when I turned my chicken over to brown the other side I slice an onion ontop of the breasts. When the chicken was done I took the breasts out, left the onion and added the rest of the ingredients. I served this with my orzo/rice that I make. For that, I brown 1/3 cup of each rice and orzo in two tablespoons of butter, when slightly brown I add a carton of chicken stock and simmer until done. This makes a fast and yummy meal, Thanks for sharing!

This was fabulous! I didn't have the chili powder, mustard powder (was going to mustard but then forgot), or the celery seed (used celery salt instead). I will definitely make this again!

I loved this, but more importantly, my HUSBAND loved this! He HATES chicken! I made it as written and he ate it up! I always half my breasts so that it isn't such a large hunk of meat.

A different, tasty flavor. Yum! A little sweet but not overly BBQ-ish. We loved it with noodles.

This recipe was very easy and full of flavor.  I did half the chili powder to please my husband. I used a can of chopped tomatoes with onion and garlic and served this over brown rice.
Great recipe I will make it again.

It was a nice change for a way to cook chicken.  Nice sauce to put over rice. My parents loved it, which is a surprise for my dad.  Make sure you cook the chicken well before taking out of the pan.  I cut the chicken breast into small cubes.

I made this dish last night for my husband, daughter and bf and myself.  All I can say is it was a complete hit and the men wanted the leftovers in their lunch the next day.  I served it over rice and followed his exact recipe.  The flavors are such a nice blend of tangy, spicy, sweet and salty!  Everybite to the last was pure joy!  This is a lifelong addition to my dinner menu!

Awesome!!!!!! Very juicy chicken. Everybody loved it. I used fresh tomoteos instead of in the can. The sauce was really good and a lot was made. I used about 4 medium tomatoes. Removed skin and diced. Yam !!!!

Excellent!  Was looking for a chicken recipe where I could use the many tomatoes from my garden and glad I came upon this one.  The first time I try a recipe I always make it exactly as presented and than tweak accordingly to our tastes.  With this recipe, I wouldn't change a thing!  It was perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this taste treat delight!

Delicious! I had 2 large chicken breasts. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and 1 1/2 tomatoes I scrounged up from the plant and freezer. I didn't have worcestershire, threw in 1 Tbsp of steak sauce for the heck of it. No celery seed either. I used a little oil in my skillet and just 1 Tbs of butter. I also threw in some frozen yellow pepper strips to up the vegetable consumption.  This was barely enough sauce for my 2 large (chicken) breasts. I didn't add any hot pepper sauce, wasn't sure what it was and my daughter can't handle too much spiciness. Very yummy.

I made this JUST for myself one evening, when I was craving some protein! Wow, I love the sweetness from the brown sugar and the hint of spicy from the chili powder. I love this recipe! I've got to make it for my family now. This would even be good if you stuffed the chicken with the tomatoes rather than just covering it with it.

I really enjoyed this. I did do a few minor things differently. I pounded my breasts, used chicken broth instead of water, added onions cut into rings on top of my chicken, and only used 1 teaspoon of chili powder. Turned out great and would make again!!

Tasted very good if you like sweetness in the chicken.  I used fresh tomatoes and skipped the chili/mustard powder as well as celery seed.  Next time I will skip coating the chicken in flour, I think it would taste great cooking in the sauce alone - less caloric too!

One of my faves, thanks for the recipe! I always throw in onions when I'm browning the chicken, and add any available veggies to the sauce. Super flexible, easy, and delicious.

We both liked this, but I did follow others suggestions n added the onion n doubled the Tabasco. Next time I may eliminate the tomatoes, n double the mustard. Not too hot, but balanced the sweetness of the brown sugar. May add some cream, too

Fantastic meal, very simple to make. No leftovers :  (
As far as the recipe, I stewed my owned tomatoes and used half the amt of chili powder, I used Grey Poupon mustard as an alternative. The breasts came out very tender and I served with steamed brocolli and tri-color pasta with EVOO and fresh pepper. Defintely a keeper. Bon appetit

YUM! I was a little leery on this because it kind of seemed like I was throwing the whole pantry in the dish but hey I didn't have to go to the store so I was happy!  I made the sauce a few hours ahead of time and let it all marinate together in the fridge - I made it a little sweeter and a little spicier than the recipe, and also added Grey Poupon and it turned out fabulous!  Sweet, spicy, tangy and full of flavor!  We served it with whole grain pasta and creamed spinach and both went back for seconds!  My hubby said 3 times how much he liked it!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Nancy!

My husband is a picky eater, but I thought that I'd give this recipe a try because it sounded so good. I've made it several times now and he can't get enough of it! It was perfect, served over rice or with mashed potatoes. Definitely a keeper!

Don't think I will be making again.  Just wasn't a fan of the sweetness in the sauce.

This was absolutely delicious! My husband kept saying, "mmmmm" he couldn't help it! The only thing I changed was that I used diced tomatoes and roasted garlic red wine vinegar. Other than that I followed the recipe, I made roasted potatoes with and some roasted asparagus. YUM! Although there was plenty of sauce left over so it would really work over rice :) Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Sauce was good. Need to brown the chicken hotter next time. Also used white wine instead of water.

My husband and I loved this. Only changes I made was balsamic vinegar instead of white and only about 2 tablespoons butter but added olive oil. Didn't make a starch and used a loaf of french bread and salad to accompany the meal.  Delish!!

This is really good, I used regular mustard as I don't have the powder and it was awsome. Definantely reccmoned this. I made it with some white rice and basmati, both are great.

Everyone liked this even our picky eater.   Not to hard to make but a little messy (or maybe that is my cooking style).  This has made it into our favorites!

I can't say I'll be making this again. It tasted better then it looked and the chicken was tender. However, the overall taste was not worth repeating.

I followed the recipe directions exactly, the only change was adding slices of red onion.  The chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauce had a nice flavor, I served it over the chicken and brown rice.  I can't say it's going to be a new "favorite", but it is a dish I will cook again.

Hmm..followed recipe almost exactly..decided to add a diced onion and green pepper to the tomato mixture but even that didn't impart any flavor.  This was bland as bland can be.  Can't figure out where these 4-5 star ratings came from. 

Then again, that's why recipes are posted and tried, to see if they are any good.  Sorry but this was seriously lacking in flavor...I've deleted it from my recipe box.  Thankfully, the ingredients didn't cost me a fortune.

Awesome!   I made this with chicken drumsticks as was more budget friendly than breasts. Then I halved the amount of chicken but made the same amount of sauce and with the skin on the drumsticks melding into the sauce made for  nice sticky sauce atop white rice.  This sauce would be great for pork ribs.

Absolutely delicious! Made it tonight for the first time and it was a big hit with my family. I only cooked it for about 30 minutes after browning, turned out just right. Recommend combining it with another tomato based dish, I made Provencal green beans with tomatoes, excellent combination.

GREAT RECIPE!  I was looking for a new recipe to try with some chicken breasts I wanted to use up.  I was excited to find I had almost all the ingredients on hand.  I only had to substitue the mustard powder with real mustard (used stone ground).  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain too.  My husband RAVED about this recipe to my delight, and I loved it too.  I served it over white rice as some other reviewers had suggest and it was fantastic.  I am making it again tonight and am going to try it over some pasta.

Definitely will be doubling the sauce ingredients next time. The chicken was moist with a great flavor, but I was really looking forward to sopping up those sauces, and didn't have any extra in my pan.

My family loved the sauce. I didn't change a thing other than using boneless chicken thighs rather than breasts. I find thighs more moist, tender and tastier than breasts. This will join my list of favorite recipes. Thank you Nancy

This meal was very easy to prepare. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, cooked the chicken a bit less (based on the breast thickness) and had with some whole wheat pasta. Yum!

This was very good!  I had fresh and very ripe campari tomatoes, so I used 15 oz. of them instead of the canned stewed tomatoes.  I par-boiled them to remove the skins, and made up a stewed tomato dish of my own (added celery, onion, garlic, etc.).  Then proceeded with the recipe as shown.  Will definitely make this again!

I really liked the blend of seasonings. Sort of a spicy sweet flavor. Only reason I added other ingredients was that I wanted more than just a sauce with tomatoes. I sliced the chicken and cooked it without the flour as I did not want to take the time to do it that way, and added in the extra salt and pepper to the sauce. I used baby bella mushrooms, onions and a splash of red wine. Tasted great over rice. Thanks for the recipe. Will use it again.

I saw this recipe on here several years ago and have been making it since, it is one of our favorite chicken dishes.  I made it just as it is here with one exception, I omit the hot pepper sauce. It is definitely the best chicken recipe I have gotten from this site.

Really delicious !! Not too sweet, just enough of a zip. I added some extra garlic. I didn't have hot pepper sauce so I used buffalo chicken sauce. And I didn't have Worcestershire so I added some soy sauce, a pinch of cloves, and a bit more vinegar. So tasty. My husband who is not a big chicken fan loved it !! I will keep this recipe as a favorite. Thank you Nancy.

This was the simplest, most excellent chicken dish.  I, like some others, was surprised at the amount of flavor in it.  My husband really liked it.  As it was cooking, I smelled a lot of the chili powder so I was worried it would be spicy (I love spice but the husband does not), but it was perfect.  This will be a staple in house!

Delicious! So different, yet so tasty. My husband actually said HE wanted to learn how to make this since he liked it so much. Followed the recipe with the exception of the celery seed- I didn't have any. Also, per another reviewer's recommendation, I cut back slightly on the chili powder. I will defnitely make this again, but I will cut back on the chili powder. I believe 1 teaspoon would be plenty. Oh, and I didn't have hot sauce so I used a small pinch of cayanne. What a wonderful and unexpected recipe. Thank you!

I loved it, but i modified it a bit. I added about 1 cup of heavy cream to the pan(actually used a high sided pot 10") and also used chicken breast tenderloins. Breaded it the same and used more hot sauce and more chili powder. Adding the cream definitely called for more spice. Also added some garlic powder and served over rice that was boiled in 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water. Very good.

I rarely ever rate anything ( I dont think I ever have actually) but this was wonderful.  I made one change but only because I didnt have any celery seed everything else was the same.  It was different and my husband loved it.  He is one to not prefer chicken.  When my husband does eat it he always adds ketchup or hot sauce.  This time he added nothing.  I paired it with egg noodles ( I didnt have any rice) a green salad and cheese bread) we overate because it was wonderful!!! I will DEFINATELY make again.  Thank you for adding.

Great family dinner-- even our fussy 7-year-old loves it. I add two tablespoons of lemon juice to the sauce.

My husband does not do well with new recipies, but when I made this, he raved about it.  I made it on Wednesday, he ate the leftovers on thursday, and now its friday and he wants it tonight again.  Wonderful recipe, sauce had unique flavor, does not taste italian (we are not crazy about italian food).  The only change I'll make this time is to add a little less sugar. Its a real winner !!!

Great recipe - had all ingredients on hand!  

My changes based on family preferences (there is nothing wrong with this recipe as written, however). --  1.  Quadrupled the breading mix because I wanted a good crispy coating (used more margarine when sauteeing because of this); 2.  Cut chicken breasts into wide strips (cooks faster and browns easily); 3.  Used almost a whole 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes (pureed them somewhat with my immersion blender because kids think they don't like tomatoes); 4.  Substituted red wine vinegar for white distilled vinegar.  5.  Kept chicken warm in oven while assembling sauce.  6.  Only simmered the chicken/sauce about 15-20 minutes instead of 25-40 minutes (because the chicken was already done).

It ended up looking like Chinese food - similar in appearance to hot braised boneless chicken with red chili sauce.  However, Chicken Pierre tastes less spicy and much fresher, and no msg!  Very kid and parent-friendly.

This was amazing! The only thing I did different was leave out the hot sauce because 2 kids were going to eat it...and I think it was still great without it. And the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we could have used a little more flour mixture to coat the chicken. Otherwise, this was great! My 12yo went back for seconds and my picky 14yo ate it with no complaints! Thanks!

This recipe turned out fantastic! The chicken was really moist and the sauce had the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I have a feeling my husband will be requesting this one often :)

Very good.  I made it as directed except that I added a little onion sliced.  Very handy recipe as most things are generally to hand in the kitchen. I served it with rice.

I was searching for a healthy chicken recipe and was hoping to find one that included everything i had on hand. I found it here! I cooked this in the crock pot and used a large can of diced tomatoes and used the tips from others and cut the chili powder in half and instead of water used chicken broth and instead of vinager used cooking sherry. i did use a little bit extra of everything for extra broth. cooked on high for 4 hours and it was tender juicy and healthy! i did not use any salt because of the content in the sherry.

I made this tonight and every person in my family raved!! The kids 13, 7, and 4 said it was amazing and please make it again tomorrow. Husband said it was great. Didn't add the hot sauce because of the kids and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Went perfectly with noodles. This one will absolutely be made again. We are also thinking of trying it with pork cutlets.

It was so easy to make and fast, I made a few adjustments after reading  suggestions.  I chopped onions the more the better if you like it with onions  ( circles ) for a couple of minutes and then added 1/2 cup of white wine  for 3 minutes .  and then added the canned tomatoes,sugar and spices. and at the last maybe 5 minutes i added sliced mushrooms !!! If you want more of sauce just add chicken stock or water and then to thicken it up corn starch to cold water and add at the end depending how thick you like it.  salt and pepper to your taste.

I made this in the crock-pot.  Browned the chicken,added all the other ingredients to the skillet to get the taste from the cooking,  then put it in the  crockpot for 6 hours.   When it was ready, I put the chicken on a platter to set for 5 min, while I mixed some flour and 1/4 C water to thicken sauce.       It was wonderful!!

I personally found this recipe too sweet and it has a rather odd flavor..but my g/f really liked it. I didn't like that the nice crunchy coating on the chicken turns to mush in the sauce but since she liked it, I will be making it again but with less sugar and Worcestershire sauce.

Made no change to the recipe other than holding back on the chili powder. Found the dish to be mostly tasteless even though it had all those herbs and spices. Didn't add water as the juice from the stewed tomatoes made more than enough liquid. The only consolation - low calorie..

It was ok...I guess I was expecting something different...I would've put more hot pepper sauce I guess because it seemed like it needed to be more spicy.

Amazing!!! Everyone loved it.  I used red wine instead of the water and a little more worcestershire sauce.  It tastes even better the next day!!!

Haven't found a chicken recipe my husband likes....Until THIS!  He actually craves this.  If it can please a meat and potatoes Texan, at least give it a shot.  I get frisky with spices and that makes things more exciting!

WOW-this was great. Used 1/2 the flour and some cornflake crumbs as the breading. 1 Tbsp of butter and some olive oil. 1/4 water and 1/4 red wine as mentioned by others - added Italian seasonings. Served over rice - awesome the next day as leftovers too. Kid approved.

This is an awesome recipe.  It has great flavor and texture to it.  We like the chicken on pasta but it might go a bit beeter with rice.  Our favorite way to eat is in a wrap with mozza cheese and some lettuce!  I used cooked chicken to speed things up.  So it all goes into the pan and simmers down for 45 minutes.  The chicken comes out nice and tender.  Don't hesitate to try this one.

It was okay. I would make it again. That is way too much sugar, maybe a teaspoon. I added some basil and other Italian seasonings.

This was pretty good.  I had chicken breasts I had to use up and had everything for the recipe on hand so I gave it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  I ate it over white rice.

This was very flavorful and unique!  I added just a tad of cinnamon to it, and it tasted great.  My husband wasn't a fan, but it could have been because of the cinnamon.  I also used crushed tomatoes for a consistency more of my liking. Overall, a great recipe.  Served over pasta and wouldn't have done it any other way!

turned out yummy, even my 7 yr old likes it! I would be interested in making a thicker sauce, or adding a bit more flavor. But all in all it was a success.

This is fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was to sautee the chicken breasts in olive oil and I did not bread them.  I also added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce at the end because it was not really thick enough for my liking.  Delicious flavor-a big hit in my house!!

very good dish. I omitted the pepper sauce but used ground arbol chili  powder which made it VERY hot. If you like hot and spicy use the powder. It would have been perfect with just plain chili powder. I served it over white rice.

This was absolutely excellent and is definitely now a favorite in our house.  The only changes I made were using a larger can of stewed tomatoes, a half a cup more water and a good 1/2 of red wine.  It was fabulous!

We liked this. I gave it four stars because not sure how often I would make. Kind of time intensive (more so than a regular spaghetti sauce). Did remind me of something Cuban. I made the recipe pretty much as is, but would definitely agree with other reviewers that veggies in this would be great!

This recipe has become a household favorite.  Its delicious following the recipe although I never have celery seed and basic enough you can put your own preferences into it.  The best part I think is it that is uses pantry staples.  Its great over penne with some hearty Italian or garlic bread.

I made this last night and the family loved it, even my picky daughter... I did make a few adjustments. I used whole peeled tomatoes in puree, 28 oz can. I sliced the tomatoes. I added onion and lots of sliced mushrooms. I also added a few capers which goes with any chicken meal and crushed red pepper. This meal was great.

I tried this per the recipe and it was okay but felt it needed a crunch factor. So the second time I tried it I raided the garden. I added some diced white onion, bell pepper and a little okra.

Awesome!  And once you have the spices in your cupboard, all you need is chicken and a can of tomatoes on hand to pull this one off. Use the leftovers for tacos the next night and it's a whole different meal!  Not like leftovers at all!

i also added onion, used diced tomatoes, omitted the hot sauce and was forced to use garlic powder and whole wheat flour ... and this was still delicious. the whole family enjoyed it, and i'm sure i'll make it again.

I sauteed half of a large yellow onion (sliced) after the chicken and used petite diced tomatoes and red wine instead of water.  Very good.  ETA: I think next time I make this, I am going to skip the flouring. I think it gives a tiny bit of a slimy texture to the chicken in the finished dish (not a huge issue, but I won't miss it).  We absolutely LOVE this and it has become something that I make frequently.

I used red wine in place of water, Splenda in place of the brown sugar and canned tomatoes with hot peppers so I didn't add the hot sauce. I did not add the vinegar or celery powder because I didn't have any. The recipe was a great hit. I think the sauce would be good with a wide variety of meat. Thank you, its a keeper!

Delicious!!  It had such a wonderful and unexpected flavor.  I was very liberal with the hot sauce, but think it would have been just as tasty at a lower level of heat.

This was "OK." I made half the recipe for my bf and I this past Saturday. My friend made this for me a while ago, and I thought it was good. I kept in my recipe box so that I could make it myself sometime. Either my memory of this dish is inaccurate or my tastes have changed because I didn't care for this very much at all (and neither did my bf)....  I followed Nancy's directions to a T, except for halving the recipe, keeping the sauce proportions for 6 servings and subbing Italian stewed tomatoes for plain ones. At the last minute, I noticed that I only had two chicken breasts, but everything else was to scale. I followed Shoangore's suggestion to serve each breast over spaghetti with a lemon slice and fresh parsley sprig for garnish. I steamed some fresh asparagus to serve on the side. French bread completed the meal (we dunked slices in the remaining sauce). This was satisfying, but not something that I'd make again (the bf agrees). My bf thinks this is similar to braised balsamic chicken by MOONANDBACK, but I disagree - that recipe is much better!!! Thanks anyways!

This was one of the best chicken recipes I have tried in a long time.  I did follow a couple suggestions from reviewers.  I did use chicken broth instead of water and I also very quickly sauted some red onion in the pan before cooking the sauce.  Just long enough for them to soften a little.  Next time I make this I will also double the recipe for the sauce.  I served it over rice and my husband and I like extra sauce when eating rice.  If I made this for company, I think I might even triple the recipe.  Thank you for posting this!  This was very delicious!

Oh My  Goodness.  This recipe was absolutely amazing.  I actually only used one chicken breast half, and it was perfect like that.  Bothy my bf and I had seconds, and finished up the whole batch.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you so much for the amazing recipe!!!  YUM.

Wow!  This was really tasty, just enough tang to make it truly unique.  I just did a couple of things differently, my husband and I are not fans of tomato chunks so I liquified the canned tomatoes in the blender (there was no need to add the water that was called for as this made it liquidy enough).  I also added a splash of white wine.  The Chicken was soooo tender in here, oh and I added Mushroom.  I will definitely make this one again i'm just trying to think how I might be able to thiken it up a little.  I'm even considering adding this with my reg sauce next time I make a lasagna just to give it a different taste.  Thanks for the Recipe!

Excellent quick dish. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts for added flavor. It took only 20 minutes of cooking instead of 45 minutes mentioned in the recipe.

Delicious!  I didn't have any chili powder, so I left it out.  Turned out great!  I should also mention that I used red wine instead of water.

This was very good!  My husband (picky eater) went back for seconds.  I followed the directions exactly. Except I used 2 chicken breasts and all the sauce.  After the chicken breasts were browned, I cut them up into chunks.  We had it over rice.  Yummy!

This tasted kind of weird to us. We couldn't decide if it was Italian, BBQ, or Mexican, or whatever! Also had kind of a sweet aftertaste. I followed recipe exactly except for halving the chile powder as others suggested (and I'm glad that I did because it was still spicy). This was very simple to make and edible, but I probably won't make again.

My husband prepared this tonight according to the recipe and it was excellent.  We served it over white rice which complimented it well.  this recipe has a slight "kick" to it, which we loved.  It was very comforting on a cold winter night in the Midwest!  We will definately make this again, maybe we'll try some of the suggested alternative ingredients.

This recipe is really really great.  I double the sauce because I'm a saucy person.  My boyfriend loves it.  I make it over both rice and pasta, depending non the mood I'm in.  A really great unique recipe that I highly recommend.

My husband and I love this dish. He is always asking for it. I do use white wine instead of water. Also, I serve it over homemade lemon basil basmanti rice (cook the rice and add some fresh choppped basil,lemon juice, and zest). WOW! Delish!

Delicious! Left out the water and celery salt. Added chili paste instead of hot sauce. Next time I'll reduce the vinegar a bit but otherwise a fabulous dish my family enjoys.

I found this recipe about 3 years ago on this site.  My family loves it and I even use it for company.  It is always tasty and popular.  I do double the sauce, as my family likes more sauce for the noodles.  I also use petite diced tomatoes instead of the stewed because my kids will eat the smaller pieces.  Everything else I keep the same.  It has such a great taste.

This was good - not amazing, but good.  If I could, I would give it 4 1/2 stars.  I will make again, but not all the time.  It was very easy.

Delicious!  Ingredients sound odd, but come together realy nicely, so much better than I'd expected.  Only thing I substituted was vegetable broth for water, turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe..

This is a very good recipe.  The sauce has many layers of flavor.  We used chicken thighs rather than breasts simply because we like thighs better. Like so many others, we doubled the sauce recipe, added onion and cut the chili powder in half.  We replaced the water with broth. All agreed that we will be making this recipe again.

What a tasty meal! This sweet, spicy and tangy tomato chicken was perfect. I used a little more brown sugar to offset the vinegar. I also served with rice instead of pasta but im sure its good either way.

Excellent!!! I doubled the sauce for 1.25 pounds of chicken tenderloins. (Probably was a little too much sauce, but I would rather have too much). We ate it over brown rice "Gumbo Style" Excellent. Most moist chicken I have ever had! Great to have something the husband loves, but still under 9 points on Weight Watchers! I can't wait to try it with breasts over french bread!

Great!  Only substitution I made was instead of the "hot pepper sauce" I used approximately 1 Tbsp. of Franks Hot Sauce.  The flavor of Franks just seems better to me.  I served this with Orzo and we loved the meal.

Pretty good...  Hubby said tasted like ketchup, but I thought more like Manwich with chicken breast over rice, instead of with beef on a bun.  Always loved Manwich, so that's a good thing! haha We both liked it enough to make it again.  It would indeed be better with some onions and green pepper added, IMHO, and will do that next time.

I made this according to the recipe; the only change I made was to add an extra can of diced tomatos (since some reviews mentioned it could use more sauce).  I'll definitely be making this again!

This is really good!  I like it just the way it is. Well almost, I skip the hot sauce and double the recipe for more sauce.  A little spicey, a little sweet, a little tangy...yum!  Great over rice or served with mashed potatos.  Or spoon it over a baked potato for a less fatty version.  Thanks for sharing!

Not bad but not great either.  It was tastey and easy to make.  Only used 1 pan which is a bonus.  I served with rice, but I think I would like it better with egg noodles.  Not sure I would make it again.  It just wasn't my thing.  Thanks for sharing.

The sauce was very tasty - a different flavor than normal tomato based sauces. I made it using only 3 chicken breasts and didn't have nearly enough sauce going straight from the recipe. I would double the sauce for sure.

This was awsome. We are on a low calorie diet and it fit into our program perfectly. I have also tried this with Splenda brown sugar and could not tell the difference. I was very surprised to hear my 5 year old ask for more. I love this recipes as is (or with Splenda) and unless I am doing something wrong everyone seems ok with the spice level.

I loved loved loved this!! My family thought it was fantastic! The only changes I made was that I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have white vinegar, and I used celery salt instead of celery seed... I also reduced the chili power to 1 1/2 teaspoons. SOOOOOO good! I served with a parmesean romano rice.

I made this with one additional change of adding an onion and letting it stew along with the chicken...delish!  My daughter has even requested this for her birthday dinner!  The whole family loved it.

this was so good.  i thought maybe even worth 5 stars but polling the family the all said 4-4.5 this is the second time i have tried something from this site.  and i will continue to use it.  i did change a little bit when making the recipe,  i used half distilled vinegar and half basalmic. and i cut the chili powder in half.  i also let he chicken sit in the sauce for about 3 hours. after it was done and then just rewarmed it for dinner.  i think it added to the flavor the longer it " stewed "  i will be making this again, thankyou for the recipe.

We loved this! Easy for a weeknight. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with chilies. Little too spicy for the kids but the adults loved it!

Absolutely one of our favorites! We love stewed tomatoes so I add 2 cans, undrained, and leave out the add'l water.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was outstanding! There was an amazing depth to the flavor. I used only 3 boneless breasts with the full amount of sauce(which is so good I could eat it alone!). Next time I will serve bread to mop up the leftover sauce!

This ones a keeper. 5 stars with my changes. I halved the vinegar, worcesteshire and chili powder. All the flavors blended beautifully. Also used olive oil instead of butter. Next time I think I'll add a little cinnamon and a few raisins and serve with couscous. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is a staple in my house now. I always seem to have the ingredients on hand. When I became a vegetarian I started subbing chickpeas for the chicken and still tastes wonderful. I bet tofu would be great too. Thank you Nancy!

This recipe is great. I didn't change anything except I used diced tomatoes instead of whole stewed and it was wonderful. My husband asked for it twice in one week. I served it with homemade macaroni and cheese and a salad and it was an incredible meal. Thanks

Very good!  I served over white rice and doubled the sauce.  I cut back on the chili powder and hot sauce and it still had some "kick" to it.  Topped with some shredded cheddar cheese.  Yum Yum!

We liked it. I took the suggestions from other reviewers and used balsamic instead of white vinegar, used wine instead of water, and added sliced onion and a can of mushrooms. I also reduced the final simmering time. Low fat, low cal, and delicious!

I made this exactly as specified except I reduced cooking time by 10 minutes. This was absolutley delicious. My family loved how tender and moict the chicken was and it actually shredded apart when cutting it. This is a keeper. Very savory and lots of flavor.

My boyfriend wolfed this down in no time. I made a few adjustments... used crushed tomatoes, used 1/2 red wine, 1/2 water as suggested. I used white wine vinegar (that's what I had on hand), added sliced yellow pepper, 1/2 a jalapeno minced, a little minced savory, and some chopped dried red peppers that I had on hand. TASTY!

I really did not care for this recipe. I thought the vinegar overpowered the rest of the flavors, also I think the amount of chili powder called for is too much.

The vinegar taste in this was very strong. I agree with another reviewer who said it was a little bland. I'm not sure why, because with these spices it shouldn't be. I may try it again without the vinegar and try to kick it up some, but it won't be on a regular rotation.

Very good - this is a nice change of pace from the same old chicken every day. I followed others' advice and used 1/2 cup red wine plus I added a can of sliced mushrooms and a can of artichoke hearts. Very simple and the house smelled great. I will definitely make this again.

Five stars because my husband LOVES this! Modifications: 1/2 of liquid was red wine instead of water, added a bit of chopped onion, a few extra drops of Tabasco for a kick, and used fire roasted tomatoes as that was all I had on hand. Served with white rice. This will be made again soon!

Very dissapointing. I expected this recipe to have a little bit of kick to it. When I made it, it just tasted like chili, or tomatoes. If you do make this recipe, I advise that you add cayenne.

I liked it, but it was a little too spicy. I will probably cut down some of the chili powder next time since I skipped the hot sauce.

This had a wonderful sweet and tangy flavor and offered a different solution for chicken.  Simmering the chicken in liquid for an exteded amount of time always gives a tender cut and is never tough.  I served it with a small soup crock of homemade mac and cheese.  It was the perfect compliment.  Great for a cool crisp day.

This is fantastic!!  My husband loves it!  He doesn't usually remember the names of the different recipes I make but he specifically asks for this by name.  One of the best chicken dishes I have ever had.  My husband likes to add a few dashes of curry to make it taste like an Indian dish.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Wonderful!  The whole family, including the 18 month old, loved it.  I made a couple of changes:  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used a can of diced.  I omitted the celery seed, and used dijon mustard instead of the powder.  I will definately make it again.

Oh my gosh...this was the best recipe I have ever taken off of allrecipes... I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes and loved the flavor of the chunks.  I can see why they say to have a loaf of crusty bread to mop up every drop!!  Yowza!

Everybody loved this, chicken was tender, it is a little different, but that is why the men like it. The only problem I think needs to be mentioned is it is a little salty. Need to cut back on the sodium. Also, I did pound the chicken  with my rolling pin before I browned it. Very good flavor

Tastes just like bar-b-que chicken.  My honey said it tasted too much of celery too.  Not to my taste but I have to say the chicken was moist & tender.  Won't be making this again.

A good, quick, easy meal.  We liked the unique sweet, tangy flavor, and I liked how this meal doesn't cost a lot if you already have the spices on hand.  We will make this again.

This dish was recommended to me by a friend and I'm so glad she did!  It was wonderful!  I halved the recipe (except the stewed tomatoes - mine were sliced) and used 2 large breasts.  Fantastic!  Served over bow-tie pasta with spaghetti squash on the side.  I agree that the flavor doesn't seep into the chicken, but thought that was ok since I wanted to be able to serve it to my 13m old.  This way the chicken was tasty, but not too tangy for her.  Will make it again!

WOW!!!  I cut down on the Chili Powder and cut out the hot sauce since my picky 3 year old doesn't like anything spicy, and it was great.  I served it with the garlic-lemon green beans and french bread....Perfection on a plate!

We thought that the chicken had good flavor but the sauce wasn't impressive. It was a bit sour/bitter for our tastes. We will try this recipe again with a few modifications...maybe a bit more sugar and less chili pepper.

Awesome Easy Recipe!  I used a can of diced tomatoes rather than stewed.  And substituted the chili powder(I had run out of it) with a bit Epicure bean spice.  I served on wild rice with asparagus and salad.  My husband loved it and I will definately make it again!

Very good - definately would make again.  We left out the hot sauce because of the kids - it was a hit. Buttered bread was a great side for this, next time want to make with more sauce.

This was very good.  I used chicken breasts that were medium thickness so I only let them simmer in the sauce for about 15 minutes.  This is a keeper.

I thought this recipe was fabulous!  So easy it is hard to believe it would taste so good.  I did not have celery seed, but I don't think it was missed.  I served with noodles, but I think I would try it with rice next time and maybe double the sauce, because it was so good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I almost didn't make this 'cause all the different things in it seems sort of weird  and I'm not a fan of sweet and sour type stuff but let me tell you it was great! My  husband now asks for this all the time. The only thing I did different was use dijion mustard in place of the mustard powder because I just don't usually have it on hand.

very good recipe and very easy.  I served this over basmati rice which gave it a nice flavor enhancement.  It smelled wonderful cooking.  I had a little extra chicken breast already cooked so just added that near the end.  I also added a garnish of fresh chopped parsley.  I didn't add chili powder because I don't like the flavor of it.  Instead I used dried ground chili peppers (similar to cayenne.  I think this also would be good over egg noodles.

I needed something new to make for my boyfriend.  I love surprising him with new things.  He loved this recipe, and told me to keep it on hand.  I served it over rice; makes a nice combo with the chicken and sauce.

8/18/11 - I still have to say...I added this recipe to my recipe box almost 6 years ago, and whenever I make it, it is considered a treat at my house!  It has a lot of ingredients, and I've made some major adjustments with all the ingredients, but it is THE BEST chicken recipe that I have in the house...no, wait I is THE BEST recipe I have, period!  
Mmmmmm...my mouth is literally watering right now ( as it's simmering away on the stove), and I think I might just cry...that's how good it is!  Thank you so much for a great great recipe Nancy!  :)

Even with the long list of ingredients and simmering time, I regularly make this on weeknights because it is so easy to prepare. My family loves the sweet-sour barbecue flavor. It also works very nicely with boneless, skinless chicken thighs- the meat is so tender!

My husband loved this, but I thought it was just pretty good.  The sauce smelled heavenly while it was cooking, but it didn't end up tasting quite as good as it smelled.  I will make it again, though.  I did like that the chicken came out amazingly moist.  Maybe I can fiddle with the seasonings a bit and make it more to my liking.

This turned out awesome!!  Hubby loved it, as did our 3 year old, which is great!  The french bread idea was a great accompaniment as well.  Really easy to make and had a wonderful, almost bbq flavor which really impressed us.  Will definitely make again!!

Considering I used this recipe purely because I had all the ingredients on hand, I was shocked at how incredible it was! I used only 3 ck breasts halves, and the sauce was just enough; I would have to double the sauce for more chicken. I only needed to cook the ck with the sauce an additional 15 minutes, or so. Only major change was using red wine rather than water, as a review suggested. Thanks for this easy, delish recipe!

I have been cooking this recipe for almost a year now. And I have tweaked it to my families prefs.  I add a small amount of chopped garlic to the butter for browning(about 4 min. on both sides)adds nice flavor! I use two cans of italian stewed tomatoes( my husband prefers thinner sauce for dipping). I use red wine vinegar. Simmer for 20 min. and the chicken comes out great every time. I have 4 boys so a timer is a must.  Everything else is the same, and it is a favorite!

My husband loved it.  He gave this recipe a 5 star review.  I was not fond of the way the "browned" chicken got a bit soggy when it was cooked in the juices.  The flavor was great though.

It would have been wonderful except that my husband cooked it and forgot that the chili powder we get over here is a LOT hotter than is normal in the US!  The flavour was great but it was painfully hot to eat.  I'll cook it next time......!

I absolutely LOVED this!!! (I'm going to give it 5 stars even though I did play around with the seasonings until the sauce was how I liked it) As usual, I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and browned them in olive oil, then added some finely chopped onion. I was a bit leery of the vinegar, but it truly made all the difference. I also added some canned tomato sauce little by little as the sauce reduced and needed more liquid. I served it over angel hair pasta. Delicious! Thanks so much, Nancy!

Really tasty.  Nice change from the same old tomato sauce.  I substituted celery salt for regular salt and only used a half teaspoon.  Also did chicken broth instead of water.

Sooooo gooood.  I never had anything like this before.  A week later and my husband is still raving about it.  I am going to make it again Monday as a Valentines present for him.  Very tasty.  The only change I made was to use Balsamic vinegar instead of white.  Excellent recipe.

Really tasty.  I ended up using 1 tsp each of celery salt and garlic powder (personal preference) and used a large can of crushed tomatoes (the kids won't eat lumps of tomato).  When the chicken had finished cooking in the sauce I removed the chicken to a plate and whisked in 1/2 cup of heavy cream then stirred in approx 4 cups of macaroni that had already been cooked and then layed the chicken on the top.  It had a delicious creamy tomato taste with just enough zing.  I served it with a green salad and it made a great meal.  I used a total of 4 medium-large skinless boneless breasts which I cut into 4 chunks each.  I will probably skip the flour coating next time and just saute the chicken quickly in the butter without it, maybe the flour helps to thicken the sauce if you are just using stewed tomato's but the crushed tomato's mixed later with the cream made for a perfect consistency (no need to thicken).  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing Nancy.

This was pretty good, but tasted like it was missing something. I will most likely make it again and fool around with the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I just don't like this with chicken for some reason. I made this again last night and made sure I had all of the ingredients in it, but it was sort of bland. I ended up putting it into pasta and it made it a little more interesting, but I think I'm going to stick to what I originally did and that is make the sauce and put extra chili powder and beef in it to make for burritos. My husband and I both enjoyed it that way, but just with chicken did not satisfy our tastebuds.

Excellent! Based on some of the previous reviews I was afraid this may be a bit too spicy, so I only used 1/2 of the chili powder and no pepper sauce. 5 minutes before serving I tasted sauce and it was bland so I added the pepper sauce and the rest of the chili powder.  It was delicious! I did not find it too spicy at all. My husband and son loved it too! Don't let the barbeque smell while it's cooking fool you --- this doesnot taste like bbq chicken.  Thanks!

Wow! This was very tasty. I am not a big tomatoe fan but the tomatoes in this recipe took on a unique flavor and I was wishing that I had doubled the sauce. I will next time. I did not have distilled vinegar, I just used apple cider vinegar.  My 7 and 8 year olds liked it also. I promise you'll be wishing you doubled the recipe. Thanks Nancy!

So many wonderful tastes in one meal. Your tongue gets the ride of its life. I am a great fan of chicken and I have never had it prepared in such a spectacular way. I even passed some to my dad's house, who is very picky. He loved it. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious.  My kids even really loved this and said it was one of their favourite recipes.  However, if your kids aren't a fan of spicy, I would cut the chili powder down to 1 tsp.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe but I wouldn't recommend it for young children. My 4-year-old said it was too "spicy." That's his word when the flavor is too strong. Good recipe though.

This dish definitely has a kick!  It is unusual, but very good.  I can't believe that anyone would say that it was bland.  I did not change anything, but probably next time I would reduce the mustard to about 1/2 or 1/4 or what was used.  I'm just not a big mustard fan.  I also thought that the leftovers the next day were even better.

I was a little nervous about trying this recipe.  There are so many rave reviews, but those who didn't like it, REALLY didn't like it.  I was pleasantly surprised to fall into the majority who enjoyed the dish!  I didn't have celery seed or dry mustard, and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Very tasty!  It does have a hint of BBQ flavor, but was much more complex.  I will definitely try again, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the celery seed and mustard add to the flavors.

I thought this was really good, but my husband said it was just ok.  I left out the celery seed because I don't like it.  Served over rice with sweet peas on the side and french bread.

I also used balsomic vinager with diced tomatoes and left out the hot sauce.  This was sooo good.  I served it at a dinner party over white rice with a sweet potatoe.  Very good!!!  I will make it over and over again.

Everyone raved about this recipe when I made it and my only concern was that one family member didn't want to try something with chili pepper and hot sauce as ingredients but the rest of us (including two kids) thought it was great and not at all spicy.  My husband said, "That's a keeper!"

This dish was wonderful.  I used the substituted balsamic vinegar instead of white and white wine instead of water like the others had suggested and it was fantastic. I also used crushed red pepper spice instead of chili powder.  The gravy does taste great with mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

VERY NICE! Very quick, too! i subbed red wine for the vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper for the chili powder to give it a little bite! perfecto! will make many many times again.

It wasn't that I didn't think the recipe was okay, but I didn't think its taste matched with the glowing comments.  I'm glad I made several of the recommended changes--added sliced onion and cut back to 1/2 teaspoon on the salt.  I thought it was too heavy on the chili powder.  I didn't really mind the recipe but I probably won't be making it again.

This recipe had a great flavor.  I do recommend adding more tomatoes to get more of the flavorful broth.

Thank you Nancy!  I didn't think there was anything left to do with boneless skinless chicken brests until I tried this recipe.  I have added this to my recipe box and will be making it often.  Just the perfect amount of spice in a delicious combination.

This was great.  Even my kids liked it.  My son who swears he hates chicken ate it with ketchup, oh well.  But everyone else really enjoyed it.  I cut the brown sugar in half and used a sugar substitute, I added a chicken bouillon cube and omitted the salt.  I will definitely make this again with my changes.

This was very easy, very yummy and even my husband who is not a big fan of chicken in any form really liked it.  I made two substitutions out of necessity-I had to use plain diced tomatoes as I didn't have stewed, and used cider vinegar as I didn't have any white distilled.  It was very simple to put together.  Great dish to have with pilaf and steamed spinach.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it for dinner tonight and served it over white rice. Yum, yum!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with sundried tomatoes in it and I added a little more water to the recipe.  Superb and so easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.  It was a hit in my house.  Thanks Nancy!

Great chicken dish! The ingredients in the sauce work to create a nice meld of hot and sweet, not too tangy as I thought, because of the vinegar. I served this over rice with salad. Everyone loved it!

This recipe was a very big hit with my husband. My children didn't like it that much, but I added pinwheel pasta to theirs and some grated cheese, and they liked it more.  For my husband, I would make more sauce.  But otherwise it was fantastic.

I LOVED THIS CHICKEN. I wanted to follow the recipe exactly, but used celery salt since I didn't have any celery seed. I cut the brown sugar in half. I also doubled the sauce recipe. I won't change anything next time. And there will be a next time. It was fabulous.

Wow! This is an easy dish to make and turns out like you put in a lot of effort. I was a little hestitant about adding vinegar and Worcestershire sauce to tomatoes, but that combination is zesty and turns up the flavor a few notches. My two year old loved it. I've passed this recipe on to every mother I know.

I really liked this one, it was a great cold winter day meal!  I did find it a bit sweet though.  I think the stewed tomatoes I used had sugar and that put the sweet flavor a little over the top.  I don't eat bread so I served it with some whole wheat kasha which made a great side dish that really worked with this dish.

My family says we should have this one again. I sauteed some fresh mushrooms and onions in the skillet before adding the sauce ingredients, otherwise followed the recipe as is. For you fellow Weight Watchers this recipe is 5 points per serving. Thanks Nancy.

A decidely different recipe.  I liked it but didn't love it.  Very different taste.  It was good but not something I will make often.  Not something I would crave but good for something different every few months.

The recipe was good, however it had quite a bitter taste from the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Will definitely reduce the quantities next time. 

Not sure why everyone is recommending doubling the sauce, we had TONS leftover and we had the quantity of chicken required.

This was a hit!  I wasn't sure if my husband would like it, he's not a tomato fan, but he loved it so much he took the leftovers for lunch! I took someones advice and mashed the tomatoes with a stick mixer. Also, I  didn't have white vinegar so I substituted red wine vinegar, turned out fine!   Thanks for a sharing such a great, easy recipe!

This was a great recipe. Even my picky boyfriend loved it. I, like most of the others who have tried this recipe did substitute the water for white wine, cut the sugar in half as well as the salt and chili powder. Served with bread and a tossed green salad.  Will definitly make this one again. I can't wait to have the leftovers tomarrow for lunch. A must try!

This recipe is great!  My husband doesn't like to eat chicken, but really likes this!  I only used 3 breasts because that was all that would fit in my skillet that has a lid.  I left out the celery seed and served with steamed rice.  The only fattening ingredient is the butter, and that's pretty minimal, which makes this a great tasting low-fat recipe.  I haven't tried it with the French bread, maybe next time!

My husband and I really liked this.  I doubled the liquid ing.(I wanted extra sauce for spaghetti) used taco mix, and cut the sugar in half. It really tastes great over spaghetti. I've made this quite often. My grandkids really like it.

I tried this for the first time with company & all loved it.  The chicken came out very moist, and the sauce is very flavorful.  I added a can of mushrooms & used red wine instead of water.

This had an excellent taste, much better than I expected.  Next time, I will add more than one can of tomatoes and some extra water or wine because my husband and I like a little more broth than this produced but it was still excellent.  We will definetly make this again!

I omitted the hot sauce and water, and substituted diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes, and it was still divine.  I'll definitely be making this again.

My husband and I enjoyed this meal.  I served it over rice, as it seemed too rich for pasta.  I used balsamic vinegar, though not sure that it made any real taste difference, and I cut back on the chili powder.  It was good, though, and I will make it again.

This recipe is amazing!  I wasn't so sure when I first mixed together all the ingredients, but when I tasted it it was like candy!  The chicken fell apart when I took it out of the pan!  I didn't bread the chicken though.  I'm not a fan of that.  My kids, 4yrs and 10 months loved it too!  I don't eat too much meat in one serving, but I couldn't get enough of this stuff!

This recipe is so delicious that we make it 2-3 times a week!! (No joke)  My husband absolutely loves this recipe and requests that I make it all the time..he would eat it everyday!! I don't add the water though b/c we thought it was a little too watery, but other than that, it is mouthwatering.  Everytime I go to the grocery store, I always pick up a couple can of stewed tomatoes to have on hand.  Thanks so much for this incredible recipe that I will DEFINITELY use again and again and again and again...

I left out the celery seed, halfed the chili powder, and left out the hot sauce--I have a sensitive stomach. My spouse and I both loved it! Lots of flavor--a little sauce goes a long way on pasta. Definitely a keeper!

VERY VERY Tasty.  It was a hit with my wife!  We served it over rice and was absolutely delicious.  Next time I think I will double the sauce recipe ..... it was that good!  And I don't really care for chicken, but this one is a keeper..Thanks

I made this last weekend for my husband and me.  We LOVED it!  For a change of pace, I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and I must say it was outstanding--more moist than breasts ever are.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks so much!

This dish is intriguing.  One mouthful reminded me of a tomato sauce from my favorite Mexican restaurant, the next like BBQ.  Unforunately, we ran out of it before I could decide.  I used balsamic vinegar, Italian-style stewed tomatoes and skipped the hot sauce and celery seed.  I served it with rice and Caesar salad. This one will stay in my recipe box!  Thanks.

Great recipe!  I added some green onions and left out hot sauce.  Great starter sauce for other meat dishes.  Will definitely make again!

My husband and daughter enjoyed this dish. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white. Next time I'll also try red wine instead of water and add mushrooms and onions as suggested by other reviewers. I think that would make it even better. Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Most of the ingredients are things I have around the house so it didn't take much effort to make.  I used red wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar and I used white wine in place of the water.  I also cut the sugar portion in half.  I served this with french bread and a salad.  Thanks for the nice recipe!

I tried this recipe and it was good but I think if I make it again I will use half the brown sugar and half the chili powder.  It kind of tasted like sloppy joe sauce on chicken.

SUPER! FANTASTIC! My husband started talking about inviting dinner guests after just a few bites.  We are serving it at a family dinner party this weekend.  The best part is that it is low-cal, and not terribly high in fat!  WOW!!!

this was very different, but in a good way. I used almost a full can of tomatoes for 2 people and added mushrooms. i think you really need to like tomatoes to like this recipe! like others, i used balsalmic vinegar and white wine instead of water, but i'm not sure what significant taste difference that made. served with couscous and french bread. very enjoyable.

This was fantastic!  I served it at a formal dinner party for my mothers 60th birthday.  The sauce was a big hit.  Presents well when served over rice.  I would make this time and time again.

I thought it was ok... very unusual flavour.  Used white wine instead of water.  I think I'll try the water next time.  Chicken was very tender.  Used leftovers to make a sandwich.  Slice the remainder of the chicken into strips and reheat, slice french bread and put chicken strips & sauce on and top with grated cheddar cheese.  Very good.

Easy and excellent flavor.  I used a cajon worcestershire sauce which added that much more flavor to an already flavorful dish.

This is a very delicious and easy receipe! I'll try white wine istead of vinegar. The sugar gave it a sort of BBQ sauce/ketchup taste. I'll try alittle less next time.

This dish was easy to make and well worth any effort put into it.  I added a few onion slices to the chicken as it simmered.  I also substitued white wine vinegar for distilled vinegar and a sweet german white wine for the water.  Will definetely make again.

Tasty but needs something...? Definitely will make another appearance in my kitchen, but I'll probably play with the seasonings a bit. Overall, a good solid easy recipe. I served it over rice and my guests ate every last bit.

This recipe was delicious.  It had a tremendous mix of flavors, unique and wonderful.  I would definately serve this to guests!  I doubled the sauce as others suggested.  I may suggest cutting back on the sugar a bit and thickening the sauce as others have suggested.

This was an easy recipe to put together,but wasn't much of a hit in my home. I thought it was delicious, but my family wasn't too crazy about it. I left out the hot sauce, because we are not into spicy foods. Otherwise it was very good.

My family loved this recipe.  I served it over angel hair pasta and I used red wine vinegar instead of the white vinegar. I have a 2 year old and I thought it was a little too spicy for her but it was very delicious.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I did skip the flour and only seasoned the chicken breasts.  I served with rice and breadsticks.  Definitely will add to recipe box.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and everyone loves it.  It's easy and delicious.  I have substitued sundried tomatoes for the Roma tomatoes the last 2 times and they give the dish a little more zing.  I'll continue to make this dish for a long time to come.

Great simple recipe.  I didn't need to simmer the chicken as long as suggested and left out the hot pepper sauce to satisfy my six year old.  She loved it.

These had good flavor but a little too spicy for me, would probably omit hot pepper sauce next time.

Maybe I wasn't hungry enough.  I mean, it was good but not a 5 star in my book.  I told my husband I wouldn't make this one again and he told me I was crazy!  He loved it!

This was a really easy recipe and my husband and I really liked it. My kids didn't really like it that much, but my kids are really picky eaters. This is a recipe I will make again. I only used 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and I did not use the hot sauce. (only because it would be to spicy for the kids)

My family loved this recipe, easy to make.  I'm a vegetarian so I made extra sauce and put some of my soy meat product into the sauce.  Very tasty.
Thanks Nancy !!!

Father in law loved this recipe; double the sauce if serving for six; you'll need a bowl of sauce with good dipping bread on the table.

This was very tasty.  The only thing I changed was to thicken sauce with Wondra flour before serving over chicken flavored rice.  I also baked this for about an hour instead of simmering in pan.  Chicken was very tender.  The only problem was I had no leftovers!!!!!!

Wonderful! I took advice from another review and used red wine and balsamic.  Great flavor.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper.  I served this over rice.  Should have doubled the sauce. Thanks for this great dish!!!

I tried this the first time for company and everyone really enjoyed it.  It was quick and easy to fix.  I did cut out alot of the salt.  I believe it would have been way too salty otherwise.  I also substituted white wine for the water.

I made this recipe for the fist time.
It was very easy to make & very tasty. My 15 year
old son & 9 year old daughter loved it. My daughter
even gave her friends a tast & they had to bring
the recipe home so their parrents would make it.

Very moist, flavorful chicken.  I served over rice instead of bread and only used 4 chicken breasts so there was plenty of sauce. *I haven't made this for a while but it's not quite as good as I remember. I used a lot of chicken so I doubled the sauce. It was way too much so I won't do that again.

This chicken was absolutely fabulous! My husband is not big on tomatoes, but he had two servings and was very impressed. It also smelled delicious while it was simmering. I will definitely make this one again! Next time I will add some additional veggies as well. Excellent!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  Like most I altered it slightly for our personal tastes, but this gave me the perfect base.  I used a can of diced tomatoes undrained, used a red wine instead of water, balsamic vinegar instead of white and added fresh mushrooms. My hubby has always been suspicious of chicken recipes with "tomato" stuff, but he actually went back for more sauce to go with his chicken this time!  Next time I think I'll make it two cans of diced tomatoes! ;) Thanks for a great idea.

A wonderful recipe.  One I will make many times.

I did add something to it.  I did marinade the chicken breasts in the liquid from draining the can of stewed tomatoes.  I suspect it added some flavor and help brown the chicken.

We loved the sauce on this chicken.  It was great on rice.  I left out the hot pepper sauce since the recipe also has chili powder and I don't like my food too hot.

I used only 4 chicken breasts halves.  But doubled up on the ingredients for the sauce.  I substituted Rotel tomatoes for stewed and eliminated the hot sauce.  The best thing was I had all ingredients on hand without having to make a special trip to the store.  I used the extra sauce to pour over rice.

I loved this-I did use breasts with the bone in-but cut them off when done.  I put a whole tsp of hot sauce in-my husband said next time to add more-we like the spice.  I served it over a little bit of rice-we try to stay low carb so the bread was out-although it would've been great-the sauce is fantastic.  This is a keeper. Thank-you

I loved this! Made it for my parents' anniversary and everyone enjoyed it. There was one little piece left and I couldn't wait to take it for lunch the next day. My brother left with the recipe. Very easy to vary how spicy you make it,
I chose to leave out the hot sauce so it would be more mild for guests. For me & my husband, I'll add the hot sauce, and then some!

This was ok, but I don't think I'll make it again. It was sharp in flavour, rather than spicy, so it didn't really appeal to us.

This recipe was great!  It's been a long time since I enjoyed a meal this much and the leftovers were even better.  Since I served it over egg noodles, next time I will probably double the sauce.  It was sooo yummy!!!  Thanks for a wonderful meal!

I really enjoyed this. It says 30 minutes for the prep time, but it didn't take that long. I recommend this highly.

Delicious, but be forewarned - it is SPICY. The kids probably won't like it.  I double the sauce and use it over pasta which I serve with the chicken.  An added bonus is that its relatively low in fat!

This was a good recipe, but a little too spicy for me and the kids.  I doubled the sauce recipe, perhaps there was too much chilli powder.
