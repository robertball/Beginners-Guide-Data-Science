This recipe is awesome!! I've been using the same one for years, with just a few variations: (1) For a slightly more moist and chewy cookie, use butter in place of the shortening (no, they do not come out flat this way - they maintain their shape perfectly). The flavor of the butter also helps take the taste of these cookies to a whole new level!! (2) Bake them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, pull them out of the oven and put the kisses on them, then put them back in the oven for 1.5 to 2 additional minutes. If you do this, the chocolate takes on a new, slightly softer texture once it cools. It still hardens, but not QUITE as hard; and it suits the cookies much better when it's time for eating. Whether you take my advice or follow the posted recipe, I urge you to try these cookies. You won't be disappointed! This is THE classic Peanut Butter Blossoms recipe, and everyone you feed them to will love them :)

Great recipe!  I have made a few batches, ones made with regular Crisco and ones made with butter.  Everyone who has sampled both seem to like the ones made with butter better.  Just remember that you will probably have to chill the dough for at least a few hours. Definitely my new peanut blossom recipe!

This is a standard for my family however we have found that the "Dove Promises" are considerably better in the center. The chocolate is smoother, less bitter and the shape distributes the chocolate more evenly with each bite

These cookies are so classic I remember helping myself to a neighbor's stash in her freezer when I was a little girl, and that was decades ago! My family and I have enjoyed them every year since. Some things are so good, so tried and true, that they are timelessly perfect.  And this recipe for Peanut Blossoms is one of those. I don't know when this particular recipe originated, but if you're looking for THE recipe for Peanut Blossoms, this is it, the original.  In my view, no Christmas Cookie plate is complete without them, and I know they will continue their tradition of creating fond memories.

Hey...the idea behind these cookies was good, however in reality they were not up to our standards.  Actually my friend and myself ate these cookies and did not feel very good afterwards.  These did not leave a warm full feeling, but instead a disturbing very sugary unsettling feeling....we couldn't eat anything the rest of the day.  Perhaps it was because they actually were quite tasty and we ate 24...and then we burned some and ate those too...:-)  Thanks for the fun recipe

I have tried several Peanut Blossom Cookie recipes and my family and I agree that these are the best of the bunch!  They are not as crumbly and dry as many of the other recipes I have tried and the peanut butter flavor really comes through.  As others suggested, I used the butter flavored shortening and it worked out well.  Thanks for a great recipe that is now being added to my permanent recipe collection!

These turned out great....I've made them twice so far, and my kids keep begging me to make more.  The first couple of batches out of the oven just dissappear...not even cooled. The kids say they are the "bomb" and best cookies that I've ever made.  I didn't change a thing.  This recipe also makes as many as it says it does...unlike many other recipes that fall short of how many they actually make, unless you make them extra small.  This one is certainly a keeper!

Awesome cookies! Made these following the recipe exactly and baked for 11 minutes. I think my cookies were a little bigger than the recipe called for because I ended up with about 70 cookies..but I wouldn't change a thing because the size was perfect. Once cooled, they were still nice and chewy and tasted wonderful. Not too sweet with a good amount of peanut butter flavor. Took some to work and they were devoured! Thank you Rosemarie for a great recipe!

Great recipe!  Always a favorite during the holidays.  You do need to let these sit on a cooling rack for a while before putting them away to ensure the kiss in the center hardens after baking.

Even my husband who doesn't like peanut butter cookies can't keep his hands off these.  I used Butter Flavored Crisco.
It's months after my first review.  I've made these cookies countless times.  They've become my signature cookie.  They recently made money for a cancer society bake sale.  Try using the new caramel kisses.  They stay so soft and delicious.  Wonderful cookies each and every time I make them.  Deserve more than 5 stars!

This is one of my family's favorite Christmas cookies! They always turn out well. I like to make the balls 3/4 inch rather than 1 inch; that way there is more chocolate on each cookie!

I made these exactly as stated in the original recipe, except I halved the ingredients to 42 servings because I only had one bag of kisses.  IF you do the same thing, remember that the step b y step instructions will be the same as if you are doing 84 servings.  It will tell you to pour in 1 cup of white sugar.  Don't pour in one cup, you need to pour in 1/2 cup.    Also, these do not spread hardly at all, so you can put them very close together.

Dang, these are really good!  Based upon the reviews, I was thinking, "c'mon, they're peanut butter blossoms, how different can they be?"  This is the first recipe I have tried where they didn't go flat. After reading other comments, I decided to try using 1/2 butter flavored Crisco, and 1/2 real butter.  Perfect.  We use the Brach's stars on them at Christmas & call them "Wise Men".

This is precisely my mother's recipe, which according to the recipe card, she got from Ladies' Home Journal.  Always comes out great!  She's has Celiac, so she's adapted a gluten-free version - substitute rice flour for the regular flour, and add 1 1/2 tsp of xantham gum.  As always, the uncooked dough will taste funny, but the rice flavor will cook right out of it and you won't be able to tell the difference!

Making my second batch of the season tonight. These are a classic Christmas cookie at our house and always requested by folks outside the family as well. It's too bad that STEPH rated them with only one star. I don't think it was the cookie that was to blame, but the eating of the entire batch in one sitting. Guess they were good enough at the time! Anyway, make a double batch...you will love them.

YUMMMMM.....I've been looking for a recipe like this for years.  This has become the 'bonding recipe' for my daughter and I.  We usually have to make a double batch because everyone at work gets upset if I dont' bring them in!  The only thing I changed was using butter flavored Crisco-it just makes them taste more 'buttery'.  Just make sure the chocolate is completely hardened before you put them in a ziploc bag--the chocolate might smear or fall off--such a shame!  Thank you!

Again, a good well-known cookie recipe but this particular version did not work out well for me. I followed the recipe exact, even using name brand peanut butter. The dough was crumbly to work with and even after I got it shaped and baked, most of the cookies fell apart once I pushed the kiss in and went to remove it off the sheet. This is the last time I use a recipe for blossoms that either isn't mine or Jif's. I'm not an inexperianced baker by any means nor am I a recipe snob who only likes name brand recipes. Sometimes, you gotta go with what works and for some reason, other off shoots of blossom recipes just don't pan out for me.

These cookies are one of my favorites. My mom and I have been making them for years.  We found that putting the kiss in upside down helps keep the cookie from breaking apart. It also makes it easier to package and they taste the same.

I made these cookies and they were delicious! We had an old recipe for these that somehow got lost that my family and I loved, and these are 100 times better! I used butter instead of shortening which I always do, and did not roll them in sugar befo putting them in the oven. I also put the cookies in for eight minutes then out the chocolates on and then put them back I for two minutes to insure that the choocolate melted. I used dark chocolate kisses and milk. They are delicious! Deffinetly making again

Absolutely perfect. These are a great recipe to make with kids! I used butter instead of Crisco (eww). Made 2 batches - made the balls a little too big the first time. They should be be just a little bigger than an inch in diameter. Took 11 minutes in my oven.

Make sure that all the chocolate kisses are all unwrapped and place in a bowl in the refridgerator when assembling them. This way, they will stay intact and not melted from your warm hands. Also, use a cookie scoop when dropping these cookies so they are uniform in size. Experiment with other kiss flavors. Yummy!!

I just got done making these and they turned out great. I followed others reviews and baked for 8 mins. then press the kisses in them then baked for another a min. and thirty seconds. I also used all butter instead of shortening and kept everything else the same.

Taste wise, these deserved five stars, but I really had a hard time with these cookies spreading to much.  I only make these for Christmas which means looks matter a lot. I tried turning the heat up a bit and refrigerating the dough first, which helped but they still puffed up too much.  Usually that would be perfect, but not what I want for these cookies.

I like these cookies...they are really good but they are only moist for 2 days at the most and then well they can be really hard which makes them not so good to eat...So I give this 3 stars just for how long they last..which is not long...

Oh my gosh, these were to die for.  I have already ate like 4 of them and still need to make room for dinner.  The only thing I did different was use butter flavored shortening and towards the end switched to my hubby's favorite chocolate, dove.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Followed to a tee.

I've been making this exact recipe for years - and love it, my grown-up daughter's fav.  I really like Adelina P's idea about using peanut butter Hershey's Kisses instead of plain, this year I'll make half recipe of each.

Made these cookies last Christmas. All were eaten.
This year had several requests to include these cookies this year.
Followed recipe exactly.
I am going to try butter.. 1/2 c shortening and 1/2 c butter. Do not misunderstand. I am not trying this variation because I found fault with the cookie, but because of the two reviews I read (Liz, 2009 and CSMorris, 2003).
Thanks for this recipe. My great grandma made this and until last year I have not had a good one since she passed away.
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.

Great recipe that we are making for a friend's wedding.  (Apparently cookies are a long-standing tradition; who knew?)

NOTE:  Read the recipe carefully, unlike me.  They only want *part* of the sugar mixed with the cookies.  I missed that and added the full amount.  The cookies turned out just fine.  However, I had recipes that do that.  If you need the sugar for two separate parts, LIST IT SEPARATELY.  But the cookies were awesome.  And like it says, watch it closely.  The moment you see a tinge of brown, pull the cookies.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've never made these before (so I don't have a recipe to compare this to), but they turned out great and were a big hit.  I did half the recipe (because I didn't need so many of one type of cookie) and used half butter/half shortening.  They turned out perfectly - my cookies didn't crack after putting the Hershey Kiss in, and the cookies stayed soft even after they cooled.  I will be using this recipe again in the future.

The recipe on here is phenomenal. The only thing I did differently was to use butter instead of shortening. However, be very careful with the timing on these. The recipe states 10-12 minutes and for my brand new oven, it was WAY too long. The first batch I made was completely burned on the bottom in 8 and a half minutes. The next batch I put in for 7 minutes and it was perfect. Don't wait until they start to brown, that will be too long. As soon as they start to crack on the top, they are ready to be taken out. I did half of these with dark chocolate kisses and they turned out great as well!

Awesome, Beautiful! You can't mess these up. Follow directions exactly, or with slight changes, they are still wonderful.  I baked mine for 350 degrees instead for about 10 1/2 - 11 minutes, than put kisses in them, and back in oven for 1 minute to get a softer overall chocolate.  I used butter instead because I like butter better, (when using butter it's best suggested to refrigerate your dough a few hours to chill before putting on cookie sheets) and added a little extra peanut butter cause we love peanut butter.  They were soooooo soft and chewy. Even 4 days later they still are as soft and chewy as the 1st day I baked them.  Love, Love, Love.

Good recipe and good cookies but I like to half/half the crisco with butter as it softens the cookies.  The shortening makes the cookies puffy and big but the butter is what makes them soft and chewy.  I tried this recipe and the cookies were more crunchy than I like.

I just baked these and they are wonderful! My only change to the recipe was to use half butter and half shortening. Also, I was out of milk so I used whipping cream cut with a little water to equal the quarter cup. Turned out great.  I will make again and again........

These have been a favorite of mine for years!!! My husband also loves these, so it's a no brainer when deciding whether or not to add a batch to my holiday cookie trays! My only complaint is that my cookies did not remain soft and chewy as I hoped they would. Both my hubs and neighbor commented that this type of cookie NEVER stays moist, but I remember otherwise (hmmmm...). My neighbor recommended placing a slice of bread or apple in my cookie jar to help with that. Otherwise, these cookies are FANTASTIC! For a little holiday jolly, I dipped my cookies in red and green decorator sugar. Too cute!!! I also made some with mint kisses and the rest with plain 'ol milk chocolate kisses. I prefer the traditional chocolate candy best. If you haven't already, TRY THESE! You won't be disappointed. :-) Thanks for sharing this classic on here, Rosemarie!

This is the one!  The secret is using 1/2 c. margarine (always 80% vegetable oil, at least) and 1/2 c. Butter Flavor Crisco. Bake 9 minutes, remove from oven.  Press on kisses.  Bake 2 minutes more.

The was my first try making these.  The flavor was good the family loved them...but mine cracked too much.  I started out at 10min  but ended up at 7min.  I think my oven was too hot.  Instead of kisses I used hersheys hearts and reeses PB filled hearts.  Yummy.

Loved this cookies!  It made for me exactly 72.  I used 1/2 cup butter an 1/2 cup of buttered flavored crisco.  It was delicious!  Everyone could not believe how soft they were.  But do not over bake them!  They will crack.

These were very soft chewy-just the way I like them. However I couldn't get the kisses to stay on even with baking them in the cookie for a few minutes.

These are the BEST cookies! I followed another review and took the cookies out at 8 minutes, placed the kiss in the cookie and put back in the oven for 2 min. The chocolate kiss holds its shape but never hardens back up and is so delicious and easier to eat! Will definitely make again!

These were very good. I read recipes where folks wanted butter instead of shortening and some where the butter folks said it was dry. Sooooo I used 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 unsalted butter.  They were excellent.  A fav of my DH. I used the new special dark chocolate Hershey Kisses and just followed the recipe instructions.  I used a medium cookie scoop to measure out the dough and baked mine for 12 minutes.  A keeper!

These are a Christmas classic. I roll the dough in red and white rock sugar before baking to make them a bit more festive. And I always make a double batch so I have enough to make Peanut Butter Cup Cookies as they are the axact same recipe.

These are fabulous! Loved by all and fun to make too. I don't normally like to change recipes, but I don't use shortening. So I used butter in it's place. They are soft and chewy with just the right amount of crisp on the outside. They look exactly as pictured here. I got more like 100 cookies. Baked for 8 minutes, quickly put the Hershey kisses on, then baked for another minute to heat the kisses all the way through. When cooled thoroughly, the kisses remain so soft and the cookie the perfect mixture of chewy and crispy.

A classic favorite - softer than I remember as a kid!  To REALLY save time, use a 1" cookie scoop dipped in sugar each time. Super easy and way less messy! To get the sugar to stick the first time, scoop one cookie first and dispense, then dip in sugar.

This cookie is very good.  I put white chocolate "Hugs" on some of mine, since my husband doesn't like regular chocolate.  I followed the recipe exactly and I had no problems with the cookies.

I too used butter instead of shortening, and they turned out amazing! I also made half of the cookies with peanut butter-filled kisses. They take a little longer to harden back up, but they turned out excellent!

This is one of the best peanut butter cookies you could ever make. They're a standard for all of my holiday cookie trays and out of all of the cookies I put on the trays, this one receives the most compliments and is most appreciated.

I make these every year. This year I had only the natural type pb and went ahead and used it, wary of the results. They were delish. I also baked them in my convection oven so I could make two trays at once. The cookies were a little flatter, not much, but very chewy and---I got done in half the time.

These were good.  I baked mine for 8 minutes. They came out much better than when they were in for 10 minutes, too crispy. At least in my oven. No need to freeze the dough it worked great for me as it was. Also if you put the candy on top as soon as it comes out of the oven it will soften on it's own. Don't touch untill it is completely cooled and the chocolate has set. The only reason I didn't give it 5* is because,(I hate to say it) But I had a box mix that was better. They sold it at Sam's Club during the holidays. Thanks for the recipe though.

I always avoid shortening whenever possible, so I substituted real butter for the shortening in this recipe.  They were fabulous!  A little sticky and hard to roll, but if you just push the dough off the spoon into the sugar, knock it around a bit to get all the stickiness covered, then pick it up with your fingers and shape into a ball, it works.
I also substituted demerara sugar for the white sugar--the crystals are large and gives another texture dimension, a crunchiness on the surface.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I usually make these cookies for Christmas.  My kids enjoy helping me make these with the unwrapping of the candies.   You better plan on making more than 72 cookies.  My batch made 94 cookies. Thanks Rosemarie for your great recipe.

I made a double batch using butter instead of shortening, and to change it up, instead of a kiss, I placed a maple coated peanut on some and butterscotch chips on others, Rave reviews!

For the first time, I did not use my typical peanut butter blossom recipe (I could not find my recipe card).  The dough was very crumbly and the cookies nearly broke apart when I added the candy centers.  They did not have enough of a peanut butter flavor.  I bake often and consider myself to be a good cook/baker, so I don't believe it was how I prepared the dough or baked the cookies.  These were not nearly as good as the recipe I usually make.  I'm now on the search for my old recipe to make more.

Good flavor, but a cracked mess.  I followed the recipe to the letter, no substitutions.  The cookie tastes good, but the tops of every one of them came out of the oven cracked.  I won't be using this recipe again.

This is a very tasty recipe! I changed the shortening to butter since butter is always better and I followed suggestions to bake for ~8-9 minutes, take out and place the Hershey kiss, and bake for another 2 minutes. They came out great!

I am disappointed in how these turned out - my usual recipe (which I can't find!) always turned out nice and soft/chewy and these are already hard and crunchy, and it's only been about 30 minutes since they came out of the oven.  Seems like a big waste to throw them all out but I will be embarrassed to put these in my Christmas cookie trays because even though they look nice, they just aren't very good when they are so hard :(

These are the peanut blossoms that I have been making for Christmas for 15 years. They don't have a very strong peanut butter flavor in my opinion, but always turn out great. I like to make half a recipe at a time, because there are always too many goodies around this time of year.  I also like to make my cookie balls extra small so there is more chocolate involved. I do throw the pan back in the oven for a minute or two after pressing the kiss into each ball to melt the chocolate a tiny bit.  Also, 10-12 minutes is way too long in my oven.

Subbed butter for shortening and lowered the temp to 350.  I don't know if it's because I had little bakers helping me measure ingredients but I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to make the dough workable.  Baked 11 minutes, put kisses on each.  Did not press before baking.  If they come out and seem a little undercooked, not to worry; they do firm up!  PERFECT!  :)

Perfect recipe!! Finally I have found the perfect recipe for my favorite cookies!! Definitely do NOT swap the shortening for butter! With the shortening you get a perfectly soft and chewy and perfect cookie! The first batch that my daughter and I made, we followed the directions and made one inch balls and cooked them for 10 minutes at 375 degrees and we got burnt cookies. ?? the next batch I switched it up and I made slightly bigger than half an inch balls and baked them for 8 minutes at 350 degrees and we got THE PERFECT COOKIE!!! Warning, when you take them out of the oven, they are going to look like they are not quite ready yet, BUT THEY ARE. Resist your instint  put them back in for another minute because you will definitely burn them. Perfect recipe! LOVES THEM. KISSES FOR EVERYONE THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!  Just one difference in my kitchen:  I use  Brach's milk chocolate stars instead of kisses.  For me, it's a better balance between chocolate and cookie.  As a nice bonus, there's less fuss with unwrapping each individual kiss, and they're prettier, too :)

Be sure not to overcook these - take 'em out just before they start to brown or they won't be as chewy.  I replaced the chocolate kisses with Dove milk chocolate hearts to make them "Valentinesy".

These cookies did not have a powerful enough taste of peanut butter.  I would suggest adding more peanut butter.  Also, I used butter shortening instead of regular shortening as that is all I had.  The cookies did have a nice texture and I will make again but will add in extra peanut butter.

I feel that this recipe is spot-on. I use natural peanut butter, which works well and provides a strong peanut-butter flavor, and I replace the shortening with butter. That's it. Recipe is perfect!

These cookies are so delicious and very addictive! They definitely beat any plain old peanut butter cookie by far! I accidently bought the kisses with almonds but the almonds tasted great in this cookie! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a keeper!  It is a big recipe, though.  I made the cookies fairly small so it actually made over a hundred.  The next time I may make just half.

These were ok. They didn't have enough peanut butter taste to leave the kiss out. I made them with a chocolate heart, some with a mini reese's cup, some with mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. I thought the ones with the chocolate and peanut butter chips best.

This recipe is fantastic. Made them today and almost a dozen are gone already between my husband and kids!
I didn't want to make 7 dozen cookies so I halved everything and it came out to be exactly 3 1/2 dozen. Don't be afraid to use natural peanut butter all you naturalists out there. I used Adams natural peanut butter that only has ONE ingredient: peanuts! I just made sure I stirred it really well before adding in.
Also, I only cooked these for about 9 minutes. I set the timer for 8 minutes and let them cook about a minute more and they were PERFECT and the hershey kiss went in perfect and melted just enough on the bottom to stick into the cookie.
These are GREAT peanut butter blossoms and I will keep this recipe for every Christmas...and maybe a few other times a year too;)
Thank you!!!

I have made many versions of these and never really liked any of them until now. I made these a few days ago as cookies for Santa, and I am now making them again because my family ate them all. I did cut the shortening to 1/2 cup and a 1/2 cup of butter to make them more buttery. This is my go to recipe for peanut butter blossoms from now on. THANKS!!!!

Delicious!  I made them exactly as written and they turned out fabulous.  I was worried that the dough needed to be refrigerated because the dough seemed too wet.  I did refrigerate in between batches, but there really wasn't a need.  Enjoy!

Thank you for an awesome recipe! I've always struggled with peanut butter cookies that are too crumbly and dry (especially peanut blossoms which usually taste floury and stick to the roof of your mouth). THESE ARE PERFECT. I know some readers don't like it when people rate the recipe then say what they did to change it, but it always gives me good ideas, so forgive me:  I used butter, which was delicious. I also added about 1/2 cup marshmallow cream. I made it with Dove chocolate as suggested and my boyfriends mom swears they are the best cookies she has ever tasted. I'm making them for the second time in two weeks today and am trying adding peanut butter chips instead of chocolate since my dad's new wife is a chocolate hater (crazy). I've been eating the dough for a solid five minutes now and am confident it will be (almost) as delicious as with the dove chocolate. Thanks again for such a wonderful recipe! This is going in my cookbook for life!

I was pretty disappointed with the way these cookies turned out.  I thought with so many great reviews they would be a lot better than they actually were.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter in place of shortening as others suggested.  The batter tasted too 'floury' and the cookies came out dry and crumbly with no flavor.  I added additional butter, peanut butter, and vanilla trying to salvage these cookies, but they are still way too dry.  In comparing this recipe to other peanut butter cookie recipes, I found that the measurement for the flour and baking soda was too high and the peanut butter too low.  So, if you scale back the flour by about a cup and cut the baking soda in half, these might turn out all right.  I'm just sad I wasted the Kisses on these. :(

These taste very good. I made the whole recipe, though instead of shortening did use butter. Let the dough chill for couple of hours and then rolled out the balls and baked. Used Hershey's dark chocolate kisses. Very good

These are great. However, there were several reviewers who indicated they only got 50-60 cookies out of the recipe. I actually made mine the "normal" size and ended up with close to 100 cookies! Keep in mind so you have enough kisses or chocolate stars (which my family prefers - more traditional) on hand to complete the batch.

Very good and very easy.  I have no idea how you could make 84 out of this recipe however.  I made them fairly small and I only got around 60.  Also, I tried some with "hugs" instead of "kisses" and the hugs melt a lot more than the kisses, so I would stick to tradition.

These were perfect.  I have made these before but used pre-made peanut butter cookie dough but there is no comparison with these!  Definitely worth the effort!  I might try using dove chocolates instead of kisses next time.

These cookies are very good!  The cookie part is not overly hard.  I used soft center KISSES which make the cookie much easier to bite into without the hard KISS in the middle.

These are so good and easy to make.  My first pan was to big so I made them a little smaller.  they have a great peanut butter taste.  I use some mini peanut butter cups for some of them.  Will be making these again and again.  Family loved the.

These have been a staple in my family for generations.  We use chocolate stars instead of kisses though.  They look a bit more festive and hold up a bit better than the kisses.

The cookies were quite good however I only give 4 stars because I thought they lacked a little on flavor. I used butter instead of shortening and half my batch got milk chocolate kisses and the other half I used white chocolate / milk chocolate swirl kisses. I have to say the white/milk swirl ones  were better.

My two favourite things.. chocolate and peanut butter. I used hershey's kisses with caramel in the center for half the batch and hershey's kisses with almonds in the center for the rest of the batch. I didn't  use shortening, but used butter instead. I took them out of the oven when they just started to brown and they were perfect. Other than that, I kept everything the same.  Very easy recipe and they look great when they are done baking.

My mom always made me peanut blossoms and they are fantastic!  I didn't make this recipie but the one I have is very similar, it uses butter.  After we add the kiss we bake them for another 5 min to soften the kiss. They stay softened even after cooled too. It is sooooo yummy!!! Absotutly me favorite cookie. I think I'm going to go make some now!

I have made cookies like this for YEARS.  Mine always dried out and cracked.  These were much better and I will use this recipe from now on.  To keep my family tradition I used chocolate stars instead of the kisses.

Presentation wise and preparation wise, these were pretty good.  However, they were kind of bland - not super-peanut buttery, which I was looking for - and they got very dry, even though I stored them in a air-tight container.  Not terrible, definitely edible, just not the peanut butter kisses I remember from my childhood.

This is a really easy recipe and the kids & husbands just love them. I find them pretty sweet so I took out 1/2 C. white sugar & used good quality butter in place of the shortening. I also forgot to add vanilla but I liked it better because the peanut butter flavor shines through. Also, try them with mini peanut butter cups pushed in the top, really really good.

Great recipe, they turned out perfect.  I kept the cookies small and they didn't crack as much and all stayed together.  This recipe is a staple cookie recipe in our house.

This is a good recipe.  The dough wasnt sticky for me but maybe thats because I kept my butter flavored crisco in the fridge prior to making this.  The only reason I didnt give this 5 stars is because I wish the PB taste was stronger!
A great recipe to do with the kids!

This is the third time I've made these cookies due to requests I was getting from friends! Every time, they turn out soft and the flavor's delicious. I use Hershey Kisses for half of the cookies and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for the other half. I will continue to make these!

This is a great recipe. It has a more peanutty flavor than most blossom recipes I've tried. I did substitute the new Kisses w/ peanut butter centers and they got rave reviews. Even if you accidentally let your kisses melt too much, the cookies will still taste great. :-) Too avoid the cookies drying out, put a slice of bread in the tin/cookie jar to give them moisture. Change the bread when it dries out.

Awesome!  Used butter instead of shortening.  They spread too much on the first batch, so I baked in mini-muffin cups.  I used peanut butter kisses instead of the plain chocolate - yum!  I had a few more cookies than kisses and put a 1/2 teaspoon of strawberry jam in the center of those - yum!  The latter a totally different dynamic but really good nonetheless!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy. I had never made Peanut Blossoms before so followed the recipe exactly. They were perfect. My family gobbled them up and ask me why I hadn't made them before. They are visually appealing so should sell well at fundraisers or bake sales.  This one is defiantly going into my recipe box.

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  Peanut blossoms are my husband's absolute favorite!  I was never happy with my recipe for peanut blossoms because they tasted like they weren't baked enough though my husband was still happy with them.  Today I made your peanut blossoms and they made him REALLY happy!

Oh ... my .... gawd!  I *love* this recipe!!  I added 1/4 teaspoon "butter flavor" (from McCormick) to bring out a bit more of the PB taste, but otherwise left the recipe alone.  In place of Hershey's kisses, I used milk-chocolate chips -- two pressed end to end, melt 'em a bit, and then a third on top of them; melt and stir with toothpick to create the little 'crest'.  :)  DEFINITELY a keeper!  Thanks!  [[Note: If you use "Nutella" or "Twist", be sure to use a little less butter and egg -- it's way softer than PB.]]

Rosemarie,
Thanks for the recipe.  I have been trying different peanut blossom recipes for 10 years, each year dissatisfied.  Your recipe has earned a spot in the cookbook I'm creating for my children.  Awesome cookies!!!

Love, Love, LOVE this recipe!! It was my first time making these and this recipe was so easy and tasty that I’m in love. I’ll never try another. Also, I had planned to take a pic but they were brought to a party and there were none left! I’d say they were a success!

Excellent cookies. Used butter instead of shortening. I halved the recipe and it made 14 tablespoon sized cookies (I used a cookie scoop). Cooked for 10 minutes, added the kisses, cooked for one more minute. Came out great! Will be making again!

I don’t know what went wrong here,  but these were quite awful. I’ve been baking cookies for 50 years, and I’ve never experienced this kind of failure. These were incredibly dry and literally fell apart when pressing the chocolate stars on the top. (I like the stars better then the kisses.) I followed the recipe exactly, used shortening (Crisco sticks), so maybe next time, I’ll use butter, or find an altogether different recipe.

Awesome!! I followed some suggestions and put them back in for 1 min after putting the kiss on and they were great. I decided to try a Lindt truffle on some and pb cups and the Lindt truffle ones were the winners of the bunch!! Although with those the extra minute is NOT recommended because the chocolate melts into a delicious mess. Definitely a keeper and I will be making again this weekend with more Lindt truffle ones!

I made these cookies 3 times for 3 different holiday events. They are my go-to! I bake them for 9 minutes, remove from oven to add the kisses, then bake for an additional 2 minutes. I like the taste of the kisses better when the chocolate is warmed up before letting them cool.

These are great. I made 5 dozen to add to other friends cookies.  We all made different kinds of cookies to take to a local children's home for a holiday treat for the children.  The cookie itself is wonderful and has a very "peanuty"  taste.  I did not add the chocolate  because I was afraid it would detach due to the packaging we used.

I made this recipe with butter but followed measurements exactly for everything.  The dough was easy to handle after chilling in the fridge for 20min.  I am disappointed with the lack of peanut butter flavour.   It needs maybe 1/3 cup more.  I don't think this would ruin the cookie consistency.  I know that too much extra will make the cookie fall apart after baking.  I used Skippy Creamy PB.   Aside from this, it's a decent cookie and makes a LOT.

Nice basic cookie that is guaranteed to please tastebuds. The only kicker is that it took forever to cool the chocolate. I did not want to refrigerate the cookies while they were cooling because I wanted the chocolate to still look good.

These cookies were wonderful and pretty easy to do. I did let the dough cool in frig before my  2&4yr old granddaughters helped to form the balls and dip the tops in colored sugar.

I must say that I initially didn't think they were coming out right because the dough came out really crumbly.   It was a little bit of a challenge to roll them in to balls but i did it.   I thought I didn't do something right but I went through with it and cooked a few batches.  I let them cool and then the next day tried one and I was floored.  I love them!

I made these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly except I Chose to use butter instead of shortening. Baked for 10 min and added the kiss and baked an additional minute. Tried the first batch baking for 8 min like others said but they were too soft. I did not need to grease my cookie sheet. They came out just fine. Great cookies!

This recipe is amazing! The only things that I did differently is I did coconut oil instead of shortening. I also made the balls bigger and used way less chocolate kisses. It ended up making 41 when we set it to 87

Unfortunately, this recipe is not as good as others I've tried. The cookie tastes bland in contrast to the kisses. Other recipes balance the sweetness better. Too bad.

I used half butter & half Regular Crisco, but otherwise made these exactly as listed in the recipe. Took them out of the oven at 8 minutes, put the kisses in and returned to the oven for 2 additional minutes. These turned out perfect!

These cookies are a holiday favorite of ours. I make them according to the recipe as submitted. For us it yields six dozen cookies.

These make a zillion cookies so be prepared to WORK. They're good cookies and they work well.  Make sure you make them small -- because otherwise the hershey's kiss gets kind of lost in them.  I always start too big and then realize after the first batch is done that I need to make them half the size. I roll mine in colored sugars for the holidays. ALWAYS pull them out two minutes early and pop in the kisses -- then put them back in the oven. The kiss won't melt but it will soften enough that when they firm up again after cooling, they're softer to eat. My grandmother taught me this trick.

This is one of my favorite things to make at Christmas!!!

I noticed that a lot of people made this with butter instead of shortening, and while that does make the flavor even better, it also spreads out too much when cooking if you do it that way.  You want this to keep its shape while it cooks, so that’s why shortening needs to be used.  For a little extra depth, I used Butter-flavored Crisco instead of regular Crisco.  The best of both worlds!

Try using different candies on top.  I love regular kisses, but Reese’s peanut butter cups are even better!!!

Finally, a Peanut Butter Blossom Cookie worth giving 5 stars. I didn't change a thing and they were perfect. Most other recipes are dry. These are moist and delicious. Thank you!

I make these for work and everyone loves them!                    The only things I changed were the cook time and the shortening. I use half shortening and half butter in almost all cookies. It gives a good texture and flavor combination.                                                                        Also I thought the cook time on these was pretty off. 10-12 minutes is way too long! I checked these at 9 minutes and they were already overdone. 8 minutes worked pretty well for the rest of the batch.

Delicious recipe. I used butter instead of shortening. I rolled the cookies in white sugar and then red and green holiday sugar. I cooked for 9 1/2 minutes at 350, put kisses on and cooked 2 minutes more.

Delicious!  I thought that 84 cookies sounded like more cookies than I wanted to bake so I cut the recipe to 42 cookies.  Using a 1.5 T cookie baller, the recipe made 26 cookies.  Also, I only used half the sugar (half the brown sugar, no white sugar) and used butter rather than shortening.  12 minutes baking time caused cookies to be a little crunchy and made it difficult to place chocolate.  Next time I'll try 10 minutes.

A Christmas tradition in my house.  I think I made three or four batches last year!  We like them best still warm from the oven but they're just as good cooled down with a glass of milk or cup of coffee.

These are perfect ! I did use butter in place of shortening, but that is the only change I made. It made about 75 cookies, and they stayed soft for several days after storing in an airtight container. This is a keeper. Thanks.

These are really good. I made half the recipe and replaced half cup of flour for unsweeten cocoa. I got 37 cookies. I didn't rolled them in sugar but I think I should since they are not very sweet. Love them!

Very tasty cookie.   The one thing that could have been better is that they seem to be a tiny bit on the dry side and they did crumble a bit when I put the kiss on, but over all everyone enjoyed them.

This recipe is amazing! I got about 5 dozen cookies out of this recipe using slightly smaller than golf ball size dough balls. I also switched it up a bit and for half of the cookies I made I pressed several mini M&Ms into the tops of the dough balls after rolling in sugar, before putting in the oven, instead of using chocolate kisses. They came out great too! Ive made this recipe twice now and both times the cookies came out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and fantastic.  I substituted 2 sticks of butter for the shortening.  To make each cookie equal in size, use a medium cookie scoop.  Roll the cookies into balls and roll into the sugar.  I baked at 10 minutes, and based upon other cooks' suggestions, I immediately pressed PRE-REFRIGERATED dark chocolate kisses into the center.  Immediately transfer to a cooling rack and cool for 2 hours.  Delicious!!

To quote my fussy husband "These are perfect!"
I had a cup of butter flavored crisco that I wanted to use up, so that was the only change I made. These are great.  
I will definitely be using this recipe from now on. Thank you for the recipe.

This is the definitive recipe for peanut butter blossoms, but I strongly urge you to use real butter in place of the shortening. It really makes a huge difference to the taste and your cookies will stay just as puffy and beautiful. With that one simple change, these are fantastic and will disappear quick!

I followed others reviews the second time I made this and used butter, despite promises that they would not fall. THEY DID! I tried both with and without putting them in the fridge. Do not use butter or you will lose the chewy, fluffiness that makes these cookies peanut blossoms! However, if you follow the recipe as is they are wonderful!

This recipe turned out perfectly! We made them as part of your Christmas gifts. There was plenty in 1 batch. Just a warning it takes a while in a warm kitchen for the kisses to harden.

These turned out to be a wonderful cookie.  I rolled them in sanding sugar to be a little sparkly.  I also tried the tip of baking 8 minutes, putting on the kiss, and baking 2 more minutes.

These were delicious! I used half Crisco and half butter and they turned out great. Next time, I might need to make little balls instead of using my cookie scoop because I only yielded 55 cookies with the recipe. They are large and tasty though. I baked mine for 11 minutes.

I will definitely make these again. Made with butter, and chilled the dough overnight. Baked in my oven at 375 for 9 min, just before they turned brown. Classic!

I used half butter and half crisco. They turned out great! Also, I took the advise from another baker who said to pop in the chocolate kisses into the cookie then stick them in the oven for 10 seconds. Remind myself to make these cookies about a teaspoon size not tablespoon.

Tablespoon size ( not using a scoop) were way to large.  They lack a good peanut butter taste.  I will not make again.

Love this recipe! I bake a lot but have never make these cookies. I've never been a fan of peanut butter cookies but these were fantastic! I did make a change by adding 1/2 cup of softened butter and 1/2 of regular shortening. This made them extra soft and had more flavor to them. I took someone else's suggestion and added the chocolate kisses 8 minutes into the cooking time. This made the chocolate nice and soft!

Great recipe.  Delicious and it was hit at our party.  Would make again.  Just be sure to portion out the dough correctly, or else the dough to hershey kiss ratio may be off.

I followed the advice of Liz in MN in using butter instead of shortening. I also baked them at 350 degrees and the baking times as suggested by Liz.   The cookies were moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Makes 5 1/2 dozen. For a slightly more moist and chewy cookie, use butter in place of the shortening (no, they do not come out flat this way - they maintain their shape perfectly). The flavor of the butter also helps take the taste of these cookies to a whole new level!! (2) Bake them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, pull them out of the oven and put the kisses on them, then put them back in the oven for 1.5 to 2 additional minutes.

These were absolutely amazing! I did follow the reviews a bit and did 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter, and also I put the cookies back in the oven for a few seconds after I put the kisses on. These are delicious, and look amazing! They are also relatively easy(as cookies go) and quick.

Delicious! I used organic PB and butter. Turned out great! I rolled several into balls than added it to a bowl with sugar and tossed. Seemed faster than rolling them all indivually in sugar prior to baking.

Unfortunately, I can't get enough of these cookies. What a fantastic  recipe and because they are made with shortening instead of butter, it os the most economical.

Loved it. I used half shortening and half butter. Baked for 10 minutes (mine were larger) then put on kisses and returned to oven for 1+ minute. Makes the chocolate nice and soft once cooled.

This is an even better recipe than my mom used when I was growing up.  The cookies stay moister and chewy fir much longer.  I did make one change based on other reviews.  I did half crus I and half butter.  By halving instead of replacing the crus I, you don't need to chill the dough, but still end up with a fuller cookie.  ??

These cookies are wonderful. I have to say though that I don't know how it would even be possible to get 84 cookies out of this batch. I made smaller tablespoon size cookies (it says in the directions to use a tablespoon) and I got maybe 65 and didn't even finish one small bag of hershey kisses.

Whoa! These are delicious!!! I used butter instead of shortening, like some recommended and did 8 min at 350 then added the dark chocolate kisses, then 2 more min in the oven. I like a soft chewy cookie, and these turned out perfect! I also didn't roll them in sugar.

This is one of our favorite recipes for cookies during the holidays. We've been making it for about five years now. My daughter found it while in middle school. I know she's going to come home for her freshman fall semester and want to make them for Christmas.

Great cookie, but I halved the  recipe and to make 42 cookies, but it only made 29.  I used a cookie baller, so I was not off on size by that much. The cookie was great! Next time I will make the whole recipe.

These were so delicious! I'm usually not one to eat what I bake, but with these I couldn't get enough! They were AMAZING right out of the oven, warm and with ooey-gooey chocolate, but just as yummy once cooled. My only suggestions are like everyone else is saying; use butter instead of Crisco. I made over 7 dozen--way more than my family can eat-- and I'm sure I won't get any complains from my friends when I bring the extra to school tomorrow. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I loved them, my family and friends think they are the greatest. Just like a few others I also use butter. But butter flavor crisco is good too. Every Christmas I have made this recipe for years. My daughter in-law had me make them for her wedding reception. Everyone loved them so much she didn't get any.  So I had to make more.

OMGOSH!!!!!! I made these cookies today and they are amazing!!! My best friend says similar peanut butter cookies I've made in the past are her favorite so I made these for her. She  said these are her new favorite by far! The only changes I made were I made the cookies smaller, only 1 teaspoon of dough per cookie. The smaller size made them bake faster so they were done in about 6 minutes at 350 degrees farhenheit. I also didn't have Hershey kisses so instead I used Guittard milk chocolate baking chips. The chips are pretty similar to the mini Hershey kisses so you could probably use them as well. :)

Great recipe! I made these last year exactly the way it is written. The taste was great, but I had a problem with them falling apart. I may have cooked them too long. This time I did half shortening and half butter. I cooked the cookies for 9 minutes at 375. I took them out and immediately put the kisses on. I kept the kisses in the fridge prior to putting them on the cookie. Once I put the kisses on I put the cookies back in the over for one minute. I let them cool and then put them in the fridge. These turned out great!!! They are not falling apart at all. Sooooo good!

These were fun to make, but my son wanted to make them look like spiders like they do in the Halloween recipe photo. Tried to replicate using Lindt truffles. DO NOT USE LINDT TRUFFLES. They melt and make a royal mess and never go back to a semi solid state. Probably will not be able to give these to my nephews and niece as planned because they'll ruin their clothes trying to eat this sloppiness. Probably would have been fine had I used kisses. Half the batch I pushed Reese's chips into and they are good.

My family loved these.  They baked up uniformly and were soft and chewy- perfection! I've made them twice and both times the results were consistent.

Used butter instead of shortening, left everything else the same.  These are perfect every time!

This is the PERFECT peanut butter kiss recipe. I made to the exact recipe as far as ingredients, only needed to bake 9 minutes, though. I had less than enough kisses for the whole batch, so I used the dough and made teaspoon sized balls and pressed lightly with a fork to make regular peanut butter cookies. Those only needed 7 -8 minutes at 375.  I'll be using this one again!

I tried this recipe twice and I just can't seem to get them to work.  They tend to spread out a lot and then get thin and crispy.  Very strange since if anything I'm a better baker than cook so I'm not sure what the hang up is with the recipe.  I may try another recipe next time (usually only makes these around the holidays) and hopefully I'll have some better luck.

I've made this twice in two days and love keeping a fresh batch in the frig. This is great for the dogs to have every once in a while and I'm going to come up with a better way to ingredient them so that the dogs can safely have these as treats. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

This recipe turns out great every time.  Probably because it's a real peanut butter cookie recipe, unlike those 3 ingredient ones so there's no way you could be disappointed. My daughters also love to help roll the dough in sugar, unwrap the kisses and place them in the cookies when they come out of the oven.  All of which makes baking these cookies even sweeter (not to mention easier)!

Definitely take Liz in MN's advice when making the cookies. I made the cookies numerous times using butter as she said, and they were heavenly, but since we ran out of butter I decided to try the original recipe as is with shortening and they're painfully flavorless, with a slightly tougher texture. That's why I'm giving the recipe 3 stars; with the butter it's definitely a 5 star recipe.

This is the exact recipe I stated making as a child with my mom.  It is my husbands favorite Christmas cookie.  And, for some reason I only make them at Christmas time.  This year I tried using my Kitchen Aid to mix the dough, and I must have over mixed it as the cookies flattened a little further than they should have.  It didn't affect the taste, just the overall appearance.  Next year I will go back to my hand mixer.  Wonderful cookie with lots of flavor.

Best peanut butter blossoms I've ever had!  I modified the recipe slightly and didn't dip them in sugar.  I think that gave them a better texture overall and didn't take away from the peanut butter flavor.  I baked them for 8.5 minutes, added the chocolate kiss, and put them back in the oven for 1.5 minutes. I think I'll make them with Dove Promises next time like other reviewers did as Hershey's Kisses seem to have a waxier flavor to them in recent years.

This has been my family's favorite cookie recipe for years.  The only time I ever had a problem was the year my daughter unwrapped all the kisses for me before I got home from work.  There were way too many cookies for the kisses we had left.  Head's up to those of you with kids - monitor the candy unwrapping!  Pennyg

LOVE LOVE LOVE !!! Followed this recipe to a T, and will use this one every time I want peanut blossoms. I must say I'm totally impressed & surprised that 3 days later they are still soft. Of course I keep them in a air tight container, but I've made other versions of this recipe many times but always found they dried out and got too crunchy. Thanks for an awesome recipe, definitely a keeper!!!

I made this recipe exactly as directed and the cookies turned out perfect.  I never have made these without the chocolate melting all over.  Not this time.  I am definitely throwing out all other recipes for these cookies and only making this one.  These are good enough to share and that is rare when I bake.  Thanks for sharing it Rosemarie.

Followed the recipe and used dark chocolate kisses...excellent! They do spread, so don't put them too close together. I refrigerated the dough between batches and had to turn my oven down after a couple batches to 365 degrees because they were getting too crispy. I even used some Kraft Caramel Bits in the middle when I ran out of kisses---wonderful! Thank you for a great recipe!

Perfect!  I did tweak it just a tad...  1/2'd the recipe, used butter and all natural peanut butter, added 1tsp of cinnamon.  Also put the kisses on top after 10min then add another 1.5(ish) min.  WOW ~ these are delish!!  Exactly what I was looking for!... and our elf was happy to help eat them too!!

Absolutely perfect! Just like my aunts! Followed recipe exactly, and it actually does make 7 dozen cookies. Little tip to keep kisses from popping off: put kisses in all the cookies on the tray, and then go back and twist them gently until you see a little melted chocolate around the edges. The melted chocolate holds them in place without losing the shape of the kiss. Be quick, or the kiss will collapse! My dough balls were about 1.5 inch, and I ended up just one cookie shy of 7 dozen. Perfect recipe!

This recipe is fabulous. I had lost my grandmothers recipe for Peanut Blossoms and this seemed closest to hers. I substituted butter for the shortening and used Brachs milk chocolate stars instead of kisses (Grandma always used the stars). My cookies turned out scrumptious. I put the chocolate stars on after 8 minutes of baking and put the cookies back in the oven for 1 1/2 minutes. Helps the chocolate set into the cookie and makes it a little creamier after it cools.

Great recipe! I substituted butter for shortening and baked at 350 with putting kisses on 1-2 minutes before finish time (at 8 min or so) as another suggested. Will definitely keep using this recipe.

Great recipe, they turned out perfectly! I froze the kisses after I stuck the first batch on and they melted completely, once frozen they held their shape a lot better.

We have had this recipe in our family recipe book since I was a little girl. My grandmother's trick was to pull the cookies out at about the 8-10 minute mark, push in the kiss, then let the cookies bake the last two minutes. The kiss keeps it shape, but now it is as soft as the cookie when you bite into it.

The cookies were perfect-tasting. The peanut butter was not overwhelming. My only problem is that 2 hours later, the kisses are still not hard yet.

Very good recipe.  I made them too big, however, and only ended up with about 62 huge cookies.  Next time will try making them smaller.

Turned out perfect. I added a little more flour for our high altitude and used all butter and they were just what I was hoping for -- soft and chewy with a chocolate topper.

These are delicious! They are my boyfriend's favorite cookie so I wanted to surprise him with a batch for Valentine's Day, and these came out amazing! I have already eaten 4 of them :) I did not adjust the recipe at all, it is just perfect. Although, I put in 48 for the quantity, and when the recipe quantities changed, it called for 1-1/4 egg - I did not know how to do that, but I attempted to crack only part of an egg in for the 1/4 but the whole thing went in, making it 2 whole eggs. It didn't seem to affect the recipe at all - these are moist and delicious!!

Perfect....my go to recipe from now on.  My son even asked me to make a version without the chocolate kisses!   I followed Liz in MN advise, and baked them for 8 mins at 350 (in my convection oven), then put the kisses on the cookies, and back in the oven for a couple minutes.  Really wonderful, soft, tasty cookie that held together and not crumbly or too sweet.  All flavors in perfect balance.

These were amazing! The best peanut butter blossoms I've ever had (and better yet - I made them!) I chilled the dough and chilled again once I made the balls - just didn't want the cookies to spread. I don't know if that was necessary, but they turned out perfect!

My husband said they are addictive. We are trying to eat healtier & I'm attempting to replace a few ingredients at a time without changing the taste of the cookies. I replaced brown sugar with organic coconut sugar, & 1 1/2 cups with coconut flour & added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter. After the changes I got 8 dozen cookies.

Excellent cookies just the way they are.  My five year old daughter had fun rolling the balls in sugar and putting in the kisses.  This is a good recipe for young children to help with.

Yhis is a very good recipe I've been making it for a long time with a few changes. I add 1/2 cup softened butter or margarine, I use 4 cups of flour, and instead of milk I use half and half.

Terrific and makes a ton.  Use butter instead of shortening.  Spray pan with Pam, cook for 8 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove from oven and push in the chocolate in the middle. Put back into oven for an additional 2-3 minutes.

Terrific!  Have tried other recipes for this cookie and have been disappointed with crumbly cookies. This first go-round yielded tasty cookies with a delicate, but slightly chewy crumb.  My preference is for using chocolate stars (Brachs brand), rather than kisses for the lower profile benefit of storing and packaging.  Will make these again.  Thanks.

I substituted melted butter for shortening and got fantastic results. I accidentally made most of my cookies a bit too large but even when I got them down to the right size there was no way it was going to make 7 dozen. Outstanding recipe though, will be making this one again! Chewy and soft and delicious and the cookies are beautiful to display.

These are the originals!  They are very good...everyone loves these cookies!  If you want a stronger peanut butter taste, you could add a bit more peanut butter.  Personally, I like the balance of peanut butter and chocolate in this recipe.  I plan to make them again and again!  I baked them for 8-9 min., added the chocolate kiss and returned to the oven for 2 more minutes as suggested by other reviewers.  This kept the chocolate kiss soft.  Thanks for this classic, old-school recipe.

This was the best recipe I've found for this cookie! I used butter instead of shortening (not a fan), otherwise followed the recipe as written. The batter was nice & fluffy, and the cookies turned out wonderfully! I made some with milk chocolate kisses & some with dark chocolate; I can't wait to make variations with different types of kisses & "candy corn" pumpkins for fall. I'm not a baker, more of a cook (I really don't like to bake, actually), and this recipe gave me a great payoff...my 11-year-old son was VERY happy to have some home-baked cookies from mom! Thank you so much!

I couldn't find my recipe for these cookies, so I used this one. Not a bad recipe. The first batch (10 minutes at 375) came out flat, dark, and crispy. I reduced the temp to 350 and the time to 9 minutes, and subsequent batches came out "blonde" and soft like they're supposed to be so you can push the kiss down into the center.

These are pretty good, but my first batch lacked something... Hubby (who loves cookies) popped one in his mouth and said ehhh.... So the next batch I made I doubled the peanut butter- so if you're finding the taste a little off like I did, try that... Still could use a little something extra just not sure what yet. I did use the Crisco butter flavor, maybe next time I will just try butter.
Also, do not make these too big! My first pan I thought that doesn't seem like enough so i made the 2-3 teaspoons and it wasn't right for this kind of cookie. So one teaspoon really is enough for the right size cookie!!

I love these cookies. I followed the other readers advice and took them out after 8 minutes, put the kiss in the cookie and baked another 1 1/2 minutes. They are perfect. Will definitely do that from now on. These are a keeper.

I've been to a lot of holiday cookie exchanges and these are always a favorite to share. However, this recipe is by far the BEST that I have tasted. My family went nuts! Unfortunately, some recipes can yield cookies that are too crunchy or not enough peanut butter or some with too much peanut butter. THIS recipe was soft and chewy (cooked on the min. time), even WITH the tasty chocolate morsel in the middle and had just enough peanut butter flavoring. Thank you for sharing. Will definitely make these over and over again!

Moist and delicious!  Tried other recipes with mixed results but this one always turns out for me.  Recommend you try this and follow the directions.  Swap out ingredients after you've used the main recipe a couple of times. ;)

Thesse cookies are delicious, but i have a few variations to make them perfect it won't disapoint. Chill the dough for a few hours. For a slight more moist cookie, use butter instead of shorting, they don't come out flat this way.Bake the cookies at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, then pull them out of the oven and put kisses on them, then put the kisses on them, put back in oven for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Let cool before putting them away.

These are the best Peanut Blossom cookies I have ever had! The recipe uses a lot of peanut butter so the flavor really comes out in the final product. I made the recipe exactly as stated, and it was so easy; makes a lot of dough so a lot of cookies! I look forward to making this recipe for years to come.

DELICIOUS! I under-baked these cookies a tad bit and they stayed soft and moist for three or four days after baking. Once the chocolate hardens (after being pressed into the cookie), these are pretty durable and can be easily transported in a bag with no damage to appearance.

I love how easy these are.  They are always the first cookies that I turn to when I feel like baking.

But can anyone get 84 cookies?  I usually don't pay attention, today I measured them really carefully and still only got 64

I used butter flavored Crisco to make the dough. I then rolled the "balls" in turbinado sugar (Sugar in the Raw) and topped them with Hershey Kisses MELTAWAYS, rather than regular kisses. I had planned on making them with Dove chocolates and then priced them. Using Dove would have brought the price of this recipe to high for me personally. MELTAWAYS are not bitter and are creamier than Regular kisses.

This was my first time ever making these cookies and they turned out great. My 3 year old helped me with these by unwrapping the kisses, rolling the dough in the sugar, mixing and setting the kiss in the center.  She loved them too :)  My only mistake was making them a little to large.  We halfed the recipe to make 42 and I ended up with just about 20 cookies!

I made these cookies yesterday and had my first one today and it was amazing. I put them out for our Christmas party and they were all gone except for the ones I hid for me. The only thing I did different was use butter instead of shortening.

wow...GREAT recipe.  I followed the directions to a T and they came out wonderfully!  I love how cute they look, by far the most professional-looking cookie I've made, not to mention delicious too.  I'll be gifting these for the holidays and saving some for myself too :)

I also substituted 1 cup butter for the shortening, kept everything else the same, baked for 10 minutes at 350 and they came out awesome!!!  Was tempted to go with the recipe on the back of the bag of Hershey Kisses but glad I went with this one.  YUMMY!!!

These cookies are delicious.  My husband even thought they were good and he isnt a fan of peanut butter cookies. Did not make any revisions to recipe.

These were very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and hoped for a little more peanut butter taste, I might add more peanut butter next time. I rolled them in green and red sugar to make them festive for Christmas.

Easy and it has the taste of just what it is, a peanut butter cookie with chocolate candy.

These cookies were perfect! An instant favorite for my roomie & the BF. I've made them before, but rolling them in sugar makes them a little bit prettier. One thing I did notice was that I didn't need the 1/2 cup for decorating, so perhaps you could use 1/4. I baked mine for only 10 minutes and they came out just right! Thanks for this classic recipe!

Great recipe. Made these for a cookie exchange. Didn't have enough kisses, so did most of the cookies with a chocolate chip.

I made this and they taste great.  The only problem I had with the recipe was that the cookies spread out too much.  They still taste great.  P.S. I decorated them with green and red sprinkles for Christmas.

I make cookies to give away every christmas and these are always a favorite! This recipe is great! One thing that I do is put chocolate and peanut butter kisses in the center instead of plain. They don't hold the kiss shape but they make cute little buttons for peanut butter freaks like me to enjoy even more :)

These cookies are pretty good. I used butter flavored Crisco. I would have liked more of a peanut butter taste. That would really help to improve these.

These cookies were good, but a little too peanuty for me, I will cut the peanut butter back to 3/4 cup next time. Also, although we ate every last one, they crumbled and unfortunately did not transport well across the states well.

I have been making my Mom's recipe for Peanut Blossoms and they always crack and fall apart.  So, I decided to search for a new recipe this year.  I have found my replacement with this recipe. Absolutely terrific cookie.

Couldn't get any better than this!!  I have made these for years using a different recipe but the cookie was always dry and cracked, so i thought i would give this recipe a try, wow, it is way better.  The cookie is very moist and not crumbly with a very nice peanut butter taste. I may just eat them all.

Don't make my mistake and decide to use the cherry cordial Hershey's kisses - they melt and make a big mess!  I also lowered the temp to 350, because my chocolate was getting a little crispy on top.

The perfect peanut butter cookie dough. I made half the batch but added a few extra Tbs. peanut butter. I did some with the traditional criss-cross pattern and the others I chopped some white and chocolate almond bark into small chunks and used in place of kisses. Great!

Made these over the holidays this year and everyone loved them. My neice didn't even want the Hershey Kiss in the middle - she just removed it and ate the cookie!  Also very easy - the same neice (age 6) helped me make them and really enjoyed rolling the dough into balls and pushing the Kisses into the cookies once they came out of the oven.  Will definitely be making these again next year!

These are really good (and I don't even really like peanut butter cookies). Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Mine turned out beautifully... nicely cracked and glistening from the sugar. They looked great on my cookie trays for friends and family. Thanks!

These were yummy, consistent cookies.  I used a scoop to form these, so skipped the sugar at the end; they still came out pretty.  These are fun for children to help; putting on the kisses is a blast!

Just made these for our annual cookie exchange. They are fabulous. I used the butter flavor Crisco suggested in another review. I'll be baking these again very soon! thank you

Our Christmas cookie platters just would not be the same without these! My kids love to help roll them, unwrap the kisses, place the kisses, and most of all sample the yummy final product! And with so many different flavors of Kisses now, the possibilities are endless.

I was about to give this recipe 1* and then I thought let me look back to make sure I mixed it correctly. I was right I forgot something the "Brown Sugar". I started over and now they are fantastic! 
Great Recipe!

I have loved this recipe since I was a little girl and my mother would make this at Christmas time. I was thrilled when I found this recipe in a church cookbook several years ago and began making this for my family. It has been a family favorite at Christmas ever since. I just love the peanut butter taste with the chocolaty hershey middle.

These are easy to make and delicious! I recommend using your favorite brand of peanut butter. While generic is ok, a higher quality peanut butter results in a more flavorful cookie.

Love these...so does everyone else when I make them.  I suggest using light brown sugar rather than dark because it makes them a little softer.  I also cook them for 8-9 minutes because I like them a little softer.  Put these in the freezer or fridge as soon as you add the chocolate because it melts quickly.  Should harden up in a few minutes.

Yum! It was a chilly day, and these, along with a hot cup of cocoa, hit the spot! They were easy enough to keep my son's little hands busy, and he loved "helping" me make them. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were tasty and didn't get hard, which it a problem which I have with these cookies usually.  However, these lose a star because they were very difficult to work into balls.  The dough was much too sticky.  I'll be using a different recipe for Peanut Blossoms in the future.

I made these for Christmas baskets this year.  They were a hit.  A really good cookie that stays pretty soft.  I ate plenty of them myself.

These are always a good standby, and the dough is so easy to work with.  The smaller you make the dough balls the better, if you make them too big they crack.

Very good. Be careful not to overbake, the edges get crunchy quick! Still good then though. Try experimenting with all the different kisses available now. I used the regular ones and peanut butter ones.

I was disappointed, the texture was good but the shortening seemed to cut a lot of the sweetness out of the cookie.

Doubt you'll find anyone that doesn't enjoy these cookies. I didn't need quite as much milk but like Chefs on tv I don't measure everything exactly. Pinch of this scoop of that.  :)

Fantastic recipe!  I have been looking for a good recipe for this kind of cookie for a long time... this is it!!  Followed the directions exactly, every batch came out perfectly.  The only slight change was the baking time, probably due to differences in ovens- 9 minutes was all they needed in mine.

I actually found this recipe in a firends cookbook and they were titled chocolate chip. When i read thie ingredients i thought that was weird then when i was done i realixed there were no instructions to add chocolate chips. So i put half a bag in . Well ill tell you after they were done i realized what they were suppossed to be. But the goof ended up just right. It added a special punch to it. Now i always do it with chips.

I used crunchy peanut butter as that was what I had on hand. It was ok. I'm sure it would taste better with regular PB.

These were awesome! Everyone is gobbling them up and can't believe how soft they are. I also used the butter-flavored Crisco and less baking time suggestions. Although I didn't have quite enough of the butter-flavored Crisco, I used a little regular butter to get the full amount and they turned out great. Thanks for the recipe Rosemarie!

Awesome recipe...my husband and sons in laws LOVED them...and I did too - I used butter flavored crisco as others had mentioned and rolled in baker's sugar which is much finer than regular sugar.

I halved the recipe and somehow ended up making only about 36 cookies.  Only ingredient change I made was to use butter rather than shortening.  These cookies were easy to make and have a delicious flavor, but in my oven 10-12 minutes was way too long.  8-9 minutes was perfect for chewy cookies.  Also, I made half the cookies with the kisses and half with M&M candies mixed into the batter - thought those were better.  Will make again.
