I have a favorite Pineapple Zucchini Bread recipe that I've used for probably thirty years and I have never deviated from it until now. This recipe caught my eye as it calls for margarine (I used butter) rather than the typical oil.  While cakes and breads made with butter can tend to be not as moist as those made with oil, the flavor can't be beat. No worries about moistness with this recipe!  It was wonderful.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and used pecans rather than walnuts. The cinnamon is fairly standard, but I enjoyed the not so typical allspice. All of the flavors, from the pineapple to the spices, contribute to produce a nice balance of flavor.  Nothing screams out at you, and I like that.  It was for that reason that I chose to omit the cinnamon from the glaze and I'm pleased I did. The glaze is a sweet finishing touch to the bread, pleasing to the eye as well as the palate. The nuts certainly add texture and crunch, but this bread is so nicely flavored that the nuts are almost a distraction and I think I'd actually prefer this without them. Just a terrific recipe!

First time making bread.  Turned out great, but was more of a cake consistancy rather than a bread.  Was I suppose to drain the juice from the pineapple except for the reserved amount for the glaze?  I didn't... maybe that was the problem.  Very flavorful.  Will make again.  Glaze added special touch to the loaf.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummm!  I made a loaf last night and I liked it so much that I made two more to give as gifts today!  I think that the glaze on top makes it really unique and gives it a great flavor.  Really different, and very moist!

Best I have ever tasted, and this statement is agreed with by all who have had some. It tastes great, even without the glaze! Cuts much better after it has been thoroughly cooled. Thanks Cece!

I used my own recipe for pineapple zucchini bread, but I topped with the glaze from this recipe.  The glaze is delicious and highly recommended.

The best zucchini bread recipe I've tasted.  The pineapple makes it very moist and the nuts add great texture.  At work we take turns bringing it in  for coffee break.  Truly a great way to use zucchini.

Very moist and delicious! It's a bit too sweet for me, even though I didn't use all the sugar, and I can't taste any zucchini...but I have to aggree with other reviewers, it's hard to save some for the next day! Didn't use any glaze and used pecans instead of walnut.

I have no idea why this recipe was rated so highly. It is very  bland, despite the tasty ingredients. You can barely taste the pineapple whether the bread is hot or cold. It was a big disappointment.

What a great loaf! The flavor explodes in your mouth and is so moist! The only suggestion I have is that it was hard to tell between uncooked and moist. So I found it better to cook for an extra 10 minutes. (Mind you I added 1/2 a cup more zucchini and some coconut) -FABULOUS!!

I'm not sure how accurate my rating is considering I modified a bit (used partial whole wheat flour, left out the allspice and the glaze, and used almonds on the top instead of walnuts throughout). It didn't have enough pineapple flavor to it for me and wasn't as moist as other zucchini bread I've made. It wasn't bad though. Also, don't be scared if the eggs seem to scramble when you add the pineapple - it didn't seem to effect the end result.

The smell alone is to die for!  I glazed half, just to see which one is best.  It did not seem to matter to anyone else which was which, because it was all devoured immediately.  It is a bit difficult to cut, crumbly, but fabulous to eat!

very nice bread.  very moist.  I used fresh sweet pineapple and didn't crush it too much so I did have some nice bites of pineapple flavor.  I think that is the key; either use fresh pineapple or buy the pineapple tidbits.

This recipe is devine in taste...the best zucchini bread I have ever had.  The only thing that I had a problem with was that the bread crumbled when sliced (when warm and cold).  I doubled the batch...we ate one while it was still warm and by mid-loaf it just crumbled.  Even the next morning it seemed to fall apart.  Does this hurt the taste?  NO way...it is great but if you are serving it to friends (not three voracious kids and a husband) it isn't quite as pretty as lets say banana bread.

I have made many zucchini breads in my day, but this one was great! The pineapple makes it so moist. I omitted the glaze and added the additional 1 T. pineapple juice to the recipe. This will be gobbled up in no time, and will definately make this one again.

Taste was delicious. 5 star.  
However, the downfall (literally) was that i removed the bread from the pan after 10 minutes as instructed.  Common sense told me this was probably a bad idea and proved correct.  Despite greasing and flouring the bottom of the pan it still stuck. Next time will wait till bread is completely cooled before i remove it.

This recipe is so easy to make and it tastes so good!! The glaze dresses it up and makes it extra yummy! No one even knows there is zucchini in it, until you say the recipe name. It's a great way to use up that last bit of zucchini. I am a pineapple lover, however, and would have preferred the pineapple taste to come through more... it's still great though! Very moist and delicious-- thumbs up!

It had tremendous flavor, but the bread seemed to be a little too moist.  I'm going to have to drain the zucchini before adding it to the 2nd batch. The flavor was all I was expecting and it does tempt you to come back for more.  I may try putting a crumb topping on this one to see if it add another level of flavor and reduces some of the moisture. Good recipe!

Try adding 2 tablespoons of raw shell less sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, it gives the bread a unique flavor. Don't get me wrong the walnuts are delicious also.

Made this with one of the gifted zucchini I received.  (lock your car doors!  It's that time of year!)  Was good.  Just like a spice cake more than a bread.  Wish I'd made them in muffin tins instead.

The bread is not too bad, but the cinnamon overpowers everything. I cannot really taste the pineapple at all, and overall, the bread is pretty bland. I made two loaves because everyone gave such great reviews, but I'm sad to say it was honestly a waste of my time and ingredients.  I'll stick to my own zucchini bread recipe and the lemon bread recipe I found on this site when I'm looking for a light summer bread.  I'll keep looking for a way to use pineapple in baking.  Thanks anyway.

Just made this and it is very good. I diced dried pineapple and mixed in with the glaze. Next time, I will poke hotes with skewer in the top of the baked bread and pour glaze over to make it more moist/more tasty! May even use 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter, too.

My husband says it's the best! Don't expect this to last more than a day - it's very addictive! The spices are just right, not overpowering. I used pecans and they are the perfect compliment to the pineapple. I'll be making this frequently, as I'm sure my family will demand it!

This was a very successful recipe. However, I substituted 1/3 cup canola oil for the butter. I also used sucanat (evaporated cane juice) instead of brown sugar, cutting the amount down to 3/4 cup. I used pecans instead of walnuts, since that's what I had on hand. I also left off the glaze. 

I ended up with a very attractive loaf of zucchini bread that tastes great.

This bread is very well liked by my family. My garden had been yielding extra squash this year so I have been substituting it for the zucchini. I have already made it twice, doubling the recipe both times.  It dissappears fast so I know it's a real WINNER!!  Thanks for sharing it.

I think this may be the best zucchini bread I've ever made. With bumper crop of zucchini in the garden I needed to use more than 1 cup! I made a double batch and baked it in three 8x4 inch pans. Wonderful!

This bread was really good -- my kids ate it up! I substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of the all-purpose flour (so I used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of allspice to balance it out -- whole wheat flour tends to make things taste bland!) I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and I didn't do the glaze -- and my kids still loved it!  The pineapple gave it a unique taste and the texture was perfect.  Oh, also, I used real butter instead of margarine.  Thanks, Cece!

I doubled this recipe to make 2 loaves.  It made enough to also make 2 mini loaves.  I followed the directions exactly and this turned out beautifully.  One of the best zucchini recipes I have tried.  We especially liked the glaze added to it.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Very moist, I almost wish there was more pineapple flavor. The glaze is a nice touch too even though it makes it a bit more messy. One good way to get rid of a zucchini.

This recipe is awesome.  The pineapple makes it so moist.  I had a bumper crop of zucchini this year so I have made a ton of zucchini bread this year, my neighbors love me :)  My next batch will be frozen to be enjoyed throughout the winter and during the holidays.  Yum Yum :)

Anything that turns zucchini into a dessert earns a couple of stars right from the start! Bread was very moist and the pineapple & spices added some good flavor. Much better than plain zucchini bread. My husband and daughter liked it and they're pretty picky. I still prefer banana bread though.

I make zucchini bread because I have never been crazy about zucchini and this is a way to use them up when someone gives them to me.  I have to say its one of the best zucchini breads I have ever tried. The glaze is a great idea. My boyfriend loved it.

This was so good!!  I had to do a few changes but overall it was great.  I didn't add the allspice since I didn't have any,I used pecans and added about 1 tsp of pineapple juice into the bread mixture itself. Also, I got pineapple rings and cut them up to small pieces measuring 1 cup(8 oz).  This way you can actually see the pineapple in the bread.  Finally I baked for 50 minutes and was so moist and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe, love it and will make again.

Excellent recipe!  The only changes I made were that I used yellow summer squash instead of zucchini, and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, because that was what I had in hand.  I doubled the recipe-- one to eat now and one to freeze.  So moist and flavorful!  I'll make it again for sure!

Easy to make, delicious to eat.  Better after the first day. I didn't make the glaze,  instead I used softened cream cheese to spread on each slice.   Love some calories!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  This is nothing special - very little pineapple taste.  I have much better zucchini bread recipes.

This is Excellent with my modifications!

I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of Cinnamon, 1/ 8 o each powdered ginger, clove, All Spice & Nutmeg. 
It turned this recipe into a magical spicy & sweet, moist & tasty loaf!
Oh and since I do not use or purchase margarine (healthy eating reasons) I used organic butter & Coconut Oil.

Used this recipe for years, family favorite! However I make it low fat and low carb as possible an still a hit! I use applesauce instead of butter, splenda brown sugar blend, double the zucchini, reserve more pineapple juice than recommended for glaze, use whole wheat flour instead of regular, and I just use a lot of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg! I also make two loaves, we live in high altitude and it never baked through. For the glaze I didn't have corn syrup and my mother in law said to use maple syrup in it's place and I've done so ever since.

I made these as muffins this morning for my daughter to eat while on her way to school on the bus (almost an hour commute).  I followed the directions almost to the letter, except 1) dumped a whole can of chunk pineapple in with juices, 2) portioned off into muffin tins (lined), 3) before baking topped with a little white granulated sugar (they were plenty sweet enough though!) and 4) baked for about 25 minutes at 350 or until a toothpick came out clean.  SOOOO moist and yummy!  No need for the topping too. (PS:  yielded 18 muffins out of this recipe)
