I would have given this 4 or 5 stars, except the amount of salt was way too much! I should have known not to put so much salt for such a small batch of pancakes, but I just followed the recipe and figured they would be a bit salty. They were barely edible. I was planning to eat them with just butter, but I had to put jam on them, so it was not such a low-carb breakfast for me afterall. Otherwise, the recipe was good, and I will probably make these again, using 1/4 tsp salt or less.

This is a great starter recipe. I found that I needed a little less egg and a little more flour and sugar. Those suggestions though are really dependent on tastes...the recipe is solid. 
I would recommend it hands down. My family really enjoyed the pancakes with a little maple syrup :-)

Starting with a about a cup of dry non-GMO soy beans, I ground them into flour with the dry Vitamix container. I used this to make soymilk (adding water,  cooking to a bubbling point while stirring for a couple of minutes,  adding about three more cups of water water, erithrytol and vanilla to taste), and Vitamix sing it on high for about 30 seconds in the regular container. This is strained, giving about a quart of soymilk for later use.hen used the sediment soy after straining for the pancakes.

For some reason, when I made mine, the pancakes were gooey and while they rose in the pan, the quickly dropped when out and were raw like in the middle.   I personally didn't care for them.

Not a recipe if you're in a hurry. Do not judge the finished product by the taste of the dough! As long as you cook 'em nice and brown, the end result is fantastic!

Flipping is a problem- definitely follow the author's advice and make smaller, thinner pancakes. Adding a bit of extra flour can alleviate the problem too. My pancakes weren't pretty but boy, were they good! Tastes similar to French toast! Goes great with cinnamon agave.
