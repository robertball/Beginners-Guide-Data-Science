These deviled eggs definitely reminded me of a traditional deviled egg that tends to be a little on the sweet side.  I thought they were very flavorful and were well received in my house.  I am not sure that I would use this exact recipe again only because of the use of the sweetened condensed milk.  I typically only buy it for specific recipes and since this only uses 1/4 tsp or so I will need to find a use for the remaining before it spoils.  I also added just a little more mayonnaise for our personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe. We had invited a few friends over for a little southern style dinner and they just couldn't keep their hands off of it. Also my children loved it so much that they wanted more the next day. Very quick and easy to make. You cant go wrong with this one:)

My family loved them, I added relish and used honey mustard instead with no black olives ( I made them for a family gathering and not everyone eats black olives) . My first time making them and it was an easy and fast recipe.

Just made these for easter.  Poke holes in the eggs after boiling,  put into cold water,  the sleeves slide right off.  I put the egg mixture in a ziploc bag,  and pipe.  I needed a good recipe,  and thank you..

Super easy I substituted the mustard with honey mustard since it's what I had on hand. Turned out great.
