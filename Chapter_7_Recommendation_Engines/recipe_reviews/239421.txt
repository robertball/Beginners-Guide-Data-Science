I have been making cinnamon rolls for almost 40 years.  I always used the same recipe up until today.  This recipe is the best batch of cinnamon rolls I have ever made!  Family and friends all agreed!
I was looking for something that would use the yeast I had left over from Christmas.  I was intrigued that this recipe called for 
2 TBS of yeast.  If you are wondering how many packets that would be
1 packet = 2¼ tsp
2 Tbsp = 6 tsp.
You will need 2 whole packets PLUS 1½ tsp. out of a third packet.   A lot of yeast but well worth it.   I did reduce the brown sugar slightly as a personal preference.  The recipe called 1/4 tsp of salt in the caramel topping.  However I did not put the salt in the caramel instead I sprinkled sea salt in the prepared pans.  It gave the sweet caramel just the perfect taste of the the saltiness I have learned to love in my salted caramel candies.  Enjoy!!!!

I love this site, used tons of recipes-almost always with great results- yet I've never felt compelled to post a review, but these buns are utterly amazing. I bake weekly and have for years but never have I made anything quite so perfectly delicious in every way. You must try these..the brown sugar caramel,the salted pecans, the fragrant cinnamon,  the tender yeast bread...each lovely, but the combination is breath-taking. Seriously. I tried to add a picture but it seemed to be sideways, nevertheless, try these rolls...

THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I have made A LOT of cinnamon rolls in my life, but I wanted to try the salted carmel sauce with pecans. Boy am I glad I did. This is my 'go to' recipe from now on and I'll pass this recipe onto future generations.  (Note: I needed to put foil on the lower shelf of the oven, as my pans bubbled over with goodness :) Be sure to tip the pans onto a plate IMMEDIATELY out of the oven, as the sauce cools very quickly.

We really enjoyed this sticky buns! My husband brought them to work and there were none left on his return! 
I ended up having to add a cup and half of flour to get the right texture. Because of this, I wish I would have doubled the filling and caramel recipe and made 3 plates instead of 2. 
OTHERWISE, Amazing! I'll make again! Thank you Diamond Crystal!

I made these just as described except that I have a convection oven so I had to bake them for only 20 minutes.   They were a huge success.   In fact, I was only planning to make a half batch but forgot and made 2 pans and was glad I did since one pan disappeared in less than an hour.    Wonderful!

So good, so sweet. This was a great recipe. I added a sprinkle of salt on top of the sticky buns to cut the sweetness a bit but it was a great Sunday treat. Really good hot, so microwave if necessary.

Great recipe! I made it almost exactly as stated (minus nuts), but I made the dough the night before and let it rise for 30 minutes. I then made the caramel and rolls to go in the fridge. I pulled them out early in the morning and let them rise for about 75 minutes before cooking in the convection oven for 24 minutes. Wow, they were fantastic!

This was, indeed, delicious!!! I was lazy and didn't feel like making the dough since I had a leftover frozen loaf of Brigford's dough. I used the one loaf and split the recipe in half for the sauce and filling. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used a substitute of milk and butter I found on line. Probably could have skipped that since I only needed 1 1/2 tbsp.  I would definitely make this again!! YUM!

Perfect! We have decided to make these delicious treats our new holiday staple for breakfast! I didn't change a thing. t would suggest either using larger pans or placing a cookie sheet on the rack underneath, as it did make a sugary mess on the bottom of my oven. Worth it, though. YUM!

My mom's recipe is second to none, but I was looking for something with whole wheat.  This is it!  Even my " fussy" daughter could not tell these were whole wheat, the texture was so lovely.

Grrr...I always hit done before I’m done. So—make ahead method...   I made the dough at night, as well as the caramel sauce. Left the sauce in the pan overnight at room temp. The dough I covered loosely with plastic wrap that I also sprayed with grease to prevent from sticking and so there’d be room for it to rise in the fridge.        In the morning, heated up the sauce, punched down the dough and let rest about 10 min. It rolled out beautifully, and I let the formed rolls rise another 30 in a slightly warm oven with a damp towel over the pans. Only mods made were that I used my stand mixer to “knead” instead of by hand (I’m lazy lol), and it took closer to 5 c. Flour....omitted the salt in the actual caramel sauce, opting to sprinkle a bit of sea salt instead prior to coating pans with sauce. And, of course, making the night prior and letting rise in the fridge! Baked at 300 (convect) about 30 min. :-)delish!

Wow these are amazing! Made them for someone special who loves sticky buns but can't ever seem to find really good ones. He likes extra gooey and lots of nuts so I doubled the sauce and nuts portion of the recipe - turned out great, but be careful they are a little more messy when flipping. Rather than two pans, I used a nonstick half sheet pan that comes with a lid - turned them over onto a jelly roll pan and put the lid on when they cooled; very little mess and perfect storage.  Enjoy!

Been making cinnamon rolls for many years but decided to try a different recipe.  These were delicious.   I had one comment, you are using real butter, cream and then using cooking spray on the pans?   Use real butter and stay away from fake butter.

This is my first time making cinnamon buns.  I wanted them to be just out of the oven on Christmas morning so I let them rise in the fridge overnight. The only change to the recipe was using only 4 teaspoons of Rapid rise yeast and using the dough cycle on my bread machine.  They rose perfectly and pretty high.  They were great right after baking, but I actually liked the second batch better the next day.

Could a person use frozen bread loaves to make these rolls?
I think you would have to thaw the bread and then roll them out and put the filling on and then the caramel .

I made these non dairy using margarine, almond milk and soy cream. 
They were amazing. 
I did make minor changes - added only 1tbsp dried yeast and it was more than enough, the dough rose in an hour at room temp. 
I did need less liquid. I used the cup of milk and about ¼ cup of water. Could just have been the flour so I suggest adding less liquid, mixing and then seeing how wet the dough is. Even with ¼ cup water it was still a very wet dough.
I also added an extra sprinkle of salt when I flipped them out because I felt it didn't taste like salted caramel but... Again, this might just have been the brand I used, I suggest tasting.
Overall, really wonderful, I'll be making these again and again.

Perfect, all of it perfect. 
I used Fat free half and half instead of whole cream because that's what I had on hand.
Also, 1 packet of active yeast is fine for half a batch and 2 packets of active yeast for the full batch. My rolls doubled beautifully. You only need to increase to 3 packets if you go above 8 cups of flour.

Amazing! Finally a perfect dough, so easy to work with. Only substitute I made was as I had no heavy cream on hand, I melted cream cheese in its place and added 2 tsp milk. Also I made 1 1/2 times the caramel sauce and filling. Family wen nutz! They won’t last the day. Definitely will be a regular recipe for me.

Must've done something wrong the bread texture was almost crumbly. I didnt have cream so I used sweetened evap and it was pretty yummy but not as drippy gooey as I'd have hoped. 
going to try again with fresh flour. I think it's probably a perfect recipe tried by an imperfect baker lol! Thanks

Loved the caramel. The dough was a little too soft. Maybe should have added more flour. I used 3 packets of rapid rise yeast. Baked for 20 minutes. Probably should have left another five.

I always need to make multiple pans of these sticky buns. My entire family loves them and I spend the day delivering them. I havent changed anything.  The next day I hear them for 30sec. And add butter and they are still delicious. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are wonderful. Sort of time consuming but it's totally worth it. Served warm with vanilla bean Ice cream, oh my. I substituted the pecans with walnuts and that was a great choice. Also I cooked them on 315 for 25 mins. They were soo soft like melt in your mouth soft. Definitely keeping this recipe on hand.

This was a great recipe! I will definitely make it again. I did add more butter to the filling. Instead of brushing 2 TBLS on each rectangle, I softened a 1/2 cup of butter and spread 1/4 cup on each rectangle.

I added a little more salt because was using a different kind. Delicious and will make again. Were just as good reheated. I used whole milk because I had no cream
