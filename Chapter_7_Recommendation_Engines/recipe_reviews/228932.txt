Yum! I added an extra splash of lemon juice and used a little less greek yogurt than called for. Delish! Second time around I added a splash of red wine vinegar (just because I love it) and it was a great addition too!

I used plain yogurt and added either oregano or thyme. It goes without saying, I added extra garlic. Very tasty!

I changed this recipe to make it healthier, and it was still delicious. I didn't add salt, I only used 1 tbs EVOO and I used 1/2 cup of plain non-fat regular yogurt(not greek)instead of sour cream. This cut the fat by 70% and the consistency stayed the same since regular fat-free yogurt is runnier than sour cream, thus less oil is necessary. I served right away, without refrigerating.

I'm a lemon lover---that's for sure.  I did like this, but it was missing something when I used it on my salad tonight.  I added a little balsamic vinegar to my salad, and that made this very good, so I'm thinking that for a salad it needed just a very very little bit of sweetness--maybe honey or a pinch of sugar--just to cut that acid.  If I try this tomorrow and I have a different take on it, I'll come back and edit my opinion.  I'll be glad to try this on fish!

My new favorite dressing! I made a few changes, the most significant one being the amount of garlic: even though I usually double it in everything, I only used 1 clove after trying it with 3 and burping garlicky for 2 days. Also, I use 3/4 cup fat free yogurt to 1/4 cup olive oil to reduce fat because, trust me, this salad dressing is so delicious you will want to slather your veggies in it!!

This is quite tasty as written, but becomes five stars if you add a touch of honey (that helps with the acidity coming from the lemon). I didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt, which worked fine (I'm sure sour cream would also have been tasty). Nice dressing for a variety of salads. Thanks for sharing!

This is so fabulous!! I am allergic to sour cream and yogurt, so substitued organic mayonnaise.  It seemed too tart, so I added about 2t. sugar while blending.  PERFECT!!! I have been buying EXPENSIVE salad dressing that is not as good as this!!   Definitely a repeatable dressing!

I added 2 tsp on honey as others have suggested and liked honey balancing the tartness of lemon. Turned out well. Will make it again. Excellent recipe. - Lata

Absolutely delicious!  I put it on my butter lettuce salad with rotisserie chicken, English cucumber, tomato, and avocado. I was thinking I might add a little dill next time- or not!  Highly recommend!

Great recipe! Whenever a recipe calls for garlic I always add more than the recommended amount because I love it. Made no exceptions for this recipe. So good!

I didn't have cream cheese or sour cream, but I did have a ripe avocado that I needed to use.   This added a rich, creamy dimension to the dressing that I think I'll continue to use.  What I fell short on in lemon juice, I made up with white balsamic.  This dressing over a simple bed of arugula and Parmesan shavings was a hit!

Delicious! Love the sharp, tart taste. This will dress our salad perfectly. Thanks, I will be keeping this recipe around for years to come :)

Yum! Made this for a quinoa salad and it added so much flavor. Used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added a teaspoon of honey for sweetness. Husband approved!

Way too lemony. I used fat free yogurt and then had to add regular sour cream to cut the lemon taste.

This is very bright and very light if sour cream is subbed with Greek yogurt and..... a good splash of Worcestershire and a little more salt softens the tart edginess of the lemon and yogurt.

I wasn't sure what to make of it after I tasted it for the first time.  It certainly was tart!  After about 3 spoonfuls I was hooked.  I also meant to try it with a little sweetness but didn't get around to it this time - maybe next time.
