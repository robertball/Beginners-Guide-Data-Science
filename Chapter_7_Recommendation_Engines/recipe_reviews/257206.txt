2.27.17  These muffins baked up beautifully, exactly 12.  Seriously, I think these may be the best banana muffins I’ve ever had.  They are super moist, tender, and just bursting with banana flavor in every bite  Followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn’t change a thing.   House of Cochrane thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, it’s going into my Favorites folder.****UPDATE 6.6.18:  This is one of my favorite muffin recipes, and I make it often.  Today I had some VERY ripe bananas which needed to be used up, and a few blueberries.  I dusted the blueberries with a little flour and added them to the batter.  Baked up beautifully and made the muffins taste even better.

3-30-2017  ~A solid performer.  Given these are light and fluffy, not dense with a tight crumb like a typical banana muffin or banana bread, this would be one to remember when you want a banana cake (um, with chocolate frosting).

I've made the same banana bread recipe forever and decided to make muffins instead. I tried this one because the ratings and reviews were so high.  The only thing I did different was used pecans instead of walnuts--personal preference.  These muffins are AMAZING. My family loved them more than my banana bread, which is huge!  I have to say, I do too. They're nice and very flavorful...a great breakfast or snack.  I think I'll be making these instead of my bread going forward. LOVED THEM! :)

The first time I used  3 small banannas came out a little dry, but the second time my banannas were much larger and they were perfect about 1.5 cups of mashed bannana.

These are rightfully 5 star muffins.  Easy to  make, few ingredients, and are moist, delightfully banana-y, and are perfect for breakfast or snacks.  I wish there was a better measurement that simply 3 bananas, because they vary a lot in size, but I had two very ripe ones and some that were not so ripe.  I cut one of the yellow ones into small dice size and folded them in with the  mashed, and it added some extra texture.   I recommend these to anyone who is starting out learning to bake.  

Second take, my husband said they were a little too sweet.  I cut back the  white sugar and used a little more than 1/2 c brown sugar.  I also added about a quarter cup of oatmeal, and they were perfect.  These will go into the muffin rotation without a doubt.  Thank you.

These were light and delicious!  I normally dislike when people make revisions and substitutions and then rate, but I had to substitute canola oil for butter (didn't realize I was out of it) and I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts (dear daughter doesn't like nuts).  We all agreed it would be better without the chocolate chips. Her friend liked them with the chips.  My husband said next time we will add nuts to half. All in all, the muffin mix itself was excellent!

This recipe is a great start.  However I gradually added more bananas until I got up to 6 bananas and that was the perfect number.  If you only do the bananas in this recipe, it doesn't really taste like banana muffins.  I also replaced the nuts with 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips.  Then they were the best banana muffins I ever made and everyone keeps asking for them again and again.

I have made these twice now and the second time I used half white and half whole wheat flour. I used canola oil instead of melted butter and they came out with a slightly crisp muffin top and a moist crumb. I got 8 large muffins from this recipe. Delicious!

This is a great recipe, I added some chocolate pudding and chocolate chips(in substitute for walnuts) and it tasted better than the original recipe(in my opinion). I will definitely make it again, and encourage other people to give this recipe a try

I follow the recipe and no changes at all it was the first time trying them, they were blend and hardly no flavor. Next time I will add more cinnamon, sugar or applesauce.  Even my brother in law(is a big fan of banana muffins and sweets) didn't like it

Made them last night for my son, who was home from college.  I've  used many different recipes for banana muffins but this is by far the best one yet.  I didn't have walnuts  but, since my son has a sweet tooth, I added a few choc chips.  So moist and delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Love these muffins!  I don't do banana bread well as it doesn't always come out moist.  I decided to try this recipe for muffins.  My banana's were so over ripe.  One was almost liquid.  These turned out so good and moist.  I will probably never make it in a loaf again!  It makes 12, so easy.  I highly recommend.

I made this with the nastiest blackest bananas. I only had two but they were large and very sickeningly sweet. I made mini muffins and they only took 11 minutes to bake.  Delicious.

These muffins are moist and flavorful! I love the cinnamon and nutmeg; it really completes this recipe and separates it from the rest. I've made these twice now, once adding chocolate chips and the other time with toasted pecans. They were easy and turned out delicious both times.

I am not a baker by any means but this recipe, unaltered was easy and tasted amazing. I did read all the other tips/notes before I started and really was diligent about not "over mixing" the banana mixture into the flour mixture...I did simply fold until all blended. Then scooped into cups...Wonderfully moist and very tasty.

I am a total beginner when it comes to baking. These were very quick and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. I used a whisk to mix the banana / sugar mixture and followed another user's advice by not over mixing the dry and wet ingredients. They turned out fantastically well. Just a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg in each bite. Yum!  Will definitely be making these again.

Excellent recipe!  Made it into a 7*9 cake, cooked 35 minutes.
Replaced half a cup of flour for oat bran.
Cut the sugar by half.

After 50 years of baking muffins, this by far the best recipe.  Add a cream cheese icing and you have an excellent dessert

The only change I made to the recipe was I omitted white sugar and used a total of 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I sprinkled flax seed on top. Wonderful!

These are on the bland side., they need more spices. I did get 12 muffins filled almost to the top. They will not rise high, maybe a 1/2 inch. I used 4 bananas. 
The texture is good. 
I will try again with more cinnamon and other spices. walnuts on top gives it a nice crunch.

These were soooo good and fairly easy to make.  I was able to get 12 muffins out of the batter.  It’s important NOT to mix too much before adding the berries. As I had read reviews prior to making , I used smaller amounts of the flour and sugar for the topping.  Still had some left over. 
Will definitely make these again!

Great muffins. I used 5 small ripe bananas. It came out great. Moist with great flavor. And I cut the sugar and added walnuts. Only thing I used paper cups and they stick to the cups. Next time will follow directions. But flavor was spot on

This is a fantastic recipe!  I doubled it, added an extra egg and about 3/4 cup blueberries and used probably 8 - 10 bananas.  I froze some super ripe ones a while back and decided to use them all, plus the ones ripening on the counter. Combining dry and wet ingredients until just barely combined contributed to the moistness of these muffins.  Also, I used two large muffin tins, so with a double recipe ended up with 12 large muffins.  Definitely a keeper!!!

The muffins are dense and very sweet.  I was short one banana but it still turned out okay.  I may make it again.  It did take an extra 2 minutes to bake and may be due to my living at a higher altitude.  I set the timer for 2 minutes early and kept a close watch.

Excellent and easy recipe. Muffins were moist and tasty. I used 3 very ripe medium bananas and added 1/2 cup of peach/apple/carrot unsweetened applesauce (I didn't think I had enough bananas). I used pecans instead of walnuts (it's what I had). My one-year-old nephew loved them and so did I. :)

These were the best banana muffins I've ever had !  I made a few very minor changes:  I used only 1/4 c. white sugar---and used Splenda for Baking instead of both the white and brown sugar the second time I made them.  Perfect amount of sweetness.  I also added 1/2 c. chopped walnuts one time, and the next time I made them, I  added 1/2 c. mini semi sweet chocolate chips instead of nuts.  Yum !

Can’t remember if I reviewed these before but I just made these today and they are absolutely delicious.  It will be my go-to recipe from now on.  I omitted the nuts due to my grandson’s allergies and added some chocolate chips instead but only a scant  1/2 cup because it’s all I had.  They were perfect!

I added an extra banana for moisture because I added a scoop and a half of chocolate protein powder. I also used less white sugar and a bit of honey. They turned out really well.

Being someone who does not really like muffins, I am sharing the feedback of my young adult sons.  They raved about these muffins and both told me to keep this recipe.  They said the flavor was great and the muffins were very moist.

This recipe turned out so well! My friend, who doesn’t even like banana bread or muffins, loved it! I didn’t have any eggs, so I substituted in mayonnaise (weird I know but it worked!). Definitely recommend!

Very good!  Nice texture!  And the center is baked through! Other banana bread, and muffin recipes I have trouble getting the center to bake completely.  I had extra batter left over.  I had doubled the recipe, made 24 muffins.  I poured the remainder in a small oval baking dish.  That even baked completely through.  Hopefully, after the muffins sit for a day the banana flavor will enhance!

Even after three days, these muffins were moist and delicious.  My 10-year old daughter and I had these for breakfast for the last three days in a row.  I left out cinnamon because my daughter doesn't like them.

No walnuts...wish I had some. Next time! 
Baking right now. I'm  excited.  I want to put a drizzle of icing on them. Or maybe a brown sugar and butter icing drizzled on. 
Yum.
 They will go great with coffee in the morning.

The muffins are great texture but I added cinnamon and nutmeg because I don't like bland muffins and they were delicious with those! I also ran out of eggs and white sugar when I made them so *for a double batch* I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 2 eggs and 3/4 cup honey for the full amount of white sugar

I made these and they were so delicious.  My husband said they had such a great flavor.  Very easy to make.  The recipe called for 3 large bananas but I used 4 medium to large and I also used pecans instead of walnuts.   I think next time I’ll add 1/2 cup of nuts instead of the 1/3 it ask for.  Just to make it nuttier.  Great recipe highly recommend.

Delicious light-textured muffins. Very quick to make, due to the fact that the butter is melted as opposed to softened and creamed. They rose beautifully. I added about a quarter-cup each of plain yogurt and quick oats for a slightly more substantial texture, and chocolate chips because they go so well with banana! Definitely adding this as a go-to muffin recipe

I doubled the recipe to get a few extra muffins, and added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe calls for just because. It definitely enhanced the banana overall I think. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This was a great recipe. I did adapted it though. Only having 2 of 3 bananas, I subbed about 1/2 cup of Apple Butter. Because of this, I omitted the brown sugar and only put in 1/2 cup white sugar. Also I only put 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 tsp. Lastly, I added 3/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. These are so moist and taste great!

I followed this recipe to the T except I excluded the walnuts, and it turned out AMAZING! Not too sweet, perfectly moist, fluffy, and light texture. They were a big hit with the kids! So easy to make that my 3 year old helped ??

It could probably be used a short a bread recipe. But I loved the neatness of serving the muffins and how quickly they backed compared to the banana bread I've made for years. I sprinkled the nuts on top of half of them since not everyone likes nuts and this way they could see which ones had the nuts. It made 12 sensible sized muffins but I wish I had made larger ones just so my "1 serving" lasted longer!  This is a GREAT recipe!!

Super yuumy and moist muffins. I substituted the white sugar for coconut sugar, and didn't add the brown sugar, but they were still plenty sweet. I also made them in my Thermomix, following along with the basic banana bread recipe that comes on the chip but adding the muffin ingredients instead. Too easy!

Nice and moist. Made 12 muffins. I exchanged 1/2 cup flour with rolled oats and used 1 tsp apple pie spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg, (I usually go back and forth between apple and pumpkin pie spice depending on what I'm making). I did add the walnuts. I mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately then added the two together just till combined.

I love this recipe because of how easy it is to follow and make. I have made this twice now : 1) using sifted method and 2) whisking the dry ingredients. Both ways result in moist, delicious muffins. You can make this recipe in a jumbo muffin tin and will yield 6 muffins perfectly. Also, i dont measure the extract or cinnamon as you can never have enough in your baked goods. LOVE THIS!

Made this as mini-muffins for friends at work, and got a bit over three and a half dozen.  They absolutely raved over them.  Cooking time was 12 minutes in the tiny dark surfaced nonstick tins.

I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar and crushed walnuts on top before baking. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white flour. 
Also used Toasted chopped Pecans
And 4 very ripe small bananas.    Made 12 reg size muffins  and 4 larger muffins. 
Very Moist and Delicious.

Really good and not that hard to make. For some reason mine took about 24 mins to cook but it might have just been my oven. Will definitely use this recipe again when I have overripe nanas!

Moist, light and fluffy with a slight crunch when you bite into the top of one, most likely from the brown sugar. Thanks for a great recipe!

I liked the addition of cinnamon & nutmeg in this recipe vs other banana muffin recipes I’ve tried. I also enjoyed the texture of the muffin top after baking, kinda thick and chewy.

I halved the recipe and there was enough batter to make 9 muffins. I used a standard muffin tin. I didn't have baking soda so I used a little more baking powder. Next time I make these, I would like to use a streusel topping.

I had a surplus of bananas to use.  Always looking for a new, moist banana recipe.  I found this with the addition of nutmeg and cinnamon and thought I would try.  Excellent!  Followed recipe as is.   The spices are so flavourful.  This is now our household go to.

These are amazing! I only had 2 fairly big bananas but didn't want to waste them, it did not effect the taste. Other than that I made them exactly as the recipe states. This is definitely one I'll keep in my favorites and make again! Texture and flavor are wonderful!

These are moist and have a light texture, more cake like than muffin like.  Trying a few recipes out, while these are good, not the ultimate.

I did follow the recipe and made a dozen regular size muffins. I thought they came out really moist and light too. These are good breakfast muffins since they taste buttery and are not too sweet either. I will use 3/4 cup of sugar next time I bake the muffins. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe!  I have bananas constantly coming out of the garden here and this recipe will come in handy.  I add just a pinch of ground cloves and adjust the sugar as to what variety of banana I have at hand.

This recipe will be my go to banana muffin recipe for now on!!! Cooking is very subjective, so with that I rated the recipe 5 stars for my family.  I made the recipe exactly, no modifications.  We loved the muffins and mine looked like the picture!  I used a jumbo 6 muffin pan. I started with 17 minutes and then added 5 extra minutes for 22 mins. total. I will do one minute less next time because of my oven.  Also, I have an electric oven and when the preheat timer goes off the oven still needs a good 15 minutes extra preheat.( Per the manufacturers manual.) So I turn the oven on and wait a good 20 minutes before putting the muffins in the oven.  Great texture, great flavor, Sweet enough  for our family( also depends on how sweet your muffins are), but not overly sweet. If you like sweeter muffins add a few extra TBS of white sugar. I did add the nuts, but I think I will add  1/2 cup next time, because we love more nuts.  Yum, I will have more ripe bananas in a few days . I can't wait!

I make these all the time now.  My granddaughter will not eat bananas but always asks for these.  They are simple and easy to make and therefore turn out perfect every time!  Thank you!

Perfect use of overripe bananas! I had everything on hand and used pecans rather than walnuts as a personal choice. Moist and delicious

I made these in my mini muffin pan, used a gluten free all purpose flour that measures 1:1, and cooked them for 12 mins. They were amazing, I had to try them out before my hubby & son got into them :D

I was looking for a recipe to use up some ripe bananas and thought I would give this a try.   They were moist and not overly dense.  They had a nice banana flavor.   I did not use the walnuts, but, I would definitely add them next time.

I have one grandchild who always wants muffins for breakfast when she spends the night at my house. Lutzflcat and Kim's Cooking Now made me know that this would be a really good recipe, and they were exactly right. I don't usually like muffins or quick bread without the nuts (had to omit them per child's instructions); but these muffins were light, airy, and perfectly sweet. The best part is that they passed the grandkid test!

2/27/17: I had just read lutzflcat's review on these, and decided to put the 3 over-ripe bananas in my fruit bowl to use! These are very good, and so easy to whip together. Mine didn't turn out as pretty as hers, but they were delicious!
