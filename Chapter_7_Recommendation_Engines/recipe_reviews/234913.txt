This soup is a keeper. It was excellent as laid out in the recipe, proportions and spices just right.  I admit to omitting the maple syrup as I would only have used the real kind but did not have it on hand.  I think, though, that I would still opt for the unsweetened version. By the way, I made it as a stovetop soup and we were eating it within the hour.  Great winter soup with a baguette and cheese.

I made some changes based on what I had in stock. Added Tomatoes, celery, garlic, and yellow curry. I had to use 2% milk. Yum yum!! I'll definitely make this again!!

Made on cooktop. Sauted veggies in cayenne infused olive oil. Used whole milk in place of cream. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I are vegans, so I substituted almond milk for cream.  I also had some Thai curry paste on hand and used some of that, as we like food with a "kick."  In our opinion, the one ingredient that should have been omitted was the cinnamon.  We like cinnamon, but not in this soup.  Trying to avoid extra sugar, I also omitted the maple syrup.  Before I added the cinnamon, I loved the taste and texture.

I had eaten a soup like this on a trip to New England last year so I was excited to find this.  After it was ready however, I was a tad disappointed.  It didn't seem to have very much taste to it.

I'll definitely make this again soon. I used fresh ginger root and doubled the curry powder, so it was a tiny bit spicier. I also used heavy cream instead of half-and-half. I didn't notice that it called for cinnamon â€” oops. Next time.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I made this later in the day so I didn't want to use the crock pot so I cooked this in my pressure cooker for 20 minutes.  Came out wonderfully.  Very good soup.  Husband loved it :)

This is delicious, I also added black eyed peas and almond milk.  I decided not to blend it to make a creamy soup, and so it was a stew.  I added more curry and ginger than the recipe recommended and i will make it that way again.

This turned out fantastic, with a few changes. I used a can of light coconut milk and 3 cups of vegetables broth, and red curry paste, a pinch of ground ginger and cinnamon. I also ended up having to cook it on high in my crockpot to actually soften the sweet potatoes. overall good base recipe. I love the the blended sweet and spicy flavor.

I used vegetable broth, almond milk, and regular curry. I would recommend adding a little more spices than recipe suggests but that is my personal preference. Easy to make. T

Wonderful! I made this with regular curry powder and almond milk instead of the 1/2 and 1/2. A hit at a recent party. 
Didn't have time for crock pot so cooked on stove top for about an hour. Added milk and maple syrup just before serving.
