I'm sorry to say, but this was horrible.  I had a very hard time shaping these cookies, and the taste was very bland.  Wouldn't try again.

I wanted to try this one because making the little faces sounded so fun. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar to make the cookies slightly less sweet, added a half tsp of baking powder and a full tsp of allspice. I'm not sure any of the changes were really necessary. To form the cookies into rolls, place a piece of waxed paper on the counter and spoon the dough onto the paper in a rough line. Then roll up the paper over the dough and pat it gently into shape. If you try to do this with your bare hands it will never work. I stuck the dough in the freezer and made my cookies very big (one log instead of several small ones). Once the dough was firm I unrolled it from the wax paper and sliced it with a sharp knife. Worked just fine! Then I had a blast making the little faces. Since my cookies were so big I expected them to take longer to bake, but the first batch was starting to burn on the edges within ten minutes. For the second batch I turned the oven down to 350 and baked them about 11 minutes. They looked slightly underdone when I took them out, but firmed up as they cooled. They did spread more than I expected (might have been due to the baking powder I added). They have a light peanut-butter flavor and I think they're very good. Next time I may use cinnamon instead of allspice. This would be a good party activity for kids--make the dough ahead of time, stick it in the fridge, then slice and let the kids decorate.
