This recipe gets four stars for its ease and simplicity.  We enjoyed it, but as stated in the recipe, it is very basic.  We found petite Sirloin fillets that were already thin enough so no pounding required. I would definitely add the onions next time around for flavor and perhaps some mushrooms.  The recipe states to add 1 Table Spoon of Water if it is too thick, I had to add at  five over the course of the cook time so be prepared for that.  Overall this is an extremely easy recipe that delivers a basic Stroganoff.  Thank you!
