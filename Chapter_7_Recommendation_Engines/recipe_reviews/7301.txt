First- a qualifier- this is a review of the yellow cake portion of the recipe only: The yellow cake recipe is simply divine. It is so easy- can make it in one bowl and by hand if you choose. I did mine in a rush and by mistake put in baking soda instead of baking powder. I used 3/4 cup oil and 1 1/4 cup white wine (Chardonnay I had on hand). I used unbleached all purpose flour and organic sugar (evaporated cane juice). I did not have time to slice each layer. Texture was springy not too dense and held it's shape well when taking it out of the pan and later when cutting. The cake doesn't crumble so it is easy to handle. I put some fruit only strawberry spreadable fruit in between the layers and a chocolate ganache on top and sides and for decoration. The chocolate ganache was 1 pint organic heavy cream brought barely to the boil poured over 12 oz. semi sweet chocolate chips melted chilled and whipped. The flavors blended gorgeously the wine of the yellow cake with the semi-sweetness on the ganache. A huge crowd pleaser complex enough for discerning adults and yummy for kids too. I am sure the chestnut version is delectable- just didn't have any on hand. THANKS!
