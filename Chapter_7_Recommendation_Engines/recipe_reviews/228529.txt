This was pretty easy since it was the very First thing I have EVER smoked! I have a combo gas, charcoal, smoker. It was a trick to 1. Start the smoker, ( Good thing I wasn't Appling as a contestant on Survivor!! LOLOL ) LOSER!  & 2. keeping the proper temperature going. I had my spray bottle of water, which helped even more then closing the dampers, they only did so much but still too hot. My 13 lb. brined turkey took less then 2 hours. Too hot, I get it:) It was very good! I did give hubby a piece before we ate dinner and he thought it was ham. It was a Smokey Thanksgiving as I also served Ham! hahaha. Thank You Tom T. had fun with this one!

I marinated the bird overnight in brine in the fridge. Absolutely, will make it again. It took about 6 h to cook on the smoker.

Delicious! We used this recipe for our family Thanksgiving. We smoked it at 200 for about 4 hours.

I found a recipe, similar to yours in our local newspaper, about 30 years ago and have been using it every thanksgiving. We all love how the meat is so moist. Thank you Tom for sharing your recipe.
