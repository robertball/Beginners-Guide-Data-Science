If you are a mushroom lover, you will probably really enjoy this. It has a great flavor. Careful though...I only added a tiny bit of salt but, thought it was still too salty. Probably enough salt from the butter and my chicken broth. Will DEFINITELY make again without the added salt.

This stuff was really good. I had to add an extra few spices to kick it up a little bit. The family enjoyed it and that's always a good thing!

Reminded me of a stroganoff. Used Portabello mushrooms and sliced up a pork tenderloin, flattening them slightly. Took a bit longer to reduce the sauce.

I made this twice and both times my chops were tough. I liked the sauce it cooked in though.
