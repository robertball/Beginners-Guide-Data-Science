WOW Brent!!! I was a little skeptical about this recipe because I wasn't sure how the beef would turn out...(I rarely fry anything), but I was in total shock when I tasted how good this was.  I know this is just as good as the crispy beef I've ordered at a local chinese restaurant around our area.  I didn't use fresh ginger...only powdered and instead of the chili paste, I used hot chili sauce.  I thickened up the sauce with a little cornstarch at the end since mine was a bit watery. But other than those few changes, I pretty much followed the directions.  I highly recommened this recipe!!

Fantastic starter recipe!  Porportions were right on!  I changed it up by:
adding flour and water to make a batter,
using MORE fresh ginger,
MORE garlic,
adding sesame oil,
and a FABULOUS FLAVOUR BLAST:  real orange juice, grated orange zest and orange marmalade--EVERYBODY at the potluck RAVED and ate it all!!!  My husband said Make sure you bring home any leftovers!!  I didn't use the chili paste, the sliced onion, or the red bell pepper; and I added shredded carrot for colour!  The recipe multiplied perfectly up to 6 lbs of beef!

Delicous and relatively easy to make - just a bit time consuming.  To those who don't have rice wine on hand - the internet said you could substitute it with either vermouth, white wine or sherry.  I ended up having to use the cheap cooking sherry and it worked out fine. (I always keep it in the closet for emergencies - like this one!)

Wow, this was really good. I have made this twice now and I used left over roast beef the first time and pork the second. I did make a few changes in the sauce as follows: I used 3 tabsps of light soy sauce and 1 tabsp dark soy sauce. I left out the rice vinegar and just used rice wine vinegar instead. Also 7 tabsps of sugar seemed too much and I only used about 2. This is a really good recipe and has become a favorite in our house

WOW!!!!!   This recipe was awesome! Everytime I try to make chinese it turns out horrible.  This was easy and turns out great.  My 18month old daughter loved this! I like this better than my local restaraunt!!

Instead of the red pepper i used a few whole dried chili peppers (They are easy to find in any grocery store).  I stirred in some shredded carrot right before I served the dish(That's the way the locals do it).  It makes it colorful and yummy.  I accidently added more honey (2 Tablespoons instead of 1.5) but it was still awesome.   Use fresh ginger and garlic.  Dont use the pre-processed junk in the jars.

The only other think I did was remove some of the garlic and onion chunks after I had cooked the sauce for about 10 minutes. This makes it a little less spicy (better for the kids)


YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was excellent.  I was a little skeptical about all the sugar and honey but it was delicious.  Made a few minor changes.  Used green onions, grated the ginger into the sauce, added hot pepper flakes to sauce, stir fried broccoli with the peppers and onions, and added cashews at end.  Made a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.  I would have liked more sauce and probably because I added broccoli it needed more sauce.  Will probably make 1 1/2 times more sauce next time.  Thank you for this recipe.  We live out boonies and have had no luck finding a decent Chinese restaurant.  My fiance said this was 10 times better than any thing we ate in a Chinese restaurant here.

This is fantastic! Even though I substituted chardonnay for the rice wine and chili sauce for the chili paste and frozen mixed sweet bell peppers for the fresh, it still tasted exactly the way I'd imagined it would!  Next time I'll use the fresh red bell pepper to get the crispness. My husband took the leftovers for lunch which he usually doesn't care to do. We'll be having this often - can't wait to make it for friends and family!  Thanks, Brent!

OK I'm giving this a 4 stars because it was good but after making this I know that with a few changes in the amounts of ingredients it will become a solid 4 or even 5 star recipe. For our tastes it was way too sweet even though I used less sugar, use 1/2 the amount. Next time I'll be using low sodium soy sauce. I used aprox 2 Tbsp. Sriracha instead of chili pase (all I had on hand, doubled the garlic, half I sauteed with the onion and half I added to the sauce. I also used extra ginger. Because my husband isn't crazy about red peppers we used broccoli and loved it although keep in mind the broccoli absorbs the sauce like a sponge so you may want to make extra.

This recipe gets two thumbs up! I was surprised at how similar it tasted to restaurant style crispy beef...It's quick and easy, even for amateur cooks like myself.

I think this is an excellent recipe, although I did alter the sugar content by halving the called for amount due to previous reviews.  This seemed to do the job for me.  I had no chili paste so used red pepper flakes.  Worked out very well.

Delicious recipe. Very close to restaurant style. I simmered a little longer so the sauce was thicker and used ALOT less oil for cooking the meat. I didn't have chili sauce on hand but ketchup with a dash of cayenne worked just as well.  I kept the spicyness down so the kids would enjoy it as well.  This recipe will become a standard in our family.

I don't usually rate my meals but I had to rate this one.  Absolutely amazing!  I followed the recipe almost exact however I didn't have (and couldn't find) rice wine so I used sherry instead.  I also practically doubled the sauce.  The meat soaks it up quite a bit.  I didn't need to fry the meat for more than a minute and a half and once I put it in the sauce it turned out perfectly tender.  I also sauteed the onion, peppers and garlic for about 3-4 minutes instead of 30 seconds.  The veggies were still a little crisp but not crunchy (which is how I like it).  My husband is very critical and has a very refined pallet and rated it an 11 and said it was better than restaurant style.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

I dont write reviews usually, but this was soooo good. The sauce is very versatile and can be used with other dishes too. For this recipe i used roasted garlic as i had some and finely minced onions. I saw on food network that crispy beef should be fried three times, i fried it twice. And in the end, i added some slivered green chilies.

Perfect when you omit the salt.  Could not find chili paste, so substituted Frank's Hot Sauce. Serve with stir-fried green beans and sliced red peppers. Thanks for sharing.

This had great flavor. I cooked it on the stove and put the beef back in the sauce in the end to absorb some of the flavor. I used ketchup and chili powder combo for the chile paste. My boyfriend watched me make this and was skeptical, but in the end loved the entire dish.

This dish is awesome! My first thought was that it was too much work and time to prepare, but then I tasted it, and it's worth the time!  A lot of the prep can be done beforehand so the next time I make it I will plan accordingly.  Definitely a great recipe with great flavor!

This is fabulous!  It's a lot of work, though, to prepare the meat.  I have a hard time keeping the steak slices from clumping together.  However, the family raves about the meat, so it's worth it!  I had to cut down on the sugar--I used 2 TBSP of white sugar, and substituted brown sugar for the honey.  I used sherry in place of the rice wine.  I've made this using julianned carrots and celery, and also with broccoli and green onions.  Delicious both ways!  Thank you!

As others have mentioned, I was a bit skeptical about this recipe as written, but figured what the heck, I'd give it a shot.  Glad I did.  Pretty darn good.  The only modifications I made were 1) added juice from two small oranges, 2) used 1 1/2 Tbsp powdered ginger root, 3) used siracha sauce instead of chili paste and white wine rather than rice wine (I was out of the original recipe ingredients so I had to punt *smile*) and 4) because the sauce was a bit thinner than I wanted, I boiled for about 2 -3 mins which thickened it to a consistency I was happy with.  I will definitely make this again.

I had to make a lot of modifications to this recipe b/c I don't keep a many of the ingredients on hand.  It was still excellent!  I used flour instead of cornstarch, white vinegar instead of rice vinegar, water instead of the rice whine and chili powder in place of the chile paste.  Also I omitted the ginger b/c I don't like ginger.  This really tasted just like something you'd get at a restaurant.  Delicious!

I thought this was amazing! A little on the sweet side though but i couldnt find the chile paste (4 diff stores, nobody knew what it was) so i just added some chili powder instead but apparently not enough. It was still amazing though and even my kids loved it!

This recipe is great! We just finished eating it for our first time. I hardly changed it all. We added peas and diced carrots instead of the red bell peppers like a restaurant from home. The sauce was excellent, and I thickened it up with about a TBSP of cornstarch right at the end as another reviewer said to do. 3 cloves of garlic and only 1 TBSP of Ginger. We will definitely be making dish again... Living in Italy we don't have a wide variety of asian food so it's all got to be homemade, and thanks to recipes like this I can do just that!

I have made this several times, it is a wonderful substitute for chinese take-out because you know what's going in it.  The corn starch is what gives the beef it's crispiness that lasts even after you put the sauce over it.  I agree with others, put the beef into the freezer for a short time before slicing.  It really does help in getting a thinner slice.  I usually double the sauce and serve with steamed brocolli, Jasmine rice, and an eggroll.  A great recipe that will be enjoyed time and time again.  By the way, leftovers are great!

For those who are having trouble with the meat clumping together, it's easier to slice and avoid it sticking together if you freeze the meat for 15-30 minutes before trying to slice it.  This helps the slicing process by making the meat more firm allowing for thinner slices.  The thinner slices also help with the crispiness of the cooked beef.  If it's clumping together when cooking, then be sure to allow the cornstarch coating to dry on the meat before trying to fry the meat.  Also, be sure to allow plenty of room in the pan with plenty of oil so the strips don't have to touch each other while they're cooking.  This should help you enjoy the yummy, spicy, and crispy beef without any clumps!

I liked the sauce more than the meal.  This was just "ok" but it is doubtful I will make it again.

What an amazing recipe!!! A must try for anyone who loves sweet and spicy. I marinated my steak slices in oil,soy sauce, garlic and a little chille paste first. I also used brown sugar instead of honey, which turned out great.

Tasty! I used 3 tbsp of sugar, and it was plenty sweet enough for us. I used orange and yellow bell peppers as that's what I had, and omitted the rice wine as I didn't have any. I would make this again. Thanks, Brent!

this was pretty good! I have to admit, i didn't really follow directions.... but this recipe gave me the main idea. I don't own a deep-fryer (helloooooo fatty!) so i saute'd the beef with a touch of olive oil. It also didn't come out very spicy at all, so i added jalapeno powder and ground mustard. It might not have been spicy because i didn't have chili paste, so i used tomato paste mixed with a gourmet chili powder. (guess i didn't use enough chili powder?) I also added extra garlic. I wanted enough sauce to pour over rice, so i doubled the sauce (except the sugar) and i was glad i did! 1.5 x the sauce probably would have been sufficient. I'm glad i didn't double the sugar, however, because it was sweet anyway.

Once you get all the veggies prepared, this recipe is dead easy and quick.  When I made it, I didn't deep fry the beef long enough so it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it. Because of the deep frying, I would not recommend this as a kid friendly recipe. It's very colorful as well as tasty, I'll definitely make this one again!

Finally, Chinese CRISPY beef! The one thing I would change is to add some five spice powder or other chinese seasoning to the cornstarch mix. Salt and pepper just does not cut it when it comes to flavoring the beef. Other than that, perfect recipe. Make sure to get the oil hot and the beef extra crispy, turn the strips over a few times. The crispier they are, the better.

Can't stop making!! Only thing we do differently is omit the sake and sauté in a well-oiled pan... it'd turn out better in a fryer, but unfortunately we don't have one!

I'd just recommend to take the sugar ingredient out. Theres already enough honey for some sweet taste.

Brent, I have to agree.... I also have never found a good recipe for Spicy Crispy Beel. THIS is WONDERFUL. I did find I added just a little more water, and because I like a kick I did add a 1/4 Tbs pepper flakes. Thank you for sharing. Will use this alot

The dish was tasty. Sweet tasting but flavorful. Too bad for so much sugar/honey. The addition I did was the 1.5 Tbp cornstarch to the sauce (I used broccoli too). I felt that there was too much liquid that isn't coating the content, so I added the cornstarch (before sauce got too hot & made sure it dissolved) into the  sauce. So much better!

This is a great tasting & very easy to make recipe. I would however suggest as always to read the other reviews for modifications. This recipe however didn't need much modification. The only thing I would do differently is to add crushed red peppers as even though it was delicious as is, it was not very spicy. Mild at best. Make sure your oil is very hot as the beef will not crisp as it should but the meat was very tender and the sauce was amazing. Next time I will try it with pineapples & green peppers. Also this amount was enough for 2 people not 4.

This was great! Only complaint was that 7TB is a whole lot of sugar. Next time, I'd make it with less. Also, this is an easy recipe to make gluten free! Just substitute tamari or gluten-free soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce. All other ingredients should be gluten free--but always check labels to make sure. Yum!

5 stars all the way. This was really good. I did not have chili paste so I used half a tablespoon of ketchup with some chili powder, I also did not have rice vinegar or wine so i just used regular vinegar.I didnt think it would turn out because of all the changes but it was fabulous. I even added some red pepper flakes for extra spice. I recommend cutting all the ingredients up first and preparing the sauce before as well so that all you have to do is prepare the meat and fry and then go from there with no stops it makes its easier. It was great.. no left overs at all!

Sooooo good!  I added carrots to mine and replaced green bell for the red, it was all I had.  Also didn't have the rice "wine" vinegar so just added more rice vinegar.  Turned out delicious!!  My husband, who doesn't care to much for chinese/asian food said, "I would eat chinese more if it tasted like this".  I was in heaven, due to loving compliments about my food!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is so great! I like it even better than Panda Express' Crispy Panda Beef. I used top round steak, since it is much cheaper than flank steak, and I used powdered ginger(1 and a half Tbsp.). Also, I didn't have rice wine, so I just used extra rice vinegar in place of it, and it was still great.  I didn't have fresh garlic; I forgot to add my 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, which is what I will do next time, but it was still very yummy even with no garlic. I hate spicy stuff, so I did not use any chile paste. This is a great Asian dish with a very tasty sauce. Try it!

This was really good. Since I have younger children who don't like things too spicy, I only added 1 tsp chile paste and 1 Tbs. fresh ginger.  This turned out great - all five kids ate it, and it still had a little kick to it.  I think my chile paste was extra strength.

I used brown sugar, which I think caramelizes better and red onion, which again gives that sweet taste.  Also, I used fresh thai chilis instead of chili paste.  I think it needs a bit more water and to cook just a touch longer so that you get a nice sauce.  With that extra bit of sauce, this dish goes great over stir fry noodles.

This was so yummy!  I doubled the recipe.  It was very sweet but I like sweet so I was good with it.  Hubby thought it was too sweet.  We served this on rice noodles.  Serving it on rice would be good as well.
Whole family enjoyed even the smaller children.

Very good.  I only added 2 1/2 tbs of sugar and I did not add any of the honey.  Other than that I kept everything the same.  This is really good.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!:)

This was fantastic!  We always order Crisy Beef from our favorite take-out place but no more!  My kids loved it!
Next time I'll make additional sauce on this side.

WONDERFUL!  TRY IT IF YOU LIKE CHINESE!!!!This is a family favorite!  Sometimes I'll ask the butcher to slice the meat for me, it saves one step since there is alot of ingredients:)

Very yummy! I added a bit more chile paste for an extra kick- but my boyfriend and I like extra spice. I also used sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil for sauteeing and threw in  sugar snap peas and julieened carrots for added nutrition. This one definitely goes in the recipe box.

This was very, very good. I don't have a deep fryer so I just fried the beef strips in a skillet with about an inch combo of olive oil/corn oil. I used two red peppers, one whole sweet onion, approx. 1/2 lb. fresh snow peas, and two small cans of pineapple chunks. Because of the vegie additions I doubled the sauce and it worked out very well, though next time I'll probably use one tbls less ginger. Seven tbls of sugar seemed like a lot for my taste, so I used 1 tbls regular sugar and 1 tbls splenda. This made it just the right sweetness for me. I added about 1 tbls of corn starch to my doubled batch of sauce to thicken it. I added the crisped beef to the sauce/vegie mix just before I served it and what a wonderful crunchy, sweet, gingery masterpiece. Thank you for the recipe.

The recipe was amazing... everyone loved it.  I found the recipe a bit on the sweet side.  I also tried it with chicken breast instead of the steak and cut down on the sugar.  Was absolutely exquisite.

This was very good, but not quite worth 5 stars. Also, this was a little labor intensive. I found that the oil could be significantly reduced. I like the Sesame Beef recipe off of here better when I am in the mood for Chinese. Not sure I would make again. Thanks for sharing.

It was too salty for our tastes.  I will decrease the soy sauce and try to time the cooking of the meat better. Outside of the sodium (and tough meat) the recipe was "ok"  But my 15 year old ate it all!

Good flavor, but a bit too sweet, and I had to add a cornstarch slurry to the sauce to keep it from being Crispy Beef Soup.

I changed a few things. Used Jasmine Rice instead of regular. Used mushroom soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce. Used Asian stir-fry oil and just fried in a pan (no deep fryer) and it crisped up nicely on the outside, tender inside). No fresh garlic so used garlic salt in the coating instead of regular salt. Added cayenne pepper in lieu of missing chili paste. A touch sweet but good.

After combining all ingredients at the end I covered and cooked for 10 more minutes. It was really spicy because of the chile paste I used so I recommend using a bit less. :)

This recipe is excellent!  My family said it tasted just like the restaurant.....I did change a couple of things, I added less sugar, a little more honey and substituted the rice vinegar and rice wine with Sushi seasoning (I didn't have the vinegar or wine)...but it turned out great!!!

This is an wonderful tasty treat, and with a modification 5 star recipe.
We double fried the beef 1 min. for the first fry time took it out of the oil let the meat cool and fried again until golden brown. I also did 2 batches of meat so it would not clump up. This was dish was so similar to our fav. resturant called City Lights in Dupont Circle/DC, I ate 2 servings at once! We will make this again for sure.

I love this recipe. I tweak it a little bit but basically follow the recipe. Its fairly easy to make and definitely holds up to Crispy beef in Chinese restaurants. 
I have been making this recipe for almost a year now and everyone who tries it loves it. At my work, we often have pot lucks and everytime all my co-workers demand that I make this recipe. They dont really give me any other option because they love it sooo much. This Crispy Beef recipe is definitely on my list of favorite meals, and I will continue to make it for others to enjoy!!

I made the sauce first for two reasons.
1. I wasn't sure if the meat would stay crispy while I made the sauce.It stayed crispy but not as crispy when it first comes out of the fryer.2. I wasn't sure I would like it and I didn't.I only put 4 Tbs of sugar in it and it was way to sweet.Instead of throwing the sauce out I played with it a little adding different ingredients until it was edible.
Loved the beef didn't care for the sauce

Man this was good... I didn't have a lot of the ingredients so I substituted many things, same amounts of each. I also marinated the steak strips in a mix of balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and white wine (in a ziplock bag).
No rice wine, used white wine
No rice vinegar, used white vinegar
No honey, used brown sugar
No chile paste, used 1/2 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes

Had to thicken the sauce with a bit of flour, but that's probably because I changed so many ingredients. Thanks for the awesome base recipe!

This was delicious. I didn't have any chili paste so I substituted chili powder which worked out well. Next time I'll cut back on the amount of sugar it calls for just because my family felt it was a bit too sweet. It was terrific nonetheless.

I partially froze the flank steak, then sliced into 1" x 1/4" strips, much easier to cut paper thin when partially frozen.

The I cut each 1" strip into four 1/4" x 1/4" strips like many chinese restaurants will serve it. 

Excellent recicpe, thanks!

This recipe was DELICIOUS.  The only thing I changed was that I omitted the rice wine since I didn't have any wine on hand, and this didn't make a difference.

oh wow, this is the best dish i've ever made and my whole family raved.  i scaled it up to 6 servings, pan-fried the beef, and added only 2 tbs. of brown sugar.  i don't have chili paste, so i used red pepper flakes.  i added about 2 tbs. of cornstarch to the sauce and it thickened nicely once it boiled.  this recipe is highly recommended!!!

I used maple syrup instead of honey and it was a bit off.  when I went half honey and half maple syrup, it really bumped the flavour up a notch.

The beef alone had a great taste even without the sauce.  With the sauce this meal was sensational!  My favorite recipe on allrecipes so far.  I added steamed broccoli into the mix in the last step and it turned out wonderfully.

I love this recipe, it's fast and easy and very versitile. You can you almost all kinds of meat. I had try this with Caribou, Moose, buffulo, elk and pork it's fabulous! I've also, added sesame seeds to have more of an asian look. It goes great with some thai chili sauce for that extra kick. yummmy!

This was excellent! However, I did double the sauce. Next time I will do as others suggest and reduce the sugar as it was a little too sweet. I also could not find chili paste so I used thai style chili sauce (made by Kikkoman). I used about three talbespoons - you may use less or more depending on how spicy you like it.

Fantastic and very close to Chinese restaurants!  I prefer using sirloin to flank steak because flank can become tough very easily.  We like more vegetables so I added 2 bell peppers, scallions, water chestnuts and brocolli.

It was very good and doesn't require an expensive cut of meat.  However, next time I will follow previous suggestions and leave out at least half of the sugar.  I'm a big fan of sweet & sour, but this was too sweet even for me.

Very good!  Following other reviewers' advice, I cut down the ginger to two tablespoons and decreased the sugar to five tablespoons.  When I cook this again (and I will, many times!), I'll probably reduce the sugar further.  Also, I replaced the red peppers with green onions, which turned out very flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Not as difficult to make as it might sound, although I suppose frying anything is a pain.  But it did taste very restaurant worthy and I loved it.

This was great! It really did taste like takeaway chinese - I will definitely make this again. Great for using up steak that hasn't got loads of flavour as the deep frying really brings out the flavour of the meat.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did cut down on the ginger and used a splash of white wine instead of the rice wine.  All in all, a very tasty dish that is reminiscent of crispy swechuan beef.  All you would need to add is julienned carrots and celery.

Yum!  This was great.  It was spicy but not too much.  I cut back on the ginger, but next time, I'll add the full amount.  It was good served over rice.  Takes a lot like what you may get at a restaurant.

This is fantastic! This recipe is perfect as is. I can't wait to make it again. I knew my kids wouldn't like the sauce, so instead of adding all the fried beef strips to the sauce I passed some of the fried beef strips off as steak nuggets. The kids loved them dunked in catsup.

Wonderful sauce which is now my favourite.  You don't have to deep fry the beef for the same results.  I stir fried the beef in my wok in batches with about a cup of oil.

This dish is awesome. I added some broccoli and baboo shoots to it though. Also, I didnt think it was too spicy. So I added 2 more tablespoons of the chili paste. This recipe is definetly a keeper and I will make it again.

Very, very good! Having made it several times, I now double the sauce ingredients so there is enough  for leftovers and for those who like sauce on their rice.  We do not eat a lot of spicy foods so I cut the chilli paste by about one-third it’s still very flavourful. Time consuming, but very worthwhile!

We aren't big on fried things, but I wanted to try this recipe.  I cut back on the sugar to half of what is written, and I'm sure glad I did, it would have been too sweet.  This was good, but not great.  I'm not sure I will bother to make it again?  I doubled the sauce portion due to the other reviews comments.  It was unnecessary and left me with too much sauce.

This was a really solid recipe.  It was super easy and turned out great.   The only change i made was cooking the peppers and onions a bit longer than the minute total.   Next time im going to add a bit more heat.

i forgot to mention I upset my girl friend's family with this recipe.  they are Chinese and own a Chinese take out restaurant.  My gf later confessed this was better than anything they make and I'm Caucasian.  Of course i surrendered the recipe to them.

I tried making this recipe once before and it did not turn out well.  This time, WOW!  I'm not sure if using an iron skillet vs. a non-stick one was what made the difference, but the flank steak turned out  great and the coating on the beef was soooo good.  The sauce was also great.  My julienned carrots turned out looking like a preschooler did them, but I will prevail.  I'll definitely be making this again.  I finally have a good recipe for flank steak. :)

This comes out the nearest to my Chinese takeaway favourite.
I added some ground Sichuan  pepper and orange zest to the cornstarch coating.Also added julienne carrot to the garlic and bell pepper.  Will be making again for sure. Do not be put off by the amount of sugar too..thanks for sharing this superb recipe !!

Awesome!!! Followed the recipe to a T. Only thing I did different was use green onions instead of regular,  cut them into matchstick along with carrots.  Timesaving tip, my local market sells beef already cut for stir fry.  Was AMAZING!

Oh my god too sweet!  I think I've have more savory syrup on pancakes.  I liked the fried beef and most everything else about it.  If I were to try again, I'd start by dropping half the honey and all of the sugar.

This was absolutely amazing!!! My husband asked me if I bought it because it tasted like the  one in the restaurants.  I used flour because I didn't have any cornstarch,  other than that I made no changes.

Grest recipe,  I use my dreep fryer for the meat, the trick is to put the meat in the fryer for 1 min. And then separate the meat, if it sticks together.  Then cook the meat for 2 more minutes.  Then cook the sauce until it thickens up, then add the beef.

Yum!  Like others, I only put in 3 Tbsp of the sugar, and it tasted great.  I like spice, so I upped the chili paste just a little.

Tastes as good as a dish from PF Chang's restaurant. I changed it up a bit. Sliced the beef sirloin super thin; turned out very tender. Added broccoli instead of peppers. Served it with siracha sauce for a bit of a kick. Delish!

Amazing. Don't thicken the sauce as the cornstarch on the beef will do it once you mix it all up over medium heat.

This recipe was a hit!. My mother in law is a chef and is ALWAYS critical of my recipes but tonight she was speechless and my husband is on his third rounds! Tonight I did not have beef do I used pork chops cut into pieces. I dipped the chops into whisked egg then mixed it into my batter which I altered by  combining the cornstarch with a little cornmeal and breadcrumbs. I also omitted the salt and did not have wine but  I'm sure it didn't matter because this was a hit! it was mother in law approved & ..she even asked for the recipe!

OMG!! BUSSSSSSSTIN!! I'm not even a big red meat fan but this right here??!!!! So good. I'm eating leftovers cold right now. Fab thing about it is it's so easy. I actually marinated it in Mojo overnight and then squeezed it dry with a gazillion paper towels. Followed directions to a T pretty much aside from the mojo marinade. No problems with the cornstarch not sticking. After coating the strips I laid them out and covered them with a kitchen towel until the coating was pasty like (which is what I do when I fry chicken). Everybody gobbled it up. In fact we were eating strips standing at the stove before they even made it to the table! lol. I will DEFinately be making this again =)

Tasty recipe, however I do wish my beef had stayed a little crispy.  I used less sugar (as others recommend and much less oil.

Really good! For anyone like me who didn't want to make a trip to the grocery store, I skipped the rice vinegar and rice wine, just used a little splash of regular white vinegar and the honey to taste.  Added some red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Didn't use the onions, just personal preference, instead used matchstick carrots and red pepper.  My husband said it was restaurant quality!

Amazing!  We've been ordering this for years from the local Chinese place.  Now I can make it myself! I changed out the chili sauce for chili garlic sauce which was super tasty and not spicy.  Enjoy! :)

Very good recipe!!  Great flavor.  Tried it as originally stated above, but found I wanted to adjust a thing or two... The sauce, if you like it hot, use the chili paste as directed.  However, I have two little girls, and they are not quite there yet, so I halved it.  Also, I like the sauce a little thicker, so I whisked up some corn starch (2 to 3 tablespoons) and added it to the sauce... that really gave the sauce some "stick".  Last thing... slice the meat "thin", 1/8" or less and you will have a good crunchy meat... go 1/4" and of course you will give it a little more "chew".  Definitely worth a try if you like Chinese style food.

This was the second time I have made this it is very good. This time I used round steak and added baby bella mushrooms. I think you can do a lot with this recipe.

I would add a photo but I ate it all! This recipe is awesome! Here is a way to speed things up while enjoying a huge twist on your leftover turkey! Take small 3/4 inch pieces of cooked leftover turkey dredge them in the cornstarch mix, deep fry as the recipe suggests, I used my wok. Take the turkey out, dump the oil and then toss the deep fried pieces into the wok with the soy sauce etc and stir until sticky and crispy! Too fast and good to believe! Give it a try!

I may never order ginger beef again.  This was awesome and so easy. The only thing I changed was the 1/2 tsp rice wine, I didn't have any so I omitted it.  I don't know if it changed the flavor or not but it's a great recipe Brent. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent. It tasted just like what I was looking for. I did however hold off on a quarter of the soy, since in my experience recipes often call for too much of it, overbearing the other flavours. Three tpsp was more than enough (and I think even two would do).

I've never had crispy beef, nor did my wife, so we were pretty open minded to this. We deep fried it in Canola oil over the stove keeping a careful eye on making sure we didn't burn the house down. Because I didn't have a deep fry thermometer, we had to rely on the trusty cube of white bread method of maintaining the temp. For the most part this worked, however I did end up overcooking some of the beef, completely my fault. That being said, even though some beef was jerky tough because of my on the fly cooking, it was great! Crispy and beef just didn't click in my head, but it definitely worked here. I may ask around with my neighbors and see if they have a deep fryer so I can whip this up again properly. If you go with a stove top method, ensure you have a fire extinguisher and know how to use it so you don't turn dinner into a tragedy.

I have made this over 10 times now.  It is my absolute favorite crispy beef recipe.  My fiancee says this is better than any crispy beef we get at restaurants.  I make mine with broccoli.
The best!!!

My first time having deep fried steak.. Simply mouth watering when it is soaked in the liquid mixture. The aroma makes you take deep breaths. We are making it again tonight! Def. a recipe to make when having a couple friends or family over. They will be impressed.

This is wonderful!  It is also pretty easy.  My husband loved it, he had me make it twice this week.  I served it over Jasmine rice.  Added some eggrolls and we had a meal that was alot better than chinese take-out.

I have to say I was a sceptic as I'd never deep fried beef strips before but man oh man was this good.  I'm not a huge fan of bell pepper so I used match stick carrots instead.  Also I only had rice vinegar on hand so I used that for both the wine and vinegar.  I served this with steamed rice, cucumber sunomono and kimchi.  Kids loved it...

We really didn't like this. Followed the recipe exactly but felt that the beef ended up with sort of a gross texture - not crispy enough, and after it sat for a while, my husband remarked that it was just like eating old chinese leftovers. Yuck! We ended up throwing out the batch.  It's possible I didn't let it crisp up too long in the deep fryer. Also, the sauce didn't seem all that special, would have liked better seasonings. I added cayenne for more spice but it still wasn't zippy enough...

Great tasting.  Instead of sugar (my mother dislikes sweet tasting meat) I added sesame oil, and garnished with roasted sesame seeds, red pepper flakes and green onions.  It was spicy, but not sweet.  I've also tried it with added orange juice and zest instead of water. You end up with a nice spicy orange ginger beef.  Very versatile recipe, but good made just as is as well.

This was excellent. My sauce was a little thin but I boiled it and that helped to thicken it a bit. I added more garlic than was called for and used chili garlic sauce instead of chili paste. I also used fresh minced ginger root. I added carrots, sugar snap peas, edamame and pineapple.

This was an excellent recipe.  My husband is very picky and he has already asked me to make it again.  I did follow the advice of some of the other people and cut back on the sugar and added a little more chili paste.  I also added tons of veggies so I doubled the sauce.  Served over white rice this is an excellent dish.  Thanks Brent

Delicious, tastes like it is straight from a chinese restaurant.  My husband found it a little heavy on the ginger, so I would cut down to 2 Tbsp next time.

Sounded like it had a lot of potential but turned out really disappointing.  The sauce was too sweet and the beef never turned crispy.

This was very tasty. Added some stir fry veggies to the beef and served with a side of rice. A bit time consuming, but very good in the end.

You don't get better than this at a restaurant.  My family raved and ate a double batch.

This recipe was exquisite! I wanted to try and keep it light so I didn't coat the beef with cornstarch - I lightly fried them in sesame oil instead and just added a dash of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. It was a hit! I can't wait to plan my next dinner party so that I can show off with this recipe. Thanks a million for submitting it!

This was the first recipie I used from this site and I loved it. I had never fried beef with cornstarch before, it made it a lot lighter than I thought it would be.

I used to frequent a Szechuan Restaurant that served this awesome dish in Toronto before I moved.  Ever since then I was unable to find even a remote closeness to it anywhere else.  Now I have found an exact replica and I can make it right here at home.  Fantastic would'nt change a thing, except the time to prep and cook is not as long as is stated.
