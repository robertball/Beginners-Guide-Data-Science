I could not get enough of this soup!! My husband orders this all the time when we go to Olive Garden so when I saw this recipe I had to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly. I finely grated the carrots so that during cooking they dissolved; which was what I wanted (my husband does not eat cooked carrots).  I also used homemade gnocchi & fresh spinach because that was all I had. My soup was a little thick so next time I think I will use more milk and less half n half. Each bowl was topped with grated parmigiana. A must try!! Both kids and hubby devoured it.

Seeing that Gnocchi soup is my ultimate choice even though I desperately try to convince myself to try other soups from Olive Garden, I have to say this recipie is by farr better than the  Olive Garden. The only thing I can think of is just making sure the gnocchi is boiled till tender before it's added to the soup, seeing that this recepie is a quick one. In love!

Really good -- DON'T FORGET TO TOP WITH GRATED PARMESAN before eating, if you like it. 
Kids and hubby ate a lot, including leftovers.
We are OG goers, I love this soup and don't recall celery or other distinctive spicing other than nutmeg in the gnocchi. So, I did not use rosemary, or celery. I also used all 2% milk for the two listed dairy ingredients and did need a bit of cornstarch at the end. Roux is better but we try to go g/f when it's easy. This is a great recipe. 
Update: leftover rotisserie chicken is a yummy and easy sub.

When I saw the high rating on this soup, I was really excited to try it since Olive Garden chicken gnocchi soup is one of my favorites.  I made this recipe almost exactly as written (I did use butter instead of margarine cause that's all I had, but other than that no changes).  While overall it did have a good flavor, both my husband and I felt that the butter and seasonings overpowered the soup.  I'm not sure if it was the nutmeg or the Rosemary but it was too strong.  And the whole stick of butter just gave it a greasy heavy feeling.  I'm disappointed as I was really expecting this to be a new favorite.  Will keep searching for something a bit closer to Olive Garden.

I made this recipe -almost verbatim but I am embarrassed to admit I only had canned chicken on hand (this NEVER happens so I was appalled at first). It is amazing and actually ends up pretty thick but we love it!!!  what an awesome combination of foods, flavors and consistencies!  This is a new go-to recipe for those cold nights or snow days!!!

Easy recipe to follow. I added the whole can of chicken broth so I added some corn starch at the end to thicken it up.  I also added the celery leaves.  All  3 kids ate it, which is a big deal in this house...

This turned out really good!

I had to cook my chicken and boil my gnocchi (I bought them frozen) before what the actual recipe calls for. 

Other than that the recipe turned out great.

This was a delicious soup, a little different than the kinds of chicken soup I'm used to - very rich and thick, it really sticks to your ribs.  I considered skipping the nutmeg because it didn't seem like it would go with the rest of the ingredients, but it was just the right amount and added a touch of excellent and unusual flavor. 

I will absolutely make this soup again, I'm used to soups that take all day to cook, this came together quickly and was easy to prepare.  I love that it has a lot of vegetables, you could probably sneak a full serving of veggies past some pretty picky eaters with this soup.  I might add some potatoes next time.

I made this with a few substations (only because I was working with what I had on hand), but I feel the end result was the same. This is a delicious soup, it will definitely go in the recipe box. Only tried and true recipes go in my box. Hubs and I both loved it. A keeper for sure.

YES!  This recipe is terrific. It's inexpensive, and luckily I already had most of the ingredients on hand.  It's simple, which I love as well.  Best of all, it's quick.  I was able to put it together and serve it about a half hour later.  I used a shredded rotisserie chicken which expedited the process as well.  Love this!  I will definitely be making it again.

A favorite when it gets cold out. I boil my gnocchi before adding to the soup. Otherwise follow the recipe. Add some fresh shredded parmesan before serving. Leftovers reheat well.

I don't like this soup at Olive Garden, but the rest of my family loves it, which is why I made it. This soup, however, is amazing!! Even I love it. I made it exactly as written except no onions because my kids hate them. Thanks for this recipe. Will absolutely make again soon!!

I followed the recipe exactly and none of us liked it.  We all love the soup at Olive Garden.  Since that is the case, I’d really like to try it again.  I don’t think the recipe is bad, I blame the packaged gnocchi I bought.  It just had that “processed” taste.  I’ve looked up how to make potato gnocchi but I’m scared it will dissolve in the soup! I’d like to make this again and give it the 5 stars I’m sure it deserves!

Really liked this! Like other reviews mentioned. I found it quite thick, which someone people might like but for my preference, I will leave out the half and half next time. I also think it would be easy to leave out most of the butter. Would double the veggies next time.

OMG delicious! Followed this recipe to the T and it was perfect and very easy to make. Browned the chicken in my stock pot first and then transferred to a dish. Made the soup as directed and added the chicken back in at the end. Super easy one pot meal! Both my picky husband and 2 year old devoured this. Definitely a new favorite in our house!

This was absolutely fantastic. I made Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits with it. The only thing I think I might try is adding three strips of crumbled bacon. It’s amazing the way it is tho.

I added shredded parmesan cheese to the recipe at the end and stirred it in. Gave it a much fuller flavor than adding it after the fact.

I made this as written with the exception of making it hardier, with penny size carrots and the addition of portobello mushrooms. I also made homemade gnocchi. (I just didn’t have any in the pantry) I gave this recipe 5 stars because the taste is amazing. The nutmeg and rosemary really make this soup stand out among the other similar recipes.

This recipe is delicious!   I didn't have rosemary so I used oregano.   I will definitely be making this soup again soon and this time I will serve with garlic breadsticks!

I love this soup, and to me it's even better than the original! When in a hurry, I make it with the precooked canned chicken and honestly there isn't much of a difference.

Just made it. Easy and very good. Increased all the vegetables and reduced nutmeg. Added a smoked sea salt to add depth. 
Will make again

I made this for a work potluck, and it was a huge hit- there was not a drop left at the end of it! Things I did differently: I used butter instead of margarine, and since I was making it for a large group I doubled everything except the butter and the gnocchi, since I only had one package. I cut each gnocchi in half so that there were more pieces. I did not add the nutmeg and rosemary per previous reviews that indicated that the flavors were too strong. I thought that with just the onion, garlic, salt and pepper as seasoning it was perfect. For the chicken, I roasted a split breast (with bone and skin) and shredded it finely, and it was the perfect amount of chicken. Although I did not double the butter, it was still WAY too much- I had to use paper towels to blot up the huge pools of it that separated and sat on top of the soup. Next time I would definitely find a better way to thicken the soup. I did dice up a russet potato and cooked until tender, then mashed up half and stirred into the soup, and that seemed to work well. I left the rest of the potato intact and added to the soup and it added another element of texture. It is a rather heavy soup with the butter and the half and half, so I might just use milk next time and thicken with the potato as described above, plus some corn starch to lighten it up. Really delicious soup!

I really loved the recipe! The nutmeg is must in my opinion. Better than Olive Garden. I would recommend homemade gnocchi the store stuff wasn’t very good. It’s also easy to make.

This is a keeper. I made this the other night and it tasted great. I omitted the onions and cut back on the spinach but otherwise, I followed the recipe as it is written. The soup does not need as much celery, carrots or spinach as it calls for. Sometimes you're better off keeping it simple. I'll make this again but cut back on some of the ingredients. I did find the soup to be a little thick and had to continually stir it, I'll see what I can do about that next time.

I love this soup, but I am a soup nazi. I hate when people change up the recipes & then review. I say that because that's what I just did. I used chicken bone broth instead of regular because it has less sodium & it's better for you. I try to buy ingredients for my soup recipes with low sodium because it is a lot easier to add salt then to take it away. I almost doubled the amount of chicken & added way more spinach than called for. And I used unsalted butter instead of margarine (yuck!).  I read someone else's review that said the seasonings were overpowering. Maybe they used fresh Rosemary instead of dried? That would do it. You have to adjust your amounts when using fresh seasonings compared to dried. I will make this again but next time I will double the recipe because I love to freeze the soup for later! There wasn't enough left over this time.

I'll admit: I've never had the Olive Garden original for comparison... but this recipe is a winner for flavor and ease of preparation.  I cut back the butter as suggested by others, but just to 1/3 cup, because that's how much flour is called for, and we're making a roux here. There is enough starch shed by the gnocchi to be able to increase the volume of chicken stock by another cup without sacrificing the final soup's texture.
Be sure to separate your gnocchi before adding, and to stir frequently after adding as they will stick to the bottom of the pan.
I used chicken boullion powder in place of salt, it has an affinity for creamy soups. 
Freshly ground whole nutmeg is wonderful in creams and on greens. Don't skip this ingredient, though 1/4 teaspoon might be a bit much.

I used butter instead of margarine and corn starch instead of wheat flour. I also didn't use nutmeg so I can't commit on how this soup would taste if I had. This is a delicious heart warming soup and I highly recommend it if you like the idea of a mix between cream of chicken soup and chicken dumplings.

I used this as a base recipe to make a delicious chicken soup. I used half the butter and added a little olive oil and threw in some fresh rosemary when I sauted the veggies. Also used potatoes instead of gnocci because I didn't have any. When I added the liquid I reserved the milk and cream until the end because I didn't want it to separate. Very good.

This was so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't have half and half so I just doubled the milk - I even used skim! - and it was still creamy and tasty. Just added a little parmesan cheese when we served it:). I've tried other Olive Garden gnocchi soup copycat recipes and been disappointed but this was wonderful! Thanks!

Loved this soup. I made it as directed but I did bump up the amount of carrots, onions and celery only because I had cut up too many veggies. Chop them finely though, as directed. I missed grating the carrots and chopped them finely but it would be faster if I would have grated so next time I'll grate the carrots. The rosemary gave this soup a delicious taste and I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This was amazing! I like using unsweetened coconut milk in place of the half-n-half. Also avoid broths because of salt, so just added the seasoning often found in broth, such as garlic and onion powders and turmeric. I will definitely be making this again!!!

This was very good.  My son who loves this soup at Olive Garden said it was close but not right on.  I really liked this as well and will make it again.  I did add more garlic and spices as that is what I like.  I used mini gnocchi too.

Amazing soup!  I used thyme instead of rosemary, cause my kids hate rosemary.   And I added the milk and cream at the very end so it wouldn't curdle.  Loved by all on a now day.  This is a keeper.

Doubled it & made this exactly as the recipe stated. Chopped 4 sautéed chicken breasts up with chopper as well as all other ingredients due to my son's recent dental work it needed to be small. This recipe is AWESOME!!! Will definitely make it again exactly as this time. I have never cared for Olive Garden's soup and was only making it for my family; however, I loved this soup!!! Outstanding recipe!!

This turned out fantastic. I didn't have nutmeg or rosemary so I used cinnamon and oregano. I also sautéed all the seasonings in with the vegetables and it helped bring out the flavor. Then I added the flour and let it mix in the veggie mixture and slowly added in the broth and other ingredients. The kind face look be OG and really enjoyed this.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out amazing. I may scale back the gnocchi and add a bit more chicken next time, but that's a personal preference. Make it as is, you won't be disappointed if you like Olive Garden's version.

I made this four stars because it was delicious, but I made a couple small changes. I listened to two different users. Rachel H said the butter overpowered the soup, so I reduced it by 25%. It still tasted pretty buttery, but not overpowering. Next time I'm going to use 1/4 cup of butter instead and I think it will be the final improvement I need. Also, didn't bother with the rosemary since I don't like rosemary and agree with another poster who said they didn't remember that flavor from the Olive Garden version.

So in short, less butter, skip rosemary, great soup.

Made it exactly as written.  We were not disappointed and you won't be either.  With the left-overs I added more spinach - 'cause I like it - but it was good either way.  I will make it again and I will follow the original recipe again.  Good job !!

This was a great recipe for chicken gnocchi.  I always get it at Olive Garden and wanted to try and make it at home.  Didn't make any changes to recipe and it turned out great.  My husband never had it before and said it was a keeper.

Very easy ... though I was apprehensive about all the chicken broth! I was talking and let it boil a little longer, and then when the gnocci was in, I let it simmer probably 20 minutes ... came out beautifully! I put it in containers to take to work ... and it tasted so good! Filling and warm/hearty. I could just detect the nutmeg ... debating on using that again but it adds an interesting note. So worth a try!!!

Like others, I really like Olive Garden's version so I was looking for something that would be similar. Followed the recipe as written, but i did have to use frozen gnocchi. It was delicious and deserves 5 stars! One recommendation that i would make, if you are using frozen gnocchi, would be to decrease the amount of flour, or to increase the chicken broth bc it was THICK. Still delicious and i will absolutely add this to my repertoire. Thanks for the great recipe. Nicole

I substituted thyme for the rosemary since I didn't have any, but this still turned out amazing! I used the Quick Gnocchi recipe and made my own fresh. Even my picky eater daughter enjoyed it!

This was my first ever attempt at home made soup. I selected it because of its popularity on allrecipes and because my family loves gnocchi. It has been a huge hit. I took the advice of some others and used butter - but cut it back by 25%. I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of half and half. I made my own stock and added bullion to it for flavor. In doing so, the soup was a tad too salty. That was my inexperience coming out. I will skip the salt or bullion next time. I definitely will make this soup again and again.

A keeper! Made it exactly as recipe except for half and half. I didn't have any of that so I used heavy whipping cream. My three kids and husband loved it. It's very heavy so next time I'll use less butter and just ease up on the seasoning. But as written the kiddos and hubs gave it two thumbs up!

I followed the recipe as written, it turned out amazing! I shared it with family and friends and they were very impressed with the results. Now, I need to remember where I purchased the gnocchi, lol. I had a package here for a few months and then I found this recipe that looked just like what I was looking for. I will be putting this on my list of favorite soups, for sure.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! With some grated parmesan on top it did just the trick in satisfying our craving of OG's soup. I can't wait to make it again. 

Next time I will make my own gnocchis to go with it.

This soup is a favorite in my house. I subsitute the chicken breasts for chicken thighs. Thighs just have more flavor.

Last time I made it - I ommited the chicken all together and added frozen shrimp and fresh crab meat. It was a great twist!

Easy and delicious! My family loved this. I didn't add spinach (didn't have it on hand) and decided not to add rosemary. I did add bacon bits and it came out really tasty and really filling. I will be making it again :)

I've made this twice and its delicious. First time, I made my on gnocchi and second time I used rice with it.  I did not put chicken in it the second time, but used homemade turkey broth and chicken broth.  I added 1 bay leaf and added cauliflower and roasted red pepper and frozen peas as well. (would've added broccoli, but didn't have any)   Also, no spinach. This soup is delicious!

Perfect!  This is awesome!  I missed getting nutmeg at the store, but other than that the recipe was tried as written.  A great heat n'serve recipe.  I will double the recipe next time, since this only made about 6 two cup serving.

this was my dinner choice tonight, even though my daughter (24 yrs old) does not eat soup. I did omit the celery as I didn't have it on hand, and instead if heavy cream and milk I used a block of cream cheese. Everyone loved it..Yes even the non soup eating daughter. in my humble opinion, was just as good as OG if not better.

My goodness, was this good!  It tasted just a tad different than the OG, but looked just like it, and was still delicious.  It was fairly easy also.  I think next time, I will increase to 1 cup of half and half, and use garlic salt instead off regular salt.  This will be a new go-to soup recipe in our house.

I made this today and it was really good after a few tweaks. I used heavy cream in place of the milk, added about a quarter cup of grated Parmesan and adjusted the seasonings to taste.  Doesn't taste just like Olive Garden's but it was really good after the few adjustments that were made.

Used thyme instead of Rosemary and added crushed red pepper flakes to the veggies as they were sautéing. This was excellent. Family loved it. Never been to Olive Garden, never will.

I made this soup because my son loves the olive garden version and asked me to make it at home. My 8 year son loves this soup so much that he keeps asking me to make it and so I am even making it in the summer. My husband and I enjoy it too.

This was my first time with Gnocchi and it wasn't bad.  When I go to OG, I have to admit I eat a different soup, so I really can't compare.  If you like Gnocchi, I would say it is wonderful because a great flavor was there.  I myself think Gnocchi is a little more doughy then what I prefer, so next time I might cut them in half.  I did have one small sub, just that I used half-n-half for the milk also.  I did listen to some comments about boiling the Gnocchi before hand, but I have to admit, I don't think it was necessary.  I had some leftover rotisserie chicken so that saved a step for me and it worked well.

This was fabulous. It keeps for several days so leftovers are a plus. I used DaVinci gnocchi that I found in the pasta section instead of frozen gnocchi and it was delicious.

Pretty rich but very, very good.  I subbed thyme for rosemary (personal preference), omitted the salt and used half butter and half olive oil; otherwise made as directed.  DD, who was visiting for the day, said she was glad she stuck around for dinner--high praise indeed.  We all agreed it would be just as good without the gnocchi, in fact DH would prefer it that way.  Served with the Crazy Bread on this site and Caesar salad. UPDATE...served to a group of friends yesterday for lunch without the gnocchi and it was great.  One friend asked if it was an Olive Garden copycat and if so, it was much better.

I've only been to Olive Garden once & was not a fan but this soup is delicious! I had some premade Gnocchi I wanted to use. Trying to cut back on the fat I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil & non fat milk. It worked just fine. My husband does not like spinach in soup, so I added some chopped cooked zucchini. I forgot the nutmeg but the soup was wonderful without it. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I sought out a dupe recipe for the Olive Garden soup, and picked this as the one I'd try. This was delicious! I have to say that I made it without the onion(as I never cook with onions), and I slightly increased all quantities (though I reduced the butter to 4 Tbsp.), because I wanted to use the meat from a whole rotisserie chicken I'd purchased. But this was really delicious. I'm going to try it with less butter next time, as I tend not to cook with as much fat. I'm thinking the recipe will still be good with a bit of a reduction in the butter. All in all, this was something great that I'll surely make again!
