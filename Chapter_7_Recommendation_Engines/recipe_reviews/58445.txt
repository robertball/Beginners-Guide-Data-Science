Excellent.  A big hit at our brunch today.  My family is phobic about blue cheese, so I used a thick Marie's cheesy dressing.  Can't wait to try it with blue cheese.

Just made this recipe this morning for a birthday brunch today.  It turned out great.  I substituted chunky Feta Salad dressing for the Blue Cheese Dressing.  I made a very large casserole and there was VERY LITTLE left over.  I even gave away my recipe printed out.

I substituted chopped spinach for the broccoli as that's what I happened to have in the house, used onion powder instead of the thyme & savory, sprayed the pan with Pam instead of using butter, & used a couple Tbsp. of Benecol instead of the melted butter. You can use low fat cheese & dressing to cut down on the calories, if you want as well.  I'd suggest layering 1/2 the cheese over 1/2 the veggies & spreading the other half of the veggies on top of the 2nd layer of egg mixture, before topping the dish with 1/2 of the remaining cheese (layering like a lasagna).  I imagine that you could break the bread into smaller pieces & mix everything together as well saving some cheese for the topping.  This was OK but I guess I like a quiche better than a strata, as this just seemed to have ALOT of bread.

I really liked this, I used French bread and it poofed up really nice. I would not make it again for people I don't know well as I find that a good chunk of the population is weird about blue cheese and overall the other strata I made with more traditional ingredients went over better.

Relatively easy to make, but I was expecting much more blue cheese flavor. It turned out to be relatively bland. If I made it again, I would add a lot more blue cheese dressing, and perhaps some crumbled blue cheese too.

This was delicious, but I think the 2nd layer of bread is too much. After pouring the egg mixture over the bottom layer, I looked at it and decided to do without the 2nd bread layer and I am very glad that I did. I can't imagine it with DOUBLE the amount of bread...I think it would be much more bland. I did also sprinkle some blue cheese on top with the cheddar.

As is, I rate this three stars,, but it does have potential..I added crumbled blue cheese to it,.. It needs more egg and more seasoning.. and the blue cheese taste wasn't even very strong with my addition of blue cheese crumbles. Update - I had leftovers of this a day later and I must say it tasted much better.the need to more eggs was less evident and the seasonigns had melded.. so I am upping the rating to 4 from 3

Not bad! No green veggies in the house so I used leftover bacon, mushrooms, and onions, from the day before. The blue cheese gave it such a tasty flavor that I don't think it makes a huge difference what veggies are added in. I will definitely try this again (with green veggies next time). Thanks for sharing.

Liked the concept but made a lot of substitutions. Used mushrooms and Spinach (precooked to get some water out ). Used chicken sausages pan cooked and cut. Used a few more eggs.

I made this in muffin tins and took out the bacon and substituted redpepper.  Instead of milk I used almond milk and it turned out incredible!
