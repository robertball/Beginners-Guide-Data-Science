This was way too sweet and the vinegar was too much.  I added tomato paste, basil, oregano and beef broth to try to thicken the sauce and cut the vinegar and sugar.  I will not make this again.

Really good flavor, but I found it too sweet.  I would cut the sugar in half next time.
Also, the sauce is a bit too watery for lasagne, so I added some tomato paste to thicken
it up.

it was a little sweet as is, so i made the following changes: i cut the sugar in half, and added 1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon instead of placing a stick in the sauce... i also omitted the cloves, but added 1/8 tsp ground peppercorns. i also added sliced ring bolgna, and stewed it with the sauce. it absorbed the flavor nicely.

I think half the sugar is more than enough. Eleven tomatoes gave me almost 5 pounds of tomatoes. They were sweet enough naturally, so I put in 2 Tbsp of sugar and that was fine to compensate for acidity. Pretty good otherwise. Thank you for your recipe.

The sauce was tasteless and unless you and your family love spicy I do not recommend putting that much crushed pepper in.

A little on the sweet side, I will definetely cut the sugar, maybe even just add a pinch the next time i make this.
