I omitted the anise seed because I didn't have it and I added four cloves of fresh minced garlic to the butter before brushing it on the thick hamburger rolls, which we used instead of baguettes. I made six thick burgers instead of twelve thin. These are incredible. We really loved them. We dressed these simply with homemade special sauce, sliced cheddar cheese, sliced tomato, sliced onion and fresh bibb lettuce. Out of six, there is ONE left. My husband ate two in one sitting. I'll make these again for sure.

Successful meal. Three of us thought they were really tasty but my daughter thought there was too much flavor of Italian sausage - probably from the 2 teaspoons of fennel seeds. I actually used two pounds of lean ground beef and one pound of bulk sausage and used the full recipe amount of seasonings. It was too hot to grill outside so I grilled them on my stovetop pan and then finished in the oven. After putting the cooked meat patties on sub rolls, I added sauteed red peppers and onions and provolone cheese, wrapped in foil and heated for 15 minutes. My daughter added pesto to hers after it came out of the oven. I don't think serving them on the bun is necessary. They would be good covered in grilled veggies and shredded cheese and heated in the oven until the cheese melted.

Instead of sandwiches, I used this hamburger as part of a "naked burger" (no bun) meal idea to serve 4 (changed the serving size). Made a few tweaks w/ingredients I had on hand: used ground turkey instead of ground beef, hot Italian sausage, 3/4 of an onion, 4 garlic cloves and increased the Italian seasoning. These were a hit with my husband, he's already requested I make them again! Very easy to prepare and add/sub out ingredients you have in your fridge.

Amazing burgers! Hubby loved them for Father's Day. I halved the recipe....used an 85%/15% ground beef....used a hot Italian ground sausage.....love the fennel flavor....did omit the olive oil in the mix....didnt see a need for it....and served on nice rolls topped with provolone cheese....Just the right amount of spice and plenty of flavor and juiciness! Thanks!

Great burgers. This is almost the way I make my Italian meatballs with homemade Italian Tomato sauce. Delicious.

The problem with mixing ground beef with pork sausage is you have to cook the meat completely through so the grd.beef is quite over cooked although wonderful as meat loaf!!

I thought these came out great.  Lots of flavor and something nice to make on occasion.  I didn't use the anise seed because I didn't have them on hand, but these still turned out delicious.

I have been making Grilled Italian Hamburgers for years, the only difference is I have been using the hot Italian Sausage. I also use 1/4 cup of Italian creamy salad dressing, makes the burgers nice and moist. I tried this recipe and I like it also.

These were absolutely delicious. I made a few for last night and a few more for leftovers, and I can't wait to eat them again. Overall, this recipe is definitely worth a try. This is one burger recipe that I would absolutely make again and again.

Really delicious!   For a special topping, slice yellow, red, and green peppers and saute with onions.
You can do this in a cast iron skillet right on the grill.
You'll get big "Wows!"  before the "Yums''!
Also, if anise isn't your thing, use 1 t of fennel seeds
instead.

my intention for this was to be made into meatball subs with pasta sauce and cheese on top.. instead i've made it a couple of times for my lunch and it does taste good, but it's a little on the salty side.. my ratio of ground turkey to regular pork sausage was more like 1:1.. i used onion powder for the fresh.. left out the olive oil.. and ground up a whole star anise because i read on the cook's thesaurus that it equals about 1/2 tsp (i was only making 3 servings).. i could say that this did taste like sausage.. but given the fact that i used half sausage in this, it wouldn't be fair.. i also wonder if that's why it seems salty to me.. either way it's good just as a patty dipping it in tomato sauce or ketchup.. ty for the recipe

The sausage adds a different taste to burger.  Wasn't sure I liked the taste of the sausage in it at first, but by the time I finished the burger, I was thinking about when I'd make one again.  The only thing I changed was to make a thick round patty.

I made these for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved them!  I doubled the recipe since we were expecting a large crowed and it made 28 burgers.  I froze them and we cooked them as needed.  They really are delicious.  I omitted the anise seed and used regular hamburger rolls and omitted the melted butter.  We did grill some with provolone cheese and they were delish!!

This sounds like an awesome meal just as it is. However, in my constant effort to lower hubbys cholesterol level I changed this just a bit. Made it with ground turkey and turkey italian sausage, instead of beef and pork. We also left the butter off the baguettes. Other then that we followed the recipe to the letter. It was OUTSTANDING! My meat lover hubby was very impressed with the turkey version and that is hard to do.

Just made them. I used ground beef, pork and Italian sausage, used a marinara spice from Epicure. No anise seed and no olive oil.  I made a mayo, pizza sauce, marinara spice spread to put on bun or dip in. My family loved them!! Will definitely make again!
