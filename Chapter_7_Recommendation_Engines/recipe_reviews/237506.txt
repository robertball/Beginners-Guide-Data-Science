AWESOME! My only change was to add little red potatoes to the skewers. I tossed them in olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt. The onions were done according to the recipe. The cooking time was the same for both. I had a hard time finding the cipollini onions but that is because I was looking for them in a mesh bag. I found them in the refrigerated section of the produce department in a little plastic container already peeled. I love these little guys and now I'm searching for cipollini to plant in my garden. Thank you FrackFamily5 for sharing this AWESOME recipe!

Well I had to improvise since it s 15 degrees outside and I m not grilling. I had potatoes in the oven in a Pyrex 9x13 baking dish. I placed the skewers over the dish and roasted for 20 minutes on 400. Tasted great!
