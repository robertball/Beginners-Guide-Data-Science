We loved this!!  Mr. LTH commented multiple times what a great meal this was.  I used my meatballs (Meatball Nirvana) and a combination of linguini & fettucini as vehicles for this sauce.  I'm lazy, so I tossed everything in the crock pot on high for 1 hour, then turned it to low (and added my already cooked meatballs) for the next few hours.   Surprisingly, we were out of tomato sauce, so i subbed crushed tomatoes.  I also had to sub red wine for white wine when I realized we were out of that, too.  I increased the crushed red to almost a teaspoon, and it was perfect.  I WILL make this again.  THANK YOU for the recipe, PAcklam!

I used one sweet onion that I ran through the food processor with the garlic for a finer texture. I omitted the green pepper only because I did not have any and I went easy on the salt. I only had burgundy wine on hand, I used equal amounts in place of the white wine. I made no other changes. I paired this with Meatball Nirvana for homemade meatball sandwiches. EXCELLENT marinara sauce. I seriously can't stop taste testing it. This recipe's a keeper.

I more than doubled the tomatoes and used all fresh tomatoes, I also doubled the spices, kept everything else as is, cooked in crock pot for 4hrs then used immersion blender, so tasty! Froze the extra, will make again for sure

This was the best marinara sauce I’ve made in years! I omitted the green peppers but sautéed some hot Italian sausage. Also put it all in the crock pot on low for 5 hours, delicious! Will definitely make it again

Excellent sauce!  Just put everything into the crock pot and cooked one hour on high and four hours on low.  Followed the recipe except for the addition of fresh mushrooms.

I made this sauce with homemade ravioli's for Christmas for a large family gathering and it was a huge success. My daughters dipped bread in the pot as the sauce simmered. They said it was addictive. I wouldn't change a thing. This marinara is amazing!

Hands down the most flavorful marinara I've ever made ... and my kids loved it! Next time, I'll sub red wine for white just to see how it turns out. Loved this recipe!

This was sooo amazingly delicious!  I did make several changes based on what ingredients I had.  I left out the peppers and for seasoning just used italian, basil, salt & pepper, and red pepper flakes (a healthy amount because I like spicy).  I used only a can of tomatoes and no tomato sauce or paste.  I used a splash of red wine that I had on hand instead of white.  Added a dash of flour to thicken it up, brought to a boil and then simmered about 10 minutes.  It turned out great and was so easy.

Life saver recipe. Thank you! This is a forgiving recipe as well. I used a combination of 2 cans tomato sauce, 2 cans tomato paste, and one can tomatoes. Think it would have probably been better if I'd used the ingredients listed. However, I used what I had and came out great. The seasonings are what make what I had work.

This is a SUPERB marina! A keeper for real.  I made only a couple changes. I was out of white wine, so I used sweet red wine, 1/2 cup. I substituted the green bell for roasted jarred red bell pepper. And, I sautéed the onion, pepper, garlic and spices until onion was tender.  I processed the tomatoes first then, added the onion mix and processed until smooth. Then poured into sauce pan and cooked on low for an hour. Turned out so delicious, I couldn't stop taking spoons full out for testing...delicious just by itself.....lol

Love this recipe! I made a few minor adjustments to suit my family's tastes, but the basic ratios of tomato paste, diced tomato, and tomato sauce are perfect. I will never buy sauce in a jar again!

I've made this before and it is very good. This time I added a bunch of mushroom to it. It's simmering now and will be refridgerated overnight. Tomorrow I'll bring it back up to temp, add browned Italian sausage links and fresh basil. I'll simmer it an hour to make sure the sausage is cooked thru. As Justin Wilson used to say, "I guarantee". I'll add a photo tomorrow as well.

This was pretty good, also easy, as the title says. It makes a lot of sauce. The depth of flavour that a long simmered sauce has is not there, but I plan to put a parmesan rind in next time, as well as adding some fresh chopped Italian parsley, and I think those changes will help. Thanks!

So simple and oh so YUM! I didn't measure anything (mom never did so I never do), used fresh tomatoes and only had red wine. Thanks for a great marinara recipe!  Brown Sugar....WOW  :-)

Would give 4.5 stars if I could. This recipe went together quickly, and the flavor is exquisite! I would never have thought to use brown sugar, but it adds a little more depth of flavor (while cutting the tomatoes' acidity) than does white sugar. I did find the texture a little too chunky for me, so next time, I will use petite diced tomatoes. This recipe makes a lot, so I split the sauce into fourths; one went into the fridge, and the other three portions are in the freezer for later. This is probably going to become my go-to sauce recipe; thanks so much for sharing it! 6/14/2014: For some weird reason, I had four cans of stewed tomatoes, but no diced tomatoes, in the pantry. I pureed the stewed tomatoes in the blender and used them. Delicious, and the smooth texture I wanted!

The whole family loved this! My husband keeps saying "Do not lose this recipe!" I had lots of fresh tomatoes from the garden, so I used that instead of caned. Also did not have red pepper flakes on hand. Did not change anything else. Great recipe, thank you!!
