I used Raspberry Pucker in this drink recipe only because that was all I had. To make it fizzy, I poured the shots over ice in a big glass, then filled it to the top with club soda. BOY, was this GOOD.

Very nice. We use Razz-Matazz for the raspberry flavor and we call these Purple hooters. Make them into shots or on the rocks. Sure to please. Thanks for the reminder. Will be knocking these back for monday night football soon....

This is a nice drink.  We don't stock gin (one bad college night...you get it), so I left it out.  Our Chambord is circa a decade or so ago, so it may be even better w/fresh hootch.  If you've got everything on hand, this is a nice cocktail to give a shake.  Or two.

Chris and his beautiful wife have a gathering of friends every year in Summer.  Pool,amazing food,a killer band best in Fox valley, and a full bar. I had the pleasure of bartending for a few years and this recipe they came across on a trip to NYC years ago. We would put it in a frozen drink machine and make it in large batches. 
So GOOD...
plus perfect for the whole day and night poolside. 
I miss you all. Best group of people you could have had the opportunity to serve.

Pretty strong and expensive combination. The flavor wasn't that refreshing and in fact it reminded me of cough medicine.

I made this for a group, so I multiplied the recipe by 12 in a pitcher. It's good as described, but some of the group thought it was too boozy (which.... duh). Some might want something to add bubbles with sprite or club soda.
