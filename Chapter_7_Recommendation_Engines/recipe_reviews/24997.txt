Let me start by saying that I'm a very experienced cook of 30 years. I was looking for a low fat chocolate cake & thought I'd try this one. In my opinion this recipe needs three major adjustments: 1. Double the amount of chocolate 2. Add the chocolate mixture just before blending the flour & sour milk; the recipe instructions give no indication of WHEN to add the chocolate. This could be disastrous to a novice cook. 3. Use a 9x9 pan (9x13 is way too big as the cake will turn out very flat)

This cake was ok. The recipe did not call for nearly enough chocolate so I had to keep adding chocolate and then it ended up being too chocolaty. The cake itself was ok it is a rather dense cake. If you try it I would double or triple (no more than that) depending on how dark you like your chocolate.

easy to make just a little dry. I followed reviewers advise and added more cocoa. I upped the hot water to match the cocoa amount

I really like this chocolate cake. Turned out moist and just chocolaty enough that when I put the chocolate buttercream on it balanced perfectly. I did make one small adjustment that I often make to chocolate things. 1tsp pod instant coffee. It doesn't make the cake taste like coffee it just enhances the chocolate flavour.
