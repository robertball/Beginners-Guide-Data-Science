Taralli, or, as we called them in my extended Vaccarelli family, "Tadads" are part of our family identity.  Funny how something so small as breadsticks in a brown paper bag from your grandmother's house could bring back such important memories.  My grandparents, Rose and Frank Vaccarelli, were from Bari, Italy.  The only difference in our recipe is that we make them with "spry" (as written on the old recipe) or, Crisco, instead of oil. In our family, the argument is who likes them crispy or soft.

Recipe yields good biscuits but recipe owner should know that Nona is feminine singular... None is feminine plural... Noni is masculine plural  while Nono is masculine singular. Gotta get that straight lest you want the Italian Grammer Gods to get angry.
