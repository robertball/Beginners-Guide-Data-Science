Simple and very good! Will this replace my favorite fudge recipe...no, but for a quick and easy treat, this is great! It only took 1 minute in my microwave. I think it took longer for me to line the pan then it did to actually make the fudge, lol. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Too much condensed milk. Use only half a can per 11-12 ounces of chocolate chips.  Made the adjustment and came out perfectly- easy to make and delicious

Never solidified except in freezer, and when I took it out and put it in the fridge it went back to liquid.
