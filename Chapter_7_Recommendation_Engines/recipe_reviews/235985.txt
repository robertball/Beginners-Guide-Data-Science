The flavor of this shepherd's pie was great, but why dirty 5 pans?!  If you don't have a maid, I'd suggest starting with a large cast iron skillet, cook the meat, onion and carrot together, drain, add butter and flour to skillet to form a roux, then add the beer, bouillon, etc. and simmer 'til thickened. Top with potatoes, cheese, etc. and put under the broiler as instructed. Get the same yummy results with much less cleanup!

This recipe is to die for! It is so good that my husband and I thought it was quite possibly one of the best things we have ever tasted, and I have a very wide culinary repertoire having lived in three different countries, and I LOVE to cook! I have been making shepherds pie for 20 years but this will be the only shepherds pie recipe I ever use from now on! The only thing I changed was that I added more carrots and peas - I probably doubled them at least. It was wonderful and we couldn't stop eating it and my husband keeps asking me when I will be making it again (even though it is now 112 degrees outside, lol) Comfort food at it's BEST!

Awesome shepherd's pie!!  Shepherd's pie is supposed to be lamb, (shepherd. . .sheep)  So many people use beef and call it shepherd's pie but a beef pie is a "cottage pie", so right away I was interested.   Kudos for using the Guinness!   The only thing I did different was to add the flour to the meat mixture and stir and cook  for a couple minutes then add the broth directly.  This is the method I use for sausage gravy, it saves a step and a pan and you never have any lumps.   This Irish girl approves darklordlarry!

This is, hands down, the best shepherds pie recipe Ever!!! I didn't have fresh carrots, so I used a  bag of frozen mixed veggies. I added a minced shallot and minced garlic to the potatoes. I didn't have enough lamb, so I mixed some sausage in to make up the difference and to add a bit of saltiness to the meat. Finally, I layered the meat, then the veggies, and potatoes on top. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes because it had cooled a bit by the time I got it put together, and then I topped it with cheese, parsley, paprika, and put it under the broiler till the cheese bubbled. My whole family loved it, including my daughter, who likes nothing I make. The changes I made were due to personal preference, not because I felt the recipe needed changed. The beer gravy is what makes this recipe amazing, so, no matter what you do, don't change that part at all. Except, of course, if you want more gravy.  Next time, I will double the gravy and pour it over the potatoes. It's just so good!

I liked that this recipe uses all real ingredients (no canned soup, for example), and it's easy to make simple substitutes with what is on-hand.  I subbed in greek yogurt for the sour cream, corn for the peas, and beef for the lamb.  Super simple to make and yields an excellent result.  This is one for the recipe box!

This was a little more advanced than my cooking skill.  I tried it and it was so good!  The steps ended up being easier than anticipated. Tasted like I was eating a meal at a restaurant.  I will cook it again.

This recipe blows all others for Shepard pie. I made a few minor changes to the mashed potatoes. First I only use yukon gold potatos I leave the skin on and my secret to great mashed potatoes is I boil 1 cut up celery root with the potatoes and mash together, I also ground up some roasted garlic and combined that too. when I made the roux I made and used more then the recipe called for. I made all of it in a large cast iron skillet. fantastic look no further.

I made this recipe  three times: Once as is, two with more vegetables, and three with ground beef. Lamb is the absolute best for me. This recipe is awesome! You can manipulate it to suit your palate and heritage. Me, I like it with celery, mushrooms, and garlic. I used 1/2 of a portabella mushroom, 1 stalk of celery, and 3 cloves of small garlic. Does it make this recipe better? I don't think so. When I made the recipe as written it was wonderful! The flavors and sauce were fantastic! Follow the recipe as it is written. If you want more or less then make the changes to suit your palate and family's  likes. This is an awesome recipe. Very easy for anyone who loves to cook. I prefer mushroom and beef base mixed together instead of the bouillon. I like a thicker sauce so I make a New Orleans roux twice the flour to the  butter. Again, the changes don't make this recipe better. The changes I made suit my tastes.

Thank you, darklordlarry, for the best Shepherd's Pie recipe ever - it is pure magic! I used the smoked cheddar cheese as you suggested and that tip was right on.  Your recipe is perfect as written.  The only change I made was out of necessity - the only pan I had available was pyrex and to avoid a "shrapnel" incident I baked the pie on the 2nd to top rack at 425 degrees for 15 minutes instead of using the broiler.  I'll be making this on a regular basis, for sure.  Now I'm going to go eat that last lonely piece of it for breakfast!

I made the recipe as written but doubled the beer gravy. That was my first lamb dish and I was pleased with how it turned out. my son on the other hand is not a fan.

This is the best shepherds pie I've ever tasted. I did use hamburger because I didn't have lamb. I used cornstarch to thicken it because I didn't want to use wheat. But everything else was the same and the taste was wonderful!

This was awesome, I doubled the recipe it fed 6 adults there was nothing left over I couldn't believe it! The Guinness was key. Will make often. I did not use sour cream or cheese in the mashed potatoes it was perfect

Fantastic!  I considered using ground beef since it's a bit easier to find, but that would have been a big mistake.  This recipe is absolutely perfect and the directions were very easy to follow.

This was the best shepherds pie I've ever made. I did make few changes though. I added a half pound of leftover ground veal, I mashed one large parsnip into the potatoes and I substituted 3 stalks of chopped celery instead of the onion because I like to share a bite or two with my dogs and dogs mustn't eat onions. I'll definitely make this again as shepherds pie is my favorite comfort food.

Fantastic! Good enough for me to write a review, which doesn't happen often. I used YuengLing instead of Guinness, which worked out just fine. Guessed on the amount of potato's I used, most of a 5lb bag. (Whatever fit my large pot when boiling.) Will absolutely make again!

This was delicious.  Even better the next day when the flavors develop.  Everyone including my neighbors asked for the recipe and cleaned their plates.  I only added more veggies as suggested...otherwise the recipe is perfect as is.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!!

Amazing. I sort of winged it after watching the video, but lamb, vegetables, beer, potatoes mixture and the seasonings are all great. I put a little bit of hot sauce in there at the end to give it just a tad of kick, but wow.  Make it 90% the recipe and finish the other 10% your way. And make lots of leftovers b/c this is great.

This was fantastic. In fact, it's going in my permanent collection. I used extra sharp white cheddar for the top, added some chopped parsley to the sauté and doubled the Worcestershire sauce because I like it so much, but other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely. My husband  and I loved it!

This is a fabulous shepherd's pie! We raise grass-fed sheep, so the lamb came from my freezer making it all the better. I used crushed tomatoes (canned from last year's garden) & regular paprika. I only had a mild cheddar on hand & used that. I doubled the recipe, making two 9x13 pans, one for tonight & one for another meal. There were no leftovers tonight! I can't wait to have this again.

Loved this.  Best shepherd's pie I have ever had.  Had to add extra sugar to counteract the bitterness of the beer I happened to have on hand, though.

This was WONDERFUL!!!!  A lot of steps but well worth it.  It was soupier than I wanted it to be.  It didn't thicken into a gravy, but that was probably my fault!  The flavor was superb and my kids all loved it.  I was glad that I had splurged on the ground lamb too :) Thank you for sharing. This will be the only Shepherd's Pie I will use for now on.

Since we live in NW Montana and we both hunt, I made this recipe using venison, and it did not disappoint!  We both LOVED it!  I did end up simmering the meat mixture to thicken the sauce and then I baked it for a half hour to cook the carrots and onions.  I will be making this the next time we have a snowshoeing party!

Awesome. Followed the recipe exactly, cutting portions in half. Mashed Green Giant Klondike Goldust yellow potatoes and added a bit of minced garlic and shallots to them. My wife said she was not a favorite of Shepherd's Pie, but scarfed this up and loved it.

My family loved it! I used beef instead of lamb, frozen veggies, diced tomatoes, and added some fresh thyme. I thought the gravy had too much bite so I added a teaspoon of sugar. My kids and wife couldn't stop eating it!

I'd cut the amount of potatoes in half and use a smaller baking dish.   Otherwise pretty good.

This is a fantastic recipe!  To all the recipes using ground beef, if I'm not mistaken that's a Cottage Pie. Good but just not the same as the lamb-based Shepard's Pie. I followed this recipe precisely except I added a bit of Garam Masala to the lamb mixture as it simmered. Sure I made a mess in the kitchen with all those pots and pans but it was definitely worth it. Worthy of at 6 stars!

This was AMAZING! My first time making Shepherds pie. My carrots went bad so I used a can of corn instead. I also used ground beef instead of lamb because we're on a budget. I made a double batch to freeze one and only had an 11.2 oz Guinness, so I added 5 oz of water to bring it to the required 16 oz. Definitely going in my rotation.

Because of a diabetic in the family, I substituted mashed cauliflower for the mashed potatoes. 
The meal was perfectly seasoned per the recipe.

Phenomenal! My husband doesn't like lamb so I made it with hamburger and had to substitute a different beer and cheese, but it was great anyway. To reduce the steps and number of pots a bit, I cooked the onions with the hamburger and used frozen peas and carrots. I also heated the beer and bullion in the microwave rather than another pot. I used 2.5 pounds of unpeeled yellow potatoes and it seemed to be the perfect amount. We will definitely have this again.

I've tried various versions of shepherd's pie and this is by far the best.  I didn't have any stout and had to use a local amber ale and it is delicious.  I am anxious to get my hands on some stout to see how that changes things.

If I had to spend the rest of my life eating only one thing, this would be it.  Only thing I skip is the peas, but beyond that, spot on.  I also use this recipe for cottage pie (beef instead of lamb) and whatever the heck it's called when you use venison.  SUPER YUM!

I made this for a work place cook off contest and won first place! It was fantastic!  Next time I might  make 1 1/2 times as much of the lamb/vegetable/gravy part of this recipe to have more of that relative to the amount of mashed potatoes, but it was absolutely scrumptious!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  When I told my husband we were having Shepherd's Pie for supper he was less than enthusiastic.  As I was cooking this recipe he came into the kitchen and asked what smelled so good.  The dish tasted even better than it smelled!  I followed recipe except I didn't have any stout and had to make due with an Apple Ale ( I also made the gravy in the pan with the meat and veg as one reviewer suggested).  My family has asked for this to be made more often.  High praise indeed;)

My kids don't like carrots or peas and loved this. First I doubled the recipe to have leftovers. I don't think that is necessary though. If I do that again I will divide into 3 dishes to freeze two. I bought a bag of frozen carrots and peas and on step 3 added the tomatoes with juice and onions and simmered then when you are supposed to add the peas I added 1-2 cups of the carrots/peas mix. And instead of doing the broiler step I baked covered at 425 for 20 minutes then topped with cheese and baked uncovered 10 minutes. It had a lot of steps which almost kept me from making it but I'm very glad I decided to give it a try. My son has asked that I never make mashed potatoes any other way for any time we make mashed potatoes. He said they were awesome and like they came from a restaurant.

This is easily the best Shepherd pie I've ever had, and I didn't even use lamb...I used ground chuck! I think what set this recipe apart was the tomato, and definitely the Guinness gravy. I used a bit more Worcestershire than called for and my preferred cheddar is Vermont sharp, of which I did add about a half cup to the potatoes. If you're craving Shepherd pie, try this recipe. I know I'll be making it again and again.

This recipe is awesome! I served it to four friends and we all loved it. It took a long time for me to prepare; but the instructions are very detailed and clear for each step of the way, and that really helped. Like others, I also doubled the peas and carrots with great results. I've bookmarked this recipe and definitely will make it again.

This is the second time I've made the recipe and my kids and I love it.  It has a lot of steps, but the more you make it, the easier it gets.  It was significantly easier the second time I made it than the first time.  But I did change it a bit.  I used ground beef instead of lamb (and I cooked the beef in the olive oil for flavor - I just drained real well) and I used beef broth instead of beer (didn't have it on hand). Otherwise, I followed recipe.

Very tasty!  The Guinness and the smoked paprika really added a lot to the richness.  I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, Neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese, and Beyond Beef plant-based "meat" for the lamb.   My spouse and I are on the Noom program, so I'm constantly trying to revise recipes to make them a little less caloric and a little healthier.  Next time I make this I'm going to try to substitute soy or almond milk for the sour cream and cream cheese.  I'm sure there will be a noticeable difference, but I'm willing to give it a try.  But it was great as is!

Sooo goodI have made this 3 times in 2 weeks! The stout beer gravy really makes this dish.  I made 2 changes, instead of putting under the broiler I baked in oven at 350 for about 30 mins I used my own mashed potato recipe which contains sour cream anyway and I don"t put cheese on top, if you leave the cheese off, the potato forms a nice crust.  This pie is so flavorfull you wont miss the cheese.   I made it twice with ground lamb and once with angus ground beef )which technically makes it a cottage pie)  it is really good both ways but I prefer it with the lamb.  You can adjust seasonings  to suit your tatse but don"t leave the beer out! This is the shepard's pie recipe I will use from now on, thanks for posting rhis wonderfull recipe.

Loved it!!! Easy to follow. The only thing I added was onion and garlic salt to the mashed potatoes.

This recipe was amazing!  I enjoyed Shepherds pie in the UK many times during the year i lived there and have always looked for the ultimate recipe.   The Guinness was a great addition that added even more flavor to an already delicious recipe.  I used ground beef rather than lamb, but it would be fantastic with either.  I served this at a dinner with friends and they all asked for the recipe.  I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe tastes so good! I am a novice cook and the instructions were easy to follow. Everyone thought I had been cooking this Shepherds Pie for years and it was the first time I ever made one.

I must say, " I'm a believer!!! I am not a fan of this kind of dish but my husband and my son love it so I gave it a try. The two couldn't stop eating especially my son. The only thing I changed was, I didn't add tomatoes due to dietary restrictions and I didn't have Worcestershire and replaced with knorr savor seasoning but still amazingly delicious!!! My husband got to enjoy the leftover beer.

I don't know how to edit my review.  When I make it again, I'll use fewer potatoes -- more like a frosting than a layer.  I'd leave it in the oven longer.  I liked the crispy crust that forms along the edges.  I'd add more veggies --  celery and green beans in addition to the peas and carrots. I'd reduce the amount of tomato product (I'm assuming here that we all use what we have -- sauce, diced, whole, etc.) I don't know what it would taste like with beer, but I'm not willing to experiment with it because the red wine was sooo delicious.

Overall, there were too many flavours vying with each other. Guinness just didn't seem right - made it a heavier dish than I'm used to, as did the cream cheese, though the sour cream gave it a nice tang. I've tried mash with sour cream since (though not the cream cheese and egg yolk) and it's good.
I won't make this again - paprika, Guinness, sour cream, Worcester sauce - just too much for a Scot like me!

Very good!  The cream cheese and garlic powder was a great addition to the mashed potatoes. I thought it needed a little more ground meat... had no more lamb so added a little beef. GREAT flavor... will certainly  make again!

I'm going to give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the instructions exactly. Some traps I ran into were that the onions were not cooked well enough. I wonder if they should have been cooked with the lamb. I also used way too many pans. I will be thinking about how I can reduce that number.

Over all though it was delicious.

I like Shepard's pie, but it usually is just missing something to enhance the flavor. This Guinness gravy just made it AMAZING. I have passed this recipe around and it is now the only way we cook it.

This was the best Shepard's Pie I've ever made! So I used instant mashed potatoes but instead of milk I added sour cream like the recipe used for fresh mashed potatoes. Im sure the cream cheese could've been added too. I added more salt, personal preference maybe? And I also let the meat mixture cook longer then was said to make the tomatoes cook down. That's all. It's a awesome recipe and I will be making it again!

I’m not a lamb fan to say the least so was EXTREMELY nervous about using it on this dish but after reading all the reviews decided to experiment. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the hearty meal! So much so that he actually had a second serving right away. Did recipe as instructed and will be saving it for future use! Thank you!

my family loved it. i made the mashed potatoes a little differently--  no egg yolk, a little milk--and just put the beer in the roue without heating with bullion. I put the bullion and the worchestershire directly into the pan with the lamb and veggies. I also used a large frying pan that can go in oven so just put mashed potatoes on top and under the broiler. 1 less pan to clean

To be fair, I do not care for lamb so my own taste is a bias up front.  That said, my spouse very much liked this and had requested Shepherd's Pie for his birthday dinner.  So, I will make this again but will use beef instead.  I also will say, that we really liked the mashed potatoes that are made in this recipe so I will use those ingredients for our next side dish of mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fun to make and it is so good. It’s one of those dishes that is even better the next day. Next time, I will make 1 1/2 the mixture recipe. I thought it needed a little more meat and vegetables.

Pretty good... lots of flavor! Ladyfriend loved it.
I went ez on the potatoes, maybe 2.5-3 cups.
Used a Scottish Ale instead of an Irish Stout... I mean, it's a "Scotsman's" Shepherd Pie afterall.
Also used a cpl drops of liquid smoke in the meat mixture since I don't have any "Smokey Paprika".
Happy Cooking!

Add this for my 7 yr o.d who was exposed to shepherds pie at a restaurant and loved it! It was a lot of work IMO, but delicious - I made as recipe just as is with out a stout (didn’t have any so use reg beer) and it turned out great. Was told by my husband that it was actually better as left overs the next day!

Really great.  Had to buy a 4-pack of Guinness.  It was a real hardship drinking the left-overs!  This is probably one of the best Sheppard's pies I've had.  Hats off.

Very good recipe, my only complaint would be the amount of pots needed. Didn't have real potatoes so used instant and actually forgot to add the sour cream. Also realized I was out of peas last minute but it was still delicious. Will definitely make it again and make sure I have everything and use all the ingredients... Lol!!

Used Yukon Gold Potatoes, celery instead of peas, used smoked cheddar cheese, mixed the parsley, paprika and cheese into the potatoes instead of sprinkling on top.  It’s pretty good!  The lamb’s “gamey” flavor is the only off putting part.

It turned out exactly as it was supposed to.  The only thing I changed (because it's what I had in hand) is I added a small bag of mixed frozen vegetables instead of just peas and carrots.  Also, all I had available was a 12 ounce can of stewed tomatoes (not 16 ounce) and cream cheese with garlic and chives.  It was fine.  The mashed potatoes were sublime.

I made a double batch, and realized that I needed much more Flour than I thought I would, and I also needed more Worcheshire sauce, and as horrible as it sounds I think a tablespoon of Ketchup would have helped a lot.  My guess is that the flavor profile I was hoping for is something different than this recipe.  HOWEVER, I was happy with the base and starting point that this recipe gave me!  (I also learned that the beer is a big choice as well, I didn't use Guiness, but there are a couple of other Stouts that I think would have been better than what I used.)

I replaced beer with water and I didnt have peas, so I used one cubed zucchini and a handful frozen spinach. Draining the lamb fat after browning it is very important. the smoked paprika gave it a very nice taste! I felt I was Scottish when I was eating it with my husband who thought it was amazing :) 5 stars!

Delish! I subbed celery for the peas just cause that’s what was in the fridge and I forgot the paprika and parsley at the end, but it was still totally fabulous. Will definitely make again

This recipe was delicious !!  We did not have Guinness so I used Yeungling it probably would have been more rich with the Guinness.  The filling was a little watery next time I will strain the tomatoes.  I strained the filling before I put it into the casserole.  I ended up putting a 1/2 can of cream of chicken in the filling because I wanted the gravy a little more rich - see Guinness comment - I know cream of chicken sounds strange but that is what I had.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  Everyone loved it will definitely make again!!

YUMMMMM.  

I save 5 stars for truly unusual and exceptional recipes ... but I came close, on this one.  I'd give it a solid 4.5 if I could.  This is delicious.  

My minor adjustments:  

I used a leek rather than an onion -- and the leek served nicely.  I'm sure an onion would have done so as well; I just happened to be out of onions and had a leek.  Only other change was to leave out the egg yolk from the mashed potatoes -- I was out of eggs.  Even without the egg yolk, the dressed up mashed potatoes with sour cream and cream cheese and butter were fantastic -- I'm sure they'd have been even more decadent with the egg and I'll do that next time!  

Minor error on my part -- use GOOD cheddar.  Again, using what I had ... I used sharp shredded 2%.  Should have known better, and I will next time.  

And one thing that was less successful for me than might be ideal -- I simmered the veggies about ten minutes LONGER than called for, but the carrots (though chopped quite small) were still a bit toothy in the finished pie.  I might pre-cook them a bit next time.  

Still -- this was VERY good.  As other reviews have said, it's the stout gravy that takes this up a big notch!   Whatever you do, do NOT mess with that -- it's excellent.

OVERALL: It was absolutely delicious, both fresh from the oven and as leftovers! CHANGES, based on what I had on hand: leftover mashed potatoes, which I doctored up as directed; honey beer instead of stout; corn instead of peas, because Mister Pickypants doesn't particularly like peas; and used about half the onion called for. OBSERVATIONS: 1) My carrots needed to cook a LOT longer than the recipe directed. Next time, I'll  saute the veggies first. 2) My 9x13" pan yielded too thin a layer of meat in proportion to the potatoes. Next time, I'll use an 8 x 8" dish and reduce the amount of potato. 3) At 386 calories for a 3x4" serving, it's not something I will eat often -- which is good, because 4) I must say, the recipe dirties a lot of pans!

Wow, my whole family absolutely loved this savory, delicious pie. I made the recipe exactly as described other than adding a teaspoon of chili powder to the lamb mixture for a little extra spice. I will absolutely make this pie again but next time I will use more than five cups of mashed potatoes because I didn't have quite enough to cover the whole pie from edge to edge. While five cups of potatoes made it most of the way, I was spreading them pretty thin to get close to the edges. Despite the little extra work this recipe requires, it is well worth it.

I substituted the lamb with ground beef since my grocer didn’t have the lamb. Added some more veggies like corn and green beans, and doubled the gravy as other reviews suggested. My whole family loves this dish!!! Can’t wait to try with the lamb!

I wouldn't have made it if it weren't for all the great reviews, and boy, I'm sure happy I did!  Not being used to the taste of lamb, it took me two bites to forget that. Deeeelicious!  I didn't have cream cheese so I added more sour cream and butter. I dont like carrots, so I doubled the peas and added corn and fresh mushrooms. This made it go farther for more people. Otherwise I made it following the recipe. Will def be sharing this recipe!

Exceptionally good 'pie'.  Would not think to make this without the Guinness, extra sharp cheddar and smoked sweet paprika.  Loved it, will make it again when I have someone to cook for that eats real food instead of junk foods.

So good and worth the extra steps.  The most important thing is the beer, worsteshire, boullion, butter and flour step is THE most important step to this recipe.  It makes or breaks it.

I had lots of left over mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving so I looked for a recipe for Shepard pie. This recipe did not disappoint. I had ground Angus in the freezer and substituted that for the lamb but it was still so good. My family of 6 ate the ENTIRE pie in one sitting, I had to rescue a plate full from my 14 yr old so that my husband (who hadn't made it to the table yet) would be able to have some. The kids all had seconds and thirds! Definately will be making this again.

This is always a winter favorite. Normally use beef instead of lamb.  Also I normally make individual servings in crocks which I can freeze some of them to have later.

My whole family loved this and were fighting over the leftovers.  It does use more pans than I'd like, but sometimes that's the tradeoff. I did use instant potatoes and more carrots and peas than the recipe called for and it worked out great.

If you follow the recipe preparation as described you will end up with raw carrots in your pie.  Prepare the carrots in advance.  Carrots aside, the recipe is ok.

This was SO GOOD! The only step I changed was to make the roux and then add the beer and bouillon to that instead of heating it separately. I also added more veggies because it didn’t seem like there were enough. Also doubled the gravy due to others comments. Everyone loved it and had seconds. Oh and I just put the whole egg into the mashed potatoes as I didn’t want to have just one egg white left over. There were no issues with that at all.

Just wow!  I did everything per the recipe except swapped out the lamb (not fans of it) for ground veal.  Also just did everything in my Le Creuset cast iron skillet and put it from cook top into broiler.  This is a total keeper!

Based on all the 5 start reviews I made this for a family get together. The only change I made was to add more veggies. I was not real impressed. Apparently from the absence of comments neither was anyone else. For me the gravy was blah, not enough body.

Really delicious! This was one of the best Shepherd Pies I've ever made. The cream cheese and beer add a whole new depth of flavor. This time was in a time crunch, so Instead of ground lamb, I used lean ground sirloin and instant Hungry Jack Mashed Potatoes... it was wonderful!  Thanks  Larry and All Recpies!

This was surprisingly great and easy.  I was even able to win over the picky kids with the cheddar mash on top (definitely use the smoked cheddar and smoked paprika!).  I also was able to do this all in one skillet  stovetop like other reviewers before broiling, so it was less messy and less daunting. I cooked the onions, carrots and meat, then drained the fat. Added the flour and butter to make the roux (pushed the meat to one side of the skillet) then added the beer, worchestershire and boullion. Once this was thick I added the peas and tomatoes.  The stewed tomatoes made it a little watery so I had to cook it for awhile to thicken it up again- I recommend draining them. I used instant mashed potatoes as this was an impromptu weeknight dinner but next time will try homemade.

This recipe has amazing flavor!  I have made it twice.  The first time I used a raw carrot and even though I simmered it twice as long as instructed the carrot was still very crunchy.  The next time I added a 1/2 cup canned carrots and it was much better.

I used venison because that's what we have. I didn't have any beef bullion it would definitely enhanced the flavor. This dish was incredibly flavorful, I simmered the Guinness without the bullion and added it to the butter/flour mix. This is a winner, will absolutely make again!!!

I followed this recipe to the T, except I made a little bit more of the gravy as others did. The ingredients were rather pricy.  My mother loved it, i thought it was pretty good, my husband didn't care for it too much, which I was surprised. My school aged boys didn't like it. Overall, I would rate it 3-4 stars. I probably won't be making this very often.

I made this and it turned out terrible. I'm not sure if I did something wrong. Or maybe I just don't care for smoked paprika. The smoke flavour overpowered the entire dish. Instead of adding it all at once, I should have added a little at a time as I tasted.

Only changes made were doubling the veggies as I like veggies and used smoked cheddar cheese.  Both were recommended by other reviews.  This was absolutely delicious and my guest asked for the recipe.

I made this the lazy way but it was still very tasty. I cooked the butter, lamb and onions in a large pan, then sprinkled in the flour and mixed it well. I poured in cold beer and mixed it well (no lumps!). I added the tomatoes, seasonings etc. and cooked until thick while I finished preparing the potatoes. I added some frozen carrots and peas, spooned on the potatoes, sprinkled with the toppings and put the pan straight in the oven at 350 degrees to melt the cheese. I didn't think I'd like lamb because it smelled gamey but it was delicious.

I substituted petite diced tomatoes for stewed tomatoes, and a domestic beer since I didn't have any Irish beer on hand.  We loved the taste, but it took me more than 45 minutes to assemble. So it's not a "quick 'n easy" dinner, but worth the effort.

Many variations of cottage/shepherds pie... I made it using a local brew called Creemore Springs and I also had some Red Stripe that I've been trying to get rid of so threw that in there as well… Definitely should have used Guinness, but still turned out pretty good. Used The wrong size of tomato can I think because it tastes really tomatoey. Also used stewing beef (about 1.8lbs), cut up into less than quarter inch cubes. Added a layer of corn between the meat layer and the potato topping. Crack'on Jimmey!

This recipe is fantastic! I used ground beef, but only because of household meat preference. I think a recipe should be rated as is, and we loved it! Only change was the ground beef. I will definitely make this again!

Was worried about the beer gravy as I hate the taste of beer, however, it was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Made enough for six adults and everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

Love, love, love this recipe. I had several pounds of ground lamb in my freezer and didn't know what to do with it. Found this recipe and now it's a go-to and family favorite. Didn't change a thing. Thank you!

It's a lot of work, but worth it!!!  I made the base of the roux (butter and flour) in the microwave to avoid dirtying another big pan, and that worked perfectly.  Otherwise followed the recipe to a t.  Rave reviews all around!

This recipe resulted in my personal best Shepherd's Pie ever.  Though it was savory and filling, people got seconds until it was gone. I made a couple very small tweaks; I added leeks with the carrots, and I doubled the gravy mix to make up for the extra half pound of lamb I used. I was thrilled with the final result. This is comfort food at its best, and even made a convert of a guest who "hated lamb." I highly recommend this dish as a warm and homey main course.

This was amazing! I hate lamb, it tastes like dirt. But I made it for a party of 12, so I doubled it and put it in individual pie pans. Everyone raved over it. Even I liked it! I wanted seconds! Have I mentioned I hate lamb? The lamb taste was subtle and everything else just mingled together to make a great dinner. Thank you for a lovely recipe!

I made 2 dishes of this. I didn't have enough mashed potatoes for the 2nd dish, so I added rice to the meat mixture and it was really good. I didn't have the beer on hand and it was fine without it.

This is without a doubt the best shepherd's pie I have ever eaten. It is a bit labor intensive, and the kitchen was a mess afterward,  but I will make this again and again. I followed the directions exactly except I used regular paprika (didn't have any smoked). Great result!

Wow, wow, wow! I made this the other night and it was absolutely perfect. I FINALLY impressed my chef husband with a meal!! I thought it was going to be difficult at my level but it was actually fun to make.  We're having it again tonight already but I'm going to try the "cottage pie" version. Excellent dish, thanks for the great recipe! Definitely a keeper.

This is an awesome pie! I must admit, upon request and based on personal taste, I did use beef. Other than that I kept the recipe the same. I did make these into smaller pies, and gave them to a friend at work, whose wife was ill. When she unfortunately had to go back to the hospital this time, I asked him if I could make him something again. He asked for this right away. He's from England, so I will take that as a complement for sure:) he really loves this dish, and it's great to give him something he can just heat up and eat after being at the hospital all day. I piped the taters on top to make it purty. My boyfriend quite literally meat gazes the whole time I'm in the kitchen making this. Comfort food at its finest. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is a huge hit no matter who eats it. I do tend to add a little bit more Worcestershire sauce to make the gravy a little less bitter from the Guinness.  AMAZING!

I used ground beef and ground pork because the wife doesn't eat lamb, and we left out the tomatoes because, well, they didn't seem to fit in with the dish IMO. Also left out the cream cheese because we didn't have any, and used mexican shredded cheese instead of sharp cheddar. None of that mattered because the dish was delish! I also made a Guinness gravy (butter, flour, beer, milk, beef bouillon, salt, pepper) to  trickle on top after serving. Been making Shepherd's pie for years now and wanted to try something a little different, and this was spectacular. This is my new go-to! Thanks for sharing.

We both loved this. Basically followed the recipe. I didn't have any peas so I used frozen green beans from my garden instead Used some short cuts because I didn't want to dirty all those pans :-). Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I added extra veggies, but kept everything else the same.  This was absolutely delicious.  My family loved it, so I've made it several times.  We definitely enjoy the flavor of the lamb in this recipe as opposed to beef.

I used 4.5cups of a mixture of sweet, golden yellow and red potatoes with skin on.  This still is a lot of potato layer.  Next time will use 3.5-4 cups.  I also substituted the lamb for baby portabella mushrooms since I am a vegetarian.  Very good flavor and would even add more quantity of vegetables as well as adding other such as broccoli next time.

I thought this was fantastic!!  I had everything on hand which made it nice.  I really really liked this and so did my son.  My hubby liked it but says he might "be over eating lamb for awhile".  This will for sure by my go-to shepherds pie recipe.

To combat the gamey taste I tripled the worcestershire and added some onion powder. Personally don't like Guinness so I found Sam Addams cream stout. which has a hint of dark chocolate and coffee. This recipe is alot of food invite some friends.

I made it as written, and it turned out pretty good.  I think that it would work fine with ground beef given how expensive lamb is.  It didn't seem like it was an excessive amount of work, and could be made even easier if using instant mashed potatoes.

A new family favorite! I substituted the lamb with ground turkey (didn't have lamb), and used a regular dark beer (didn't have Guinness) and omitted the parsley and paprika (Same reason) and it was fabulous! Will make again for sure.

This recipe is awesome! I've made Shepherd's Pie before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My neighbor stopped by and I gave her a taste and she asked for the recipe because she loved it too! There's a lot of prep work but well worth it when you taste it!

This is seriously the best shepherd's pie recipe that I have tried. I was skeptical about the Guinness beer but it really works with ground lamb. I will confess that in a moment of panic toward the end I added a teaspoon of sugar to the gravy- it seemed bitter to me and I don't know for sure but I do think the sugar did mellow it out just enough. Thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

This is a very fiddly recipe with a pile of added steps and ingredients that really added little to the recipe for me.  I'm going to keep the Guinness sauce, but return to my traditional shepherds pie.

WOW, didn't change a thing, except I used  Dubliner cheese  because it was leftover from the last shepherd's pie,  will stick to everything next time.  I will be definitely making again.  After using this site for over 7+ years, I have never left a review, but I must say this recipe was fantastic, and as other reviewers say, the beer I believe was the key to this....I did double the carrots and peas as well, but will try doubling the beer as other's suggested next time.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!  This is "comfort food" at its best!  Thanks so much!

I stumbled across this recipe looking to make shepherds pie about a year ago and I have now made it about a dozen times. It's the best shepherds pie I've ever had, including ones I had to pay for. I follow the instructions pretty closely, about the only thing I change is I typically just use a can of mixed peas and carrots to save some time. Sometimes I'll splurge and use smoked cheddar with the standard cheddar, and I go heavy on the smoked paprika. It's a  great recipe, easy to prepare and if you're looking for "comfort" food, this is it. The whole family loves it and the leftovers never last long.

I made it today and thought it was excellent. I used a dark Cambodian beer as Guinness is hard to get here, but it worked just fine.

I would add more cheese topping the next time but that is just a personal preference.

My husband and I liked it but my picky five year old was overly concerned about the paprika. Will make again adding the paprika to our plates instead baking or I could mix it into the meat sauce.

I mostly followed the given directions. However, I boiled the potatoes while cutting the carrots and onions, and instead of mixing the butter and flour in a third pan, I melted the butter in a small dish in the microwave and mixed the flour into that. I also stirred the paprika and parsley into the meat mixture (I used beef because I didn't have lamb) so the spices could be to taste. I used 1 tbsp smoked paprika and 1 tbsp regular paprika, 2 tbsp parsley, 1 tbsp garlic (this was a bit too much, even though my family really likes garlic), about 1 tsp ground red pepper, around 1 tsp cinnamon, and an extra splash of worcestershire sauce. Also, the mashed potatoes were not very smooth, so I added some milk to them. All in all, this tasted fantastic! I'll definitely make this again!

I had two pounds of hamburger I needed to use, so I used it instead of lamb and doubled this recipe.  I was looking for something that seemed similar to a favorite dish I had in a Pub in Galway, Ireland. This seemed like it could be similar...and it was.  I knew I didn't want a  recipe that use canned soup.  A double recipe made a lot, but I fed 10 people with it and had leftovers for another meal for 3 of us at least.  Everyone really liked it and my adult son who would never really eat something like this went for  seconds along with some others.  

My changes...to cut down on time, I mixed 4 bags of Idahoan Four Cheese Instant Potatoes as directed and added 2 T butter, 4 oz of cream cheese, 1 cup of sour cream and two egg yolks.  I used an emersion blender to mix until it was all really smooth. My son said he thinks those cheese potatoes with the cheese on top really made it. 

For the sauce, since I was doubling and my bottle of Guinness was only 12 oz., I added 4 oz. of water to make 2 cups.  My grocer was kind enough to break a carton and just sell me one...there were three different varieties, but he said the Extra Stout was the original, so that's what I got.  Instead of a bullion cube, I used 2 t." Better Than Bouillon"  because I had a jar of it in my fridge. 

To the meat I added a 12 oz bag of frozen mixed peas and carrots and then about a cup more of peas after I had sautéed the onion with the beef.  My stewed tomatoes were quite large, so I did chop them up in t

Amazing, such flavours - so rich. We loved the gravy - with every bite you can taste all the flavours, potatoes, beer, tomatoes and the meat! I would make the gravy and potatoes and meat as separate dishes - they're that good!

Awesome but it was a lot of work and made a lot of dishes.  I swapped beef with the lamb since we didn't have that at my local store.  Also used normal paprika instead of smoked.

The lamb component was too large for a skillet for me. I'd recommend using a pot. Otherwise the flavor of this is good, though it takes a while to make (~3 hours alone).

I used the Hi setting on my broiler.

I came across this recipe while browsing for a Shepherd's pie w/o corn. Here is what I did:
I used hamburger not lamb.
omitted peas because I don't like them.
used fresh tomatoes, canned is "tinny".
used 2 carrots.
omitted the beer & used water with 2 cubes.
did a light sprinkle of cheese.
End result was probably the best Shepherd's pie I've ever eaten. Others claimed it was a lot of work. It is time consuming, more so if you use all fresh vs canned/powdered. BUT, the recipe clearly states over an hour and it is well worth the effort.

I modified to what I had on hand which was a beef roast leftover.  I chopped the meat in food processor, added to sauteed onion/garlic, added a can of diced tomatoes, some beer I had we did not like, worchestershire sauce, salt, garlic and onion powder.  Let it cook a bit.  I crushed ritz crackers with some melted butter for a crust.  Made boxed mashed potatoes according to directions.  I laid crust, the beef mixture, the potatoes, some shredded cheese and paprika on top.  So good. The trick is to season meat to your liking.

This was very tasty. I did use lean ground beef as I didn't have lamb. I added more veggies than recipe called for, carrots, corn and peas. Next time I will make some extra meat mixture. In my 9x13 pan it seemed the meat layer was a bit thin and when potatoes added that layer was thicker. A keeper of a recipe and my Scotsman loved it.

This was sooo good, used pale ale instead of dark beer, was good that way too. Also, used a 2lb bag of frozen mixed vegetables (corn, green beans, peas, and carrots) in lieu of vegetables listed.

Honestly, this was quite good and not difficult to make.  I will try the same recipe next time with turkey or beef as my family and I thought the lamb made it too gamey.  I love lamb in Mediterranean cooking, but not with basic spices.

This recipe is a keeper. Couldn't find lamb so used ground beef and it was delicious. Best shepherds pie I've ever had.

Excellent when made with kangaroo mince! The strong flavours complement the gamey taste of the meat. Replace sour cream with yogurt and leavev out cream cheese for a lighter potato topping.

When I made it, I usually exclude the tomatoes and egg yolk but it is always a big hit when entertaining or just a quiet evening between me and my boyfriend

My family loves this dish!  I've made it only twice, but my children keep asking, so I'm going to have to make it again soon!  I do use my regular mashed potatoes and Guinness Drought for the beer.

My husband is from Aberdeen, and he loved it! The beer 'gravy'' really makes the dish.

I won't eat lamb in America because I can't get past the 'gaminess' taste.  However I absolutely love this recipe and I even bought lamb to use in it!  It's the only way I can eat it! Finally!  This is a great recipe and everyone loved it!  Even the kids!  Try it and you will love it!

having made this for 40 plus years I can truthfully say it's the best! 
Very authentic recipe and almost verbatim what I have cooked. WELL WORTH THE TROUBLE.

It didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping and was a lot of work.

My husband and I made this for dinner last night and served it with some crusty bread; so delicious!  We will definitely be making this one again.

This is the best Shepherd's Pie recipe ever.  I can not wait to make it again.  However, I did not use the beer (just increased the amount of water with the bouillon).  I also browned the onions in the lamb and used frozen mixed veggies instead.  This is a keeper!

Wow! This was great and I don't like lamb, shepherd pie or dark beer! I found a pound of ground lamb in my freezer for some reason and needed up use it up. The five star review got me to make this recipe. Made it excact except I doubled the veg and did the half cauliflower/ half potato thing. It's like the strong flavor of the lamb and beer, both aweful in my opion, somehow merged to make something great.

My husband said this was the best meal I've  EVER made. My picky 5 year old cleaned his plate and thanked me for making this "super yummy dinner." I grew up not caring for lamb and was hesitant to try it, but I followed the directions exactly and I was floored at the amazing flavor this dish had. Wow.  The first true 5 star recipe with no changes. Thank you so much!!

This was so good. I have 2 small kids who are very picky eaters. They actually ate it as leftovers. That's no joke.

Followed recipe with the exception of lamb... I used ground turkey instead. It's amazing how much flavor is in smoked paprika.
