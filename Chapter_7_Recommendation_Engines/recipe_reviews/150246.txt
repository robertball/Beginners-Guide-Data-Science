I slivered the garlic which gave it more flavor. This could be a little more saucy. Next time I'll add some broth or stock and finish it with butter.

My family just devoured this meal, not a drop left in the pan! I did cut back on the balsamic to 1/8 cup and I added more wine and used 1/2 teaspoon of 'Better than Bullion' to the sauce. I left my steak whole and cooked it about 5-8 min. longer in the oven. I then sliced with my electric knife and served on egg noodles.  So easy to make. Will do again and again!

YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!! I left out the mushrooms (didn't have any) and added large chunks of onion. Used a sprinkle of Nature Season while cooking the meat and onions. Otherwise I followed exactly. This was delicious! The whole family liked it! I may have liked a little more sauce with the finished product, but it was not dry at all and had a delicious flavor throughout! I will use mushrooms next time...and there will certainly be a next time!!!! Thanks!!

Super! Cooked as directed, except I didn't have any shallots.  If you like medium rare or rare, limit oven time!

This was really good, though we thought the balsamic was overpowering. Next time, i would cut it in half and add some stock to increase the sauce, as others have suggested. Thanks for the recipe =)

YUM!!!!  While the steaks were keeping warm in the oven, I topped the steaks with goat cheese. I also served this with spaetzle...it soaks up the sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

Due to the fact that I'm a broke, underage college student, I used onions instead of shallots, and red wine vinegar instead of redwine, no mushrooms (my boyfriend wont eat them), and the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. I paired dinner with garlic bread, and a mixed green salad followed by black berry pie. I have to say it made for a nice meal, but way to many dishes, I will probably make it again.

This was very nice.  I did tweak it based upon previous reviews.  I added half of the balsamic and added beef stock and butter to the sauce at the end.  Thank you so much for posting.

I should have taken the advice of some of the other reviewers. The vinager was overpowering. I really did not enjoy the flavor at all. I will not be making this recipe again.

This was delicious.  My husband is a steak lover and he raved over this.  I have made it several times now and it has become our favorite recipe for steak.  I use an iron skillet.  They are much better to cook steakes than any I have tried.  Thanks, Oma

Really good. Wasn't too overpowering and I'm a fan of mushrooms. The steaks weren't that tender, but we'll try a different cut next time and see if that's better. But I will make this again.

A lot thinner sauce than I anticipated, and the steaks weren't medium rare like we prefer--but it was so delicious and the steaks were so tender that we loved it. Ate it too quickly to stop and take a pic. :)

I like this recipe! It was simple, easy to follow and made great use of an under-used, under-estimated cut of beef.
I did take the advice of some previous reviewers and reduced the vinegar to 1/8th cup. I also used equal parts of both regular balsamic and white balsamic.
For seasoning I love thyme with mushrooms! I added 2 TEAS. of Dried Thyme for just a bit more fullness, and I also minced the garlic instead of leaving the cloves whole.
A very good recipe that I will make again!

Very easy, fast, and delicious! I used round steak, so it cooked quickly, and onions instead of shallots. I also followed other recommendations and used more wine and less vinegar. Definitely will make again!

My first time with a flank steak.  We enjoyed this meal very much.  I added rice and asparagus to round out the meal and would definitely make it again.
