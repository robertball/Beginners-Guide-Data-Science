I dried the pineapple, and that was great!  The rest of the soup was easy to put together.  I used cashew milk instead of cream, and had a creamy smooth texture with bits of vegetables.  This is a marvellous soup! Next time, I will make my own peanut butter for this soup!

I'm having a tea for some ladies and wanted to serve a different soup. I made this and really really like it, but it is to heavy for a ladies tea. I will find a lighter one for that, but I will be making this again for a cold snowy day!
