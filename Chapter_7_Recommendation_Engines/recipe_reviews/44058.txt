the other reviewers are right... if you use just the 3 ingredients for the dough it will definitely be lacking. add 1 cup of powdered sugar and it will come out fine.

I made a few changes to the recipe....I added some coconut to the preserves and rolled the dough out in sugar.
Instaed of making small circles....I made 4 big ones and cut the dough in wedges...than rolled it up into little cresents.
It looks a lot better that way and the sugar adds just enough sweetness....plus they bake up better....no raw dough taste.

I was skeptical at first.  But these were very easy and tasted great.  I used seedless black raspberry jam and they turned out great.

These are great cookies. Just like mom used to make. The outside is light and flaky, and if rolled in the powdered sugar they are slightly sweet.  I loved the apricot filling. Make sure the dough is cold or else it will turn gooey in your hand.  If it turns gooey just put the dough back in the frig for a half hour. They take time to make but it is worth it.

I was determined to make a jam cookie for Christmas this year and I was lured to this recipe by the short list of ingredients. I added about a 1/2 cup of sugar to the dough and I used strawberry jam.

I also brushed the tops of the pockets with an egg washed and sprinkled them with sugar before baking.

It tastes really good!!! But I couldn't get the jam to stay inside the dough pockets. It would leak out no matter how well they were sealed. I ended up making little quarter-sized cookies topped with jam. 

I think this would be a great recipe for tartlets, though, and I will try that in the future.

Thank you, thank you, thank you J. Wagner for this AWESOME recipe!  I don't know why others had so much difficulty or dislikes in the "taste" of this cookie.  I follow the directions as is and w/no addition of sugar to the dough...and they are the BEST I have tasted to date.  This cookie makes it to my Christmas Cookie Bake- Off every year without fail.  I mail my homemade cookies to my sisters who are out of state; and this is one cookie they always request.  The only suggestion I would add is that you really need to make sure the dough is totally chilled before you start to roll the dough in your hands, otherwise the butter in the the dough just melts away in your hands.  And that should do the trick!  Once again, I couldn't tell you what a delicious and tasty cookie this recipe makes.  Wish I could give it 10 stars...Thank you J. Wagner!!!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars, because these tasted great, but I had to add a cup of powdered sugar like another reviewer suggested. As long as you do that they will taste AMAZING!

I thought these were great!  After reading the reviews, the changes I made were butter instead of margarine and I added 1/2 cup of sugar - it would have been too bland otherwise.  Also, the turnover method, although messy and not as pretty looking is better tasting, but having a circular cookie and indent it to fill various jam flavors is a great and easier method, apricot is still the best choice.  This is a time consuming recipe though - at least while watching young kids at the same time.

These cookies are not as they appear in the picture.  They are closed to keep as much preserves inside as possible.  Many people added powdered sugar to the ingredients but they are rolled in powdered sugar twice which usually adds enough sweetness for most people's tastes, however, to each his own.  Be sure to roll them twice though.  I'm not sure if I put that in the recipe.  J.Wagner

Cookies are a little slippery, you could almost want to eat them with a spoon. Taste is excellent.

This recipe makes perfect kolachky's. The dough can be tricky to work with, so be sure to keep it well chilled during the assembly process. Try to not over-mix or over-roll it. This will help to maintain the flakey, fluffy texture.

This recipe was excellent!  I did add 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the dough.  The flavor and texture were great!  I used Smucker's apricot preserves, very tasty.  Everyone who tried them said they were awesome!  I will definitely be making these often, thank you for another great recipe on this site!

Excellent cookies. I actually signed up for an account just to review these. A lot of people have hit the nail on the head by saying that they need to be lightly rolled in flour before being pressed. I used some lemon zest in my apricot preserves, and I think that really added some POP to the cookie. We experimented with orange preserves with dark chocolate melts on top, but were disappointed with the results.  Thanks for the recipe! We'll use it again

I used strawberry preserves instead of apricot, but the cookies were very good. I thought it was a little dry at first, and I had to sprinkle regular granulated sugar on them for lack of the right ingredients. My family wasn't real impressed, but I liked them and will make them again!
