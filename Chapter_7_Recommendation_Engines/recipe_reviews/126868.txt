Easy and delicious recipe!  Great flavor and texture. This was my first time making biscotti, and it turned out great, even though I was in a rush and wasn't able to bake it for the entire time.  Other than that, I followed the original recipe, with no modifications.  My mom took the biscotti to a ladies' tea, and it received excellent reviews.
I will definitely be making this again!
