This is my favorite soup, it is the most delicious soup ever! My mom neighbor used to make this for me all the time and I always wondered how it is made. Now I have found this recipe. It is tried and true, easy and very hearty, thank you for sharing this!

I cooked the recipe as noted.  However, I also placed less lemon juice in, approximately 1/4 cup.  I also added cumin to taste. When the soup was placed in the dishes, I also served the soup with graded parmesan cheese.  A really good and healthy soup!

I didn't have everything necessary, but wanted to use my orange chard before I lost it.  I cut the recipe in half, added two heaping cups of chard, used 1/2 cup of elbows in place of potatoes, juice of one lemon and about 1 tsp of garlic.  It came out wonderful!  Would try it again according to recipe.  Love the lemon in it.

Wow!  So good.  Do not add cumin.  Decrease the lemon to 3/4 cup.  Has a great lemony flavor.

Very delicious, easy to make & super healthy. I put a little less lemon juice and lemon zest instead. Reminds me a bit of greek avolomeno soup. Glad to have a new chard recipe!

A really hearty and flavorful soup.  I added some vegetable bouillon, cumin, and smoked paprika, but really the lemon flavor is so dominant that I couldn't really taste those extra spices.  But I love lemon flavor, so for me using the full cup of lemon juice worked.  I may use less potato next time or dice them smaller, but this is a nice and easy soup.

A very delicious and easy to prepare soup that doesn't take too long to make. I did add cumin and pepper and used 3/4 cup of lemon juice instead of 1 cup. I will definitely make this again but may try it with even less lemon juice.

Very mediocre. Overcooked kale, and lemon garlic not a great soup flavor. I only used a few tablespoons lemon juice.  Might make again but would use broth, more spices, less lemon. Rice or

Unfortunately, even though this soup had so many good reviews, and I enjoyed the substance of it (lentils, chard, etc.), the broth was not a favourite of our family. My children especially. For all of us, the problem was the lemon flavour - even though we reduced the lemon to 1/2 cup. In the end, in order to use the leftovers, I had to add more than 2 cups of beef broth and I think that beef broth or veg. broth would have been a better choice of broth for my family. I don't agree that the potatoes should be reduced. The amount was fine.

This is one of my favourite soups. I add cilantro with the lemon and garlic and I use 2 bunches of red Swiss chard and more water to start with. I also donâ€™t add that much lemon. Prob only 1 lemon (add slowly, taste it to make sure) and then each person can add more to their bowl if they prefer it to have more lemon.

I've made this recipe several times.  I love it as it is but over time I've also made my own tweaks: This recipe is just as good with kale if chard isn't available.  I add about 1/4 cup of short grain rice at the same time as I put in the potatoes. When stirring in the carrots, I also add 1 bay leaf, 1tsp ground cumin,  1tsp ground culantro, 1/2tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1/2tsp ground tumeric and 1/4tsp cayenne pepper.  At the end of cooking, right after turning off the soup,  I stir in about 1/2 cup minced cilantro.

Terrific soup!  I added a bit of cumin and ran a little short on the lemon but it was still like the lemony, garlic-y lentil soup I grew up eating.

This recipe was SO GOOD. I tried it because I happened to have chard on hand  and because my family likes the lemon-garlic sauce that goes on Shwarma - the ingredients in this reminded me of that.  I am SO glad that used the full cup of lemon. I thought it was going to be too much, but it was perfect. Strong lemon-y flavor, but not overpowering. I also had only orange lentils and two potatoes so I used what I had.  I did add some cumin because I wanted a little more flavor, but I don't really know that it added anything. It was just yummy. Like another review said, this recipe is worth the risk.

Absolutely obsession-inducing! Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients... until you add the lemon, garlic and olive oil the soup smells like compost but then, oh wonder, it becomes the most amazing thing ever! I ate the entire recipe in two days, no joke. I crave it now. Off to buy more chard.

Loved the flavors, better after a day to two, but be careful, it smells up the house.
