I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012.  It is a beautiful dessert but just a little dry.  A strawberry glaze would solve that.  A nice way to showcase summer berries.

Excellent recipe.  The whipped cream was great with the cream cheese.  I made this into a cake using an angel food cake.  Cut it in half and put the strawberries in the middle with some cream.  Frosted the rest of the cake with the whipped cream and added half strawberries on top.  A big hit for my moms birthday!!

This was delish!  Me and husband loved the cheesecake flavor it had, I would rename this 'Strawberry cheesecake shortcake.'  Another review said it was a little dry, so I added 1/3 cup(ish) of strawberry preserves to the strawberries, and instead of gently mashing them as the recipe suggests, I pulverized them until it was nice and juicy. I ended up not having any powdered sugar or vanilla on hand, I used a little honey to sweeten it up.  I also didn't layer it in a bowl, just used a cake pan with less amount of layers.  If you have the patience, let it sit overnight in the fridge to really let the layers blend, because it was definitely better the 2nd day.  Give this one a try!

This is a highly variable recipe. Our local grocery makes their angel food cake cloyingly sweet, so please add more sugar to the whipped cream cheese or strawberries if it needs more sweetness. I also don't go too crazy with mashing the strawberries because this is a dish I make for picnics and I don't want it getting all soggy while it sits. I would definitely pulverize a good portion of the strawberries if I was digging in immediately. I'm glad people are enjoying my concoction.

This is a delicious summertime treat, especially when strawberries are fresh and abundant, so I used all fresh berries.  The cream cheese adds a depth and richness to the whipped cream and makes it a little less sweet which made it better to me, but you might want to play with the sugar amounts if you want something sweeter.  I sprinkled Amaretto on my cake layers and then added almond slices toasted in butter to the top layer of the strawberries and cream for some crunch and additional flourish.

Good combo! Next time I will add more sugar, as I felt  the whipped cream wasn't quite sweet enough. I layered this with cubed angel food cake and sliced strawberries for a nice change of pace over a slice of angel food topped with strawberries an whipped cream.

I had trouble combining the cream cheese with the Cream.I followed the directions TO THE LETTER! But when it came time to combine the two? I ended up with one big curdles mess. I thought maybe one of the ingredients was overdue/bad, but I checked all ingredients and all were good. I also went over my step by step procedure and I STILL can't figure out where I went wrong! There was no way I could serve this to my guests, but THANKFULLY I had 2 tubs of cool whip in the fridge. I layered that instead. Anyone else have this problem?

I saw on another trifle recipe to slice the angel food cake in thirds.  I would think it made it easier to spread the whipped cream cheese on a flat layer instead of cubes.  I also sprinkled blueberries on top of the blended strawberry mixture.  And I kept the last fourth of the whipped cream cheese to add a dollop when serving and added strawberry slices to make a nice presentation.
