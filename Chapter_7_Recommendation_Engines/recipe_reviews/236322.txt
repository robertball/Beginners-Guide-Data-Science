Made this for my fiance and I after trying other recipes for Italian beef and this one is our favorite. I toasted the buns before topping them with the meat and broth, kept the rolls from getting soggy. Then popped them back in the oven with a slice of provolone before topping with the giardiniera.  We will definitely be making these again!

Great taste!  Very close to the Chicago beef I know and love; the shredded meat was a little different. Next time I will try in a crock pot because meat didn't fall apart easily.
Update:  Crock pot version much easier!  I skipped the browning and just put whole roast and all spices in crock pot and let it cook on low all day.  Meat fell apart as I was taking it out of the corckpot.

I grew up eating the real deal from my uncle's restaurant in Chicago. This is a bit different but it is simply delicious. It's good with provolone cheese melted on it though I prefer it plain. I used my homemade giardiniera and next summer during pepper season I'm going to can extra just to use in this recipe!  Thanks, Chef John!

This is exactly the way I made this last summer with a different recipe.......only difference was the vegetables......my other recipe didn't call for any but it was so very awesome......so now I'm addicted to this sandwich.......to me and my dear hubby.......there's no other sandwich in the world that even comes close to the quality of this one.....I have just started experimenting with fresh herbs and spices......and like I said there's no comparison ! This wonderful sandwich just melts in your mouth.......try it sometime......I promise you won't be disappointed :) Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe :)

My husband raved and raved while eating these sandwiches.  I used the hot giardiniera recipe on this website instead of store bought giardiniera and it was fabulous.  My husband said it was too good of a recipe not to invite others over for it as a meal, but it might be a little too messy to serve to company. Tasted great, but very messy. Have lots of napkins nearby.

Browned roast as directed, but then used crockpot to cook the meat. We really liked the flavors of the sauce, however, it was on the salty side.  Maybe the buillion I used was salty to begin with? I will be making this recipe again, but omitting the salt. I also think I would recommend straining the dipping sauce before using, as the first few dips tasted way stronger because all the floating spices stuck to the sandwich.

Like some others I made the meal as directed but browned the beef then cooked meal in the slow cooker. I used less salt as well. It was delicious; my girlfriend and I happily had it for lunch and dinner the day after. We will also be doing this with roasted peppers next time instead of pickled vegetables as we did not like the giardiniera at all.

This was just fantastic.I live south side Chicago (N IN) and i have to tell you this is the bomb.I have made many beef sandwich recipes in my day but this one has the best flavor of theme all.i just eyed the ingredients and used better than bullion for the chicken stock.and cut it down to 2 cups.and maybe a little bit more on the red pepper flakes.AAA

As an "inspired" dish this is pretty good!  But definitely NOT what you'd get at a Chicago institution like Al's beef or something similar. I did it exactly like you did but would probably do it in a slow cooker next time. The gravy was delicious and the seasoning was spot on! But needs to be done in the oven and sliced on a slicer before soaking in gravy to be 100%.

I followed this recipe loosely.  And while it is not the real deal, it's pretty good.  I used to work at a great Italian Beef stand when I was in High school, and this recipe is pretty close seasoning wise.  I did not brown the roast first.  Not necessary.  I mixed all the sauce ingredients, and tossed the roast in my slow cooker.  Then let it cook 7-8 hours on low.  The meat was falling apart and tender.  Very tasty.  I did question using Chicken broth with a Beef roast.  A bit odd.  So I used Beef stock.  and I added some onions to the pot, too.  The result was tasty and a good stand in when you can't actually be IN Chicago.

Tried this recipe as a way to use up leftover chuck roast - it was excellent!  My meat was already cooked obviously, but I reheated it in the chicken broth w/ vinegar & spices, and used the pickled veggies.  Also added a slice of melted muenster cheese which my husband loved.  Will definitely make again!!!

Very good! I cooked it in the pressure cooker and only used 1 tsp oregano. Didn't use giardiniera because we don't care for it, but added roasted red peppers and provolone cheese to the sandwich. Some family members even added garlic aioli to the sandwich. Very tasty! Will definitely make again!

Good attempt at Chicago Style but beef broth must replace chicken broth and real Italians use soy sauce not vinegar. :Being from Chicago, I was not offended by the way the meat was cut, but many here insist on thin sliced.

OMG new favorite sandwich!  I read a couple recipes on this site for Italian beef sandwiches... I stuck most closely to this recipe as I trust Chef John but I did incorporate advice from several other recipes! I cut up two 3-lb chuck roasts into 2" chunks, seared in olive oil with 2 packets of dry Italian salad dressing. When meat was browned, I added a head of chopped garlic, 6-cups of chicken broth (6-cups water, 5-cubes), 1-tsp oregano, 2-tsp basil, 2-tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2-tsp pepper, and 1/2-tsp salt. Brought this to a boil then allowed it so simmer uncovered on low, stirring occasionally, for about 4-5 hours. I removed the meat chunks with a slotted spoon. The meat pulled apart easily as the taste was insanity!!! The remaining au jus was perfection. I jazzed up my hogies by spreading prepared horseradish on one side (under the meat) and fresh garlic butter on the top half. I loaded up the horseradish side with my shredded beef followed by roasted red peppers, thick slices of mozzarella cheese, and sliced peperonici peppers. Broiled the opened sandwiches for 2-minutes (until cheese melted and garlic butter bubbled), then served with a bowl of the beef jus for dipping. Wow. Just WOW.  Very salty but well worth it.

I took some liberties with this recipe and used what I had on hand. Instead of making it as a sandwich filling, I made this as a meal served over garlic mashed potatoes. I also substituted venison stew meat, and cooked it in the slow cooker. I browned the meat, put that in the slow cooker; then browned some onions, garlic, and sliced mushrooms.  Deglazed the pan with a little white wine and balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar. Poured that all into the slow cooker; added the broth, thyme rosemary, salt, pepper, bay leaf, a little paprika and oregano. I let that cook on high for a couple hours, then turned it to low to let it finish for a few hours more. About 1 1/2 hours before it was done, I threw in some diced green pepper. This was really delicious and different. I liked the little tang that the vinegar added, and it really covered up the game-y flavor that this particular venison had.  Easy to make in the slow cooker for tender, fall apart meat--even if it's a tough cut. Thank you Chef John!

Sorry Chef John, it just didn't do it for me. The ciabatta rolls, vinegar, and chicken broth are just not right. 
Next time I'll try the seasonings but use crusty, toasted sub or hoagie buns, no vinegar, and beef stock.

while this simmers I add a jar of pepperoncini that I have sliced including the liquid.  Stems removed.  Also I slowly add salt to taste.
