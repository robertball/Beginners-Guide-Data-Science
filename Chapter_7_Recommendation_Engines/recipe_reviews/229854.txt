What a blend of great flavors.  I needed a larger pan, so did meat, mushrooms and basil in one and and carmelized the onions and peppers in the other, combined for last couple of minutes to blend the flavors.

Oh my! I wish the photo I posted of this recipe did it justice :( This is wonderful. It is less complicated than it looks though I will prep the ingredients in advance next time.....and there will be a next time. I did forget to add the mushrooms and next time I will skip the anchovy, but it is definitely a hardy & tasty meal on a cold winter night. Get things going early in the day and this will be done in a jif at dinnertime. Thanks so much for sharing:)

Phenomenal sandwich.  Best I've ever made.  Only thing wrong with the recipe is that you've gotta use a toasted bun, and I would suggest getting a good chibata bun.

Absolutely delicious sandwich. Couldn't find tri-tip steak so used  sirloin tips instead. I've made this three times in lessthan 6 months, my husband puts this at the top of his favorites. My only complaints are that it is time consuming to prepare and it is always too soupy. I drained off about 1 cup of drippings after cooking the steak and at least another cup at the end. My wine NEVER evaporates as the recipe states. Even with these cons, it's worth it!

This was FABULOUS.  What a flavour!  One of the best sandwiches I have ever made.  I used parmesan bread as I didn't have any rolls and toasted it, sensational.  It was so good I forgot to take a photo.  Must be why there is only one...everyone is too busy eating!

Everyone of the sandwiches this guy creates look incredible, and taste even better. Not a cheap sandwich, but well worth every penny. Love the videos from this guy,put him on tv!
