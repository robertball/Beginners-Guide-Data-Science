Excellent!  I doubled the recipe....and rather than using chili seasoning....I used separate spices- chili powder, cayenne pepper,cumin, red pepper flakes, and some Franks' Red Hot sauce.  I also added a little corn starch and water at the end to thicken it up a bit.

It's fantastic!! I  too, only used one chili seasoning packet and it's perfect! I also added some garlic powder and a little pepper and paprika. Good stuff!

Clean, easy & simple, love it. Hard  to say if I'll ever go back to the big pot on the stove. I generally make a double batch which fills my crock pot to the brim.

Awesome chili - very tasty and super easy! The salt issue can be easily solved by using a "no salt added" tomato sauce. I use this instead of using half the seasoning packets and it turns out great!

Very delicious. Not too heavy. I added extra tomatoes so it wasn't super thick. Like other reviews I didn't add all of the seasoning per the directions. I used about half of that amount. This only yielded 4 bowls of chili.

Slow Cooker Game Day Chili Haiku: "That's serious salt. Gotta use less seasoning, or double the rest." Two packets of chili seasoning (unless one uses a low-sodium brand) would make this entirely too salty, so I only used one - if I had used two, I would've doubled the meat and tomatoes. Anyways, I love a chili that naps in the crockpot all day, and this one was good, not award-winning, but definitely easy to put together and tasty. The baby loved it and the leftovers were eaten, so it earns stars for that.

Made this for my husband & Step Dad. They both loved it! The only change I made was I used 1 packet of the chili seasoning and added some Cayenne pepper to give it a little more heat. I also added a can of tomato paste. I have never used a slow cooker liner before, but I did this time after reading it here and it was so nice for cleaning up!

I added garlic to it, because everything is better with garlic, and it was fantastic.

I substituted 1 can of regular petit cut tomatoes for the tomatoes with green chilis.  I don't like it to be too spicy.
At the end, I added 2 Tbsp of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the broth a bit.   Needs about 1/2 tsp of salt.
Everybody loved it and clean up was a snap!

I made this today for a tree tree trimming party. it's super easy to do and the cooking instructions are spot on. I did make a few changes. Along with the ground beef, I added a pound of Italian sausage cut into bite size pieces. I also used red as opposed to white onion. about halfway through cooking, I realized it was soupier than I like.  i added another can of kidney beans and a can of chili beans. My guests loved it!

I used low sodium chili packets. I also added corn and black beans just to make it go farther. I have a large family.Everyone loved it. They cleaned out the pot!

I have made this now three times.  Now I am using venison for the meat.  And I have tried swapping the tomato sauce for paste and I believe the tomato paste makes it taste better.

I made it as described except I  added one minced jalape√±o pepper. I also  made it with the sour cream and cheese options.

All four of us agreed it was quite literally the best chili we've ever had.
