I really didn't care for these. I guess I'm just used to Mexican quesadillas, which do not include an egg batter dip. Not even my granddaughter liked them. We both took 1 bite and then threw them in the trash.

Yum, yum,  yum  yum!  A cross between a chili rellenos and a crispy taco.  I served these with the green sauce as recommended,  beans, salad with avocado.   Make sure everything is ready to roll before you start dipping and frying. They don't take long at all to cook.   Tip: warm the tortillas before filling and folding.

So easy, and so good! I was looking for something to do with queso fresco and almost skipped right over this recipe, but the whimsical photo drew me in for a second look. I served with salsa verde and chopped tomatoes. Thank you, Maria Pereira, I will be making these again.
