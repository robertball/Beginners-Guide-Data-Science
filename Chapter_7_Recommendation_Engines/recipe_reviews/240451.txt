Loved this! This recipe taste very much like the famous P@y D@y bar...only fresh and yummier. The asembly couldn't have been easier but it did stick to the pan. Next time I will line the pan with wax paper. I will also double the amount of salted dry roasted peanuts to have good coverage of the yummy center. Any peanuts that don't stick to the mixture could easily be kept for a future use. This makes alot so it was great for my holiday trays! Thanks so much for sharing!

I just made these for the first time, I cut the condensed milk in half and they came out perfect.  What I would do next time is line the pan with wax paper coated with a non stick spray.  Mine stuck a bit to the wax paper.  To speed up the marshmallows melting put the bowl into the the micro for 10-20 seconds then continue stirring.  Also I used a bit smaller size pan, one jar of peanuts was plenty to cover the top and bottom.  I sprinkled kosher salt onto top before adding the top layer of peanuts. Mine had to chill for about 3 hours before cutting nicely.  Super delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Love a Fast and Easy recipe like this. Perfect at Christmas-time and for Super-Bowl! just combined the ingredients, microwaved and poured it over the nuts spread on a Parchment lined pan. then covered again with more nuts. press in, & cool.  easy to lift out and cut into perfect squares.

OMG, these are going on my list of reasons for living.  They are soooooooo yummy!  I made them for an office birthday treat, and they went fast.  Not too chewy, not too soft - I only used half of the sweetened condensed milk in mine.  To make sure they wouldn't stick to the pan, I sprayed my glass dish down with butter flavored cooking spray.  Worked like a charm.

Once I spread the peanuts in the bottom, however, I noticed that I used more than half of the jar.  Instead of running out to buy more nuts, I rummaged through my pantry and found cashew halves & pieces and used them as a mix with the peanuts - SO AWESOME.  Like another reviewer, I also sprinkled a little sea salt on the top of the goo mix before adding the last half of the nuts.  Took me maybe 10 minutes to make one pan.  Great recipe!

good flavor, however, needs more peanuts. Way too much soft goo. Even after refrigerating over night, still soft and messy. Taste good though. I think it may need twice the peanuts.

I agree with another review....way too much soft goo.  I am a seasoned baker and I don't understand how this recipe can be given 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It stuck to the waxed paper and as the other reviewer stated.  Even after spending the night in the fridge, it was still a pile of goo.  I now have it in a pot on top of the stove to melt.  I will try to  think of something to add to it to give it the strength to be able to be cut into squares when cool.

Too gooey. I will experiment with this, but I think half the amount of sweetened condensed milk would be about right.

Yummy and does taste just like the candy bar! Love the easy microwave directions, and it does take some stirring for the marshmallows to melt. Will definitely make again!

I have made these for 2 years in a row for 
a Christmas cookie drive for the school and these bars are always a hit! My grandma used to make bars similar but I dont have her recipe. These are nostalgic for me when I make them.

Following orginal recipe was a mess, was too gooey and runny. I halved the sweetened condensed milk, used 15 oz peanut butter chips, much more peanuts, and melted everything together on the stovetop for a while to get the sugars hot enough to set. I also put some leftover unmelted marshmallows on the first peanut layer to give the bars a more traditional look. Came out great the second time with these adjustments.

Directions are good, however I could not get butter/ condensed milk mixture warm enough to melt marshmallows. I added more peanuts to both bottom and top.

I substituted caramel chips fo the peanut butter ones. Turned out great. I would have taken a picture but they didn't last long enough. (I think I ate most of them). I would either use more peanuts or smaller baking dish.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except that I used a smaller pan (I don't think this is enough for a 9"x13" pan--I used an 11"x7") and only half of the can of condensed milk.  I put a layer of parchment paper in the pan first and sprayed it with nonstick spray, put it in the fridge overnight and it came out great.  Set up nicely with a nougat texture, and tasted really good.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the recipe calls for an entire can of condensed milk, and I can see where that would make way too much nougat for the amount of peanuts it asks for.  All of the other measurements were good though, and I would definitely make these again.

I have made this three times now. I microwave 15 seconds at a time extra to help stir and break down the marshmallows. I also increased those to three cups. I didnâ€™t like it with extra peanuts as recommended by another review but thatâ€™s just preference. Absolutely loved this recipe. Itâ€™s easy and I recommend you sprinkle with a little sea salt. They are better  after a few hours in the refrigerator but so yummy and definitely a keeper. Enjoy
