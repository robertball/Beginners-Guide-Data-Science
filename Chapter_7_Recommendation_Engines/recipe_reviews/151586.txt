Chicken was very tender & good. I changed it up a little - instead of sprinkling the cheese on top after it was cooked, I put cheese on top and baked for another 5 minutes so that the cheese melted on top. I also served with rice instead of pasta.

This is a fast and easy dinner - to simplify I use a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce and add the mozzarella for the last 10 minutes until melted. I also have breaded the chicken breasts first.

I pounded the breasts just a little before placing in the baking dish. I baked it for 20 minutes, added the mozzarella, and baked another 5 minutes. The chicken was perfectly cooked, but I think it would taste much better if you substitute spaghetti sauce or even tomato sauce seasoned with italian seasoning and garlic rather than the tomato soup. The soup is too sweet and I didn't care for the flavor.

Im not a good cook at all. thought this recipe was easy and simple until i started cooking after 20 minutes i thought it was done and was ready to dig it..but it wasnt even close to being done. i love recipes with the exact directions so i dont have to guess at times.

I made this tonight and it was great.  The chicken was very moist.  I wish I knew how I could have made the soup mixture a little thicker.

Yummy! I made this dish last night. I altered the recipe just  a little using some pasta sauce and adding some additional mushrooms and garlic. Made some colorful penne pasta on the side, adding just a bit of olive oil,pepper, parmesan and drizzled what was left of the sauce in the baking dish over it. Served asparagus as my veggie. I added a little butter and low sodium soy sauce together and drizzled that very sparingly over the asparagus. Delish!

I was afraid it would be a bit bland, so I added garlic salt to the chicken. I thought it was fine, but my husband truly enjoyed it.
