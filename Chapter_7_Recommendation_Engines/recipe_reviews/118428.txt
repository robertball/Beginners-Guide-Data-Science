This is the best tuna noodle casserole that I have ever made/tried!  I did make some modifications, though and I hate to give a recipe 5 stars if I changed it, but it was really, really good.  Instead of the green pepper, I added red bell pepper because that is what I had on hand and I like the taste/color that it adds.  I added a cup of peas, a little extra cheese (about 1/4 cup because I eyeballed it), and a little extra salt on accident (I read the recipe incorrectly).  I was afraid that it would be too salty, but it wasn't.  I would recommend the salt quantity that the recipe calls for, though.  I also added light mayonnaise.  I was really afraid to add the light mayo because the recipe specifically states that it doesn't work well with light mayo, but it seemed fine to me.  I only added about 1/4 cup, though because that was all that I had left!  Oh, I also used albacore tuna because I think it has less of a "fishy" taste (I know!  Tuna Noodle Casserole and I wanted less of a fishy taste!).  All in all, this was a really good recipe and I will definitely make this again.  I agree with Becky, Florence is a really good cook to make Tuna Noodle Casserole taste this good.

As this is a working day, I made this ahead of time so all I have to do when I get home is preheat the oven. I used red pepper instead of green, butter instead of oil, extra sharp cheddar cheese, I doubled the amount of tuna and I halved the mayonnaise and used sour cream in it's place. Because I have it, I sprinkled a small can of French's french fried onions over the top. With any tuna casserole, it's always quick to prepare nevermind economical and filling. Good fall meal.

This is great tuna casserole! I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 casserole so I added 5 minutes to cooking time. Pimentos are not our thing so left them out. Easy recipe that is definitely a keeper! Thanks

Yum! Loved this recipe, will keep this as our standard tuna casserole. Made slight changes: Used only 1/2 c celery and increased green peppers to 1/2 c. Added 1 T dijon mustard and 1 T white wine to the soup mixture. Only used 1/2 c milk and reduced mayo to 1/4 c and added 1/4 sour cream when mixing all the ingredients together.  My husband had 3 servings!

I'm not usually a canned tuna kinda gal, but this recipe worked out fantastically and the fishy taste isn't present at all! I made this the other night and my boyfriend ate half the 8x8" pan himself! The only changes I made were I did not include the last 3 ingredients listed [I didn't have two of them & don't like to add salt if I can help it], and once I had the mixture in the pan I sprinkled it w/more cheddar cheese and topped it off with some French's fried onions. It turned out FANTASTICALLY and was gone by lunchtime the next day ;) 

Oh! And I only had cream of celery soup, and that worked out just fine, too. Great for wintertime comfort food!

Very best tuna noodle casserole I have tried.  Added mushrooms and changed mayo to salad dressing for a little different twist.  Also didn't have pimentoes, so used stuffed green olives.
Florrence is an awesome cook in my book, to make an everyday dish so tasty.

This recipe was a great start for my creation that turned out to be the best tuna noodle casserole I've ever had!!! I did make several adjustments because I had different items on hand. I followed most of what is here but in place of the celery and green pepper I used a full package of frozen mixed veggies. Along with sauteeing the onion, I added 2 minced garlic cloves. Once done with that I poured in the mixed veggies which I had steamed in the microwave. In the sauce/soup mixture I added a tsp of stone ground mustard, about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, half the salt and about 1/4 tsp black pepper. I really like medium or sharp cheddar so that's what I used and I added about 1/3 cup more than the recipes calls for. I also left out the pimientos. I had no tuna on hand so I substituted with canned salmon which is a little healthier and tastes better anyway. Lastly I crunched up about a half a package of saltine crackers and stirred in 2 tbsp margarine to sprinkle on the top for a crispy buttery crust. It turned out amazing! Perfect amount of moisture too, the noodles didn't dry out at all. So easy and I will definately be making this one again soon.

My husband really enjoys old fashioned tuna noodle casserole and loved the flavors of the vegetables in this variation.  I added some peas to it also and it added another texture.

I prepared this for dinner last night and really enjoyed it. I didn't add the pimentos since I didn't have any on hand but next time I make this I will surely add them. The celery, onion and green pepper were a nice change of pace from the peas that so many recipes call for (although they could be added quite nicely if desired). I will definintely make this again.

This was SO good. I took a few suggestions from other reviewers and added a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a tablespoon of white wine to the sauce. My kids LOVED it.

Just like I remember as a kid... Minor modifiactions. I didnt use green peppers or pimentos but I added 1 cup of peas. Little garlic powder with the onion saute. 1/2 the mayo (and I used light).  split 1/2 cheese to use for the top and I topped with buttered breadcrumbs (cant have it without it!).  It was delicous.

This turned out just like I remember my mother making when I was little! I made a couple of changes: I didn't include pimientos. I used Campbell's "cream of wild mushroom" soup. I added 1bsp of cream cheese to the sauce as well as  squirt of dijon mustard and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Oh, and lots of minced garlic! I made a crusty topping like for my baked macaroni: 1/4 cup panko crumbs in 1/4 cup melted butter with 1tbsp dried parsley and salt and pepper, sprinkled on top before baking. GREAT results!

Love this recipe!!  I've been making tuna noodle casserole for years but this just tastes a little different and it's awesome!  I really think adding the veggies and the mayo is what makes it different.  I do add peas to mine.

Really didn't think I'd like this much because I'm not a fan of peppers or onions, but trying to get my boyfriend to eat more fish.  Surprisingly, I really liked it, even had seconds!  Followed the recipe exactly except no pimentos.  Oh- and my boyfriend finished the entire rest of the casserole himself in one sitting and still wanted more!  Definitely will made this again.

Made a few changes to this delicious recipe. Used red bell pepper, added 1 cup frozen peas, olive oil, fat free half & half, sharp cheddar cheese, three 3 oz cans of albacore tuna, omitted the pimiento and light mayo all topped off with French fried onions. So yummy!

We absolutely Loved this tuna Casserole!
However, I did make a few changes...When I sauted the Vegetables I added some pepper in with them. Instead of the Cream of mushroom soup I only had cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and I think this is even better then just the plain old mushroom soup. I did add just a little more than what it called for on the cheese. I only had Miracle Whip, So I used 1/2 cup of it and a good dollop of Sour Cream and mixed it in.  I try my best not to use extra salt in my food, but I believe this is one of those recipes when you NEED that little extra bit of salt - So use that 1/2tspn of salt. I did not use the Pimientos, that's just not our thing. Lastly, When mixing everything together in the Bowl, I added about a teaspoon of parsely & 3/4cup of frozen peas...& MMM Did the peas really bring some flavor & more texture into this! 
Baked for 30minutes & My family is very happy with this recipe. Something different and cheap to make to! Will Make Again!

Absolutely adored this recipe, one of the best tuna casseroles I've ever had. I took the recommendation of other posters and added white wine and dijon mustard, so delish which really added the perfect kick bit of flavour. No pimentos since I don't keep them around and I'm not fond. MAKE THIS.

I was pleasantly surprised that something as simple as tuna casserole could turn out so satisfying.  Here are my changes (due to necessity or taste): added chopped black olives instead of pimentoes; large macaroni instead of egg noodles; no green pepper; added garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, seaseoned salt, and some lemon juice.  I just cooked the noodles and while they were draining used the same pot to cook all the other ingredients before putting in the oven.  Don't leave out the breadcrumbs, they are a great addition!

Delish! My boyfriend ate half himself- I added a can of peas and changed the mayo to 1/4 cup with 1/4 cup of sour cream. I also added an additional cup of cheddar and topped with french fried onions. I don't like tuna from a can heated (too fishy), but my b/f said it was the best he has ever had. Will make again.

Really tasty tuna noodle casserole. I didn't add celery or pimento, sauteed the onion in butter not oil and topped the casserole with bread crumbs. Very easy to make and hits the spot when you want comfort food.

This was really good. I added mixed frozen veggies, some cayenne and red pepper flakes. Will be making this again.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. I follow the recipe as is, but add Tabasco and pepper to the soup/milk/cheese mixer for an extra kick and 1/4 cup frozen peas when you comibine all ingredients. The pimentos subtly complement the flavor so don’t skip them. Note: the recipe fills an 8”x8” dish. My hubby and I eat about half so be sure to double the recipe if you have more people to feed.

Wow....what a great recipe.  Followed as directed but then took a couple of other tips.  Added 1/4 cup sour cream, had to add a little more milk because I probably had a too much noodles.  Then sprinkled shredded cheese and buttered breadcrumbs on top.  It's a mix of tuna noodle and macaroni & cheese casseroles.  We loved it!   Thanks!

I've never eaten tuna casserole and probably am not going to start now lol. But I've wanted to try this for my husband for awhile now. I tweaked it a little, adding less noodles and other ingredients (about 2/3 scaled down) and added a can of tuna. I also added some pepper into the mixture and didn't bother to melt the cheese - it will melt on its own while baking. I also left out the pimentos and other veggies and added some bread crumbs and a few bits of butter to the top to form a bit of a crunchy crust.  It has all the makings of something I think my husband will like and am so pleased with how easily it all came together. Served with a small salad, not a bad weekday meal. Thanks for sharing.

Ohhhh, this is SO good!  I used to make a tuna casserole very similar to this years ago for my sons.  My oldest son particularly loved my recipe but somehow I lost it after not making it for several years.  This one is even better!  I substitute celery soup for the mushroom soup and toss in some peas and fresh, diced mushrooms.  I also add a little extra milk since the 1 cup doesn't seem quite enough (probably because of my extra ingredients) and a little onion salt.  I top it off with Progresso Italian flavored buttered breadcrumbs.  Outta this world!

I omit the green pepper and pimentos since I'm not a fan of either.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for the mayo. I barely put in a 1/4 cup. 1/2 cup would have made it too gooey in my opinion. I topped it with another thin layer of cheese, but next time I'll definitely try bread crumbs as well.

This dish was fantastic with the following changes, based on what I had on hand: used same amount of elbow macaroni, chopped a whole red bell pepper, omitted the pimento and used home-canned northwest smoked tuna!

To be fair, I gave this 4 stars because I modified this recipe to accomodate the preferences of everyone in my family.  I excluded the celery, onion, green pepper and pimientos and replaced the cream of mushroom with cream of celery soup.  I added 1 can of peas and topped the casserole with french fried onions.  It was a hit with All of Them!  My 10 year old said to tell all of you "it's really a 5!"

This recipe is a new favorite! Easy and tastes like you slaved over it! 
I omitted the green pepper and pimientos. I also used half mayo, half sour cream because I was low on mayo.

The picture does not do this justice! This recipe is exactly how my mom's tastes. I didn't put pimientos in it and I used a 1/2 cup milk (it may be too liquid if you use the whole cup) .

This was really good! Big hit with my family. The only thing I did different was I crushed up some buttery crackers and melted some butter and sprinkled on top. The extra cruch is so yummy! Definitely recommend!!

I rarely rate recipes so low, and I love tuna noodle casserole, but this was NOT good.  I normally make the kids eat everything on their plate if they want dessert (no room for dinner, no room for dessert is my motto), but I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't finish it, so I couldn't bring myself to make them finish it, too.  Threw away what was left.

I did change one thing on this recipe because I dislike pimientos. I changed it and used peas. It is a very nice creamy casserole but I thought it should have some kind of spice to jazz it up. I will keep this recipe but next time try adding some marjoram.

This was very good and I don't usually like tuna casseroles. I skipped the step of cooking the soup, milk and cheese as I didn't see why it was necessary (I just added them to the other ingredients) - turned out great anyway and saved time, since it all melts together in the oven. Added a little Old Bay seasoning and topped with a mixtures of fresh bread crumbs & parmesan cheese. Yummy!

Was amazed it all fit in an 8x8, but it did.  Would look more presentable topped with a little extra cheese.  Very good!  It was hard to stop eating it.  Delish also topped with Crystal Hot Sauce, similar to Tabasco, but better....more tang, less heat.

We're not big fans of tuna casserole but if you ever make a casserole this one shoud be it! We really enjoyed it and all teh flavors blended together nicely. I'm not much of a cook but I followed this recipe to the letter and it made me look good.

This is probably the best tuna noodle casserole I've had.  It had great flavor and depth.  I only made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of celery in place of the second can of cream of mushroom.  I also added a red pepper because I needed to use it and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of sweet relish.  This dish was rich, creamy and cheesy.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing!

Followed the recipe as written.  The family rated this as a "no do again."  It isn't a creamy tuna casserole like we are used to having.

I LOVE this recipe. I don't follow it 100% though. I skip the green peppers, instead I add onions, mushrooms and green peas. At the end I sprinkle cheese on top and finish it off with crunched up potato chips. Oh and we also make a double batch...for 2 people. We eat it for days! It's the best!!

Quite tasty.  I never add so little onion or green pepper to a dish though - it was closer to 3/4 cup bell pepper and 1 cup onion.  Didn't change anything else though.

I love this recipe...simple to make, creamy and just plain good. I prefer cream of chicken soup, often omit the celery, onion and green pepper because of time. Add 3-4 T. sour cream with mayo.

We like this recipe, I leave out the green peppers, onions and pimientos and put in about a cup of sweet pees instead. I follow the rest of the recipe as directed- although I do use the whole bag of egg noodles too.  

Its a creamier and richer version than the old campbells recipe on the back of the can. :)

Excellent recipe!  I sub'd what I had to (based on the contents of my fridge) - used green onion (same qty) instead of onion, no green pepper - 3 sliced mushrooms sub'd, 2 cans tuna albacore, no pimentos.  Lots of cheese - cubes - didn't read the part about melting in the soup (came out great anyway).   Also, didn't saute the celery onions or mushrooms - just sliced VERY thin, lowered temp by 25 degrees, increased cooking time 15 min.  At the end I topped with Panko bread crumbs, 2 tbsp butter melted and parmesan - broiled for a few minutes - FABULOUS!!!!  A REAL KEEPER - ADAPTABLE AND SOLID

Truly better than what I remember growing up!  Modifications were:  substitute homemade onion/garlic cream soup I already had on hand, no celery-green pepper-pimento-salt, two cans of albacore tuna, add 1/8c grated parm.  The base is so delicious that I think you can make any modifications and it will work.

My boyfriend and I adored this recipe. I used spiral pasta because it was what I had, and I omitted the pimientos and added a lot more salt (1/2 tsp is not nearly enough). It was easily one of my boyfriend's favorites!

this is a great basic tuna casserole recipe... very tasty. 
I made it with what I had on hand... no pimentos... no celery. It would be good with some peas thrown in. 
I put some buttered rye bread crumbs on top and broiled them for a few mins at the end. Gave an added crunch.
A good staple recipe.

I used this recipe as a guideline only as I did have my mother-in-laws' recipe so I came up with my own version.  I sauted 1 chopped onion, 1/2 green pepper & 1/2 red bell pepper & 1 cup sliced mushrooms in 1 tbsp butter...put aside.  Then made a rue (1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup flour) added 1 tsp salt & pepper to taste.  Cook the egg noodles then combined them with sauted onions/peppers/mushrooms, 1 cup frozen peas, 3 cans drained flaked tuna.  Mix well, heat and serve.  I was going to make a crumb crust on top using ritz crackers & melted butter suggested by another reviewer but didn't have the ritz crackers...sounds good though.

Next time I will make Florences' recipe as she has it...but this time round my husband wanted his moms dish for his home birthday dinner but I couldn't help but add my own touch.  That and I didn't have all the ingredients listed here.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 star up until I actually try it then will change my rating if the families' all thumbs up with it.  It does sound pretty good!

This was really good!  I sprinkled some fried onions (the ones in a can) and cheddar on top and stuck it in the oven just to melt the cheese.  There were no leftovers.

To make this faster I used half a bag of frozen veggies and I added some canned shrooms instead of the sauteed veggies. I added some lemon juice and dijon mustard to the cheese sauce. Sprinkled some potato chip crumbs on top because I had some crumbs left in a bag. LOVED the tang from the mayo. Will make this again with french fried onions on top next time.

This was very good Tuna Casserole. I did make a few changes; I used a mix of yellow, orange and red pepper because that is what I had in the freezer. I also used Cream of Chicken b/c I didnt have any Cream of Mushroom soup. I used butter instead of oil to saute the veggies. and I did not have any pimentos so I didnt use them. It was still very good, probably the best Tuna Casserole I have ever had.

Delicious recipe. I made the recipe as stated. At the last minute I added 3/4 cup of frozen peas, a half tsp. of pepper, and I sprinkled bread crumbs on top. It's a keeper.

I'm editing my original review because the first time I made this dish, I had to go rogue and get creative with substitutions--which actually made the dish much more distinct. The second time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out like a fairly average tuna casserole (though still quite tasty).  I would stick with my original substitutions. 1) Instead of mushroom soup (I didn't have any), I made my own mushroom cream sauce. 2) I had to replace pimentos with olives. 3) My husband accidentally picked up "dumpling noodles" instead of egg noodles. 4) I added some dried tomato, which gave it a zing. So the dish turned out very different. As others have noted, a bread crumb or French's onion topping is recommended. I do think peas would have added a nice texture and flavor dimension. Overall, I'm glad I ran across this recipe and the creative variations on it.

I actually made this with canned mackerel (one 15oz can) drained - cheaper, lower in toxins, and no dolphin issues.  I thought this was quite good.  A lot like my mom's tuna casserole - but actually yummy.  I chopped a whole onion, , added fresh ground pepper to the veggies, added ~2/3cup frozen peas, only used ~2 tbsp mayo total.  To the cheese sauce I added ~1tsp dried thyme, and  ~2tsp good mustard.  I added ~2 tsp cream cheese to supplement the soy milk I have on hand.  I do not have pimentos on hand.  I sprinkled a little bit of Italian seasoned bread crumbs over the top and baked as indicated.  I did not add additional cheese to the top.  I didn't think it needed more cheese.

Very yummy! I cooked 5 pieces of bacon to crumble and add to the casserole. I just sauted the vegetables in the bacon grease instead of using oil. It worked great and was delicious! Wonderful recipe! Thank you! :)

It is a dark and rainy night here in California and we were in need of a comfort food dish that was easy and woulnd't require going to the store in this weather.  It was easy to make and was absolutely delish! I made it with seashell noodles and cream of mushroom soup. I also used sliced pepper jack cheese instead of the shredded chedder and it was awesome.  Both my 2 yr old daughter and my husband loved it. Definetley a new favorite of the season.

A really good "tunafishhotdish" recipe BUT it can't be one without some frozen peas!  Also covered it with some buttered toasted panko with a sprinkle of garlic and onion powder.  Thanks for including a simple recipe staple.

I left the celery a little on the cruchy side to give the dish some texture. I also used garlic cream of mushroom soup and I added one bag of frozen peas. This is definitely a do-over in this house!!

I made the recipe exactly as published with the exception of topping with fried onions before baking.  This turned out very tasty (the husband went back for seconds).  Next time I make this I will use less mayonnaise and add more cheese. Aside from this, it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great casserole.  I did make two minor changes.  I added peas, since I love them in tuna casserole.  And, I melted two tablespoons of butter and mixed with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and spread the mixture on top...very tasty!

Very good recipe in a hurry..  each time I have made this I was out of tuna - so mine has been a vegetarian noodle casserole only and it is very tasty.  I also added peas, used the restricted sodium campbell mushroom soup and omitted the mayonaise.

Everyone is right, this is very Yummy!! I omitted the pimentos and added frozen sweet peas. After sauteing the celery, onions and bell pepper I turned the stove eye off and added the peas to the mix and let it heat that way and then followed the receipe from there. It was so awesome we made another pan when the first one ran out!!!

YUMMY!  Very creamy & tastes great!  I made a few changes--I doubled the recipe, didn't use green pepper, onion or pimientos (didn't have any), added peas, skipped the salt & sprinkled cheese on top before baking.  The daycare kids chowed it!  I may add some french fried onions on top next time b/c I like a little crunch w/ tuna casserole, but it doesn't need it for flavor!  Thanks for sharing--I will be making again!

This casserole was wonderful. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was to substitute roasted red peppers finely chopped for the Pimientos. I was still great warmed up the next day. This is a keeper.

We love this recipe. The only thing I do differently is leave out the pimentos, add an additional cup of the uncooked egg noodles and top off with fresh ground pepper.

This was excellent and quick!  All the leftovers from the week was gone..I made this up really quick and cooked on the stove top.  I was out of cream of mush so I used cream of celery, and added garlic powder and pepper

This really is the best tuna noodle casserole. I bought precut onions mixed with celery available in the supermarket.  Measured 1/2 cup saute in olive oil. Did not have any green pepper.  Combined rest of ingredients in mixing bowl (not heated in skillet)  Added some frozen peas, frozen corn, and can of green chilies. I also had some matchstick carrots that I had in the fridge.   It was so gooood!!!!!

I'm not a fan of tuna casserole, but this was requested. I was looking for something with celery and onions and this seemed to be the best. I played with the ingredients very slightly, not to effect that outcome, and this was a winner! Only complaint, which was my worry in the beginning, was that the veggies might make the sauce runny, which is did slightly. I am thinking that the next time I might work in a little Wondra flour in the sauce base to deal with that, but either way, this is a fine recipe and will be made again and again!

I like this, may double it next time.  I cut down the mayo to 1/3 c and liked it like that.  Omitted the green pepper accidentally, much to the delight of my hubby. Skipped the stovetop step with the soup and cheese, instead just mixed all in a bowl and put in the casserole and baked at 375 for 25 min. Next time I may add a little bit of pepper. Favorite dish of my oldest daughter.

Really good comfort food.  I did add a cup of peas, and I used light mayo which worked just fine.  Honestly, I don't understand the review that says how bad this is, unless you just don't like tuna!

This is a household favorite in our home. We fight over the leftovers the next day for lunch.  I don't usually have pimentos so I chop up carrots and saute with the onions and green peppers for color.  Delicious!

This was pretty good!  I only made minor changes; I omitted the pimientos, used wheat noodles, and topped with crumbled crackers.  My only complaint, besides that it seemed to create a lot of dirty dishes, was that it was too creamy/soupy/mushy for me; the crackers that I added and the celery were a different texture, but it wasn't enough.

Wonderful tuna casserole recipe!  I made the following changes:  omitted green peppers and diced pimientos (did not have on hand); added frozen peas and sliced, cooked carrots (trying to get rid of some carrots); and sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  I loved it so much that I made it again only with chicken and cream of chicken instead of tuna - also delicious!  Awesome recipe that is easy to play around with!  Thank you!

I was so skeptical about making a tuna casserole, but everyone (including myself) went back for seconds!! I followed others' recommendations and did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, and added a cup of peas. Also left out pimentos and celery for my husband and it was still SO tasty. I'll definitely be making this again!

I have always hated the idea and the smell of cooked tuna, but one of my husband's favorite dishes from childhood was a variation (his mother hated noodles, so used rice). He wasn't fond of his mother's version any more, so I thought I'd give this a try... and so glad I did!
I used a low sodium mushroom soup, albacore tuna, sweet red bell pepper and added a bit of plain greek yogurt (about a third of the required mayo allotment) and wheat egg noodles. I added a few spices, especially smoked paprika. I didn't do the pimientos or green pepper. 

Next time, I'll add a breadcrumb crust and green peas - but this was really easy to assemble, cook and wonderful to eat - I even went back for seconds!! GREAT recipe!

First time made it following the exact ingredient list. Although it was delicious, my kid wouldn't eat it because of the peppers and celery.
So, second time I made this changes: Omitted the celery and green peppers. Added one big can of sweet peas instead. Used 2 cans of albacore white and 3/4 regular mayo. Used a little more diced [red] pimientos. After I put everything in the baking dish, I topped with more cheddar cheese and crushed [French's] fried onions. Everything else was as indicated. YUM! This is gonna be a regular dish on my family's menu.

This was a quick and easy casserole that was very tasty and filling; a great dinner for busy weeknights!  We substituted elbow macaroni for the egg noodles, which worked as well.

Yum!  I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a couple changes.  I added about 1/2 a cup of frozen peas.  I also used fat free sour cream instead of mayo, and it turned out great!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe has become a favorite in our house! We use lowfat mayonnaise even though it is not "recommended". It also tastes great with other veggies. Today we added red bell pepper and peas.

Never made a tuna fish casserole before so I was delightfully surprised with how well it was reviewed by my auntie & uncle visiting for a luncheon!  This one will definately win over the family too!  A definate comfort food.

I followed it to the letter and it came out bland.  It was also very visually unappealing.  If I ever tried it again I would cover the top with crushed butter crackers.  One of my kiddos wouldn't even taste it because it looked so blah.  My tuna lover was not wild about it either.  She ate it, but told me she didn not want to keep it as leftovers.

The only variation I made to this recipe was to add some seasoned bread crumbs on top- it had received such good reviews that I wanted to initially try it as it is written.  I'm glad I did! I enjoyed this meal with my husband and a visiting friend and we all had seconds!  Everyone was pretty skeptical when I said we were having tuna casserole, but each of us really enjoyed it.  I definitely plan to make it again!

Yummy! Really in the mood for some comfort food last evening, so thought I give this a try. I made a few modifications as this recipe is close to mine but typically comes out dry and bland. I omitted green peppers and pimentos, increased onion and added fresh pressed garlic at the end of the veggie saute'. I prefer to use tuna in oil for cooking and tuna in water for cold salads. I only had water-packed for this, so I didn't get as much tuna flavor as I would have liked. I added generous amounts of cayenne and black pepper as well as Old Bay Seasoning since I didn't want to add salt at this point. To combat the dryness, I increased the milk to one full can (mushroom soup). I stirred in one cup of Kraft Crumbles cheese and about 1cup of frozen peas. For the top, I spread the other cup of cheese crumbles over the casserole in a 2qt deep dish and baked for 20min before changing the oven setting to broil and topping with garlic/herb breadcrumbs tossed with butter. I didn't move the oven rack up and 5-6min yielded a nicely browned topping. I was originally drawn to this recipe due to the  addition of Mayo and had intended to substitute with the Miracle Whip on hand, however, I forgot it! Will do next time because I think the tanginess would do well here. It was an awesome cold weather meal and my boyfriend finished by asking if he could keep me!

I made this with a few changes. I didnt have any egg noodles on hand so i used angel hair. I also added green beans instead of celery and green pepper. The pimentos were an excelltent choice so i didnt change that! I didnt have any chedder cheese so i made it with parmasean shredded. also, instead of cream of mushroom i used cream of chicken. it came out very good and everyone who ate it loved it. I will be making this again for sure!

Great recipe!!   The only change I made was to sprinkle cheese and chips on top for the last 5 minutes of baking.   Even my picky, picky son cleaned his plate.

Soooo good!  I made this, working with what I had...I substituted carrots and broccoli for the green peppers and pimentos and doubled the tuna.  It was so good!  I think next time I'll put some cracker crumbs on top before I bake it!  Very good recipe!

Seriously, BEST basic recipe I've used.  We omit peppers, add peas and (of course) top with several handfuls of smashed potato chips.  Teenagers especially seem to love this, and kids can sometimes be picky.  My hubby loves this too.  A true family pleaser!!!!!

This was so good!  My family loved it.  It was creamy, and full of taste.  I "borrowed" from another recipe, and put crushed potato chips on top--yummy!

I searched for a recipe that had more vegetable content and lucky that I came across this one. 
Doubled the recipe,used a 9x13 pan,did not add the pimentos,less mayo than called for and used yolk free egg noodles. 
This was exceptional for tuna noodle casserole. Will definately make again.

Awesome!  I like to cook from scratch and normally stay away from soup recipes but was in a hurry and this was truly d-lish!  My subsititute (due to what was on hand) was to use cream of chicken and mushroom soup and carrots instead of peppers.  
Young children LOVE it!
