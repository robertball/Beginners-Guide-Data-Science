I LOVE quinoa and I LOVE tabbouleh, so I just knew that I was gonna LOVE this! I did use dried mint, but that was my only change. Simple and delicious. Hubby gave this 2 thumbs up...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is outstanding! I also added honey to balance it out a bit, but appreciated the measurements as they were really helpful.  Thank you so much! 9/23/15 I had to comment again as have now made this several times; I meant to add that I used this rainbow quinoa (dried package I think from Target) and also added cilantro.  The initial recipe is so great though as the measurements of everything are fantastic and really adaptable.  Thank you again!

Very good. I used my own fresh home grown cucumber, mint and parsley from my garden (tomatoes were not ready yet). 

Proportions for recipe were good. However, this recipe does not make 12 servings as is stated...more like 4 or maybe 6 servings (4 or 6 dinner size bowl servings). I probably  say that though, because I can eat 1 dinner size bowl as my meal, that's how much I like it. Perhaps if you have a small side of this recipe, then you could stretch it out to 12 servings.

The only thing I consistently change is the amount of lemon. My husband always adds more lemon no matter how much I put in!

Turned out great. Doubled the recipe for baby shower. Made the quinoa in the instant pot. Made and mixed all ingredients the night before. Got lots of compliments and recipe requests.

Lovely recipe.  We just love this and it is easy to make. I did cook my quinoa in chicken stock, as I did not have any veg stock.  That was the only change I made.  Light, Refreshing, Healthy.
