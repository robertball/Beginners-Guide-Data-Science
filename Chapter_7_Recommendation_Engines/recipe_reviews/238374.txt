After reading a couple of reviewers' remarks that this was too liquidy, too juicy,  I took that as a heads up.  Because of previous experience with blueberry cobblers, however, I knew this needed  no flour or cornstarch and was just fine without.  But given the experience of some others,  I took heed and baked it a little longer (than I should have) to make sure I would not have that problem.  Yes, others' experiences can give us insight into how a recipe performs, but in addition to that we must not forget to use and trust our own judgment.  The recipe, as I see it now, is perfect as written.  Just right sweet with a rich and buttery crackly topping unlike a true cobbler, but just delicious no matter what you want to call it.  I have no doubt it was because of that decadent drizzle of melted butter before baking.  Seriously,  I tried a little dish so as to review this recipe beyond what  I already knew about it from preparing it - and I had to stop myself from eating my fill.  My attempts to correct a problem that proved to be non-existent caused more of the juices to evaporate than should have been.  So aside from,  in this case anyway, using the tips provided by others, this would have been a 5-star recipe.   My suggestion?  Prepare this recipe just as written.

5 stars for ease and the taste is fine but it is way too juicy. I made this with frozen blueberries and was surprised that the recipe didn't call for cornstarch or tapioca with the berries to thicken the juice. (2 tablespoons of cornstarch tossed with the berries would do the trick)  Next time I would mix the melted butter in with the flour, sugar, egg mixture rather than pouring it over the top.  The butter tended to run to the edges and it was hard to coat the entire top. The recipe states this will serve 12, in reality it would actually serve 5 - 6 tops.   With a few minor changes this would be a super easy 5 star recipe.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed baking this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I used frozen blueberries.  The blueberry recipe came out great.  It was light and I added a scoop of frozen yogurt.  Yummy!

I had an abundance of blueberries so I decided to try this.  I followed the suggestion of the previous reviewer and added cornstarch to the blueberries.  It was very good, but next time I make this, I won't add the cornstarch. The topping is light and a little crunchy and the berries weren't too sweet. Since I had several berries, I used a few extra and used a larger pan. I will make this again!  It was so easy to do and was delicious.

This is amazing! It was super easy to make, considering I'm a 12yr old. A lot of the comments I read before making this got me kind of nervous, saying things like how it was too sweet or too juicy. It wasn't at all. I suggest to just follow the steps exactly, no halving the sugar or anything like that. The only thing that I did differently was the fact that my blueberries were frozen, but I don't think it changed anything. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written and it came out wonderful. This is my third time making this. My husband loves it. My picky mother-in-law also loves it. I like to eat it for breakfast. We like to serve it with vanilla ice cream and a little sprinkle of cinnamon on top.

Made this for Mother's Day and all enjoyed it!  I did add about a tsp or so of tapioca to the berries and a few pinches each of nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust.  Could have used more of each of those add-ins, but still quite tasty! I'm not great at making crumbly toppings, and I really like this version, which held together, more like a cookie. Oh, and I reduced the flour about 2 tbsp and added in oatmeal for more texture.  UPDATE:  Just made this for a second time.  I did increase a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg and perfection! And I'll use this crumb topping for several recipes!  UPDATE#2:  I have now made this recipe several times with varying fruit fillings.  Seems the best combo for me is to add about 2Tbsp of tapioca (depending on the juiciness of the fruit).  Tonight was fresh rhubarb from the garden; just over 2Tbsp of tapioca and it was perfect texture; definitely add in the nutmeg and some cinnamon!

Made as written and deserving in my opinion of at least 10 stars.  I used fresh blueberries  and made the topping as directed, even though the method of mixing egg into the dry ingredients of flour and sugar was unfamiliar to me.  Before baking, I used a turkey baster to drizzle the melted butter over the topping to ensure that all the flour mixture was covered.  We topped our individual servings with vanilla ice cream, but served with ice cream, whipped cream or just as is, this was pure deliciousness!  I do agree that there's no way this will serve 12.  I would say the number is closer to 6 to 8.

Easy and delicious! Made it just as recipe described but added a little instant tapioca to blueberries.  Used frozen berries so had to bake a little longer too.

So easy and delish! I've made this 3 times this week! Didn't change a thing until the 3rd time and all I did was add raspberries and blackberries. (All blueberries is the best BTW.) It has kind of a sugar cookie texture but it's super yummy and again...EASY! My lazy kids could even make this! Hopefully they will - it's about time for Round 4. :)

This recipe was great. I used a 9 x 13 pan so I used 2 1/2 cups flour , 2 1/2 cups sugar and 2 eggs. The mixture wasn't really that crumbly so I added 2 tbsp water to flour mixture. I added cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg and it was perfect. I also used 6 cups blueberries and 3 tbsp lemon juice . The smell of the cobbler cooking was amazing.
Served it  warm with vanilla ice cream and it was so delicious super flavorful and just perfect.

This recipe turned out JUST right! I think I kept it in a little longer than the recipe called for, but each oven is different. Kept it in until it browned just right. The balance of juices and pastry is perfect!

The recipe is perfect as is, however, I did add a dark chocolate melted candy bar on top of the blueberries. It was fantastic!

Too much “crumble” topping, and the texture was a bit sandy. The taste was good and the fresh blueberries perfection.

Turned out perfectly delicious! I used gluten free flour in place of wheat flour and baked it 40 minutes instead of the 30. One off the easiest and tastiest homemade blueberry cobblers to date!

I liked this recipe, but it was a little dry. After another try, I did less dry ingredients and more egg. Also, I added frozen blueberries and put the molten butter in the batter, to make an elasticy pancake batteryish texture. This made the dish much less "crumby"

So I read many reviews before actually making this cobbler. The tricks that I used and changed that I made were for one I wanted the crust to be more of a crumbly one so instead of melted butter I used cold butter cut up into pieces mixed in with the flour, sugar and egg mix as well as putting the last tablespoon or so of cold butter cut up into small pieces around the top of crumble and it came out exactly the texture that I wanted. Secondly I added a couple tablespoons of cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture as well which gave it an even better flavor than I thought it would.  Lastly I added some instant tapioca to the blueberries and lemon juice which I feel made it a very good consistency and not runny at all like some people said it might be the way the recipe is stated to make it. Overall the cobbler was a huge success! I loved it, my husband loved it, and my kids loved it! I plan on making it again only a bigger portion this time because it went too fast! I recommend trying to make this at least once and maybe even with different fruit to change things up. Oh yea and don’t forget the vanilla ice cream to go with it! It’s amazing!! :)

Simple and delicious. After reading the conflicting reviews about whether to use cornstarch in the berries or not, I went with just a teaspoon sprinkled in with lemon juice. Texture was perfect. Also in order to get the topping to combine I added a few spoonfuls of the melted butter with the beaten egg and then poured the rest over top as directed. This is an excellent recipe, the blueberries really shine (as they should!), thanks for submitting!

7 17 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/238374/warm-blueberry-cobbler/ ... In an attempt to use up frozen berries, I upped things.  :D  'Used about 5c frozen berries, didn't add the lemon juice to them; just buttered the 9x13 & let 'em roll.  With the berries being sweet, I struggled to use all the sugar & ended up adding 1 1/2c with the 2c flour & 2 eggs.  I added 1T fresh lemon juice to the batter.  I drizzled 10T butter.  Kept the temp at 375; 45 minutes.  'Liked it.  'Wasn't overly juicy as others "warned."  'Think I'll go down another half cup sugar & maybe add that one more T lemon juice to the batter = double recipe: 2c flour, 1c sugar, 2 eggs, 2T lemon juice & 5 or more cups berries.  It isn't all that pretty, but we're making it to eat, not look at.  I like cobblers that aren't square pies or biscuits on pie filling so this was very nice.  Thanks, Dawn!

Very very tasty! It was a little liquidy which did not bother me at all, however I would have liked a little more crumble on the top! Maybe add a tid by more of the flower sugar and egg because it absorbed a little too much. But overall.....delic!!

I added some tapioca, cinnamon and nutmeg. I just took it out of the oven and it looks great. Won’t serve it for a couple more hours. I will definitely have ice cream with it.  It looks a little soupy and I’m hoping that it firms up.

With so few ingredients, this comes together in a snap!  I think the key to it is cook it long enough that the topping gets good and caramelized.  Eat it right away so that the topping doesn't have a chance to get soggy ;)  (In reality it would probably be fine for 3 days left out of the fridge, or longer if you chose to refrigerate it.  Mine never lasts that long!)  Quick enough for comfort food and yummy enough for company.

This really is a good recipe. Will make it again.  Really simple and comes together fast.  Very versatile, you could use whatever berries and for  that matter fruit that you want to. I did one blueberry version and one blueberry and peaches.  I added cinnamon and fresh nutmeg to the fruit along with a little sprinkling of flour, I was concerned about too much liquid.  I did use berrries and peaches that I had frozen a few weeks ago both of which are grown locally. I made the topping as is and divided that between the two cobblers.   Easy Peasy recipe that is delicious.

I made it as directed. The dough on top was like bisquick dough and it came out tasteless and hard. The blueberries needed something more.  I don’t think I will try it again.

I made this following the directions to a T & I used fresh blueberries. It came out fine but I found the topping to be rather bland & unsatisfying. It seemed a little too floury as well. No one could ever accuse this dish of being too sweet. I think a crumble topping would be much more delicious. As it stands, it's alright but you can definitely make something better.

Blueberry flavor was good, and crust was crisp, which was nice. However,  I personally prefer a more substantial crust and will not be making this again.

I made it, after reading the reviews I added some cornstarch (2TSP) to the blueberries and it was a big hit.

Very easy to make. I dusted the blueberries with flour and sprinkled some cinnamon on top. My husband thought it was a bit too sweet but he didn't have it with vanilla ice cream like I did. Once it had time to set and cool a bit it wasn't too liquidy at all.

Too liquidy. Had to bake  much longer than the recipe called  for to get the dough at the center of the cobbler to be fully cooked.

I made this as written, but with vegan substitutions, and it was so good! My teenage vegan daughter ate all but one small scoop of it, and asked me to make it again. FYI, the substitutions I made were to use vegan butter (I used country crock plant butter with olive oil), and to replace the egg I mixed 1tbsp ground flax seed with 3 tbsp boiling water and let it cool.

I had extra blueberries and so I used a little extra.  Because the berries were so juicy, the juicy fruit bubbled over the crust, but it was really delicious!

I used fresh berries and gluten free flour. It was amazing and not watery at all. I misread the recipe and combined the butter with the flour and sugar then placed the dough over the berries. It was super easy and delicious. Served warm with ice cream or whipped cream, this dessert is a keeper.

I made this using frozen blueberries. This was for my fire departments monthly meeting and they loved it. I even doubled the batch and cooked it for about 45 minutes. They loved it but when the pan came home there was just a little bit left. Will be making this again!!

I followed the recipe exactly  but didn't have that size pan. It probably would have been better as the layer of blueberries was rather thin. Very yummy though!

I made this recipe exactly as is and felt the topping needed something more in terms of flavor.  It just tasted like a too sweet sugar cookie to me.  I might try again and substitute brown sugar for the white sugar, and add a touch of salt to balance out the sweetness.  The lemon juice mixed with fresh blueberries was perfect.

Very very  good.  I increased the recipe for a 9x13 dish.  Doubled the crust .  The only issue I had was all of the liquid.  Next time I will add some sure gel to thicken it up.  Husband and kids loved it too.  I will make this again!!

Yummy. I followed the directions as is using fresh blueberries. I probably used about 21/2cups because that's what I had on hand. I loved the extra liquid. It made the cobbler yummy. Oh I did add 1 teaspoon of sugar to the berries before I added the tipping to bake. When cooled the extra liquid gels and isn't a problem

I had 2 pints of fresh blueberries that I wanted to use. I used a 9 x 12 baking dish and follow the directions. I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar and a pinch of cinnamon . I made one and a half times the recipe for the topping and cut up 6 tbls cold butter into the flour mixture to make it coarse and crumbled. After the topping was sprinkled over the blueberries I dotted the top with 2 tbls small cutup pieces of the rest of the cold butter. I cooked it for 30 minutes and it came out great! Will definitely make this again! I served it with vanilla bean ice cream! Yum ;)

Added a pinch of nutmeg to the dry ingredients but otherwise made it as written.  Given some reviews about the berries becoming runny I used fresh blueberries and made sure I dried them after washing.  The consistency of the berries after baking was fine.  Good cobbler, but not amazing however worth making again given the ease of the recipe.

This is the best blueberry cobbler I have ever tasted.  Used fresh blueberries, but cut the butter into the dry mix.  So rich and homemade tasting . .  . you will never need another recipe!

I made this and it in a 9 inch  square pan. I used frozen blueberries so I knew it would be extra liquidy ( is that a word?).  I added a tablespoon of Therm Flo to the flour / sugar mixture and ended up baking it for an extra 20 minutes before it was thick and bubbly. The taste was very good! Will make it again.

Very delicious. Just a word of warning if you use frozen berries: I ended up having to bake it for an hour before the top was fully browned. Also, having read other reviews, I added a about 1 TBSP of cornstarch to the blueberries. It is a great recipe and the berry-to-breading ratio is just perfect!

I had two large containers of blueberries I had to use so I found this easy recipe. Followed the recipe as listed and it was delicious. My family loved it. I did not have an issue with it being too liquidy like some reviewers commented on.

I tossed the fruit first in the flour mixture and then separated the fruit and added the lemon juice.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a scrape of nutmeg to the fruit.  The fruit cooks up thicker but not gluey. An easy recipe to use up fruit in the fridge.

Changes made: 
Whole wheat flour 
Brown sugar instead of white sugar ......

I Lined the bottom of my baking dish with graham cracker crumbs. 

This recipie was delish!!! Baked in 30 minutes and it was probably one of the easiest and best desserts I've had.  Served it with sugar free vanilla ice cream.  It was so tasty. My husband loved it.

I thought this was a great recipe! I didn't have a lemon on hand  so I just skipped it and added a little cinnamon to the berries. I used fresh berries and had to cook it a little longer. Turned out perfect. I love the crunchy crust! It was so easy that this will be my go to dessert from now on.

Are you kidding me! This is the easiest thing ever and tastes great. I had a pint of fresh blueberries that I had forgotten about and had almost nothing in the fridge/pantry. I would bet that anyone  looking for a recipe has the ingredients for this at home right now. I will use this recipe every time. With one pint of blueberries I used 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and just tossed the extra topping rather than try to make a smaller amount. Also used a smaller baking dish. Came out perfect.

Wow! I made this and two other desserts for Easter dinner, so wanted something easy, quick and delicious. This hits all those marks! I followed the recipe as shown but added a bit of quick cooking tapioca to berries, and a drizzle of lemon juice as well as a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the crumble as suggested by other reviewers and I think that improved the recipe slightly.  I had none of the overly juiciness others have experienced, which I think might be due to using frozen blueberries. This was enjoyed by everyone, young and old! Thank you for a great recipe!

I also thought this was a bit too liquidy.  I was disappointed that the blueberry juice ran all over the topping, negating the yummy crispy-crustiness that I love. (I know it was yummy from the few dry spots in the topping.) I used fresh blueberries that had been sitting at room temp all day, in case that matters. I'm thinking that berries can vary in their liquid content? I loved the taste (although hubby wanted more sugar, but that's him). Will try again with a bit of cornstarch. 
A note about the crust: By the time I incorporated the egg into all the dry ingredients, I was beyond "coarse crumb" and into "mostly fine crumb with some powder." This didn't seem to affect how it turned out, and it's worlds easier than cutting in butter. Thanks for the clever recipe!

I did this and it was amazing    I started with a can of Blueberries and added about 2 c of frozen berries. Due to adding the extra berry I  used half a cup more of each flour and sugar, aslo added  1/2 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg. about 7 for the butter ... Its awesome....
