Delicate flavor, not as strongly "apricot" tasting as I had hoped, but still very good.  I doubled the recipe, and it didn't take it long to completely disappear.

Good, but not very apricot-y.  I used several fresh skinned apricots, pureed one cup, and then finely diced one more apricot to add some texture.  The flavor was still barely there, but a good tasting bread anyway.

I tried this recipe because I had some canned apricots I wasn't sure what to do with. I would absolutely make this again. The whole family loved it. I did make 2 changes; I sustituted margarine for the shortening and I substituted pecans for the walnuts. It was moist and the flavor was great!

I was looking for several fresh apricot recipes to use up my bumper crop from my tree.  I made this using fresh apricots (used two cups sliced and heated the apricots in a saucepan on the stovetop to release the juices and make it so that I could actually puree the apricots).  The flavor is interesting.  It tastes very strongly of apricots by using fresh.  It's not my favorite, so I'll keep looking for a way to use the fresh apricots.

Delicious!  I served this at a ladies social with RAVE reviews!  So many people wanted the recipe!  I used fresh apricots as I have a tree, and had them all mashed, so I just measured a couple of heaping cups instead of the can... experimented with a few different spices - ginger, cloves, cinnamon, poppy seeds -- not exactly all in the same batch.  Thanks for a DELIGHTFULLY well received treat!

I made this using peaches instead of apricots.  Also made muffins instead of a loaf.  But I thought it came out rather well.  i would definitely do it again. ( I did also add a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon plus blend)  Also a side note, it also works well with other fruits.  I made a 2nd batch with a can of pears and added in some dried blueberries.  Very good too. :)

The texture of this bread was very nice, not too heavy and moist.  I thought it was overall lacking flavour..needs some cinnamon perhaps and vanilla.  The apricot flavour didn't really come through.  Will likely stick with banana or date nut bread instead of making this again.

I was curious about this recipe; never made a bread from apricots before.  It was a success! I'm vegan so I had to make a few changes but it came out very moist with the perfect amount of sweetness.  My only comment, which is minor, is that it doesn't possess an overwhelming apricot flavor.  Once again though, it was a great recipe.

I don't know if it made a difference or not, but I used fresh apricots.  It tasted more like squash bread instead of apricot.  We did not like this bread and probably will not make again.

I made this bread with 3 c. fresh apricots, quartered, simmered on the stove in a few TBS water for a couple of minutes that one reviewer suggested instead of the dried apricots. Did not puree them so they added a nice texture. Turned out perfect! I also added 1 tsp Cinnamon and 1 tsp Vanilla for my family's tastes and increased the chopped walnuts to 3/4 c. This is my new go-to recipe to use fresh apricots!

Nice texture, very moist, but you couldn't really taste the apricot.

Very light and tasty!  I used fresh peaches, skin on, and pureed them with 1 Tbsp water to make 1 cup.  Subbed in 1 cup of whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp almond extract, and used almonds instead of walnuts.
