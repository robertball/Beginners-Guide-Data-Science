EXCELLENT!  I have been looking for like a recipe like this for years!  I like to decrease sugar, so I only added 1/3 cup white sugar--the raisins and craisins were sweet enuf!

I didn't have all the listed ingredients so I added flax seeds and to save time--I chopped up the carrots, red onions, some basil and  2 cloves of garlic in my food processor---quick, easy!

I did not add fruit to it--it is still delicious!

Thank you for a great base recipe to tweek!

I just about didn't make this salad as the amount of sugar called for was a real turn off.  It really makes something quite healthy into not so healthy with all that sugar.  No need for any sugar, the blueberries cranberries and carrots add enough sweetness! I've found that if you chop up the cranberries and let them soak it the oil/vinegar it really brings out the flavour of the dressing and the berries!

This salad was awesome!  I made it for a potluck for work and it was the first to be completely devoured!  Many admitted they were skeptical when I offered to bring a kale salad but all have asked for the recipe!  I used White Balsamic Vinegar and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cu and could have gone with even less.  This one is a keeper!

I'm glad I waited to review this bc this salad gets better after it sits.  I WANT to love kale but I don't.  It's a texture thing for me but I gobble down this salad.  I accidentally used up my last red onion before I made this so I omitted it but it is still fantastic!  I made it before be the other night and brought it out in the morning just to taste in and ended up having a big bowl of it for breakfast!  Just had another big bowl today...YUM.  the textures and flavors are awesome.  I put 1/2 the dressing on the salad and reserved the rest but it doesn't need the rest.  its really great as is.  WILL make again and definitely sharing this recipe!

For the folks who find traditional kale bitter, try using lacinato kale (also known as Tuscan kale). It is much better suited to be eaten raw and stands up well to dressing. I was able to find it at Whole Foods Market. If it still isn't palatable for you, baby spinach and arugula mixed would make a wonderful substitute.

Kale is a lettuce that we are trying to enjoy.  In our case, it is an acquired taste.  DH and DS are still working on the bitterness of the leaves, but not ready to give up on it.   I made this for a birthday carry-in at work, and it was well received.  I did cut the sugar back to ¼ cup and it worked well.  It is a very pretty salad with all the colors going on.  Making the salad 4 – 6 hours ahead of time is a must.  The kale needs time to soften up.  The next time I make it, I will make it the night before and add the cashew pieces and sunflower seeds right before serving.  This is very good, pretty and by cutting the sugar back pretty healthy for you.  Thank you, Susan, for sharing your recipe.

This is wonderful!  I took the advice of several others and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used white balsamic vinegar for the dressing.  I also grated a head of red cabbage and added that to the salad.  I didn't have cashews or sesame seeds so substituted 2/3 cup sliced toasted almonds along with the craisins.  This salad is not only really beautiful (with the green kale and red cabbage) but it tastes fantastic!  My kids loved it too!

So delicious! Make sure to assemble it ahead of time to let the kale soften and the flavors develop. I have made it twice now and my family really enjoys it.

It is an easy recipe to make and packed full of great nutrients. However, the recipe said it makes 20 servings. I was skepical about makeing it at first but as I read through the ingredients it didn't seem like it would feed 20 people. After assembling it I realized that as a side dish it will probably feed more like 8-10 people if they each ate about a 1/2 cup serving.

This was really good (just don't eat it right before a run!) even without any of the sugar.  I was going to reduce the sugar and then decided to eliminate it altogether and see how it turned out--still delicious and even better as leftovers.

I love this recipe! This salad is delicious and very healthy also. All the ingredients provide the perfect balance. I agree that the salad dressing is too sweet, so I typically use less sugar (about 1/2 cup) instead of the full amount. It is better if it can sit for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld, but if you don't have time, don't worry about it. It's good right away too! Even picky eaters will eat this and even people who don't like kale or are unsure of trying kale, this is a great recipe to start with. It's been easy to find all the ingredients in the supermarket, although in the end, this salad is an expensive salad to make due to all the ingredients. Even though, it's one of my family's favorites and we've made it multiple times already! Thank you for the recipe!

I think this salad would be great with less sugar.  I tried it and felt uneasy about using 3/4 cup sugar, so I used 1/2 cup sugar, still too much sugar.  I am not that picky, but when eating vegetables you don't want it super sweet, a touch of sweet is all that is necessary.  Next time I will start with 1/8 cup and see how that is.  Can't even imagine what it taste like with the 3/4 cup, so beware start with a small amount of sugar and work up if the taste isn't right to you.  I still ate it, because of all the good stuff in it, to me its an awesome salad.

I had purchased the Superfood salad at the deli a couple of times so was thrilled to find the recipe.  I've made it as is and the next time added a package of quinoa and brown rice that I had purchased at Costco.  Delicious.  My husband says it's his favorite new salad.  So easy and nutritious.  A keeper for sure.

I made this for a pot luck at work and six different people asked me for the recipe!  I made it as written except I only used 1/4 c. sugar in the dressing.  The combination of flavors and textures is fantastic.

Kale? Isn't that a nasty leafy green vegetable? But I just adored this salad! I wouldn't change a thing, though this recipe lends itself well to using what you have on hand. I did cut the sugar down a smidgen the second time I made it, but it's wonderful as is. The organic market deli sold a very similar salad for about $1000/pound, but we can make it much less expensively. Do try this, even if you don't think you like kale.

I've made this recipe twice and WOW...just absolutely loved it!  I cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup and I used unsweetened dried cranberries.  Very easy to make and I enjoyed the vinegrette dressing.  :))

The salad is awesome. I got lazy and used seasoned rice vinegar (which I always have and love) and olive oil. I made the base salad the night before, with just kale onions carrots. I added the blueberries, walnuts (instead of sunflower and cashews-it's what I had) and added bleu cheese right before serving. It was awesome. The extra moisture from the kale plumped up the cranberries and the bleu cheese added a nice flavor. I think I will try goat cheese at some point. My daughter thought it was great and ate almost all of it. 
I realize that people don't like it when you rate a recipe after modifications, but sometimes you don't have all the ingredients on hand. I alway appreciate the tweaks people come up with in the reviews.

This is an awesome salad. I've made it on several occasions, and everyone asks for the recipe. I've switched up the type of vinegar, from raspberry, to pomegranate-infused for a fuitier taste, it's all good! Would definitely recommend!

I am addicted to this salad. I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/3 cup splenda and it was great. I chopped my kale well so it isn't real leafy. Thanks for the recipe.

Just made this for a bbq at a friend's.  It was a huge hit!  I added red bell pepper because I had it and omitted onion because my friend doesn't eat it.  There was a fight over who got to take the leftovers home! Great recipe!

Great recipe!  I made some changes- to make it more of a fall salad, I used apples and raisins rather than blueberries.  Also omitted nuts due to allergies.  I would use less sugar in the dressing,  even my 5 year old loved it

We LOVE this recipe and it is super easy to make.  It makes a large batch and the left overs are good for a few days. 
FYI on the salad ingredient list – I didn't measure.  The dressing I follow as stated.  The dressing makes extra and is really good on regular salad too.

1 – bunch of Kale = 1 bag from Kroger (I assumed this is larger than 1 bunch of kale so I increase the other ingredients)
Edamame = 2 frozen packs (not sure of the size)
Onion = at least ½ maybe even 3/4
Carrots = a little more than a cup
Blueberries = fresh BB, 2 packs
Craisins = 1 cup
Nuts = close to original  (use whatever kind I have on hand)

I love it! More importantly, my 6 year old and my husband ate the salad without a complaint! Now, I can serve kale!!! Thank you for sharing. My husband loves the dressing and we have used it on our regular salad because it's his new favorite. I used Peanut oil and Olive Oil mixed instead of all Olive Oil. I did not have sunflower seeds and substituted pumpkin seeds.

I hardly ever leave reviews but I must in this case. I made it for a potluck too, but didn't get enough myself so am making another just for me and my husband, who loved it as well. It contains the most wonderful ingredients, except for the sugar, which I left out but then wondered if people would think it needed something even sweeter than dried cranberries and blueberries. (I always look for dried cranberries sweetened with grape juice. You don't need the extra sugar. No one does.) It was fantastic and I'll eliminate that bit of honey this time. It does need to sit for the 4 to 6 hours as indicated; then even self-professed kale haters will love it.  Don't leave anything out but the sugar! Thanks so much for this recipe, Susan!

This is an excellent kale salad. I've made it a couple times now and it has been a hit for potlucks.  I agree with other reviewer suggestions to cut the sugar and make the salad at least a couple hours ahead of when you're planning to eat it so that the kale softens.  Good stuff.

My modification: added chopped up raw broccoli (cut small with pampered chef chopper), added 1 cup of cooked quinoa or brown/wild rice, used almonds instead of cashews, left out onions.  Used light raspberry vinaigrette for the dressing.

Made this for a group of ladies and they all loved it. Even the girl who hates vegetables went back for seconds. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added cabbage.

I made this recipe for Superbowl. Wanted to bring something that was a vegetable. I did mine exactly except I added a whole head of shredded savoy cabbage to give it a slaw feel. Mine is the picture added. I got two others asking for the recipe and it's great since the calorie count is so low!

Everyone loves this salad! It's so delicious that even kale-haters have asked for the recipe. 
I decreased the sugar by half.  You could easily substitute cashews for pecans or leave them out.  The craisens and toasted sunflower seeds were fantastic in it. 
Oh...and keep floss handy for that kale!

A-MAZ-ING!!!!  Knew it would be great but couldn't believe how tasty it is!  Didn't have time to let it marinate, but it's great without doing that if you don't have much time!  I also threw in some sliced strawberries since they were in season.

I've used allrecipes for years and this is the first recipe that I felt I HAD to review.  It's great!  Very versatile, you can substitute ingredients as needed and it still turns out great! Allowing the dressing to almost marinate the kale softens it and makes it taste great.  I do usually cut the sugar down ( but it tastes good as is too) and usually find myself not needing to add any extra dressing at the end.

I didn't make this exact recipe, but used it as a guide so shoot me. I'm going to review it anyway. Like many people, I used what I had in the fridge. I used strawberries, radishes and yellow tomatoes. I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup which was plenty. This recipe will be a regular for me now. Make sure you let it sit in the fridge overnight. So yummy!

I agree with the sugar comments. I changed it to 1/3Cup.  This salad is a wonderful salad and lasts in the refrigerator several days without wilting. It absolutely MUST be made at least 8 hours ahead to allow the kale to become tender.

Also, I will use whatever nuts I have on hand. I have pumpkin seeds today so that's what's going in it!

Wow! Superfoods never tasted so wonderful! Even Hubs & the kids like fresh kale now! NO wonder this is my new favorite salad - really, I could have eaten the whole salad myself....., and I certainly polished the bowl! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.... Super food fever is setting in deep!!!! Yum, yum, yum, yum, YUM! ... (and yes, this is a flexible salad: subs for sugar, fruit, nuts, all work well, try adding quinoa..... etc.)

This is so good - everybody loves it, and my 12 year old kale-hating son even asks for 2nds.  I cut back on the sugar and use whatever vinegar I have on hand.  It's always a hit.

Awesome!  I used agave (1/2 cup), apple cider vinegar, almonds and frozen blueberries.  No cranberries. No red onions. It was still great.  Used kitchen shears to cut up the kale.  Already have several requests for the recipe!!

This is my new favorite Kale recipe!  I made it for book club today and it was a big hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.  I used only 1/3 cup sugar which was plenty sweet.  I never knew Kale could taste so good!

This was fantastic! Made it exactly as written, except for the amount of sugar. I agree that 1/3 cup sugar is enough. I used 1/2 of a large bag of kale and it made a huge amount of salad.

I love the salad ingredients ! For the dressing I decreased the sugar and increased the vinegar.  Would definitely make this again.

My husband and I both loved this hearty salad, with vegetable protein, fresh and dried fruit  and a flavorful dressing, though I did not use sugar but only 1/4 cup of stevia. Also used pepitas, as I had no cashews on hand.

Excellent salad even if you're not crazy about Kale.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was very delicious but, a bit sweet for my taste (3/4 cup sugar is a lot!)  Made it a second time and added chick peas and cabbage for extra crunch.  I tried it with just 1/3 cup sugar in the dressing and it was plenty sweet enough. It's become a requested dish at pot lucks.

I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and soaked the cranberries in 2 Tbs OJ to reconstitute them.  After draining, I added  the OJ to the dressing.  I used a NUTRIBULLET to blend the dressing ingredients before adding them to the salad.

I made it for an Easter party. We like it and some of them asked me about the recipe. However , it is very sweet for me. I will add 1/3 cup of honey or brown sugar instead of the white sugar 3/4 cup.

Cut the sugar in half and soaked some of the cranberries in the dressing as someone suggested.  Did not have sunflower seeds, but used some pine nuts (toasted) - very good.  Also used the lacinato (Tuscan)kale and mixed it with spinach and arugula.  Many people at the BBQ asked for recipe. Will make it again!

Per other suggestions, I decreased the amount of sugar by half and found it perfect. I took it to a potluck and even though I didn't have time to let it sit before I took it, it was a big hit and I think the only dish that didn't have leftovers!

Great tasting salad, which I made for about 60 people.
But I had to make a couple of changes: much much less sugar than called for in the dressing and much more kale. With this in mind, they loved it!

This is not only a beautiful salad to serve but very delicious and has made kale lovers of our family.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and believe I could have reduced it more, and added about 2 cups of chopped red cabbage.  Thanks for the awesome recipe

Will definitely make it again. It's lovely and the whole family enjoyed it. I put only half a cup of sugar in the dressing. And next time, I don't think i'll put as much dressing on the salad.

Ive always loved the salad at king soopers so I was excited to see it here.  I have to admit I did make changes, mostly due to ingredients on hand, but also because I dont think this salad needs any sugar at all!  I added no sugar or edamame (love edamame, but didnt have any), and I left out the cranberries and blue berries (didnt have any, and guess what, it wasnt missed).  I did add cherry tomatoes and sweet peppers because I wanted to use them up, and used diced almonds (again, because that was what I had), and it still had that delicious taste!  I think this is a very versatile salad, and i appreciate the base ingredients, however, I think I will stick to a sugarless and fruitless version for my own tastes!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This was my first try at kale salad that doesn't come out of a bag and it turned out great. I did cut back on the sugar to a 1/3 cup. Didn't have dried cranberries so threw in dried blueberries. I won't do that again. They are way too hard. Also left out the cashews (allergies in the family). Even better the next day.

This is our new favorite salad (did I mention we don't like kale), but this kale salad is amazing. I make it 12 hours ahead of time to make sure dressing softens the kale. I add fresh strawberries right before serving, never used cashews in it , only sunflower seeds, but I am sure the cashews would taste so good. I add shredded cabbage to mine also. For something refreshing on hot summer days, try adding some frozen blueberries right before serving. I found using frozen blueberries very soggy after they defrost, so I would only add fresh ones to it when I first make it, then frozen when serving if desired.

I love this salad!
People who think they don't like kale will be surprised, especially, as this salad is allowed to sit in the dressing, it absorbs the delicious flavor of the dressing.   I did follow the advice from some reviewers, and cut the sugar by about half.  I would recommend you try it with reduced sugar to suit your taste.
I have made it many times, and substituted different nuts, seeds, added couscous, etc., very versatile.  Other than the sugar amount,  make it as written.  Delicious go-to salad for any time of the year.!  Thank you!

I'm so  glad I listened to the other reviews and cut the sugar way down! I didn't use edamame instead I mimicked my grocery stores version with thin sliced bok choy, walnuts and lots of blueberries. Next time, im going to experiment with the dressing. They use a blueberry pomegranate dressing.  But I'm so grateful for this base recipe!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I wasn't sure what kind of vinegar I was supposed to use and 3/4 cup sugar is too much.   I used white balsamic and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was still really sweet.  I will make this again and next time will try red wine vinegar to see if it cuts the sweetness.

This was a delicious salad.  I cut my kale quite small and removed the thick stems.  It made a lot, but it kept well in the refrigerator and just got better the next day.  You could also add raisins, and any other fruit of your preference.

I tasted a salad from a grocery store deli and set out to find a similar recipe and THIS IS IT!  This is an amazing salad and I've been eating it for 3 days in a row!  Because the Kale holds up so well after already being dressed, it still tastes delicious and is not soggy at all.  I only used 1/2 the dressing that it called for and it was plenty.  I omitted most of the sugar, I used about 2 tablespoons and it's definitely sweet enough, I think I'll try honey next time.  If I could give this 10 stars I would!

Family loved this salad! I appreciated the recommendation to make it the day before so kale would wilt and be tender. Used 1/4 cup of sugar, with white balsamic vinegar,  and subbed toasted walnuts for the cashews. Put in a whole cup of blueberries. It was delicious!

My husband who hates kale absolutely could not get enough of this salad. I used what was on hand so altered recipe a bit. Instead of blueberries and cranberries I used cut up dried apricots. I only had about 3/4 of the required white vinegar so added apple vinegar to have enough. I also only had sunflower seeds available so only used that. This is perfect since you can make it ahead to let the marinade soak in. Definitely a keeper!

This is fantastic!!  I have made it so many times I just had to rate it. The only change was to cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. The rest I followed exactly.  Every time I make it someone asks for the recipe.  It is wonderful and delicious and healthy and I use up the kale in my garden!! Thank you so much for this recipe.

I used a fig balsamic vinegar so did not add sugar. Used what I had in the house - some dried currants and cranberries , green onions, shredded carrot, raw sunflower seeds and walnuts. Very good

Turned out great. Added goji berries instead of cranberries because of the sugar. Added shredded beets and finely chopped broccoli for added nutrition. Instead of sugar in the dressing used stevia.

This is, by far, the best kale salad I have eaten.  I made it with less dressing to reduce the sugar and it was still terrific.  All the ingredients seem to stay mixed up well with the kale rather than all falling to the bottom of the bowl.  It is better the second or third day.  I know the dressing is not the healthiest, but it seems worth it to get all those other ingredients in.  That said, I may try substituting honey for the sugar.  It will dissolve easier and adds some minerals to the mix.

Made this super salad a few times following the recipe exactly other than reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Have made it several times since without the sugar altogether and it was still the best salad ever! 
Basic recipe is open to many variations depending on what you would like to add or substitute. Have done many variations and they have all been winners.  SUPER SUMMER KALE SALAD RECIPE!!!

It is a great summer salad. I, too, reduced the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup; it might have been too sweet for my taste, but the blueberries I used were not sweet, so it balanced out. I plan on making it again and reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup. Thanks for sharing it.

I think know which salad and grocery chain this must be copied from and I buy  it often so I can say: you got it spot on. Delicious. I took other reviewers' advice and started with only 1/4 cup sugar. It was plenty sweet and next time I might try just 1/8 cup. Thank you for this recipe! ! It was so easy and so delicious.

Loved it, as did all at our gathering!! I did add some Romaine to make it more palatable for the kids. I would recommend a smaller amount of sugar in the dressing.

This was amazing...the thing that I think irritates me the most about comments/ratings on allrecipes is that people shouldn't get to comment if they changed a dozen things about it. Who has time to go through and see all the tweaks before they make something?
Lastly, it clearly says to toss it in half of the dressing and put the remainder on the side...meaning that you are literally just tossing it in the amount most people are reducing the sugar by. A little over 1/3 cup.

This salad was delicious.  However, I just couldn't add that much sugar.  I thought to myself "we're dressing a salad, not sugar coating it. " So like others, I backed way down on the sugar.  I only used 2 Tablespoons of sugar in the dressing and it still was awesome.

Really good. As others did, I cut the sugar down to1/4 cup. Also used baby kale and silvered almonds for cashews cause that's what I had.
Happy to  add this recipe to my list of Summer salads.

Easy to make, healthy and delicious. 
I cut the sugar down to a 1/2 cup  and it was still great. 
I may even cut  down a little more when i make it again.

Fantastic.  Absolutely delicious and I HATE kale.  I'll eat this at every single meal!!  lol   I've made it about 8 times now.  The dressing as written detracts from the healthiness of the salad.  Although much drier than the original, a 1/4 cup of rice vinegar,  1 tablespoon of oil, and 2 tablespoons + 2 tsp of agave approximates the flavor and keeps it a great side dish / snack without a ton of sugary calories.  Each time I make it the quantities of items varies a bit, (7oz edamame this last time, for instance) but it usually works out to nine 100-gram servings at 135 cals... approximately...  Oh, and I soak the cranberries in the dressing overnight before dumping the mix into the rest of the salad.

Delicious! I love Krogers kale salad in the deli station, but $6 a pound is too much. I found this recipe and I am SO happy I tried it.  I used baby kale so I could eat it right away. I used 1/3c sugar and white wine vinegar instead of white.  We only used half the dressing so next time I will only make half the dressing ingredients and 3 tablespoons of sugar. A great recipe!

Delicious. Loved how there were tons of toppings and they weren't the usual fare (croutons & cheese). Used a white balsamic dressing instead and liked that.

I am glad I found this recipe finally.  I bought kale salad once at the grocery after that I can't help but think how good it was.  Now I dont have to wonder all I need is the ingridients so I can make my own Kale Salad.  Thank you for sharing.

I'm trying to cut out as much sugar as possible, so I substituted stevia for sugar and only used 1/2 cup because I find stevia so sweet. This salad is amazing! I can eat it for days!

Delicious!!  I used dried blueberries which worked out great if you don't have fresh and coconut sugar for a healthier version.  Was fantastic!

loved this! It tastes like the version at my local supermarket in North Jersey I used to buy. I have been missing it since moving to Florida. I agree with the other comments on decreasing the dressing amount. I could have used half of it. Still was delicious!

We really liked this.  I didn't put the whole amount of dressing on it.  We also didn't wait four hours.  We thought the flavor combination was great.

This gets rave reviews every time I make it.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and that's plenty.  Awesome, healthy salad!

I adore kale so this sounded perfect and it was.  I had no blueberries so I left them out.  I didn't have cashews either and used walnuts instead.  I never even made the dressing.  It was all so delicious as is.  That said, this particular bunch of kale was not very bitter, so I may need the dressing the next time around.

Delicious! But I used Splenda instead of sugar as I'm doing sugar-free and used 10 packets which was STILL too sweet. Next time I'll cut down on sweetness and cut out the blueberries. As my mom said "it had blueberries in it? I didn't even know!"
Update: I used raw apple cider vinegar and cut the sugar in half (and added a bit back) to serve to guests. I liked the zippy acidity it gave. I also switched out edamame for frozen thawed peas, and sliced grapes for blueberries. Still delicious!

I have made this many times and I am always asked for the recipe. I use 1/4 cup sugar and slightly less olive oil, per other reviewers. The fruit does a lot to sweeten the salad. I would say the kale should soak in the dressing 10 hours or so, and I toss it several times. 4 hours doesn't soften it enough for our family. And then I add the other ingredients a few hours before serving. Delish!

This is fantastic! Cut back on the sugar in the dressing for sure but it's a good dressing and the toppings can easily be switched out for other nuts or fruit.

This recipe makes Kale taste good!  Even better than a similar salad found in our super market deli.  Recipe holds well, so it will last a couple days in the fridge and will still be wonderful to eat.  Made recipe as shown and wouldn't change a thing.

I just made this a few days ago and thought it was perfect. I did not add the edamame only because I did not have it at home. Next time I make it I will add a little less sugar- just a tad on the sweet side. Great side dish!!

For a lower carb count and slightly healthier version, I used 1/4 cup agave in place of the sugar. For simpler preparation, I used baby kale because it doesn't require chopping (I also think it is easier to eat and doesn't need to sit with the dressing as long). I used sliced almonds in place of cashews. And I left out the edamame and raw onion.

A few hours ahead, I mixed together the dressing, kale, carrots, and dried cranberries. Just before serving, I tossed in the almonds, blueberries, and sunflower seeds. Turned out great!

Wow! I bought 2 bunches of kale at the farmer's market because it's good for you, but wasn't sure how to make it appetizing without cooking.  This recipe is such a keeper; even my husband liked it.  And it's so versatile.  I didn't have edamame, red onion, carrot, dried cranberries, cashew pieces or sunflower seeds.  So the salad ingredients I used were purple kale, sweet Walla Walla onion, blueberries, dried tart cherries and chopped pecans. I made the dressing per the recipe and had extra to make this again, which will be today since we have another bunch of kale.  Thanks, Susan.

Lovely salad but I only used 1 Tbsp of sugar. I can't imagine using 3/4 cup of sugar and not sure how that much would even dissolve. I also used mixed greens because I didn't have kale and it worked beautifully.

This is a winner. Went over well at a party. Great the next day too. Cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. 3/4 cup is just not necessary for a great taste. I used apple cider vinegar. You do need to make it ahead or the kale will not be soft enough. I used walnuts instead of cashews.

Just wanted to say that the place I work and have been working at for 9 years makes the salad that you put up.  Its called the Super Food salad and it is sold at a national grocery store at the chefs case.  It is a great salad and in the dressing there is no sugar at all.  Just the raw items and the dressing.

This salad really grows on you!  I tried some at a supermarket and found this recipe. (I love Allrecipes!) I dressed the kale alone the night before, and it made a big difference, softened it nicely. I will be making this one often.  I used 1/2 c. of Splenda so my diabetic mom could try it.

Love this salad! The kale came in my CSA box and was my very first experience with it. I subbed considerably less of an erythritol-xylitol blend instead of sugar, yet the dressing was still pretty sweet. The salad itself is sweet with the blueberries and cranberries, so my word of advice is to add sweetener sparingly to your own personal taste. I love all the crunch in this salad!

I went to a party and they had a kale salad.  I tried it and liked it.  I liked it so much that I looked for a recipe.  This one is great.  I made it twice.  The second time I added chopped mango and bell peppers to the salad.  I also added mango to the dressing and pureed it.

Got it on a whim last week at from that national supermarket chains' deli.  Wanted something a little different than my great but common slaw with my beef brisket. LOVED IT BIG TIME!  I was going to try to duplicate it...good to find those few ingredients I missed from you!  I'm going to try using dried blueberries and re-hydrate.  That way, I have all the ingredients on hand, at all times...all I need to do is grab some fresh kale on the way home!

I made this the the night before an afternoon potluck. I put the nuts and seeds in right before we left. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. Next time I am going to cut down the sugar a bit, however, just to make it a bit healthier.

Best salad I've had in a really really long time! No one could believe kale could be so tasty. Did as others suggested and cut back sugar to 1/3 cup and used white balsamic vinegar. Will be making again and again!
