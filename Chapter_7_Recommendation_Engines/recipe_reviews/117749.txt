I followed the recipe exactly, using jumbo sea scallops.  The recipe is a simple one, but with awesome results!  Will definitely make again soon.

Absolutely phenomenal! Although it seems simple, this is delicious. I doubled the recipe for my family, making 4 per person. Even that wasn't enough! Next time I shall make more.

It was okay.  I used small scallops and there was a little too much breading.  Also, it looked too much like stuffing. It needed a little bit of flavor, too.  Maybe, if I tried it again, I'd add some lemon juice or garlic or parsley.

Made these for dinner tonight --- hard to get anything faster or easier!  I didn't have any seasoned breadcrumbs, but I had some leftover mixure from another recipe (fresh bread crumbs, parmesan, garlic, and butter) and I used that instead along with the salt, pepper, and potato flakes.  I also used big ole sea scallops --- IT WAS DELISH!!  I thought at first that the potatoe flake might overshadow the scallops a bit, but not so.  This would be easy to customize with the seasonings of your choice.

My family went nuts for this recipe.  I used jumbo sea scallops.  My only change was to use olive oil in place of the canola oil and that was only because I ran out.  Thanks!!

Did not work for me!  I don't know how I could have done something wrong, but this was barely edible.  A waste of expensive scallops.

YUM! I used bay scallops & got a great result. Next time I will only use the eggs as they are needed as I had a whole omlete left over... but otherwise really terrific!

love it, this recipe is great and is very easy to make. I used bay scallops tossed them in the egg then put the batter in a ziplock bag and tossed, will definitely be using this again. Thanks.

Great recipe, my whole family liked it!  I doubled it and it was just fine.  I did add a couple tablespoons of season salt to the dry mix.  I also dipped in milk before rolling in dry mix.  Very tasty :]

I followed the recipe and my jumbo sea scallops were great they were moist, sweet and tender. I will be making these babies again.

I made breaded scallops last week and they were delicious.  So today when I saw this recipe, and read the reviews I couldn't wait to try this twist on them using the mashed potato flakes.  I did not like it.  The potato flake taste was overpowering.  I wonder if it would be better if I used less potato flakes.   The scallops also were very salty.  The scallops were from the supermarket as opposed to when I bought them last week from a fresh Fish Store.   So I wonder if possibly the quality of the scallop was also a factor in me not liking the recipe.  I will have to try it again with scallops from a Fish Store and less potato flakes.
