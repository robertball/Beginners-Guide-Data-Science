My husband and I ate the whole loaf before dinner was served. I halved the recipe for the bread machine and substituted: Butter for margarine, regular sharp cheddar-instead of low fat, half-and half instead of milk. We think the real ingredients rather than processed diet versions make for better flavor.

This was the best batch of bread I have made in my bread machine in a long time!  It turned out tender and light, not coarse and dry at all.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, so I used  1/4 tsp. chili powder and 1/8 tsp paprika, the flavor was really good.  I used shredded cheddar cheese and added it slowly into the mixing cycle, making sure it didn't clump and it turned out fine.  I should have halved the recipe for my bread machine, it was too much for my 2 lb capacity bread machine.  I used this recipe to make hoagie-sized loaves, it made for a very tasty hoagie.

Update 5/27/07: I made this over a month ago, and today I pulled a loaf out of the freezer. Thawed & reheated, it is just as flavorful and tender/chewy as it was the day I made it. Awesome bread! ***Original review 4/17/07: This bread is delicious. I made it manually, and I adjusted the ingredients by adding dill seed & dill weed and smoked sweet paprika; I did not add cayenne, marjoram, or basil. I used butter instead of margarine, and I chose an Amber Bock dark lager. The texture was slightly chewy, and the bread was fragrant with the cheese and beer aroma--made the kitchen smell wonderful.

This was just stunning. As mentioned by another reviewer, I used butter and creme instead of the lighter ingredients. And, I cubed the cheese into 1/2 squares and used a microbrew lager. The bread was amazing straight out of the machine - and even better the following day. I'll be making this recipe a lot.

Yum, yum, yum! Really great bread. We used a home brewed beer (a very dark stout) it turned out so well! perfectly spicy. I didn't use a bread machine and I added about 2/3 the amount of cheese suggested but it probably would have been good with more too. I'm not going to hesitate to say this is the best bread I've ever made. It's the first time I've made something from this site that I liked enough to rate. 5 stars!

Great flavor!  I did mix all the dry ingredients before putting them into the bread maker--I don't think it makes much difference.  If you don't care for cayenne pepper you may want to reduce the amount you put in.

I didn't use a bread machine and here is what I found. The milk curdled when added to the beer. I warmed the beer, butter and milk then added the sugar and yeast and let it set for 10 min. Then stirred in the flour and spices. I got a great rise and had no troubles. I rated it only a 3 because the flavor seemed lacking. The cheese was there but everything else just seems lost. I will try an increase in the next batch, but theer will be a next batch.

Delicious.  I put it in my bread machine, prepared soup in my slow cooker and went to work.  A delicious hot dinner with cheezy homemade bread was such a treat!

I have made it once again only this time I used some herbs in it and a combination of extra sharp cheddar and Parmesean. Fantastic

I will use half the amount of the cayenne pepper next time I make this recipe.

Also, instead of basil and marjoram, I substituted 1 teaspoon on Italian seasoning which contains each of those herbs, but a few others as well, and adds more flavor!

I also used the whole fat sharp cheddar to add more body.

My bread only needed to be baked for 45 mins instead of the entire 1 hour!

Works well with just a stand alone Kitchen Aid mixer and the oven...you don't need a bread machine!

Nice recipe. I made two loaves last night and followed the recipe except I left out the cayenne pepper (Glad I did as for me the 1 tsp of black pepper was enough for my taste buds), and marjoram (per other reviewers) and put in about 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I used butter rather than margarine and 2% milk. I forgot to split the top of the loaves and also forgot to baste the top with butter when they came out of the oven. (Hey, cut me some slack... I'm an old fart!) The dough rose beautifully on the first rise. but didn't really rise a whole lot in the pans. I started the bake at 400* and dropped it back to 350* after putting the bread on the stone. What a smell in the house! I pulled the loaves out when the crust looked nice and brown and internal temperature was right at 208*-210*. This bread has a wonderful flavor and I had it toasted, buttered, and topped with poached eggs for breakfast this morning. I'm in seventh heaven now! Next time I'll try making Eggs Benedict with this bread. That will have to be very yummy too!

So I don't have a bread machine.  And I used self-rising flour, so no yeast.  My bread didn't rise that much, but it was really delicious.  I basically just tossed in a bunch of leftover shredded cheeses that I had: mexican mix, parmesan, asiago, and romano.  I topped it with some shredded asiago cheese.  The crust was the best.  It was a great dense, savory bread.  Next time I will get yeast and see if I can make the bread "chewier."  I personally liked the taste very much, but my coworkers thought it was ok.

No bread machine but I do have a Kitchen Aid mixer. I followed the directions the best I could, warming the beer just enough to proof the yeast with the sugar in the mixer bowl for ten minutes. I added the rest of the wet ingredients, then all the dry. After the dry, I added the shredded cheese. I used Tillamook sharp white. It took another....cup and a half of flour to get the dough less pissy and to get it to grab on the hook and knead. That will happen with most homemade bread that adds cheese. This was a slow riser, for both risings it was about 4 hours, maybe more. I baked this at 350* for just under a half hour. This is a good bread, very crusty and flavorful. I just don't know if it's one of my favorites. If I do this again, I might follow the cooking method of a regular beer bread and forgo the yeast for self-rising flour. Less work and pretty much the same outcome.

So good!  I used butter and cream, like the other review said.  I also used rosmary and cumin instead of basil and majorm.  Used a little more cheese (sharp).  Wonderful.

I made this totally in the bread machine.  I've never used a bread machine before.  I didn't read the how-to's, I just dumped everything into the machine.  My bread machine has an option for a 2 pound loaf so I went with it.  Well, I guess 2 1# loaves of bread aren't the same as a 2# loaf of bread :-).  My dough rose over the top of the bin and started burning and smoking.  I had to unplug the bread maker and pull the bin out and dump it onto a sheet pan and finish it in the oven. But ... the bread was Phenomenel!!!   I added 2 diced jalpenos, dropped the cayenne to 1/2 t, didn't add marjoram or basil.  I will halve the recipe next time.   It was delicious!!!!

Followed directions to the letter.  The only change I made was added dehydrated jalapeno peppers.    Excellent.  Will make again.

I think this recipe is awesome. I tweaked the recipe because of not having some of the spices on hand.  I wraped a loaf with plastic wrap and it stayed as  fresh 5 days later as the day I baked it. 
It might sound odd but it's great toasted and topped with your favorite jam or preserves. 
As for the person who would not follow the recipe and then gave the bread a 3 star rating, SHAME ON YOU. You only showed your ignorance by complaining.

It was very tender. I didn't use cheese because my husband doesn't like cheese.  A friend had made this without the cheese because she missed the signal on her bread machine and she said it was good without the cheese. I added extra garlic and used regular budweiser beer. It didn't really have any flavor, except spiciness from the ground red pepper and black pepper.  Probably won't make again.

The first time I made this, I halved the recipe and added the ingredients to my machine.  I missed the add in beep and ended up with just beer bread, which was crispy and savory.  The second time, I made it correctly but we decided we like it better without the cheese because the flavor of the beer is stronger.

This not only smells great, but tastes great also.  I used Yeungling Lager, substituted italian seasoning for the marjoram and basil like another reader suggested, left out the cayenne but sprinkled in red pepper flakes, and used 1 tsp. of garlic powder in place of the onion and garlic powder just because that was all I had on hand.  Usually a bread smells really good but doesn't have much flavor.  Not this!  Great with soup.

A bit too heavy on the pepper for our preference.  I'll try it again cutting back on both peppers.  Really liked the texture.

this was ok....it didn't really work out for me like I thought it would, but I found the cheese too overpowering, and the bread heavier then expected. My husband really like it though.

This was so wonderful!  I used Shiner Bock, shredded cheddar, and 1% milk and it couldn't have come out better.  :)  I did turn the heat down to 325 because I was using darker loaf pans.  They only needed 45 minutes, not the hour it called for - keep an eye on them!  I will definitely make this one again soon!!!

Way too spicy!  It was so hot/spicy that I couldn't even finish it.  My husband liked it because he likes hot things.  I don't even think I put all the cayenne pepper in, either.

I ended up making two batches, because it was so good that we gave up testing the first loaf and just ate it. Really easy, very flavorful.

Delicious. Since I acquired a bread machine (instruction-less gift), I've become a lazy bread maker. I dumped all the ingredients (including an ale instead of a lager and Dublin white cheddar cubes) in the bread machine and let it go.  It came out all sorts of awesome. (I adjusted everything to make a 1.5lb loaf instead of 2 1-lb loaves, but I think the machine could handle the 2 lbs fine.  (The bread was a bit dense, but in a yummy way rather than a gross way.  It was still light and fluffy enough to be tasty.)

I've made this recipes twice now, and about to make it again this week for a Christmas Holiday gathering at work.  The previous two times these loaves have been a great hit with everyone.  These loaves are devoured quickly!  After enjoying a slice or two at one sitting, it's only a short time later you'll be fighting the urge to grab another slice (or two).  The bread is THAT good!  Both times I've made this recipe I've followed the recipe as written with no alterations, and both times the loaves have came out perfectly.  I use a heartly stronge beer, "Red Pony".  I love the flavor of this bread!  ...can't wait to make it again this week, (and keep one of the loaves for myself!).  Thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome, it was so light and the seasonings were perfect. I must admit I didn't have onion powder so I added chopped dehydrated onion flakes. My son came over just in time for the finished product and left with a loaf!

There was way too much seasoning for a cheddar bread.  The cheese (and I used sharp) was lost in the overpowering cayenne (which didn't go with basil well, in my opinion).  We ate some with baked potato soup but neither of us liked it.  Will not make again.

Really, really good.  My boyfriend devoured this at dinner.  My cheese was not dissolved but in little chunks throughout dough.  I also added chunks of garlic.  Turned out very yummy.

Fantastic!  I too used 3 cups of regular flour and baking powder/salt/sugar as suggested below.  Perfect hearty bread, almost cakey.  I had planned to make sandwiches with it, but the bread itself is so flavorful (depending on what you add) and dense that it really can stand alone.  A bit of cream cheese on a basil loaf is yummy.  Can't wait to try all sorts of sweet & savory ideas...

I love this bread!  I made it with extra sharp cheddar cheese and it was fantastic! It was a little soft, so I cut it in slices and toasted them in the oven.  They were heavenly.  We had it with beef stew.  Great for a winter night!

To make this healthier I used 3 cups 100% whole grain wheat flour and 1 cup of spelt flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I also used Kraft cheese crumbles instead of the extra-sharp cheddar; this created less work since the cheese was already crumbled.  I made a loaf and also cloverleaf rolls.  My sister used the original recipe and we both agree - this is excellent!

Really Yummy!  However, I seem to have some trouble due to me living at high elevation.  Any suggestions on how to accomodate?  Very good though!  I will pass on the recipe to my mother.

I  make many delicious breads, but this is a favorite for years!  Thank you Una!  I had to copy it again, since I misplaced my copy.  The only thing I do differently is roll the loaves in some coarsely grated cheddar and then apply an egg wash before baking.
I couldn't believe that some people review this recipe after they've left out a major ingredient!!!  You're supposed to review the recipe, not your changed recipe!
This bread deserves 5+++ stars, as is!  I'm not a fan of highly spicy, but the recipe as is is not too spicy!
Try it toasted with boiled ham & a cup of pea soup!
Again, thanks Una and forgive the ingrates that leave out ingredients, then rate it poorly!

This was amazing.  I made it in the Kitchen aid instead of the bread machine and baked it for 40 minutes at 400 degrees because I had a pot pie in the oven with it.  
Will definitely make this again.

This is a really good bread recipe.  I didn't use a bread machine but my stand mixer with dough hooks.  My biggest complaint was that it was a little too spicy for my taste.  Next time I will omit the cayenne but that's the only thing I will change.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this bread to eat with vegetarian sweet potato chili and it was a big hit with my daughter and her friend. I made a few substitutions based on the ingredients I had on hand. Used 2 tsp of Italian seasoning in place of the basil, marjoram, onion and garlic powder. I did add the cayenne and black pepper and one minced clove of garlic. I left out the cheese since I didn't have any on hand and subbed butter for margarine. The only small critic I have is the amount of black pepper is a bit overpowering. I didn't notice it so much when the bread was hot out of the oven, but once it cooled the pepper taste was prominent. Next time I'll reduce by half.

I was looking for something to do with a bottle of home-brewed beer which hadn't carbonated properly and found this.  My husband was thrilled with this bread.  I don't have a bread machine, so made it with my regular, old-fashioned method and it came out great!  Thanks so much.

I halved this, and substituted the garlic powder with one fresh pressed clove of garlic. Baked this on the regular cycle, medium crust. The cheese melted completely and made a very tasty flavorful loaf. Would probably make this again, but I might try different cheeses and beers. I think we used Michelob?

My family was fighting over every piece and I had to make another loaf the next night.  I just put in all the ingredients in my bread maker at once and let it go because I didn't have time to take it out and put it in pans.  I did warm up the beer, butter and milk though and kept the dry ingredients separated from wet. I only had light beer.  I used real butter.  It rose really high so would probably put 2 to 2.5 tsp yeast in next time.  Can't blame the recipe though as I didn't follow it as written.

I have made this bread twice and each time it has risen very slowly and not nearly as high as I would have liked.I make all my bread by hand and I can't see that as being a reason for the slow rise. I made this again last weekend but this time I added some gluten to it and it still rose slowly,it rose to a height of 2 and a quarter inches.I like the taste though,even though it's a bit on the spicy side.I'm a home brewer also and the thought of making my own bread with beer that I made really intrigued me.One more thing,looking at the pictures here of this bread it looks like I'm not the only one having trouble with this being a slow riser.I would give this recipe 4 stars if it rose better.

This bread has a nice light texture and really good flavor. The next time I make it though i'm going to halve the amount of cayenne and black pepper in the recipe. I like spicy food but the amount of pepper in this recipe threw the other flavors off balance and made it taste more like a pepper bread than a cheese one.

Great! Thanks for the recipe. We loved it. Hubby is taking a loaf and 1/2 to a dinner at work so will update after. I'm sure they will love it too!

My bread cooked in about a half hour under the suggested time, definitely watch it under the one hour, I used shredded cheese and lactaid milk and it still turned out great!

I halved this then was a little too enthusiastic with the amout of beer (I just kept pouring and unfortunately poured more than I needed), so I had to add more flour to address that, but that was all my issue.  I like this bread, but I shouldn't have added the cayenne or added only a tiny bit.  I did add less than called for, but it was still too much for me.  It isn't that spicy, but I can definitely taste the heat and nothing else, which is why I'm not a big fan of spicy foods.  I like to be able to taste the other flavors.  Otherwise, this bread was great.  I didn't have any issues with shredded cheese clumping--I just dumped the amount of shredded cheese called for in the machine and let it go.  I'm lazy like that, and I didn't really care if it clumped--but I've never had problems with that anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fair flavor, but at least for me, this recipe didn't work. I tried it twice - the first time as presented. The dough didn't rise especially well and fell dramatically in baking. The second time, I added a 1/4 cup of gluten powder and an additional tsp of yeast. It did rise better and did not fall so badly, but fall it did. For our palates, the flavor is not sufficiently exciting to justify further experimentation.

I made this recipe over the Holidays.  My husband is still talking about it.  It does make two loaves so I froze one and I'm planning to use it on the weekend with some nice thick soup.  The only change I made was I shoved some hunks of old chedddar down into the dough 30 minutes before I put them in the oven.  These hunks got all gooey...very decadent.  Una keep these recipes comin'.

I used Saranac "Black Forest" black beer, bread flour, butter, & regular (not light) shredded cheddar.  Added shredded cheddar carefully...did not clump.  At the end of dough cycle, the dough was so sticky that I had "club hands" trying to divide & shape it.  Had to add about 1/2c. more flour (all-purpose) to work with dough.  Made 2 lofty, gorgeous loaves that smelled delicious while baking.  Texture and flavor were very good.  My husband nearly polished off the first loaf.  Second loaf is in freezer for a church potluck next week.  Good recipe and one I will be making frequently.

Great bread.  I added the cheese by hand then let the loaves rise in the pans.  Baking for 1 hour at 350*F was too long, maybe 50 minutes next time.

This is an unusual but but very tasty bread. I used parmasan cheese instead of chedder & fresh herbs (rosemary, basil & parsley). The crust was lovely & crunchy & the middle soft. I cooked this in my breadmaker however the top 2cms of the loaf kind of sunk in the middle. It meant that side of the bread wasn't able to be sliced but it didn't effect the overall quality or taste.

The dough smells wonderful, but I can't get it to rise... not sure what I messed up... I don't have a bread machine, so i made it manually.

very good! I baked it in the bread machine, was too lazy to get it out and in the oven: it was ok anyway. I put real onions, shredded; the cheese dissolved completely but the taste was excellent.

I don't think the bread was too spicy at all.  It was bland.  I halved the recipe & let it bake in my bread machine (adding the cheese @ the end beep).  The bread had a hint of cayenne flavoring but no cheese flavor at all.  I don't think baking it in an oven would improve it at all so I won't be trying the recipe again.
