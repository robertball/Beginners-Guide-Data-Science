Love the ginger with the pineapple!  I used ice this time, but my family can't wait to try this with the mango!

By chance, was the caf√© in Byron Bay? If so, that place may be magic. I had the best pizza I've ever had back in 1999 while visiting there. I haven't had any standard American parlor pizza that has ever beaten it.
I had fresh mangoes hanging around the house, so I substituted the mango sorbet with chopped mango and vanilla ice cream. Also reduced the ginger (husband and guest not fans!) to 1/2 tsp. We liked it, but I can see how it would be better following the recipe. Will definitely go with the mango sorbet and at least 1 tsp. ginger next time!
