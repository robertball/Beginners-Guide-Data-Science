Wow - really nice twist on a comfort food classic! If you like the flavor of Ranch, you'll love these mashed potatoes. I used red skinned potatoes and didn't bother peeling them. I would highly recommend adding the butter and sour cream until you get the consistency you desire. I got away with using low fat ingredients and didn't have to use what the recipe called for - plus I added just a bit of skim milk and some fresh chives. These were so creamy and such a nice change from regular 'ol mashed mahsed potatoes!

These were great. Instead of making them into mashed, I combined all the inredients in a large bowl, then tossed in red potatoes that I'd chopped into 1 1/2 inch pieces an boiled until tender. I used half the butter called for, just because it didn't seem to really need it prepared this way. You can't go wrong...who doesn't like ranch?

These potatoes are DELISH!!!My kids LOVE cheese so I added a step. I cooked the potatoes about 15 min then mashed and added ingredients. Then I transfered to a baking dish and covered with cheddar cheese and put it in a 350F oven for about 10 minutes. It was WONDERFUL!!!! Thank you so much! My kids now say my mashed potatoes are better than grandma's. There is no better compliment!

I like these, they are creamy and the ranch has a nice flavor.  Be careful not to add too much salt as the ranch can be a little salty already.  Also very nice with red potatoes.

This has potential. Next time I'll try cutting back on the cream cheese, sour cream and ranch dressing by about 1/3. It was just a little over powering at full strength.

Made this last night for a husband and friend - they both liked it.  I thought it was good, but I added green onions and bacon to the original recipe.

These potatoes are as well received in our family now as they were when I first started making them many years ago.  There's just something about that (Hidden Valley) ranch dressing mix that gives these mashed potatoes their distinct and unparalleled flavor.  These potatoes, with their extra flavor, were perfect to accompany  "Traditional Stuffed Peppers," also from this site.

Excellent recipe!!  The only thing I did differently was skip the butter.  I didn't see the point to it, but other than that it was terrific.  
Suggestion: throw everything in the food processor instead of blending and mashing.  That or use your hand blender to get creamy smooth potatos.
I served this with chicken coated in a tiny bit of the ranch dressing mix I had left, some italian seasoning and pepper.  I just fried it in the frying pan with a little oil.  Brought all the flavours together!
Thanks for submitting a great recipe!!

Delicious potatoes!  I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream to cut down on the calories and it still came out yummy!  Very filling - don't need to put too many on your plate!  Will definitely make again.

The potatoes were good, but lacked the little bit of pizazz needed to be a hit. I might try them again with green onions and bacon mixed in.

Love these! They are rich, creamy, tangy and very flavorful. I used red potatoes and left the skin on. I also used reduced-fat versions of the cream cheese, sour cream and margarine. I made half a recipe and used the other half of the Ranch packet in the breading for "Heather's Best Ever Baked Chicken." The two dishes went perfectly together.

This went so well with our steak dinner tonight! I used only 1/2 pkg of dry ranch dressing and added 2 TBLS minced green onions. Loved this! Great change to mashed potatoes! Good job Sarah! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I added some garlic powder and cut the ranch dressing down.  Used red potatoes with the skins on... delicious. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think it calls for too much ranch dressing mix - too much salt.

Great recipe!!  My husband and guests loved it.  Only made 1 change.  It was too dense so I added some chicken broth to thin it up a bit.  This is going to be my mashed potato recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a very delicious and tasty recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I cut the potatoes in small cubes instead of mashing, and browned under the broiler for a few minutes.  I will definitely make these again!

I made these for our Christmas dinner, to go with ham.  They were excellent!  I didn't use sour cream, only some milk (didn't have any sour cream)--they were still AWESOME!  Definitely one to put on the "keeper" list!  Thank you Jamiesgirl, for sharing!

I absolutely LOVE these potatoes! After reading some of the other reviews, I was very cautious about how much ranch seasoning and cream cheese I added to my potatoes. For every one potato, I used one ounce of cream cheese, and that proved to be more than enough. In addition to that change, I seasoned to taste with the ranch dressing. I mixed the ranch seasoning in with the cream cheese until the ratio of cream cheese and seasoning looked to be about even. I melted butter in the microwave and poured it into the potatoes, and then I added the cream cheese/ranch mixture. I found this made it easier to mix the ingredients as the butter makes the potatoes more smooth. Even after mixing everything together, if you feel the ranch taste isn't strong enough you could still mix the mix with an additional bit of butter or cream cheese and then add it to the potatoes. I found that for me, the sour cream was unnecessary as I can't really taste it anyway. I've made these several times and just omit the sour cream altogether. I am dieting and really enjoy these potatoes because they are delicious, filling, and you can minimize the calories and fat without missing out on the taste. Use fat free cream cheese instead of regular. Instead of butter, use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter", or "Parkay Butter Spray", and melt it in the microwave first. Whenever you melt these sprays, they taste almost identical to real butter. Omit the sour cream (it really doesn't alter the taste, I promise!).

WOW! Absolutely great! I'm amazed that some reviewers have complained that the ranch flavor was too strong. This recipe has an entire packet of ranch mix, so it's going to be ranch-y tasting. Read the recipe and if ranch is not your thing, then this recipe is not for you. Now, I followed the recipe to the letter, but I used garden herb cream cheese. DELICIOUS! There is a lot of caloric content in this - but WOW - it was well worth it. Also, some have used bottled ranch dressing instead of the ranch mix and all I can say is yuck! First, I do not like bottled ranch dressing. It does not have that wonderful ranch flavor like you might find at a restaurant. If you like the ranch flavor then use the packet. It works. Also, if you find your potatoes a little too thick, then just add a little milk. Great!

YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS RECIPE!  I Doubled the amount of potatoes and left everything else the same because other reviews said the ranch and other tastes were too much.  THEY ARE PERFECT THIS WAY!  I made it for thanksgiving and we all enjoyed it!  Just enough of each ingredient was added!

I liked them, but the ranch/tangy taste was too much for the rest of my family. Maybe cut that down a little and would be better.

These mashed potatoes are absolutely the best potatoes that my husband and I have ever had.  They are so creamy and delicious ... yummm!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  You don't need to add any butter/sour cream to them once they are on your plate because they are already so rich and creamy.  Very good but don't eat too often - very fattening!

This mashed potatoes were not as good as i expected. My husband and other family members liked them but my kids and i did not. If i make them again i will definitly not use the whole 8 ounce package of cream cheese and just half of the dry ranch dressing mix. They tasted too much like cream cheese and ranch dressing for me.

I have made these many times and there’s not a spoonful leftover.  These can be made the night before and put in a casserole dish and popped in the oven to heat the next day.
This saves all the heat and hassle of mashed potatoes in the moment. Cover and refrigerate casserole overnight.

I would definitely make some changes next time but they are definitely good. I think as I've heard others say that you really need to add ingredients "to taste"  because it's just WAY too much sour cream for my taste. I'd cut it down to a tablespoon rather than 1/4 c. Of sourcream. Or even omit the sourcream altogether.

I struggled a little with this recipe because potatoes come in all different sizes making 8 potatoes a very vague measurement.  After some trial and error, I've decided that 4 pounds of potatoes is the right amount to work with the other ingredients.  I poked around at some other recipes that indicated 6 pounds would be better, but I thought that ratio was too bland.  With 4 pounds, it was very flavorful!

These were really good.  Made as recipe stated but added bacon bits and cheddar cheese on top, cuz I had a taste for that, and then baked for about 15 minutes.  The ranch mix made it very salty so beware! Glad I checked so I didn't add extra. Had these with slow cooker country ribs and green beans. Yum!

I just made this for supper and forgot to put the sour cream in it and didn't even realize it till afterwards when I was washing dishes. They were awesome!! So, if you have everything but the sour cream but want those ranch potatoes go for it!!

I seriously will never make this again.  It tasted purely like sour cream ranch dip.  I tried to add pepper and more butter and even another potato to tone down the sour cream but it didn't work.  The only thing good was the texture - very very smooth!

I truly don't think I shall make mashed potatoes any other way from now on. It's like eating sour cream and onion potato chips, but mashed! Easy, not too much extra cost, and just delicious! I could add more cheese if I wanted, but you don't need to with these. Thanks for the idea!

I made this recipe exactly, except i scaled it down to only 2 servings. It was VERY bland, and almost BITTER??? I think it was because of the ranch seasoning, but I added a couple shakes of seasoning salt and it made it edible enough to finish.

Very ranchy!  I used lowfat sour cream and cream cheese and they turned out great.  The only thing I will change next time is to add a few more potatoes to make the ranch flavor a little lighter.

These are the BEST potatoes I have ever eaten! I am also pregnant and NOTHING sounds good to eat to me but I almost made myself sick by eating 3 helpings of these for dinner! Can't wait to make them again. I did not have any of the packaged ranch so I just used regular Ranch dressing, worked GREAT!

I thought these potatoes were great, not too ranchy at all.  The only changes I made was to use a five pound bag of yellow potatoes and I left the skins on.

These are great mashed potatoes! I agree with the other reviewers, it's pretty ranchy. I would only use 3/4 packet of ranch mix next time, but everyone loved them! Definte crowd pleaser, its mashed potatoes with some tastly flavor!

WOW!  These potatoes are amazing!  They were perfect, and I loved how you could taste the cream cheese and the ranch!  It was a great combination that will make over and over again!

Made these for Easter and everyone loved them. Used light everything though, light cream cheese, light sour cream, and light butter. Still came out fabulous!

Absolutely delicious. I used a hand mixer so that my potatoes were light and creamy. They tasted so good.  I agree with another reviewer that said the ranch taste is VERY strong, next time I may use 3/4 of a packet instead of the whole packet.  Either way they were excellent! Thanks Sarah!

These potatos turned out very well, but the next time, I won't use as much ranch dressing. It was just a little too much for me.

Really good, esp. if you like ranch.  They were a little heavy even after cutting the butter in half.  Next time I may sub in milk for the cream cheese as that may take care of it.  But excellent recipe...definately a keeper.

I bake these babies in the oven for about a half hour on 350-375 then sprinkle shredded cheese over top and bake until melted.  DEEELISH.....just be careful to use a tall baking dish because the sour cream makes this dish puff up while baking.   Also, the potatoes stay extrememly hot for quite some time, so test before serving.

Excellent recipe. I used red potatoes and left the skin on. I also added bacon pieces. Everybody loved it. I didn't really pay too much attention to adding exact amounts of potatoes. But I did for all the other ingredients. Next time I'll add some garlic because, we all love garlic also.
This is a recipe we will make many more times.
Thanks for sharing.

We really enjoyed these potatoes! Very tasty. The Ranch was a little overpowering for me. I think next time I make these, I'll use more potatoes and plan on leftovers.

These were amazing!  I'm not the biggest potato fan, but I couldn't stop eating them.  Everyone in the family loved them.  I didn't use the butter (seemed like enough fat without it), and I left the skin on the potatoes, but followed the rest of the recipe, then added green onions and freshly ground black pepper.  Fantastic!

This was so easy and delicious! I made as the recipe was written but did as another reviewer did and put it in the oven with cheese on top. It would have been just as delish without this extra step. Thanks for sharing.

These were ok, but there was something missing. I think it needed more salt or something. I used with Instant potoatoes because it was all I had. After cooking I added in cream cheese, sour cream, and Ranch dressing. The mashed potatoes were really runny so I added some milk and heated them more. They were pretty good, but like I said they were missing something. I will have to do a little experimenting to see if I can improve the taste to my liking. Thanks for the recipe though!

This is very decadent and rich.  A nice alternative for mashed potatoes sometimes.  I did not have any ranch dressing, but I used everything else.  It tasted wonderful and I'm sure the ranch would just make it better!

I cut this recipe in half & everyone really enjoyed it - even our 8 yr. old who's pretty picky. It has a strong ranch flavor and is very good reheated. I'm going to play around with it though to see if I can make it a little healthier but thats the only downfall.

This was great, wanted something different and this did the trick. I had done ranch potatoes before but never with the cream cheese and sour cream, that just really enhanced the flavor my boyfriend couldnt stop talking about them.

I almost never make a recipe exactly as it is called for, this one being no exception. I used red potatoes, and modified the amounts of cream cheese and ranch seasoning, and substituted a bit of milk inplace of sour cream (even though sour cream has always been a good addition to mashed potatoes,I didn't want these to be quite that rich). They turned out awesome! I will definantely experiment with these ingredients again.

First things, these turned out rather dry, and I had to add milk to make them real creamy.  But after I did, they were fantastic!  I don't have a hand mixer, which may have been to blame.  My husband loved them.  Thanks!!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and it was my first Thanksgiving cooking for a large group and it was my first married Thanksgiving and I'm a young 22 so I was indimated, but this was a hit for everyone, since were a USAF couple we cooked for a bunch of airmen that didn't have families, and they all can't wait for me to make this dish this Thanksgiving.

I made this as part of a Valentine's dinner for my girlfriend. This is an easy tasty way to make mashed potatoes. Great flavour from the cream cheese and dressing mix. My girlfriend and I loved this!

These are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The recipe is SO easy and tastes so good you don't even need to serve them with butter, gravy or sour cream.  I wish it wasn't so unhealthy for you, otherwise I would eat them much more often!  EVERYONE I've served them to has loved them!

LOVED this recipe!!  Followed it exactly, except cutting the amount of butter in half like others suggested.  I made it with a ham, and wanted potatoes that I wouldn't have to make gravy for, and these fit the bill perfectly.  Surely will keep this recipe!

I love this.  I added more ranch seasoning to my own portion of the potatoes because I like it stronger.

We love potatoes and have them often. This was a
great addition to our potatoe recipe collection.
I served this with Brown Sugar Meatloaf and it was
great.
