I used one large frozen banana and skipped the ice. Good but a really runny smoothie. I would make this again but I would drain the pineapple first.

This recipe was very creamy!  I cut the recipe and half and had more than enough.  I also used twice the number of ice cubes because i like my smoothies with more ice, but it is truly up to you.

This was okay, but pretty flavorless.  I make smoothies for breakfast every morning and all of them have more flavor than this.

We really like this recipe. I too found that adding a tablespoon or 2 of honey helped boost the flavor. I use vanilla yogurt sometimes too. Adding a few strawberries really makes it good! Thanks for the recipe.

A very good recipe but works much better and has more flavour without the ice.

Pretty good.  I'm an avid smoothie maker and find that using frozen fruit is a good way to avoid using the ice which can water down the drink if you're not careful.

Yummy. I used an 8 ounce can of pineapple tidbits, since that's what I had, and it turned out just right. Any more and it would have been too pineappley. I also added a little honey. My 3-year-old thought it was a real treat.

Yummy! My four-year old loved this! I didn't have ice cubes, but used a frozen banana and that seemed to work fine.

Simple and very tasty.  I added a little less oj (didn't actaully measure it) because I like my smoothies thicker, but that's just personal preference.  Give this a try!

I cut the recipe in half (used an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple) and it still made a really tall glass full. Full recipe could easily serve 3-4.  I found this smoothie to be very refreshing but quite tart, so I added 3 packets of Splenda.

My kids rated this 5 stars. I thought it was about 3 1/2 - 4. Quite good flavour, but pineapple is kind of overwhelming for me. I used one tin of pineapple pieces plus juice, doubled the oj (using concentrate and water) used 2 large frozen bananas and four small kiddy tubs of vanilla yogurt. I only used 8 iced cubes instead of 16 because my bananas were frozen and so I added just a bit more water. Great idea to use a tin of pineapple, though. My eldest calls is pineapple smoothie - the taste is so prominent.

I used peach yogurt 'cause that's what I had. Good flavor, nice and creamy. I did use less ice also. 4 not 5 stars 'cause I didn't like the texture from the crushed pinapple too much, next time I think I'll use orange-pineapple juice.

Very good, will definitely make again. I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used vanilla, and it was really good. The kids loved it.

This smoothie had great flavor but not as thick i as would have liked it. I added a can of mandarin oranges with juice instead of orange juice. Overall my family enjoyed this and we will make it again.

Tried it today.  Flavors not balanced.  I don't recommend it.
