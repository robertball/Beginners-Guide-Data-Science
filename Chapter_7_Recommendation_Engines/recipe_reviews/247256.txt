I mixed the ingredients in a 2 cup glass measuring cup so I could pour directly into the frying pan.  By the way, this recipe makes exactly 2 cups of crêpe batter.  Quick and very easy to make, these crêpes are light and buttery.  Very good!  I will make again for sure!  Thanks  Buckwheat Queen for a terrific gluten-free  crêpe recipe!

Tried this recipe.  My oldest ate pizza crepes to capacity, and my youngest started with strawberry and nutella and finished with bannana and nutella.  This recipe rocks.  

My kids will eat crepes several times a week, and they enjoy the sweet and the meal, like chicken and veggies.  There is nothing like adding a new staple to the menu options!

Used Bobs Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour.  Looking forward to trying rice flour, as I have read great things about it.

Great tasting gluten free crepes recipe. I used Bob's red mill gluten free flour mix. I will try with other filings, too. Quick and easy to make!
