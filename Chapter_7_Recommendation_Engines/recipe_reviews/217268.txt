Ummm, "Bookmarker" - Not sure why you are rating something you haven't tried.  It says right in the description that this is a Taste of Home recipe!  And the amount of flour isn't the only change - so is the addition of the heath.

This is a very easy and simple recipe.  I used semi sweet choc chips for dipping as I think almond bark is too sweet.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to it as it adds to the distinctive taste that cookie dough has.  Thanks for sharing!

If you have ever made the frozen cookie dough balls from this site, you must make these.  These are even better with the addition of the toffee bits.  The dough was very easy to work with, and I had no problem rolling it into balls.  I made the balls and then refrigerated them over night.  In the morning, I dipped them in the melted chocolate and topped some with more toffee bits, and others with chocolate jimmies.  My family and friends couldn't stop eating these, and the recipe was requested several times.  These are perfect for parties.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

These are really good, but you don't need the whole can of sweetened condensed milk.  You only need 1/4 cup.  If you make this change, you can also reduce the amount of flour to 1 and 1/4 cups.  The dough is much easier to work with if you make these changes.  You won't get as many truffles, but they work out better.  I always freeze them for about 2 hours before dipping too.  I do not use toffee bits, just the mini chips.  These also turn out just the same using fat free sweetened condensed milk.  These work really well in the cookie dough cupcakes on the site too!

Before dipping the dough, it may taste rather strongly of the condensed milk, after dipping though you can hardly tell a difference between regular cookie dough and this. I followed previous advice and added a pinch of baking soda to make it taste more like regular cookie dough. I also added just a hint more vanilla and 1/4 a cup of my flour was whole wheat. Of course refrigeration, or even freezing, is necessary. This recipe takes time! I would not recommend pulling all of the dough balls out at once to dip because they will warm up before the first half are dipped in the chocolate. Diabetics be warn! This is a VERY sweet dessert that is hard to stay away from. I also used tooth picks to dip the balls for a much neater and professional looking chocolate coating. You may also need to frequently re-microwave the chocolate to keep it nice and liquidy.

I must have done something wrong because these were not good at all.  I chilled my dough, rolled into balls, froze the balls, dipped and returned to fridge.  When I put them out to serve they were just gooey inside within minutes.  Nobody liked them.

The recipe is absolutely delicious, though the batter was mush for me. I followed the recipe to a T and could not form them at all. I managed to freeze 10 of them and get them in chocolate without them flattening/melting. If I could figure out why the batter was so liquidy and mush, I would remake them and rate it better. But I dont know what made it to where the balls were just impossible to form..

This is a great recipe to make with kids.  I made a couple of adaptations to make it both gluten free and egg free to accommodate all of the food allergies in our family.

The changes are:  
Increase butter to 3/4 cup
Add 2 1/4 cups gluten free all purpose flour
Add 1/2 tsp Xanthum gum

I made the dough and then refrigerated it for an hour.  Then I greased my hands and shaped the dough into balls.  I froze the balls over night.  
In the morning, I dipped them in melted semi-sweet chocolate with just a bit of shortening.  My kids had a blast decorating the dipped truffles as mice, ladybugs, monsters, etc. . . using sprinkles, coconut, M&Ms, and cake decorating materials.

I am teaching myself to be a baker/candy maker, so every week I try out a new recipe and bring the results to the people at my mom's work. I was told by both family and co-workers that these were the BEST treats I had ever brought(and they were up against a lot!)! I used chocolate chips for the coating, making some white, some milk, and some semi-sweet! All were fabulous! They were so easy and fun to make and absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

So easy and fun for the kids to make.  I bet you could lighten it with fat free milk and light butter--will try that next time.  Easy to improvise with ingredients too.  We used crushed Heath bar and added some graham cracker crumbs.  My husband thinks they're better than buckeyes!

YUMMO!  Really enjoyed this!  Didn't have any problems with forming the balls as long as we popped them into the freezer every now and then - totally worth the effort.  Previous reviewer commenting about the flour - get a grip!  We've eaten cookie dough with raw eggs and "uncooked" flour since we could walk - never had a problem and neither have the zillions of other people who do the same thing!Thanks for the recipe!  Will use again!

So awesome!  Easy peasy to make and to "get rid of".  I didn't have any problems with the dough holding shape.  I am going to dip them in melted chocolate chips next time tho, so that the hardened chocolate will stand up to room temp a bit longer.

I did not care for this recipe. Firstly, the dough is too sticky and liquid and more like batter than dough. I had to add a lot of extra flour to get them to even be rollable. The texture and consistency of the finished product is unappealing, not at all like cookie dough, but just sort of mushy. I quit rolling and dipping them halfway through, because it really is that tedious. The chocolate takes forever to drop the excess off enough not to create a little pool of it underneath each ball. Everything sticks, I tried forks, toothpicks, spoons... No luck to get them to stay round and smooth, they're lumpy because I can't get them to unstick. I will make these some other time using a normal cookie dough recipe without the eggs.

If you love the taste of raw cookie dough then this recipe is for you.  If not, then pass on this.  I'm not the biggest fan of cookie dough but in a bite size piece I thought I'd really enjoy it.  I didn't.

These are such a treat.    I put the dough in the refrigerator and roll the balls by hand. I also found a tip that recommended breaking the center tines out of plastic forks to form a dipping tool for applying the chocolate coating.  I keep the melted chocolate in the top of a double boiler as I work. It is nice to have a helper to decorate the candies with sprinkles because the coating hardens quickly. They can be stored in the freezer.

These tasted really good!  My only complaint was in the texture, which was almost like eating raw cookie dough.  Next time I might use a little less of the condensed milk to compensate.  I will definitely make them again, particularly because the texture didn't really seem to bother anyone else.

The taste is good but mine totally flattened out.  Looks like a little thin cookie.  Followed recipe exactly.  :(

A bit gooey at first but firmed up nicely and no issues once covered in chocolate. Served at a party and everyone raved about these!

Made it in my food processor with the dough blade, adding the condensed milk until the desired texture was reached, using about 3/4 of condensed milk can.  I also added caramel, since I had no toffee bits.   Thanks for the great recipe, I've been looking for one like this for a while.  I'm certain the dough will be great for chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream as well!

I choose this recipe as part of a truffle dessert tray I was making for a work potluck and these were the first ones gone.  I did struggle a lot making these.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the baking soda that others suggested and I'm glad I did, but I chilled the dough and rolled the balls, but it was so sticky and the balls started to loose shape so quickly.  I froze the balls overnight and re-rolled them which was much easier, but they still got soft so quickly I had to keep putting them back in the freezer.  Next time I'll try not adding the whole can of milk and see if they can hold up a little better because of course everyone at work wants me to make them again.

Good recipie, but I added a little extra flour as the dough was a bit slimy.  I also added some salt and baking soda so the flavor didn't fall flat.  A traditional cookie dough recipe has both those ingredients, so, makes sense. Also, the chocolate coating you use to dip them in, makes a big difference.  Cheap coatings are waxy and don't taste as good, so spend a little extra for the better quality.

I found making the balls about half the size greatly improved them, they are much more decadent  in small pieces as I find the truffle itself to be kind of grainy

I thought these were very easy to make, and delicious!  I did use fat free sweetened condensed milk.   I took these to a party and had a lot of compliments on them.  Thanks!

Worked we'll undipped for s'mores. Melted bag of semi sweet w shortening. Covered most. Used small scoop and then tore in half for small balls. I think I've liked other similar recipes better but keeping around for now.
