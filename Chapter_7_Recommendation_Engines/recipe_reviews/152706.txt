Yes, it is a "cakey" cookie.  However, if you want a firmer, denser (less-cakelike) cookie, substitute a stick of softened butter for the applesauce.  While I do sub applesauce often b/c it lowers the fat content...it also changes the texture of baked goods, creating a spongey texture.  You can also do 1/4 c. applesauce, 1/4 cup butter or oil.  I increased the spices and added 1/2 tsp. of ginger, too.  A browned butter icing is yummy drizzled over tops.  Just brown a bit of butter until it's nutty brown and beat in a bit of powdered sugar until it's your desired consistancy. Next time I make these, I will sandwich them with marshmallow fluff beat with cream cheese.  Excellent "fall" whoopie pies.

While very easy to make and a nice flavor, I would call these individual cakes, not cookies. The "cookies" don't spread out when they bake so the first pan took much longer to bake and came out in the exact "spoonful" shape they went in. Flattening them before baking helped with the second pan, but still they came out airy, light, and very moist... just like cake.

Eh...I agree with another reviewer - good flavor...but they're SOOO cakey.  Much cakier than even cake-mix cookies.  

Things to know - the batter will not be very firm, it's very hard to form the cookies.  However, they don't spread at all on the pan, surprisingly enough.  To avoid greasiness, I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pans.

Definitely a cake-like cookie, but that is exactly what I would expect from a cookie made from a cake mix. Very good blend of flavors!  I'm considering putting icing between pairs of them and making my own "cakesters" for the kids.  I made these to use up a spice cake mix and they did not disappoint!

Great Cookies!  The taste was wonderful, the texture, as said by others, cakey.  I used my cookie scoop to make them uniform in size and they were perfect.  Will make these again.  I take them all to work and everyone said this one was a keeper!

Very good, the kids have been picking them off the cooling rack and are gone in seconds.  I followed the suggestions from a previous reviewer, used margarine instead of applesauce (wanted a more cookie-like than cake-like) and 1/4 t. of ginger.  I had to bake for 10-12 minutes instead of 8-10, might be because we have a gas oven.  Will make again, and soon!  Thanks for a good and easy recipe.

Really good - I just may eat them all before anyone comes home!  I did add some chopped walnuts and pecans to one batch, which made them even better to my liking - just depends on your preference.  I sprinkled some washed raw sugar on top before baking, which gave it more of that muffin top taste.  Perfect for that fall baking craving!!

Just what I was looking for to quench my pumpkin craving! I didn't have any spice cake mix so I used yellow and just upped the spices buy 1 1/2. They are so good I hope I don't eat them all tonight.

Me, my family, and friends love these cookies. I call them pumpkin pillows, because they are so fluffy and light. I use  store-bought cream cheese frosting and drizzle it over the cookies. Perfection!

Not really thrilled with these "cookies". I wish I had read the reviews before I made them.  They are definately more like a muffin than a cookie.  The taste is ok but I am not thrilled with it.  It would have been just as easy for me to make cookies from scratch.  They are just OK but will not make them again.

I read the reviews before making this cookie, so I was expecting a cake-like cookie.  However, I don't think these can even be called a cake-like cookie, and I love cake-like cookies.  The flavor is just okay and the texture is definitely more like a light muffin.  I'm thinking of drizzling some sort of glaze over them & calling them mini muffin tops.  Maybe changing the name, and therefore the expectation, will help them be enjoyed more.  If I do make them again, I might try no eggs, or just one, and maybe add some softened raisins or dried cranberries to punch up the flavor.

Oh my, these are soooo good!  Our local Kroger Grocery Store sells a "muffin top cookie" and this recipe is the closest I have found to replicating them.  I will admit I used a yellow cake mix, cinnamon applesauce, almond extract and pumpkin pie spice.  The results were sensational and I am going to use this as a base to make orange cranberry ones next time.  That said, these totally satisfied my need for something autumn-y and pumpkin-y!

These are great tasting and the recipe was so easy. I agree with previous reviews, these cookies are 'cakey', but that didn't matter to me, and I see how they can get 'rubbery'. They are best eaten the day you make them, but I'm still enjoying them 2 days later. The batter is very wet, I was afraid they were going to spread and burn, but the weird thing is, they stayed EXACTLY the  way I dropped them onto the cookie sheet, so beware if you want them to look nice and uniform! I topped these with a cream cheese frosting - yuuuuummmmm!

These are just like the other reviewers described. Muffin Tops. Added Chocolate Chips and baked for 12 minutes in my gas oven. 14 year old gives them five stars. 17 year old said 4 stars. They smell good. Would be better as muffins.

These were a hit at a potluck, everyone wanted the recipe!  I put a little bit of whipped cream cheese frosting on to give it a little color, I think it also helped the flavor.  yes these are "cakey" but you're using a packaged cake mix, it should be kind of expected.  Will be making again!

BEYOND cake-y. However, they do make very nice muffins.

I used a sugar free cake mix, and added an extra egg and made muffins. YUMMY :)

I used Pumpkin Spice Kisses to top them off which made them very pretty! I also rolled them with sugar before baking them (they are very sticky so I used 2 spoons to scoop and shape them, as well as dipping them in the sugar!  Didn't have to get my hands sticky this way!)  These are an easy and fun fall cookie. I'm not sure why there is any confusion...these are cake mix cookies so they will have a cake-like texture (not your normal "cookie" texture but more of a sponge-like feel to them!)  I like them cold from the refrigerator!

Just a tiny bit too cake like for me, but then again what do you expect with a cookie recipe with cake mix?

This was a very yummy recipe.  I didn't have the apple sauce so I used butter.  I've also tried spice cake and yellow cake and I think I prefer the yellow cake with extra spices added.  It is a very fluffy cookie, so expect that.  After baking they tasted like they need a little something so I drizzled a little glaze (powdered sugar mixed with milk) over them and they turned out nice!

SUPER EASY! These would be perfect for woopie pies. I used German Chocolate Cake Mix and added some instant coffee to make Pumpkin Mocha Cakesters. So moist!! I also used oil instead of apple sauce.

Oh man, these are soooo tastey and easy to make!  They are essentially little pieces of spongy cake, but who cares when they taste this great?!

I made this exactly as the recipe was written, but I had to bake these for 30 minutes before they were truly done.  They are VERY cakey, not like a cookie at all, and not as sweet as most cookies.  They are okay, but I would not take the trouble to make them again.

Since several people mentioned that these were more like cake instead of cookies, I decided to make mini-muffins out of them!  I had a carrot cake mix that I needed to use up before the end of the month, so I used that and added all the other ingredients in the recipe as well as a few chopped almonds.  I put papers in my mini muffin pans, sprayed them with cooking spray and dropped a heaping tablespoon of batter in them.  It took about 15 minutes for these to bake and made approximately 60 mini-muffins.  When they cooled slightly, I mixed up powdered sugar, a little vanilla extract, Ghee (clarified butter), milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon and drizzled that over the muffins.  I ate three before I could stop myself!  These were excellent as little muffins.  I will definitely make this again.

I made these with 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil in place of the applesauce. Sprinkled with sugar and used kisses on top. The pumpkin spice kisses made the cookies taste very bitter. The chocolate kisses were a bit better, but not worth wasting a can of pumpkin on when I have so many awesome recipes!

Try it with a chocolate cake mix! Wow. With the pumpkin purée and spices these mini cakes are heavenly. I'm adding a dab of banana icing and some toasted pumpkin seeds to make them look healthy. Will try different textures next time tweaking the eggs and applesauce.

These tasted EXACTLY like pumpkin pie! I subbed margarine for the applesauce, added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, ground cloves and nutmeg. Also, I used one less egg. The result were very smooth (albeit soft and slightly sticky) cookies that tasted amazing. Will definitely make again!

Whether you like these or not will probably depend on what you're looking for. I used a stick of butter rather than the applesauce to end up with something less cake like. I still ended up with little "cakeys." If I use this recipe again, I will probably make as muffins. I used a carrot cake mix, and didn't add the other spices, because I was making them for children. Flavor is good! They could use a little punching up with some chocolate or white chocolate chips. Not bad, but not 5 stars either. Make them as muffins with a cream cheese frosting:)

Based on the cake like consistency, I went with muffins instead of cookies and baked for about 20 minutes.  I also added cinnamon chips and raisins.  A true winner!  My mom does these as mini-muffins too, and they are a great bite size treat.

Incredible! I made one change to the recipe. As another reviewer suggested to substitute applesauce for butter. Since I didn't have applesauce, I used 1/3 cup butter and they turned out to be the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! Plus they are so easy to make.
