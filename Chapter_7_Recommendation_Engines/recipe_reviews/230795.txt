This turned out pretty good. After reading the other review about it being very sweet, I decided to reduce the brown sugar by half. It was still pretty sweet. I ended up adding more vinegar to tone it down. I loved the addition of cilantro and I plan to play around with this recipe some more. Ketchup is sweet too so my first change will be to replace it with tomato sauce. My favorite bottled BBQ sauce is from Kansas City and it has a lot of celery seed in it so I'll some of that next time as well. Overall good recipe but unless you like yours super sweet I recommend scaling back on the sugar.

This was very good on some breaded chicken.  It is very sweet though. The only change I made was to replace the habenaro with jalepino, because it was all I had, and it was still very good. Almost like a tangy/spicy BBQ sauce. The cilantro gives it a nice touch because I love cilantro as well.
