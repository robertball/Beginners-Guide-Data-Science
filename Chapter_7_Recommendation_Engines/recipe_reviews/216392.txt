We have been making this casserole for years, and it pleases both the savory & sweet crowd at brunch! You will love this recipe as written, but I have made modifications over the years that are also good. I prefer to use Jimmy Dean's Maple Sausage for added sweetness. I have also used cinnamon swirl, sourdough, and cinnamon raisen bread in place of the French bread, and I think they're all great. I also prefer to use Granny Smith (tart) or Honey Crisp apples for their crisp texture, and top with Gruyere cheese instead of cheddar (but both are great). TIP: Make it the night before you want to serve it, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Then pull it out and let it sit on your counter for 30 - 45 minutes before you pop it in the oven. Great for Christmas morning, so you can sit by the tree instead of in your kitchen!

This was absolutely delicious.  I made a few variations.  Cooked sausage links, chopped up and added an extra cup.  I also added extra apples, sugar and cinamon, 1 cup of chopped walnuts and some nutmeg.  I used three kinds of bread, french, cinamon and wheat.  I only used 1/2 of the cheese that was called for.  I made it the night before and stored it in the fridge until I baked it the next morning.  It came out awesome!

This was my first attempt at a Breakfast Casserole and it turned out great! I used twice the apples, Jimmy Dean Maple flavored sausage and used raisin bread instead of French bread, as another reviewer had suggested. I drizzled maple syrup over mine as I have a SWEET tooth. My boyfriend - who is more for savory - preferred his without syrup and had THREE helpings. He LOVED this, haha. I will be making this again, I may even add some raisins next time as they were sooooo good in the bread. This dish did taste best once it "sat" for about 15-20 mins out off the oven. Looking forward to having this again on Christmas morning, thanks.

This delicious casserole tastes like french toast with apples, sausage, and cinnamon-y sweetness.  **My variations: --I always add extra apple dices (the recipe doesn't call for enough, IMO) --I go a little lighter on the cheese (to preserve the sweet, french-toast-y flavor --I use homemade whole wheat bread instead of white french bread, which results in a more solid (less soggy) french toast texture --I store it in the fridge already baked (not before baking, as the recipe says) and then the next day, I slice it and bake it up in the toaster oven for extra crispy exterior.  The small, as it toasts, is amazing! :)

We didn't like this much at all.  It was too bready.  Like bread pudding with sausage and apples.  The flavors just didn't blend well or mesh with our tastes.

This is good. I thought it was better after it had set for 20 minutes instead of just 10. One of those better the next day dishes. :)

This was fantastic.  I wanted a different spin on the typical breakfast casserole and when I saw this one I had to try it.  Everyone loved it!  I drizzled some syrup over the top before serving it.  I also used granny smith apples instead of Golden Delicious.  I will be making this again.

Easy to make.  A nice combination of sweet and savory flavors.  Substituted asiago bread cubes for some of the french bread, which made it better.  Also used mild italian sausage that I already had cooked.  Definitely serve with syrup to balance the flavors.

This is unusual and good. My friends liked it better than I did. I only used 1/2 the amount of cheese and just poured some maple syrup on it right out of the oven for a little sweetner. That's easier than serving it separately.

We were disappointed.  It sounded so delicious, but the end result seemed bland and my family did not like very much.  Noone ate the leftovers.  I did follow one user's recommendation and tried it using cinnamon raisin bread, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I don't know what might have gone wrong, because it sure sounded good -- but didn't taste at all like what I had anticipated.

Very easy and REALLY GOOD! I've never made a breakfast casserole...I'm hooked. Had to use what I had on hand. I cut recipe in half and used wheat bread instead of French bread, browned up 8oz pork sausage and I didn't have any shredded cheddar. I used 1 1/2 cps 4 cheese italian and dotted some velvetta cheese on top with alittle more 4 cheese italian. I always have an apple on hand and used a mutsu apple.....this baked up wonderful and now I can't wait to make it the way the recipe calls for. I used an 8x8 pan in the toaster oven. My husband loved it!!!

In step 2 it tells you what to do with the apples.  You add to the mixture.

I used maple flavored sausage. Made the house smell AWESOME! I assembled the night before so it was easy cheesy to pop in the oven in the morning. The bread seemed a bit soggy so take heed with what other reviewers recommend by letting it sit before eating- it got more dense the longer it sat. If I reviewed yesterday I would've given it 3 stars. But the fact that while in church I could smell maple in my head and was looking forward to leftovers raised it  to a 4 star review!  I will be making this again!! Loved the apples and sausage!

The cheese in this dish did not sound good to me, but I made the recipe as it calls. I was very surprised to see how good this was. You MUST use the maple syrup!!! This dish is very good and serves several people.

Very yummy overall and got a lot of compliments on this one. However, 1) I thought this really needed salt. I made this twice and the second time added 1 tsp. salt which really improved the flavor, I thought. 2) I left it in the oven for more like 1 hr to really get a nice golden brown everywhere. 3) Definitely needs longer than 10 minutes to sit after baking. With those modifications, definitely a keeper!

Made this without pork sausage. I used turkey sausage for the wife. I also didn't peel the apples I just diced them up. Really good for a Sunday Brunch. The Pretty One & me ate almost the whole thing in one sitting. I may make one for the hungover partiers the day after St Pattys Day.

Definitely a keeper!  EVERYONE thoroughly enjoyed this for Christmas morning brunch! Inasmuch as I LOVE maple syrup, I enjoyed this without the syrup.  Sides of pepperocini and/or pickled asparagus compliment this recipe.  As a leftover, I enjoyed it warm or straight out of the frig ... GREAT finger food!  lol

I felt this recipe had too much bread in it.  I would have liked it more custardy and I'm not sure I like the choice of cheddar cheese in here.  If I make this again, I might try another kind of cheese and definitely cut the bread down by at least a 1/3.  Somehow the flavors in this recipe just didn't come together for me like I expected they would.

This was all right. As other reviewers have said, this was a very bread-heavy meal. 

I personally did not use the Sausage Crumbles, as I had a one pound tube of sausage in the freezer, and used this instead. 

If I were to remake the recipe, I would likely do the same, though I'd pick a more seasoned sausage. I would also replace the apples with a more strongly flavored apple, like Granny Smiths. The Golden Delicious apples just disappeared into this recipe. I'd also cut the bread by at least one cup, adding more apple and cinnamon. 

Overall, a decent recipe, but not something I would make again. It wasn't work dirtying so many dishes over.

Made this for my granddaughters (5, 7, and 9 yrs.) for brunch today.  They can be picky at times, but they all liked it.  I did add extra apples and used half of the cheese in the casserole and half on top.  We did not have crumbles, so browned a pound of sausage instead.  Will make again.

Tried this on my family for our Christmas breakfast.  Even the children loved it.  It could have been the addition of the syrup they liked.  Added chopped onions and peppers to the recipe.  Great for a quick breakfast.

This casserole came out delicious.  I made it the day before and since it was right from refrigerator to oven it took longer  than expected. I baked at 325 for an hour and 15 minutes. 
The only things I changed was less cheese. I mixed in some but did not add more on top and used Granny Smith apples as I like the firmness and tartness.  It was a nice change of pace from our usual breakfast casserole of toast, sausage, egg. & cheese.

This turned out beautifully and was delicious.  I used a heavy corning ware baking dish and baked at 350 for 55 minutes and it browned beautifully. It almost looked like it had risen a bit which made it look very appetizing.

I made this for the first time this weekend and it was a huge hit. People were surprised to find the apple. Definitely serve with maple syrup. It's a nice mix of French Toast and sausage / egg casserole.

My family was not crazy about this combination of sweet elements with cheese and sausage.

My kids and I liked this, but my husband did not!  He did not like the flavor combination.

Made this for 2012 Christmas morning and everyone liked it. Nice change from breakfast sausage casserole (croutons, mushroom soup, etc) and easy to make. I used English Muffin Toast bread cut into cubes which had more body than bread since I didn't have french bread. Worked great! Some liked it plain, or with maple syrup as suggested. Will make it again but will add in sauted onions for a bit more flavor.

This was good Thanksgiving morning BUT the next day it was really good.  We will make it the night before and bake it in the morning next time as the ingredients need time to meld together.

I made this for a retired teacher breakfast and have had severalrequests for the recipe.....they loved it.  Made a few changes to recipe...used regular whole wheat bread and rather than using crumbles I  browned a pound of bulk pork sausage. Will make it again.

I've made this a few times now, and it's always good. I personally buy uncooked sausage (made for slicing), then cook that, breaking it up into crumbles. It's a lot less expensive, and though it adds time on to the preparations, it's not that bad. I've used turkey sausage, fat free or low-fat cheese, whole wheat bread (or rolls), and even pears as alternatives. All of it has been good.

Made this for a womens' brunch at my church. When I got there, there were about 8 or 10 other casseroles and I was sure I would be bringing most of mine home. When I went to get what was left of mine................it was GONE!

I enjoy cooking more when the recipe is easy to follow and all/most ingredients on hand. This recipe was so easy to put together and my family loved it. I did not have French bread but used what I had, whole wheat, and it stood just fine. I also cut recipe in half and had no problems. I also took advice from other reviews and allowed it to sit a bit longer and added walnuts.
