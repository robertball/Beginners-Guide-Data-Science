Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!  Truly an easy recipe and very tasty.  I did however add about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water just to make a little bit more broth and about 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic.  Truly a favorite from now on!

Absolutely wonderful..  I also added a couple of large chunks of celery while steaming..  You can grill thick slices of crusty bread rubbed with a clove of garlic to dip in the tasty juices..

Followed this to the letter...flavor was all there...something was missing... chorizo was dominant where I thought the clams should have been...This would make a great base for a soup or chowder.

Hubby thought this was absolutely fabulous! Used beer instead of wine, added small red potatoes and a few red pepper flakes. Thank you Star!

These clams were awesome! Following the advice of other reviewers, I too add minced garlic. I also added 2 tsp pimenta moida (fermented pepper paste). Being of Portuguese decent, pimenta moida is a staple in my house. It's available in the international section of most groceries stores. Don't forget crusty bread to dip in the sauce, which I doubled for this purpose. Thanks Star!!!

This was fantastic and SO fast. With prep, it takes no more than 30 minutes. I did not have clams, but used 1 lb of frozen NZ Mussles (did not thaw). I also only had 12oz of Chorizo. I did not use less of the other ingredients, as I wanted lots of broth.  As others suggested, I added 2 large tbsp. of chopped garlic and also some dried parsley. It was terrific and my husband gave it a huge thumbs up.

I'm not a big steamer fan, but I made this for guests last night and they couldn't get enough of it!  Everyone loved it.  Served with dilled shrimp, restaurant-style house salad, old boy's strawberry pie all from this web site.  Also had lobsters.  Oh!  And lightly steamed then chilled asparagas drizzled with raspberry vinagrette dressing from this site.  GREAT meal - especially these steamers!

These were so tasty and delicious.  These simple ingredients really turn a pot of clams into a delicious stew...the broth was amazing, provide spoons, too.  I just eyeballed the ingredients and added a a cup or so extra chicken stock and a chunk of butter to the mix.  Took previous reviewers advice and added some prepared minced garlic, too.  Some thin sliced baguette and a glass of cold chardonney, what a fun summer meal.  Loved these & hubs raved.  Will definitely do again.  Many thanks for your recipe.

I liked this so much I built a food list around it!  Brings back memories of the summers we spent in the New Bedford area.  My Polish meat-and-potatoes loving husband would never eat a clam, but the rest of us love it.

I used a few things differently but thats what makes great cooks.The clams are the important part and out here in washington state we have lots of choices for what type of clams we use.I dug these about 20 miles from my home and they were 2"/2.5" manila butter clams. I used 28 oz. san marzano tomatoes,3 garlic cloves chopped,spicy Italian sausages and garnished each serving with fresh basil.I used ingelnook chardenee because it makes good sipping while waiting for the clams to cook.I guess it  really is closer to Italian steamed clams.I served it with toasted three cheese rustic bread drizzled with virgin olive oil.Got a standing ovation from everyone.I couldn't buy chorizo in the casings so chosed the italian sausage.I was told the chorizo is too greasy,anyway.

Wow!  This recipe is great, I did add a couple things, 2 large cloves of fresh garlic and fresh parsley and hot pepper flakes.  I served it with a bowl of salad dressed with fresh lemon juice, oregano and olive oil, and of course crusty whole wheat bread.  I also used hot Sopressato, couldn't find Chorizo.  I had dinner ready in less than 30 minutes; Thanks! for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Very easy to follow and delicious.  There are only two of us, so I only used 2 pounds of clams, but same amount of broth and worked great and lots of broth afterward.  We also added 4 cloves of garlic and used ground chorizo instead of the kind you cut.  I browned the chorizo before adding the rest of the ingredients and the clams.

These clams are absolutely FABULOUS!  I never thought I would like any clams better than traditionally steamed with wine and garlic and melted butter.  But I am going to have a hard time making clams any other way than this now.  I tried to follow this recipe exactly, but I only I only had 2 dozen clams, so I quartered the recipe.  And I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used crushed tomatoes with basil and herbs.  Also forgot to drizzle the oil on top but they didn't need it.   Served with crusty bread like another reviewer suggested.  PERFECT!  I will make again and again exactly the same way.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is really YUMMY! As with the Portuguese Soup, I prefer Linguisa sausage to chorizo it's a better compliment to the clams. It's also a portuguese sausage.

Made this today! Came out so good! I followed an user's advice and added 3 tablespoons of chopped garlic and some dried parsley to 2 pounds of chorizo and 7.5 pounds of clams. I added 3 chopped peppers for extra kick and loved it. I used 2 12-ounce Sierra Nevada Pale Ale beers that gave it a more zesty kick instead of wine. Large clams were used but I made the mistake of overcooking them a bit and the meat came out a bit tough, but thats my fault. But the broth was sooooo good! I loved to get some of the clam meat or chorizo and wrap it on some toasted bread, dip it on the broth and eat. I will do this again! Easy and fast. I recommend it.

We made a similar recipe for 30 summers while in Woods Hole.  I'm back for a few weeks and wanted to be sure I knew how to cook this favorite.  This was helpful-except we always use linguica instead.  Doc Dave-try it with linguica-it won't "take over" the dish.  Thanks!

I personally did not care for the flavor of sausage and onions in my clams. Tasted to heavy. I gave it a try, but, I much prefer clams italiano recipe on this site.

I was soooo excited when I found this! 
How I did it was 15 clams, half a package of lil' smokies (I felt after reading the other reviews that this would help the sausage taste not be so strong , it worked), 2 cups of chicken broth (I'm a soup fan!) 1 cup of white wine, 1 can mild rotel, 1/2 onion wedged, 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 shakes parsley and 2 shakes Italian seasoning, 2 tbsp butter...all at once until the clams are fully opened. It was amazing with a sliced baguette and good salad. Thanks for sharing! :-)

Excellent. I've been eyeballing this recipe for a while and finally bought some clams to make it. My canned tomatoes had olive oil and garlic added, which went really well. I halved the recipe for the amount of clams I had, and made the rest as written. Thanks for the recipe!

Growing up just 8 minutes from Rhode Island I had to try this recipe...I grew up with food like this.  We just finished dinner and it was a clear thumbs up with everyone in my family. (even my picky 6 year old).  The broth was so tasty and crusty bread was great to dip into it. The best thing...it was so easy that my 10 year old could have made this recipe by himself.  Quick, Easy and what a treat. What could be better than that?
