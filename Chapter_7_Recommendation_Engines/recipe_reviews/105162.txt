This is a quick, easy and delicious recipe.  This was my first time cooking a round roast, so I was worried how it would come out.  The Dijon mustered and pepper on the outside of the roast made it tender in the center and created a crispy (but not too crispy) outer edge that added real flare to the meat.  For the sauce, I had to used canned mushrooms and used red onion, but I found the mushroom turned out more tender and it had no negative effect on the flavor of the sauce.

It’s the sauce that really makes this a meal.  I was concerned that this recipe would cause an overly tart taste from all the Dijon, but when finished it only adds a slight tang to a delicious vegetable and beef meddle.

Whether a beginner or an expert, this creates a meal to be remembered.  I would recommend it to anyone and can’t wait to cook it for my parents when they come out next month.

Bon appetite!
