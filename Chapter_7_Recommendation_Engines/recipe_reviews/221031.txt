this was sooo pretty in the bowl and very tasty. i gave 5 stars but next time i would cut the rice vinegar in half, it was too much for my taste. the flavor i had on hand of vinegar had basil and oregano in it, that was the only difference. i couldn't stop eating it! thanks for a great healthy recipe for hot days.

This is delicious and easy. I didn't have any parsley and my husband does't like ginger so I left those out.  I added about 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil. I took it to a potluck and everyone loved it.

This is a fantastic and light dish. Came out perfect first try. I see some say to cut the seasoned rice vinegar as it is a fair amount. We were ok with full strength, but I could see going to maybe 1.5c instead of 2. Outstanding dish. Crowd pleaser.

Excellent!  So healthy and pretty. I added some fresh corn cut off the cob for a little sweetness, dried basil and oregano.

So light and healthy! Great dish for picnics, pot lucks, family gatherings. I made 1/2 of the recipe and it was perfect for the two of us. Plenty of left overs for next several days. Recommend chilling overnight.

I was out of rice vinegar, so I used miso, basil, lemon, and olive oil to flavor. It was very good!

This was a nice, light, refreshing salad, that we served next to barbecued chicken (like the submitter suggested). My hubby suggested adding some mango to it, which I think would be a great addition. Next time!

This has become a staple whenever we host barbecues. It's not only a pretty dish, but is a delicious favorite that goes very quickly!
