This is a great salad to take to party. Everyone loved it because they were asking for the recipe.  I took home an empty bowl.  Cathy Helms

My daughter enjoys "pretty" foods.  I prepared this for her birthday dinner.  Not only did it look beautiful in the glass salad bowl for her, but everyone else loved it too!

Hmmmmm...it is pretty and simple to make but I personally didn't like the apples/pickles with ranch dressing. I ended up picking out the pickles and wiping off the ranch from the apples. An okay lunch but I just found the combination of flavors too odd for my tastes and without the apples...it seems like an ordinary salad. Thanks anyways!

Surprisingly good.  Followed this to a tee.  Used a deli- barrel pickle.  Very good tasting.  Everyone at the party liked it.

I enjoyed this, but my boyfriend thought it was just OK. I used mixed greens and sprouted sunflower seeds, and made my own ranch using cashew butter. The garlicky pickles complemented the tart/sweet apples nicely. I'd adjust the amounts, though, because by the end I was left with lots of apple and not much else.

I liked this recipe. Never had pickle in a salad before but the tanginess mixed with the sweet bitter apple and the crunchiness of the Sunflowers really made for a new experience.

This salad turned out to be awesome. My husband is a very picky eater and he ate all of it. It made me feel great to see him really love it.

To be honest the salad dressing chosen for this was pretty gross for the combo of vegetables/fruit.  I remade it and added olives sliced in half and a vinagerette instead with almond slices as well.  Much much better.

This is OK, but nothing special.  ranch dressing is not the best vehicle for romaine, in my opinion.

This is an awesome recipe. It does seem a little heavy on the apples though but still really good.
