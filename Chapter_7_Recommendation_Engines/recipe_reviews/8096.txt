Absolutely fantastic, however 50 min baking time was too long. I suggest checking this cake after 30 min. Very tasty and easy. Enjoy!

This cake was pretty good. It had a nice flavour but was a little dry. Also, the cooking time provided in the recipe was too long. I would reccomend adding some more shortening or oil to the cake to decrease dryness. It wasn't a huge hit with my kids, so I'd say you'd be best off serving this cake to adults with coffee or tea.

I used craisins for part of the raisins and it was delicious.  It was dark and spicy and we topped it with cool-whip.  I think it would be wonderful with lemon or custard sauce.  It was almost like my own grandmother's black cake.

My daughter is unable to have milk products, so this was a great cake to make for her birthday.

I saw some complaints that this cake is dry. Suggest that you use butter because shortening does not give much moisture.  Also, the taste will be superior.   A good cake otherwise and great for slicing thin with a cup of tea.

For people mentioning that this cake is dry.  This cake recipe was developed in war time to fill the needs of cooks with limited ingredients.  If you find yourself without eggs or dairy this might be a great cake to make.  When we make it I always add more fruit than it calls for to keep in moist.  Apple works great in it.
