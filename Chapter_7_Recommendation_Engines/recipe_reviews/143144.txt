so good, just make sure the plantains are ripe, this way you won't even need sugar at all, the plantains natural sugar is more than enough.

I made these over the weekend and added powdered sugar to top them off. I made many of them and none lasted. This is very close to to he original recipe and less time consuming. But I suggest to change your oil, in other words- use clean oil vs recycled from other fried foods.

My mother makes this recipe and it is a wonderful sweet treat for the entire family, including the in laws that are not from Guatemala.
