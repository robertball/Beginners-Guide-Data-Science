My 2 cats adore them. The recipe makes a generous amount. I found it easier to control the size for kitty-sized mouths by pitching off a piece of dough, rolling it into a ball & then flattening it with a teaspoon. I used millet bread crumbs because I had them. I'm giving these to neighbor cats as well so we'll see how they like them. My guys are good eaters so they like almost anything!

I went in a different direction and flattened it all out thin on a cookie sheet to use a pizza cutter on to make small squares like temptations extremely simple to make, and the cats got that same feeding frenzy mentality they get when I bring out the temptations tub. Plus I know everything that went into them so minds at ease for artificial ingredients.

I think there must be an error for the quantity this makes. Mine made double then the 72 listed and it was very time consuming. My cats would not eat them. I am feeding them to the wildlife-squirrels/birds. They seem to be enjoying them.

My cat LOVED this, but somehow I thought 72 servings ment only 72 treats and I was wrong. I made over 150 treats before deciding  to freeze the rest. Next time I'll shrink the recipe down by half, I think

I made these for our two cats and it turned out that all the time, effort and ingredients went into me making the cats some toys. They will not eat them, just play and walk away, no matter what we do. So, this is a good starting recipe but some changes do need to be made according to the preference of our cats. The idea gets 5 stars but the outcome....not worth all the time and waste. Thank you for sharing the idea though!

When you first make, please make a small amount. I made the whole recipe and my cats would not eat it.  They only played with them like balls.

Talk to your vet before feeding your cat tuna as it can cause crystals to form in the urinary tract. This can be very painful as it blocks the urine causing the cat to bloat and if not treated properly their bladder can explode. I will never understand why pet food companies still use tuna in cat food.

Great recipe! My cats loved it and even though I halved the recipe, I still came out with double the recipe said I would make! I have enough for both my cats and my neighbours too! The only thing is that it's very time consuming to roll about 140 treats. I recommend using a fourth of the recipe so it doesn't have to take hours to make these. Great recipe!
