I didn't want the zucchini to turn to mush or the garlic to burn before the carrots were done so I gave them a headstart in the pan.  I added a bit of salt and used dry dill weed instead of fresh.  My husband said he would eat this ANYTIME!  Paired it with the Lemon Garlic Tilapia from this site.

I used this as a base to make a clean out the fridge pasta dish. I doubled the amount of vegetables and added an onion. To make it healthier I used whole wheat pasta, margarine, and fat free milk. Salt and pepper really make this amazing.

This was great and the family enjoyed it. I did as the other reviewer and sauteed the carrots, some sweet onion and mushrooms for a bit before adding in the garlic and zucchini.  I also added more garlic as we like a lot of garlic. Used 1/2 & 1/2 cream.  May add a bit more cream next time, but was very happy overall.

VERY GOOD BUT NEEDS MORE! i doubled the recipe for a main course and what i did (since i think BIG zuch's are nasty) is i used 2 small green and 2 small yellows, also added a choped onion, a julienned red bell pepper and stalk of broccoli cut into pieces.  also i added a little italian seasoning to keep the dill in check but still noticeable.  AND FOR THE KICKER- i pan seared some already cooked, deveined and shelled frozen shrimp in some butter and a dash of white wine to top the dish, let me know what you think if anyone tries it this way :)  SLAINTE!

Delicious and easy!  I left out the dill because I didn't have it, added half of a diced onion and doubled the garlic.  I sauteed the carrots for five minutes before adding the zucchini.  I only had half a cup of cream, so I supplemented with whole milk.  The only thing I'll do differently in the future is make more sauce.  YUM!

I make this same dish frequently except I add more vegetables, including snow peas (sliced lengthwise into thin strips), regular frozen peas, frozen corn, shredded carrot, zuchinni and summer squash (quartered lengthwise and sliced) - I like the veggies to showcase the pasta, not vice versa - it makes it more filling in a healthier way. I use a full cup of heavy cream,  the butter and chives (dried are fine) instead of dill and I add a little minced garlic. Oh, and I just add the vegetables to the pasta for the last 5 minutes or so of cooking instead of sauteeing separately. I make the sauce in a separate small pan then toss all together. Delicious! Kind of like a primavera.

Great by itself but my advice is to add some crumbled cooked bacon or pancetta - it makes this dish really sing! I like the way the jullienne veggies pair with a string pasta (I used vermicelli.)  Nice recipe thanks!

Didnt follow the recipe, tailored it to empty out my vegetable bin. I used the carrots and added some broccoli, fresh mushrooms, a small onion, forgot about the garlic!, and subbed Half and Half with some 1/2% milk, dried dill, and sprinkled shredded cheese on top. Delicious! Next time, I will remember to add garlic!

This turned out fabulous! I substituted spaghetti squash for the spaghetti and the flavors really complimented each other. Sauvignon blanc wine pairs well.  Only problem is the parmesan cheese clumped together.

This was awesome!! I sauteed the carrots a little before adding the zucchini. I didn't have any butter so I used olive oil instead.  Will be making this again, and again.

This is a fun way to use up zucchini.  It was good but not very flavorful.  I did go a little heavy on the vegetables.  Might try to doctor up with more salt, pepper & herbs next time.

Rich and creamy.  Comes together quickly, looks pretty and tastes delicious. I'm not a fan of carrots, raw or cooked, so I substituted orange bell pepper, tho' any number of other vegetables could be used with great results.

I cut down on the cream (1/4 cup) by adding flavour - I sauteed veggies in lemon flavored olive oil and added the garlic towards the end and cooked it on low heat for several minutes so it wouldn't burn. I used Fuscilli pasta because it grabs the sauce better than spaghetti and then cracked fresh ground pepper once it was plated, no dill, but I reserved 2 tbsp Parmesan cheese to sprinkle over top. Delish

I totally recommend this. I loved it and so did my family. It was a fun twist on the classic spaghetti. I will definitely be making it again. My minor changes: 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and I sauteed the carrots first then added the zucchini and garlic.

I sort of used this as a base and created my own. I sauteed  zucchini, squash and onions from our garden (no carrots) in olive oil instead of butter. Then, instead of dill, I sprinkled in Italian seasoning, garlic salt and pepper. It made a fantastic meal!

One word describes this recipe: Unbelievable!!!  I normally stick to tomato based sauces with pasta, I am SO glad I branched outside of my comfort zone because this was amazing!  I never measure anything exactly so I didn't follow it to a "T".  I also added Italian seasoning, onion and mushrooms.  My husband absolutely loved it, and my 4 year old gobbled it all up!  Will make again!!!

This was delish and so easy to make.  The only thing I would do differently is add a yellow zucchini to the mix along with a green and maybe a little more carrots because I think it needed a little more vegetables.  The serving size said six but it barely covered a meal for 3 of us.  If you are making if for a family definately double the recipe.  Do not omit the dill it gave it a great flavor.

Awesome!  Made the recipe "as is", and it turned out great.  The only mistake I made was serving as a side dish....the will be the main course next time.

Delicious side. Got a bit confused by some reviews that appear to be altogether different recipes. Got a real kick out of the reviewer who substituted cream for half and half...and then offered that next time, it will need more cream. :O

I fixed this last night, so good, so easy!  I substituted Sugar Snap Beans, cut lengthwise in slivers (I just don't care for zucchini) and just one slivered carrot for color.  I also substituted half of the cream for Fat Free Half and Half (one of todays best discoveries).  I didn't want to run to the store for Dill so I used a small handful of fresh chopped Chives that are just now popping up in my kitchen garden.  Oh, I also sautéed my vegetables for just a minute in just a couple of teaspoons of Smart Balance (the only non-butter that doesn't turn to water when you cook with it). Other than my little changes I followed the recipe. :-)
Pasta Primavera, such a versatile dish!

Pretty tasty. I made by the recipe this time, but next time will add red onion and mushrooms. I also will cook the carrots a little by themselves prior to adding the remaining ingredients.

My husband and I love this. We sauteed a few mushrooms along with the other veggies. I have trouble digesting pasta, so we cooked a spaghetti squash and used the spaghetti squash "noodles". It was fantastic and very colorful! The dill brought out the flavors. I used half and half rather than heavy cream and it was plenty rich.

I made this last night and even my pickiest eater finished her serving! I did use 1 1/2 tsp of dried dill, as I didn't have fresh on hand. I didn't find it necessary to start cooking the carrots before cooking the zucchini and garlic.  If you do a true julienne of the vegetables, they cook just fine together & I like mine to be crisp-tender.

This was really good. I added sliced red onions & used 2 good sized fresh garlic cloves.  I used a whole 8 oz carton of cream (1 cup) but probably could use a little more cream or some milk - it was just a tad too thick. Definitely a great way to sneak some veggies into our meal since we're not big veggie fans - even the zucchini was good in this. Our 2 year old liked it too. Between the two of us (+toddler) we finished this off in one meal (it was our main dish, no sides), so if we want leftovers or to feed more I would need to double it.

I've made this several times as written except did not use the dill.  I would say overall was very pleased with the outcome as was my family...Always made it as a side dish but certainly shrimp would make this a wonderful entree..

It was very filling...easy to make, but I wasn't pleased with the overall taste.  The flavors just didn't seem to marry...I will not be making again

We enjoyed this very much.  Used olive oil instead of butter and two small zucchini and two small yellow squash.  Other than those changes, we prepared the recipe as is, but with perhaps just a tad bit more parmesan cheese!!  Thank you for a great recipe that we will do again and again.  Plus, it's a quick to prepare dinner for a weeknight!

Delicious and a nice change from my usual pasta dishes. I tried it as written and really enjoyed it. Then I implemented Seth1981's additions (thanks Seth!) - which jazzed it up a notch. All in all a wonderful versatile dish. Thank you for this recipe CAK0609!

I made this exactly as stated except  adding grilled chicken to it.... my entire family loved it! Such a nice and lighter change than the regular cheesy chicken spaghetti or red sauce. We will be having this again very soon!

This was an easy to make recipe that tasted great.  Even my nephew who dreads veggies ate this pasta.  Can't wait to try this recipe again with other veggies.

I modified and simplified it since my wife had just cooked lasagna and I wanted to use the zucchini as a side. I  simply julienned the zucchini and stir fried it with butter and garlic butter. Added a bit of garlic and pepper and a bit of parmesan and fresh basil when cooked. Makes a great side dish.

My boys LOVED this dish. I made it true to the recipe with one exception. Took advice from the reviews and sautéed my carrots first then added the zucchini and garlic. Fabulous! I definitely will be making this dish again.

This was very good.  I added chicken and some salt and pepper.  Next time I'll try shrimp.  I diced the zucchini instead of julienne cause I thought my kids would eat it better. My 10 year old son went back for seconds and thirds. The other kids cleaned their plates.  Thanks for the recipe!

Did exactly as stated except used dried dill. Since using as a entrée instead of side dish I added shrimp as others suggested. If it wasn't for the shrimp there wouldn't have been any flavor. It was still blah to us because I used cooked shrimp instead of fresh & cook it in with the veggies.

This was really good. Even though I used a full cup of cream, I found the sauce was a bit thick so I added about a half cup of milk to thin it out, which also made more of the sauce. So I also ended up adding about 1/4 cup more Parmesan. Like other reviewers, I added salt and some lemon pepper. Lastly, like another reviewer suggested, I fried up some chopped bacon and added that to the sauce, making it an entree. As an entree, it only served 2 of us.

I've been making this for years. The only difference is my recipe calls for the addition of julienned red peppers added with the zucchini ... and I make it with a pound of angel hair/capellini ... or more. And yes, the carrots are sauteed/softened before the addition of the peppers & zucchini.

Wow! This recipe was soooo good! I only made 2 changes for my own diet needs, substituting whole wheat pasta and the heavy cream I susbtituted with nonfat milk, cornstarch, and whole wheat flour making this a healthy side. I served with with the beer lime grilled chicken from this site. Thank you for your submission!

Really good!  I added sliced red pepper and yellow squash, used whole wheat spaghetti and fat free half and half instead of cream.  Don't skimp on the spices- I usually cut garlic in half for most recipes, but this really needed the full amount.

I started it like others, carrots first and a little salt.  Then added garlic and zucchini and dill weed seasoning.  added half and half once veggies were soft with a hint of crisp to zucchini, personal preference.  Once I drained my pasta, added it to sauce.  Coupling with grilled salmon. Yum yum.

I did as the other reviewer and sauteed the carrots, some sweet onion and mushrooms for a bit before adding in the garlic and zucchini. I also added more garlic as we like a lot of garlic. Used 1/2 & 1/2 cream. May add a bit more cream next time, but

I  didn't have any dill at home so I added basil and Thyme to it instead.  I also added black pepper to the sauce.
It wasn't as creamy as I expected it.  Somehow the parmesan made it a bit grainy.   But we liked it and I would make it again.  It was fast and very easy to make after a long day of work.

. We liked it but I did add additional seasoning. I also shredded the carrots and zucchini. Cooked the carrots a bit before adding the zucchini. 1c heavy cream and also 1 c pasta water. Added seasoned salt to taste when adding the dill.

I really enjoyed this pasta and so did my partner. I added spinach, onion, way more garlic, a little orange bell pepper, and substituted dried dill since I didn't have fresh. It was nice! Definitely cook the carrots and zucchini a bit before adding the other ingredients, and a little salt and pepper after serving makes a big difference. Will make again!

Added in some corn and leftover broccoli and grilled chicken with the cheese and milk. And a pinch of red pepper flakes. Instead of pasta, doubled the zucchini as zoodles.

This recipe is the bomb!  Delicious!  While preparing I was toying with the idea of adding a can of chicken breast meat because I'm such a carnivore.  It did't need it.  Delicious as is.  Used 1 tsp. of dried dill instead of fresh.  This is such a beautiful, colorful, and flavorful dish; it would be great to serve to company.  I thought it was sort of elegant.  I did add about 1/4 of an onion, sliced, with the zucchini and garlic.  I had it leftover from a chicken recipe so it was already cooked and had bit of a buttery/chicken flavor to it.  I don't know if that's what took this dish over-the-top for me, but I thought it was heavenly.  Will make again.  The onions were leftover from Chef John's Sweet Hot Mustard Chicken Thighs recipe.  Stirred in about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes in the end for a little kick and about 1/4 c. of the pasta water to thin the sauce.

Changed a couple tho he but this was awesome.  Switched out cream for chicken broth and basil for the dill. Would use less carrots because it made it sweet.

I made this recipe last year and it was delicious.  I made it again tonight and the parmesan cheese, which was added slowly, clumped into a gooey mess and did not make a smooth sauce.  Does anyone know why this might have occurred?

After reading other reviews carefully, I added an onion and some mushrooms. I also crumbled a vegetable stock cube and added some chilli flakes. While it wasn't bad, it was just ok. It's a good recipe for getting rid of vegetables as you can add whatever you happen to have on hand.

I love this recipe. I use egg free pasta similar in texture to egg noodles, coconut oil instead of butter, I add half n half in addition to heavy cream, use lots of minced garlic (around 8 cloves), increase the amt of carrots and zucchini, & add lemon juice at the end (from 1&1/2 lemons). I leave out the dill. I also add a little more Parmesan cheese + heavy cream & salt and pepper it "to taste". Reheats well.

The dish is good but a little bland as is. I now make this regularly with one change- substitute the parmesan for creamy BRIE cheese. It makes a huge difference in texture and flavor. A family fave. And be careful on sauteeing the zucchini. Get those carrots done but the zucchini doesn't need to be handled much to prevent mushiness. Anyway, use brie cheese. You'll be glad you did!

I thought this was okay. It was a little heavy for my taste. It didnt seem to have much flavor. I added a little garlic salt and Adobo seasoning which improved it. I also added extra zucchini and carrots and added cooked chicken sausage, at the end, to make it a complete meal.

Pasta, veggies and garlic- I loved this!  I made this for lunch for myself and my husband came home and finished it, which surprised me cause he doesn't get too thrilled about anything but chicken wings!!  My only change was using zucchini and mushrooms cause I didn't have carrots and I used more garlic, fabulous!!

Really good recipe "as is"!  Easy to modify to personal preference.  I added red pepper.  Even as a side dish, my husband and I only got 2 servings out of it.  Partly because it's that good. :)

Well, to put it bluntly, I could eat this often.  I tweeked the recipe .... added 2 can of minced clams at the end, cooked my linguine in water + clam juice, steamed fresh asparagus but decided to add 3/4 of the pound to the finished project, served with lemon juice.  I cannot wait to try it with shrimp or vegetarian, with any vegetable you have on hand.  Love, love, love it!  The best review I could give is:  I would serve this in my restaurant, if I had one.  Thank you!!  Thank you!!  I cannot wait to make this again, and again, and again!!  Thank you!!!

This tasted so great! And super easy to make. I added some chopped onions to the dish and since I didn't completely have all the vegetables on hand I just threw in mixed vegetables with some summer squash. It turned out fantastic and I love all the vegetables in it.

Really great!  I added onions and red and yellow bell pepper.  After the sauce was made (but before I added the cheese), I ran it through my blender on a very low speed to finely chop all the veggies (small kiddos in this house).  Back in the pan, I added the cheese.  We thought this was great!

I enjoyed this very much! I used a little less parmesan and more cream than the recipe called for, and found it delicious.

Great dish.... So easy! The best part I got my two young children to eat zucchini !

Added shrimp and served this as a main dish.  The only change I made was instead of heavy cream replaced with light cream.

I could eat this everyday! I did add extra veggies, cream and cheese because we like more sauce. Thank you so much for sharing!

How about sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced onions for added flavor?

This was very good!  My family really enjoyed it and my 7 year old son requested the leftovers in his lunch for school today!  I did add sauted onions and salt and pepper and I used skim milk instead of the heavy cream because I didn't have the cream.  I'm sure it would be even better with the cream, but it was good with the skim milk and that makes less calories.  I didn't time my meal well so this sat in the pot for about a half hour before we actually ate it and it was still great, can't wait to make it again and eat it right away!  LOL!  Great recipe, will be in our summer rotation for sure!
