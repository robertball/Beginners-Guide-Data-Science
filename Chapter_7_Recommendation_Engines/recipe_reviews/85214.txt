This spice blend is EXCEPTIONAL!!!  I have to say, I didn't use it as a burger but was looking for a lamb marinade to make grilled pieces of lamb/bone in.  This is to die for marinade and my lamb-loving husband loved it!  Toasting the seeds makes all the difference...it takes on a different flavor when toasted.  I just combined all the ingredients including the yogurt.  Didn't have shallots so used 2 tsp. onion powder, used fresh parsley, and didn't have cumin seeds so used 1/2 tsp. ground cumin.  Did add 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar to this marinade.  The lamb pieces were done in oven broiler pan and were so incredibly tender after marinating for about 7 hours.  I can't wait to try these as burgers this summer on the grill.  Hamburger could easily be replaced for the ground lamb, as it is less expensive.  With the spice blend, they taste a little like italian sausage (due to the fennel) and a gyro.  DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY THIS AS A MARINADE FOR MEATS BY DOING AS I DID ABOVE!  Thanks for this wonderful favorite for my husband.  The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe cut down on the fennel by 1/2 tsp.  I also found that the fennel seeds got a bit browner than the coriander so would add the coriander first to the hot pan.

3/31/09-I just made this again last night with turkey and they were so good.  I didn't have yogurt so I just used sour cream and it worked out great.  I love this recipe.  Wow, wow, wow!!!!  This is an amazing combination of flavors.  Make this exactly as written and you won't be disappointed.

This is the best recipe for lamb burgers!  I like to add 2 - 3 Tbs. chopped fresh cilantro, 3 - 4 cloves chopped garlic and 1/2 cup chopped onion.  Also, I double the yogurt recipe and add a few cloves of chopped garlic to that.  Everyone likes to dip bread into it.  My kids call it "crazy delicious".  We have had this nearly every week since the first time I made it.

this was great!!!  the herbs and the lamb combo, delicious.  grilled outside and served on sourdough bread.  my family voted unanimously that these were the BEST burgers ever and we have made MANY through the years.  the leftover yogurt is good served with chunks of crusty sourdough bread.

These are delicious! We have actually made with half ground lamb and half ground venison. I serve with rolls or pita bread, and everyone loves them. Highly recommended!

These turned out great.  I didn't have the coriander or fennel seeds and didn't even make the yogurt part. Ate them like traditional burgers and they were delicious.  My husband loved it.  My toddler would have, but the cayenne and paprika made it somewhat spicy - yum!
