5 stars with these revisions. This is really great for the vegetables/simplicity. I doubled the egg mixture (except only 1.5 cups of milk). I added 1 can cr. of celery and salt/pepper to taste. A great staple recipe to repeat. My husband is a good cook and he really enjoyed it.

This is a very good casserole!! I wasn't sure if it would be due to the lack of spices. I highly suggest this recipe and it will be made in our house a LOT.

This is an awesome recipe.  The calorie count is low, it's low in sodium.  You can add almost anything to this recipe and it's a win win!!!!

Easy and good. I had saved it because there are not many recipes that have cauliflower (and asparagas). I added a little more parmesan cheese and used the whole cauliflower. I used flavored bread crumbs (herb) and for the "non salt" seasoning I used a product that was a mix of pepper and "other seasonings". Next time I may increase the liguid a bit.

Saying that it "hamburger helper" is not fair and that person probably didn't even make it.

While this was loaded with healthy veggies, this is pretty boring as written.  Definitely needs some spicing up.

I was thrilled to see a casserole recipe that wasn't high in sodium.  I was in a hurry and par-cooked the cauliflower and carrots in the microwave and shortened the baking time to 30 minutes...I think following the recipe as written would be better.  I used canned no salt added green beans instead of the asparagus and Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb for the seasoning.  In spite of my shortcuts it turned out pretty tasty!  I thought it had plenty of flavor with no added salt.

Imagine generic hamburger helper then take out any semblance of flavor and you have this casserole.

this is really good. I didn't have any asparagus so I used green beans. I used Italian bread crumbs and Emeril's seasoning. My family loved it.  We did have to add salt at the table.  I will definitely make this again.

Looking for something different to use ground beef in. Yes, it is filled w/many veggies - I substituted broccoli for asparagus, veggies were good. Then increased my choice of seasoning, as it sounded fairly bland & it was recommended by others. Lastly, added some extra cheese to the liquid. The flavor was ok, but no wanted it again. Also, it doesn't present itself very nicely. Won't make it again, nothing special or particularly yummy.

I agree it needs to have more spices or even a cream soup to make it a little less bland, but I like it and plan to use this again. I like it as a way to use some of my leftover veggies. I added cheddar cheese on top.

This recipe was great exactly as is. I ended up putting in skim milk instead of 2% because that's the only milk we had in the house, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved it. If anyone was curious, with 98% lean beef and the skim milk, it was 179 calories/serving.

I pan seared the veggies with garlic slightly....used baby carrots, cauliflower & fresh garlic.  Crushed garlic croutons and put that in the milk/egg mixture instead of bread crumbs. Added more fresh garlic & chopped red pepper to the hamburg.....parmesana regiana was shredded on top the last 15 minutes.....awesome flavors!

My family and I loved it.  Granted, it sounded a bit bland as presented so I did change a couple of things like seasoning the hamburger with garlic powder and chili powder while it was browning and added some mozz cheese as well.  It is a great base recipe and you could pretty much use any veggies, which I did so I could use what I had on hand.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Not sure if I did something wrong here, but this did not turn out for me at all.  Followed the recipe but it was very bland, really no flavor at all. Will not make this again.

It did seem a little bland to me - I think I will try it again with some spices.  But my husband ate it and said he liked it, and I was almost positive he wouldn't like it.

This was very good. I did double the milk mixture, except used only 1 1/2C milk and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and an additional egg. I also added a bit more spice and increased the volume of vegetables slightly ( mostly just to increase the number of servings! ). I baked it as directed and increased the parmesan cheese topping to 2/3C. Husband loved it and had seconds. Me too!

I added significantly more seasoning and cheese. Like others, I added whatever vegetables I had available (carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, celery). I also used several kinds of cheeses. It was amazing! I think the base recipe is spot on fantastic and you can play with it however you please.

I followed another reviewer's advice and added a can of cream of celery & 1 1/2 C milk. To stay low carb, I traded out carrots for broccoli & cauliflower.  Added some extra seasonings and it was enjoyed by even finicky teenage boys.

The family really liked it-- will make again. 
I modified by: stirfrying in cast iron skillet; leaving out asparagus since we didn't have any; using more veggies than meat; using three eggs; omitting the cheese; and for seasoning, using unrefined salt and garlic powder. 
After stirfrying the meat and veggies, I mixed the eggs with almond milk, salt and garlic in a bowl, then added to the pan and continued cooking until the eggs were done. I blended gf bread and placed crumbs over the top. I put pats of butter over the top and broiled in the oven for two minutes. Quick & Yummy!

Can be salted/seasoned to your taste. Always looking for new ways to use ground meat. Doubled the beef, and layered about 1 cup of grated cheese with the meat/veggie mix in the baking pan. Added an extra egg and a can of cream-of-whatever soup to the milk mixture and poured it over the stuff in the pan before baking. Served with white rice which cooks while the casserole is in the oven. Made 6-7  generous servings.

This was delicious, a great way to get in lots of veggies.  The whole family liked it, even hubby who isn't into veggies.  I made it just as written except I didn't have asparagus so I used a few frozen green beans.  Worked just fine though I'm guessing the asparagus would've been better.  I also doubled the egg mixture per other reviewers suggestion.  I will definitely keep this in the dinner rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Tasty!  I made a few modifications, but mainly because what I had on hand.  I cooked 45 min but turned oven off and it stayed in another 45 or so, because I got busy! So got was well cooked and veggies soft, but I still thought it was great - actually perfect for 1 year old since she doesn't have molars yet and can't eat veggies that are too crunchy. Pretty rich so great with a green salad.

• I used whole milk and 2 eggs instead of one. (I had a lot of veggies...huge...didn't want dried out.)
• used cheddar as that is what I had on hand.
• I used an entire cauliflower head + frozen pearl onions and half bag frozen broccoli as that is what we had - I am sure a lot of combinations would work.
• I used a Montreal chicken seasoning blend (she called for seasoning salt)
• Instead of bread crumbs, I crushed Wild About Mary's gluten free crackers (the kind with all the seeds). Made it very tasty. A great option if you are looking for gluten free.

Fit in a large casserole dish and made a large amount. Packed up 4 lunches for my 1 year old and 1 adult meal after my husband and I ate and we had very large portions as super hungry.

A great meal to take to people (would re-heat well, was good after being in oven a long time, etc).

Even before I had a chance to ask, "So, how is it?", the guys were yelling from the dinning room, "Hey Jen!  This is really good!"  Pretty easy to make and easily adjusted to your own taste.  I didn't have asparagus on hand so I substituted mushrooms.  Can't wait to try it with asparagus too!
