This recipe was really yummy but it was also very watery which sort of disappointed me. I used lemon extract instead of vanilla cause I was making a lemon cake. I poked holes in the cakes and poured it on and the cake soaked up the glaze. It was still very taste. I just wish it was thicker.

This is like pouring water. I don't know what the purpose serves to beat for 2 minutes. Once you mix it, it's mixed. Way, way too much water. Should only be a few Tbsps, not a cup. Powdered sugar glaze is normally white and I have always made mine with a few tablespoons of milk. It should be thick enough that it just comes off the spoon. If you just want something sweet to soak into a cake that is colorless, this is it. Thanks anyway, but I won't make this again.

I used this instead of jam for Rainbow cookies by Penney from this site. It was thin but that is what I wanted for this recipe so it would soak into the cookie layers. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. Thanks Glayna

As written, this recipe gets probably 1 or 2 stars.  The amount of water in this must be a typo.  I made a small amount to drizzle on some cookies, using milk instead of water as some other reviewers mentioned.  I just eyeballed the amount of milk until I had the consistency I wanted.  Added the vanilla to taste.  I think there are probably other glazes out there that are better.
