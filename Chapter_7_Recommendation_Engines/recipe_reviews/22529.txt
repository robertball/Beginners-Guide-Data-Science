I couldn't find a three pound brisket so I purchased an eight pounder and decided to experiment.  Half of it went into the oven at 275 degrees - the other half went into the crockpot.  I did everything like the recipe except I also added about a half cup of beef broth (someone suggested this).  After 7 hours of cooking, I put them side by side and asked my husband and teenage son to critique them.  The oven cooked brisket was juicier and it fell apart - my son liked it the best.  The crockpot brisket sliced and had more of a texture of a roast.  My husband like it the best.  Me?  I was pleased with both and pretty tickled at myself for the experiment.

**WOW** This is the BOMB! Love this recipe! I don't know how the previous reviewer ended up with Shoe Leather??? I have used this many times with success every single time! Fork tender, great flavor and EASY! What could be better? I did make very slight additions: I used a dash of Thyme, onion powder & brown sugar (maybe 2T of Br. sugar) along with the soup mix and the rest. I put all the dry ingredients on the meat & 'patted' them in before I load it into the bag. Then I pour over the Liquid Smoke after I place it in the bag. I placed 1 whole large sweet onion in large slices over the top, then threw on Red Potatoes cut in half. Seal it up. I was short on time so I cooked at 325* for 4 hours. PERFECT!!! Rave reviews from all 8 people at the table...I call that success! I Like the potatoes this way too...makes it so easy to open the hot bag, throw together a salad, and you have dinner!

I thought this was really pretty good.  Good flavor and moist enough.  I also added a little beef broth and baked it in a roasting pan covered tightly with foil.  I also added a lot of chopped veggies like onion, celery and carrots.  When the meat was done, I took it out and cleaned off any fat then sliced it thin against the grain and returned it to the pan then kept it warm until the rest of the dinner was finished.  I would for sure make this again.

Omg this recipe was soooooooooooo tender it fell apart no knife needed.  I dont like smoked flavor so i substituted the smoked liquid with a can of campbells golden mushroom soup mixed with half a can of water and it made a terrific gravy that the brisket cooked in. My picky daughter who never eats brisket asked if i was gonna make it again tonight and she ate the little bit of leftovers that we had. Will be my brisket recipe for now on. YUMMYYYYYYYYYY

This has become a staple in my house!  It's so easy and the liquid smoke gives it a great flavor.  Tastes like you have been tending the grill all day!  P.S. I just throw everything into a slow cooker on LOW for 4-5 hrs.

This was excellent!  My husband raved!  I used a covered roasting pan instead of the oven bag and omitted the flour.  Also, I used beefy onion soup mix.  The liquid smoke adds great flavor, we will definitely make this again and again!

Incredible. You won't believe how delicious this is. The low heat and slow cooking make for a melt-in-your- mouth brisket. I'm salivating just thinking about it!

I had never made brisket before, and so was a little intimidated...until this recipe.  It was so easy!  And the flavor was great.  I doubled the recipe since I had lots of people coming over.  I shouldn't have doubled the flour portion; it just wasn't necessary.  But everything else worked out really great.  I saw someone else had mentioned that their recipe turned out dry.  I don't really get that because my very fatty brisket gave up so much liquid, that it was being braised there towards the last third of the cooking.  But I did only cook the brisket for 6 hours, as recommended, and it worked out great.  Thanks for the recipe, it will definitely be part of my summer repertoire!

Bob knows brisket! So easy to prepare (a no-brainer) and it tastes like you slaved all day. The onion soup mix and liquid smoke are key to the fantastic flavor of the brisket. The roasting bag lets it cook in it's own rich juices. For a savory treat, try this one today.

Good flavor but came out terribly dry after forgetting other's idea of putting in a liquid like beef broth.  Imperative to add liquid; I wil not forget again!

For those who would like to know how this recipe is without any substitutions, it's d-e-l-c-i-o-u-s! 

It has a flavor of liquid smoke but it's not deathly overpowering.   For my sons 1st b-day we had a big party at the park.   I cooked 5 whole market trimmed briskets in various sizes 4lbs all the way to 8lbs.  I add the onion soup to 1/3 cup water and pour over prior to sealing bag.  For an 8lbr I double dry soup with same amount water and add 
1 1/2  bottles of COLGIN brand 4oz natural hickory liquid smoke.  We got rave reviews from family and friends...none was left to bring home.  I will try other brisket recipes from this site(I will try all once), but this "Oh So Tender Brisket" is definitely a keeper in our home.  If anyone is worried about this becoming leather like, don't.  Just add the additional water and check 2-3 hours prior to removing from over.  Never leave anything cooking this long without checking if it's your first attempt! If it is becoming dry add a bit more water to bag.  I also use a large to turkey size cooking bag to give me pleanty of room to work with.  Honestly, I have never had to add water while cooking in 4 years of making this recipe.

I was inspired by kado's experiment and tried my own: this vs. Jewish Grandma's Best Beef Brisket.  I truly expected this one to blow the other away and thank goodness I had the other because I ended up with the shoe leather further surrounded by burnt jerky.  I think it was my own fault as I went for the eight hours and didn't check on it -- some crock pot fantasy that the since my oven was holding 275 perfectly, the meat was just getting more tender.  From the first hour on, the house was filled with the most wonderful aroma so I'll be trying this again and aiming for 6 hours.  The dried, burnt residue looks like it might have been nice drippings at one point.  UPDATE:  Tried again.  Flour doesn't stick to the inside of roasting bags so I'm not sure what that does.  Had to add beef broth at 4.5 hours, turned oven off at 5.5.  Meat was tender, but not overly moist.  Much better than last time, but still not what I'd hoped for.  Maybe I'm just not a brisket fan.

It was my first time making brisket and it was a  hit.  I browned it first and put it the crock pot for 6 hours on low.  I thought it might come out dry so I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with a little water.  No need for flour.  The gravy was delicious and my family wanted the leftover for sandwiches the next day.

My family loved this recipe.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks for posting this!  I used an 8 lb Brisket, and I had it in the oven for about 7 hours.  It came out absolutely perfect.

I cooked the brisket for 6 1/2 hours and it was SO dry!  I should have known that I needed to add a gravy sauce or something or else it would dry out.  Definitely won't use this recipe ever again!  What a waste of a briskett!

This was wonderful.  I had never made a brisket before and it was kind of expensive so I didn't want to dump ketchup or canned soup over it.  I used "beefy" onion soup mix and hickory liquid smoke.  I did add one cup of beef broth and just a teaspoon of brown sugar.  Put it all in the slow cooker and made a simple gravy with the cooking liquid.  My husband thought it was one of my best meals yet.  So simple and fabulous.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of not using flour (it really isn't necessary.) and I increased everything since I had a larger piece of meat. My brisket was 10 lbs. The only thing I do not understand is why the cook time (as written for a 3lb brisket) is so long. I figured my brisket would take several more hours just based on the size. I checked it at 6 hours just to see how it was coming along and the temp was already 210F! It was fall apart tender and tasted great. I just had to scramble to get the rest of dinner ready.

Wow, this was awesome!  I left out the liquid smoke since I didn't have any on hand.  Cooked it in a swallow roasting pan, covered it with tin foil.  I didn't have to add any fluids at all, the moisture off the tin foli just fell back in the pan with the meat.  Even PICKY son said it was good!  Did I say WOW?!

This one turned out fantastic and fell apart.  Rachel doesn't like onion, but it didn't look like the onion was noticeable.  It took less time than the recipe said, but about an hour.  Watch it closely.

Soooooo yummy and sooooooo easy!  Didn't use an oven bag, just covered my pan tight with foil.  Kept the liquid smoke to just a few drops only because it isn't something my family likes real well.  A Keeper for sure!

I loved this recipe.  It calls for things I generally have on hand.  I found it needed a little additional liquid though, so next time I'll add a little canned beef broth  I'll definitely make this again.  Great leftovers for sandwiches!

The best brisket ever!. A total succes, the only thing I changed was; I used only 1/4 cup of the liquid smoke instead of the full amount.

Had never made a brisket in my life so I was alittle nervous especially since it was for an event at church. IT WAS THE BEST TASTING , MOIST & TENDER BRISKET EVER ! Everybody was coming over complimenting my husband thinking it was him using the pit to make it & when they found out it was my 1st time making it & that I used the oven- well they were amazed. I followed recipe & placed brisket fat side up(had very little to begin with) & added 1 can of beef broth to avoid not having juice as stated by some reviewers. I had PLENTY of flavorful juice in bag. This definitely is a keeper.

I tossed this in the crock pot and let it cook all day on low.  I used "beefy" onion soup mix and added 1/2 cup of water.  I did reduce the liquid smoke to 1 TBSP. and it had a good smokey flavor without being too strong.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I don't know what the others were talking about when they said "shoeleather" and "dry"! This recipe was FABU! The only thing I did to vary it a bit was to put half a can of beef broth in the bag along with the brisket. The only reason why was because mine was trimmed of fat a bit! My boyfriend is a real "MEAT" type of guy and he LOVED it!

Well my oh so tender brisket has been cooking for6 hours and the meat is no where near tender and my house just smells like liquid smoke.  What did I do wrong?  The only liquid smoke my store had was hickory flavored.  Is there a regular flavor?  Let's see how much longer this takes.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating because it was very tasty and VERY tender.  I, however, cooked it as stated and for the time stated and mine was WAY too dry.  I will definitely cook this again but I'll cook it a shorter amount of time (ovens vary) or add something for moisture.  THANKS for a great recipe.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as stated. I thought it would be too much liquid smoke, but I was wrong. It was great! My neighbor walked into the house (which smelled incredible after 7 hours of cooking) while I was taking it out, and kept sampling, not wanting to stop! It was really good. I stored the leftover in its own juices and we put it on crusty rolls for sandwiches later. Brisket is almost too lean for that purpose. You need cheese or something with it, although the flavor was just excellent.

This was fantastic! I first salted and peppered each side and browned all over in my dutch oven on the stove. Then I let the pan cool down a bit and poured out the extra vegetable oil. I put the brisket back in the pan and covered it with beefy onion soup mix, the garlic powder, and I didn't have liquid smoke at the time so I put 2 ounces of Hunt's Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce on top. Poured in an inch of water and sprinkled in beef bouillon granules. Popped it in the oven at 275 for 8 hours and oh my was this tender and scrumptious! Will definitely make this again!!

My family thought this was one of the best meals!  I added 2 TBSP of brown sugar to the onion soup mix.  Added 1 can of cream of onion soup directly on top of the brisket and topped with cut red potatoes and onions!  In 6 hours we had dinner ready!  AMAZING!

Wonderful!  A week later my husband is still bragging what a great cook I am and wanting this instead of turkey for thanksgiving!  I did use 1/2 cup of beef broth & was happy w/ the a jus that was left in the bag/pan.  Great for a dinner party when you want to enjoy a cocktail with your friends before the meal!!

Oh my gosh!!!  We loved this one. The meat fell apart when I tried to slice it. I realized at the last minute that I had a package of ranch soup/dip mix, not onion. Maybe this was the reason the meat was not salty enough. I also did not have a roasting bag, so I wrapped the pan tightly with foil. Excellent, fabulous, wonderful!!!!!

This is "THE BEST".  Flavor and tenderness are wonderful.  I use the crockpot.  No fuss and no mess.  If brisket is not on sale, I use a roast.  I use leftovers for burritos, enchiladas, and in my potato soup.

Had a very large piece of brisket. Used a bag, added flour to prevent sticking and rupture. Layered a sliced sweet onion underneath, rubbed the meat with tenderizer, garlic powder, pepper and onion soup mix and placed in bag. Poured beef broth (1 entire pkg) into bag then poured liquid smoke over the meat. All measurements were doubled. Added potatoes (3lbs) carrots and celery. Roasted in oven at 275 for 10 hours, checked at 3rd hour, 5th, 7th, 9th and removed from oven at 10. Meat was so tender it wouldn't slice, just fell apart. Placed veggies down 1st in platter, layered the meat on top, then took all the juices and heated them with additional garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, small amount of beef base, salt and pepper, then poured it over meat and veggies to serve. The nephews ate enough to pop and hubby came back for thirds.

The brisket turned out fantastic! I loved it so much that I have done the same thing to a couple racks of baby back ribs. They didn't take as long to cook of course but they too turned out very tastey. I did take them out of the bag at the end and topped them with our favorite BBQ and put them back in under the broiler for a few minutes to carmelize.

Needed a good Brisket recipe due to purchasing a side of beef.  Never cooked brisket before.  This recipe is fabulous!! Very tender and flavorful!  We cut back on the liquid smoke due to our tastes.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make. My wife's Jewish and had had brisket all her life. A few years ago, she told me she wanted to make one, so I checked allrecipes and found this recipe. Since then, I've been making this whenever brisket goes on sale. Prep time is quick and it comes out oh so good :)

My carnavore (sp?) family absolutely loved this brisket.  It was tender, flavorful and got rave reviews. They're begging me to make it again.  The only thing I might cut back on next time is the liquid smoke!  All said, it's a great recipe that I would be proud to share and will definately use again.

I was skeptical of the low heat and long 
cooking time, but those concerns were totally
in vain.  The first brisket I have ever made
that was moist, tender but not stringy. I 
did not use liquid smoke either because we
don't care for the taste but there was
certainly lots of flavor. I can't
imagine this ever being dry or leathery.
THE ONLY WAY I WILL EVER COOK BRISKET!!

This recipe is AWESOME!! The flavor is terrific and if you manage to save some for leftovers, they make a great philly-style sandwich.  Brisket is kind of expensive in my area but worked wonderfully on a roast.

I made this recipe for 4th of July.  My husband who always has something to say about my cooking was dumb struck.  And with four kids, EVERYONE liked it.  Even friend couldn't believe what a good cook I was.  I did add a little red cooking wine, but I don't think you need it if you have a fat brisket.

Delicious moist and tender (if you buy a good quality brisket!)  First time I made it it was delicious.  Second time I was at another supermarket and felt like having a brisket so bought one, boy what a piece of shoe leather that was!  Lesson learnt, must buy brisket from a good supermarket or butcher.
I found I did not have to add liquid to make the gravy, plenty came out of the meat, added a bit of flour and yummy gravy was made out of the juices.

This was easy and it is delicious.  I didn't have an oven bag, so I just coated the brisket with the other ingredients and shoved it into my Dutch Oven.  There was just enough liquid in the bottom to make a gravy to top some mashed potatoes I served with this meat.

Wow is this good!  Didn’t have a roasting bag so I loosely wrapped it in foil inside my cast iron lidded Dutch oven. Added a little less than 1 cup water and a beef bullion cube. It was so good. After 7 hours it was so tender and flavorful. Will definitely be doing this one again.

Absolutely delicious and very tender!  I made it for a family party and everyone gave it rave reviews.  I did change it a bit based on some reviews from others.  The changes I made were:  I rubbed on the dry brisket the ingredients in the recipe but also added a dash of thyme and onion powder and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I patted them in.  Then placed the brisket in the bag and added 1/2 cup of beef broth (which it definitely needed to make it so tender).  I added to the bag sliced onion, potatoes and carrots and near the end added some mushrooms and removed these veggies as they became ready in order to stop them from over cooking.  I also used less liquid smoke then the recipe called for (maybe used 60%).  

Changes for next time would be adding the veggies further into the cooking process rather than at the beginning.  I may also increase the amount of the hickory liquid smoke.  I found the hickory flavor was stronger in the veggies than in the roast.  This may change by adding the veggies later.  Or maybe I will increase the amount used next time.  

Best brisket I have ever made and would definitely make it again.

I used an eight pound brisket, doubled the ingredients.  After dusting the dry spices, I realized that I needed to add the liquid smoke.  So I poured the liquid smoke over the top, cooked for for 7.5 hours in the roasting bag.  My husband said the quality and taste  was better than a national chain was occasionally visit.  I agree! There is no need for a smoker.

This was a decent brisket! Cooked all day for 6 hours...I had to add more liquid twice. Very tender, pulled apart easily. Loved it as sandwiches. Not a huge fan of the sauce, but it works for a good meal!

We loved this recipe.   I did add some beef broth, though.   Maybe 1/2 c.
The flour is needed to keep the cooking bag from exploding!   That used to happen with it sometimes.

This is the best brisket.  I seasoned it according to our family's taste but otherwise it works out perfectly as written.

I was looking for an idea to make folk falling tender brisket. I've used those oven bags for my holiday turkey before but never thought to use it for my brisket!  I didn't use the liquid smoke flavoring since I was modifying my other red sause brisket recipe, instead used a can of tomato soup with a bed of vegetables. It came out great!!!

This was NOT SO TENDER!  This was shoe leather!  I followed the recipe and the time factor was waaaaaay off. Three hours would have been plenty.  I am deleting this recipe from my recipe box.

I can't believe the last few reviews - this recipe turned out great when I made it.  The meat was very tender and flavorful, and since brisket was on sale for $.99 a pound, it was very economical as well.  I made a larger quantity than called for here and sent half to a friend who was recovering from surgery.  Her family loved it and said it was the best meal they had received. Thanks for the recipe!

The brisket was 'fall apart' tender.. but we just didn't like the flavor at all.  My husband will eat anything.. but even he said to throw the left-overs away.

This brisket was very easy to fix.  I put it in the oven and left it.  The smell through the house was making everybody hungry.  My husband loved it.  I have a 6yr old who is a very picky eater, she ate two plates. The name says it all.  This was excellent and I will make it again very soon. Thank You for this recipe.

The recipe name tells the story. It was tender, and made the house smell so good while it was cooking. Very easy to make. I had everything at home already, to make this one. Everyone in family loved it.
