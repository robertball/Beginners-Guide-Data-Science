I used purple grapes (because I had them) and they were small, so I used a candy mold rather than a muffin tin. I think the shape was prettier than a muffin tin would have been anyway. These are simply whipping cream with a grape inside. Upon eating one, you get a burst of sweetness from the grape. They melt really quickly, so they can only be eaten as a quick snack rather than serving them at a party or for guests.

made this with various kinds of fruit...you can jumble it 
all in a bowl, freeze it ,& convince yourself it's better than ice cream. Or make them fun to eat : stick grapes on a kitchen skewer & roll in whipped cream (if you avoid dairy, try 
rolling in "lime juice syrup" {1 T lime juice with 2 T lite corn syrup/ sugar-water syrup}  before freezing).  yummy
