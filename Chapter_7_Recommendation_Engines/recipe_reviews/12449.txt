My mother taught me how to make this pie years ago.  It has always been a big hit with the adult crowd at parties.

I love it, but be prepared for intense flavors.  If you enjoy dark chocolate and coffee, you will love this pie!

I made this pie for my book club, and followed the recipe exactly.  As soon as they tasted it I started hearing things like, "Mmmmm," and "OMG". Everyone who tasted it loved it, including me.  It was the perfect ending to my Caribbean-themed dinner.
