I am always looking for new seafood recipes and this one will definately be a favorite.  The halibut mixture was thick and rich and very hearty.  I sauted the halibut in butter and thyme before adding it to the mushroom mixture.  I also added twice as much garlic which my husband really enjoyed.  We will definately be enjoying this recipe again.

I'm sorry but I did not care for this recipe at all.  My mom lives in Alaska and we get a bunch of halibut from her every year so I am always looking for new halibut recipes.  This had a weird texture and flavor.  I may have done something wrong as the other reviews were so positive although I followed the recipe almost exactly, which is not common for me.

Delicious recipe - I did add a little chicken stock as the sauce was a little thick.  I used non-fat sour cream - I seasoned the fish and grilled it in the oven.

I followed the recipe quite faithfully although like another reviewer I used zero fat sour cream because thatâ€™s what I happened to have. This was easy and a tasty use of leftover halibut. A win for our family!
