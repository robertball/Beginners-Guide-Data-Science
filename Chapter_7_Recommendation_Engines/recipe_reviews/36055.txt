We do this too, but we use Rolos and roast the marshmellow to the half way point then add the candy.  We love it.

It sounded really good so I thought I'd try them.  They were alright, but I didn't find it much of an improvement over just roasted marshmallows.  A bit chewier.  The caramel gets VERY hot and the marshmallow is no longer at it's peak of gooey-ness by the time the caramel is ready to eat.  Probably not worth the extra effort.

Heavenly.  The trick is heating them slowly.  I thought the same might be good w/ tootsie rolls.  Not.

I planned these more for their entertainment value than as a genuine dessert and entertaining it was.  Some of us were better at it than others but we all got a kick out of this fun and creative spin on toasted marshmallows and the result was nothing short of decadent.  The only thing I could do without is the sticky fingers! (Ooooh, how good would this be sandwiched between two graham crackers or homemade pizzelles, then drizzled with chocolate sauce? Next timeâ€¦) The best part about these will be the memories of the fun we had making them.

Okay, so I'll be honest: when I first raed this recipe I thought "what's so great about sugar upon sugar?"  Well, let me tell ya, if your taste buds don't dance for this gooey goodness, then you'd better get yourself checked out!  Being the healthy person I am, I sandwiched my caramel in between TWO marshmellows, then slid all three fire-kissed items into a bowl to cut down on the mess (by "fire-kissed" I mean that I roasted the items first, just incase you didn't catch that upon first reading).  Extra gooey, absolutely delightful.  We've definetly started a new family tradition with this little recipe!

I do this too. But I do it kind of like a smore. I roast the marshmallow till halfway done so it's gooey and the caramel is a lil melted. Nice and smooth. Then I put it on a Graham cracker and top off with a Hershey bar. Just like a smore but with caramel. Sooooo good. Great for the kids during camp trips.

I'm not a fan of camping but I love my toasted marshmallows so when I get the urge, I get out a candle and some skewers.  It takes longer, but you can control the flame better.  These work really well over the candle because you can avoid heating the caramel too much.

That said, I feel like these are missing something. Next time I'd try the marshmallow caramel inside a smore with chocolate.  I'm so used to the marshmallow/chocolate combo that I really miss it.

The caramel gets molten by the time the marshmallow is done. After the first one I pulled the caramel off and halfway roasted the marshmallow then added the caramel just to soften it a bit while the marshmallow finished cooking. Nice of pace from the norm.

I tried these with both the caramel and rollos as someone else suggested at a recent family camp excursion.  It takes a bit of perfecting to get it just right, but they were good.  I don't suggest it for small children, it's way too messy and fussy for them.  The other adults liked them.  It was fun to try something different, however, for simplicity reasons, I'll probably stick to the old fashion mallow smores.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and tried this with Rolo candies. After they melted a bit, we put them between two graham crackers. Holy cow--were these decadent! The kids are still talking about them.
