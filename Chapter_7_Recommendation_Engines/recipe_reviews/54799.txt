This tasted very authentic; we call this "anday ka halwa" and my dad makes it when we have guests over. However I think all egg halwa recipes are way too heavy and greasy so i gave it 4 stars.

Turned out just like the one i used to have at my friend's. They stored it for weeks in an airtight container so i cooled it down in chunks too rather than having it warm
