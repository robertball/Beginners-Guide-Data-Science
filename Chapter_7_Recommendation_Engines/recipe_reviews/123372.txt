We really liked this. I had read the review by LadyJayPee and made a few modifications based on that. I only used 8 eggs. And I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk. I used a bag of Potatoes O'Brien instead of hashbrowns. And added cayenne pepper, Worchestershire sauce, and dry mustard. I also made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge all night. It turned out really well! Thanks for submitting it.

This came out pretty good, my wife and father in law liked it a lot.  I added a bit of cayenne, and left out the dill weed since I didn't have any.  I was asked to make it again next weekend.

So good! I did change a few things.  That is the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars. I cooked sausage and bacon till crisp, mixed them with Oâ€™Brian potatoes, the eggs, milk and cheese. I seasoned the egg mix and baked in a casserole dish.  I t needed to cook a little longer than stated, but it was so good!  Thank you!

I honestly thought it would be too many eggs, but it was fantastic.  Perfect recipe the way it is, I made no changes.  It was the most popular dish at the holiday brunch.  Yum!!

this may not be the most refined brunch dish, but the taste combined with the ease makes it a 5 star for me.  i listened to others and my stomach to make a few changes: i did the cayenne switch for dill: i used only 9 eggs, I used half gouda/half cheddar (i think smoky gouda compliments the smokiness of bacon better), I added 2 table spoons fresh chopped parsley, and I added 1/2 cup seeded tomatoes.  It was delicious and reheated well - a key factor for a 2 person house.

So good!! I used 10 eggs instead of 12 (because I wanted to make cookies later) and it was plenty. I put shredded hash browns in the dish with some butter and cooked them for 20 minutes, then poured the egg mixture over them. Yummy!

This was a nice dish; tastes much like a frittata my husband makes.  I subbed cajun seasoning in for the dill because we're not huge fans of dill.  Thanks for the recipe, Patricia.

I am usually a little afraid of making something new like this for my husband but he took a second helping.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and baked for 45 minutes.  I did make it for "Sunday Brunch" but it will make a great holiday brunch recipe too.

Made this for Christmas day brunch, the whole family loved it! will deffinaly make it again. I made it the night before so all I had to do was give it a quick stir add the cheese and pop it in the oven. I grated potatos instead of using packaged hashbrowns, added garlic and kept out the dill weed but added some cayenne pepper and used red peppers instead of green since that is all I had in the house.

Followed recipe exactly but it turned out bland and watery.  Even after putting casserole back into the oven for 15 additional minutes, it was still  liquidy in the middle.  I use an oven thermometer to ensure my oven temp is correct, so the issue wasn't caused by incorrect baking temp.  Won't be making again.

I made this for company at brunch today. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. I combined the ingredients the night before. I used the cayenne pepper instead of dill. I used some red and green bell pepper for more color. I used turkey bacon. It's a keeper!!!

I doubled the amount of bacon by accident, but the casserole could definitely handle it. Got rave reviews at the large breakfast I hosted. I served it alongside the Weekend Brunch Casserole, which ended up being the favorite casserole of the two.

I found the hash browns didn't have enough flavor and were a little dry. The top was good.

such a versatile recipe! this is my goto for house guests so I can enjoy them and not being shackled to the kitchen. I switch it up a lot and use what I have on hand depending on the eater's tastes. Little kids love this - as long as you don't use the hottest sausage ever! hahaha  oddly, the leftovers are great. sliced, heated and placed on toast. delish!

Pretty good. I poured the hashbrowns across the bottom of the pan rather than mixing them in, and then used ham rather than bacon since that's what I had on hand. It took a lot longer to cook than stated but that always happens to me with egg dishes. I think I ended up cooking for an extra 15 minutes at a higher temperature.

This is one of my standard brunch dishes. I used to make this in the crockpot ... assemble about 10 pm the night before, then let cook on low overnight, and it was all done in the morning. But my new crockpock cooks too fast to do that anymore. I have made this for many occasions, and it's always appreciated. I usually used chopped ham instead of the bacon (more flavor, I think) and dry mustard instead of the dill. People love this, because it has everyone's favorite breakfast ingredients in one dish. Not fancy enough for you? Make a French toast casserole to go with it. A big bowl of fresh, cut-up fruit, a basket of homemade muffins or coffee cakes, a pitcher of juice, mimosas ... there's your brunch, with little effort and great taste and appreciation from everyone else. My daughters make this now for their brunches, also to rave reviews. Don't skimp on the milk, or it will be too much egg in proportion to the rest of the dish and take forever to bake.

I doubled this recipe and made it for Easter Brunch this year.  Instead of green pepper I used orange peppers, and I upped the cheese to about three cups instead of using 2.  Everyone said how much they loved it, but I thought it was only just okay.  I made, and put everything together the night before, and I think because it sat for several hours overnight, the potatoes absorbed some of the egg mixture, which slightly changed the consistency of the potatoes.  In regards to the potatoes, I also browned them in the bacon fat and added salt and pepper to them before combining them in with the eggs.  I would suggest doing this or else the casserole wouldn't have as much flavor.  Which brings me to my next point, I agree with the posters who said the dill added nothing.  Next time i will leave this ingredient out and maybe throw in some garlic, onion powder, and pepper instead.  If you don't have the dill, I would not run out and get it just for this recipe.  All in all, it seemed to be a crowd pleaser.

Love it.  Changes: Evap. milk for regular, and no spices whatsoever (b/c i'm a weird one and like ketchup on my eggs), and mixed sharp cheddar and mozzarella cuz thats what i had.  put potatoes in bottom of dish, then bacon and cheese, poured egg and veggie mix over top and just let it soak down before baking.  DELICIOUS.  Thank you.

For a great bacon free version:  I used Ore-Ida O'Brien brand potatoes.  (this brand tastes the best to me) Since they have peppers and onions added, I did not add chopped peppers and onions.  I used more of the potatoes (4 1/4 C) to make up the volume.  I added a more cheese (used 2 C).  All other ingredients remained the same.  My family loved it!

My family LOVES this casserole. I have made it for Christmas Brunch for the last 10 years. No one ever tires of it. The only thing I changed was I added more bacon because we are bacon lovers, other than that the recipe is PERFECT just the way it is.

This was good, but not great.  I didn't have any dill, so I used cayenne pepper per others' suggestions (probably could have used more of it!). It's a very easy way to feed lots of people, but I didn't think it was super special. Maybe the potatoes were too unexciting?

I made this exactly the same except I  browned Andouille Sausage along with the onions and after I had everything mixed together, I realized that I didn't have any hashbrowns. So I used shoe string cut french fries and it still turned out wonderful!

This was the BEST egg dish I've ever made! I added 1/2 lb pork sausage and used a red bell pepper instead of green. I also used real potatoes instead of frozen just b/c I was out. And I left out the dill weed.

For what it is, this is fantastic. I served it in the morning for a bachelorette party and it went faster than I thought possible. I did not have frozen hash browns, so I peeled and sliced 2 potatoes, boiled them for 3 minutes, and used them. I also subbed cumin for the dill.

I served this to company and everyone enjoyed it.  One of my guests has a wheat allergy so I could not use my cresent roll egg casserole recipe and didn't even miss it!  I usually put the casserole in the oven with foil on top but remove it half way through the cooking.  I find the eggs set faster this way and prevent the edges from browning as you wait for the center to cook through.

very good!  I made this as part of the food spread for a morning baby shower.  I had never made anything like this or eaten anything like it before but i was pleasantly surprised!  had a couple requests for the recipe too.  I used extra bacon and I used "simply potatoes" brand shredded hash browns.

This casserole was fabulous!  I didn't have green peppers on hand and so I used a small can of green chilis, which added wonderful flavor.  It was a big hit - thank you!

This was easy as well as tasty.  I can not eat wheat...this is the only breakfast casserole I have ever seen without bread or a can of soup.  I did omit the dill and bell pepper, I did add 4 oz of green chillies.  Outstanding.

Made this with a few alterations posted by other reviewers:  Used 8 eggs & 1 1/2 cup cheese - mixed it all up and put in casserole pan and baked.  Turned out really good, made night before so that morning all I had to do was put in oven for a hour.  Easy!

Made this for my sons Preschool Holiday brunch. Every single piece was gone! I received many compliments on it. I used a pound of breakfast sausage instead of the bacon and used a cup of evaporated milk. I only had an orange pepper so I used that. I think it's really important to season your veggies as they are cooking as well. Came out great--will be making it for Christmas morning :)

This recipe was very easy and turned out superb! I made the following changes, according to our taste. First, I halved the recipe because there's only 2 of us and cooked it in an 8x8 square dish. Secondly, I substituted freshly diced potatoes for the frozen hash browns. I browned the diced potatoes for a few minutes on the stove before adding them to the egg mixture. Lastly, I used thyme instead of dill because i had some fresh thyme on hand and it was great! I will make this recipe often, for sure!

Love this, I followed the advice of other comments and used 8 eggs and ore ida's potatoes o'brien mix. I refrigerated overnight the first time and used sour cream because it was all I had and it was still yummy. The second time it came out even better, I used more bacon (turkey both times) and condensed milk. easy and yummy!

I only had 6 eggs, and I used thawed tator tots and crumbled them up.  I also left out the dill and used a bit of cayenne and Tony's.  Made it the night before.  GOOD!!!

All I have to say is yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!!!! Came together very easily! I made some minor alterations--I burned the bacon (oops) so I used jimmy deanbreakfast sausage instead. My son is picky about veggies so i left out the green peppers (sure it would be even better if they were in there!!) and used scallions AND onions. I don't like dill so I used adobo instead. Will definitely make this again!! Thanks!

We doubled the bacon to a full pound, doubled the cheese, and used a full pepper and a full medium onion.  Adds more flavor.  My kids LOVE it for breakfast, dinner, anytime!

Absolutely delicious!  I used a whole package of bacon (500g/1lb).  I think the amount of bacon was great...just will omit the salt next time if I double the bacon.  Others said it was just right, not too salty...  Anyways this recipe is a keeper for sure!

This was perfect! I did make a few changes, but it was a great base recipe and all my guests liked it. 

I substituted sausage for the bacon. I didn't use onion and green pepper. Instead, I chopped up a few green onions and mixed them in.

The flavors balanced just right, and it wasn't too heavy. I'll definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe for an a.m. company potluck.  I had never made a casserole like this.  It turned out really great!  Everyone loved it.  The only thing was that the store was out of regular hashbrown potatoes, so I substituted Crisy Crowns (aka Tater Tots).  They worked really well!  If you're shopping for a good breakfast/brunch casserole, this is the one for you!

Not a glamorous dish by any means, but this casserole is easy to put together and very good. I skipped the dill, subbing some chipotle pepper, used only 10 eggs because mine were very large, and topped the casserole with some extra cheese.  It would probably be fine to make the night before and bake in the morning.

I've used this (or very similar) recipes many times. I've introduced asparagus, swiss, mushrooms, grn onions, ham, bacon, whatever! I like to "par bake" the nite before and finish next morning. I've found that the number of *eggs can vary widely*...but I bake it more as a "pie-crust of hash browns" *then* add meats, cheeses, eggs. Take your time, use your eyes before mixing in the eggs, and you'll be just fine! JS2

This is a great casserole...very tasty & very festive.  The only thing I changed is...I added 6 slices of Oscar Mayer deli ham, 3 Jimmy Dean sausage links & both red & green pepper.  Eveyrthing else was perfect and very good.

I halved the recipe, being that there were only 3 of us to eat it.  I used sausage and bacon. I put it into an 8x8 pan and it took forever to get set in the center.  Probably 50 min or so.  I was surprised since the original recipe was supposed to be in a 9x13 in pan.  I was not a fan of the potatoes inside, it made it a little dry.  Next time I will leave them out and cook them on their own to have on the side.  I will make this again and adjust as needed.  It was great to make it the night before and not have much to do in the morning except throw it in the oven!

We have made this many times.  We make it exactly as directed using low fat bacon, eggs from our chickens, and skim milk.  It comes out great every time!  It's wonderful when we are having company for breakfast, since it is prepared the night before.  We have also taken it with us in our travel trailer on camping trips.  Easy, convenient, and yummy!

this was our Christmas breakfast this morning, very good I too partially cooked the hashbrowns in the dish first, I precooked turkey sausages, sliced them and made a layer over the hashbrowns before pouring the egg mixture over it, I also added sliced mushrooms. the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the dill did'nt really add much too it, I'd use another herb next time. Thank you to the origional poster for this recipe, my SIL always makes the wife saver recipe and it never sits well with me, too much white bread for my system, this recipe is a definate keeper.

i followed this recipe like it said except i did take the advice of one reviewer and cooked the hashbrown in the casserole dish first then put the rest of the ingredients and placed it back in the oven. the hashbrowns turn out so much better that way. my husband loved this dish. thanks for sharing!

I made this for a New Year's brunch and everyone loved it! I left the dill out becuase I was afraid its flavor would be too strong. I also did the bacon, onions and peppers the day before to save time the day of. This will be a staple entertaining recipe from now on!

LOVE this recipe! It's simple, and a perfect way to have everyone served brunch at the same time. Great as leftovers, too. As another reviewer mentionned, it's not the most refined dish, but what it lacks in looks, it makes up in taste. Thanks for sharing!

I thought I was going to like this more than I did.  I didn't put in the dill (don't care for it), subbed a red pepper for green, used a little extra bacon.  I think it was the shredded potatoes that did it for me; I didn't like the texture it gave the casserole.  I was looking for it to be a little smoother.  I assembled it, then let it sit overnight before baking; I doubt that had any effect on it, though.  My mother loved it, so I'm giving it four stars.  On my own, it'd probably be 3; I was a little disappointed since I love eggs, bacon and breakfast potatoes on their own.  For myself, I guess I'll settle for keeping 'em separate.  :)  All in all, a good brunch dish, though.  I'd consider making it again.

I made this for Mothers day and it was good. I made just a few changes. I brownded the hash brownds so they where crispy to eat inside. Also i fresh graded the cheese large this made it full of melted goodness. Lastly MORE BACON!

I was pretty unsure about this one, but we had a potluck brunch to go to and I had no idea what to make. This was awesome, and I don't even like green peppers or onions. I made it with turkey bacon. It was a hit at the brunch.

I tried this recipe after trying another on here and not liking it. This had more flavor, I like the dill, but next time would add more spices like are mentioned in the reviews. The texture was the main complaint, thrash browns get kind of mushy, maybe the O'Brien potatoes would be better since they have a firmer texture. I added a chopped red pepper as well and liked the color and flavor. I topped mine with a little more cheese and then cornflakes, which helped the texture. I didn't feel it was too many eggs at all, there was quite a bit of potato, veggie, and bacon mixture to cover and it was perfect in my 9x13.

I'm a complete beginner when it comes to cooking, and was happy that it turned out great! We really enjoyed it, and will definitely make it again. Unfortunately, I didn't have all of the ingredients in the house, so had to improvise a bit. We substituted jalapeno turkey sausage for the bacon, and rosemary potatoes for the hash browns. Turned out good, but I think it would have been even better if I'd been able to follow the recipe exactly! Thanks for the submission!

Quite delicious!  I also used O'Brien potatoes and it worked beautifully.  I used 9 eggs and 12 oz of evaporated milk.  Mixed it up the night before and stuck it in the fridge overnight.  It was gobbled up by everyone the next morning!

Make again. Put in chili powder instead of dill. Try pieces of sauteed potato.

Disappointing. Too many eggs, not enough cheese, weird texture. Nephews said it was like an egg meatloaf - nobody took 2nds. Crustless Spinach Quiche and Amish Breakfast Casserole HUGE hit and totally GONE in minutes - crowd of 20. Thank godness this was not the only thing I made !

Always amazing as written.  Today I tried with turkey bacon, egg sub, skim cheese and home shredded raw potatoes.  WOW!  Still good.  Great recipe.

For some reason my potatoes were not cooked all the way. I used the OBrien's and they were thawed but still after 45 min. they were not done. Will try again using the shredded hash browns.
