I used this recipe to can over half the beets in my garden. I think the pickling mixture is perfect and wouldn't change a thing!

I used fresh beets from my garden, steamed them until tender, then put them in a large bowl of cold water, and had no pink fingers by peeling them underwater! Otherwise my hands turn beet red! 
I also used one of those rippled french fry cutters to slice them - a simple hand held tool.
I canned some in pint jars (made 4 pints),
and will enjoy beets in the dead of winter.
This recipe is tasty- just the right spice mix.

This is a wonderful recipe -- it reminds me of my grandmother's homemade pickled beets.  I used fresh beets, boiled about 15 min, then peeled, and I added some hardboiled eggs.  I marinated everything for a couple of days to make sure it really got that flavor!

Absolutely delicious! I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe except I continued cooking the mixture about 1 or 2 minutes after adding the onion to soften a bit.  I will make this again and share the recipe with pride.

Soooooo easy! I think I did this in under 10 minutes.  BTW - 2 1/2 cups is 2 14.5 oz cans worth of sliced beets.

I don't think I have ever eaten beets before. My avid gardener Aunt brought me some fresh from her garden and I made this recipe. YUM! I know the recipe calls for canned beets, but I needed to use mine! I found another recipe describing cooking beets (boil for 45 minutes, rinse in cold water so the skins peel right off...which they did!) Be sure to save some of the water from boiling the beets to serve as the beet juice needed in recipe. I had red all over my kitchen...new appreciation for the term "beet red!" but it cleaned up easily and the beets taste surprisingly great. Kind of exotic tasting with the spices. Thanks for opening up my thinking to beets!

This is an excellent recipe for beet lovers. I added a cinnamon stick to the recipe. I also add hard boiled eggs along with the beets and onions.

These are delicious! Personally, I double up on the spices, but they definitely get better and more flavorsome the longer you leave them! The onion tastes absolutely fantastic too. Thanks so much, Bea!

Yummy! I use a spoonful of packaged "mixed pickling spices" in the vinegar mixture instead of the separate spices, it is the perfect blend for pickled beets. The longer you marinate, the better it gets, so make a double batch! Small whole canned beets work just as well too.

This is as good a recipe as you will find for pickled beets.  I too cooked it long enough for the onions to soften as they become part of the beets.  I think I will also add a cinnamon stick in the next batch.  Thanks.

Delish!  Our family loves beet salad, so I am always on the look-out for new recipes to give us a bit of variety.  This recipe was pretty close to what I have used for years, but the addition of the spices added just that special "something".  I used fresh, roasted beets, and I added a small cinnamon stick, as suggested by another reviewer, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  This is a keeper, for sure!

It definaty sets you up with the MAIN BASE that delivers better than store bought.  I left the last star open for yourself to add extra flavors which I did with fresh ground coriender and such for extra flavors.

I gave this 5 stars even though I made some changes.  It is such a great base recipe. After reading the reviews,  I added 1/4t cinnamon, doubled the "pickling juice" ingredients, and refrigerated it over night.  It was awesome!

This recipe was yummy. I used fresh beets from my garden (saved and used some cooking liquid), I also added 2 cinnamon sticks. I let the beets and onion cook for just a few minutes in the pickling juice, and let them chill/marinate overnight. Awesome.

I can't say enough about how fabulous these are.  By FAR the best pickled beets ever.  So much more depth of flavor than plain vinegar/sugar/onion versions, and so easy.  I was out of whole cloves, so I used a tiny bit of ground (it goes a long way, so be restrained) and it worked just fine.  I deliberately used whole beets that I cut in half, and let it marinade 48 hours, and it was perfect.  Wish I could give it 10 stars!

A guy at work gave my husband some fresh beets from his garden.  I had NO idea what to do with them.  But I tried this and another recipe from this site, and both were excellent.  I'm not a big fan of pickled beets, but these were delish!  Thanks.

I've tried more than a handful of pickled beet recipes, but this is the one to which I always return.  Like other reviewers before me, however, I do double the whole spices and tuck a cinnamon stick in for good measure.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago and loved it.  I did however add more sugar and a stick of cinnamon.  I don't have a garden so I bought canned beets that were on sale at the grocer.  Any brand will do.  I make them in bulk so I use 10 cans of beets, which makes about 10 pint jars.  Multiply everything about 5 times.  For every cup of vinegar I used about 3/4 cup of sugar.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

Loved this.  Spices were just right.  I used fresh beets (so therefore did not have any beet juice and added extra water instead) and it still turned out well.  I also did not have apple cider vinegar on hand so used white wine vinegar instead.  Very tasty!

I forgot I had saved this recipe because I have memorized it.  This is a staple at our house.  Love it just the way it is written, except I leave out the onions since my family doesn't care for onions.

Don't usually like beets but they're so healthy, wanted to find something that made them edible. This recipe is it. Great on a salad or a garnish for a martini.

Very good.  This recipe is as close to my Grandma's pickled beets (home-grown; home-canned) as I have found.  I suppose I won't really be able to replicate those beets without putting forth a little more effort...starting a garden, for example!  But these are very good.

This is a very good recipe. We really liked it. Our only problem, a bit strong on the cloves. I will cut back next time but other than that this is a good old fashioned recipe!

I used fresh beets for this recipe, and added extra on the spices. I made them a few days ahead so the seasoning could really develop.  They were a big hit. Most recipes call for more sugar, so I was really glad these didn't.  Very good, will be making them again for my next BBQ.

Definitely make it again (have already made it twice.) The bay leaves and cloves really notch up the taste.

I used 5 medium fresh beets, boiled and sliced, used the boiled beet liquid and omitted the bay leaf (personal taste preference). These were excellent and so easy to make.  I didn’t have whole cloves, so used a pinch of ground.

Outstanding.  I used small quartered fresh beets and was successful with the ice-bath-cooling method immediately after cooking so skins weren't too much of a hassle. Rubber gloves are a beet peeler's best friend.  Added 1 t. pickling spice to each pint jar & combined 1 t. pickling spice with the peppercorns and cloves  tied into a cheesecloth ball for boiling in brine. A large tea infusion ball can work very well for these small batches. Excellent excellent recipe!

I have been making pickled beets this way for years but I leave out the pepper corns and bay leaf and add pickling spices -- the amount depends on how many cans of beets I use -- to the vinegar/sugar mixture.  Most do not realize that the beets are canned.  Have also made them with fresh beets.
