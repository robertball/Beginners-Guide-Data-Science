I made quite a few changes to this recipe, that suited my family's tastes and made this a delicous new ways to have peas.  First I used two cans of peas instead of one.  I omitted water chestnuts and instead of a cracker topping I used durkee french fried onions.  I test ran this at Easter with 15 guests to great reviews - this warmed up excellently and is a great make ahead option.

This is similar to a dish my grandmother made, and it is excellent.  Even if you aren't a fan of peas, I bet you will like this! Leseur baby peas are my favorite brand to use for this recipe, and you can use Cream of Mushroom soup in stead of Celery and skip the water chestnuts, and it is still delicious. Whenever I make it, there is never any left!

Very easy to make and quickly devoured.  I'll double it next time, as it didn't even come close to 8 servings. I used frozen peas and baked 40 minutes; I think 30 minutes would have been better. Substituted a packaged 4-cheese blend and it was very tasty.  I used Ritz crackers; the topping was great!

Delicious! I substituted cream of onion soup for cream of celery soup and left out the onions. I also used 2 cups of frozen peas instead of the canned peas. The frozen peas hold up better than the canned peas and don't get mushy on you. Great recipe! Will definitely do it again.

Great recipe!  I leave out the chestnuts.  Instead of canned peas, I use 15 ounces of frozen petite peas.  Also use Ritz crackers for topping.

I make this often and sometimes add diced cooked chicken breast.  This dish and a salad makes a quick meal.

We liked this alot! You could easily have put 2 cans of peas in that amount of sauce though and it would fare well. I'll do that next time.

I served this casserole at a potluck with a gathering of friends.  Everyone liked it.  I particularly liked the crunchiness of the water chestnuts, and the topping gave it a nice touch.  I used a 15 oz. bag of frozen peas instead of canned. The cracker topping gave it a nice finish.

We didn't think much of this. If I were to make it again, I would leave out the water chestnuts - we didn't like the crunchiness in this at all. Thanks anyway.

LOVED IT!!!  I am a BIG pea lover and am so happy to have a different way to eat peas.  I used a bag of frozen peas, left out the pimentos, onion and chestnut, and used cream of potato instead.  DEE-LI-CIOUS!  You could also add anything else you like:  bacon, ham, potatoes, carrots, etc.  I LOVE THIS and will always make it.  Thank you for this recipe!  PS   I tried fried onions on top, and that was good, but the crackers and butter are really the best!

3 year old granddaughter had 5 helpings of this for Christmas!  Enough said!

Doubled all except soup and crushed crackers to serve family of 14 for Christmas. It reminds me of the inside of a delicious pot pie, not fussy, just warming and good.

This dish was a nice side dish.  I did not have chestnuts, so I used carrot.  I also used frozen peas instead of canned, it has much fresher taste.  The best part is I did not have buttery crackers, so I used stove top turkey stuffing for the top.  It worked out just fine and gave a richer flavor.  I know I would also love the buttery cracker as well.  This was a fast, easy quick, healthy and good side dish.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times and it always turns out great!  I use 2 cans of peas, mix the cheese in with the peas, and halved the topping.  Very quick and easy!

Made this at the last minute for Thanksgiving when I realized we were missing something green.  My husband loved it!  Much better than the typical "green bean casserole."  I didn't have crackers, so I used, of all things, the bran flakes from a box of raisin bran.  I also used frozen peas, since thats what we had.  I microwaved it (minus the topping) for 5 minutes then put it in the oven (with the topping) for about 10 minutes.  Not bad for deciding to cook a veggie right when we took the turkey out of the oven.

as a disclaimer, i've never been one to count calories or shy away from lots of butter or cream... but this was pretty heavy and gross. my whole house reeked of an overwhelming smell of butter and i probably took off 5 years of my lifespan with this meal. 

it wasn't horrible, but i won't be making it again. if you decide to make it though, i left out the water chestnuts per several suggestions, but i think it would have helped the flavor/texture to leave them in. i used canned peas as listed, but i think using frozen peas would make it feel less like an institutional meal. also, i would cut the amount of butter in half (the ritz crackers will provide plenty) - don't use margarine - it's transfat!

I left out the pimento, water chestnuts but should have left out those plus the tomatoes and cream of celery.  I think the celery soup threw it off for me.  Next time, I'll stick with my peas, onions with salt/pepper and not mess with good enough.

I took this to a church dinner, and NO ONE cared for it. It was runny and flavorless in my opinion. And the cheese topping just did not fit with the dish, I am not sure why?

This has taken the place of green bean casserole at our holiday table!  It is so flavorful.  I would cut back on the butter a little bit, but otherwise, I make it as is.

At the time of making this recipe I completely forgot about the water chestnuts so I left them out.  My husband absolutely loved this casserole.  I made it for a family gathering without the water chestnuts again and everyone raved about it.  I give this a 5 star rating without the water chestnuts only because I've never used them and fear it may mess it up... Thanks for this simple and easy recipe that everyone seems to LOVE!  Just for the record, I did have to double the recipe to take to the family gathering as it would not be enough if I had not.

One of my new favorite sides, although I used the comments from other reviewers and left out the pimento and water chestnuts and used Cream of Mushroom for the soup.  I used two cups of frozen peas and also added an 8 oz carton of fresh mushrooms, lightly sauteed until juices were released...definitely a  worthy addition!  Excellent and easy side dish!

Delicious and easy!  Didn't include the water chestnuts or the onion 'cause of my family's tastes....still a winner!  Oh, and I did use two cans of peas.

This was an excellent recipe. The water chestnuts added a nice crunch. I only ussed 1/2 the amount of topping, and it was just right.
