I love this recipe. I call it Buttermilk Brownies. I noticed she forgot to add the 1 tsp of baking powder to the ingredients!! I don't cook it any longer than 20 minutes no matter how gooey it is cause it continues to cook after you pull it out. I also use dark cocoa powder instead of regular!!! yummmy

Good flavor... and certainly quick moist and yummy but... I was struck by the absence of leavening (other than eggs) in the recipe. Not sure if this is an error or purposeful; does make for a VERY heavy cake (which didn't rise much at all) -- more like fudge than a cake...

As written only the above rating.  It requires 1 tsp. of  baking soda - at least that is what I find.

I hate to leave a bad review too but it just wasn't good without baking powder. This reminds me of the time I made a cola cake and forgot the baking powder. Only the cola cake was better. Sorry!

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this. I thought it was weird not having baking powder in the ingredients. It came out terrible. A big waste of the ingredients I did use in making it.

I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews before making this cake. I am normally a great baker and was thus perplexed as to why it had come out so horribly! It was very dense and was indeed more of a fudge consistency but overall just bad.
