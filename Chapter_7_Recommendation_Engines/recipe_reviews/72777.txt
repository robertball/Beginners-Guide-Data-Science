YUM. I made this with sauted spiced chicken breast instead of lamb, left out the olive oil and the mint (store was out of it) and used a low fat sun dried tomato feta. Very good and very filling. I tried this hot and cold and preferred this served hot. I have leftovers for later this week.. can't wait.

This is a really recipe.  Be warned that the prep time is longer than 15 minutes.  It take awhile to wash and chop all the ingredients.

This was wonderful although I made several substitutions.  I used chicken breast instead of lamb, oregano intead of coriander, red pepper instead of tomato & red onion instead of green onion.  Ordinarily, I don't make this many changes to a recipe but I used what I had on hand and it turned out delicious in any case.  Try it with chicken and oregano!!

Very good! I made the following changes: used ground lean turkey instead of lamb; used sundried tomatoes instead of fresh; added sliced black olives; and added a bit of rosemary and paprika. I did not use the coriander or mint. I also blanched te spinach. The feta cheese was a great addition; with the warm orzo and meat it just blended in and gave it a very savory flavor. How wonderful to make an orzo dish without a stick of butter!

Fabulous! My husband and in-laws raved. I used about half the called for lamb and may use a little less next time although we are not big carnivores. I might also lightly rinse the meat after cooking and add the coriander later as the meat was a bit greasy. All the flavors were wonderful!!!

My family loved this recipe! I used chicken breast instead of lamb and omitted the coriander because I don't care for it. We enjoyed it warm, and I did wilt the spinach a bit before mixing. I gave it four stars because the taste of the parsley didn't add anything and actually detracted from the wonderful flavors a bit. The feta cheese in this recipe was a fantastic choice! I will definitely make this again but will double the recipe for the 6 of us and enjoy the leftovers the next day. In fact, I think I will make it for company next week. They'll love it!

I had tons of leftover lamb, so I tried this recipe w/ lamb leftovers cut into small bite size pieces and doubled the orzo pasta. It was awesome! I will definately try this and experiment with a variey of meats.

Great recipe!  I really like the orzo paired with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  I substituted ground turkey for lamb.

My wife doesn't like tomatoes, so I substituted a combination of chopped Greek olives (green, kalamata).  Also subbed 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion for green onion.  This has become a go-to dish and family favorite.

This is a really delicious recipe and my famly loved it.  I put what was left over in the refrigerator and the next day after Church it tasted even better.  My wife like it because it is a healthy recipe.  The lemon really adds a wonderful citrus flavor.  This one is a keeper.

I have made this dish twice now and it came out great both times. The reason I deducted one star was because the salad gets very dry and I had to add oil several times just to make sure the ingredients don't all stick together. I guess if you ate it all at one meal and had no leftovers, then the tackiness would not be an issue.

Very hearty with that great twist of coriander! I used frozen spinach that I thawed under water. I also made this a vegetarian dish by leaving out the meat and also the feta. After cooking and cooling the orzo, I added the tomato (just 1 1/2), lemon juice, parsley, mint and green onion. I sauteed the garlic and added the spinach and then flavored with the coriander, salt and pepper while in the skillet. Served it warm. Interesting!

Delish! This is the first time I've rated a recipe and this one deserves it. Very easy dish and my husband suggested I add this to the rotation every couple weeks! I substituted ground turkey for the lamb as lamb has a high fat content, I also added some kalimata olives but left everything else the same. I would happily make this dish for company.

DELICIOUS!  My fiance and I both loved it.  I actually chose to wilt the spinach mixture from step 3 to make it more of a warm main course, but it was so good I'm positive it would be fantastic as written.  Cheers!

Left out the mint and doubled the parsley, that's what I had on hand. And left out the tomatoes and used sundried tomato feta.  Used two medium lemons. DH gave his stamp of approval, the lamb was awesome and I suggest using it if you can.

I make this often using firm tofu instead of lamb. I cook the tofu just as the lamb but practically double the seasonings. This salad is a meal unto itself.

"A big POW for the taste buds," my husband said. I had added a few dashes of cinnamon to the sauteeing meat, as in Arabic and Greek recipes, because the coriander taste seemed too stong. I used a bit (1/2 tsp?) of dried mint for fresh. If it seems bland, try the addition of LEMON PEPPER--really worked!

Yum-O!  This was a great little meal that my dd even ate!  It was a bit greasy, next time will drain the meat better.  We also used low-fat feta and less mint than the recipe calls for - it turned out ab fab.

I followed this very closely, so I feel good about saying that I don't think it's anything I did.  I note now that a few reviewers before me indicate they left out the mint for one reason or another.  The mint did definitely do its part in ruining this dish.

I had a garden overflowing with mint a few years ago when I stumbled upon this recipe. We would make it very regularly, sometimes leaving out meat all together or substituting other meats, but lamb is definitely the best. I made this again yesterday for the first time in a long time exactly as directed and it was perfect. Even the 2 year old thinks it's delicious.

It was a big hit and so simple.  I added lots of lemon zest too.

Delicious!! I made it to go with the Kofta Kebabs (Lamb Meatballs) recipe....also fabulous!  I used 6 cups of spinach leaves (versus four), but otherwise made it exactly as written. My husband was raving about it.... and he's not even a big lamb fan. It's light and refreshing, but the lamb, orzo, and feta give it enough substance to make it into a main entree.

This will be even better tomorrow when I get some feta to add to the leftovers.  I had a pound of ground lamb, and thought I had the ingredients, but when I fixed it I found I didn't have any gluten free orzo, so I used brown rice which takes about 40 minutes to cook, ran out of olive oil after browning the meat, so used organic butter for the greens, discovered I didn't have spinach, so used swiss chard leaves chopped, found I didn't have a lemon or the lime I thought I had, so used apple cider vinegar, and oops, my fresh mint was gone, so used dried soaked in some apple cider vinegar to soften, yeah had the parsley, had to sub leeks for the green onions, and had no feta, which I always have!   It still turned out good, and after I have the Feta tomorrow it will be even yummier.  Sometime I will have to try it with all of the ingredients on hand!      
UPDATE after making it - the next day I added feta to the leftovers.  I liked it better before the addition of Feta!

Wife approved which means it was delish. Followed almost exactly - used frozen spinach and cooked with red onion as that's what the pantry had.

Tasted great - even approved by an 8 year old.

Very yummy; I didn't have coriander so I subbed curry and it was delicious. I also subbed lamb cubes (stew meat). Would definitely make again!

I did not have any ground lamb so I used 2 bonesless chicken breasts.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I wanted it served hot so just added in the spinach at the end until it wilted slightly.  I made it for my daughter and I as a main course.  As a main course for the two of us it would have served four people.  If my husband was home this amount would have served two.

Awesome. This recipe is surprisingly good.  The only add that I had was ground turkey to satisfy my husband's need for "meat".  Crumbles (fake meat) would be just as good and give extra protein.

This recipe was ok but nothing amazing.  I used ground beef but it was very bland after browning it that I had to add more coriander and I added cumin to make it tastier.  I also sauteed the spinach with some garlic just for a second to add more flavor because overall if I hadn't the dish would be very bland.

forget the spinach. if no scallions, brown regular onions while browning the lamb. after mixing everything together, bake for 25 minutes.

I changed this a lot, but thanks for the basic idea. I made lamb patties, seasoned them w/ garlic, paprika, basil, parsley, black pepper, and a little feta chz and grilled them. Then I took a can of Italian style tomatoes and put it in the skillet and let it come to a boil on med high heat. Then I added frozen spinach that was cooked and drained, extra green onions, garlic, the lemon it called for, and mushrooms instead of orzo. I left out any oil that it called for. Other than the high content of fat in ground lamb, this was a quick, healthy meal (and the whole dish doesn't get greasy from cooking the lamb in the skillet w/ the veggies).

A really great flavor.  I used frozen spinach and it worked really well.  A delicious dish that is easy to make.

I vegetarianized this recipe. In addition to the lemon juice I used white wine vinegar with the evoo to make a nice vinaigrette. Use whatever favorite vegetables you like, orzo is super easy and flexible.

A very interesting combination of flavors.  I live in Iowa and it is difficult to get lean lamb here.  The ground lamb available is very high in fat, so even though I browned and drained it well, the dish seemed a bit greasy.  The fresh lemon and feta are essential.  Didn't have mint so I left it out.  Will make again to please my husband, who loves Greek food.
