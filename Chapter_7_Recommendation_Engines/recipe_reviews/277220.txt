I liked it, I would have liked to make double the frosting next time because there was barely enough following the recipe. After refrigerating overnight the cake was really good, a few spots where the frosting was a little sparser were dry which is why I would recommend making 1.5x the frosting recipe in the future. The texture feels similar to firm lady finger in a tiramisu to me and the flavor is very subtle, I got the honey flavor from the frosting more. Would make again! Was really fun to make a cake using silpats and I think from now on I will make all my cakes 8 layer on silpats because the frosting can be more evenly distributed through 8 layers and it gives that perfect frosting to cake ratio in every bite! Thanks Chef John! :)

Was a big hit.  I did make a couple alterations, used half as much Cardamon instead of Cinnamon, and a touch more honey in the whipped cream... which was amazing.  Very well might use honey sweetened whipped cream  in other recipes in the future as well.

What a delicious, impressive final product! And not an overly-sweet cake or icing at all. Everyone was delighted at my daughter’s Thanksgiving dinner. Kudos!!

This cake is really something else and worth every second of it. Thank you so much for the delicious recipe, the entire family loved it, I’m planning on making this for Christmas and was wondering if I can make the cake batter in advance and freeze all the layers without the cream and the day before make the whipped cream and assemble it. 
This is a new favorite in our family.

The worst news is the cake has to refrigerate overnight. Mine is sitting in the fridge and the whole family is pretty upset it won’t be ready until tomorrow.

One tip, the crumbs should be super fine and dry and fluffy in order to cover the sides using the method in the video. I thought mine was pretty fine but not fine enough. The crumbs didn’t bounce back like in the video and it wasn’t light enough.

Thanks chef John. Glade to match a face to the voice and hands.

Worth every second of the 5 hours it took me to make this. Don't be intimidated, it just takes a little time!

It is time consuming but well worth it.  I used honey from local bee keepers which worked wonderfully well.

So unique.  The cake gets better the longer it sits in the fridge.  The honey flavor is fantastic, and it appeals to most because it isn’t overly sweet.  I’d consider making to take to an event next time.

One of the most satisfying and delicious recipes ever. Worth the “little” effort. The worst is to leave it overnight - which you must do.

I used gluten free equal measure flour and it came out wonderfully!
