I made this for dinner, my family loves to have breakfast items for dinner. I used real crab because I had some left after Superbowl Sunday.  They were really tasty, perfect blend of flavors.  Next time I will probably use larger muffin cups if I am making them for a meal.  The miniature ones are appetizer size.

We used a full size muffin tin, so I doubled the eggs milk and cheese and followed the recipe after that.  My daughter (13) made most of it and the flavor was good and it was easy. We will make this again.

This was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! Like others I used the big muffin pan and it made 6 perfect size quiche! I added mushrooms, red and green bell peppers and garlic. I also used 1% milk and low fat cheese because we are dieting.  These were so easy to make!

I was cleaning out my pantry this weekend and came across a couple cans of crab meat that I felt needed to get used up.  Mostly because I am not sure what century I put them into the pantry to begin with!  When I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it so the cans stayed out on the counter until Sunday morning.  Sunday morning rolled around and within no time at all, these little guys popped out of the oven.  Such an easy recipe (my favorite kind on Sunday mornings) to put together.  I have to confess, I used collard greens because the market was out of spinach (how is that even possible?) and I used heavy cream instead of milk because I had some that needed to be used up.  None the less, these little guys were really easy to throw together, looked great and tasted wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper and I know I will be making these little guys again in the future soon.  Thanks for sharing.

These were very good.  I used a full size muffin pan.  I used the same measurements, but added 2 extra egg-white and used a total of about 1-1/4 c imitation crab meat.  I used more cheddar in place of the asiago cheese and I also threw in some green onions... I only used one so next time I will add more and maybe I'll add a little more cheese next time too.  Overall, very good and I will be making them again, but with a few more changes in an attempt to make it 5 stars. :-)

Loved this recipe , made this for a breakfast brunch it was easy to make . It was a big hit with the family . This wil be a go to recipe from now on . My husband loved it and he doesn't like crab . I put the crab meat in diced in the blender and it was amazing it mixed in with the spinach so much easier . I recomend this recipe to anyone who likes healthy choices .

It is fabulous. Great with real crab. It did take me much longer to prepare, but I'm not the quick type.

I love that I can use any protein, dairy, and veggies and as long as I stick to these ratios I have a great quiche!

Every agreed the taste was great, but I should've heeded the reviewers that advised using regular-sized muffin tins. It was a mess getting the egg mixture in and getting the finished product out was a bear, too. Will try again with the larger tins.

I kept the recipe almost as-is except used real crab meat (c'mon, splurge!), did not add salt (cheese is salty enough) and also used a standard 12-cup pan. I have a heavy hand, probably had a bit more cheese than called for as well. Made a nice addition to my luncheon buffet table.
