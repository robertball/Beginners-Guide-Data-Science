very nice recipe! I had both beets and buttermilk in my fridge, and wondered what to do with them both. searched for both terms and found this recipe. It was yummy and easy! I used fresh beets. washed and trimmed them up, cut them into chunks and boiled/steamed them in water. I blended some of the beets up using a hand blender. Part of the reason why it might have been so tasty was because I used a combination of full-fat buttermilk and full-fat greek yogurt (what I had in the fridge).

Grew up with this hot weather treat. We never waited for it to chill... Just make as described in 5 minutes and then add a tray of ice cubes (kid's love the ice cubes) stir and serve immediately! Don't be shocked that it looks like pepto bismol...lol

This is so delicious! My daughter recently had her wisdom teeth out and I offered to fix dinner for her family of six that night. I wanted to make a cold soup since it's been very hot and I chose this because she loves beets. Everyone loved it! Her 1 year old baby went around the table "sharing" from everyone else's bowls. Thanks for the great recipe
