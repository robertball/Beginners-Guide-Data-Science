There was obviously a mistake on the pepper part of the recipe.  It should have read teaspoon, NOT tablespoon!  I put half of what they called for and it was SO peppery we ended up throwing it away - which is too bad, because other than that it had a great flavor and was quick and easy to make.  I just couldn't handle my lips burning after each bite from the pepper!  I'll try it again!

My whole family LOVED this recipe!  It was a bit peppery.. but we love pepper!  I also marinated some diced tomatoes in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and a teaspoon of sugar for a few hours.  I then drained them and added them to salad before serving.  It was delicious!  I will definitely be making this salad again and again during the summer heat!  Thank you for sharing!  :)

I forgot the butter, had to use dried herbs instead of fresh, and it was still DELICIOUS!  I took one cook's review advice and used tsp's of pepper instead of Tbsp's -- good idea. How about cracked peppercorn melange for color, and maybe a Tbsp of balasamic in the last step for fun?

This was such a tasty recipe!  For a quick fix, I used it warm and placed steamed veggies and served with warm steak on top.  My family loved it and the kids enjoyed something different than the average pasta sauce.  I will definately be using this recipe a lot.

I omitted the parsley, and cut way back on the pepper. I also topped the pasta with some diced cherry tomatoes and a splash of white balsamic vinegar. This was very fresh tasting. Thanks!

This was just ok,it definately wasn't worth 5 stars though.The papper was just too much,if I was to make this again I'd only add 1/2 Tsp pepper instead of the 1 1/2 Tbs called for.

I tasted more pepper than anything.  It was good, but too dry to eat as a side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I assume the sauce is supposed to soak into the pasta to give it its flavor, but it's hard to eat dry like that.  I am going to try this pasta with alfredo sauce to see how it works.

If there was a way to give negative stars I probably would.  I followed the recipe (minus the extra pepper) exactly and it tasted like I was eating noodles. Noodles. That's it. No lemon flavour, no garlic, no basil. Nada.

I took the advice of others and cut way back on the pepper. Unfortunately, I didn't find this as enjoyable as I would have hoped. Sorry.

With the tsps instead of tbsps, this is great. It gets better the longer it sits, but it's still great right after making! It's great to have a recipe that allows me to still eat well on busy, busy nights.

I made this with dried spices, but otherwise followed the recipe (minus the lg amt of pepper). The kids loved it as the plainer the noodle the better.  I found it very bland.  Even parmesan didn't add much flair.  I would try some garlic salt next time instead of clove.

Was very good. I used broccoli and light butter as well as old bays to give it a little spice. Whole family loved it!

I liked that this recipe was simple and tasted fresh with the herbs and lemon, but, there were several things I would change.  I ended up adding more lemon after tasting it because the flavor diluted from the pasta water.  As other reviewers stated the pepper ratio does not appear to be correct.  2-1/2 tbsp of pepper would be pretty overwhelming.  I ended up using about 1-1/2 tsps.   I also reduced the salt amount to our taste.  I tried some warm and some cold the next day as the recipe stated.  We actually preferred the warmer pasta.  Probably would not make this again.
