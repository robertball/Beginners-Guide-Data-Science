This was a recipe my grandmother used often when I was a child.  It is SO good - one of my favorite things.  Very tickled to find it here :)

I make this too from the old Betty Crocker recipe.  However, I only use whipped cream.  You can also halve this recipe and use a 8x8 or 9x9 pan, but the prettiest way to make it is in a heart shape for Valentine's day.

This is an old original Betty Crocker recipe that is quite easy but impressive. We made it several times in high school for Valentines Day - Baked the shell in "heart shape"
