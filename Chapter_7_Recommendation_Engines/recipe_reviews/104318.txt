This was so simple and delicious!  I used light cream cheese, half garlic powder, half minced garlic and fresh chives instead of dried.  This was great spread over fresh bagels and as a dip for carrot and celery sticks - a definite keeper.

I made a half recipe of this, using reduced fat cream cheese. After tasting it, I added in more chives and garlic powder. It just needed more. We ate this for lunch spread on whole wheat bread and made into a tomato and lettuce sandwich. I love the idea. Next time, I'll add onion powder, too, I think.

I used 1 individual package of WW (weight watchers) cream cheese spread, 1/8 tsp garlic powder and 1/8 tsp dried chives.  Used instead of mayo on my turkey sandwich for lunch.  Would be great melted over pasta, on garlic bread and even over fish.  The possibilities are endless!

Very nice.  Super simple, super fast, and a good sub for those purchased flavored cream cheeses.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great simple spread. I just whipped some up with some whipped cream cheese and fresh chives that grow in our front yard and it was excellent!

I cannot believe how good this tastes given how few ingredients it has!  I made this in a pinch when a mix I had planned to use fell through.  I did add a little minced garlic as well.  My husband devoured it, as did my 5 year old!  Tip:  it's even better a day or two after preparing.

I used fresh garlic and instead of chives I used a little fresh dill. My breath was killer, but the taste was great.

What could be easier? Great basic dip for just about anything,  veggies, crackers, or bagels. It tastes really good, and yet won't break the bank.

Great stuff.  Don't be afraid to add a little more garlic if you want.  The bad breath is worth it.

I tested a really small portion of this to use for a recipe in which I needed a garlic/herb cream cheese. I thought it tasted pretty good. I didn't realize how easy it was to make good tasting flavored cream cheeses. It would be good on a bagel.

I've been making this for a while and am finally reviewing it as I was searching for another of my favorite recipes.  This is absolutely the best basic easy versatile cream cheese spread ever!  It's delicious as is - I sometimes add chopped cooked bacon.  I seriously cannot understand buying cream cheese spread when easy yummy recipes exist that will always taste better than store bought.  ..... just sayin'.....  : )

I used some fresh green onion from the garden as well as some fresh garlic in addition to garlic salt (didn't have any garlic powder).  Very tasty!  Spread it on some butter crackers and top with a slice or two of cucumber and some dried dill - so delicious!
