I tried this recipe a couple years ago with just two small changes.  I couldn't find amaretto cookies so I used a mix of crushed ginger snaps and nilla wafers instead.  I also made a rather large batch, and added a good bit more amaretto.  This is a huge favorite recipe for my family now, and Thanksgiving dinner is simply unacceptable without it.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something new.  Thankyou so much for sharing this!

The only change I made to this recipe (now, on a permanent basis) is to steam peeled, cut-up fresh yams, why settle for a tasteless canned product when you can have some flavor.  The crushed Amaretto cookies are so good and are readily available everywhere. The rest, brown sugar, amaretto liquor and butter are just added richness, try this ....you'll love it!

No one wrote that the yams needed to be drained. I discovered this after mixing. So I added more from another large can of yams.  Still, it was almost soupy. The whole "mess" tasted delicious, and I'm still eating it, but I wasn't  happy with the outcome for my club's party.  Live & learn.
