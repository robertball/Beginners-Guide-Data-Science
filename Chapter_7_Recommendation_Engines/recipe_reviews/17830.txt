This recipe is so good! It def hits any sweet tooth! The changes I made were: 2 c flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 1 c sugar and a splash of vanilla. They were perfect! I also added a few chocolate chips to the top before baking at 400 for 20 min. They were golden brown & delicious! I will def make this again.

I dont know what everyone else is doing wrong, but the comments I got when I used this recipe were, wow, baked perfectly, delicious.  If it seems to liquidy, bump the heat up a little and you may have to bake a little longer, but whats an extra 15 minutes? I think it was great.

I'm sorry, Julia, but these muffins just don't seem to work out!! I agree with past reviews: they were far too wet and took a verrry long time to bake. Too much liquid wasn't the only problem, though. They just seemed "off", even though the flavor wasn't too awful. Sorry. :(

This recipe turned out great for me. The only thing that i did differently is using different measurments. Also i think all these past reveiwers are mixing the ingredients wrong. The reason why its so wet or not a dough like texture is because your not pouring the liquids in a small well in the middle of the dry ingredients. I make muffins all the time and this was a great recipe :)

Unfortunately this keeps being too wet a dough for me. Already tried to keep it longer in the oven, didn't really work. Now I will try less fluids, but the taste is really GREAT!!!

I dont know what others are talking about. I have never had a problem with this recipe before. I baked this recipe several times and then decided i wanted to add to it. I added 1 cup of frozen raspberries as well as the chocolate chips and a splash of vanilla and they turned out amazing. I think if your recipe is too liquidy, its because you are beating the egg or stiring your muffin mix too much. Unlike a cake mix, you are supposed to fold in the ingrediants not stir them. If you stir them you end up with liquid rubbery muffins with holes in the middle of your muffins ..just a little fyi

I lovethis recipe and use it ALL the time.  I made the same adjustments as everyone else did: 2 c flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 1 c sugar and a splash of vanilla.  Typically I use this recipe to make mini muffins.  Everything is the same, even the baking time, only I use mini chips instead of full size chips.

I made it to include in a mother's day breakfast, but it just did not turn out.  Not sweet enough and not a good texture. Was a little better later after it had been refrigerated.

This recipe seems totally wrong amounts! I should have read the reviews first, because I probably would not have made it if I had. It was so liquidy, had to add heaps more flour.

I thought these were very good!  I used all measurements as originally stated, and made sure in the method that I mixed the dry and wet separately, then combined them, and found the batter was not too wet or too dry.  I baked them at 350 (convection) for 15 minutes, and they were done.  They didn't brown much on the top, but still looked and tasted great!  A new favorite in our home.

My daughter and I made this recipe, we made it because it looked simple for her, she is only 10.  I would not recommend this recipe, very rubbery, and too much butter.

Love it!  I changed/added to the recipe to a cup of mint chocolate chips, 2 teaspons of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of dark chocolate powder.  Put a dolup of canned chocolate fudge frosting on top with some chopped up mint chocolate chips.  My friend and family cannot get enough!

Add a 1/2 cup more flour to these for the perfect consistancy! In addition, I added a 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and substituted 2 Tbs of the white sugar with brown sugar. yummy!

I tried one other chocolate chip muffins recipe and it was not very good, but this one was great.  The batter was the right consistency and they tasted fantastic.  Will definately make this one again.

For me, this recipe was only enough dough for 10 muffins.  They are good but a little dry.  Baked 15 minutes at 180 C. I also added 1 full teaspoon of cocoa powder and used dark-chocolate sprinkles instead of choc. chips.  I used some brown sugar along with white and a small amount of extra flour.  I feel I'll have to seek another recipe, because I like to have 12 full muffins at the end of baking.

I'm really not sure what went wrong here - I followed the directions to the T...  I changed the Servings to 12, yet I ended up with batter for about 18.  Upon first check after 15 mins in the oven, the muffins didn't seem quite done so I let them bake at 3 min increments, checking at each interval.  At the 21 min mark, I took the muffins out.  These muffins were way over-done on the bottom, a funky "not-quite-done" color on top, and dry.  Obviously they were probably dry because of the amount of time spent in the oven, but honestly,   I found this recipe's directions kind of vague (was the egg supposed to be beaten?  I ended up beating it).   After baking this botched batch yesterday, I found another recipe (Nora's Chocolate Chip Muffins) on here which has worked out much better for me (and the muffin eaters).  Will not be attempting my hand at this recipe again.

These were perfect! Being vegan I had to make some minor adjustments. First I followed advise from previous user and increased flour to 2 cups and also increased baking powder to 1 tablespoon. I used flax egg replacer and coconut milk. I also used 1/3 cup Earth Balance buttery stick. I baked at 400 for 18 minutes which allowed muffins to puff up and crack on the top. These were perfectly moist and fluffy. I will be making again and again and again!

This recipe Tasted Fantastic, but.... The batter was liquidy, The Chocolate Chips all sank to the bottom, The liner was hard to remove, They took forever to cook, They didn't rise and lastely they never crisped at the top. I'm sorry and usually only write good reviews, but this was a bad waste of my time! ?? I don't recommend this recipe. This was really too bad! I had high hopes.

I made this recipe twice in the last few days. I love how quick and simple it is, making it an easy recipe to make for a quick grab and go "treat like" breakfast or something easy but delicious to share with co-workers. The first time I made this with butter as the recipe calls for and the second time with veggie oil. I have yet to taste the finished muffin but like the texture and smell better with the oil.

This was the first muffin recipe I have ever tried and I'm sticking to it! I'm pretty sure there is no better recipe than this. It is the perfect amount of sweetness and it is just plain YUMMY! Thank you SO MUCH for a great recipe!!!

Wonderful, not sure what the fuss is all about.  Turned out great.  The ONLY thing I changed was the cooking.  400 for about 25-30 minutes.

It was good . I just made a few changes . When I followed the recipe without changing anything , it just tasted .... Off. Not bad but just off. The second batch , I added 2 short small splashes of vanilla. The tiniest hint of cocoa. And a grain of cinnamon . I think the cinnamon really did it. That was the last thing I added and it just fixed the taste. Overall , thank you for the recipe my guests loved it!!!

These muffins were just "ok".  They were moist and very easy to make, however, they have a very flour-y taste to them, especially if you get a bite without any choc. chips in it!  If you are going to make these I would recommend using more chocolate chips than stated to make sure you have some in every bite,

This recipe turned out great for me. The changes I made were 2 cups self rising flour, 1 cup sugar, and omitting the baking powder. Quick and easy snack that hits the sweet spot!

Like others, I find this batter too thin.  Baking longer would have no effect except to dry them out.  The taste was fine, but I prefer to have chocolate chips spread throughout, and not sunk to the bottom of each muffin (they looked like "black-bottomed" cakes).  I'm sure they sank because of the thinness of the batter.  I have another plain, sweet muffin recipe I use that I add chocolate chips to, I think I'll go back to that recipe.

Ok for everyone who had trouble with this recipe...I decided to try it, but I played with it a little.  First, I upped the liquid...1/2 cup of butter. Second, I used 2/3 cups of raw sugar. Then I baked longer....way longer...the reason is that muffins need to be baked at about 400 degrees to peak and crack like muffins ought to peak. So, the next time I made them, I upped the oven temp and they did in fact bake in 15 minutes. I still increased the butter and they came out yummy and delicious both times. The key, I think, is the oven temperature!

Did anyone else notice the baking powder was missing in the instructions? The taste was good, but like the other reviews said, it was too runny.

I did as some others suggested, and made it with 2 cups of flour and a tablespoon of baking powder. I also added a mashed banana. 
They did not brown, even though I put them in for a longer time then the recipe called for. I think the muffin had a good flavor, but the chocolate overpowered everything. If I ever make this again, I will cut the chocolate in half and bake it at a higher temperature.

The recipe should be revised, if you follow the instructions of baking at 350 for 20 minutes, they aren't even close to done. Try 400 for 20 minutes as other reviews suggest. 

You shouldn't have to rely on reviews to make the recipe properly.

The flavor is fine, nothing special. I star rate this at 1 based on the idea that the instructions are incorrect with baking times and temperatures. That's the entire point of a recipe!

Great base recipe! I DID follow another reviewer's suggestions of 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar (though I only used 3/4 cup), 1 tb baking powder and some vanilla, and they turned out perfect! Not as browned on top as I would have liked, but it DID have that nice crunch that I love in muffin tops! Will definitely make again!

These muffins were pretty good.  I used chocolate chips that weren’t very sweet so sweet, in fact kind of flat tasting.  I bought them at an Amish market.  Next time I’ll use regular Store grand.

Great recipe and kid approved. I like to add a dash of cinnamon to give it an extra yummy aroma and taste as it bakes. This recipe also makes 12 regular sized muffins for me.

My giant sweet tooth was so satisfied!!, thought it wasn’t overly sweet. My only tiny complaint is that for me, all of the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom, and that made them not look chocolate chip, but that doesn’t really matter. They made twelve great muffins that were absolutely delicious!!!!! There were made for my dad’s birthday, and I will definitely be making these again!!! ??????

Its far too much chocolate. I think next time  I'm going to reduce the amount of chocolate chips by half. They all sunk to the bottom of the muffin and it was a gross mess

This recipe (with the added tweaks and adjustments that is) came out great. I followed the suggestions of adding 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar and 1 tbsp of baking powder. I also used a quarter cup of vegetable oil instead of butter. The batter was thick and rich and baked up perfectly at 350 for 18 minutes. They do tend to be a bit more pale in color but they really are fluffy and delicious.

Added about a 1/3 cup of chocolate chips more because you can never have too much chocolate. Definitely will make again, very delicious.

I didn't make any changes and I won't make this again.  It wasn't bad, but this recipe was very blah.  To be honest they were better cold in the fridge.  Kinda tasted like cookie dough.

I just made these I followed everyone's advice added more of this and less of that the end results were terrible even as I made them I knew something was wrong. So I made a new batch and added 1tsp of baking soda this help them to rise much nicer and I didn't use cup cake holders they stuck to the paper and more peeled off with the paper than the kids ate.

Very good however I found that when I made them 1 cup of chocolate chips was to much I would recommend doing 1/2 a cup  instead  however over all I thought the muffins were quite good! I would make it easily make it agin, and recommend to others.

I did not care for the texture of these muffins and thought they had too many chocolate chips causing them to fall apart upon removing from baking cups. I baked them longer than directed and they would not brown on the top at all. My granddaughter loved them so I will probably make again.

Very good.  They don't brown on top for some reason though.

I made both the chocolate chip version and for the second batch I removed the chocolate chips and instead topped and swirled in a cinnamon filling to make them cinnamon muffins.  

Both turned out great, just wish they would brown more on the top.

I made these for my niece today and they turned out pretty well. They are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, sounds like a cookie but it's muffin! They are a bit bland though. I added 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla and 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour instead of 1.5 cups white. These are good kid snacks but not great for adults. Also not healthy at all, but a good treat! This recipe made 12 regular muffins for me at 350 for 20 minutes.

If it not for the chocolate chips there wouldn't be much flavor at all. As many other comments said original recipe too runny so I also added more flour and sugar. Not terrible but not great either.

Absolutely perfect! They go very quickly every time I make them. I've never had a problem with the consistency and I made zero changes to the recipe. I do bake for the full 20 minutes and I eyeball the amount of chocolate chips, but other than that, nothing to note about the way I make them. They are definitely a family favorite!

Good recipe. I made mine in a loaf pan and used 1 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup cocoa and 1 Tbsp baking powder. Baked at 350 for roughly 40 minutes.

Great recipe, they certainly don't last long in our house!  I followed it as is, but added 1 tsp vanilla and took another's advice on making a well with the dry ingredients and folding them into the wet ingredients.  They turned out perfect!!

Update: I've also used 1 cup Whole Grain Flour, 1/2 cup All-Purpose Flour, forgotten the vanilla and added 1 cup (total) of shredded carrot and zucchini....our autistic son can't tell and loves them! Yes :-)

The taste is great but I'd sure like to know why all the chocolate chips end up in the bottom?? 3/4 of the muffin has no chocolate chips but the bottom 1/4 is a chocolate mess.

Wow! These were easy to make and taste great!!!
Did add a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to them and reduced the sugar to a 1/3 cup. It's sweet enough with the chocolate chips.
Thanks for sharing. Will absolutely make these again and again :-)

I made them but added a tsp of vanilla. My batter was wet but I figured it was because of the vanilla. Then I put them in the oven and read the reviews and saw other people had the same problem and someone suggested bumping up the heat. I quickly went and turned it up to 375 and they came out perfect.

I used some tapioca starch and a dash of cornstarch to accommodate my egg allergy, used carob chips instead of chocolate (also allergic) and added some dried cherries. I added some carob powder, and also had to add about 2/3c extra flour because the batter was extremely runny with the given proportions. 

They turned out nicely! I agree with the others who talked about them being rather pale and bland if you don't tweak the recipe a bit, but after adjustment they're good. I feel like this is a good basic recipe for people who want a jumping off point to explore their own flavor combinations.

Easiest chocolate chips muffins I have ever made. They tasted great. My daughter and mother-in-law loved them! I stuck with the recipe ingredients as written. I used a mini muffin pan and baked for 12 minutes. They came out absolutely perfect.

Overall these muffins were good. The only thing was that they had little flavor so we would recommend adding vanilla. Once the vanilla was added, they had more flavor. These muffins have a spongy texture so it depends on the person of what texture you like your muffins / cupcakes.

I would probably add an extra splash of milk, because the batter was really dry and thick . But that's really all the changes I made. They took a little bit more time to cook that it says to bake, but when they came out they were HEAVENLY! It was moist and perfect. It really hits any sweet tooth!

It came out looking ok but when you bite into it the chocolate chips are at the bottom or on the wrapping paper. The muffin was a little too doughy.

I made these exactly as the recipe says, and they turned out fine. Maybe the different results are because of different flours. The one I used was more like bread flour. The mixture wasn't any thinner than that of any other muffin.

I did not read any reviews before making this, but have to agree, it tasted not quite "right." I had some leftover batter that was more than the 12 muffins I made first, so I added some vanilla to the rest, then baked the last 4. OMG, they were delicious. My suggestion is to soften the butter, not melt it, and add 2 teaspoons vanilla to the mix, before baking.

This is my 6th time I have made this recipe. My family  always gives thumbs up! But I made some changes:
There was a little too much flour so I added more sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla! It was perfect! I also wanted to add a few more chocolate chips! (I mean, they can't hurt!)

Great, very simple recipe,  not super sweet, loved them. Be careful not to overbake, they are done before they brown any on top. For the record, I followed the recipe EXACTLY, as I NEVER give a review of a recipe without trying it exactly as written first . I feel that is unfair to the recipe submitter and just plain rude. I used the same temperature and amounts of ingredients, the only thing different was  about a tablespoon less chocolate bits bc I didn't have quite enough. I read a couple reviews that claimed the batter was too "wet" and they took too long to bake. Mine took 17 minutes. My super-uber-picky 10 year old loved them, although the little chocoholic did request extra chocolate bits next time lol! I will probably oblige (within reason) bc it's rare to get her to try something new. Oh, one more thing, it may just be the pans I used or the amount of batter used in each muffin, but I ended up with 14 total.
Update: After making the recipe I decided to write it down. Suddenly realized I didn't use enough chocolate chips after all. The recipe calls for 1 cup and I thought it said 1/2 cup and I only had a scant 1/2 cup in there lol. So the amount as written should be plenty!

I made it and I have to say I'm not good in sweets. But it turned out great. Not too sweet (cause we try to cut down on sweets a bit), not dry, not burnt, not liquid.
Fast, easy and (wait for it) no mixer or anything else used. Spoon and fork, easy!
They turned out a bit less fluffy than I wanted but I guess next time i will improve!

Instead of putting 1 cup of milk, I put 1/2 cup of whipping cream. They turned out AMAZING.

Made EXACTLY like recipe says--even with real butter, but found I had to add 1/4 cup extra flour to overly wet dough... they were still very moist.  I agree with another reviewer that the taste was "off".   She said flour-y.  I'd say the taste is like a biscuit....esp. when you get a bite without chocolate.  (it would help if you only used mini chips--I used regular ones)  My kids liked it--I'm assuming because they inhale everything and because it really has quite a bit of sugar in it--oh, and they love biscuits.  If it had less sugar, it would likely be really bland.  I had to bake them the 20min. time to get them done.  I probably would even tweek a standard muffin recipe for oatmeal/raisins (subbing choc.  chips for raisins) before I made this one again.  They weren't even pretty.....very very yellowy-pale from the butter.

Some people said this recipe was too liquid, so I made mini-muffins instead, so they would dry a little more. Also, for the liquid batter problem, I used margarine instead of butter, part of which I didn't melt, to solidify the batter a little more. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, for taste.  Of course that's just my personal preference.It honestly took me only 14 minutes of baking to cook these to perfection.  All in all, it was a pretty good recipe. I will cook it again.

These are very dense and did not take a muffin form at all. Definitely not my favorite recipe. They do taste good, but I will not make this recipe again.

This recipe is simple and perfect! I didn't read all the reviews but it seems a couple people said there was too much liquid. I followed the recipe with two exceptions. I  added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and I didn't melt the butter. I added the butter to the mixer at room temperature. Could solve peoples "liquid" issues. They were perfect. I baked at 350 for 12 minutes and then 250 for 7 minutes.  So much less expensive than 20 mini hostess muffins with a whole lot of preservatives for $4.99 a box. Gotta love home-made! Thank you Julia!

If you want an excuse to eat chocolate chips without feeling guilty, than this is the muffin recipe for you. If you want your muffins to taste like more than just a chocolate chip holder, look elsewhere.

I took the other bakers suggestions and upped the flour to 2 cups the sugar to 1 cup and the baking powder to 1 TBS. Mine look great and took the suggested 20 minutes to cook. Even though they were cooked  I still found them very white on top so I shut off my oven and left them for another few minutes

I think I might have used a slightly different recipe from this site, but anyway the muffins taste good the top was a little dark at its shortest time, so next time I'd put them in for 15-20 minutes. And I might have added a little too much of regular sugar, I saw that it said to put it in twice so I wouldn't put that extra 3 tablespoons. But over all they were pretty good, especially since I'm only 13 lol.

Good. I tried to make them more healthy by reducing the sugar and using sucanat instead of white sugar. I also used whole grain flour.They were really good and not to sweet.

This recipe was okay. I doubled it to make 24 muffins, and this worked fine, but if I try it again I will do less chocolate chips. All the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the muffins and were much too concentrated for my tastes. The dough worked out fine for me, and would work well with blueberries too.

Not very flavourful, needs more sugar. On the bright side it bakes beautifully, could be a good base recipe to play with different ingredients!

I made these this morning. They did turn out great. The texture of the mixture turned out a little wet for me as well. Increased the cooking time by about 5 minutes. 20 minutes wasn't long enough as the middle was still very wet and uncooked. Made a little change and added 1 TB spoon of cocoa powder for more sweetness.

These muffins took 25 minutes at 350 in my oven. They look a little pale but are nice, simple, moist muffins. They are not too sweet which is great. I used buttermilk in place of milk since I had it in the fridge. I would try these again and maybe give them a few more minutes but they will soon all be gone anyway!

The batter was thin and runny, so we added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. After baking for about 22 min., the muffins were still white and looked undercooked, but were actually ready. They have a satisfying taste, but are not as sweet as other chocolate chip muffins.

Unlike other reviewers, I only had to bake these for five extra minutes and they came out perfect! They taste great and even my husband, who is very particular about his sweets, was raving about how good they are. I loved how easy and quick they were to make! My only complaint is that I did not have enough batter to make 12 standard size muffins so I ended up with 10 instead. Otherwise I would have given this recipe 5 stars.

I'm sorry this is the first time that I have to say I'm not too fond of a recipe on here. I did as a previous poster suggested and added a little more flour, sugar and vanilla but I agree... Missing something , just doesn't taste right. The kids liked them and had fun making them but I wouldn't use this recipe again :(

this recipe was delicious. My entire family loved it. Added some white chocolate chips as well as a pinch of nutmed and a splash of vinailla. cut the sugar in half. they came out perfect golden brown and moist.  Baked only half the batter and added grated carrots to the other half. Still waiting to take it out the oven. Thank you will be keeping this one.

Very easy and delicious. My four kids and husband loved them.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe. I think any bad result from other reviews was a result from not following the recipe. : )

This recipe is what it promises to be:  a basic muffin with chocolate chips.  I would suggest a couple of things, particular if you've never baked muffins:  1.  Never overmix muffin batter.  Rule of thumb is, mix dry ingredients separately from the wet ingredients and when you combine them, stir (by hand) only as many strokes as it takes to wet the ingredients.  2.  I've learned to melt American butter on the stovetop, not the microwave.  It contains more moisture than, for example, European butter, and melting it on the stove helps some of the moisture to be released.  Of course, it's important to let the butter cool before adding to the wet ingredients, or you'll cook your eggs.  3.  More of a thought, really:  I wish writers of baking recipes would include where they are located in regard to sea level.  It does make a difference.

Doubled the recipe, lowered the temp by 25 degrees because our gas oven can be a bit weird when it comes to baking and they took maybe and extra 5 minutes to bake perfectly. Not a single issue, kids loved them. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

I can't make muffins to save my life, but these were amazing!!!! Light, fluffy, and sweet, I topped them with some salted almonds for a little different touch :)

These turned out really well!  I baked it as a loaf of bread at the same temperature, same amount of minutes, instead of as muffins.  I added an extra teaspoon of baking powder and used 1/4 c milk and 3/4 c coffee instead of 1 c milk.  It rose very well and cooked all the way through without being burnt on the outside.  I will definitely make this again.

Quick, easy and delicious! However, after making these muffins a few times, here are some tips that address some of the other reviewers concerns:
~ Use 1 cup evaporated milk instead of fresh milk. It makes the batter thicker and the chocolate chips don't sink to the bottom.
~ Use a whole bag of chocolate chips, which is usually around 1.5 to 2 cups.
These two changes have made these muffins a weekly must in my house!

This recipe was great!! I didn't change a thing, other reviews about it not working out right must have been operator error. This was great and delicious and that is coming from someone who is disastrous at baking most the time. Yummy!

I made these today with a group of 30 children ranging in age from 6 -12. They are super easy, they turned out well and the children loved them.

Ok, i try to bake it and taste it. It is actually quite delicious but i wonder whether the flour is too much? A bit sticky. However, i m only a beginner when it comes to baking. I am very happy with the result. And my little daughter loves it too.
