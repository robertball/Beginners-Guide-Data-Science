eh. it's allright.  it was very easy to make, the taste is good, but nothing special.  If you wanted to make a rice pie for easter, this is a good recipe, but I wouldnt go out of my way to make it. I mostly just wanted to use up my instant rice - mission accomplished.

I made this pie with some leftover white rice I got from Chinese take out.  It turned out really good!  I didn't have vanilla, so i used almond instead, which turned out to be a nice touch.  I would definitly make this whenever I need to get rid of some left over rice!

It is pretty sweet, next time I make it will only use 1/2 the sugar.
