Pretty goo! I made a "gyros" sauce to go with it, too -- if you really like the "gyros thing" -- I suggest making this to go with it: Mix some plain yougart, light sour cream, fresh mint, garlic salt, chopped cucumber, scallions, and tomato together. Put this over your burger. Voila! Pretty good, if I do say so myself. :)

Very, very good.  The spice combination is spectacular. I put the mixture into my food processor to get a firmer texture.  I then shaped into a very thin loaf and broiled in the oven.  Slice very thinly and serve with pita, fried in olive oil, greek olives, roasted garlic and tzatziki sauce. Great appetizer.

these were very good.  I used 1.30 # ground sirloin only.  Did not have the savory.  Added 1/2 tsp. dried oregano as other reviewers suggested (thank you) and fresh chopped parsley to the mix.  Left out the bread crumbs because didn't use lamb which adds more liquid (oil) to the mix.  Was afraid they would be too dry using ground sirloin only.  They were not at all dry.  Mixed it up this afternoon and let it set for a few hours for the flavors to blend.  Tasted much like gyro meat.  Served in warmed onion pitas w/red onion slices, diced fresh tomatoes, and tziziki sauce.  Thanks LatinaCook for the photo submission, as well.

What sort of Greek restaurants are people eating at if they think this is even remotely authentic OR taste like gyros.  I've NEVER had problems with 5-star recipes.  If our family disagrees about it being 5-stars... it still turned out to be a decent dish (just not our thing).  Please consider a different Gyro recipe.  I'll report back when I've discovered a better one, but this doesn't taste like gyros at all esp. if you're spoiled and have a good restaurant near you.  I'm VERY easy to please, and my husband... not so much.  Either way, we both didn't want to eat this.  Followed the recipe exactly and even included the sauce people recommended.  FWIW, the sauce tastes better w/o blending it.  Blending it makes it too thin.

Very, very good. Meat tasted just like traditional gyro meat, it just didn't look like it. Will definitely make again. Made this with the Tzatziki Sauce I recipe (plus cucumber).

Pretty good. I couldn't find savory anywhere though. I grilled the patties on my foreman grill and i cut them in 4-5 slices each before putting them in the pita bread. (I used the tzatziki I sauce from this site and added 1/2 cucumber to it for a more authentic flavor).

Outstanding! I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used all beef and pressed some onion into the meat mixture. I also cut the patties as suggested by a previous reviewer, and served on flatbread with red onion, tomato, lettuce, and tzatziki. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

OMG, wow!!  I grew up in a greek neighborhood so I know what an authentic gyro tastes like.  I was missing gyros since i moved away from the old neighborhood and came across this recipe.  I mixed the meat and everything else together until well blended and instead of cooking it the way the directions told you i took a reviewers advice and shaped the meat into a loaf and baked it in the oven for about an hour.  I let it cool completely and sliced it thin and served it in a pita with tzatziki sauce, tomatoes and red onion.  This was fantastic!!  Will definately make this again.

I will give this 5 stars since it is the best recipe I have come across and my family loved it! It was also easy. I however thought it needed something... not sure what, to make it taste like the ones from a restaurant. I will try again and experiment with this one.
thx!

We made a few changes to adapt the recipe to what we had on hand but the concept was fantastic. My husband made the Gyros and said it is a keeper.
It was fast and easy to make.

The whole family really loves this recipe.  It has nice flavor and is a nice change of pace from your basic burger.  Next time I make it though I think I will mix the spices into the meat and refrigerate for a couple of hours to let the flavors go through the meat better.  I used only ground beef as we did not have lamb available and we loved them served with the suggested pitas and toppings and tazitki sauce.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

My kids loved this so much that they were asking for a repeat within the same week! The second time we made this I doubled the batch and made meatball/slider sized portions and froze for a quick and easy meal.

Excellent flavor to the meat (I did increase the coriander and did not have any savory). The meat was formed into mini sausage shapes and baked in the oven at 400 for 12 minutes.  After cooling a bit, they were cut lengthwise in half and put into pitas along with tzatziki sauce, red onion, tomato, cucumber, and lettuce.  Totally terrific!!!

I made a LOAF of this meat blend and inserted the rod to my VERTICAL ROTISSERIE through it, then froze the gyros loaf solid. The next day, Placed the loaf on the rotisserie, and let it cook. Prepped the flat bread, the sauce, crumbled feta cheese, sliced my onions and olives. An hour later, the gyros loaf was done, and we sliced it right off the spit, onto our bread....and let me tell you, the whole family was thrilled. It tasted EXACTLY like the gyros we had been paying 7.50ea for at our local Greek eatery.  Thank you from all of us...

I think the photo and title are a bit misleading -- when you flatten the patties to 1/8-1/4 inch thin, you definitely don't get a burger experience (which is a good thing!). This was so good, but I would add a bit more of all the spices to get the "gyro" flavor. Also, grilling can make it a bit dry, but not sure how to avoid that -- I loved it anyway. Added thinly sliced dill pickles, tomatoes and lettuce with homemade tzatziki sauce from this site.

These were awesome!! They actually tasted like Gyros. I completely forgot to put the grated onion in and did not have savory so I substituted Thyme but it was still delicious. I served them in pita pockets with lettuce, tomato, feta and tzatziki. I will definitly be making these again!

I didn't want to make burgers, wanted more traditional Gyros so I used this recipe but the method from "Traditional Gyro Meat" to prepare the meat.It was really really yummy!!!Great blend of spices!!I just used about  1/8-1/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of toasting bread and making them.

These are fantastic. After grilling, cut the patties into strips before putting into the pita... yummy! Use the Tzatziki Sauce I recipe from this site for topping.

Thespices and combination of lamb and beef made these taste almost like our Greek Community Tarpon Spring's finest.  Making them thin is also good advice.  I used a Tzatziki sauce found at this site too and served Roditis dry rose (also Greek). It was great!  Thanks for saving me a trip to Tarpon Springs.

These were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of not including coriander and allspice, and the flavors were still wonderful. Would make again.

These burgers have very good flavor.  The only change I made was to use bread crumbs instead of a slice of bread.  I mixed everything together in the morning and let the spices blend with the meat until I cooked the burgers for dinner.  I made Peppy's pita bread and cucumber yogurt sauce (both from this site) to complete the gyros.  Will definitely make again.

I have been wanting to make gyros for some time now. When I came upon this recipe it was simple and easy to do and they turned out very flavorful. After I grilled them I cut them in to 6 pieces and then stuffed it into the pita bread and topped with tzatziki sauce and it was very easy to eat.

These are really good!  I would have loved to make them with lamb, but it is not readily available where we live so I used only beef...I actually used ground beef with only 4% fat and eliminated the bread crumbs.  Since I made it into a loaf, baked it, and then sliced it, I did not have any problems with it drying out.
The flavor is really great.

Great recipe!  Thank You!!  The changes I made were out of necessity for lack of ingredience: I used all lamb; instead of savory I used oregano; instead of allspice is used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnimon.  My family loved the taste.  Also I made my own yogurt sauce (tsatziki) I have from a greek recipe book.

I added an egg to the recipe.  My family loved this meal.  We love to try new things and this was a simple twist on an everyday meal.  We'll make this again and again!

Maybe it's because I didn't have ground Lamb on hand, but I tried this with ground beef and these just didn't stick together.  Fell apart & had to fudge them into the pitas... only to be absolutely, sadly disappointed as we were all anticipating a wonderful meal. This one's not going into my recipe box, sorry.

I made this last night for dinner and my husband and I both loved it. I made the burgers oblong to fit on the pita and served it with tzatziki, red onion, tomato and cucumber.  I also made a side of Greek Potato Salad and the two complemented each other very well.  I will be making this again!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

These Gyro burgers are truly wonderful.  I used breadcumbs instead of actual bread...but that's really all I did differently.  They taste so much like Gyros that whatever craving you have for gryos will be totally satisfied.  You can use all ground beef if you like instead of half lamb and half beef.  They are juicy flavorful and the spices are spot on!  I cannot say enough about these.  They hit the spot.  Yummy yummy.

These were very easy to prepare.  The only thing I did different was to use a whole lb of lamb with 1/2 lb of beef.  My daughter who doesn't even eat burgers ate the entire sandwich.  great with the yogurt cucumber sauce and a piece of romaine lettuce.

This recipe was OK.  We didn't feel that they tasted much like gyros at all.  With that being said, we still enjoyed them.  I probably will not make again unless I were to do some tweeking.

These are fabulous!  I've made these several times already, but forgot to review. I always made these using all beef, no lamb because we don't eat it, and they are super delicious! This time I took a chance and tried to make these vegetarian, and had wonderful results. I changed the recipe to 7 servings, because I had two  14 ounce packages of Gimme Lean brand vegetarian "ground beef". I followed the recipe as written otherwise, but instead of grilling (it was raining), I added 1 Tablespoon of olive oil in a non-stick skillet and pan fryed these about 12 minutes, turning several times. These tasted just as good as using ground beef, although I will make these again with beef. I served these on warmed naan bread instead of pitas this time also. We do enjoy having this with the pitas too. Topped with romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion and Tzatziki sauce II from the site. We really love these, and make them often. Thank you for sharing this! :)

This was really good, but needed A LOT more of the spices.  I think I doubled (I quit measuring) all of the dry spice except the salt..and may have added even more than that by the time it was over.  I also added oregano (about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp) and an extra clove of garlic as many suggested and I'm glad I did.  The only thing that may throw you if you're looking for a true "gyro" is the texture, which obviously won't be the same.  Otherwise, the taste is really good...but I do suggest you SPICE IT UP!!

I made my own ground lamb using my KitchenAid - since I didn't have any beef or ground beef on hand, I used all lamb.  Ground the lamb with some fresh parsley and onion.  I didn't measure the spices out, but sprinkled the meat liberally with the spices (omitted the savory because I don't have any).  I used 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  Used the KitchenAid to mix the meat.  I made long thin "patties" and grilled them.  Served with homemade Tzatziki sauce, warm pita bread, tomatoes, onion, and feta cheese.  Tasty!

Oh my god, these were so, so good.  I used herbed flatbread instead of pitas, and made the Tzatziki II from this website to slather the burgers with.  Top with a little tomato and feta and make some rice pilaf on the side - you'll have the perfect meal!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I was in a hurry and had to get off to a softball game, so I mixed them before we left and that allowed the flavors to blend.  I didn't have dried savory, so I used some parsley and oregano this time and they were fine.  Next time I would like to have the savory to compare the flavor.  I served it with Tzatziki sauce and sliced tomato.  My family wants to know when we will have them again.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed these! Keep in mind that they are called gyro "burgers" so don't expect exactly what you would find in a Greek restaurant! They have that gyro taste but the texture of a burger. I served mine in a pita with tzatziki, lettuce and tomatoes. They were really tasty and fun!

This recipe pleasantly surprised me; really simple to make and really flavorful. My one suggestion would be to actually blend the onion and garlic before adding it to the meat to make it smoother. I definitely made my burgers way too thick this time, so making sure they are thin is also a plus. I served this with homemade tzatziki sauce (made using the tzatziki sauce I recipe here), in a pita with lettuce and onions and it tasted 100% like a gyro, but way more filling. Super tasty. Next time, I'm looking forward to taking some reviewers advice and blending the meat, baking it like a meatloaf, and then slicing it thinly. My mouth's watering just thinking of it!

This was great! We had them on onion buns with tzatziki sauce and feta (i added homegrown tomatoes and basil, yum!).  I used oregano rather than savory.  I made the mistake of chopping rather than grating the onions - it made it difficult to incorporate the onions into the hamburgers. I won't do that next time! Also, a garlic press would've helped too.

Really enjoyed this quick, easy recipe.  Best of all, my husband and son liked as well.  Will make again.  The cuke-yogurt-sour cream sauce that a reviewer mentioned was super with this recipe.

We really enjoyed these. We couldn't find lamb at our store, so we just used 100% beef, and it was still very tasty. Nice combination of spices, and they were juicy and flavorful. We'll make these again.

these were incredibly good.  i didnt have any savory so i just looked up a substitute and used thyme in its place.  1/4 teaspoon of that instead of 1/2 of savory.  added about 1/4 tsp of oregano, cooked them on the foreman grill, served on warmed pita bread with some tzatziki sauce.  i had to fight myself to not eat both my burgers tonight.  i wanted to save one for lunch tomorrow so i can enjoy it twice.  these are definitely a keeper.. dont taste exactly like a gyro but close enough for me!

OK, this ROCKED!  I would decrease the onions, but ONLY because I have non-onion lovers in my house.  OTHERWISE--- TOTALLY TASTES LIKE GYROS!  The thinner you make the patties, the better the texture resembles gyros!  Thanks for the recipe.   I used the cucumber sauce from this site as well.

We could not get enough of these burgers...I used all lamb rather than a mix of lamb and beef, and the burgers held together perfectly and were incredibly moist.  The star ingredient was the allspice...you could taste it in every bite, but it was still subtle.  Served on a huge pita with tzaziki sauce,diced tomatoes, and a lentil/rice salad on the side. We will definitely be making these again, possibly as little appetizer 'sliders' or topping for pizza.

I made this with all lamb meat, and I think it was a bit too lamb-y. I also made some tzatsiki and hummus on the side (I'm lying, my sandwich was swimming in tzatsiki) sliced some tomatoes and lettuce, and even a  bit of sliced onions covered in sumac. And they were delicious. Oh, and I used a George Foreman grill and shaped the patties like long ovals so they reached more parts of the pita. I'm sure they are great over the open fire, but I was being lazy. Great recipe, plus is caused me to buy some seasonings I never thought to use before (Savory? Thank goodness for Mccormick). Definitely worth the effort, I'd say. I made 5 patties, we ate three one night, and ate the leftovers the next night, still were not sick of the flavor. That was Tuesday and Wednesday, and here I am Thursday, already craving another one!

This was very good!  I did use half beef and half lamb, but honestly, I may add just a little more of the seasoning, the normal Greek Gyros have a little more punch.  But this recipe is Great!  Will for sure use again! Also, like others say, do make some tzatziki sauce for it!
Yum!

holy WOW, these were good! we made them using all ground turkey (no beef or lamb on hand), so i was worried they might lack flavor, but not at all! we followed the rest of the directions to a T and they were absolutely deliciously AWESOME!  plus, they were lighter and healthier using the ground turkey :)  we served them with tzatziki sauce I (added cukes) and it was GREAT.  thanks!

These burgers were fabulous!  I did add a little oregano per another review, and we served them with the Tztziki VII sauce.  Splendid change from the usual burger and it smelled and tasted just like a gyro!

Used ground turkey instead of the beef and lamb and tortilla crumbs for the bread (which made it wheat free/gluten free).  Wonderful flavor!  I ground the coriander seeds myself using a mortar and pestle--the aroma and added punch is great!

This was great! I used all ground beef, since some in my family do not like lamb, and so I used a bit less bread crumb as well so it would not dry out. Otherwise, I did everything else as written. SO GOOD! Thanks!

I could not find any savory at the store, but otherwise made this per the recipe.  It tasted okay, but very bland.  I would have expected much more flavor, definitely more garlic to be like a gyro.

this was so tasty!  the only thing i would have done differently was to add a little more salt.. i used ground turkey b/c that's what i had.. maybe if i used the ground beef and lamb it wouldn't have needed more salt (idk) i added 1/2 tsp oregano as TUNISIANSWIFE did.. served this in a pita with Good for You Greek Salad (on this site) on top.. ty for the recipe

I could not bring myself to add the allspice, as I was trying to think of something on my own, I remembered, I had looked up recipes for Gyros before & I had bought Fenugreek specifically for making these. I only used Lamb, added everything to the food processor, left out the bread crumbs and allspice but added about 2T Fenugreek and some Greek seasoning, molded them into strips and grilled them in a pan on the stove. They came out pretty good considering I just ate them with lettuce, sour cream and salt to save me a trip to the store. Hope this helps, I remember reading Fenugreek is a must.

We love this recipe (family of 5, including 8, 10, and 12 yr old).  I substitute equal parts thyme/marjoram/sage for the savory and  equal parts cinnamon/nutmeg for the allspice.  I've also made it three ways, as burgers, as meatloaf (sliced), and "taco style".  I think our favorite is taco style (stove top browned), because then we just spoon it into pitas.  However, meatloaf style allows me to set my oven timer and walk away.  

We serve it on pitas with a gyro sauce, tomatoes, and lettuce.  Feta too if I remember it.

I agree with some others that the flavor is okay. We followed recipe exactly EXCEPT we didn't have savory. Not sure if that would make a HUGE difference but none of the grocery stores around here had it. I am sure the local Amish store will have some. I think that it would be better too if the spices were doubled? Bought some more expensive pitas (in the bakery section) along with a tzatziki sauce recipe on here called Molly's Mouthwatering Tzatziki Cucumber Sauce.

I think I'll look for other recipes. Maybe cook as a meatloaf and slice thinly?  Meat was dry and only tasted similiar to a Gyro after topping with cucumber sauce, onion and tomato.  I'll stick to an authentic Gyro from a restaurant when I get the craving for now.

Different but very good.  I added oregano and parsley as mentioned by a few other members.
If you are tired of ground beef and looking for something different this is for you.

These are really good! Made them as is and once with just ground beef. We liked them both way. I went to a local Greek restaurant and picked up fresh pita's and tzatziki sauce (next time I'll make my own sauce) We shaped the burgers into more of a sausage shape to accommodate the pita's. These were really great. A friend suggested using turkey next time just to see if it livens up the same old turkey burger.

We did not add the breadcrumbs, because we were making a burger not a meatloaf. We also added mint to the ground meat and it was very good!  :D  We plan to make this again very soon.

Didn't have savory and didn't miss it. Added 1/3 Cup panko bread crumbs and feta cheese. Then grilled over the charcoal.  These are amazing.

Even with draining the meat as much as possible, this was a fattening dish (even when the ground beef portion is Laura's Lean brand!)... and the lamb taste is very strong.  I ate the one serving I plated for myself, but discarded the rest.  I will not make again.

We made this with my Mom and we just made the meat like taco meat, but in patty form.  It was wonderful and the kids couldn't get enough.  We bought fresh pita bread from a Middle eastern place ran home and made this.  AWESOME!!

I followed the recipe except that I didnt put the meat mixture in the food processor before putting into a loaf pan. For some reason, the meat was super greasy and fell apart when slicing. Maybe next time I will just make thin patties and throw them on my george. Other than that, with adding tazikiki sauce and onion, it was fabulous! Will make again

This recipe was just what we needed for our gyro fix! I used oregano in place of the savory. I made the Magpie's Cucumber Sauce on this site for the tzatziki. Also served on warmed no pocket pita bread and served w/ lettuce, tomato and onion! YUMMERS!

Mu husband wanted to have Greek night and this was the closest to lamb gyros I could find on this site. Followed the recipe exact (well, used 2/3c panko breadcrumbs in place of toast).    We crumbled the burgers and stuffed into pita with tzatziki sauce from the Joy of Cooking.  Made an orzo salad using the dressing "absolutely Fabulous Greek House Dressing" from this site. Hubby gave it all 4 stars.

Very yummy. I couldn't find ground lamb so I used ground turkey as a substitute. I put the avocado tzatzki sauce (recipe on this site)on top with pita bread.I cut the meat in slivers to make it easier to wrap pita around and eat. Has a good gyro flavor that I always wondered how to create. My hubby is looking forward to trying it when he gets home from Iraq.

I didn't have coriander or savory so I added 1 tsp. of Greek seasoning and these were AMAZING!  I made the garlic feta dip and tzatziki sauce from this site as well to go along with the gyro burgers and served with extra feta, lettuce and tomato.  These taste like authentic gyros with the added greek seasoning and have become a new favorite at our house.

This was REALLY good!  The next time I make this I will not use as lean of turkey (instead of the lamb).  It was just a little dry, so it needs a little more fat in there.  Other than that, shockingly good!!!

These were pretty good, but came out fairly dry. I recommend adding some plain yogurt to the meat mixture for added moisture.

This recipe is a keeper. I made it into a flat square meatloaf, baked it in the oven and sliced it thin. Then put the slices on a pocketless pita with tomato, onion and homemade tzatziki. Don't forget the Greek salad on the side!!

We LOVE gyros, and this recipe is incredibly similar.  We make the burgers as stated in the recipe, and serve with tomatos, onions, lettuce, ranch-cucumber salad dressing, as well as feta.  Wonderful!

Omitted savory because I didn't have any. Made long skinny thin patties instead of burger patties. Used much less onion and commercial dry bread crumbs. Grilled them and served on grilled naan bread. VERY GOOD!!!

If i were to rate this on the taste of the meat alone, this may have to be a 3 MAYBE 4... HOWEVER I could not find ground lamb anywhere so i ended up using 1/2 ground beef(sirloin)and 1/2 ground chicken breast so because of that I bumped it up a notch to a 4. I thought the burgers were pretty bland. EVERY spice/seasoning recipe called for went into the ground meat but still did not get much flavor. Dont get me wrong, after the burgers were put together on a greek pita with lettuce, thinly sliced tomato and onion, with a drizzle of Tzatziki sauce, it was great! I will keep my eyes open for ground lamb and will make these again. I will double all the spices next time. These are more like Greek Burgers and nothing like Gyros at all. Overall it was good, potential to be great.

You will not believe how well this recipe went over on a group of MEN! I didn't have any lamb to use, and used ground turkey instead and they still loved it! I love eating them out of the pita bread too! I am always looking for a new and interesting burger recipe to cook out with in the summer and this definitely does that!

Made these last night after searching for a recipe for gyros about a month.
They were good, but my husband said they were Great! He is enjoying everything I cook from this recipe site.  I used a mixture of ground turkey breast and dark meat.  Rolled them in to little cigars and then put that in between plastic wrap and patted them into thin strips. I also fried them on the stove in non stick cookware.  Used the sauce that called for no cukes but 3 cloves of garlic my husband liked this better then the sauce that called for a cucumber.

AMAZING TASTE! AUTHENTIC!!! 
I shredded the onions so the meat would form better patties, and I also shaped them to fit in Pita Pocket Bread.

Yum!  Great gyro flavor.  I added 1/2 tsp Penzey's Greek Seasoning.  I made the patties oblong shaped and served them in warm flat bread with tzatziki sauce from this site, with diced onions and lettuce.  Everyone loved them!

Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  We LOVED these!  I used 1 lb. lamb and .5 beef (couldn't find lamb in a smaller pack) and omitted the savory because it was nowhere to be found!  But still so very good.  Next time a bit more salt, probably.  We had them on pitas with tzatziki, onions and tomatoes.  The texture was (obviously) burger v. true gyro meat, but the taste was spot on.  Thanks for sharing!

The mixture was a little gooey, so I made gyro meat loaf instead.  It was great!!!  I did double the ingredients, and I didn't have savory, but i can't imagine it being better!!  Make the sauce- its worth it.  Bake for 50 minutes in a loaf pan at 350 F.  Pour off any liquid/grease.

This recipe was a refreshing twist to the "same old" burger.  The flavors were great and it cooked up perfectly on the grill.
Also, this recipe was very easy to prepare, so even the cooking rookies can make this with ease.
I personally left out the savory, but next time I won't.
Thank you.

These were fantastic!  I had to use all beef, since that was all I had, and they still came out great.  MY husband said that he would like to see me use lamb next time to give it more of the authentic taste. To top it off, I used the recipe for tzatziki sauce also from this site.

These had very good flavor. Not quite the texture I was hoping for like we get at the greek restaurant. I didn't have a food processor or meat grinder, so all mixed by hand, maybe I should have mixed longer? I may try again as they were flavorful and very close to what I was looking for.

Thought it was very good! I did not care for the allspice. I also used my jerky gun created strips and fried them. Added a little greek seasoning I buy through Penzeys Spices.

Excellent flavor!  I also was not able to get ground lamb from the store the day I went.  I substituted turkey for the lamb.  It was easy to make them low fat. The texture was wonderful, as well as the flavor.  Definitely use the link to make the sauce for it.

I wasn't expecting it to taste exactly like gyro meat, but it does a pretty good imitation for a burger.  We ground our own lamb from shoulder chops with the grinder attachment of the Kitchen Aid machine. This allowed us to trim as much fat as possible.

These were absolutely delicious.  I was not able to find ground lamb, usually it's more available in my area around the holidays, so I just used ground beef and doubled the recipe to make 8 patties.  The seasonings were good, I was skeptical of the cumin but this was very similar to what I get at our local greek restaurant.  I served mine with fresh flatbread from the local middle eastern bakery, tzatziki and a rice pilaf salad.  What a nice switch from summer hamburgers and hotdogs.

Came out very well.  I substituted grated lemon rind for the coriander (could have sworn I had some) and left out the garlic for a friend who doesn't like it.  I got my garlic fix from tzatiki sauce.

Delicious!!  My only changes were to use all beef, and I added 1 egg and a little olive oil to the mixture--loved the different spices!!  Thanks for this recipe, it's definately a keeper!

This was okay - to me it seemed better suited as an appetizer than a meal. As another reviewer suggested, I formed 4 thin, square shaped patties and broiled in the oven for 8 minutes.  I then sliced the patties into thin strips, to better fit into the pitas.

This is a nice change from typical hamburgers.  I've never tried using this combination of spices, but it's very tasty.  We used only ground beef and it worked well.  One of my kids loved this recipe, and the other only tolerated it, so it might not work for families with picky kids.

Wonderful.  Just what I was looking for!  Instead of grilling (which I'm sure would have made them taste even better) I cooked the patties on the stovetop. After cooking, I cut them into strips so they'd fit in the pita better.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I I didn't make the burgers because I wanted to make traditional gyros and needed a recipe for the meat. I left out the ground beef and replaced it with more ground lamb. I shaped the meat like a short meatloaf and sliced it about 1/8 thick and it turned out well. Good flavor.

I did not have lamb or savory, but even in the absence of those things, I feel like the balance of spices was a little off. Too much allspice IMO. didn't really remind me of gyro meat much at all. It is a decent start, but I think it will take a decent amount of tweaking to get the flavor profile right. It was just okay. With the fresh pitas I made (also from this site), chopped pickles and tomato, and tzaziki, it was decent. But I simply didn't have the same happy flavor explosion that I get with a gyro.

Instead of putting the seasonings on the burger, I mixed up the seasonings first and then added the garlic and onion. Next, I added bread crumbs and 1/4 cup feta cheese and added it to the mixture. In another bowl, I mixed the hamburger and lamb first and then combined it with the bread crumb/seasoning mixture. After the burgers were grilled, they were topped with a dollop of low-fat greek yogurt. followed by chopped grape tomatoes and a few slices of cucumber on top to give it more of a gyro feel. It was awesome!

This is a fantastic recipe. Even my picky 8 year old loved them. I replaced  savory with oregano, and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. Everything else was per recipe. Made a tzatziki sauce that really set these off. This one goes into the rotation for sure. Next time will make one thin large patty, cut it into thin slices, and throw it all into a pita! Thanks for the delicious recipe.

We loved it!  Faster and tastier than we thought it would be.  He used his hands to blend the diced onion, beef, and lamb, while I measured the spices.  We didn't have bread on hand, so we used egg as a binder.  Doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers.  Used 5 mini loaf containers (alum foil)  at 350 for 35 minutes.  Next time, we'll try the mini loaves at 300 for 45 minutes.  Had some green peas simmered in avocado oil, onion, and garlic on the side.  I added a dollop of hummus on the side of the plate.  (Didn't have taziki sauce available.)  The meal went great with a dark read wine blend.  Turned an ordinary Wednesday night into a celebration.

We loved this burger a lot. My kids and hubby devoured theirs (hubby had seconds ,as did I). If you aren't a fan of lamb ,ground lamb might not be for you.

I rarely give 5 stars for a recipe on here with no changes at all. These were so delicious! I made them exactly as written. For the T-sauce I was lazy. I know most sauces have cucumber and dill or mint in them. I simply mixed enough lemon juice with some Greek yogurt until it was a loose paste consistency and then added salt/pepper to taste and a couple teaspoons of pre minced garlic. My family was so bummed there wasn't more.

So easy and tastes great. Don't leave out the lamb. It is worth finding at the store (not always easy). Mixture freezes well too.

This is not your traditional Greek gyro but reminds me of a Lebanese dish at a restaurant I used to work at. It contained the same ingredients but was made like a "pizza". The seasonings and meat were placed inside of a pita and then baked with a touch of olive oil on top.  After removing from the oven, it was sliced into wedges just like a pizza.  Everything else was served on the side.

EXCELLENT!!! 5 STAR RECIPE!! Made as written but added chopped Italian flat leaf parsley to the meat mixture for nutritional & color purposes....my husband loved it and he is ever so picky!  After it was cooked I stuffed it in a pita with chopped tomatoes, cucumber & red onion and dolloped with Greek yogurt that I strained (7 oz) and added 1 chopped garlic clove 1/4 cup olive  oil &  2 tbsp white distilled vinegar this mixture was made early in the day so it could sit & the flavors could enhance. Yummy, healthy and not hard to prepare since most is done ahead of time.

This is the second time I have made this for my family and we love this recipe!  First time I followed the recipe to the letter and it was great!  This time I used ground lamb and sausage instead of ground beef and the result was outstanding!!  We used greek style pita bread and I added creamy cucumber sauce and I only wished I would have doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers!

Wow, this is not exactly gyro meat but Holy Cow it is great! I made it just as written except after I toasted the bread I put it in the food processor because I did not want chunks of bread. I made some tzatziki sauce, chopped some onions, tomato and lettuce and served them in pita pockets. Amazing!

These were very good. As much as I like standard burgers, this was a very refreshing revamp of the American classic. The spices worked perfectly, and while it didn't taste exactly like a gyro (not that I thought it would), every bite had just the right hint of Greek flavor.

These are fantastic.  My grill ran out of gas so I ended up baking them but they were still really good that way.  When they were done I sliced them in half lengthwise so they would accommodate a pita, added red onion, lettuce, tomato, and tzatziki and nomnomnom!  Thanks!

The seasoning on the meat is amazing!  Instead of making burgers, I cooked the ground meat and put it inside pita bread.  Delicious.

I made this with ground turkey and had to pan fry them in olive oil since the grill was out of gas.  Also was out of coriander.  Was worried how it would taste without it- but we really liked them even without this ingredient.  I'll have to pick some up at the store for next time.  I used bread crumbs too and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours when mixed together.   Served on warmed, wheat pita with the greek sauce (however it's spelled), tomatoes, red onions, and iceberg lettuce.  With greek green beans from this site- it made a nice meal.

Absolutely delicious!  All the spices really made these burgers taste like a Gyro sandwich. Very Good!

LOVED these! I doubled the recipe since I had one lb. of lamb, and one lb. of ground beef. It actually made 12 burgers. Made greek tzatziki sauce to go with it; perfect!

A delicious blend of spices. Since we try to avoid red meat, I made these using a pound of ground veal and dried bread crumbs. I also substituted oregano for the savory since I don't have savory on hand. I highly recomend these burgers.

This was just delish! We used all lamb and didn't have savory but it didn't seem to make any difference. We used Tzatziki Sauce I with it and it was a wonderful meal. I will make this again. Thank you!

turned out great. I melted a slice of feta cheese on top, served with Tzatziki sauce 1 and topped with tomato and cucumbers in a homemade pita. My 11 month old and 2 year old even ate them.

I think this was excellent, my wife and I both enjoyed it.  No lamb, so I used all beef and doubled the recipe.  Used some extra of each seasoning.  I added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to the mix for a better consistency in the meat.  Shaped them into about brick shape and grilled them.  With homemade pitas and tzatziki sauce, garden tomatoes and onions, it was excellent.  Will definitely do again.

Wow!  Tasted just like our favorite greek restaurant!  I baked mine in loaf form the day before, refrigerated & sliced thin & reheated the next day.  I also substituted thyme for savory.  (I read somewhere online it was a good substitute.)

Delicious! I added 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed red chili flakes because my husband likes things spicy. Instead of making burger-sized patties, I made small flattened meatballs and browned them in a large non-stick skillet. I served these with hummus, lettuce and tomatoes in warm whole-wheat pitas. I will definitely make these again!

We thought this was quite good!  Instead of making small patties, I just mixed it all together and browned it in a frying pan.  I also made a gyro sauce to go with it (2/3 cup plain yogurt, 1/3 cup finely chopped cucumber, 1/4 cup finely chopped onion, & some parsley).

I did not use lamb since I don't like it, used 1 lb extra lean ground beef. My whole family loved this, served with tzatiki sauce, Greek salad and roasted potatoes.

My boyfriend loved this recipe. I thought it was a little too Lamby, next time I will do a  25:75 mix for lamb to beef istead of 50:50. But the flavor was good. We will never need to go out for Gryos again.

Very good as written for the burgers!  I wish I could have found the savory, but like others I ended up substituting with oregano.  I also tried making this in a loaf form for gyros, but made this way I would only give it 4 stars - only because we have a wonderful greek restaurant we love and this doesn't have quite the texture or flavor as what they serve for gyros.  BUT this is not a gyro recipe, it is burger recipe and even the adaption to gyro meat is still really good and the closest I have come to making decent gyros myself.

These were really very tasty.  I did not have savory, so substituted oregano.  I made rectangular patties and broiled them in the oven.  Topped with my own "gyro" sauce (greek yogurt, chopped cucumber, dill, black pepper).  My 5 y.o. said "yummy, yummy, yummy.  This is awesome" as he downed 1.5 patties!

These were great!  I didn't change the recipe at all and they turned out delicious.  I think next time I might crumble the meat after cooking instead of making patties.  I think it would be easier to put into pitas.

Delicious! Made a few changes. Didn't have Savory,substituted with Oregano. Omitted allspice and added a dash of cayenne for heat. Shaped into 2 inch wide and 5 inch patties and grilled on indoor grilled. Hubby won't stop talking about how DELICIOUS they were! Thanks!

A little bit messy if you add the sauce but SOOO worth it! I had to make some alterations to this. Instead of lamb I used ground pork because my supermarket didnt have lamb. Instead of making patties out of it I just cooked it like you would for spagetti. I made the sauce with plain yogurt, sour cream, fresh chopped mint, garlic salt and chopped tomato. I added monterey jack cheese and stuffed it all into the pita. Excellent! Now I am hoping they freeze and thaw well as I made this as premade lunches for my husband (but snuck one for myself when I was done) hehe! You definatly need to try this one at least once!

We thought this was just OK.  I did not have any ground beef, so I made it with all ground lamb.  We love lamb, so we thought if would be ok. The spice blend was tasty, but not awesome.

I did not care for this.  I think that is because I have confirmed that I do not like lamb. However, my husband does like lamb and in fact loves shaved lamb gyros and he did not care for this recipe either. He didn't hate it, but doesn't care to ever have it again either. Sorry.

This was just OK for me/us. Made this for my bf and I last night. We were craving gyros and didn't feel like leaving the house for them! I think my bf liked these more than I did (but I am picky sometimes...). I don't think they tasted anything like gyros (well, maybe a little...), but serving them on warm pita bread with tzatziki sauce, red onion, cucumber and tomato made them "seem" like the real thing. I couldn't find savory (thought I once had a bottle... I cleaned my spice drawer before Thanksgiving and think I might have tossed the 1+ year old bottle then!), so I subbed an equal amount of dried thyme ( my bf read on the Internet that thyme is the closest substitute for savory). I also added about a 1/2 t of dried oregano per another reviewer's suggestion. For the lean beef, I used sirloin, and, of course the lamb! It's too cold to grill outside, so I just broiled all patties for 5 minutes on one side and 3 on the other (and I had more like 6 patties, not 4). I sliced the meat "patties" into strips, added tzatziki sauce I by Serena Liew and all the fixins' to make gyro sandwiches. Served with a side of seasoned waffle fries this was a decent "homemade" substitute for the meal I usually get at our local Greek restaurant. For the amount of effort involved, I think I'll just go get the authentic stuff up the street next time. Thanks for sharing!

I made the recipe as written and it was wonderful. Used pita instead of hamburger bun, and also made a tzitiki sauce (however you spell it!) from this website. I shared the recipe with a friend who also said she loved it. Will definitely make again.

This is just like the gyros that I get at fairs.  I made a double batch and pressed 1/2 into patties and the other half into meatballs, which I will freeze and use later...maybe for a greek salad.  For the patties, I topped it w/"yogurt sauce" (I was out of yogurt but FF sourcream worked just as well), veggies, and feta.  Will definetly make it again.

Absolutely delicious with Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce and feta on pita bread.  I doubled the recipe and couldn't find dried savory anywhere but it's great without.  My roommate and I devoured them!

OMG!  *both* of my kids said this is the best meal i've ever made "since they were born", and even the pint-sized guest gave it exuberant thumbs up. kids had them on warmed pitas w/ lettuce, tomato, black olives and sauce from "sean's falafel & cucumber sauce" on this site; i had mine sliced up as a salad topper with the cuke sauce as dressing and my bread on the side. we used all ground turkey and i cooked them on the foreman grill, because i'm counting calories.  amazing, delicious, YUM! i'll be making 5# of these for quick from-the-freezer meals.

**update** just made a stroganoff version of this, using ground turkey for the meat. cooked the meat & spices up together ahead of time & froze loose, for serving reheated, spooned over egg noodles, stirred in yogurt & lowfat hummus,  & topped w/ shredded cucumber. Yum!

These were great! Used all hamburger with seasonings. Lined a pita with lettuce put meat inside topped it with chopped cucumber, tomato and a little onion not to much onion because you don't want it to over power the rest. Used a mayo, sugar, mustard, milk sauce. The cucumber and tomato was what made it YUM!

I had organic beef stew and lamb shoulder on hand, so decided to grind it to try this recipe. The only change made was in omitting the cumin.(just can't acquire a taste for this spice.) Substituted in it's place, 1/8 tsp of cayenne. Made a small burger to taste while I turned the ground meat and spices into meatballs to freeze. The flavor was marvelous! If anyone plans to make this into meatballs. grind on your fine blade. this makes a tighter meatball. I used the processor to mix the bread, oinions, garlic and seasoning then combined this mixture with the freshly ground meat by hand. 2&1/2 lbs of meat made 21 medium sized meatballs. Thank you chef Kenneth! Always looking for new taste experiences that don't call for obscure ingredients! Vivienne65

Very good! I didn't want patties so I cooked the meat in a big pan and added all the spices. Made with "Tzatsiki Sauce I", "Real Hummus" (to dip the extra Pita Bread), and "Gyros Dip" suggested by a reviewer (Mix some plain yougart, light sour cream, fresh mint, garlic salt, chopped cucumber, scallions, and tomato together.) Also, I used the "Tzatziki Sauce I" and "Gyros Dip" to put in "Gyros Burgers" and dip with tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots. Last but not least, we had extra "Greek Chicken Pasta" leftover so we had some of that too. Yummy. Greek Food Rocks.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I will probably increase the amount of seasonings next time I make it.  The flavor was good, just a little weak.

These were great! Used all ground beef since I couldn't find ground lamb at my market. A nice change from the usual burger. Next time I'll try to make a tzatziki sauce.

Oh how i wish i could have found ground lamb to use. I ended up making these with all beef since lamb is not avalible where i live they were diff but in a good way my husband loved them. TIP: make these as flat as you can they shrink and pull up during cooking.

Yum! Used lean ground turkey, and just browned it. It was super easy and fast, kind of like a gyro taco. You have to serve it w/ tzatziki sauce, whatever recipe you like(I used Yia Yia's on the site). My fiance who NEVER likes to eat leftovers ate it for lunch and dinner the next day.

This tastes GREAT (especially with tzatziki sauce). Instead of making patties, we just cooked it in a pan like ground beef. But BEWARE!!!!!!!!! This will stink up the house something aweful. Best if cooked outside. :)

This was yummy!!  Instead of making into burgers, I crumbled it up and cooked in a skillet until the meat was browned. After adding the meat mixture in the pita I added tzaitzi sauce, onions, and feta.  My picky eating daughter loved the pita so will definately be making this one again.

I didn't have lamb so I used a beef/pork/veal mixture worked out fine just a little dry, lamb is more oily. I didn't grill the meat I cooked it in a skillet (with butter). It was well seasoned and tasted close to the real thing. Definitely will make again.

This is a very good recipe.  I didn't have all the spices so I used an all-purpose greek seasoning. I also omitted the bread and the recipe was fine without it. The gyros tasted just like the one's in the restaurant.  Thanks for sharing!

We tried this recipe tonight but I guess we were hoping for a taste more like the original gyro meat, so we were disappointed.  Thanks for sharing it though. It wasnt terrible, just not what we were hoping for.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and also the sauce recipe from this website.  I have done these on the grill and also in a skillet on the stove.  Very good both ways.  This is a keeper.

The spice combination used in the meat was delicious.  However, the recipe didn't quite match the quality of gyro that I had in Germany.  Still looking...

I've made this exactly how the recipe says and it's great, but I like to change it slightly so it's a fast, easy, healthy meal I can cook after work. I use ground extra lean turkey, garlic powder, dehydrated onion, add 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and use 1/2 cup bread crumbs and an egg. After mixing it up, I press it in a thin layer onto a large cookie sheet covered with oiled foil. Then I broil it for about 5 minutes, until cooked through and browned. No need to flip it! Slice into strips and serve as described in the recipe, with tomato cucumber salad in a vinaigrette on the side. So fast and so delicious.

We made this but omitted the beef (pure lamb just tasted better, more gyro and less burger) and the savory (we couldn't find it). We placed them on wheat pitas and made tzatziki sauce to go with it. Yummy.

This is a staple recipe for me. It tastes as good as the restaurant gyros! I make up a bunch of these and freeze them. Then I heat them up in the microwave at work. For sauce, I use the Tzatziki Sauce recipe on this website. 
Thanks so much for sharing! Fantastic recipe!

Very tasty burgers.  I only used 93% lean beef.  I also cooked the burgers then broiled them with feta.  I topped them with cucumber sauce and tomatoes. Yum

We doubled the recipe but made these exactly as stated. They were excellent! We did cut them into strips to fit better inside pita bread. Goes great with hummus and kalamata olives on the side.

My husband had been looking for a recipe like this one. It was really a very good burger. I suggest serving it on regular buns instead of on a pita. There was too much pita bread, and not enough meat for me. We'll definately make this again though.

I thought these turned out really good. I didn't have the savory or the coriandor, but they still turned out really good. I will make these again when I want gyros.

I couldn't find the lamb anywhere around my little town so I just used hamburger for all of it.  Still turned out tasting very much like the Gyros I was craving.  They were a little crumbly though and I ended up cooking them on a broiler pan because I think they would have fallen through the grill racks had I tried to make them that way.  Very good flavor though.  I'll continue to use this recipe.

Following the recipe I found it to be very good. I also felt that I could play with it a little to add a stronger punch, and to personalize it a bit. thanks. Family liked it.

These were just ok.  I was really looking forward to them, but the flavor just wasn't that great.

I love gyros ... but this recipe bore little resemblance, was not tasty.

Although these were good and I will make them again with a couple of variations (I am going to add some oregano), my Greek husband didn't think they were that "authentic."

Very good!  The tzatziki sauce on the side is a must have.  I couldn't find savory, so I substituted pickling spice as I've seen that called for in some Greek recipes.  Husband said it's a keeper!  Thanks Chef Ken!
