These were very strong-tasting, and had an off, tinny, aftertaste.  They were "soft" cookies, but, IMO, had the texture of a stale cookie.

We thought these cookies were wonderful.  I used regular strawberry preserves.  I imagine that the after taste that previous comments complained about were from using reduced sugar or no sugar preserves.  Yuck.  The combination of the strawberry and chocolate chips made for a great taste.  These were so easy to make and were so moist and soft.  I will make again.

First, the video associated with this recipe is misleading--the batter/dough does not come out smooth and glossy.  Instead, it is quite chunky and dull-colored.  I actually had to turn off my mixer and finish incorporating the cake mix by hand.  Secondly, the taste is terrible.  They are far too sweet, and the strawberry flavor actually tasted artificial.  Ultimately, the cookies tasted like overly sweet, cheap, chewy strawberry candy

They had a fizzy, effervescent quality that reminded me of eating an alka-seltzer.

It's like eating strawberry bubblegum cookies. Different, but I loved them!

These cookies had a horrible metallic taste to them & were not soft & chewy, they were hard & chewy. I think the aftertaste was due to the angel food cake mix. As another reviewer noted they had kind of a fizzy mouth feel. I used regular strawberry jam, but these cookies had neither a pleasant texture nor taste. I will not make them again & recommend that smuckers fix this recipe. Even my little boys wouldn't eat them,

They had a weird taste and cooked funny. They were soft though. I did not care for this recipe.
