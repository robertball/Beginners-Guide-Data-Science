This recipe was a great way to use up the veggies from my farm box. I added a little broccoli to the first round of veggies in the pan, and they cooked just fine. I also realized half way through that I didn't have couscous or quinoa like I thought I had. So, I used arborio rice and made it into a kind of risotto. Took longer to cook but it worked okay in the end. The raisins are the key in this recipe, really good plump raisins. Yum!

I used 1 onion instead of a leek and an onion, 1 large tomato instead of 2 average sized ones, water instead of broth, and raisins as the fruit.  This was a tasty salad atop of a lettuce leaf!

Very excited to make this dish based on ingredients which I followed exactly and found it tasted more like chicken noodle soup than anything else. I added the curry powder to taste which was the reason it got 2 stars and my kids liked it (cause it tasted like chicken noodle soup!)  I would make again and use a vegetable soup base instead.

This was the first time I have attempted couscous and it was really easy and delicious! I subbed out some ingredients for others but it was still spot on.

so easy and delicious! I added dill to it, just 'cause I happened to have a lot of fresh dill, and it was amazing!
