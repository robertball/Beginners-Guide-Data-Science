Boiled potatoes longer (10 minutes). Sliced into fries and spread onto baking pan coated with Pam Spray.  Mixed melted butter and brown sugar and spread over potatoes, stirring around.  Sprinkled some cinnamon on top of potatoes and baked instead of frying.  For the last ten minutes, adjusted oven from BAKE to BROIL.  Turn over several times while baking.

I tried these tonight cause my husband was wanting some sweet potatoe french fries. Well the recipe turned out to be the texture of baked sweet potatoes. I made two batches the first batch was alright and the brown sugar wasn't that sticky but they were very very sugary. The second batch I left them in a little bit longer and the sugar stuck together and the potatoes stuck together. It tasted like a ball of sugar going down. I suggest if you are trying to french fry use a deep fryer and through your sweet potatoes in there. My husband and I are Sweet Potatoe lovers and we said we wouldn't do this recipe again. Hope that helps.

I cannot say anything about this particular recipe. However while growing up, I am from Texas. My mother always just peeled and cut the sweet potatoes into round slices and then just steam fried them with butter, brown sugar, and a small amount of white sugar. Cooked until tender. And they were always eaten up. Yum, Yum

Great recipe with some modifications.  I peeled and sliced my potatoes before boiling for 5-6 min.  While they were draining I melted 1 stick butter in the pan and added 1/2 onion sliced thinly, then added a dash of cinnamon and only 1 cup loosely packed brown sugar.  After a few minutes I tossed in the potatoes and let them cook another 5-10 min.  Everyone liked them!

Loved it!  Great comfort food.  My family really liked it too.  I need to mention however, if you are looking for french fry type fries - this is not the recipe for you.  As others have mentioned, these are carmelized sweet potates not like fries at all.

There is no need to blanch the sweet potaoes. Peel, cut them into rounds about 1/4 inch-to 1/2 inch thick.  Melt 1 stick of butter over medium heat, arrange the potaoes, then put about 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  Keeping heat low will prevent the butter and sugar from being lumpy and burnt.  And provides an excellent "sauce" for the potatoes.  These poatoes are done when fork tender--about 30 minutes.

I will be making this often as a quick and easy way to fix sweet potatoes for my family.  We loved this so much we could easily have eaten three times the amount I prepared!  TIP:  I sliced the potatoes into rounds while waiting for the water to boil; this shortens the cook time.  Also,  In a pinch, white sugar will do just fine.

I was raised having my sweet potatoes done this way for the Hollidays.And for a change now and again I would sprinkle on some Pecans and mini marshmellows just before they are done so the nuts would get warm and the marshmellows would melt. p.s. If no time to boil potatoes, use the canned one, but drain them good.

My grandma made fried sweet potatoes like these when I was growing up. They are the ultimate comfort food in my book! Tender and flavorful with a rich buttery brown sugar glaze and chunks of carmelized brown sugar sticking to them. YUMMMM!!

Frying the sweet potatoes is intriguing, but this is way too much sugar!  I find that  frying the sweet potatoes brings out enough of their natural sweetness.

I'm not crazy about sweet potatoes--but I made this dish for my family who does love them...and the kitchen smelled GREAT!! It's the same time-honored recipe my mom served us back in the 70s.  My wife and son are my toughest food critics--and both RAVED how yummy the sweet potatoes were. I sampled a few and have to agree: This is a keeper.

These were SO delicious but the boiling time was too short. I added sugar and cinnamon instead of brown sugar. Everyone LOVED them, they were just a little underdone and should be boiled longer.

I've made this recipe twice already and it's delicious. Second time I made it I peeled and cut the sweet potatoes then microwaved them in 3 min intervals until it was done. Then I fried them with the butter, brown sugar and a little salt and sage. Good stuff!

Tasty! Will be using this method regularly for sweet potatoes. With just me and my husband, I used one big sweet potato, cut into fours to boil and then cubed before frying. I used about 2T brown sugar and 3T butter

Very yummy.  I sliced the sweet potatoes into fries prior to boiling.  Boiled 4 minutes & then fried for about 10.  They came out perfect!!

The bettern name for these are candied sweet potatoes.  These remind me of the ones my mom made growing up.  I thought they were easy and good.  I used two large sweet potatoes boiled for 5 minutes and cut them up into 1/2 slices like in the picture.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 14/ cup brown sugar and that was perfect.  I added a little salt at the end.

I made these the other night for dinner. They were delicious. I had two very large sweet potatoes so I boiled them for 15 minutes before I fried them. I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar with one stick of butter. They turned out perfect. I can't imagine using 2 cups of brown sugar.

As written, I give this recipe 4 stars. It is very close to how I do sweet potatoes for the holidays. I slice my potatoes first, (I know with larger sweet potatoes this is not easy unless you have a good medallion slicer,) parboil for 2-3 minutes, then fry a few at a time in a little butter (I don't measure.) While they are frying, I SPRINKLE a little brown sugar across the lot of them. After a few minutes, I flip them and do the same on the other side. Then I move these to a serving dish in a warm oven, and repeat until all the slices are fried. The texture is much better than trying to fry all at once, and I'm sure I use WAY less than 2 cups of sugar. I doubt I use a full cup. The sweetness of the potatoes is simply enhanced by the brown sugar, not overpowered by it.

Mine came out a little too sweet and I used half the sugar. I like my sweet potatoes sweet but my husband did not not care for it much. I will probably make it again using muchless sugar.

I boiled the sweet potatoes longer as suggested by another review.  This was my first time making sweet potato anything and I like it.  Easy and tasty.  I used my own measurements for the sugar and butter because I only cooked 2 potatoes.  Would cook again.  I liked the texture and fried mine a little longer for a crispier finish.

These sweet potatoes are the BEST!!!! We totally looovvveee this recipe and it went into our family recipe book as a keeper because we have adopted it as one of our family dishes that we will serve many times and pass down to our children.   I did only use 1c. of brown sugar because that is all I could find and it was perfect and dark brown. I did have to use a little more butter and I fried videlia onions with it which is awesome and great for a change. I toped the potatoes with the fried onions and the extra sauce I drizzled over the top.  Totally awesome! Thanks so much Lisa!

My sweet potato was about 8 oz. so I boiled it longer.  It still took quite awhile to tender while frying in the pan.  Next time I will cut the potato before boiling.  Tasted good, I eyeballed the other ingredients.  Definately turned out "carmelized."

I really think this deserves a 5 for taste, but the boiling time was seriously lacking.  I had to boil the sweet potato for 15 minutes.  Didn't measure the butter and sugar I used, but believe it was less than the recipe called for.  A very delicious, quick (if you boil the potato ahead of time), and easy way to fix a single sweet potato without using the oven.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I thought it was going to be more like french fries.  I actually made the turkey burgers to go with this.  This was more carmelized than fried.  Still a good meal and definitely something I would  make again.  I will probably do some modifications and see if I can get them more fried the next time around.

Awesome, easy recipe that everyone loves! I fried the potatoes in 3 batches of 2 potatoes each because my pan is small. The first batch took a while to cook because of the sugar ( it was a bit much), so I cut the brown sugar by half in the 2nd and 3rd batches, and they cooked faster. Other than that, I would recommend this recipe to my friends who cook.

These are good enough for a 5 star rating even though i did use only 1 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of butter for 9 rather small organic sweet potatoes. So i did not change the ingredients just the measurements. Oh i did throw in a handful of pecans toward the end of cooking.

I made this account just to review these.

I've made worse stuff than this before, but never by following a recipe. These don't fry. They don't even cook all the way. You probably need to boil the potatoes for 15 minutes to even have a chance of this working. Much better to just use oil. I was able to sorta salvage the effort by rinsing them off and using oil. But not really.

If you enjoy something very sweet you may enjoy it. I'm not big on sweet things, I even used less sugar. It's as sweet as the candy on a candy apple.

Like some of the other reviewers noted, the sweet potatoes come out more carmelized than fried but that's exactly what I was looking for so I wasn't surprised.  I fried up two larget sweet potatoes and my boyfriend liked them so much he barely left any for me!  Goes great with the Rosemary Pork Tenderloin.

I've fried sweet potatoes for years, and never added the brown sugar and they were good. But these were better. Just a little too much sugar for me...So I will add a little less next time.

I am not sure if I did something wrong with this recipe or if the recipe was wrong in some way, but the 1/2 cup of butter along with the TWO cups of PACKED brown sugar, well, the brown sugar never melted completely and I kept adding more butter and it just turned out into this THICK concoction that could NO WAY be used to fry anything!!  Help!!  What went wrong??!!

I only boiled the small 4 potatoes I had for about 10 minutes approximately, I didn't measure butter or light brown sugar I had that prepared before the potatoes were done, I sliced them in circles and put them in pan and sprinkled more brown sugar I would say I used 3 tablespoons of butter maybe 4 and maybe 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I love sweet potatoes and will make this again!

I changed the prep for the sweet potatoes, as I cut them super thin using the thin setting on my mandolin. Then put the sweet potatoes on the butter raw. Turned out great with the edges of the potatoes being a bit crispy while the rest was soft and delicious.

The first time I made these, the potatoes were a little too mushy after boiling them. Now when I make them, I fry the potatoes instead of boiling.

This recipe turned out nice. I did it for 3 servings. I used 2 round sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter.  I boiled the potatoes for 4 minutes and cooked for twenty min stirring every few minutes. 
Nice, sweet, and on point.

I was hoping this dish was going to be like the chips that you buy at the fair or something. These came out like hard candy. I will not use this recipe again. I'm not saying anything other than I didnt get what I wanted out of it. I probably did something wrong.

I feel horrible rating this so low, but we were really disappointed in this recipe. I couldn't even finish my serving! I did follow others advice & boil the sweet potatoes for 10 minutes, but I think it was the brown sugar/butter combo that we were not a fan of. first of all, like someone else said, if you want fried sweet potatoes - this IS NOT the recipe to use! second, these were WAY too sugary & carmelized. we were scraping off the brown sugar coating & adding salt but it still didn't help. AND to top it all off they are a MESS! will not be making this recipe again. sorry.

My mom made sweet potatoes like this, but without the brown sugar.Just salt and pepper, fried in butter. I didn't there was any other way to cook then!  Easy and good.

These were great! So easy and quick. My picky husband even thought they were good. And my 5 year old wanted these instead of regualr fries the next time.

I love these.  My 2 year old wouldn't touch them (the smell of spices I guess).  I will definately make these again.

really good!  They do take some time to prepare, the browning until tender takes a while, next time I will prepare these early and reheat. Went great with Thanksgiving

My mother always made these when I was growing up but never bothered boiling them ahead of time. She did cook longer however. This was pretty good.

My fiance and roommate really liked them.  I didn't like them so much because I wanted something more like sweet potato french fries.  These were more like carmelized sweet potatoes.

I wish I had boiled the sweet potatoes longer, and used MUCH less brown sugar.  Looking forward to trying this one again with these modifications...
