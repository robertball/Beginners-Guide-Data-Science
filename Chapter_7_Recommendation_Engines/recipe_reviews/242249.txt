I made this according to directions except for cutting back the servings, using coconut oil rather than vegetable oil (a perfect sub!), and using currants rather than dates which I was out of.  I love the toasted nuttiness and the sweetness of the fruits, and the flavor of the cardamom was just right for us.  I used the granola specifically for some lovely dense pancakes on this site, and this added just exactly the right amount of sweetness to those.  I would make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, Hope!
