This salad was excellent. I used dried cranberries because that's what I had on hand and it was delicious. What a great way for me to get the Hubbster to eat spinach.

Made this salad for a summer BBQ, so easy and yummy!  The feta and pineapple is such a good combination.  I couldn't find dried tart cherries, so I used craisins, they seemed like a good substitute.
