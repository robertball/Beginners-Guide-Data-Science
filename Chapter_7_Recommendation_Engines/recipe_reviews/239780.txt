DELISH! This was so good, it was eaten before I could even get a pic! I made a half batch, but wished I had made a full batch. I used a medium roasted tomato & chipotle salsa (World Table brand) and the flavors were perfect!  I made it exactly as written and the chicken was super tender. I will definitely be making this again! No need to change a thing!

For personal preference, I used only half the Cumin and omitted the Cilantro. The chicken breast seemed dry so I would try thigh meat next time. Also it was more like a soup vs thick like a Chili. The taste was excellent. I'll definitely try this again.

Chicken & White Bean Chili Haiku: "Used Great Northern beans, instead of cannellini. Well, they both are white!" Did everything as written other than my above swap, and also making this stupid easy by using a Costco large can of Kirkland chicken in place of the breast. This chili REALLY surprised us as to how tasty it was, but I think one has to use a good quality salsa, since there is neither chili powder nor diced tomatoes in this recipe. Will look forward to making this again (and again, and again) and definitely give it a try w/ cannellinis and/or chicken breast as written!

After seeing a can of white chicken chili in the grocery store, I searched Allrecipes for a better recipe using fresh ingredients. This one delivered! I did change it a bit for our wimpy tastes: used deli chicken (white and dark meat), substituted a red pepper for jalapeño, Roasted Salsa Verde (World Table brand), 1 t. cumin, 1/8 t. pepper, no cayenne, 1 t. dried cilantro, 3 cans of white beans and about 2 cups of homemade chicken stock. Excellent! Served with sautéed greens, cornbread and fresh pineapple.

Both my husband and I loved this chili . I can tell you if you used the jalapeno peppers, I am sure that your mouth had to be on fire. I did not use them, I cut the spices in half except for the black pepper and I used crushed red pepper flakes for the heat. DELISH, for those who don't like cilantro, forget about it, it tastes fine without it.

followed the recipe with these exceptions: used half a jar of herndez Verde instead of tomato salsa. used only one jalapeno.  added 2tb each of flour and cornstarch later to help it thicken up (used some broth from the soup and l in a separate bowl to mix before incorporating into the soup to avoid lumps).  Crowd pleaser for sure, turned out very nice with a mild amount of spiciness.

Yes, didn't want to make a trip to Safeway so bought all ingredients from Target.   Bean selection wasn't great but they had "white beans" which seemed a lot smaller than cannelloni beans.  Should have used 3 cans of those instead of two.  Was super spicy with the two jalapenos but it was good!  We used more cilantro and shredded colby jack cheese as a garnish.  Served with Juanitas corn chips!

This is now our new favorite chicken chili!! Have always used the White Bean and Chicken Chili recipe from this site, but my husband has never cared for it. Tried this one to see if he would like it better and boy am I glad I did!!! This recipe is REALLY GOOD! I would personally back off on the chili powder a little but as I did find it a bit spicey, but my guys loved it as is. Followed the recipe exactly except for adding extra cilantro (our personal preference). So easy. So yummy!

I dropped the peppers and jalepenos because I had plenty of those in the home made salsa I used with it.

So good!  I cooked the chicken breasts whole and then shredded rather than dicing at the beginning.  I also whisked a teaspoon of Umami paste into the chicken broth before adding it to the soup.  Not sure if that made the difference but the chili was wonderful!

This was delicious. I only added about half the broth in the recipe and cooked it a bit longer than called for. Some of the beans broke down and thickened it up a bit. It was great.....my new favorite chili recipe!

This chili turned out pretty  good. I used whole chicken breast seared in a cast iron skillet with cayenne and black pepper, then dropped them in the bottom of my slow cooker. I blackened the green peppers as well in the skillet. Then added everything to the slow cooker as the recipe says and cooked for 8 hours on low. After the 8 hours, I shredded the chicken. How I think this could be better: add a red pepper just like the green pepper (blackened in skillet as well) a little less chicken and another can of white beans... always more spice as well.

It was very good. Great taste, but far too spicy. I don't think I'm a total wimp when it comes to spice (I like medium salsa, not mild) but will tone it down next time.

I used this recipe is a base because of its rating and changed it a little so that I could use up some items I had on hand. I substituted chicken thighs for the chicken breasts, used garlic salt because I was out of garlic, used half a jar of salsa and a half a container of grape tomatoes. I upped jalapeños to three Because the salsa I used was mild and I have a lot of jalapeños on hand.  I also used dried cilantro rather than fresh, and I added a Bayleaf and some dried oregano to the herb mix.  This turned out delicious, which goes to show a good base recipe can easily be tweaked to use up things you have on hand.  When I served up a bowl for lunch I added a dollop of plain yogurt and guacamole and mixed it in, making the broth creamy and kicking the flavor up a notch.  I froze two servings of this for lunch next week, so I’ll see how it holds up when defrosted and reheated.  As far as I’m concerned this recipe is a winner and I will definitely keep this in my repertoire.

Very good! A little spicy for me (I only used 1 jalapeno and no paprika) but great flavor! I used an orange pepper, there was green pepper in the salsa. I used fresh salsa.

I made this for me and wife for dinner so I halved all ingredients which worked well- great flavor- we both doubled up on our servings so had only one bowl left over!  I substituted a 4oz can of diced green chili for the jalapeño and used chicken broth instead of the bouillon.  Next time I would do the same but use the two cans of beans- my wife likes beans!

I doubled the recipe but made it all in the crockpot. After cooking on high for several hours I pulled the chicken breasts out and shredded them. I did not add an extra can of beans as a few had suggested but wish I had. I will next time for sure. Cilantro is a must. I also stirred a couple of heaping teaspoons of sour cream into the entire pot just to cream it up a bit. I used 3 jalapeños in the double batch and the heat was perfect. For salsa I used Frontera Grill tomatillo salsa.

Outstanding! I followed the recipe closely - used only one jalapeno, however. It still had a nice heat. Used salsa verde, also. That kept the color creamy white, and tasted delicious. Brought to a family gathering and it got rave reviews. People expressed appreciation for a break from red chili. Don't omit the cilantro! It added a lovely flavor and good look.

This was quick, simple and very tasty. Strip a Costco Rotisserie Chicken for a cheaper, more flavorful/tender protein. Spice was on point as written. Used both jalapeños. Mashed a third of the beans to thicken. Served with grated pepper jack, sour cream and additional cilantro.

Outsanting; a new staple in our household
