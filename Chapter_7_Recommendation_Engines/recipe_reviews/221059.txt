I used homemade frozen vanilla GREEK yogurt in this recipe and I cut the milk back by half. This was good, but I think it could be great with the addition of more strawberries.

I didnâ€™t have frozen vanilla yogurt but I think using frozen strawberries and basic refrigerated yogurt was an acceptable substitute in a pinch.  The shake was good as is, but Hubs and I both thought it needed a bolder fruit flavor and a little more sweetness.  I blended in significantly more strawberries and just a teeny bit of Splenda and it was much improved.

YUM!  I doubled the strawberries but next time I will cut the milk in half for a thicker shake.  Made with yogurt and 1% milk makes for a no-guilt treat.  Thank you Froggy+Popovers= for sharing your recipe.

I cut the milk in half and used a creamy vanilla ice cream instead of frozen yogurt.

Loved the recipe, but added more strawberries. Used less milk and only used 0% milk and low fat yogurt . Yummy and healthy!
