My sons were starving after swimming all afternoon, so I made this for a quick late-afternoon lunch. At first my seven & nine year olds weren't crazy about the fact that there was broccoli in their spaghetti, but once they tasted it they finished everything on their plates. This is so easy to make and we were all pleasantly surprised by how much we liked the combo. It's a keeper.

This recipe really surprised me. I expected it to just taste like separate components. It does have an exorbitant amount of parmesan cheese, but I would make it just as is. It all comes together and the traditional jarred sauce, which I am not normally a fan of, works well in this with the added olive oil and extra parmesan cheese. I cooked the pasta and broccoli in my pan with 3" sides, to fit everything. I highly suggest the store bought pre-chopped broccoli. Mine was already chopped small. I just microwaved the sauce in a bowl for 5 minutes. After draining I added everything back to the pot I cooked the pasta in. I did find adding the olive oil and parmesan on top worked best, for even distribution, once I transferred it all to a 13x9 disposable pan. I found, this recipe is best the same day. Either way, a meal in 20 minutes, not bad!

I'm used to meat being in my spaghetti sauce, so perhaps that is why I thought it was a little bland. But this is a good way to go meatless AND get a veggie in.

This recipe was great for a quick weeknight meal. I used steamed broccoli in this dish. The sauce to me is a little bland. I definitely will doctor it up in the future. Such a nice simple weeknight dinner.

Quick, easy and recipe with great flavor. I will admit that I cooked the pasta till it was almost done then finished it off in the sauce. Great recipe I will be making again.

Made it for a light lunch, and oh what a great lunch it was! This recipe is easy to make and really good to eat. I had my doubts about the fresh broccoli in a pasta dish with red sauce, but it was good. It was also easy to cook, putting it in with the pasta the last couple of minutes of cooking-I love that technique! The olive oil was also a nice touch. Highly recommended for lunch or dinner. Great stovetop meal for a hot summer.

Some of you may know I manage a soup kitchen, so I am always looking for inexpensive, nutritious food that is eye pleasing and doesn't seem institutional.  I found a deal for 10 jars of sauce for $10 and the same for the pasta. That store also discounts heavily for us so we will get several meals out of this recipe. Fresh broccoli is available around here year round at prices that won't break the bank. I rough chopped the broccoli to stretch it and we used grated white mystery cheese that came from a donor.  It was a huge success!  Thank you Barilla!

So I admit to making some changes but we had to watch my niece and nephew unexpectedly so I didn't have a chance to go to the store.  I used Barilla's whole grain penne pasta for this and actually put the broccoli in a food processor to chop it up so finely that the kids wouldn't notice it.  I added it to the jarred sauce (with some sautéed onions and shallots) and SUCCESS!  I also added in some vegetarian "meat balls" to further disguise my dinner deceit.  It was easy and healthy and my husband took the leftovers for lunch.  It was like a trifecta of supper success.  I feel like I should wear a cape the next time I make it. 
The kids loved it and wanted seconds and now they will never know just how tricky Aunt Jamie can be (until they read this in a few years.)  Hehe.

pretty decent in a pinch and two yr old approved.  I didn't have actual premade sauce, just  crushed tomatoes.  but i sauteed a little onion, garlic in EVOO into it, added basil and parsley, salt, crushed red pepper and threw in some left over peas and mushrooms. EVOO and parmesan on top are a must.

This recipe was so simple and I thought my meat eating fiancé wouldn't be satisfied with a meatless recipe. I was wrong! He had seconds and my son loved it as well! I served it with garlic breadsticks and it went over very well.

Awesome!  I really liked the broccoli added in the last couple of minutes of cooking- and surprisingly, so did my picky daughter who gobbled it up!  I added some cherry tomatoes to the sauce and honestly completely forgot to add the parmesan and it was still very good!
