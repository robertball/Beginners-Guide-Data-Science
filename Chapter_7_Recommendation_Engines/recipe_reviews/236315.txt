Yum!  I love this--as a snack or as a filling for sandwiches.  Instead of dipping in milk, however, I brushed with olive oil then dipped in the topping.  It was cooked a bit longer--was helping hubs repair a window--but it still turned out delicious.  I love the flavor, and the cornmeal and flour mix worked well.  I used my mandolin to slice the baby eggplant I had, so I ended up with lengthwise slices instead of rounds--baby eggplant is apparently too small for rounds on my mandolin.  I did salt, rinse, and pat dry before putting on the topping.  I really enjoyed this, and since hubs won't touch eggplant, it's all mine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't like to stink up the house frying.  This tasted so good and it was so easy.  Will try this with zucchini.

I was so excited about trying this recipe as all 3 reviews were 5's.  Well, not sure what happened but mine didn't turn out as well.  I kept to the recipe, only change was I forgot to oil the pan(I did brush the tops), so when I flipped them half way through I brushed EVOO on the tops. I will say I had some that didn't fit into the oven so I pan fried them and we both agreed those were 5's but not the ones from the oven.  Sorry, but the other two recipes I tried from this site were much better as written.  So if trying this recipe, maybe you should pan fry.  The breading is tasty.

I found this to be fairly tasteless and dry. If I make it again, I'll serve it with pasta sauce (we didn't have any on hand today). It would probably also be better with more seasonings and maybe parmesan cheese added to the breading mixture.

Good consistency of the eggplant. Cooked perfectly. The only change I made was I used Italian bread crumbs instead of those in the recipe. Nice & crisp vegetables.

Simple recipe with great results. Next time, I will  brush the eggplant with more oil when I flip them since I still had some flour on the outside.

Catastrophe.  The eggplant was soggy and the flour only added dryness.  Will go back to pan frying in future.

I followed instructions but did not brush the top of each piece with olive oil, and after 20 minutes when I flipped them they were still all white and dry from the flour mixture. So I brushed them with olive oil and made sure there was no white on them at all, and it seemed to crisp and cook, but it took like 45 minutes. They were bland when done, and to save them I kosher salt and black peppered them real good, which made them edible. I love baking eggplant with an Asian sauce on them, but in terms of breading them - they need to be fried. And I'd suggest seasoning them before dipping in the breading.

My first time eating eggplant that I enjoyed for a change! A while back, a friend of mine prepared it a different way and I found I didn't care for it. Turned me off of it ever since, actually. Now I'm glad I gave it another chance! I didn't have cornmeal on hand so I made do with Panko bread crumbs. Still came out good. :-) Definitely making again, but next time around I will try it using cornmeal.
