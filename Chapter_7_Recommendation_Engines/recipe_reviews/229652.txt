What I liked the most about this salad was the cutting of calories with the yogurt and you don't miss any flavor. In fact I used more lemon juice after tasting, because I like it so much. I didn't have any grapes so subbed raisins (after all I was using dried cranberries anyway.) Still very good. So easy to make your own way. Next time I will add a little celery...I added celery seed, but still wanted a bit of celery. Also, I used the Rotisserie chicken made from this site. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing I would suggest to make it better is to prepare it the day before eating it so that the flavors can blend together. It was good the first day, but awesome the second and third day. I added a few more nuts to add a little more crunch.

I used our leftover Thanksgiving turkey in this recipe and my entire family loved it. They are asking for it again with  our leftover turkey at Christmas.  Great recipe.

It's great. I definitely suggest that you make it a couple of days ahead. I made it one day ahead, but leftovers got better for the next 2 days...Flavor just gets better.

Had to make a few substitutions. Used green onions because the husband hates red, used a gala apple because that's what I had. Didn't have yogurt, so used 4tbsp of lemon juice,  whisked it with 1/2 cup mayo. We decided that was perfect. We added a little lemon pepper, thought it definitely needed a little seasoning. Yummy. Will definitely make this again.

We love this salad!   Simple ingredients, easy to change according to various food likes/dislikes, stores well in fridge for lunches, and good for you as well!   

I use a 2 lb 10oz bag of shredded rotisserie chicken pieces from Costco (found near the fancy cheeses in their deli section), add chopped apples (2, cored and chopped fine - whatever variety I have), about 6 celery stalks also chopped fine, a cup of mayo, a cup of plain yogurt, and several cups worth of halved grapes.   I haven't settled on seasonings yet, but usually add a couple tablespoons of dijon mustard or honey mustard salad dressing.   Stir it all up in a giant bowl, and throw into containers for the week.  It will just get better!     The nuts/cranberries/onion people add in to their individual servings since those don't keep as well in the salad.    Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken! I added celery but otherwise followed recipe as written. I only had Videlia onion, and it still is good, but if I make it again, I think the red onion would be better. The white onion was a bit strong. Very nice dressing we both enjoyed. Would make again.

Overall good recipe. I was on a time crunch with no time to make rotisserie chicken breast, nor did I want to spend $7 at the store to buy a whole chicken for just the breast meat, so I made regular chicken breast and seasoned it as if it was rotisserie. Added a little too much paprika which clashed with the vanilla yogurt.

I like the suggestion from another reviewer to make this a day prior to eating to let the flavors meld together better. Even with the clash I had, given everything else in the dish, it tasted good day 2 and 3. Will try again but with regular yogurt.

Except for the onion, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Vanilla yogurt, in my opinion, does not work - way too sweet - just didn't taste like it belonged to me.

Delish!  I see why it has perfect ratings!  I served it on a bed of spinach with blueberry muffins.  Outta sight!  My husband has given me strict orders to not change anything or experiment with the recipe!  I have no  desire to!  We also used a whole rotisserie chicken.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used left over turkey, added about 1/2 of a serrano pepper finely sliced, and 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard.  Added 1/2 cup diced celery. Used roasted rosemary sesame pecans, as that's what I had.  Otherwise followed the recipe and it is delightful on a green leaf lettuce, in a wrap, or just plain out of the bowl!

Loved this chicken salad!!  I used plain yogurt instead of vanilla to cut the sugar and it was still awesome.  Used Avocado Mayo instead of regular mayo to improve the healthy factor and it is fantastic too.

Delicious as is! Only change I made is I didn’t have a rotisserie chicken so I boiled two large chicken breasts instead and I added celery for crunch.

I used a few different ingredients, but it was yummy. Whisked mayo, sour cream, lemon juice, honey, balsamic vinegar and rosemary together. Added chicken, apples, cranberries, celery, pecans. I chopped up the iceberg lettuces and green leaf lettuce and tossed all together. My girls like it Iceberg so to compromise I mix two kinds of lettuce.

I have made this several times.  Perfect days when it's too hot to cook and you're not in the mood for a "heavy" meal.  I prefer to throw in a cup of diced celery,.  Sometimes I use red and green grapes, and/or red and green apples.  I never use cranberries, ick.  Depending on what was available, I have used pecans, walnuts and cashews.  All were a perfect addition.

Very good and refreshing meal. I layered lettuce on the bread for more crisp taste. I didn't have nuts or yogurt but it still was delicious.
