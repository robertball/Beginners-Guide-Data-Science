I eliminated the chocolate chips and nuts and used whole wheat flour.  They came out healthy and delicious!

When I make muffins with oatmeal (or oatmeal and nuts combined) I try to use half the amount, let it sit for five minutes or so after the batter's been mixed so that the oats have a chance to soak up some of the liquid added to the recipe, then see if the batter needs more oatmeal or not. This muffin batter did not--1/2 cup of oatmeal was plenty. I ran the oats through my food processor for a finer texture before using it. I cut the brown sugar back to a half cup, used my own homemade applesauce and only used a pinch of salt. Because I'm out of chocolate chips right now, I used raisins. These turned out very good--moist and chewy with a great deal of flavor from all the different additions in this muffin. We enjoyed these very much. I'm really glad I cut the oatmeal in half, I think if I hadn't, the muffins would have been too dry. I'll make this again.

I have been trying to reduce my husband's cholesterol.  He needs snacks to take to work for his break.  These were just WONDERFUL...very moist and sweet.  I gave some to my elderly parents and they loved them too.  I used egg substitute and also pecans because that's all I had.   Very yummy and good for you!  I LOVE this site!!!

Delightful!  What a great change from the plain old banana muffins.  The oatmeal adds texture, and the cinnamon adds a tasty twist.  And these are fat free?!?  Wow!

Mmm, these muffins make a nice, hearty snack.  I made the recipe exactly as directed with the exception of using Orgran No Egg Natural Egg Replacer since my son is allergic to eggs.  I also omitted the nuts since we aren't big fans.  The larger muffins took about 18-19 minutes, and the mini-muffins I made to use up the batter took about thirteen minutes.

Really did stay moist - didn't become gummy like muffins made with applesauce have a tendency to do.  Loved the flavor - great with tea! (I also used blueberries instead of chocolate and nuts)I may add more cinnamon next time.

In reply to first reviewer, these are NOT fat free muffins - they have chocolate
chips and walnuts in them!  The nutritional data lists them as having 6 grams
of fat.

Very light texture. Used whole wheat flour and raisins instead of the chocolate chips. Hard to resist not having a second. Have to keep a lookout for ripe bananas.

I would have given this recipe 10 stars. Absolutely thee best muffin I have ever made or tasted! Delicious and I stayed with the recipe ingredients except for these changes to make them a little more healthy. I used whole wheat flour, regular oats and instead of chocolate chips I folded in fresh blueberries plus I added a third cup of wheat germ and used two egg whites instead of one egg. Enjoy!

These were really good and certainly tasted "healthier" than a regular muffin.  I did not add chocolate chips, I can see where these would be great with raisins, dried fruit, etc.  I used pecan pieces instead of walnuts.  These do not rise really at all, so fill your muffin tins accordingly.  I will definitely make these again and try adding other things.  These also were not very "spice"-ey, so I would probably add nutmeg, allspice, etc. next time to get a little more flavor going.

I made some changes which significantly improved the nutritional values of this recipe, and it turned out great! I used sugar twin brown sugar instead of regular, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, only a tiny dash of salt, 3/4th cup of oats instead of a whole cup, used 1/4th cup of dark chocolate chips, and added 1/4th cup of crushed all bran buds. NUTRITIONAL INFO for a 14 muffin yield: 98.9 calories, 111.8 mg sodium, 17 carbs, 2.9g fibre, 6g sugar, 3.2g protein, 1.8g fat, 15mg cholesterol, 20mg potassium.

What a nice surprise!  I've been on Weight Watchers for the past 4 weeks and was hungry for something baked, sweet, filling, and Weight Watchers friendly.  This delicious muffin is just 4 points and my recipe made 18 servings, so given the nutritional information listed with the recipe, I can have 1-1/2 muffins for the 4 points.

I can't believe these are healthy! As another reviewer said, the use of applesauce in this recipe for some reason does not yield a gooey result, the muffins are moist yet fluffy. I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, so I skipped that. I also added wheat germ and ground flax seed for that extra healthy boost.

Sooooo Delicious!  I was very plesently  surprised at the delicious taste  of these muffins!  I used half wheat flour, and raisins instead of choc. chips.  Even my hubby loved them.  They don't look appealing but are very suprisingly good.

I had 3 very ripe bananas I needed to use and this was suggested on the Recipe Exchange.  I made them this morning and they are a HIT!!  I followed the recipe exactly using the mini chocolate chips.  Excellent texture and taste.  I didn't measure the bananas but just use 3 rather samll ones.  Yum.. this is definately a keeper!

These were delicious!  I ripped one apart 5 minutes after I took them out of the tin and was pleasantly surprised at how soft and moist they are, without being gluey.  I did use 1/4c of bran and 3/4c of oats to change it up a bit, and I threw in about 3T of presoaked chia seeds.  The only thing i might change next time is to use 1/2c of brown sugar, I'm not sure they need the whole 3/4c.

I LIKE em! I am watching my calories so I excluded the chocolate chips and nuts (boy they would be SO good in here) and added 1/4 cup of raisins.  I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and thought they were sweet enough.  Great breakfast muffin for just over 100 calories with the modifacations.

Delicious, they were very moist and pretty sweet.  I used half white and half whole wheat flour.  I used half yogurt and half oil instead of using applesauce as I was out of applesauce and only had a bit of yogurt.  I think next time I will only use yogurt (I find that makes baking more moist then applesauce) and maybe try 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make them a bit healthier.

These were okay, but WAAAY too salty.  1 1/4 tsp overpowers this recipe.  I would cut it back to a 1/2 tsp.

We LOVED these! I used whole wheat flour and left out the chocolate chips and nuts, and they were delicious. I started making them without realizing I didn't have any oatmeal, so I added 1/3-1/2 cup more whole wheat flour and they turned out great. The next day I went to the store and bought some oatmeal so I could make them again!

Very moist muffin.  Easy to change up so that your favorite flavors are present.  The banana and chocolate are very good, but I could see substituting pumpkin for the banana and craisins for the chocolate.  I used WW pastry flour and subbed 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed for a portion of the flour.  Will definitely make these again.

These muffins are incredibly delicious and moist!  I substituted the same amount of flour with whole wheat flour and used craisins instead of chocolate chips.

Not sure why I'm the only one who came up with this but I could only taste salt! I questioned 1 1/14 tsp as I was adding it, but went with it anyway because I wanted to follow the recipe exactly.

Not bad -- no oil, so healthier. Used only 1/2 cup brown sugar, raisins rather than choc chips, cut back on salt, due to reviews.

These muffins are so good and moist! I make them according to the instructions except I used whole wheat flour instead of AP. I have figured that four medium sized bananas is about right. You love the chocolate chips in them and have even made a streusel topping (brown sugar, flour, and butter) for a little added zing! Even though I love the chocolate chips, substituting blueberries or even raisins/craisins would be fantastic. Try them, you will not be sorry!

Absolutely a five star recipe.  I substituted 1/2 of the white flour for whole wheat pastry flour, and substituted 1/2 of the oats for wheat germ and flax.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  These are incredibly moist and delicious, and they do not taste low fat at all!

These were delicious! I used whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup oat flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup Splenda & 1/4 cup mini choc chips. I probably used about 2 bananas. A very moist, flavorful muffin. Thanks so much!

A hearty breakfast muffin, really delicious! I made them with oatmeal oats and omitted the nuts. I also would have reduced the salt for my taste. This made 11 tasty and healthy muffins that my whole family liked. Could anyone figure out why they were named Seminary? A great start to any day!

I thought these were really good! I followed the recipe exactly, and wouldn't change anything in the future. Someone had said that they don't rise, but that wasn't the case for me... just for the record. :)

When I initially tried these muffins I wasn't terribly impressed. They aren't amazing right out of the oven, but my family adores them. I like them cold out of the refrigerator. We make them once every other week now.

Fantastic! I was 1/3 cup short on bananas, so I upped my applesauce to 2/3 cup. These came out moist and, as my boyfriend said, tasted like candy! Next time I'll try blueberries instead of the chocolate chips. I've been on a "healthier muffin" baking spree, and these are the best I've made from this website so far.

Um, not a whole lot of taste.  At all.  Disappointed.  Not sure even if it's worth tweaking.  Maybe it's just not what I was looking for.

I made these tonight and both my husband and I really enjoyed them. Such great texture from the oatmeal! I added carob chips instead of chocolate, but since I was worried about them being bitter -- I added some currants, coconut, dried cranberries and substituted toasted slivered almonds for the walnuts.  As another review said, I think you could add just about anything to this recipe and it would be a hit. Thanks for a great recipe!

I wish I could give this 10 stars! To make it even more healthy, I used half regular and half whole wheat flour, half oat bran and half instant oats, and Egg Beaters instead of a real egg. Raisins instead of chocolate chips (but I think I might add some next time - just cause I have to!) and due to allergies, no walnuts. This was easy to prep and we'll have them in the house again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I love these.  Easy to make.  I actually left out the chocolate chips/walnuts since I was out and they still turned out wonderful.  I added some ground flax seed too.  Thanks for sharing.

These are my go to muffins.  I only use 1/2 c brown sugar and I eliminated the salt altogether.  You can use flax eggs instead of the egg.  I use the Ghiradelli 60%cacoa chip-- 2oz only, they turn out perfect every time.

I make these and freeze them in ziploc bags for my boys to nook for breakfast before school. They freeze great. I omit the semi sweet and use white chocolate chips and use dried fruit instead of nuts. This week I used cran strawberries. I also add flax seed. Delish!!

I made a lot of substitutions due to ltd. ingredients where I live and aiming for health, but they turned out tasty :) subbed coconut oil for applesauce, pumpkin seeds and flax for nuts. Added raisins. Used 1/2wholwht flour & 1/2ground flax. Added a tbsp plain yog at the end as the mix looked dry. Took 18 mins in my mystery oven where temps are unknown. Yummy!

Very moist. I will cut back the sugar next time because the bananas really seem to make them sweet. Nice to find such a healthy and tasty breakfast muffin.

Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate chocolate chips in many recipes.  I am just not crazy about putting them in muffins. I used dried cranberries and dried cherries instead of the chocolate chips. Made these as per the recipe except for the chocolate chips.  Very, very good. I think these are a good quick breakfast or with a nice cup of coffee.  Nice tender crumb and sweet taste without being too sweet.

Doubled the recipe right off the bat, so glad I did! Only used 2/3 the amt of choc chips (mini), I think next time I will only use half the amt of choc chips called for and it will be enough. Also will put in some whole wheat flour next time, don't know why I did not this time. Sprinkled some oats on top to make them look pretty. Very good muffin, my kids thought these rocked!

I made these to change up my toddlers usual breakfast of oatmeal at daycare. A few adjustments: 1/2 c flour and 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 1 c blueberries instead of chocolate chips and walnuts. Very moist and flavorful! Very fast to make too!

The day I baked these, my rating would have been 3 stars. The muffins had good flavor, but had that typical applesauce-low fat rubbery texture. My changes were 2X the cinnamon, adding 4 Tbsp ground flax seed, only 1/2 tsp salt, and cranberries instead of chocolate chips. However, I put the muffins in a tightly-sealed container, and WOW, the next couple of days, the muffins became WAY better in taste and texture. Nice and moist, with no rubbery texture. Worth waiting for!

I made them just as the recipe called for (minus the nuts because we were out and using oat bran instead of oatmeal like the author suggested), and they were fantastic! Flavorful, moist, and delicious!  Sometimes I think applesauce (rather than oil) changes the texture and overall taste, but not with these.

Way too salty. I used one teaspoon (the recipe calls for even more -- 1 and 1/4) and as I bit into the first muffin -- whoa!!! -- talk about a salt hit. The texture was good, the other flavours were nice, but if I make again, I will cut the salt down to about 1/2 tsp.

I made these muffins earlier today and they are absolutely delicious. I used unbleached flour and omitted the nuts and chocolate chips. Instead of making large muffins, I made mini muffins (36 total). 4 medium sized bananas are perfect when making mini muffins. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I can't wait to make these for my grandsons.

Oh my word!!!! These are AWESOME!!!!  Now the true test: My finicky kids. Drum roll please....they actually like them!!!!  My 9-year-old gave them a 9! THANK YOU!!!!  I added a little flax meal too.  And I think next time I might decrease the sugar just a bit...the chocolate chips are really sweet.  I used "Private Selection" brand semi-sweets, which I think are my new favorite chip!  They are a little bigger than the usual ones.

Decent Muffin, I decided to use fruit jam instead of applesauce. 3 Bananas ripened and black in freezer. and added 2 TBLSP Oil. They are very good and moist

They were so delicious, my husband loved them and he does not tend to like 'healthy' foods. I substituted some of  the sugar for honey and maple syrup (1/4c brown sugar, 1/4c honey and 1/4c maple syrup), I also omitted the nuts and choc chips. It tasted so good. I Will make these again.

What a fabulous recipe!  They're so tasty, I can't stay out of them ... which kind of defeats the purpose of making a healthier muffin!  ;)  The only change I made was to add a small splash of olive oil.  I also used 3 large bananas - probably more than recipe called for, but you could really taste the banana in every muffin ... delish!!

My muffins went from "hearty" the morning after I baked them, to "tough and chewy" two days later.  they also stuck to the muffin papers.  I'll give them another shot, because the flavor was good, but maybe I'll us half apple sauce half butter or oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are always a huge hit. They're a little bit rubbery after all (with the applesauce) but they're still very delicious and they have enough substance to them that even my boyfriend (who hates sweets) really enjoys them.

These are DELICIOUS, even when compared to some of those fat-laden, calorie-laden muffin recipes! I use egg substitute and whole wheat "white" flour - I added a teaspoon of vital wheat gluten, too.  Didn't measure but used two medium bananas.  Light, moist, flavorful and not one hint of that rubbery taste/texture you sometimes get when you make a healthy quick bread or muffin.  Thanks so much, Christa! Not only am I saving this, I'm also saving this to my "Favorites" folder! :)

Tasty! My kids loved them. I used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose, plus the quick oats. Only 1/2 cup brown sugar, and about 1/2 teas salt. No choco-chips. These muffins are delicious, and the nuts add a nice texture. I used Trader Joes roasted chopped pecans. I suspect you could use a bit more banana instead of applesauce. Seems silly to open a jar of applesauce for 1/3 cup. You need about two bananas for this recipe. I put the bananas, sugar and eggs in the blender, because I don't like to find mushy banana bits. Then added it to the dry ingredients in a bowl.

I had some bananas and applesauce to use up so I wasn't expecting anything great, but this is FANTASTIC recipe!!  Very moist and the chocolate chips give it just enough sweetness.  I will definetly be making these again.  Thank you!!

These were so delicious - especially warm out of the oven.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and canola oil instead of applesauce. They brown up so nicely.  I was looking for one that didn't look so good for my taste test and they all looked wonderful!

Very good! I first thought it seemed like their wasn't going to be enough liquid in the recipe. I'm glad I didn't tweak that. The batter was very thick, but the muffins were perfect, not dry at all. They had a great texture. I actually did a couple of tweaks; I used whole wheat instead of white flour, added raisins and extra cinnamon. Healthy and delicious!

I use whole wheat flour rather than all purpose and eliminate the salt. I tried with salt the first time I made these and I don't think it's needed. I also reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. For a healthier "breakfast muffin" I eliminate the chocolate chips and at the end once everything is mixed together I add in approximately 1 cup of frozen wild blueberries (or however much your heart desires!). They add some moisture to the muffins and they're delicious! Not to mention that we always have frozen fruit on hand anyway since our kids love to have it in oatmeal, smoothies, etc. I love the taste and that they're a fairly healthy option. I don't feel guilty giving one to my 3 year old occasionally when we need to have breakfast on the go before work/daycare!

These are great. I followed the recipe as is then added 1/2 cup of chopped dates as well and topped with a sprinkle of oats and brown sugar. The texture is lovely, light and moist. I was afraid they'd be too sweet for my taste (I made them for my husband though and he likes more sweetness)but I really liked them. You could sub in any fruit etc. and use up those over-ripe bananas, which I keep in the freezer until I'm ready to use them.

Used the recipe exactly as written but heeded the advice of Sarah Jo, using only 1/2 the required oats. THEY WERE SCRUMPTIOUS! Perfect consistency and SO MOIST! I considered using dried fruit instead of chocolate chips, but had none on hand, the chocolate made the mini-loaves, sinfully indulgent. I will not only make them again, I'll try different variations because they've been greatly enjoyed! No-one believes the recipe is completely void of oil and butter. Thanks Christa!

Super yummy! First time I made them I omitted the chocolate chips. Have a batch in the oven now with chocolate chips, but no applesauce (I was out). I'm sure they'll be just as yummy as the first batch I had made! Great recipe!

I made these to bring to my daughter's daycare so I used raisins (instead of the nuts and chocolate chips) and reduced the sugar a little.  They were easy to make and very tasty.  Since we always have applesauce in the fridge and a couple of bananas going too ripe, I think I will be making these again and again...

This was pretty easy and tasted really good!  I will do fewer (or none) chocolate chips next time--it made it too sweet in my opinion for a breakfast food.

Really good!! I used half whole wheat and half white. I used 3 bananas and only about 1/2 cup oats. I also added a tablespoon of wheat germ. I used about a 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Didn't have any nuts. I got 20 muffins! Delicious.

Like many reviewers, I used raisins rather than chocolate chips. I also used half wheat flour and half white. They came out great, maybe on the sweet side, but they are really great. I love the banana flavor and the heartiness of the oats.

Delicious!! Looking for differnt muffin recipes because I'm trying to have muffins on hand for quick and easy breakfast on the go. This definitely will be in my rotation. I made the recipe almost exactly as written, with the exception of leaving out the nuts. I made half without chocolate chips, and both versions were very good.

I think some of the other reviewers said this would be easily adapted to different flavors, and I would have to agree.

Excellent muffins. I tried to follow the recipe exactlly but din't have enough bananas when I doubled the recipe. I also roasted the walnut before adding to the mix. i feel that roasting the nuts adds to the flavor. Next time I think I may add raisins to the muffins. 
It is a definate keeper.

Absolutely loved these!  I left out the nuts and compensated with extra chocolate chips (to appease my 3yr old - who also loved these) otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Soft, banana-y, great texture bc of the oatmeal, with awesome bursts of chocolate. They are a bit sticky on day 2 bc of the banana and applesauce combo, but if you often sub applesauce for oil in recipes, you'll already expect that.  Great heated up with a cup of coffee! Will be in my regular "have bananas to use up" rotation :)

Just made these on a cold Colorado morning. Oh the smell coming from the kitchen! I have a few favorite no-shortening-added muffin recipes and this one is a keeper. My personal tips: it's a little too sweet for me, with the sweetness of the bananas & applesauce I would cut back on the sugar to maybe 1/2 cup next time. And I thought the amount of salt this recipe calls for was WAY too much, I only put in 1/4 tsp. I used whole oats instead of processed quick oats, and I used the full amount called for in the recipe (one reviewer said to cut back to half but the batter would have been too thin). I used dried blueberries instead of choc. chips and added a little coconut. For the last 2 add-ins you can use whatever you like, I used almonds for nuts. The rest I made as-written and like these muffins very much.

It used wholewheat flour and put more bananas than this recipe called for (used 3 VERY ripe bananas), and put less sugar. Came out more cakey (because of extra bananas), but still delicious. Omitted walnuts since I was in rush to make these, next time I will add walnuts or pecans (easier to crush). Nice basic muffin. Will make them again.

I was really excited to see these muffins, especially without the added fat, but they were a disappointment.  We threw away some of ours and there are 6 of us!

I have made them twice now, following the recipe as written except I only sprinkle on a few chocolate chips on top which ended up being only 1/4 cup. Just enough to satisfy the chocolate cravings. Would also be good with dried cranberries or blueberries. I had  little too much batter for 12 and ended up with 2 extra in custard cups. Next time I will reduce the sugar and salt and try whole wheat to improve the nutritional content a little.

I substituted Splenda for Baking for the brown sugar, used half the oatmeal to balance out the moisture, half the nuts, and no chocolate chips. They turned out fine! There's too much salt though. 1 1/4 tsp?? I've never used that much in muffins! I used only 1 tsp and they still turned out a bit salty. When I make them again I'll cut the salt in half. Maybe by then I'll have lost ten pounds and I can put in the chocolate chips :-).

These muffins are great.  I would have given them a 4, but because they taste so good AND their healthy AND because my kids liked them so much, I gave them a 5.  
I did not have a banana.  I added a whole snack size container of all natural apple sauce (4oz).  I did add like 2 TBSP of sour cream I had in the fridge.  I grounded up the oatmeal just a little in the food processor because my son is a little turned off by oatmeal and eliminated the walnuts(but even he ate these right up!) I also cut back on the salt to 3/4 tsp.  
Thanks Christa!

I followed the lead of others, and replaced the chocolate with frozen blueberries.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  Big hit with the teenage boys, who didn't know these were "healthy" muffins!

These came out perfectly.  They rose nicely, and the texture was very even.  I omitted the chocolate chips and doubled the amount of walnuts, which worked very well.  The vanilla extract isn't necessary.

I've read several comments about trying to make things healthier by getting rid of the nuts and the chocolate chips.  If you're looking for a healthy recipe, these muffins aren't bad for you, but muffins are nowhere near the top of the list of healthy breakfast foods.

I followed the receipe except used large muffin tins so I made 6 large muffins.  My husband loves chocolate so these were a big hit.  The only thing is I would recommend to cut the salt way down.  Too much salt.  Also, next time, I think I will try with dried cranberries instead of chocolate.  Great muffins though!!!

Thank you, Christa Adams!!! These are the best muffins I have ever made, and I strongly suggest these muffins to everyone!(except if your allergic to walnuts of chocolate, haha!) Still, there is a little too much chocolate in there for my parents... Maybe more like a 1/3 cup? there is so much flavor, but not  too much. Maybe some orange zest would be good in there, too.

This is a really good recipe for a nice healthy breakfast muffin. I made 6.5 Jumbo muffins from this recipe and made half with chocolate chunks and half with Crasins and almonds. I accidentally added a bit too much apple sauce and added a bit of whole wheat flour to compensate and they came out a bit denser than I think they would have otherwise but still very good.

Substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and strawberry puree for the applesauce. Also added some extra banana. Delicious! They don't taste low-fat even though they are.

Very good! We liked the combo of banana, chocolate chips, and oatmeal. The only thing I would say is to divide the mixture into 13 or 14 muffins just so they aren't so large and stay a little mushy in the middle. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks

Obviously you could always add more chocolate chips! :) You can't go wrong with this recipe. I'll be making this again. Perfect grab & go breakfast.

For low-fat muffins, these are wonderful! My sister and I are on a diet and love these muffins!  We substitute Splenda brown sugar for the "real" brown sugar to cut the calories even more. Use the "mini" chocolate chips so that they distribute completely throughout the muffin and you think you're sinfully indulging when you're really not!

Very good!  I substituted Oat bran for the Oatmeal and blueberries for the chocolate chips.  Because I was making it for my son's school, I omitted the nuts in case of allergies.  Also, I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.

Perfect for what I was wanting to make. A lower fat, healthier, moist, and dense muffin to go with coffee for a quick breakfast. I use dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips. Otherwise made as stated. Will make these again!

The only changes I made was to substitute dried cranberries for the chocolate chips, used 'old fashion' oats, and added a little more cinnamon, some ground ginger, and ground gloves... As I am writing this, I am eating my 4th (!) muffin. Never happened before!  Yep, they are THAT good...!

There's a whole lot of flavours going on in this muffin. I would leave out the cinammon if using chocolate chips or substitute raisins or datess if using the cinammon. I like the banana/choc chip taste. Very moist, but didnt rise alot. Will make again for sure.

I really like the base recipe!  But, like others, I did change it for my tastes.  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup molasses and added blueberries instead of choc. chips.  Also added 1/2 cup of wheat bran and used reg. oats which didn't seem to make a difference.

Tried these yesterday as I was looking for a quick recipe to use up bananas and applesauce.  Only made a couple of changes:  used 1/2 C. white flour and 1/2 C. whole wheat flour, left out the chocolate chips  ( I LOVE chocolate but hubby's tummy doesn't handle it well), and increased the nuts to 1 C.

Everyone said they were very good - very moist (not gummy) and tasty.  I needed the full 20 minutes baking time.  I will be making these again.

I just made these and they got rave reviews. I used the mini chocolate chips which was fitting since I used 'mini' muffin tins. One question - why on earth would you put salt in this? Some people mentioned the salt - I've been baking for years and just routinely drop the salt in cooky and muffin recipes. try it!

These muffins are terrific!  They are very moist and tender.  I made a few alterations.  I ommited the nuts, and used mini chocolate chips instead.  I made mini muffins, which took about 13 minutes to bake at 350. The mini chocolate chips make every bite chocolatey..which is awesome! I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and splenda brown sugar blend.  I will definately make these again!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These were awesome!  I was looking for a banana muffin recipe that was a little different and after reading the reviews for these, I knew I had to try them.  I did change one thing though because I had no chocolate chips.  I used butterscotch chips and they were so good!!!  Think oatmeal scotchies the cookie but in muffin form!

These were gone before I could even get a picture of them.. I left out the chocolate chips and walnuts and used half whole wheat, half white flour. They were delicious- the oats provided a great texture and the flavour was awesome. I will definitely be making these again.

These are good, hearty muffins. I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the walnuts and added some extra chocolate chips. If I made them again, I would decrease the amount of salt to either 1/2 tsp or 1 tsp, because they turned out too salty for my tastes.
Great find!

I love these muffins, my husband has 2 every morning for breakfast.  I think they are hearty and healthy. I cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 cup and just 1/4 cup of mini choc. chips (they seem to go farther).  I also use wheat flour and add about 1/4 cup bran.

These were ok but had a 'rubbery' texture- you could definately tell that they were on the 'light' side but I did enjoy the addition of the oats.  I omitted the nuts.

So easy, tastes fabulous! I ran out of banana (only had two, probably should have used three), so substituted with more apple-sauce. Worked just fine. Thanks for this great semi-healthy recipe!

These muffins were really good.  A lot more substance than you would expect from a muffin, but still tasty.  The oatmeal gives it a different texture, but they feel weightier and you're definitely getting something with more nutrition than regular muffins.  I'll definitely make again.  Thanks!

These were just okay.  Maybe I did something wrong, but they just had a kind of funny taste to them.  Even with the chocolate chips, there was just something missing.  The boy eats everything - he brought 2 to work yesterday before he tried them... today he only brought 1.  Thanks for the receipe, but I'll keep looking.

These muffins were delicious and rose well.  For 12 servings, I used about 2 1/3 bananas to make 1 1/3 cups mashed banana.  I also decreased the salt to 1 tsp. instead of 1 1/4 tsp. and omitted the walnuts.

Wonderful!  I used 1/8 cup brown sugar and 1/8 cup splenda, whole wheat flour, and sugar free chocolate chips.  I baked two batches at once, after 10 minutes I switched the pans (side to side) and continued baking another 11 minutes....perfect!  Also, I used muffin papers and found that spraying them lightly with cooking spray prevents the muffins from sticking to them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  The muffins turn out so moist.  I use much less sugar than stated, only maybe 1-2 T's.  I have made these with the chocolate chips, and also with blueberries in place of chocolate, and they are great too.

These muffins were really good. I left out the walnuts since I don't like them in my muffins, and they still turned out great. I really liked the flavor of them, and the different texture. It was something you don't expect from a muffin. I'll be making these again.

Delicious! I skipped the chocolate chips and added more walnuts. I also used white whole wheat flour (King Arthur). I made mini muffins, bake time15 mins in my oven which runs a few degrees low. Perfect bite sized breakfast on the go, thanks for the recipe!

These are very good moist muffins. I didn’t use chocolate chips because I didn’t have any and I made these into mini muffins. I like them small because for a snack I don’t need more than 2 which would probably be like 1/2 a muffin.

Really good muffins. I didn't have the nuts so I doubled the chocolate chips. They turned out to be so good. So far the best muffins I have made. Definitely saving this recipe to make again.

Yum! Followed as written except used whole wheat flour, subbed 1/3 c unsweetened coconut flakes for the nuts, used 1 whole snack sized container of unsweetened applesauce, and 2 medium sized bananas (didn't feel like measuring mashed bananas) and 1/2 t salt.  So good! A tad on the sweet size for my taste. Might try 2/3 c brown sugar next time.

I did not use the chocolate chips since I do not like cc with my banana bread.  I subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the white flour.  I did not have any oatmeal, but did have the oat bran.  Not sure if I should have used the full amount though. 
 The muffins tasted okay, but probably would have been better with the oatmeal instead.

This recipe was very forgiving, as I had to make several changes because my husband and I have both had gastric surgery. I try to cut back on the sugars and wheat flours and add extra proteins. In this recipe I used 6 tbs Splenda brown sugar substitute (1/2 recipe amount); 1/4 c white flour, 1/4 c coconut flour, and 1/2 c almond flour (to equal the 1 c flour the recipe calls for). I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. and used regular oatmeal. I did not have quite enough bananas so I added a little bit of banana flavoring and used light sour cream to make up the difference in volume. For my add-ins I used 1 cup each of unsweetened coconut, pecans, and pepitas. (I did not use chocolate chips.) My large muffins took 28 min. to bake and tasted absolutely fabulous! I will certainly want to make these muffins again!

These are fabulous. I think I'd cut back to 1/2 a cup of brown sugar next time as we don't like things that sweet. I left out the chocolate chips and used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. I also used non quick-cooking oats as that is all I had on hand.

So moist and yummy. This one's a keeper!

UPDATE....I ate another muffin today and the salt was really TOO much.  Decreasing the salt I think is a must.

I made these today, and the aroma filled my kitchen.  They were moist and tasty.  I will definitely again BUT I will cut the salt in half.  It overpowered too much of the taste for me. 

Tip: Three large or four medium bananas equal about 1 1/3 cup.  Old fashioned oats work too.

I absolutely loved these. I added a bit more dark chocolate morsels and walnuts and also I used a can of fried apples that I chopped up a bit. Added a tiny more cinnamon and they were AWESOME. Thanks so much , I was looking for such a recipe and this filled the bill. Excellent for a breakfast or lunch pick me up..????

Added apple chunks,  swapped out chocolate chips for raisins, and kept the walnuts.  Used 3 medium overripe bananas.  Never missed the oil, very moist and delicious!  Sprayed the muffin tin with cooking spray and they popped out beautifully.

Made these this morning.  I didn't have applesauce so just added a little extra banana - delicious!!  Also had some extra batter so I made a dozen mini muffins too - baked them for about 5 minutes less time than the larger ones.

I didn't have enough Banana....only 1/2 cup, so I doubled the applesauce and adder 1/4 cup of  orange juice. I dint have any oats, so I added 3 packages of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal. I didn't have chocolate chips, so I left them out! The muffins were fabulous!!! So it's safe to say, if I stuck with the regular recipe they would have been fabulous too! Also, I baked them for 21 minutes!

Loved these!  Based on other reviews, I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup (plenty sweet); used white whole wheat flour; subbed 1/4 cup of flax meal for some of the oatmeal; subbed fresh blueberries for the choc chips and left out the nuts because I didn't have any.  Plugged it into my Weight Watchers smart points recipe creator and came out to 2 points per muffin!  Outstanding!

I loved these. I'm sure the recipe is delicious as is but I tried to make it a little more healthy (watching the Cholesterol). I used Egg Beaters instead of an egg, used 100% whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Substituted raisins for chocolate chips. Great recipe!!

I made these into 6 jumbo muffins, and they were ready in about 18 min. I also halved the oatmeal, as mentioned by a reviewer. I got by fine with that, and the texture was still dense. That was a good call; I don't think I'd like it with the full amount. I also used pecans and put aside a few tblsps that I topped the muffins with, along with some turbinado sugar. This would work well with raisins in place of the choc chips, too. Nice recipe.

I rated the recipe as it is stated. I made a batch using 1 1/2 tsps of salt....TOO MUCH SALT. I made another batch using 1/2 tsp. salt...much better. Whoever submitted this recipe might have made a mistake with the salt quantity.  Salty banana nut muffins are not tasteful at all.

The amount of salt in this recipe is ridiculous. I thought it seemed like a lot, so cut it back to 1 teaspoon, and they are still so salty that my kids (who normally LOVE banana muffins) couldn't even finish one.

I have made these a few times and the whole family loves them!  I substitute a flax egg for the egg and all spice for the cinnamon due to allergies, and I use Namaste gluten free flour.  I've made jumbo muffins, standard muffins, and mini muffins, they always turn out great!

Great recipe. They come out moist every time. Also freeze well.  I have used regular applesauce or a mix like blueberry applesauce. Always good.

These are great for breakfast.  I used Scottish oatmeal as store was out of oat bran.   Replaced chocolate chips with peanut butter chips and switched nuts to raisins.  Great quick brekkie for my daughter !

Hard to believe these have no added fat.  Very delicious. I took the advice of one reviewer and added the Oatmeal to the wet ingredients and let sit for 5 min before combining all.  Also, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  The chocolate chips are a hit with my kids.  I think I will make them with just chopped walnuts for the grown ups.  Either way, this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

These are yummy!  I really like the banana flavor combined with the chocolate and walnuts.  I made a few changes to the original recipe, though.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and they were still plenty sweet for our tastes.  I also used white while wheat flour in place of 1/2 cup of the flour.

I'll definitely be making these again. I added a bit of ground flax seed and some brewers yeast for some extra nutritional value and it didn't change the flavor of the muffins at all.

Awesome, quick and easy. Really delicious. I did not have walnuts, chocolate chips, or ripe bananas so I substituted a half cup of sour cream for the banana and used blueberries instead of chips and nuts. Next time I want to try using pineapple instead of blueberries. Great basic recipe

The only change I made was cutting sugar from 3/4 to 1/2.   Gotta cut it  out where I can and with the chocolate  chips, I found them perfect.  Great recipe!

Came out so good! Instead of a cup of flour I used half a cup of flour and half a cup of flaxseed meal. These muffins were so moist and delicious! Already making a second batch because they did not last long!

These muffins are delicious and easy!  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, used 3 small sized bananas, added a mix of dried fruits and coconut, and increased the walnuts to 3/4 cup.  I think you could play with adding fruits or other nuts and not go wrong.  The sweetness was enough, but not overpowering.  Next time I will reduce the oats to 1/2 or 3/4 cup, as other reviewers did, and pulse the oats in the food processor first because the texture is a little rough.

Fantastic! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and a bit more applesauce to make sure they were moist. Also added a bit of cayenne pepper and allspice, and used mini chocolate chips. My one complaint is they are a bit too salty. 1 1/4 tsp is a lot of salt!

Wonderful recipe! I made mini muffins with it. I changed the recipe only slightly: I left out the walnuts, did not pack the brown sugar (they were plenty sweet anyway) and I reduced the oats to 3/4 cup. They are very moist and delicious.

These are really awesome. I love that there is no oil in this recipe. The only drawback I found was that if you use paper cupcake liners they really stick to the paper. That's likely due to no oil. These really are delicious.

Everyone ate these, even my two boys who shy away from anything with nutritional value. They all called it a "keeper." Followed  the recipe exactly but omitted the walnuts and for the applesauce used a lunchbox serving size of Mott's natural.

These were very good. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. I also omitted the nuts because I'm recovering from a wisdom tooth extraction. These retained their moisture for days and will be a new staple in my house. Needed something easy to grab on those rushed mornings other than cereal bars. Love these!

Very delicious muffins. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, and peanut butter chips since I had them on hand. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Definitely sweet enough. I substituted raisins for the nuts, since my grand daughter isn't into nuts right now. They are moist, healthy, perfect for the last min dash to school or dance class without getting crumbs all over my car!

Did not really change anything except I used darker brown sugar (just to make them darker) and after filling the muffin pan I added a few chocolate chips and oats to the top for aesthetic purposes.

Delicious, nutritious and popular with the whole family.  I added a little wheat germ and macadamia nut bits in as well and it tasted even nuttier!  Mini muffins were perfect snacking size all day long . . .

I have made these muffins regularly for several years. They are delicious as-is, but it is also a flexible recipe. You and add and substitute very easily. I've subbed coconut oil for the apple sauce (we aren't going for low-fat and rarely have apple sauce in hand), I've added chia seeds, flax, while wheat flour, hemp hearts...you name it, and they still turn out great and are packed nutrition. But the basic recipe is great as it is as well. Thank you for the great recipe!

These muffins are excellent! Moist and flavourful. They only made 12 muffins though (in medium sized baking cups) so I would double the recipe. I didn't put in any chocolate chips because I wanted them to be a bit healthier!

I made this low fat using only 1/3 the sugar, flame raisins instead of choc chips, wheat flour instead of white, added flax seed meal.  I ground the oatmeal very fine and omitted the nuts and added more cinnamon.  Very moist and tasty.

I will make these again! I did make a few changes based on the suggestions of others, so I can't give it a full 5 stars. I used pecans instead of walnuts and substituted butter instead of applesauce (I'm sure butter makes the recipe less healthy, but with so many complaints about texture, it seemed worth it). I also added white chocolate chips to the recipe. I totally recommend this addition to everyone. The white chocolate works with the flavors of the muffin so much better than milk or semi-sweet chocolate.

I made this recipe and all I did was cut back the sugar to 1/2 a cup, used 2 bananas and excluded the nuts.
I love the mini muffins - it makes 48 of them at only 43 calories each!

I only made a few changes.  I didn't have any applesauce so I used apple butter, I used 4 bananas because I had 4 turning black (3 would have been enough),I was low on brown sugar so I used 1/4c. brown sugar and 1/2c. white sugar, and lastly I used 1/2c. white flour and 1/2c. whole wheat flour.  I wouldn't exactly call these "healthy" but they sure are yummy :)  I probably could have used less sugar, especially since I used apple butter...next time I will only use 1/2c. of sugar.  I made a mix of oatmeal, shredded coconut, and chopped walnuts, and sprinkled it (sparingly) over the tops of the muffins before I baked them.  Really nice recipe, I'll make this one again!   Yielded 16 regular sized muffins for me.

The first time I made these, I did as is. They were delicious! I wasn't the biggest fan of the chocolate chips (I know, who doesn't like chocolate for breakfast) so the second time I doubled the nuts and left them out. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flower. Again delicious!

Delicious, moist, textured, lightly spicy. Absolutely love these muffins, as did the many people I shared them with. Accidentally added a small amount of olive oil to the batter before baking but this seems to only have enhanced the texture... slightly sticky... if making them a little less healthy. I say, Oh well! They're fantastic. I'll be making them again.

This recipe is wonderful! I made some change. I used organic whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, added some organic wheat bran, oat bran, crushed flax seeds, sunflower seeds, reduced the amount of chocolate, and used dark chocolate instead. I also increased the dose of cinnamon and reduced sugar and used Stevia instead. For applesauce, I used Sarah's applesauce recipe with honey and a bit of muscovado sugar instead of white sugar. It turned out great, healthy taste. I wish that I measured ingredients I added!

Tried these because of the many positive reviews, but I felt they were just "so-so". The strongest flavor was the banana... so it seemed kind of like a banana-oatmeal muffin. They weren't awful, but not terrific either. On the positive side, they had a good, solid texture (which I like my muffins to have) and are very low in fat. However, I probably won't be making them again.

Great moist muffin recipe!  I didn't have any quick oats, so I substituted 3 packs of cinnamon apple instant oatmeal and then reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 c. and the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. It was still very sweet bc of the sweetened instant oatmeal, so I'm thinking I may reduce it to 1/4 c or take the sugar out all together. I used raisins instead of the choc chips.  The recipe ended up making 20 muffins.  My teenage boys ate them all up by end of day!

This is a great muffin recipe.  I wanted mini muffins so I added 3/4 mini chips instead of regular and also cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, added 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 nutmeg. Delicious and moist!

I used whole wheat pastry flour, cut the brown sugar in half, used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and added nutmeg, allspice, and ground ginger instead of just cinnamon. Oh my goodness... best muffin ever!  (as far as healthy-ish muffins go anyway.  I could very easily eat way too many of these.  Of of my favorite things to bake now!

These muffins are so delicious. I am a picky eater and have been looking for a alternative to boaring oatmeal for breakfast that I can eat at work. I tried this recipe out to a resounding success throughout the whole family. Adding the choc chips definitely makes them better, but they would be good without. The best thing about these muffins are that they stay moist all week. We store them in a cupcake carrier in the pantry for easy distribution. Will be making a double batch this weekend, so all of us will have enough to get through the week.

1.	I used old-fashioned oats since that was what I had on hand.  I pulsed them in the blender to turn it into coarse flour since I didn’t want the mini-muffins to be overpowered with a chalky mouthfeel.  
2.	Also, since I made mini-muffins, I just watched the time and used the toothpick method to see when they were done.  Making them smaller probably shaved off 5-ish minutes.

I used wheat bran instead of oatmeal. They came out moist and yummy. The banana adds a nice fruity flavor and the cinnamon adds just enough spice. Will definitely make again!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was using pecans instead of walnuts, due to a serious allergy, and I used whole wheat flour. It was my first time using whole wheat flour so I dont know if it changes the texture. The flavor was awesome, I just found them a little heavy...I must be doing something wrong. I will make them again though. For all of you who said they were amazing, did you mix the first bunch of ingredients with a mixer? I did not, but mabye i shoudl have. Any comments or tips welcome!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some ripe bananas, the last of the oatmeal, and the little bit of chocolate chips I had sitting in the pantry.  These muffins delivered, and then some.   This is my new favorite muffin.

I absolutely loved these!

I used an individual serving size cup of applesauce, 2 mashed bananas, no walnuts but 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I just came back on here to get the recipe again, as I'm making them again tomorrow morning for our breakfast!!

Definately a keeper, will make these again & again!  Thank you for something SO yummy & healthy!!

Love these muffins.  I use raisens or chopped dates instead of chocolate chips.  Be careful not to overcook - they may not look "done" like other muffins, but I've learned to take them out anyway when the recmmended time is up.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and homemade applebutter instead of the applesauce. 

So very good. Our daughter loves taking these to daycare to share with her friends. (been doing it since she was 1) 
We leave out the nuts when taking to school due to allergies.

I just made these and they turned out great. I used whole wheat flour and I omitted the chocolate chips and nuts. Now I wished I had not made banana bread with the rest of the nanners because these muffins are a hit in my household.

Made these for a friend.  the only change I made was to use blueberries instead of chocolate chips.  They were good - but not great.  They were gummy, the way that baked goods are when you substitute apple sauce for oil.  I won't make them again.

These are pretty good. I forgot to put cinnamon in but it was still tasty. I didn't follow the instructions very well and didn't fix the flour mixture ahead of time. I basically just dumped everything in and mixed the batter up. The muffins barely rose at all and I am not sure if that's because the baking soda and baking powder were activated too early. Next time I'll do exactly as the recipe says and see if the muffins rise better.

Delicious! I was surprised how moist these are. I followed the recipe as written except I accidentally omitted the salt. Based on my result I don't think it is even necessary. I think it would be very easy to replace the chocolate chips with other items such as raisins, cranberries or even blueberries. I will definitely make these again.

I can't speak for following the recipe exactly, as I didn't, but I added 1/8 cup cocoa, doubled the banana and chocolate chips, dropped the applesauce as I'm not confident baking with it, and they turned out really good.  They are nice and moist.  (I freeze my bananas and defrost in the microwave to get extra moist banana.)

This recipe was ok. I followed as directed with the except of eliminating the chips and walnuts, and it was just too bland for me. This kids kinda liked it but not really.

Very moist for muffin without oil or butter.  Taste great and really low fat!  Next time I will make them with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.

I thought that for healthy muffins, these were good.  But then my husband took them to work, and everyone wants the recipe.  And people there don't normally care for the healthy stuff, so it speaks volumes.  I increased the applesauce to 1/2 c and the banana to 2 c with no ill effects...I imagine if anything, it made it more moist.  I did add the walnuts, but did not include the choco chips, since I really do want them to be healthy.  I also decreased the brown sugar, b/c I knew that I wanted to use maple and brown sugar oatmeal packs (2, less sugar).  Thank you for an excellent and healthy recipe.

These are really good! They are very moist and tasty! Some of the other reviews have said that they taste "healthy" or "bland", but these taste great. I did remove the chocolate chips and walnuts and added one cup blueberries instead.

Amazing!  Amazing!  Amazing!  Really loved these and loved how healthy they were too!  Plus, it's a bonus when the kid love it too which they did!  I only used 1/2c brown sugar and omitted the walnuts and added 1tbsp ground flaxseed.  Oh, and I only had old fashioned oats so I ground up 1/2c first and1/2c regular.  These were hearty without being chewy.  I really was so happy with these muffins!  Thanks for submitting the recipe!

These were delicious though a bit too sweet, even for this sweet tooth.  I used blueberries instead of chocolate chips.  Next time I will reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.

Delicious, I substituted 1/2 cup pumpkin puree for the applesauce and dried cranberries for the chocolate chips/walnuts.  They came out great!  Very moist and good flavor.  The pumpkin made them a pretty color, but I don't think it really changed the taste much. 3 year old grandson loved them (but spit out the cranberries).

Yum!  My 3 little kids loved these - we made 12 yesterday morning, and there are now ZERO left!  I left out the chocolate chips and nuts, added about a cup of raisins instead.  I look forward to trying other additions in the future - flax meal, wheat flour, cranberries, even the chocolate chips - but I am not a great cook, so wanted to (mostly) follow the recipe as-is for my first time.  These will make a GREAT (can't even tell they are so healthy!) "treat" to bring for snack at my kids' preschool!! I just used a nonstick muffin pan sprayed with Pam, no paper liners, and found them not too hard to get out of the pan.  For those who had problems with the paper liners and don't want "naked" muffins, perhaps use only the foil part of the liner, and give it a little spray or buttering before putting the batter in.  Yum yum yum!!!

Yum!  I've made these twice in 3 days... my family LOVES them!  I omitted the walnuts (didn't have any) and use whole wheat white flour.  The second time around I used pureed bananas that I had frozen (because I didn't have any fresh) and they turned out delicious!  This is definitely a keeper recipe in my house!!

I make muffins every Sunday to snack on during the week.  These are part of my weekly rotation.  I love the fact that they don't call for any oil or butter and they still stay moist and have great flavor!

These muffins are very good. We used crazins, dried blueberries and chocolate chips. Some of the best muffins I have ever had. The best part other than the taste was the moistness of the muffin. Try them, you will love them.

A winner in my book for sure. Subbed raisins for the chocolate chips and I had no eggs so used egg beaters with good results. These are really, really good. Thank you! Next time I might try with half whole wheat flour as well.

these muffins are close to perfect! I only used 1/2 cup br sugar because my bananas were super overripe. Instead of quick oats I used old fashioned, but I grinded up 1/2 cup to lighten them up. Added 1/3 cup flax & used whole wheat pastry flour. I added choc chipos to 1/2 the batter for my son. I will definitely make these again!

Fantastic!  My husband and I agreed these are our favorite muffins yet. We left out the nuts, out of necessity, but otherwise left the recipe unchanged. Texture and flavor were spot-on. Will make this again and again and again!

These muffins were fantastic.  I cut back on the salt, only used 1 tsp and next time I make them I'll probably use less than that.  But otherwise, I didn't change anything.  They were easy to make, healthy, and filling.  Definitely going to be making these often!

These muffins are wonderfully moist and flavourful!  However, a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll probably cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup. I also used raisins instead of chocolate chips only because I had them on hand.

Yum!! I exchanged the chocolate chips for raisins and everyone in the family enjoyed them. They stayed moist and kept well in the freezer, though they didn't last long there. I'll have to make another batch soon.

These are my daughter's absolute FAVORITES!!! I have never changed any ingredients and she loves them so much she can barely wait for me to get them out of the pan - she would almost be willing to burn herself for these! I have a cute heart shaped muffin pan and they turn out looking and smelling and tasting WONDERFUL!

Very good.  I used WAY more bananas than it called for, which made them kind of mushy, but still very good.  I used raisins rather than chocolate chips, and ran out of brown sugar, so I only used about 2T of brown sugar, and about 1/4 c honey.  Also, I used wheat flour rather than regular.

I had to cook them 23minutes to get them browned at the top, and definitely worth the wait.    Also tried w blueberries and with sliced almonds--all variations have worked!  Also agave nectar substitute for brown sugar came out w/ similar results after halfing the applesauce.  No one believes they don't have butter.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Very moist with great flavor!  I left out the chocolate chips and nuts to make them a little lighter and used whole wheat flour and they turned out great - I probably could have cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup too...they were plenty sweet.

My son always wants to buy bananas, but doesn't always eat them. This is my favorite way to use our extra-ripe bananas. I use paper muffin liners and a #20 scoop to fill them. The recipe makes 18 this way and not 12. It's a better size muffin for us with kids and calorie counters. :)

Very easy to make and very moist.  I made these for my young daughter so I left out the nuts and chocolate.  She loved them.  I thought they were pretty good, especially for a 'healthier' muffin.  I have made this twice now.

I used whole wheat flour, used about half the salt, added a bit of nutmeg and ground flax seed, left out the nuts (becuase of my kids) and chocolate chips - outcome was a great tasting, healthy muffin. I also mixed the oatmeal with the applesauce and let it sit for maybe 30 min first, helped soften/breakdown the oatmeal some so it wasn't as noticable in the muffin. My 17 mo old twins loved them, too :-) Thanks for sharing, definatly a keeper recipe!

Delicious! Used other reviewers' suggestions and reduced salt to 1/2 tsp., used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour, and left out the nuts (personal preference). Very moist and fluffy. Will make again! Thanks!

Very moist and quick to bake.  I think the salt is too much and will cut back to half the amount next time.  I left out the chocolate chips.  I used cinnamon applesauce for even extra cinnamon flavor.

My husband and I enjoyed these, and I ususally don't care for baked banana taste.  Very easy, I like the addition of the oats.  I omitted the chocolate chips, and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Turned out to be very attractive too!

These muffins are amazing! I used whole-wheat flour, and omitted the nuts and chocolate chips. They turned out light and delicious, not gummy at all. 

If you do choose to omit the chocolate chips, you should definitely reduce the salt. I used the given amount, but the muffins came out a bit salty. I'll use only 1/2 a tsp next time.

This recipe is so easy, and will definitely be used again.

Great muffins! 
I substituted: flour for whole wheat flour,
               added 1 tbsp flaxseed powder
               added 1 tsp wheat germ
               used less salt
               a bit more brown sugar :)

Good Recipe! I like the fact that it uses applesauce and the oats add a different texture. I used a lot less salt though, only about 1/4 tsp.

This banana muffin recipe was fantastic and tasted so yummy and the kids don't even know how good it is for them!!  I added 1/2 Cup of ground Flax seed and used whole wheat flour.  I also added some nutmeg and allspice just to spice it up a bit more.  I loved the consistency of the batter as well.  It was so easy to scoop into the muffin tins.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly & these were great.  The whole family loved them.  I hand mixed the batter & did not find them rubbery.  I think the rubbery texture comes from over mixing.

These rock!  Because of my son's allergies, we skip the nuts and replace the egg with 1 t baking powder / 1-1/2 T oil / 1-1/2 T water.  Other than that, they're a great way to use up ripe bananas.

I loved loved these muffins. They didn't last long because my boyfriend loved them too. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead. I also used mini choc chips and about half the amount. super yummy. I'm going to make another batch right now.

These are fantastic! I used very ripe bananas and unswetened applesauce and omitted the nuts. I did have to bake them for 12 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. I toasted them lightly the next day and they tasted even better than they did the day I made them. Terrific recipe. This will be a family favorite, I am sure.

These are good. I didn't find them rubbery in texture in the least. The chocolate chips made them really sweet, to my surprise. I think next time (and there will be a next time for sure) I will try raisins instead of chocolate chips.

These muffins were pretty good, just not a favorite.  I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of white and omitted the nuts (allergy).

The flavor of these muffins is great but they came out a bit rubbery in texture. I used cinnomon chips instead of chocolate chips. I think I will continue my search for a tasty lower fat muffin.

These are sooo yummmy... and pretty healthy.  I used 1/2cup wholewheat flour and 1/2 white flour.. also used Oat bran (that's what i had on hand). Didn't add nuts as I didn't have any. Also instead of Chocolate Chips.. I used Carob chips.. it is a chocolate alternative and actually healthy for you!. The kids don't know the difference. Either does my husband for that matter.  I've also added a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder for an extra chocolate zing!  next time I'll add some wheat germ, cause it is full of zinc and folic acid.. and it's good for you!! and you can't tell when eating them! These are the best!! I'll only make these from now on!! thanks so much!!

Applesauce always makes the muffins a little chewy, but even knowing that in advance, these were deliciously moist and the flavor combination was wonderful. I used pecans as I didn't have walnuts and I think next time I'll omit the nuts and use blueberries like the other reviewer. :)

Very moist and flavorful. I've made them both as mini muffins and regular, with chocolate chips and without. It's good either way.

Husband didn't like the looks of them but loved the taste.
