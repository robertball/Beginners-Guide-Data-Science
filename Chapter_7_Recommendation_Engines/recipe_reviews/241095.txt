I made this the easy way by adding the herbs to the beans in one pan, and sauteing all the vegetables (I didn't have tomatoes)in the other. While those cooked, I made the whole wheat tortillas.  This is a great tasting dish! I'll be making this again!

This is an amazing recipe. There is such great flavor, easily modified to taste, and simple design. This one is definitely going into the archive! Can't believe this only has 3 reviews. Great job!

These were good!  Rather than canned beans,  I used leftover garbanzos that I had made in the crockpot a while back and frozen. I followed the recipe as shown, except only added 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice.  I didn't want to overpower the flavor with too much lemon.   I added salsa verde and chopped cilantro to the burrito, then heated for one minute in the microwave.  Very tasty!

These sound really delicious. Since my husband, the complete vegetarian in the household, doesn't care too much for squash, I think I'll include some mushrooms, maybe some diced potato, or other vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots?) in lieu of one of the squashes. Otherwise, sounds great. I'll be trying them soon!
