This is a wonderful starter recipe. 

Here is my variation, as well as some of the advice I followed by others...

We were out of beef broth, so I used two beef granules in two and a half cups of water. I omitted the mushrooms and added chopped up green peppers. I also added an extra potato and more carrots.

Because some complained about the potatoes not being done, I "par" cooked the potatoes in the microwave (2 minutes covered in water-drained and added)

I was out of teriyaki sauce so I made a simple substitute--a little bit of cooking sherry, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic.  It worked beautifully..

Also--to avoid the flour excess some spoke of, brown your stew meat in the 1/4 cup of flour before adding it to the crock pot.

The spices I included were garlic, seasoning salt, a pack of onion soup mix, a pinch of ground cloves and patrika, salt and pepper.

Enjoy!

I had just turned on the full crock pot before I read the reviews.. that's not like me! But at least I did read them in time to add a little liquid. I added roughly 2/3 Cup of Beef Stock and 1/3 cup of Worchestershire Sause. I doubled the recipe, by the way.  The Texture of the stew was really good. It's thick and just the way I like stew. Except for the Potatoes. I cooked for 5 hours, 3 hours on high and 2 hours on low, and the potatoes were still a little crunchy. I used Baby Yellow Potatoes, cut into less approx. 1/2 inch peices (at their thickest points) So I thought for sure they would cook, but alas, they did not. So cook on high! And the BIGGEST complaint I had about this dish was the paprika. If you do not use large amounts of paprika on a regular basis... DO NOT ADD IT! you can add a tiny bit, like 1/4 of what's called for, but if you are not familiar with the acidic tart earthy flavor, you probably wont like tablespoons of it in your stew. And the liauid you add. You should make it Reduced Beef Stock. Which means Buy Beef stock, put it in a saucepan and boil gently until it is reduced down to the volume of the amount of liquid you want to add. It will be very strong, and that's ok. It has the job of basically flavoring the whole stew.

This stew was JUST what I was looking for!!! I doubled the recipe and we barely had any left from 6 adults!!! I added one more carrot, celery stalk, and potato than what the recipe called for because I LOVE lots of stuff in my stew. :) I also omitted the mushrooms (friends we had over don't like them) and added about 1.5 cups of frozen peas. I added about 1/4 cup more flour towards the end to make it thicker. Also, I used 1 can of low sodium beef broth and 1 can of regular and it came out just fine with less sodium! Because I doubled the recipe, mine cooked for 8-9 hours but it was a hit!

The first time I made this stew it was exactly what I was looking for. I took the advice and added 1tbsp worchestershire sauce an extra 1/2c beef broth reduced the paprika to 1/4tsp and about 2tbsp of lipton's onion soup mix a 1/4 tsp both of salt & pepper I added a bay leaf and added about 2tbsp corn starch at the end to thicken it up. It was WONDERFUL husband loved it definitely will make again.-------- It's been 3 years now and this is one of my favorite recipies ever! I've perfected it I still do everything the same just upped the wocersershire sauce to 2 1/2 tblsp and I've always doubled the veggies. It's so important that you layer everything by how long it takes to cook. I put the meat on the bottom then the potatos then the carrots with the mushrooms and celery on top. The slower and longer you cook it the more tender and flavorful everything is. I LOVE this recipe!!!!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  We are a family of six, so I doubled everything.  My four kids are picky eaters and they loved it they even had seconds, that made me happy.  The only thing I changed was that I started dinner at 4pm so I didn't have 6 hours to cook.  What I did was cook the meat 45 minutes on the stovetop with 4 cups water, garlic and onion.  Then drained the water added the mixture to coat the meat, then added everything else as indicated in the receipe.  And cooked it on medium heat for another 45 minutes.  I made an easy 15 minute corn bread receipe.  And dinner was on the table by 6:30pm.  Thank you very much for the receipe, this is the first time I used this website.  I will definitely pass this receipe on and use your website again for more receipes.

This is excellent!! I don't know why it only has 4 stars... I made a few changes however: I didn't use any celery but chopped up two potatoes into big pieces instead. Also, I used beef round steak b/c I had it on hand. BUT, I would actually do it again - since the round steak was a bit thin and already tenderized, little pieces of it "floated off" while cooking so every bite of the stew  had beef in it. There were, of course, still big chunks throughout. Some people complained of a "sweet, funny taste" - I thought it tasted perfect. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and it was perfect. Trust the recipe, don't change anything except any vegetables you might like to take out or add.

Absolutely a wonderful stew.  My Aunt and Uncle moved into a new house and hadn't had a home-cooked mean in over a week.  I whipped this up and it was a real God-send.  I threw in a can of peas and a can of corn at the end.  I also added some worchestershire sauce for some added zest.  It makes a great leftover too!

This is an excellent stew recipe!  I followed the original directions exactly, then I added 1/2 cup of barley, 5 more oz. of beef broth, and 1.5 cup water. I cooked it on low for almost 8 hours. Then about an hour from when we were ready to eat, I added a 1/2 cup of frozen peas, and a 1/2 cup frozen corn. We made homemade bread, and between the smell of the stew and the bread the aroma was delectable!  The consistency came out just about perfect but only because I added more water/beef broth due to the barley.  Will make this again, and again!!!!

Had to put the new slow cooker I got for Christmas to use and tried this recipe out since I had most of the necessary ingredients. I didn't have mushrooms so I put in a yellow pepper cut into large chunks, and no teriyaki sauce so I used soya sauce. I also added worcestershire sauce as another reviewer recommended and I put in one cup of red wine. I put in one teaspoon on paprika to be on the safe side since other people found the amount of paprika overwhelming.  Wow, was this ever GOOD. I'm not one to toot my own horn much, especially with cooking since I'm still sort of new to it. But YUM.  I put a lot of the flavour to the fact that I used a nice shiraz in it, and the result was awesome.   Cooked on high for 6 hours, and the result was really tender. My husband is working on his second helping and though he's not a picky eater, he doesn't eat with relish unless he REALLY enjoys it.

I came home for lunch yesterday afternoon and threw this in the crockpot and set on high. I used 1 1/2#s beef and put 1/2 cup flour with 1/2 tbsp paprika and used worcestershire sauce like some people suggested. I called my husband and told him to turn it off after it had cooked on high for 5 hours. When I got home my husband and daughter had almost polished off the whole crockpot. They said they really liked it. I did manage to get a bowl and there was only 1 bowl for leftovers today. This was a very easy recipe and very good!!!!!

I found the recipe to be a bit bland.  I doubled it and after reviewing the ingredients, felt it needed some spicing up.  I added garlic powder, Emeril's Essence and Cumin.  I used a cut up Pot Roast as well as 1 pound of stew meat.  Cooked for 6 1/2 hours in the Crock Pot on high instead of Low as recommended.  The meat was perfectly done, but the potatoes were still hard.  Transferred to a Dutch Oven and finished for 1 hour on the stove top.  My guests all enjoyed the stew, but all felt it was a bit bland.  This is a great base, but will add several seasonings in the future.  More garlic, Worcestershire Sauce, Seasoning Blend, etc.

This was excellent and easy!  I omitted the paprika, used 4 cups of beef broth, and added a package of onion dry soup mix.  I added more broth because the 2 cups that it called for did not seem to cover the stew enough to where it would cook completely.  Next time I will add another stalk of celery and maybe one more potato.  Delicious!!!

I had to make some additions to get this to my family's taste.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, chili powder, extra garlic powder, and worchestershire sauce. Once the additions were made it came out great - without them the flour taste was overpowering.

I think that this is something that I will try again. Both of my kids are picky and never like the same foods, but they both said that they would like me to make this again.  I adjusted the recipe a little to adjust for the veggies that my kids like, but it went very well and was super easy.

For some reason, I've always been a little intimated about making beef stew.  I decided to try this one and we really liked it.  Don't forget to add the 2 cups of beef broth, especially if you are following it from the allrecipes cookbook, where it was accidentally omitted.  I doubled the whole recipe and cheated just a bit, using a frozen bag of "beef stew vegetables," and since it didn't seem like enough veggies, I also used a partial bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  I added some dried oregano, as a few others have suggested.  Also, I found I had to add several tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the stew up.  I think next time I would cut back a little on the broth.  Tastes even better the second day.

I thought this recipe was delicious - thank you very much for sharing. I added some rosemary, thyme and oregano, a bit more salt and some Worcestershire sauce - and cooked it on the stove top for an hour and a half. The meat was really tender and flavorful - we loved it! I'll surely make this again.

This is a keeper!  I wasn't a huge fan of beef stew UNITL I tried this recipe. I add a pkt of Lipton's dry onion soup,  more of the vegetables and 3 - 14oz cans of beef broth instead of 2cups.

I thought that this recipe was good, but it was a little bland. I had to add a lot of seasoning. I also added some red wine, and that made this stew really good. I also expected the broth to be a lot thicker. I might make this again.

I doubled the recipe and there was too much liquid.  I took another posters suggestion and added sour creme to thicken it up.  I also added the Worchestershire sauce since there didn't seem to be much flavor.  I agree that after 6 hours of cooking (half of it on high) the potatoes were not done enough - and I cut them up small.  I would also either leave out the paprika next time or put in a lot less.  It was a good recipe to start with, but needs a few enhancements.

I've never been able to make a decent beef stew...until now.  This recipe is fabulous.  Followed it exactly and it came out perfect in the crockpot.   Will definitely make again!

Excellent!  I used Worcestershire Sauce instead of Tereyaki.  I also put in 1 Teaspoon of Celery Seed Seasoning instead of one celery stalk (that way I didn't have to throw the celery away!!)

My family loved this recipe. I cooked it on the stovetop. I browned the meat in flour then added the broth, celery, spices, and garlic. I simmered for 1 hour then added the potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, and onion and cooked until done! Great!

This was allright. Of all the stews I've made, this was the mildest (almost verging on bland) and had the most soup-like texture. Having said this, I have yet to find a stew I DON'T like, but because I know there are better ones out there, I won't likely make this one again. I must disclose that I did not follow EIORE's recipe exactly (I know!). I feared 6 hours in a crockpot would not produce tender meat and potatoes, so I set mine to cook for 8 hours. NOTE: Many reviewers complained that their potatoes did not cook thru. If cut into small pieces (i.e. dice), they will be fine, even if simmering for the suggested 6 hour timeframe (this is key). This would be perfect for large families - it's easy on the pocketbook, makes a good amount, is easy to prepare and is mild enough to please multiple palates (especially kiddo's tastebuds). Served with warm French bread, this was a very filling, but average meal. Thanks for sharing, EIORE! :-)

As with other reviewers, I made a few changes. I rolled the meat in the seasoned flour (using less paprika) & lightly browned the beef in a pan instead of dumping so much flour in the crock pot. I also added a cup of red wine with the broth. I served this over garlic red mashed potatoes, so I cut the veggies in big chunks & left the potatoes out of the stew. I thickened it just a bit at the end with a cornstarch rue so it would be more like gravy for the mashed potatoes and it came out delicious!

A very tasty stew!  I left out the mushrooms (not a fan) and it was fine.  Hubby requested it for dinner again a couple of days later.  I did find I had to cook it for much longer than 6 hours on low the first time (potatoes were still not as cooked as I would have liked); the 2nd time, I cut the potato pieces smaller and put the cooker on high which worked a bit better.  Otherwise, great recipe.

Ok recipe for a base but I had to tweak it to make it work.  Marinated the beef in the teriyaki sauce over night and omited the paprika. Added an extra potato to bulk it out for starters.  Cooked it on high for 10 hours for the potatoes to get soft enough.  WAY too much liquid in the recipe.  Allrecipes.com got it wrong to adjust the liquid content, this is a stew after all not a soup.  Seeing as I had too much liquid I blended 1/2 cup sour cream with 1 heaping tablespoon of flour.  Tempered the cream mixture with some of the hot liquid then mixed it all together; which thickened it up to stew quality quite nicely.  I also took other raters advice and added some peas near the end.  A good recipe to start with but definately needs some help.

I did not include the teriyaki sauce or mushrooms, and coated the meat with the flour mixture in a ziplock bag. Would add more spices next time.

This recipe was pretty good. The only thing was that it lacked a little flavor... after reading other reviews I think the next time I make this I will add brown gravy mix... and perhaps a bit of  worcestershire sauce. I WILL make it again though. :)

I absolutely loved this recipe! I doubled it, added a lot more potatoes, and threw in an envelope of dry brown gravy mix for more flavor. I also left out the teriyaki sauce. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again, and maybe try a different kind of meat next time.

This was a easy and tasty stew. I didn't have fresh celery or carrots, so about 1/2 hour before it was done I added a can of carrots and one of peas. I added more teriyaki than called for, but still couldn't taste it, so I'm not sure if it's necesssary. Also, didn't use mushrooms because we were out. Will make again.

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover steak and this was it. I threw in left over fried onions and mushrooms and a cup of green peas, left out the teriyaki, added a little extra flour at end to thicken. Mine had to cook for 8-9 hours for potatoes and carrots to be done. Nice taste and smelled awesome while cooking.

love it! it's so tasty! I stirfried everything and transferred them to a pot to cook for another hour. Omitted the paprika, but it still tasted good.I marinated the beef with salt, pepper and japanese rice wine 3 hours beofre cooking. Teriyaki sauce definitely helped to bring out the nice flavor. Thanks for the great recipe.

My first attempt at making beef stew and it turned out quite good.  I found that there wasn't too much liquid in the recipe so I added a can of beer which aslo helped the flavor.

I don't know if it's my crockpot or what, but the potatoes definitely needed longer. I probably didn't cut them small enough. It was good, though, once it was finished. I should have started it earlier in the day.

Beware of doubling the recipe and not the time cooked. I found that after the 8 hours in the crock pot even after I changed it to high at the 1/2 way point it still wasn't ready. However I put in a regular pot the next day and cooked for 2 hours and it was delicious.

Imade this recipe for my family a few weeks ago and did not have any left.  I did find that if you double the recipe you need to first start the crock pot on hight or plan on a longer cook time , say 7 to 8 hrs.  I did find that cooking longer really allowed the flavors to mingle nicely.  I left out the mushroom and added more of the other vegies to make up the difference.  But all in all a very nice recipe and I am making my second batch today and I will make it again.  I did add the extra 1/4 cup of flour as was recomended by somone else and that did help to thicken it up nicely at the end but it really is not necessary.

This was so easy to make! I threw everthing in the crock pot just before bed, and in the morning it was ready to pack for my lunch. I thawed out some Rhodes yeast rolls overnight and baked them while I was getting ready for work in the morning. Perfect meal for a fall day!

Excellent beef stew!  All I had to do was thicken it up with flour & water before I served it and it was perfect!  Served it with fresh Italian bread. My mother-in-law loved it.... took all the leftovers home!  But I will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry to say this beef stew was okay, but not sensational.  I look for recipes that are Easy (it was) and Extremely Tasty (it was average).  If it passes the E.E.T. test, it's a keeper.  It was not a melt-in-your-mouth crave-some-more kind of recipe.  And I didn't think the smell was that great either.  I made the recipe EXACTLY like the directions said. Where are you other members that feel the same but aren't bothering to rate this recipe???

I did not use the paprika after reading the other reviews.  This was so wonderful to prepare and eat.  My husband loved it.  I think next time I will add peas instead of celery.  However if I didn't change anything it would still be perfect!!!

This dish was very easy to prepare and very tasty. I do not own a crock pot so I made it on the stove. I added dry ingredients to the beef cubes and browned them first.  Then added the other ingredients and cooked for two hours stirring frequently. My family enjoyed very much.

It was ok, but bland. I wound up adding a bit of tabasco sauce - not enough to make it hot, just enough to add a little perk to the flavor.

I made this on the stove top so I had to change it up a bit, but it's the best beef stew I've ever made.  I melted a stick of butter and slowly wisked in 1/2 cup of flour & paprika until it was pasty.   I added a little beef broth as needed.  Then I browned the meat until it was nearly done.  From there I followed the recipe as written and left it to simmer on the stove for a couple of hours.

This stew was okay.  I had to add water which probably diluted the "zest" flavor of the teriyaki sauce.

This was pretty good, though I would add a bit more potatoes.  Would give it 3.5 if it were an option.  I also thought it was much better a couple of days later.

This was a very good stew.  I followed the recipe exactaly.  I did add some more salt pepper and a few dashes of worstishire sauce.  
The flavor was very rich and it was satisfying on a cold Indiana evening.

Very tasty stew!  I made this in the crock pot with a 2 1/2 lb bottom roast that was frozen solid when I put it in.  I doubled all the ingredients because my roast was so big.  I cooked it for 5 hours on high- took the roast out and cut it into chunks and added it back to the crock pot on low for another 2 hours.  I added some cornstarch and water to thicken it a little at the very end.  Although I'm not a huge fan of beef stew (my husband is!) this was pretty tasty and VERY easy.  Thanks for helping me get over my stew aversion!

We enjoyed this recipe.  Since I like to serve stew with creamy mashed potatoes, I left out the potatoes, but added diced turnip and parsnips.  Also only used 1 1/2 cups beef broth, but added 1/2 cup red wine.

The most tender and flavorful stew made from a crockpot.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so substitued with Szechuan Spicy Stir Fry sauce and it was good!

This stew was really yummy! I added an extra cut of water, and used a couple of extra potatoes, as well as some barley. I also didn't add the paprika, but I did add a sprinkle of rosemary, oregano, and basil to give it a little more flavour.
It was quick and flavourful!

This recipe was just okay.  Very bland.  I doubled it and cooked it in the crockpot on high, and it was fully cooked in 5.5 hours. That said, the flour clumped slightly and even though I tried to add more seaoning it seemed very bland.  I didn't have any bay leaves and that probably would have helped tremendously.  While I didn't like the recipe, my fiance really enjoyed it.  I agree with previous reviewers that this recipe is a good start but needs work on the flavor.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It has such a good flavor!  It must be the teriyaki sauce.  I didn't use the bay leaf, and used less paprika.  I did add more stock and used corn starch and water to thicken at the end of cooking the stew. This was the best beef stew I've made.

I only rated this 4 out of 5 because it took a lot longer than 8 hrs on low to cook the potatoes.  Nothing spectacular to this one compared to what I make on top of the stove, so I will stick to my old recipe.  Thanks anyways.

As I do not have a crock pot I did it on the stove top....not enough fluid, the mushrooms turned completely black. I had to add more fluid and more thickener. I did exactly as the recipe said (I did cook the meat first as doing stove top)
Even on low heat and stirring continuously and it still burned in the bottom of the pan. I was not impressed with this recipe and will look for another next time. Unless someone can tell me what I did wrong, as everyone else seems to love this recipe except me.

Very nice stew that hubby really loved. I floured and browned my meat first, added more seasonings, a can of golden mushroom soup, leftover mixed vegies and a can of diced tomatoes. Worst. sauce and a bit of gravy master helped intensify the flavor. Thanks!

I made this with some changes and it turned out okay.  I did what some other reviewers did and added an envelope of brown gravy mix as well as half a can of cream of mushroom soup because I needed to use it up.  The stew turned out kind of sweet tasting- I don't know if that was from the gravy mix, the carrots or the teriyaki sauce, but next time I'll make this exactly as written minus the teriyaki sauce and add the carrots closer to the end.  My favorite pot roast recipe is simply meat, veggies, a can of soup, a can of water and some onion soup mix, so I may try that combination here since it seems to be a winner.

Excellent beef stew. My family loved the flavor. I added more garlic and added a can of french onion soup and fresh parsley. It feeds a crowd and everyone loved the consistancy and marriages of flavors.

I used 1 lg. yukon, parsnip, carrot, 2 stalks celery and I browned beef and cooked on high for several hours. I only had smoked paprika so I used that. I had no problem with liquid. Flavor was a little lacking, tho, as other raters pointed out.  I stole a tip from a french beef stew and stirred in a tbs of Grey Poupon before serving and topped w/jack cheese.  I would suggest adding a bit of beef Better than Boullion to it, too.

I put everything in the crock pot and felt like something was missing...there was no liquid to it.  I added a can of beef broth and that seemed to help.  You deffinitely have to cook it for the six hours recommended in the recipe.  I may try browning the meet before putting it in the crock pot next time.  Other than all of that, it was pretty good.

I tried this recipe "as is" and didn't care for it.  It was lacking both liquid and flavor.  Adding a few ingredients made a big difference.  I browned the meat in a saucepan first and then scraped up the brown bits by adding some beef broth and a little bit of dry onion soup mix to the saucepan.  I transferred the meat and broth mixture into the crockpot and added the remaining ingredients.

This recipe is worth trying but you might want to experiment a little bit to see what flavors you like best and you really do need to add some kind of liquid to make this a stew.

I thought this stew was very bland. It didn't have hardly any flavor, even after I added some beef broth. Maybe I did something wrong, but my husband and I thought there was something missing in the flavor department.

I assumed there would be little liquid and after reading the reviews decided to add 1cup beef broth.  There wasn't lots of juice it is a stew after all.  Everyone really liked this one.  Will make again.  Added some peas the last hour. Thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

Pretty good. I added 1 1/2 cups of beef broth, and a coupe sprigs of fresh rosemary. Next time I will mince it, as the rosemary fell apart in the stew and my son didn't like the needles (can't blame him). My older son & I (who really liked the stew) agreed that it needed more carrots and less paprika. Overall, we liked it; the meat was tender and the gravy rich. My younger son, the ultra-picky one, wouldn't even touch it, but that's not unusual :)

This is a favorite that I make often. I'm not crazy about celery so I replace it with green beans. A great recipe for a cold winters day!

It turned out good. I had 3.5 lbs of stew meat. I should of browned the meat first. I used carrots, green beans, corn, and potato’s. I substituted Worcester sauce and also used 4 cups of beef broth because I had so much meat. I low cooked it for 6 hours. Had to high cook it for an additional 3 hours. So it took a bit longer. Next time I’ll add more seasoning.

This was pretty good.  I had a roast I was going to do as per my regular mushroom/onion soup routine but did this instead.   Chopped up the roast, added some more onion, garlic and teriyaki sauce, :)

This was an "ok" stew after I made a lot of changes, even then it tasted a bit bland. I doubled the meat and veggies. First I browned the meat in olive oil and garlic after seasoning it in a paprika flour mixture, then added it to the crockpot with a little water. Then layered potatoes, carrots, green pepper, celery, and onions on top and poured in about 5 cups beef broth (one carton and one can). I added garlic powder, salt and pepper, oregano, paprika, teriyaki sauce, worchester sauce, onion/mushroom soup mix, and 2/3 cup of red wine. I put it on high for 6 hours, then added another can of beef broth and a can of corn. I used the remaining flour I had from the seasoning with some hot broth, added it in the last half hour. It turned out missing something as it was on the sweet side and I didn't particularly care for it even though my boyfriend did. I think it was because I didn't add as much seasoning quantity as I usually do. Next time I will adjust the amounts.

not a flavor i was expecting, but it hit the spot.  i added half of a hot chilly pepper, but it didnt make a difference, so i will use more next time.  also, it was a strange mix with the paprika and the teriyaki, so maybe next time i will try one or the other.  i cubed the potatoes pretty small,  but i still cooked it on high for a little over 4 hours, and everything cooked perfectly.

Tasty!  I liked the addition of the teriyaki sauce.  I thought the flavor was fuller than some other beef stews I've had.  Was a hit with the family!  I actually omitted the mushrooms and added about a cup of water to thin it out a bit.  Tasted great in bread bowls!

I added about 3/4 cup of water to this after flouring the meat and it turned out perfect.  I'd make it again since it was so easy.

Not the beef stew I expected.  It had a very strange flavor.  It may have been from the paprika or the teriyaki sauce.  I had to add water at the start.  It didn't live up to what the reviews said.
