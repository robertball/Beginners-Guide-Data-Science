Hi, I'm Jillian the submitter of this recipe. I use Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice for this recipe as a personal preference. To cut down on time they have a microwave bag that's done in 90 seconds if you prefer. I also use Hellman's light mayo and FRESH lemon juice. This is easy to throw together and chock full of vibrant colors and flavors - not to mention it's light. I hope you enjoy it!

Oh, YUM, Jillian!  How long has this recipe been around?  I was just poking around and found it.  Would you believe that I served this warm tonight with leftover turkey (the kosher one from Trader Joe's) from last night?  And tomorrow I'll have it for lunch cold from the fridge.  I didn't add salt, I didn't have yellow pepper, and I used full-fat mayo (I know...).  Otherwise I followed your directions.  This is so easy and such a great side dish!  I LOVE the versatility of recipes like this one!  Thank you very much!

Made exactly as written and it was delicious! I brought it to a barbecue and everyone asked for the recipe. Have also made it with quinoa, which is also excellent. Thanks, Jillian!

I used 100% wild rice which makes it taste nutty and crunchy (but doesn't look at all like the picture!).  Very good!

Awesome, easy and has a great light flavor with the lemon zest which I added a little more than called for. Simple and well worth the effort. Oh, we didn't have the long grain wild rice so we used white minute rice and wild rice in a nice combination.

This was really delicious, and it was also simple and quick to prepare.  I used the 5 minute Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice.  I also shredded a deli chicken and added it to the salad to make it a main dish.  We'll make this again - thanks for posting!

I was pleasantly surprised!  It's a light, fresh meal.  I doubled the lemon because I'm a fan.  My whole family ate it.  Great side or potluck dish because it can be made ahead.

This recipe has a wonderful. refreshing flavor and comes together so quickly! I used Kashi 7 whole grain pilaf, because it was the only rice blend I had on hand and was dying to try this recipe. I tasted it once it was all mixed, to see if the seasoning was right before chilling it... and I couldn't stop eating it. This recipe is great as is.

Oh so tasty, I like it better fresh when you can taste the lemon. Once it sat overnight to cool the flavor wasn't as bold.

Interesting combination of flavours. DH really liked this but I found the lemon zest a little overpowering and I love lemon. I made this exactly as written but next time I will omit the zest. Thanks Jillian.
