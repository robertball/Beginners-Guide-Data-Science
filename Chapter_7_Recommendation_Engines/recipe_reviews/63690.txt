I love this dessert.  There are a few things you need to know to make this taste great.  First being there are differeces in textures of ricotta cheese from brand to brand and from light to whole milk.  The brand I've found to be the best with texture is Sargentos and the light is smoother then the part skim.  Second, throw a dash of cinnamon into this and it adds another dimension to the flavor.  I use Suiss Miss Sugar-free Mocho mix for the top and I use a cheese grater (like the ones in italian restaraunts)to grate the chocolate chips ontop.  That way they're more evenly disperse and you don't have to use very many (and you don't have to buy mini chocolate chips).  Try these suggestions and see if you like it, if not keep in mind this is a sugar-free good for you dessert and sometimes you have to take what you can get.

I am in love with this. I would eat it even if I wasn't on the diet!! I did make a couple of changes. I used 1 tsp of the cocoa powder, omitted the chocolate chips (because I forgot them but think they would be great) and added a little decaf instant coffee instead of the espresso powder. I used my Braun hand bleader and got it to a great smooth texture.

Maybe it's my white-trash/siscillian-american up bringing, but I LOVED this...it reminded me of the canoli's I grew up on....that is why the texture did not bother me. I will definately make this again...it curbs teh cravings while also giving you a "full" feeling.

I really didn't like the consistancy with ricotta cheese, either, but if you substitute an equal amount of fat free plain yogurt in any of the ricotta cremes, it becomes a 5 star recipe. (according to the south beach web page diet updates, the yogurt is ok in phase 1 now).

This was a great treat however I'd recommend doubling up on the amount of cocoa powder.  Also, it should be known to any other South Beach dieters that this dessert is not Phase one correct unless you do not use the semi-sweet chips.

South Beach is working for me, but this recipe is NOT. The texture is so bad, even with "smooth" ricotta (I tried Kroger). Try my doctored version: 1 cup ricotta, 2 tsp. cocoa (like Ghiradelli), 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1 1/2 packets Splenda, 1-2 TB fat free half-and-half... Put it all in the blender/cuisinart and blend-blend-blend until smooth. I topped mine with a chopped sugar free peanut butter cup and some crushed almonds, then froze it. Now *that's* edible.

Not bad.  I used fat free cottage cheese instead of the ricotta, added a bit of orange peel, processed everything smooth in the food processor and refrigerated to firm up the texture.  I also skipped the chocolate chips.  I am not sure if fat free cottage cheese works for SB as I am not following that diet particularly - I am watching carbs and making sure they are good ones as well as watching overall calories. I agree with other reviewers that ricotta has a disagreeable texture even after blending - it is also a lot more expensive than cottage cheese.

This was horrible.  I made this recipe as suggested from the South Beach Diet book, where it raves you can have dessert. Don't even waste your time having this "dessert", it has the consistency of sand, and the taste is really awful.  I  even tried to put it in the food processor to make it more smooth, but it didn't do a thing.  I even got a second opinion.  My boyfriend could barely swallow the first and only bite.  If you're going to have dessert, just go for a REAL dessert.

Excellent!!!!!! I have also made it with just the vanilla extract and sweetner, substituting also the vanilla with almond and adding a few slivered toasted almonds!! the secret is to find a CREAMY ricotta, then its like heaven in a cup!

This has become a staple of my SB plan.  I recommend Sargento’s Light ricotta – the texture and flavor is the best I’ve found (the lower fat ones are completely unedible!).  Add some Splenda, vanilla or almond extract, a hint of cinnamon and you’re good to go!

This is a great dessert!  HOWEVER, there are huge differences in textures and flavors of different brands of Ricotta Cheese.  Also between low-fat and no-fat.  Experiment to find the kind you like.  Great with other flavorings also.  You must be a canolli or cheesecake lover to appreciate this yummy treat.

LOVED this recipe, it is so satisfying dessert you can easily throw together if you have ricotta in your fridge as all the other ingredients are pretty standard.

This is ok if youre just craving something sweet
and chocolaty, but I only ate it when I had to on the strict phase of the South Beach Diet.  Personally, I like the ricotta creme recipes microwaved for 15 seconds other than chilled.  Chilling it, to me, made it a little more gritty!

DIDNT CARE FOR AT ALL, MY FRIEND ADVISED ME TO TRY IT WITH NO COCOA, JUST 2 PACKS SPLENDA AND ALMOND EXTRACT, AND PUT A FEW CHOC. CHIPS ON TOP TOO.  IT WAS MUCH, MUCH BETTER. MAKE BOTH, AND SEE WHICH YOU PREFER.  I DO MAINLY PREFER, NEW BREYERS LOW CARB ICECREAM, THE BUTTER PECAN IS EXCELLENT, IT HAS ONLY 4 NET CARBS FOR HALF CUP, TOP WITH SOME WHIPPING CREAM FOR A ALOT BETTER LO-CARB TREAT.  EVEN A HALF CUP REALLY HITS THE SPOT, CHECK IT OUT.

I tried the ricotta creme for dessert...YUCK!!! The first few bites I thought I could handle..but I just couldn't for the life of me finish it. It does have a yucky texture and it left a very bad aftertaste in my mouth. I will be pitching the rest of the ricotta cheese. At least I know better now. I'd much rather have no sugar jello or a no sugar added fudgsicle. In fact, I will be trying the SB peanut butter cup recipe tonight, it sounds a lot more appealing.

In the attempt to try to bring variety to the dessert portion of Phase I, I suggest a variation on this dessert. I add 1/4 tsp almond extract, 1/4 tsp imitation coconut extract, and one tsp cocoa powder and omit the espresso. For some reason, I think the Splenda is very sweet and I find that this desssert tastes less artificial if I reduce the Splenda by 1/2 - but most people like to use the full packet. (You can also try top increase the extracts to as much as 1/2 tsp each). This variation tastes a little bit like an Almond Joy.

This recipe was "the best!" You must make it in the blender and add crushed ice cubes to give it a shake like consistency.  I used granulated instant coffee and did not have chocolate chips and it came out great!

Not a company dessert, unless you are serving it at a South Beach diet support group! This is a dessert that you will only like if you like the texture of ricotta cheese.  It tastes to me like the inside of a cannoli.  My husband and I both liked it made with splenda.  I tend to get bored with it after a few bites, so a little goes a long way to assuage your sweet tooth when on a low carb diet.

Delicious!  Tastes decadent, really good stuff.  Note:  Ricotta is a grainy cheese, and the consistency will remain as such.  The overall taste of this is great, though!

I chose this recipe because I had some ricotta left over after making stuffed shells and I was too lazy to make cannoli shells.  I had to double the cocoa powder to give it more flavor and also to make it not look so washed out.  I also added a dusting of ground cinnamon along with the espresso powder and chips on top.  I probably won't make this again.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe... we try not to eat it too much though cause we are afraid that we will get sick of it.  You can also leave out the cocoa and coffee to make it just vanilla-and you can try that also with substituting vanilla with almond flavoring.  I always sweeten with splenda instead of sugar.

This was great but I made many many changes. First, Trader Joes sells no card no sugar chocolate thats actually really good! (Be warned, too much can cause a laxitiv affect). I chopped it up finely to add some texture. Some extra splenda helped and finally, Cool Whip makes a South Beach friendly whip cream and mixed in gives this dish the creamy flavor it was missing

I thought this was terrible. I love ricotta, so I didn't mind the texture like some other reviewers commented on, but I found the flavor to be less than desirable.

I agree that the texture of this dessert leaves much to be desired.  I added a little milk, extra splenda, and pureed the heck out of it.   If I'm totally craving chocolate I'll eat a half a teaspoonfull ... it has a similar enough taste to chocolate to turn you off to the craving.  Maybe I'll try snapping a rubberband on my wrist next time though.

I agree with previous posters - put in more cocoa powder, blend for what you feel is too long and then it might be enough. The colder the better. I had to add a little bit of half and half to make my blender blend it, but maybe another blender would work better. Try it a few times before you give up on it.

This was okay with some changes. I tripled the recipe, and put vanilla and almond extract in it. I also put 2 tsp. of cocoa powder, and 2 packets of splenda, and blended it in a food processor. Then I put it it custard cups sprinkled it with expresso powder and the chocolate chips. Then I put it in the refrig. so all I have to do is grab one when I want it. My 14 yr. old daughter liked it, but my 11 yr old son didn't. I thought it was good for a diet dessert. Next time I think I will add some slivered almonds too. If anyone is having trouble finding expresso powder, just go to any Italian import store, or Italian gormet store, they should have it.

I think this is a great option to dessert.  For Thanksgiving, I modified the recipe by adding pumpkin pie spice instead...SBD version of pumpkin pie.

Okay, this recipe needed some doctoring, but follow this advise and you will like what you get, I promise!

Increase cocoa power to 1 teaspoon, increase Splenda to two packets, add a little bit of water for mixing (gets rid of that grainy taste), then add one tablespoon of peanut butter and mix together.  YUM! Kinda tastes like peanut butter fudge.

I like this dessert and appreciate what it is. A healthy low carb, low sugar, guilt free treat. The texture is about the same as that of the inside of a cannoli just not as sugary sweet, chocolatey or heavy. For a smoother texture process in a mini food processor. I do not use sugar substitutes so I used a teaspoon of regular sugar and topped with a sprinkle of cocoa nibs. This would be great with fresh berries too.

I was skeptical about this.  Especially after reading all of the rave reviews.  It couldn't possibly taste this good. It was delicious.  OK, I did take the advice from other reviewers and used my hand blender to create a smooth consistency.  But that extra step was well worth it.  Yummy.

Not bad for what it is. I used to like this a lot when I first started the South Beach diet a few months ago. I'm back on phase 1 and it's just not as good as it used to be. I guess you can only have so much of it.

First time I made this, I was really not pleased. I wasn't expecting it to be wonderful, but the texture of the ricotta just really bothered me. The taste was "ok", but it needed tinkering. Next time I made it, I ran it in the food processor for a couple of minutes, which gave it much more of a "dense mousse" feel, which made it a lot better. I don't know why, but I feel like a little butter substitute, like smart balance, would make this a *good* recipe. The cocoa powder gives it an almost astringent mouth feel, which I think would be fixed with a *little* fat added in.

The texture of the cheese wasn't great for a dessert, but I thought I could make it work...and I did! I fixed the dessert and then added a little extra 1% milk and blended it with ice cubes to make a chocolate shake.  It tasted pretty good...at least good enough to drink the whole thing.

I didnt do the choc chip topping, just cocoa and splenda and a touch of vanilla extract.  I blended it as suggested and let it chill, it still was very dense.

This recipe rocks! After smelling the ricotta cheese I had my doubts, but the vanilla and sweetner take over the flavor. I doubled the cocoa after tasting. This is by far the best part of Phase One (besides the weight loss!)

I made the recipe without espresso powder or chips, added more splenda and whipping cream, then whipped it in the blender.  It was okay but the consistancy was still a little gritty.  I decided to add a few ice cubes and make a little icy drink and it was much better that way.  I will do this again anytime i am craving a starbucks frapaccino!

This just doesn't taste like dessert to me.  It tastes like chocolate flavored lasagna filling.  I was hoping it would be like tiramisu without the lady fingers but ricotta and marscapone are nothing alike.  Oh well, maybe I'll try it again with more Splenda like others have suggested.

A great sweet treat for South Beachers!  I like to add a little Sugar-Free International Foods Cafe Vienna for a cinnamon kick.  I also put it in a ramekin and bake for 15 minutes and add a little whipped cream and the chips at the end...gives it a chocolate souffle feeling.  If you can't get past the texture and still want something sweet/chocolatey, try a sugar-free fudgepop from Blue Bunny...they are the best!

This dessert was fantastic!  You MUST put it in the blender to make a creamy dessert, like a very thick chocolate mousse or pudding. You should also put it in the fridge/freezer and chill for about 1 hour.
I made a few changes: left out the espresso powder and added 1/4 teaspoon coconut extract and a few pieces of sliced almonds.  It was amazing!

You MUST put the cheese, vanilla, cocoa, and splenda in the food processor and process it until smooth or it will be a funky texture.  After you do that, and chill in the fridge or freezer for a little while, it's almost like a chocolate shake.  Yummy!

I omitted the espresso powder and chocolate chips, and added almond extract and slivered almonds.  It tasted very good, but the texture isn't great.  I'm really picky about the texture of foods though, and I could still enjoy the taste despite the graininess.  The almonds helped a lot. It did a lot to satisfy my sweet tooth (without making me want to eat too much!) so I will definitely make it again.

Being on the SB diet for a week, I was craving SOMETHING sweet for dessert, so I finally tried this.  After a bit of "doctoring" it was decent enough, considering what I had to work with.  I wouldn't serve it to anyone who had another choice, but I'd make it again. I tried it as written (except for espresso powder, had none) and decided to add a small dab of natural peanut butter (no sugar) and some more splenda and cocoa.  The chocolate chips added a lot to it.  But if you're not on SB or another diet with similar restrictions - find another great recipe on this site.

We've made this several times when a sweet craving hits and we're counting carbs.  The consistency is a bit weird, but it tastes alot like chunky homemade pudding.  I don't add espresso powder or chocolate chips, just replace the vanilla with almond extract.  We usually split a single serving between the two of us, and it's really very good for a low carb dessert.

Yuk! My husband and I were excited to have an option for dessert during Phase 1, but we'd rather starve than eat this one! The consistency is awful, and just thinking about the fact that you are eating spoonfuls of ricotta cheese is enough to make you turn on the disposal!

I am a sweet lover on the South Beach Diet.  IF you are on a diet this is an excellent dessert.  Of course, it will never top a cannoli or chocolate cake...but for diet food it is excellent and certainly satisfies my sweet tooth.  It has the texture of cheesecake.  My hubby didn't care for it though...but then again, he isn't watching his weight.

Also recommended is adding lemon or lime rinds to the ricotta (along with the sugar subst. and extract).

I am doing South Beach Diet and using this as a treat.  I have been making it as per the recipe, it is very filling and kills the dessert craving.  I am too lazy to put it in the blender each time I want it, so I just make sure to blend it REAL WELL with a spoon.  I do like ricotta, but I can see how some would not like the texture.

You can flavor up these ricotta cremes any which way, but this WAS a nice combination of flavors! I added a touch of fat free half/half and blended it to pieces with my mixer to try to make it into a smoother pudding, with fair success...just can't get all those lumps out...but it did taste good!

I loved this when I was on the South Beach Diet--if you're willing to add some more calories, I would recommend substituting 1 or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for the cocoa--I thought this gave it a much better flavor!

This was very bad. The texture was strange and it was definitely not worth all the calories.

If you need a quick chocolate fix, this recipe is really good.  I have added slivered almonds to this right before eating it and it is very good.

This wasn't all that bad and I didn't even put it in the blender. I didn't have any mocha pwd. to put on it. I think I might try freezing it also. I don't think my husband would like it because he's a chocolate dessert expert. It works for my chocolate craving.

not good at all. instead try it with lemon or almond extract with some splenda. for those of you who can eat cream cheese, save the cocoa powder for that instead.

i'm sure this is healthier than a lot of desserts,  but it is gritty and bland. i tried to liven up the taste but nothing really worked.

I thought this was great, especially for someone in Phase 1 of the SB Diet.  I did follow suggestion to increase cocoa to 1 tsp and sugar sub. to 2 packets.  I omitted the chips and espresso, b/c I did not have it.  The colder this dessert is, the better it tastes.

This recipe isn't too bad if you really need that chocolate fix. I agree with other reviews to put it into a blender to smooth out the texture of the ricotta. I didn't use the chips or espresso.....instead, I added a dollop of light whipped cream to the top of my bowlful and mixed it all up. Very much like a mousse....mmmmm......

This dessert is awesome!  But as others have suggested, you definately do need to blend it or food process it until it is smooth... but it totally cured my desire for chocolate!  Will definately be a SB staple!

WOW!  I started the SBD almost two weeks ago, and one thing I cut out was my once a week stop at Starbucks.  This yummy treat reminds me of a frappaccino!  I couldn't find the expresso powder at my local grocer, so I used instant decalf coffee.  Also, I didn't have cocoa powder on hand, so I used 3/4 tsp of chocolate extract.  This is definately my new SBD favorite dessert.

The taste is good, but the consistency is very pasty. Probably won't make this anymore once I'm out of Phase I of the South Beach Diet.

This is a great low carb dessert. I added more cocoa and vanilla and the taste was great. If you don't like ricotta cheese, or have issues with the texture of food, don't wast your time with this recipe. But for the rest of use trying to watch our carbs, a little goes a long way to satisfy your sweet tooth. Even my husband liked it. He said it tasted like cake with mashed up ice cream!
