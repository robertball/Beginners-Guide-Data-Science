These turned out okay but for as much that went into the marinade, there wasn't a lot of flavor to the meat. I marinated it for 10 hours so that wasn't the problem. It definitely needs more salt and more red pepper flakes. These were very colorful and pretty. Overall good recipe but I recommend adding more seasoning.
