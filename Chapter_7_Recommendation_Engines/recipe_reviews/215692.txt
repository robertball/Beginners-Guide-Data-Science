THE best breakfast I've had in a long time. I only made two small changes and that's using one whole sliced banana and 1/4 cup fat free evaporated milk. Everything else I kept the same. Very, VERY good. Next time, I'll quadruple it (thanks to the handy-dandy serving adjuster) so my whole family can enjoy this.

Delicious and nutricious! This was a great way to start the day. It was not only tasty but very filling. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Overall, perfect for breakfast.

This was very good. I would use roasted ground flaxmeal over the oatbran for a more nutty flavor and cook the quinoa a bit longer. Also, using a really ripe banana cancels out the need to add any sugar. Topped with extra banana slices and an extra sprinkle of cinnamon and this was a really good start to the day. Thank you!

I made this recipe up while I was living alone during grad-school.  You can double it, doctor it, and pretty much add whatever you want to it.  I used quinoa for extra protein to help me get through really long days.  I've added flax seed, blueberries, diced apples, dried cranberries, peaches, etc. to this recipe.  Some will find it sweet enough with just the banana but, if you're like me and you live molasses, brown sugar adds a nice flavor.  I think you could make this with pretty much any grain you want - sometimes I toss in a little polenta or grits, but it's important to use slow-cooking oats, not the quick-cook or instant oats.

SO TASTY!!!!
A bit more time-consumming than some other recipes, but totally delicious and well worth the time.
I don't have oat bran, but I've successfully used both wheat germ and ground flaxseed in its place. Also, I LOVE cinnamon (and it's actually very healthy), so I added between 1/2 - 1 tsp.
Additionally, I used raw pumpkin seeds rather than the walnuts as I am vegetarian and the provide extra iron, aside from the fact that they add a delicious crunch.
Lastly, the vanilla is a must - it makes the dish.
A great way to start the day.

Yummy, and so healthy with the 3 cereals. I felt it needed more liquid, though, as it was too thick, so I added some while it was cooking. I think granola would be good to add to give it some more sweetness. Servings looked small, but it's very filling, a little goes a long way.

This was surprisingly good, however I had to make a few changes.  I did not have the oat bran so I used ground flax seed.  This is probably a healthier choice going forward.  I did not use the brown sugar, I used one whole banana.  It was plenty sweet enough for my taste.  I found that there wasn't quite enough liquid in the recipe, so with such a small serving size the kind of pot you use will make a difference.  I used a larger skillet and too much liquid evaporated (so I had to add more a couple of times) plus my quinoa did not get as done as I would have liked.  I would have rated it more in the 4.5 range if I had the choice because it is definately worth making, but it's not really a 5 star recipe in the grand scheme of things.    

All in all I will make this again!  Next time I will make a quadruple recipe to share.

I've never managed to make oatmeal taste good and although this isn't exactly oatmeal it's the best hot cereal I've ever made.  I didn't have quinoa so I used pearl barley instead and had strawberries to get rid of so I used those along with the banana.   I added a bit more sugar than called for, thinking that it wouldn't be sweet enough, that was a mistake!  It's a great recipe as written and I'll be making this again.

I have been wanting to add quinoa to my diet, and this was the perfect recipe to start off with. I added a little to much of the brown sugar, but I know for next time that not as much will be needed. I am also going to try this with other fruits, as others have suggested, this way I can use up all the fruit from last years canning, and have a fresh stock for this year.

A great spring board recipe.

I just got done making this. It was the first time I've ever made quinoa so I was really surprised when this came out perfectly. As I was making breakfast, all hell broke loose and the granola I was toasting burned, my eggs suffered a bit of overcooking but my hot cereal was perfect, and cheered me right up.

I do suggest that those cooking this hold on to the sugar until the bananas have cooked down, because it may not be necessary.

Excellent recipe and so delicious. I have made this with the bananas as called for and also with blueberries. Both were wonderful and I'm so glad to have a new recipe with quinoa in it!

This recipe was great. I didn't add the oat bran, but everything else was included. I was amazed at how long this simple meal held me over. I ate this at 7am and didn't feel hungry until noon. That's what I call an amazing meal!

I thought this was pretty good. It unsurprisingly put the flavored bagged oatmeal to shame. My grocery store did not have quinoa or oatbran, unfortunately. So, I subbed an equal amount of those ingredients for additional old-fashioned style oatmeal. I loved the walnut and tad of brown sugar that really gave the oatmeal good flavor. I ended up adding the oatmeal to the slow boiling milk, water, cinnamon, and vanilla and, cooking it and stirring often, for about 4 minutes and then adding the banana, walnuts, and brown sugar once off the heat. I only had 2% milk and not non-fat and it worked fine. I think the old fashioned and not quick oats are needed in this recipe. Thank you for the filling, tasty, and healthy breakfast this morning.

This beats any hot cereal I have ever had.  We made this for dinner tonight and my 4 year old loved it.  I doubled this recipe and  made some small changes.  I used ground flax seed instead of oat bran and sunflowers instead of walnuts.  I also added about 2 tsp of  chia seeds for extra protein. My bananas were a little ripe with black spots but I think it added extra flavor.  The quinoa doesnt cook all the way but you dont even notice with the crunchy nuts in the cereal.  Very good.  Awsome  and Thanks for the post.

I love this!  It's pretty thick so I poured a little milk over it when it was done (but I do that with my regular oatmeal too).  I used a dash of liquid sweetener instead of brown sugar and also added in a pinch of ground flax like a couple other reviews mentioned.

Great recipe that adds more protein to your morning oatmeal.  I substitued steel cut oats for the rolled oats and cooked the quinoa and the steel cut oats together. I also added couple more tablespoons of water and cooked for 2 minutes longer. Pecans were used for the nuts. Very satisfying breakfast.

This was a perfect breakfast!  I used homemade almond milk instead of skim milk to make it dairy free.  I didn't have any oat bran, so I just replaced that with extra oatmeal.  I used quick oats, because that's what I had, but I will make sure to pick up some old-fashioned oats during my next shopping trip.  I didn't have any walnuts, either, but I wish I would have, as I can tell it would help offset the crunchiness of the quinoa.  I can't wait to try this again!!  YUMMY!!

My husband was wary of this recipe, because of the quinoa, but I told him to try it and he loved it.  I was out of bananas, so I substituted dried cranberries - one my typical breakfast toppings - and he LOVED it.  It takes a little longer than instant oatmeal, our usual breakfast, but it is SOOO worth the wait.  I will cook this again and again and try other substitutions.  YUM!!

I think I must have done something "wrong though"..I doubled the recipe and the resulting volume seemed to be the same as one of the instant oatmeal packets.  I probably reduced the water/milk by too much.

We are going to keep experimenting with this, maybe try dry mango, cherries, blueberries.  I "realized" today why Homeskillet added banana.  Bananas are loaded with benefits that everyone can use to start off their day.

SO easy and so filling and flexible on ingredients.  My grocery didnt have quinoa so I left it out. I quadrupled for me and hubby as reviews said servings were small. Instead of a pinch of cinnamon, my shaker decided a tablespoon was necessary (oops!) And as i reached for the brown sugar I discovered it had turned into a brick! Hubby opted to use white and raved about how good this was. Will make again!! Thank you :)
Edit: have made probably 100 times, my fav is with apple :)

Delicious! I've made this twice in 2 days. The second time was much better, I cooked the quinoa in the water for about 10 mins, then added the milk and other goodies. I did it once with banana and once with an apple, they were both really good! My 9 month old gobbled down almost a full portion too :-) Thanks!

I like oatmeal a lot, so this recipe could not go wrong.  The quinoa adds almost a succulent crunch.  And for me, the very ripe banana was enough sweetness.  It's so quick to make even with steel cut oatmeal.  I'd definitely repeat this recipe.

yummy! I doubled the recipe, and used half ground flaxseed, half wheat germ for the oat bran (didn't have any).

Simply Delish! And so Nutritious and filling. Only thing I tweaked was the milk. I didn’t have any skim milk on hand so I substituted Unsweetened Vanilla Almond milk. Also I added a bit more milk than the recipe called for.

I didn’t have bran so I just used porridge oats and it was delicious! I’ve also tried almond extract instead of vanilla. Both are great!

This was so good - I actually doubled the recipe for just me and thought it was the perfect amount. The quinoa adds great chewiness while the wheat bran makes it creamy. Healthy and delicious!

This was kind of blah. The only flavor other than cardboard I got, was in the random pieces of banana I'd find. Obviously this is supposed to very healthy, and it is, but it definitely tastes that way.

Excellent!  A great twist on a hearty stick-to-your-ribs hot cereal and perfect for cold Chicago mornings!  I used the serving adjuster to make enough for the family and they loved it and wanted me to make it again the following morning.   I didn't have oat bran so I added ground flax seed instead and kept everything else the same.  Perfect!

SOO GOOD!!  I didn't have oat bran so I just used extra oats, and it turned out amazing.  The cooked banana adds so much natural sweetness.  I'll definitely make this again - I will make a larger batch next time and split it into portions to take to work.  Thanks for the recipe!

Gave this a shot this morning! Best oatmeal I've had in a while. Made it the way you instructed but I added a handful of frozen blueberries when I added the banana and some unsweetened coconut once it was done. Great recipe!

A super filling and good for you breakfast. I make it while I'm getting ready in the morning. I've made it with steel cut oats (takes a lot longer) and also with large flake oats. My personal favourite is the large flake oats with 1/2 an apple diced and cinnamon in place of the banana and nuts!

I made this today and was worried that it was going to be too soupy and that it was going to be a really small serving. I doubled the recipe (which I couldn't finish because it was very filling) and substituted chia and flax seeds for the bran and almond milk for the skim. It was hearty, thick and delicious!

I'm sitting here this morning enjoying this oatmeal very much. Great cold morning breakfast. I used flax instead of oat bran, just what I had on hand. Perfectly sweetened I did drizzle a little honey on it about 1/2 t. Thanks!

This is delicious and nutritious. I'm not a huge fan of hot, mushy bananas so I put them in as part of the last step. I also only put half of the sugar that it asked for and it was just the right amount of sweetness. This will definitely become a regular breakfast for me.

Great for keeping my hypoglycemia in check!  I quadrupled the recipe right away.  I did not have bananas or oat bran so I substituted dried cranberries and flax seed.   I made it again with bananas.  A great base-recipe to use whatever you have on hand.  This breakfast keeps me going all morning.  Thank you for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe!  The first thing I thought "Why only one serving!!!!"  I should have doubled, tripled it!!!  I made it exactly as written. My first time cooking with quinoa and had a little hard time finding it in my local grocery store but I will definitely stock up now!
This has such a yummy warm taste the banana taste was wonderful!!!

Ayter been on the search for the perfect oatmeal recipe. I wanted one that would be creamy and delicious like the instant packs. But healthy without all the added "stuff" that comes in the instant packs. 

needless to say I have tried many recipes. By tricking this recipe and combining a few tricks I learned from some other recipes I found the perfect oatmeal recipe.

first I used ground flaxseed rather than oatbran. I omitted the walnuts and the sugar.in place of the sugar I added a tiny bit of honey. Rather than slicing the banana I mashed the banana.I used sprouted quinoa, not sure if that makes a difference or not.as the mixture is cooking I added splashes of milk here and there. And After it was completely done cooking off the heat I added one raw egg. After stirring it and really well I put it back on the heat just long enough to make sure everything was cooked well.

this gave me the most creamy, silky, delicious bowl of oatmeal!

It's a very good recipe. I used 2% Milk half a cup ,because I like my oats a little watery. I chopped the banana end the end did not cooked them. I like honey, so instead of sugar and vanilla I used honey. This recipe makes a lot, so I even out every ingredients to one cup oat brand , oats and nuts.

Really good; I made a double batch and ate the whole bowl.  Loved how healthy it is.  Like others, I did not have oat bran, so I subbed equal parts wheat germ and ground flaxseed meal and I think that worked well. Also subbed pecans for walnuts since that is what I had.  I don't like meals super sweet, so based on comments I halved the sugar and liked that.  Will make again.

This was so yummy!  I really felt a little kick after eating it!  I made a few changes though... I used vanilla almond milk instead of skim, vanilla, and brown sugar. Nixed the cinnamon and salt. Used wheat germ instead of oat bran. And used chopped pecans instead of walnuts (that's all I had on hand). This is definitely a keeper for my morning routine!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was AMAZING! I did add a little milk at the end because it was a little too thick. It didn't look like it made much when it was in my bowl but all the grains and nuts made it surprisingly filling! It was a little more time consuming then my breakfasts usually are but soooooo worth it! I will definitely be making this again!

This was good, but I think it could be creamier.  Why 1/2 water half milk?  Next time I will use just milk.

umm...just going through the ingredient list and this calls for only 1 1/2 tbsp of oats, 1 tbsp of quinoa, and 1 tbsp oat bran?  I think the measurements are listed incorrectly here. Unless there is some kind of super swelling oatmeal out there I don't know about. Funny nobody mentioned this in any of the reviews. Maybe they were written by birds.
***UPDATE***
Okay. Upon further review this  part of the recipe (oats, quinoa, and oat bran) comes out to about a 1/4 cup. Add the rest and I can see this would add up to about 1 serving.
 
Forgive my ignorance. As penance I will not make comments on any recipe ever again...except this one...which I will turn into my own personal blog.

Made it with whole milk and red quinoa... delicious!!!  For me it has become a breakfast favorite.  This last time I added 1 tbs raisins when I stirred in the oats and bananas; the flavors and texture combined quite well.

This is a great breakfast dish.  I make it for my husband and myself so I modified the amounts.  1 1/3 cup of water and 3 TBS of quinoa.  I let that simmer for 5 min.  I then add my pre bagged dry ingredients.  ( I found making 5 baggies of the dry ingredients saves time) 4 TBS rolled oats (best not to use the minute ones), 2 TBS of flax seed or oat bran, pinch of salt, pinch of cinnamon.  I add any fresh fruit I have and even craisins along with a splash of vanilla extract and then cook for an additional 5 min.  I sprinkle chopped almonds on top and sometimes sugar depending on the fruit I have used.

Made without quinoa and used wheat bran and wheat germ, very good kids needed little more sugar.  Try with quinoa next!

It turned out soooo watery. The taste was fine but the texture was all wrong.

I made this several times before but hadn't made it for awhile.  I just made it again and had to rate and review.  Delicious.  I did substitute ground flax for the oat bran and sliced almonds for the walnuts; also substituted about 2 tsps. of maple syrup for the brown sugar and used 1 whole very ripe banana. So delicious, satisfying and healthy.  Thanks for a great new breakfast recipe!

I had to add more oats because mine was too runny. Doesn't sound like anyone else had that trouble. I did follow others' suggestions to use flax seed meal instead of oat bran, and I'm thinking that's the issue. Also, if the bananas are quite ripe, you don't need added sugar.

My new favorite breakfast! I skip the oat bran (do not have any) and the brown sugar and vanilla extract (trying to cut out sugar from diet) and subbed almond milk for the milk.  It is delicious even without the added sugar.  I like it with chopped walnuts, almonds or cocoa almonds (really good with the hint of cocoa flavor).

I made this without the nuts, and used almond milk. The quinoa I used was breakfast flakes, and I'm not sure if the quinoa called for is the same or not. I felt like it needed an extra 1/4 cup of liquid, so I added more almond milk during the last cooking phase. I loved it. Very delicious and filling!

Good cereal, but didn't make enough for me. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

This is delicious!  Just made it and I used Vanilla Almond milk instead of cow milk,  it would also be very good with apples /apple sauce.  Very good and nutritious.

My family enjoyed this, even my 9 year old son, which is great.  My "pinch" of salt was too big, so it was too salty.  I think I'll just leave that out next time.  I used ground flax for oat bran.
