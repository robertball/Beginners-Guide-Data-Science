I added one can diced petite tomatoes, 1 clove of garlic and onion salt (since I was out of onions). I used a cup of frozen bell peppers. Added more chili powder because we like more.
We really enjoyed this chili. It was very easy.

I love this as a basic go-to! It's quick and flavorful. I added a bit more garlic to my tastes and a can of diced tomatoes. But it's a great basic formula that you can tamper with or leave as is! Family always loves it!

Simple and tasty! I did have some canned diced tomatoes that needed used up, so I threw them in also. The family enjoyed this and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)
