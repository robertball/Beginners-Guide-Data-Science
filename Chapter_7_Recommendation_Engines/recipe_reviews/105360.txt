This is delish. I made it in a punch bowl and added gingerale and substituted frozen strawberries for fresh. I used a carton of rainbow sherbet in scoops (any flavor will work), a full bottle of gingerale and a full bottle of sparkling wine, and a bag of frozen strawberries. You could add non-alcoholic bubbly if there are kids present, or leave it out since the soda is fizzy. I could not believe how fast this punch went!!

Yummo! This made a terrific dessert drink on New Years. While the kids were having their dessert we enjoyed this fruity drink. I substituted peach sherbert instead of lemon and it was amazing!

This was fabulous and refreshing! I used strawberry champagne, Orange sherbet, and frozen strawberries that I thawed. Yum!
