When I made this I used boneless breasts and doubled the sauce.  As others mentioned a thin sauce, I dredged the chicken in flour before adding to the slow-cooker and then topped with the sauce ingredients.  When the sauce is cooking, it smelled kind of weird, but when I served it over white rice, it tasted terrific!  The sauce was just slightly thickened (in a good way).  Note for next time -- no need to double the sauce, single batch makes plenty!

Absolutely delicious and easy!! On Sunday afternoon I wanted to cook something in my crockpot  for the week ahead, by the time I decided to try this chicken recipe it was 3:30 so I thought, I'll cook it and at least it will be ready by around 8:00 pm then I'll have something ready for tomorrow.  well I skinned the chicken thighs and put them in the crockput then put a can of tomatoe soup in a bowl and mixed in the soya sauce less then 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar chopped up two cloves and maybe about 3 tbsp of minced onion, and sliced thin about 4 small carrots, stirred it all together poured it over the chicken gave that a stir. and had the pot on high....checked it at 7:30 and the meat looked purfect!!  cooked some rice, and wow! within 31/2 hours we were eating a wonderful tasty dinner, my sons loved it! I have a rather finicky 3 year old, and he loved this dinner!  My 7 year old asked for 2nds!! I have a few pieces and lots of gravy left over for tomorrows meal, Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and for all the little additional ideas....

I used bone-in chicken breasts and coated them in flour first.  I also added baby carrots and onions to the slow cooker.  And I think it was the best thing I have made in the slow cooker yet.

This was delicious!  I made a few modifications: Used 3 chicken saddles (thigh and drumstick ) without skin, trimmed of fat, and dredged in flour.  Added a can of tomato soup (didn't have another can of tomato sauce), about 1 Tbsp of ground ginger, and 1 Tbsp dried, minced garlic (out of fresh).  Followed recipe on amount of soy sauce and brown sugar.  Once the chicken was falling off the bone, which only took about 6 hours on low in my slow cooker, I removed the bones and used tongs to sort of shred the chicken.  If trying to remove the chicken from the slow cooker to serve along side of rice and sauce, I suggest using a large slotted spoon.  The chicken is so tender that it will fall apart via any other method.  I served the chicken and sauce over white rice and sprinkled slivered almonds on top.  My husband and 6-year-old LOVED it.  Will definately make again!!

Really good! Like so many reviewers of this and other recipes, I had my doubts about the tomato-soy sauce combo, but it was great. I used 3 frozen whole medium-sized boneless skinless chicken breasts (1Â½ lbs total), 3/8 cup soy sauce, 2 TBS veg broth, 1/4 cup plus 2 TBS brown sugar, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 can of sliced mushrooms, 1/4 of a largish onion (sliced), and the 8 ounces of tomato sauce. 8 hours on low later, it was dinner time. I shredded the chicken a bit in the slow cooker and served it with white rice and steamed carrots and broccoli. It was sweet enough that our four-year-old enjoyed it, and my husband inhaled the stuff! Very good, thanks for sharing, CookieLuvr!

My hubby enjoyed this dish and had seconds. This may have had something to do with my one modification to the recipe - I added a good splash of wiskey to the sauce.

Has to be one of the easiest recipes for drumsticks that I've used yet.  The teriyaki-type sauce (a mixture of flavours that we didn't find strange at all) was a huge hit with the family and the meat was so moist it was falling off the bones.  Delicious and simple!  What more could a busy mom ask for.....  I did brown my chicken first, don't know if that was necessary or not.

This came out great and is dirt cheap (the whole meal cost around 5 bucks and fed 3 of us!). The reviews were very helpful too. Cut the chicken in half from the suggested amount (little over a 1 3/4 pounds or 6 good-size legs) but made the full amount of sauce so we'd have plenty to go over our rice. Went with the low sodium soy, doubled up on the brown sugar (1/2 cup), added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger, some minced green onion and 2 teaspoons of corn starch. Perfection! Thanks for the recipe. Oh, I noticed a previous review of this recipe where the author found it very time consuming skinning the chicken. A little tip is to take a folded paper towel and grip the chicken skin with the towel as you are pulling it off. The towel helps you keep a firm grip on the skin, especially if your chicken is wet.

This was such an easy and yummy recipe, that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.  My picky 3-year old loved the chicken and my health conscience husband like that it was flavorful and light.  We served it with white rice and with a salad.  The sauce was perfect for pouring over the rice.  This will definitely become a favorite for this busy mom!

This chicken was very good served over rice.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added quite a bit of brown sugar to get the sweeter taste.  Be sure to take the skin off, the chicken ends up falling off the bone.

This is the first dinner that EVERYONE in my family liked and did not complain about in a long time!  I used skinless boneless chicken thighs.  Thank you for such an easy and delicous recipe!

Delicious!  My husband and neighbor absoluely loved this.  I served it with brown rice and steamed Asian-style veggies.  I did end up making extra sauce on the stove.  I used the same recipe, just added some flour to thicken it up.  It was delicious over the chicken and on the rice.  It was a huge hit, I will definitely be making it again!  UPDATE:  For my second time making this, I used low sodium soy sauce and it was much less salty.  I highly recommend doing this.  I also added half a sliced onion and about 4 peeled and chunked potatoes.  The potatoes were DELICIOUS!

Prepared this dish for dinner tonight, but by the time I came across the recipe it was too late to place it in the crock pot, so I baked the dish in the oven and it turned out fine. Everyone enjoyed the dish but think I will cut back on the amount of soy sauce the next time I prepare it and add a bit more brown sugar and tomato sauce. I did make a few changes to the dish. Number 1. As with many other viewers, I used both legs and thighs. 
2. I left the skin on the chicken and sesoned with Emeril's Essence ( recipe at foodnetwork.com) |
3. Browned it in  some olive oil, then removed from pot to wipe out excess grease.
4. I prepared the sauce according to directions then added approximately 1 TB ketchup, dash of ginger, garlic salt, onion salt and 2 tsp chopped garlic. 
Placing the chicken back into the pot used to brown it in, I pour sauce over the chicken  and then baked in a 375 degree oven for 1 hr 45 min. The chicken fell off the bone. Next time I plan on doublling the recipe for the sauce, leaving out half of the soy sauce called for. Served over brown rice with a side veggie and sliced cucumbers.

Molly's Chicken gets a thumbs up from my family. I didn't taste it but everyone in the family really enjoyed it. If the sauce would have been thicker, I would have given it 5 stars. :o)

It has become a favourite of my daycare.  I put it on at 7:00 on high and it is ready for us for lunch at noon.  I pull all the chicken off the bones and serve it to them over rice or noodles and a veg.

Here's a way of making the sauce thicker, more flavorful, and less salty: mix 1 T tapioca flour with 1/3 C brown sugar in crock pot; stir in 1/4 C soy sauce, 1/3 C ketchup, 2 T vinegar, 1 T sherry, dash ground ginger.  Add chicken & carrots, cook on low 3 hours, add 1 cut-up green pepper and 1 small can pineapple chunks with juice, cook 1/2 hour more.  It's no longer "Molly's" but it does become an easy sweet and sour crockpot dish.

I made this today but I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and after it cooked all day I shredded it up and put it on buns.  It was very tender and had lots of flavor.  Its a keeper!

Very tasty rescipe everyone loved.  I mistakenly didn't read the part where you are to mix the ingredients in a separate bowl and pour over the chicken and just put the chicken in the crockpot, and put the other ingredients on top, mixed with a little flour to thicken the sauce  as others said it was thin.  Turned out just fine doing it that way :-)  Will definitely  make this again!  Thanks!

This was great, we loved it. I made it in the oven instead of crockpot and thought it turned out better. I pan fried the chicken first (though i dont think this was necessary). Then i mixed the sauce in the bottom of a casserole dish and laid the drumsticks in it. I added about 1 tsp of cornstarch to the sauce to help thicken. I baked (uncovered) at 350 for 30-45 minutes, turning the drumsticks in the sauce once during baking. The sauce really coated the chicken well and every bite was sticky goodness!One other thing is that I only had about half the amount of chicken and used the full amount of sauce and we had the perfect amount for putting over the rice.I imagine baking it in the oven produces less sauce than making it in the crockpot. The flavor was perfect, i used the called for amount of sugar and soysauce. My kids loved it!

My Chicken turned out awesome. I did make one pretty big change in the recipe. After reading other reviews that said the sauce was too salty, I omitted the soy sauce all together. I used Worcestershire sauce instead. I also double the amount of garlic. It turned out great.

I tried this recipe as directed and it was good. The meat fell off the bone and was very tender. Quite delicious. This recipe kind of reminded me of my grandmothers sweet and sour chicken so I decided to make it again and make a few of  my own modifications. I used a little less soy sauce, a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, brown sugar, some Catalina dressing (my grandmother used it in her recipe a  secret ingredient) a can of pineapple chunks with the juice, a little bit of fresh ginger I shredded with my cheese grater, and about a 1/4 of an onion, and let me tell ya, it was AMAZING!!!! The original recipe is good, for a semi sweet crockpot meal, I decided to tweak a few things. Goes great with rice and broccoli. My main advice try the original recipe first, then make your own modifications!

This was quite good, but I felt like something was missing.  My boyfriend, however thought it was great.  I made it exactly as the recipe says, except I browned the chicken in the frying pan before placing into the slow cooker.  Maybe some ground ginger and a bit of chili sauce?  I think it could also be a bit sweeter.  I had to leave the house and I cooked it for about 9 hours on low.  I think that was a bit too long, because the chicken had almost all but dissolved into the sauce.  I will make this again because it's really simple, but I'm going to play around with the sauce.

This is my go-to crockpot recipe. it's super tasty and very inexpensive. I buy the thighs or legs skinned because I hate that process. I double the sauce and throw in fingerling potatoes and carrots right in with it. Everyone loves it!!

This is a good, simple recipe. Is it gourmet? No. Is it great for a weekday meal when no one feels like cooking? Yes. I used quality soy sauce and this was not salty at all. I used boneless chicken breast and added some carrots, cooked on low for about 5 hours. I pulled the chicken out, broke it into chunks. Meanwhile, I mixed a little cornstarch and water added it to the sauce to thickened it. I then tossed the chicken back in, turned the crock off and let it mingle for a bit. We ate this over brown rice and both enjoyed it. This is easy, good, and hearty - things that don't come together very often. Try it, but be careful using cheapy soy sauce as it may turn this into something way to salty.

WOW is this chicken ever juicy! I used two chicken legs and tweaked the sauce slightly to taste: a can of tomato soup, 1/3c soy sauce, 1/2c brown sugar & 1tsp each garlic powder, dried ginger, pepper and chili flakes. After the chicken was done and removed from the crock pot, I thickened the sauce with a bit of corn starch. End result? A very different, but amazingly good chicken recipe that couldn't be easier. The sauce was so good that I've got the leftover sauce in the fridge to use on a pork tenderloin tomorrow night!

This recipe was such a hit with my hubby!! I tried it with a whole chicken, since the bones come apart easy it turned out horrible we had to sit there picking the bones out. But it's sooo good. I've made this a few times already. I use half of the brown sugar it calls for though and it still was amazing.

This recipes is great! I do not have a slow cooker and just followed the recipe and placed everything in a large skillet in the oven for two hours on 175C and it turned out great. I did add a bit of chili paste to spice it up a bit. I will definitely make this recipe again.

My husband and I really enjoed this recipe.  The kids thought it was okay.  The chicken was extremely tender, but the sauce could have used just a little something extra.  I think I might try adding a little grated fresh ginger, a little extra brown sugar and a little bit of crushed red pepper next time for a little bit of a "bite".  It was pretty yummy as is though.

I made this recipe and my family LOVED it!  I served it and the sauce over brown rice.  I like a sweeter sauce so I added equal parts of brown sugar and soy.  When the chicken was finished cooking I poured the sauce into a pan, put it on the stove and thickened it with a cornstarch slurry.  It was great!  Next time I think I will add some ginger root to spice it up a little & try some boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of legs.  Great busy mom recipe.

This chicken was SO good! We added just a couple chunks of ginger which really gave it a kick. I was a little apprehensive about the combination of soy and tomato but was I ever pleasantly surprised!! So delicious and the sauce, though runny, stuck to the rice and tasted just wonderfully. I used chicken breasts and cooked on high for about 4 hours and it was tender and delicious. We'll definitely be making this again!

The flavors were odd together.  My children, who are not picky eaters, didn't like the chicken.  And, it was ready in the crockpot in less than 8 hours, so the chicken tasted very overcooked!  I was hopeful, but disappointed!

Huge hit with the kids! I doubled the sauce but only used 3/4 cup of soya sauce. I also used the onions, herbs and spices flavored tomato sauce and substituted chicken thighs for drumsticks. Everyone wants this again!

My family enjoyed this recipe (including my picky toddler!).  I dredged the chicken in flour and the sauce came out nice a nice consistency.  I noticed some reviewers found this recipe salty, I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was not too salty at all.  I also did not cook it for as long as the recipe indicated, if I had it would have been a burnt mess.  I cooked it for 5.5 hours on low, the meat fell right off the bone.  I cooked it for 30 minutes more and it was perfect.

I was hesitant to add the tomato sauce at first..but the flavors meshed well & the chicken was wonderfully delicious! I baked the drumsticks in the oven & will try the crockpot next time, maybe even change it up and use breasts and or thighs.

Im sad I had hopes that this was going to taste way better.  It smelled good while cooking but that taste was off.  I dont know if it was the type of soy sauce I used but I didnt care for this recipe.  I have to say it did atleast make chicken moist and fall right off the bone when like I like it

Love this recipe! I have made it twice now, once using the flour and the second time omitting it. My entire family (even a picky toddler) liked it better w/out the flour. I have added this into my monthly rotation. It is yummy!

This was good and easy. I wanted the sauce to be a bit sweeter so I added a couple more spoon fulls of sugar at the end. Also it was very watery so i thickened it with cornstarch. The chicken was falling off the bone after 7 hours, so I picked all the meat off the bones and put it back in the sauce. It made alot so I froze most of the leftovers.

The gravy/sauce came out really runny instead of thick. I would probably use cornstarch in it for next time because the flavor was really good. You don't have to use just drumsticks - chicken breasts with the bone in or a cut up fryer would work very well also.

Made the sauce as directed with a little less chicken & I used chicken tenders.  It was EASY & delicious.  I would make a great crock pot dinner its great coming home to the bulk of dinner cooked already!!  Whip up & a yummy steamed veggie & the family will think you slaved all day.  I would double sauce if I used more chicken or I suppose I could season the rice with something yummy too.

This was a good, basic recipe.  I prepared it with bone in legs that I skinned.  I think I woud prefer it with boneless thighs or breasts and I would reduce or thicken the sauce next time.  Good flavors, though!

This was great for an easy busy dinner night.  I upped the spices a little bit.  I also doubled the sauce because I only had the big cans of tomato sauce.  I know that when you do sauce in the crock it is usually very thin so I took the chicken out and added a sludge of corn starch and water put the pot on high, took the lid off and it thickened up nicely.  Thanks for sharing.

The meat was the "fall off of the bone" type. But the sauce just wasnt up to par. I added flour to give it thickness. Then I added cornstarch towards the end. Then the thickness was correct. But the sauce itself somehow changed while it was cooking. Also, I add cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and onions. It still tasted like it was missing, not one, but two ingredients. ...Who knows, to each is their own. I MAY make this again. Maybe the 2nd time it will be better.

Never had drumsticks in the slow-cooker. It turned out great! Fall of the bone. It was done in 4 hr.s on low. I dreged in flour and added an onion but besides that didnt change anything. I think it needed more sugar and maybe some worch but still good.

This was FABULOUS! Easy to make and the sauce was awesome over steamed rice! If you aren't into salty things I suggest using lower sodium Soy Sauce but other than that it was good and easy! Thanks so much!

What an easy YUMMY recipe! I give 4 stars only because the sauce came out so thin (kind of soup/broth like) do to the natural fat in the chicken, but it was so worth it! I will absolutely make this again, and a LOT, but doing like other reviews did and coating chicken with flour beforehand. Also, I suggest doubling the sauce amount, especially if you are going to serve it over rice and veggies. Thank you so much for this!

Very, very good!  I actually added some sriracha hot sauce to the mix and oooooooo it really gave it some kick!  Sweet, savory, and spicy all together in one dish... yum!  Took the advice of others and used low sodium soy sauce.  I also used chicken breasts and baked them rather than using the slow cooker.  Since the breasts were large, I doubled the recipe (but not the soy sauce) to fully cover them with sauce in an 8" square baking dish.  I served everything over brown rice and a side of fresh green beans.  Will make this again!

Great chicken. I made it in the oven and it still turned out great. I did add more sugar, used ketsup instead of tomato sauce. I also added worcestershire and tabasco for some kick.

I thought the flavors were pretty good.  I decided to make this in the oven instead of the crockpot.  I fried my chicken prior to baking it, so the chicken would be crispy.  Turned out very good.

I used 1/3 cup brown sugar, and it still wasn't very sweet. It was OK. It almost tasted a little burnt to me (and it shouldn't have been - I didn't cook it long enough for the chicken to fall off the bones or anything). Hubby didn't really care for it, either.

I did not make according to the recipe because I thought it would be too sweet and I don't care much for soy sauce.  I used half the brown sugar, worchestershire sauce (instead of soy), and added about 1/4 C of diced, dried onion and 3/4 t. ground black pepper.  Delicious and easy!  WITH the foregoing changes, I give this one 5 stars.  As printed, I'd probably only give it 2-3 stars.  That said, I really appreciate the recipe idea and having something to start from.  Thanks for the base recipe!

Delicious!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some drumsticks and this worked out perfectly.  Served over brown rice with stir fried cabbage, snow peas, red pepper and brocolli. By the way, I got a late start so I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it worked out just fine.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a Keeper! I steamed some rice and sauteed snow peas, carrots, and green peppers.  Then I layered the Rice, veggies, and Chicken.  There was plenty of sauce left to spoon over everything.  We enjoyed the flavor greatly!

Very simple to make and had really good flavor. I did what a previous rater said and took out some of the sauce towards the end and added corn starch to thicken it. Definitely a keeper but will use chicken breast next time around.

I liked the recipe & loved how easy it was. Doubled the ingredients of the sauce bc i had 4.5 lbs of drumsticks, it was pretty saucy, but it is ok with us. My 18 month, 2 yr & 8 yr old kids loved it & ate it all.
I do like my food with a lot more flavor so i might add something else next time (perhaps red pepper flakes)
Overall good & easy

I made this exactly as written, and it's a keeper. Perfect for a simple weeknight meal. My husband said to put it on the rotation, so it must be good.  Next time I will use a lower sodium soy sauce, but even as is, it's good. Thank you for a great meal made with pantry staples!

This was an easy recipe to low carb. Only substitution required was to use 1/8 cup of brown sugar twin and 1/8 cup of granulated stevia in place of the brown sugar.  My family LOVED IT.  If the sauce isn't thick enuf, you can remove the chicken and add guar/xanthum gum 1/4 tsp at a time with the cp on high.  I cooked the whole recipe on high for 5 hours. It fell off the bone and didn't have that weird texture I find I often get when cooking chicken in the slow cooker.

This was so surprisingly yummy and simple.  I didn't want to fry the drumsticks I purchased so I stumbled on this.  I used a quarter cup soy sauce, and I was generous with the brown sugar.  I used tomato soup because it was what I had on hand.  Wonderful recipe, Molly is onto something.

We eat a lot of chicken and a TON of crock pot meals in my home. My crock pots are my babies. This recipe stood out among many i have tried for its simplicity and spunk. With so few ingredients the chicken tasted great, was fall-off-the-bone tender, and even made great left-overs the next day. My toddler who is hesitant to eat many meats gobbled this up! Will be making again, probably soon.

Simply delicious! Added some of the sauce in a small bowl and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Returned  it back to the pot! Oh, I cooked it on the stovetop since I didn't have to work today on simmer.... Perfect over brown rice!

I did not like this whatsoever. I couldn't eat this because of how it tasted! I don't think tomato sauce and soy sauce should go together.

I love this recipe and because of the salt in the soy and the depth of the brown sugar and tomato sauce and fresh garlic, there was no need to season the chicken. It was a great meal served over brown rice and my  15 yr old ate it, and she doesnt eat anything unless it's cereal or fastfood.  thanks!

I made this last night with bone in chicken legs and drumsticks. After reading previous reviews I also dredged the chicken in flour prior to cooking. I also added onions, carrots and some left over teriyaki/sesame marinade with the tomato sauce. I served this over white rice and the sauce was thin but was really good with the rice. My family and I liked the results, it was very easy and I will probably make this again.

I couldn't even finish it. The flavor profile is quite bland and not very appetizing. I wouldn't make it again. It was very simple, though, and would probably do okay with picky kids.

Not bad, not great! The chicken was very tender but the flavour was okay. Also, as the sauce is so dark it's hard to get all the bones out once the chicken stars to fall off.

It is just okay.  I too was surprised by all the high ratings.  It is extremely easy to make, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the flavors just don't work.  Most likely will not make this again.

My family and I did not care for this at all. It was way too salty. I had to pitch it all out. We couldn't even finish dinner. The only thing I changed was using boneless skinless chicken breasts, but I doubt that would make much of a difference.

What an interesting, tasty flavor!  To me, it was a cross between mole and barbecue.  I swapped the tomato sauce for tomato paste, since I had no sauce on hand.  It made the sauce way too thick in the end, so I will make sure I have tomato sauce on hand next time.  I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Like I said, it was a great flavor and definitely something I will be making again.  So easy!  After dinner, I took the remaining legs and stripped them of the meat.  I put the meat in a container, scooped out all of the extra sauce from the crock pot and mixed it in with the chicken and shredded it real good.  I served it on egg rolls today and it was equally as delicious!

The first time I tried this recipe it was a little salty (could have been the brand of soy sauce I used) so the second time I just added 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1/4 cup because I felt like it needed a more balanced flavor. Sure enough, it's just what it needed. Yum!

I am giving this a 4 because I changed the ingredients a little. I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and I didn't have tomatoe sauce so I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also put in 1 Tbsp of flour with the brown sugar to thicken the sauce. It wasn't appetizing to look at but the flavor was great. Served with rice, it's a good meal. Thanks for sharing.

This was suprisingly VERY good. The flavor is very light and not too tomatoey like I thought it would be. Very easy recipe, threw it in the crockpot the night before, in the morning before I left for work gave it a stir and turned it on low. When I got home the meat was falling of the bone tender. I don't think I had 1/4 cup of brown sugar but it was still good.

I'm seriously surprised at all the great reviews. I did exactly what the recipe said and this is the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. I might try it again with half the soy sauce and maybe twice the brown sugar.  But Molly apparently would enjoy a salt lick as well.

This was fantastic!!!!My 3 and 5 yr old gladly ate this. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and legs. I did add a little more sugar, but don't think it really needed it. I will definitely be making this again. Great recipe!! Thanks!

I made this chicken today, and both my fiance and I thought it was delicious (and he doesn't really prefer chicken legs)! I did dredge the thawed chicken legs  in flour prior to putting them in the pot, and added more brown sugar as per my sweet tooth...I also threw in a little basil and used 3 cloves of garlic and cooked on low for about 4 1/2 hours. My pot runs a little hot so I knew it wouldn't take 8 hours. The meat slid right off the bone and I thought the sauce and its consistency was perfect. I served it with mashed potatoes (which I knew would go well with the sauce, and I was right) and sauteed asparagus. Really, really great!

Very tasty. Sauce is a bit bbq-like w/an Asian flair. There were a few adjustments: I did not have tomato sauce, so just used Ragu traditional spaghetti sauce, I coated the chicken w/flour, and I used boneless skinless chicken breast. The only negative, is that it was just a little too salty, and the next time I will use a low sodium soy sauce to offset. Also, my bad, this was an after church meal so I cooked it on high for ~ 4 hours, and the next time I'll probably start checking it after 3.

I used boneless chicken breasts that I had and set the crockpot on high since I started late.  I think next time I will dredge in flour as others recommended and use a little more brown sugar.  I'd also like to add a little kick and therefore will add a little crushed red pepper to the mix.  My chicken was a little dry (next time will use legs), but that seems to be a theme with me.  Overall everyone like it.

This was great and super easy.  My guests asked for the recipe.  One suggestion though, I would use low-sodium soy sauce, or possibly a little less soy sauce next time. It was a little salty.

My husband and I are so excited about this dish.! Delicious!  I did the same as other reviewers and doubled the brown sugar, used low sodium soy, and added carrots and onions.  I only had pork chops on hand but they were the best pork chops I have made yet!  Thanks for sharing!

I don't give 5 stars easily and this is definitely a big 4. I made it exactly as per the recipe and all the family loved it (apart from one moody teenager). Even our fussy three-year-old wolfed it down and it's on my 'to do again' list. Very nice, thanks for sharing.

This chicken was good.  I expected more flavor, but I will make this recipe again because it is so quick and easy.

This was my 1st crock pot meal and it turned out EXCELLENT!! I followed the advice of others and floured the chicken before putting it into the crockpot and the sauce turned out perfect not thin at all. I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup ( equal parts soy sauce and sugar) i used low sodium soy sauce and definately did'nt find the dish too be too salty. Served with rice and steamed veggies, family loved it. I will definately be making this again , thank you for the great recipe :)

Very quick, Very Easy, Very good... I follow the recipe except added sweet onion and cooked on high for 5 hours came out great even my 3 year old liked it. (that's saying something) After it was done I did take some of the sauce and add cornstarch to it to make a gravy for the chicken and mashed potatoes. Will be making this again soon. Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Great chicken recipe for the slowcooker and easy on the budget.  I doubled the sauce and we put the sauce on rice and vegetables as well as the chicken.  I saw the complaints about the thinness of the sauce so I added some cornstarch during the last 30 minutes of cooking and turned it up to high.  This did the trick to thicken the sauce.  I also found that the chicken only needed about 5-6 hours on low to cook.  I cooked it about 5:30 and it was falling off the bone.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it tasted salty.  Next time, I'll cut down a little on the soy sauce (make sure you use the low sodium kind) and use more brown sugar.  I will definitely be making this easy recipe again.

Very good and easy to make. I made this into a dump recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written other then I used thighs and Splenda brown sugar. I dumped all the ingredients into a freezer bag and froze. When I was ready to make it, I thawed in fridge. I didn't make mine in the crock pot but put it in a pan and cooked it on the grill for an hour and 10 minutes. Very good. My whole family enjoyed it.

This is so good. I too, used legs and thighs. I already had them out and ready to go for tonight's diner. It's just the two of us now so I had two legs and two thighs for this. The one thing I did change was the tomato sauce to crushed tomatos. I like the taste of tomato rather than juice. Most of my recipes I use crushed tomato. This was VERY good. My rule of thumb is first try a recipe exactly how it is writen. From there I can modify to our taste. This way I know how my family likes meals. I always give the person who took the time to write their recipe a try. Only seems fair. This is very good like I said. Will make this again. I will share this with others. Well worth at least once.

I didn't care for the flavor of the chicken.  I think it was to much soy sauce.  But the sauce was great on rice.  It was the first time I've been able to get my 4 year old to eat rice!

What a disappointment.  I followed the directions, except added carrots and onions to the crock pot like others suggested.  After 6 hours on low, everything was tender, but the smell was funky and the taste wasn't right either.  The carrots and onions tasted like stew veggies out of place in an asian recipe, and the sauce just wasn't that great.  My fiance and I agree; we won't make this one again.

This recipe was so simple to make and was really tasty.  I made it using boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a can of diced tomatoes.  My whole family loved it served over rice.

This worked MUCH better than I thought it would. The meat fell off of the bone, and the sauce was not weird (trust me, the tomato sauce scared me too!), and it definitley had an Asian twist to it. I served over stir-fried rice and veggies, and everyone loved it. My husband wants me to use breasts instead of legs next time, so this meal will definitley be used again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was great....
My 18month old had 3 helpings with rice.
The only things I would change is not so much soy, I also added Shredded cheese and Almonds... 
A TRUE family pleaser...
Thanks

I made this chicken for my parents and my boyfriend. It was ready after 6.5 hrs on high in the slow cooker. Everyone loved it! The meat was so soft and tender and flavorful. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar as recommended by other reviewers. This is a keeper!

this was good, but a little too sweet for my taste. I don't have a slow cooker so i cooked it over the stove. I first fried the chicken in 2tbsp oil just until the juices ran clear and then proceeded with the rest of the recipe instructions. i covered it and let it simmer for 30mins. And then uncovered for another 10mins for the sauce to thicken and dry up a bit. I did add a can of mushrooms, some basil, a tbsp of lemon  juice and a pinch of chili flakes for an extra kick to sweetness of the dish; then i served it over green beans and chopped carrots. yummy!

We enjoyed this easy recipe that made the whole loft smell great, but I plan to tweak it more because it was definitely salty.  This time, I de-skinned the drumsticks and dredged them in flour, which kept the chicken moist and gave the sauce a great consistency.  I also added some diced ginger up front and very thinly sliced carrots about 40 minutes before turning off the slow cooker.  I cooked on high for 2.5 hours and then on low for about another 2.  Serving it on brown rice was delicious.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce - and less of it.  To keep the right amount of liquid, I may substitute some broth for about 1/2 the soy sauce.  Some fresh ginger for zip was good too - this time, I used only about 1 Tablespoon, which got a bit lost.  Next time, I would double it (we are ginger people, others might not like this flavor). Overall, the consistency and flavor were great.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

I can see how children would really enjoy this recipe. Myself, I found the sauce too sweet. It could do with some chilli & less sugar. Very quick & easy to put together though.

I made this tonight and made a few changes. I used honey and molasses to counter the tartness of the tomato sauce. Also, I added 1/4 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. allspice. I cooked on high for 2 hours and turned to low for 2 more hours and it fell off the bone. Very good!

I used thawed chicken and followed the recipe. It just didn't work for me, it wasn't tender and falling apart like others said it did, in fact it was a bit on the tough side. I didn't like it. Hubby liked it okay. I wont make it again.

This was really good!  The kind of recipe that I need with two kids in school that are involved in sports and a toddler at home!  I used both skinless legs and thighs, upped the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and cooked on high for 4 1/2 hrs.  I removed the chicken from the crockpot, added some cornstarch to the sauce and cooked on high for 15 minutes.  The sauce was great served over the chicken and rice.  The chicken was SOOO tender...just how we like it!  This is a keeper :)

On my nine-year-old son's night to cook supper he decided to try this recipe. While the short list of ingredients and ease of preparation make it a 5-star, the salty soy sauce overwhelmed the taste of chicken and the other ingredients made the family's comments range from "bland" to "odd." Sorry, this recipe is a no-go.

4/16/19...This recipe was very tasty for Asian style chicken. I followed the recipe but did make some changes as suggested by others. I used 6 drums sticks, about 3/4 cup soy sauce,  1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. minced garlic, (1) 8oz. can Tomato sauce, 1 cup chicken broth,  6-10oz canned mushrooms, chopped up green onions,  1 Tbsp. ground Ginger,  small package whole baby carrots, and extra water to cover chicken, I did end up adding  3 Tbsp. corn starch to thicken, because it seems too watery at the end of cooking. Cooked on low for 6 hours but it was done in 5 hours. Pulled the chicken off the bone and shredded and served on top of white rice with and Asian Medley Vegetables and baked potato's and home made dinner rolls. Delicious!!

Made it a week ago. Midweek, snowing outside, had no energy to do time consuming cooking. I went online and found this recipe. I used 3 drumsticks and 3 breast halves sliced in half long-ways. I used tomato paste instead of sauce. It was a little more watery than I would have preferred but after reading some reviews prior to fixing, I saw that some felt it was watery. I had that in mind as I prepared the paste to replace the sauce. I didn't dilute it as much. It turned out very, very tasty. It had much more flavor than I expected. My 90 year old mother and 2 grand children live here, 9 and 10.   They are the worst eaters in the world and they both liked it. My mom also thought it was very good and she is particularly critical of any sauce or gravy that would have any spicy flavor to it.  We will be making it again. I have already been asked when I am fixing it again and that is the best recommendation I could pass on. Thank you for sharing.

I made using the same ingredients, but I did double the sauce and added lots more carrots, (I was out of potatoes) grated ginger and lemon juice for a bit of a tang. I did thicken the sauce with a slurry made up of a 1/4 cup of water and 1 heaping Tablespoon of cornstarch. I used cornstarch because it remains clear and does not make the sauce whitish or opaque. Also I did double the sauce so if you don't double it use less cornstarch or it will be jelly.

Just made this today and it was very good.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and added some cornstarch to tighten up the sauce.  Definately on my make again list!

I was very dubious about this recipe as there are so few ingredients. However it turned out great, I used 4 chicken breasts & a 500g carton of tomato sauce & a couple of meat substitute breasts. The result was like a smoky barbecue taste. we loved it, though my seven year old is yet to be converted. Thanks ??

I didn't use a slow cooker, I cooked it on the hob & added the cooked chicken about 30 minutes before serving.

I used drumsticks(skin on), dredged in flour. I found the 1/2C.  soya sauce too much. It made the dish taste more like Teriyaki; not a favorite of mine. There was also far too much sauce; unless you used it to pour over rice or noodles. Next time I will use only half of what is called for.

Followed the recipe exactly, but there was something off about it. My family did not like at all... but the dogs loved it. We had Chipotle for dinner.

I made this recipe but used teriyaki sauce (less salt and goes nicely with the brown sugar), a large squirt of ketchup for flavor, and added flour to thicken the sauce! I also used chicken breast instead of drum sticks. Turned out great over rice and plan on making it this way again! Quick and easy.

Easy to make and tasted good.  Simple recipe=simple food.  The recipe was described as easy and it was. I didn't expect anything to knock my socks off but was pleasantly pleased with this easy dish.

I cooked this on high heat for 6 hours and it was probably done in 5. I shredded the legs because they were falling off the bone and that worked well. I doubled the sauce and added extra brown sugar. I wanted to add some vegi to it so I lightly steamed some fresh broccoli and added it to the crock pot about 30 min. before serving.  Also, I used some corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit. My picky 18 month old liked it and my hubby also liked it, I thought it was missing something.  

I like this dish because you can make it on a budget which is necessary for my family. The legs were on sale for 84 cents a pound so this dish was very affordable and very easy to make.

I used the proportions of the recipe ingredients in original, only addition was 1/2 tsp ground ginger and I did dredge the chicken in flour before cooking  as suggested by other reviewers.  I browned the chicken in my slow cooker before adding the sauce.  I thought the thickness of the sauce was fine and it was tasty but just okay.  The amount of sauce was good for the amount of chicken.   I would have liked a sauce with a stronger taste.  I did not find it too sweet or too salty (as others have said).

I made this with half the soy sauce and brown sugar & used garlic powder for convenience. I added sliced carrots & some sliced mushrooms which went in the last hour. Oh, and I floured the chicken before placing in the slow cooker. This came out very tasty. Not too salty & with the right hint of sweetness for my husband & me. I cooked it on high for 3 hours en switched to low for another hour. The meat was very tender. Good recipe! I don't think I'd like it so much without he changes though. This had more of an Italian flavor than Asian, as the tomato comes through more with less soy sauce.

My family and friends loved this served with white sushi rice - but I added sugar because the sauce was thin and salty. I notice others reported the same so next time I make it I'll continue with added sugar and maybe some flour to thicken. Also think it would do well with some water chestnuts.....

Made this tonight with a few tweaks. I used tomato paste, instead of tomato sauce  - this definitely helped with the thinness. I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce. And I added about 1/4 cup of ketchup.This cut the saltiness for us. All 3 of my men inhaled this and claimed it was one of the best  chicken dinners ever!

This was really good! I followed the recipe except I did not remove the skin first, and it was just fine that way. The skin comes off a lot easier after cooking. This took nowhere near 8 hours to cook, however. It was done at 4 hours but I left it on for 5. I will definitely make this again.

Yum! My fiancÃ© and I made this tonight and it was really good. I used pizza sauce instead and two tablespoons of minced garlic, carrots, and a sliced onion as well. My fiancÃ© made rice to put it on top of. It fell right off the bone and shredded like a sloppy joe. Will make again!

Loved this recipe. I gave it four stars because I think the cooking time may be too long, kind of dries out the chicken. I used legs and thighs. I also added in some splashes of Louisiana hot sauce for a little kick. I will make again with a couple of alterations.

Great recipe!  SUPER easy, few ingredients, wonderfully tender.  I just made over the weekend for family gathering where I didn't want to be stuck in kitchen.  Everyone loved it.  My kids love it and ask for it often.  We serve with rice, use the juice for sauce on rice and a crisp salad...a perfectly easy and economical meal!

marking 4 stars because I did not follow recipe exact, as I was out of a few key ingredients. used this as a base for my drumsticks. Also read some reviews to see the changes that have been made to make the recipe work best with what I had on hand. I substituted the brown sugar for white, and increased to 1/2 c for the added sweetness. I also added canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, as i was out. I enjoy tomatoes with chicken, so I thought it would be a nice touch. I had a little rum on hand, so I added it in for a bit of a kick, and also added some pineapples as many reviews mentioned it was a great addition. Normally I do not change a recipe from the start until after I had a change to try as indicated, but I had no brown sugar and no tomato sauce. family LOVED it with the changes.

I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and added a few dashes of ginger and cinnamon. I also chose to leave the skin on, and put the drumsticks through flour as others were saying to do. Everything turned out great and tender. It was just perfect and not too salty (which I thought it was going to be!). Definitely making this again!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. Making it with chicken thighs would be good also. I didn't think it was too salty or sweet. Just right. The chicken fell right off the bone, and very little trouble to get off what didn't. With brown rice and the sauce over it......awesome! About an hour before it was done, I put about 1/2 of the broth in a glass measuring cup and after it cooled down a bit and added 2 Tablespoons of corn starch to it and poured it back into crock and stirred so sauce would thicken. YUM, YUM !!! This recipe is great for people on a budget that want a awesome, satisfying, flavorful home cooked meal. It's a KEEPER. Thanks so much for the recipe cookieluvr1. Cindy

Not great. The soy sauce flavor was way too strong for my liking and the chicken was very dry. I think the suggested cook time was way too long.

Molly's chicken is definitely a staple meal in my house. I use just the thighs,my son's choice. I doubled the recipe, because I use the max pack of chicken thighs. I make brown rice. I also add vegetables, eg. baby carrots, or mixed vegetables.

I made this exacty as the recipe was written and I felt like it is really easy.  We ate it but it had no flavor.  I was really disappointed after reading all the great reviews. I won't be making this again.

You definitely need to eat this with rice. It's really salty without it. I would definitely remake this with much less soy sauce. I had kimchi and avocado as my sides. If you are picky with the smell of your food then be cautious of this one. Otherwise an ok dish.

Great recipe- I doubled the sauce, but it ended up being too salty.  I'll definitely double it EXCEPT the soy sauce next time.

Delicious! Cooking time is way too long. I used chicken legs with skin removed. Mine was done in 5 hours. I added a bit of flour, a 1/4 cup extra brown sugar and about 2T ketchup. The sauce was not runny at all. Perfect!

This recipe seemed great at first read, because it contained so few ingredients (meaning easy!) While the flavor was pretty good, the cook time was much too long for the drumsticks. Ours came out way overcooked. I would reduce the cook time in the slow cooker to 6 hours (maximum!) on low, and remove promptly from the heat afterward.

This was delicious. I used 6 drumsticks and one small can of tomato paste because that was all I had in the house, to this I added one can of water. Next time I will get in the proper ingredients and follow exactly as written.

I fixed this for myself and my hubby three weeks ago.  He loved it so much that I repeated it last night for nine people (with 4 teens) with lots of kudos.  This time I added 2 sliced onions and it was delicious.  Next time, I'm going to add mushrooms...This is a keeper.

Very easy to make, the family seems to like it a lot.  I used a slotted spoon to take out the legs (yes the meat was falling off the bone) I used 1/2 cup sugar because I was doubling the recipe and it wasn't enough...  Maybe just a bit more but no one would think of that but me.  I'll make it again.  Thanks cookieluvr1!

I'd like to say that I kind of messed up.  I purposefully cut up a vidalia onion and a bunch of carrots to put under the chicken.  It was hot today and I didn't want to deal with the stove or grill.  I placed the chicken (2 pounds of skinless thighs) on top of the veggies and decided to double the sauce to serve over egg noodles. By mistake I opened a can of diced Italian tomatoes instead of the sauce.  I put those in the sauce and then also put an 8 oz can of tomatoe sauce, too.  I thought it was very good, particularly for the ease of the recipe.  Picky son ate it up. Te chicken was very tasty and tender! I think next time I will add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and I will cut back a bit on the soy sauce.  I think this would be equally good with stew beef or pork.  Thanks, Molly.

The was delicious!! I used more brown sugar and less soy sauce than was called for (due to the reviews that said it was too salty and I tend to be sensitive), but I did add a little salt in while it was warming. I also added chopped onions and shredded carrots and served over white rice. Will definitely make this again! I will probably add more veggies next time to amp up the nutrition... I think celery would be perfect in this. Yum!!

We cook this all the time, sometimes we use slight alterations in the spices and it always comes out great. We give the 5 star rating to the recipe as it was originally written! This is almost fool proof.

All but the 3 year old loved this recipe. (6 year old and 12 yr old gave it a thumbs up!) It was so easy and flavorful, we will be making it again and again. I love that I have the ingredients on hand and to be honest, I think it tasted even BETTER the second day. MMMMMMM Thank you for sharing, we love kid-friendly tasty recipes!

This chicken was so easy to make, and was very tasty! I made it as-is, and the sauce was thin like other reviewers said, but that didn't bother me. It cooked in only 7 hours. The second time I made this I actually added some frozen stir-fry veggies the last 1/2 hour of cooking, and served it all over rice. Very good!

What an easy recipe!  I had all of the ingredients in my pantry so it was simple to put together. I used bone-in thighs instead of drumsticks and dredged it in flour with salt/pepper before I placed them in the pot.  It was hit at dinner.

This is a great recipe - I wanted a simple chicken recipe to use in my brand new slow cooker and trie dthis because my daughter's name is also Molly.   It was absolutely delicious and (my) Molly demanded seconds!   I added some green beans to the recipe as well, it worked very well.

What a mess! I followed this recipe to a 'T' and it dried out in my slow cooker.  The liquid sauce turned to a solid and stuck to the inside of my slow cooker. Furthermore, the chicken was dry and super salty tasting. DO NOT MAKE!

With the great reviews I was excited to make this meal but I was disappointed. It wasn't bad but the taste didn't suit me. It was too sweet and the mix of soy sauce and tomato sauce just didn't mix well.

chicken was fall off of the bone tender, but sauce was way to salty. maybe a 1/4 soy sauce would be better.

I pan-fried this because I don't own a slow cooker, but it turned out great and only took about 30 minutes including prep time.  The tomato and brown sugar were a very interesting combo.

I wouldn't add carrots as some reviews suggested.  I found them too salty.  I did use a can of tomato soup and covered the chicken in flour.

Chicken was tender, but that was the only good part.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  The sauce was watery and the flavor was just wrong.  I won't make it again.

very very salty....had to add 3 times the amount of sugar to offset the salt when I tasted the sauce. I dredged the chicken in flour to thicken the sauce and served over rice...probably will not make this again..Now it taste like a weird bbq sauce.

This recipe was super easy and yummy! I made some substitutions though.....instead of tomato sauce I used ketchup, the teryaki sauce, brown sugar and garlic. Cooked really fast on low in the slow cooker was ready in about 4 hours. I used chicken thighs...did I mention yummmy thanks!

I made the chicken sepearte and used this recipe for the glaze.  It had a pretty good flavor, but felt like it needed something more to give it 5 stars.

This recipe is very easy and tasty! I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I used a can of tomato soup.  otherwise I made exactly as directed.  My 2 year old loved it  It is very hard to find a chicken recipe that she will eat as well as us.

I am not sure what is off about the sauce - probably the combination of the tomato sauce with soy sauce?  Plus, it was too sweet and too salty - a strange combination that just didn't equalize each other out.  I made the state amount of sauce and we had to throw half of it out!  The 2 stars was for introducing me to cooking drumsticks this way.  Wow - so tender!  This will ALWAYS be the way I cook drumsticks now, just with another sauce in another recipe!

At first taste, I did not like it but didn't hate it enough to toss it.  To my suprise, the longer it sits, the more I like it.  It is fall off the bone tender.  It have a very strong flavor and smell.  I would make this again but I think I would just add a little less soy sauce.  Maybe more brown sugar.  Just a taste preference.  I also didn't pill the skin off.  It was tasty to me!

For convenience and taste, you can't beat this recipe!  Combined suggestions from multiple other reviews, and made the following tweaks.  Used light soy.  Salt & peppered the drumsticks.  Kept skin on them, but browned them well in some olive oil (so my cooking time in the crockpot is reduced) before transferring to the crockpot.  Cooked 1 hour on high.  Then 1 hour on low.  Added onion, carrots & potatoes.  Finished up 1 more hour on low.  Served over jasmine rice with green beans for a side.  Chicken was every bit as fall-off-the-bone tender and the family gobbled it up!  This will be a staple weeknight go-to for sure!

Excellent.  I cooked on med/high for 6 hours and it really did fall off the phone.  Just served over white rice with the remaining sauce.  Great heated up too.

Very easy, and very flavorful.  I read most of the reviews and planned on dredging the chicken in flour as most people suggested, but then I forgot.  It doesn't really matter; we didn't really want a gravy to go with it and we still liked it.  Very easy, and a good combo.  We let it cook for probably about 10 hours, but we used an entire large chicken, so that accounts for the difference.  Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce is nice, but I think the cooking time is probably too long.  I cooked a combination of FROZEN boneless breasts and chicken legs for 7 hours and it was overcooked.  My crock does not run hot, like the newer ones do.  Other reviewers had success on high for three hours, so that may be the key.  The kids liked the sauce though!

I made this recipe as written.  It was good, but was lacking something, the chicken was falling off the bone but I thought the sauce needed a little more pizazz.  I would try it again, maybe using more brown sugar this time.

I made this with thighs, threw it in the cooker and left.  Was in a hurry and spent about 5 minutes on it which is great for a workday.  Everyone liked it and it hardly has any ingredients.  Tasted great.  I had mine with rice, someone else had theirs plain, and someone else here had theirs rolled up in a tortilla with cheese so everyone was happy.

This is a great recipe, and it was quite the crowd pleaser. However, I did learn that this is not a recipe that can be made with FROZEN chicken. I made this mistake the second time I made this recipe, and by the time the chicken was done, the sauce was so watered down it was horrible. It is fantastic as long as your chicken is THAWED!!

This chicken was nice and tender, but I found the sauce to be a bit too tomato-y. Next time I might add some honey and some red pepper flakes for a little heat. I coated my chicken in flour and the sauce was perfect, not too thin at all. Mine was done (and falling off the bone) after 6 hours.

This is a tough one for me to rate ... I made it just as the recipe states, but took the recommendation of some other reviews and (1.) used low-sodium soy sauce and (2.) increased brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I probably would have given this three stars, but my husband really liked it, so I've given it four.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just needs something.  The chicken was very moist and falling off the bone, but the sauce was sort of bland.  Next time, I think I will try to make it with less sugar to see if has a stronger, better flavor.

We don't usually eat dark chicken, but I decided to make this recipe for tonight because was simple and I didn't have much time. I was skeptical at first but this dish was so good, there were no leftovers my kids LOVED it! Here is how I made it: I browned the chicken first then sautÃ©ed garlic and 1/2 onion and transferred everything to the crockpot. I only used 1/4 cup of light soy sauce to avoid sodium, then added a little of water to make extra sauce. It was delicious! Served with basmati brown rice and steamed carrots and brocoli.

This is the only way I will make drumsticks in the slow cooker now.  I followed the suggestion of others and dredged my chicken in flour with salt and peper.  I also added half an onion, sliced and also a can of Diced tomotaoes and green chilies for some texture.  I cooked on high for 4 hours then like an hour on low and it was soooo good!!  I took the leftover meat off the bone and the next day ate the meat and sauce mixture over rice.  I am trying this recipe tonight with chicken brest to try to save that step next time.  Best use of Chicken Drumsticks!!!

This was an easy, quick and very yummy recipe~~  Followed the simple directions and added another viewer's suggestion to dredge the chicken in flour prior to placing in the crock pot.  The sauce was not thin and divine.  This recipe will be a keeper for sure.

This was really good. It's definitely not gourmet, but my boyfriend and I easily ate the 6 drumsticks we used, and sadly had no leftovers. The only changes I made were to use diced tomatoes since thats what I had and to coat the chicken in flour. Next time I think I'll thicken the sauce a little more, but it was great as is! We ate it over rice and I can't wait to make it again.

this was pretty good considering how inexpensive and easy it was. i added some frozen green beans and some sliced carrots. i would suggest adding some ginger and some crushed red pepper flakes for added flavor.

Delicious! I doubled the brown sugar and used teriyaki/soy sauce. The chicken was falling off the bones and the flavor was perfect! Served over long grain wild rice with veggies.

Very easy, really good.  A bit too salty but reduced sodium soya sauce probably would have helped that.

This recipe was good, but not my favorite. Getting the skin off of the drumsticks took a lot of time. I enjoyed the chicken at first, but I didn't like the leftovers that much.

The taste was pretty good, but it was done cooking after 6 hours (not 8 as stated), so I had to let it sit on "warm" in the crock pot until dinner time.  By then the chicken was falling off the bone, but not over-cooked, which would have been fine on it's own.  However, because they were drumsticks, there were then little bones mixed in with the chicken that had fallen off, and this was a little scary to me.  I had to pick through everyone's plate to make sure they didn't choke on any bones.

This was fantastic!  The meat just fell off the bone.  I made a pot of linguini and used the leftover sauce and a Tb. of oil to pour over it.  It tasted almost like sesame noodles.

VERY YUMMY!  I was a bit skeptical at first due to the tomato sauce, but this turned out wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half and used 6 drumsticks - skin removed!  Cooked on high in my crockpot for just over 3 hours...the meat just fell off it was so tender!  Served with some white rice (using extra sauce!) and zuch/pepper/mushroom combo.  Excellent!

I actually really liked this. I was a bit skeptical but I tried it anyway. I did use boneless breasts, and coated them lightly in flour first like some previous posters said. I put it in my slow cooker for 4 hours on high and it was really yummy. I love the salty/sweet mixture, and it's excellent with rice and a more bitter veggie like brussels sprouts or asparagus.

I can't say enough good things about this chicken! It is so wonderful and SO easy! I didn't change anything and it was perfect! My husband had the HARDEST time waiting for dinner. I served it with broccoli over rice. I will be making this very often!

Found this recipe quite boring actually.  Smelled great cooking, but the chicken had surprisingly very little flavor.  Ended up using the chicken in a recipe or chicken pot pie.

This was a fantastic and super easy main dish!  The chicken was falling off the bones, and we had plenty for leftovers.  I gave some away, and my husband got on to me until I showed him we still had 4 legs or so left for him.  I did have to cook it on high for a little while, because (of course, lol) the power went off for a little bit, and I had to compensate for time, but it turned out wonderfully.  Will definately be making this again!

this was just ok. I'm a BIG fan of soy sauce and it was too much for me! (Trust me--i RARELY say anything is too salty!!)
Ran out of lite soy sauce so I used 1/2 lite, 1/2 regular. Next time I will add more brown sugar and less soy sauce to counter the saltiness. Used bone-in/skin-in chicken breasts and coated them in flour like suggested. Next time I will use boneless/skinless--definitely not worth the time to de-bone!! Served with white rice and stir-fried veggies.

This was great! I traded drumsticks for chicken breast, browned chicken first and made in the electric skillet.

I loved this recipe, my husband thought is was good, my daughters (ages 4 and 1) only ate the veggies I put in.  I used 6 chicken drumsticks, fresh baby carrots, and some mushrooms.  I cut the sauce measurements in half, and added a little chicken broth.  Very tasty and so easy!  Even great as leftovers!  I will make this again!

This recipe was good. It was way too salty...and I like salt. Next time I will use reduced sodium soy sauce. I did not find this recipe to be too sweet and I used a little extra brown sugar. Overall this was yummy and the chicken fell off the bone!

We thought this was prety good.  I used chicken breasts and they turned out fork tender.

This turned out pretty yummy and pretty inexpensive to make too.  Only thing I changed was to add some honey.  It didn't seem sweet enough.  My toddler thought the idea of a drumstick was great and willing ate his chicken (result!).

This was really good, and I enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe. I used low sodium soy sauce, and seasoned the drumsticks liberally with coursely ground black pepper. I'll be making this recipe again.

Very good recipe. And it's quick in the crockpot, I cooked mine on high for about 4 hours. I used thinly sliced chicken breasts as that's all I had on hand. Left all the other ingredients the same and it turned fantastic.  I served mine over rice.

This is a very easy and quick recipe for a working mom. I threw everything in my crock pot and let it cook for 4 hrs. Ate this over white rice. The flavor was lite but it was yummy!
