My kids love these. This also works with chunky peanut butter and any other sliced fruit you want to use. GREAT hands-on recipe for kids.

Excellent! I saw the words "Peanut Butter Fiend" and I knew this recipe was calling my name! I'm an admitted peanut butter addict and will eat just about anything with the ooey, gooey, nutty stuff on it. Peanut Butter and apples are a great combination in my book, but sandwich the two between some tortillas and heat them up a bit to get the peanut butter a little "melty" and well....you have yourself a really nice little treat! I sprinkled a little cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg on my apples, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

I "embellshed" the quesadilla a little by shaking some cinnamon on top of the apples and drizzling the finished quesadilla with honey as suggested by one reviewer.  Tortillas, apples, and peanut butter are ingredients I would likely always have and this is quick and easy to put together.  Thanks for the good idea!

Excellent!!! My boys loved these quesadillas. Instead of cuting the apples I just shredded it. Thanks for the recipe!

Good snack!!  Grandkids loved them.  Next time
I'm going to serve them "ELVIS STYLE" with
peanut butter, bacon & bananas.  Maybe peanut butter & nutella [chocolate] or with a little marshallow creme.  Use your imagination & have fun with this.

I loved these!  I buttered the ouside of the tortilla so it'd get crisp and golden.  I didn't measure but used about 1/2 the amount of peanut butter and apple.

I made it exactly how it asked, but when I tried it I felt like it needed a little something more. So I threw a dip togeter using a few scoops of frozen cool whip and a spoon of apple butter..a very nice touch! The boys loved it and asked for more!!

Great idea, but did not work out well.  I followed the directions but 4-6 minutes for each side was way too long and ended up burning.  It was kind of a mess to eat.  Oh and do not put honey in the filing - leave it as dipping sauce or something after it's done.  The honey thinned as the quesadilla cooked and spread all over the pan.

Who would have thunk. Peanut butter is a large staple of my diet. I make my own in a blender. 2Lbs Planters Hoeny Roasted Peanuts and 2tblsp. peanut oil (be patient, it will liquify...you dont want runny PB, so dont add more oil.) The secret is Honey Roasted peanuts

Delicious!  As one person stated - could be could for breakfast, too!  It is quick and easy to make.  I used a mandolin slicer to thinly slice my apple and it was perfect!  This will be a regular dish in my household.

I have not yet tried this, but I think it would make a good breakfast, too!  I would not be against serving it as a light dinner for kids . . .fruit, decent protein, a little starch . . . not a bad meal!

This was OK. I thought it called for way too much peanut butter, so instead I spread just about a tablespoon or so on the tortilla. Mine only took 3-4 minutes on each side on medium heat. I also tried a peanut butter banana quesadilla, and I think I prefer that to apple.

I used this in my cooking classes and they loved it! We used one tortilla, reduced the peanut butter and folded it over, then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar after grilling. Tasty!!!

I was attracted to this recipe because it was quick and simple, but my high hopes were disappointed.  I found this to not be very good at all.  I used the proportions stated and the peanut butter totally overpowered the taste of anything else.  Unlike other reviews, I found the apples got soft and somewhat mushy.  If you really love peanut butter or add more apples it might be good, but I can't say I will try this again.

Awesome! Warm peanut butter is actually really good. Potbelly's PB&J sandwich is toasted so the filling is warm. The apple adds crisp. Apple's tanginess balances the sweetness of peanut butter. Smart recipe!

Wow! This was very good and easy. I my kids enjoyed it and so did I. I used my quesadilla maker and it made it deliciously crunchy. I will definitely make this over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a stayman winesap apple and mostly just tasted peanut butter. Perhaps a different apple would have been better. I ended up drizzling the quesadilla with honey, but will probably put honey in the quesadilla next time. Also, one big quesadilla is super filling for one person! Next time, I'll just do a smaller half quesadilla by folding one tortilla in half.
