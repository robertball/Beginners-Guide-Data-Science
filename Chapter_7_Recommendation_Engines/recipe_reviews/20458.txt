For those having trouble with the corn tortillas- if you heat some of your sauce in a skillet and dip each tortilla in hot sauce just long enough to make pliable you can roll beautiful enchiladas every time.

The enchiladas were pretty good. I made two pans; one with salsa and one with enchilada sauce. the sauce definitely tasted better. Next time I will use flour tortillas and more cheese.

My husband and I cooked this together, we used flour tortillas instead of corn and we added the salsa to the chicken. Also, we substituted the salsa on the outside with a red chile enchilada sauce and added shredded cheese on top. It was great

Easy and good!  Wasn't so sure this was going to go over well with either Hubs or me - he doesn't like fresh cilantro, first of all. And for the salsa I used Salsa de Tomatillo, recipe also from this site, and I already knew he wasn't a big fan of that either.  As for me?  I used low carb tortillas, which I'ver never tried before, and I thought I'd be "cheated." It seemed like this dinner would be a bust for both of us. I used some shredded rotisserie chicken I had in the freezer and I had these assembled and in the oven in no time.  And there's cerrtainly no need to measure anything.  I didn't mix the cheese in with the chicken mixture, just threw a handful on each tortilla before rolling them up.  I especially liked the addition of the green onion and the fresh cilantro, both of which contributed great flavor as well as a freshness. To my surprise, we both loved 'em!  Hubs said he REALLY ENJOYED tonight's dinner and, for the record, I found that low carb tortillas really aren't bad!  I served them the way we like them, with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, a little extra cheese, guacamole and a plotch of sour cream (along with some zucchini I coarsely chopped and sauteed with bacon, garlic, onion, and chopped jalapeno peppers).

This Recipe was very good. I also used the enchilada sauce to pour over and used corn and flour tortillas. (The corn ones do taste a lot better.) This was very quick and easy to make and 
tasted like you slaved all day!!

This was a great recipe - quick, easy and delicious.  The best thing of all this recipe is much lower in fat than the chicken enchiladas I usually make - and we thought they tasted just as good!

DELICIOUS!! My family loved this recipe.  They couldn't wait to eat the leftovers.  Even my picky 10-year-old son loved it.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn, and enchilada sauce instead of salsa.

This is my favorite enchilada recipe.  I make one change, I use 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the salsa.  I put one can in the dish before rolling and placing the enchiladas in, and one can over the enchiladas.  So good and you can use low fat sour cream.. works fine.

These are wonderful and my whole family loves them. My Mom even begs me to make these!! I leave out the green onions and cilantro, add a tsp of Chili powder, used enchilada sauce instead of salsa, and Mexican four cheese blend instead of Cheddar cheese. Also, to make the corn tortillas [which I think taste way better than the flour ones] easier to work with I heat them wrapped in a paper towel in the microwave for about 30 seconds and dip both sides with enchilada sauce before filling.

WOW!  This is SO good.  We used enchilada sauce rather than salsa.  The whole family raved.  Love that you can freeze it too.  Thank you so much!

This was good, but I think next time I will use less cheddar cheese and top with the white cheese sauce from this site instead of salsa.

We made individual plates rather than a large dish. I dry fried the tortillas to make them more pliable and then folded over rather than rolling because they were so small and it allows me to get in more chicken and less tortilla per serving. I mixed a little of the salsa with the chicken, onion, and seasonings and warmed it all through then added to the tortillas with a little cheese. The rest of the salsa was blended with the sour cream and spread over top of the tortillas then topped with the rest of the cheese prior to baking. I used the Green Hot Sauce (Salsa Verde) recipe from here and a white cheese blend.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe with the changes recommended by many other reviewers.  I used green enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I mixed a little into the chicken mixture, then dipped each tortilla in the sauce before filling and wrapping it.  I then spooned the remaining sauce over the enchiladas and baked, topping with cheese just as I pulled it out of the oven.  It was absolutely scrumptious!  The best enchiladas I have ever eaten!  We had company over, and they kept raving about how delicious they were too, so this one's a keeper!  I will be making these often!

Wonderful basic recipe with lots of room to play with ingredients. I added a touch of lite cream cheese and used marinated chicken (white and dark meat) and a generous pinch of packaged enchilada spice mix. Assembled everything, covered it with the enchilada sauce from Anna Marie on this site, covered it in cheese and let it sit overnight. Way yummy!

This recipe was OK.  I've made better chicken enchiladas.  These were rather dry, both inside and out.  I really didn't like the corn tortillas (I should have followed other reviewers' advice about flour tortillas).  We still ate the leftovers, though.

Easy and Yummy.  The only change I made was to use enchilada sauce on the top instead of salsa.  The family enjoyed this for dinner.

The came out wonderful.  Seasoned the chicken with southwest flavoring.  Also used a little enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  My wife had it for lunch the next day.  We dont do leftovers too often.

I change the salsa to green chilie enchilada sauce and use only about half the cilantro. We thought it was just too overpowering. Very good though and my family loves these!

Good recipe, but just a tad bland for our tastes so I added a can of green chilies to the mixture along with extra spices.  I also used enchilada sauce instead of salsa to top it all off.  With the changes I made, we all all loved it and I would give it 5 stars.  Definitely a keeper, and I'll make it again.

Great recipe, my family loved it.  The only thing that I changed was the salsa, I used Enchilada sauce.  I also put about a half cup in the meat mixture.  A great way to heat up the corn tortillas is to put about 6 in between two damp papertowels and microwave for about 40 seconds.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have salsa, so I did use enchilada sauce instead (as several reviewers suggested), and it was very good.  I sprayed each flour tortilla with cannola oil spray very lightly to make sure they were moist when I rolled them,  poured the enchilada sauce over the rolled enchiladas and then spread shredded cheese over all and baked for 45 mins.  I served with sour cream and extra shredded cheese.  We all liked them.

These were pretty good.  I used flour tortillas and I used the salsa.  I added cheese about 5 minutes before I took them out of the oven.  I did think they were a little better the next day.

The filling in these enchiladas was a bit bland for me. I will probably add some other ingredients/spices next time to liven it up! I used shredded grilled chicken breast that had chipotle lime seasoning on them from a few nights before. Will try again with my own personal modifications. Thanks!

The filling was delicious, but the tortillas became too pasty. Next time I will use extra cheese on top of the enchiladas instead.

this recipe is a very good one.the only thing I would change for the next time i make it is one less chicken breast, to make the filling a little creamier and adding a can of chopped  roasted chiles . I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce as some of the other reviewers suggested and preferred it to using salsa. Great recipe, thanks!

FANTASTIC!!! These were sooo easy and sooo yummy! I reduced the amount of cheese used to help cut the fat a bit. So rather than putting the cheese inside, I sprinkled just enough ontop before baking. BIG HIT!

corn tortillas are the best for enchiladas. put a little veg oil in a skillet and warm up each tortilla before tiring to work with it. it sounds like a unneeded extra step but it will make all the difference.

I think it would have been better with the corn tortillas.  It needed some crunch.  But overall, the falvor was good.

Delicious! Best chicken enchiladas I've ever made. But I made a few changes: I sauted onion with shredded rotisseri chicken breasts, 1 small can of corn, lots of cilantro and my homemade taco seasoning. Then I added the remaing ingredients from the recipe. Four tortillas tasted much better than corn and instead of salsa, I used homemade enchilada sauce.

Try using less chicken.  The filling will not seem as dry.  I also added 1/2 cup of cream cheese to the sour cream before mixing.

These were good and pretty simple and fast to make.  I used flour tortillas (personal preference), half were regular flour ones, the other were jalapeño and cilantro flavored.  Both very good.  They turned out a bit dry, I would add more salsa or enchilada sauce next time.  I also added some black olives after baking.

This recipe is fine, but it didn't wow me. My husband, however, said he really loved it. (1) My biggest problem was the corn tortilla - almost every one kept falling apart when I tried to roll it. I don't know if it was a problem with those specific tortillas, or if that's just how corn tortillas are. It was a total pain. (2)I tried green enchilada sauce in one pan and red enchilada sauce in the other (a substitution that has been suggested by others). We all agreed the green sauce tasted much better.

I loved these enchiladas. They were a big hit at my house, and taste just as good today at lunch. I used enchilada sauce and flour torillas, as well as sprinkled some cheddar cheese and jalapenos on top for the last few minutes of baking. Scrumptious!

This is a quick and easy recipe for delicious enchiladas.  I replace corn tortillas for flour tortillas and the outcome is even better.  Definitely a favorite in my home.

this is great,easy, and flexible!  everything I love in a recipe.  to make life extra easy, use canned chx.  However, I cook it all day in crockpot on low in chx broth and shreads virtually on its own!

Enchiladas were perfect but the sauce wasn't... because it wasn't sauce but salsa. Next time I will use an Enchilada Sauce.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Definately will make it again.  It was so yummy.  But we used fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheddar cheese and carb balance tortillas to make it less fat.  They turned out awesome and were a third of the fat.

This recipe was very tasty.  I even left out the seasonings my mistake and it was still good.  I used enchilada sauce instead of the salsa.  I had to heat the tortillas in the microwave and then dip them in the sauce to prevent them from splitting.  Very good.

My family was tired of leftover turkey sandwiches from Thanksgiving and I need a new recipe.  So I substituted the chicken for turkey and it was a huge hit.  Not only was it easy to make but delicious too.  Even my highschool son who is a picky eater gobbled them up.  My first grader was a little hesitant but after his firt bite he couldn't stop.  I split the batch in half and made some with salsa on top and some with canned  spicy enchilada sauce.  (I'm in too spicy)  I also added some shredded mozzarella to the cheddar mixture to make them a litter chewier.  I didn't have any green onion so I diced up a little red onion which added a lot of flavor.  The recipe made so much that I ended up freezing the rest for another night.  Add a side of refried beans and your meal is complete.  Thanks to this recipe I will never be stuck with leftover turkey again.  Cheers!!!

it was good. Nothing amazing, however it was very easy. I used green chile instead of salsa. Also, it needs to re-heat longet then 20 min. I would say closer to 30.

These were a "hit" for a "Cinco de Mayo" supper at our church. Several asked for the recipe. I did change a few things, but thanks DTHUBER for the great recipe! I used pork, and flour tortillas. I also used green enchilada sauce not salsa. I put some in the meat mixture and in the bottom of the pan as others have suggested. I too added more cheese and about 1/2 cup cream cheese. I placed cheese over top the last few minutes of baking and then added chopped green onion and a few chopped black olives for presentation.

Excellent!! I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa and I added chili powder and garlic powder to the chicken filling. Putting cheese on top during the last 5 minutes is YUMMY! Next time I will use white onion instead of green onion. This will be come a "regular" in our household!!  Makes GREAT leftovers!!

These are pretty good, and not difficult to make.  I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa because that just sounded better to me.  I boiled the chicken just in water, but I think next time I'll boil it in chicken broth, maybe with some veggies/spices to give it more flavor.  Boiling does work well for shredding the chicken.

This was a nice recipe. I am fairly new to cooking and found this recipe easy to follow. I made a few healthy substitutions. I used whole grain tortillas and it gave the enchiladas a hearty and yummy taste! I too used a Southwest seasoning in lieu of cumin and oregano. I also used reduced fat cheese and sour cream to cut the fat/calories. I also used enchilada sauce instead of the salsa, and actually just mixed the Southwest seasoning right in with the enchilada sauce. Additionally, I added some red pepper flakes to taste to spice it up a little. I individually wrapped the leftovers in saran-wrap for a quick lunch later in the week.

My family loved this recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken (saves time, tastes better and costs almost the same)and lightly fried the corn (less chewy than flour) tortilla in a pan coated with cooking spay(this prevented the tortilla from craking) then dipped both sides in enchilada sauce before filling. Pour remaining sauce on top.  As good as the enchiladas from my favorite Mexican restaraunt, maybe better.

These were pretty good.  I used the 10 minute enchilada sauce from this site and flour tortillas because I had them on hand.  Next time I'll leave out the cilantro.  I thought it was kind of overpowering, but my husband didn't think so.

This was excellent.  I was looking for a recipe that would use up some cheddar cheese, chicken and green onions that I had. I didn't have cilantro, so I left that out.  I also used flour tortillas instead of corn.  I also used a spicy red enchiladas sauce instead of salsa.  I will definitely make this again!

This is my new favorite chicken enchilada recipe. What I like best is that it isn't runny or greasy. I usually have some leftovers, and I like to put some in a flour tortilla and grill it for a quick snack!

This recipe I originally tried two years ago with Miracle Whip, cumin, and red pepper flakes and chicken for the filling.  It is my families favorite and low in fat too!

Excellent recipe!  I personally think it's better with enchilada sauce but salsa also works great especially if you don't have any enchilada sauce on hand.  I just leave out the cilantro because I don't care for it, but otherwise I cooked it as is and it was excellent and my family raved about it!

I added the salsa to the chicken mixture and added red enchilada sauce and cheese on top.  I also used flour tortillas.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

Very impressed with this recipe. I used red enchilada sauce instead of the salsa. I also used diced jalapenos in the chicken mixture which gave it a nice kick. We enjoyed this much better than the beef enchiladas I use to make. Definitely a keeper.

These enchiladas were very good.  I did substitute enchilada sauce for the salsa.  Also, I steamed the tortillas between damp paper towels in the microwave to make them soft and easy to roll.  My family loved them.  Delicious leftover also. This is definitely a keeper.

Love it! I threw in a can of white corn on a whim and it really made the dish. My husband hates "Mexican" food as a rule, but he gobbled this up!

I'm a nanny who has been making this recipe for years now for 'my' little boy.  It's one of his (and my) absolute favorites. Even though it's usually just the two of us eating, I usually make the full batch because I know they will get eaten by either my bosses or one of my friends. Also, these freeze great. They can be prepared ahead of time, too - e.g. while the kid(s) is/are in school - saving sanity during the hectic homework/dinner hour.  I use mild enchilada sauce and sprinkle some extra shredded cheese over the top just before popping it into the oven. A definite regular in my recipe arsenal :)

Very good. Recipe doesn't detail how many this makes. A "heaping spoonful" could be a tablespoon or a cup. This can GREATLY vary the cooking time. I made 6 9" Enchiladas with this recipe, with each getting roughly 1/2 cup of filling I should have cooked them 30 minutes to thoroughly cook through. But the taste and presentation was very good. I subbed in HOT Enchilada Sauce for the salsa and added a small can of diced green chiles to the chicken mixture.

This was my first time to make homemade enchiladas and these tasted like authentic Tex-Mex restaurant style enchiladas! I made the 10 minute enchilada sauce also found on this site and together it was a gem of a meal! I used flour instead of corn tortillas and added extra cheese and sauce on top and they were fabulous!

Loved these! We've made two Enchiladas recipes from this site, these ones and Enchiladas II. I prefer these ones, the boyfriend prefers the other ones. Either way a fantastic week night meal.

These were good - great the next day. I feel like the corn tortillas overwhelmed the filling (which was SO good!).  Next time I think I'll use flour.  Also, a great sauce:  fresh salsa, chicken broth and sour cream.

My family loved this and I loved how easy it was to put together.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using a Southwest seasoning mix instead of cumin and cilantro.  I'll definitely put this one in the rotation.  Thanks.

Great recipe. I didn't have sour cream on hand so I replaced it with some cream cheese. Worked fine. Loved the "mole" kick to this sauce. Will definitely prepare this again.

This was a good dish, but I would agree with other reviews on being creative with the sauce you use. The salsa left it a bit dry. Also I added about an additional cup of cheese over the top of the enchiladas. The filling was great though! Lots of compliments!

The dominant flavor here is cumin: just not the enchilada I was looking for. Also, I like mine with more sauce. I would have given a 2-star rating except that my husband liked it well enough to finish the leftovers.

I loved this recipe!  It was wonderful.  Not only did I enjoy cooking it - my kids helped me with the preparations.  Instead of using salsa, I used store bought enchilada sauce and it worked out beautifully!  I will definetly be using this recipe in the future for my family!

This recipe is amazing!  Everyone that I have made it for has LOVED it!!!  I just add a little cheese on top at the end of cooking and they are delicious!
