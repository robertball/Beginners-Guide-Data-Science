I used 6 oz sliced ham instead of bacon (a slice of bacon is approx, 1 oz each. I figured they shrink in half after cooking so 6 oz ham would be equivalent to 12 oz uncooked bacon). I think this would taste much better if you omit the potato and double the broccoli and bacon/ham.

I made this for the work crowd.  Lots of compliments!  Instead of cutting the bacon before frying, I fried it first, cooked the potatoes in the bacon grease, and then cut up the bacon to mix with the bread, broccoli, cheese and potatoes.  Highly recommend this recipe!

I have made may different breakfast casseroles through the years, and I LOVED this one. It was a surprise, because I really didn't think it sounded too good when I read the recipe. I only made it because I had bread, eggs, cream cheese & broccoli on hand that were about to expire, & I wanted to use them before I had to toss them. That's usually not the best reason to choose a recipe, right? But this turned out great, in my opinion. I did make some substitutions: used left over stater tots instead of potatoes, added some left over ham to the bacon since i didn't have 12 strips, used whole wheat sandwich bread instead of French, and used a softened block of cream cheese, not the tub. Recipe was still tasty, but I imagine it would be even better as written. I was surprised how much I liked the broccoli in this type of casserole. It added a nice crunch. And I was also surprised that all of the ingredients would fit into the baking dish. It seemed like there would be too much, but it worked & was probably why the casserole was filled with yummy goodness in each bite. I also threw in some Mrs. Dash, mustard & Worcestershire, just for a little more flavor in the eggs. Delicious and was a great way to use things that I typically have in the fridge. We had it for dinner, but it would be great for any meal.

This was by far, the best breakfast casserole I have ever made for Christmas morning and I've tried quite a few. The ONLY difference I made to the recipe was I decreased the bread to 6 cups and increased the broccoli to 2 cups. My family raved about it and I will definitely be finding more occasions to make this besides Christmas!
