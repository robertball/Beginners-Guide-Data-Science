Instead of the crust recommended, I used a graham cracker crust.  It was a wonderfully rich chocolate pie, a big hit with my family!  The only "tough" part was whipping the cream - otherwise, very simple recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe.  Really easy to make and it turned out great.  I did not have time to chill the dough but it worked anyways.  It was just a little sticky putting it in.  Wonderful chocolate flavor.  My husband the chocoholic raved!

While a great recipe, I knocked it down one star because I am having a big problem with the crust sticking to my pie plate (Chantal Deep Dish Pie Plate) reguardless of how much grease I use. If anyone has any thoughts on solving this problem, I would love to hear about it.

Made it twice, once with bitter sweet bits instead of milk chocolate. Outstanding either way and rave reviews form the 300+ consummers.

We love this pie!  I've always just substituted the crust for a store bought graham cracker crust, and it's made this a fast and easy treat!  My mother-in-law even asked me for the recipe!  One caution...you better like chocolate!!!  It's pretty rich!

This has great flavor.  Doesn't set up as well as I'd like though.  I used a Pyrex pie plate which I sprayed with cooking spray and didn't have any problems with the crust sticking.

This is a great chocolate pie.  Good taste, good texture, easy to make.  We have this at the holidays because my family loves it.  I agree the crust really makes the pie.  I have also used store bought chocolate cookie crust and its good too just not as good.  Either way it will be a hit at any gathering.

I’ve used this crust recipe since sometime in the 70s. It is outstanding both as a crust and cookies. Also great with 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint (not mint) extract. I’m only rating the crust since I haven’t made the filling. This is the first time I’ve seen the filling recipe, so I’m planning to make it soon, trusting that it’s as good as the crust.

to those who use store bought pie crusts: you're really missing out.The crust is one of the best things about this pie. I've used, and loved, this recipe for years. I'm surprised I haven't rated it yet, I felt sort of sorry for the recipe having such few ratings so I felt obligated to do so now. This is really wonderful, the perfect chocolate pie.
