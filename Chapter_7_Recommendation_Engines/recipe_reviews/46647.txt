I made this recipe once about two years ago and made a couple changes like added brown sugar, corn starch and less curry.  It was pretty good but not wonderful.  But then I made it again a couple of days ago, with the following changes: added about 2 teaspoons chopped garlic, about 1/3 cup peanut butter and 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and then divided it into two pans: with with less curry paste than the other.  I then let it simmer for about half an hour while I cooked tofu and shrimp and then added one cut up, cooked potato and about half a cup of peas.  Prepared this way, it was truly excellent and even better than the first time, just like our favorite Thai restaurant.  I'll try it sometime with zucchini, which seems to be a common ingredient in curries at Thai restaurants.

This is a great basic recipe. Use caution when adding the curry paste! I checked the back of my bottle of curry paste before adding it, and thank goodness... the bottle suggested 1/2 to 1 TBS (the recipe calls for two!). So I only added 3/4 TBS, and it turned out PLENTY spicy! (The strength of the curry paste may depend on the brand.) Other variations: try adding 1 TBS brown sugar to the curry sauce. You might like to add some veggies while sauteeing the tofu; I suggest cauliflower (very small florets) and onion. You can also use seitan instead of tofu... turns out rather like a chicken curry. I like my sauce slightly thicker, so I added a little cornstarch.

I made many modifications.  I used broth instead of water.  I used wide lomein noodles instead of rice. I omitted the sesame oil.  I added 1 teaspoon salt.  I only used 1/2 tablespoon of curry paste (and it was still wayyyy hot).  My coconut milk was 14 oz.  I added 2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil, 1 sliced zuchinni, 1 cup bean sprouts, and 1 cup snow peas.  Directions:  Bring broth, coconut milk, sugar, salt to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 15 minutes.  Add vegetables and tofu and simmer another 10-15 minutes.  Serve over noodles or rice.

This is a wonderful dish.  I especially liked the idea of stir-frying with sesame oil - it really adds depth of flavor.  I also added broccoli to the stir-fry, used lite coconut milk, and served over steamed short-grain brown rice.  Delicious!

This was a tasty recipe. I have to admit that we made adjustments to it to make it more substantial. We added an onion, 10 baby carrots, maybe 1 1/2 cups frozen broccoli, a leek and a scallion. I also couldn't find a 10 oz. can of milk, so I used a 14 oz. can and the curry paste was just the right amount for us (You don't have to drizzle a lot of liquid on the end result if you can't stand the heat). The seasame oil was wonderful! We will make other variations of this recipe for sure! Thanks!

This was really tasty, quick and easy. So spicy that I thought next time I'd only use 1 tb of the curry paste. But the leftovers the next day were less spicy for some reason, and absolutely deliciuos in a pita. My first time to cook tufu - I was surprised at how long it took to brown, alot longer than chicken breast, all that water I guess. Thanks for the recipe - I'll definately be making this again soon! Might add some chopped onion last few minutes of sauteing the tofu. Might not. It's pretty good as it is!

I made this for my roommates and they loved it. Like suggested, I only used half the amount of the green cury paste and it was plenty of spice! I fried the tofu and then added some brocoli. I pressed some fresh ginger into the coconut milk while it was simmering. Right before serving, I cut up some fresh mangos and put it right on top of the dish!

We found this recipe to be very bland and extremely spicy. Like the other reviewers, we added come vegetables to make it more substantial (pea pods, baby corn, carrots). Despite the sesame oil and coconut milk, the final result was really bland. I recommend using only one tsp of curry paste (rather than 2 tbsp) and adding garlic and ginger to the stir fry, then perhaps adding cornstarch to the sauce. However, I don't think I'll ever use this recipe again.

Green curry paste has shrimp in them so it is not suitable for vegetarians.

I did not fix this recipe for myself. My husband LOVES green curry and he has Thai food about 3 times a week.  He liked this recipe.  I did use the suggestions on the back of the green curry paste jar and only added 1 - 1 1/2 tbsp of of the paste, some basil and some brown sugar. (If I had the fish paste, I would have added that too.) This is suppose to be runny, so I did not add cornstarch like some of the other reviews.  My husband likes this dish in the restaurants with eggplant... I'd like to try to fix it with eggplant next time. Enjoy!

Really easy and delicious. I used the base of this recipe and used chicken instead of tofu (husband doesn't like tofu). I added broccoli and peas. We *love* spicy dishes so we really enjoyed the 2 tbsp of green curry paste. I plan to look for even more green vegetables and will make this again and again.

Sometimes I start with step 3, and only make the sauce. It is great served over microwave-steamed veggies and rice. Super quick and easy!

I think this is a nice, simple recipe.  I had the most trouble frying the tofu because it kept sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Maybe using a non-stick pan would work better next time.  I did include a little bit of sugar, like others have suggested.  I also think that you could potentially add vegetable for variety.

Not all green curry paste has shrimp (mine didn't), so whether or not this recipe is suitable for vegetarians actually depends on the brand.
I thought this recipe was very good and easy to adjust to taste.  The tofu was great - I put aside some for snacking on its own.  The dish has a simple taste until the delayed heat from the green curry kicks in.
After tasting the curry sauce, I also added a little peanut butter and brown sugar, and threw in some potato and zucchini as well.  It turned out great.

The only things I did differently with this recipe was use already-made store-bought Thai yellow curry sauce (instead of making my own green curry sauce), which already had coconut milk as its base and is (of course) yellow, and I used brown jasmine rice instead of basmati rice.  It was okay, but if I make it again it won't be for a long time.  I think 3 stars is the best rating to give for this recipe.  If I try it again with green curry, I'll see if it tastes any better.  But for now, 3 stars.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, especially for being so simple. I had all of the ingredients on hand already, so I liked that. I thought it was pretty spicy (which I love), but without a whole lot of other flavor, so I was going to give it a 3. However, my fiance loved the recipe and said to give it a 5, so I went in the middle and gave it a 4. I think it would be a little better if there were a few veggies in it (like bell peppers, potatoes, or carrots, etc).

A great dish.  Add veggies and don't forget the salt.  If you're wary of adding 2 Tbs of curry paste, I'd start with 1 and see how it tastes first.  I put in a little less than 2 Tbs, added sugar, and used 398 ml of coconut milk.  I like spicy, but this was too hot.  Ended up eating a lot more rice than I wanted to.  It'd help to add some cornstarch too.  The tofu was delicious, and the curry tasted like is has at restaurants (but the restaurants hadn't made it as spicy as I did)!

Yum! This is a terrific recipe and tastes just like the curry tofu you get in Thai restaurants! I followed the recipe almost exactly as listed with the addition of green and yellow bell pepper strips. I added more milk/curry paste to compensate for the added veggies. This is a recipe that lends itself really well to additions - eggplant cubes and cooked onion strips would also be nice. Depending on the curry paste you buy and how much spiciness you like, you may need to adjust the quantity you add to the milk. Thanks, Janet, for a great recipe!

It was really good and easy to make.  I did add sauted garlic and onions to the conconut milk while it was boiling, which adding flavor and texture.  We will definitely make this again!

Eh. I added a tbsp of brown sugar as some suggested, and next time I would add a lot more. The tofu did not take on the flavor of the curry, but then again, I always have that problem with tofu. Any suggestions? I fried it forever and it remained bland and uncrisp. One tbsp of green curry paste was PLENTY. Overall, this was rather bland.

This recipe came out really great. I made a few modifications: I used stir fry beef because that is what I had on hand, I added a 3/4 package of frozen stir fry vegetables, I added garlic/dried shallots/basil to the stir fry mixture,  I only used 1 tbsp of Thai Kitchen green curry paste, I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar to the coconut/curry sauce, and I used locally grown organic jasmine rice (YUM!). The curry paste was exactly the right amount, and the brown sugar made it taste like candy (just like our local Thai restaurant). I usually do a terrible job with tofu, so I think next time I will try it with chicken and sweet potatoes (like another reviewer suggested). Overall, it was a good and simple recipe which can easily be modified to suit what you have on hand. My boyfriend absolutely loved it!

This recipe was incredible!! I have always LOVED Thai cuisine, but I never ventured into it.. I had no idea how easy it was to create that taste sensation! I used chicken instead of tofu, threw in some hot chile peppers (only for the bravest taste buds)and used cubed sweet potato(yam) and peanuts.  I created a meal that tasted EXACTLY like my favorite dish at an expensive Thai restaurant.  The sweet potato tastes AMAZING in this recipe, although it sounds unusual, it is the perfect taste combination along with peanuts.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I thought this was great, I had planned heaps of time to do t and then discovered it was so easy it only took a few minutes. I had to keep the sauce simmering for ages, while I waited for the boys to get home but it was great!! Well worth the little wait.
I used a different type of tofu, which is already coated in honey soy marinate, which worked perfetcly, it's not silky tofu, which is slimy, it was crunchy and delicious. I think I would definatly make this again!

This is really tasty but be careful with the heat. I used half of the curry paste (Thai Kitchen brand) called for and it was almost too hot to eat, even for my husband who likes spicy foods. I will use 1/2 tbls next time.

I don't know what I did wrong.  It didn't taste good to me. When I go out to Thai restaurants, I usually order green curry, so I had my hopes up.

This recipe is just a good starting point. I added sliced green bell pepper, some carrots, water chestnuts, zucchini and baby corn. Finally garnished with some fresh basil. That made it.

I added a bag of stir fry veggies and a minced jalapeño.  It seemed to be missing a little something though, so next time I might try frying some garlic with the tofu or putting some fish sauce in with the coconut milk and curry paste.

Followed the recipe exactly except used 1-1.5 Tbs green curry paste and added assorted vegetables to the stir fry in the end. I cooked the tofu for longer than 20 minutes, but it never browned or turned crisp. I don't know what I did wrong (not enough heat? not enough sesame oil?). Also, the sauce was plenty hot, but did not have very much flavor. If I ever try to make this again, I will supplement the sauce as was recommended on the back of the green curry paste jar.

Simple and quite good.  I used 1 tablespoon of the curry paste, but I think I will use 2 next time - I shouldn't have let myself get scared off by some of the other reviews!  Also, I sauteed about 1 Tbsp fresh ginger and a few cloves of garlic with the tofu, and added some yellow & orange bell pepper and baby corn to make it a little more hearty.  The sauce is wonderful and simple, though - I had some just over leftover basmati rice the next day-YUM!

Very good and easy. I added more veg (water chestnuts, baby corn, mushrooms) and crushed red pepper ( I prefer it HOT!)and it turned out like the veggie dish i order at Thai restaurants.

Very good.  I used 1 tbsp green curry paste as suggested, as the spiciness was just right.  i also used the "agadeshi-esque" tofu recipe found on this site.  the only thing i would have changed is to cook the rice longer... it wasn't totally cooked.

This recipe is a good base for creativity.  I think it's great with some veggies added to it.  Possibly some pineapple or mango, which I haven't tried yet.  Very spicy, though.  watch out!
