I wanted something comforting tonight for dinner and usually because it was something Mom would make I chose something with Campbells mushroom soup. I had six boneless chops that I browned in butter and set in a baking dish while I quickly made the sauce. I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added 1/3 c. lowfat sour cream and 1 tbsp. of worchestershire sauce, as I learned years ago to make a creamier sauce. I did bake this with the sauce over the chops for about a half hour to meld the flavors and ensure my chops were done. Very comforting.  And very reminicent of what Mom would make. I served this with Cowboy Mashed Potatoes.

Very easy to cook for a beginner like myself, simple rather fast, and delicious if you like mushroom flavor... MMMM GOOD. Definitely making this again.

This was good, but pretty bland overall, so not really our kind of dish.  The chops and onions had a really nice flavor, but the mushroom sauce was just blah.  I think this could be really good if a little pizzazz is added to the sauce -- I may have to try again!

This was very good, I really liked the seasoning mix.  The only changes I made were  1) to remove the chops while cooking the onion, deglazed with a little sherry, then returned chops to skillet; 2) added mushrooms; and 3) a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce when I added the soup and milk.  The only additional change I would probably make in the future is to add a little pepper.  Oh, and I'll deglaze with white wine next time, just to see how that comes out.  The chops were really tender, great with the rice.

An easy and flavorful recipe for pork chops!  I followed the suggestions made by ren1216, which definitely boosted the flavor.  I did deglaze with white wine after sauteeing the onions, with excellent results.  The Worcestershire splashes into the gravy before simmering enhanced the dish.  I served the chops with mashed potatoes, and ladled the creamy golden gravy over all.  I will definitely make this dish again--it is a great electric skillet recipe for my husband and myself.

I LOVED this recipe!!!!  My oldest son hates pork chops and mushrooms, but he ate every bite of these!!!  Anything that gets my picky eaters to eat new things gets an A+ in my book!

The only things I added where a few sauted onions and portabella mushrooms to the sauce and I left out the rice.  This has become a new family favorite!!

This recipe turned out great for me. I did not measure any of the herbs so I probably used more than what the recipe called for. I am a vegetarian and seasoned according to the smell. My boyfriend gave me two thumbs up. I did however use thyme and basil as well as adding salt and pepper which I am sure made a difference.

Easy and fairly quick too. This was done in the time it took to cook rice. I added a little salt to the chops before the rub.

These were delicious, but I made them gluten free. Instead of condensed cream of mushroom soup I added a can of gluten free cream of mushroom soup. There are a couple of different brands that carry it: Progresso and Gluten Free Cafe. I used the later because that is what I had on hand. And because the soup is not condensed I omitted the milk. 

As a personal preference I added salt and pepper to the spice mixture. It seemed a crime to not salt pork. I will definitely be making this again.

This was great and fast. My 2 year old had seconds. I have also made it with chicken thighs instead of the pork.

Great for single moms on the go! After the onions browned, I used Italian seasoning (instead) with the usual seasonings as suggested and mixed into the soup and milk.  Took leftover porkchops from Grandma's fridge from a couple days ago and warmed the both together. Came out so good! My daughter and mother appreciated the meal, plus it was a great way to add punch to the lightly seasoned, grilled porkchops without feeling like you were eating the same thing twice!

Easy to do, stays moist, and kids love it.  I have served with both rice and potatoes ... either works.

Very delicious!  I added salt and pepper to the spice mixture as suggested and I suppose it helped.  Also made excellent leftovers the next day!!

Ugh, bland and more bland. If I decide to use this recipe again, I'll definitely add more spices to it. It cooked up fine, but there was simply no taste. If you want this recipe to turn out well, use more spice and add some salt and pepper.

good, solid recipe.  i added mushrooms, needed almost twice the milk to get the gravy consistency i was looking for, and to combat the blandness of the gravy i added 1/2 tsp extra spices and paprika while simmering

These pork chops were great. They had really good flavor and the seasonings blended really well without any of them being overpowering. So why four stars instead of five? Because if you follow this cooking method the pork chops get too overdone while the onions are still slightly raw. We plan on making this again because like I said, the flavor was wonderful, but I would start cooking the onions and pork chops at the same time, and right after adding the soup and milk once it came to a boil I would stop cooking it all together. Then this dish would be fantastic! Can't wait to try it again.

I had to adjust it to fit my crew of course!!!  To give it my own twist by doing 1 can cream mushroom  & 1 can golden mushroom and pretty much everything else the same except cooking time... My future sailors assured me they would miss my cooking!!!

Made it with rice and chopped [frozen] spinach as sides - ended up mixing it all together on my my plate and it was heaven!
