This is a fabulous topper for pot pies.  I didn't have any puff pastry one day & thought , what about a biscuit topper?  The one thing I found out though is to cover the biscuit mix with aluminum foil first for about 20 min. @ 350, then uncover & continue baking for 20-30 min @375 untill the biscuit topping is browned.  Otherwise the underside could turn out raw.

These are quick, easy, and delicious. I added some cheddar cheese and garlic powder to mine and they were awesome. :)Definitely a keeper!

Great basic recipe. As the other reviewer said, it is very buttery.  This would be especially delicious with some garlic powder and shredded cheddar or herbs.  This is a keeper!!

i followed this recipe to a tee. it was too runny, had to add a lil more flour.  they turned out too buttery tasting, and the worst was they didnt rise. they were flat and tuff.

Best drop biscuit recipe I've tried so far!  Fluffy and buttery, and very easy to make.  I found the milk quantity to be a little too much - I ended up adding just over a cup of milk and that was plenty.  Next time I'll try rolling these out for cut biscuits.  VERY good with a little butter and jam.  Be careful not to overmix the dough, and if you want a browned top you may want to brush the top with a egg/milk/butter wash.  I'll definitely keep this in my recipe box!

These were pretty good and super easy to make.  I added 1 tsp of Garlic powder,1 tsp of parsley flakes and 1/4 cup cubed marble cheese. I baked at 375 for 15 mins.   I did bake the other way but I found my bottoms burned to quickly.

My grandma has been making biscuits like this for years, as did her mom and my mother. Now, I make them for my children. These will always be my favorite because of that. I make these now with buttermilk or soured milk and sometimes if the mood sets me right, I might add spices to compliment whatever meal I'm making.

Awesome as a shortcake-style biscuit or scone for a strawberry dessert.  My main changes were adding an extra tbsp sugar, decreasing the milk to 1 cup, and sprinkling with a dash of cinnamon before baking at 375 for about 15-18 minutes.  Very tasty and light and best of all, no shortening!

This is a super delicious biscuit recipe. Wonderful base for many other additions, it's very versatile. I doubled the recipe and removed some dough to make plain ones before I added other ingredients. I added 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese and 1/2 cup of diced jalapeno peppers (from a jar) and 1 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. I brushed them with a bit of melted butter out of the oven. They are fabulous! I tried them plain, without any changes, and they are delicious also. I will use this simple, but great recipe often. They went very well with the soup we had for dinner. Thank you for sharing :)

Took only 15 min start to finish. Quick, easy and tastes great. I added some Italian seasonings and cooked in my toaster oven 11 min. Very buttery, but very good.

Excellent biscuits with one change.  I substituted 1/2 teaspoon honey for the sugar.  Really yummy with our duck roast.  Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly.. was concerned the dough looked too thin but baked them anyway since the other reviews were positive. They were flat and tasteless. Not sure how everyone else got theirs to turn out well, but 1-1/4c milk was definitely too much. With less milk, they might have been okay.

AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did have to add a little bit more flour as it was too runny. They were amazing and my husband and I couldn't stop eating them with our dinner. I've tried recipes in the past and they came out way too dry and it was disappointing. This will be the only recipe I'll be using in the future. I believe the diced up butter in the batter makes all the difference because none of the other recipes I've made were like that. You will not be let down!!

Excellent drop biscuit and the secret is to have butter and milk very cold.    Thanks for a great recipe but have to stress that butter and milk be very cold otherwise they will not be flaky.

If you're looking for a quick & easy biscuit recipe that doesn't require rolling or cutting, this is it! I made it as written and it was great, but I've also halved the butter and subbed almond milk for the milk and those were awesome too. Great drop biscuit recipe!

Not very good at all. I've made biscuits many times before, but I've never have them turn out so badly. They stuck to the pan and were barely golden on top. Won't try this again.

They were too liquidy (had to add more flour), did not brown the way they should have and ontop of all of that, they came out to rubbery.  Other people said that they were very buttery, I couldn't even taste the butter in it.

Very buttery flavor, fluffy inside, and sturdy so they didn't crumble when I split them. The outsides were crunchy though and not as tender as I would have liked them to be, but maybe that is just a feature of a drop biscuit. They served the purpose but I won't be using this recipe again. Thanks as I enjoyed trying out a new recipe!

Very nice drop biscuits, just dense enough and a light crispy sort of shell on the outside. I subbed 1/4C corn meal for 1/4C of the flour and added some shredded cheddar. Came out great.

Yum! I did savoury these up though, instead of the sugar I added a teaspoon of garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and some grated cheese, my butter was salted anyway so there was no need for more to be added. We topped them with more grated cheese and a pinch of paprika.

Simple but yummy recipe. I didn't have milk, but was feeling "experimental." I mixed 3/4 cup Hellman's low fat mayo with 1/2 cup water. They turned out great! Almost like buttermilk biscuits. I think I'll try using ranch dressing next time.

I made these this morning for my 4 boys and several overnight guests ... not enough milk to double the recipe so I did one batch with whole milk and one with buttermilk ... OMG ... The ones made with buttermilk were incredible ... they kept going back for more ... no gravy ... no jelly ... just butter and the biscuits ... This is our new Family recipe! I cant wait to add a little garlic and cheese and serve them with seafood for dinner!

I tried this recipe and was a little disappointed.  The milk to dry ratio was off and my biscuit mix was very runny.  Although they still tasted good, they didn't rise.  I should have read the reviews before mixing up the dough.

I followed this recipe exactly. They were too runny (turned out looking like cookies instead of biscuits.) Won't be making this recipe again.

I eliminated about 1/8 cup of milk, but they were still a bit too wet and didn't rise. Possibly because I used skim? Also added about 1/2 tsp. of garlic power and 1/2 tsp. of parsley. Taste was quite good, and these were easy & quick to whip up.

Made it per directions.  Turned out perfect both times. Actually, was a little wet the first time (but not bad).  I was careful the second time and not adding the final bit of milk (because I was adding it slowly, of course) allowed me to  get a stiffer batter.  Either way, though - they're great.

Also - second time used skim milk without any issues. 

Might, in the future,. add bits of chopped nuts or dried fruit for a more breakfast-time biscuit.

I must use this biscuit recipe at least a few times a month. Great for breakfast or for mopping up delicious sauces.  Only thing I changes was less milk.  I poured a little at a time until I saw the right consistency. Ended up being about 3/4 c.

I've never had success with biscuits from scratch before. This morning, making breakfast for my elderly parents, I discovered too late that they were out of frozen and canned biscuits. Needed something easy and fast. This was perfect! I dropped mine in a greased (sprayed) muffin tin.  "Biscuit Muffins!" Will do this from now on!

The recipe made great tasting biscuits. I can't deny that. but I think it would be better off with only 1 cup of milk. I put the 1 1/4 cup and they are basically flat. I love buttery biscuits so the amount of butter to me was perfect, I even put some more on top when eating. However some might want it to be a little less I'd go with half a stick in that case. 
Like I said great taste (I ate mine with butter and honey) but they are too liquidy. less liquid = better biscuit. 
I actually was putting the milk in by 1/4 cup and i should have only done 4 not 5.

Could be beginners bad luck...I did not have whole milk, but I followed the recipe for 6 servings.  The batter seemed too runny, but went ahead and baked.  They came out flat as cookies?  They burned quicker on the bottom.  I did not grease the cookie sheet (was not in direction too) and they stuck to the bottom.  I would really love to try again if anyone has some pointers...thanks

My family loved these! They were fast and easy. I would even make these on a busy week night. My husband said I could make them anytime. Two of these with a bowl of soup was a filling meal.  Unlike most recipes, the batter made exactly 12 good sized biscuits as promised. Cooking time was just right. Thank you!

These are very yummy.  Rather than use butter, I used a quarter of a cup of butter-flavored Crisco and a quarter cup of Move Over Butter, which made them especially light and tender. Whipped them up especially for biscuits and sausage gravy this morning, but was naughty and had one with butter and honey, too!  Delish!  They haven't any aftertaste of baking powder, which I particularly appreciate, so I may have to cut up some strawberries for a shortcake dessert for tonight, too!

Best recipe to date. I used half and half and my young girls mixed the flour and butter with their hands then slowly added the milk. i decreased the milk by 1/4 cup and baked for 12 minutes. They turned out amazing!

These were super simple to make and taste great.  I made creamed chipped beef for dinner and needed biscuits to go with it.  I was out of a lot of ingredients that other recipes called for, but had everything for this one.  So happy that I was missing other ingredients, these were wonderful.  The left over biscuits from dinner made a great desert with honey.  No need to ever buy refridgerator biscuits again.

In a pinch, after getting snowed in with a group of 8 people, we searched for recipes we could make with what we had on hand. These were excellent!! I took them out of the oven slightly early, and they were nice and doughy (which we liked). Paired with some honey-butter this time, but next time it's cheddar and garlic for sure!!

Very good! This was an easy and fast recipe that can easily be modified to suffice just about anyone. Add cheddar and fresh herbs for a savory biscuit. Add an extra Tbs of sugar or change to Splenda to compliment jams...Or just enjoy as is! I used a large ice cream scoop for easy transfer to my baking sheet and I will suggest wax paper for easy release and clean up.

These are delicious!  I have never made drop biscuits before but needed something quick, and they were so good that they were gone within minutes.

I am pretty picky when it comes to biscuits and I thought these were some of the best I've ever had! I made half of them plain and then added grated cheese, garlic powder, and parsley to the other half and loved them either way. Great flavor, not too salty, just perfect. The only recommendation I would make is to grease your pan prior to baking. Awesome!

These were perfect with stew for dinner last night.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for using skim milk since that is all I ever have in the house) The outside got a little crisp and beautifully golden and the inside stayed soft...yum!  They didn't need butter or any kind of spread, I could have eaten them by themselves and been happy. Really easy and delicious.

My wife and kids love these.  I will not buy the biscuits in a can again.  Great with sausage gravy.  Easy enough for my 9 year old daughter to make with just a minnimal amount of supervision.

Mixed bag here in my house. Kids loved them. I thought they were pretty good, hub not so much. I thought with all that butter that I wouldn't need to grease the pan but I should have. First time is always a learning experience. I would make them again. Definitely better than boxed mixes - not salty or fake tasting and just as easy to make

this is a great recipe...i was looking for a rolled biscuit recipe though....so I only put in 1 cup of milk, and i had run out of butter so i used tenderflake lard. I also added a bit more flour till it came together into a soft dough.  Awesome!!!!

So easy, and so tasty! I had been craving biscuits, and these hit the spot. I just swapped out 1/2c of the all-purpose flour for white whole wheat. An extra bonus is that they took less than 30 minutes from start to finish, including bake time. Great right out of the oven with a little butter and honey.

Delicious! I added some ginger powder to the flour mix and replaced the milk with a mixture of pureed apples‚ orange juice‚ almond butter‚ and cinnamon.  People at the potluck I took these to seemed to enjoy them.

I made it without the sugar, added 5 TB ground flax.  The instructions said "gradually" add liquid, so I followed the instructions and STOPPED adding liquid when the batter was moist enough (one cup only).  The biscuits came out perfectly.  Light, airy, delicious.  If not for the sugar, I would give this recipe 5 stars.

Horrible!  I should have read the negative reviews before trying this recipe.  The ingredient amounts must be wrong, because I followed the recipe exactly (added some cheese) and ended up with a dough that was too runny.  Against my better judgment, I didn't add more flour, and just thought perhaps they'd puff up in the oven.  

Wrong!  They ended up as flat as pancakes, rubbery, and tasteless.  My flour and baking powder were both fresh, so that couldn't have been the reason.  I was very disappointed in this waste of time and ingredients.

Very easy to make. I did use less milk , a little less than 1 c. Verses 1 1/4 c. , but I knew that if I added the rest it would not be consistency for drop biscuits. Definitely making again.

The salt/baking powder ratio is off, the sugar makes it taste weird and 450 degrees is too hot so it burns the bottoms.   I adjusted the recipe and tried a second time. Increase salt to 1 tsp, omit the sugar and bake 12-14 minutes at 375 degrees.   Now it is  a good base that tastes like a nice light baking powder biscuit. Stands on its own or you can add garlic powder, parsley and shredded cheddar cheese to make cheddar biscuits.

I would have given this one star because I followed the recipe and it was clearly obvious that the batter was too wet. I added about 1/4 cup more. It still looked too wet but I went with it and my biscuits were flat because they didn't have enough flour. They actually tasted not half bad so I gave this recipe 2 stars. I have never had a lot of success following other peoples recipes and having it turn out right so I think I will continue to use my own from now on.

WOW were these good.  Easy to make, no cutting dough, rolling or folding. Make in a bowl, stir, drop on to a pan. Cook.
EAT.

I agree with most that this recipe seems runny. What I actually do is use a small Pyrex and coat it generously with Pam. Then I drop the biscuits and spray one at a time with more Pam. Yes they touch but the Pam later in between actually separates them in the oven. Then I do one last little spray of Pam on top before oven. It bakes for about 20-25 minutes and they turn out with nice crispy edges and a bit square. Which I prefer for my sausage gravy. Of course you can drop them into a cookie sheet and keep separate but I’d still add some Pam on top for that amazing golden crisp!

I'm 51 been baking  since I was 9.  Making 3 ingredient drop biscuits at 14.  Friends mom showed me in Alabama.  To much milk I guessing ( added in small increments).  Looked like piles of mashed potatoes.  Wouldn't even brown ( on top anyway) I'm embarrassed.  glad my wife sleeping, trying to surprise her with bib.
 I Always triple check measurements . You can Only mix once!!  I rarely make mistakes. It comes easy to me .  Signed what happened?

450 seemed way too high, I baked mine at 400 for 15 minutes. I used a scant cup of milk with a splash of heavy cream, and added cheddar cheese and herbs. Turned out flaky and perfect! Will definitely make again.

Amazingly good.  Added a bit of Cheddar Jack cheese.  Took them out 5 min early brushed them with melted butter (not that they needed more butter, but yum) sprinkled lightly with a (very) little garlic salt and put them back in for the last 5 min.  This is such a great base recipe.  Definitely a keep!

Omg!!!!!This recipe right here is to die for. My family is biscut critic's. They love biscuts but boy they can be bruttle if you ruin a biscut. I made this biscut tonight for dinner. I followed the recipe to the T. It was so runny that I thought oh boy I will just taste it first. I had to go ahead an make it because I could not waste my product without being sure.  When I tell you I fell in love and so did my whole family. It was like something had just took our tongue on a ride.  The only recipe I will use from this day forward.

Rather than 12 biscuits, I made 8. That required that I keep them on the heat for an addition 5  minutes. My wife absolutely loved them!

If you properly measure dry ingredients this recipe will turn out terrible. I ended up using 2 3/4 cups flour, 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 cup butter half cut long and half cut in cubes, 1 1/2 tbls sugar and 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt. baked at 375°

Followed the recipe and there is too much milk. My biscuits came out flat like pancakes (like another reviewer’s photo).   I’ve made great drop biscuits before and thought this was the recipe I had used - will have to keep looking. NY Times recipe says 3/4 cup milk - that seems right.

I added about a Tbs of garlic powder and a cup of grated cheddar, but in general, these were great. Tender inside, crisp, buttery outside bits- I will for sure use this recipe again. It would be awesome with some vanilla added to the milk and a touch more sugar to use as shortcake base , too.

My son & I made this recipe together. We followed the actual recipe to a "T," but because of our older oven, we did have to alter our cooking temp & time. The biscuits turned out amazing! They're even better than my Memomma's drop biscuits, and that's saying something... just don't tell her ;D

My biscuits turned out great. Thanks for sharing this recipe! To the people who posted reviews stating that their biscuits were flat because the recipe calls for too much milk: The reason the directions say to add the milk a little at a time, is so you can stop adding milk when you've reached the desired consistency.

Consistency was really good and they were easy. Only thing is they weren’t as salty as I’m
Used to biscuits being. Don’t know if I should have used salter butter. Unsalted is what I normally bake with. 

Edit: I just made these again. This time I used a whole teaspoon of salt. I also used 3 teaspoons of baking powder and reduced the milk to 1 cup. They were perfect!

Delicious. May have to add a minute or two to baking time. Very buttery, so don’t need to serve with anything but jam or apple butter. Use a pan with a lip or the melting butter will drip into the oven.

I was short on butter so I used half butter and half shortening as a few reviews stated too buttery. I did not think that was possible but did the half and half out of need. They came out so good my adult son walked in with his bowl of soup and biscuit and asked, "What are the biscuits made out of, freaking heaven!?" Yes, they are a keeper. I did cook them at 375f for 20 minutes. I made sure not to use too much milk only used about 1 cup a little at a time mixing with a fork until it looked right.

As written, I give it a 2 star rating because this is way too much milk. They turn out like cookies rather than a biscuit. The flavor is good and i would try the recipe again with about 1 cup of milk. I like the butter flavor. Don't use margarine or shortening.

I made this recipe this morning. my butter wasn't quite mixing right, so I added half a cup of room temperature crisco in stick form, and about half a cup of milk. worked out very well. I was able to lay them out like a drop cookie dough.

I am not a baker but these were super easy to make. I used my course cheese grater to grate up the butter into the flower it went much faster. I can see how this recipe would be seriously flexible. Can’t wait to start experimenting with it.

For just two of us I halve the recipe.  If I don’t we will eat all of them at one sitting.  These always turn out nice and soft inside with a little crunch to the outside.  We think they’re perfect!

This is a very good recipe. I did tweek it a bit. Instead of butter, I used cold butter flavored Crisco shortening. I pulsed the dry ingredients and shortening in my food processor, and then added the milk 1/2 a cup at a time and pulsed for a few seconds between each addition. I refrigerated the dough covered for about 45 minutes.  I shaped my dough into small biscuits and placed them next to each other so that they touched, and placed in a heated oven. My biscuits came out looking like dinner rolls. They were golden brown and tender and fluffy on the inside. I spread melted salted butter on them and served them with my blackeyed peas and gravy. It was delicious. I will definitely be using this as my go to biscuit recipe.

I read the reviews and compared with other biscuit recipes...added milk slowly, only 1 cup...I would prolly add cheese to flavour it up, but they are easy and yummy...made about 15, for 15 minutes at 450, used tin foil.  Nice and crispy bottoms.

I made these as written (flour was 240g for those that weigh) except I omitted the butter and only needed 8 oz milk. 

They were delicious with my bacon grease gravy. :)

I followee the recipe exactly. The prep is easy but 450 degrees is way too hot. The bottoms were black. The part that wasn't burned was good, tho.

Big , light and fluffy! I added 1 cup shredded cheese. I always add 1 cup milk then more if it needs it. Never dump the whole 1 1/4  cup in all at once. I mixed mine, spooned onto my cookie sheet and let it set for 10 minutes before putting it into a he oven. This lets the baking powder work a little before being cooked. These were crunchy on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside. Will make these often! We had creamed tuna on biscuits, comfort food, so good!

Easy to make and very tasty. I made it as directed the first time and it went great with sausage gravy. When I make this again for a side I'll probably add cheddar, garlic, and a hint of oldbay seasoning.

I just tried making these about an hour ago and well they weren't very good.  They were flat and very bland.  The batter was very runny despite using very cold butter/milk.  They didn't get brown.. I've made homemade biscuits before this recipe unfortunately wasn't a winner.

I have made this at least a dozen times.  My family loves "upside down night". I found that using half the recommended amount of butter works much better for me. Most awesome and easiest biscuit recipe for my homemade gravy. Thank you!

I substitute 2% milk and 1/4 cup of buttermilk for some of the milk; I use double-acting baking powder;  I use only 1/2 T of sugar, and they came out AMAZING!!! They rise up all buttery, proud, and high!

I use them as side biscuits, toppers on upside-down egg frittatas, dumplings in the crock, etc. They are so versatile, and all 4 of my sons and my husband asks for them all the time.  They are a staple in our home. Thanks!!!

These turn out really nice. I did cut butter by 2tbs because of those complaining about to much of a buttery taste.  Next time I will be using the whole half cup. They rised and brown beautifully and tasted awesome. A keeper for me.

I used 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C buttermilk and they were light. Be sure your baking powder is not out of date or they won't rise at all. I baked at 375*F for 20 minutes.

Too much milk for the recipe. I should have stopped adding when I saw it was at a good consistency, regardless though, I divided the mix into muffin tins instead. If I do make this again, I will be putting in less milk.

I made these, while half asleep (we had a terrible storm the night before, so i only got couple hours sleep.) I wasn't paying attention, and didn't do the dry ingredients and butter like i was supposed to, but just put it all together. I did add a bit more flour, but that is probably because I didn't do it right. Regardless, they did turn out flat (my fault) but tasted amazing with sausage gravy! It was only me, so I wasn't worried about appearance lol. Next time, I will do according to directions! They will be awesome then! Try them!

This was much soupier than I expected. I followed directions exactly.  I even added extra flour. It was flat.  It will be great for gravy on top. Will be great for  top of pot pies or casseroles.

These were pretty good biscuits and I loved the buttery flavor.   While gradually adding the milk, it was starting to get to runny so I stopped just short of a cup.   Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly and they were great!   Another reviewer commented on them being to runny so she had to add more flour and they ended up to hard.  That is probably because when she added more flour, she had to stir it more than needed.  Mine were soft.

I used these biscuits as a topping for a pot pie in place of a traditional crust.  It was a very good substitution and it came out great.  It was quick and easy to make and then just drop on the filling and cook in the oven.

So easy to make and very delicious -  I added chopped walnuts, raisin and chocolate chips - my kids will love them!  The recipe is not funny at all unless one measures the ingredients  wrong. And make sure full fat milk is used.

I made biscuits for the first time, using this recipe.  These are absolutely the best biscuits I've ever had! My little family agrees. They insist on my fresh biscuits and gravy every weekend now.  I back off on the butter by just a little. Only because it seams to melt out onto the pan quite a bit. Awesome recipe!

Dont be scared by the bad reviews! They mustve done it wrong.  From what I can tell, most complained about "not rising" well, theyre not supposed to! They are DROP Biscuits.  The shape you drop on the sheet, is the exact shape you get at the end. Dont flatten or smoosh,  drop a large spoonful plop and they'll be crispy on the bottom and top, and just-right in the middle.  Due to all the complaints about lack of flavor, I sprinkled half my batch with salt & garlic powder before popping them in the oven.  Those are GREAT, but the plain ones are good too.  Because the point of biscuits is a vehicle for yummy toppings, right, so why would I want them to scream their own flavor? Theyre just good, super easy, quick things to put jelly or gravy or eggs or whatever on top of.  I used whole wheat flour and they're delicious. Oh - and I agree with the other reviewers, the milk goes in 1/4 cup at a time, and when you have the right consistency of dough (like firm playdoh) then you stop pouring milk.  Mine took a cup and a drop.

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  My butter was frozen, so I grated it with the cheese grater and put the whole thing in my food processor slowly adding the milk.  I was  careful not to over mix.  I patted out the biscuits and baked them.  They were crunchy and delicious!  I  served them with Jimmy Dean sausage gravy and saved one for butter and honey.  I will make this recipe again !   Easy and delicious.  A  winner!

Great recipe!  Guests thought they were delicious and we do also.  So easy to make.!   First batch was plain.  Second  batch I added Monterey Jack cheese and dill seed - great additions!   One review said with 1 1/4 cup milk was too much milk - dough seemed runny.  The recipe says add milk slowly.  I think that is because then you can see the consistency of dough and decide how much you should put into recipe.  I ended up using 1 cup of milk.  Will definitely make again.  :)

Before I get into this review, I have to tell you that I am a bit of a biscuit snob. I want my biscuits to not only be light and fluffy but flavorful as well. A bit of crisp on the exterior doesn't hurt either. With that being said, these biscuits fell short in the flavor category. I found them to be quite bland in fact.

I was looking for a savory biscuit; added 1 cup shredded cheese, 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1/2 tablespoon Italian seasoning. Turned out great! I don't buy milk so just used water.

You can never have enough butter, yummy. Made a batch for breakfast with an egg wash. Loved the crunchy crust and soft biscuit. Loved the ease of the mix and drop.

I followed the recipe precisely.  Dough came out very runny so I added flour to firm it up.  They didn't rise at all and came out looking like cookies.

I'm perplexed by all the high ratings.  These did not come out at all like biscuits.  They came out flat like cookies and didn't really rise at all.  If you are expecting fluffy biscuits, maybe skip this one.  I followed the recipe EXACTlY as it is written, (including cutting in cold butter with a pastry cutter).  I suspect these need a lot of modifications to come out right (less milk, more flour, less temperature).

Follow receipe to the 'T' and although they were very good with sausage gravy and awesome with honey, the liquid was a bit much, they spread out kinda flat. If you bake them to golden brown the bottoms are crunchy which is a plus for me. 
If I use this again I'll tweak the liquid and maybe fold the milk in the dry ingredients bit by bit (like suggested)... instead of stirring so as to keep the batter lumpy and not so much smooth. Over all great flavor and easy to make, my family loved them. (they're all guys) lol

These are really delicious and easy. However, the recipe calls for too much milk so I reduced it to about 3/4 of a cup. I also mix in chopped ham and shredded cheese for a change and they are amazing!

Using almond milk especially, good to reduce quantity of milk to a bit under a cup. I added rosemary and used gluten-free flour. No, they didn't rise much at all. Maybe an idea to use more baking powder, less butter? I must say they were rather tasty, even though for me for this first time making them, they were more like cookies than biscuits!

These were pretty quick and easy! Excellent crust on the outside and soft on the inside. I prefer savory so i was a little easy on the sugar and heavy on the salt. You might not need all the milk, so do add slowly.

I used all the ingredients, except used only 1 cup milk.  It was all soupy !  I added 1 more cup flour, then another cup flour, then almost 2 cups of corn starch and  it was Still soupy.

I've made this a few times, and they've always turned out well. For those who found that the dough was too runny, the recipe does state to add the milk gradually. When it looks the right consistency, stop adding milk.  I add some garlic powder, basil and oregano to spice them up. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. I used pastry flour hoping to get a light biscuit, worked great. On other recommendations, added garlic. Also used heavy cream instead of milk, as I was out. Turned out great. Took about 20 min for a nice golden outside. Perfect for my sausage and gravy meal. Husband loved it!

I made these twice they were soooooo good. The first time I made them, I made it as instructed... Only I melted 1 T butter and brushed it on near the end. The 2nd time I had to use water instead since I was out of milk and it was great. My roommates LOVE these, these go in no time around here.

Used self-rising flour omitting baking powder and salt of course. I also left out the sugar. Used 6T of butter and cut the milk to 1 cup based on other reviews. Perfect! Turned out very delicious! Gave 4 stars because based on other reviews I felt I needed to change up the recipe.

I think the biscuits were wonderful!  Love the little pieces of melted butter inside them and the crunchy exterior. They didn't rise like a regular biscuit, however I found them perfect for stews and soups.  So quick to make will use them for most meals in place of store bought bread.  Will book mark this recipe!

This is the best biscuit recipe I have ever made.  They are different I might add, but don't let that spook you.  You don't have to roll them out nor do they crumble. And they are very delicious.  You can add cheese, garlic what have you or just plain with Jam is good.

this recipe for biscuits is so aweSome and delicious and so easy. I've never been a good biscuit maker, but these were great!!  Only used a cup of milk also. Maybe even a touch less. Heeding the directions that say to add the milk a little at a time is very wise. The only directions I would add would be to add the milk and stil till just combined and slightly sticky.

Perfect biscuits every time! Moist and buttery on the inside, with the perfect tender outside. Found this recipe last night in time to make them for dinner. My husband who is patient with me trying new recipes... took one bite and his instantly said,"WOW. These biscuits are delicious. Save that recipe!" My only thought is my first batch was a lil too wet. In my second batch I used only a smidge over 1 cup of whole milk, and they came out deliciously perfect!!!! Saving this recipe for life :)

Fast and Easy and they were good. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Took others advice. 1 cup of milk and a little more sugar. My butter was frozen so that helped with the dicing of the butter. My baking powder is older so I added a little extra of that and the biscuits came out big moist and fluffy. Thanks Great Recipe 
A KEEPER. Will try with garlic and cheddar cheese next time. :)

Great recipe, I sometimes reduce the milk by 1/4 cup.  The dough shouldn't be super soggy and for various reasons sometimes less milk is needed than others.  IF the dough is really wet the biscuits flatten out a little bit, so reduce the milk if you notice that the dough is too soggy.

Additionally I add 1/3 cup shredded cheddar and aprox 2 tsps of garlic powder. TASTES LIKE RED LOBSTER CHEDDAR BAY BISCUITS!

Just tried this one out today. It came out great. My boys loved it. I think I only used about 1 cup of milk, just an FYI. I gradually mixed it in just to be on the safe side. I'm making my third batch right now. Lol

I needed something super fast for breakfast to go with eggs. These were delicious and quick - yummy with a spot of jam or layered with eggs and cheese. Threw all the ingredients into food processor, added the cubed butter and milk and they were ready in no time.

Delicious! It is important that you use butter that has been chilled in the freezer. These are my go-to biscuits for breakfast or dinner.

I don't know how these came out runny or flat for anyone. The flour/liquid ratio was fine for me.  I did add flavour, though. Garlic & onion powders and some fresh chives.  They were quite good.

These biscuits are delicious and easy! I made these with my 3 year old son. He loved mixing and dropping them onto the pan. The biscuits turned out crunchy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. They were perfect! I substituted Splenda a for the sugar and used light butter and the flavor was still fantastic!

Super easy & nicely crispy. Best baked on pizza pan with holes on top pan which let's butter drip through to bottom pan since oven is at such hot temp.

These turned out great!  They were super easy to make and delicious!  Super moist on the inside and a perfect consistency.  I did, however, cut the time down to 10 minutes.  I think they would have been too hard had I left them in longer.  Mmmm...  perfect with our country bacon gravy and egg breakfast!!!

Very Good! Unfortunately I used an airbake pan that has no sides and liquid spilled onto the bottom of the oven. So they taste a little smoky. Not sure if it was too much milk like another reviewer said or if it was from the splash of vanilla that I added. Definitely trying again on a pan with sides!

These are THE BEST drop biscuits ever!  They don't even need any extra butter slathered on because they have such a nice, buttery flavor already!  They are very addicting!  I made mine a little too small, so can't wait to make again, regular biscuit size.  :)

I made these exactly as the recipe was written and they came out like cookies. They are too sweet and really flat. On a side note my 2 year old thinks they are cookies so she's pretty happy!

This was by far the best and easiest drop biscuits recipe I have ever tried!! They turned out light and fluffy and oh so delicious. I added about 1/2 a cup of grated old cheddar to mine and my family gobbled them up. This will be the only baking powder biscuit recipe I will ever use again. I read the reviews and only added 1 cup of milk and they were perfect. Thank you so much for sharing!!

I make these all the time, just as is.  It's a wonderful biscuit base and I have had no trouble with them rising or being light, melt in your mouth.  This recipe is super simple and perfect drop biscuits.

I would recommend adding some fresh herbs to the mixture as well and enjoying savory biscuits.  Delicious!

Pretty good. I cut the recipe in half and used 2% instead of whole milk. They were pretty good. Very easy. Only took me about 20 mins or so including baking.

I thought this was a great recipe! It was a big hit with my family! Just a few notes: I agree that this recipe is VERY buttery. I could tell while making it, so I cut down the butter (I was doing 1.5 recipe and it said to use 3/4c butter (1 1/2 sticks) and I just used 1 stick). This was the perfect amount of butter and no one even put butter on these biscuits! So make sure you taste one before you start slathering it in butter! Other than that, I followed the recipe except I baked the biscuits in a muffin tin instead of a cookie sheet. This was SO much easier and I highly recommend doing it this way. Thanks so much!

These were super simple to make and so yummy I had to control myself from eating all of them! I did make a couple changes though. I used room temperature margarine instead of butter, 1/2 cup soy milk due to dairy intolerance.

These were delicious, easy and allow you to add your own touches. I made them ahead of time and put them in the refrigerator until I was ready to bake them. Just for fun I added 4 tablespoons of asiago cheese and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. I also spread melted butter on before and after baking. The group said they were delicious! Served them with a pork loin and vegys...simple yet tasty meal.

I just made this today for my fiance's birthday. I've made several biscuits from allrecipe.com, including biscuits and gravy and cinnamon swirl biscuits. Hands down this is the best! I chose it because I wanted a recipe with sugar and ingredients that I have in stock (I don't have cream of tartar). I substituted whole milk for half and half, since I was out of milk (we aren't milk drinkers). I poured half and half in until the dough was sticky. I think it was close to 1 cup. It was Ohhh... Emmm... Geee, delish!!! The fiance said it was the best biscuits he has ever eaten.

I used this recipe as drop dumplings for chicken stew and they turned out fabulous! They were fluffy and really tasty. I used low fat milk instead of whole and it still worked well. I'm going to have to make them as regular biscuits next time.

Fantastic and light biscuits! I didn't have a whole half cup of butter so instead I used a half cup of butter flavored shortening, and although I'm sure that added more fat than necessary... they came out light and fluffy and perfect for butter and honey.  My husband and two year old absolutely LOVED them! :)

This was an absolutely amazing recipe, extremely easy to make. I ended up adding a little bit of extra flour because it was somewhat watery and used it as the crust for me and my husband's dinner this evening - Beef Pot Pie. It was amazing, very delicious, just the right amount of butter, very soft. Thanks :) Definitely will make again and again.

Exactly as titled... I decided to make breakfast for dinner in lieu of a run to the grocery store and didn't want to put a lot of effort into biscuits (one of those days)... to my surprise this recipe was perfect, I didn't have to add or subtract anything to make them work.. also, I appreciate not having to use shortening!

These biscuits are really good and buttery.  They almost have a more pastry-like texture than other biscuits I have made.  I did add a bit more flour, as the dough was a little watery, and I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  They stuck to my pizza stone a bit, so I may spray it with Pam next time.  I would like to try this same recipe with butter flavored shortening.

A good basic, quick and easy biscuit recipe.  Not the best with just butter though.  It needs something more, honey butter, jelly or as the recipe poster noted biscuits and gravy would be good.  My biscuit were flat, so next time I will have to maybe add more flour...or less milk?

Easy to make and tastes good.  My husband commented that they reminded him of the biscuits his grandmother used to make.  That right there made it all worth it.

Yum! I did 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white. I also used half 1% and half no fat cream because it's all I had. Then added some marbled cheese and hmm, hmm, hmm. Nice and doughy and perfect with my chicken rice soup :)

Very buttery but very tasty! I used unsalted butter but it really needed salted instead. Sprinkled a little kosher salt on top. Will definitely make again - great breakfast biscuit! Quick and easy.

I was looking for a quick bread recipe and tried this instead.  I'm so glad I did! This was so fast and really good.  Next time I'm gonna try putting it in the food processor to cut in the butter. I topped them w/ melted butter w/ rosemary when they came out of the oven and everyone was upset I only made 12.

These are great.  I stumbled upon them one sunday morning when I realized we were out of eggs!  Won't be buying store bought biscuits anymore!
