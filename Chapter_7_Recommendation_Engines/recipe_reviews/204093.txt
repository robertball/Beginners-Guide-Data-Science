The editors changed the first step to broiling, but I brush the zucchini with olive oil, garlic powder, and pepper, then Grill it face down until it sweats.   It gives the zucchini itself a nice flavor and the grill marks enhance appearance

This was a delicious combination of flavors. I was short on time, so I just chopped everything and sauteed it together--garlic and shallot first, then add zucchini and mushroom, and shrimp and tomatoes last, then top with fresh basil and cheese. It came out slightly saucy this way--I bet it would be great tossed with pasta.

Fabulous!! This was so delicious. Only minor changes... sprayed the zucchini with cooking spray rather than using olive oil, used small shrimp, and cut up a large portobello mushroom cap instead of using creminis. I also reserved the zucchini that I scooped out and sauteed that with the garlic, shrimp, etc. The basil, shrimp, tomatoes, and mushrooms are a perfect combination. So good. Thanks :)

Wow, this was wonderful! I also sauteed the mushrooms and chopped leftover zucchini in with the shallots. Just as they became tender, I added a dash of white wine. I think the wine gave it an even greater depth of flavor...mmmm. As this made more filling than was needed, I baked the extra in a square casserole dish, topped with a little extra parmesan. It cooked right alongside the sheet of zucchini, and I served the extra as a heaping spoonful on top of angel hair spaghetti. Rave reviews! Definitely will make again.

This was an awesome recipe. I have made it several times now and you can just about add and subtract anything you want. The first time I omitted the tomatoes and mushrooms.  I didn’t have grated Parmesan cheese so I used shredded parmesan cheese. I also added chopped green onions. I have made these with chopped chicken 2. They turn out great with whatever you add to them. My kids luv these!!!!

So easy and tastes great.  Sometimes I add dices chicken.  This time I could only locate small zucchinis in the store, to small to be worthy of stuffing.  So I turned the dish into a bake instead by dicing the roasted zucchini and placing all the ingredients in a casserole dish.

These were great!  Like others, I ended up using the scooped out zucchini pulp and sauteing with the garlic and onion (didn't have shallots).  Once this was done, I added everything else in and filled my zucchini.  I also didn't bother brushing the olive oil on them, I just sprayed them a bit first.  Very yummy, will make again for sure!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!! This recipe is amazing! I couldn't find large zucchini so I got "regular size" zucchini, cut them up, and cooked everything in a skillet on the stove. I am so impressed. No left overs between my boyfriend and I.

I used very little olive oil- sprayed my pan with Pam instead and then just misted olive oil as it cooked.  Omitted the mushrooms- not a fan- and used onion in place if the shallot.  I also used a drained can of diced tomatoes and dried basil (lots) as that is what I had on hand.  The zucchini part was kind of mushy.  We loved the shrimp filling though.  Next time I make this I will just make it as a casserole without any zucchini

The combination of ingrediants will leave taste buds wanting more. 
I used approx 3/4 lb shrimp and used onion instead of the shallot as that is what I had on hand.
Will be making again!

The filling is restaurant quality! Because I had a truly huge zucchini, I doubled the filling. If your zucchini is very thick, you may have to cook a bit longer until it is tender. I suggest adding dried rosemary to the filling mixture. And don't forget to spoon the juices that collect in the pan back over the dish - it's like really tasty gravy.

Wonderful! Hubby loved it! I think next time I'll season the zucchini before broiling. I'll also add more seasonings to the mixture. Great recipe!

Made this last night for dinner and it was fantastic.  The boyfriend was nervous about it and didn't think he'd like it but he ended up loving it and wishing I had more huge zuchini so I can make it again.

Why this recipe has so few reviews is weird to me.  It is divine!    It is relatively healthy and presentation is beautiful.  I had a HUGE zucchini so used 3/4 lbs shrimp and I seasoned the zucchini shells before filling them.  Tweak it if you like but try this recipe!

I followed the recipe to the exact measurements and had way too much stuffing left over. I would suggest halving the recipe or using at least 2 big zucchinis.

Like some of the others I made a few changes. I saluted the garlic, shallots in the olive oil. Then added the mushrooms. A little more than called for in the recipe as my family loves them. Then added the remaining ingredients and sautéed till the shrimp was half done. I did not make any changes to the prep for the zucchini.  I had made a beef stuffed zucchini at the same time as this one. Everyone preferred this recipe over the beef.

I forgot the fresh basil, only had dried. Next time I will make sure to get the fresh. This dish was all about fresh. I used a pound of shrimp,  and was able to stuff a couple more halves. Will add this to the favorite summer recipes list!!!??

Wow! Relatively easy to make, and AWESOME in flavor!! I made it as-is and wouldn't make one change. However, if I had a few different ingredients on hand I could use them, i.e. canned diced Roma tomatoes, onions, maybe even some seasoned salt. THANK YOU for posting this!!

The only changes I made was to omit the mushrooms (husband doesn’t care for them), and  grill the zucchini for the grill marks before putting it the oven.  The end result was fabulous.  The cooking time was spot on and the flavor was wonderful. This is a great use of the zucchini in your garden.

I love stuffed Zucchini but would not use the tomatoes.I just don't care for cooked tomatoes so would substitute red or green bell peppers chopped and also add some meat to the mixture,we love beef so might add some gr.beef.Hubby won't eat squash but I love it and will make two just for me!The shrimp would be excellent also!Good recipe!

This was amazing!  I will definitely make this dish again!  I modified it a little bit since my husband and I are watching our weight but it was just as good!

My spouse does not care for Zucchini or Shrimp, but for whatever reason loves this dish. I love stuffed Zucch's, no matter how they are done.

Very tasty!  Was simple, quick and made a great dinner.  My zucchinis weren't extra large, so I chopped them and mixed everything together.  Will definitely make again

This was pretty good.  I cooked the zucchini on the grill as directed by the writer of this recipe.  Finished off in the oven as directed.  Because I was afraid of it being tasteless, I seasoned the zucchini well.  The next time, I would serve in on a bed of brown rice...I feel it just needs something more.

Due to an allergy, I left out the garlic.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh because I never seem to have fresh mushrooms on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions and this turned out very well.  I did not use the zucchini from the hollowed boats, but put it in the freezer for a later use. Instead, I made "Barley Bake" from this site and used it to top off the zucchini boats.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

WONDERFUL.... So flavorful. Used button mushrooms, a whole tomato chopped, and onion instead of shallot. I had leftover spaghetti noodles so I threw a handful of that in too in order to entice the kids to try it. I think I'd leave out the noodles next time, but it was so good and I have leftovers for tomorrow!
