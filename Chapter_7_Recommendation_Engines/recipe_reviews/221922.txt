We are recent transplants to Florida and someone gave us a bag of kumquats.  I looked up recipe ideas and found this one.  We enjoyed it very much!  I made it following the instructions given and it was orangey and yummy. I discarded the insides and used the peels as directed, mincing them as much as I could in a small food processor and then in my blender.  The ice cream had small bits of peel, reminding me of the texture of coconut.  Iâ€™m only giving four stars for that reason (perhaps an extra good blender like a vitamix would work to get a completely smooth paste).  I would make again!
