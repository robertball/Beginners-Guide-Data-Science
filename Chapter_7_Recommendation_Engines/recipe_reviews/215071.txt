Fixes for when I messed up: I didn't have parchment, so I just used the cookie sheet. Turned out OK. Oily, but OK. When I tried to move them from the pan to the molds (I was using an upside-down mini muffin pan), I realized I'd waited too long and they were no longer pliable. So, I just tossed the muffin pan in the oven with the flatish cheese on top. The melted right over after about a minute. I really liked the shape.

I made these as round crisps to use as garnish on salad, so I left them flat after cooking. It was a night for Spanish tapas, so I used manchego cheese instead of parmesan (slightly softer and larger chunks when grated).  The recipes I found here and elsewhere didn't mention how thick to leave the cheese when putting it on the cookie sheet. However...after spooning it out, it was pretty obvious. I did one alone on a sheet as a test and that turned out to be an important step, since I changed my technique when I did the real ones. (Plus the chef needs a snack, right?)  I did three at a time on the cookie sheet. Because manchego is a softer cheese, there was more oil/moisture on the sheet and I didn't want a mess in the oven. They needed 8-10 minutes to get browned and crispy. They were quite soft and shapable when I took them out of the oven, but I put them on parchment paper on a cookie rack to cool. Once they were firm enough to pick up by hand, I removed the paper so they would dry out completely.  Delicious, crispy, and a great addition to the salad!!

I love these!  I've often made them as crisps for salad garnishes, but never thought of forming them into a basket.  I used them to hold Parmesan Spinach Balls as an appetizer at a dinner party last night and the presentation received rave reviews!  2" makes a SMALL bowl, FYI; the only thing I could drape them over was shot glasses!  I will make larger circles time.  THANKS for a great recipe, Terry!

These were fun to make. I remember in a restaurant making just small circles for I think salad. But, I wanted to try the bowl idea. I thought a 2" circle sounded kind of small. So, I used a piece of parchment and drew circles with a large coffee cup that was 3 1/2 inches. I flipped it over and spread the parmesan in the circles. Mine were kind of big, so they had to bake 8 minutes to get lightly browned. Once out of the oven I cooled for about 3 or 4 minutes or until they would loosen from the parchment. I then draped them over empty plastic fruit/applesauce cups I had saved. They held there shape nicely once they cooled. I thought a filling might be good for an oderb. But, I made mine kind of big, so they might work for something like a dip.

Another great way to serve parmesan. Try grating on top red and green peppercorns - not too fine, not too coarse - just before baking the parmesan.  The flavors blend very well and they look like freckles.  I make mine tiny - 1 inch - when I want to serve them flat for scooping vegetable dips like eggplant caviar.  Raw sesame seeds sprinkled before baking blend very well too.  Don't use toasted sesame - it will burn and will affect the taste.  Thanks for posting the basket version. I had never thought of it.

so easy, but such a show stopper - I filled with a spinach strawberry salad with red onion, one crouton, rapspberry vinagrette and topped it with candied almond chunks! Delish!

These make really great appetizer cups!  I used a mini muffin tin to drape small rounds. After cooled,I filled with a chopped caprese salad(tomato, basil, mozz chopped fine).

Simple recipe. I did mine in an 8 inch non stick pan.  Only recommendation I can give is don't make them so thick.  I think I did mine too thick.  Although it worked, formed into basket shape, they weren't crispy by the time dinner came along.  I think that was because they were too thick. If I'm wrong let me know.  Going to try again but next time not so thick.

Yum, I love these Terry! I too just made rounds to add to my spinach, quinoa and cucumber salad which I'm enjoying right now. I'm going to have to think of something clever to place in the bowls as they do sound just adorable. Thanks so much!

I was terribly diappointed in the outcome.  I ended up just doing flat circles after several failed attempts at baskets.  The taste was wonderful but the recipe yields no where near 24 baskets.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and was only able to make 16-18; not good when you're planning a baby shower.

These are great!  I filled them with another recipe from this site - caprese salad with balsamic reduction.  Yummy!  I pressed them into muffin tins to try to get the shape of a little cup. My only problem was that I let them cool a little too much before doing that...they kinda wanted to stay flat, but I still made it work.

First had this on Sapphire Princess cruise with fettuccini in it.  They melted cheese in a frying pan, turning once and then pressing over a small bowl, but this didn't work well for me.  I decided on size of bowl I wanted, then sprinkled parmesan cheese in a circle on waxed paper.  Heated in oven at 350 for 5 minutes, then cooled for 1-2 minutes.  Placed  waxed paper with hot melted cheese on it in a small bowl.  I then added another small bowl on top of the cheese in the first bowl, pressing down to conform hot cheese and make a cheese bowl.  Let completely cool, then removed and easily peeled off waxed paper.

I've been making these for years as round crisps to accompany salad, Italian meals, or just good, quick snacks! I sprinkle the Parmesan with garlic powder, sometimes Italian herbs---wonderful! !

I make this recipe quite often, but instead of making baskets I let it cool as a flat crispy.  These are absolutely addicting.  I made it exactly as stated with the exception of the cooling as a basket.  What a great treat with a nice glass of wine or as a side with a good pasta dinner.  Fantastic -- but be careful.  You'll be making these often once you taste it.

This works great in a larger bowl size as a salad bowl. I have done this several times with great results.  Many raves.

I make parmesan crisps all the time but it never occurred to me to take one more step and form them into little bowls and fill with your favorite choice of goodies! Thanks so much for the idea!
