To make it more like a souffle, I separate the eggs and beat the whites until soft peaks.  Then fold it into the rest of the mixture and bake.  It is much lighter and better.

Just a note to make the recipe easier, 4 tablespoons is 1/4 cup. Saves alot of measuring!

I'm submitting my own review and also want to give credit to my friend Lori who gave this recipe to me a number of years ago.  It was passed down to her by her mother, and possibly her grandmother.

Simple and delicious.  The recipe is good as written, but to make richer, add some cheese in the corn as well as on top.  Ritz crackers on top is delicious as well.

I used the suggestion of whipping the egg whites and folding in; it browned quickly so I covered with foil for the last thirty minutes so as not to get it too dark. It's sweet and creamy, almost like a dessert!

This was a very tasty corn casserole, but certainly not a souffle'...it much too heavy.  My family enjoyed it and I'll probably make it again even though I know it isn't a souffle'...I'm still looking.

This was the first Souffle I ever attempted to make, and I was very happy with it. I didn't add the sugar because corn is sweet enough already, and I threw in some Parmesan cheese in the batter as well.

My Grandma used to make this every year, she calls it twice stirred corn, because 15 minutes into baking open the oven and stir the corn.  That keeps the middle from being under cooked and prevents the edges from burning. This way it only needs to cook at 350 for 1 hour.

No one cared much for this dish. Maybe it's just a matter of taste. Seems too bland. I wouldn't make it again. I did find an alternate recipe that's much better, try the Awmesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole instead. It's much better.

This was really yummy. After two bites hubby said "This is a keeper!" and I agree. I made two minor changes. I used 2% milk (because it 's what I had in the house) and I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I will most definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

My husband didn't like this--he said he'd prefer I'd just given him creamed corn :/ I did as suggested and separated the yolks & whites & beat the whites before folding in, but it still didn't rise much. It forms a sort of crust on top which is very pleasing to look at, but was the source of my husband's dislike of this recipe. 3 stars because he still ate almost all of it, but I won't make it again--I suggest the recipe "Marian's Creamed Corn" from this site for those of you looking for a good corn side dish and NOT a souffle.

Made this last week as written-MINUS 1 EGG- when my in-laws came over. My father-in-law wanted the recipe! He is the best cook I've ever known and when he asks for a recipe it's like winning a trophy. Whether this is actually a souffle or not it still tastes great!

This is my first attempt at making souffle and I'm really happy about how easy it was and how nicely it came out. I took common reviewers' suggestions of adding cheese and separating and beating egg whites to soft peaks.

The dish is a bit on the bland side - I found that adding some white pepper, black cracked pepper and fresh nutmeg really adds dimension to the dish.

This is perfect.  It tastes like the corn "pudding" my Mom made from scratch and served at all the family holiday get togethers.  Since I don't want to start with ears of corn from the garden, I can use this whenever I want.

This has been a longtime favorite of mine.  Also strictly a Thanksgiving food growing up. However I put a little bit of butter in mine.

Very good. I might have put a little too much sugar, was very sweet.  Next time I might try with green chilis for a Mexican flavor.

I'm watching my weight so I used splenda instead of the sugar and egg beaters instead of eggs. I thought it was very tasty and a little sweet. We all loved it so I will definitely make this again.

Made for our Christmas family dinner and changed it a bit (of course)....did not add sugar, added 1 t. dry mustard, salt and pepper - added chopped onion, and green and red bell pepper sautéed first in 2 T. butter.  Used heavy cream instead of milk.  Whipped egg whites and folded into mixture.  Used 2.5 quart round casserole dish greased with butter and dusted with breadcrumbs.  The mixture barely fit into this bowl and I was worried it would run over, so stirred it a few times during cooking.  Looked beautiful and tasted great.  Did not serve right away and kept warm covered and in a 200 degree oven with no problem.  It was declared a "keeper" by family for future meals!  Thank you for the recipe and for all the comments!

I have mede this every year for either Christmas or Thanksgiving, and the whole family loves it. It's good old-fashined comfort food. I really should make this more! Fool-proof and yummy! Nice sweetness on the holiday plate. Looks impressive, very easy.

I made this last Thanksgiving, and my sister pretty much devoured the whole thing and insists on making it for every Holiday dinner. What a great comfort food. Goes with just about anything, plus its very quick and easy. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was tasty but I was expecting it to be somewhat light like a souffle.  Instead it was more like a casserole and a very heavy taste albeit a good one.

When I made this recipe, I used a souffle dish...tall and heavy, so this would come out in souffle form. The baking time was an hour and forty minutes- there was no jiggling in the center of the souffle. It is marvelous!

I have made this great recipe several times - I follow it exactly. It is always good and goes quickly due to second helpings by most! Thank you.

This recipe is real easy to make. I found this recipe several years ago and have made various alterations and somehow, it never fails! I add a fifth can of corn in the form of an 11oz. can of Mexicali Corn, which has chopped green & red peppers in it.   As to the corn, I will drain the two cans of whole corn and put into the blender with the creamed corn.  I find the blended combination makes a better base.  I follow the recipe from there.  However, just before I pour the mix into the pan I drain the can of Mexicali corn and fold it into the batter to give that added texture & color.  Give it a shot for a different take on this classic.

This is a terrific recipe.  I wanted a very rich product, so I added 1/3 c melted butter, used 1/2 and1/2 instead of milk,  I drained the corn.  WOW is this great.  Thank you so much for posting it!  Oh, and I added some salt and pepper.

Cooked at 400 degrees for 1 hr.  It turned out so wonderful rich and creamy, just what I hoped for.

It's a hit!  But I only make half at a time.  It's really a big recipe and I like to use at as a side dish with lots of others on the autumn table.  I use almond milk, in lieu of dairy.

A couple of years ago, we were discussing the menu for Thanksgiving dinner and hubby asked if I would make a corn soufflé. I hid my panicked, "this is going to be super hard to make and probably come out wrong" reaction and agreed to try. I searched for a recipe and found this one. Contrary to my first reaction, it was so easy and he loved it. I make it for every holiday now and occasionally just because to surprise hubby. Big hit, even at our Cub Scout Thanksgiving meal. I meant to write this sooner, but kept forgetting until now, when I was going through making a list of everything I need for this year's Thanksgiving.

Everyone loved it! Kids and hubbie gobbled it up! Followed recipe exactly. Might try a little less sugar next time. Worthy of special occasion but easy enough for anyday!

I was disappointed by this dish. It was too sweet and kind of like eating a corn custard. I guess I expected it to be cakier...Not bad but I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

All the adults loved this recipe.  It was very good.  A little to much egg, but with a souffle, I guess you should expect that.  I actually had my guests ask for the recipe.  Thanks.
