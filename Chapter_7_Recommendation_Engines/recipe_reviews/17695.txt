This soup is way good! I made only a couple of changes to the recipe; first I cooked the bacon in the same pot I used to make the soup, I drained most of the fat and then added the butter and made the roux. I then deglazed the pan with 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth followed by only 4 cups of milk. I think the bacon and chicken broth gave the soup great flavor. I have tried about 4 other recipes and they always come out tasting like mashed potato soup. I will most definitely make it again.

OMG --- I love potato soup and this is a GREAT recipe. I did however make a couple of changes to it. I sauted the chopped green onions in the roux to soften them a little. I then followed the recipe until after I added the milk. I then whisked approx 1/2 cup of flour with some heavy cream in a separate bowl. I slowly added this to the the soup and stirred constantly. I then poured about another cup of heavy cream to the soup. This made it thicker than the original recipe made and hearty too. Let me tell you it was a HIT!!! My husband went to chef school for 3 years and LOVED it. I then took some to work the next day and my staff loved it as well. This is definitely a keeper!!!!!

I made this soup to surprise a dear co-worker who really wanted potato soup.  She and everyone loved it! And now I am being asked to make it often.  The best suggestion is to "truly" bake the potatoes.  I also decided to some of the bacon fat in the roux for more flavor.  I did not serve the same day but rather chose to refrigerate overnight for flavor.  This is a very thick soup therefore the next day needed to be thinned with milk/half & half but the flavor was excellent.  I chopped the bacon before cooking and any lartger bits, broke them prior to adding to soup.  I held back some to add upon serving along with finely shredded cheddar and sour cream.  This is a killer soup!  Thank you.

My family loves this soup.  I use fat free milk, 2% sharp cheddar cheese, the precooked bacon bits, and light sour cream and have had no complaints!  I don't cook the potatoes in the microwave.  I boil them on the stove and make the roux while waiting for the potatoes to cook.  I also do what some suggested and cook the onions in the butter to give it a bit more punch.

This soup deserves 10 stars.  I swear by this soup in the winter.  My boyfriend loves it and requests that I make it often.  It's great served with Cheddar Biscuits and a green salad.  Must try - you WON'T be disappointed.

YUM!! This is a delicious soup recipe.  I omitted the bacon (we're veggies) and used fat free sour cream--excellent.  Also, I didn't have the time to bake the potatos, so I diced them up and boiled them until soft.  Then I mashed up about 1/2 and left the others in small chunks for the soup--made it nice and hearty, and turned out perfect.

My eldest son can't stop eating this soup. Got positive feedback from everyone who ate it. Don't make the mistake of adding additional flour to the roux because the soup thickens considerably when you add the potatoes. Very creamy.I made this a day ahead of time so added 2/3 green onion at that time. Added rest of gr. onion, sour cream, and bacon just before serving(so bacon wouldn't get mushy)the next day. (I cooked the bacon well done in the oven and chopped it medium dice, although the recipe does not specify.)Garnished with grated cheddar,left over green onion, and a little diced tomato (for a festive look). Requires fair amount prep time with stirring soup, and cooking bacon etc., but would make this again! Next time I will use at least part bacon grease in the roux to enhance the flavor.

I doubled this recipe and adapted it for the crockpot. I just peeled and quartered my potatoes, rinsed them and threw them in the crockpot and covered them with organic chicken broth. Once they were fork-tender, I just mushed them in the crockpot with my potato masher (for a chunkier soup) and then threw the rest of the ingredients in. I did not need the flour or butter as the potatoes thickened up nicely on their own and I only used one 12 ounce can of evaporated milk, to keep the soup thick. I did not add the sour cream only because I felt like she could add that at a later date, if she decided to freeze it OR she could add it to her family's taste. For a more baked potato taste, I added sauteed green onions, chives and fresh minced garlic and I doubled the cheese. I made this for a new mom-friend of mine but her and her family loved it. Very easy and re-warms like a champ. Very bendable and quite budget friendly.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  There was no mention of spices of any kind so the soup was rather bland.

Really good...I added some garlic too for a little flavor, and added milk when reheating (which it also does well) because it was a little thick.

Made this soup for the first time on Christmas Eve along with a hearty chicken chili that always gets rave reviews. Should have tripled this recipe!  It was the belle of the ball.  Almost had people licking the inside of the crock pot!  But then my friends are kind of like that...hopefully you hang with a more civilized crowd.

To me this soup is a bit to thick, so I have to add milk when I make it. This recipe comes in handy on cold nights when supper isn't ready, considering we usually have these ingredients in the house.

So much better than the half milk half chicken broth potato soup I made before! Rather bland and floury-tasting without the cheese and sour cream, but the with it--man! Delicious! It's a thick, creamy, rich soup. Perfect for chilly and/or rainy days. I used the leftover bacon drippings and supplemented some margarine with olive oil to make the 2/3 c. butter. I also microwaved the 4 potatoes then peeled and cubed them and that worked perfectly. So quick and easy, love it! Thanks!

Great recipe for when you need baked potato soup but don't have a lot of time. I used frozen diced potatoes and just thawed them before adding them to the soup.

It was better than I thought it would be. However, I added more cheese than the recipe calls for and just a tad more flour. It didnt seem to be getting thick enough so i added 1 1/2 tbs. more. Delicious, hope this helps.

This soup was very thick and was perfect. I would suggest cutting up the potatoes smaller, however. I would rate this overall 4.5 because it is a bit too thick. I wouldnt suggest using this soup in a big party.

I made many of the suggested modifications from other reviews, including boiling the potatoes, including whipping cream and chicken broth, and reducing the milk and butter.  I will definitely make this again!

We eat this at least twice a month at our house. The only thing I do differently is to add a little cayenne and garlic powder. Also, the bacon is just a topper, because it tends to get soggy, and I blend it all a little to make it nice and smooth and thick. The leftovers are awesome, too! The sour cream really makes it, it adds a tang. I have used yogurt in a pinch when I didn't have the cream, and it worked okay.

This makes such a yummy and hearty soup that "eats like a meal".  I am a vegetarian so I used Morningstar Farms veggie bacon which was very tasty.  I also used Pepper Jack and Colby Jack cheeses which is what I had around.  *yum* It is bland as seasoned but I added stuff and that makes the recipie good because you can adjust it to your preferences!

This is restaurant quality potato soup. As good as any I have ever had. The only thing that I do differently,basically because it is easier,is that I cube the potatoes with the skin on so that it is chunkier.SJS9

This was fantastic.  Perfect Christmas Eve dish.  I doubled everything except the milk.  It just seemed like too much and we like a really thick tater soup.  Served the green onions and bacon on the side for guests to add accordingly.  Thank you so much!

I've been making this (almost) same recipe for about 10 years.  It's to die for.  The only things I do different is use ham instead of bacon...I buy a ham steak and cut into bite size cubes, cut up the potatoes leaving the skin on, and use 1 1/2 c. cheese.  If you want to be really decadent, serve in a hollowed out mini sourdough round using the bread for dunking.  Sublime on a cold winter day.  Also, this soup is way better the next day but you will have to add a little milk as it will be very thick.

MMmmmm mmmmmm goood!!!!! The only changes I made is that I quartered my potatoes and boiled them (it takes less time). I didn't have green onions so I added onion flakes instead and I added in some frozen corn. It was spectacular!!!!

I have been making this recipe for years and all my family and friends absolutely love it!  I have made this soup so many times that I don't measure anything except the flour and butter (I think it is important to have equal portions of these two).  I use at least double the potatoes than the recipe calls for as I like a thicker soup.  Note that the first time I made this I didn't stir the milk constantly and ended up burning it!  So, definitely keep a watchful eye on your pot.

This soup tastes awesome! Great for a lazy Sunday afternoon. I made a few modifications to the original recipe to shave off a few calories. I only used 1/4 c of butter and the rest olive oil to make the roux. I also used skim milk, light sour cream, and turkey bacon. I added an extra potato to make sure it would still be thick enough since I was using skim milk instead of whole milk. My husband likes potatoes so-so, but he really loved this soup! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this recipe without the sour cream and it was good but I'm sure it would be even better with it. Next time I would add the sour cream to the soup and sprinke the onion, bacon, and cheese on top of of the soup instead of stirring it all in.

It's only me, so I made it for 2 servings. Only needed 1 very large baked potato. Used 1/2 veg stock and 1/2 evaporated milk for the milk. Cooked a bit of onion and garlic in the butter before adding the milk/stock. No bacon. Otherwise followed the directions and it was exquisite. A small cup was so rich it made for a quick dinner. Can't wait to see what it tastes like tomorrow! Thanks, Carol, for taking the time to share your recipe.

I hate writing bad reviews, but this soup was really bad. It had no taste what-so-ever. I even made it twice, hoping that I had made a mistake the first time. But sadly the second time was just as bad as the first time. I followed the recipe exactly and still don't understand why it turned out the way it did. Normally I would revisit this recipe with my own personal changes added, but with the previous results, I just don't think Baked Potato Soup will be made anytime in the near future.

I have to agree with everyone. THe recipe has some flaws, but really good in the end.   I made my rue with the green onions and garlic and two stalks of celery.  I used less salt bacon as well. I also Boiled the potatos, and used yukon golds, as i find them creamier. Also, i didn't totally mash them. Just used a hand masher a few times so there were chunks still.    Great recipe though!

Very rich, very creamy, and very delicious. Super fast too as I had pre baked the potatoes. The bacon should go last though as some of the bits got all soggy and limp (But I just like crispy bacon, so maybe it's me) DH loved this. I only had skim milk, bread flour, freeze dried chives maybe 2 T worth and Mexican blend cheese in the house. Great soup on a rainy night here. Thanks!

so boyfriend hasnt' issued his vote yet but i did make a few maijor changes.. first being i used two tabs of butter not 2/3 a cup i also used soy milk and red onion rather than green (green is a garnish)rather than bacon i used some left over sprial ham the boyfriend kindly parted with. the cheese and sour cream stayed but i used a bit less of the cream and added some organic chicken broth (it was on sale!) a bit more fresh ground black peper and some cajuin spices and garlic oh and a pinch of thyme too...soup seemed a little thin still so i added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up and it looks great! even the boyfriends brother who hates soymilk with a passion said it smelled good in here will post the restults after dinner :)

Delicious, but so rich. Didn't realize what a huge amount of butter it was until I saw it in the pot! I used skim milk, light sour cream and 8 slices Turkey bacon--slightly less fattening and still tasted super rich. It needed salt though (1 tsp. worked). To cut the baking time for the potatoes, do 10 min. in the microwave (poke w/ fork first, of course) and then 20 min. in the oven at 375. By the time I had cooked/crumbled the bacon and added the broth and milk to the roux (following another reviewer) the potatoes were ready.

Very Yummy! Although I did add an additional cup of milk at the end as it was too thick and I also added more salt and pepper but overall I was very pleased with the results and will make it again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was a really good recipe.  We made it in the slow cooker and let it cook all day.  My only suggestion is to add extra cheese if you like it cheesy.

Delicious Soup, I set out to make something similar to Panera Bread Co.'s Baked Potato Soup - but this turned out so much better. I added extra cheese, extra milk, garlic, herbs  de Provence, and (my secret weapon) white truffle oil. I know this will become a regular dish for my family.

Excellent soup! The only thing I changed was I added about three times the salt...but then again I always load potatoes with tons of salt. This was fantastic and easy to make! Thanks!

I made a few adjustments to this recipe, but nothing too major. I used 2% milk in hopes of cutting back some of those calories! I also swapped out 2 cups of milk for 2 cups of chicken stock. I also used a light sour cream. I did the potatoes in the microwave to save myself time, and used a pouch of real bacon bits. It was a huge hit and I'll definitely be making it again

This is a great potato soup recipe. I made this for my boyfriend one night and we both enjoyed it. It is filled with so much flavor and is thick and creamy, the way potato soup should be.

This recipe was very good, but I tweaked it some...I used 3 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups milk, I also added thyme. The broth added depth to the flavor, I thought.  I wouldn't add the green onions to the soup next time, just enough for my taste on top when serving.  Overall though, this was quite good.

My husband really enjoyed this soup.  It was perfect for a cool day.  I made the following changes.

1.  browned the onion in the used bacon grease and butter to make the roux.  I also added some garlic powder to this.
2.  1 can chicken broth
3.  5 cups milk
4.  made the potatoes a bit chuncky

I recommend this soup.  It hit the spot.

Yummy!!
I just had a big bowl of this soup and it is delicious!!
I didn't have time to bake the potatoes so I boiled them instead. I also added 1/2 cup of water before adding the cheese(the soup is super thick) and 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. 
Its a hit in this house!

This soup tasted exactly like a baked potato. It was very good. I served it in a bread bowl and my husband enjoyed it even though he's not big on creamy soups. The only thing was that the left overs weren't as good as it was freshly made.

I have been using recipes from allrecipes.com for several years and have never felt compelled to write a review until now.  This baked potatoe soup recipe is fantastic.  My husband does not like any soup but he loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing.  I will definately make this again and again.

I couldn't believe how well this soup came out, it was even better than some I've had at restaurants. I pre-cooked the bacon and chopped it before adding it to the soup, and added some of the drippings as well. I also used 5 potatoes instead of 4, and I left out the sour cream and added crushed red pepper to make it a little more spicy. I highly recommend it!!

and they all wanted the recipe.
For the picky eaters,I served the bacon,
cheddar cheese, sour cream,
and onions on the side.

I've been wanting to make a potatoe soup for sometime.  I didn't give it much thought except for all the potatoes I would be using.  I never imagined I would be serving it from a skillet.  I read over the comments and went with Jamie's suggestions of Chicken broth and reduced my milk.  Perfect, both on density and taste!  What's for dinner?  Potatoe soup from mommys frying pan!

I gave it four stars because I did tweak the recipe a little.  I started by microwaving the potatoes.  Then I browned the bacon and removed most of the fat leaving some for flavor.  Added the butter to the bacon fat and continued the directions.  When it was time to add the milk, I used 2 cups chicken broth and 4 cups milk like other readers suggested.  Definitely a must have in the recipe box!

Yum! This is a keeper.  I made this with microwaved baked potatoes and we still felt it turned out great.  Instead of green onions, I used sweet yellow ones. I softened them in the butter before adding the flour to the roux.

I came across this recipe the other day, and finally got around to making it. It turned out fantastic! Like a lot of other people I added a little bacon grease to the roux, and it tastes amazing! I would definitely recommend it especially if you're not a very good cook. :-)

This is an easy recipe.  I made exactly the way the recipe directed the first time.  It was great.  The second time, I added garlic to the butter, used skim milk, pre-cooked bacon, and did not add sour cream.  The soup was still delicious!  I will make this many more times!!

So easy & so good! Baked potato soup is my favorite & I lightened it up a bit. I used butter/canola oil combo, turkey bacon,non fat milk & light sour cream. I had no green onions so I sauteed shallots with the bacon & made my roux in the same pan. LOTS of flavor!

I am only giving four stars because I added spices to it. I saw that someone else said it was bland, so I added garlic (fresh)and some onion powder. It came out delicious and I've made it several times. It tastes like TGI Friday's baked potato soup. YUMMY!

This was delicious.  I substituted 2 cups chicken stock for some of the milk, but it was still rich enough.  For those who want to add spices, this tastes like a loaded baked potato.  You don't want to add any spices that you wouldn't put on a baked potato.  Delicious, but rich.

Used onion salt.  Also didn't even add the bacon or sour cream and it still turned out nice.

My family's favorite meal!! I often use white onions instead of green since it's what I have on hand. And I cook the potatoes in the microwave to speed up the process. Otherwise, awesome as is.

Excellent!  I eliminated the onions because I didn't have any.  I think next time I will make sure to put them in.  I also sliced one baked potato into cubes and added it in.  Also added garlic salt instead of salt for more flavor.  Will make this again!

Yummy! I use whole wheat flour and it works great! The key is to bake the potatoes. We even use the salted skins in the soup to add nutrition and little bit of crunch. Very tasty!

I made this soup for my husband who was sick and the weather was crappy.  It was DELICIOUS!  I boiled the potatoes while making the bacon and used bacon fat to substitute the butter. I used 2 cups of chicken stock and 4 cups of 2% milk.  I added a little garlic and onion seasoning and omitted the salt. I woke my husband up, fed him the soup, and he loved it...so did I! I did use maple bacon and when I reheat will add a little milk to thin the sauce a bit. Overall amazing.  Advice: don't mash up the potatoes too much...good sized chunks taste fabulous a gets away from the mashed potato consitency others were talking about.  Enjoy! It was a hit for us!

Well, I'll admit that due to lack of time, I cheated and used Instant Mashed Garlic Potatoes. I used a half cup of butter/flour for the roux and can't say that I really measured the milk; just kept adding until it looked right. It was just a tad bland for my taste so I added in some seasonings and a few drops of liquid smoke to help compliment the bacon. This is an incredibly satisfying soup and one that's going to stay in my recipe box. Thank you Carol!!

meh- there was way too much roux- i would use 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. flour if I were ever to try it again. The soup was sooo thick, I had to add several more cups of milk. This only kept it the right consistency for a little while, then it stared thickening again. I also could taste the flour in the soup. I probably wont make this again.

I doubled the recipe, took it to a potluck, and didn't bring any leftovers home.  Success!  I cooked the green onions in the roux before adding the milk, just to soften them up.  I used whole wheat flour, because that's all I had, and it gave the soup a hearty look and texture.  I made it the day before and didn't want to re-heat the sour cream and burn it in the crock pot, so I just provided sour cream to add on the side.  The one drawback to me was that baking the potatoes and then scooping them out of the skins took way longer than I expected.  Next time I do this, I'll probably boil the potatoes after peeling and slicing them, to cut down on prep time.

My sons loved this, absolutely loved it! My older one ate it for breakfast and took it in his lunch, that is how much he loved this soup. I'd give it 5-stars except I thought it was really starchy. I know potatoes ARE a starch, but somehow baking them brings it out in a way that didn't work for me as much as it did for my boys!

I found this recipe last year when I needed to make something hearty for a fundraiser for work --- It was the 1st soup gone!!  I did make a couple of modifications, but made it again this year and was gone in even less time (under 30 mins!).  I did cut the salt back a bit because of all the bacon; I opted to saute the green onion a bit first before adding to cut down on the raw onion taste, but something a bit milder; and I added a dash of garlic powder just because.  Regardless, it's a keeper and can easily be modified to fill a 5 qt crockpot for occasions when you have to feed more than 6.  Thanks to the author for posting!!!

I thought this was a fairly easy recipe to follow and make. I did add some oregano and galic salt (another review's suggestion) and added more potato. Overall I thought it was a pretty good meal, easy to follow recipe, and good everyday ingredients. I would recommend it as a good appetizer.

i thought it was a great recipe.  i did leave out the onion because we don't like it.  however i did change a couple of things.  i added garlic with the butter so it can have that favor.  i would out of bacon so i used bacon bits that you would be in salads.  my husband just loved it!!!!!

Great recipe!

Modified it to accommodate our taste: Little more salt/pepper, used 3 potatoes, 6 strips of bacon, 5 c. milk. 

Definitely making this again.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made one small change as our family doesn't eat onions.  I added 2 T chopped garlic to the butter and let it saute for a minute before making the roux.  It was so good.  Will be making this again and again!

This was tasty enough.  Easy to put together, too.  Very, very thick.  Almost too thick.  Very rich too.  I wouldn't make this again, just because of the fat content.  I will say though, that we got at least double the servings out of this than is listed.  So hopefully, I didn't consume over 100 grams of fat last night....lol.  I wish I had a chance to prepare it with skim milk, I think it would have not been so thick (almost pasty) and would have cut down on the fat a little.  (I prepared this with a family member last night).  I wonder if one could use light sour cream?  Save some green onion for a garnish.

Picky hubby loved this one. He even brought the leftovers to work with him so he could share it with some of the guys! Still good the next day but had the consistency of mashed potatoes.  I had to really thin it out with some milk and chicken broth.

My hubby LOVE potato soup.  I made this 3 times in each winter month.  He raved over this version! I added cheese to mine.  Note:  It was much better the next day!

Very good. I lightened it using 2% milk, 2% cheese, reduced fat sour cream, and only 3 pieces of turkey bacon. Still extremely rich! I think next time I'll leave the green onions out as a garnish as my two youngsters were suspicious of the green things. ;)

I thought this was the best potato soup I have ever had. I hate to say this but better than my moms. It's rich and creamy, the bacon and sourcream give it just the right pizazz.

This soup was very tasty.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  Changes I made because I was also cooking for kids (they ate it but weren't crazy about it) I didn't cook with the green onions, but instead served them as a garnish and I left out the sour cream entirely.  I didn't miss it.

I have always loved potatoe soup, and I rank this one right up there. Prep is a little time consuming but it is well worth it. As far as changes, I can't think of any 'cept salt and pepp to yo taste.

This recipe is wonderful!  I sautee the onions in the butter and bake the potatoes the night before, but otherwise I keep everything the same.   Sometimes I have to thin it out by adding a bit more milk at the end.  Since I love salt and pepper, I add mine to the bowl instead of adding more to the pot.

Is the bacon cooked or not?  The recipe doesn't say.  I think it is cooked before being added to the soup, but not saying to cook or not cook the bacon might be a problem for a beginner cook who wanted to make a nice soup recipe.

This is good though don't get me wrong, i am glad i tried it.

Yum! The family loved it! I used 6 potatoes and microwaved them as I was short on time. Peeled them after and just slightly mashed them with fork. I just added salt, pepper, garlic salt and a handful of cheese to the soup during cooking and saved all the goodies to top the soup in our bowls. The soup is very thick, though. We served with crusty french bread and a salad. I don't cook well at all and was very pleased with this soup! Easy!

My husband really loved this soup.  I added a bit more salt, and garlic to add a little more flavor as with cooking the onions with the butter as per another user.  I did use precooked real bacon pieces but will try this again using bacon grease to make the roux.

Look no further for the perfect soup...add an additional cup of milk if you prefer your soup thinner.  I make this at least twice a month during the winter & it freezes well!

EXCELLENT! My boyfriend is a picker eater and he loved this! I had a few changes though. I used 3 cups milk and 2 cups (one can) of chicken broth. I used 1 tsp each of salt/pepper, and more to taste. I ommitted the bacon and used one 15.25 oz can of corn. Next time I think I will add pieces of ham. This recipe would be perfect as a starter soup to any great meal, or in a bread bowl for a meal itself! I think just the milk/chicken broth and cheese would make a great cheese chowder base. After eating it, my boyfriend and I thought it'd be great to garnish with crispy bacon crumbles, shredded cheese and green onions or chives.

This soup was wonderful.  Instead of using 6 cups of milk, I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk.  It made it really rich which we loved.  Also, in the future, I would peel the potatoes and bake them.  Then I would just toss them in the food processor and add them to the mix.  I was really happy with how this soup tasted, and even my one year old who doesn't like potatoes gobbled it up!

This is a fun soup to make, and the whole family enjoys it. The soup does thicken up considerably the longer it sits, so don't be afraid to thin it out with additional milk. It is a little bland (perfect for kids!) so I added additional salt and pepper, hubby added red chili pepper flakes, and I like the suggestion of a previous reviewer to use some of the bacon grease in the roux for additional flavour so I will try that next time. You could add anything you want to boost the flavour in this recipe! I'll never make plain old potato soup again!

I try to cook everything as healthy as I can, and it’s a major bonus when it doesn’t taste like I’ve left any of the good stuff out.  I boiled my peeled potatoes and onions in water w/ chicken bullion, about 5 cups of water.   I did use butter and flour as directed, but only 2 cups of 1% milk, 1/3 c fat free half and half,  and the rest was the bullion water I used to boil the potatoes. I used Hormel precooked bacon which saved a few calories, and omitted sour cream and cheese. I planned to add some, but it was so good like this I decided not to.

Awesome and very few simple ingredients.  The rue was simple to make.  Make sure you do all your prep since it goes quickly once the rue is done.  It was better than any other baked potato soup I’ve had in restaurants.  Besides you can measure you salt intake.

No changes are needed, it's DELICIOUS!!  It's really GOOD & quite thick... I microwaved the potatoes instead of baking, (to save time!) then peeled off the skin & cut into cubes...The second day, it needed to be ''thinned'' out with milk, but it still had great flavor & it's VERY FILLING!!!  My husband had never had double baked potato soup before & he LOVED this... It's great Comfort Food in these colder months!!  Will make this more often!!

Super delicious. I made a few tweaks. 2 cups of chicken stock substituted for 2 of the cups of milk, used hatch chili infused bacon, added a half teaspoon of bacon grease to the roux. I also pealed and cubed the potatoes and boiled them in water for about 15 minutes and then combined all ingredients and let them cook at high on a crock pot for an hour.

This soup was great, I made it with ham instead of bacon, but it still turned out really good.

This was delicious! I did make a few adjustments though nothing major. I put in 3 cups each of milk and half and half. And my crew doesn’t like “real” onions, so we used onion powder instead. It turned out fantastically, the kids who normally avoid leftovers were begging to take some to school the next day!

It turned out amazing.  The family loved it.
I did a whole bag of potatoes and kept the other ingredients the same. 
Had enough for dinner another night.

I changed the recipe using  2 cups of instant potato mix as I wasn't up to baking potatoes.  It came out very tasty.  I will definitely be making this soup again.

Quick! I started the potatoes in the oven for over an hour this morning then turned off the oven. I came home and took them out and made this soup in about 15 minutes.  It tasted like I spent a lot of time on it!

Will definitely make this again. The only small changes I will make will be to halve the amount of onion and substitute some milk for cream to bring the thickness down a bit. So tasty.

Made some minor changes. My bf peeled some potatoes before I could bake them so I had to boil them. (8 regular sized ones). Made the bacon in the soup pot, drained the oil and then added butter and flour. I also took the other reviewers advice and used 2 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of milk. Once thickened a bit I added the remaining ingredients but saved the sour cream for last. I also didn't have chives so I used green onions but they were way stronger so used way less than a cup. I think they might be better to use as garnish. Also added a bit of extra cheese as garnish to make it even better!

I have an electric stove and move the soup to a cool burner to mix in the sour cream and final ingredients as I wanted to keep the silky base texture and not thicken the roux base further.  It has reheated very well. I've tried 2 other recipes, this is my favorite.

Absolutely loved this. Filling, comforting, and delicious. Added a little extra pepper, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (because my family loves garlic) and 1/4 tsp onion powder while going light on the green onions (only because we didn't have so many).  Best potato soup I've ever made. Would be excellent with a bread bowl - might try that next time!

I make this soup on a regular basis.  I've tried other recipes, but this is the best one by far.  The only little bit I change is I add in a couple tablespoons of the bacon grease into the soup and cut down on the sour cream (we don't really care for sour cream).  I also don't bake the potatoes as that leaves it too mash potatoey.  Instead I cube the potatoes and boil them. Over all soooo good.

Husband is not a real soup lover but he "LOVED" this one!!!
The only thing I did different was I don't add the bacon until I'm ready to serve it, otherwise the bacon tend to be soggy.  I also added some garlic salt.

I  made it with leftover backed potatoes and ham instead of bacon. The family says that it was a bit too milky.  My normal recipe uses chicken broth and milk.

Excellent!

Changed recipe up a bit... Used stock rather than milk, sauteed onions, carrots and 2 bay leafs in separate pan. Made rue then added stock and mixed everything together. Didn't have bacon so I used a couple dashes of liquid smoke. Not bad for a November 1st Day Saving Soup!!!

Added lil more stock to loosen it up... Pretty dang tasty!

I've made this recipe countless times.  But, instead of 2/3 c of butter, I use 1 c.  And I add twice as much sour cream just because it gives it more flavor and I add some Tony Chachere's for a lil kick - other than that, I change nothing else and EVERYONE begs for this recipe.  This is absolutely THE best baked potato soup I have ever had.

I haven't tried it YET, but I noticed not many spices are mentioned.
If some think it's a bit bland, try adding some soup stock or the (3) main ingredients to a soup stock : Celery, Onions & carrots.
I'm going to add a nice liquid smoke.

I'm a pretty decent cook, so I don't think I overlooked anything in the recipe, but I thought this was terribly bland.  I added several ingredients to it trying to flavor it up some, but to no avail.  I'm definitely going to try this again because I won't let it get the best of me, but next time I think I'll use less flour and half 'n half instead of milk.

Great recipe. Great taste. always a hit when I make it. It also tastes awesome if you add ground italian sausage or ground beef, and add a little italian season to taste.

I also found that you can boil the potatoes on the stove, then drain & add to the soup. Makes it quicker.

Also works great if you leave a little bit of bacon  & green onions on the side so its nice and crunchy when its time to eat!

I used this recipe and tweaked it based on 2 reviews... I used 2 cups chicken broth/4 cups milk instead of the 6 cups milk, and reserved about 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings for the roux. I sautéd the green onions in the bacon drippings first, blended 1/2 cup of flour to one cup of heavy cream, added it to the bacon/butter, added the chicken stock/Milk, and then added another cup of cream. I added the sourcream with the potatoes and bacon, then added applewood smoked kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I also used smoked cheddar cheese, and replaced the regular potatoes with Yukon gold potatoes...and used 6 of them instead of 4. This was a very creamy soup and the extra potatoes added extra bulk to help offset the addition of the heavy cream. You may want to add a bit more spices than called for to add another layer of richness.

I really loved this.  My very picky 17 year old son said it was amazing!  I cooked the bacon first and then drained it.  I added about 6 scallions with the butter.  I stuck with the 6 cups of milk.  I baked the potatoes in the microwave and left a little bit of skin on which my husband did not like at all but I did.  I chunked the potatoes instead of mashing them.  I didn't put as much cheese in but did garnish with it and the sour cream.  This is a keeper!

Love this! Kid and boyfriend approved! =) The only thing I did different is keep the skins on the potatoes as I always do with potato recipes, I also added about 1/4 of a cup of the bacon grease in place of some butter. Initially I was worried about it tasting -too- much like a baked potato, but it's perfect! Will be making this again, thanks!

This recipe is really good when you add in about 1 1/2 tsp of Italian herbs. We also reduced the milk by 1 cup so it was nice and thick. We waited to add the bacon to each bowl until just before eating so it didn't become soggy. With my modification I'll definitely make this again.

BTW, we didn't bother baking the potatoes in the oven, we just popped 'em in the microwave for 10 minutes. All told, the soup was completely ready in about 30 minutes.

I have been using this recipe for years.  Everyone is a fan from little kids to grandparents.  I use microwave bacon to make the process quicker when I'm in a time pinch.  Especially great for the crockpot on busy sports nights.

It's a great soup base!  But like other reviews, there are so many possibilities and you can modify to suit your individual tastes. I chose to add 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion to the bacon grease; added a pinch of salt and fresh ground black pepper and sautéed until tender.  In the same dutch oven, I added a little less butter and a drizzle of olive oil to make the roux. I exchanged one cup of the milk with chicken broth; added some chopped fresh thyme; and used about 1 slice of proscuitto chopped up that I had left over (along with the crumbled bacon) - which added even more flavor.  

If you notice the picture, it has chunks of potatoes, which I'm not sure how you get from a baked potato...but I prefer a combination of chunks and puréed, so it depends on your preference.  You can always boil some diced potatoes and purée 1/2 of them at the end if you don't want to use baked potatoes. 

Overall it's a delicious soup the way it's written, but I enjoy taking a recipe and making it my own.

This recipe was delicious!  I did cut the black pepper back to 1/8 t though.  For our family of three, I was considering on cutting the recipe in half and, now, wish I had.  The full recipe made much more than the stated 6 servings.  It was closer to 10 or so servings for us.  While the leftovers aren't bad and the soup is tasty, it gets old eating it after a week.

This soups was delicious.  Only change I made was to fry up the bacon, remove it and most of the greast.  I then sauteed the green onions in that instead of butter.  The only other change I will make the next time is omit the sour cream.  I did add the sour cream as the recipe called for it but I tasted it before I made the addition and, in the end, I liked the taste better without it.

AMAZING. Great taste for such little ingredients. I diced the potatos and but them on a baking sheet with butter and spices before putting in the oven to add more flavor and softness to the potato. Note that if you keep the soup in the fridge afterwards the consistency turns very thick into what resembles mashed potatoes. Still great though.

I followed the recipe except for the scallions... I hate the texture and crunch of onions so I used Onion Powder. I added a bit of garlic powder and just enough Tony Chaceres (sp?) for flavor. My husband absolutely loved it! Will make it again for sure!

Awesome recipe!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, though I did act some chicken stock to thin it out a little.  My husband has never been a potato soup fan, but he loved it, too!  I served it with jalapeno cornbread and it was a perfect mean for a cool fall day.

I tried this soup today and it is fantastic!  I followed it to a "T".  Baking the potato and then scooping the insides out for the soup really makes the texture.  It is a very thick and rich soup, and you don't need a whole lot to fill you up.  I used cottage bacon from the local meat market and it was so yummy.  Added "Top the Tater" sour cream and it was a great twist!  Will make this again for sure!

This was a really great recipe the only thing I would say is that the potatoes cook the same way boiling them and it takes less time. Also adding a pinch of garlic and maybe an earthy herb of your choice like sage or thyme makes the flavors a little more complex

This is a great winter soup. I followed the advice of others and microwaved the potatoes for 5 minutes each side then baked for about 20 minutes @ 350. I also sauteed the onions in the bacon fat/butter to soften them before adding the flour and milk. I use the immersion blender after adding afew potatoes then add the balance so it's both creamy and chunky. Add more salt and a splash of tabasco.

This is an easy recipe.  I changed the flour to corn starch for my FIL who is gluten intolerant, and also made it lower sodium by omitting the salt and used a low sodium bacon, cheese and sour cream.  Also, used unsalted butter.  This is delicious!  Those that like salt can add it in their own bowl.  My FIL asked me to make it again for him so he can freeze one serving sizes and pop them in the microwave when he's ready to eat it.  So yummy!

I used chicken stock and milk.  Also, I had to add a variety of spices to give it more flavor.  The soup is a meal by itself.  Thanks for sharing.

Great Soup!! It makes a lot too, we had enough for 3 days, but it was just my husband & I eating it. I followed the advise of putting potatoes in the microwave,10 mins, then baked for 20 minutes. I did this while cooking bacon(a full package) and making up my roux, and potatoes where ready when I needed them. When making the roux, I used a little of the grease left over from bacon,added green onion, used salted butter, and added just a pinch of Italian seasoning. Left the skins on potatoes, and doubled the cheese. NEver added any extra salt, but did add a lot more pepper (just kept tasting it). Soup was really thick until sour cream was added, plus it was a great flavor too. ***  Had to add about 2 cups of milk the next day to thin soup out for left overs, but it still tasted really good*** Will make again, thanks for the recipe!

Amazingly delicious for such simple ingredients. I added three cloves of garlic, chopped well, with the butter, and seasoned with extra black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, and onion powder.  I didn't have enough milk, so I substitute 2 cups of broth + 1 sodium free bouillon packet for 2 of the cups of milk.  The scallions and bacon add a great amount of complex flavor.  Will definitely make again!

AMAZING!! I was a little concerned that this might turn out like mashed potatoe soup but it was quite good. I took the advice of some other members and used a small amount of bacon greese when making the roux. I also put the green onions in while I was adding the milk and added one bay leaf for flavor.

The onions need to be cooked longer. It would probably be best to just cook them separately. Saute in oil for 10 minutes works great. Otherwise it was good; I added 2 chicken breasts.

Better than a restaurant!  Potatoes really weren't all that soft in the middle so used an immersion blender to make the consistency better before I added the onions, cheese and bacon.  This made it thicker and smoother so I added more milk and a bit more cheese.

The taste of this soup is wonderful but WOW is it thick and rich!  I used diced baked potato (skins included), omitted the bacon, and subbed mozzarella for cheddar.  Looking forward to the leftovers, but I'll be thinning them with chicken broth...

This recipe was awesome!  I had to make one minor tweak to it and that was using 2 cups of chicken stock and 4 cups of milk, mainly cause of not enough milk.  I have to say, I think the chicken stock rounded the base of the soup out.  I wasn't expecting the soup to take on the lard quality that it did, but it was good all the same. I merely added a splash of milk or stock and it came out fine.  I presented it with some sprinkles of cheese, dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of green onion.  Boyfriend rates it "F'in good, keep the recipe."

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! I had this recipe at my moms house and she sent me here! I did not change much except I added a small clove of Garlic, Minced to the base. I had to double it up to feed my clan and did the Chives, cheese, Bacon and sour cream on the side...Just like a baked potato in a bowl....

Cut the recipe in half and used about half the green onions, but otherwise followed it exactly. It was super thick and creamy. Had a nice flavor. Reminded me of a soup I've had out to eat. Even with half the onions they really take over, so I wouldn't add them if you don't like them. Good, but would probably try another recipe next time.

this soup was really good.  instead of adding the green onions later, i added them with the butter and let them cook longer.  they turned out soft and added a good taste.  i didn't use cooked bacon, but instead just tossed in some real bacon bits.  instead of regular salt i used seasoned salt.  overall, soup turned out great.  will be eating this all week.

This was the best potato soup ever! I followed most of the original recipe directions, except instead of the sour cream I whisked a cup of whipping cream with a half a cup of flour and added it to the soup. I also added a couple of tablespoons of dill weed and a tablespoon of chicken oxo. So good!

Super easy. You pretty much can't go wrong w/ this recipe- and it lends well to change. After the roux & potatoes, you can vary it w/ different cheeses and seasoning to taste... I make this all the time and it never tastes the same! I use fat free 1/2 n 1/2 and green onions and chives- and I don't add the onions, chives and bacon at all. I just keep them (along w/ extra cheese) in bowls for making a sort of baked potato soup bar.

Fantastic soup! The best thing is that you can add things to it to suit your tastes. I added celery, onion, and carrots. Everyone loved it. I served it with cheese and french fried onions on top. I had to send left overs home with everyone!

FABULOUS!  So delicious it's sinful.  I used a melon baller to scoop the flesh from the baked potatoes, it works very well.  Save the leftover potato skins and serve with melted cheese, bacon and green onions.  Love this recipe on a chilly day!!!

we made the recipe by the book, but i found it to be a lil thick. I added two cups of chicken stock to it, let it simmer for a while longer, added a lil extra salt n pepper and it was delicious!

Quite yummy ans perfect with fresh crusty bread on a blustery day!  I used light sour cream and added carrots and broccoli florets.  I also cut up my baked (microwave-baked) potatoes skin and all and put them in the soup.  I think I will cut back the flour a bit next time as re-heating on day 2 required the addition of more milk because my soup had become a solid!

I thought it was GREAT!  It did not pass the kid test at my house, however.  I was glad I used half chicken broth because with that it was the perfect thickness!

This was really yummy.  I served it for a get together, and everyone loved it.  I personally like potato soup to be a bit more chunky though.

This soup did not taste at all like I had hoped.  I was disappointed because it did not have the taste of a certain chain restaurant's soup. The base of my soup had a funny background taste that I couldn't identify.

It had a thick taste and feel to it. Next time I'll eat a baked potato slathered in everything put in this soup, and it would probably be more enjoyable than this soup.

I find it very bland and have to add salt for taste.  However, my husband really likes it.

VERY GOOD!  This is the best baked potato soup recipe I've tried yet.  It doesn't taste too floury and the flavors blend very well!!!!

Everyone loved it.

This potato soup is the best.  Very creamy and filling.  I sent some over to my parents and my father does not like potato soup, however, my mother said he went for seconds and then scraped the bowl.

It's good but don't use turkey bacon because it gets soggy, or if you do use it don't put it in until the end.
