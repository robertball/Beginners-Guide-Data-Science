Extrodinarily delicious! I used only 1/3 of the ingredients since I only used 1lb of chicken (I only have to feed myself and my husband). I did however use the entire can of diced tomatoes and the whole clove of garlic. Slap this mixture on a bed of rice and enjoy! Fast easy and absolutely scrumptious! An instant favorite!

I made a couple of changes: I used plain diced tomatoes undrained and instead of onion I used 1/4 tsp. onion powder. It turned out really good except I think I'll use 2 cans of tomatoes so it will be saucier. We had it over rice and really enjoyed it. Thanks!

I used boneless chicken thighs (half the weight as I was cooking for two) cut into pieces & fresh mushrooms. I used a full can of chopped tomatoes to make up for the mushroom liquor and more olives as two tablespoons didn t seem enough. It didn't need as much cooking and had a little too much sauce but still tasted fantastic. I will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband and I really liked it. It was different than the usual chicken dishes I make. My 5 yr old son thought it was too salty.

Very good. Used regular green olives chopped up since I did not have black olives at hand. Still came out delicious. Will take off skin the next time.

Delicious but it came out quite salty and I had to add more water to it to keep it from burning in the pan.

This was Delish! My husband and I both loved this and my 1yr old son ate it too! I made a couple of changes. I used boneless/skinless ckn breasts and cut them into bite size pieces. I used green olives b/c I didnt have black ones. I think it added great flavor. Also I omitted the mushroom b/c I dont eat them. I served this with spanish rice (the kind that you add a can of tomatoes to) and it complimented the dish wonderfully. will definitely make again.

This is a delicious dish I have made for my family and large crowds and its always a hit. I use only chicken breasts cut into smaller pieces and after browning them well I only cook for 20 minutes the flour dredge is also optional.
