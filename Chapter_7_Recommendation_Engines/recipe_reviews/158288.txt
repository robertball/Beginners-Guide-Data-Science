This was really good.  Even better the next day. I made the salad as suggested in the recipe, but I used chopped walnuts instead of pine nuts.

There is way too much onion in this recipe!  The first batch I made straight from the recipe and threw it away because it tasted like a raw onion.  I could hardly taste anything else!  I tried again right after and used a quarter of a small onion and more cherries and it was still way too much.  This time I attempted to eat it on a salad and threw half my salad away.  I'll be looking for another recipe.
