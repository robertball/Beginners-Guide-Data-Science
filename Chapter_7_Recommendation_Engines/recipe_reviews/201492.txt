This was great!! My dinner guest oo'd and aah'd they loved it, my family did too. I served it over broiled chicken some just ate it as a mango salad. I prepped early in the day so plenty of time to marinade. I think next time I'll add extra lime and cilantro, to taste;)

I too add onion and petite diced tomatoes - a little crazy salt doesn't hurt either.  This recipe is out of this WORLD and uniquely different. Great with Tostitos Scoops!

Very addicting. I can't stop eating it! I doubled the cilantro, which is only a good idea if you really love cilantro. Added 1 more lime and did not use salt or pepper and the chips I used (Tostitos scoops) already have plenty of salt. 

I also added avocado! Delicious!!
