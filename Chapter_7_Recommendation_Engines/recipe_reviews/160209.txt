I only made one substitution--instead of half-n-half, I used one can evaporated milk. I also added a touch of Frank's Hot Sauce. I was surprized by this soup, it wasn't bad. I think this would make a good clam chowder using canned clams as well. I'd make this again but I'd play with the recipe a bit.

The roomates and I loved this.  I made a couple changes, including: adding 1 can of reg. corn, doubling the green onion and cooking reg. shrimp in garlic butter instead of canned shrimp.  Great recipe. will use again and maybe add celery?

This chowder was FABULOUS!  We have told everyone about it since I made it.  Instead of the half-and-half, I used 3/4 cup whipping cream and 3/4 skim milk.  I also added about 3 additional tablespoons of skim milk during cooking to thing the chowder just a bit.  Sprinkled with a few bacon bits and some sharp cheddar at serving.

I used a can of clams instead of shrimp and was thoroughly overjoyed with this super-easy recipe's flavors. Though next time, to suit my own tastes, I will used more bacon, more cayenne pepper, and replace 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the half-and-half with milk.

I recommend using the creamed corn the recipe calls for instead of regular.  The slightly sweet taste of the creamed version pulls the whole recipe together.  It's even better the next day and heats up nicely.  I added an extra can of shrimp and a splash of milk.  This was the best chowder I've over had!  ETA>>>For a quick put together, I use a full 2.8 ounce package of real bacon pieces.

Excellent camping recipe! We added a baking potato since we had an extra one and this was so "rib-stickin' good" and we'll be adding this to our camp rotation and for home too! I'll defintely add another can of med shrimp or fresh (depending on where we camp next).. we may even add fresh clams which we had access to in Dosewallips WA (great manila, littlenecks, horse clams and mussels)

Every once in a while you come across a simple recipe that surprises the heck out of you because it tastes phenomenal.  This is one of those recipes.  Granted its not exactly healthy but so what?  Once in a while its OK to treat oneself.  Those who said it tastes gourmet quality...I definitely agree.  Just made it for lunch for my husband and 88 year old father.  They both said to definitely save this one.  My only changes were that I only had about 3/4 cup half and half so I made up the rest with skim milk.  I also used (two cans) canned medium shrimp which is my preferred size.  Otherwise exactly the same.  Don't be afraid to try this one just because it comes out of cans.  No one and I mean no one will ever know.

This is a wonderful chowder!!! And so easy to make! Next time I will omit the cayenne pepper because it was a bit too hot for our liking. Amazing new recipe for me! Thank you 4moores!

I loved this chowder! I added extra corn and bok Choy along with stone water to thin it out a tad. Also I replaced the shrimp with Salmon. My boyfriend loved it!

I prefer to make recipes from scratch. Typically, the recipe tastes better and I feel better for having prepared it with all fresh ingredients. That noted, this recipe includes several ingredients from cans and despite that, tastes as if it were completely homemade. Restaurants would have no shame in serving this to their customers, just be sure to hide the soup and corn cans. Next time, I will add more cayenne pepper. I nearly doubled the volume recommended, and could not discern any sense of heat at all, without adding more. I wasn't looking for a lot of heat, just a hint and it just wasn't there with the amount as written in the recipe. My whole family enjoyed this recipe and gave me several compliments.

Loved it!  Made just a few tweaks--added a can of cream of shrimp soup instead of the baby shrimp and two cans of minced clams; also sauteed regular onion and garlic at the start of the recipe.  Delicious and super easy!

This was so easy & delicious! I confess that I tweaked the recipe a bit. I couldn’t deal with canned shrimp, so I steamed some instead & I added a bit more corn kernels. My husband loved it!!! Ciabatta bread goes great with it!!

I was skeptical but hopeful. This is so great! Quick and delish! I'd serve it to company. A splash of sherry is great in it when served. Thank you for a great recipe!

Edit: Made it a second time. Cut the cream cheese to 4oz, used frozen shrimp scampi as it was on sale. Added extra corn (frozen). Love this soup.

The cayenne pepper took away the from the delicious flavor of this recipe. It is also too thick. I dropped the cayenne pepper and added 2 drops of Franks Hot Sauce, added 2 TB Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry and added whole milk to thin the soup out. Lastly, I used real cooked shrimp which I cut up instead of canned shrimp.

I just made this chowder and it is fantastic! I did make 2 changes, but it was just due to personal preference. I added a second can of cream of potato soup and I used fresh shrimp that I quickly sautéed instead of the canned. I will definitely make this one often.
