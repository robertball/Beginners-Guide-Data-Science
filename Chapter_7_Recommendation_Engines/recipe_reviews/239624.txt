I was interested in this recipe for the fact that it was pretty low in carbs, especially if the cornstarch is omitted, which is what I did.  The combination of herbs really make this taste like a cool weather dish, which I like, but I felt it was a bit heavy on the marjoram.  Probably 1/4 tsp would be enough for me.  I added fresh rosemary in the last 20 minutes of cooking (this was my only other change), then salt and pepper to taste.  I could also get by with a smaller pinch of cayenne, lol!  Cooking times are pretty accurate.  This should freeze well, too.  Mashed potatoes or cauliflower and a crusty bread complete the meal.  Thanks for the idea!

Nice comforting soup. I used a skinned Roma tomato instead of paste, and chicken broth instead of water. I went light on the chicken and cut it into smaller pieces, so I waited to add them as they only needed to simmer for 10 minutes. Overall a very good soup for chilly, rainy days!

My family loved it... I did change the marjoram for basil since I didnt have any marjoram and I used chicken broth instead of water...I will make it again but I will add either rice or an elbow pasta.
