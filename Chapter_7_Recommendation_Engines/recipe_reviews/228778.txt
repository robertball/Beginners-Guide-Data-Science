I loved this.  I rarely make spinach dip because it has so much mayo, but this is a better alternative, and very, very tasty.  I halved it, used mozarella and another cheese I had in the fridge, and served it as a side dish with sausages and macaroni.  Unlike the other reader, I actually added a bit more onion and garlic.  I think I'll experiment and add other ingredients, such as carrots or nuts, in the future.

This recipe was great!! I halved the ingredients and left out the onion due to personal preference. but it was quick and fantastic. I also used a bit of parm cheese as well.

Really, a very good dip. This is one of those recipes I would say you could mess with the proportions to your hearts content and it would still taste really good. And if you wanted to toss in a can of artichoke hearts, it instantly becomes delicious spinach artichoke dip. Only change I made was that I used the entire block of cream cheese rather than just 6 table spoons. It seems silly just to leave 2 tablespoons and other reviewers said it was much too spinachy. For what it's worth, I disagree with them. There is a lot of spinach, but I think spinach dip should have a lot of spinach. I think some people want a cheese dip with a little bit of spinach in it. 

I would also say the time as a suggestion and I might lower the temperature of the oven because putting it in for 20 minutes made that top layer of cheese more of a crest then a layer of melting cheese. I'd taken it out a couple of minutes sooner it might have been melty with just little brown spots like on the picture for this recipe. Instead I got more like a crust. It was delicious, but I would've preferred it more gooey so keep your eye on it when it's in the oven. And always remember, there is no such thing as too much cheese. You want to throw in a couple more handfuls, who's to stop you?

Good. Added more onion and garlic than says. But would have used less spinach. Would like to try again with maybe a can of Cheddar Cheese soup to add more creamy cheese. Just too much spinach for me.

This was absolutely delicious.   It was a huge hit over the 4th and was gone in record time! Definitely worth doing again.  I used fresh Spinach instead of frozen.  If you do this, add some water to it otherwise it will burn.

It was good but the spinach flavor was a little strong. May try again but want some more cheese. It came together very quickly and I surprised my husband with the dip, tortilla chips and beer when he came home Friday after work. Fun!

I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it! Using cream cheese instead of mayonnaise  adds a richer and creamier flavor!

I just made the spinach cheese dip for the first time for our daughter to take to her office.  I am going to put it in the refrigerator when it cools off.  She is taking it to work tomorrow.  However, she says she doesn't want to go to another floor to use their microwave oven to heat it up.  Can it be eaten cold?  I bought crackers to go with it.  I will try heating it up early tomorrow morning on a lower oven temperature like 250 degrees for 10 minutes or so.

It needs a lot seasoning to help it along and it just wasn't super creamy inside. I would more than likely use this recipe to make spinach cakes or just as a straight up side dish over a dip. Also you have to really press out the extra liquid on the spinach and pay extra close attention to the milk and cream cheese otherwise you will make cottage cheese in a pot from adding cold cheese to warmish milk. Best to add these two at the same time or do the cream cheese first. As for the seasoning which I mentioned before, the spinach flavor is very heavy and you will probably want to add more salt and pepper as you go along.

Pretty good and easy.  I added a little cayenne pepper for some kick, and didn't put extra cheese on top - with those updates it was great for me.

I really like this recipe and will be making it again for gatherings.   I had a lot of swiss chard from the garden this year so I used 10 oz of swiss chard instead of spinach and I threw in a handful of real bacon bits, it came out really good!  Everyone loved it including 3 teenagers!  I served mine in a bread bowl and we used bread for dipping.  It is pretty spinachy but like someone else said I think this is a recipe you can mess around with and it will still be good.  So if you like more of a cheese dip with some leafy greens use less spinach, if you like more of a green dip with cheese then use the full 10oz.

I made this delicious dip but i had to add a couple spoons of sour cream. Made it much creamier and it gave it that bit of tang it needed. I also added some Monterey cheese.  So yummy.

I liked it a lot! I followed some suggestions and added all of the cream cheese (8oz) and increased the mozzarella. I skipped the cheddar because I did not have any and only used a small shallot for the onion. It tastes great but I got a few comments that it just tastes like cheese, which I'm just fine with personally!  Next time I might add more spinach or onion to flavour it up a bit more. I heated up some pita bread and nachos and it was very nice :)

I've been looking for an extra creamy spinach dip recipe without the artichokes. Finally I've found a great one. I like the fact that there is no mayo or sour cream in this recipe. The first time I made this it was really very good. The second time I spiced it up a bit. I made it as is but added pepper jack cheese and a little cayenne pepper. I also added more cheese than it called for. You can never have enough cheese!! My family raves over this recipe. One of the easiest and best recipes in my recipe box. I made in in about 40 minutes which is good for me as I am handicapped. Thanks missbrianna!

Was okay, but just not creamy enough for me.  The spinach and artichoke dip with mayo is better, but this one is vegetarian so that's a bonus.

I had a bit of trouble getting it thick, so I reduced the milk and cream cheese before continuing. Loved it. Also tastes good with chopped bacon and minced jalapeños for some extra heat. Making it every holiday party now!

I made this last night for work party. Very good exactly as written. The recipe made a good sized bowl. As a side, paired with little toasted french bread slices, the recipe easily fed a dozen people. My only suggestion is a personal preference, I would add a little more salt. Or perhaps garlic salted the bread slices. Either would be great. :)

Added a small amount of both cheeses so it is extra cheesy.

Absolutely Delicious.  I had to adapt slightly to what I had,   (Fresh Spinach) and Manchego Cheese,  But It was just soo good.  I do not need to try any other Spinach Cheese Dips.   Next time I will get the cheddar and Mozzarella!!!   But I will stick with the fresh spinach!

Made it twice. Didnt enjoy the texture. Found it more mushy then stringy. Added less cream cheese the second time and still a weird texture. Couldn't eat any batch.

I made this and it is very tasty.  I substituted organic fresh spinach.  The mozzarella on top got a little too dark.

I added another block of cream cheese and another 1/2 cup of milk to make it a little more creamy. I also topped it with feta crumbles.  Everyone loved it.

Great dip if you like cream cheese, because that's mostly what it taste like.... hot cream cheese. The cream cheese overpowers the flavor of the dip, obscuring the spinach, onion and garlic. 
Still a decent recipe if you dislike mayo and or sour cream.

A good base to add your favorite flavors to. It was thick and cheesy, but bland. I added garlic salt, Texas Pete, crushed red pepper, and quite a bit more milk than the recipe calls for. I cooked it on the stove as directed and served it in my small Crockpot. My kids love it.

Very easy to make. I halved most the ingredients. Based on the reviews,  I used less spinach and a tad more cream cheese. Added a dash of salt for taste. Very pleased

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday party and it went over really well..I am, however, very bad at following recipes exactly and needed more than this was supposed to make so I didn't follow the recipe to a T. It was an amazing guideline. I think I accidentally added a little less spinach and more cheddar. I also forgot salt and pepper, but it still had great flavour without!

I used all cheddar cheese and mozzarella for the topping and fresh spinach as opposed to frozen spinach. Next time I'll add artichokes!

I made this spinach dip. I like my spinach dip, so I think I'll adjust by lowering the amount of spinach and using more cheese instead. But all in all, this method was still really good.

We LOVE this recipe. I always add way more cheese & tonight I've added lobster. 
We always order spinach did as a starter when we eat out and is say this is on par and even better than some dips we've ordered.

If you're craving comfort food or something rich and delicious this is the perfect healthy alternative. Wheat and gluten free and if you want you can use all organic ingredients like I did. Loved it! :))
