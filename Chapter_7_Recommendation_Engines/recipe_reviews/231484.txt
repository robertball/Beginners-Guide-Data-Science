This was tasty, and couldn't have been easier! The only change I made was to scale the recipe down. I liked using the ranch in place of the usual mayo. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Hubby is a huge fan of cucumbers and he enjoyed this.  I had just made some homemade ranch dressing, which worked out perfectly for a fast and easy lunch.

I was very impressed with how easy this was and how great it tasted. I coupled it with some Medium Cheddar Cheese and Garlic and Chive Bagel Top Chips and it was a divine lunch!

This was good. Needs a little more ranch. Used the salad on triscuits for a starter for Easter. Remember to let the cukes sit in fridge to drain excess water .

I followed the directions as listed and while I enjoyed it cannot say that it was the best. Was easy, simple and fresh.

Did not put cucumbers in it and used mayonnaise instead of salad dressing.  Yummy.  Will definitely make again!

Simple and plain. Easy to make but just not that tasty. I would have given it two and a half stars for a middle of the road rating but couldn't. Next time I'm going to substitute mayonnaise for the ranch dressing, and dill pickles for the cucumber.

07.17.17 ~ I had five hard-boiled eggs in the fridge, a little lettuce left and picked our first cucumbers of the season from the garden.  This was a yummy recipe to make.  I've never put cukes in egg salad before, but we liked it.  Also have never made it with Ranch dressing.  That was a nice change.  Served it on a bed of lettuce with tomato slices and a slice of sourdough bread.  It made for a nice, light summer meal.

I didn't have enough ranch for 3 tablespoons so I used spicy ranch for 2 tablespoons. Other than that felt the recipe and turned out great.
