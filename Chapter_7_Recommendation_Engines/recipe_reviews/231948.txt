The recipe is described this as a side dish but, honestly, I would never serve this as a side dish.  I consider this a dessert, but we all have different taste preferences.  I made one change, used Truvia in place of the sugar.  This certainly is easy to make, and itâ€™s OK, but I doubt I'll make it again.

Doubled the recipe except for the pineapple and sugar . I added a half cup of coconut and 2 tabs  of rum for flavoring since I ran out of vanilla, I  served it with strawberries and whipped cream. Our guests loved it. It is so easy that I will make it again. I served in antique bowls and would have loved to add a photo here but don't know how!

I made a few changes. I used half and half instead of milk, real pineapple that I diced, and added coconut. It is not very sweet so I think next time I'm going to use sweetened coconut and replace the sugar with a little more brown sugar. Then it will be perfect!
