A classic, always very nice. The only tip I can add is to temper the eggs by adding a small amount of milk to the yolk mixture first (enough to make the yolk mixture fairly hot) before pouring into the hot pot. This will help prevent the eggs from cooking in lumps in the mixture.

Small point - step 3 mentions egg whites. Give this recipe to a novice & they would be wondering what to do as there are none in the recipe.
That aside, great recipe & method. I made some saffron & honey ice cream from it.

this is a ood recipe however try replacing some of the milk with cream for example if your using 1L of milk try using 600ml milk and 400ml double cream this gives you a much richer creamier end product oh and in response to another review if hyou need to use flour to thicken the sauce then you have not cooked the egg out enough, keep stiring over a low heat untill the sauce coats the back of a spoon, if you make a line on the spoon with your finger, it will stay there when ready

sure, this is the ONE...! But do not forget that you can use some flour to thicken the cream. I prefer a sauce with a yogourt aspect...
