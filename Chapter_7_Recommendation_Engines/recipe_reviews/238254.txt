I loved this straight forward apple pie recipe! I made my pie the day before and let it sit at room temperature for about 20 hours (not by choice, our plans changed!) It was set up perfectly and the crust wasn't soggy at all. It paired really well with the cinnamon ice cream (also from Allrecipes). I will definitely make it again this holiday season!

Unfortunately my pie came out more like soup. Followed the recipe, used Granny Smith and Fuji as that's all market had. Wasn't as sweet as I wanted either and I used 3/4 sugar. Not sure what I did wrong. Will stick to my tried and true apple pie recipe.

I did not make any changes. It was really easy to make
