I'm not so sure how good this recipe would be if you followed the instructions to a tee, however I used the directions as a diving board and added my own two-cents. I used half of the penne suggested, but the full amount of olive oil. I also kept the amounts of garlic, parsely and black pepper the same. I quadrupled the amount of sun dried tomato, and added two freshly sliced mushrooms. After I sauteed the mix and added the pasta, I then added about 2 Tbsp fresh basil. The end result was phenomenal. Thank you for the stepping stone!

This could be a 5 star dish with anyones own ideals, First I would not and did not use the whole pkg of pasta, I used more garlic than called for, I also used fresh greenbeans instead of sun dried tomatoes, and I added some shrimp I also went a little heavy on the pepper. My dish came out great and full of flavor. 5 stars !!!! I only rated it 4 stars for the orign recipe great start though thanks.

Not bad! The whole box of penne pasta ended up being a bit too much. Also, had to use several sun dried tomatos - two just kind of get lost in that much pasta! I also ended up putting in a bit of garlic powder - the three cloves were barely noticible. Also will be using a bit more olive oil next time. Pretty good overall though! Thank you! :)

Great side dish. I served mine with grilled herb chicken and steamed broccoli. I used whole wheat pasta and fresh italian parsley. I also sauteed the pasta in the pan with the oil and herbs for a few minutes to "crisp" it a little.Excellent!!!!!

I agree, this is a great baseline for a fresh summer pasta!  I used 1/3 box of the wheat penne instead of the entire thing.
I also did not want to change up the vegies as I wanted a clean fresh simple pasta, but I did double it. I used Roma tomatoes instead of Sundried.
I also sauted the garlic in olive oil with parsley.. threw in the vegies, then added minced onion, and itialian seasoning. 
I put that mixture aside when I felt it was ready, and took my cooked pasta and sauted it on the skillet with some olive oil and garlic powder to get it a little crisp and absorb some flavor so it was not so bland as it is wheat pasta.
Mixed it all together, added crushed red pepper and fresh parmesan shavings and it was delish! :)

Was lacking as is;  I felt it needed more oomph.  I will make again, but I will add butter, basil and more garlic and Parmesan.

A very familiar, "everyday" dish for me - couldn't live without it!  But  I've never tried it with  sun-dried tomatoes. Not sure I'm a fan of that addition.

This was good but a little bland and dry. I used fresh grape tomatoes which I think is better than the sun dried. If I were to make this again I would definately tweak it, use salt of more seasonings and use a little more oil.

I really like this one, the garlic gets nice and hot if you have leftovers the next day.  Its now one of my most favorite.  

One thing I like to do is make the pasta get darkened in the pan.

Yummy yum yum

I followed the recipe exactly how it states and it turned out well.  The red pepper flakes definitely gave it a kick and was a hit to my dinner guests.

Didn't want to cook tonight, but I also didn't want to eat junk food. Took a look on here for something/anything and came up with pasta gold! #1 This came together in no time flat, #2 it was delicious. I added shrimp because I had them and took the advice of some reviewers and added Roma tomatoes to the mixture and halved the pasta. Just a touch of pasta water made the sauce spectacular! Glad I found this recipe!

This recipe was tasty, but the best thing about it is it is fast, fast, fast and easy!  It used ingredients that we already had around the house.  It was ready in minutes.  We wanted a protein boost so we cut up some Morningstar Farms Chik patties and mixed them in with the pasta.  The only other change we'd make is that we'd like to use a little less red pepper next time, to tone down the spice.

This is good and has potential to be a 5. I use more sun dried tomatoes and I use sliced and quartered fresh Roma tomatoes as well. Like others, I think that it definitely is either too much pasta or too little tomato as written. I omit the red pepper flakes. We like to use the Kraft 3 cheese (asiago, parmesan and romano) to sprinkle on top. Add cubed, cooked chicken and you have meal!

I agree with many other reviewers, this is a great recipe to use as a springboard.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, however, I did increase the olive oil to 2/3 cup, I used more pepper, minced garlic, and parsley than the recipe called for and upped the parmesean cheese to 1 cup.  I did not have sun dried tomatoes, so I halfed about a cup of cherry tomatoes that I had in the fridge and hand shredded some fresh spinach (about a cup) into the mixture.  I also added anbout 3/4 cup of chicken broth, a can of mushrooms, a can of sliced black olives, and a can of chopped artichoke hearts.  I added a bit of italian seasoning and some dried minced onion as well.  I did not choose to serve this over penne.  (I was working with what I had on hand!), but over gnocci.  It was excellent!  Plus, I felt good about it because I got in a lot of veggies!  This recipe is great because it can easily be modified around what you have available.  Next time I'd love to add shrimp or scallops!   MMMMM!  TASTY!

Thought it tasted good; my husband thought it was a little dry though. 

It was super easy to throw together, and we liked the flavor.

Simple, straight forward, and easy to prepare! I cut the recipe in half and opted to use a couple hand fulls of grape tomatoes that I sliced in half. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same, except of the red pepper flakes which I added to taste. I added a little chopped fresh basil and some shredded Italian cheese blend. Overall, a nice side dish!

great recipe, like some others, i reduced the olive oil, and added 1/2 cup dry white wine and reduced prior to adding into the pasta.  I also used whole grain pasta.  Topped with shredded mozzarella.  Delicious, thank you.

Penne turned out delicious.  I received so many praises.  I changed it a bit by using fresh parsley sautéed with the garlic and when completed, added fresh basil.  
I also used less pasta-12 oz as suggested in other reviews.  I will make it again!

I used rotini pasta, which I think holds flavor better, and the recipe turned out perfectly. The crushed red pepper may need to be increased (as in my case) or decreased according to personal preference.

It was really easy to make but kind of bland. I gave it a 4* because I needed a healthy recipe and it served its purpose in keeping my sugars down (I'm diabetic).

I've made this several times and really like it.  I always greatly increase both the garlic and the tomatoes - by about 4X.  Also, the timing for the pasta cook time is a little light - 8 minutes, for instance, leaves the pasta close to crunchy. I would plan on 10-12 min.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! Instead of penne, I used spaghetti- the only pasta I had on hand. A used way more garlic, fresh parsley, basil, and a added a dash of oregano. What a fantastic dish!

This was quite tasty. I made it exactly as written, and included the sun-dried tomatoes. It was nice to see that pasta can be made very flavorful with just a bit of vegetables and spices, and no "sauce" per se.

I too halved the amount of pasta, used 4x's the amount of tomatoes, threw in several handfuls of defrosted frozen veggies and deleted the red pepper. I found this very oily although i used slightly under the 1/4 cup. Hubby threw it out, son thought it was ok but "greasy". I'll make again but use butter in place of oil as many Italians do- its much better.

Like so many others, I made a few revisions.  I added mushrooms and used Italian seasoning.  I wouldn't consider the tomatoes optional.

This just didn't do much for me.  The only change I made was that I used spaghetti instead of penne.  It was just pretty bland.  I think it would be fine in a small portion as a side dish, but I got sick of it fast as my main dish.

I really love this recipe.  It is so easy.  I did adjust a bit. I added a lot more julianned dried tomato, also mushrooms and small broccoli flourettes. This is just an awesome recipe for a single gal like me.  I only used half a box of mini penne and will have enough for another dinner and a lunch.  Yummy!! Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is very simple and with a few modifications a 5 star recipe.  I halved the pasta and doubled everything else and this turned out perfectly.  Parmesan tends to dry out the dish, so I would recommend leaving it on the table for everyone to add as they wish.    Thank you for sharing, we loved this and I loved the addition of sun-dried tomatoes!!

This recipe was just okay for our taste buds.  It lacked flavor.  We do plan to try it again with some changes - different spices and different vegetables.  Overall, this recipe was nothing spectacular.

I love this recipe, with a few changes. I used a 10oz jar of Flora sun-dried tomatoes with oil, Perdue Short Cuts chicken ( original flavor ) and no pepper flakes. Simmer all the ingredients while the pasta is cooking. This is a keeper!

I love this dish. I do make a couple of changes though. Instead of sun-dried tomatoes, I use cherry tomatoes cut in half. I also add some more crushed red pepper for extra spice. Also, using a little less than a pound of pasta will help keep it from being dry.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  I upped the the amount of sun-dried tomatoes and spices since I personally prefer a bit more flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was pretty good. I used fresh parsley instead of dried because I'm one of those parsley snobs. Next time I'll try it with the tomatoes. The Boy didn't really like it because of the pepper flakes (I like spicy ~ he hates it).

Made this with a 'twisty' pasta and it was quite good.  The red pepper flakes add a nice touch of 'bite' to keep things interesting.  Good if you don't want a 'saucy' pasta.

Just made it and I have to say it’s a winner. I did double the garlic and halve the pasta. The next time I will take the other reviewer suggestion and add sun dried tomatoes and basil.

I love this recipe!  I so easy to follow and quick to make.  I used 1/2 tsp of the pepper flakes because of my kids. I don't normally have sundried tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes and it worked fine. I also added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream to make it with some fettuccine pasta. So good!

Like other reviewers,  I thought it was too bland as-is.  That is largely a personal preference though. My rating is for the recipe as-is, though I did end up adding a few things that made it extra good to my wife and me - some salt, butter, and basil at the end. She said it would go great with some fried salmon filets, and we'll be having that for lunch!

This was okay, I spiced mine up a bit more by adding more garlic, i also boiled my pasta in chicken broth, I added more olive oil, and basil, and grape tomatoes to it and it was better. Next time  I may add some bacon pieces. :-)

This recipe turned out pretty good with a few alterations.  I reduced the amount of pasta but increased the amount of sundried tomatoes and kept the same amount of olive oil.  i also added onions and sauteed them before I added the tomatoes/garlic/parsley, but next time I think I'll cook the tomatoes with the onions so the oil absorbs more of the sundried tomato flavor.

Really good as a side dish, we didn't use the tomatoes or red pepper and added lots more garlic (we love garlic!) One thing I did add for more flavor was about a tsp of sage. Next time we are going to try it as a meal with some sauteed chicken or sausage. Great!

very bland as written, and not enough sauce for the amount of pasta called for.

I am so grateful I stumbled across this recipe. My first attempt at dinner failed, and I didn't have a backup plan (nor a lot of food left in the house). This lil' baby came to the rescue. My only changes were instead of sun-dried tomatoes, I used grape tomatoes, which I cut into quarters, and Campanelle (pasta that is shaped like a little bell). I eyeballed the seasonings, as well as the pasta, since I was just making 1 serving. Everything worked out nicely. Thank you for posting,  Taliesen.

Two words:  ADD BACON!  This was a great dish with that addition but I agree with other readers that the sauce wasn't enough for the amount of pasta it called for.  When I make this again, I think I'll use the following ratio.
1 box BOWTIE pasta
6T olive oil
8 sundried tomatoes, softened and chopped
8 slices of of bacon drained & crumbled 
5 cloves of garlic, chopped
1T parsley flakes
1/2t black pepper
1t red pepper flakes

Awesome pasta recipe! Just looking for somthing to cook with on hand ingredients...this almost fit the bill, so I improvised: sauteed garlic (3 clvs) w/parsley in the evoo, added 1 cn stewed tomatoes, cut (w/the juice), brought to a boil--added spices, simmered a bit then stirred the pasta in a few spoonfuls at a time until it reached a good consistency...was low on the parm, threw in some Mozza. DEE-lish! LOVED the red pepper kick!

This was pretty bland.  I'll be eating this for lunch and I had it for dinner.  I added lots of tomatoes and garlic, but it still didn't do for me.  I'll try something else.  I'm glad that other people liked it.

I think the black pepper and red pepper gave it too much of a bite.  I added tomato sauce to the recipe so that it wouldn't be too bland with just garlic and pepper.  It is a good starting point.  Play with it some and you will get better results.  Next time I am going to add chicken and cut out the red pepper.

I added black olives and feta cheese, topped it with green onions for a bright presentation and it was a huge hit!  The church group was astounded at the feast!

The first time I made this it had no flavor- I had to add marinara sauce to make it edible.  The second time, however was much much better and I realized that I forgot to soak the dried tomatoes like you are supposed to with the kind I bought.  When I added them done the right way- there was a lot more flavor.  Next time I won't put as much red pepper flakes as it was a little too spicy for me ( I am a wimp)

My husband thought this was good but I thought that it lacked a lot of flavor. I did use the sun dried tomatoes but wasn't really impressed.

Awesome recipe!! I have made this over and over! My family loves it! I substitute butter for some olive oil and I also add 1/2 cup of cream of mushroom condensed soup. I love it with mushrooms and chicken as well! This recipe is great with sweet Italian bread!

ooooooooo!  so good!  I added about a cup of fresh spinach and let it reduce in the olive oil mixture before adding the pasta...just perfect!
Thanks for a great, sophisticated, quick recipe!
