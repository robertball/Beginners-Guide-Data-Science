This a VERY good and extremely easy recipe. It's pretty difficult to mess it up if you follow the recipe. I run the onion, white wine vinegar, lemon juice, egg yolks, and all the spices through my food processor before adding them to the hot butter. Add the cream at the same time. One and a half minutes in the microwave on high is perfect. VERY IMPORTANT - WHIP IT EVERY 30 SECONDS! This will keep it smooth and very creamy. Otherwise the eggs will set and it will be lumpy. If you want it thinner, whip in a small amount of COLD water. I have never had anything but raves for this recipe. Enjoy!

Worked well, I tripled the recipe.  My one criticism is that I think there is a bit too much vinegar in the recipe and next time I will cut that part down a bit.

This is the third time I've tried to make Bearnaise sauce from scratch, the second time in the microwave. Although this turned out the best, it still wasn't very good. It looked terrible. It was lumpy from the egg cooking. Taste was ok. However, I don't think I'll make it again, the little packets at the grocery stores you mix with butter and milk are so much better.

Excellent!  This was so good and just like a restaurant.  I did take others suggestions and cooked the sauce at 30 sec a time then took out of the microwave to stir before cooking again for 30 sec.  the texture was perfect, no lumps and I minced the onion so fine in my cuisinart that you hardly noticed them.  I served this sauce over asparagus and with Blue Cheese Crsted Filet Mignon with Port Wine Sauce.  My DH raved about it and he is picky!  
Don't be afraid to try it you won't be sorry!

This recipe turned out really well. I used a chardonnay wine instead of the vinegar, which added great flavor. To ensure the egg doesn't cook, make this recipe on the stove top. That allows you to constantly stir it, and it's still a very fast recipe (probably about 5 minutes).

This recipe is easier than it looks.  I have been making it for a couple years.  I have substituted milk for cream in a pinch...you can't really mess it up.  I would recommend taking it out of the microwave every 20-30 seconds and whisking it to keep it smooth.  Also, stop cooking when it is a little thinner than you want becuase it will continue to thicken afterwards.  I always make a double recipe and use the extra on our eggs the next day YUM!

Great technique. No more constant whisking over a double boiler. Dried tarragon works great as well.  Not sure it needed the mustard though. The flavor of this bearnaise is spot on without the time consuming  tarragon reduction called for in a traditional recipe. Can't believe this takes 90 seconds. Be careful if you have a high wattage microwave though, I stopped to stir mine every 15 seconds and 30 seconds would have surely scrambled the eggs. Also make sure you stop when the sauce has just thickened, or else the eggs scramble and the sauce breaks. Mine was perfect after one minute and fifteen seconds.

This bearnaise sauce was delicious!  Chicken Oscar is one of my favorite dishes, but this was my first time making the bearnaise from scratch...and I will never go back to the packaged bearnaise sauce mix.  I DID make some changes to the recipe...I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used brown rice vinegar.  I also omitted the cayenne and substituted dried parsley for fresh.  I used half and half instead of cream and I also used the stovetop method because I prefer not to use a microwave.  When I tasted it, it was a bit lemony (maybe from not having the heavy cream), so I added about 1 1/2 T of half and half and one more pinch of tarragon.  

This sauce was delectable atop my Chicken Oscar!

I love Bearnaise sauce, but rarely ever made it because of the hassle (double boilers, time constraints, sauce breaking, etc.)  Just a couple of weeks ago I discovered this recipe, and I've already made it twice.  Some others have mentioned the acidity, but it doesn't seem excessive to me.  In the future, I may experiment with tarragon vinegar rather than white wine vinegar, and I might use shallots rather than onion, but it's really wonderful "as is".  I might also mention that I whisk after 7 seconds each time, because around the the edges of the bowl start thickening quickly, and I don't want the eggs to cook and curdle.  It only takes about 45 seconds of actual cooking time in my microwave for this to heat and thicken.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!

This was very easy and tasty. I would use a little less lemon as it was quite tart. The onions made the sauce a little lumpy in texture. I used sour cream and it worked well.

Delicious! I will make Bearnaise sauce much more often now, this is so easy. I used shallots instead of onion and dried parsley instead of fresh. Be careful not to over-cook it. Mine only required 40 seconds to get to the right texture. If you overcook it the butter will separate out and mess us the consistency.

This was excellent.  I ended up using rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  The end result was that it looked terrible, the butter seamed to be separating out, I think I over mixed it - mixed it to many times but the taste was still excellent.

The steam method worked perfectly.  There was a slight fishy overtone when I removed it from the heat but it may have been the freeze dried tarragon.  Not sure.  But the recipe works and is very good.

Delicious and easy.  I used a little less vinegar as recommended.  I was out of dry mustard, so used stone ground instead.  All of the burners on my stove were being used, so I chose this recipe, as you could make it in the microwave. It was perfect tossed with spaghetti squash!

Awesome, easy recipe.  I cut back on the acidic ingredients but when I tasted it, they were needed.  Actually probably added a little more than the recipe called for.  VERY easy and quick!

I love Bearnaise Sauce and I was so happy to find this recipe. I do cut down on the vinegar & the lemon because I find the sauce a bit overpowering as written. It's quick & easy. Try it! Thanks for the recipe!

I left out the Cayanne pepper, and it came out beautifully. One of my dinner guests was a chef, and said the sauce was perfect.

DELICIOUS and NO FUSS! I've tried complicated bearnaise recipes and this one beats them all in flavor and ease of make. I listened to previous reviewers and halved the vinegar, lessened the lemon juice, and took it out of the microwave to whisk every 30 seconds out of the 1.5min cook time. The mustard added a great extra punch and the consistency was perfect.

This was a very good knockoff of traditional bearnaise.  To be honest, I chose this version because you can cook the eggs long enough to get them done.  But I kept eating it for the flavor.  My only change was to substitute 1 T fresh tarragon from my kitchen garden for the 1 t dried.  I don't think you can ever go wrong substituting fresh for dried.  Served over asparagus topped char-broiled strip steak.  Fabulous for Fathers's Day.

Background: usually take the easy way out with Bearnaise and use Knorr's package mix (I know, not good) but had a friend with Celiac's over for dinner and when reading Knorr's ingredients ruled it out.

This was easy and much better than the mix (surprise, surprise). Never realized a butter sauce could be so easily made in the microwave. 

After reading through the reviews, I did follow the suggestion to half the vinegar amount. Glad I did - it was perfectly balanced with less.

Big old yummo for this one. Will make it again and again.

I made this recipe mostly as described. While it is pretty simple,  my sauce separated right at the end of the cooking time.  A splash more of cream and a vigorous whisking made it usable for my dish.  I do agree with another reviewer,  the tablespoon of vinegar is a bit too much and made the sauce too tangy for what I needed it for.  Next time I will use half the amount called for.

Definitely the easiest recipe I've come across, and it's pretty good. I normally use my food processor to blend the onion, lemon juice, and white wine vinegar together before adding the egg, cream, and blended mixture to the melted butter. I originally tried adding the egg to food processor as well, but found that it got a little too frothy for my taste. It is super important to stir the sauce every 30 seconds while microwaving, otherwise the egg will cook and become lumpy!

Wow - I can't believe I was finally able to make a Bernaise sauce from scratch!  I don't know that this was full on restaurant quality, but WAY better than the packet and so much easier than traditional recipes.  I followed it very closely, except had to use dried Parsley instead of fresh, half & half instead of cream, and I made on the stove top.  I liked having it on the stove top so that I could constantly stir it, only a took a few minutes.  I whisked all other ingredients besides the butter together on the side, and then stirred that into the melted butter.  Don't let the heat get too hot like I did (best to keep on medium low) as it did start to break up.  But lowering the heat and vigorous whisking got it right back in shape.  It continued to thicken on low heat.  It tasted a little too acidic at first by itself, but once we put it on the steaks it balanced out beautifully.  I am sure using fresh herbs and wine would make this even more amazing, so I will keep playing around with this recipe.

Both my husband and I loved this and I can't wait to try it on eggs!  I will definitely make again and I highly recommend!

Delicious, but cut about 1/3 of white wine vinegar if you want less acidity. So easy and fast. Thanks for this.

Works far better than I hoped for! You definitely have to account for the wattage of your microwave in the cooking times, and you can easily go too far and lose integration. But much simpler and faster than the stove top and less dishes to clean-up

I was hesitant with a microwave recipe and was pleasantly surprised.  It was quick and easy, the flavor and texture were great.  I will definitely be making this again.

My results were pretty good but next time I will reduce the vinegar a bit.
Also since I don't have a microwave I used a glass bowl over a boiling pot of water. 
It's easier to stir and control the temperature.

What an awesome recipe!  So quick and easy and the flavour is bang on.  I've always shied away from making a Bernaise because of the time, but this will be a regular steak accompaniment in my house. Loved it!!

Needed to add 2 Tbsp. Sauternes (Mom used to make it that way) and one more egg yolk. Better to use the stove at low heat (3 of 10) stirring constantly but gently. When thickened, remove from heat. Great for flank steak!

I agree with the recommendation for less vinegar. I also used part fresh tarragon (because I had some). I used it on a nice surf & turf (filet mignon and sea scallops), and it was excellent. The recipe needs to specify a microwave setting for the cooking; I used 70%, which worked fine. I think full power would have made scrambled eggs.

This recipe is fantastic!!
I make it for steak, roast beef, even grilled chicken.
So fast, so easy
Be mindful of the time limit for the microwave,  definitely stir every 30 seconds if it is cooked too long it will curdle. 
Enjoy!

I used Mitsuken rice vinegar instead of the white wine. Super easy to make and very delicious.
I put it over our steak and shrimp dinner.

Needs slight modification when using jumbo eggs - more lemon juice?  Microwaved, whisking every 15 seconds; done in less than a minute.

So I used these ingredients in the same amounts but I couldn't bring myself to try to microwave this so I did it the proper way with a double boiler. I think the flavours were great, maybe a little less vinegar or lemon next time. Otherwise I cannot comment on how it turns out with the directions.

A great sauce. Double up on the butter, tastes better and goes further. Sometimes if the lemon is very bitter, I add a few pinches of sugar.

My husband grilled some salmon and I made some asparagus, mixed with mushrooms and onions, and some saffron rice. Something that I've made a hundred times! Only this time, I added the béarnaise sauce and it kicked it up 10 notches! A definite do again!

Excellent sauce and oh so easy!!!  Made this for filets on Valentine's and the whole family LOVED it! I didn't have lemon juice  (I know... key ingredient, right?) but substituted 3/4tsp extra vinegar and it was fabulous.  Want super easy? I threw everything but the butter in my Ninja food processor, then added to melted butter and whisked. Took it out of the microwave every 20 seconds to whisk. Total time was 1 minute. When it thickens, it's done. It sat at room temperature for 5-8 minutes before we ate and separated a tad, but another good whisking fixed that beautifully.  I used fresh parsley and tarragon from my garden- probably a bit more than stated because we like flavor, but I didn't measure it. It was truly wonderful, will definitely do again!

Wow - top notch recipe! I've made bearnaise the old-fashioned way, and this is just as good and a thousand times easier. I'm using this with my montmarte copycat burger recipe.

Amazing. Fast and easy to make. My family was raving about it... glad we decided to make a second batch at the last second! Used it to make Filet Oscar... served six... zero leftover (someone decided to put it on their back potato, too, lol). The only thing I would add is that with the second batch we just cooked it on the stove. Didn't seem to take any extra time and the consistency was more traditional.

Brilliant. Easiest emulsion I've ever made. I'll never do the double boiler method again. I loved the flavours of thisbrecipe as is, but I might reduce the lemon juice by 1/2 tsp next time. Thankyou for this! As long as you follow the recipe to the letter, you can't screw it up. Definitely use a small.whisk not a fork.

Good if your only want enough for two or three  generous servings. Red wine vinegar also works well, but I do cut the amount of vinegar to a 1/2 Tablespoon. One Teaspoon of lemon juice is also enough for my taste. Half n Half  works if you do not have heavy cream, or you can even use whole milk. For a savory and satisfying change try using this sauce on Egg Benedict using thinly sliced Italian Sweet Sausage!

This was a very good recipe for Béarnaise sauce.  I wasn't sure it would be as good as my recipe that is cooked on the stove.  It was delicious.  I would definitely continue to use this recipe.  It is so easy, you cannot mess it up.

I was wary using the microwave to make this fancy sauce. But this is as simple as it is tasty and amazing. Make it!

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and did it on the stove. I used very low heat in my iron skillet and whisked gently, but pretty much constantly. It only took a few minutes to get perfect sauce. 
 I've had no luck with bearnaise in the past so I did it an hour ahead of time in case I needed to run out to the store for the cheater sauce. It  not only came out perfectly, but it kept perfectly until I reheated it just before serving over Steak Oscar. Many thumbs up.
My variations--I added all of the ingredients, except for the butter, in a bowl and whisked them together, herbs and all. I also added just a smidge of sugar to the final product as it was very tart.

Very quick and easy.  I did on the stove in no time at all - probably faster than stopping and starting the microwave a bunch of times.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used 1/2 & 1/2.  I was concerned when I added it to the vinegar mixture because it curdled instantly, but it whisked out and came out fine.  I agree with another reviewer that it was a bit too much vinegar for my liking and will cut back a bit next time.

Excellent recipe. I had to replace a couple of ingredients such as the white vinegar (Apple cider vinegar), dried mustard (spicy brown mustard) and the parsley was dried not fresh. I also cooked it on the stove while gently whisking the sauce. We absolutely loved it and will be making it more often.

I was skeptical about the microwave but it turned out wonderfully. I zapped it three times at 20 secs. each and whisked between.  I did cut down on the vinegar and lemon juice. Will make again!

This came out thick and creamy and was good. I agree with the other critique that there was a bit too much vinegar. Next time I will cut it in half or use white wine.

Classic béarnaise sauce uses shallot instead of onion, so I substituted. I agree on a little less lemon and wine instead of vinegar, but this is definitely a keeper.

I have made this twice now and the first time I found the vinegar to be overpowering. The second time I made a double batch and used 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of white wine and it was perfect! Love the ease of this and the flavor is great! Thank you for posting!

We served this to 16 dinner club members with a filet and it was awesome. Made exactly the way the recipe was made and everyone loved it.  I had it on my eggs the next morning and WOW so good.  

Will for sure use this again.
