Interesting serving platter and delicious side dish all in one!  With smoked paprika subbed for regular, this was delectable as a side with grilled turkey.

Well i have to say, when I pulled this out of the oven, I thought this was going to be a big flop. But my family raved on and on about it. I had to make a few changes though, no ceder and used vanilla yogurt.

These were yummy. I have to admit that I just sent my cedar planks to IBBZ home last week, so alas I no longer had cedar to cook these on :( Still delish though I added about a tablespoon of dark brown sugar. I will be making these for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing!

Neither my son or I liked this, and he normally likes sweet potatoes. My husband said it wasn't bad.  Kind of a lot of work for basically glorified mashed sweet potatoes.
