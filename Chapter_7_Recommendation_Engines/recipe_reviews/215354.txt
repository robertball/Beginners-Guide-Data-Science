I added a jigger or so of Whipped Vodka to this to make it a Melon Lime Cooler Cocktail. My husband and I shared this drink between us. Oh. My. Goodness. This was very, VERY tasty. We're so making this again.

Really really good. I know when I made this to start with....I let my honeydew stay in the freezer toooo long. My goof by time. I put them in the day before and froze for 24 hours, not totally meaning to ... but did. So when I put in the food processor, it froze all the sherbet to the melon...so I can laugh at this. Great way to make a supped up sorbet. But in order to fix my goof, I increased the lime juice and sherbet...and by then the mix loosened up some so that it was soft. The kids down it all. It had a nice refreshing flavor and the kids were tickled. It did leave about a cup of the mix left, so I stuck that back in the freezer for myself to have at a later time. Anyway...delish.

Used vanilla ice cream because I didn't have sherbet. Added lime zest to the fresh lime juice.  The result was thicker, more like a dessert than drink, but still tasty and refreshing.  Garnished with mint.  Hubby said it was the best ice cream dessert he's had.

Recipe Group Selection:  02, June 2012 ~ This was a hit in our house.  Served this with a Mexican meal and it went together really well.  I don't care for honeydew melon so I was sure I would not like it.  Well, I was wrong!  I loved the addition of the lime sherbet and I didn't measure the lime juice, just juiced the entire lime and added it, pulp and all.  This is a great summer time drink, and I think it would make a great 'adult version'.  Nice selection this week.

Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED this! I did not freeze my honeydew first, just had it chunked and in the fridge to get nice and cold...there was plenty of 'slushiness' b/c of the sherbert. I also really didn't measure anything, but used all of the ingredients listed. This was super refreshing and will be great on these hot summer days...hubby said this would make a good margarita...we'll see, lol. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group selection 6/2/11  It finally got warm enough here to enjoy this type of drink and enjoy it we did.  We tried some as written, and some with vodka, and some with coconut rum and loved them all.  BIGSIS knows what she's doing! Thanks.

This was very good and so refreshing.  I followed the recipe exactly - (my average sized melon equaled exactly 4.5 cups).  Next time I will partially thaw my melon, as it took awhile in the food processor to puree.  (Pulsing helped immensely).  This one's a keeper at our house!  Thanks for sharing, BIGSIS821!

If you don't add the lemon juice it makes it more sweet and I served it at a pool party and everyone loved it especially when you have all different flavors like watermelon or raspberry.

This is so good! Ive tried many drink recipes on here and this is by far my favorite! I used key lime juice instead and I think it tastes better than regular lime juice, my whole family loves this and we make it almost every saturday now.
