Very simple and tasty, I highly recommend this. There was one step left out on step two “blow up blinder” it happens.

I have made these many times.  Over the years, I have been making my own graham crust and following the directions.  They taste better.

I followed instructions but it ended up soupy. It never firmed up.  It was still good, just runny!
