Incredible recipe!  I will never make meatballs any other way!  I actually made the meat balls (added parmesan, basil and garlic powder, less breadcrumb) a couple of days ago and froze them.  This morning I just mixed the spagetti sauce and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with juice (skipped the puree and added basil, oregano, and a couple of tablespoons of sugar to cut the acidity) and added the frozen meatballs.  Cooked for about 10 hours on low.  Tender, flavorful, and delicious.  Plenty of delicious sauce.  Thanks previous reviewers, and thanks for this great recipe submission!

Great idea but having experience with meatballs helps:  There are WAY too many bread crumbs in this recipe!  The meatball recipe I use is one pound of meatloaf mix (pork/veal/beef ground and packaged in the same package), 1/4 cups Italian  seasoned bread crumbs, 1/4 Parmesan cheese, season with garlic and onion powder (since my husband has textural issues with some foods!), pepper and salt.  Mix this with one egg as the recipe suggests.  I do, however, like the twist of cooking them in the crockpot and NOT precooking them!  Awesome!  The sauce was greasier than I typically like (understandably, since you don't drain the meat...) but they were a huge hit at the party I took them to.  They would be FIVE stars if the ratio wasn't so off for bread crumbs to meat...

The meatballs were great; but, the sauce was VERY bland.  Before adding the meatballs to the slow cooker I baked them on 350Â° in the oven for 15 minutes.  This helped them retain there shape and to allow the grease to drip off.  I added two additional garlic cloves but it was still bland.  I would recommend finding a speghetti sauce recipe from here instead of using a store bought jar of sauce.  I used Prego traditional sauce, maybe a more flavourful jarred sauce exists?  Good luck! I will probably look elsewhere for an more tasty recipe.

Great recipe! I had to make a few changes- I had 2 lbs. meat thawed out, so I used all of it. I used 1 cup bread crumbs (Italian). 1 1/2 T. dried parsley, & sauteed the onion before adding. I also used 3/4 c. egg beaters because the crumb mixture looked too dry. 26oz sauce, 14oz crushed, & 37oz puree! ( it was the only size the store had, + I was using that extra meat!) I added a little Italian seasoning because of that & a little sugar. Next time I might add a little red wine, too! I cooked on high for the first hour, then stirred. Finished with 4 more hours on low. They turned out great. I also used Laura's ground round as always. Not greasy AT ALL!!! We used these for meatball sub sandwiches- YUM! I'll use the leftovers with spaghetti. I love slow cooker recipes! THANKS.

These meatballs are easy and awesome!  I prefer smaller meatballs, so this recipe yeilds about 30 for me.  I also like to place them on a cookie sheet and brown them in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Even if you choose not to brown them, they hold up well!  I also use a large onion; half of it chopped in the meatballs and the other half I chop and add to the sauce.  Other than that, I don't change a thing!

I have not posted in a LONG time but I am happy to see that my recipe is bringing good things to the table for most of the cooks! One thing to note-this is more or less a Basic recipe that can be added to, or modified that I see many have done. Also-In the original recipe, I did not note that I skim the grease-I think you need to use ground beef for the best flavor. Anyway, Happy eating!!!   Hunnie :)

So easy and so delicious! Plus it's a great way to beat the summer heat on nights when it's just too hot to grill. The recipe for the meatballs is very good and while I was skeptical about doing this in a crock pot vs. my usual way I was pleasantly surprised. I used a jar of my favorite Classico sauce and added a little minced garlic and fresh basil along with a few splashes of red wine along with the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it for 6 hours on low and it smelled wonderful. When it was done I served it on toasted crusty Italian rolls with some mozzarella and topped with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - YUM!

The meatballs ended up tasting great!  They had a good texture and flavor.  The only thing I would consider doing differently is baking them for a 20 minutes to keep the sauce from getting so greasy.  Other than that, it was terrific!

My very picky family loved the meatballs!  I took the leftovers to work and my coworkers loved it!  A very good recipe.  I cooked the meatballs the night before in the oven at 350 for about 20 min. to get rid of some of the grease in the sauce.

I use my slow cooker all the time, but for whatever reason, I never thought of making my meatballs in it. I used my own sauce recipe, but having had a lot to do yesterday, it was great not having to worry about stirring my sauce as often or having it burn on the bottom. The pasta gang loved it! Thanks!

for those with meatballs falling apart in the crockpot or lack of flavor, just prebake the meatballs for 10--15 min, added 1 tablespoon italian seasoning to the sauce, 1 bay leaf (remove after cooking) and 1 tablespoon sugar (brings out richness)then add the meatballs.  Should help w/flavor etc;

This is a great recipe that you can doctor according to the  tastes or those you are cooking for. I try to make the recipe as written the first time & base my rating on that. I gave it 4 stars because it is fine as written: easy & good tasting.  The second time I made this for my small group and wanted it to be a little more special and flavorful. I added onion powder, salt & pepper, freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the meat (omitted the onions as they tend to make the meatballs fall apart & some folks don't care for the texture). I made fresh bread crumbs, mixed them with Italian seasoning and added them last to the meat. I lightly mixed the ingredients and shaped the meatballs, put them in a roasting pan in a 450 degree preheated oven and immediately lowered the temperature to 350 degrees, then baked them for 15 minutes. I placed them on paper towels & gently patted the tops with another paper towel to remove excess fat b/4 adding to the crock pot with the sauce. To the sauce I added garlic powder, grated Parmesan cheese, about 1 T. white sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes, parsley flakes, and Italian seasoning.  An hour or so before they were done, I checked the sauce and added more Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt & pepper and grated Parmesan to taste.  I stored the crock in the refrigerator overnight, reheated it the next day and served the meatballs on rolls with a variety of peppers, pickles and sides.

These are the best meatballs I think I have ever made.  They are wonderful and I plan to make them again often.  The sauce is also good, but the meatballs steal the show.

Nice touch to making meatballs be it slow cooker or traditional pot, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of sauce to the meatball mixture and mix well.  You'll never have dry/hard meatballs.

I have searched and tried lots of meatball recipes and this is it!  Here are the changes I made based on reviews and past attempts. For the meatballs I used 1 lb of lean ground sirloin and 1/2 pound of pork sausage, I also added about 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese, 1 tbs of dried basil, a little garlic powder and about 1/4 cup of milk.  Then I browned them for 20 minutes in the oven at 350.  They come out fantastic and not greasy at all.  Also...instead of using jarred sauce...I used my own...I just use Mario Batali's basic red sauce...crushed tomatoes, onion, garlic, carrot and thyme. Fantastic!  Great for casual entertaining!

Simple and great recipe! As others have suggested, I cut the breadcrumbs down to 3/4 cup and I added 1/3 of grated parm. cheese to the meatball mixture. (I used 85% ground beef) I also baked the meatballs about 15 mins at 350 degrees.  For the sauce, I used a jar of Classico Four Cheese tomato sauce, 1 can of Hunts diced tomatoes in basil, oregano and onion, added 1 can of tomato paste, and one small can of tomato sauce. I mixed all the tomatoes and sauce in one bowl and added about a 1/2 cup of water. To the sauce mixture I also added 2 cloves chopped fresh garlic, a handful of chopped fresh basil, and a few teaspoons of Italian seasoning.
Cooked on low for about 8 hours. The meatballs held their shape and the sauce was awesome!

The recipe is fine except in order to get a better flavor you MUST brown the meatballs first.This process also releases some of the fat so it will not end up in the sauce.After draining the meatballs, add the sauce to the pan to pick up all of the flavor bits on the bottom. I know this creates an extra step but the results are well worth it. Also, I am not a fan of jarred spaghetti sauce of any kind. I always make my own and freeze small batches for future use. Jarred sauces just have too much sodium and many have unrecognizable ingredients.

I used ground turkey, only 1/2 c breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup parm cheese, and a chunky ragu pasta sauce w/o the crushed tomatoes or puree.  Made smaller meatballs (got about 33) and they cooked for about 5.5 hrs on low.  Served on wheat submarine rolls with mozzarella cheese and it was loved by all!

Very easy recipe. If you have a problem with grease either brown the meatballs first before putting in the slow cooker or buy ground beef that is 93% lean and there will be no excess grease.

Four stars as written (as everyone has repeatedly said, waaaaay too much bread crumbs called for in original recipe!). I cut the bread crumbs down to 1/2 cup and added another 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Also, any dish with tomatoes screams for basil. It must be used in this recipe. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried basil (fresh would be even better!), a DASH of oregano (this herb is very overpowering, so unless you really love it, only add a dash or you will be unhappy). The parsley called for is also a bit excessive. I cut it down to 1/8 cup. I doubled the garlic and onion and used lean, ground turkey. One last thing, add a dash of sugar or a cap full of whiskey to your tomato sauce. (If you use whiskey, remember it is a CAP full, not a cup full! lol. I hate the smell and taste of whiskey, but it blends in with the sauce and you will never know it's in there, but it does mellow out the sauce beautifully!) Okay, I know this was a LOT of changes, but this recipe as written has not gotten glowing reviews, and these are some changes that will take the whole dish from a bit bland and mushy to tasty and delicious with a fabulous texture to the meatballs.

I thought these were delicious and cooking them in the crock pot was just a bonus.  The only things I changed is cooking the meatballs in the over on 350 for about 15 mins before putting in the crock pot.  Also, I used 2 lbs ground beef and lowered the bread crumbs to 1 cup.  I did not have any tomato puree or crushed tomatoes, so I just used a jar and a half of two different flavored spaghetti sauces (one one roasted garlic and other was tomato basil and they were great together).  These were a big hit with the family, even the kids.  Definitely make this again.

I skipped the tomatoes and the puree and just used a large can of hunts meat flavored sauce. I also Added some parmesan, hot sauce and basil in the meatballs and the sauce. My meatballs didnt fall apart at all and werent greasy. These were the best meatballs Ive ever had!! I put them on a bun with some mozzarella but I liked them better just plain. I took the top off the slow cooker for about 15mins and it thicken the sauce up and took to the meatballs. Alot of people said the sauce was bland... she said JAR spagetti sauce soo that basically your own fault for getting sauce you didnt like. I loved this recipe and will use it often! thx!

This is one first recipes that I pulled off of AllRecipes and its great.  I make these meatballs at least every 2 weeks.  My whole family comes over and enjoys a wonderful spaghetti dinner.  On other occasions, they ask me when I'm going to be making my spaghetti again!  These are great and I will hang onto this recipes for years to come.

This is the only way I make meatballs anymore!!  I omit the puree and the tomatoes.  I just use a jar of sauce, my family is not big on tomatoes.  I also add the parmesan to my meat mixture.  I assure you that there is no need for the extra step of pre baking your meatballs.  They hold there shape.  I dump a little sauce in the crockpot and mix the meat.  I make the balls and place them directly into the crockpot and layer sauce through each layer.  They are nice tender meatballs and very flavorful!!!

Great way to make spaghetti & meatballs. I can't help but mess with recipes and I did this one, too.  I made the meatballs pretty much as the recipe said but I added chopped carrot, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, & herbs to the sauce. Finished it with a little cream at the end to make it a little Bolognese-like. I also recommend cooking these for only 6 hours on low. They were wonderful. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making this again soon.

Made this yesterday... It was delicious. The flavor turned out PERFECT! The ONLY change I would make next time is I will use 2 eggs to hold together the meatballs better, rather than 1 egg. 
I did not change anything on the recipe except that I used tomato paste instead of puree... I don't know if there is a difference but I couldn't find puree so I figured paste is the same thing. I just can't wait to make this again. In fact, I can't wait to have meatball subs with my leftovers!

This was one of the worst recipes I tried on this site. We ended up eating Burger King. The meatballs tasted like mush and the sauce was like water. I made the recipe as stated I even found the puree, I don't know what went wrong but this was a huge disaster.

I have made almost the same recipe for years now in the crockpot, because it is so much easier to do with a family. But for my sauce I use 1 lg. can of diced Tomatoes and a lg. can of Tomatoe Sauce.  And some people said the sauce is greasey which it is depending on what time of meat you use.  So if it is greasey I just spoon off the grease and stir it again and then just before ready to serve I add one small can of tomatoe paste to thicken it up some I don't like my sauce so thin.

VERY awesome!  I followed the recpe almost exactly but made more (used 2lbs meat and extra everything else and did only 1 large and one regular size prego.  I also added about 2 cups of water towards the end and threw in linguini noodles, put the cooker on high and let it all cook together for the last hour.  Made it for 8 kids and 4 adults and even my no protein 19 month old loved it!  This will be the only way i ever make spaghetti.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Make these small changes for an amazing full of flavor version:

I was careful to read all reviews on this before making this recipe. I've never made crock pot meatballs before so I was pretty cautious to ensure this was flavorful given some of the reviews and comments about the sauce.

Here are some suggestions to really make this a wow meal:
- Use a meatloaf pack (half pork half beef) instead of all beef. This adds additional flavor to the meatballs AND the sauce. You can usually find this combo pre packaged in the meat section of your grocer. 
- I agree with others here, bake the meatballs for 15 minutes at 350 first. This helps to retain shape and to give the outside a nice browning without drying them out
- Use a good 'fancy' sauce to ensure the sauce is flavorful. I used a roasted garlic one and added a half tablespoon of dried italian seasonings and it came out great
- Make sure to skim off the fat before serving

Hope this works out as well for you as it did for me and my family.

Rule of thumb guys, I lbs of beef, 1 egg and 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs, now add some seasonings that you like and cook these meatballs raw in your sauce of choice.  Now that's a good meatball!

I thought these were yummy. I didn't have spaghetti sauce so just used lots of canned tomatoes and added all my own seasonings. Easy! Made the meatballs the night before because my mornings are rushed. Coming home to 'dinner's ready' is awesome, and the house smelled great! Thanks for a good simple recipe. UPDATE: Used the meatball part of this recipe and cooked it in the oven at 350 for half an hour. Excellent!

I added things that i would put in my meatloaf- Mustard, Worcestershire sauce, a little mozzarella cheese and a little parm. cheese. I used half ground beef and half ground turkey and way less bread crumbs. I packed them well, and I browned them on the stove top to let the fat drain. 
Also, I sauteed extra onions, garlic and mushrooms before adding the sauce (Prego) to it. I then poured the sauce over the meatballs that i had placed in the crock pot. Excellent!

Absolutely wonderful!! I am not a big pasta eater, especially any kind of spaghetti stuff but I loved this! Even my VERY picky eating husband loved it! We both stuffed ourselves and then ate leftovers the next night, which we normally dont do. Then I made me a plate with the rest for work the next day. Three days in a roll we ate this. There was lots of sauce left which I decided to freeze and use for other pasta dishes. Even though it doesnt say to add any spices to sauce, I did add some oregano and parsley to the sauce. You cant go wrong with this dish!

I followed this recipe exactly and while the sauce was good the meatballs were to soft for our taste. If I make this again I will brown the meatballs first and cut down the cook time a little. Other than that which is just a personal preferance, I wouldn't discourage people from giving this a try. Thanks for the recipe!

The meatballs were delicious bit the sauce wasn't great.  Everything tasted better after sitting a day in the fridge, oddly enough.  I used turkey instead of beef.

This was a really good recipe. I must tell you that I am an AllRecipes Allstar and Brand Ambassador.  We were challenged this month to take a favorite ground beef recipe and change the ground beef to Johnsonville Italian Sausage, so that is what I did with this recipe.   I left out most of the breadcrumbs and used Italian Sausage pasta sauce.  Wow, tons of flavor.  I used egg noodles and made garlic bread.  My husband went crazy.  He really loved it.  Thanks for the challenge.  It made a great dinner.

Pretty good.  I will add some salt next time.  Plus I didn't decide to make these until the last minute so I oven baked them, then poured sauce over.  I can't wait to try them in the slow cooker.

These meatballs were very very good! I had never made meatballs before. I was looking for something simple and quick. I used this recipe but I used the cook time of another recipe. My hubby and I like BIG meatballs so mine needed a little more time in the oven. I also added some worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture! YUMMY!!!! Then instead of using spaghetti sauce I used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce. All in all these were great. My hubby thought they were great also! Thanks for sharing!!!

We had this tonight and this recipe will be a staple on the menu from now on.  The slow cooking really gave the flavors a chance to simmer and blend.  

I couldn't find "tomato puree" but the can of chopped tomatoes I used had puree in the can.  I used canned "Del Monte" spaghetti sauce instead of the Ragu-type jars you can buy and I think that was key to the fresh flavor.  

I haven't had such good spaghetti and meatballs since my Mom's.  Delicious!

The meatballs were good, but too much breadcrumbs.  I don't understand why you use a "jar of sauce" when tomato sauce is nothing more than tomatoes and seasonings to begin with.  Why add a jar of already made sauce when you are actually making your own with the tomatoes and puree and seasonings.  What happens is that the "jar of sauce" cooked another 8 hours becomes very very strong and acidic.  I think if you skip the jar sauce, this would be a great crockpot meal.  I never change a recipe when I first try it so as to give an honest review, but next time I make this, I will omit the jar sauce and maybe add another can of crushed tomatoes and a little garlic and, at the end, stirring in fresh basil just before serving and that will make this a perfect tomato sauce.

These were ok, but not something that I think I will be trying again.  Most of the meatballs lost their shape after cooking in the sauce all day.  I would suggest reducing the onion by half and maybe browning them prior to placing them in the sauce to help with this.  The sauce also lost quite a bit of flavor from the addition of the tomato puree and crushed tomatoes.  Adding some more seasoning or possibly garlic could also keep this from becoming too bland.

My review is for the method, not the recipe. I've been doing meatballs in the crock pot since I got my first one many years ago.  I do it for several reasons, the first is that my crock pots are the biggest pots I own, and I always make a huge batch..If I'm going to all that trouble I figure I might as well make enough for several meals. Secondly, using the crock pot eliminates stirring and prevents burning or scorching of the sauce and meat.  It's the only way to do this, especially if you are using an electric range, .as far as the recipe goes, haven't tried it yet..will probably stick to my own -

I made these for six hungry teenagers (are there any other kind?), and it was great! I added some roasted red pepper cause I like a little spice, but otherwise followed the recipe. I used 80/20 ground chuck as other reviewers said they could be a little dry-- but was dismayed to see a thick layer of oil floating on top at the end. I ladled it out, but the sauce was still a little oily. Plus there seemed to be too little sauce compared to the volume of meatballs. I served two each, but there were some who only wanted sauce. Next time I think I'll use leaner beef, and use only a pound instead of a pound and a half. Thanks, this one is a keeper!

A great recipe. I too pre-cooked the meatballs @ 350 for @ 20 mins, as I dont like a greasy sauce. Also added some parm cheese into the mix. Thanks!!

I made these meatballs using ground turkey and they came out amazing! So soft and flavorful- even though i didnt have garlic on hand I used garlic powder and used dried parsley as well. Instead of plain crushed tomatoes I used one with garlic in it. Didn't have tomato paste either but used canned tomato sauce. My husband and father in law loved these meatballs - I will be making them again!

This was so easy and my family absolutely loved it!  I didn't have any bread crumbs so I just toasted some wheat bread and crumbled it, added some italian seasonings to make seasoned bread crumbs.  It was delicious!!!

Based on some of the other comments, I reduced the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup instant cook rice.  I doubled the garlic and added 1/4 teaspoon dried basil. For the tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers to add a little zest to them. To reduce the grease in the slow cooker, I browned the meatballs for a few minutes in a non-stick skillet. They went over very well at a pot luck lunch at the office.

Pretty good. My husband is not a fan of crock pot dinners. Yet this is one that he asked for seconds on. Try it out on your loved ones that may not usually enjoy a pot dinner.

I was worried because of some of the reviews, but I thought this turned out great for being so easy!  I used the really low fat % ground beef, so there wasn't much grease.  I must have had a really good jar of sauce (Safeway Marinara), because it turned out fantastic!  I didn't have an onion, and I omitted the tomato puree--just jar sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, a little sugar, and some extra Italian seasoning and minced garlic for the sauce.  Maybe it would only be 4 stars if it was a lot of work, but for being easy and tasting good, I gave it 5!

I really shouldn't give 5 stars to a recipe a didn't actually follow, but it deserves it with the advice from others.  I only used 3/4 c. of breading + apx. 1/3 c. of parm. cheese and did bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 min. I used a standard jar and a 1/2 of spg.sauce.  My husband requested 2x's the garlic next time (he actually says I over garlic everything, but not this time!) Also, I froze 1/2 of the meatballs on wax paper, on a cookie sheet and after frozen put into a freezer bag.  These portions were enough to feed 10 adults (I shaped mine to be about 3/4 inch in diameter.)

I would say i absolutely love this recipe but i changed some things. It started with this recipe and changing it a bit made them extra delicious. They came out so good that it was a huge hit. As requested by my mother I'm making them for her to take on her trip. I'll snap a picture after :)

Thought was a great dish that was sooo simple even my hubby could put together. (Hubby doesn't cook) I even made extra meatballs and froze for another time when I could throw together in morning and dinner by 5.

followed the recipe loosely.this is not rocket science people.use what you have and season liberally with dried or fresh herbs.i had 1 lb of ground chuck which made 9 healthy meatballs.lots of minced garlic and whatever sauce that was on sale with a large can of whatever tomatoes are on sale.in a bit of a hurry,got the sauce in the crockpot and put on high.use only enough bread crumbs to bring the meat mixture together and bake off at 350 for 20-25 minutes.once it was bubbling turned to low.done in 2 1/2-3 hours.serve with linguini or make a meatball sub with hot peppers and mozzarella.

I made the meatballs on Sunday morning.  I actually doubled everything except the onion. There was quite a bit of onion in the batch and I am glad that I did not double it.  I am not a big onion fan but the flavor was perfect.  I ended up with 60+ meatballs (about golf ball sized).  I did add a bit of italian seasoning into the mix as well, otherwise everything was as written.  WONDERFUL!  I put them in the crock pot on Monday afternoon and they were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful flavor to them.  I actually froze three batches of meatballs for future use.  Each batch had about 16 meatballs.  Will be perfect for a fall / winter meal.  :)  Thank you so much for this recipe.  My hubby even mentioned that it is by far one of the best.

These meatballs were heavenly.  I did make a few changes.  I added some parmesan cheese to the meatball mixture and reduced the amount of bread crumbs. Added some minced garlic & onion to the sauce.  The results were fantastic!

These meatballs disappeared quickly. They taste great. The texture is super soft they actually melt in your mouth. Very happy with the ease of this recipe. Added 1/3 of a cup of Parmesan and 1/4 cup of ketchup to the beef mixture. Will make again.

This was simple and very good.  I used one 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of using the puree.  I also added some salt and pepper to the meat before making the meatballs and added Italian seasoning and a bay leaf to the sauce.  We really enjoyed it!

Absolutely delicious recipe!  I made this exactly as stated and it turned out wonderfully. I guess I made my meatballs a little smaller because I ended up with more than 16!  I browned the extra ones in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes and then froze for later use in my own Sweet & Sour Meatball recipe -- which, by the way, was ALSO delicious!  These meatballs have enough flavor that they worked perfectly with the spaghetti sauce AND the sweet & sour flavorings. Many, many thanks for a wonderful (and very versatile) recipe!

Gone are the days of struggling with meatballs in a skillet!  These are verrrry tasty! I plan to make them this way from now on. I used a rice ball shaper to form the meatballs, which is quick and consistent in size if you happen to have one.  Also, mixing everything else first then adding the breadcrumbs is easier than trying to do it all at once.  I couldn't find the exact amounts of the various tomato ingredients, but it doesn't really seem to matter as long as there's plenty of sauce.  Finally, I'd like to recommend serving these with bucatini..it's like a thick, hollow spaghetti noodle, goes perfect!

Turned out great.  I didn't use the crushed or puree, just jar sauce.  I used 90% lean beef, so no greasiness.  I used 1&1/2 jar sauce, and 1/2 hour before serving I used the last 1/2 to thicken up from the moisture that added to the crock pot.  Great flavor and easy to add/subtract to your liking.

I just made these, browning before to eliminate some fat and they taste great. Not bland at all. I did add some Mrs. Dash but I add it in most of my slow cooker recipes. Meatballs were easy to assemble with on hand ingredients. Thanks for sharing!

Not sure what happened here, but they turned out hardly having any flavor. Was hoping to have these to use for dinner all week. couldn't even finish them. The only thing I changed was to use whole grain bread crumbs and added italian seasoning. I like the flavor of spaghetti sauce that I used, but it seems that adding cans of tomato puree and diced toms would just bland it up. Why not just use 2 jars of the sauce that I know I enjoy? I did also brown them in the oven to cut back on the grease.

Excellent meatballs! One of the most comforting, yet easy to prepare meals I've had in a while. I followed the directions except I only used spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes + puree, because that's all I had on hand. Still turned out amazing! I did bake the meatballs at 350 first so the meatballs would retain their shape, then cooked the whole mixture on low for 6 hours.

Meatballs great, but unless you like a lot of grease I would suggest cooking for a little before putting into slow cooker. It gave me a little stomach ache, too much grease.

I loved the meatballs! I used my own home-made spaghetti sauce and used the directions for this recipe. It was a hit! I think the key is using the right sauce! I freeze the meatballs now and use them for a vatiety of recipes. They are great to keep on hand and make meals so much more simpler!

I thought these were very good!  I made meatball sandwiches which were awesome.  I did not add the tomato puree because i did not need the extra sauce.  I also baked them for 20 mins in a 350 oven to keep the shape.  I will use this recipie again!

I don't eat meat but my husband does.  He absolutely loved these meatballs.  Not sure why people had issues with them falling apart.  Mine held together great and followed recipe pretty much.  My husband said he wouldn't want meatballs any other way now.  Couldn't have been easier to make, so I will keep this one around and maybe try with my homemade sauce next time.

I thought this was okay and nobody really complained about it, but the sauce was just a little on the thick side. Next time I would definitely leave out the tomato puree and maybe add some extra sauce. The meatballs turned out fine though.

These crumbled while cooking, but were pretty simple. Next time I will try 1/4 of an onion because the meat wouldn't hold a whole onion in the mixture.

I, like others, baked the meatballs first. I put them on a broiler pan so they grease could drip down into the pan. I used my own sauce recipe, but used this as a guideline for making the meatballs. They were incredible. I used them for spaghetti one night, and then for sandwiches the next. My kids loved the meatballs. I need to make these again soon!

I've never made meatballs before because I feared the mess in the oven and/or skillet along with how long they take to cook. I must say this recipe made it very painless. I made the meatballs the night before then turned on the crockpot the next morning. When I got home from work all I had to do was make some noodles. It was great. I did however use 1 lb. Italian sausage, 1 lb. hamburger and plain breadcrumbs instead of Italian.

Very nice, even my very picky 3 year old ate 2 whole meatballs (After picking a little of the parsley off, os course). A lot of the greatness hangs on the spaghetti sauce you use, so pick a nice one.

The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is it was a very good BASIC recipe but alterations definitely needed to me made. 

1. I would recommend using more than 1.5 lbs of meat... for this to make 16 meatballs, they would have to be very small... I made a total of 11 (cooked on low for 8.5 hours and perfect)

2. Added more spices to the sauce. I read that it was very bland so I chopped 1/4 of an onion and added it to the sauce. Also added some fresh baisil, garlic powder, salt and pepper (basically whatever I had in my spice cabinet)

3. Precooked the meatballs like other reviews said... 350 for 15 minutes... no grease in the sauce

4. I wanted to make a little more sauce to freeze so used 28oz of puree.. worked well

5. Followed other reviews and used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs... 1 1/4 would be WAYYY too much

Again, this is a great basic recipe for first time meatball cookers like myself. I will definitely be using this as a "base" and continue making my own alterations.

I will make this recipe again, but will use 1/2 the amt. of bread crumbs; the meatballs tended to be "grainy".  I also added 1 t. of ground oregano and 1 t. of Italian seasoning to the sauce.  Used a medium-sized cookie scoop and got 18 meatballs.

Loved this recipe. did do a little tweeking. I used half Italian sausage and half beef. Cut the bread crumbs back to 3/4 cup and added some parmesan cheese. used tomato sauce instaed of puree. and like the other reviewers, I baked the meatballs for about 20 mins prior to the crockpot..Turned out very good!! Thank you!

I am reviewing this recipe but I changed a few things!! (But what I love about this site is seeing how other people's efforts turned out.) Mine was DELICIOUS. 
The concept is GREAT - that's what gets the 4 stars. This recipe really worked well for me. As other reviewers noted, WAY too much breadcrumbs listed - I used 1/2 cup - and I added 1/4 cup parmesan to the meat mixture. Other than that, the only change was that I used 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of spaghetti sauce (I don't buy store sauce, I always make my own, good, bad or ugly) and I added 1 tbsp of oregano and 2 tsp of basil to the sauce. I used 1 onion as listed, but I put half in the meatballs and half into the sauce. Also doubled the garlic (amt listed in meatballs, another 2 cloves in sauce) and 1/2 tsp salt b/c the tomato products I used were sodium-free. YOU MUST use lean beef - even if you skimmed this, the odd flavors imparted by beef fat (which are great in burgers) just don't work in sauce.  
This was a very close approximation to my homemade, 3-hour futzing in the kitchen spaghetti and meatballs, and the efforts took less than 15 minutes!! I am very impressed and will definitely use this again. Thanks for the idea!!

Too much bread crumbs for 1 1/2 lbs. of meat, used only 3/4 cup. Needs 2 eggs; and for more flavor I added 1/3 to 1/2 cup grated Romano or Parmesan cheese, 3/4 to 1 tsp. oregano or basil, and salt and pepper to taste. I added a little cayenne pepper for spice. Baked the meatballs for 20 min. on a wire rack @ 350 to 375 degrees, before putting in sauce; and only used 2 jars of sauce. I think the crushed tomatoes and tomato puree add too much liquid and no flavor, unless you add additional herbs and spices to the sauce. Cooked on low about 3 to 4 hours.

I tried it and it turned into a meat sauce lol....my meat balls fell apart and the cooking time was way too long cause it tasted burnt.  On the plus side though, if the cooking time goes down by maybe an hour or 2 and if you brown the meat balls first, I think this would be really yummy.  I'm going to try it again!

This was the first time that I had ever used my slow cooker to cook meatballs and they came out cooked perfectly.  They weren't burnt or dried out at all and I didn't have any problems with mine falling apart.  They came out cooked perfectly.

I would give this 5 stars for how it turned out, but only 4 for the actual recipe itself.  I think a lot of the good flavors here are dependent on the spaghetti sauce used, as the sauce as written is rather bland.  I used home made meat sauce from a friend that was very flavorful, but it was still dulled a little by the additional crushed tomatoes and tomato puree.  I added some extra minced garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and oregano and it turned out great.  I would do that again, or just use double spaghetti sauce instead of the extra tomatoes.  

I was a little worried at first that there would be too many breadcrumbs in the meatballs, but actually it turned out perfectly.  I mixed it very very well so there were no dry clumps and the meatballs held together great and were kept moist by the sauce.  I used 90/10 meat and found that this prevented the sauce from being greasy.

I would suggest cutting down on the amount of breadcrumbs, as my meatballs began to fall apart in the sauce.  Other than that, good flavor and fairly easy.

Great balance between meat and breadcrumbs. Of course, I didn't have exactly what was needed in the freezer. I made them with a couple of pieces of thin cut flank steak (ground up in the food processor) and an equal portion of mild Italian sausage patties. I also browned them in olive oil before they went into the crock pot. So not as "easy" as the original, but absolutely delicious!

Anytime you cook the meat in your sauce, whether it's sausage or meatballs, it always tastes better.  The meatballs or sausage absorb the flavors of the sauce and vice versa.  I always cook italian sausage this way, but haven't tried meatballs yet.  Great recipe.  Thanks for the idea!

These meatballs were very yummy! I served them with plain old spaghetti and they were a hit. I will say that they were pretty labor intensive. More so that I expected. Also, I made about 20 BIG meatballs, not 16.

My family really liked this.  I made the meat balls before hand and frozen them for a couple of days.  Just because I knew the day I was going to make them I wouldn't have time to shape them.  So on the day I made them I just put them in the pot frozen and they turned out great!

It really is easy! The yellow onion makes all the difference in taste in my opinion. I had done store-bought meatballs in the slow cooker, but wanted a fresher option. They tasted awesome with whole wheat noodles for me and tofu shirataki noodles for diabetic hubby.

Great! I used ground turkey and added my own spices here and there including a few splashes of red wine and a bay leaf for the sauce. I will make this often.

Made about 30 smaller meatballs. Froze beautifully. Instead of bread crumbs, used white bread dissolved in enough milk to make a mush and added a T. of Italian Seasonings. Used dried onion & garlic for ease. They melt in your mouth!

I made these the night before and froze them thinking they wouldn't overcook or fall apart, but they still fell apart bad.  In addition, I thought the flavor was bland.

I made the meatballs today.  The kitchen smelled terrific all day.  I made a few small changes such as using turkey meat instead of beef and skipped the stewed tomato chunks.  Very good recipe.  Simple too.  Last night I prepared the meat and formed the meatballs and this morning it took 5 minutes to get everything into the pot.  EXCELLENT for working parents!

SO GOOD!  I made these today after looking over the comments.  I did brown the meatballs for 20 minutes at 350 degrees in the oven according to the reviews I read.  Then I let them drain on a paper towel for about five minutes just to get some extra grease off.   Other than that, I pretty well followed the recipe as is.  I like to "doctor up" spaghetti sauce, so I did add some Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper to the sauce, just to taste preference.   My husband raved over this, and we both couldn't keep from going back for more tastes before dinner!  It was delicious!

These were very simple and good. I subbed half the meat as sausage for some tang and also added parm cheese as others said then baked at 350 for 20 mins so I could make them ahead of time and just add them to the sauce day of for an easy meal.

this is SO easy and SO yummy!  I mould the meatballs before I go to bed and put them in the slowcooker.  before I go to work in the morning, I pour over the tomato sauce and when I get home, the most delicious and tender meatballs await!!  thanks for the recipe!  I will never make meatballs any other way!

I used my own sauce, but the meatballs fell apart and became mush in the crockpot.  I made more of them baked in the oven (without sauce, with homemade barbeque sauce or sweet and sour sauce...) and they were great!  The meatball recipe itself is nice, but it seems they just dissolve when cooked in a crockpot.

Sauce was very bland even after adding a lot more seasonings to it and it was very oily. The meatballs were okay, but I have had better. It is an easy meal, but I won't make this again.

My family really liked these and I loved the fact that they were made in the crock pot and I didn't have to brown them first like a lot of recipes call for (kind of defeats the purpose of making them in the crock pot in my opinion).  I was afraid they would fall apart after 8 hours of cooking, but they held together and were really yummy!

Easy and great when pressed for time. I used the largest bottle of Prego I could find at the store. Made the meatball the night before. I made them larger than usual. I woke up baked them for 20 minutes at 350. Placed them in the crock pot and poured the sauce over them and they were awesome! I had dinner guests and they were really enjoyed the meal. They didn't fall apart at all. Thanks!

I think the reason some of the reviewers find the sauce bland is because, as they said, they baked the meatballs first. Much of the flavor comes from cooking the meat in the sauce! Healthy? Probably not, but it sure is good! Not a fan of the canned spaghetti sauce. You can avoid it with some tomato paste, or sauce and a few spices/garlic, touch of sugar!

I thought this was another great crockpot recipe! I work so much and always appreciate something simple yet delicious. I read some of the reviewers mentioned not very seasoned but I took the liberty to add garlic salt and fresh garlic which really spiced it up. Play with the ingrdients! We did not find the sauce too thick at all. This will be a keeper.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  It was great to come home from work to a nice hot meal.  Like others suggested, I used less bread crumbs--I used about 1/2 c. to 3/4 c.  I also added some green bell peppers to add some more flavor to the sauce.  I used ground turkey to make it a more low fat meal.  I cooked the meatballs for about 10 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees so they wouldn't fall apart.  But, with all of these adjustments it turned out great.  Oh, and I also added some seasonings to give the sauce a little more zip.  Thanks Hunnie0913 for this recipe.  I will be sure to use it again!

I thought these meatballs were very moist and delicious.  I did this recipe on the stove instead and cook for about an hour and a half on med high heat.  I could not find tomato puree so I used more a bigger can of crushed tomatoes.  Ragu Robusto sauce added some extra kick.  I never buy seasoned bread crumbs - just added some italian seasoning and garlic powder to the meatball mixture.  It was a little greasy.

Yummy & easy to make. Yet, I would add aome more spice and garlic to the meatballs next time......they tasted like plain balls of hamburger!!!  My husband, whom is very leary of anything cooked in a slow cooker for some unknown reason, enjoyed these but did agree on more spice!

Too much parsley for our taste.  Meatballs didn't fall apart which is good, and sauce was okay, but parsley was overpowering.

Used extra lean ground beef, reduces the fat in the crock pot. Meatballs kept their shape after cooking for 9 hours on low. Only used 1 cup of bread crumbs but will try with 1/2 cup crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese next time. Put the meatballs together the night before, covered & put in refrigerator and quickly put it together in the crockpot next morning. Served over rice.

I followed other suggestions and added only one cup of breadcrumbs. I used 3 garlic cloves and 1 t of Parmesan, but It needs more Parmesan and basil. For the sauce, I like the suggestion of adding basil, oregano and 2 T sugar to add a llittle sweetness. I think the sauce will be fine without the purÃ©e. It certainly makes plenty of sauce.

Made this for dinner and the family loved it. Lots of meatballs and sauce left for meatball on a bun the next day. I made it as written but next time I will add mushroom to the sauce and perhaps more Italian spices

Came out yummy...I did bake them for about 15-20 minutes to avoid excess grease in the crock pot. Definitely will use the broiler as well next time to get some more color....but they came out tasty and everyone ate.

Not crazy on this. The sauce was very bland and the meatballs ended up crumbling apart in the sauce, so it was more like regular ground beef in a spaghetti sauce as opposed to meatballs. I followed the recipe exactly to start with and then added a few dried herbs towards the end to try to give it a bit of taste but it didn't do much to save it. I wouldn't make it again. I will say though that the meatballs smelled really good as I was making them so it might be possible to fix these same meatballs a different way, but I'd pass on the sauce and the slow cooker next time.

Unfortunately, I found the taste of these to be really bland.  The recipe itself is very easy and filling for hungry boy teenagers, but if I try it again I'm going to use more garlic, less onion, and some other additional spices, maybe some bell peppers, to rev it up a bit.

This is the only way to make great meatballs.  If you bake them beforehand you lose the ease of the recipe.  To make your meatballs keep their shape, just add a bit more bread crumbs.  Even when I cook sauce and meatballs on the stove at a low simmer, I never bake the meatball first. Great recipe!

These turned out amazingly good! The flavor was perfect. The only changes I made were due to what we had in the house: dried chopped garlic, dried parsley, and 2 cans of diced tomatoes (one mashed to oblivion) instead of the crushed and puree.

5 hrs on low and 1 hr on high.

Awesome when served with basil pasta! Will definitely make again.

Didn't think was good as is. The bread crumb to meat ratio was off, and I would have liked a more exact amount of onion as I pre-chop all my veggies when I get home from the store so I had to guess. Next time I will probably cut this recipe in half (there's only two of us, and my crock pot did NOT hold 16 meatballs), double the sauce and egg, and pre-freeze the meatballs so they hold their shape better. Thanks to other reviewers for suggestions!

I wasn't sure about cooking meatballs in the slow cooker, but after reading other reviews I decided to follow the recipe with a small adjustment. I did cook them in the oven first for 10-15 minutes, then I put in the slow cooker for 4-5 hours on low.  My family loved them!  Thank you

I actually doubled the recipe and added some Rancher's Steak Rub by Wildtree to the original recipe (since no salt/pepper was called for). These meatballs turned out marvelous. I got raving reviews from my guests and I'll be making them again.

Added about an extra half pound of hamburger and added about a 1/4 cup of merlot to the sauce. Everyone loved it except my boy but he liked it - which is significant since he doesn't like much of anything :-)

Excellent recipe!  I used a jar of Bertolli Oil and Garlic spaghetti sauce and 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic in place of the crushed tomatoes and tomato puree, and the sauce was fantastic!  I personally like fewer onions and very finely chopped.  I have passed this recipe on to my sister!  Will definitely be making crockpot meatballs from now on...no more baking or frying.  Thank you!

I only added 1 cup of the bread crumbs and it was still too much.  It made them mushy.  Very bland recipe - no salt or seasoning in it.  I thought the pasta sauce would give them more flavor but it didn't.  I notice that nearly everyone had to doctor up the recipe to make it taste like something.  Also, even on low, this was much too long to cook meatballs.  I would never make it again.

I like the cooking method, but the sauce is really lacking.  Needs many more spices.  The meatballs could use some too.

Loved it. I took the leftover meatballs and made meatball sandwiches.. Toasted ciabatta rolls, added meatballs and mozzarella and put under broiler for second.. Sooo good.

The meatballs were delicious! With of the long slow cook time, substituting fresh Roma tomatoes on the vine is a fresh and healthy alternative to their canned cousins.

The meatballs were good, I did as a previous user suggested and added much more seasoning (we grow our own basil), parmesan cheese, cut down on the bread crumbs and froze overnight, but the sauce was Blah at best

Not a garlic fan in meat -  left it out of the meat mixture and used it in the sauce.  Much nicer.  Plus added sugar and sweet basil to the sauce and a bit of water.  Plus cooked the meatballs to remove grease.

I really liked this method.  It was easy and my meatballs were not greasy.  I used a 90% grade of beef.  My only criticism is that the meatballs were not very flavorful.  I even added 1 t. Italian seasoning.  I would definitely make again, but doctor up the meatballs more next time.  The house smelled devine all day!

Easy and spectacular recipe! I used Muir Glen Cabernet Marinara sauce in addition to other tomato ingredients necessary. It was perfect, but I probably should have sliced my onion much smaller (mincing it) so the pieces of onion were smaller. Other than that it was a big hit with my family and I served it over spaghetti with garlic bread. YUMM:)

These were very easy to make and tasted delicious!  I took the advice of others and baked them for 15 minutes before adding to the slow cooker.  I added this to my recipe box and will certainly make it again.

These were very easy to make and the entire family enjoyed them.  I made mine with half beef/half turkey.  Doubled the recipe so we could have meatball subs one night and spaghetti and meatballs the second night.  Easy dinner.

Made this recipe as is....loved it! It was so easy, and made plenty for dinner with pasta. Then I made meatball sandwiches for my husband and I a few nights later with the leftovers. My 3 and 1 year olds both ate two plates of it, so this recipe is a keeper. OH-I did reduce the amount of bread crumbs, I think the amount must be a typo??

One word -- Yum! I added extra garlic and Italian spice to the sauce because I tend to like my sauces with more spice. This will be a new favorite for my whole family.

Love, Love, Love slow cooker recipes that require little work on my part.  I actually made these meatballs the night before, shaped them, and put them in the refrigerator.  The next morning I put them in the slow cooker with the sauce, and at the end of the day, they were done!  My kids had an all day swim meet, and we were still able to have the pasta with meatballs dinner they were hoping for.  Cooking the meatballs for hours in the sauce makes them flavorful and moist.  This recipe is one that I will be turning to often.

This is my "go to" recipe when asked to bring a dish.  My mom also has me make a batch and then freezes them (after cooked in sauce) in packs of 10 or so. One thing I do is puree the onion so you get the flavor and no chunks. I also started using 3/4 lb. pork and 3/4 lb. beef.  EXCELLENT!!!

These were only my second attempt at making meatballs. They were very good,loved the texture. Am giving only four stars because they are somewhat bland, but with additions of various spices ,etc, can tweak to your own taste. Had in a sandwich two days later,possibly better than the day I cooked them! A keeper. Followed suggstions for baking in oven and blotted with paper towels before adding to sauce in crockpot. Next time will go with some other suggestions for additions. Thanks for recipe and ideas.

I made these following the recipe, except using 2 lbs of meat and upping the ingredients to accommodate. The taste was good, but I am not sure I like the texture that slowcooking brings to the meatballs. It's hard to describe, but they were almost grainy. Reminded me of chef boyardee meatballs.

This one of our family favorites!  We use ground turkey instead of beef.  I also omit the tomato puree and add a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  It always turns out delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly.  My overall rating is based solely on how fantastic the meatballs were.  Absolutely wonderful!!  The sauce, however, was very bland.  I will tweak the sauce in the future: some red wine, onions, more spices.

Love this recipe! I personally used a 1 lb ground sausage instead of the beef, and instead of the crushed tomatoes and puree just substituted a can of tomato sauce cause that's what was in the pantry. I also like more herb flavor, so I tossed in oregano and basil. The left over meatballs were fantastic on a hoggie with melt mozzarella cheese.

This recipe was very easy. I actually doubled the recipe I prepared it the day before and in the morning put it in the slow cooker. But like others you need to skim the fat alot so I think the next time I make this I will cook meatballs in oven for a few just to get grease out! Family loved it thanks!

I made these according to the recipe and they came out a little bland.  I will be making them again but will use a ground pork/beef mix to give the meat a bit more flavor.

This is a very delicious meatball! It's a very good starter recipe for anyone learning how to cook. You can add to it as needed or get a little creative if you'd like. This was a huge hit, and could EASILY feed a family of 4 WITH leftovers. BTW, my meatballs were a little larger than golf balls. It's also fairly inexpensive to make, and doesn't take a lot of time. Great if you work 40+ hours a week! I do suggest skimming off the grease though once you turn your crock pot off and let them sit maybe 10-15 minutes before serving. All in all, a big hit with myself and my family. :) :) :) :) :)

These were easy to make, held together well, nice moist texture, but very bland tasting.  Needs more garlic and spice for kick.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy and  my husband seriously drooled over it. He wanted it for lunch the next day and raved about it for a few days.I served the meatballs (cut in half) in hoagie rolls topped with a slice of Provelone. While I thought it tasted great, next time I would add a bit of salt to the meatballs and some italian seasoning to the sauce. Thanks

These meatballs were bland. On the positive side: easy to make, kept their shape (I used a ground beef/pork meatloaf mix). I used 1/2 parm cheese as suggested instead of all bread crumbs and dried parsley. But since they didn't taste fabulous, I'll try another recipe but continue to use it in the crockpot!

I had a lb. of meat so I changed the ingredient amount. Used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, 2T parsley, 1T grated parmesan, 1tsp basil, 1 tsp. garlic, 1tsp. onion powder, and 1 egg. I did bake for 15 minutes because I had the time and it did drip a bit of grease so I am glad I did that. I used 2/3 jar of Classico sauce, 1 chopped fresh tomato, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano and 1 T italian seasoning and 1 T sugar. Good part was the meatball shape (made 10) held up. Other than that, it was bland. Any more changes is altering the recipe too much so I'd rather check out a different one.

My daughter and her boyfriend really liked these. (I'm vegeterian, so I didn't try them.) They were easy to put together. I think next time I will make them the day before and refigerate them so it will be easier to take the grease off. I added some Italian seasoning to the sauce (about 1/2 tbsp). Be sure to chop the onion very finely or you will have meatballs with big onion chunks. Thanks!

Definitely follow the advice to reduce the bread crumbs.  It was a little overwhelming.  The sauce needed a little something extra.  However, overall it is a recipe worth saving to tweak to perfection!

The meatballs are fantastic! The only thing I did differently was brown the meatballs just a bit in a pan before slow cooking so they wouldn't fall apart. I added some onion to the sauce and more spices but it was very good. thank you for the recipe!

Wow. I've never made meatballs before, but this was a great intro.  I followed others' advice about reducing the breadcrumbs to 1/4 c., adding some basil, salt and pepper, using 1/2 the onion in the sauce rather than all in the meatballs.  I had to bake them (350 degrees for 30 min.) b/c I didn't have time to slow cook them. I use my pampered chef large scoop to shape the balls and I filled 2 cookie sheets exactly. I also added some sugar, basil, parsely salt and pepper to my sauce. I sauteed the onion with these ingredients in butter first before adding the sauce (Prego meat sauce) and 24 oz of chopped tomatoes (didn't have tomato puree). Best of all, my husband raved, my finicky 7 year old tested one and asked for more (yes!), and I enjoyed way too many. Served with some rosemary/olive oil bread and sauted asparagus. Great Italian meal! Thanks for a great recipie.

Awesome!  I used a mix of ground pork and venison instead of beef, and added about 1/2 c parmesean cheese to the meat mixture.  I only had one jar of pasta sauce on hand (Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato sauce) and I used a can of Aylmer Accents - Diced Tomatoes with Olive Oil.  I also followed the advice of others and decreased the amount of bread crumbs.  They were absolutely amazing!  I will NEVER buy store bought meatballs again EVER.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

This was OK. I didn't think it had too much flavor, and I did add wine and seaasonings to the sauce. It was easy though, and I liked the fact that I did all of the prep in the morning and came home to a cooked dinner.

These meatballs were really good.  I did change the recipe a bit b/c I could not do it in my slow cooker.  I hadn't thawed my meat soon enough.  I did the meatball just like it specified and baked them for 15 min.  I then threw it in a pot with jarred spaghetti sauce and heated it up.  These were yummy.

This recipe was OK... I did enjoy it more the next day, but it was kind of bland. I think next time I would use more seasoning in the sauce and/or use more jarred sauce. The meatballs were ok. It was nice to cook them in the slow cooker, but I think I will look for another meatball recipe. Oh, and I would agree that less breadcurmbs would be better. I followed the recipe and wouldn't use that much bread crumbs next time.

My bf and I were not crazy about this recipe. Made this for dinner tonight as we were both craving a "homey" meal (we have both been on the road for our jobs this month and are finally done traveling for a while - yippie!). The meatballs and sauce were terribly bland. The sauce part is an easy fix - just find a jarred brand that suits your tastes, add extra herbs/cheese or substitute a can of Italian-style diced tomatoes for the crushed variety as many reviewers have done. The meatballs, however, were very disappointing and I am not quite sure how to improvise. Despite adding extra garlic and subbing 1/4 c. grated Parm cheese for 1/4 of the seasoned breadcrumbs called for, they still lacked flavor. The meatballs were also too mushy for our tastes (they kept their shape during the 6 hours in my slow cooker, but as soon as we cut into them, they crumbled). One note: I had to end up adding an additional egg to my ground chuck mixture because I couldn't form it into meatballs (waaay too dry). A great idea, but not for us. I'll stick with my mom's baked meatball recipe (which IS the best!!!). Thanks anyways!

These meatballs were easy enough for my husband to make and just slip into the slow cooker to cook on their own. When they were ready to be served, we gobbled them up with delight. I will make sure that my husband makes these meatballs again!

I used ground turkey and baked them in the oven for a few to brown them. The end result was wonderful! I basically just used jarred sauce, but the flavors in the meatballs were amazing. Great way to add flavor to bland ground turkey.

I made this for my brother to have for dinner the other night (he's a bachelor that can't cook). I used ground turkey and added extra garlic and parm. cheese to the meatball mixture, then baked them for 15 min. before adding to the sauce. Used a jar of sauce and the diced tomatoes, left out the puree as I didn't think it needed it. My brother stuck the crockpot in the fridge overnight and then started it up in the morning before he left for work. He said when he got home he had "a great home cooked meal waiting for him". A great and easy way to have meatballs.

I was sort of adding meatballs to my buffet menu at the last minute, so I prebaked the meatballs in the oven, then popped them into the slow cooker with the sauce ingredients and cooked for about 3 hours on high.  They were perfect! I did add some dried oregano and basil to the sauce ingredients, and I have one very picky red-sauce snob in the family who raved about the sauce.  I didn't tell him I used jarred sauce for the base - he would not have believed me anyway!  Thanks for sharing - I'll be using this one again!

I love this recipe - everytime I make it for company I hope for leftovers but my guests eat it all - I wanted a meatball sub where the sauce was very tomato-ey and this was exactly what my palate was looking for, the only different is I make my meatballs with half ground pork and half ground beef because that is how my mother always made meatballs and I get a tomato & basil spaghetti sauce which has a bit of a bite to it.

I serve it on a submarine bun with mozzarella cheese....

This recipe was good. I think this is the way I'll make my meatballs from now on. Make sure to cook them long enough or you could brown tem a bit ahead of time.

Fall apart good meatballs!  I make up big batches and freeze them cooked under the broiler for quick dinners later.

Made this while on spring break with the family and wanted something to be done when we got back to the beach cottage where we were staying. I have tried many a crock pot spaghetti sauces and this one takes the cake! I loved not having to pre-bake or pre-fry the meatballs.  I think the key to the success of this recipe is that you find a jarred spaghetti sauce you really like. I used Trader Joe's Marina sauce.  It's the best and there's no artificial garbage in it!  It perfects the recipe.  My crock pot cooks very hot (even on low), so I only cooked mine for 4 hours.  I plan making this meal for my husbands father for Father's Day!

Wow! Just wow! My family loved this. I did make a few changes, some based on the reviews here. I used ground chuck, so there was no problem with grease. I made the meatballs the night before, and made them only about 1 inch in diameter. Since I planned to use these for Sunday lunch, I baked them for about 10 minutes in the oven and stuck them in the fridge until the next morning. Left off the tomatoes and puree, and just used two large jars of Ragu spaghetti sauce, to which I added extra garlic. My family was nuts over this, and we used it both over pasta and for sandwiches with melted mozarella cheese. Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I made it for my husband and he said it was delicious.  He did say that the sauce was not that good.  I noticed there was a lot of oil in it from the meat so this may be the reason.  I baked my meatballs for about 25 minutes beforehand.  I also put pieces of hard boiled egg and cheese in the center of the meatballs.  This is something my husbands mother does in mexico.  The cheese actually melted out but the egg was fine.  I also added some turkey keilbasa in there and that was wonderful.  It melted in your mouth.  Would probably make again but need to find a better sauce.

I love making meatballs in the slow cooker now!  I use fresh garlic and red pepper flakes to give it a little punch.  I then add two jars of spagetti sauce and 2 bay leaves.  Last 30 mins I take bay leaves out and add spaghetti and let it cook in the sauce with meatballs.  Yum!

My husband and 2 year old loved it; I thought it was pretty good but felt the meatballs could have used more seasoning.
It might have been because I used regular bread crumbs but I did add 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. Next time will use the seasoned crumbs or add more seasoning. I baked the meatballs for 15 min. prior to adding to sauce hoping to avoid grease in sauce but really didn't  see any drippings,still had greese in sauce. I used a 26 oz. jar of sauce and a 28 oz can of pear tomato strips with basil in puree because thats what I had on hand. I added some garlic and italian seasoning to the sauce. Overall good recipe it was nice to come home from a cold night of trick or treating to!

WOW! These were fabulous! Everyone loved them from my wee little ones to my parents. We had them over sauce one day and meatball subs the next day. I did brown them in the oven for 15 minutes as well. Next time I will try ground turkey and make a double batch and freeze them for a rainy day!!

Overall this was good. I omitted the onion.  Instead of the spaghetti sauce and the other tomato ingredients, I just used 2 jars of meat flavored sauce.  This was a hit and the leftovers became meatball subs!

The meatballs were decent, but not the the sauce.  The slow cooker seemed to bring out all the acid in the tomatoes, and it made for a very disappointing and bitter sauce. I won't make this again.

Very easy and tasty! However, use the leanest beef you can find to keep it from being greasy.

This is a great basic spaghetti and meatball recipe. I substituted extra lean ground turkey for beef and instead of using all that fresh parsley in the meatballs, I used about a tbsp of dried parsley. I also mixed some black pepper into the meat and garlic and onion powder rather then using fresh garlic and onion. As for the sauce, I used a full can of spaghetti sauce, half a can of diced tomatoes and a few spoons of tomato paste and seasoned with oregano and basil. I served with fresh spaghetti noodles and fresh parmesan grated on top. YUMMY! I loved being able to use the slow cooker for this and will continue to make it often.

made this several times now - add extra spices to sauce - garlic, basil, oregano, parsley.  Find it a little bland without. 
 I also add 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to 2 lbs hamburger meat with a little garlic and onion powder and 2 eggs.   We really enjoy it over pasta or as subs.

Awesome and so very easy to do. However time was of the essence, so I cooked them on the stovetop in a large pot for an hour and a half.  Definitely will be a family favorite.

I am surprised that I actually made such delicious meatballs.   This is the first time in my life where I am actually satisfied with the taste of "homemade meatballs."  This is an excellent recipe! I will use again and again.

This recipe is not very flavorful. It's missing something, but I'm no chef so I don't know what, maybe just salt. The taste was bland and texture of the meatballs was mushy, they didn't maintain their structure. It was edible, but I won't  make it again.  It seems like these are a good start for someone with culinary talents to expand on.

My family loved these, however they were so tender that they were falling apart, which is not necessarily a bad thing, I just wanted them to stay together better. I made my own sauce so I can't comment on that part of the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  We doubled the recipe and added parmesan cheese to the meatball mixture.  Definitely bake the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 15 - 18 minutes.  We added an additional 2 jars of spaghetti sauce.  I cooked on low for about 8 hours.  Everyone loved the recipe!  Definitely will make again!  A keeper.

So salt or seasoning?!? My son didnât like them they were bland and I even added cheese to the meat:( Good concept for easy slow cooker meal and yes you can salt your plate but I donât think it would hurt to add at preparation of recipe.

Unbelievable! The sauce was so savory that I could have eaten that alone. I followed directions to a t, which I usually donât do, but Iâm so glad I did. I used Hunts canned garlic and herb spaghetti sauce.

Disappointed. Had to alter the recipe. The meat balls would not stay together. Added another egg  and water. Helped a little. 
I think the recipe calls for too much bread  crumbs.
Had a onion flavor which I like.

Was easy and tasty.  I got a late start, so I cooked them in a large pan on top of the stove.  Cooked them at medium simmer, gently turning for about an hour.  Add  Al dente  penne pasta , added to the meatballs and sauce.

this was an easy recipe to follow & came out pretty yummy. I would suggest instead of baking the balls @ 375 for 15min, put them into a deep skillet and brown all sides of them before transferring them to the slow cooker. also, I added some fresh white mushrooms and some garbanzo beans to the pot cuz the sauce I used was ragu traditional .it came out great! I served it with rigatoni pasta

This was awesome. The only changes I made were ones of convenience or necessity. I had 2 pounds of ground beef and didn't feel like dealing with fresh parsley or garlic so I used dried. I used the recommended amount of bread crumbs plus a bit more. I followed another reviewers suggestion for freezing them and throwing them in the crock frozen since I was going to cooking them longer than the recommended time. I didn't have the tomato puree but did have a little extra spaghetti sauce. I did season my sauce with garlic powder and Italian seasoning and found the sauce very flavorful. Will definitely make these again.

Good - but I needed to make some changes: I added garlic powder, basil, pepper, and 1/2 c. Parmesan to the meatballs, I reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 c., and I put the onion in the sauce and cut them in large chunks.  For the sauce, I removed the tomato puree, added 2 minced garlic cloves, basil, oregano and 2 T. sugar. I made them into about 30 meatballs, baked for 15 minutes at 350F to cut the fat, and refrigerated until the next morning, removing any remaining fat.  My slow cooker runs hot, so these probably would have been done in 4-6 hours. The nutrition facts are deceiving since they're based one one meatball.  Who eats one meatball? Not me!  :-)

I will certainly make it again.  Fast & easy. Like the other reviews, I put the meatballs in the oven for 20 min.at 350. I also added salt and pepper and spices to the mix for extra flavor.  Very good. Doubled the recipe and froze a batch for unexpected company.

Made a couple of changes. I added grated cheese to the meatballs and used 2 eggs because I used more hamburger. I didnât have tomato purÃ©e, so I used some beef broth instead. I used spicy tomato sauce. I followed the recipe as written. I cooked it on low even longer than I should have because I was out and didnât get home in time. The results were excellent. They were  some of the best meatballs and sauce I ever made. I am Italian, so I have made plenty. I will definitely be making this again.

These meatballs were really easy to make, except for the part of grating the onion.   It took quite a while to do that and I finally gave up and just finally chopped the remaining onion.   Are used a jar of high-quality spaghetti sauce (Organica Bella marinara) and a 28 ounce can of mashed tomatoes. That was more than enough sauce. It needed more seasoning so I added about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and at least one and a half tablespoons of oregano  and some salt and pepper.  Turned out great. The meatballs stayed together nicely with the amount of breadcrumbs the recipe called for. I probably would not have used that many breadcrumbs if I had made it up myself, but this amount is good. I would definitely make this again.

All I would say is don't chop the onions (unless you just WANT to) - mince or grate them. The meatballs are much easier to manipulate and they hold together better. And I absolutely will be making them again!

This recipe lacked . . . I am not sure what. But it was too bland. My wife looked at me and said, "Please stick with the meat sauce, Honey."

I RXd this recipe and I agree with one of the reviewers about it being bland. I found both meatballs and sauce to be lacking in umami. I think I will add a bit of salt to the meatball mixture next time and brown them before adding into the slow cooker. I give it 3 stars because it was very easy to make.

My children loved it. I made an alternation to this recipe by baking meatballs in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes before adding them in the sauce. This helped meatballs become more dense and spongy. I will repeat this recipe.

I love meatballs especially the traditional italian style! I did add 1 t more ingredient & added 1 extra step. I add a little parmesan to the mixture, not alot since we add more before eating. I also broiled the meatballs for few minutes until brown prior to placing in slow cooker (I've also pan fried /seared etc.. but this takes longer) . I prefer the texture that the oven or pan frying gives you over the soft mushy texture from cooking straight from the Crock-Pot. I'm not a chef by a long shot but trying recipes here and there, tweaking a little or a lot it seems, this is the recipe we come back to. Thanks

My very picky elementary aged dinner guest fully approved of this meal. It was a hit and now I keep stuff to make it on hand. Itâs cooking in my crockpot right now and itâs all that I can smell.

I switched ground beef for ground turkey and replaced the parsley with italian seasoning(all I had on hand). I also added a little mozzarella  & parmesan cheese. They came out fantastic! Will be making this again.   :)

I made this ultimately to take to my daughters cell group to feed all the girls for dinner one night, so I doubled the recipe so my family of 6 could eat off of the same meal and everyone LOVED it! My daughter said all the girls kept talking about how good it was :)

I make this ALL the time and it has become a family favorite. I have changed up the ingredients in the meatballs a bit and vary the flavor of the jarred sauce so that it doesn't taste exactly the same every time.
Serve it with different types of pasta and today serving it with ravioli. 
Easiest recipe ever and complete you cannot get it wrong!
Bon Apetit!

Delicious! I used whatever we had on hand! As far as ground meats I did 80/20 and ground turkey w/bacon and then halved the breadcrumbs! These meatballs were so tender ... and then with using whatever jarred canned and liquid tomato products I had ... thee best sauce!! Plus I threw in an eggplant and parmesan rind for goodness measure! Thank you chef!

Wonderful meatballs, I tweaked the recipe slightly added two eggs and additional sauce. Over all the meatballs were great, it made enough for dinner and meatball sandwiches the next day!

These meatballs turned out great!  Even those more particular dinner guests enjoyed them. I did not make any changes to the recipe other than crafting "Italian" breadcrumbs by using Panko breadcrumbs and salt, garlic salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. I used ground sirloin 90/10. Made an extra 1/2 recipe and cooked for 7 hours. This maxed out my 6 qt crockpot - although could swap more meatballs for sauce, unless you want sauce for pasta. Will definitely make again!

I bought a lb of ground beef. Then, decided I'd like slow cooker meatballs and searched the site. I read comments and decided to saute onions, green pepper, and garlic plus add seasonings. Then, I decided that it wouldn't be good to add hot vegetables to the jeat mixture as it would cook the egg. I soaked the bread crumbs in some milk. I added raw onions, formed the mixture into balls, and browned in the sauce pan along with the vegetables. I didn't want to put raw meat into the sauce. The sauce is leftover jarred spaghetti sauce and an 8 oz can if diced tomatoes plus seasoning. To that I added the meatballs and sauteed vegetables. It says cook six to eight hours. As mine were partially cooked and looked done, I cooked for 3.5 hrs, I think. In any case, they were thoroughly cooked. I never have any luck with meatballs. I'll call these a success and will make them again. It's nice to cook sans oven and without watching meatballs overcook in a fry pan. I didn't make pasta but served with good bakery bread. We're it for a family, idcook spaghetti and shave parmesan cheese on top. Maybe, I'd add fresh, sauteed mushrooms and more green pepper. I spiced with chili flakes as reviewers complained of a bland sauce.

I made a couple of changes based on what I had available. I used ground turkey instead of the beef, Pankos bread crumbs and Mediterranean seasoning since I didnât have Italian breadcrumbs and dried parsley since I didnât have fresh. I grilled some onions and bell peppers and made a meatball sandwich on a Kaiser roll topped with the onions and bell peppers. Amazing!!!!!

I was quite pleased with this recipe.  It combined the ease of using canned sauces with the homemade touch of the meatballs!  I used ground turkey for mine and I cut the bread crumbs down to 1/4 cup.  I also added generous amounts of garlic powder, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, basil, oregano, and onion powder to the sauce.  I just kept tasting it until it seemed flavorful.  I left out the tomato puree (didn't have any).  I will certainly make this again!

Delicious! I did add some salt, pepper and a little Parmesan cheese to the meatball mixture and also added in some garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano and sugar to the sauce to jazz it up a bit. Really couldn't be easier to make, and it was nice to have this ready to go at dinnertime. I made smaller meatballs, so I cooked them less time, obviously. This recipe is nice because you can season the sauce and meatballs any way you like and just use this recipe as a guide for cooking them in the slow cooker, which is great and something that I would've never thought to do! I will def be making these again~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are probably the best meatballs I've had in awhile.  I can't stand the frozen store bought meatballs and some other recipes for homemade just don't have any flavor.  However, this recipe is packed with flavor.  I made a batch for the crockpot and a batch that I just baked in the oven with no sauce (my son isn't big on sauce!).  Both batches came out fantastic!

I am eating these as we speak and they are SUPER delicious. Like many other reviewers, I did make a few edits to the original recipe:

1. I added salt, black pepper, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes to the meat mixture
2. I used only 1 cup of breadcrumbs
3. I baked the meatballs at 350 for 15min the night before in order to cook off some of the fat and also brown the meat
4. I added salt, pepper, dried garlic, and red wine to the tomato puree/crushed tomato mix
5. I used a good jar of sauce... we like Newman's Own Sockarooni.

We cooked them in our instant pot for 6.5 hours on medium.  Delicious!

I used ground flax seed instead of the bread crumbs, used 1 cup versus the 1.5 recommended.  It is a great way to get extra fibre in.  I also changed the sauce from 680ml spaghetti sauce and 796ml diced tomatoes, it's what I had on hand.  I added Italian spices to the sauce after reading the other comments.  Served it over spaghetti squash. Yum yum

I made mine with home canned spaghetti sauce and home canned tomato sauce. Added a can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Loved the nice soft meatballs. I love having a recipe that does not call for browning them. I left out the onion and added adobo seasoning, paprika and just a pinch of cilantro along with the thyme, basil, parsley and oregano. So delicious. Next time I'm going to try half ground beef and half italian sausage. Yum!

I loved these. They were really flavorful and very easy to make. They definitely needed the full 8 hours of cook time, though.

My husband and I loved these meat balls. I used just 1 cup of bread crumbs and followed all other directions. We will make again. For the leftovers we put the noodles in the pot with the sauce and meatballs and put it on warm. For 2 it was dinner then lunch the next day. Great for our weekends!

For less fat use  ground turkey or chicken (93/7) ratio.
I also added milk (1/4 cup) and parmesan (1/2 cup). I'll even give you my secret spice...1 TBS paprika. Much less greasy sauce than with beef and just as tasty.

Amazing!!! Saved me sooooo much time. I used what I had on hand. Used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, used oats instead of breadcrumbs and added Parmesan to the meat also. The sauce can be bland so add your Italian seasonings!! Load up on all the flavors that you love!! I used and Italian seasoning blend and used a bunch of dried sweet basil and a ton of garlic powder and added 2 tablespoons sugar oh and a dash or 2 of salt. I cooked on high for 3 hours. I was in a time crunch and they came out perfect!!! My picky boys are it all up!!

I actually made these in the pressure cooker which only took 15-20 minutes. 
They are good but this is waaaay too much onion. Cut in half.

This was simple to make & very tasty; my husband loved the meatballs & sauce!  The next time I make it, I do think I will add salt, parmesan cheese & some red pepper flakes to the meatballs to give them a little more flavor.  Some people may find them to be a little too bland by themselves.  Slow cooking in the sauce & tomato mixture all day does help to give them their flavor.  All in all, a solid recipe & I will definitely make again.

I need gluten free, so I crumbled up some toasted gluten free dense bread from Food For Life instead of breadcrumbs.  I added about a Tablespoon of Italian Seasoning to the mixture, since I wasn't using seasoned breadcrumbs. Didn't use cheese at all.  I followed up by baking them, which was great.  When I added them to my crockpot, I used only pasta sauce.  Roasted Garlic from Organics.  Then I added some dried Oregano and dried Basil to the sauce to balance it out.  Finally, I added a splash of red wine.  For noodles, I use Spaghetti Squash.  Delicious meal!!!

I use 1 lb ground beef, because that's how it's sold. I use 1/4 of an onion diced finely. And 3/4 cups of gluten free bread crumbs. But other than that I stick to the recipie. Great for having meatballs in the summer when you don't want to heat up the oven.

This was an easy recipe which was great for me.  I cut the bread crumbs down to 3/4 c., took out some of the onion, added about 1/3 c. of fresh chopped basil and about a Tbsp of dried Oregano.  Per others reviews I baked the meatballs for 30 min at 350' before adding them to the sauce and slow cooked for 8 hrs.  Two of the meatballs fell apart (oh well) but my husband loved, LOVED it so much that if I hadn't been in the same room with him, I would have thought he was with another woman!! (LOL)  I'll definitely make them again!!

Perfect meatball base. I substitute fresh onion for dry minced onion and sweet baby rays bbq sauce for the tomato sauce. Family loves it, even the picky ones.

Love this!!!! Usually beef meatballs are  boring and not great in my opinion, but these were a great surprise!  I only put in about 1/3 C seasoned bread crumbs and also added oregano, basil, and cayenne to the meatball mixture. I put chopped onion and red pepper flakes in the tomato sauce also. Baked the meatballs about 20 minutes to drain some of the grease. The meatballs held their shape great. Served it with the choice of pasta or spaghetti squash.Only thing I will do differently next time is to double the tomato sauce mixture. Will definitely make these again!

This is a great recipe, it was a huge hit at home!  My 4 year old now requests meatballs for every meal.  I made this recipe exactly as directed except for some minor things that I picked up from other reviews.  I browned the meatballs in the oven first, I cut down on the bread crumbs, and I added onion and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  The sauce is very thick but I liked that.  I think it the future I might try adding oregano to the meatballs but other than that, the recipe is perfect!  Thank you for sharing!

Great idea! Too much on the bread crumb side I think. Maybe 3/4 cup at the very most. I also added some grated parm to the mixture. Force of habit. Cooked them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes first to help limit the fat but I still had to skim some off the top. Not a big deal. These were yummy.

Meatballs were really good. Sauce not so much. I usually put a lot of seasoning, caramelized onions, garlic, and red wine in my slow cooker pasta sauce.  Don't use a recipe. So this was very bland to us. We ended up throwing out a lot of it, and I can't afford to do that. So, since I only used half the meatballs and froze the rest, I made the sauce my usual way. _Much_ better. Oh, and I browned the meatballs before using/freezing them.

Great recipe!  Easy, tasty and I'll definitely make these again.  I took a reviewer's advice and baked the meatballs in the oven for a half hour at 350 first, then put in the slow cooker with the sauce and slow cooked all day and night.....awesome!  I added Italian seasoning to the sauce to give it more flavour.  I also added parmesan cheese to the meatballs, left out a bit of the breadcrumbs.  Again, this is a keeper!

If you have  family member/s that needs gluten-free recipes, substitute Italian seasoned panko gluten-free breadcrumbs but first put them in a processor.  I also use extra lean free range beef/pork, extra garlic & parma cheese! No one knows the difference & your sauce isn't greasy at all!

Perfect base recipe as mentioned and you could have fun with this in different ways.  I lessened the bread crumbs, added parmesan and various spices, cooked the onions in advance, increased the sauce and didn't add puree and baked the meatballs in the over for 15 minutes.  They held their shape perfectly and we had great meatball hoagies with lots to freeze for a later date.

Very good and extremely easy.....there is no need to brown the meatballs...I use ground turkey instead.....I skip the purÃ©e ..it's not needed.  Just add in extra grated Parmesan cheese to the meatball mixture and  to the sauce.

Making the meatballs smaller lets one put them in a hoagie or hot dog bun. I used my bounty of fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of the canned and I skipped the puree. It just was not needed! Really good flavor! And yes, browning them first is a good idea!

I've made these meatballs only once but my husband and I (and our one year old baby girl!) all LOVED them.That's saying something because both of us are more picky then our baby! Before making I read some comments and decided I'd cut back on the bread crumbs & bake them in the oven for 15-20 min before putting in crock pot. I also don't really like onion but didn't want to ruin the flavor so I sauteed the onion. (Thanks to a review I'd seen) and then put the onion in food processor with garlic. I used a whole head of garlic and only half the onion. It was fantastic!  I saw what others had written about bland sauce so I didn't add any extra tomatoes or puree, I substituted more jarred spaghetti sauce.
 Tomorrow I'm making it for my sis in law and mother in law. Going to use two thirds ground Turkey and one third beef. Other then that I'll follow the same plan as last time and I'm planning to impress! :)

Probably the best meatballs I have had made myself. Of course nothing beats my Italian mother-in-law's but this recipe keeps my husband happy.

OMG, of all the recipes to pick, I picked this one for Christmas Eve! I kept checking it all day thinking it's has to get better. A lot of people rated it well, but finally I had to give up. It's a big greasy mess. None of the meatballs are balls anymore. I guess I'm serving Italian chili.

I've made these several times and they are really great.  my problem is too much sauce to fit in my crockpot and couldn't find smaller jars of puree or crushed tomatoes.  However where there's a will there's a way.  Great recipe

Very good, however most jarred sauce is 24 oz.  Also could not find the puree or crushed tomatoes sizes, so used 35 oz crushed in thick puree.   Also substituted ground pork/veal/beef mixture for the beef.  Served over linguine.  Would definitely make again.  So easy.   One comment is my s/o did not like that meatballs where not crusty - like when you pan fry.   However, I had no issues

Great recipe > Thanks! I used 90% lean ground meat and my own sauce. I had no problems with the sauce being greasy. My husband loved them and said that they were even better than the ones at our favorite Italian restaurant.

I was looking for a crockpot meatball for an easy get together food and tried this one based on the positive ratings.  The meatballs were bland and a little grainy as others had commented.  Shoudl have read further and really checked it out.  They were easy to make, but need more spice for sure!

Awesome recipe! Although It needed a few changes.. a little plain... I used for spag sauce Francesco  Rinaldi, I think if you are not making homemade sauce ... This is the sauce to go with... I also Bought jumbo garlic clove... They are very big I sliced in half and threw it in sauce to help with flavor.. In the sauce I added 2 cans of tomato, Crushed and pureed I also added garlic powder and parmasean cheese and alittle bit of fresh parsley. For the meatbalss I soaked a slice of bread in milk and crumbled into my meat mixture,  I also used a bit of grounded pork, Thepork helps with flavoring.... Even if you put a piece  of pork chop in the sauce for flavoring will work just as well. Absolutely delish...They were a huge hit at the birthday party! In fact another woman brought meatballs... and hers went untouched=(.... Mines were gone within minutes=)

very good - i cooked mine in the oven before hand to get them brown first and drain some of the grease and they turned out great! make sure to either grate the onions or make them pretty small if you make smaller meatballs.

I am giving this four stars because I thought it was great but my husband thought it was just all right. We both agreed that there was not a huge amount of flavor except for tomato but they were still really good. We used it for spahgetti as well as subs the next night. Enjoyed the subs more.

I've been making these since 2003--and I love them.  They are tender and delicious  SO tasty.  The sauce is a little oily since you aren't draining off the fat, but it all cooks in together and tastes scrumptious.  I use these for meatball subs--delicous!

So I seem to be the only one who does not love this recipe. My husband made them for the first time months ago and they came out so great that we thought we'd never order another from a restaurant. I've made this recipe 3 times now the last being this weekend and every time it comes out worse than the last.   I'm a decent cook and can follow a recipe. I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong??? Could really use a good "italian" meatball recipe and just can't seem to get it right.

My family loved this. Did follows others suggestions using some parmesan in place of bread crumbs, used whole wheat bread crumbs. Also added oregano and salt/pepper to meatballs and used 28 ounce crushed tomatoes with 1 can 26 ounce traditional tomato sauce and used basil, oregano, and little splash triple sec (once suggested by a local italian restaurant owner in place of sugar). I also browned some sausage for my 8 y/o and added them and they all loved it, it really was such a great tasting dinner.

Good taste but a bit bland, I would add some salt to it. I also turned the heat up and added some crfushed red pepper flakes.

So good!  I made for Christmas eve dinner - it was a big hit.  I added Parmesan cheese to the meatballs, omitted the parsley but instead added dry Italian herbs.  To the sauce I added sugar and salt.  It turned out great.  Oh and I served it over polenta instead of pasta....YUM!

Love how easy this was... I used less breadcrumbs and they held together great. However be sure to spice up the sauce because it is very bland as written.

I love the ease of this recipe.  We did think it was pretty bland though.  Next time I'll spice it up with some extra italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and maybe some crushed red pepper.

Iâve given this recipe a high rating because itâs a great concept.  I never thought to do this and love to use the slow cooker.  Iâve been dieting for several months and I try to âslim downâ my favorite foods.  I used 1 LB of ground chicken breast (320 cal), Â½ lb ground chicken (340 cal. for some fat), 1 cup caramelized onions & garlic (67 cal), Â½ cup bread crumbs (240 cal), Â½ cup Parmesan cheese (216 cal), 1 large egg (74 cal) and seasonings (garlic powder, parsley, oregano & pepper).  Use the amounts of sauces and cooked the meatballs the same as listed.  I made about 19 meatballs (67 calories each meatball, sauce should be measured separately).  This was not oily and the meatballs were awesome over whole-wheat pasta.  Iâm sure the beef cooking in the sauce would give this great flavor but if you need a lower calorie / fat version, this truly is worth a try.

I thought the flavor of the meatballs and sauce was excellent, especially since the recipe wasn't that difficult to make. I substituted BBQ sauce for the worcesture sauce and liked the addition. My only change for next time would be to roll the meatballs in breadcrumbs before frying since mine broke apart.

I don't eat red meat, but my honey was a big fan of this.  I appreciated how simple it was to put together.  I added oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme and pepper.  Will make again.

This recipe was just 'okay.' It was not very flavorful- pretty bland, actually. I give it two stars only for the ease of preparation. My husband said "something is missing" and I have to agree. I will stick with my own meatball recipe. It takes longer, but tastes much better.

I made these after my boyfriend requested I make meatballs, with a few modifications. I cooked the meatballs in the oven for about 10 minutes so they wouldn't crumble. I added 1/4 C parmesean cheese to the meatballs. I used half the onion (super finely grated) in the meatballs and half in the sauce. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, as I didn't have a can of pureed tomatoes. I added a clove of garlic to the sauce, as well as some dried basil and powdered garlic, and snuck some super finely grated carrots in there too (gotta sneak veggies into my boyfriend's diet somehow, lol). I made some homemade grinder rolls to go with the meatballs, so my boyfriend and I enjoyed meatball grinders topped with mozzarella for dinner. He said the meatballs were awesome, but requested that I make them without the onions next time (got away with the carrots! yes!).

Boy am I glad I followed the advice of others to reduce the amount of bread crumbs! Next time I will reduce it even more. This was nice and easy, though, and with a few changes it can easily be 5 stars.

I made this recipe for dinner lastnight and believe me it was DELICIOUS! So rich, smooth, so YUMMY! I made some changes: put a little bit of green bell pepper and reduced the bread crumbs. So nice results, it reminds me of those Italian Restaurants where you can eat truly homemade pasta...Thanks for sharing, Monica

I make this all the time. I usually make the meatballs ahead of time,then freeze them. They stay together in the sauce better that way. The meatballs turn out very tender.

Sauce was excellent!  Used 2 large cans of Hunts Traditional tomato sauce, 1 can of Furmano's Italien crushed tomatoes, and 1 can of tomato paste. Also added a little dried basil and Italien seasoning, a can of mushrooms and a about a half cup of chopped onion.  The meatballs were a little bland.  I will add much more seasoning to them next time.  I also baked them (as others suggested) for 15 min at 350.  Didn't really make any difference b/c I used 93/7 beef (no grease).  I will just throw them in the sauce uncooked next time instead of browning ahead of time.  Overall, yummy.

Very good and easy recipe.  We substituted half the ground beef for Italian sausage to add some extra flavor.   We did bake the meatballs at 350 for 15 minutes before adding to crock pot which cut out most of grease some people had in the crock pot.

These meatballs were great!  Firm but not crunchy.  The bad part is that the sauce comes out very thin and we like a thick sauce.  As leftovers the meatballs make a great sandwich!

Very tasty and easy.  I used ground turkey (trying to watch calories and fat, plus it's cheaper), cut the breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup, and only used half an onion.  I only had plain breadcrumbs on hand, so I used a lot of spices, at least a teaspoon each of garlic salt, italian seasoning, basil, parsley, and pepper.  It still could have used more flavor, I think.  Next time, I think I'll use another clove of garlic, a shot of red wine, and maybe a little cayenne or fennel.   I only had spaghetti sauce on hand, so I used two large cans and it worked fine.  I didn't have any problem with the meatballs falling apart - I used the lowest setting on my crock pot and literally did not touch them for 9 hours.  Made them before work and came home to perfectly cooked meatballs and an easy dinner.  Very handy.

Very good. Instead of using jar sauce, I made them with Best Marinara Sauce Yet from this site. I did bake the meatballs for about 35mins before adding them to the slow cooker. Not greasy at all! Very, very good. I will make them again!

Exceptional meatballs and sauce!  My family loved it.  It was extremely easy, especially for a full-time worker.  I added garlic powder and basil to the sauce and used the large cans of crushed tomatoes and tomato paste because we like a lot of sauce with our spaghetti and it was great!  The meatballs were melt-in-your mouth good!  Thanks!

I made these yesterday and they were very good....My package of ground chuck was 2 lbs. and I didn't increase the rest of the ingredients...I did, as one reviewer suggested, used only 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs...They held together nicely...I got 21 meatballs...I, also, baked them at 350 for 20 min...Got rid of a lot of grease and that awful gray stuff that cooks out of meat...I used a can of stewed tomatoes, that I crushed up in my hands and a can of diced tomatoes as I did not have a can of pureed tomatoes...I also, added a cup of red wine to the sauce...I cooked them on high for an hour and 2 hours on low...This is the first time I have ever made meatballs in the sauce...I have made cocktail meatballs and Swedish meatballs...

This was really easy and was delicious. The only complaint I got was from my Italian husband who said that there needed to be more fat. Next time I'll just add a little olive oil. I also made the sauce at the same time.

This is the best meatballs ever. The sauce really works good, made just the way I like it. I turned my friends into making this version and they love it.

I'll have to vote this for my husband since he's the only meat eater in the house. He says wow and I say thanks for making me have to fiddle with the meat stuff as little as possible. I did take the little extra effort and sautee the onion and garlic and bake the meatballs for 15 minutes on 350. They held their shape beautifully. I used meaty Ragu as the jarred sauce and added a palmful of Italian seasonings to the sauce and my husband said the sauce was flavorful. Next time I'll fry up double the onion and garlic though and add half to the sauce for a little added flavor and texture. Thanks for a great husband pleasing recipe.

These meatballs were sooo yummy!!!  I browned them like other reviewers suggested but still the sauce came out greasy.  I skimmed the grease off and enjoyed!!  The next day I made meatball sandwiches and there were sooo good also!!

Cut WAY back on the bread crumbs.  For 3 lbs. of chuck, I used about 3/4 cup of crumbs.

This is a great recipe. I usually make the meatballs the night before and bake them like a previous reviewer suggested. They hold their shape in the slow cooker much better that way. I also add seasonings to taste: basil, bay leaves, etc. It's my opinion also that the amount of bread crumbs can be cut in half--the first time I made it my husband thought there was too much starch filling in the meatballs. Overall this is a great work night dinner combined with bagged salad and french bread.

These meatballs are so good. My four kids cheer when they know we are having them for dinner. I only made slight changes. I use the whole jar of spaghetti sauce, the whole can of crushed tomatoes and the whole can of tomato puree. Then I add some Italian seasoning. Cook the meatballs all day in the sauce. Plenty for a family of 6, we even have leftovers for my husband's lunch the next day.

The taste was excellent, but the meatballs did not keep their balled shape. I did halve the recipe, so maybe that doesn't work well.

This was a simple and tasty recipe. I would have rated it higher, but I was sightly disappointed that some of the meatballs did not hold their shape very well. (My technique, maybe?) Definitely an easy recipe to add your own flavor and/or flare to, if anyone complains that this is bland it is through their own fault. With the multitude of flavorful sauces out there (and homemade varieties as well) this is a wonderful recipe to "play" with and spice it up. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This sauce turned out great. The meatballs did fall apart after awhile so I'll try baking them prior to the crock-pot next time.

These were pretty good. I baked the meatballs for 15 min at 350 degrees. Many of the reviews mentioned that the sauce was bland,so I just used a jar of pasta sauce and a can of garlic diced tomotoes. I also added some seasonings. It turned out good.

I prefer jarred sausage and pepper sauce with the homemade meatballs. The meatballs need more seasoning. Update: I made meatballs in the slow cooker using 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb hot italian sausage, most of the other ingredients from this recipe, and my favorite jarred spaghetti sauce. I omitted the parsley, crushed tomatoes, and tomato puree. We liked these much better this way.

This was an easy meal to put together in the morning and then return to in the evening. Seemed to be lacking a bit of flavor, but tasty all the same. We served used them for meatball subs and then had the leftovers with pasta the following day.

Love this recipe, I do bake the meatballs before I put them in the slow cooker. I also used a jar and a half of a tomato sauce then I used hunt's chopped and roasted tomatoes with garlic and crushed tomatoes. I just serve with noodles and garlic bread and it's a yummy meal.

I was very disapointed with this recipe. The sauce was awful, the meatballs were only "okay." Even my husband (who loves 95% of anything) didn't like them much. This will NOT be made again in my home.

this recipe was so yummy and made my house smell just as yummy!   I just added tomotoe sauce, onion, garlic, and parmesan cheese to the sauce and otherwise, kept it the same.  I baked the meatballs (made of turkey) for 15 minuntes beforehand, and they didn't fall apart.  Definitely a sure win!

These were great! I added a bit of pamesan cheese & browned the meatballs a bit because I was going to be short on the time needed to cook them completely in the crock pot. I ended up wih 30 meatballs-layered them in the crock pot with prepared sauce. Toasted some rolls, covered with mozerella cheese & had awesome meatball subs! Definetly a keeper!

These turned out incredible.  Next time I will use a roasted garlic or pepper spaghetti sauce for added flavor instead of a traditional.  But they were still so good.  My meatballs fell apart just enough that my sauce was really meaty but I still had the giant meatballs.  Great recipe!

Adding to the glowing reviews here: this was simple to prepare and tasted fantastic! I added a little parmesan to the meatball mix and used diced tomatoes along with the sauce because I didn't have anything else on hand, but it was terrific.

I only give four stars because I used my own modifications. I used two cans of spaghetti sauce and two diced tomatos. I then added some diced onion, left out the parsley, and then seasoned it with different italian seasonings to my own taste. I also baked the meatballs in the oven for about 15 minutes before adding it to the slowcooker. My family raved over this recipe! My husband said it would be the perfect meal for entertaining company. Will use again!

while i think slow cooker meatballs are a great idea, these just didn't work out. i substituted fresh bread crumbs, added extra garlic and seasonings, used lean ground beef, and pre-baked the meatballs. these still turned out a to be an oily and mushy mess. i had to mush them up and just change it to a meat sauce because the texture turned out too soft. overall, great idea but poor execution. i will not be making these again.

This was pretty bland. The meatballs were good themselves, but the sauce was lacking something. I added brown sugar and worcestershire sauce which helped, but it was still missing something.

I par-bake the meatballs in the oven before putting in the slow cooker.  Very nice flavor to the sauce, but definately a heavy meal.

These are really great - I make them at least once a month.  The sauce is really tasty too.  The only thing I do differently is to cook them in the oven for about 15 minutes to take away some of the grease, like other reviewers suggested.

I was positive I was going to love these as I rolled the meatballs, just because all the ingredients seemed perfect.  They didn't exactly taste bad, but they were very mushy and a little tasteless.  Very easy to make, my husband loved them, but I won't make them again unless perhaps I pan fry them in advance for a little texture.  The sauce was pretty good, although I added quite a bit of extra spices and garlic.

I personally make way more than 16 meatballs using this recipe, but I make them on the small side.  Highly requested dish in our house!  I have to eliminate the garlic because I can't eat it, but these still turn out great.  And the leftovers make incredible meatball hoagies!

GREAT GREAT GREAT! I MADE MY OWN SAUCE FROM TOMATO SAUCE AND DICED TOMATOES AND GREEN PEPPERS. I ALSO DICED UP SOME GREEN PEPPERS AND PUT THEM IN THE MEATBALLS. REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!!! MEATBALLS WERE A LITTLE SOFT, BUT PERFECT AT THE SAME TIME.

I also cooked the meatballs in the oven for 15 mins before adding them to the crockpot.  They held together pretty well.  I did get a bit of burning on one of the sides of my crockpot which was a bit hard to clean up.  The taste was very good and my boyfriend loved the meatballs.  I'll probably continue to make this occasionally.

I baked the meatballs in the oven for 15 mins before adding them to the slow cooker.  I only had 2 fall apart out of 16. I think that is pretty good! The kids loved them and hubby raved about them, so they are a keeper!

These meatballs were so good!  Thank you, Hunnie 0913. My husband and kids just loved them!  The only changes I made were to reduce the amount of onion and bake them in the oven for 20 min. before adding them to the crockpot. That way some of the fat drains off and won't end up in the sauce. Speaking of the sauce, it was just ok.  I will use a different sauce recipe next time.

These are excellent! We usually put them on hoagies and have meatball sandwiches for lunch for the next few days.

I browned my meatballs before putting them in the slowcooker, in order to cook off some of the fat.  I bought tomatoe paste by accident, instead of tomatoe puree, so I mixed the paste with water.  They turned out great...everyone loved them.  This was the first time that I made spaghetti and meatball, but it definitely won't be the last!

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD.  I DIDN'T HAVE ANY TOMATO PUREE AND USED AN EXTRA CAN OF SPAGHETTI SAUCE. SO I THINK THE CONSISTENCEY WAS A LITTLE WATERY.  I WOULD MAKE AGAIN EXACTLY BY THE RECIPE.

A good basic meatball recipe.  Easy to make but be sure to use extra lean ground beef.  Next time I will probably add onions and celery, chopped fine, to enhance the flavor, but they are still good meatballs without the extras.
