Coconut and lemongrass are such a yummy combo, and this soup was no exception. I like it a little spicier so I used 3 1/2 tsp of green curry paste in place of the yellow here. I also added some sliced red pepper with the mushrooms and then some cilantro garnish to add some colour. Overall a good soup!
