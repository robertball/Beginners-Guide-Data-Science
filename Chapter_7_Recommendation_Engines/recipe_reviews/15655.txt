My husband and I both really liked this recipe, next time I will use a little less cream cheese-maybe 6 oz instead of 8.  It's a keeper!

This recipe was nice and easy. We like it both warm and cold. I doubled the creole seasoning to add more flavor. Next time I will boil my corn before adding seasonings. When you drain you loose most of your parsley and seasonings. We will definately have this regularly!

I made this as a side dish at Thanksgiving. It was very easy to make and everybody in my family loved it. We also preferred it warm though, as someone else before me mentioned it. When it's cold it's too hard because of the cream cheese. Also, I used canned corn, you save some time that way. Definetely will make it again.

My boyfriend and I loved this. I cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons and only used 5 oz of cream cheese. It was perfectly creamy and delicious. Also omitted the onions, so I just stuck the butter and cream cheese in the pot while the corn sat in the strainer, melted them, then mixed it all together. Thanks for the yummy side dish.

I wanted to like this, but the combination of all the ingredients just made this a really weird funky dish. It was edible, but not one of my favorites.

Fantastic recipe!  I made this for a side for a potluck Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it.  I more than doubled the recipe, and added bacon as a topping and increased the amount of creole seasoning, but changed nothing else.  It turned out incredible and I am making it again for the Christmas dinner that I am hosting.  This has replaced our green bean casserole!  I could eat this every day.  LOL!

Everyone love it!! I have been making it for years. The only things I change is I use Cajun instead of Creole and I add some some extra garlic to the actual corn mixture.. This is awesome cold or hot. =)

This was really great. I usually do not try many "heart unhealthy" recipes but I had the ingredients, our freezer died and we had to use up LOTS of veggies. We like it warm but I can see how chilled would be good, too. We don't care for creole so I didn't use the seasoning. Great with meatloaf and a spinach salad.

Nice side dish for oh-so-good chicken from this site. I added some sliced pickled jalapenos. I served mine warm, but will try it chilled tomorrow.

I was looking for something to spice up some plain frozen corn I had. I admit, I didn't make this receipe exactly, only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. But, by just adding frozen corn, vegetable cream cheese and some parsley, THIS WAS DELICIOUS! It came out so creamy. Next time I will use reduced fat cream cheese just to cut some calories out. It really didn't take much cream cheese (I used a 1/2 bag of frozen corn and only 2 ounces of cream cheese and it was very creamy. After defrosting the corn, I added the cream cheese and parsley and cooked it another minute or two, pausing it every 30-45 seconds to give it a stir. Cooked it all in the microwave in the serving dish. Easy cleanup!  Thanks for the receipe!

We thought this was very good, but I did tweak it a bit.  As others suggested, I did use more creole seasoning and less cream cheese.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and we ate it warm since I didn't have the time to chill it.  Made this for my husband and mother-in-law and they LOVED it.  Actually had to give her the recipe!  We will be making this again!

I liked this recipe but I did have to significantly reduce the cream cheese. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper, it really livened it up! My partner really enjoyed this dish, and he's hard to please!!

The flavor of this was good but it was waaaaay to rich for me - a couple small bites and I was done. The next day I added more corn to lessen the richness. We preferred it warmed up.

Great but I reduced the butter and cream cheese to half the amount called for in the recipe.  It was still fine and cut down some of the fat and calories.

This was a Thanksgiving side dish. Since there were more then 7 people, I doubled the recipe. I did keep in mind of others comments about cutting back on the cream cheese, so I used one 8oz package instead of two. Although this dish is really good, and one I will continue to make... definitely going to cut back a little more on the cream cheese.

Made this following the recipe exactly the first time and decided I would prefer less cream cheese and serving it warm. Made it again and there were no leftovers. My somewhat picky daughter (almost) licked the bowl clean.

Added more corn. Very good recipe, but 8oz of cream cheese to 16 oz of corn is simply too much. I also added a bit more creole seasoning, because I know my wife loves creole seasoning.

Very good, very easy.   I used a tablespoon of dried parsley and 2% milk, because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I  followed the recipe.  It was surprisingly tasty!  And I could make it with time to spare, and store in a travel-type casserole dish with an accompanying hot pack (Pyrex makes one, among others).  It stayed warm, and allowed stove space for the rest of the meal, Thanksgiving.   Yum.  Thank you!

My son made this delicious dish!  We cooked it all in one skillet and added bacon.  Half the cream cheese was plenty with a little milk to make the sauce.

This was sooo good! I used caned corn since that's what I had, and served warm which everyone loved. I'm not sure I would like to cold, but I don't even want to try since it was so good warm! This will be made again and again!

Just finished making this and ate it warm.  My BF reaallllly loved it.  I merely  loved it. ;)

I followed recipe (had to make my own creole spice), but did use a single pan.  I cooked corn first, with garlic and parsley,  turned it into serving bowl and then mixed in the creole spice and let it blend in via heat.  I then used the same sauce pan to saute onions.  Added corn back in  and cream cheese and let it cook a few minutes longer than 10 minutes since the pan is deeper than a frying pan.

We're looking forward to trying it chilled tomorrow!

(oh, and I skimped on the cream cheese as my container had only about 5 oz.....I think a full 8 oz would have been too much)

Thanks for the nice recipe, Mary!

My honey is so funny about the things that she eats. This recipe turned out to be delicious and she loved it! A friend of ours makes a corn dish that is corn on the cob that also has cream cheese and bacon, so this dish reminded us so much of it. In the process of making this dish I also learned how to make my own Creole seasoning. I didn't have Creole seasoning, but I had everything in the cabinet to make it. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for my family and everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe and we had no left overs.  I would definately make this again.

Good, not great.  Needs some adjustments in my opinion.  Less butter and cream cheese, more parsley and creole seasonjng.  I did red onion to give it a little more color as well.

Used leftover corn from Thanksgiving and it was yummy! I put a few handfuls of shredded cheese in it and on it then baked it until the shredded cheese melted. The flavor of the onion, garlic and parsley were excellent! I also added some jalapeño juice for a kick. Will definitely make this again!

Really tasty recipe and I like the crunch of the corn once it's chilled & gets cold! I too use Cajun seasoning instead of Creole b/c it's something I keep on hand in my pantry.  Highly recommend...especially in the summer when corn on the cob is in abundance - just cut it off the cob for a nice delicious alternative treat :)

Great recipe! Quick, easy and had the ingredients to feed an unexpected house full of teenagers.  You just never know what they will eat, but got rave reviews all around.  Now they all want to eat here all the time!!  Gave 4 stars simply for the fat content, but with a few adjustments that can be reduced.  Thinking of trying this with peas next time.

This recipe is great!  I make this for holiday gatherings with family and everyone loves it.  I make for everyday dinners too.  It's too spicy for the kids, so I usually set some aside for them before adding the creole seasoning. I do add more seasoning than suggested and a lot less cream cheese, about 4oz. I have found though that serving it warm is quite good and we actually prefer it that way.  Works with canned unsalted corn too(saves time)!

Great taste, but i cooked it on high for 3 hours and it got burned, I would suggest cooking for 2 hours on high or 4 on low.

Loved it. The only change I would make is to add more creole seasoning!

Add jalapenos for some added kick!
