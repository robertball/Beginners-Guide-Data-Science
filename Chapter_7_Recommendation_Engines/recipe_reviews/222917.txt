For my taste, this recipe definitely needs some sweetener in it. I too used unsweetened almond milk but added a good bit of stevia.

I used almond milk because that's what I keep on hand. I found it rather bland. I added a banana which made it a lot better because it sweetened it a little. I think this could be a good base for creating smoothies. There are a lot of ingredients that would go well in this.

I really enjoyed this drink. I agreed with a fellow reviewer about adding a bit of sweetness. I added a little of stevia . Highly recommended if you enjoy matcha .

I love that this recipe is so healthy! (I made mine even healthier by using unsweetened almond milk.)  I was also attracted to this recipe because it doesn't require any ice cream/froyo, which I didn't have on hand.  That being said.... the lack of frozen ingredients makes this shake pretty liquidy and flat - even if you use 6 ice cubes like I did.  It's fine as a beverage, but nothing like the milkshake consistency I was hoping for.  If you want a green tea milkshake/smoothie rather than a green tea drink, I think you do need to use ice cream or froyo.  Alternatively, maybe you could make this drink, put it in an ice cube tray, and then blend the frozen cubes?  I might try that next time. Also, I'd recommend adding some sweetener (not much - I just used 2 tsp agave nectar) to this recipe, unless you used sweetened milk of some kind.
