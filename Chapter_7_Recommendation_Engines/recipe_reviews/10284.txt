I've used this recipe several times now, and have loved it every time.  Try throwing in more than just chocolate chips and dates  (butterscotch or peanut butter chips and raisins or other dried fruit).  I've yet to discover a new ingredient that didn't work well!

These were great! Just a few changes... used rice krispies instead of corn flakes (didn't have any) and butter instead of shortening. Also did not use dates. Pecans made them awesome. They went straight to the oven like drop cookies (not slice fridge ones). Enjoy!! I made these a second time w/o the oats and they came out flat, so I'd make sure you have oats. Cook at a LOWER TEMP, I did 325/350 degrees and cooked until the top no longer shines - much better. FYI

The taste of these cookies is so familiar.. I'm not sure why, but I'm thinking of junior high cooking class. :) I didn't have dates, and although I thought of substituting Craisins, I decided to just omit that ingredient. I did a half-batch, and used margarine. My mixer could handle blending all the ingredients, although the corn flakes got well-crushed (which was fine, no lumpy hard bits to bite through!). Only problem was that they really flattened out.. Tasted great (both the dough and the cookies!), and the flatness didn't bug me. In the future, I'll probably use ½ baking soda and ½ baking powder (I do that change in most cookie recipes for softer, thicker cookies), and I might try these as drop cookies next time. I WILL make these again! Thanks, lrawlins!

Still refrigerating dough rolls. Going to leave refrig rolls overnight.  Dough was quite soft & sticky forming into a roll, but my kitchen was quite warm. Used margarine. Added 1 C chopped walnuts.  Tried pre-toasting the walnuts and oats in 400F oven 8-10 min. Added 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, my taste preference.  Otherwise rest same as recipe.  Can't wait to bake.

YUM! I used margarine instead of butter to make them chewy, and I used Raisin Bran intead of frosted flakes and then used 1/2 cup of raisins instead of the 1 cup of dates. I didn't find them to be flat like another reviewer, so I'll stick with the baking soda.

Very good. I made it with butter because i didnt have shortening, and i used 3/4 cup of each sugar. I added coconut and almond extract, they turned oit awesome.
