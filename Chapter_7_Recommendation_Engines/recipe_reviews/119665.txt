Really good! I did as others suggested and sauteed onions, garlic and then zucchini pulp in evoo.  I also added some leftover gound turkey, about 1/2 cup. Then used a little crushed stuffing mix so I could cut back on powdery dry breadcrumbs.  Even if I didn't have the ground turkey, I would definately make again.  Thanks!

Excellent!  Oh, how I enjoyed this!  Tons more flavor than I ever expected and I had no problem at all finishing this up to the last crumb.  Since other reviewers recommended it and I knew it couldn’t hurt, I briefly sautéed the chopped zucchini pulp in a skillet along with some chopped onion and the garlic.  I used fresh, red-ripe, juicy tomatoes, so the chicken broth wasn’t even necessary (didn’t want to open a carton for just a couple of tablespoons).  Such wonderful and bold flavor, and I can’t help but think that crumbs made from “Italian Cheese Bread,” also from this site, played a significant role in that since it was already seasoned with herbs and cheese.  As if it wasn’t good enough on its own (and I say it would have been) I couldn’t resist adding some shredded mozzarella cheese, which took this to an even higher level of incredible deliciousness.  I have loved zucchini all my life, but zucchini never tasted as good as it did tonight.

We had an explosion of zucchini and summer squash this year and needed to do something with it. After trying htis recipe and loving it, I tried freezing the individual Boats with stuffing wrapped in tin foil and put in zip-lock bags. I defrosted them and stuck them in the oven to finish cooking- it was wonderful!! I froze a bunch more and are keeping for the wonter and gave them to friends and family. Thanks for the recipe!

For sure a 5+ star recipe.  This is now our favorite way to eat zucchini.  With the abundance of zucchini from our garden this year, I have made many different kinds of zucchini boats; some with bacon, some with sausage, some with meatloaf.  I had looked at this recipe many times, and it just didn't seem like it would have as much flavor as the others.  But, after reading Naples' review, I knew I had to try it.  I have to totally agree with her, this is an awesome, flavorful way to eat zucchini.  I actually made my kids something else for dinner on this particular night and scaled this recipe to 2 for just my husband and myself.  The kids tried it and asked for more, but neither my husband nor I wanted to share.  Followed the recipe, but threw some extra cheese on the top.  Still have zucchini coming out of the garden, so I know that I'll be making these again soon.

These turned out too moist for my liking - I think if I were to make them again I would omit the stock and maybe even add more breadcrumbs.  Flavor was pretty good tho I will take others' advice and sautee the pulp with some onion next time.

These were great. I love this new way of cooking zucchini! My only complaint was the texture of the cheese. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese, but it turned out leathery. Next time, I think I'll opt for a softer cheese, like a fresh mozzarella.

I have made stuffed zucchini for many years. I cut the squash as shown, but steam them  in a deep frying pan until "tender" but not mushy. Then I scoop out the pulp and mix it with a rice/hamburg mixture to which I have added parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, chopped onion and an egg to bind it together. Pour a small amount of olive oil on the bottom of a baking dish, place the stuffed zuchchini on top and sprinkle with panko bread crumbs. Bake until the bread crumbs are slighly browned. Your squash is essentially cooked at this point so it does not take long. I do not measure when cooking, so I can't give exact measurements.

We always have more zucchini then we know what to do with , and are always looking for new ways to make use of it! I used a whole pound of sausage, and instead of parsley I used thyme! Omitted the butter also like another user had said. I also sautéed the onions, garlic and pulp together along with the tomatoes  My husband is a huge meat fan so with out it I am sure he would have complained. I plan on trying this recipe with out the meat next time

I decided to try this recipe, though it's similar to what I grew up making. I didn't remember any measurements and thought it would be a good base recipe. Like others, I sauteed 1/2 a lg onion with some garlic in a barely-oiled pan, but did not pre-cook the pulp, just chopped it real fine. Once it was mixed with the onions, tomato, and parm, I thought 2c. of bread crumbs seemed excessive, so I only used 1c., 1 egg, and 1/2c. veg bouillon instead of chicken broth. I sprayed the pan with olive oil pan spray which worked fine. It seemed to take forever to cook, though. After 30 mins I upped the temp to 375 and cooked them for another 10-15 mins. It was delicious, but I think I'd like it even more with less bread crumbs. Maybe my zucchini weren't considered medium, but small? I really had to pile on the stuffing! Haha, Overall, a very yummy recipe and I'll definitely make again with some adjustments.

I have never been fond of zucchini however I really enjoyed this recipe.  As another reviewer suggested I sautéed the pulp with a little fresh garlic and onion and instead of using tomatoes I used a little mild chunky salsa because it was all I had on hand.  Very good and it got me to eat zucchini.

Most of us thought this was good. I however, didn't like the texture of the filling. I will try as someone suggested more cheese and less bread.
Will make again!

i know a recipe that uses the same technic but with avocado. So instead of using parmasean cheese i used goat cheese, pine nuts,No chicken broth. No butter. I just mixed everything fresh and then put it in the oven for 5 minutes. at the end i put a small topping of warm roasted spicy red peppers. YUM! My whole family loved this!!!!

Very, very good recipe, and a great use of zucchini.  As others suggested, I will saute onions and garlic beforehand to add to the mixture.  I will also use more parmesan cheese and less breadcrumbs, since the cheese didn't come through in the flavors.  However, this makes a wonderful summer side dish and is a great way to use up those abundant zucchini.  Thanks for posting it!

Absolutely delicious, and filling enough (for me, anyway) for dinner! The only change I made was to increase the garlic (can't get enough of it) and sauteing some onions in olive oil, then adding the tomatoes zucchini pulp, and spices.  Once that mix cooled down I added the bread crumbs, egg, and parmesan. This is especially good if you have a lot of zucchini to use up from your garden. Highly recommended, thanks for sharing!

Very yummy!  I sadly had to scale this recipe down to only one zucchini as that was all I had left in my fridge :(  I found this recipe today and had to try it!  I did saute the pulp along with the garlic as other users noted and ended up leaving out the broth only due to needing so little once scaled down.  I also only used a couple of teaspoons from my carton of egg whites as a full egg would clearly have been too much!  After all was said and done, I inadvertently left off the butter drizzled over top, but no matter, these were gobbled up by hubby and I and the butter was not missed (saves some calories too)!!

I went to visit my parents for a few days and brought my mom a zucchini from our garden. She sifted through the recipes and paired this with shrimp pasta. We really liked it. I think she added more seasoning and cheese. They were great and I'll make them for us now.

This was just what I was looking for. Did not use chicken broth. the juice from the tomato was enough. I grilled the zucchini first instead of blanching it. I  also mixed a little grated mozzarella in before I stuffed them, and then topped them with more instead of drizzling with butter before baking. Huge hit! They got Devoured!

Loved these boats....so easy. I did not cook the zucchini boats in salted water....I baked them at 375 while I prepared the stuffing. I also cooked my stuffing....the zucchini pulp, garlic, onion, I added a diced red pepper, and baby bella mshrooms and some fresh basil. I cooked these veggies down a bit first then added the crumbs, cheese, and eggs. Stuffed the boats and added a sprinkle more of crumbs and pecorino romano cheese on top. These are delcious and you can really add what you like to it....maybe next time some crumbled cooked sausage. Thanks!

This was absolutely amazing!  Next time I might do a little less broth and a little more bread crumbs.  I did double the garlic because we are huge garlic lovers

Super yummy!  I followed the suggestions of previous posters and sauteed the veggies in olive oil before mashing and mixing with breadcrumbs, spices, cheese, etc.

I made this and I used Italian bread crumbs I think it would be better with plain bread crumbs as the spice in the Italian bread crumbs was overpowering to the zucchini and I did not see where it said to add onions?

I have made these twice now.  The first time as a side dish to go with baked chicken, the 2nd time as the meal themselves.  I did follow some other reviewers advice and sauted the scooped out squash with onion and garlic.  These are really really good.  I added ground pork to the 2nd time.  That really made it a full meal.  My boyfriend doesn't like squash much, but he loved these.  He wants me to cook squash like that more often.  I'm slowly getting him to eat his veggies.

I thought this was great! I can't wait to make this in the summer with fresh zukes and tomatos from the garden. I omitted the butter, found it to be unnecessary.

Delicious, but VERY rich. I might help prevent it from being too rich next time by increasing the proportion of zucchini in the stuffing.
