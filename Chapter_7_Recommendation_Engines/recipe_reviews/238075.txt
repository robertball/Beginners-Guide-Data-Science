This is absolutely delicious and so easy. I did the peaches exactly according to the recipe (except I used butter instead of margarine). I changed the dumpling recipe slightly since I had never seen a fluffy dumpling recipe with cut in shortening and I was afraid the texture would be more like biscuits than dumplings. I used my mother's recipe which is similar except it calls for breaking two eggs into a measuring cup and filling with milk to make one cup instead of cutting in butter. I will try again with apples and maybe blueberries. Wonderful flavor.

My husband really liked the dumplings but I used 50% less sugar than it called for and butter instead of margarine. It was very good.

Excellent! I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes. A nice change from the traditional peach cobbler
