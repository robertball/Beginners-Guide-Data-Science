I used this recipe for my first roast and have used it religiously since.  My only advice would be to watch your cooking time.  My roasts have always been done between 5-6 hours (on low) and they come out very tender.  Overall, a very easy and tasteful recipe.

I did add some garlic powder for flavor. I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon cubes and used more carrot and potatoes than called for (I used small red potatoes cut into half). I also used low sodium mushroom soup. I would like to add that different slow cookers work at different temperatures. I have two slow cookers and one cooks at a MUCH higher temperature on both low and high setting than the other.  I would keep this in mind when setting up your cooking times. The lady that wrote this recipe has a cooker that will either be slower or faster than the one you have. As for the finished product.... Mine was outstanding! I let each person added salt and pepper to their own taste after it was cooked... It's much easier to control the amount of salt and pepper at the table than to guess how much it will take when you start cooking. After cooking on low for nine hours, my roast (2.8 pounds) was so tender I could cut it with a fork. Both my wife and I commented how tasty it turned out. This is an easy and very tasty recipe for pot roast and I recommend anyone likes a good pot roast!

I don't know what some of these people are talking about - this was a great roast! You may want to add some more spices, but that's not rocket science. I added a litte bit of garlic, a sprinkle of garlic salt, ground pepper and extra onion flakes. My boyfriend and I loved it - it was a nice brown color, and the aroma filled the house when I came home. I will be using this recipe over and over.

This is good made as directed, but I felt it needed a little more flavor / complexity.  I use a larger roast (5 lbs) rubbed with salt, pepper, garlic, dredged in flour (to thicken the gravy later) and seared in olive oil.  For the liquid... beef broth, and I add a few big splashes of red wine (about half a cup).  Also put in onion, fresh minced garlic, a couple of rosemary sprigs and a tsp of coriander seeds.  Cooked carrots with the roast, but potatoes separately (roasted potatoes, as I don't like everything to taste the same or to be too mushy.)  YUMMO!

This has to be the easiest way to make pot roast.  I will brown my meat before placing in the crock pot and the deglaze the pan with the beef broth.  After I take all the meat and vegetables out I will thicken the gravy with a little corn starch and water.  It is every bit as good as a roast cooked in the oven.

Wow harsh review, I think there may have been something wrong with your cooker or something because I cant imagine the veggies being raw after hours and hours of slow cooking, but hope you find the recipe your looking for! As far as my experience with the recipe, I tweaked it a little for my own taste. I used broth instead of buillion and water, and I used a lot of it because I love the soupy gravy. I added the potatoes in half way through cooking so they wouldnt be mush,  they were perfect! Added probably more veggies than recommended and some extra seasoning (garlic, tonys). But overall I just loved it! thanks for the recipe!

My first time using a slow cooker and this turned out fantastic! I cooked a 2-1/2 lb roast for 5 hours on high, stirring twice to make sure the beef bouillons were mixed in evenly (I used Maggi brand). Beforehand, I made slits in the roast and put in slices of garlic, then browned the roast on all sides before putting it in the slow cooker. I also added a bay leaf, ground pepper and 2/3 cups water and wished I added more because the "juice" was so good! Perfect for soaking up with freshly baked bread!

This was my first pot roast ever and I was pretty apprehensive... but it turned out great!  I prepared it according to the directions with the following modifications: I sliced 3 carrots instead of using baby carrots, replaced the onion with a package of dry onion soup mix, and used 3/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup.  I cooked it on low for a little over 8 hours.  The meat was so tender and so full of flavor.  Plus, it passed the ultimate test: my husband loved it and even had seconds!  Next time I'm going to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to make a thicker gravy.  Great recipe!

Using the Advice from the previous reviews i added the xtra 1/4 cup of water, bay leaf, and also browned it before putting in the crock......It turned out very nicely and my inlaws thought it was delicious!!! I made gravy from the crock pot juices by adding flour, salt, pepper and some onion powder all to taste.........YUM!!!!

This was an incredible recipe.  It pulled apart, the vegetables were not mushy and the gravy was so good.  My boyfriend ate the baby carrots (he hates carrots) and even wanted to take it to work the next day! Here is what I did the night before...I cut the potatoes, onions and used baby carrots.  I heavily seasoned them with garlic salt, seasoning salt, pepper and Lipton onion soup mix and put it at the bottom of my crock pot. (I have a removable dish.)  I seasoned the outside of the roast with garlic salt, seasoning salt and pepper until it was completely covered with seasoning and browned the outside with some butter.  I dissolved the 3 beef boullion cubes with one cup of boiling water and added it to the top of the veggies and then I put the roast on top of that and covered it with the top.  I stuck the whole thing in the frig to marinate over night.  The next morning I just took it out of the frig, plop the dish in and turn on the crock pot for 8 hours on low.  FANTASTIC..my bestfriend and my boyfriend were raving about it! I'm making it for Thanksgiving in addition to the turkey. :)

From someone (me) who's recipes normally turn out terrible, this was TRULY the easiest, best tasting roast I have ever made!!  I followed the suggestions of others, and flavored it with additional spices to fit our tastes and added some additional water, and it was simply wonderful!!

This was very easy, and was exactly what I was looking for... I over cooked mine so it was a little dry and put too much beef bullion in so it was a bit salty, but if I wasn't contending with that it would definitely be 4 stars!  Adding to my recipe box now...

This is a classic Crock Pot - Pot Roast recipe.  If you read the instructions with a Crock Pot, it always says to put the vegetables on the bottom - they take the longest to cook.  I have NEVER browned my roast before cooking.    I would venture to guess that if your roast did not turn out with this recipe - it had more to do with the grade of meat you used than the recipe.   One other hint - always use a recipe as a base - then add the seasonings that you and your family enjoy.

Suprisingly very good. I added 2 c water, 1/4 c red cooking wine, 1 T onion powder, 1 T minced garlic, 1/4 tsp garlic pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic and herb grill mate. Plus, I used 6 potatoes and about 2 c carrots.

I decided to make a pot roast for Christmas dinner, so I went searching for slow cooker recipes.  Almost everything I came across called for dry onion soup mix which I did not have.  Then I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  It came out perfect!!  I didn't have any celery and used regular carrots instead of baby, but everything else was the same.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  I cooked my roast on high for 5 hours and it came out super tender and the taste was spectacular.  I will only be making my roast this way from now on.

Yummy!  I cut my roast in half just in case it wasn't a good recipe and I was so sad, because I wished I had cooked the whole thing!  My son loved it and had seconds.  I added more water than called for and added seasonings that I enjoy.  I also (at the end) added some cornstarch to thicken the juice into gravy.  It was very delicious.

Pretty good, but made some changes and it went over well at a dinner party.  Used 1 packet of onion soup powder and 1 can of beef broth instead of the bouillon cubes and water.  Rubbed the roast with salt, pepper, thyme.  Cut slits into the roast and inserted minced garlic.

a great, easy way to make pot roast. This is how I make my roasts every time. If you can, don't put the potatoes in until halfway through the cooking time. If you leave them in the entire time, they'll turn to mush.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I used Beef Eye of Round Roast and left the celery whole (that way I could remove it before serving since some of my guests don't like the texture). The scent filled our kitchen and was pleasing to everyone! It will definitely be used again and again!!

Gets my highest vote for ease and yum factor. I love garlic & added quite a bit. I cooked this for approx 10 hours on low. Put it in the fridge overnight. I think things cooked in the crock-pot taste better warmed up the next day. It was delish. Thanks!

This was by far the best pot roast I've ever made, and it was quite easy to do.  Much better than anything my mother ever made.  I made  one change, though, and I HIGHLY recommend it.  My wife doesn't like celery, so in lieu of that, I used a large stalk & root of fennel. The results were spectacular.  The texture remains somewhat close to celery, but it infuses the whole dish with a light anise flavor.  Great dish, easy to make... don't forget the fennel.

Great recipe!! My husband loved and so did I. I used 2 cubes, 1 packaged dry onion soup, potatoes, carrots and onions. I put about 1-1/12 cups of water. The meat was melting and it felt I was cutting butter. I wasn't even able to get it out of the crockpot to cut because it was falling apart. Perfect. Thank you so much!!

We did not like this roast at all.  I put in all my ingredients as the recipe says and then put in the 1/2 cup of water.  I knew as soon as I poured it in that it wasn't going to be enough liquid but I let it go anyways, trusting everyone elses reviews.  I was so disappointed when I got home and found my roast still sitting on top of the potatoes, not liquid around it.  I ended up adding 3 cups of water and 3 more bullion cubes, just for some "juice".  I will not be making this again. :(

I use beef broth and fresh green beans instead of celery.  Even with different cuts of roast, it always turns out hearty and satisfying, whether we eat it with gravy or in a pot pie.  Very easy, nutritious meal.  I like to add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to my roast and some worcestshire sauce to the broth/water.

First pot roast that I've tasted in years that was this delicious!  I took the advice about the wine and the broth rather than bouillon.  All loved it:)

Very good. I put in potatoes, carrots and celery and it turned out very well. I did have to cook mine almost 6 hours on high. Depends on your crock pot

I added 1/2 cup red wine and beef broth instead of the water.  Also added a bay leaf and browned the roast before I put it in the crock pot.   Added peas last hour of cooking because we love peas!  Enjoy.

Was a good recipe.  But I added the 3 cloves of garlic, used the Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of the bullion.  Also added the water & a cup or 2 of red wine.  Added mushrooms, celery, & carrots in the last couple of hours.  Cooked 1 hour on high & about 5.5 on low.

This is basically the recipe I've used for years and you can't beat it.  For those of you thinking there should be more flavor try adding 1/2 to 1 packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix.  I usually use beef broth instead of bouillon cubes.  The juices make an excellent gravy.  What really bothers me on these roast beef recipes is it is rarely mentioned which cut of beef is used.  I stick with a chuck roast as I can depend on it being fall apart tender and having a rich flavor.  I've never had much luck with rump roasts (not sure what they call them today) and don't know how that would work in a recipe like this even though it's in slow cooker.

Easy and AMAZING!  I didn't add the potatoes (made mashed potatoes instead), added 2 bay leaves, a sprinkle of garlic powder, and upped the water to 1 cup.  Once finished cooking, I used the cooking liquid to make gravy.  Adding this to the weekly rotation!

My pot roast turned out drier than expected. I used the 3/4 c. of water that was suggested in the reviews, but it was still dry. I think part of the problem is that I set the meat on top of the veg like it said to do, and that prevented the meat from being immersed in the liquid. Next time I will set the meat in the pot and put the veg around it, and I also won't put the potatoes in until a few hours into cooking b/c they were totally obliterated. I added a small amount of dry onion soup mix as suggested as well. The taste was great, it was just too dry.

I just read all the reviews for this recipe.  The people who gave it a low rating must not know how to tweak a recipe. For the potatoes I used small red ones cut in half. I don't use bullion cubes, I use "Herb Ox" Instant bullion powder - 1 tsp per cup of water.  Before I brown the meat I dredge it in flour mixed with rosemary, sea salt, pepper and granulated garlic - that slowly thickens as it cooks to make the gravy.  Again the amounts of the spices depends on your taste buds.  Lastly, I cook it 1 hour on high and 6 - 8 hours on low testing the veggies after 6 hours.  For an added kick put a 12 oz bottle of "Killian's Irish Red" beer in after 4 hours on low.  The beer has plenty of time to loose the alcohol that way but you still have the flavor of the Killian's. This recipe is a great one it all comes down to personal preference and taste buds.

This was good for my first roast. It ended up very tender and pulled apart easily. I will add the veggies later next time as they ended up being mush and add some more spices as well. This recipe is excellent to try again and again until you have it tweaked to your liking! I am giving this recipe a solid 4 stars for coming out moist and tender but not 5 stars as the veggies came out way overcooked and it was a little on the bland side spice wise. A great basic roast recipe!

This was the most disgusting roast I have ever had.  I don't know how these people have given it a four star rating.  It was like eating boiled shoe leather with virtually raw veggies thrown in.  I'm a huge fan of roasts normally, but I wouldn't feed this to my worst enemy.  Yuck!!!!!

This really is the easiest thing I've ever made and one of the best.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of bouillon, added some minced garlic and Worcestershire sauce for flavor and it was wonderful.

I did everything as instructed.. I am sorry but this is not good at all.  I gave it one star because the meat and vegetables were tender but the boullion taste was overwhelming and there is no real substanance to the gravy.. just watery, fatty.

This was really good. I put the veggies on top of the meat because I like the meat to be falling apart tender. I made it both ways (veggies on top and bottom of meat) and I prefer veggies on top.

This was a great dinner to come home to tonight, it's cold and rainy out. The meat came out very tender and very flavorful. I've been using the McCormick seasoning for pot roasts, and those are pretty good but wanted to try something different and didn't want to worry about preservitives or additives in seasonings. Thanks for the great recipe!

The flavor was good but my roast came out very dry. I think the roast should be browned first, putting it in the crock pot raw made the veggies on the bottom look gray and almost unappetizing. Then having the beef cubes on top made dark spots on the roast. It tasted better than it looked. I think I will keep looking for a crock pot roast recipe.

This is an easy, standard roast beef recipe.  You should spice it up however you want.  One note for me, though, I cook this on low for 12 hours and do not need to add additional liquid and it turns out tender and perfect.

Cook this roast on high for at least 6 hours, cooking it on low dries the meat out quite a bit.  We didn't find it bland at all.  I would have to try the suggestion of browning it first for a more asthetic appeal.

Very good.  I placed veggies on top of roast.  Added more water than called for, and used flour to turn into a gravy.  I also placed a bay leaf into crock pot while cooking.  Thought maybe it needed a little more flavor, but overrall very tasty.  I will make this again.

I am not sure what happened, but I followed it to the T and it was bland and dry.This is the first highly rated recipe from this site that did not live up to the reviews. I have a new crock pot, so that wasn't the issue. Won't make again.

This is very good.  Instead of water I used beef stock mixed with a packet of seasoning mix for pot roast for flavor.  I also browned the beef and cut slits in the roast and filled with garlic as someone suggested before adding in the pot.

Super easy, but I found that all of the ingredients wouldn't actually fit in my crock pot. So, I had to take several large spoonfuls of the potatoes and carrots out to fit in all the meat. I'm not a huge red meat fan, so I don't think I would make this all the time. But for a pot roast, it was pretty good.

I made my first pot roast yesterday and decided to add a heaping TBSP of horseradish mustard AND some dill weed. OMG! It turned out so good! I seared the meat, then put it aside. I then started the broth and vegies on the stove in a dutch oven and as soon as it was simmering, I put the roast in and shoved it to the bottom. Cooked in the oven for 2 hours at 350, then 1 hour at 250...YUM!!!

This was my 1st pot roast and it was fabulous! My husband was completely impressed! I followed the recipe almost exactly, only I seared the beef (adding salt & pepper) before I put it in the crock pot and I added mushrooms and smashed whole clove garlic. So easy!

Very good an easy.  We used 2 cans of beef broth instead of the bouillon and water and added many garlic cloves.  Also, add more veggies if you like them.

Great recipe!  I used a rib roast and here's how I tweaked it:  I added a garlic and rosemary rub, a bay leaf, and used beef broth instead of cubes.  From my experience with my crockpot, I always use yellow flesh potatoes and cut any veggies into LARGE chunks (double or triple the size that I use when boiling or roasting).  This keeps the veggies from getting too mushy after 6 hours of cooking.  I cooked on low for 6 hours and everything turned out good, but next time I'll check it after 5.5 hours because the roast seemed a tiny bit over done.

This recipe is very easy and very good. I did not use celery - I didn't have any. I added salt and pepper, and used liquid bouillon concentrate instead of cubes, because that's what I had on hand. I cooked in on high and it was done in less than four hours. This is the best way to cook a roast.

This recipe turned out great!  I made a few minor adjustments to it such as; i used beef broth, cream of mushroom soup, and dry onion soup mix.  This was my first time making pot roast ever & it worked out well!!

Very Good! I used less onion, added garlic powder and used 1 cup of water instead of 1/2cup. This was my first pot roast so I was really nervous...but it turned out great. My husband and I loved it!

Very Easy to make!! It had good flavors but I also added garlic, pepper, salt,  and a little red wine. I used 2 cups of water and this helped keep the meat tender. 
This is my first time making it in the crock pot, so I changed the cooking times a little. I just watched it and took it out at about 6 hours on low and cooking the last hour on high. 
It was very easy and yummy!

This was definitely easy.  I made the following modifications according to what I had on hand:  2 lbs roast, 3 carrots, 1 celery stick & 4 potatoes.  I let mine cook for 4 hours, but it was quite dry.  This was my first roast, so I was leery of calling it done early; but I think it was done after 3 1/2 hours.

I added a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the 1/2 cup of water and turned the meat frequently.  It added great flavor.  I omitted the celery(hate it with roast) and also the boullion (who needs it with the Lipton Onion Soup Mix?).  Used red bliss potatoes.  Easy.  Good.  Pretty standard way to make roast in a crock pot.

Very basic pot roast recipe. Having read the other reviews that said "bland," first I rubbed the meat with salt, pepper, and thyme. I also added garlic, sugar, worcestershire sauce along with veggies and seasonings. Finally I thickened the gravy with corn starch. Using the good quality of meat, this recipe got good reviews from my family.

I have usually ruined roast beef, thus have not tried very many roast recipes.  This was very easy and was really tender and tasty.  My husband really liked this. I had some left over onion soup mix already mixed with water in the fridge so used that and used only two boullion cubes. I strained the dried onions from the soup mix and used an onion as per the recipe. I also sprinkled a little majoram over the meat. I used more water as others have suggested (little more than a cup including liquid from soup mix) and had lots of delicious gravy.  Next time I will try using a little corn starch to thicken it.

This was an amazing recipe! I have butchered many-a-roast, but this one was so simple, and turned out to be the best I have had yet! I also stabed random holes in the meat before cooking, and filled them with garlic. Thanks for sharing this recipe! My whole family thanks you! :o)

This pot roast just wasn't that great.  The roast was done far earlier than expected and before the vegetables were ready.  The laying of bullion cubes on the roast left areas with heavy seasoning and some with little.  The roast itself was very dry.

If I were to use this recipe again, I would start the vegetables earlier, and rub a light coating of beef bullion all over the roast and then add an hour after the vegetables were started.

If you have the time this receipe is ever better if you brown the meat first and add some more seasoning, like a bay leaf.

This is a terrific, easy-to-do recipe for pot roast. I love the simplicity, particularly for my college-age daughters and parents who are rushing out the door to work in the morning. While I appreciate the many "reviews" of the recipe, in fact most folks are completely rewriting the recipe. One of the "most helpful critical reviews" adds nine additional ingredients! That's not a review, that's another recipe altogether! Submit it as such, please!

Very easy but standard fair.  Adding garlic and red wine as suggested by other reviewers is definitely recommended.  I also added a few splashes of low sodium soy sauce which enhances the color as well as flavor.

My boyfriend gave this a 5, but I'm giving it a 4 since I felt like something was lacking, regarding flavor.  Also, the pot roast was a little dry, so I feel like there should have been more water in the recipe.

Very easy to make, I used garlic powder,italian seasoning salt and pepper and it was perfect..also you should use 1 cup of water. Even with a 3 pound chuck roast it needed more water than a half cup. Very easy..very good. will make again.,

Overall, it's a very good tasting roast...especially being so easy to prepare! I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it really was lacking spices (in addition to the bouillon, I also used garlic powder, bay leaves, whole peppercorns, vegeta, and rubbed on a little bit of Mrs. Dash garlic & herbs sprinkle) and also because I think it needs about 4 times as much water as stated..Mine came out a little dry, but I blame myself for not watching it often enough (my first time using my mother's slow-cooker. I guess hers cooks faster).

Good Recipe, If you add 3/4 of a can of coca cola it is a great Recipe. Except for the yellow corn. no where does it say open can and put in shallow pan on low heat. I don't get the corn thing. The coca cola trick is from grandma Bessie. She made excellent pot Roast.

The reason I gave this 4 stars is b/c I had to add A LOT of seasoning to get it to taste how I wanted.  I did fresh rosemary, salt, season salt, pepper and about 1/4 cup lea and perrins.  Next time I would also sear it first to lock the juices in.  It got a little dry at 7 hours.

Excellent.  I followed directions exactly until I added 15 crushed ginger snaps an hour before it was done. It thickens the gravy and tastes awesome.

Turned out great, I seared the roast and added a little minced garlic and more water.  Next time I will try the beef broth instead.

This was so easy and so good. I made this on my lunch break and it was ready to eat when I got home! I used 1 cup beef broth instead of the water. I also rubbed some salt, pepper, garlic salt, and onion powder into the roast before cooking as well as sprinkling over the potatos.

This is the best pot roast I've ever eaten!
Here are the changes I made:  I omitted the potatoes and used 2 roasts increasing the boullion cubes to 5, increased the water to 1 cup, sprinkled a bit of seasoning salt over both roasts and spread 1 1/2 tblsp of A1 steak sauce over the top roast.  
This is definitely a recipe I will make time and time again!

This truly is the "easiest pot roast ever!"  I've done it several times now and it comes out perfectly.  I've used 2 cups of water though instead of 1/2 cup; it just didn't seem like enough.  I also added lots of bay leaves on top of the roast.  It was excellent!  What a great recipe for someone's first pot roast!

Really good!  I added 5-6 cloves of garlic and I seared the roast and deglazed the pan before putting in the slow cooker.  It came out really tender and the vegetable's tasted wonderful.

Delicious, Melt-In-Your-Mouth Good!  It's easy to throw together and great to come back to after a day at work.  I didn't plan the snow that accompanied the roast, but what a great pair.  Next time, I might add a little black pepper, but that's all I'd change.

This was wonderful! I did  leave the clery whole, so I could have the flavor then remove it when serving(my family doesn't like cerely) or so they think. I do that quite often. They don't mind the taste, just the texture. Anyway, thanks for this recipe.

Very easy, and tasty recipe!  Although, instead of beef bullion cubes, I used a package of onion soup mix. Turned out very yummy and tender!

Definately easy!  I made this when we had some friends over for dinner and it turned out great.  I did put too many potatoes in it and I added extra carrots but it was delicious.  I should have added more water for the extra veggies so I could have made gravy but it was still fantastic!

Although this recipe was quick, easy, and kid friendly, it turned out awful!  The main reason was that it was bland.  Everything just tasted like beef broth, with not much other flavor.  Yuck!

I've used this method of making pot roast for years now.  It guarantees the meat is moist and tender.  I do add salt, pepper, garlic powder and bay leaf and brown the roast before putting it in the crock pot.  As the newlywed reviewer said, remove the veggies and roast when cooked and use cornstarch to thicken the juice into gravy.  Very easy and very good.  Don't overthink this recipe and try to turn it into a top chef presentation.  Not every recipe needs wine and multiple herbs to be good.

Certainly an easy recipe. After reading reviews about cooking time and seasoning I have a few comments. 
     Try browning the roast first  in a hot pan with a little oil. Then season with salt and pepper.  You can also add garlic and other herbs you like. I prefer to use tyme.
     If you like more salt and seasoning,  I add an onion soup mix poured over the roast. The bigger your roast, the more seasoning it needs.
     Finally on the cooking time, the longer it cooks the more it will pull apart and shred. If you prefer to slice it, you can remove it when still firm to touch.  
     We always let ours cook slowly and for a long time.  Pull it apart and lightly chop. Then back in crock pot with all the veggies and juices. 

Thanks and good luck!

Very good & easy to make. I followed other raters' advice and seasoned, floured & browned the meat before slow cooking it. It was delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

Loved the bouillon in this, but I agree to season the meat more and so I did with house seasoning. I also made a luscious gravy with the drippings. I was asked to make this again soon.

This is what I did to modify... instead of water... Beef stock.. i also put a can of cream of mushroom in with lots of veggies and more liquid. I put one pouch of onion soup mix on the raw chuck and seared it then put another pouch in with the liquid. It was to DIE for!! Definitely cooking it again!!!!

This was the first pot roast I've ever made and I was terrified that it had been ruined. I prepped everything the night before because I didn't have time before work and left my husband instructions for putting it together. I had cut the carrots and put them in water and in the fridge to keep them crisp over night but neglected to tell my husband to drain them before adding them to the pot. When he told me he had added all that water I thought for sure that it would come out tasteless and thin. I WAS WRONG! It did end up being a almost like a stew but was still FULL of flavor and went perfectly over the garlic mashed potatoes I made to go with it. I will definitely make this recipe again and again....perhaps next time with the appropriate amount of liquid ;)

Pretty solid roast recipe. I did rub the meat with steak seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder and browned it in a pan with olive oil before putting in crock pot. I cooked on low for 6 hours and veggies were still crunchy. So I put it on high for another 2 hours and it was perfect. Really tender and not at all bland. This did not make much gravy, so if you like a lot of liquid-y gravy you might want to consider that. But I thought it turned out great.

This is an awesome roast recipe. I had never cooked a roast before, and this recipe was easy to follow and I ended up with a great meal. I seasoned the roast with a little Tony's Catchery and garlic powder to my family's taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for dinner yesterday & it was very good.  I did add a bay leaf, minced garlic and sprinkled onion flakes over roast.  I didn't have celery. I did add 1 can of cream of celery soup.  My pot roast was tender & ready to eat in 5 hrs.  Will be making pot roast in crock pot from now on.

this was my first attempt at pot roast, and i have to say it was pretty good... didn't knock my socks off, but it was good. i tried to follow the other reviews saying it was too dry and added more water, along with a dash of worchester and a splash of soy sauce. turned out good.

This was my first time making a pot roast and I was so pleased how easy and tasty it was! Even my picky three-year old loved it! I only had time to cook it for five hours and my potatoes were not as soft as I liked, so I just microwaved them for a few minutes and then they were perfect! It was probably due to my temperamental 12-year-old crock pot and the fact that I hadn't cut up the potatoes as small as I should have. Next time I'll let it cook a bit longer and cut the potatoes smaller. I also added some steak seasoning to the roast, which gave it a nice flavor. It was juicy and tender.   I decided to use the leftovers (including the leftover "gravy" to make a beef stew. I added a can of beef broth, a can of Italian stewed tomatoes and some frozen mixed veggies. It had such a tasty flavor and was some of the best beef stew I've ever had. It was an easy way to make the leftovers into a different second meal. I will continue to use this recipe when I make another roast.

Delicious, tender and juicy.   I used more water than it called for and added a coating of Mrs. Dash seasoning to the top of the roast, it was scrumptious and so easy!

My first time making a pot roast & it was very good! My 7 year old even liked the meat & he's not a big meat eater.  I did make a couple adjustments based on reviews....I did a rub of Montreal steak seasoning, seared it 3-5 minutes on each side, & added some minced garlic, salt & pepper to the veggies.  I used a 3 pound arm roast & it only took 5 hours on low.  Seems like my crock pot never takes as long as recipes say though....good thing I was watching it!  Highly recommend this recipe!

Best pot roast I've made so far.  I added some Nature's Seasoning to the veggies, then rubbed the meat with some McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning.  Half way through, I gave everything a good stir and scooted the meat under some of the veggies so it could simmer in the juices.  It smelled and tasted amazing!!

This was the BEST pot roast ive had. So easy to make. I did 2 cups of water, and added garlic powder and salt and pepper along with the beef buillon cubes too. Seriously awesome. Mine didnt come out dry either!! I recommend this to everyone :)

This was my first time using my crock pot and I can't wait to use it again. This turned out great. I'm not sure what some reviewers are saying about being bland. I found this delicious. I added small garlic powder but that's it. And I agree with another reviewer, you add spice based on the tastes and flavours that your family likes. That's what's great about this recipe. So easy and you can add or subtract whatever you like. You can't really go wrong. The gravy I made from this was delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Not good. The meat was dry, the gravy/juices was bland and so were the vegetables. It smelled wonderful while it cooked but dinner was a major disappointment :(

Easy and delicious!  Read reviews re: flavor - here's a quick fix:  Sprinkle a bit of seasoned salt on roast, then mix can cream of mushroom soup with minced garlic and 3/4 soup can of water - pour over all.  Hubby & teens loved it - going into my regular rotation, thanks!

This recipe gets five stars for truly being easy - easy to prepare, easy ingredients, easy to cook and serve. It is very good for the little amount of time/attention given. Like some other reviewers, I also added a few extra spices (garlic powder, salt & white pepper) and one can of cream of mushroom soup. Mine only took about 5 hours cooked on low setting. Very good!

Easy, delicious, no browning.  Don't have bouillon cubes?  Just cook it in plain water.  This is a super easy recipe.  My husband and I both loved it. Leftovers?  Warm up for beef stew, didn't even need to thicken!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I haven't cooked beef in my slow cooker yet so I had to adjust the time a little bit, but it turned out fantastic! I added some spices and a can of beef broth. The meat was really tender and I turned the juices into delicious gravy by adding corn starch. The leftovers were amazing as well! Great recipe!

Meat came out very moist and delicious.  Giving it four stars because while the meat is good, it could use some actual spices.  I'll have to do some doctoring.  But otherwise, a very good basic recipe for those just learning the art of slow cookers (i.e. me).

Cooked on low for 8 hours, meat was tough, vegetables were over cooked, not much gravy.  this is the first recipe with beef that i've used that didn't have me brown meat before putting in crockpot, usually meat goes in first not the veggies.

This was my first roast, so I wanted something fairly easy.  It definitely WAS easy, and I was very happy with the results!  It smelled so good all day long and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I left out the onion and celery (picky husband) so I just added more potatoes (we love em).  I also added some basil and oregano, I was trying to make sure it was extra flavorful.  It was all very good, next time I might try to add more herbs and spices to kick the extra flavor up a notch!

Good recipe! I used red potatoes and did not peel, just cut in half. The potatoes were perfect after 8 hours on low. I also used Better Than Bouillon beef base to spread on roast instead of the cubes. I seasoned the roast well with Lawrys seasoned salt before putting in the cooker. Very good meal.

We loved it!  We made a few changes.. we used a whole carton of organic beef broth instead of the cubes of beef bouillon, we added larger amts of all veggies and we added fresh parsnips too since we had them in the frig.. it was wonderful.. thanks so much!! ps:  our meat was only about two pounds and we still have plenty of leftovers..

I'll try this again - first I got an English Roast and baked it at 350 for one hour (used a themometer) and let it stand for 10 minutes.  Loved the flavor, just not as tender as I know it should be - I'll update you after I try the crockpot and a better cut of roast.

Easy? Yes. Slightly tasteless? Also yes. I liked this recipe because it saves time, I'll just have to play around with it and make some adjustments here and there. FInd some way to insert a little more flavor or something. Hard to get the kids to eat, too.

Very good and similar to what I use. I added a package of onion soup as well and also dumped a little soy sauce over the roast and veggies which adds more flavor yet doesn't add an asian taste.

This recipe WAS super easy, and the flavor was great! I followed directions as specified.....I might take it out an hor earlier next time- I think the 7 hours I had it set on low was too long. It was a tiny bit tough, but still I had zero complaints! :)

Easy to prep, very little to do.  Just throw in a pot and let cook.  I recommend adding some adobo and some all season salt to the mix to season it up some.

This recipe is amazing! I made slight changes to the recipe.  I put 4 cloves of garlic in the roast and then covered it with the boulion cubes, along with garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper. I did not add any onions with the vegetables and it turned out great.

This was good, and easy, but it didn't have a lot of flavor. I added a lot including rosemary, a bay leaf, garlic, and a few other various spices to get some flavor. The veggies were good, but the celery was not cooked all the way through.  This is a good base recipe, but needs modifications.

This was a great recipe!  Very easy and tasty.  I did add some seanoning salt and some onion flakes, but aside from that I stuck to the recipe.  This one is a keeper!

I like how easy this was to make and it tasted just like my Grandmothers used to.  I did substitute the celery with cabbage and I put more than a 1/2 cup water in.    This was excellent!

I have not had a pot roast in years and have never made one, but this is just like i remember.  i browned the meat first (because my mom told me to) then added the water 1.5 cups of waterand bullion  to the stuff left in in the pan.  i put the veggies on top of the meat and put it on high.  i only needed 3 hrs.  next time i will add the potatos a little later as they were a little too mushy.  other than that it was perfect

A delicious, mild flavor and the roast practically melted in your mouth!  The only thing is, ours cooked in close to 6 hours (1st hour on high, the rest on low) Make sure you watch the slow cooker on this one. Thank you for a delicious meal!

Fantastic! My first time using a crockpot. Cooked it for my 17 year old brother and my husband and they loved it. I added a lot more spice. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, steak seasoning, three whole cloves of garlic, and a cup of water instead of half.

This came out more like a beef stew... but I still loved it!  I left out the celery because I didn't know how I would like it with this recipe.  I am glad I did.  Next time I will add more carrots.  I cooked all day (about 7 hours) on low and it was awesome.

Made this tonight! Very good!  I didn't have bullion so I used dry onion soup mix.  I used a round roast but I think a chuck roast might have been a better choice.  However,  one of the things I love about crock pots is that they make cheaper cuts of meat taste great.

This is a good basic recipe.  The only problem was that the cut of beef was not specified.  If you used a lean cut, it ended up too dry.  You need to use a fatty cut like chuck roast for a slow, low temp cooking.  Makes all the difference--ask your butcher for recommendations.

This is the best roast I ever made! I have always roasted them in the oven but this was by far the tenderest and most flavourful. I did make a couple of changes. I omitted the potatoes in the crock pot and made mashed potatoes at the end. I rubbed in salt, pepper and sprinkled some flour on the roast and seared it for about 4 min. on each side. I wanted to make gravy and thought the flour on the roast would make it a little thicker before I I also used the corn starch and water after I poured out the liquid . I deglazed the pan with red wine and pored that in the crockpot. I had a 3 lb. roast and slow cooked it for approx. 6 hrs. Even though I made those changes it was the best roast ever. Thank you for a great recipe.

EXCELLENT!
Tender, Juicy, and a very hearty meal.
This is the most perfect basic Slow~Cooker pot roast. All we taste is a nice, trûely wonderful beef flavour. If you want something basic, simple, soulful and delicious. (Not overly seasoned or a wierd type flavour). This is your meal. 
Easy to make and such a warm, cozy comfort food. Makes great leftovers for the week.  If there is any! LoL.

Sooo easy!! If you want to mix in more stuff is okay, but is just good just as it is. My only comment would be on the cooking time, I had to leave the roast an hour more than the recipe says, but I'm sure it was my slow cooker's heat. Family adored it. Thank you for sharing, maybe next time I'll do it as some of the reviewers suggested, you know, to mix things up :P

Great recipe for taste and ease. I used parsnips instead of potato, two cans of beef broth instead of the cubes. Got an Black Angus beef roast on sale (4 lbs). After 8 hours, it pulled apart. Nice sweetness from the parsnips.

Certainly a recipe I will use over and over. I did however add about 1/4 cup more of water , only used half an onion (because i'm not a huge fan), and before putting the roast in to cook I rubbed it with salt and pepper. It turned out great, but it didn't have all the flavor I wanted. Next time I'll try adding garlic like suggested in the other reviews.

Just a bit too bland. But I liked the cooking method, so I used the slow cooker but took the roast uptown by skipping the water and bouillon and simply using low sodium beef broth. I also added some freshly minced garlic, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, some freshly ground pepper and a bit of salt and a bay leaf. Mmmmm... tender and delicious! When the roast was done, I thickened the sauce with a bit of corn starch and leftover beef broth and made a lovely gravy.

I've made lots of roasts this way, but omit thev3 cubes beef bouillon, because of the salt, and ADD beef stock or beef broth instead, with garlic instead...kind of punches up the flavor  a bit, because of omitting the 3 cubes of beef bouillon, and  put it on low for about 6 hrs too! ;) yes, the can go on for the time in this recipe, but you also can!

This is a great roast recipe , but to those that have never used it try adding some kitchen bouquet its something I've always used in my roasts and gravies , because my Mom did . And it truly is a secret ingredient.

This was very easy, and my husband liked it a lot. Rubbed the roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder and basil and added a bay leaf to the crock pot. Used beef broth (10 oz) and no water, and thickened the liquid with a flour water slurry while the roast rested. Thanks!

Very good starter recipe.  I too added some spices, once using an onion soup packet and the other time I just threw in what sounded good from the spice rack.  Each time...Delish!

Because I was having guests over for dinner after church I prepared the vegetables and meat the  the night before.  I used 6 large  red potatoes, 3 small-medium onions, some celery for flavor, a few more carrots, and floured and browned  the roast. After placing the vegetables and roast in the crockpot I covered the meat with Montreal seasoning and Lipton's onion soup mix.  After pouring in the beef broth, I then placed the crock in the refrigerator. At 5:45 a.m. I turned  the crockpot on high for 3 1/2  hours then turned it to low when I walked out the door. Returning home at 12:45, I put a bag of frozen peas in a casserole dish and microwaved it for 8-10 minutes. Dinner is served!  The key to a tender roast is choosing one with lots of marbling. Cooking it on low for 8 hours would have been my preference but I was a bit short on time.  Thanks to all who made suggestions so I could adapt the basic recipe using a few things already in the cupboard. I have made this before with the original recipe and found it tasty and tender as well.

My husband loved this dinner!!! The meat came out so tender and juicy. I did tweak the recipe just a tad to our own taste. I used about 2blsp cornstarch added about 1 and half cup of water. browned  meat with a 2splashes of red wine for a few min then place it in the bottom poured water mix over it added some spices to our taste some worchester sauce,chili flakes,thyme,oregano,basil,chili pepper. layered potatoes,and carrots on top (didn't have celery added sliced pepper) and cooked on low for 8hrs. Wonderful and easy recipe would highly recommend.

Love it but made some adjustments based on other reviews. Placed 2 cut up celery stalks, 3 regular cut up (not baby) carrots, and 2 cut up parsnips in the bottom of the crock and covered with 1 c beef stock and 5 pats butter. Trimmed and placed 3 lb chuck roast on the veggies. I mixed one can cream chicken/mushroom flavor (a new single can combo Campbells offers now) with 1 c beef stock till smooth, then poured all over, concentrating on covering roast. I cooked 4.5 hours on 6 hr high setting, then added halved "yellow gold" (two-bite) boiling potatoes, pressing down into the soup/gravy to cover. I cooked an additional 60 minutes, at which time I took out the roast, put the crock on "warm", and set the meat aside on a cutting board to "rest" for 1/2 hour. The roast was perfect...potatoes perfect..."gravy" awesome. Carrots and parsnips perfect. Only complaint is the celery was mushy. I made the whole recipe a second time, trying to add the celery later in the cooking process (at the same time I added in the potatoes) to try to keep some *bite* to it. However, the celery was stringy and floppy (I'm calling this under-done). The stringy-ness made the celery undesirable and kind-of chewy. So, I don't know what to do. I love mushy celery in soup...but I would like a little more *bite* (without the strings) to my pot roast celery. Any advice? Please send me a message!!

This recipe is good for easy and quick preparation  with plenty of time to cook and forget for while, this is the one.  I think it is better if you want some more flavor, then add more spices.

Very Good! I too added some additional spices (garlic powder, bay leafs, fresh cracked black pepper). I also browned the meat before placing it in the slow cooker. In addition, I added more veggies than listed and didn't add them until about half way through. I cooked it 6 hours on low. Yum!

I think this is too bland, but with the addition of some spices: bay leaf, garlic, and a little cayenne, it's much improved.  I suggest thickening the gravy with flour or cornstarch.

Came out terrific - super tender meat and tasty veggies!  I ended up adding an additional 1 1/2 cups of broth about half way through cooking  otherwise it would have burned in my crockpot.

I thought the recipe was great! I prefer to season my meat on the front end so I seasoned on all sides with salt and pepper then cut garlic cloves into slivers put them into slits in the sides of the beef. I also took previous advice to sear on all sides before putting into the pot and added more carrots and celebry. Delicious!

I made 4 servings using a 2 lb pot roast.  In 1/3rd cup water I mixed 2 tsp beef granules, 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 tbsp Italian Seasoning, 1 tsp dried parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp ground pepper and 1/8 tsp salt.  I used regular carrots, not baby carrots.  Cooked on low for 8 hrs. Turned out delicious!

This was excellent.  Made just a few changes to use what I had on hand.  Instead of water I used 2 cups French onion Broth and poured this over the roast.  Didn't use celery, but used celery salt, and misc other seasoning to season the meat.  I didn't have bouillon cubes, but did have the beef broth powder so I sprinkled this over the roast. I had no Fresh onion, but dried diced onion, and Garlic..So used this both in place of fresh..End results were a perfect roast, I'd say one of my best.  This recipe can easily be modified and still taste delicious.

Super easy and good for the lack of effort invloved.  I took some other review's advice and added a little garlic salt and a tad extra water.  A 5 star would be more rounded with the flavor, but of course that would be more work.  I will say I had leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was way better than the first time...maybe it was because it was all nice and hot straight from the microwave, but it was juicier and more tender and flavorful.  So...great to take along as lunch!

Great basic recipe for a slow-cooking pot roast. My additions: Rubbed roast with Reese's Steak Salt (pepper, garlic powder, celery salt); added 1 can cream of celery soup, extra water. Cooked in crock pot on high 3 hrs. & low 4 hrs. Next time I'll add less water, only 1/2 can of soup and cook totally on low. All the soupy-water made great gravy, but roast was boiling in too much water, instead of just steaming in crock pot.

Very easy pot roast.  The only changes I made was to leave out the celery because I didn't have any and I used chicken broth instead of water since that is what I had on hand.  It was super tender and delicious.

My family loved this dish.  It was easy and very tasty!  I added extra water for extra sauce.  I tossed my meat in flower, salt and pepper & browned it before I placed it in the slow-cooker.  Excellent for a cold, rainy-day meal.

I made it for dinner last night and everyone loved it!  It really was so easy. Instead of beef bullion cubes, I used Garlic and Wine Seasoning from The Melting Pot and Lawry's Seasoned salt.  I put in the carrots, onions, and celery and dashed the Garlic and Wine seasoning.  I rubbed the beef with minced garlic and the Garlic and Wine seasoning and put it in the crockpot.  Sprinkled some Lawry's seasoned salt on top, and instead of water, I poured over 3/4 cup of chicken stock.  Since I didn't want the potatoes to get mushy, I cut them up and shook them in a ziploc bag with the Garlic and wine seasoning and left them in the fridge for 4 hours while the everything else was cooking.  Added the potatoes under the meat with 4 hours to spare.  It was tender and juicy and had great flavor. The veggies were perfect.  Our dinner guests loved it and my husband kept telling me how good it was.  We still have leftovers!

I was nervous about making this dish, but since the recipe said "easy" I figured I would give it a try. The prep was so fast and "easy"! I made the recipe as directed, minus the celery. My slow cooker was boiling the juices on the high setting, so I only let it cook for 3.5 hours. It turned out to be very tasty and my "plain-food-lovin'" boyfriend even enjoyed it. Can't wait to make it again.

This was the first roast ever that my husband and I attempted to make and I was cautious about how it turned out.  Let me tell you it turned out great! I would definitly would make this recipe again, but I might add some more flavor.  The smell through the house and the hallway I me salivating at the mouth

This is one I use over and over! I use extra veggies, just because I love them. I add extra broth instead of water and brown the meat in spices and flour before putting it in the crock pot. The remaining flour and spices that are stuck to the pan I remove with a little red cooking wine, then pour the remaining mixture over the meat in the crock pot. Absolutely wonderful!!

I made this recipie for my family and it was delicious.  The meat was so tender and falling apart like a good roast should.  I did not have the bullion cubes so i used the powder instead and it still turned out amazing.  Very easy, very simple, and simply devine.

This was great! I didn't have any bouillon cubes so I reduced 3 c. beef broth down to about 1 1/3 c. I  substituted dried celery for the celery stalks, and added garlic salt and pepper.

This is the best roast I have had. It's better than my mother's! I didn't have room in my crock pot for the potatoes so I just made mashed out of them with gravy made from the cooking liquids and cornstarch. The carrots were even good cold the next day.

Awesome! My husband loved this roast so much, he was begging that I didn't eat too much so we would have leftovers!!! I omitted the veggies and added a can of diced tomatoes and used minced garlic. I put the roast over noodles and it was so delicous. I served with fresh bread and it was a hit.

I used dry onion soup mix instead of bouillon cubes, a can of diced tomatoes instead of celery - the gravy flavor ended up being delicious. The meal itself was a total bomb, however..... It cooked for five hours on high --- the meat was tough and the potatoes and carrots were hard and crunchy. If I make this again I'm going to have to leave it going for like 4 more hours, I think in order to make the meat tender and to soften the vegetables - it didn't seem like they cooked at all!

My first time making pot roast and it was such a hit!  I did brown the onions & beef first.  I also thickened the sauce with corn startch. It was so delicious!  The entire family loved it.  I will sooooo be making this again!
Thanks for sharing!

For a slow cooked meal, this has to be the best.  I gave quickness a 5, but it is supposed to cook in 5-6 hrs.

While this is a really quick and easy potroast, the flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  The potroast wasn't very brown - it was an unattractive grey color.  There need to be more seasonings - the whole thing was pretty bland.  We won't be using this recipe again.

This meal is very easy to prepare. Added a bay leaf for a little bit extra flavoring. The Crock Pot makes the meat melt like butter in your mouth. Absolutely Delicious !!

The meat and vegetables were tender and juicy.  The sauce was flavorful, but a bit thin.  I added flour to make it like a gravy.  This was so simple and so delicious.  My husband LOVED IT!!

This was the driest roast I've ever made. I thought it would be juicy, particularly because it was cooked in a crockpot. No such luck. We won't be having this again.

Tried to stay with the recip, but didn't have any celery on hand so I just added celery salt.  Even though it didn't say salt and pepper the salt, I did since I believe it had to have been left off by mistake or just assumed.  I used a Chuck roast and it was bigger than called for so I cooked 6 hrs on low and 2 hrs on high.  The last 2 hrs I did take the vegs out and just left the meat.  I also added some cornstarch to the gravy just to thicken up just a bit.  Had good flavor.

Just a couple of suggestions. I like to use Better Than Bouillon instead of cubes, as it provides much more flavor. I also pour Kitchen Bouquet over the meat before putting the cover on. You will have a dark brown, beautiful roast and nice, dark gravy.

Ok, this is one of my favorite wintertime meals. It turns out so good that I usually eat until I hurt. I have a few changes to my potroast reciepe. First I use either a london broil top round roast or a boneless sirloin tip roast both around 2.5 pounds each. By the way, I do 2 of them in seperate crock pots because 1 is never enough lol. In each crock pot along with the meat goes 3 pounds of carrotts, not baby carrotts, peeled and sliced in 1 inch pieces, and half a 5 pound bag of sweet onions, peeled and quartered. The onions and carrotts make the meal. Also add one packet of lipton beefy onion soup. Just put in a bowl with hot water to mix it up and dump it on top. Add enough beef broth or beef bouillon mixed with hot water to cover the roast in the crock pot. If only using bouillon, usually 3 cubes will do it. Put the roast on top of a layer of carrotts and onions, add all ingredients, salt and pepper the roast and cook on low for 9 hours. The meat will melt in your mouth and the carrotts and onions are incredible. Make some garlic mashed potatoes along with the meal and don't forget to save the broth and leftover carrotts and onions for making egg noodles.

I tried this recipe having used my slow cooker a few times already. After about 3 hours on high my 2.5lb roast was almost over cooked and the veggies were still kind of raw (edible but crunchy). I ended up taking the meat out and leaving the veggies in on low for another hour or so and they turned out okay. Not sure if I did something wrong or if the recipe needs tweaking. Will probably try again.

Used a crock pot for the first time. Had the steak, carrots, potatoes, salt, pepper, onion powder, and water. Cooked on High for 5 hours. It came out alright. Might add beef broth next time for extra flavor.

I used an electric skillet and followed the directions however, after 3 hours on simmer, it wasn't done. I put everything in the slow cooker, added 1 cup of water and turned it to low and went to bed. The meat was perfect in the morning however I had to throw the vegetables out because the were mushy and greasy.  I took the meet for lunch.

I made this today and it was SO amazing!! I did make a couple of changes, I use 2 cups of water so I could have more juice, added some canned mushrooms, and  I also added one package of Lipton's dry onion mushroom soup mix.  I made some spiral pasta and put the pot roast over it... It was so yummy!! Thank you so much!

Made this twice.  First time made as written except used beef broth instead of bouillon/water because that's what I had.  Liked it, but kind of bland (that's why 4 stars).  Made again with some easy changes and thought it was much better.  As others suggested, used a fair amount of salt, pepper, garlic powder on meat as well as a bay leaf and minced garlic with the beef broth.  Didn't use the potatoes because I made mashed potatoes and used the juice to make a gravy, but if I didn't have time for that would definitely throw them in with the veggies.  A few simple changes made a huge difference and my family loved it.  Hard to find an easy pot roast recipe that doesn't use packets for seasoning.

Easy and delicious. I had a small roast, about two pounds. Like others, I found my cooking time a little shorter, closer to 6 hours on low. I also added a little more spice - salt, pepper, Cayenne, garlic on the meat. Last hour I added a few leftovers vegetables -  corn and asparagus.

I used 1 can of beef broth and 1/2 cup of red wine for the liquid.  Otherwise I made as directed.  This was good, but not better or easier than the many other pot roast recipes on this site.

Awful!  Bland and dry. If you try it, cut the veggies small, increase the cook time, and double the seasoning.

We liked this.  Used a little extra vegetables as they would fit in pot.  Used bouillon granules.  Cooked for 8 hours on low and seemed just a little dry... less next time.

This is a great way to introduce yourself to the crock pot world. I use broth instead of the water and add random spices to the meat to kick up the flavor. So good and so little effort!

This recipe lacked taste in my opinion. Everything came out very tender but I think that if I make it again, I will probably add something like a dry onion soup mix or some kind of seasoning to it. It was very bland.

Substituted the beef bullion for some leftover beef stock. Omitted the celery to keep it even more basic. Was very simple, kid-friendly, and basic enough that everyone could add their own personal ingredients to make a large crowd happy. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  i will be making it again :) this was positively delicious and I loved that I didn't have to stay on top of it!

I do believe this is the easiest and tastiest crock pot roast I've ever cooked.  I normally cook mine in the oven, but never again.  It easy to prepare, and I always season my food, so it was tender and tasty, my family loved it too.  I did use beef broth along with a splash or two of red wine...unbelievable.

This is delicious and so simple!  It was nice to come home and have dinner ready to eat.     I cooked mine on low for 8 hours.  I spread pureed ginger over the top of my roast before putting the bullion cubes on it.  I also crushed the bullion cubes a bit before putting them on and I threw in a clove of minced garlic with the vegetables.

Excellent Pot Roast recipe.  I used a crock pot and used a medley of different small potatoes, red, white and purple! Instead of water, I used beef broth.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and it was perfect!

I just made my first pot roast ever by following this recipe, and it was a hit! I left out the celery, because my husband doesn't like it, and I omitted the beef bouillon cubes as well because I didn't have any on hand. But even with these omissions, the pot roast tasted fabulous. I think I did overcook mine a little bit, as it was a bit dry, but the flavor was amazing, so the dryness wasn't very noticeable. I will be using this recipe again in the future.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Not only is it dry, but almost tasteless.  Unless you bury it in gravy or some sort of sauce, it is barely edible.  Avoid at all cost.

even searing it in olive oil with steak rub and garlic, and adding tomato juice and worcester sauce, it still came out bland. needs a more flavorful sauce.

This was my first pot roast ever -- it was very easy to make and turned out delicious. After two of us ate it, I had enough leftovers for two tupperware containers.  I used 3 lbs. of beef chuck, and I cut it up into cubes before placing it on top of the vegetables... this was nice because then we could eat it like beef stew and not have to cut up the pieces later. I only used half an onion and it still turned out great.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very easy and really good.  I had never made pot roast before, so I came online and found this recipe. It seemed fairly easy so I gave it a try.  I put everything together in 5 min. while I was getting my kids ready for school.  By the time I came home from work it was ready!  Everyone loved it, Even the kids!  Thank You for this delicious recipe. :)

I wasn't impressed at first because of how tough the meat was.  But, we ate it anyway and forgot to turn the slow cooker off.  A few hours later (total of about 10 hours, 4 on low, 6 on high), it came out excellent and I couldn't wait to have leftovers for the next day. :)  I guess I'm still learning my settings on my slow cooker.  But, overall, a great recipe.

Simple and delicious. Left out the celery because husband doesn't like it and the potatoes because I was going to try a new recipe. Served with PW's "Crash Hot Potatoes."

Super easy and super yummy.  I did add 2tsp rosemary, 2 cloves crushed garlic and fair amount of black pepper to the roast.

Wish I would have found this recipe years ago! Now I will never have second thoughts at making roast beef again.  I used liquid boullion instead of the cubes, a few good shakes of seasoned salt and celery salt.  Will add more veggies next time.  Thanks so much.

This is really tasty and very easy.  I added about 6 ounces of V-8 juice and a packet of pot roast seasoning .  It added that little extra flavor to the sauce which turned out delicious.

Wonderful, easy recipe - leaves a lot of room to expand but you don't really need to. The only thing I added was parsley and crushed peppercorns. Turned out great!

This is a great recipe. So easy and smells so good coming home from work to (almost like Mom's in the kitchen). I used beef broth (no beef bouillon) and a bay leaf. Yum!Yum!Yum!

It's very bland with water and bouillon so I used beef stock and some merlot in 1/4 and 1/4 amounts. Then I added the vegetables, chuck roast, and 3 bouillon cubes as directed. No pre-searing needed. Cooked on low for almost 9 hours in the crockpot. Salt and pepper to taste.

Fantastic! All the way through the meal my husband kept saying "This is really good".. I did change a few things. Instead of cooking it in water, I cooked it in beef stock. Instead of using baby carrots I used regular carrots and chopped em up, leaving the skins on the carrots and potatoes. The gravy that I made from this roast was amazing! Thanks for this recipe!!!

I loved this recipe! Like everyone else, I added plenty of my own seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, pepper, bay leaf and a little bit of sage). I cooked mine on high for about 6 hours. It was great for dinner, but I kept it on low and later on that night, the left overs tasted even better!

Used this for my first roast ever, and it was no doubt very easy! Instead of the beef flavoring, I used a slow cooker beefy onion packet.

It turned out well, and the meat was very tender and moist, but it seemed sort of bland.  I put some rosemary, thyme and pepper in to spice it, but I just must not have put in enough!  It's a good base, and really easy, I would just suggest working with the spices some to see what's best for you.

The veggies came out a little bland but that might have been unavoidable. This is the very first time I have cooked in a crockpot and was thrilled with the result. I rubbed both sides with mixed spices and leory salt. For the bf and I we had dinner and tons of leftovers for about twelve dollars including the carrots, onions, pot roast and tax. Great! thx

Very good recipe. I used a 3lb chuck roast and added a few different spices.  I cooked it for the recommended time and the roast came out very tender. I will cook this again. My family loved it.

My husband loved it but I think the meat needed more flavoring. Next time I will try more seasoning. It was my first time making a roast and it was definitely easy.

I tried this recipe a couple months ago and although it had great flavor (I spiced it up more like others mention), it came out a little over done.  I decided that I need a new crock pot since realizing that my crock pot is 18 years old.  I just bought a programmable one with auto shut off and I'm trying the recipe again today.  Will be back to review again.  I'm a busy mom of two toddlers and I need easy!  This recipe is very easy!

I cooked it on low for more than 6 hours but it did not seem so tender. I turned it up to high for another couple of hours, it was good but not fall apart meat. Maybe it was the cut of meat but was not as tender as I had hoped.

I didn't eat it right away.  It was in the fridge and then reheated for dinner the next day.  I wonder if I ate it right away if I would have liked it more.  I'll probably try it again.

This was very easy and had a good flavor. I did add 1 1/2 cups of water to it though. Next time I will make gravy.

This meal is very quick. The only thing you have to do is make gravy (if you want it).

I found that I needed to cook it longer than 4 to 5 hours on high. I don't know if it is just my crockpot or it should be cooked around 6-7 hours on high.
