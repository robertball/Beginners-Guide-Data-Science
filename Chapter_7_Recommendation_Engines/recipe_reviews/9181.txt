I made a lot of changes to this recipe, such as adding other herbs and cutting back on the sage.  As is, the spice is too plain.  Thanks for posting, as this recipe inspired me to create a home made poultry spice.

Loved it!  One tip, however.  I didn't want a pint of it, so I made 1/4 batch and stored it in a plastic spice Tupperware container in my spice drawer.  (I think you can pretty much disregard the author's warning to only store it in glass and never in plastic!)  I will never add poultry seasoning to my shopping list again, now that I can mix my own from spices I already have on hand!

Worked out great for me... I used celery seed instead of marjoram. It made fabulous stuffing for Thanksgiving!!!

Followed the recipe except that I cut back on the salt by 1 tablespoon.  My sister was over for lunch when we tried it for the first time.  She raved about how good the chicken was.  What my husband did was put some of this seasoning in a small bowl and added olive oil to it.  Then he brushed some on the chicken before he grilled it.  Thanks for this great recipe, and I will definely use it again.

I had to make this because I had no poultry seasoning and it was WAY too cold to go outside with a newborn.  I had to substitute oregano and basil for the marjoram and rosemary for the same reasons. I can't wait to make this with the correct ingredients.  My hands smelled GREAT after mixing it.    I reduced the servings down to what I needed.

I made one small adjustment--I cut the salt back by half. Absolutely perfect!

fantastic blend. Reduced recipe to my need, used whole sage leaves instead of the rubbed and ground, omitted salt. Ground the entire mix with a mortar and pestel, dumped into the "white" chicken marinade also from this site.

This worked PERFECTLY!  This Thanksgiving we were making dressing when we found we needed poultry seasoning.  We had many of the ingredients already, and used this recipe to combine them in the correct proportions with AMAZING results.  Using recipes like this instead of buying specific poultry seasoning can be cost effective if you already have the ingredients.  We cut the recipe down to the tsps needed in our dressing recipe and the dressing came out better than ever.  I would definitely recommend this to others!

Great!  I scaled the recipe way back and used it in the "Savory Turkey Gravy" recipe from the site for Thanksgiving.

I tried this on a pork loin, and we loved it.  I eliminated the salt altogether and it was still very full of flavor.

Very close to my favorite store-bought poultry seasoning - I'll never buy it again!  I did reduce this recipe to 16 servings to give me a more manageable amount, and removed the additional ground sage. (I substituted ground sage for the rubbed sage and omitted the additional ground sage called for in the original recipe.) Also, I grow & dry some of my own herbs so I use my coffee grinder to powder all my herbs before measuring and combining. Enjoy!

Worked great for me.  I only needed enough for one recipe (2 servings), I used the adjust recipe icon for 2 servings.  Tastes great in my stuffing recipe.

I only had rubbed sage and it was plenty potent without adding crushed sage on top of it. Otherwise it was pretty tasty!

This is a great seasoning mixture.  I make a large batch and store it in tupperware.  I primarily use it on chicken as a marinade along with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and tamari (gluten free soy).  Thank you!

Thanks for this!  I was making a recipe of pan fried chops which called for poultry seasoning.  I just happened to have all the ingredients for this.  They were the BEST chops I've ever made, and the poultry seasoning definitely shined.

Great I did add fresh parsley and sage as I grow them to my recipe.
