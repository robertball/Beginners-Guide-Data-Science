AWESOME! Though I am not sure how close my finished product was to the intended recipe. I had to use what I had on hand in the pantry. I used light Catalina salad dressing omitted the honey and threw in about 2 T. of dijon mustard for a kick. I also only cooked it about an hour because I was afraid of it drying out. It was absolutely DELICIOUS and loved by the entire family. They all said this was a definite keeper and to "PLEASE make it again mom." Thanks for the great idea...plus...it was EASY EASY EASY! A huge bonus for a mom of 4!

This is an easy and very tasty dish that I've already made a couple of times. The only suggestion I would make is that I think there might have been a misprint with the amount of honey used. 1/4 teaspoon wouldn't even add anything to the taste. I used 1/4 cup and if you like honey (as I do!) a scant 1/2 cup isn't too much to use. I also browned the pork tenderloin in a frying pan and added the sauce mixture right into the pan covered the pan and put it right into the oven - saves some dish washing! I'll continue to make this recipe - thanks so much for sharing it!

Very very tasty. Just a few changes will use a little less onion soup mix the next time. Just a touch salty. I also as the other reader cooked it a little less time and at 360 instead of 375. My sauce started to burn. All in all We loved it. Very easy and meat was as tender as butter!!

This was AWESOME!!! Who would have thought Russian dressing could add this much flavor? The sauce was wonderful and I used the leftovers for sandwiches. This is becoming a weekly request at my house and I'll be trying variations with chicken soon. Thanks!

An easy way to do this to recude the amount of dishes to wash is to sear the meat in a Le Crueset dutch oven (or similar) on the cooktop and then you can cover and transfer that right to the oven. I cooked this at 350 degrees on convection roast for 1 hour and it was cooked through perfectly. Unfortunately I'm going to have to find another recipe for the sauce as we did not like this at all. If you like Russian Dressing then you will like this. Apparently my family does not like Russian dressing in the least and that is all you can taste in this dish. The honey was lost and the onion soup mix seemed to be as well. I gave it 2 stars for the method of cooking and the idea more than anything. the tast of this dish just didn't suit my family's palate.

So EASY!! Here are the things I did differently... 1. Used 2 boneless pork loin butterly chops (about 8 oz) -- cut them in half so they made 4 servings. 2. Made these in a skillet so I heated the olive oil over medium heat and added the flour-dredged (seasoned with PEPPER ONLY -- there's a lot of salt in the soup mix) chops. Browned on both sides and reduced heat to low-medium. 3. Used Kraft Light Catalina dressing. 4. Added 1 clove of garlic chopped. 5. Used 1/2-3/4 envelope dry onion mix. 6. Accidentally used an 1/8 c honey lol!! They were too sweet but not actually by a lot. Maybe eyeball half of an 1/8 c (1/16) of honey 7. Added sauce over browned pork chops. Flipped occasionally to make sure they got sauce on both sides. 8. Cooked until the chops were done!! Spooned some sauce on top of each one and served with a green salad. 9. There was about 1/2 c sauce leftover after I generously topped my 4 chops so you could probably make 5-6 2 oz pork chops.

Wow I admit I didn't think this would be that good but it was recommended to me by a good and trusted friend! It tastes WAY better than you might think! Great combination of ingredients. I added garlic to the sauce.

Delicious way to serve pork tenderloin. I did omit the step of browning the meat with the flour breading. I just browned in a skillet without breading and proceeded from there. The sauce of this is great. I though 1/4 tsp. of honey was kind of pointless. So I didn't measure and dirty a spoon I just gave a healthy squeeze from the bottle. I've used this sauce a few times on chicken but never on pork. I had stirred fried a bunch of fresh veggies and potato slices to go with the meat. The sauce from the meat was wonderful over the veggies. I will be making this one again.

Well Mine isnt even cooked yet but the sauce is so good I could just go eat it with a spoon! I can think of a dozen other things the sauce would be good for. right now I wish I had french fries to dip in it. I used what honey I had which was prob only about 1/8 cup but it is a really good local echinacea wildflower and added some great flavor! will definately use this recipe again.
