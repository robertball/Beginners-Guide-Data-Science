Enjoyed this as it has a very fresh taste. However, if you use a full cup of tea like the recipe notes, the drink will likely be very thin. However my banana was not frozen.  So I give the recipe a 5 on flavor, but not 100% sure on best measurements.  I will make it again.  I used honey lemon green tea with excellent results.
