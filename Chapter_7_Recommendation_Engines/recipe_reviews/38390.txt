I wanted this to be good. It sounded good. But I had no idea how good it would be. You said it eats like a meal, but I served it with our favorite chicken dish. I've never seen them leave so much chicken behind. You amazed us, thanks!

I really liked this but only used the basics to make it.  I used green onion, garlic, soya sauce, beef buillion, carrots, tomatoes, brocolli (fresh), cauliflower, rice, and ground beef.  I browned the beef first, removed it, and then followed the recipe but only with the above ingredients.  It was tasty and quite like a stir fry and a good way to use up a lot of spare food like vegetables.

I think this has the potential to be good but it was way too salty for us.  I would recommend cooking the broccoli till almost done and then doing the recipe.  By the time my broccoli was cooked everything else was soggy and overcooked.

This was very tasty.  I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and not as much onion as it called for.  The brown rice was a very nice change.

Delicious!  I used fresh mushrooms and broccoli.  I added sunflower seeds just before serving.  I think you could add beans to this recipe, too, for more protein.

A nice basic veggie stir fry that easily accomodates other veggie additions.  I did feel it needed a healthy dose of chopped garlic and I added cooked chicken, as well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, LORETTA21!
