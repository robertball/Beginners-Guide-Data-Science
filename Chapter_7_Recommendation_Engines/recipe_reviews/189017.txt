I love to find great new recipe and this would up there with the best! I made some modifications to make it less fat.  I only used 1T of butter and cut the olive oil in half.I also used fat free half and half.  I topped it the chicken with sliced avocados. My husband and I loved it!! We can have skipped the pasta portion! Thanks for a great new keeper!!

This is actually 3 recipes. The pasta & zucchini recipes were pretty blah. But the chicken dish was delicious. Will definitely make again and serve with roasted veggies or rice. It is important to use fresh cilantro and to use a blender. I tried the food processor and it wasn't creamy so had to mess up the blender too!

The timing of this recipe was a bit off -I thought the pasta was cooked too much in advance however the sauce on this chicken was to die for. Wonderful flavors! I lightly floured the chicken before cooking and I served mine w/angel hair pasta instead of linquine but other than that I followed the recipe as it was written.

I baked the chicken for 30 minutes in the oven. I used fat free half and half and added salt to the sauce. I didn't have fresh lime juice so used bottled concentrated so I'm sure the fresh lime juice would have been much better. But even using the bottled juice, this was an excellent recipe. Very flavorful and everyone agreed, shrimp would be great in this rather than the chicken.

Fallowed the sauce recipie put I put the Cilantro and Garlic thru the magic bullet instead of putting the liquid thru b/c I dont have a belnder also thickend it up with a little flour. It was so good!! I served it with broccoli and fresh baked rolls =)

I love cilantro and lime but not in this recipe. The lime marinade and the lime cream sauce are overwhelming. Too many green onions in the sauce. The zucchini is boring.

This turned out very special. I made Zucchini cakes in place of Zucchini slices becuse I only had shredded zucchini. And I made a garlic sauce instead of Cilantro. Very fancy

I used artichoke instead of zucchini. Add a little chicken bullion powder to your pasta with the cheese and that will zaz it up a little for your taste buds. I would recommendnot using any lime juice in your sauce if you've marinated your chicken in it and add half of a fresh mango to the blender for your sauce it's great!!! I added a little paprika to the top to dress it up a little bit.

I love the sauce. I have never eaten it over zucchini and have also found that it tastes more delightful over rice than the pasta (the rice soaks up the sauce really well).

This was amazing! My family loved it! I didn't change a thing, though I did add thinly sliced avocados on top of the chicken, underneath the sauce, and it was awesome.

This was wonderful BUT I think you need to eat all the components together as I am not sure how wonderful the pasta is by itself. Only ingredient/cooking change I made was I cut my chicken into chunks and marinated it for an hour. I then cooked the chicken with a package of fresh mushrooms that I had sliced thick. When I plated I layered... pasta chicken/mushrooms zucchini (sliced into pieces after roasting)and topped it with the cream sauce. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

The pasta was bland the chicken was WAY too lime-y and the zucchini was mushy. I only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes and I baked the zucchini for 15. Despite my poor rating I think this recipe has potential and I am going to give it another chance (if it works out better I will up my stars). I am going to saute the zucchini rather than bake it and Im going to make the sauce a bit more creamy (like alfredo sauce). Last thought is to use feta cheese rather than parmesean. Looking forward to trying this again. Good luck to the rest of you!

I used shrimp instead of chicken and sauteed them with mushrooms. The sauce is WONDERFUL! I used reduced fat half and half to lower the calorie count and served over orzo. By the way vee833 you can't substitute lemon for lime and expect it to taste the way it's supposed to. Thanks Sandy. It's a new favorite at our house.

The calories and fat content are so high on this dish that I question their accuracy. I wouldn't try this dish until these values are re-calculated.

We really enjoyed this. I cut up the chicken into strips before marinating them. That way it took the chicken less time to cook. After I cooked the first few ingredients I put them into the blender. Using the same pan I cooked the chicken fresh mushrooms and asparagus. After a while I added the blended ingredients and the cream. It took less time and turned out really well!!

Way too much lime it was the only thing I could taste. Next time I'll skip the broth and wine and do all cream it was too watery.

Did anyone try with dried cilantro rather than fresh? Maybe that was the problem--chicken was good--didn't care for the sauce--like I said could have been because I used dried cilantro?

I mixed the chicken with the zucchini and tomatoes used parsley instead of cilantro and sour cream instead of cream. Didn't need the parmesan. Delicious.

This was delicious! I have to say that I only made the chicken portion of this and we ate it with rice. I think the sauce would be delicious with shrimp as well The only other change I made besides amounts (I used 4 pieces of chicken and increased liquid amounts) was to add a jalapeno to the garlic/cilantro mixture. For the future double the sauce because it's yummy!

After reading the other reviews I decided to put the pasta on the bottom and serve in our favorite pasta bowls. Can we just say five star excellent! But then this sauce would be great on an old gym-sock. The roasted zucchini with the chicken could stand on its own but don't let it... follow the entire recipe the way it's written and serve it without fear... with lots of bread to clean up the bottom of your pasta bowls.

Marinade was very good. I skipped the pasta for some spanish rice. The cilantro sauce needed less lime its all I could taste in the dish with it on top of the lime chicken. After I scraped it off the dish was good.

I did this recipe without the pasta. The lime chicken is a nice low calorie alternative when you don't want the usual white sauces or BBQ. This may be a welcome change to have now and again. Zuccinni was delicious!

This dish was very flavorful but the zucchini came out a bit soggy and the sauce was very runny. A friend of mine said to try it out but after comparing we both had the same review "runny sauce". I'd be willing to try it again but only if i can get the sauce thicker. Note: I didn't change anything on the recipe and followed it to a T.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this was; so was my husband. We both had our doubts but I needed to use up some cilantro and zucchini and I had lovely fresh lasagna to enjoy. I did add some cornstarch to make it a little creamier but it's something like a cilantro pesto and I will certainly make it again.

we just made the cilantro cream sauce and it basically tasted like a scampi sauce with cilantro and cream it. cut the fat by using fat free half&half and we didn't have any limes on hand so we substituted with lemons and it tasted a little too lemon-y. will probably make again for seafood (mmm shrimp!) or pasta but not for chicken.

The chicken and sauce are the good parts. Zucchini is kind of blah but it does go nicely when you eat it w/ the chicken. Made plain pasta...didn't bother w/ the parmesan/tomatoes...it was still good.

I didn't care for the lime with cream. I did not make the zucchini and the instructions are backwards (make pasta last cook chicken first) and it did not require nearly the amount of green onion. also the cilantro was a bit unnecessary as the lime was very strong. I did not marinate only sprinkled the chicken breasts with the spices and omitted the initial lime to make the chicken crispy. Won't make again.

This recipe was great! I made it exactly as directed except for some changes as recommended by other reviewers. I cut the lime juice down a bit (a little more than half of what was listed) added a little seasoning to the zucchini and added half a jalapeno to the cilantro/garlic mixture. I think it would've been fine without these changes but with them it was fantastic. Will make again!

I cooked the zucchini for 1/2 the amount of time the recipe called for and it was still a pile of mush. I had thought the pasta was supposed to be hot but the layout of the recipe suggests that it should be cold having pasta sitting the whole time while you are just beginning the rest of the recipe was ridiculous it was also pretty bland and needed twice as many tomatoes. If I make it again I won't use as much pasta. The sauce was good I do wish I had an immersion blender it was just another couple of steps of pouring everything back and forth. I had to reheat the cold oily pasta before I could serve it.

The 7 of us loved this!!! The sauce was the high light I made as written. I chose to make rice instead of pasta. I made it in a rice cooker adding olive oil garlic powder and onion powder When the rice was done the cherry tomatoes were added I I tripled the recipe. I grilled the marinated chicken and the zucchini. It was hard to stop eating it it was so good!!! It s definitely not for someone who doesn t love lime and cilantro.

i only made the sauce to put on fish. It was tasty but a little thin would like to try the full recipe some time.
