We thought these were really good.  For a more intense orange flavor, I did take 2c of orange juice & a pat of butter, and reduced it down to 1/2c.  I then added the 2T chardonnay to my OJ reduction and continued the recipe as written, though with my already-thick reduction sauce, I did not have to add the cornstarch/water step. Served with green beans, and steamed brown basmati rice with a bit of butter, chardonnay, and drizzled with a some of the orange sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe, HAC3!

I used bone in pork chops and it turned out fine. I did the orange reduction versus the cornstarh thickening method and it was delicious! It took a little extra time, but well worth it IMO.

This very simple recipe is lovely. I read other review and agree that more orange juice is key (a added a cup) and I used fresh tarragon (about 2 teaspoons.) As the sauce was thickening, a dash of cayenne pepper, a teaspoon of orange zest and a 1/2 tsp of sugar really enhanced the favor. It was a hit -- thanks!

This was very tasty and moist. Although I am not fond of orange flavour I still liked it.

My family LOVED these chops!! I don't know if it made a difference or not, but, I squeezed the OJ, cause I didn't have any thing else...And, I didn't tweak it either...Maybe next time I will, cause I WILL be making these again!!!

I doubled the sauce which was nice on the rice I served with the pork.   Also cooked some thin slices of orange with skin on in to the sauce.  Next  time I will double the amount of tarragon.  My husband thought this dish was "tasty" so I will make it again.

Great recipe, like others I increased orange juice the orange juice to 2cup as well as the wine (1/4+ cup) and then reduced it once the chops were cooked. This produced a intense glossy golden sauce. If you do do this method then remember to add a teaspoon of sugar/honey as it can be quite tart otherwise. I have also done it substituting the tarragon with 1teaspoon of dried thyme; this was really yummy.

Pork chops a little tough this way, but the sauce is light and very flavorful.

I took the suggestion to reduce two cups down to half a cup of orange juice.  I reduced the oj a bit too much and had to add water.    I also add a tiny bit of brown sugar.   It was ok, but I didn't love it.   I don't love pork chops though.   My kids ate all of it, which they don't do often.

Very good and easy for a weeknight dish, yet good enough for company!  I did perk it up a bit by adding a thinly sliced 4015 sweet onion to the mix.  Browned the meat, piled the onions on top, and then followed the recipe. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.

This was very easy and made a nice meal for a weeknight. I followed the directions as written. Taste of orange and  tarragon was a nice combination and a change from the ordinary. Thank you.

It was just Alright. If I made it again I think I would add some brown sugar to the sauce.

OMG this was so delicious! I didn't have plain orange juice, so i substituted OJ with mango, so you get a little mango twist to it and it was still VERY good. Definitely printing out the recipe card for this one!
