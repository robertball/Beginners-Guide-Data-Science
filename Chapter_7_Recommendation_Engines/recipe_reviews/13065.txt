EXCELLENT Chowder!!  I have made this twice so far. I did cut the liquid back by about half, maybe a little less.  Served at a dinner party for 8 people as a first course & everyone raved.

This is an excellent recipe.  Also is an excellent base for fish chowder.  Add your own favorite seafoods for variation.

Wow- I was VERY disappointed with this recipe.  First of all, since the vegetables (including the potatoes) were "minced" it really lacked the chunky vegetables usually associated with a chowder.  Secondly, there was very little flavor, even though I added additional clam juice, cayenne pepper, and salt & pepper.  The broth also seemed to seperate, making a very odd consistency. My husband, who found & was looking forward to the recipe, ordered a pizza.

This is an outstanding chowder, better than most restaurants can dream up, for sure!
The Sherry adds a touch of class, and it's a breeze to cook up on short notice.
I used whole cream and skim milk, as that's what I had on hand, and in the future I intend to add some haddock or cod to add a bit more seafood to the mix.

This is a can't miss recipe for those who love a good, rich seafood chowder!

Be prepared to freeze this soup or eat it for a few days. My 13 month old loves it with crackers crumbled in it(seafood picked out,of course). We're a family of three; mommy, daddy, and baby. Just to give you idea of how much it will feed...for a few days!! Very tasty,perfect for cold weather.

I did not find this recipe very good. I had to add chicken boullion to give it some taste. Way too much liquid also. I wont make this again.

This was wonderful.  Any fish or seafood will work.  Even the kids enjoyed this.

Often times I surf the web looking for ingredients for newly created recipes and of course check out all recipes (that’s a given for me).I saw your recipe online and decided to adopt from it. I wanted to make a medley of seafood items in a dish very much like yours. I love your ingredients and from that I made a few changes and here’s what I did.Instead of using water I  exchanged that for chicken broth and whole milk instead of half-and-half.I upped the butter to one cup.  In my sauté I chopped celery, green onions and white onions.  I added. Oyster sauce, and plenty of obey seasoning. I omitted the tomatoes.  Of course the corn and potatoes.I included cod fish, salmon, shrimp, scallops, oysters, clams, and squid I wanted  but I didn’t have any on hand.       In conclusion my dish was scrumptious. Thank you for helping me through your recipe in creating a dish of seafood medley.  Kevin, Washington DC

I changed the recipe by adding Lobster, Crab, & Clams to the Scallops and Shrimp. I also added Old Bay Seasoning and tripled the Sherry (half w/onions and half with the shellfish) to make an absolutely delicious dish! Add some good Sourdough Bread for the perfect main course!

One of my favorites.  I have made this chowder many times.  There are usually no left overs.

Loved this recipe...I added shrimp, salmon, clams, and flounder to the base recipe.  I had single serving frozen leftover that made the chowder wonderful

Outstanding! The store was out of red potatoes, so I bought purple. At one point, I was afraid they'd turn the chowder an unattractive color, but as you can see from the photos, I needn't have worried. After making the purée, I added fresh mushrooms and a can of kernel corn. This turned out to be a great vehicle to use the leftovers from my low-country boil. This recipe is a keeper!
