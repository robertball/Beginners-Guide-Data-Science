This was ok. I was hoping I'd like it a lot more bc I eat tons of kale and could always use a new way to prepare it, but with a couple tweaks it could definitely be 5 stars. The sugar step took much longer to melt than the time it takes to toast the cashews. I suggest starting on the sugar first, then putting the nuts in the oven.  The cashews were a little hard to separate on the baking sheet. They stuck together quickly and the sugar hardened into a hard crunchy candy shell. I think next time I'll just melt butter and brown sugar together and toss the nuts in. Much quicker and easier, and the cashews don't turn into a hard candy. I also found this salad to be quite salty, and I even used low-sodium soy sauce. Kale salad needs very little liquid once you start massaging the leaves, so I think even just 1-2 tsp of soy sauce would be plenty. I used mixed jumbo raisins which added a nice contrast of textures between the hard,sweet cashews and the soft, salty kale leaves. With the decreased amount of soy sauce and simpler sugar-coating method, I would really like this recipe. i will play around with it to see what works best. Thanks for sharing tabarita!
