This cake is very rich, it's almost like fudge! I really enjoy dark chocolate, so this cake definitely is one of my favorites. I like serving it with raspberries. Also, I have baked my cake in a bundt pan, I just bake it for like 5-10 minutes longer (keep checking it)

Sincerely, I made this 2 years ago and my best friend with whom I shared it still requests it. Be warned: this cake is beyond delicious. It will send you to the moon with its velvety smooth consistency and leave you asking how you lived before experiencing its greatness.

I may have baked it a little too long because it was a little dry, but overall good taste

Great recipe!  I baked this in a Demarle flower mold.  Plan to refrigerate overnight for best flavor and texture.
