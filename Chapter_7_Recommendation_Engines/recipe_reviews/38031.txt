LEAVE OUT THE BROWN SUGAR!! When I copied down the recipe, I forgot the brown sugar, and it came out wonderfully. The second time I made it, I did put in the brown sugar and did not like it as much. My friends and husband didn't like it sweetened either. 

But without the sugar it is fabulous and chic! A really nice, flavorful, asian-inspired dip that will really impress everyone, even people who are not into eggplant.

I didn't find this to have a strange taste at all!  I liked it,  it does seem to be missing something though..not sure what.  Maybe the flavours need to meld a bit before serving.

Delish! I will probably cut down the sugar a little next time, but didn't find the sweetness offensive. I liked this a lot!

This was very tasty! Like other reviewers, I was going to cut out the sugar, but still used 1/2 tablespoon because I splashed in a bit too much vinegar.  I spread this on pita flat bread, and topped with feta, chopped tomatoes, and cilantro. My friend added a little extra salt and pepper and crushed black olives. Will definitely make this again.

Yummy!  I subbed Hoisin Sauce for the brown sugar and Umaboshi plum vinegar for the rice wine vinegar.  I added more garlic, ginger and garnished the dip with chopped cilantro.  Instead of bread I used those evil fried noodles they serve with soup.

Very good & unique flavor.  I followed the recipe ingredients except I used half the amount of soy sauce.  I placed all of the ingredients except for the eggplant & onions in the blender to blend then slowly added eggplant which I had diced and cooked on stovetop.  I then removed from blender, placed in microwave for ~2min then added onions and served.  Easy this way and kept the strong ginger flavor.

Even though I cut the soy sauce to 1 T, it still was way too salty for my taste!  I also cut the sugar to 1 T, and used honey.  If all I had was 1 taste, I would have been fine.  This does not get better with time!  I want to like it, and will work to see if I can combine the garlic and ginger flavors with just a little soy sauce to make this eggplant spread more to my liking!

I also usedd only 1 scant tbsp sugar and don't think I'd prefer more. My eggplant wasn't that big so I wish I'd cut back on the soy sauce- itwas a little overpowering. Also I added about twice as much red pepper flakes for a little more zing. All in all a very tasty dips. Took the advice of another reviewer and baked whole wheat pita bread triangles brushed with garlic chili oil. (warning: only takes a few minutes!)

Yum, my family and friends love it!  Perfect for vegetarians & vegans as well.  I make it with "sesame sippits."  Which are a combination of serian bread cut into strips brushed with oil, salt, pepper, and minced garlic, and cooked at 375 until crisp!

I really liked this, nice asian flavor.  It made WAY more than we could eat at our party.  I wonder if it would freeze okay?

This recipe was very easy and very good. I added a bit more garlic. Next time I think I try adding some curry.

Yes, it's true, it's strange, but......oh so delicious!  My husband just loved it.  Didn't have enough eggplant, but had some commercial eggplant spread that really didn't have much flavor, so I added it also added some additional "hots".  Will diffinitly try it again Thanks Laura
