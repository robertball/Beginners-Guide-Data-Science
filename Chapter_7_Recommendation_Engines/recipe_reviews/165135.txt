This was great for an office party. I used regular marshmallows as well as the new strawberry flavored marshmallows and they were delicious!!

I made these for a kid friendly dessert. They were such a big hit, I barley got them made before the kids started to eat them. I also like how versitile they are. I made them with stawberries, grapes, bananas and apple. I cheated a little as I didn't have time to make the rice krispy treats so I used the premade ones. I will definatly be making these again and again.

I made this for a party that I knew would be attended by children. As anticipated, they really liked it. It makes a fun presentation. I actually used 3 different colors of grapes rather than strawberries because strawberries were pretty out of season when I needed them. The grapes looked and tasted great.

This was a great twist to boring old rice krispy treats - I made this for my son's 5th birthday party at school.  They have a rule no cakes/chocolate allowed, so this was perfect ..it's still sweet and a somewhat healthy snack for kids.  All the kids in his class loved them (except for one, but I think he was just having a bad day).
