This recipe had great flavor and was easy to make.  I recommend cooking it on medium heat rather than medium high; the first one I cooked ended up a little burnt.  Turning the heat down made them perfect.

This was terrific! Great taste, not bland in any way. I used McCormick hamburger seasoning instead of Montreal Steak seasoning and ground sirloin. I topped this with peppered gravy and we had such a great meal that hubby and I even split the last (second) piece. We usually don't eat seconds for diet conscious reasons but this was so delicious we both just couldn't resist a little more. Thanks, this is the best recipe!!!

Don't hate me, but I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  :)  I had leftover "Hugh's Dry Rub" & it's similar to the ingredients listed so I used that adding a little dill (1/4t dill, 2 12T rub).  I had more cubed steak than listed so put the spices directly on the meat.  Then the flour/saltine combination.  Then egg/milk.  Then flour/saltine again.  I had plenty of the coating.  Didn't make extra.  Everyone liked it, but it didn't wow me.  The coating I'll definately make again - adding spices to it, or to both it & the meat.  (Four ounces saltines is a sleeve, btw - provided you have a pound box).  Allowing the meat to lose its coolness, helped the breading adhere to the steak & not stick to the pan (I think anyway).  I cooked them over (gas) medium for about 5 minutes on each side.  Once (& sorry if it grosses you out) the wet, pinkish color starts to come to the top of the steak, it's time to turn over.  Using half butter & half olive oil is a yum combination for panfrying.  Oh, made white gravy, too.  Good idea.

This was my second time making country fried steak and this recipe was by far the best. I cooked mine a little longer to give it that really crunchy texture and I added extra Montreal seasoning. This tasted so good throughgout the entire steak you could taste the seasonings so it did not taste bland at all. We will keep this recipe for sure.

This was a easy and quick recipe. At first it looked a little bland to me and I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out... but I live in a house with 3 men..all thumbs up. I added worcestershire sauce for alittle spice.

I'd never attempted to make country fried steak before so this was my first one. I've also never used saltines as a breading so I was very curious to try. It was sooo good! My husband and stepson loved it too. I didn't change anything about the recipe and I really think this was the best cfs I've ever had! Thank you for your recipe!

Of all the country fried steak recipes I've ever made, this is by far the best one, but I'm not impressed enough to make it again (my hubs agrees). For all the spice called for, I found my steaks to be terribly bland. And, as with most recipes that call for a crushed cracker coating, I found it nearly impossible for any of it to adhere to my meat. I think more of the cracker bits ended up in my skillet than on the cube steaks themselves.... I have one more comment to add. Two tablespoons of oil is not nearly enough to saute with, let alone fry with. I had to add WAY more oil than called for to brown only two steaks. Of course, the suggested heat setting didn't help either (I fried my steaks on medium heat because they were burning on the suggested medium-high temperature). Served with mom's country gravy (Nancy Smith), corn, mashed potatoes and biscuits, this was a filling but disappointingly mediocre meal. Thanks anyways, Laura. :-)

These were pretty bland. I think next time I'll add way more seasoning to the meat, and breading. But otherwise good.

The crackers were a great addition rather than just plain flour. I crunched them to about dime sized pieces and afraid they were going to be too big. But to my surprise, they really helped to add a crunch to the steaks that I have been wanting. Loved the seasoning. I punded the steaks again before dredging them, and I think it really helped for them to be so tender. Thoroughly loved!

This was very, very good.  Go light on the salt until you taste it.  The only change I made was to use deer steaks pounded out thin.  It was so tender and so good with milk gravy and garlic mashed potatoes.  I'm sure the whole family will love this.

Today was the first time I had made fried steak. 4 minutes was too long on each side. After the 1st steak, I cooked them closer to 3 minutes. The egg and milk mixture wasn't quite enough for all 4 steaks. They may have been larger than the recipe called for. I also used Chicago steak seasoning b/c it was what I had. However, they came out pretty well and I will definitely use this recipe again.

Everyone loved this, but I wish this recipe had the sauce for the steak on here.  I used a couple of tablespoons of the flour mix to a couple tablespoons of the oil from the pan.  Then slowly whisked in whole milk until thick and bubbly.  This turned out very well.

It’s a good thing this isn’t easier to make because I would probably eat it every week! I had NEVER made country fried steak before so I figured I’d give it a shot. I really like the seasoning in the flour mix. However, I had to make mine gluten free. So, for anyone wondering, you can make this GF by using all purpose GF flour instead of regular flour, as well as 4 oz of GF bread crumbs, panko, or do like I did and crush up some GF salted crackers of your liking. I will admit I grabbed a recipe for a gravy from another fried steak recipe on here. But that was basically using the drippings from the pan after frying the steak, and then adding some onion, milk, salt and pepper, and corn starch for thickening. But the drippings in the pan from THIS recipe is what made the sauce so good. All in all this was delicious! Well done!

This is wonderful. My husband and I prefer McCormick Country Gravy on top. Followed this recipe exactly except used egg beaters instead of egg and milk. Make sure to press the coating on like it says. Turned out wonderful. Husband said it was like restaurant quality!

This was excellent. I haven't made Chicken Fried Steak in a long while but it was great. The flavor was wonderful. I did use ritz crackers instead of saltines. I think thats what did it. Will definently make this again.  Served with mashed potatoes and gravy of course. The family loved it!!! Even my twin 3 year old boys.

Very easy recipe to follow.  I followed all directions.  My only complaint was that it was a bit on the salty side.  I will use low sodium crackers next time.

This recipe was great. I added extra seasoning though. When making this recipe make sure you press the steak very hard into the breading. This way it wont fall off when your are eating it. I deep fried this instead of pan frying. It took about 7 min. for two steaks. It turned out great and had a lot of flavor!

I’m not a good cook. This recipe was a bit bland for me. I thought I was making a gravy and didn’t end up with one which is necessary for a chicken fried steak. I’ll fall back and re-group and give it another try— maybe using ideas from some of the others. Don’t you have to use Tabasco somewhere??

I loved this recipe. For my crackers I layed foil down on my counter top and used a rolling pin to crush them then mixed it into the dry ingredients.  Thank you for taking the time to share this recipe.

Not bad, had never made it before def season next time which I forgot. But wasn't chewy. And pre heat your pan. I cast iron which I love. Made eggs and pancakes with it.

I have made this dish a few times and it is a favorite for my family!  Such good flavor.  If you don't have saltines, use Ritz if you have them.  I crushed 1/2 sleeve and cooked 4 steaks...it tasted amazing!!!!

I did cook it a little bit longer, as I don't care for pink meat at all. Didn't change anything else. Turned out quite good.

Great recipe. I did increase the steak spices. I didnt use the kind that it called for, but rather just something I had in the cabinet. Nothing special but it turned out great.

This was the very 1st time I'd ever made chicken fried steak.. it was so simple & yummy! My husband & I really enjoyed this. The only thing I changed was I omitted the seasoning salt  (only bc I didn't have it) & used kosher salt, pepper, cayenne & Mrs Dash instead.  I read some reviews about the breading falling off... dipping your steak in the flour mixture thoroughly b4 dipping it in the egg makes a huuuuuge difference. Very little fell off mine, but I'd made it so thick it didn't matter. Also, yes, that is definitely not enough oil. However, just a tablespoon or two more will suffice. Merry cooking! :):)

This was the best I have made! It would have been a 5 star but needed salt!  This is after the season salt , saltines and I didn't have garlic powder so used garlic salt I did cut back a little in that thinking it would be to much salt. I also used dried minced onion instead if powder cause that's what I had. And only had Chicken Montreal seasoning so used that. Fried up nice and crispy and served ii with whipped potatoes and white milk gravy. YUMMY!!       Use enough oil to fry add extra as needed :)

I was leery of the steak seasoning, but I used it anyway.  The seasonings were perfect.  The only change I made was using panko instead of cracker crumbs just cuz I didn't have any.  Panko works just as well.

I seasoned the meat with the meat seasoning, added the rest to the flour mixture, I double dipped because I like a thick crust, and a tip for it staying crispy till everyone finishes their steak is to let the battered steaks sit about 15 minutes before frying. And for a healthy version, fry it in coconut oil!!! Less guilt and you cant tell the difference, it handles high heat nicely!

I used steak, omitted the crackers and seasoning salt. The whole family loved it.  I made my own gravy and mashed potatoes. I did have to add additional oil for  frying.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  All I did to change it was add a shake of garlic powder and cooked it for almost 10 minutes per side over medium heat to make sure it was done.  Very good!

I had two black angus round steaks that were very tasty and tender.  I tried to use the grill but it was too windy to lit it.  I looked up this recipe and just cut it down a little and it was very good.  I didn't do it, but a touch of cayenne would probably be a nice addition.

Seasoning tasted good, but for the most part, these didn't turn out for me.

My cube steaks were 'pre seasoned' when purchased, which I think is why they seemed salty.  Followed the recipe exact and made a nice crunch on the outside and were very tender.  Keeper!

I have made this several times and my husband is nuts about it. I make white gravy and mashed potatoes to go with it and it is always a hit. I have never used the Montreal steak seasoning though, I used regular Mrs. Dash.

The flavor was great but unfortunately the "crust" fell off of the steak quite easily while slicing.

This was my first experience making country fried steak, so I had no idea what to expect. This recipe turned out AMAZING! It was even better than something I would expect to order at a restaurant, and my husband declared this one a keeper!

My husband is from the south and grew up with this kind of meal - he said it was the best thing I have ever made for him!  I took the advice of someone on here to use Ritz crackers instead and it worked out perfectly.  The times on here for cooking are right on and it turned out soooooo good!  Love it and definitely recommend it!

Very good, I used club cracker instead of saltines( what I had on hand). I served with "mom's country gravy"-also from this site and mashed potatoes and a salad. Oh and I did use more oil then stated.

WOW! This is the best country fried steak! My husband loved it so much. I actually used round steak so it was thicker but it still tasted so delicious. I tossed the flour and other ingredients in a plastic bag and I also used corn oil instead of canola. Crust was very flavorful. It was very quick and easy. I'm going to make these for the parent in laws for breakfast, they will be so impressed!

This was WAY to dense. Stick to just a flour coating, the saltine crackers made the whole thing way to heavy and thick.

After the first bite I heard "restaurant status".I can't stand this stuff in general, but the men love it, and really enjoyed that it can now be made at home.
