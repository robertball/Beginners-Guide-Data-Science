Glaze not needed.  Ginger didn't work with the cilantro.  Next time I omitted added a bit of dry mustard that works well with the lime and a pinch of chili flakes.  This gave it a more of a SW flavor and served with black beans and an avocado salad.  Very nice.

I only marinaded this for an hour. I saved the marinade and added the honey -then I brought it to a boil. Basted the "glaze" onto the Tuna. Excellent flavor. Tip - strain the marinade if you want a smoother glaze.

I love this recipe. I like it better with lime, but will use lemon when I don't have lime. I prefer it with ground ginger, spreads the flavor better. I have baked it, fried it, and grilled it. It is the best grilled, but good the other ways as well. I have seen others post about the combination of flavors- I had my doubts and was surprised at how much I like the combo.

excellent dish!  I have never enjoyed tuna steaks so much before!  I don't know if the tuna I used was yellow fin, but it was delicious either way.  I used powdered ginger because I did not have fresh on hand.  I also used a george foreman grill after marinating about an hour without the honey, and then removed the fish, added honey and boiled the marinade (as suggested by another commenter)while the fish was cooking and drizzled it on the fish before serving!  A side note -- I accidentally spilled some pineapple juice on the dish at the table and it was still great!  If I have it on hand next time, I would think about adding about 2 table spoons of pineapple juice to the marinade (on purpose)!!  ENJOY

This was the tastiest fish dish I ever made!  So easy and so delicious.  I left over a small amount to bring to the girls at work to try.  They all want the recipe.  Even the on co-worker that does not care for cilantro, loved it!  I will add this to my recipe box!

I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  I have never been a big fan of fish...but I really liked the cilantro and lime flavors in this recipe.  I recommend marinating tuna over night.

Yummy! So summery. The key with Ahi is always don't overcook! I have made this a few times and always feel like I finish with a gourmet dinner with a few simple ingredients. Everyone loves it!

Very delicious - I also omitted the glaze as my husband does not like "sweet", and added an extra clove of garlic to the marinade.  The fish turned out very moist and flavorful - definitely will make this again!

I didn't care for the marinade on these tuna steaks. The lime was a bit overpowering, and the cilantro with the tuna wasn't a very good match. I only marinated these for an hour and it was still too much.

I love this on the grill! I don't eat red meat, so this is a good alternative for me and holds it's own next to a steak.

Very good, my fault, cooked the tuna a little too long, but I like it rare to medium rare. 
Will try again.

I've now cooked this a few times (all stove-top), sometimes altering the recipe slightly (due to ingredients on hand, or me thinking I remembered how the recipe went and I really didn't... :), and each time it's been stellar!
I once didn't separate the marinade and basting ingredients and just cooked it all up together; had to pull everything out as the sugars caramelised, but was just as fantastic!

Was in a hurry when mixing up the marinade and mixed in ALL ingredients, including the honey, cilantro, everything..  put in the Ahi ... into the fridge .. then plans changed and couldn't cook it until lunch the next day...  Looked at the recipe again and realized what I'd done..OMG it was wonderful.  I was careful when grilling, so it was heavily browned, not burned (honey burns easily)  came out perfect..   served with rice and the leftover marinade (cooked)   surrounded with tropical fruit and a wonderful light Sciilian white wine ..  Perfect summer meal.

VERY VERY Good. Even though we overcooked by a min or so was still moist. If grilling suggest 3 min per side, then glaze for 1 min per side and you are good to go. YUM!

I'm terrible at marinating fish - without fail, I either let it sit too long, and the marinade overwhelms the fish flavor, or I go too far the other way, and I can barely taste it. With this recipe, I underestimated the marinate time (I did it for 6 hrs. Should have doubled that). The marinate itself is delicious - next time I'll make more, and use it as a sauce. Nice recipe though. Thanks! Oh, and Happy New Year!

Tasty tuna recipe. A little difficult to keep the honey from burning, although to be fair I was using a George Forman grill indoors, which may have been the problem. I marinated the tuna for 4 hours and I still could have handled a bit more flavor though.

I don't usually cook Ahi. But if you must cook it, this is a great recipe. I just marinated for one hour.  More may cook the fish in the lime juice a little too much. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing it!

Best fully cooked Ahi we've had.  We had some Ahi in the freezer, so I wasn't comfortable with any seared recipes.  My little kids and husband all love it!  The only thing I would do different is season with a little S & P.

This is an AMAZING recipe.I've been making it for over 10 years, and submitted the first pic of it up in 2006 (colorful one NOT the bland looking one) on my first attempt at making it.  Here's the thing, the recipe works. Perfectly.  Period. If you don't like fish, honey, cilantro, lime, vinegar, or following directions, don't make it, you won't like it; if you do it anyway, and change half the ingredients and cooking methods, fine.... but for the love of sanity, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't give a bad review of recipes that you HAVE NOT made. And don't complain about it not coming out right when you yourself bastardized it.

I loved the marinade so much I just used it to cook the tuna in on stovetop instead. Turned out very moist and flavorful. I didn't use the honey glaze. I wasn't too sure how that would blend with the other flavors.

Thought this was very tasty!  Being that it's below zero - I made it on the stove over med heat.  I didn't have enough lime juice, so added lemon to make the amount.  Also didn't have ginger root, so I used a packet that came with sushi and it still turned out great.  Apparently a forgiving recipe!  Will make again!  May add toasted sesame seeds next time!

I thought this was really good, but hubby said it was way too sweet.  I added some toasted sesame seeds for a little crunch and followed the recipe exactly.  My honey glaze was a little thick so I just spooned it over the hot tuna and it melted beautifully.  I will definately make again.  Thanks for the post.

This was a delicious marinade on ahi ahi steaks. I didnt really follow the exact measurements just quickly tossed it all together and let the fish marinade for ten minutes or so and then grilled on my cast-iron ribbed pan (inside) and the flavor was very nice!!  It made boring fish yummy!

I have made this at least three times.  After a few times, I asked if my family was getting sick of it and they said NO WAY!  They wont let me make ahi any other way.

Very good.  It was raining and we could not put this on the grill.  I baked it in the oven and it was very good.

I love fresh fish and this marinade is one of the best!  I didn't use the glaze, but went with a grilled salsa recipe that also had cilantro and lime in it and it worked very well.  The ahi that I bought was sushi grade and I had planned on keeping it pretty raw in the middle.  I found that it was very easy to overcook.

It was delicious!!!  My family loved it!  The only thing I change was the cooking time, 3 minutes each side @ aproxímate temp of 300 degrees on a grill, till I got that very light pink inside.  I decided to complemented with a basic Spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, sweet onion, shredded carrots salad with a light raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Also added some “crunch” with Texas Toast Seasoned Croutons.

Oh my! This recipe is so easy and it was incredibly good! My neighbors raved about it and even their child had seconds. My husband just caught 100 lbs of Ahi Tuna and I now have a favorite recipe!
I served it with steamed Japanese  brown rice, broccoli and a nice salad a with a simple dressing of garlic infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Wanted to do something different with Tuna than an Asian Teriaki/Sesame marinade, so I tried this recipe. I was concerned with the amount of acid (lime juice and vinegar) because these items will "cook" the fish, much like you prepare ceviche. Sure enough, an hour was too long. It drys out the fish (can see it in the picture) and it is simply too tart - even with the honey-olive oil basting. My family did not care for this preparation and neither did I. I may try to use this to prepare ceviche, cut down on the amount of cilantro and add some red chili pepper slivers.

Made this tonight and it was delicious!  Didn't add as much honey as called for, boiled the marinade for serving.  The cilantro flavor was not as strong as I would have liked but we really loved the flavor of the dish.  Definitely will make this again!

I think this would have been very delicious without the lime PEEL.  Perhaps squeezing the lime juice on the fish would have been the best.  But with the slices cooked on it, there was a very bitter taste throughout.

Great recipe.  Very scrumptious.  Only thing we would change would be amount of olive oil used when grilling (makes it a flame thrower with that much olive oil.)Love the combination of flavors.

I don't have a grill, and made this on the stove.  Didn't really care for it.  The ahi came out too sweet on the outside, with no flavor inside, even though I marinated it overnight.

I did not care for this dish. I don't know how, but it had the taste of horseradish, which I REALLY dislike. If you don't mind that flavor, however, you may enjoy it.

This one was just "OK".  Two out of the three of us did not care for it much, but we ate it none-the-less.  The recipe itself SOUNDS excellent, but for some reason it just did not come out the way that we expected.

Surprised my wife with this after a long day at work. She said "best fish dish" I've ever cooked!
