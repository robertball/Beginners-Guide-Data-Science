I made this for my in-laws last night and it was a HUGE HIT!!

I made a few changes though:
-I used Top Sirloin - the meat was SOOO tender
-dredged the beef cubes in s&p seasoned flour
-seared with garlic in pan
-added fresh thyme, marjoram and rosemary
-I used a Pinot Noir and added a bit more than the recipe called for, for good measure!

This turned out beautifully!

Made this for the second time last night and it turns out great.  The only changes I made were to add in some crushed garlic while sauteeing the onions, using 20 oz. of mushrooms, using 1 cup of wine and sprinkling in some pepper at the start of simmering.  Plenty of sauce and thickening with the water/cornstarch slurry is no problem.  We served over egg noodles and mixed in some green peas too.  The leftover beef and sauce is destined for a lovely Shepherd's Pie this weekend.  Love this recipe.

I liked this recipe, unlike my husband and daughter, they didn't care for it. Which is why I gave this recipe 4 stars. I lightly coated the meat with flour and browned as suggested by other users. I sliced the onions and fresh mushrooms and put into a slow cooker along with the meat, soup (I doubled the sauce and used 1 can golden mushroom and 1 can 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup) and 1 cup of wine (I also used the wine to de-glaze the pan I browned the meat in before adding to the slow cooker. Those brown bits add alot of flavor). I also added 2 garlic cloves, pressed to the mixture (I love garlic!). I cooked everything in the slow cooker on low for about 4 hours and served over egg noodles and topped with freshly choppped parsley.

This is a great quick stroganoff. I like to use a cheap cut of meat with this (you CAN use beef or pork stew meat and have it come out fabulously and fake it, I do it all the time) and let it simmer in the sauce for an hour. The longer it simmers, the more tender the meat gets. Right before serving, I like to add a good amount of sour cream and a teaspoon each of dried oregano and dried basil. This doubles well and the leftovers always reheat wonderfully. We like this best over buttered egg noodles. NOTE: Any Campbell's mushroom soup will work in this recipe, I like to use the "beefy mushroom" soup if I have it on hand.

Excellent! Made for guests -- easy for dinner party. I followed other suggestions and doubled the soup and wine. Perfect. I also added some thyme and served over egg noodles with chopped parsley as a garnish. Great flavor and easy. Would transfer easily to a slow cooker recipe. By the way, it will look very thick when you first mix it all t ogether. Do not worry, the sauce will thin as it simmers. No need to add additional liquid with 2 cans of soup and a cup of wine. Oh, I also added a tsp of minced garlic to the oil in which the meat was seared, as others suggested. This one is a defnite keeper.

A delicious recipe! Don't worry if you can't find a burgundy for your dish, cabernet sauvignon or merlots work nicely and also serve nicely as your table wine for the evening.  Serve on rice or pasta with some nice french bread and you are ready.  MMM!  Ambrosia!

This is delicious! Regular cream of mushroom soup works very well if you can't find golden mushroom. I used baby portabellas and they were delicious as well. I also used 1/2 bottle of Red Truck Pinot Noir, and omitted the butter. It does need to simmer for about 2 hours. When you mix everything together, the sauce looks very pink, but after simmering, it is brown. I simmered uncovered after 2 hours to thicken the sauce, and served over baked potatoes. This is one of my favorite winter recipes!

This is a wonderful recipe.  The sauce is just delicious and the prep time is short.  I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I added an extra can of mushroom soup and an extra splash of wine (I used burgundy cooking wine).  It made plenty of sauce.  I also omitted the butter (by accident), but it still tasted great!  I also baked it at 300 for an hour and a half instead of using a dutch oven.  I used horrible, tough steaks and they turned out tender and juicy with this recipe.  This recipe smelled so good while it was cooking and was perfect served on top of rice.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Delicious.  I've made this a few times. Last time I coated the beef in flour before browning. This helped make the meat more tender and also create a thicker sauce,

This was a GREAT recipe.  I am making it today for the second time in 2 weeks..........this time for family and friends.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the burgundy wine and cooked it for at least twice as long as the original recipe says.  It is a keeper!

To make this a lot quicker, I put seasoned flour in a ziplock bag, then added 1" cubes of beef; shook them to coat with flour, then added half to a searing pan of canola oil with a little EVOO for flavor. After the first batch was done, I seared the 2nd batch, then poured 2 cans of soup and 1 soup can of red wine into a bowl. Stirred together, then added to the pot of simmering beef and mushrooms (baby bella have more flavor than plain white, IMO). Set on low on my gas stove and simmered for 2 hours; served over wide noodles (no yolks). Use the same red wine you'd serve with a meal for the best flavor. This is a keeper!

Very good. I didn't have golden mushroom soup, so I used plain cream of mushroom. I also added fresh garlic and some garlic salt and pepper because it was a little more bland than I normally like. Also, I used beef tenderloin coated with flour instead of sirloin. I doubled the sauce and used merlot. The way I made it was a 4 star, but I'm giving 5 stars because I can imagine the golden mushroom soup would be alot better!

GREAT RECIPE!!!  My husband hates wine, but I'm so tired of making the same old stuff for dinner, this was perfect.  The wine taste isn't overpowering, it's very easy to make, and goes great over anything (I prefer putting it over rice rather than noodles)  It was very good.  Thanks Lorrie!!

Great recipe! I used 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, almost a cup of wine. Omitted the butter. Added 1 1/2 t. beef broth base, 1/2 t. marjoram, 1/2 t thyme, a few shots of Worchestershire. Came out awesome. Served over basmati rice (made with beef broth).

This was an excellent recipe just as it was written. However, I always like to give recipes my own touch, so I made a few changes the second time I made it. I dusted the beef in flour and fresh black pepper and added fresh garlic to the pan while it was browning. I doubled the soup and mushrooms, and used around 1.5 cups of wine. I added a bay leaf, a pinch of marjoram, a pinch of thyme, and 5 slices of crumbled bacon to the pan prior to simmering. It was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

This was outstanding!  Great recipe.  I floured, salted and peppered my cubes before browning as others suggested.  Browned with a clove of fresh minced garlic as well.
Also used 1 cup of Burgundy. Turned out DELICIOUS.

Delicious. As suggested in other reviews, I added garlic with the onions and a bit more wine. Also added frozen pepper strips. Will make again for sure.

This recipe has two things going for it - it's easy and it's delicious.  I use two cans of soup and one cup of wine because Ilike a lot of sauce.  Very tasty.

Excellent!! I followed the instructions, except I cooked it most of the way & then put it in the crockpot on low for several hours.  It needed salt, so I added a beef bullion cube.  Yummy!

Great dish!  I doubled the sauce portion (butter, soup, wine)and added a teaspoon of beef bullion.  Prior to searing the meat, I sprinkled with steak seasoning.  Very tasty, very tender, yet mushrooms remained firm enough to enjoy...  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I dredged the beef cubes in a little flour salt/pepper.  Seared them a few at a time in hot oil.  Removed from the pan and did the mushrooms and onions.  Deglazed the pan with half a bottle of a cheap cabernet (Sutter Home) and cooked for a few minutes.  Added 1/2 cup of water to the Cream of Chicken soup, added dried parsley and stirred that into the sauce.  Readded the meat and veggies and put that into the oven for 3 hours on 325.  The meat was tender and delicious!!!!  Served with egg noodles, salad and veggie.  AMAZING!

Floured and added seasoned salt and pepper, then browned. Added extra soup and wine for extra sauce.  Served over rice. Excellent.

I have an extremely picky husband and this was one dinner he rated "excellent".  I did add a couple of bay leaves, increased wine to 1 cup, using cabernet, sauteed garlic before adding meat and added some thyme.  Will definitely make for company!

This turned out really good.  I did not have Burgundy wine, so I used Cabernet and that worked out fine.

I only used stew beef, can someone tell me if that's why this tasted so bland?  It really tasted like over-cooked pot roast in a thick gravy.

Awesome. I used one whole package (I believe 12 oz of egg noodles, and I probably could've used more. I also doubled the sauce and I used red cooking wine. I cooked this in the crock pot on high for the first two hours, then on low for the last 3-4. I will definitely make again.

I used a 2 lb sirloin steak, cut into cubes, coated in seasoned flour, and then browned.  I layered in my crock pot petite baby carrots, the browned meat, 1/2 tsp each thyme, rosemary, and marjoram, and a bay leaf, then the sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I deglazed the browning pan with 1/4 cup wine, then I poured in a 26 oz cream of mushroom soup with another cup of merlot (all I had on hand), and three beef boullion cubes.  I waited for it to bubble and for the boullion to dissolve, then I poured it over the veggies and meat in the crock pot, and cooked it on low for 9 hours.  It was delicious.  =)

You may laugh but we got some red wine for Christmas and we are not big drinkers... so we tried this. Needless to say my hubby has taken the left overs to work every day and he asked if I could make a batch for lunch. One of the easiest meals!

I am rating this recipe five stars not because it is the best beef burgandy I have ever tasted, but because I see some great versatility here. My husband and I had it with mashed potatoes one night. Another night I took the rest and used it(and another can of beef broth)as my base for a very yummy stew/soup. I could see making this recipe up in bulk and freezing it in packets to be used for soups, stroganoffs, etc. What a timesaver this could be. This is a keeper for us.

WOW!  Beef Burgundy has always been one of my favorite dishes when I go to French restaurants/ parties, but I have always been scared to try any recipes because they all looked so complex.  And then I found this one. . . It was delicious!! I did make a few modifications to it, though.  I increased the amount of wine to 2 1/2 cups, and the cans of soup to 2.  This gave is a lot more sauce, and the extra wine gave it a bolder flavor.  The sauce is really what makes this dish fabulous. Also, when there was about 15 minutes of time left for simmering, I added a 15 ounce jar of Holland Style (cocktail) onions, drained and rinsed.  It added a little bit more flavor to the dish and gave it extra points for presentation!  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is great because prep time is minimal. I don't mind the 2 hours for simmering because it makes the meat tender and is fine for a laxy Sunday dinner. But, I highly recommend adding another seasoning. I added sweet basil. It is defintely more than enough for two people.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I made it simpler by using a pressure cooker at the end.  Once the meet and onions were cooked, I added everything to the pressure cooker.  15 minutes at 15psi and the meal was done.  The meat was extremely tender and what a great family pleasure.

I made this for dinner the other night along with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and I thought it was really good! I actually think it would be better with plain old noodles though. I followed the recipe, but I added a clove of minced garlic and a pinch of thyme. Very good recipe. I would like to make it without canned soup the next time. If anyone has a really good recipe for golden mushroom soup (that won't alter the taste of this recipe), it would be much appreciated ;)

I didn't love this.  I made it as written, with the exceptions of adding a couple cloves of garlic and two stems of fresh thyme.  Oh and I made a mistake and added a cup of wine instead if a half (this wasn't the problem...lol).  The flavor was flat and a bit tinny and the texture of the sauce was unpleasantly slippery.  The family ate it but I won't be making it again without crisping some bacon and skipping the canned soup in favor of sauteing the mushrooms in the bacon fat and adding beef stock, then reducing.  

Served with egg noodles but I think rice or mashed potatoes is a better choice for this kind of dish,  I find myself chasing the noodles around and trying to stab them.

Quite possibly the best meal I've ever made! I had to use a chuck roast, and regualr cream of mushroom soup, because that's what I had.  I followed another cook's suggestion and dredged the meat in peppered flour before searing it with fresh rosemary and thyme. The rosemary and burgundy, together, gave it such a rich, heady falvor.

This was so good. I could cut the meat with a fork! I too, doubled the soups and the wine, added garlic, and a little salt & pepper. I served over mashed potatoes, with roasted green beans as a side. Excellent and easy Sunday dinner.

I just got a gorgeous Dutch oven for Christmas and I didn't want to try anything too complicated.  I hoped this would be a great base recipe to customize, and it was! After reading reviews, I wanted leftovers to use for a soup base, so I used 4 lbs. of bottom round I had in the freezer, two cups of burgundy wine, and doubled the other ingredients, using 2 cans of golden mushroom and 2 cans of 98%fat-free cream of mushroom.  I added six sprigs of fresh thyme, several splashes of worcestershire sauce and three bay leaves, and two grated cloves of garlic.  I chopped four portabella mushroom caps the same size as the meat as well and added two containers of sliced creminis, as my family is all about the mushrooms.

The sauce was so delicious, I couldn't even believe it.  We love cream of mushroom soup, but I would serve this to foodie friends who'd turn their noses up at the thought of canned soup - you could not tell it was in there.  

My only complaint was the bottom round got tender, but it was very dry.  When I make it again, I'll definitely stick with the sirloin as recommended, or maybe a chuck roast to save $$$.

I served this over yolk-free egg noodles (fabulous, by the way - no discernible difference), and can't wait to make soup next week!

Thanks so much for a recipe I'll use again and again.

Very good recipe.  I used low-fat cream of mushroom soup to make it a little healthier and it turned out find.  Didn't have an onion on hand, so I used onion powder, and I added a little garlic.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good.  Followed others advice and tossed beef in flour before browning with some garlic.  Husband was very afraid as he smelled something wonderful and peeked in the pot to see that dinner was a nasty purple color.  He was quite relieved that it turned a nice plum/brown before serving!

I give this a 5 star rating becuase of it's easy preparation and it's add on possibilities. I ended up using 2/3 cup of wine and added a clove of garlic to the onion/mushroom sautee. This is a very good dish and there is room for adding some of your own touches.

This was really very good for such an easy and fairly quick beef burgundy recipe.  I used regular cream of mushrooms soup, doubled the wine and added some beef broth.  I also floured the meat (seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder) before browning it and added some fresh parsley.  My husband devoured it.  Thanks for a keeper, I will definately make this again!

I surprised my husband with this dish and he was so happy. He said it was excellent and extremely close to the one that his favorite restaurant serves. I will definitely make this again.

The sauce was quite good.  I am giving this three stars because the meat was not tender at all.  I don't think I'll make it again for fear that it would still be tough.  But the sauce was good enough to warrant the three stars.  I added extra mushrooms and it was tasty over the noodles I served it with.

Very good.  I used frozen tips - I didn't have time to sear, so I dumped in my crockpot with double sauce ingredients.  I thickened at the end with cornstarch (personal preference), but felt it was missing something.  I finished it a big dose of salt and fresh ground pepper.  I will make again!

Simple to prepare with a pleasing taste, although it seems like it could use something else--perhaps an herb of some sort.  I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic, and I also used top sirloin because that is what I had on hand.  Like others, I increased the burgundy to 1 C. in order to have more yummy sauce.  I served it over garlic roasted mashed potatoes.  Will make again.

This recipe has a lot of potential and is great for improvising.  I used beef spare rib meat I got on sale.  I didn't have any golden mushroom soup (or even regular mushroom soup)--most grocery stores I'm near don't carry it.  I've used both fresh and canned mushrooms in place of the soup and it wsa just as good.  I used a can of beef stock and added a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it after cooking.  I also added garlic and a bay leaf.  Like others have commented, I had to add more water and wine because so much evaporated.  BUT, the taste was wondeful after it was cooked and though I had intended to freeze it for a 'quick meal' it never made it that far and was dinner tonight!  YUM!

My husband liked this recipe better than I did.  It was just ok, in my opinion.  First of all, I thought it smelled awful while it was cooking.  I like wine, but the over-powering smell of the wine cooking really turned me off before I had ever tasted it.  I did end up doubling the sauce after the first hour.  Even simmering on low with the lid on, the sauce just seemed to be cooking away, and I was left with glazed meat instead of meat and sauce.  I think this dish is an aquired taste.

I made this simple dish last night and both me and my husband enjoyed it over mashed potatoes.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. of stew meat and then followed the recipie exact.  I used E&J Hearty Burgundy wine (inexpensive but great tasting)and it was all ready to eat after 1 3/4 hours of simmering.  Yes, I'll make this again, and leftovers will be eaten with pasta tonight.

Great taste!  I added a couple of cloves of garlic with the onions.  I didn't have time to simmer for 2 hrs.  The meat was a little tough.  Next time I will cook in a crockpot.

This meal is great and my kids loved it. That might be because I added one half cup more of wine. I also coated the beef with flour so it thickened the gravy. For a little added flavor I added a cup of Beef broth.

My whole family loved it and that's not typical. I made it as the recipe was written but I just used whatever red wine I had open in the fridge...so flavorful and the meat was very tender. Delicious over egg noodles!

My first time making it, so it could be from Personal error, but we thought it was a bit dry and not enough gravy (sauce). I had to keep adding more liquid and it was still dry.

Followed receipe to a T because it's the first time I made it.  Didn't have any Burgundy wine or red  wine substitutes on hand, so I used Marsala wine..  It was still awesome.  Will be picking up a bottle of burgundy wine for use in the future!!!! I also never use cream of mushroom soup, except for this receipe.  Delicious!!!  UPDATE:  I made again today, this time I used burgendy wine and added 1/2 tsp of basil, oregano and garlic for seasoning.  Plus I added I cup of frozen peas for the last 5 minutes.  Really yummy.

I made it but I am not a big beef fan.  I chose the recipe as beef is high in iron and my husband iron levels were low. The beef was nice and tender.  Liked the sauce.  Rather more vegetables in my meal as the main recipe was lacking vegetables I served it with a spinach salad.

Hubby loved this and said it had to be added to our rotation. Daughters seconded the motion. I doubled everything except the meat as we are sauce hounds in this household. Honestly, I don't see how there would be enough sauce WITHOUT doubling it. We served over the egg noodles and had only this for dinner. It came out to about six servings for us after doubling the recipe. I did add garlic, salt, and pepper. We add that to pretty much every entree we make. I don't often cook recipes that call for canned soup, but I will be cooking this often.

This base recipe is fantastic! The only changes I made were for personal preference (more mushrooms, a little more spice [garlic, a little marjoram, thyme - just a little]...), and dredging the meat in flour before searing,  but the basic recipe is great and would be perfectly fine as-is. Thanks so much for this very simple and delicious recipe.

I have been making this recipe for my family for years now. While the original recipe is quite good, I have made a couple of tweaks. First before I start searing my meat, I use a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to season it. I also add a second can of golden mushroom and double the wine that is called for, as my family loves the sauce over noodles.

Classic comfort food at its finest.  I was not too happy with the thought of the golden mushroom soup, but it made it!  I've seen other recipes with beef broth and it seems too rich.   Anytime you braise beef with sauce, you should always flour and brown first.  I could Eat  that alone!   Thank you for bringing back wonderful memories.

I had to add a lot to it to make it more flavorful.  I followed the basic directions but doubled the beef, onion, butter, soup, and wine.  I added minced garlic and beef bouillon, plus lots of pepper.  Then at the end, I added a cornstarch slurry to thicken and served over rice.  By that point, it was good....but not great.  Would have been very bland to our tastes if I followed the recipe.

I only tasted a few bites but it had a good flavor.  I did what others suggested and sauteed the meat with a little garlic as well.  I would make this again but next time I will probably use a different cut of beef.  I used stew meat, which was the closest thing I could find to sirloin tips, and although it wasn't tough it just didn't have the tenderness I was looking for.  I also seasoned my meat with a little seasoned salt before searing it.  I may not do that next time because, with the golden mushroom soup, it seemed a tad bit on the salty side.  It was perfect for my husband who loves salt, but it was just too much for me.  I cooked egg noodles on the side and made french cut green beans.

Wonderful recipe. It pairs wonderfully w/ whole wheat, egg free noodles (I had to try and make a complete meal w/o adding extra fat since the amount is rather high already) and I think I'll try omitting the butter next time. Definitely worth the 2 hours cooking time!

We loved the flavor, it was easy to prepare but nex time I will make the cubes of meat smaller.  The flavor did not permeate the meat.  We served it over seashell pasta and poured extra sauce on that which we loved. If I was able to I would have given it 4 and a half stars.

This was a simple and delicious dish.I used venison instead of beef since I have a husband who is an avid hunter. He loved it. This is a different way to use venison.

I didn't care much for this, husband likes it with butter on the noodles.  He really enjoyed the leftovers for lunch today.  I'm still trying to figure out what would have made it better, I'm thinking garlic!

Delicious and easy to make.  I too used a full cup of CabSav and it turned out tasty and delicious.  Tender meat that almost melts in your mouth.  I served this with homemade egg noodles also from this site.

It tasted fine the first night, but as we went through the leftovers a day or two later, it turned grey & fishy (?!?!) Would be willing to try again with a "baking buddy" supervising to see what I did wrong.

I made this once and I was disappointed with the lack of flavor.  I did use shallots instead of onions, so maybe that was the flavor mistake.  It was also very rich and thick.... too rich (maybe partly from coating meat with flour first).  It seemed to sit in my stomach for days.  This dish is not for those with sensitive stomachs.

It was really good.  The only changes I made were that I used 1 cup of wine and I also added some garlic while browning the meat, then I added some cream at the end.  I do think there needs to be some more gravy.  I will make it again for sure!

I used brown mushrooms and floured my beef before-hand, and added garlic.
I doubled the wine to a cup and added some beef broth, as per suggested by other reviewers. I didn't have a dutch oven, so I made it in a deep saucepan/skillet with a lid and let it simmer for about 90 minutes. The wine flavour was quite strong, but I loved it.

Great!! I doctored it alittle by adding flour to the tips and "fryng" in a TB of oil, instead of chopped onions, I sliced them long and thin, added portobello mushrooms  with the mushroom soup, added garlic and various spices and used a little less of the wine. Yum Yum!!!!!

This recipie was great! I will definitely use it again. I tweaked it quite a bit--I used canned mushrooms (all I had), added another can of mushroom soup, a can of diced tomatoes and a packet of onion soup mix. I also didn't have Burgundy on hand so I used an ale beer--tasted great! I cooked on high in my crock pot for 3 hours. I would reccomend it to anyone.

Great recipe.  Made some changes though.  I didn't make the original recipe so I don't have anything to compare.  

I added two celery stalks, diced as well as a clove or garlic, minced to be added with the onions.  I used a little more wine, a dash of cognac and I substituted sirloin steaks, cubed for the tips.  

The recipe is a good base for adding more items to one's liking.

This recipe was delicious.  I dont have a dutch oven, so I seared the beef in a skillet.  I then followed the directions, but reduced the remaining cooking time to an hour.  I didnt have egg noodles, so I servedover macaroni.

I thought this was an excellent quick meal.  We had leftover filet and ribeye pieces. I browned them in a skillet with the onions, and leftover portabella mushrooms.  Only added 1 T. margarine.  Also added a bit more wine (Port because that's what I had on hand) because I wasn't sure how long I was going to cook it.  Cooked on top of the stove on simmer for 1 1/2 hrs. Served over rice (had plenty of sauce) with an ear of corn. It was yummy!

FANTASTIC!We loved this so much and will definately make again. I made this 2 times already, once with red cooking wine from the grocery store and once with burgundy wine. We loved both as each had a slightly different taste.  I would like to try the gravy next time in with a pot roast.  Thanks!

My guy bought a ton of beef sirloin at a sale and I have been trying everthig to use it up!  We enjoyed this recipe--it's good comfort food for a cold night.  We like ours saucy, so I added more of all of the liquid ingredients the second time around.  Thanks for an easy recipe Lorrie

I too decided to make this dish for my man.  We absolutely loved it! Maybe I can make the same dish 20 years from now.  Hey...they say " A way to the man's heart is through his stomach."

This was super easy to make, really quick to put together, but of course, takes a while to simmer.  It is worth the wait.  It is one of my boyfriend's and my favorite meals.  We eat it with a small salad on the side.

Not being a seasoned cook, I wasn't 100% sure of of terms used in the directions. I only simmered mine for about an hour and it was well cooked, also the quantities aren't really enough for hungry people like myself and my flat mates, so I suggest more of everything with some salt.
