This is a nice recipe, easy & colorful.  But beware of hot curry paste - it is HOT!  I used 1-1/2T, but would recommend starting with 1T, because if there is too much heat the maple flavor gets lost.  I used plain, unsweetened soy milk mixed with about 1T cornstarch in place of heavy cream, & it thickened up right away.  Next time I make it, I may increase the maple syrup a little, like to a generous 1/4 cup.  I served it over jasmine rice. I liked the concept when I read the recipe, and the recipe met my expectations well.  This one is a definite keeper.

This is my favorite curry recipe. I'm a bit of a wimp, so I used about 1/2 tsp of mild curry powder and it was perfect for me. That is what I love about the recipe, you can add as much or as little of the curry paste or powder to meet your hotness needs. Again, absolutely delicious!

I skip the sugar and use coconut milk instead of heavy cream. It's a sweet dish, but really good! We make it about once a month. Thank you!

I liked this, (though I didn't have the red pepper)I used curry powder as well, as I didn't have the paste, and I only used about 1/2 tsp. (because of the kids) but added more at the table as well as a little salt.  I also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half to cut the fat.  I served with couscous as someone suggested... delicious!

Excellent, flavorful simple dish. I had some poached chicken breasts and was surfing around allrecipes looking for something to do with them. I have always loved a bit of sweetness in my savory dishes. This recipe was just want I was looking for. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used fat free half and half with a tablespoon of Greek yogurt for thickness instead of the heavy cream. I served the chicken with brown rice and sauteed spinach. My husband raved about it. This is a for sure repeat!

I first had this dish in a local restaurant and LOVED it! I went home to try to find its nearest match online.  This recipe closely parallels that one and its delicious to the last bite.  The only thing I would change would be to cut back on the number of peppers a bit.  This dish is best when made with lots of sauce.

I don't like the heat and spice of curry so this was perfect for me!  I loved the sweet, creamy sauce with a hint of curry to add a punch.  I did not use the curry paste and I only used about 3/4 tsp of curry powder (could up it to 1-1/2 tsp) and would reduce the maple syrup to 2 tbsp, but this was delicious!

Made this tonight for dinner, and wow, was it good.
You can taste the maple syrup, but it isn't overpowering and provides a complex but light sweetness to balance the curry.

I did use mild curry paste though, as I was making it for my family who don't like spicy things. i also had to use whipping cream (35%) because the grocery store didn't carry heavy cream, but it still reduced nicely and thickened up for me.

This is definately going to be something I make again.

Yummy! I left out 2 of the peppers as I only had 1 red bell pepper. Used about 3 cups of chicken breast, left out the sugar and substituted 1 can coconut milk as others suggested, used 2 TBS maple syrup and about 2 1/2 TBS medium biryani curry paste since that's what was in the fridge. Could have used more but didn't want to make it too hot for the family. I would cut down the maple syrup to 1 TBS next time as my family found it quite sweet but maybe that's because of the kind of curry I used. I like that there is plenty of curry sauce.  Tip: we ate it with Tandoori naan bread  purchased at the grocery store and heated up by holding it with tongs on top of the gas burner on either side until slight char marks show and then buttered. Served beside steamed green beans, carrots and cauliflower. Thanks for a fast and easy and tasty dish.

Very good! I made it with milk (mixed with a tablespoon of butter and teaspoon of flour) instead of cream since I didn't have any. I'm sure it would be richer with cream, but it was still good my way.

I had to make some alterations and it still turned out wonderful. I didn't have yellow bell and only 1/2 of a red & green one.  I cut back on fat by using milk to replace some of the cream and only used 1/2 the butter and pump spray olive oil. I also only used 2tsp.curry thinking it would be to hot (and if children are eating this I would definanlty cut it back) but next time I will use the full amount. Served over rice with bread

Very good recipe!  I left out the heavey cream and haled the butter to make the meal easier on the treadmill the day after.  My 5 year-old son even liked it.
*Possible veriation is to cook the chicken after rubbing some curry into it.

This may be my all-time favorite recipe from this website!  Following the recipe exactly, it comes out GREAT!  However, it's also a great base if you want to be creative - I've used a variety of different ingredients (carrots, peas, chickpeas, etc), and have tried replacing the cream with either coconut milk.  It turns out wonderful every time - great, great recipe!

I make this all the time and have never rated it.  It truly is an amazing dish.  I have also used mock chicken strips to make this for my vegetarian relatives.  If you are not a pepper fan, definitely cut back on them because they do over power the dish...or, just buy small peppers.  I serve it with penne.  When I bring it to potlucks, I just mix the penne and the chicken together.  It's also one of those recipes that, the longer it sits, the better it tastes.  It also tastes great cold -- almost like a curry chicken pasta salad.  Thanks Matt for this amazing recipe!

Absolutely delicious....I scaled it back to work for one chicken breast.....and omited the sugar....and it was sooo good.  I was feeding myself and my four year old son so used medium (biryani) curry paste and we both loved it.  I tossed it with a multi colored (veggie) spiral noodle.

This was good, but not outstanding.  I think it was too sweet with all the bell peppers, maple syrup, and additional sugar.  I served it with brown rice cooked in my home made chicken broth, which provided a nice contrast to the sweetness.  Fun recipe to try though!

I was pretty skeptical with the whole maple syrup thing, but it really added an awesome flavor. My husband ate the leftovers the next day, and despite the fact that he allegedly "hates" leftovers, he gobbled it up.

BEST CURRY RECIPE EVER!!!! I've tried a lot of different recipes, and this one is a winner. It tastes like it's from a restaurant. I had it saved for a while, curious by the use of maple syrup. But once I finally tried it, it instantly became one of my favorite recipes. 

The main adjustment we made was using coconut cream instead of regular cream, which gives it a bit of an extra flavor. We also used coconut oil instead of olive oil and butter. We'd cook the chicken, flavoring it with a curry spice. Then we'd cook the vegetables (mixed based on what we have or feel like) and season them with a different curry than used on the chicken. Delicious every time!

This recipe was yummy.  I did not have curry paste, so I substituted 1 T curry powder, 1 T ginger and 3/4 T chili powder combined and mixed in with the cream.  It could have been a little spicier, so next time, I think I will multiply this by 1.5.  Also substituted 1/2 c of fat free milk for the heavy cream and it still thickened up nicely.  Also, would consider adding some pineapple in the future to make it more of a 'Hawaiian' dish.  Will definitely make again!

We love this dish and make it all the time! I usually add a little extra maple syrup (about 1/3 cup). I use mild tandori curry paste which gives it a little different taste and makes it less spicy. Soooo good!

Yum Yum Yum! I cooked 2 chicken breasts right in the pan with the peppers & onions and used soy milk (and corn starch to thicken). The butter isn't necessary. Also added cubed sweet potatoes, in fact if you wanted to make this vegetarian, go with sweet potatoes and some chick-peas in lieu of chicken.

VERY TASTY CURRY!  Not too sweet, not too hot.  The maple flavor was there, but very subtle.  I did not have cooked chicken, so just sauteed uncooked pieces with the veggies.  Needed to simmer a bit longer to make sure it was cooked through, so just used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and it thickened up just right.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I made it exactly as instructed and found the spice of the hot curry paste and the sweetness of the maple syrup complemented one another perfectly. Delicious.

This was too sweet for our tastes.  I eliminated the sugar, but will also omit the maple syrup.

Really Good! It wasn’t spicy enough for us. We added chili flakes and next time we want to add a Thai chili. Easy to follow and cook.

This was SO SO good! The combination of maple and curry - yummmmmmmmm. I only had 1 red pepper and cut it and the onion in big chunks. I used coffee cream and Madras paste which were perrrrrfect. I added corn and we absolutely LOVED it.

Very good dish. I agree with most reviewers that it is a bit too sweet even without the sugar. I cut the curry paste down to 1 TBSP form the 2.5 and I will probably increase that next time. Could have had a little more kick, even for the kids! Will definitely make again.

Unbelievable!!! The best curry recipe I’ve ever made. I hate going off recipes on my first try - but was worried on the spiciness so used green paste (2tbsp). Sooooo good. We were fighting over the leftovers. Thank you!!!

One of my favourite recipes. Always a hit with family and friends that come over too. The only thing I change is the curry paste. I use curry powder instead and its phenomenal! I substitute the same amount.

Made as specified, but used yellow curry powder as we cannot handle the heat. So delicious and flavorful! Served it over rice. My hubby who thinks he doesn't like curry went nuts over it.  Oh, and I added mushrooms because I didn't have as many peppers as I thought I did. Will try it another time using coconut milk as one person suggested. I'm trying it tonight with shrimp.

Easy to make and sweet! I used green peppers only, and added in a few garden tomatoes. I also replaced heavy cream with milk and it tasted great! I'd maybe cut down on the sugar as it's quite sweet. Otherwise very good!

I have been making this recipe a couple times a month for years, and I love it! There is only one thing I can suggest to improve it. Omit the sugar and add a can of pineapple tidbits. Drain about half the juice and voila! Perfect dish.

I have made this as stated and did a second batch substituting chic peas for chicken, vegetable broth in place of butter ( using as much as needed to cook with out burning.) and Coconut milk for cream.   I may have had to use a little corn starch or something to make it thicker.   It was a while ago.   I'm going to make it vegan  again for guests tomorrow night since it was such a huge success last time!  
I just remembered that I ran out of curry paste and made a paste with curry powder.  So it was probably not as hot as if done exactly like the recipe.
I served it to approximately 120 people that day.  I had a ton of requests for the recipe...

Great flavor!  I increased the curry paste, and I think next time I will substitute coconut milk for the heavy cream- it was a little too rich for me.  But this is definitely a keeper!  I had searched for recipes that use maple syrup, since my family made our own this year.

Great dish.  I used mild Red Curry Paste.  Next time I might try half hot and half mild.  Needed just a little more spice.  I was worried it would need salt, but it was really flavorful and didn't need it at all.  My kids loved it!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, except I used mild curry paste as I could not find hot curry paste.  The flavor was amazing and complex.  I thought all the peppers would overpower any other flavors, but you almost don't even notice the peppers.  The maple syrup and curry come together in a perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  I served it with Simple Spiced Rice  and Naan from this website.  This is a new favorite at my house and we will enjoy it on a regular basis.

This was pretty good though I did find it a little sweet but that helped offset the spiciness. I changed things up a bit by using powder curry, cumin, ground cardamon, coconut milk and a few other things I found in the cupboard instead of the curry paste. My parents enjoyed it and they don't usually like spicy food. Definitely would attempt this one again.

Pretty good. The only changes made would be that I added curry paste after onions and peppers sautéed, then added chicken pieces, maple syrup etc. I did cut down on curry paste to accommodate kid palette and so not to overwhelm the pure maple syrup flavour. The overall reaction was "yum" and it is a keeper. Thanks!

Fast and delish! We use 10% cream, white fish instead of chicken, and we add diced fresh tomatoes at the end and just let them melt into it. One of our favs.

Made this tonight when I forgot why I thawed out some chicken breasts. Used a Penzy sweet curry powder instead of a paste. Just mixed it in with the cream first and then stirred into mix. Otherwise followed the recipe. My wife and I both loved the flavor.

Very good. I used coffee cream ("half-and-half" in the US) to cut down on the milk fat, but that was the only change I made.
2016 update: I've made this dish several times since my original post.  I have used 2% milk in a pinch when I've been out of coffee cream, but you'll have to cook it a little longer to thicken the sauce. It's still quite acceptable, though.

I'm highly lactose intolerant so I substituted the heavy cream for half a can of coconut milk. Worked out great! This is a sweet curry, and the paste you use will determine the heat. Very customizable. 5 stars!

This dish was very pretty to look at as well as very delicious. The only change I made was to use 2% milk mixed with cornstarch instead of the heavy cream to cut down on the fat. The maple syrup added a very unique taste and made a nice change from the standard stir fry.  I will be making this again.

I was surprised to find a recipe that I had all the ingredients for, except for the cream. My Thia curry paste is quite hot so I started with 1TB, added more. I used coconut milk (very Thia) but should have left out the sugar as this milk is sweet. I didn't have enough pure maple so added 1TB orange-pineapple juice concentrate. It worked! Very good! This is a great recipe and, obviously, very adaptable to all our changes. Thanks Matt!

Loved it!!  We've had this dish twice now and wouldn't change a thing.  Our favourite resort serves Maple Curry Chicken Ravioli and we were looking for a recipe to make it at home.  This recipe is even better than the original and is perfect served over cheese ravioli!

Awesome recipe- with some tweaks. Cooked in about 2-3 Tbls smart balance butter (olive oil has too low smoke point to use for frying/sauteing) used only 2 peppers (red and yellow), only 1/4 onion, added a little wild onion, subbed Stevia for the sugar (will just omit next time, wasnt necessary), just 2 Tbsp maple syrup (all I had left), 1% milk + 1 tbsp cornstarch and thin pat of butter instead of cream, and about 1 1/3tsp curry powder (dont have paste). Next time I will cut the curry powder down to 1 tsp or 3/4 tsp, still a bit hot for us. More maple syrup might counteract more curry though. Oh, also used cooked turkey instead of chicken. Served over barley- was excellent.

Altered the recipe a bit by using a small container of vanilla yogurt (that's what I had on hand) and a 1/2 cup of almond milk instead of the heavy cream. I also left out the onions. Great taste - I never would have thought of combining maple syrup and curry! :)

This is a good recipe -- Easy to prepare and the flavor is certainly intriging. I followed the recipe to the letter, except I cut the hot curry paste to 1/2 what was called for and it was still hotter than I liked.  However, I noticed my husband taking seconds.  Obviously this one is a keeper...thx for the post, Matt!

Easy dish to make.  The kids usually do not care for curry, but the maple syrup gave the dish a twist.  I did not use hot curry paste; I thought a dry curry powder was spicy enough.

It was good.  Not the best curry I have ever had but definatly a different taste.  My husband liked the sweetness of it.
