I followed the recipe except I used Macintosh Apples and I seared the chops before stuffing them to avoid making a mess.  I did not use the name brand ingredients either and it turned out truly delicious.  My boyfriend thought this recipe tasted like a gourmet dish from an expensive restaurant.  I will definitely make this again.
