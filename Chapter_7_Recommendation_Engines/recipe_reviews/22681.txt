One of the best roasts we've ever had.  No changes, no substitutions and tweaking required.  It really bugs me when people totally change a  recipe.  I don't even read long boring reviews.  If you don't like the recipe, then simply make up a new one and submit it.

I have tried cooking pot roasts in a slow cooker before and there was either not enough liquid or the vegetables were too hard.   This was perfect.   I did use Chuck pot roast instead and didn't add the green peppers because of a little one.

DH Loved this meal, next time I will add the peppers.  The meat was tender just used a fork to serve!   Keeping this to use again for sure.

Spectacular!  I like to add a can of cream of mushroom soup (no water added) to the crock right at the beginning.  Later thicken with a flour or corn starch mixture and add a little gravy magic for flavor.  Makes a delicious gravy.  For those who are saying the meat was tough... use a quality pot roast cut and make sure you let the meat cook the entire time stated.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

As another reviewer suggested subbed beer for water.  Also, I prefer red peppers to green.  I roasted this dish in the oven as follows: Placed veggies in roasting pan; pour broth mixture over veggies.  Rub meat with plenty of garlic, salt, pepper & paprika.  Place meat directly on top of veggies.  Meat should not rest in liquid.  (Another option, place beef in another pan along side of veggies/broth.)  Roast in an open pan until meat thermo. reads 150*, usually 45 to 60 minutes.  Remove meat only to platter; cover with foil to "rest" 10 min. until internal temp. reaches medium at 155*.  Return veggies to oven with increased temp. to 425* with red pepper added at this time.  Bake until veggies are tender & lightly browned, approx. 20 min.    Be careful not to dry out the veggies, esp. the potatoes.  It may take a bit of experimenting to get them to your desired doneness.  Meat is best sliced thin across the grain. It is tender & flavorful if not overcooked.  Serve with sauce spooned over slice beef & veggies.  Makes a great leftover beef sandwich the next day.  I have been known to warm leftover beef in bar-b-que sauce for sandwiches the following day.  Cook once but eat twice as a different meal is my favorite way to cook!  Highly recommend this meal.

This is a great recipe, it was my first time using a crock pot and it came out wonderful. I added 3/4 cup of red wine which I highly reccomend. I also skipped the bell peppers.

This was a BIG hit! I think I must also have one of those fast cooking slow cookers - I cooked it on high, and it was done in under 5 hrs. I also put in some mushrooms instead of carrots, and used beer instead of water. This did not last long!

Overall, it turned out great. I loved the garlic cooked in the meat. I added a bouquet garni and some celery for extra flavour. I also thickened the gravy a bit more. I'll definitely use the recipe again.

I made this pot roast for my in-laws (people one always imagines to be their greatest critics) and they loved it - even asked for the recipe! My husband loves it too, and it has become a once a week menu item at our house.

Without question the best roast ever. I seasoned with seasoned salt, pepper and paprika.  Slit 5 garlic gloves, slit, and placed them in pot roast and put in saran wrap in fridge overnight.  Used my dutch oven and placed new potatoes, baby carrots, and 1 1/2 peeled cut onion in bottom.  Seasoned that and added a small can of mushrooms and splash of worstechire.  Placed the roast on top and poured in can of beef broth and cup of red wine.  Added bay leaf, covered and cooked on low for 7 hours.  Moist, tender and scrumptous.  Gravy was cooked bubbly not boiling.

This is a family favorite.  Not for the non-garlic lover.  The good thing is everyone enjoys this so much, everyone's breath will smell like garlic as much as yours.  Great recipe.

I have never cooked a Pot Roast, but since it was my husband's birthday I took the plunge! This recipe was easy and turned out wonderfully! I also used beer instead of water and I cooked it in the oven uncovered for two hours (till 155 degrees) on 350.

I made this recipe with a 2-1/2 lb. chuck roast.  After stuffing it with the garlic cloves, I browned it on one side under the broiler, added the remaining ingredients and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 2-1/2 hours covered.  The meat is so tender and the gravy is so flavorful.  We absolutely love this pot roast.

What can I say - this is wonderful.  I made this today for the family and it was a big hit.  Lots of left overs for sandwiches tomorrow too!  I did not have Bay leaf and I added basil and oregano to the sauce the last half hour.  There was lots of juice, so I removed over half of it two hours before it was done and used that to make a brown gravy.  I just threw in two packs of Schilling brown gravy mix.  We poured that over the meat.  Those are the only changes that I made.  Love this roast!

Although this came out pretty good for pot roast, it was to much work in my opinion.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and browned the meat first, which I do think helped.  I also added more spices: thyme, onion powder, etc, and beef broth instead of water.  I cooked on low 8 hours & everything was done perfectly.  I guess if you have lots of time in the morning to prepare this, then you'll like this recipe.

The meat came out too tough, even after 6 hours in the slow cooker. It tasted like garlic water. Very displeased.

Sorry to say, despite following every step to the letter, I found this to be a bit on the bland side.  Maybe it was just me, but I expected and usually enjoy a much stronger flavor in pot roast.  I'm also surprised it didn't include celery.  I will add that next time if I make this again.

I love crock pot recipes because they are so easy. This was no exception. Toss everything in and in 8 hours we had a great meal. My only concern was with the bouillon cubes, was not sure if they should be tossed in whole or disolved in the water. To be on the safe side I heated the water and disolved the cubes before adding them to the pot. I was also worried this might make the meal too salty but it was not. 

I am not much of a cook so I followed the recipe; except did not have green peppers so I left that out and I only had minced garlic so used that instead of the cloves. Cooked it on low for 8 hours and the meat was so tender it fell apart while I was trying to get it out of the pot. 

This recipe is a keeper! Next time I might try others suggestions to add cream of mushroom soup or make gravy out of the broth/sauce.

This was a wonderful dinner.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added brown gravy mix (low sodium in my case) instead of the beef bouillon and the sauce was wonderful.  I also put the spices and the garlic in the meat 24 hours in advance and let it "marinate."  My husband commented that the peppers that I added at the end as the recipe calls for were really great.  Overall I am sure I will make this again.

I have made this about 3 times now for my family. It is gone in an instant! I do not add as much onion, but I still put in quite a bit. I use baby red potatoes and bagged baby corn. This is a must in the fall and winter!

This was the best pot roast ive ever had. I used a chuck roast instead of top sirloin, Sirloin was too expensive for our budget. But It turned out very flavor full. Not dry at all. Next time i will try with beer instead of water like some others suggested. My husband was in aww after we were done eating it too!

This recipe is great! I used a chuck roast because it was cheaper, and a full cup of beer (Blue Moon) in place of the beef broth and left out the green peppers. Delicious! My husband asked for it again this week already, and we haven't even finished the left overs yet!

This was wonderful...I let the roast cook in my crockpot for about 6 hours on high then added the veggies and cooked on low for another hour or so.  I did thicken the sauce a little so it was more gravy-like.  The garlic really makes a difference!  Thanks for sharing!

OMG. AMAZING!!! I used a larger pot roast, with more garlic inside ( the garlic is very important ) ... Cook it for allll the time specified. Very JUICY and VERY TENDER. I made a gravy out of the juices in the crock pot. And made toasted swiss roast sandwiches under the broiler the next day with the leftovers. ABSOLUTELY the best roast I've ever had and please believe I EAT .

Inserting the garlic into the roast is a mistake. Either to much garlic flavor or not enough. Just throw in the garlic and cook with the rest.

This is delicious!  I did season the meat and vegetables with Johnny's Seasoning Salt (No MSG) in addition to the salt, pepper and paprika.  Also, I used consomme instead of beef broth and the flavor was ever better!  My husband loves when I make this for dinner!

The secret to this yummy recipe is the garlic! I was very impressed at how good this was, plus it was so easy to prepare! My husband loved it too! I don't know if my crock pot gets hotter than most, but everything got done way before dinner time. I removed the veggies, then put everything back together right before dinner was served. I will make this on a regular basis!

I was looking for something to do with left-over, defrosted, floured cubes of beef, and this was my answer! I re-floured the beef, browned it in butter and olive oil, and then proceeded with the recipe - adding a few fewer potatoes and a cup of fine red wine in addition to about 2/3 cup water. I didn't bother with spices, since I used many (including mustard seed) in the flour coating the beef. I only used 2 bullion cubes (1 beef, one veggie) and didn't bother adding the pepper at the end. We just loved the moist texture of the meat, and the flavor overall was superb. Now that I know roughly how much liquid to include, and how long to cook the meat, I'll be able to make all sorts of variations on this recipe. Thanks so much!

I am a meat cutter and I would never use a top sirloin which is a steak for a pot roast!! 
  You should use a chuck roast or a shoulder roast for a pot roast not a steak roast!

WOW!!! The first time I made this I made it as the recipe states and it was great. The next time I made it I didn't have potatoes to put in right away so I put everything else in. I let it cook just as stated above but made mashed potatoes and let me tell you that roast was to die for. It's very juicy!!!

We enjoyed the flavor very much...and it was quick and easy to assemble. I didn't have any green pepper, so we just skipped that part. The left over broth went into the freezer for a beef soup.

Great taste...decided to make this in the oven instead as I only had a 2 pound sirloin tip roast. Omited the green peppers(had none). Cooked in the oven covered at 325F for 3 hours.Uncovered for the last 30 min and basted it occaisionally. Perfect.

Wow!  This was just fantastic.  I did add some celery and used fresh thyme and rosemary instead of the paprika because I had it on hand.  I subbed 1 cup water with the three bullion cubes and then added 3/4 c red wine.  I did thicken the broth a bit with some cornstarch.  Cooked it on low for about 10 hours because I had to start it early.  Now I've shredded what was left and poured the remaining au jus over the shreds so we've got sandwiches one night!

This was wonderful!  I made a couple of changes, based on preference.  I used a few more veggies... fresh mushrooms & parsnips.  No green peppers.  I minced about half of the garlic, and tossed the raw veggies in the minced garlic, and a steakhouse seasoning spice.  One can of double rich campbells beef broth (no water).  The rest of the garlic I slivered and tucked in the meat, and seasoned the meat as directed. Veggies on the bottom, meat on the top. A splash of red wine over the top (about 1/2 cup).  When the liquid started to submerge the roast, I drained some of the juice using a ladle.  The roast was so tender, we could cut it with a fork.  And both the veggies & the meat had a wonderful flavor!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This recipe was easy to make and did make the house smell great.  My husband liked the recipe very much.  I found that the meat was very tender, but thought that it could be more flavorful.  Next time I make, I will definitely add some red wine as one of the other reviewers suggest.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I had to add some of my own spices to make it really good.  It did turn out great but I added more garlic, some oregano, and some basil towards the last hour because I thought it was rather bland.  I also had to add some more beef base in order to make gravy (I made mashed potatoes instead of the yukon gold)  In the end, everyone had seconds and believe me, I have a very tough crowd.

This had very good flavor.  The meat was a little dry for my taste.  I ended up making a beefy onion gravy and pouring that over the meat.  It turned out to be pretty good.

Mmmm.  Delicious.  I was skeptical about adding the green pepper, but my husband and I thought they made the meal!  The only change I'll make next time is cutting back on the salt and/or use low sodium beef bouillon.

I tried this recipe once before, and brought it over to friends who had just had a baby. Hubby and I had it for dinner that night too- we loved it! And our friends said it was by far the best roast they have had. I didn't save it then, but bought a top sirloin on the weekend, and luckily I found it again, and it is cooking in the crockpot as we speak. I didn't change a thing. We love garlic, so we add a couple more cloves. I serve it with roasted mini red potatoes and green beans w/almonds. Just perfect.

Just made it for the first time and when I went to add the peppers in the last half hour, I tasted the gravy and was a little disappointed with the bland flavor so I scooped out a few cups of the liquid, added a tablespoon of wercheshire sauce and poured it back over the pot roast and vegetables.  It also begged me for a handful of mushrooms so I complied.  It was fantastic!  Thanks dontcookmuch.

Just made this today, it was great, only thing I did was add fresh mushrooms when I added the green pepper.

Great recipe.  Very flavorful.  Like a few of the reviewers suggested, thickened the gravy with some corn starch and added a little kitchenbouquet for color and flavor.   Delish!

This was a very easy and satisfying meal. I substituted green beans for the potatoes, since I am trying to lower my carb intake.

I didn't think it was over the top or anything, but it was definitely good.  All the spices and broth made the potatoes the best I've ever had, that is for sure!  The roast was just like any other good roast I've had.  I will make it again because it was super easy.

pretty good stuff.. a bit to much onion & potato (overstuffs the crock).. needs a bit of extra liquid.  Would really do well w/ a bit of bbq flavor in the cooker or dry rubbed on the meat as it's a touch bland.

the meat was fall apart tender! it was really good! needed a bit more seasoning for me. I don't think I added enough garlic but that's my own fault. i didn't use straight water, i just used beef broth, a little cooking wine and 3/4 bottle of shiner(it was all we had lol) i also added onion powder and celery salt for more flavors. yummy!

This worked very well for me.    I used half beef broth, half red wine for the liquid and did NOT use bullion cubes, just added a bit more salt, sprinkled over the veggies, in addition to the salt rubbed into the meat.  Also, used red bell pepper, not green and tossed the garlic cloves whole into the crock pot with the veggies rather than insert them in the meat.  The best change I made was to use real Spanish smoked paprika (pimenton) rather than hungarian or other paprika.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out quite tasty! My pot roasts are usually missing flavor and turn out a little bland but this one turned out wonderful.  I still think it needed extra salt but overall, very good and worth it!

This recipe was wonderful! Really great. I did not use a Sirloin roast since I cook for only 2, I just used a rump roast, but it worked great.

Will definitely make this again.

A pretty good roast recipe and it IS very simple to make.  When I "infused" the roast, I did add some rosemary with the garlic and omitted the grn peppers.  The results wasn't amazing but very satisfying.

This was very good. The crockpot made the meat so tender--no knife needed...and how nice to come home and the meal is already cooked! Next time, I may use crushed garlic instead. I didn't taste much of the garlic flavoring using the slivers.

Excellent! Great, refreshing twist to the age-old pot roast. The vegetables turned out very moist and my kids devoured them. I cooked mine in a slow cooker overnight (10 hours) with an extra 1/2 cup of water and it just falls apart (terrific!). No need to add anything to make gravy, it is great on its own.

I used this recipe as a base for general pot roast.  I added an extra bay leaf and thyme to add extra flavor, cut back on the amount of garlic slices pushed into the roast and threw a couple cloves into the water to stew with the veggies.  I also used my injectaflavor to inject a mixture of beef broth, thyme and garlic minced together.  Husband couldn't say enough things about the roast, it smelled delicious all day and the gravy it made was excellent.  I kept sneaking sips of the gravy in the last two hours of cooking.

I believe that I may have over-cooked this as mine came out a bit dry.  My crockpot does seem to run a little hotter than others.  Great flavor overall, though.  The vegetables turned out great.   If you're looking for a good stand-by-from-scratch (no soup mixes, etc) Pot Roast recipe for the slow cooker, this is a fine one to start with and build upon!  Thanks!

It was fine but not great.  I must have done something wrong as there was not as much flavor as I anticipated by looking at the ingredients.  I may try again as so many reviews are 4's and 5's.

Good, not great. The best part of this recipe was the carrots and potatoes - I’ve never enjoyed cooked carrots before and my kids wouldn’t eat potatoes unless they were mashed or french fried, but we loved these veggies! I did add yellow bell pepper strips an hour before the roast was done and I don’t think they really added anything of value. I have other roast recipes that turn out better than this one.

Recipe looked great but mine cooked faster than expected so it was surprisingly not juicy for a slow cooker roast.  It also had no flavor even though I seasoned it over night and pan seared it. Probably will try again but unsure what to do differently.

Even my roast-loving husband wasn't too keen on this recipe.  I cooked it on high for 6 hours.  Even added an extra cup of red wine based on other reviews.  My slow cooker is typically reliable...but the carrots and potatoes were hard.  We had to cook them in a separate pot before we could eat them.  Won't be making this again.

This was very good but very salty. And I just realized I forgot the bay leaf! That's so unlike me! I'll make again but will find a way to reduce the salt.

Delicious and savory.  Used a shoulder roast, and used celery instead of green peppers due to personal preference.  Turned out wonderfully.

WOW -i am so disappointed in this recipe! I followed it as is thinking after that I'd try some of the suggestions in the comments - but my meat was dry and some pockets tasted bland, some tasted decent and others had too much garlic. 
This was a piece of beef that I cut and used half in another recipe and it was quite tender, so I don't think it was my cut of meat. 
If I try it again, I would rub with some flour and brown it first, add some strained tomatoes, balsamic vinegar or something to help break down the meat.  
It really doesn't even get another try from me though.

Left out the green peppers, I'm not a fan of them, used less potatoes & more carrots.  I've made this several times and usually omit the water and substitute beer or red wine, whatever I have on hand.  Tucking the garlic slivers into the meat is a MUST, it really makes this recipe!  Thanks!

Maybe it was my slow cooker or me, but my roast had fallen apart after 5.5 hours in the slow cooker on high.  I had to turn it into a stew.  And overall, a rub of garlic, salt, and pepper and cooked in the oven tastes better. Minced 1/2 the garlic and used as a rub and sliced other 1/2 and inserted into roast.  Won't try again.

Very tasty and so easy to do...I omitted the green peppers and instead of slivering the garlic, I minced it and rubbed it right onto the roast.

Tasty, but could do without the peppers. We didn't have quite enough paprika, so we made up the difference with old bay seasoning, but left out the bay leaf. The store was out of top sirloin, so we ended up with a lean rump roast, and it worked well. Didn't have beef broth, so did all water, and added an extra bullion cube. Overall, it was good, but the rub on the meat was the best part!

I opted to cook this on low for eight hours, and the meat was pretty dry, but it did have a nice flavor to it.  I might experiment with it again to try for a more moist cut of meat.  I served it with the juice on the side and that helped make up for the dryness.

This needed way more seasoning and the gravy needed to be thickened up and flavored.  After a lot of flavor adjusting is was OK.  I would not make this recipe again.

I didn't use a sirloin roast, instead it was a beef round roast. I also increased the amount of potatoes and carrots along with beef bouillon. I didn't have the cubes or beef stock, so I increased the amount of beef base. I cooked it for 2 and a half hours in the roaster.  We didn't have to use steak knives either because it was falling apart. So, for the one who couldn't cook, excellent recipe. Thank you

I made this. I followed recipe to the letter. It was delicious, and hearty.  I gave it 3 stars because there are many ways to make a pot roast and while this is a good recipe, there was really nothing special about it.

Good basic recipe for any chunk of beef but I think it still needs a carrot or two, celery is good  also (especially for those that do not care for bell peppers).

extremely disappointed with this. cooked in slow cooker for 8 hours on low, potatoes were still hard, russet potatoes, roast was unedible in our opinion, sirloin tip I didn't add the green peppers but I don't think it would have made a difference

I followed the recipe without changing a thing.  Overall it was okay.  It didn’t have the flavor we expected.  The recipe from my pressure cooker book was better so I will not make this again.  It was worth a try. though.

Soft and well cooked, despite my making an error and cooking on low for 6 (well, 7 actually) hours.

I found it quite spicy due to the pepper so I would add only 1/2 tsp next time.

My kids ate the meat but weren’t keen on the potatoes or the veg. The potatoes were absolutely delicious and incredibly soft.

Well - - its was wonderful! I did make some changes. We have always  browned our roast (deer roast...whatever) really well on all sides  in a cast iron skillet on the stove top with either olive oil or  fry a strip of bacon and use that grease. We also always  put several garlic cloves  chunked up in the grease as well. When I removed the roast from the skillet and placed it in the crock pot I added one can of  Campbell's  cream of mushroom  and a can of cream of mushroom soup mix and a pkg of Lipton dry onion soup mix. Add all my skillet goodies including what little grease and charred remains to crock pot. Slip some garlic toes into the meat as well.  Add  8 oz of beef stock, slight shake of Slap ya mama and black pepper.  5 hours later add your canned new potatoes and carrots (if at camp) or sliced up fresh potatoes are better.  When you come in from the hunt - - its chow time.

With the exception of adding 1/2 cup more broth, I made this exactly as written.  Although the meat (I used sirloin tip roast) was very tender, but not ‘fall apart’ like some reviews stated.  The potatoes and carrots were still very firm after 8 hours on low in the slow cooker so I had to cook them in the microwave for another 20 minutes.  It was all very tasty and I will try it again but cook it on ‘high’ next time.

Used cab- sauv red wine (3/4 cup) instead of water) and adjusted the flour a bit for thickening. Loved it. We'll make it again soon. By the way, my son who is a chef in a restaurant in AZ is visiting us in FL. He thought I did a good job when he ate it.

I must have done something wrong.  I followed this recipe exactly as written, and although it smelled amazing, my husband and I found the meat bland and there was very little gravy.  I thickened the gravy with flour and broth and it came out with a pleasant but very mild flavor.  I'll try this recipe again, because I think it could be wonderful, but as written it was pretty dull.  I'm going to double the veggies and seasonings next time.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

Super easy for pretty tasty comfort food!   Keep an eye on the meat.   My slow cooker follows most recipes to a Tee, but in this one, the roast was done after just 4hrs on high.   Extra points for a quick cook time, but wouldn't want to have left the timer on for 6hrs if I wasn't home.   I could be a one off though.

Positive:  easy, tasty, onions were particularly delightful

Negative:  my meat was a little dry, so I might dial back the cooking time to 7 hours on low next time; sauce was thin, so I would allow time to mess with that next time.  I think the meat needs a sauce/gravy.  The outer edge is delicious with the seasoning & garlic, but the center was a bit bland.  (Kids liked it, so that's a plus.)

Tips:  I did save the 'sauce' to make a cheater's version of French Dip tomorrow -- perfect au jus for dipping a sandwich; when you have a little wine left after a party, freeze it in 1/2 cup and 1 cup containers for recipes like this that only need a small amount.  Alcohol doesn't freeze super solid, so it defrosts fast.

Changes:  left out carrots and green peppers (taste preference), substituted red wine for the water (flavor enhancer), used bigger pieces of onion so picky eaters could avoid them easily.  That last change turned out to be a good idea, as I would hot have eaten the onions if they were diced up, but the larger pieces were easy to plate and enjoy.

We really liked this! I did not use green peppers. I did use red wine with broth and I browned the meat first (my preferences). Next time I would add a thickener. I followed the recipe other then what is noted

DELICIOUS!!! I didn't have any bell peppers so they were omitted, and I added 8 - 10 roasted garlic cloves to the liquid I needed to use up. The juices made a great gravy after thickening, and hubby and I ate WAY too much - Thank goodness for leftovers.  :)

Excellent, moist and flavourful. Used white wine instead of water, and used a few splashes of  browning and seasoning sauce as I didn't have beef bullion cubes on hand. No time for the slow cooker so roasted at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 45 minutes (3+ pound top sirloin roast). Took it out at 140 degrees and after it had rested was just a tad too medium done (just a little pink in the middle) but just the way my better half likes it.

Super easy and VERY juicy.  I used beer instead of water and used extra liquid so that it covered the vegetables.  I only gave it four stars because there was some spice/flavor missing and I can't figure out what it is.  Oh well, it was a very easy dinner so I am sure I will make it again.

Great flavor. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I just added minced garlic to the beef broth. I used a full can of beef broth and dissolved the beef bouillion cubes in the water before pouring them in the slow cooker.

This was just okay. I wanted to add red wine but had none in the house so added 1/2 can of beer. On the upside, the meat was very tender without a lot of fat you would get in a chuck roast. But the downside is it's not very flavorful - needed more seasonings.

Mine turned out dry as well! Really dry. The garlic flavor was very prominent, and the veggies turned out nicely. Why my roast turned out dry, I don't know. There was a lot of liquid left in the cooker, so I submerged the rest of the roast and hopefully tomorrow I will get a juicy bit.

This was good, but mine got dry.  I'm not sure why.  I actually used 2 cans of beef broth to cover everything - no water or cubes.  I do think if I would have minced the garlic, as others suggested, that it would have tasted better.  Tip for next time!

This was an okay meal.  I followed the recipe pretty much.  Next time I think I may add a splach of wine with the water to add a bit more flavor.  Won't be one of our favorites, but is something I will try again.  Maybe with some small changes I will add it to our favorites.

This is very tasty! I used top round roast. My husband put in pressure cooker to tenderize it. Next time, I'll brown first and see if that takes it over the top. Will make again.

I cooked this in an electric pressure cooker.  Excellent.  I made minor changes due lack of ingredients.  I used dried chopped onions, forgot to add the garlic,and didn't use green peppers. Instead of the spices I used Mrs. Dash.

Everyone enjoyed this roast. I didn't have any bouillion so I omitted the water and used all beef stock. Next time I will make deeper slits so the garlic does'nt ooze out. very good recipe.

YUMMY!  One of the best pot roasts I've ever made.

The meat was incredibly tender, and so full of flavor.  The garlic wasn't overwhelming at all!!

Definately a keeper!!!
