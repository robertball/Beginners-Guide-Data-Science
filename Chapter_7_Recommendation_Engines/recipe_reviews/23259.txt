A simple dish which is easily tailored to vegetables on hand.  I prefer to delete one onion and add a red pepper.  I threw in some sliced black olives and sliced mushrooms for good measure.  Additionally, I used 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to 'jazz' it up a bit.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!  I was a little hesitant to try them because there wasn't a lot of variety of vegetables.  After I did try it...WOW!!!  I omited the garlic salt, onion salt and cayanne pepper (because I didn't have them) and added fresh garlic.  TERRIFIC!!!

It was tasty, once it cooked, but it took about 25 minutes longer than the recipe said to get the potatoes done.

I think I did something wrong...the potatoes were raw and the dish smelled/tasted pretty awful.  Maybe I'll try this again and use a different brand of Italian dressing (used Wishbone this time), and will also bake the potato pieces for awhile before adding to the dish.

This was easy to prepare and tasty but I agree with others in the fact that the cooking time is off and it does take much longer but other than that, I have no complaints. This is one that you could change up and add any fresh veggie you have on hand to the potatoes (I added celery) for variety. I topped mine with cheese, crumbled bacon, and green onions...yum!

Does not specify how large the cubed potato and sliced carrots should be and took far longer to cook than called for in the recipe. It was a decent side dish once it cooked.

I thought these veggies were very tasty. Just watch because the green pepper seems to cook a lot quicker than the rest of the veggies. I also didn't add the potatoes to this recipe.

Nothing to write home about...a good dish, in need of some spice.  I cut down on the onion and upped the pepper.

Raw potatoes, overpowering onion, all veggies colorless and half-raw. I cut up the potatoes into tiny cubes and they were still raw - VERY disappointing!
The marinade was good, though - will try it out on something else.

I didn't enjoy the vegetables, my family and guests did enjoy them.  I will use less spice next time and I will leave out the green pepper. I had to micorowave the vegetables for three minutes, as the potatoes still needed to be cooked further.  I will partially cook the vegetables next time, before placing them in the oven. This is a good way to use up left over vegetables - most vegetables can be used.

My husband and I liked the taste but the potatoes were raw and I had to microwave them and then roast them in a pan.
