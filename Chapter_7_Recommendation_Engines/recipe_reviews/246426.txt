Very interesting and quite unique answer for flatbread. It's so easy to put together, too. As a pizza, it is tasty. It's best eaten with a fork because it remains a bit soft and pliable. I served half of the flatbread with the yogurt sauce and toppings on the side. Definitely an incomparable addition to your table and definitely guest-worthy. Thank you for the recipe.
