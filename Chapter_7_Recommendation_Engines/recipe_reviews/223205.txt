I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because the flavor was yummy but the way the recipe is written, they came out an ugly mess.  I had to piece together some of the better parts just to take the photo.  When I first took them out of the oven, I thought that it would have to go straight in the trash...but then I took a bite and wow!  Such a good flavor.  I served them up for the kids and they were gone in seconds.  There needs to be a better way to prepare the pudding mix, sugar and butter so that it creates a glaze, rather than a clump of powder.  I will tweak and make again in the future.

I did like the instructions said  by putting the pudding and sugar at the base and then adding the frozen rolls and the rest of the ingredients   - it took forever to bake, and then the pudding and sugar were not melted when I turned it over - plus how many rolls are 12 ounces - the packages I saw are much bigger  I’m not happy with the results

I knew better but I followed the recipe anyway. One cannot dump the sugar and pudding into the bottom of the pan and expect this to work.  After it cooked, I flipped it onto a platter only to find a big, far from gooey, mess.  All you could taste was big lumps of sugar.  Use another recipe where you roll each piece of bread in butter, sugar and pudding. Very disappointing

It has you putting all the sugar and pudding in the bottom of the pan and then adding the dough. It should say to put it evenly on the bottom and between layers because all the sugar and pudding just stayed at the bottom and didn’t melt.

My son made this for the family of five and it's all gone within an hour. It's creamy and soft. Delicious and I will make it again.
