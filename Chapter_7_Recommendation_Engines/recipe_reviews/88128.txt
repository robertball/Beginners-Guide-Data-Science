Have made this many times, often quadrupling the serving size to have extra to freeze.  It gets even better with the addition of sausage (I use turkey sausage, but any other type would be delicious as well), and I love garlic so I add much more than the amount listed here.  I also am a huge bean fan so I like a denser soup that gives a heap of beans in every bite in addition to broth, and I typically add one extra can of beans for every can of tomatoes/mushroom soup (usually red beans or something that will give a bit more color).  The best way to enjoy this is to get the tomatoes, beans, and soup started simmering and dump in frozen/pre-peeled cooked shrimp, and let it all slowly heat while you saute the celery, onions, and garlic.  Then dump the saute into the pot and keep on low-medium heat so all the flavors sufficiently diffuse and the shrimp slowly cook...then put it away and let it refrigerate overnight.  This condenses the flavors even more, allowing the garlic and spice to really infuse the broth, and it just gets even better and more flavorful the longer it sits.  Have even considered adding a can of corn to complement the sweetness of the sausage.  This is just such an intensely deep recipe if you allow all the flavors to meld together long enough -- don't eat it the same day you cook it, as a general rule.  Also helps if you cut back on the amount of water added to make a thicker and more intense broth.

Very easy to make and a nice flavor. I served it over angel hair pasta and used more shrimp than it said because I was using up a bag of frozed pre-cooked shrimp. A bit spicy for the kids, but the husband added tabasco.

We wanted a hot & spicy soup, and adapted this recipe accordingly. Turned out even better than expected. Made the following changes; 1/2 large sweet onion, chopped for green onions, 1 can RoTel Diced Tomatoes w/ Habaneros for diced tomatoes w/ green chilies, beef broth for water, condensed golden mushroom soup for cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 lb. shrimp/1/2 lb. sea scallops/Aidell’s Chicken & Apple sausage, 3 links for 12 ounces shrimp. The scallops, shrimp, and sausage were first rubbed w/ Badia Blackened Redfish seasoning (‘Blackened Seasoning Mix’ from this site or some other seafood rub you prefer also works), and then seafood and sausage were sautéed separately from the broth given different cooking times for each. The seafood/sausage was added to the soup after it finished cooking, and allowed to rest for 10 or so minutes. This soup is hot and spicy so it would not be suitable for some, especially young children. This goes toward the top of our list of most favorite soups.

Great flavor and really easy to make. I put it over rice and it was delicious. Next time I think I'll leave out the water to make it thicker and more saucy.

My husband really liked this. I made a few changes and would have to say this is one of the best shrimp recipes I've tried. And I am not a big fan of shrimp, so that is saying something.

Loved the thicker consistency.  I used Old Bay and dried cilantro instead of the dill (not measuring either) and it was excellent.

I had searched for a recipe with shrimp and fresh dill and thought this sounded easy and tasty. While it was definitely easy to make, I actually was disappointed in this recipe. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't have celery and I used tomatoes with green peppers and onions and added a can of green chiles. I took the suggestion of serving this over rice. I thought it was bland. I tried adding tobasco sauce, which helped a little, but this just didn't have enough flavor for me. I probably won't make this again.

This soup was sooo easy to make!  I don't consider myself a good cook, but this soup came out delicious!  I omitted the pepper and used whole canned plum tomatoes.  I will be making this soup anytime I have shrimp!

So simple, yet so good. Since I don't like spicey food, I used tomatos without the chilis and substituted red bell peppers for the green onions. Delicious!

This recipe was excellent. The only thing that I changed was adding house made Italian seasoning instead of the dill. I will definitely make this again.

I wanted to make a spicy shrimp soup, so this seemed like the best thing to try. I followed the recipe closely except I added a 10oz package chopped mushrooms and an extra can of beans and a can of corn to make it thicker. I ate my concoction the same night I made it, and it was bland- but the flavor is about 2x more pronounced now the next day. I am almost certain you'll be disappointed if you do not let the soup rest for at least 12 hours in your fridge. All in all, I liked it a lot, and there's a lot of wiggle-room for personal tastes.

This was REALLY good! My husband had it the next day again for lunch and said that the flavors were still distinct and it was even better.   I had used the little popcorn salad shrimps that were frozen, and so the shrimps added a little more water than I would have liked.  So if adding frozen shrimp, reduce the water to a half cup.  It's not too thick, it works well.  This is going in my fav's file for sure. And super easy!

I really liked the way this turned out! I had to change it a little because canned tomato with green chilies isn't spicy at all, so I don't know where the spicy was supposed to come in. I subbed a bit of chopped onion for the green onion and added a jalapeno for a kick with the celery and sautéed everything for a bit longer before adding the garlic followed by the canned beans and tomato with chipotle (for spice), the canned soup( next time I'd prefer to make a substitute for a better flavor) and 2x's the water but added a sleeve of Pho Veggie Broth. Brought it to a boil before adding dill and then simmered for 20min or so then added the shrimp and green onion. Will definitely do this again..but with the extra spice. Thank you for the inspiration!

THIS WAS GREAT!!! AND SUPER EASY!!! I adjusted the recipe as suggested: I added cider-apple chicken sausage, cabbage(canned),  and scallops and I also subbed adding tomatoes and habaneros. The canned red beans were New Orleans style that added spice and flavor too. I cooked the sausage and the scallops but added the shrimp raw.  This recipe is a keeper and a sharer! THANK YOU FOR MAKING A RAINY TUESDAY NIGHT ROCK!

Easy and really tasty!  Next time I would use smaller shrimp because I ended up cutting them into smaller pieces so they'd fit on the spoon. Also added some seasoning salt and Old Bay Seasoning.

I added an extra celery stalk, used yellow onions as I didn't have green and some scallops because I didn't have enough shrimp. I like the consistency the taste is fine but it's not particularly spicy.

I added an uncured andouille sausage link, Cajun spices instead of dill. I don't use cream of anything soup because they have msg in them, so I substituted 10 oz of cashew milk with 2 tbs cornstarch whisked in it that I added at the end. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, and probably doubled it since I held back the milk until the end. Served it over some left over quinoa. awesome! DH ate almost the whole pot!

I found this bland as written. Now some of it might have been user error, I used dry dill and added extra chicken broth and veggies which probably diluted the flavor. I made several additions and it did turn out tasty with these spices added: cayane pepper, chilli powder, onion powder, celery salt, black pepper, lime juice and a few dashes of Worcester sauce.

So, off the bat I wasn't an immediate fan but the next day this tastes a lot better. I don't think it was spicy at all but I have a very high tolerance to that. This is an interesting dish, I added ground turkey so it was a lot like a chilli for me which wasn't bad, just different.

Very quick and easy to make. I added a diced jalapeño and diced white onion. I agree with others that adding crumbled sausage would be a good addition, and plan to next time. Also, adding a cup of sour cream would really make this a rich soup.

Delicious spicy dish!  I left out the celery (I didn't have any on hand) and the water.  Served it over rice.  I also added sliced turkey sausage links and more spices (cayenne & red pepper).  Tasted like something you'd find served in a fine New Orleans restaurant.  We all loved it!  Next time I'm going to double the recipe and freeze half, like somebody else here suggested.

I use vegetable broth instead of water, and follow the tip for using Old Bay instead of dill.  I add a squeeze of cilantro (tube stuff), a shake or two of cumin, and a shake or two of Tony Chachere.  

I fix this soup the day after I cook macaroni for other things.  I save back some of the noodles just for this soup.  I dump them in the pot along with the frozen shrimp and let it all heat up together.

Flavor is great!  

Thanks for posting the recipe, we love it!

I don't use/like canned soup, so I used this Cream Soup Base (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Cream-Soup-Base/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=cream%20soup%20base&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe) instead, with half the butter. Forgot the garlic and my tomatoes did not have green chiles, but still DELICIOUS. I put in asparagus too, did not add water.

The combination of ingredients listed here scared the life out of me. I had to try and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out, it's a very good soup! I added some veggie broth to the pot because we like our soup soupy and not dense. It was an all around winner!! We will be making this again for sure.
