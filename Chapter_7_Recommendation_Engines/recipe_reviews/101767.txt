I used homemade greek vanilla frozen yogurt, I made no other changes. For us, this served TWO (split in half) and those were small shots. As is, it was a tasty ice cream "shot". Next time, I'd up the creme de cacao.

I used top shelf ice cream and light crème de cacao.  Very light and smooth. I may add more crème de cacao next time.  There will be a next time:)
