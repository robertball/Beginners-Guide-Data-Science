This was good.  I minced the bell pepper and doubled it.  I also minced 3 green onions and added it to the meat mixture.  The meat was a little wet and difficult when I was forming the "legs" so I added some breadcrumbs to the mix.  Worked perfectly. Teenage boys, 3yr old, and 1yr old all loved it. I only had ground veal, no pork. Was very good.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I grew up in Cleveland’s suburbs and your City Chicken recipe was the only one I ever had.  The tender ground meats shaped into perfect drumsticks, sometimes refrigerated overnight, in a coat of home made breadcrumbs and eggs.  Well, there was nothing like it.  My sister and I would hang out in the kitchen waiting for the scrumptious legs to drip and cool enough for us to grab the first ones.  I admit we never used crushed pineapple and we used veal, a tiny bit of ground chicken and a tiny bit of ground round.  So, I decided to try your recipe exactly as written.  It was delicious and better than my childhood memories.  Next time I’m doubling the recipe so we have more than one meal.  Thank you for this genuine gift.  Every City Chicken recipe I came across was Pittsburgh style, meaning chunks of pork arranged on a skewer.  Your recipe is the real deal and one I plan to make again and again.  Yummmmmm!
