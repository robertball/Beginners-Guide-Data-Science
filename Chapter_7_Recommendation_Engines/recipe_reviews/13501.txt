This cranberry salad was wonderful!  So much so that my guests on Christmas found themselves filling up on this rather than meat and potatos.  Full of texture and flavor much like that of my grandmothers.  Loved it.  Thanks Mary.

This turned out to be awesome! I would give it 5 stars but I had to change some things according to what ingerdients I had. I used cranberry jello, can pineapple chunks, sweetened cranberries, and cherries. I didn't have an orange so I used a can of mandarin oranges. I also used only 1/2 cup sugarand a little less water------it was soooo good!!!

I got this recipe from this site several years ago and I've made it every Thanksgiving since.  My cousins love it and always take some home because this recipe makes a lot.  I've never been a big cranberry sauce or cranberry salad eater, but now, I just can't have Thanksgiving without this salad.  It takes a lot of prep with chopping the apples, grapes, and orange, but it's worth it.  It's also good with some pecans added.

I loved this.  I peeled my orange and all I had was cheery jello and I totally forgot to add the apples.  It was still really good!

This is almost like the one my mother made (from back in the 50's) -she never gave me the recipe, but she used black cherry jello and added Coke to the jello (in place of or partially for the cold water). She also cooked the cranberries til popped and cut up a peeled orange and chopped celery and walnuts. If anyone has this recipe -please let me know! This one comes really close.
