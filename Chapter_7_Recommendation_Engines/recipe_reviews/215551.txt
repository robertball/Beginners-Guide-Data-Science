Great summer recipe! The only thing I did differently was use pickled ginger instead of fresh because that was what I had on hand. It was Delicious! Next time I'll pick up some fresh ginger to compare. The longer the gazpacho refrigerates, the better. We loved the contrast between sweet and spicy; and the chunks of watermelon in each bowl is a nice touch, I used extra. Yum! Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe, Julia!

Had very ripe watermelon and several other ingredients in this recipe that needed to be used up.  This was a great way to avoid throwing them away, and a pleasant surprise because we REALLY enjoyed this gazpacho.  There is a fair amount of chopping prior to going into the blender.  I left the texture a little chunkier than it would have been at 30 seconds, but it turned out perfect for us.  It is a refreshing summer menu item and  does need time in the fridge for the flavors to meld.  There are leftovers for tomorrow, and I suspect they'll be even better; garnished with a dollop of  yogurt.

outstanding. i modified it two ways which i think made it even better. 1. i added 1 shallot to the one onion. 2.  i used a whole ripe pineapple (removing the core and exterior first) which i pureed in my cusinart. i did this separately and then added the pureed juice to the mixed ingredients. for presentation i cut out watermelon balls and added the sprig of mint. letting it set for an hour or two is fine, but i found it was even better after refrigerating for at least 3 hours. on the 2nd and 3rd days it was even more fantastic. other recipes i reviewed used tomatoes also. DO NOT USE TOMATOES with this recipe. it takes away from the uniqueness of a great cold soup. my wife does not eat watermelon but loves this soup. i now have served it to over 20 people. ALL LOVED IT. thanks Julia jeff lantz

This has a good flavor and is a great alternative to the traditional gazpacho.  Blending for 30 seconds was too much in my blender so I reduced the time.

This was a very refreshing summer recipe! It was a good way to use out some watermelon that I had left over. I just don't think that it was worth the time that it took to prepare it and I don't think that I would make it again.

This was absolutely delicious.  A wonderful combination of sweet and spicy.  I skipped the pineapple juice because I didn't have any handy, and I substituted cayenne pepper for the jalepeno as I didn't have one of those on hand either.  I had tried a watermelon gazpacho at a local restaurant and they shared that secret substitution.  It turned out to be a very successful.  I look forward to trying it with the jalepeno next time.

This is DELICIOUS and very refreshing.  I made a few changes--I used agave nectar instead of honey, and one small serrano pepper instead of half a jalapeno.  Also I used a little more mint and ginger...maybe 1 T more of each.  But I kept the rest of the recipe the same--and really this is one of the more delicious easy-to-make summer foods I've prepared! GREAT recipe.

Delicious! I’ve made this four times in the past month. I don’t put in the jalapeño, and sometimes use orange juice instead of pineapple. It’s always good.

I guess I am just not into Gazpacho.  I really don't have much to say about it other than I thought it was OK and my GF didn't like it at all.  Oh well, you have to try new things.  I hate it when people tell me they don't like something yet they have never tried it!

This is a refreshing and delicious recipe. I did not make any changes other than add a bit of salt to taste simply to bring out the other flavors.  Everyone in the family enjoyed it and I would make it again.

A delicious summer soup! I followed the recipe, just substituting cilantro for mint since that's what I had. All the ingredients blended well together and the flavors were so refreshing. I will try it with mint next time, and I'll add more jalapeño (I omitted it from the soup because it's too spicy for my kids, and I put a little on my husband's and my soup but it was a not-spicy-at-all jalapeño.) I made lemon garlic shrimp, corn on the cob, and creamy avocado dip with tortilla chips to go with it. Yummm!

Very Tasty.  Refreshing and light with a very nice combination of flavor and texture.  I used an emersion blender which made quick work of things, and less cleanup over a full-size  blender.  Plus enables you maintain the level of chunky-ness to your preference.

My kids and I slurped this up!  And my husband had thirds.  Perfect as an accompaniment to grilled meat in the summertime.

Great summertime recipe.  I used slightly less onion and real pineapple chunks rather than just the juice.  My vitamix made it super smooth and simple to make.  I'll be making this every summer from now on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

i don't like watermelon very much but i love this! as a mom of 3, i appreciate healthy, easy recipes like this! it has that perfect balance of spicy-sweet. the cucumber and ginger override the watermelon taste. it is a little watery but i don't know how to change that since watermelon and cucumber have such high water content. that's my only criticism.

I really liked this as a base recipe. I wanted to use the entire watermelon, so I sort of did this in batches. I used 2 whole jalapenos, one red, one yellow pepper, agave nectar, red onion, blended and tasted as I went alone. I saved some of the gazpacho and made ice cubes out of it. This is great for presentation, and keeps it nice and cold. Love it!
