I really looked forward to making this, but unfortunately, it fell really short. At first, I was enticed by the combination of flavors - spicy, savory, sweet, and sour - but unfortunately the chipotle peppers completely overwhelmed the dish. The recipe did not call for draining the chipotles from the adobo sauce. This made the patties very soft and difficult to work with. The burger just would not stay together. If I make this again, I would substitute fresh chopped jalepenos for the chipotles and drastically reduce the amount so that I could taste the other flavors.

This was an experiment for me!!  I've never cooked lamb before, but recently found some pre-made patties in the quick sale meat section, so I decided to try them.  Since they were already made into patties and wrapped with bacon, I can't give a full 5-star rating because I didn't follow this recipe exactly - I used the salt, pepper, rosemary and some minced garlic as a rub - then brushed them with maple syrup during cooking.  I liked the flavor enough, that I will be keeping this recipe to make as directed - I think ground lamb as a burger with the other ingredients mixed in and served with roasted potatoes as a side will be an excellent meal.

I really loved the idea of these burgers.  They promised a combination of spicy, earthy, tangy, and sweet using all the flavors we really love.  Between the cost of the lamb and the goat cheese the price jumped up quickly so I opted to use turkey instead.  I love spicy, really spicy food, but 6 T  of chipotle seemed off so I just minced one large pepper.  We choose to grill these so I didn't brush the outside with syrup for fear it would burn and instead of adding the goat cheese to the patty I mixed it with a bit of cream and used it as a spread to really highlight the ingredient .  A few slight adjustments to suit our tastes and it was love at first bite.  These will be a regular for us during grilling season.

6 tablespoons of minced chipotle peppers to 1 pound of lamb has got to be a typo. That is entirely too much heat and would completely overwhelm all of the other delicate flavors. With that being said, I used 1 large chipotle in adobo and that was perfect for us. The only other change I made was in the cheese. 6 ounces of goat cheese was $5 and 6 ounces of feta was only $1.68. While I'm sure the goat cheese would have been good too, I just couldn't justify the extra money considering how much I spent on the lamb. These turned good and were very impressive. We are not big on rosemary but it worked very nicely in this and didn't overpower. I did grill the burgers out of personal preference and the patties stayed together just fine. This recipe definitely has the WOW factor, just be sure to cut back on the chipotle or that WOW will be in a negative way instead of a positive one.
