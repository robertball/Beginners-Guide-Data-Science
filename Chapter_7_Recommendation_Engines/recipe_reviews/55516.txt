Rich and gooey. A kid pleaser...have napkins ready! Simple to make; I let my kids make them in our sandwich maker instead of the skillet.

I made a slight change, instead of using peanut butter, I used some Almond filling, and mini marshmellows instead of the creme.  These were a big hit at a BBQ party.  So easy to make and delicious too!  However, they are very sweet, so I cut the servings in half.  I rolled them up like a burrito, wrapped them in foil and put them on the grill for about 3 minutes....I will make these again for sure!

If your sweet tooth is out of control..this is the way to go.  When I'm in a hurry, I just butter one side of a tortilla and place in a hot cast iron skillet, buttered side down. I then sprinkle half of the tortilla with mini marshmallows and chips (semi sweet, milk, butterscotch or peanut butter) then fold the tortilla over the filling and flip to brown evenly on both sides... :)

What a mess!!!  It makes for a tasty treat, though, when you just have to have something really sweet.

Very rich. I don't know if I liked it with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  May use milk chocolate if I make them again. Kids weren't to crazy about them either.

Excellent. So easy to put together. I was afraid that there might be to many flavors but they were delicious.
