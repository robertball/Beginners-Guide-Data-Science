This was too salty and messy to work with. i added a little seasoned bread crumbs to help roll it for patties. I was disappointed and would not use again.

This is okay....I added an extra half a pound of turkey just to soak up the egg mixture. I took the suggestion of making this as a main dish with brown gravy..I added more mushrooms to that. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

Like some others I found this recipe way too gooey with two eggs. I added about a cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs to soak up the egg. I also used 1 1/2 cups of fresh cremini mushrooms. I didn't have stew mix so I used a tablespoon of gravy mix. My burgers are delicious!

These were just okay. I added diced onion but I think I overcooked them. They were dry and not extremely flvorful. I melted cheese on top to help. I like variations of turkey burgers b/c they are healthy. The goat cheese and spinach burgers were better than these.

I only found this recipe because I was looking for a way to use some beef stew seasoning before it expired. I took heed of the warnings of it being too salty so I didn't use the hole packet of seasoning and threw in the crumbs of a solo hotdog bun I found in the 'fridge and a couple tablespoons of quinoa. After those adjustments it was pretty good!
