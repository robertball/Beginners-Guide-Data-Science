These are rather rich, and sweet to the point of being syrupy, though that could be just the cheap banana liqueur I used.  A tablespoon of lemon juice and an extra cup of ice brought the batch closer to my tastes.  If you're making these, I recommend halving the banana liqueur initially.

THIS IS A GREAT DRINK. IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BLENDER you should not need to crush the ice or mash the bananas. It has never come out syrupy and I have made it many,many times. It is rich and delicious.

I love this drink!  I did cut the Rum down to 4 oz and added strawberries, but that's a personal preference.  If you use a smoothie machine, you can freeze your bananas, use frozen strawberries, and cut down on the ice.  SO GOOD!!!

This was a good banana drink recipe. I used 7oz of rum, and 3 oz of banana liqueur, and it was just right. I also used dark rum, which is just a personal preference. Be warned though, this is a very sweet recipe.

I really thought this was delightful and very smooth. I am a chocoholic so i added chocolate soy milk & yogurt in replace of the rum.

Used a little less coconut cream, about 2 oz, no banana liquor (didn't have any).  Dropped the rum down to 4 oz. Added about 2 tbsp of Italian Sweet Cream half-n-half.  Blissssss!
