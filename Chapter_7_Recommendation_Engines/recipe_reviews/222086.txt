While these muffins certainly are delish, I don't think they are exactly "healthy."

I only made two small adjustments to this recipe. I used "soured" lactose-free milk and I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I actually got 12 muffins out of this recipe, not 8. I did also bake mine at 350* and they were done at exactly 20 minutes. These muffins were nicely moist, perfectly sweet and had the perfect amount of blueberries--out of the 12 muffins I made, there are three left.

I would give them five stars if they were really "healthier."  
Now, that being said...leave off the topping and make them in "regular" sized cups yeilding 16 muffins:  You have yourself a 100 calorie treat!

Great muffins!  I also tried this recipe with a few modifications.  Instead of miik I used almond milk (vanilla flavor).  Also instead of 1-1/2 cup flour, I used 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.

I was a tad nervous making a "healthier" muffin, but these came out moist, springy, and absolutely delish!  I even used frozen berries since I had them in the freezer, and was 1/2 cup short but they are still bursting with berries!  Put 2.8oz batter in each little cup, leaving only enough room for crumb topping and the muffin tops came out great!  I had tons of topping left over though so you may want to make less to save waste. Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012

I altered this recipe and was pleased with the results. I skipped the crumb topping and sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of each muffin (before baking). I used 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour & 3/4 cup white flour. I added 2 tablespoons whole ground flaxseed meal and 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract. Yummy and healthy. I'll make these again.

I have made "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" for a couple years now and love them.  I don't like the crumb topping regardless so I either make them plain or pull them out a couple minutes early, brush the tops with beaten egg white and sprinkle raw sugar on for the last couple minutes of baking.  These were ok.  I used homemade applesauce that was thicker than store-bought so that might be some of the issue.  To me, for the few calories you save just make the real ones and enjoy them.  Neither recipe is weight watchers friendly and one tastes far better

Just made these muffins according to the recipe (which is the way a recipe should be reviewed the first time)but used a 12 muffin pan for smaller muffins.  Came out great, but a little sweet, next time I'll reduce the sugar to one cup in the batter.  Great taste just as is. Lots of blueberries makes it extra good. Sharyn

Great! I usually dislike baking because you can't have fun with the recipes... I took half a cup of flour out and added instant cinnamon Quaker oats. I used two tablespoons of olive oil because I just don't like complete applesauce replacement. Oh and I also used peach applesauce. And for the sugar I used brown sugar.... But it turned out amazing! Very pleased, will definitely make them again :)

I made these for my 2 year old so I didn't make the crumble for the top. I also only used  a heaping 1/4 cup of sugar in the actual recipe and then sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar. They were moist and lovely! My husband ate more than my daughter. Make sure you store them in the fridge. They went south quickly in a ziplock on the counter.

These came out great - but of course I made several modifications to try and make them even healthier. I left off the topping, replaced the AP flour with spelt flour, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and used unsweetened almond milk in place of regular milk. Still came out moist, springy and sweet enough. Next time I'll try coconut sugar or honey in place of refined white sugar. Can't wait! This will be my go to for a healthier breakfast blueberry muffin.

I got 9 really good sized muffins out of this recipe in a regular 12-muffin pan.

Good!  I used dried blueberries... all I had. Used other suggestions too.. almond milk and half coconut oil.  Topping WAY too much.. will use less than half next time.  But overall good muffins.

Honestly?  They were just OK.  Made exactly as recipe states.  Not impressed.  Not worth the time and trouble it takes to make them especially when a good boxed recipe using wild Maine blueberries actually tastes much, much better.  Next time a craving sets in, will head to the baking aisle of the local grocery and get a box mix.

Tasty! Although they are healthier, they certainly aren't healthy. However, it's easy enough to adjust any recipe to be healthier. The only difference in this one was exchanging apple sauce for oil and adding extra blueberries, but if you are really worried, use can sub half whole wheat flour and either leave off the topping or just use half to save on fat and calories. I only used half and it was just as good. Also, I'm not clear if salt was left out to make them healthier, or an oversight, but I made it without as the recipe suggested and it was just as tasty.

Tried this as per recipe the first time.  Wonderful!  Too much topping though so i had some left.  Made them again but didn't have any apple sauce so used oil.  Not near as good.  Use the apple sauce.  Going to make them again.

I really enjoyed these! I did modify these which may make them a bit healthier (and mainly because I was out of some of the ingredients). But a baked good is a baked good in my opinion. :) Instead of all purpose flour, I used whole wheat flour. I didn't have butter, so I used coconut oil for the crumble. I used about 1/8 of a cup of the oil--about half of the 1/4 of butter that was called for. Finally, I used almond milk instead of regular milk. These are very good and I'll definitely make them again! :)

Loved these muffins!!! Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly. My kids constantly eat mini muffins so I used a mini muffin pan and baked them for 10 minutes. I also made some regular size muffins. These freeze really well and are a great snack or easy breakfast. Thank you:)

Great recipe, much better than any "box mix" because fresh ingredients are the best! Notes:

* I made 10 medium-large muffins (full to the top, normal muffin pan).
* I used more like 1 1/2 cups of large frozen blueberries (let thaw first!) and that was plenty of berry.
* Make half the amount of crumb (and this covers 10 said muffins). I followed the recipe and ended up with way too much crumb topping left over.
* Beware - make sure butter stays cold when creating crumb topping.
* I used 1/2 cup buckwheat flour in the muffin mixture, in place of all-purpose flour, not enough to impact muffin texture. This yields a bit fewer carbohydrates.

Ok I went a little cray cray changing this recipe up, simply because I was on a momentary healthy kick and had a bunch of stuff to use up.  Used 1/2 butter & 1/2 coconut oil, used almond milk, added lemon juice & zest and some flax seed.  They still turned out really good although I think I would use less sugar in the muffin mix next time, they were a little too sweet.

These are just okay muffins, I won't make them again.  There were just WAY too many blueberries.  1 cup of blueberries would have been better.  The excess of blueberries ruined the muffin for me.

In a prediabetic household, this is a tasty splurge even with applesauce instead of oil and LOTS of blueberries, ( a healthy reason to eat these muffins after all).  Per suggestions, I did add 1/2 t vanilla and a dash of salt. Thought all the fruit might make them mushy - not at all.  Thought my reduction of sugar to scant 1/2 cup in the batter would make them bland - not so. Thought  a sprinkle of decorator sugar & cinnamon instead of the strussel top would underwhelm  -  absolutely not.  These muffins were a totally indulgent & delicious breakfast treat, & we enjoyed every light, moist morsel.  Thanks for a sharing a great recipe!

Rating is for taste, not too sweet and very fruity! (I did cut the topping in half, based on other reviews). However, they just didn't want to come out of the papers, so we lost a chunk of each muffin. I've not run across this problem before, so not sure what went wrong.

It was dry. There are not enough wet ingredients for it to be an actual working muffin batter. .  Do not recommend this recipe at all!

The only reason this recipe didn't get a 5 star was that the crumble topping was all over the place after cooking. Next time I will not fill the cups up to the top, maybe 2/3's of the way would work and I could get 12 muffins instead of 8. 
Otherwise these are so good. A treat!

Very delicious!  I give it a 4 instead of 5 for two reasons.  First, only about 1/2 of the topping mixture is really needed, so save your ingredients and make 1/2.  Also, they were a little 'gummy', so I added just 2 tsp canola oil and it made enough difference.  I used some large plump blueberries, which, when they popped in the oven made a beautiful drizzle down the side of the muffin papers.  These disappear VERY fast!

Very good recipe. I adjusted to make them a little healthier and used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour + 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. Also used about 2 TB less sugar that called for. Didn't make crumb topping. I used frozen fresh berries and thawed them in the microwave for about a minute before adding to batter. Also rolled them in some flour before adding to batter to help them not to sink in batter. Not sure if that was needed since the batter was so thick but did so anyway. 

Muffins are usually SO sweet and I wanted something a little less so.

Will make again. Excellent smeared with some salty butter. (To negate my adjustments for the healthier muffins in the first place. ;))

Made 12 cupcake size muffins.

In my second batch, I only used half the sugar. Also rinsing the blueberrise is a good idea..less you want all purple- which can sometimes be fun!

Absolutely fantastic!  The only change I made was to cut the sugar by a few tablespoons and it was plenty sweet.  I've made this recipe and the more fatty "To Die For Blueberry Muffins," and you can barely tell the difference.  Why not save a 80 calories or so per muffin?

My family loves these muffins! I have played with the recipe a bit to try to make them healthy, vegan and gluten free. If you are looking for a few more changes to make these muffins healthier, I have made these changes. 1) use ground flax seeds and water for a healthy egg substitute. 2) use coconut sugar in place of the white and cut down to half a cup.3) replace milk with unsweetened almond or soy milk and 4) use quinoa or spelt flour in place of all or half the white flour. The quinoa flour is a little higher in fat than wheat flour so it makes baked goods more moist. I made the topping with coconut oil, coconut sugar and cinnamon, if you have a lot left over freeze it for your next batch. My taste testers have loved all the variations!

Not bad, but for some reason, mine did not bake to that photo and were quite smaller than others that I baked in my 12 cup muffin tin. Ingredients were the same but they turned out dry and not very sweet considering the addition of the blueberries.

Lots of wild blueberry flavour! Only one problem - stuck to paper muffin cups! Better just to grease muffin pan but might be messy cause of sugar from blueberries.

It was too sweet and a bit bland for my tastes. On the positive side, they LOOKED absolutely amazing and gourmet to me.  Especially with the blueberry oozing out of the top just a bit.

made it exactly as written, but used fresh blueberries I had frozen this summer. Excellent. Husband just raved and he doesnt rave unless he means it! This one is a keeper. OH, forgot that next time I would probably melt the butter for the topping and maybe cut back a little on the sugar and flour...had TONS lots over and tried to really pile it on. Still had lots left over. Hated to see it go to waste. ;)

Wonderful! I made three changes. 1.frozen blueberries 2.no topping 3.donut pan.  The frozen blueberries worked fine and I'll do it again. Not using a topping was fine also. Its a very sweet and tasty recipe.  The donut pan wasn't perfect. They're a little moist for a donut pan but it was fun!
Regarding being healther, they certainly are, especially without the topping! If they were strictly "healthy" the only ingredient would be blueberries ;)

These muffins smell great when they are in the oven!!! I changed the plain applesauce (didn't have any) and used Motts sensations Country Berry applesauce. I doubled the recipe, if you do this, don't double the topping, I have too much left over that I almost want to make another batch of muffins. Wonderful recipe.

I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose flour to make these gluten free.  They turned out really good! A little spongy but not bad.  I included the Xantham gum that they recommended (1 1/2tsp) on the package. They really grew while baking to have nice caps but kind of shrunk back down as they cooled.  20 minutes was plenty at 400 degrees.  

The original recipe has always gone over well! I usually add some nutmeg and cinnamon to the dry ingredients.

Pretty good, I replaced apple sauce with olive oil and it tasted fine.  Didn't have any cinammon as well.
