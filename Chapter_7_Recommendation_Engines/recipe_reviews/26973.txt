Awesome fresh recipie.  We initially thought the corn would be too much, but it was oh so delicious.  IT's the perfect salsa for that hot, summer night.

We added some things that we think kicked the recipie up a few notches:

1/2 of a medium vidalia onion,
Use Sweet White Corn instead of Yellow,
Small Bundle of Cilantro, chopped,
Few Dashes of Salt (to taste),
Fresh Ground Pepper (to taste),
Two Small Jalipeno Peppers, Chopped and Seeded.

Thanks for the great recipie.  It's a little more expensive to make due to all the fresh ingredients, but it is soooo worth it.

This is not for salsa traditionalists!  Prepare with an open mind and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed the use of fresh herbs, and I added some coarsely chopped red onion.  Next time I will add more garlic and maybe some jalapenos for extra flavor!

This was awesome!  I made only a few minor changes to the recipe - I added salt and pepper and I used two seeded and chopped jalapenos in place of the banana chile.  I served it for lunch with a green salad w/ miso dressing, sauteed onions and oyster mushrooms, and tofu with soy sauce and hot sesame oil.  My boyfriend and I made "yummy noises" all through the meal.  Thanks!

The salsa was ok... wasn't really special and if you are looking for a traditional salsa this is not it.  I would say the effort in preparing is not worth the product.

This was delicious.  Of course, it is way better in the summer when you can get corn and tomatoes at their very best.  I did have to use an Anaheim pepper as banana peppers were not available and I added some green onion for a little bite.  I will certainly make this again.  Thanks for posting.

I am challenged when it comes to cooking or preparing foods. As such, it isn't clear to me if the corn in this dish is supposed to be cooked or not. And, if it is coming straight off the cob, how does one best keep the kernels in tac.
