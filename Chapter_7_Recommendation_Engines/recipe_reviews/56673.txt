I have tweaked this recipe, after a few attempts, to perfection (for my tastes).  First of all, I think the variances in dough texture people are having is in the way they measure their flour.  I am one of those bakers that measures flour by spooning it into the measuring cup lightly and using a knife to level off.  The first time I made these(exactly as the recipe states) the dough was like mush.  I ended up working in an extra cup of flour with my hands.  I rolled in between two pieces of parchment because of the toughness extra flour always adds to cut-outs.  The cookies were tasty but to floury with a cardboard texture.  I finally ended up using 1 and 1/2 cups flour. I substituted 3/4 c brown sugar for the white sugar, because I thought they needed to be sweeter as well, and I thought the brown sugar would help to keep them moist. I used a 3 inch gingerbread cutter and cooked for 7 minutes.  Delicious, soft and chewy.  The spices are perfect, it is a spicy cookie just as the recipe says.  I used white chocolate to pipe on the features, buttons, bowties, and scarfs. Not only are they adorable, they are out-of-this-world tasting. I will try to upload a picture later today.  Thanks Eileen, at last, a gingerbread man I can actually eat!!!

This recipe barely misses a 5 star rating for one reason only. The cookies are not "spicy" as the title promises. They have a pleasant, mildly spiced flavor, but this recipe lacks the "bite" usually associated with genuinely spicy gingerbread. For those, however, who have palates that appreciate milder spices, this recipe is perfect. If you long for a spicier kick to your gingerbread, double the listed spices except cloves, and add a liberal dash or two of cayenne. The dough was very easy to work with, after chilling. I made it before going to bed, then rolled them out the next morning, taking only what could be rolled and cut at one time out of the fridge. The dough is, like any recipe made with a large quantity of any syrupy substance (i.e. molasses, corn syrup, honey,) sticky if not adequately chilled. Sticky dough is impossible to work with. The temptation is to add more flour to the dough, but resist it! More flour toughens your product. In fact, when rolling, it is always advisable to use a pastry cloth on your board and pastry sock on your rolling pin. This enables you to incorporate the least amount of flour possible, yet still work easily with the dough. Another good quality is that these don't puff up and lose their shape when baked. In fact,  what you see when on the sheet before baking is just about what you get. They're good keepers, still soft a week after baking (kept in an airtight tin.) Excellent recipe, but some tinkering with the spices could improve it.

Just okay. I agree that too much cloves leaves an aftertaste. Dough is sticky --I'd add another 1/2 cup of flour. Separate the dough into 3 small amounts to chill. Don't overbake because the cookies'll dry rock hard. Had a hard time not overbaking because they were so soft and looked raw in the middle, but the ones I removed on time cooled perfectly soft but not mushy. 

My cookies spread, & my Better Homes & Garden cookie mag says it might be caused by using margarine w/ "less than 80 percent vegetable oil" and putting the dough on hot cookie sheets. BH&G says your margarine should be at least 100 calories per T. I didn't know that about the hot cookie sheet either, so next time I'll alternate sheets.

I love the idea of rolling the dough on parchment, cutting the shapes, removing scraps, & baking on the parchment. 

I prefer the Joe Froggers recipe on this site, which is easier to roll, eggless, uses shortening (which doesn't compete with the spices), and 1/2 as much cloves for 2x as much flour! But I do like the cinammon in this recipe so I'll add some to my Froggers.

Also, just FYI for anyone getting psyched to make gingerbread cookies this season, my Better Homes & Garden cookie mag says this about dark vs. light molasses: "When describing molasses, light refers only to flavor, not color or calorie or sugar content. Light is sweet in flavor. Dark molasses is not as sweet but has a distinctive robust flavor. Light and dark are interchangeable in recipes."

Made these in our cookie shop this past week  and everyone who tried them loved them, especially when they were still warm out of the oven.  I'm very impatient and time is always limited, so I never wait for dough to stiffen in fridge.  I added a about 3 extra tbsp of flour so the dough would be dry enough to roll out immediately.  Turned out great.  Easy to roll out and it didn't toughen the finished product at all.  Even on Friday (four days after they were baked) cookies were still delicious and tender.  This is definitely our new gingerbread recipe.  And I wouldn't change the proportions of the spices at all.  The taste was wonderful as is.

I was looking for a classic, soft, delicious gingerbread cookie recipe, and I found it! This recipe makes such a nice, soft dough with the perfect blend of spices. I used Grandma's original molasses (not robust) and light brown sugar. I think you could get away with adding about 1/4 cup more flour to make it a little firmer. You may want to double the recipe for your holiday cookie baking.
I don't remember liking gingerbread so much!

This is a very good gingerbread recipe. However, one must watch the men carefully when you open the oven, lest they jump out and run out the door yelling, "Run, run, as fast as you can, you can't catch me; I'm the gingerbread man!"

These turned out really well, and my kids loved cutting them out and decorating them.  (**Don't be discouraged by the amount of dough - it makes a LOT more cookies than it looks like it will.)  After adding the ginger, I substituted an equal amount of Pumpkin Pie Spice (2 tsp.) for all the other individual spices, and it worked perfectly.  I will be pretty generous with the spices next time, though - by the time my 14-year-old worked in enough flour to handled the dough, it was a little bit diluted.  Still yummy, and we'll probably make them a few more times this holiday season.  **Just remember to use a pastry brush to get all the excess flour off your cookies (top AND bottom) before placing them on the baking sheet - prettier and tastier!

Delicious! The recipe was perfect- no extra flour needed and no tampering with the spices.  Dough WILL be a little sticky but the trick is to make it as cold as possible. Freezing for a short while may help and using small portions at a time may help.    I also followed the advice of rolling it between 2 lightly dusted sheets of baking paper. I used a broad lightly floured spatula to lift it up.  Again, the colder the dough, the easier it is to lift.     If u like your gingerbread a little chewy and soft, then 8min at 350F is great.  But if u like 'em a little crispy, then try baking it a second time at (300F 7-8min) or perhaps longer.

My kids, husband, and I, had as much fun baking and making these as we did eating them, and giving them for gifts! If you want to hang them on the tree, make sure to roll a bit thinner, and poke a hole for a hook. If they are for eating, just bake for about 6 1/2 to 8 minutes for a softer cookie, unless you like a ginger snap textured cookie. I rolled mine out between lightly floured wax paper. Used powdered sugar/milk mixture for "glue", and used raisins, mini m&m's, and red licorice to decorate. Love the way the smell of them baking sends out a great Christmasy smell as well as a warm home feeling. This is a Christmas Classic Recipe!

This is a very good gingerbread recipe.  However, one must watch the men carefully when they are in the oven.  My cookies got slightly overcooked and hardened very fast, so it was difficult to affix M&Ms and cinnamon drops as decorations.

ABoslutely fabulous!  The gingerbread stayed soft for days (in a sealed bag).  If you like really spicy gingerbread, I recommend doubling the amount of spice in the recipe, except for the cloves, they shoudl be 1 1/2 times what the recipe says.  On the whole, highly recommended recipe.

I've been using this recipe every Halloween and Christmas for about five or six years now, and each and every time my cookies get raves. 

Several people have even told me that they're the best gingerbread cookies they've ever had, and actively look forward to me making them. This is a great recipe!

I bake them for 8 minutes instead of 10, so they'll stay chewy. Also, I'll refrigerate the dough for about 12 hours to let everything get settled together.

This is the best gingerbread recipe you're going to find. Stop looking now.

I was hesitant to make these cookies after reading the mixed reviews, but I'm glad I picked this recipe.  I doubled it and used butter instead of margarine.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  At each step I gave the dough plenty of time to mix completely.  I was rushed for time and barely chilled the dough for an hour.  I rolled out half the dough at a time, used plenty of flour, and baked the cookies for 7 minutes.  A pastry scraper made it easy to transfer the cookies to cookie sheets.  The kids had fun decorating, and at a family gathering today the plate we brought vanished quickly.  Doubling the recipe gave me about 36 cookies, each 3 or 4 inches "tall."  The flavor is good, but not too spicy for the kids.

These are great!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  Let the cookies cool COMPLETELY before removing them from the pan!  They didn't spread much so it's OK to cut them as close as a 1/2 inch.  I piped royal icing onto the snowflakes.  I also frosted some using the Sugar Cookie Icing from allrecipes.com and the cookies that I "flooded" the frosting on became VERY soft and broke VERY easy. (I'm assuming because of the added moisture that the icing gives the cookies.)  If I decorate the cookies this way in the future, I will bake them longer so they are stonger.  These cookies have a great flavor!

To me, the cloves left the recipe very bitter, I threw out the first batch because of the aftertaste. But I halved the cloves, and used brown sugar instead of white to make them chewier, and also butter instead of margarine, and they were terrific!

Really good flavor with these cookies. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar. For the baking I would recommend the following: I put the dough in the fridge for 24 hours. I then rolled the down out in between two sheets of parchment paper. The refrigeration and parchment prevent any stickiness. I also baked the cookies on parchment. My first batch got completely stuck to the baking sheet, so the parchment paper really help with the next batch.

For the past 15 years I have been trying out gingerbread cookie recipes, trying to find one that matched the cookies my grandma made. They were always either too bland, or the dough a mess, or just not like Grandma's. I am thrilled to say the search is ended with this recipe. They tasted great, were easy to work with and my house smelled phenomenal while they baked. Thank-you!

Delicious!  I made 1.5x the recipe so I'd have enough. Followed the recipe but I had run out of nutmeg so replaced with pumpkin pie spice (which has nutmeg).  Next time, I'd like to try it with nutmeg.  I would say the "ready in" time estimate is misleading, though.  Let's say you mix and put in the fridge, maybe 10 minutes plus 1-2 hours of chilling.  Then, unless you've got a big oven that can fit a lot of cookie sheets, you're repeating the rolling/cutting/transferring onto cookie sheet/onto cooling racks steps a few times, so that's maybe 45 minutes for 3 sheets of cookies.  Then the cooling for maybe 30 minutes and add in time to decorate them all (10-20 minutes, depending on how intricate your designs are), then time for the icing to set before you'd realistically serve them.....   All in all, this is something that requires some planning and lots of time before the moment you'd actually be serving them, so you need to plan your time around them, doing other things while you wait in between steps.  That doesn't change my rating, but just something to keep in mind!  They kept very well for me.  I'm eating them today, at day 3, and they are still excellent!

Definitely not to my taste. Too ... something. Spicy? Salty? Too much cloves? Too much molasses flavour and not enough sugar? I would definitely add more sugar as one review suggested if I make them again.
No one in the family liked them. Although, I did find one or two people who did genuinely seem to like them. Most found them overpowering, however.

These are literally the best gingerbread men I've tasted. The flavor is wonderful (maybe it's just me, but most gingerbread cookies are tasteless). I only did a few things differently. First of all, I ground the cloves and nutmeg myself (MUCH more flavor) and added about 1/2 teaspoon of allspice and 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom. As I am a cinnamon addict, I added what must have been 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon. I also began to knead the dough with my hands when mixing in the powders as the dough was much too tough and crumbly. I coated my hands continuously with water, which pressed the clumps together. When I was tasting the dough, I was thinking the cookies would turn out with much too powerful of a molasses taste. However, once cooked, these cookies were filled with warming spices and just a slight hint of molasses. This was my first time making gingerbread cookies, and this will definitely be the only recipe I use. Thank you so much!

these were delicious! yet the only spices i added were ginger and cinnamon and it turned out great. i personally don't like molasses so i only added 1/4 cup and added and additional whole egg instead. i half to warn you that if you roll it out too thin it will burn on the edges. you can refrigerate it for more than an hour ( which is really convenient during the holidays, being busy and all). don't hesitate to try this recipe, even if this is your first time.

These cookies are PERFECT!  I love the spice levels and the way they stay soft.  I converted the recipe to make them vegan and gluten free.  I also decorated them with icing and candies.  I have another batch going right now!

I changed the recipe a little bit, and they turned out more like chewy spice/molasses crisps rather than gingerbread cookies. I put half a cup less flour than what was called for after reading many reviews, and I also added some more spices. I also traded the 1/2 cup of sugar for 1/2 brown and 1/4 white. It turned out a little too sweet though. I put more cinnamon and ginger, and replaced the cloves for 1/2 tsp of allspice because I didn't have any. I never use margarine, so I chose butter instead as well. They tasted good, but they were not Gingerbread men material (I should have added the amount of flour that was called for, I guess) Even with less flour, it was pretty easy to work with, after leaving it stand overnight. I would advice to put most of the 2 cups of flour to make them more cookie-like.

This is all the most wonderful tasting Cookies I've had! Reminds me of those store bought little gingerbread men but better.

The recipe was great and easy to go by, If you fallow the directions everything will be great!

The cookies were nice and soft and had a great flavor to them. After a day or two they still are soft but don't break when held up right! I used an old fashion cookie cutter (look like a tin man but really was a gingerbread man I guess), so they were huge cookies about 5x3 inches! But really great! I'll make a bigger batch next time so I can have way more cookies that huge!

I used some icing I made because I wanted to have that nice white icing outline so I made the icing with about 1 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar, 1 egg white and 1/4 tsp. of Cream of tartar. Not sure if that tartar helped but the icing was manageable to make the outlines. There's probably a better recipe for the icing but it came out really good. 

GREAT RECIPE!!! THANKS!

These were judged as "yummy" by both those who have a sweet-tooth and those who live on the spicy side of life!  Note: For best blend of flavors, make these well ahead of time, and of course, store air tight.

This recipe was amazing! I did not have ginger, so I substituted the spice mixture for 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. Kept everything else in the recipe the same. It was perfect; thanks for sharing it!

We add a little extra spice because we like it really spicy. Great cookie, used it three times already this week. Unfortunately, you have to bake it for an extra 10 minutes to use for making a house. The extra baking makes it taste icky, but it held up really nicely.

This recipe is very good and very easy! But I made a couple of tweaks! I used 1/4 cup of molasses instead of 1/2 cup, one whole egg, and reduced the amount of cloves to 1/2 tsp. Also, I didn't have any nutmeg, so I left that out. I used a shaped cookie pan, so I didn't have to refrigerate the dough. The dough was actually quite easy to work with. :)

Fantastic, flavorful, and chewy!  These cookies took a little work (as all rolled cookies do) but they were well worth the effort.  I cut the cloves in half and added a little allspice, and they still had plenty of zing.  I also added 1 Tbsp fresh orange zest.  I took other reviewers advice and subbed half the white sugar for brown sugar, and also added 1/2 c. flour to make the dough more workable.  It took some muscle to work in all the flour - my mixer isn't very powerful - so I kneaded it in like bread.  A quick chill in the freezer for 45 minutes did the trick, and rolled the dough out thin between two sheets of floured wax paper - it was hard to work with at first, but softened a lot when it warmed up.  Once the cookies were on the baking sheet, I stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes to firm up their shape before baking (I also re-chilled the baking sheets before putting the next batch on) - this trick worked really well, and the few cookies I forgot to chill down looked very "blobby" in comparison.  I baked for only 7 minutes, and they were perfectly soft but not doughy when cooled - I like soft cookies better.  Some I sprinkled with red sugar before baking, the others I piped around the edges with a little icing.  See the Royal Icing I recipe on this site, the icing was easy to work with, hardened quickly, and has a nice, not-too-sweet flavor (it worked out perfect because the cookies need egg yolks, and the icing needs egg whites!).  I also piped white "buttons

This is a great recipe.  I started it last night, so I let the dough sit overnight.  I also used less molasses and couldn't find the ginger so used a little more sugar and more cloves and cinnamon.  I also added vanilla, lemon juice, and sour cream because I use them in all my cookies ;)  Anyway, they taste great and are just soft enough, no too soft, nor too hard. Love 'em.

The worst dough I have ever worked with. I made as instructed and even chilled the dough overnight. This dough stuck to the counter so much that it was impossible to work with. Even after incorporating more flour into the dough it was still too soft to even lift a cookie up without loosing its shape. After several attempts I gave up ... a waste of time and ingredients for me and I'm a baker. This dough seems to me to work best when well chilled but when you roll it that alone warms it up making it very difficult to keep it chilled to be able to work with it.

I followed the recipe and still needed to use more flour.  I chilled the dough for over an hour and still couldn't work with it using the amount of flour in the recipe.  I probably added about a cup more.  They tasted great but they all broke.  I made another batch and used a smaller cookie cutter and rolled the dough out a little thicker.  This did the trick.  I used the sugar cookie icing on this site with lemon flavoring and they tasted superb.

These are delicious - I grew up using a certain recipe which I thought was great (sort of thin and chewy), but I think I'm switching to this one from now on.  Make the dough the day before and you won't have a problem with it being sticky (I did it 24 hours in advance).   I decreased the cloves and added a little black pepper.  And most importantly, through trial and error, I found it was best to roll this dough THICK (a full 1/4 inch) and bake a full 9-10 minutes.  (I tried it thinner and cooked for less time and didn't like the results).  By doing it thick and cooking the full 9-10 minutes, I got thick soft cookies which are delicious.  Someone suggested rolling them out on powdered sugar and I may try that since the kids might prefer them that way.

This was only my second time ever making home-made cookies and I must say this recipe was fantastic and very easy to make, though I didn't follow it exactly. I did what other reviewers suggested and halved the cloves and doubled the other spices. I also used honey instead of molasses because that's all I had. The dough was perfect, easy to roll and cut. My kids enjoyed cutting the shapes and icing the cookies. The end result was the best gingerbread cookies I have ever eaten. My family loved them so much that they ate the entire batch within 24 hours (which was almost 3 dozen!) and asked me to make more. My oldest daughter also asked me to make some for her school Christmas party and bake sale. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that my family enjoyed making and eating.

These were perfect for decorating! My kids had a lot of fun with them. I substituted butter for the margarine, but otherwise followed exactly. I think the taste was a little bland and they were too hard to eat after a few hours, so keep that in mind if that's your plan. We weren't eating them, so it was ok. This will be my go-to recipe for decorating gingerbread from now on.

LOVED! Made it exactly as written and I was surprised at how versatile the dough was.  We could reroll it unlimited times and it was smooth and you can adjust the thickness of the dough/time of baking to make them as chewy or crunchy as you want. We made both soft chewy ones and crunchy, crisp ones.  Will reuse anytime we need gingerbread, found my perfect recipe, thank you!

Excellent recipe! Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar (for flavor and to make the dough more solid), used 1/2 tsp cloves, and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg (to give a stronger spice flavor). Like other reviewers, I recommend rolling out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and chilling the scraps before re-rolling. Used colored royal icing (1 3/4c confectioner's sugar, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1 egg white beaten together till smooth) to decorate: this icing hardens well and won't crack when cookies are stacked.

First off, this was the first time that I made gingerbread cookies. I never really cared for them as a kid, but decided I wanted to give them another try. After researching many recipes and reading many reviews, I decided to try this one. I also decided to substitute half the molassas for honey. In addition I omitted the cloves because I didn't have any. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, no extra flour. I found the consistency of the dough to be perfect. I refrigerated it for a couple hours, and was pleasantly suprised at how easy it was to roll & cut out. I did have to use the flour liberally in doing so, but no more than making other cut out cookies. The cookies were delicious & chewy with just the right amount of spice and not too strong. I think the honey helped to mellow out the cookies at bit, as I'm not a fan of the strong molassas flavor in traditional gingerbread, also it added a little exta sweetness. I will definitely use this recipe when making gingerbread cookies.

Very good cookies, although I altered the recipe slightly,I used about an extra cup of flour (maybe the 2 cups in the recipe is a mistake and should have said 3)otherwise you can't work with the dough at all, anyway, I also only used half tsp cloves instead of 1 tsp and I used 1 tsp cinnamon instead of half tsp, I used black treacle whis is meant to be the same as mollases. They turned out really good, I rolled them out to 1/4 inch onto greaseproof paper then picked them up with a pallet knife/ metal spatulla and then placed them onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment/greaseproof paper on 170 c for 10 mins, still soft and chewy 4 days later. I iced them with royal icing which was 2 egg whites about 1lb of confectioners sugar and a tsp of lemon juice (apart from helping to cook the egg whites, I don't know what else the lemon does! as it is not enough to flavour the icing. I tried another recipe that only called for ginger, no cinnamon no cloves no nut meg and no treacle and only a tiny bit of sugar, they were terrible, I will keep this recipe as my gingerbread man recipe for sure. by the way the strong treacle smell goes away and is ovbiously used to compliment the rest of the ingredients and works really well.Thanks

Very good flavor, but the cooking time is way off.  I did a batch in 350 degree oven for 8 minutes and after they cooled they were very crisp and hard. I changed the final batches to a 325 degree oven and cooked for 6-7 minutes and they are much better.   I also upped the cloves to 1/2 TBS based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.   Didn't have to add more flour like others did, but I did make sure the dough was nice and cold before rolling.  Great recipe!  It's a keeper!

I just made these for Xmas 2006.  I doubled the recipe, and they turned out deicious.  One suggestion; spray your rolling pin with cooking spray before rolling dough, this will eliminate having "floury cookies" on top.  I baked them for 10 minutes and they turned out perfect, not too hard, not too soft, as I prefer a crisp cookie. I decorated them with icing made of 1 egg white with icing sugar added until it was stiff, colored one half red and used a plastic zip loc bag with a small snip in the corner as my icing piping bag...they turned out great! The icing dries hard. Make em!!!! Oh, one more idea, I made giant letters for my 3 kids first name and also made them and put them ontop of childrens gifts.  I used a sharp knife and made them aprox. .5" in width for each side of the letter (if you know what I mean).  Enjoy!

Great cookie, but I had to work in a lot of extra flour when I rolled it out.  I halved the cloves and increased the cinnamon and they taste great.  I will probably increase the spices a bit next time.  My husband loved these.

Perfect! This is my new gingerbread recipe. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used 3/4 c. brown sugar instead of the white, and a bit more flour. I chilled the dough for only 30 minutes, and it was easy to roll and baked up perfectly. Didn't change the spice level at all, and the cookies were nice and spicy, just the way I like them.

I read the reviews beforehand, and being the novice that I am, I took them into heavy consideration. I wanted a gingersnap, hard, spicy cookie and these looked like the best bet. I ended up using a little less than 2 cups of flour since the recipe called for 2 and reviews called for 1.5, I also used the 3/4 brown sugar substitution for the regular sugar. 

After mixing everything, the dough was a little dry so I added another heaping tablespoon of margarine. 

The result was a semi-hard cookie with the spiciness that I wanted but not exactly the texture. The cookie is delicious, don't get me wrong, the spices were strong (probably could have been stronger, I think I'll add pumpkin spice next time too as one of the reviews suggested). I also used Grandma's ROBUST molasses. The store didn't have anything else. 

When I make another batch, I'll probably try to regular molasses and regular sugar to try to get them a little harder.

I made these just for the fun of it tonight since I have never made gingerbread cookies before.  These were so good!  The best I have ever had and my hubby and my son loved them.  I made my own frosting and decorated them just like in the store.  Oh and I didnt change a thing to the recipe.  It was excellent as is!

Wonderful recipie! These cookies taste so good, and yes, they stay soft. They have a very nice balance of the molasses and the spices. I did use butter instead of margarie. This recipie is great! You have to try it.

I doubled the spices except the cloves, and added a couple dashes of Cayenne. I also used dark brown sugar instead of white. I let the dough sit overnight and it was absolutely fabulous to roll out. They are so soft inside and delicious! Finally a gingerbread recipe I'm satisfied with!! Thank you!

I only had 1/3 cup of molasses, and made up the difference to 1/2 c with water to make sure the cookies were moist enough. I also omitted the nutmeg and used whole wheat flour ,and  3/4 cup of brown sugar ( loosely packed). They were amazing~! We used them to make a gingergread house , and they held great, while still being moist and soft.

They were okay. The cookies were. We were busy, so the dough sat in there for a few days, too. But the dough tasted a little weird, and it was all crumbly. I had to add more flour and a little water. I'd probably make a different recipe next time.

I agree with many of the other reviewers, I also had some issues with the texture of the dough and had to add more flour.  Except that, the spices were great, and the cookies keep well for days, if not weeks after.  :)

These cookies are spicy and delicious, and keep very well. We intended to frost and decorate them, but they were so yummy with just a light dusting of granulated sugar that we've been eating them just like that! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was VERY disappointed in this recipe. I have made ginger bread cookies before, and bake regularly. I found the dough very difficult to work with - after refrigeration the dough was crumbly and my shapes fell apart. When room temperature the dough was too sticky to work with. I finally gave up on making shapes and simply made round cookies. I found them dry and NOT spicy at all. The only way to save them is lots of icing.     I followed the recipe exactly other than substituting honey for molasses (a substitution I found online and use regularly, including in gingerbread).    Sorry, I would NOT recommend making this and go with a different recipe on this site.

DELICIOUS!  I loosely followed the recipe after doubling it.  I used Grandma's original molasses, and used 3 1/2 cups of flour (unsifted), ground allspice in place of cloves, butter instead of margarine, and used a Tablespoon of fresh ginger.  If anyone wants to use fresh, I recommend that if you want it to spread more, you should freeze your ginger knob and run your knife perpendicular to the direction you're cutting, so it's sort of like a grater, although I find that this method grates the ginger more finely than just a grater.  Rolling was easy, as I wrapped and refrigerated for a day in plastic wrap, and just rolled it out in between pieces of plastic wrap.  Transferring just took removing the pieces from around the plastic wrap after cutting out the shapes, and flipping it over onto my foil.  I found that for gingerpeople, 7.5 minutes in the oven was just right, while larger pieces for my gingerbread boat required 12 minutes of baking.  The cookies crack easily warm from the oven, but about 5 minutes of cooling hardened them up.  I would use this recipe again!!

after reading the previous reviews, i was a bit apprehensive about making this recipe, especially since it was my first attempt at gingerbread men! i followed the recipe almost to a "T"...however i did use butter instead of margarine and brown sugar instead of white sugar. i was worried about my dough at first because it seemed VERY crumbly and nowhere near the sticky mess most people wrote about. i formed it into a ball and let it chill for 2 hours in the fridge. it rolled beautifully with a bit of flour and wax paper and the dough once shaped was very easily transferred onto cookie sheets. my first tray was a bit undercooked because i was nervous about over-cooking (!!!) but my 2nd tray worked out perfectly! the flavour is exactly what i was going for and the cookies aren't dry or crumbly! will file this in my regular holiday recipe box and make for years to come!! thank you!

I made this recipe for a Christmas dinner party.  The gingerbread people served as place cards with everyone's name on them.  Big hit!  ...and incredibly tasty, just the right amount of spice!  I actually made it and then left it in the fridge over night it made rolling it out the next day soooo much easier!

These cookies are the BEST!!!!
I rolled mine in between floured waxed paper and had no problem with them sticking. I reduced the cloves to 1/2 tsp., cloves are potent, a whole teaspoon seemed like waaayyyy too much for me. I added a tad more cinnamon in place of the cloves and they tasted great. Recipe only makes a small amount, I ended up with a dozen last night and they are all gone as of 15 min. ago when my son ate the last one!!

This recipe was perfect and exactly what I wanted! I definitely followed the tips of the some of the other reviewers to make sure the dough was very cold (refrigerated it overnight) and to roll it out between two sheets of parchment paper. 

They were delicious as is, but I could have used a little more spice, so I would add 50% to each of spice next time. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom and would add a pinch of white pepper next time. 

The cookies expand when you bake so make sure you separate them a good distance before putting them in the oven. Refrigerating the dough cutouts for a few minutes makes them easier to lift and move on the parchment paper without stretching out the shapes. 

If you are decorating them without frosting (e.g. pressing raisins or red hots on for buttons or eyes) you have to move quickly, as they won't stick after the cookies cool even a little bit.

This recipe was absolutely perfect as is--you just have to follow it! I would recommend making it exactly as stated first, then fiddling with it afterward, so you can make a bigger batch exactly how you like. It made 16 cookies for me, and I will definitely double the batch next time!

A really tasty gingerbread cookie. I have tried many recipies including those real ones with black pepper and this is the best. Just the right amount of spice. I've made it with crisco instead of margarine and that works well too!

Wow!  These are fantastic cookies.  The dough is really a pleasure to handle. The cookies have great flavor and have a light, crispy texture, not tough at all.  I've found my perfect gingerbread cookie!
I chilled the dough overnight - not my orignial intent, but it worked out okay.  I divided the dough up into 3 sections and wrapped each in Saran Wrap to chill.  It makes it easier to work with and roll out.  Keep your board and pin floured and there'll be no problem. 

I did not alter the recipe at all.  In my opinion it's perfect as-is.

I have been looking for a good gingerbread cookie recipe for a while, and this is the one!  Most are too bland, but not these.  I omitted the clove, because I am not a fan.  But I added 1/4 tsp. of black pepper.  The cookies came out great! I must disagree with those that found the dough hard to work with.  I thought it was a very easy dough to roll out!  Before I put it in the fridge, I formed it into a disk, and wrapped it in plastic wrap.  With a little flour on the board, I had NO problem.  I rolled mine a little thinner than 1/4 inch.  I used the sugar cookie icing on this website for decoration.  They taste better the next day.

These are like the old fahioned gingerbread.  That's good!!  Some things should stay "traditional".  I made the mistake of rolling my dough a little too thin.  Make it the 1/4 " thick.  If these seem a little "hard", just put a piece of bread in the container with them.  They'll soften right up.

Wonderful Recipe...I found that you only needed to cook them for about 6.5 minutes.
Thanks!

I've used this recipe for several years now and have never had a problem with it - I make it exactly as it is.  The dough is easy to roll out and the cookies come out tasting fantastic.  Do watch while they are in the oven - it depends on how thin you've rolled out your dough and how hot your oven runs.  It's just common sense no matter what the cookie recipe.

Great recipe!  First time tried it as written.  Second time I adjusted spices to my liking - upped the ginger and cinnamon and decreased the cloves.  I chilled the dough in a disc (like I would for pie dough) in a plastic ziplock bag.  When I was ready to roll out the cookies, I divided the dough into 3 sections and only took one section at a time out of the fridge.  The dough wasn't too sticky as some have commented.  I had no issues with rolling the dough. I used 2 in star cookie cutter for shapes and left them plain without icing.  I made 10 dozen for the cookie walk at school and they were gone before many of the other more 'fancy' cookies.  These were a hit!  I will be making more next week for a cookie exchange - those I will ice with royal icing.

Don't let the name scare you.  These are NOT spicy!  They have just the right amount of spice IMO.  I've never made gingerbread cookies before, so I followed the recipe EXACTLY and had no problems with the dough or the taste.  The only thing I would do differently, is not bake them so long.  They came out a little crispier then I like my cookies to be.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.

Yummy!  We've made this a New Year's Day tradition--making a huge gingerbread man and decorating him together--and then of course eating him!  This gingerbread is lovely--tender, sweet and very spicy!  This is the first recipe I picked from allrecipes.com, and I don't feel the need to ever try any of the other recipes--I got perfection on the first one!

I give these three stars only because I loved how they made my kitchen smell.  Unfortunately, after a long time in the fridge, the dough was still way too sticky to roll out.  I had to plop the whole mess back into the bowl to add about 1/2 cup more flour.  The cookies were extremely spicy (although my 8 year old loved the dough).  Hubby, who usually is pretty tough, needed a glass of water after eating half a cookie.  I thought they were way too salty.  Even so, the kids and I had a fun time rolling them out and baking them, and will be frosting them today.  I suspect they will be better after the spiciness is cut a bit with the frosting.  Thanks, though!

Loved this recipe, did change and rating based on the fact that I substituted Splenda for the sugar and they came out fabulous. So for those who have family with sugar issues and need a recipe that adapts well to Splenda..definitely a keeper! Great taste and texture, just like they should be!!

I searched high and low for a good gingerbread cookie recipe, and this is the one! I was worried because I had to omit the nutmeg due to allergies, but it was amazing. Kids and adults cleared the plate! High School foods teacher asked me for the recipe!

Good recipe - not too spicy and flavorful, but the cloves were a touch overpowering. I'm trying to expand my very limited baking skills and thought the dough was ok to work with once it warmed up a bit from the refrigerator.  I did need about a third cup extra flour when rolling.  Rolling to less than 1/4 inch resulted in crunchy cookies, perfect for dunking in coffee.  Ones rolled to 1/4 or slightly thicker were softer and tasted better with icing.

I LOVE this recipe. I made it last year and I am making it again this year, but I will be making a few changes to soften it up a bit and make it a little chewier.  I will be adding an extra egg yolk and subbing bread flour for half of the flour total. I am subbing brown sugar for all of the white sugar and using an extra quarter cup of shortening. The shortening will make up for the extra moisture/fat that the bread flour will need and will make for a little more cake-like cookie. The extra yolk and bread flour will amp up the protein making a chewier cookie.

Easy and they turned out great for decorating. The key is moving them to a cooling rack as soon as they get out of the oven. They are a bit soft so you have to be careful but they firm up nicely after cooling on the rack.

This is my second year making these cookies and they have become expected in the homemade goodie bags that I give for Christmas. A few things that I do differently and get fabulous results with: I use unsalted butter and eggs at room temperature, I use dark brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, I sift ALL dry ingredients together before combining into the wet ingredients. Dough will be sticky. I MAKE MY DOUGH BEFORE I GO TO BED AND REFRIDGERATE OVERNIGHT!! It firms up nicely and I have never had a problem rolling it out the next morning. Cooking time dpends on your oven, where you are, and if you like crispy or soft cookies...9 minutes works great for me in Georgia for crispy edges and a soft middle. I use clear "treat" bags tied with colored ribbon and use plain brown bags with handles which I stamp with Christmas themed stamps. Thanks for sharing!!!

This makes unbelievable gingerbread men. I'll be using this gingerbread recipe from now on. Rave reviews from the family.  I made a couple of minor adjustments. First, I used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. white sugar. Second, instead of 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, I doubled it and used 1 tsp. cinnamon. Also, I used butter rather than margarine. And most importantly, 8 minute cook time was the right length of time. 10 minutes would have been wayyy too long.

Taste just as good as they look :)  But the idea of rolling on wax paper and pulling the dough away from the cut out and then lifting on to a cookie sheet is a must.  I tried other ways and this worked the best.  Thanks for the tips from everyone.  First time I've made gingerbread men but not the last!!  Thanks :)

I have been looking for a gingerbread cookie with taste and FINALLY I have found it!  I also like how they are a bit chewy rather than dry and crunchy.  I made these for my sons class and they turned out awesome.  The dough was sticky but I rolled it out between two pieces of parchment paper instead of getting the flour marks on the cookies had I used flour instead.  Thanks you for the recipe, it will definitely be a keeper in my home!

I noticed some people complained about it not being spicy enough. The only thing you need to add to give it that special kick people may be looking for, besides doubling the spices, is a 1/4t of cayenne! It's just that simple!

The recipie was perfect.  Plenty spicey with out offending.  The dough is sticky like any gingerbread dough.  The key is to let the dough rest in the fridge at least 8 hours or over night.  Yummy!

These were really good!! Very chewy. I would give it 5 stars but I made changes as suggested by others. I replaced the spices (except ginger) with 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, increased the flour to 3 cups, and refrigerated over night. It was easy to roll out between 2 floured sheets of wax paper. Baked for 8 minutes.

I just finished making these and I must say the flavor is great.  I thought the spices may be a bit much, but it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing there.  The dough was a bit hard to work with and I refrigerated it for 24 hours.However, I didn't use a floured surface because I didn't want to make the cookies to hard with additional flour so I rolled the dough in batches on a silicone baking mat then transferred them with a spatula to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (as suggested by others) and they came out fine.

I just made these with my granddaughter and they turned out great.  The only thing I will change in the future is a little less salt. I did increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp as suggested in another review.  I would suggest to those who had problems with the dough to just roll the cookies out directly on the baking sheet and pull away the excess dough using a table knife to push it away in the close places.  You are using an ungreased cookie sheet so it does not affect the dough and this is much easier than trying to move them once they are cut out.  You can also chill less time if you do it this way.

This is a wonderful recipe, and the amount of sugar is just fine. If you follow exactly the amount of what the recipe says, there shoudn't be problems like too sticky or not moisture enough. I guess the reason about the dough getting out of hand probably is due to the temperature (turn the heater down a little bit perhaps)
My freinds just couldnt get enough of them. And I take half of the dough and use cocoa init, it becomes chocolate flavor gingerbread cookies. Difintely will make it again next year.

Great recipe. But I dropped the thickness to 3/16" and also added 2 teaspoons of orange extract (the same as 2 teaspoons of orange zest for the purists out there.)

For those who have problems getting a consistent thickness when rolling out dough, go by your local hardware store and get a wooden dowel of the right thickness. Cut it in half and put one piece on either side of the dough. Then roll it out with the rolling pin till it hits the dowels. Perfect thickness every time!

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have ever tasted!!! It is wonderful> The cookies are soft and have great flavor. I don't like ginger too much so I did change the recipe so that there was only 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and 1 whole teaspoon of cinnamin. You can still taste the ginger but it is a little more subtle.

I would give this recipe ten stars if I could!  These cookies are simply amazing.  They have a very nice gingerbread taste and cook nicely.  For softer cookies bake around 6 minutes, and for harder cookies bake 8-10 minutes.  Do make sure your dough is thoroughly chilled before you try rolling it out.  Follow the recipe exactly and you will not be disappointed!

this is by far the best gingerbread recipe. it's sturdy enough to use to build houses with yet soft and spicy enough to be an excellent "eating" cookie. for the best flavor and color i recommend only using FANCY molasses, not cooking or blackstrap.

Great recipe! Thank you Lord for patience and Steph67 for a great recipe when in the kitchen with little ones!  This great disaster-proof recipe was delicious. I really like spicy so I added allspice and black pepper. We decorated them with the Gingerbread Cookie Frosting also on this site and they were delicious.

Wonderful recipe.  I am a school librarian and made a double batch of these to take in for the pre-kindergarten children.  This is a very good cookie --- the dough is the easiest to work with; it rolled out great with no sticking.  This is a keeper !!  Thanks!!!! Wish all cut-out cookie recipes would roll out and cut out this easily.  Baked mine for  7 1/2 minutes and that was enough.  On the second batch, I added a few drops of  oil of orange and liked that-- gave a good balance to the spices in the cookie...

I'm in the middle of making this recipe and I'm very annoyed at how it's turning out. The dough is so sticky (after 4 hours in the fridge), it's unworkable! I've used flour on my working surface as well as my rolling pin, but the dough sticks to everything! My kitchen's a mess! I followed the original recipe but I've now added a cup of flour as previously suggested and will leave the dough in the fridge overnight. Even if it works out, the problems while making this recipe make it a big disappointment for a 5-star rated recipe.

This recipe was PERFECT.  I didn't change a THING!  Only needed to flour the dough a bit while rolling it out.  I worked half the dough at a time, and it made the most wonderful gingerbread men!  I doubled the recipe and it made 34 large men (the Wilson cutter with the green comfort handle). Tasty and spicy - - my 5 yr old even liked them.  This will be my annual gingerbread recipe!  Thanks so much!!!!

GREAT!  I used salted butter instead of margarine and lowered the oven to 325, as we like our cookies soft. I made Halloween cutout cookies and turned out perfect.  Dough is easy to work with and tasted great with icing or without.  They were even spicier the next day. Gave away to neighbors and family and they raved also. The only problem is the recipe didn't make enough cookies.  Will definitely make again and double the recipe.  THANKS!

These are the very best gingerbread cookies I have ever tried! Everybody in my family just kept eating and eating them. If you don't over-cook them they are so chewy and delicious! The dough is easy to roll out between two sheets of waxed paper. I didn't change the recipe at all. I can't wait to make them again next Christmas!!!

Wonderful cookie!!  Doubled the recipe, used butter instead of margarine, Splenda for Baking instead of sugar, half of the cloves, but the rest exactly as stated in recipe (except doubled of course).  They rolled out like a dream.  I had a small gingerbread man cookie cutter, and was able to get 7-1/2 dozen men out of this!!  This is the ONLY recipe I will use now for gingerbread men.  Thank you, thank you, Steph67

Tasty and very easy to make and work with.  I used my stand mixer's pastry attachment and rolled the dough between wax paper.  Came out beautifully, and my 2 year old enjoyed making and eating them.

I made these today with my ten year old for a girls scout bake sale tomorrow. What a yummy recipe! Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews referring to sticky dough. This is a dream dough and I believe those reviews were transferred to this recipe when a different recipe was removed from the site. Easy to work with and delicious.

OMG!  These cookies turned out great.  My family loved them, the flavor was spot on!  I made two batches to share with family / friends (two weeks ago) and am about to make more for Christmas because everyone keeps asking if I'm going to have them.  They stay soft and chewy on the inside if you make them a little thicker but are all crisp on the outside.  YUM

This was a simple, easy cookie to make.  I made it exactly like the recipe.  Cooked them for 8mins and then let the cool for 5mins on cookie sheet before trying to move then to cooling rack.  They were soft and a little chewy!  It wasn't as spicy as I like, so I will increase the amount of all the spices next time.  I frosted some of the cookies and liked it,  but I was going for spicy and sweet.

Took these to Thanksgiving last year and everyone raved! I followed the suggestion to double the spices except for the cloves, and added a dash of cayenne pepper (people seemed intrigued when I told them that was the secret!). I cut them out into leaf shapes and iced them with Royal Icing I recipe from this site, and dusted them with gold cake shimmer. Everyone loved them, both the taste and presentation. This will be my go-to gingerbread recipe, hands-down!! UPDATE: These cookies have won me an award at a cookie exchange! I give the credit to Eileen and shared the link to this recipe. Thank you!

Great recipe. Easy for young children to help with. Double up (or more) on all the spices - except cloves. Chill for 2 hours to reduce stickiness, and roll between sheets of wax paper. It was not super spicy (even though I doubled the spices), but great for most kids' palettes. I am not a frequent baker, yet I found this easy to make, and got rave reviews.

Out of the 4 recipes I tried, this was the only cookie cut-out dough that didn't crumble into a mess. The cut-outs were perfect & easy enough for my 2 year old to help with. The cookies taste great too - I didn't know I liked gingerbread & my daughter thinks they are, "Yum! Really good cookies!"

I found the 1/2 cup molasses too strong in taste with the first batch so I reduced it to 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup golden syrup which turned out much better.

I bake a lot from scratch because we have an 8 year old with Crohn's Disease (intestinal inflammation).  Food doesn't change the disease, as in Celiac, but it reduces the symptoms.  

He's lactose intolerant because of the disease (among other things).  He's sensitive to some spices too.  He does very well with ginger and it helps his belly!!  Nevertheless, I'm always looking for kid-friendly, simple, and Crohn's friendly foods and this recipe is it.  

Thus, I reduce the cloves etc. and bump-up the cinnamon and ginger.  I use SmartBalance lactose-free butter.  I LOVE basic recipes that allow me to make these changes.

I like how you used the egg yolk to get the consistency right--the cookies have the potential to be soft--but not cakey or goopy.  You indeed don't need the egg white as I've seen as a mistake in other recipes.  50/50 on the powder and soda, very nice.  I bake for 8 minutes and they are PERFECT!  

Also, this dough works great with parchment paper and doesn't stick or require flouring.  I live in Germany as well, and I'd say they rival what you'd find in our markets.  

THANKS for posting a great recipe, it's helping a kid with a disease that is not so great...

Really good!  I changed the spice mix a little just for my own taste.  Basically it's a really good, easy gingerbread men recipe.  Just change the spice ratios to suit your fancy!

Really liked these cookies. Spices seemed just right to me, not overly spicy I thought, just a little. Cut out beautifully and held their shape wonderfully during baking. Made great gingerbread men.

So last night the girls and I made this. I'am not sure where we went wrong, we measured everything out & followed directions carefully. It was too dry and crumbley we couldn't get it to stick together to make gingerbread men. So instead we made regular cookies. They came out looking funny but the taste was fantastic, real spicy & delicious.

I like the taste and texture of the recipe, but I had some problems with this one. I had to add A LOT of flour to the already chilled dough...I did not measure out how much extra flour I added, as I did it by the feel of the dough. I would say I probably used at least an extra half cup of flour. I prefer softer cookies, which is one of the reasons I enjoy this recipe because they turn out soft for gingerbread, but even after they cooled we had a hard time with gingerbread legs falling off and other shaped cookies cracking. I think because these are soft, that caused this to happen. Either treat them very delicately, which I felt that we were doing, or let them cook a minute or two longer. When they broke apart, we "glued" them back together with the royal icing I made. All in all, I was happy with how everything turned out, but it took me a lot longer to make the dough since I rolled it out, after rolling it, realized it was too soft, then had to add more flour, and then re-roll the dough out again. Kind of a pain! They taste great though and look cute, so I would use this recipe again but just use more caution when making it and handling the cooked cookies.

The first batch I made, I added 1/2 cup additional flour as one of the comments indicated...way too dry and crumbly!  Ended up fighting with it for a while and throwing some out because it would not stay together.  For the 2nd batch, I followed the exact recipe with some additional spices and it was perfect.  I guess that teaches me to always try the recipe as is first :)

Thanks for a great and tasty gingerbread recipe!

The dough was really sticking but easy to work with after chilling. I used a really big cookie cutter and just baked longer. Delicious but not very "spicy"

Not bad. The dough is a pain in the butt because it thaws quickly and sticks to the pin/surface no matter what. Also, make sure your cookie cutters are well defined! Mine have tiny arms so almost all of them got ripped off and was frustrating having to mold makeshift arms back on them. Not spicy at all, and I added more spice than the recipe called for. Hoping the home made cinnamon icing goes well on these!

I thought these were just OK. I was cooking them in a different oven than my own so it could have played a part in how they turned out, but I thought they were a little bland and came out very hard and dry. Also I never cook with processed foods so I used butter instead of margarine.

If you are a die-hard fan of gingerbread, loving the rich & deep flavor, then you will find this recipe very tame.  The recipe was mild in spicy flavor.

This recipe is good, it needs some tweaking....I used about 1 1/2 cup of flour, trippled the spices because it didn't seem to be that spicy of a gingerbread.  I subbed 3/4 brown sugar for the white sugar.  I will be making these again, and I will probably go ahead and use the 2 cups of flour, and only 1/2 c brown sugar and only double the spice instead.  The dough really needs to be refridgerated longer than I did, it was very sticky and my gingerbread men looked more like dough boys! They spread out and were difficult to get off the parchment paper to the cookie sheet.  But if made the way I tweaked it, they were still excellent in taste, just much more spicy!

I loved the wonderful flavor the cookie.  My only problem was my  douch was too soft and sticky and I had a hard time doing the gingerbread men. SO, I just rolled the dough into small balls and pressed them with a fork.  I must have not mixed my dough correctly, to little flour?..anyway, something was off but I think it was me.  We all loved the taste of the cookie and I will make this one again.  I just need to figure out why my dough was so un-rollable (is that even a word?)

Oh man... this is a dough I will see in my nightmares. It was AWFUL to work with! I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was so crumbly. I couldn't roll this out, so I just flattened some in to circles and baked. They tasted okay, but I won't be using this recipe again. I don't know what happened.

This cookie has a great taste but the dough is difficult to work with. The only thing I changed was I used 1 1/2 tsp of real,  finely grated ginger to subsitute the powder ginger and baked a little longer. I did use a lot more flour than I intended when I rolled it out to be cookie cut (a little sticky). But overall a very good recipe.

Great recipe! I switched the white sugar to brown. And ended up using about 3 1/2 cups of flour.  I sprayed some canola oil Pam on the wax paper before rolling it out and they came off of the paper a lot easier.

I have never made gingerbread cookies before and was always a little reluctant to do so because I am not one for Very spicy or hard gingerbread cookies. Making the dough was so easy and quick! After the allotted cooling time in the fridge the dough was so very easy to work with!! It didn't crumble or stick! I left them in for the min. amount of time (8min) and after cooling and frosting the cookies were absolutely delicious! Hard on the outer edge of the cookie and so nice and soft in the center.....This will forever be my go to gingerbread cookie recipe and I have already made 2 more dough mixes and placed them in the fridge because my daughter and husband ate all the ones we made this afternoon!

i used butter instead of margarine, and doubled all the spices except for the cloves, which i only increased by 50%.    the dough is definitely soft, but i chilled it and rolled it between pieces of waxed paper...and i'd say these are pretty great!    they have a different texture than most gingerbread- they don't have that thick, heavy cakey crumb; instead, they have the chewy denseness of any recipe with a large volume of humectant...i don't know that i can explain it very well...a crisp chewiness around the edges like melted, then hardened marshmallow. anyhow- great with royal icing, and they stay soft forever! note that they're quite spicy if you double/1.5x all the spices-- and i highly recommend it!! (i know- it sounds like a pretty hefty amount of spice...but they're amazing).  recipe update: i added another 2-3 tbs sifted flour and they're perfect for me :-) another recipe update (after making these for the third time in 10 days!!): this is 100% the gingerbread recipe i will use from now on.

I just made these cookies and they are delicious! I used all the ingredients in the original increments and had no issues stickiness or a cardboard taste.  They are the perfect consistency and taste just like bakery gingerbread cookies.    I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and rolled them out between parchment paper which reduces the total amount of flour--but they didn't need more than 2 cups anyway!  These are definitely going into my personal recipe book.  Thanks!

Thus far, my first batch of these did spread... I'm going to freeze the second pan for a bit before baking in hopes that they hold their shape better. Besides that, these had a wonderful taste, and I made sure to watch them carefully as they baked so they didn't overcook and turn into gingersnaps. When making the dough, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and some extra ginger and cinnamon and cut the clove in half. I may add close to an extra 1/2 cup flour next time. Overall, Yummy! Who needs icing?

These were awesome!!  My husband is really picky about his gingerbread, but these disappeared pretty quickly!!  If you like a really spicy cookie I would increase the amount of spices you use, but for my family they were just right!!  Kept in an airtight container they stayed nice and chewy-soft.  THis will be my only gingerbread recipe from now on!!

One of the best cookies I have made.  We made 10x the recipe for a gingerbread decorating activity at the local community centre.  We used butter instead of margarine and brown sugar instead of white and decreased the amount of cloves to 1/2 tsp per recipe instead of 1 whole tsp.  Will definitely make again!

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have made, and will continue to make. Everyone expects these little cookies for christmas every year from me. I havent had any problems with them being too sticky but i make sure to chill them overnight, I also double the amaount of cloves and cinnamon. (i love cloves!) I flatten out the dough to about an 8th of an inch thick and cut tons of these little cookies out. They are AMAZING with coffee!!! My mother in law keeps trying to persuade me to make them for every holiday!

My youngest grandson loves gingerbread cookies.  Made 2 batches at Christmas for cut out cookies.  The 1st batch followed directions to the "T".  2nd batch made a little different.  Used 1 c brown sugar (in place of white sugar)  and 1/2 c molasses & 1 whole egg.  Decorated with buttercream frosting.  Both batches were perfect & the kids (& adults) had a blast decorating the cookies at a Christmas cookie party I threw for them!  ***Made 2 batches again for Valentine cut outs.  As suggested by a reviewer added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to 1 batch of gingerbread dough.  Wow!! What a cookie.  I used royal icing to decorate the Valentine cookies and the spice went so well with the icing.  Perfect cookies.  Thanks Steph67 for a great cookie recipe.

These were awesome! They spread more than I thought they would, so I had some stuck together. But the flavor was awesome, I had several people tell me they loved them because they were spicier. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and used ginger, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice, because it was all I had on hand. I frosted them with my buttercream frosting, but not covering the entire cookie. (They were footballs, so the laces and sides were white.) They were fabulous!

I make several batches of these every Christmas for my students. People keep telling me that lots of kids don't like gingerbread cookies but I get nothing but raves! They're SO good!! Instead of using flour while rolling I found it better to use powdered sugar. They don't dry out as easily and the extra sweetness is always good! They aren't "spicy" but they do have a kick to them. A nice coating of royal icing or glaze makes them perfect.

The flavor of these were incredible. It is important to keep the dough as cold as possible though. If you don't, the cookies will spread to unrecognizable shapes. I froze my cutouts before putting them in the oven. They still spread, but not so much that I couldn't decorate them.

My 6 year old begged to make gingerbread cookies for Christmas this year, and I'm so glad I chose this recipe!  It is so yummy, and my family really enjoyed them.  It's a perfect gingerbread flavor, and they hold their shape well after being cut out.  Thanks!

This is the best recipe I've ever found for gingerbread cookies.  My husband was never a fan of gingerbread before I made these -- now it's the only cookie he requests at holiday time.  The only change I make is that I roll them out just a little bit thicker than the recipe suggests.  They are soooo good with a cup of tea.  These cookies last very well so I usually double the recipe.

yes, DO NOT use blackstrap molasses, or they end up just tasting like molasses cookies. First time I used all molasses, second time I used half molasses, half honey, but they still tasted like molasses cookies and nobody guessed that they were actually supposed to be gingerbread men.

Use butter! Cloves were too much for me so i use less. I've made these cookies a half dozen times. They're chewy and soooo good. The dough is really sticky to rollout and cut so I put it between two sheets of plastic or parchment, roll it, freeze it for a few minutes then cut it. It's less messy this way too.

I love these cookies. I made them last year for Christmas and I think they were the best gingerbread men I had ever tasted!  Had to look them up again and save them to my box.  I only had to bake mine for 6 mins, so i suggest watching your first batch carefully.

I got rave reviews on these cookies. Everyone seemed to love them. They do have a stronger flavor than most gingerbread, I think. With the dough, at first it almost seemed like it was dry but I squashed it all together and it was good. I rolled it out between two pieces of parchment before I put it in the fridge and that worked great. If I'd just rolled it out on its own it probably would have been too sticky but the parchment prevented that problem. Also, I baked mine for about 6 min and people liked the fact that they were still a bit soft.

True, there is a great variety of reviews on this recipe.  I read many and made a few adjustments.  I used 1/2 corn syrup and half molasses.   I used 3 cups of flour and two sticks of butter.  I actually added the three cups of flour by accident and so I added the second stick of butter little by little until  the dough was smooth but not sticky.  I cut back a bit on the cloves-not quite half a teaspoon.  Other than that, all else was the same.  I had snow on the deck so I rolled the dough between wax paper to the desired thickness and placed on a cookie sheet on the snow for about an hour so it didn't take up room in the fridge.  I piped cream cheese frosting on mine-great with the ginger.  Really good recipe overall.

Made them with blackstrap, and they were DELICIOUS.  If you like a really spicy cookie, don't be afraid to use strong molasses!  Only add more flour when REALLY REALLY need it -- just enough to make the dough workable, and so it doesn't stick to your rolling pin.  Too much flour makes a really dry cookie, and dilutes the tastes that you really want.  Also, watch those babies when they're in the oven!  I left my first batch for ten, and they burned around the edges.  Still made an amazing, crispy cookie.. but definitely burned.  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Very very yummy! My husband and I made these together because he loves gingerbread men. The spices are scrumptious when blended perfectly. I didn't do the pumpkin spice substitution because I felt it needed the extra clove seasoning by doing the measurements separately. I did, like the others, have trouble with the dough. We added about 1/2 cup more flout and refrigerated again and they rolled out beautifully. Don't roll the dough too thin though or you may have to do surgery on your little men for lost appendages! Enjoy!

This is very good!  The cookies turned out perfectly.  I used butter, cut the cloves to 1/2 t, and baked for around 6 minutes.  The dough didn't smell good (the molasses smells gross), and I didn't think I would like the cookies, but they are great.  The dough consistency was really crumbly - I thought I did something wrong - but when I rolled it out it was fine.  They are very soft and taste great.

Very good, however mixture was SO sticky, I too, had to add more flour and chill a lot longer than an hour to make it manageable. The prep time needs to include chill time. They taste great when they're finally done.

Most amazing cookies ever... I have decided to make it a traditional cookie I always make and keep around the house for guest etc. I love the taste and the crunchiness.. Also i substituted the molasses with golden syrup. Made it about 3 times already and all the times its turns out perfect.

I really liked all the spices in this recipe.  The consistancy of the dough, however, could be much better.  It was sticky - needed flour - and was difficult to roll even after refrigerating several hours.  Also, the recipe makes quite a small amount and it should be doubled to make it worth your while.  Anyway, I'll make again with alterations as aside from a poor dough, the flavor was good!

Very difficult to work with.  Like the previous reviewer, I had trouble with the stickiness of the dough.

Perhaps it's because I live in the Caribbean (my kitchen is about 81ºF this evening) and the air is generally humid (thus adding to the stickiness of the dough, but I found that I had to add an additional 3/4 c of flour just to get the dough to a workable stage where I could remove it from the bowl, and in doing so, I burnt out the motor on my electric mixer!!! 

Damage to my mixer aside, I found myself very hard pressed to give this recipe 1 star.  The dough smells wonderful, and I look forward to sampling the cookies tomorrow when my roommate and I (both  Canadian expats living overseas) try them, but the difficulty I encountered in this recipe isn't worth the effort of trying it again next year.

I was really worried when I made the dough- it was so crumbly I couldn't imagine that they could be rolled out. Chilled them overnight. They weren't the easiest to roll out, but they kept their shape really well when baked and are the best tasting gingerbread cut outs I've made. I used organic veg shortening instead of margarine and added an extra tsp of cinnamin. So yummy with or without frosting.

I used this recipe for gingerbread men to hang on the Christmas tree.  I sub shortening for the margarine since we wouldn't be eating them (if we were going to eat them, I'd have sub'ed butter)

The dough came out fine and was nice to work with.  I ended up with 20-22 6 inch tall gingerbread men.

The review that substitued brown sugar for white, b.sugar will give you a softer textured cookie, white sugar will make them crisp-so your next batch should come out just like you're hoping.

I just tried making these cookies, and in the process of "blending" the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients, the batter turned all crumbly.  It was in no way smooth...I hope that by being in the fridge for a couple hours they will still be able to hold shape when baking.

I just baked a tester batch because of the skeptism that built up after reading a few reviews.  My conclusion is that if you follow the recipe with the exception of adding a few extra touches of flour here and there you will have a delicious cookie at the end! They came out moist at 8 mins and oh so good! Dont be turned off by the smell of molasses because it does go away once you bake the cookies.  All that's left is the spicy hints of cloves, ginger and cinnamon.  One thing, I wasn't sure if it was ground ginger or real ginger so I added the real thing.  Worked out really well!! thanks so much for the great recipe =)

This was good, but a little disappointing.  I doubled the allspice and cloves, tripled the cinnamon and ginger and added a few shakes of nutmeg, but the spices were still hard to taste through the molasses.  I tried this recipe because I was short on time and it didn't call for refrigeration, but the dough wasn't managable until it had an hour in the fridge.  The cookies puffed up too much to hold their shape well and the texture was a bit on the cakey side.  But they were still nice in their own way.

this is a very tasty gingerbread. like others, i have found it a bit sticky when rolling out the dough, but well worth the work.  i use the butter frosting recipe on this site that you cook over the stovetop for a wonderful icing on the cookie.  mmm.mmm.mmm.

I used brown sugar as others suggested and this was FANTASTIC!  The flavor is strong but not overbearing and the texture is perfect.  This one is a keeper.

These ended up being GREAT cookies!  Even my 3 year old ate them!  Great cookie to cut out and decorate. I substituted 3/4 cup brown sugar for the 1/2 cup white sugar so they would be sweeter and chewy.  It worked great.  I also dont think I used quit 2 cups flour- maybe 1 3/4 cup and they where a bit dry.  I only baked mine for 8 minutes, again so they wouldnt be so hard.  Oh and I reduced the amount of cloves to 1/2 t. and it was plenty!  Thanks for the great recipe, I will make these again!

This gingerbread cookie is the best one I've tried yet. Not too moist and not too crunchy. And very kid friendly, my daughter loves making these. For a bit of a change for those who don't like cloves use allspice instead. Taste great.

I very much enjoyed this recipe.  I let it chill for over an hour.  The dough was still pretty sticky and had to use heavy amounts of flour on the rolling pin and surface.  I had a 5.5" gingerbread man and I only generated about 16 cookies.

The cookies were quite tasty, but not spicy enough for me. I doubled the spices and used allspice instead of cloves, but I didn't get that nice bite that gingery gingerbread has. Next time I'll add more ginger and cinnamon.

I have yet to start my baking this year, but I've used the recipe for the past two holiday seasons and will always be a staple. The cookies come out well put together, but quite moist and stay moist for days! I always get rave reviews and it's probably the only thing my Jewish boyfriend gets excited about around Christmas time!

These cookies are phenomenal! Very easy to make. I halved the recipe to test it out, and decreased the amount of cloves. Also used butter instead of margarine as well as freshly ground cinnamon. 

I'm definitely going to be giving these out for the holidays. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used slightly less cloves when making these but they are by far my favorite gingerbread cookie recipe.  They are spicy but I love them that way.

With a few changes this is a very good recipe. I have to agree with some others on cutting back the amount of clovers from the original 1 ts. to ½ ts. The full amount leaves an after-taste in your mouth. I also found using ¾ cups of molasses a must as well. As one had suggested, I divided my batter up into halves, which worked out well.

If one doesn’t care for making cookie cutter shapes, you can use the old drop spoon method, which then you would not need to cool dough before shaping and no rolling would be needed.  I also agree with a fellow baker on baking for 6 mins only, if you want soft/moist cookies. I will make again but will double the recipe for I found it only made 2 ½ dozen using a medium size cookie cutter.

This recipe was great! I didn't have any problems at all with it being sticky which was surprising since I only chilled it for 20 minutes in my freezer (I couldn't wait!). They turned out very nicely. I might add a little less cloves next time.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I used a whole egg b/c the yolk broke into the white while I was separating and I couldn't be bothered.  LOL  I also omitted the cloves (yuck), and used 1 t. cinnamon.  I never use the full amount of salt...ever.  Just a dash'll do ya!  I chilled it all day, and it only got a little sticky as it sat out while I was rolling it.  Also, I personally think the dough smelled kind of gross (molasses), but they baked up heavenly and so good.  I really liked these, and will make them again.  This will be my 2nd gingerbread cookie recipe for the files... :)  I bet if you threw in a bit of chopped candied ginger, it would be even spicier!  thanks!

I feel a little unfair in giving this one star, because although it didn't work for me at all, based on the other positive reviews I think it may be something I did wrong along the way.  I am in Australia, and thought molasses was American, but managed to find some here so thought it would be the same.  Not sure if that was the problem - but I doubled the recipe, and the result was 40 or so great looking cookies that tasted...well awful!  They were salty (I used 1 tsp for double the recipe) and really terrible.  They almost had an overpowering baking powder flavour.  I ended up throwing them out, which was very disappointing!  Has anyone got any tips for me?  Sorry Eileen - I'm sure this is a wonderful recipe, but didn't work out for me this time!

This was the perfect gingerbread recipe, everything you want gingerbread to be.  It had great flavor, rolled and cut well, and stayed chewy.  The only warning I will give is that these oookies grow!  I used a bigger cutter and my men were huge!  As far as some other members complaining about flour issues, I would have to say it could be a climate issue.  I used exactly what the recipe prescribed and my dough was a little sticky, I just took care to handle and roll it sparingly.  I didn't use any flour to roll or shape because I didn't want to have dry,flour tasting cookies.  This will be my gingerbread cookie recipe from now on!

Delicious gingerbread cookie recipe. As with all gingerbread cookie recipe if you like them soft and not snappy, be sure to take out of oven before edges are brown. This recipe is perfectly sweet, perfectly spicey and a lovely soft, puffed, buttery but not greasy texture. If dough is cold and they are cooked at proper temp. they come out neat looking and not too "fat" spread out like some gingerbread recipes. I've tried MANY gingerbread recipes and this is my favorite. My go to recipe for gingerbread and I make LARGE batches (I'm the one relied on for gingerbread. ;) ) for family and friends every christmas. :)

Excellent taste, but like others found, the dough was pretty gooey, so next time will add another 1/2 c or so of flour...I doubled the recipe, no probs, made about 45 cookies from this...helps to roll dough kinda thick to keep inside soft and outside crispy - after addiing the flour, they cooked crispier.

This recipe is fabulous! I made gingerbread for the first time today and my family raved. I rolled it out a bit thinner than 1/4 inch and cooked for too long (10 min.) and accidentally added double the amount of ginger, but they still turned out great with chewy middles + crunchy edges! Next time I'll definitely make them as thick as they should be (for maximum chewiness), and cook for 7-8 minutes or so compared to the 10 minutes they cooked today (any longer than 10 min = very crunchy cookies). I cut mine with cat-shaped cookie cutters and decorated them in pink icing with cat faces and some silly words like "I love you!" "Eat me," "I'm cute," "Hello there," "Hee-hee" (but that's probably too much information) I'll post a picture soon! I found that icing the entire surface did not allow the lovely gingerbread colour to show through :) I would also triple the recipe, as I doubled it today and still don't think it was enough dough to make very many 1/4 thick cookies. (I got about 30-40 medium-sized cookies from doubling the recipe, and rolling them thinner than they should be)

I should have read more closely--I used blackstrap molasses. My batch of cookies tastes WAY to much like molasses. Live and learn. I'm sure these are perfectly wonderful if they are made correctly. I'm writing this review as an extra warning to others.

I think these are the best cookies I've ever made. I coated them with a simple icing made from confectioner's sugar dissolved in milk with a little vanilla. My boyfriend didn't want me to share them.

These cookies turned out GREAT!  The only thing I would suggest is cutting down the Ground Cloves by 1/2 a tsp, it was a little over powering.  But the were Yummy, and I will make these again!

I used the exact recipe, except for the sugar. As an earlier reviewer suggested, I substituted 1 1/2 cup of brown sugar, for the 1 cup of sugar. I absolutely loved the flavor of these cookies! I just need to perfect my cookie cutting skills, as I ended up with a few Gingerbread Pirates

I like this recipe but might add more spice next time. Be sure to ONLY use the egg yolk - I threw in the whole egg and I think that might be why I needed to add so much flour to roll them out. I did chill overnight but still sticky. Anyway, it's pretty good and I will use it again next year!  Thanks

I kept getting my gingerbread recipes mixed up so I am writing this so I don't forget.  I like the flavor of these cookies but they were hard as a rock.  I think they would be better named ginger snaps.  I will keep searching for the recipe I made a few years ago. They were nice and soft.

I have never made gingerbread cookies before and I made these with my two year old daughter.  The recipe was super easy to follow and the cookies came out great, the perfect mix of spices!  I rolled the first few cookies a bit too thin, so they definitely do need to be 1/4 inch in width.  Thanks for the great recipe- I will be using this from now on.

This is a extremely yummy cookie! Just enough bite, soft and really yummy! I think you have to keep the dough in the fridge so it doesn't get soft and sticky. Great cookie I'd give 6 star if I could Thanks!

This is, hands down, the best gingerbread recipe I've tried so far.  I did make some changes.  I used butter instead of margarine, 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the white, and I doubled the spices because I love a very spicy cookie.  The resulting cookies are soft and chewy, with a wonderful flavor, unlike many of the hard, flavorless recipes that I've found so far. I chilled the dough for several hours, starting it out in the freezer.  This gave me plenty of time to roll it and cut it before it got too soft to work with.  I didn't add any extra flour at the beginning, but I did flour my work surface.  Great recipe!!

This is a great recipe! I definitely had to knead more flour into the dough before rolling, but i expected as much.  My little gingerbread guys held their shape perfectly, and the taste is delightful.  I tripled the recipe and all worked out fine.  I made royal icing from 3 egg whites, whipped into peaks, 3 cups powdered sugar, and some root beer extract to keep the spiced flavor.  Enjoy!

Best gingerbread cookies I've ever made. Spicy and delicious. I did use butter instead of margarine.

Edit:
I've been making these for a few years and these are my modifications. I use butter instead of margarine. I add a serving of benefiber to help prevent spreading. I use just a little less sugar than the recipe calls for, because I roll with powdered sugar rather than flour. I also put about 1.5*spice.
To roll, I take off a chunk of dough and put the rest back in the fridge. I use powdered sugar instead of flour, roll the dough out, flipping regularly to make sure it doesn't stick to my board. I cut the cookies out of the dough just once, roll that dough up and put it back in the fridge, and grab a different, cold chunk to repeat. The dough is much easier to work with when is cold and using sugar instead of flour help with tast and toughness in my opinion.

This recipe has been a big hit with my family.  I made them twice recently--as written.  We all loved the cookies, decorated or not.  They will be the go-to for gingerbread!  Thanks for this recipe.

I followed Darling Dash's suggestion and used 1.5 cups flour and 3/4 cups brown sugar and also doubled the spices except the clove. They were delicious! Really hard to roll out until you get the hang of it. I rolled between two pieces of parchment with generous amounts of flour. I separated the cut cookies with a metal floured spatula. My cookies for some reason really poofed up (might be the different brand of baking soda I used...) so I had to roll them really really thin, less than a fourth of an inch. They were super tasty though!

I used butter instead of margarine.  Based on other reviewers and the texture I had when I worked with the dough, I added a handful of flour.  I also added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper because I like my gingerbread spicy.  The dough was just fine, not tough and not too sticky -- be sure to refrigerate for 1 hour before you roll it out, though.  When I pulled it out of the fridge, the dough was cracked a little, but when I worked it in my hands the heat helped to meld it all together again.  Keep some flour on-hand to cover the rolling pin just enough to not stick and definitely roll it out on parchment paper.  Overall, an OKAY cookie.  Next time, I will use less molasses and more sugar because the flavour leaves a molasses after-taste that is slightly overwhelming.

The flavor was not bad, but the recipe needs a serious flour amount adjustment.  I was stuck for a recipe in a hurry and hoped this would be good, but with the sticky inaccurate consistency of the dough, it was disappointing. I shouldn't have to read reviews to make a recipe with a 4 1/2 star rating come out properly.  Please rate the recipe based on its initial quality, not your tweaked versions.

Just nibbling on my first bite out of the oven.  These are delicious!  Plenty spicy IMO, and we have pretty heavy spice-tolerance in our household.  I substituted 1 stick unsalted butter for the margarine called for by the recipe, and I did use blackstrap molasses, which IMO makes these marvelous and rich flavored -- but I tend to prefer my cookies with a little 'bite' of bitterness (think Oreos without the filling), so the blackstrap was great for that.  Healthy, too.  You definitely can't skip the chilling-in-the-fridge stage, or the dough is too sticky, but with a very small dusting of flour, the chilled dough rolled out beautifully.  Remember not to roll it too thin, too, because your cookies will be crispy and brittle; thicker cookies are better here.  This one's going into the annual-recipes box!!!  Thanks!

I did not use cloves- I didn't have any- but I thought the flavor was just perfect, definitely spicy but not over the top. When rolling out the dough it got soft pretty quickly, so you have to work quite fast and keep the excess in the fridge. Keep dusting your surface and even the spatula to move them to the tray. However, it is so worth it. They bake beautifully. I let them go 10 minutes- I prefer a little crispness, and found them perfect.---After cooling I used a white frosting and a gingerbread flavored frosting and they tasted fab.

Warning Australians!! " Molasses" is what we call Golden Syrup. I learnt this the hard way, Australian molasses in this recipe was revolting, way too overpowering. Use golden syrup and its beautiful :) thanks!

These are great cookies! I made two variations of them - one exactly as directed above and one modified by suggestions by previous reviews. My modification substituted 3/4th brown sugar for the white sugar, I doubled all the spices listed EXCEPT for cloves, and I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. Extra flour is NOT necessary - just separate into 3 sections and let the dough chill. I like spicy and found it in my modified version. In my option, the as-advertised version were quite mild. I chilled my dough for 3 hours and it worked great rolling with flour. I rolled my dough to 1/4th inch using my rubber rolling pin guides/spacers which you can find online if you're interested. I used a 3x2-1/2 inch gingerbread man cookie cutter and I got 25 cookies out of the as-directed batch and 30 out of the modified batch. I used the recipe for holiday cooking and would probably triple my modified recipe if done again. I baked mine for 8 minutes - took them out and immediately scooped them onto cooling racks - they turned out chewy and delicious. Resist the urge to over-bake or add flour! Royal icing is my suggestion for decoration.

Turned out perfect. Used butter instead of margarine, and the batter was very easy to roll out after chilling; not gooey or dry at all. Used only a few pinches of the tops of whole cloves; otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

These are fantastic!  Perfect soft cookie with a delicious and not over-powering gingerbread flavor.  I did add a 1/2 c of flour as other posters recommended but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  Even working with small portions from the refrigerator the dough needed to be a little stiffer.  We ended up making another batch.  A keeper for our Christmas cookies!

Absolutely outstanding. Only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine. 
I'm a bit of a "Cookie Queen" - and these are without a doubt my absolute favourite cookies. Enjoy !! (And make double batch, at least!)

This dough is not sticky are hard to roll if you use a pin cover and pastry cloth.  You absolutely must chill the dough first.  I doubled the spice as I like mine strong.
Easy dough to work with, and bakes quickly to perfection.  I used a 3" ginger bread cutter and cooked in 8 mins.

i started making these only to find out i had no ginger and only whole cloves. so i omited the ginger altogeather, didnt have much patience to crush cloves up with a hammer so  only used about a 1/2 teaspoon of them. i threw in about a 1/4 tea spoon of allspice. they are fantastic!! i was told they taste like an awsome, soft version of the limited time only ginger snaps you can buy this time of year! thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is a very good recipe to use as a guideline to tweak to one's personal tastes.  Some other recipes are very heavy on molasses which turns a lot of people off, and I like to please crowds while also sticking to traditional tastes, and I found this recipe to be a very happy medium.  I also changed the spices a bit like many other reviewers to suit my personal tastes by doubling the cinnamon and halving the cloves as I think an entire teaspoon of cloves would leave a bad aftertaste--reminds me of the days when I used to smoke clove cigarettes.  Yuck. Also, I like my gingerbread chewy so I added another egg yolk, and I rolled them out between 2 pieces of parchment, therefore using almost no additional flour.  The results are phenomenal I will absolutely be making these again and probably doubling the recipe next time.

I really hate to post a negative review for my first review but my girlfriend and I just spent money and time making this dough and 5 hours later we pull the dough out of the refrigerator and it's like goo. Completely unable to work with it. So we tried adding more flour and let it cool again... Still goo... Not only that but rolled out as good as we possibly could and even if we COULD shape these, it would make MAYBE 10 cookies (totally average sized cookie cutter shapes). Really disappointed. What a waste of a Sunday.

This is the best gingerbread cookies recipe I have every tried. The spices balance so well not one ingredient over power another. The only thing I will change is reduce sugar to 1/4 cup. It is too sweet for my taste specially with icing. This will be the gingerbread cookies recipe for me.

Very good but these are the changes i made and they turned out perfect! 
Butter instead of margerine
Brown sugar
Chilled over night but then when i rolled it out i let it warm on the counter for about 20-30 min then it was easy to work with
Cooking time 6-7 min

Cookies turned out excellent! I added buttercream cinnamon frosting for an added touch. Mmmm :) My fiance has never liked gingerbread very much, but he loved these!

Awesome recipe.  I used butter instead of margine and they turned out great. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Tried this one today after a very disappointing attempt at Paula Deen's recipe, which had the consistency of slightly wet sand and was inedible. This is DELICIOUS and got an "Oh, yeahhh. Save this," out of my fiance. I didn't tweak the recipe at all and only chilled it an hour and it held together very well. I had to put a leg or two back on the men, but they taste delicious. I'll be making a bunch more next week to give out to neighbors and coworkers. I might add a little more ginger next time -- I love the cloves but I'd like a bit more ginger flavor -- and I think I'll try making a lemon or orange icing instead of eating them totally plain, but they're amazing. Eileen should call up Paula Deen and tell her how to actually make cookies.

My friends and family ask specifically for these gingerbread cookies and they always get compliments. It is a "spicy" recipe, but I love the flavor. These are flavorful, they don't even need icing. The dough is sticky to work with, but I work in small batches, keeping the dough in the fridge. Excellent recipe!

Living in Spain I can't find molasses, so i substituted for honey.  It was great.  I ran out of flour so I had to put in half if corn flour.  The dough was a bit hard to work with but chilled and being careful no to break the shapes as I passed them to the tray, it worked.  Since I re -rolled the leftover dough with some flour from flouring the cutting surface, the following batches we loosing flavour.  My last batch was forgotten in the oven too long and came out hard.  Watch out for the time!  Don't go over even though the dough looks a bit raw.  Once it cools it's perfect in only 7-10 min as the recipe says.

These cookies were pretty good. I also used 3/4 of brown sugar and a tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I gave it a 4 star rating, just beacuase the dough was so sticky. I used A LOT of flour on the roller and board.

These cookies are wonderfly soft and very spicy. I would recommend cutting the cookies thicker. If you cut them thin they burn or come out hard. The thicker cut cookies come out soft and wonderful. You will have to kneed some extra flour into the batter after chilling, but the cookies will still come out soft!

These turned out nice and chewy. I added more ginger for taste. I cut rounds and put on a white royal icing. They were really yummy.

There is NO possible way that this recipe makes 30 servings unless the cookies are the size of a penny, let alone how sticky the dough is. We've just spent over two hours getting to the point of cutting.

I gave this recipe three stars cause 3 of my kids liked it. As for the the other two children, my husband and me we were not pleased at all. Both me and husband did not like the after taste. I also had problems with the dough being too sticky. I tried this recipe twice thinking I did something wrong the first time, apparently I didn't.

A-MA-ZING! Loved them! Followed the recipe exactly as directed and they were perfect.  I made my own cream cheese frosting and it was a perfect complement to the yummy gingerbread flavor.  For those having a hard time with stickiness, my guess is they are not refrigerating the dough before rolling, or not refrigerating long enough. I refrigerated over night and did not have any problems with stickiness, just rolled out with flour like I would a sugar cookie. Very simple. Thank you for an awesome recipe.

These are great cookies! The way you always hope gingerbread will taste but rarely does. The recipe is easy and as long as you roll them cold (I use an icewater filled rolling pin) and use a sprinkle of flour they handle well. Someone suggested white chocolate for piping. I used almond bark-- I put a 4 oz chunk in the corner of a ziplock sandwich bag and melted in microwave (use the special melt setting or bag melts too.) Then snip a tiny corner off bag and pipe. All white piping looks beautiful and decoration hardens in minutes so they can be stacked.

These cookies can be made without refined sugar.  Replace the sugar with honey and add enough flour to make the dough the right consistency.  Have kids decorate with cream cheese and raisins.  ;)

I loved this!  I used the recipe pretty much just as it is but instead of margarine I used butter.  I used "grandmas" molasses.  Excellent recipe!  The spices are SPOT ON.

Great basic recipe. I made a few changes (butter instead of margarine and doubled the spices) and have made 4 batches to rave reviews! Yes, it's a wet dough - but an hour in the fridge and rolling out between sheets of parchment worked for me. Agree with the others - 1/4" and 8 minutes is perfect.

I agree with some others that these cookies are not spicy at all. There is definitely not enough ginger which is critical for gingerbread men. There also wasn't enough cloves as well. I actually found my dough to be too dry so I wet my hands with water when trying to bring it together. I don't think I'll make these again because they didn't have enough bite for me.

These came out very well.  My first time making gingerbread cookies.  I will say that they aren't particularly spicy.  This works well if you're taking them for a mixed group, but for my own tastes I'd like them spicier.

The perfect gingerbread men!  The dough was fairly spicy but the cookies are just right, nice and warm... the quintessential holiday treat.  I used vegan margarine to make them dairy free and it turned out perfectly, chilling the dough was essential.  Delicious and festive!

First off, I completely forgot about the suggestion for best flavor, to NOT use blackstrap molasses.  Wellll, I did.  I have to report that it was still FABULOUS!  I have never been a big fan of gingerbread and gingerbread cookies, but this recipe has made me a believer.  Even my persnickety 9 year old is a convert.  He said they were especially good dunked in milk.  I'm going to try making these again with reg'lar molasses and do a taste test, because if you get the best flavor NOT using blackstrap molasses, I can hardly wait to see what they taste like with the right ingredient!

These were great! I was concerned that a ginger cookie would be to strong for the kids so I looked at reviews to see what others said about recipes. I ended up settling on this one and am so glad I did. The kids and hubby loved them! I did add a 1 teaspoon of orange extract(something I saw on another cookie recipe) and that have a super yummy flavor. I will be saving this recipe for future use. Oh, and the kids had lots of fun helping with the cookie cutting. Thanks so much!

Delicious and very easy.   For the frosting, I mixed 1 lb of powdered sugar, 1 tbs cream of tartar, and 3 egg whites. This mixture hardens fast like glue if you want to make a house like I did.

I adjusted the spices per other reviewers' recommendations -- they obviously would have been pretty mild, otherwise.  Here's the thing about this (& probably every) gingerbread cookie recipe: it requires a LOT of precision.  Unless you are meticulous in rolling out the dough (which is, of course, sticky, -- I used powdered sugar rather than flour when rolling them out), they won't all be the same thickness & therefore won't cook evenly.  Also, I was using 3 different cookie sheets & could tell a pretty big difference in cooking times, etc., depending on which sheet I used.  This is a good, solid recipe, but there's lots of room for error here, so proceed with caution if you don't have a lot of baking experience -- or even if you're simply in a hurry!

Following the recipe, the dough was incredibly sticky--to the point it completely stuck to the wax paper I was rolling it between. I thought nothing stuck to wax paper! Using a cookie cutter was impossible because trying to remove the extra bits and pick up the cutout to place on the pan was virtually impossible. Another reviewer said that these cookies hold their shape well...and that is completely untrue! The 4 gingerbread snowmen I managed to cut out blew up to big blobs. Taste is OK, but not worth all trouble. You HAVE to work in at least a little more flour in to the dough!

I used butter instead of margerine and they turned out soft and chewy. The key to getting them soft is rolling the dough out thick and cooking no more than 7-8 minutes.

These cookies had a great spicy flavor to them, but they didn't turn out as soft as I normally like my cookies. That's probably my fault, but I can't say for sure. Crunchy as they are, they're still very good.

I was expecting more from this cookie.  I have been looking and looking and looking for a perfect gingerbread man recipe and I had hoped I had found it.  I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was very easy to work with.  The cookies puffed up well while baking, but when I pulled them out after the minimum 8 minutes, they were super flat and bumpy on top.  I let them cool anyway hoping for the best, only to bite into a gingersnap!  I let the next batch cook less, but they were still raw in the center.  I will try one last time and make the cookies thicker, but I still don't think this will be "the recipe" for gingerbread.

My sister and I made these tonight. Following one suggestion, we added 3/4 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar. We added a pinch of extra cinnamon, since we both love it. I think they turned out wonderfully! We did not add cloves. At 8 minutes on a light-coloured pan they were firm, well-cooked, and chewy. Gingerbread perfection! We'll definitely be making these again. :-)

This was the first time I have made gingerbread men. They turned out great after I took the advice from other reviews. I didn't change the recipe's measurements at all but I divided the dough into several small balls then put them in the freezer until they were stiff. I floured the countertop, rolling pin, and spatula. Then I took one ball out of the freezer at a time and prepared according to the directions. (One more thing do not roll out the dough to thin or it will stick to the counter.) I baked at 325 for 8 minutes.

The ONLY reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I followed others' suggestions and tweaked the spices a little.  I doubled the cinnamon (1 tsp) and halved the cloves (1/2 tsp).  This was PERFECT!!!  Wonderful flavor and texture.  Warning: the dough doesn't smell that great (I was really nervous!), but they taste fantastic when baked.  This will be a Christmas staple recipe from now on!

I love these cookies - I think the spice is just right!  I iced these and they are so tasty.  This is the first scratch gingerbread recipe I've used and I won't even bother trying others.  They are soft, but not too soft - really perfect...thank you so much for the recipe.  I am on batch 4 as I am giving plates away to friends and neighbors...yum!

These were very tasty. I did use a lot of flour when rolling these out so they wouldn't stick to the board/rolling pin. They spread more than I expected, so the men look kind of chubby. I used store-bought vanilla cake frosting to decorate them. I put some in a ziplock bag, cut a small hole in the corner, and squeezed the frosting onto the cookies.

Very good and very spicy.. any spicier and my KIDS (3 and 6) would not have eaten them so this is perfect. 8 minutes made chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside men. Thanks! Followed the recipe but lessened the salt to 1/4 tsp. and rolled out on powdered sugar.

These were good.  After reading some reviews, I used 2 1/2 cups flour, but the dough was very dry.  Next time I will try the 2 cups that the original recipe suggested.

Very good taste. To keep them soft DO NOT over work the dough. Used real butter instead of margarine. I did cut the cloves to 3/4 tsp as cloves are not our most favorite spice. Baked for 8 min.

First of all I refridgerated for longer then the suggested hour, roughly 12 hours or overnight if you wish and I had a heck of a time with the dough, it was dry and crumbly ( don't know where it went wrong :( ) But I stuck with it and was able to roll it in small pieces, I got 30 little gingerbread men as specified but I wasn't impressed with the taste, not sweet at all almost bitter :( Hopefully adding some icing in the morning will do something for the flavor, I was going to give these away as Christmas presents but now I'd be too embarassed for the lack of taste.... hopefully I can find someone to eat them, will not be making again, sorry, I'm glad though that others had success, these just weren't my cup of tea.... UPDATE: These actually turned out really well and I would like to retract my previous review, the next day after I decorated them they got rave reviews from everyone even my picky three year old who eats nothing, I did end up giving them away as gifts and now I have to make more ginger"boys" as my son has requested, hopefully the dough will work out better for me next time

So Good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  (except I subbed butter for mararine)Easy to work with, I threw the dough in the freezer while I heated up the oven, no problem rolling it out.  Followed other reviews, and kept the dough cold, along with the cookies sheets (put them in the fridge while waiting to go into the oven)  Did not have a problem with spredding at all.  Cookies came out soft and excellent.  (caution - don't roll out too thin) also, as with all rolled cookies, I use powdered sugar instead of flour to keep from sticking...maybe that's why they did not get to "cardboard like"

After reading a lot of the reviews I decided to make this exactly as the recipe directs. I actually used blackstrap molasses as it was all that I had on hand...despite the author's warning. After mixing the dough together I tasted it and almost threw the entire batch in the trash. The blackstrap was very strong, I could taste the iron in it, and it lacked sweetness. I decided to refrigerate it anyway so the kids could decorate cookies that night but didn't think anyone would eat them. Boy was I wrong! I let them roll out the dough between sheets of parchment paper and we didn't have any problems with sticking. They cut out their cookies and we baked them for almost ten minutes. The smell was heavenly and they tasted like gingerbread snap cookies. We decorated them with icing made from a bit of butter, lots of confectioners sugar, milk and a bit of vanilla extract. Even the kids loved these cookies. They weren't soft, maybe if I backed them less they would have been softer.

Absolutely delicious. I'll probably try adding more of the spices the next time I make them, because I like my gingerbread to be nearly overwhelmingly flavorful, but they're quite good the way they are.

This is a great gingerbread. I  love icing gingerbread men, so I make them and give them to friends and family at Christmastime. Everyone says they're delicous! It tasted good to me, even, and I don't like gingerbread.

This is a great recipe for cut out cookies. The spice was in the middle - I added a bit more ginger. A great tip is to work in small batches as you're rolling the dough out and put the rest in the fridge. Once this dough gets warm, it is tricky! We melted white chocolate and used that to pipe on decorations - much easier to stack and store than softer icing. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making gingerbread and it ws fantastic! This recipe was perfect, very easy, and delicious! I think I ended up eating most of the cookies myself because I am a gingerbread addict, but they went over really well with everyone else too. Can't wait to make them again!

Mmmmm spicy! Loved the cookie, stayed soft for the longest time. You don't have to store them in an airtight container either. I used more flour when rolling them out--otherwise you'll have a sticky mess. I'll make them again next year.

Best gingerbread cookies I've ever had!! Let me start by saying I have never baked anything from scratch before and I was extremely apprehensive about this recipe but the cookies turned out better than I had ever expected them to. I did make some adjustments based on other reviews posted here. I tried to lighten the intensity so I used 1/4 tsp cloves instead of 1 tsp and it proved to be just the right amount for me. And I increased ground cinnamon from 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp. Also, I used light brown sugar instead of brown, salted butter instead of shortening, and wheat gluten instead of egg. And I know everyone keeps saying the dough was very hard to work with, but even as a beginner I found it manageable. (I only worked with a fistful at a time and kept the rest in the freezer.) All in all, an absolutely cohesive and DELICIOUS recipe that doesn't lose its worth with adjustments. : )

this recipe is absolutly terrible, I couldn't get them to roll out, and even after being in the refridgerator all night, the dough still stuck to everything like glue and in an attempt to unstick it from the wax paper I was rolling it out on, it got pieces of the paper stuck in it... So much for this batch... I won't be trying these again

Great recipe for your traditional gingerbread.  The dough was durable enough to cut out our men, and after they baked, were still durable to decorate without damage.  That was a concern of mine.  After we decorated, we enjoyed a few, and they were moist and flavorful.  We made two dozen and donated them to the local Retirement home which really brought a smile to everyone's face.  I mean, who doesn't enjoy a gingerbread man for the holidays?

Okay i chose this recipe because everyone rated it high. I made it exactly to the recipe the first time and they were so so.. I was expecting something more rich in flavor and spicy. So I made them a second time and changed the recipe a little. It is a good recipe but here are my thoughts.. 

Here are the same problems I ran into twice.

1. Dough consistency super difficult to work with. It basically looks like mush.
- I added about 4 tablespoons of extra flour.

2. Dough extremely sticky and hard to roll out/cut out
-I took the advice of one member and separated one batch into 3 piles on lightly dusted wax paper and placed another piece of wax paper on top, then actually froze the dough for about an hour. Then I quickly rolled out the dough (still between the parchment paper) and stamped my cut outs leaving the dough I wasn't working with in the freezer. If the dough starts to get room temp it will be hard to work with. 

3. The cookies seemed to lack flavor. I was expecting something more robust and sweet.
- I substituted the sugar for brown sugar and added a 1/4 cup of white sugar. I added a tablespoon of Mexican Vanilla Extract. I also doubled up on all spices EXCEPT THE CLOVES (cloves can be really over powering in any recipe)

Hope this helps!

We made this recipe today and it is fantastic! I cut the cloves down to 1/2 tsp because of some of the reviews and they turned out perfectly! The dough was easy to work with (I just laid a piece of parchment paper on my counter lightly floured) and I found it was fine. The cookies are moist and very very tasty! My daughter has already asked me if I could make these again! Great recipe, thanks for sharing. Just to keep you all updated- these stayed moist for days in my cookie jar. Great cookie- didn't dry out at all

This is the absolute best gingerbread recipe I have ever tried.  I made them exactly as the recipe indicated.  I took the cookies to work and EVERYONE loved them...even the people that claimed not to like gingerbread.  This will be the only gingerbread recipe I use from now on!

Just what I was looking for, spicy gingerbread cookies.  I can make these soft or crispy.  My mother had a good recipe when I grew up, but when she gave me her recipe box, I couldn't find hers.  This is an excellent replacement!

I had to make adjustments to the recipe based on what I had at home. I used butter instead of margarine, 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey, halved the cloves and doubled the cinnamon. The dough was awful to work with! It was very dry and crumbly. I let it chill in the fridge for an hour before working with it, hoping that I could just knead it properly to get it to the right texture.
I ended up having to rub a dab of batter in my hands before kneading it to make the dough more pliable. 
The taste however, is superb! I baked them just until done, then pulled them out to sit on the cookie sheet for 1 min and moved to the cookie wracks after. The flavor is just spicy enough, and the texture is melt in your mouth soft, yet light. I love the flavor!
Perhaps when I make it again I will add 1 or 2 T of milk to the dough before chilling.

We loved this recipe, I made some minor variations to suit my two-year-old's taste (less cloves, more cinnamon) and these cookies barely even made it to frosting.  The dough was very easy to work with and the cookies even stayed just a little chewy until the next day, awesome.

This is a great start, however it needs a little tweaking. The amount of cloves is overpowering, next time I will only use half the amount, maybe less. I doubled the cinnamon, but next time I will triple or quadruple it. I used about 3/4 cup brown sugar, but they definitely could be a little sweeter. The dough was pretty hard to work with even though I chilled it, but I love the chewy texture it yielded. I also used butter instead of margarine because of taste and trans fat. I have a feeling these cookies are going to be five star the next time I make them with the modifications, but as written they only get three or four.

These are awesome!
I don't know what got into me, but somehow, instead of molasses i ended up using an equal amount of dark brown cane sugar. I realized my blunder only much later (when i was cutting my gingerbread into shapes). But I still did put them into the oven and bake for about 7 minutes.
The most incredible thing is that they were amaaazing!! Everyone loved them, they didn't taste like there was anything missing, and since i didn't use molasses the dough was awesome to work with and I did not even have to refrigerate it to make it pliable!
As far as the spices are concerned, this is a little on the milder side, but really good all the same!
Thanks!!
UPDATE:27/12/2009:
PHENOMENAL! I used a little less than quarter cup of golden syrup and a little more than quarter cup of brown sugar instead of molasses. I kept everything else the same and put a teeny tiny bit more of the spices to up the flavor. Refrigerated it for about 2 days (coz I couldn't work with it earlier). SPLENDID! No problem working with the dough whatsoever! Went on my christmas platter this year too!! :)

Very flavorful cookies; not at all too sweet, especially if you are putting frosting on them.  I have never had a flour issue with these.  I just make sure the dough is thoroughly chilled before rolling it on a well floured surface.  Soft, delicious cookies!

Double the spices... heap the cinnamon...  easy on the doubling the cloves and they are really good.  If your dough is a little sticky add flour when rolling them out and make sure the cookies are fat so when they are done baking they are chewy inside.  Sooo yummy and now a Christmas tradition in our house!

Very good - baked at 350 for 8 minutes a batch, and they came out well. Let cool on rack before trying to move them or they will break apart. Very flavorful..and I will use this recipe again! Substituted brown sugar for white and used spices as written.

Good Recipe! I am not going to rate the way the dough rolls out, it's just like every other dough--sticky and hard to roll out. BUT I will rate the taste. I loved this cookie. I baked the men for 7 minutes and they were perfect, soft and chewy. Once they were baked, they slid off the tray no problem. I used butter (I don't believe in margarine) and brown sugar for that extra molassas taste! I don't like cloves so I used pumpkin pie spice and extra ginger. Really nice and spicy. I will make these every chance I get. Thank you!

Great gingerbread recipe, I made it for work and everyone raved about it! I made a few changes, though, because I thought that it sounded a bit too spicy. I reduced the cloves and ginger to 1/2 teaspoon each and added more cinnamon instead. I also used corn syrup instead of molasses to make it a bit lighter.

This recipe really is very good! I substituted brown sugar for the white as suggested by other reviewers but that's all I changed. I was surprised at how few cookies the recipe made though - only 6 large ones - so now I have to go make another batch. :) I refrigerated my dough overnight and it wasn't sticky at all, or perhaps I'm just used to dealing with so-called "sticky" dough.

The cookies tasted great but that was only after we added a lot more flour. We tryed the recipe as the author wrote it and unfortunately the dough was way too gooey, even after we refrigerated it over night. But after we made the adjustments, cut and baked the cookies, that tasted great. These are the only gingerbread cookies that havent fallen apart on me.

Great flavor!  I didn't change anything except that I added 1/4C flour and the dough was easy to handle.  The other thing I would recommend is cooking for even less time...only 6-7 minutes for soft cookies.  Overall, a good gingerbread cookie recipe!

These were WONDERFUL!  My hubby loved them and he hates gingerbread.  First batch came out well, but when I doubled the recipe it was too sticky and floopy even after it was in the fridge overnight.  It needed a bunch more flour.  The single batch was fine.

Great recipe! All adults who tried loved them, and one called it "the best gingerbread cookies he's ever had."  Kid's had different opinions though.  My 4yo loved cutting these out and decorating them, but refused to even try it.  A neighbor child took one bite and politely asked if she "had to finish it" LOL.  So I think too spicy for some kids--especially picky eaters.

Followed the recipe exactly, and found that I did need to add more flour to be able to roll it out (even after letting it sit in fridge overnight). So I just kneaded some in with each portion I rolled out--no big deal!  

Cookies are moist and smell SO GOOD. This was my first experience with molasses though, and I was nervous because I thought it was stinky!  I didn't even try the batter because I thought it smelled bad, but that all changes in the oven!

I just made these cookies for Christmas and I was very frustrated and disappointed with the actual process of making them. The recipe says to chill for at least an hour, and I did that for probably 2+ hours. The dough would not roll out right, and even if I did manage to get it rolled, the dough would stick to the cutters and the wax paper I rolled it out on. I then froze the dough for at least an hour, but still only managed to make 2 actual cut-out cookies. I had three other kinds of cookies to make and I was very annoyed, so I shaped the dough into balls, rolled them in colored sugar, and flattened them on the cookie sheet. That resulted in very good cookies (the only reason it's even three stars for me), but still not the gingerbread men that I had hoped for.

Great recipe. I doubled the cinnamon and ginger and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. Rolled them out on waxed paper right away and didn't even have to use extra flour, they came out perfectly OK. My 6 year old picky eater absolutely loved them. Thanks so much!

These cookies were delicious. If you want a crispy, hard ginerbread man, roll the dough pretty thin. If you want a soft cookie, roll the dough thicker and bake for less time. However, I found that with my taller cookies they cracked a lot. So I recommend making smaller cookies. Also, the flavor of them gets better with time.

These cookies were delicious!  My mom and I made them together and we used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar.  We split up the dough in to three parts and put them in ziploc bags and left it in the fridge over night before we rolled them out and baked them.  Then we decorated them all with frosting.  These were so soft and delicious!  Just fabulous and perfectly spicy.  We loved them so much!

These were delicious, but by no means did each batch yield 30 cookies. I used a small cookie cutter, and rolled pretty thin. They're better rolled thicker, anyway.

Added some black pepper and finely chopped crystalized ginger as well as the required powdered ginger.  Wow, rock the house.  They cut perfectly and we decorated each for a  family member or friend to look like that person.  Hit of the holidays.  My daughter had me make 4 of her in her little pokadotted bathing suit.  Too cute.

These were really good!  I didn't have high expectations as the dough smelled kind of gross (I think it was the molasses) but they turned out great!  
I did have some difficulties rolling the dough out as it was a bit crumbly.
I used butter instead of margarine, plus I subsituted brown sugar for white as some other people mentioned, I also used whole wheat flour.

I have made several popular recipes on this site and never seem to have the luck that others do.  I was starting to think I was a cursed cook!  I wanted to make gingerbread cookies with my daughter and I'm glad I tried this recipe.  All I had was blackstrap molasses, so I used it, and my 3 year old daughter did NOT want to lick the beater.  Neither did my husband.  I thought I had wasted my time and made yucky cookie dough noone would eat.  I put off making the cookies until a day or so later. (The dough had hardened considerably under Saran Wrap, but still worked fine.)  My husband just doesn't care for gingerbread and never ate them, but my daughter LOVED them!  I thought she would remark that they were too spicy; instead she asked for them over and over again for several days.  Next time, I will double the batch.  I even printed up the recipe and included it in my Christmas cards (something I like to do.)  Thanks!!

Very good.  I did use butter instead of margarine and I didn't have ginger, so I used Chinese Five Spice Powder instead.  I think I actually like it with the Chinese Five Spice better than regular ginger, because the anise comes through.

Yum!  These cookies were very tasty!  I made two batches and used them for my "Gingerbread Family Kits".  In a clear plastic container, lined with holiday tissue paper, I filled them with gum drops, mini M&Ms, Twizzlers Pull&Peel, a tube of white decorator's icing and some delicious cookies!  Tie them with some holiday ribbon and a gift tag and they are ready to go.  They turned out so cute and are perfect for gifts! :-)

Wow. I'm not sure why this got such rave reviews. My husband had never tasted gingerbread before and I wanted to make some for him. My gingerbread boys turned into big blobs in the oven. I ended up rolling them into balls in sugar and pressing with the bottom of a glass to make round cookies. Nice but not the gingerbread boys I wanted. Also they turned hard like an hour later, even with me putting them in a covered container. Will not try this recipe again. By the way, hubby didn't like them, and I doubt he'll try gingerbread again.

I like really spicy gingerbread people, so I doubled all of the spices...even the ginger.  The first day, after then came out of the over, they weren't so good.  But the flavor the next day, after it had time to "meld" was fabulous.  I will make them again, but I might go a bit easier on the ginger and an eensy bit more cinnamon.

I really enjoyed these cookies, as did my youth group!  The cooking time was a little short I thought though.  If you want a crunchier cookie, give it a little extra time (@ 8 minutes, soft bake, so about 11-13 mins. should be about right).

I read the reviews and decided to add more cinnamon since it seemed like the general consensus agreed there wasn't enough "spice"...But it got too spicy.  :-P I'm going to try again with the proportions as listed.  The dough was perfect though and I waited exactly one hour.  I had no trouble cutting them into gingerbread people.  I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes and it was a bit much but I did cut them to the leaner side of the 1/4 inch.  Overall, I think the recipe is perfect, it's just a matter of measuring it properly, at least for me.

Your cookies turned out wonderful.  This was my first time ever to make gingerbread men, so I was a bit nervous that they would not turn out.  I searched recipes on the Internet for about an hour and chose yours...and could not have made a better decision!  The recipe is easy and so delicious.  I love the soft texture as well. Thanks!

This is a very good classic recipe.  My family loves this great fall treat, and the kids love to "dress up" their Ginger-people.

These turned out great!  My husband took them to work and he said they were gone within 10 minutes and they asked if he'd bring more!  I substituted 3 tsp. of  pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices because I didn't have all of them.  I will be making these every year.

I was looking for a recipe for Gingerbread cookies and this one works well.  I did have some problems with the first batch, but after some minor changes they were great.  Used mild molasses (not as bitter as normal), reduced salt to 1/4 tsp, and reduced giner to 1/2 tsp.  The dough needs to be chilled until firm (about 2 to 3 hours).  Do not over roll the dough (if the dough is to thin the cookies will be very fragile even after baking).

The first time I've ever made gingerbread me and I found this recipe to be marvellous!  Easy to work with after chilling the dough for about 2 hours.  Our grand kids loved it. Thanks Eileen.

This is the best recipe I have ever found! Some we rolled thick to make them chewy and some real thin tomake them like ginger snaps! I have baked gingerbreadmen for years and this is by far the best & spiciest i have tried!

The best!  Stayed soft and chewy for a week.  We frosted some with a powdered sugar frosting, but I prefered the unfrosted ones - good on their own.

These cookies are good but not my favorite. I loved the soft, chewy texture and the only down side is that they hardened when cool. they were fine after I reheated them. Maybe I baked them for too long?

Good recipe, but I think I would alter it next time.  Wow...the aftertaste from the cloves is very strong!  I think I will decrease that to 1/2 tsp next time, and increase the cinnamon. Should have trusted my instincts, but I made it as is!  The name is appropriate..they are very spicy!  I actually have an old recipe, but I decided to try this one.  I think I like my other one better!

I made these for a Holiday party and everyone loved them! I decorated them with white chocolate frosting and everyone ate them up quickly. When rolling out the dough and cutting out the shapes with cookie cutters, I recommend that you flour the counter well, otherwise it will stick to the counter and not come out the right shape.

Absolutely fabulous.  I didn't even have any ginger, so here's what I did with the spices: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I also used an extra cup of flour, and not quite the full amount of molasses.  The dough was sooooo easy to work with, and my kids had a blast decorating the finished cookies with a stiff buttercream frosting.  Even though I made all these changes I still gave the recipe 5 stars because I have a feeling it would be just as wonderful in it's original form.  I think this will become a new Christmas tradition for us.

This rolled out much better and was easier to work with then the other recipes I have tried but it wasn't spicy enough for me. Last year I made a recipe which had black pepper in it and it rocked. I think I will play around a bit with the spices so it tastes moe like that one. I got 56 thin cookies from 1 batch of this- the cookie cutters where about 3" by 2".

Yummy cookies and my dough was super easy to work with--I dip flour out of the bag with my measuring cup & shake a bit to level it off.  I know that's not the "right" way to do it, but it seems to work better for cookies.  I also always use butter--it tastes better, it's healthier, and the consistency works better in most recipes than margarine does.  Shortening won't work well with these cookies, I don't think.
***added 2012 I doubled the cinnamon & ginger, reduced the cloves by 1/4 teaspoon, and added 1/2 teaspoon allspice--very yummy and spicy now!!!  Oh, and of course I added vanilla.

These cookies taste like you bought them from a bakery!  I found them very easy to make.  I did add 2 1/2 cups of flour to make sure the dough wasn't sticky.  There was no problem rolling the dough.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I had no difficulty at all with the dough being sticky or difficult to work with, but then I always make the dough the day before and refrigerate overnight.  I liked the spice mix and didn't think that there were too many cloves at all!  I did add more cinnamon than called for, but I do that with every recipe since I like a strong taste of cinnamon.  The cokkies themselves were slightly crispy, but not dry.  Just perfect.

These are delicious! I only needed to bake them for 6 minutes instead of 8-10 that's called for. I loved them, and I frosted half of them with the buttercream frosting recipe on this site. They are def. yummy and everyone who's tried them loves them

I did like this recipe, however, I found it to be a bit salty. Next time I would use butter instead of margerine, and omit the salt altogether. The spices were lovely.  The dough rolled out beautifully, and I did not have to add any extra flour at all. I rolled the dough out onto floured wax paper, and that made them easier to transfer the the baking tray. When decorated, the touch of sweetness really completes the cookie.

Perfect, just perfect.  Excellent texture and workability if you chill dough before rolling and cutting (resist the urge to use too much flour when working the dough).  The molasses flavor and spices were just right for this fan of flavorful cookies.  Underbake slightly if, like me, you like a soft cookie.

Delicious!  Made 2 batches of these.  I ended up burning the first batch =(.  So, if you have small cookies cutters like me, you may need to bake these cookies on the middle rack in the oven, and only bake for about 7-8 minutes.  Baking them like this they turned out a little bit chewey in the center, and crisp on outside.  Yum.  Other than that, I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and only 1/2 tsp. of cloves and they tasted perfectly spicy for me.  Neighbors and friends loved them too.

This recipe was sooo delicious!  My only complaint is that I had never used molasses before, and goodness, it smelled AWFUL!  hehe, but that is nothing to do with the cookie itself, which was the perfect mix of soft and crunchy, with just the right amount of spice!  Instead of making 30 little gingerbread guys, I got a bigger cookie cutter from Wal-Mart (it's the one with a comfort grip on it in the crafts section.  This cookie cutter made about 17 gingerbread men, which I put buttercream frosting faces on, and I used Snow Caps for buttons :)  They came out so darling!  My boyfriend can't keep his hand out of the cookie jar!  Thank you so much for a delightful recipe.

Let me just add my rave--perfect texture, wonderfully spicy, not-too-sweet treasure.  My father, a 65-year-old cookie afficionado, said they were the best gingerbread men he had ever eaten.  The dough was a bit sticky, especially when transfering the cut-out cookie to the baking sheet.  I used waxed paper to roll them out, so I sprinkled the paper with a bit of flour just before cutting them out.  My five-year-old son and I had a blast making them too. I will make these every year.

Yummy!  This was my first attempt at gingerbread cookies .  They turned out wonderful for me.  The edges were slightly crispy and the center nice and soft and chewy.  I made an outline with frosting and then made eyes, buttons and a mouth.  Then turned out so cute.  I gave some to my neighbor and she called me within 5 minutes requesting the recipe and told me they were the softest and best gingerbread cookies she had ever tasted.  She said she had already eaten 3!!  And they were good sized.  Just do NOT over cook!

These weren't bad, but I found them to be rather "flour-y" tasting and a little dry.  I'll keep searching for the right recipe for us.

Love these spicy, chewy cookies! I added a teaspoon of white pepper for something extra, and followed the suggestions from DarlingDash. My cookie dough was a bit too soft and sticky to roll, so I will try by chilling over night then rolling as she suggests between 2 sheets of parchment paper. After that, I will add a bit of flour until I get it just right. UPDATE: Made again following the menu with 2 cups of flour, then I chilled it over night. When I rolled it out between sheets of parchment paper it was workable without added flour. Everyone loves the "kick" the white pepper gives these extra-spicy gingerbread men.

This recipe was delicious! The only substitution I made after reading other reviews on the spices - was to halve the amount of cloves and double the amount of cinnamon. Will definitely be turning to this recipe again for cookie cutter cookies!

Mixed & stuck in freezer for 1/2 hour. Used butter not margerine. Rolled into 1-2  inch balls and sprinkled with green Xmas sugar. Amazing. Chewy rich spice taste. Baked for suggested time. A fast easy recipe for year round use. Can't attest to how easy it is to roll but makes an outstanding drop cookie.

I MADE THIS RECIPE TWICE NOW SEVERAL YEARS APART. THE SECOND TIME I COOKED IT TODAY I HAD GONE VEGAN SO I USED BECEL VEGAN MARGARINE , AND SUBSTITUTED A HOLE BANANA FOR AN EGG YOLK  ,BECAUSE I MADE A DOUBLE BATCH (HALF BANANA  FOR 1 EGG YOLK).  AND GUESS WHAT? IT TURNED OUT PERFECT.

Like many reviewers say, this dough is sticky but with a good chill, it rolls out easily. I like the texture chilled for cutting out the cookies. The flavor is great too with some royal icing.

Love this recipe! The gingerbread tastes great---buttery, spicy, and not too sweet. The cookies are chewy and wonderful, and hold up well when making gingerbread houses too! Thank you for this recipe, I will use it over and over again!

I found the gingerbread easy to make and the cookies were awesome!    I tried rolling the dough onto a flowered surface as recommended but had trouble transferring the "men "  to the cookie sheet because the dough still wanted to stick to the flowered surface.    Instead, I rolled the dough into meatball sized rounds, rolled them in raw sugar and pressed them onto the foil lined cookie sheet and flattened them with my palm.   Then I used the cookie cutter and trimmed around the edges.    The finished product lifted easily once baked.    They were the best cookies I have ever had.

I used DarlingDash's suggestions.  Excellent cookie baked at exactly 8 minutes.  Don't worry if they look puffy while baking because they flatten out nicely when cooled.  Love them!

Recipe is perfect as is, my family and friends enjoyed them very much during the holidays. Just a note I rolled them out in sugar instead of flour. The first time I made them I rolled them in flour and they came out terrible because of it. Also I suggest cut the ginger bread nice and thick so they stay soft and chewy.

I must start out by saying that we absolutely love this recipe! My family isn't too big on Gingerbread. Some of them said they didn't even like it. This recipe change their minds! I followed the recipe except for only two small changes. I added 3 extra tablespoons of flour, per another reviewers suggestion, and added just a bit more spice except for the clothes. I let the dough sit in the refrigerator overnight. By the next day it was a nice hard dough that rolled out nicely as it warmed. I left it very thick, just under half an inch. I wound up with eight very large gingerbread men and one small Christmas tree. I baked for the suggested 8 minutes, using my Christmas tree as a guide to see if they were finished. I pulled them out and noticed that the dough was still very wet. I put them in for a total of 4 minutes more. I let them cool on the cookie sheet and they came out absolutely perfect! I think they cooked a bit longer because my daughter was still pretty cold and I left them on the thick side.They were spicy and soft as promised, and even four days later they were still just as soft as the day I made them. Christmas is now over but I still want to go make another batch of these wonderful gingerbread cookies. I highly recommend you try them.

Great recipe. I made it just as it said. Agree with other reviewers that it can be a bit sticky. I separated it into two batches and put them in the fridge for a good six hours. They still needed a lot of flour to roll out, and next time I make them, I think I will separate into three sections as another reviewer advised. Working flour into them solves the problem, but it's very easy to overdo it and then the dough eventually becomes hard to work with. Other than that, though, great recipe, good flavor, spicy but not over the top, bakes up perfectly with almost no spreading and hold their shapes really well.

Made these for Christmas last year and they were very good after doubling the spices.  Just made a new batch for Christmas 2014 and ended up throwing the entire batch out.  Made these exactly the same using all the same measurements I used last year and they rolled out perfectly, they held their shape while baking, decorated with melted white chocolate and thank God I taste tested these before putting them out...very very pasty.  I have no idea why they failed this year and were such a success last Christmas.

I like the spice after increasing the spices but feel it should be sweeter.  I would add more sugar as well.  As for the sticky issue that people are complaining about, yea it's sticky but, but refrigeration and a little flour used to roll it out fix that problem.

Pros- Flavours were great! Texture of the final cookie was very soft. 

Cons- dough was super difficult to roll and cut cookies from...I had to freeze it, add tons of flour and roll small batches between parchment paper. Most of that effort wad in vain bc the cookies blobbed out while baking.. They vaguely held their shape. Make sure to roll the dough very thin to help them keep their shape.

Perfect! This is the first time that I made 'real' gingerbread cookies and these were delicious! The kids had so much fun decorating and eating them...this is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :) NOTE: 2016- The kids and I made a great little gingerbread house using this recipe. It worked great (not sure how it would work for a larger house), and the kids loved helping to make it and eat it! :)

I added a touch more flour, I was more concerned with the cookie holding its shape for little ones to decorate than I was the texture while eating.  I used a heaping Tbsp of Epicure Selections Gingerbread Spice instead of all of the spices and the cookie tastes fantastic.  When I rolled it out, I did it in smaller sections (to punch 2 to 4 cookies at once, makes it less of a headache to roll, and ends up being more even (hard to even out a giant ball!).  keep packing the scraps back into a ball and re-rolling, I got about 20 decent sized cookies (wilton silicone grip cutter-sized).  Definitely make again, easy recipe!  I would also say its not necessary to chill, because I ended up warming it up in my hands to roll better.  Make them a little thicker than 1/4" if you want them to be sturdy enough for little hands, and I only baked for 7 minutes and even then the bottom was a touch too brown, but good nonetheless.

Perfect gingerbread recipe. I undercooked them by about 2 minutes and they were still chewy enough to hold well over the next 3 days. I will definitely be doing this recipe again in Christmas' to come!

I found the taste to be very good, although not spicy enough to give a kick - didn't need that though.  I made these exactly as written. The cookies spread and end up thin and crispy, and the cut-out shapes became blobs only a little bit similar to what they should have looked like.  Could be the atmosphere, the gas oven, or me.

Great. Everybody liked them. I am going to use real nutmeg next time and half as much clove since it can be overpowering for my taste.

Follow the recipe, it is perfect.
Make sure your chill the dough.
It is an essential step.
Don't over work the dough.
After a few rollouts just make hand 
shaped round cookies with the leftovers.
Best eaten warm but they freeze well once cooked.

I have never been a fan of gingerbread cookies, until a friend shared her cookies from this recipe with me!  The flavor was not overly powerful, yet lended just the right mount of spice.  I'll definitely be making these again next Christmas.  Thanks!

Wow! Loved this recipe! The first gingerbread I've made that came out soft and delicious! They're usually crunchy. I accidentally put in the whole egg instead of just the yolk, and it was fine. And yes, this is a rolled cookie so you need to work in small batches, flour your work surface, your rolling pin, and your dough ball. Practice makes perfect!

These are the BEST gingerbread cookies I've had.  Some of my kids don't like gingerbread and loved these.  I think it's important to use fresh spices. Sometimes when we use last year's spices they get dull and have less flavor. so buy new bottles and enjoy! 
We made these thick and they were soft and appeared "not done" when removed from the oven, but they are like a roast, let 'em sit on the sheet out of the oven for a few minutes and they're perfect!!!

These are very good gingerbread people.  I did use butter instead of margarine. I decreased the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon. I made some crisp and some soft.  They were so cute after I decorated them.  Will make again for sure,

To make them gluten free, substituted Gluten Free Bisquick for the flour.  They were really excellent.  A little more brittle because of that change, but still great.

I followed the additions given by some of the other reviewers (3/4 cup brown sugar for the white sugar, bake for 7-8 minutes).  I (like reviewer Rex) found that the dough was crumbly once I went to roll and bake them, so I sprinkled water on the dough as I worked it up to use.  Very good flavour.  I baked them for 7 minutes and even after cooling, they have some give.  I will be adding this to my holiday repertoire.

I halved the recipe for our small family and used a whole egg and butter instead of margarine. I used blackstrap molasses and whole wheat flour and they were the best gingerbread cookies I have ever had.  They were soft, flavorful, and so much fun to make. The spices are perfect. These seemed to cook very fast, but I just took them out when they were still tender to the touch.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing! I will be making these again.  I have never seen my 2 year old eat so many of any type of cookie.

I wanted to try a gingerbread recipe this year and I chose this one after reading all the reviews till 2 in the morning!!!  I selected changes I liked and went with it. My changes were to add 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey to replace the sugar and molasses.  I cut back on the cloves and doubled the other ones.  I put it in the refridge overnight and started rolling in the morning.  I too found the dough very sticky and carefully added flour quickly so I could roll fast.  I used parchment paper and baked them for 7-8 minutes.  My daughter-in-law could not stop eating them and kept telling me they were the best!!  They came out soft and so flavorful!!!  Thank you so much everyone for your inputs which caused me to have such a wonderful "first" gingerbread cookie. Take time to read the reviews and go for it, this one will NOT dissapoint!!  Btw, it made 16 4" gingerbread men.  Don't give up on the dough, persevere and you will be rewarded!!! Use the pastry brush to get rid of powdery flour on them also.

Excellent! Followed Ingredients exactly with great results. I prefer a softrr cookie and cooked at 350 for 8 minutes. After they come out of the oven wait a couple mnutes to transfer to cooling rack so they dont break.

Excellent flavor. I rolled it into a log and froze it, thawed it, rolled the log in powdered sugar, and used unflavored dental floss to slice it into rounds. Perfect, soft, and flavorful. In an ideal world I'd have cut them into gingerbread men but I haven't got time this year -- but these are delicious even for those of us who aren't keen on cookie cutters! Thanks for sharing! P.S. I used less cloves and more cinnamon due to taste preferences. EDIT 11/2015: Made them again & didn't love the cloves really. Rather strong. Don't add more flour, just roll them in powdered sugar when you go to roll them out. Be liberal with it, it won't ruin the texture like flour will. I mean, it could, if you mixed it into the dough, but just rolling the dough on a bed of it, no. Just adds flavor. I think I will use butter in future bc margarine cookies stay too soft for me, I like crispy gingerbread cookies.

My intention was to make a gingerbread house with this recipe but it was too wet.  Had to add more flour and double spices as others mentioned (except cloves). Did make great gingerbread men with these changed.

Great recipe love the flavor these cookies have. The only difference I made was I used butter because that is what I had. You definitely need to chill the dough for an hour or a little more. I found it easy to roll out and work with. Put the dough your not using at the time back in the fridge to stay chilled.

Did not like the taste at all. Overwhelming after taste from the molasses and cloves and ginger. I didn't even find it a pleasant cookie to eat. Working with the dough, in contrast to other reviewers wasn't a problem, but then I let the dough chill for several hours.

Almost perfect recipe produces 9 classic, soft, thick cookies. Regarding ingredients, I use butter, not margarine. I measure my flour by spooning into cup, and I use a knife to level off all measuring. I bought Publix molasses which is not labeled dark or light, but it is dark.  My teens rate them a FAVE without the cloves; they still have plenty of aroma and spicey flavor. 
After chilling in fridge for 1.5 hours, the dough is still manageable. It's not too hard to roll, and not so sticky that it sticks to lightly floured cutting board, no parchment needed. For a classic, soft cookie that's just a tad over 1/4" thick, recipe produces 9 cookies with cutter size 3.5" wide at the arms and 4" from head top to bottom leg. Using a convection oven, I remove at 8 minutes, then let them cool for 5-10 minutes so they stiffen up. The next day they're still nice and soft.

The good news: these are pretty tasty.  The bad news: the dough is impossible to work with (waaaaay too sticky, even if kept well chilled), these spread, and the cooking time listed is too long.

Since others complained about their cookies turning out tough if they added flour, I didn't add any to mine.  In retrospect, I should have - I couldn't really cut shapes out of these.  Once I discovered that they spread pretty badly, I went ahead and just made rolled them by hand and flattened them into circles.  That worked well enough, but I certainly didn't get the cute shapes I was going for.

If I were to make this again, I would add another 1/2-1 c flour, but I'll try a different recipe next time.

I used 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger.  I might even go down with the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp next time.

Sticky dough. Couldn't even make a gingerbread man. Kept sticking to the cookie cutter. Followed the recipe exactly. Then added more flour to try and firm/dry it up. No matter how much flour I used the dough was still too soft and sticky. Ended up just rolling them up in little balls.

I was looking for a recipe to make cookies for a "Candy-Land" event. After seeing ALL the different reviews.. I decided to give it a try. As far as the recipe itself; the only thing I changed was I cut the cloves in 1/2 and doubled the cinnamon.  This was strictly for my taste preference as I don't like cloves as much and I love cinnamon. I wanted a "soft" cookie, so I rolled out to 1/4" and baked for 7 minutes. I only left the dough in the fridge for about 45 minutes. I used 2 pieces of parchment paper to roll it out (as recommended) and had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever!  I think this recipe is easy, accurate and tastes great!

the cookies were delicious! my only problem was keeping them in shape. One of the reviews said that they keep their shape, so they stay as you make them after baking. not exactly true. They expand dramaticly and crack, so put them at least three inches apart. Mine came out a mess, but very tasty mess. I won't be able to decorate them though. 
Dough is also not too easy to work with, it sticks alot, but I covered the working place with parchment paper and wrapped the roller in parchment paper as well. oh, the cookies are so good! not spicy

love love love, EXCEPT more sugar less cloves and just a smidge more flour, everyone else from what i can tell if putting in way too much extra, make as is then just use extra flour when shaping and knead it in. coat cookies in a very thin layer of flour and DO NOT use non stick spray, thats what makes them rise, so if you want perfect little men then ditch the pam. plus i'm not big on frosting on gingerbread so instead i like to brush melted butter on top and sprinkle with sugar. the cloves needs to be cut in half and i used brown sugar and corn syrup in place of molasses and even though i had a little extra sugar, not nearly sweet enough. aside from the cloves all the spices are perfect. all in all, good recipe

Doubled the cinnamon and halved the cloves per the other reviewers.  Easy to roll out, and just the right spice for kids.

These were INCREDIBLE!  I did cut back on the time in the oven.  Put them in for about 6.5 minutes and they were wonderful!  Great spice flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe! :)

It tastes OK, but the dough turned to absolute MUSH even after chilling overnight. The cookies expanded in the oven and didn't hold their shape. My quest for a decent gingerbread recipe continues after much frustration and wasted food!

This recipe makes good cookies but the dough is absolutely terrible to work with. I've made it twice now and both times I've had to knead A LOT of flour into it before it was much more than a fluffy paste. I wont be making these again.

I don't love gingerbread cookies generally (unless they're coated in icing), but I was looking for a good recipe to make some gingerbread boys with my toddler.  I did not add any additional flour after refrigerating the dough and these cookies turned out very dark and spicy.  They definitely don't look like your standard gingerbread cookies (my husband thought they were chocolate cookies when he first saw them.)  They definitely stay soft after cooking, and they have a nice texture.  If you like the gingerbread flavor and are looking for something spicier, than you'll probably really like this recipe.  I liked them, when they were frosted, but I really prefer less of the spiciness (and I like the caramel color of regular gingerbread cookies), so I doubt I'll make these again.

I made this recipe as described and thought they were very tasty. I used very little flour for the sticking, maybe a teason for the whole batch.  The cookies are very tender.  My only warning is that the recipe only made 1 dozen gingerbread men for me, rather than 2.5 dozen.  My gingerbread men are brobably 3-4 inches tall, so it must depend on the size of the cutter.

This is a great tasting recipe, the spice is perfect too, however even after a few hours with the dough in the fridge and adding a little more flour they don't hold their shame well, they tend to spread out, so I had to keep my cookie shapes small.

My 9 year old daughter loves to make these with me each year!! We found this recipe a few years ago and make it exact to recipe instructions. We do chill it, don't add extra flour and love the texture of the dough when we cut the cookies.  I make icing in many colors and my daughter paints each and every cookie just the way she likes!  They make lovely decorative cookies in our Christmas care packages to the family.  Truly delicious.  My daughter's favorite cookies!

Should have taken the advice from the previous raters. Needed more flour. Too sticky.

Although the cookies turned out okay, I was rather disappointed by this recipe. The dough was far too sticky after 1.5 hours of chill and I could not even cut out any shapes. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and substituted brown sugar for white sugar (3/4c) and the cookies were on the sweet side. I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.

Very good came out perfect. You do have to use a lot of flour to keep the cookie dough from sticking when rolling though, which gives the cookies a ashy appearance.

I made two changes: 1) I used just half a teaspoon of ground cloves (my husband doesn't like them much), and 2) I couldn't get molasses so I used golden syrup instead. I was a little worried that they wouldn't turn out right with golden syrup, but they were delicious! For me, the dough seemed pretty dry, but it became easier to work with once it warmed up a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe, will make again! :)

Awesome recipe!!!  I just added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpin pie spice.  Make sure cookies are 1/4" thick!  8 min was perfect!!!  I frosted cookies w/ a thin layer of homemade frosting (conf sugar, corn syrup, & milk) and it sweetened the cookies up perfectly!!!!

I made these recently and followed the recipe exactly. Definitely recommend chilling the dough over night and then rolling it out with flour in parts so it doesn't warm up. The only thing I had go wrong was that they expanded into blobs! They taste great... they just don't look so nice. I will try making it again and see if leaving out the baking powder helps (since I noticed another gingerbread recipe doesn't use any).

Excellent with no modifications. I am NOT a cook and had no problem with the recipe. The cookies disappeared so fast I never even got to frost and decorate them! I was going to try a different recipe today, but my family insists I use this one again.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe. I reminded me of the Mickey gingerbread cookies from Disney World. Yes, the dough was sticky. Anything with molasses will be sticky. However, I left it in the fridge for 24 hours and had no problems. Great chewy texture and taste. I did not change anything except the time in the fridge.

Great gingerbread.  Though it was full of the flavor of the spices, I didn't find it to be 'spicy'.  I iced these into skeletons for Halloween.  They were perfect.

I made these today with a girlfriend and they turned out wonderfully, the only thing I changed was to half the cloves (personal preference). The dough was fantastic to work with after being chilled for an hour (not in a moist climate). The cookies are firm enough for decorating, but soft enough that you don't need to snap them to break them in half.

A group of friends and I made these tonight, mostly because we thought having a cookie decorating night would be fun. I haven't been a fan of gingerbread really prior to this, but these came out SO DELICIOUS! We did add 1/2 teaspoon of allspice as well, and iced them with homemade icing :)     Some of the cookies that were cooked a few minutes longer ended up really crisp, and the ones we cooked more along the lines of 8 minutes were nice and soft, so the recipe works for either preference!

As previously mentioned by another rating, this misses a 5 star as it is not as spicy as expected.  The flavor is great and full bodied with spices but just doesn't have that spicy bite that I would expect in a so titled cookie.  I found the dough to be sticky but with a light dusting on the surface and dough it rolled out rather easily with a silicone covered pin.

Phenomenal.  We make these every year for Christmas.  We follow the recipe almost exactly -- the only tiny change we make is to omit cloves and use a full teaspoon of cinnamon.

We really loved this recipe! I tried some thicker and some thinner - the thicker ones stayed just a little soft which was nice. They held up well and were great to decorate!  I agree with some others that the recipe is not VERY spicy, as the name would suggest, but did notice that the spice flavor intensified after a couple of days.  A great recipe that I'm sure I will use in years to come!

Added and extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and these turned out perfect.  Be sure to chill for a couple hours.  Used powdered sugar rather then flour to keep the dough from sticking to the rolling pin.  These cookies were delicious.

This is the first time I have ever made gingerbread men and I will definitely do it again - though I find cutout cookies to be a lot of work, these were kind of fun and totally worth the work.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and they were perfect; I would not change a thing.  Make sure you chill your dough properly and keep it cold as you roll them out (take only a little out of the fridge at a time as you are rolling and cutting) and you will have little trouble.  I used two clean paint sticks as guides when I was rolling the dough - this little trick makes it much easier and faster to roll the dough and enables you to maintain an even thickness (pretend the paint sticks are like railroad tracks and your rolling pin rolls along them like a train, flattening the dough between the rails).  I had trouble finding a recipe for icing that didn't call for egg whites (I know I'm a wimp, but I don't like the idea of leaving eggs raw), so I just mixed confectioners sugar with 2% milk and a smidge of cream cheese and let the decorated men sit out overnight before stacking them.  I packed these little guys up and gave them as Christmas gifts and everyone loved them and raved about the flavor.  Thank you!

These were pretty good. I didn't have any cookie cutters, so instead of chilling for an hour I just shaped the dough into balls the size of walnuts, then flattened them slightly before baking. As many others have said the clove taste is a little overbearing, so next time I may only use half of what the recipe calls for.

This is my 3rd time making gingerbread and I was a little wary of it after reading all the reviews of cooks changing the recipe amounts of spices, flour and sugar. I had planned to reduce the flour and substitute the sugar for brown sugar but I was a little distracted and the only change I made was to reduce the flour by  1/4 -1/2 cup. I also used butter instead - probably a mistake. I live in a humid country and usually have a really tough time rolling out cookies - the dough becomes sticky very fast and sticks to the rolling pin and rolling surface even if i use loads of flour. This dough was very crumbly and just barely held together. after chilling overnight it became rock hard and impossible to work with. i ended up needing to wait for it to get to room temperature with abit of rubbing before i could roll it out. Rolling was relatively easy and cookies crumbled abit at cutting. My molasses were SOLID at first so the cookie colour was nicely marbled, unintentionally! The gingerbread rose by about 25% during baking and turned out crispy just out of the oven but the centre softened up after about 1/2 hour of cooling. The cookies tasted sweet enough without any icing or decor. I felt it was a little salty though. odd. and not very very spicy but enough to tell it was gingerbread without chasing kids away. Next time I make these i'd probably leave out the salt or use unsalted butter/ margarine, leave out 1/2 cup of flour and keep the sweeteners the same. Good Luck!

i rolled these out too thinly because i thought i wasn't gonna have enough dough. they came out crispy but still good. next time i won't make them this thin. rolled out between two pieces of plastic wrap because i didn't have any wax paper - worked just as well.

Excellent cookie and very easy. After making them once, decided they weren't as spicy as I'd like so I doubled the cinnamon and ginger.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of fresh ground black pepper for an extra kick.  Very good

This was delicious.  I doubled the spices for more kick and used royal icing on them, next time I won't put too much icing as it sort of dulled the cookie.  The first batch was eaten up in a day!

These were perfect on the first try!  The amount of dough was good for two pans, although we could only fit eight on each pan. So 16 cookies... they won't last long...

Eh... I'll have to try this one again.  Giving this one 4 stars because its obvious people really like it.  It was SO sticky though!!!  I had to add a ton more flour so I could even roll it!  Great flavor, though... its obvious that gingerbread cookies are an art... leave them in too long and they will get hard, not long enough and they will be too soft.

In moving, I lost the gingerbread man recipe I had used for 30 years, so I tried this -- and liked it better than my old stand-by. After reading some reviews, I did lower the baking temp to 325 and still watched the cookies carefully. Most batches were done in 8 minutes. A holiday keeper!!

Great flavor and we all love that they're soft!  The dough was pretty sticky, even after chilling it for a while.  Since I didn't want to add more flour (and potentially make them hard and dense), I rolled them out between layers of plastic wrap and peeled the shapes off the plastic.  It was a little more labor-intensive than just using my countertop, but they came out just perfect!  I left out the cloves (my son is allergic to them) and they still taste very nice.  My husband's not big on spicy foods, gingerbread included, but he really liked these (especially once they were iced).  I made two batches to get 42 cookies of various Christmas shapes (we liked the trees best since they're fun to decorate).  They did spread a bit on the tray while baking, but that was all to the good since my shapes still got a bit mangled pulling them off the plastic wrap and the spreading smoothed out all the edges.  This will definitely be my holiday gingerbread recipe from now on!

I wish I could give this recipe more stars... it was a breeze to make, so easy to work with and I'm eagerly awaiting a finished product. I'm not concerned though! This is going to be my go to gingerbread recipe every year! It's very spicy, traditional gingerbread. The only thing that would have made this recipe better is a recommendation or recipe for decorators icing. Thanks so much!!!

Yum! I made four different types of cookies today and these are my favorite. I'm vegan so I used dairy-free margarine and subbed for the egg yolk, and on reviewers' recommendations used 3/4 tsp cloves rather than 1 tsp, and the cookies turned out awesome. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks!

The flavor was okay, but definitely not "spicy" which was a disappointment.  They also puffed up so much that we lost the detail in our cookie cutters. I was surprised after all the great reviews. Did we do something wrong?

This is the first time I've ever made gingerbread. I doubled the recipe (except that I tripled the baking powder and kept the baking soda the same). They turned out good, although they did spread a little more than I expected. My husband took them to work, and they were well received. People told him that they were the best gingerbread cookies they had ever had, and they said I should just open my own bakery. :)

Crispy, spicy, warm, and make your home smell like the holidays. Perfect. First time I have made gingerbread from scratch, and will continue to use this recipe. Made one recipe exactly as stated and perfect for gingerbread men. Made another batch a bit healthier for our home - substituted splenda, 1 cup whole wheat flour (other cup all purpose white) and still was great texture and flavor... and I accidently got pumpkin pie spice for this batch and still yummy. Good quality spices do make a difference. Thanks everyone for sharing!

These are wonderful, EXCEPT you really need to use either a GREASED baking sheet (my first batch stuck because the recipe said ungreased sheet; big mistake!!) or, preferably, parchment or wax paper on top of baking sheet for easy off and cleanup.  Maybe experienced bakers already do this, but I have very little baking experience and had to learn this bit by trial and error.  Also, it helps if you dust the board with powdered sugar or flour before putting dough on there, and spraying a wax paper sheet with oil, then putting it on top to roll dough flat for no stick. I'd also recommend dipping the cookie cutter edges each time in flour or powder sugar to make the dough come out of the mold easier.

These were great!  I made just as the recipe says and think they turned out really well.  I think the spice blend was perfect and the texture was too.  I did have to use what I thought was quite a bit of flour to roll out but then again, I was in a hurry to eat them so the dough probably could have chilled a little longer.  Didn't seem to make a difference in the final product.  They stayed just a little chewy and rose just a tiny bit while baking.  This recipe's a keeper!  :)

perfect for ornaments. I cooked for 9 min. and they became perfectly hard.  Just make sure to poke a hole in it before you bake!! :)  As far as taste, I give them a 4 star. Classic ginger bread, but a bit too bitter? maybe. Too strong for me, Not my favorite gingerbread taste.  But recipe is as it says it is!

This is more of a 3.5 star for me.  I made the recipe as written and I had alot of trouble with the consistency of the dough.  After a whole night in the fridge the dough didn't firm up and the next day I had to add alot more flour than called for, as others have said, to get it into a workable dough.  I did cut back on the cloves a touch.  They are tasty but not really for us.  Will stick to my original recipe from now on.

With the exception of blackstrap molasses (which I used), I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree that the amount of cloves should be cut in half.  Other than that, I really enjoyed these cookies.  I did let the dough refrigerate longer than called for.  If you do the same, make sure the dough comes to room temperature before baking.  Also, let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet a few minutes before removing.  I was a bit too excited to try them and the first few cookies tore while removing them from the cookie sheet.

Very good!  If you don't bake them too long they turn out nice and soft :)  They do have a strong molasses flavor though.  I would prefer a milder flavor with more ginger bite.

Wow, these were fantastic! I followed the directions and didn't make any changes.  The clove tasted a little strong in the unbaked dough, but once it was baked it was just fine.  These only needed 6 minutes in the oven for me, which was great because I wanted cookies quickly!

These had excellent flavor, but mine didn't come out chewy.  Read all the reviews, I guess next time I make them I'll make them a lot thicker!  Everyone loved them last year at Christmas though!

Great Recipe. I had to make a failsafe cookie, so I choose this one! A Smash!  Notes: //--If you find them too spicy, omit  or half again the cloves. // --adding a bit of Vanilla extract or bean (tried both!) is a great way for a vanilla-gingerbread kick. In both cases, I omitted the cloves completely to make way for the vanilla. Adding it will not hurt the recipe. //--if you have trouble with the dough being too sticky, try lightly dusting both sides of the dough, rolling it until it does not spread, scape it off the surface, dust again, then keep rolling.  The dough is just soft enough to use flour to roll, but not enough to dry out the cookie. It is a trick to keep it moist. It can be a pain, but you just have to get the experience rolling it out.   Thank you Steph for this recipe!

Delicious! I used the whole egg and ended up adding an extra 1/3-1/2 cup flour because the dough was too sticky.  Worked out fine.  I separated the dough in half to chill and rolled the sections out separately.  Rolled them in powdered sugar instead of flour.  Baked on parchment paper...8 minutes.  Wonderful spicy flavor and smell....stayed soft and fresh for several days.  Will definitely make again!

A fantastic recipe!  It was my first attempt at gingerbread men and they came out exactly how I wanted them to. My cookie cutters were just under 3 inches and the gingerbread men were perfect after 8 minutes of baking. I did find that my dough was too dry and crumbly to come together into a ball until I added the rest of the egg (white) into the mix... maybe it's because the egg I used was a bit small.  Once the egg white was in, it came together nicely. As recommended by other reviewers, I rolled in between 2 pieces of parchment paper and had no need to add any extra flour. I achieved a thickness of just over 1/4 inches by placing a pair of chopsticks on either side of the dough while rolling and that worked a treat.  I had intended on decorating the cookies, but my 3 year old was already munching on them happily while I was rolling the last of the dough.

These cookies went over big at the cookie swap. I added a bit more cinnamon than it called for, and I rolled in a little more flour to make the dough easier to work with. They are the perfect Christmas Cookie.

Very good. Just don't let the dough sit in the refrigerator for too long (over a week and a half) or it will become a crumbly mess.

I made several batches of this recipe for the holidays. A little extra flour helped the cookies hold their shape baking, but the dough was easy to roll and had great flavor. I thought it might be fun to have a little heat, so I added 1/8 teaspoon cayenne to the recipe. The cookies were perfect for the first few days, but became hotter as time passed. The cayenne was a good idea, but I'd go easier next time.

This was my first time ever making gingerbread cookies. I am a big fan of gingersnaps so i gave these a try. WOW was I impressed! These were very easy to bake and made my house smell lovely when there were baking in the oven. Mine cameout with a bit of a crunch on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside. JUST the way my grandmother made them. Will make again for sure!

STICKY STICKY UNRULY DOUGH!  But the flavor is great, even after adding AT LEAST 1 more cup of flour just to make the dough workable.  And yes, I did chill it before trying to roll out...but the dough was INCREDIBLY STICKY!  Probably won't make this again since it was such a hassle.

This was my first attempt at gingerbread men, these cookies were great.  At first I had a real hard time working with the dough, tried rolling it in parchment and wax paper, but that actually seemed to be harder for me.  As soon as I used a lot of flour on my rolling out surface I had no trouble at all working with the dough.  All the flour did not affect the taste of the cookies at all!  Absolutely delicious!

I've tried many gingerbread men recipes and this one is by far the best.  I highly recommend refrigerating overnight and using a lot of flour to roll them out, they stick to your surface easily.  If you are looking for a little bit of spice in your cookies this is the recipe for you.

These were just alright. The dough was a bit sticky so I had to add a lot of flour for dusting to roll it out. I might try to make a few adjustments in the ingredients if I make them again.

Great recipe! My cookies baked great and had a mild taste. I did cut the ginger down to 1 1/2 tsp. (I made these for my son's class and didn't want them to be too spicy). Also, I cut them a little more than 1/4 inch thick. We like thick, soft gingerbread. They were wonderful. Thanks Eileen for the recipe!

My housemate made these and added about a 1/4 cup whole wheat flour (so the cut outs wouldn't spread and lose their shape) and added a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. The result was the best gingerbread I've ever had! The cayenne is a MUST!!!! It adds just the right amount of bite. Great dipped in dark chocolate, too!

These were really good, only change I made 1/2 tsp of cloves and I was out of nutmeg.  I love gingerbread cookies, these came out soft on the inside and a little crisp on the outside.  Loved them!!

it has been a long time since i rated a recipe 5 stars, and this deserves every one. i even realized too late i had run out of baking powder and just added a bit more baking soda. the day before i made these, i had tried a recipe from the food network. those cookies were AWFUL. and i had promised my 6-year-old gingerbread men. thank goodness for this recipe! these are absolutely perfect. i will make them again soon, since i know we're about to run out already ... thank you for this great recipe!

These were tasty and perfect for decorating. I left out the cloves since I didn't have any, but it was still great.  I cooked them for the whole 10 minutes so they would be firm for my 2 year old to decorate.  Not one broke!
This is our new Christmas tradition.

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made were: I used 3/4 cup of light brown sugar, instead of the 1/2 cup sugar, called for.  For the cloves, I only used 1/2 teaspoon.

If you are going to use a 3" gingerbread man cutter, like I did, there is no way to get 30 cookies out of this recipe.  Keep in mind, 30 cookies could easily be possible, if you used much smaller cutters.

I also iced my gingerbread men with Royal Icing II.  A recipe I got on this website.  That was just the icing on the.....gingerbread man!!  LOL!

This recipe is wonderful and the cookies have ZING!  They are delicious and I highly recommend trying this recipe.  

There is nothing quite as wonderful as sitting down with a gingerbread man cookie and an ice cold glass of milk!  YUM!!!!!  LOL!    :-)

These had a lovely ginger flavor, they are spicy but not too spicy. These were like a soft gingersnap. I only rolled mine out to 1/2 thickness so I only got 12 from this, but I also messed up and used real butter (it's all I had besides lard or cooking oil) and didn't know they would spread so much. Well now I know you can't use real butter for cut outs. My bad, as the recipe clearly states margarine. Oh well, I've learned another new cooking lesson, they still tasted good, but because they are thicker they are tender, moist, and soft in the middle and not crispy so I'll probably keep these as is, un-iced (the 11 that are left, since I had to taste one to review it) and make a new batch following directions as far as both ingredients and rolling out thin enough to make some for cookie trays. The taste is great, just I messed up.

These cookies are great! I had a bit of a tragedy, my measuring cup broke when I was getting the flour out and the recipe said  1 cup of sifted flour so i didnt know how to measure it!! so i measured out 32 tablespoons (im a little obsesive) I like measuring by tablespoons because its more acurate. just measure it out and level with knife. I then sifted it into my dry ingredients and mixed them. for the spices i used 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cloves and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
also , they dont sell molasses in chile so I used something called "chancaca" here disolved in water (250 grams and 1 1/2 cups water), im giving you the measurments just in case there is a chilean out there that is having trouble with the ingredients. You use 1/2 cup just like molasses and save the rest in the fridge. i baked them 6 1/2 min and the result were pretty soft cookies. with the perfect amount of spices! oh and as i was afraid that chancaca doesnt have the same amount of molasses that molasses does i used half dark brown half light brown sugar. sorry im a little complicated but ill tell you i have learned alot this year not doing anything but baking! LOL
*I tasted these again and I found a little bit of a salty aftertaste, they are great but next time i will add only 1/4 teaspoon salt. also, take the dough out of the fridge a little bit at a time, i would not add flour to the recipe as you will use a bit to roll them out. make them thick 1/4 inch and they will come out

I kept them soft, and they do smell wonderful. I'm not sure if I used the right molasses, since the store I went to only carried one kind (it wasn't labeled blackstrap, but then again, it only said "molasses"). The cookies are cute & smell good, and I will have to get an opinion on taste from someone with a more discerning gingerbread tongue, since gingerbread isn't my personal favorite.

This was a top notch recipe.  Sure, it took two hours in the freezer until it was stiff enough for me to handle it, but it was worth all the fuss!  I made exactly as written except I decreased the amount of cloves by half; I was worried of there being too much of a clovey aftertaste, like some reviewers said.  I whipped everything up in my stand mixer and then moved the entire bowl to the fridge for an hour: do NOT even bother trying this; the dough was too soft and sticky to even get one of my cutouts to successfully move from counter to baking sheet.  After some quality time in the freezer, everything worked smoothly.  The dough turned sticky after a few minutes of handling, but I worked quickly and had to add very little four.  Mine cooked for exactly eight minutes and was crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  The taste is incredible; very authentic, not too sweet, and with just the right amount of spice.  I decorated them once completely cooled with royal icing (one whipped egg white, 1 cup of confectioners sugar, 1/4 tsp of vanilla).  I'm making this again for the holiday party!

Great taste!! I recommend rolling them out thicker and making sure the outer edges remain thicker as they can get crisy. I also think that 8 minutes makes a perfect cookie that is soft and firm. Over all, great recipe.

Our family did not like these AT ALL.  Taste-wise, they were too strong and spicy and unpleasant.  Not festive or suitable for a crowd. They were too hard to make, no matter how long I stored in the fridge, and I couldn't transfer to sheet after rolling out. Dough too soft and gooey. We ended up making drops and flattening to circles.  The baked all right, but we didn't like the texture or flavor - warm or cooled - and threw them out.  I'll go back to grandma's gingerbread cookie recipe.

I'd give this a 5 on taste, but a 1 on ease. I found the dough EXTREMELY difficult to work with. I chilled for about 3 hours and put in freezer for about 30 minutes. It was a crumbly mess! (And I have plenty of experience with cookie dough.) I could pretty much only roll out enough dough to do one cookie at a time. BUT, they did taste wonderful. I baked them for 7 minutes and halved the amount of ginger and cloves. Not sure I'd try again just because of the hassle.

Very simple! I premeasured the ingredients and let my friends two year old help mix and cut the cookies. I used butter instead of margarine and 3/4 tsp allspice in place of cloves since I have none. If you're using intricate cookie cutters I recommend refrigerating overnight and working with small batches of dough while the rest remains refrigerated. It's also best to cut as close together as possible since the more time you role the dough out the tougher it gets. 

Mine started to get "well-done" around seven minutes so next time I'll cook them only for 6-6 1/2 minutes or make them thicker for a chewier cookie.

No need to look further for a recipe. This one is perfect. Excellent gingerbread. I chilled the dough overnight and it was very easy to work with. I'll be making this every holiday season from now on!

Perfect recipe.  The only thing I changed was to lessen the cloves a bit just because of my tastes.  I didn't have any trouble with the dough being too mushy after an hour in the fridge or anything like that. I halved the recipe with no problems. (I beat the egg yolk and only used about half.)  These will now be my one and only gingerbread person recipe!

These turned out great for me.  I followed the recipe exactly but will use 1/2 wholewheat flour next time.  I thought they were really spicy and will not include as much cloves next time.  They shaped well and didn't crumble for me and after decorating the gingerbread men, they didn't last long enough to see Christmas.  I'll definitely save this recipe and make them again.

The cookies seemed to turn out ok, but that's it.  For the effort I have had way better gingerbread cookies.

This recipe was fabulous!  Lots of taste and the smell was glorius.  My mother-in-law, who has always used her mother's recipe.....asked to have this as the grandkid's were raving about my cookies. How cool is that? This will definitely become one of our traditions.

WOW! pleasantly surprised! I cooked the first batch for 8 minutes and they seem soft, so next batch I will try 10 minutes and see what happens. But the taste is superb! First time I made them and the dough is perfect. You just need very little flour and I mean very little! I used a frosting from this site as well, which turned out good! Thanks for the recipe.

The best gingerbread men recipe I've found.  They get better with age so save some for several days to try later with hot coffee or cold milk.

This is the 2nd year I've made these ... I don't like hard cookies ... these are amzingly moist, stay moist, and have a really great taste. My husband and teenage kids always have a very positive response after the first bite! They never last till after Christmas, and I decorate with melted white chocolate in piping.  Thanks, Eileen!! This will be a trandition in our home for years to come!

This recipe was okay. I think I might even roll them a bit thicker next time. I didn't find the cookies to be very favourful. It just tasted like something important was missing. The colour and texture was nice. And they did not taste bad. The dough was really easy to work with. I think this would be a great cookie to make with your children. They will realy be able to easily work the dough.

The flavor was excellent.  I had to roll out the dough on parchment paper and transfer to cookie sheet to keep them from coming apart.  It sure was easier when you have little helpers and not as frustrating to adults or the helpers!!!! I had to make some substitutions due to an allergy to egg and dairy. (Used powdered egg substitute for the egg) That may have been the problem.  The cookies baked up perfectly and were a chewy, wonderful delight to my little son.

Great recipe!  Only modification I made was to use 1/4 c light corn syrup and 1/4 molasses.  I refridgerated my dough overnight and had absolutely no problems in rolling it out.  Just be sure to flour the surface and rolling pin with lots of flour.  Great recipe- these are now a part of my holiday baking!

So delicious and so spicy! EVERYONE loves these! The electrician who was over our house probably ate a dozen of them by himself while installing our stove, haha. He told my dad they were really good and asked where we bought them. ;)

These are so good! Added 1/4 cup more flour, tossed in some diced crystalized ginger and rolled the dough into little balls. I then flattened them out a little bit in some raw sugar, and baked for 7-8 minutes. They were delicious. Thanks again for the recipe!

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have EVER used.  They are spicy! But I love a good spicy gingerbread cookie.  I ended up using only a 1/2 tsp of cloves because 1 tsp seemed a bit much.  I let it chill for about a hour and a half and they were a little sticky, but I just used extra flour and they turned out fine.  They came out PERFECT. I will DEFINETELY be using this recipe again!!

Love them!  The dough was sticky so I had to add quite a bit of flour, once I got the right consistency they were very easy to make.  I left out the nutmeg and they were perfect.  My boyfriend loved them!

These were incredibly delicious, very simple cookies. I was dubious as to the amount of dough it made, but it really does make more than it looks like it will. I rolled these out fairly thin and only had to cook them for about 5 minutes. Also, I didn't have cloves or regular ground ginger, so I used allspice and some Dynasty Sugar Ginger, minced. It turned out great. I will be making these every year!

Yum!  I made about 40 cookies with this recipe, but I think mine were on the thin side.  I cooked them at the recommended temp (350F) for about 5-6 minutes.  I will definitely be making these again before Christmas!  
I used "Royal Icing I" to frost them which turned out beautifully!

I had to make an extra 2 dozen because my hubby and daughter kept eating them!  The dough rolled very well as long as it was chilled and the cookies (that didn't get snarfled down!) kept well.

Yummy, yummy... soft, chewy, spicy & delicious. These are officially one of my favorite cookies. I accidentally spilled some water into the dough (don't ask!) while mixing and subsequently had to add a TON of flour when I rolled it out, but they still came out great. Next time I'm sure they will be perfect as long as I pay attention to what I'm doing.

The finished product is quite tasty.  However, the dough was really tough to work with.  While the recipe instructs to refrigerate at least 1/2 hour, I refrigerated my dough for over an hour.  The first two cut out cookies came out well, but then the dough kept melting & sticking to the wax paper.  It was quite messy & frustrating.  I managed to put the dough back into the bowl & refrigerate overnight.  The next morning, it still kept sticking to the wax paper.  I found that by putting it into the freezer for an hour and it was easier to manage.  I ended up making another batch and the freezing helped.  I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and they were definately yummy.  I will make another attempt to make these again.

Excellent! I made these for my cookie trays this year, and everyone raved!  I chilled my dough for about two days -- which helped a lot.  I actually ran out of white flour, so I subbed in wheat, and they came out awesome.  Will def. make next year!

I'll begin with the finished product... yumminess incarnate! These cookies turned out very well! I made two batches.. one, just the way the recipe calls for (except I subbed butter for margarine!!) and the other, I used brown instead of white sugar, decreased the cloves and incresed the cinnamon per the suggestions of other reviewers. I have to say, I MUCH prefer using the full amount of spice. The cookie is just so much more flavorful that way! I did like the little bit of extra chewiness the brown sugar gave, so I might stick with that. The dough was pretty sticky and a little tricky to work with, but I chilled it overnight and didn't have too many problems. Will definitely make again!

We just made these for girls holday night in... and they came out fantastic!  Incredibly simple, and very tasty.  The texture was perfect - not too crispy, not too doughy.  Kudos.

These turned out great!  They're soft and delicious.  I was a little worried about the spices being too strong, but I followed the recipe exactly and used unsulfered molasses, and the spices were perfect.  I was just going to make these for the kids in my family but I have a feeling everyone will be enjoying them.  I got about 36 cookies out of one batch.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I didn't have ginger, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and got some of the best gingerbread cookies I've ever had. I received compliments from everyone that tried them. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! I'll be using it every year.

It was difficult to find margarine here, so I had to use butter.  I had to add extra flour, probably I added a whole extra cup by the end, and rolled it out under some plastic wrap since they don't have parchement paper here.  I got tired of cutting and frosting gingerbread men, so after awhile I just cut squares with a pizza cutter and frosted them with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sugar-cookie-frosting/detail.aspx.  They are SO GOOD with this frosting.  They stayed moist too!  I gave them as gifts and though most people here objected to the idea of something with ginger being sweet, the spices won them over.  A new favorite in Japan!

I always bake my cookies with real butter, so I substituted the margarine with butter.  It was so difficult to roll.  I kept putting the dough into the freezer (in wrapped plastic) and rolled between two sheets of plastic wrap.  What a mess.  It may be because I switched to butter and/or made it at my mom's house in Hawaii where it is humid (not your fault.)  Cookie was tasty but a tiny bit spicy for me.

I really love this recipe! Thanks Eileen:)Great old-fashioned gingerbread taste with real flavor! This was my very first attempt at making cookies from scratch, other than simple drop type. The dough was pretty easy to roll out, and they end result was beautiful. However, I did have to let the dough sit in the fridge for more like twelve hours until consistency seemed to work for me.

I love this recipe!! I have made at least 5 times, and the cookies always turn out soft and spicy. Even people who don't like gingerbread like these. I ice them with royal icing and put on red hot buttons. It really complments the taste.

The cookies turned out nice but the dough was so difficult to handle, even after chilling it. I added 2/3 cup extra flour to it before even trying to roll it out and it was still too sticky and kept falling apart. In the end I probably used almost 1 and 1/2 extra cups of flour to get this dough to a stage where it would roll out and where I could transfer the cookies to the baking sheet without them falling apart. If I make them again, I'll probably use a little more cinnamon and ginger.

These were easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I also only got about 16 (large) cookies from this recipe - which was fine.  As the title states - it is a spicy cookie.  Great for me, a little too spicy for my kiddo.    Overall, great cookie and will be making again.

Very easy, (I'm a novice, this recipe was my very first try at baking roll-out cookies), and the cookies came out spicy and hard, just as gingerbread should. (I might even add more ground cloves the next time I make them.)

Yummy, yummy, yummy.

My daughter loved these. One reviewer below said 3/4 cup molasses is a must. I followed her suggestion and found it too sweet for my taste. I think it depends on the brand you use or perhaps on the level of sweetness you are used to. So experiment.

I've never been a big fan of gingerbread cookies myself, but we made them for my son for the novelty because we're reading 'the gingerbread boy' for a bedtime story. He loved them, and I quite enjoyed them for what they are, since I've tasted many in the past. I know what they're suppose to taste like and these were great versions of them. Additionally, I thought they tasted even better the following day as the flavors mellowed about in the cookie.

These were awesome. Easy recipe to follow, easy to roll out, and the cookies held their shape well. Best of all, these cookes stay chewy, no matter how long you keep them! I have some leftover from Christmas, and they're still chewy and delicious. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I didn't make any changes and the dough was very easy to work with after chilling.  I made these over the holidays and received many compliments (even from people who don't normally like gingerbread).  I baked them for about 6 minutes in order to get a chewy cookie and I was not disappointed.  The cookies still tasted fresh days later - a definite keeper!

We just finished making these cookies.  I made the dough the day before and they were still a bit too sticky, so I kneaded in alot of extra flour.  I also didn't have any cloves, so I increased the cinnamon and nutmeg by 1-2 tsp each and added a tsp of pepper.  They turned out nice and spicy, but still sweet enough to eat even without the frosting.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

These cookies were easy to make and rolled out beautifully.  I did not use the cloves since my kids don't like the taste.  I didn't get very many cookies out of this batch since I used medium to large size cutters.

The recipe says not to use blackstrap but that was all I had on hand. They turned out very moist and dark and very good! Wonder why it's says NOT to use blackstrap?

I had to make a second batch because my 3 and 5yr old boys dove into the first batch! i cut back on the cloves, made them thick and baked for only 8 minutes. Too yummy to save for only x-mas time!

I used butter instead of margarine.  The dough has chilled an hour and it's veryyyyy soft.  Has anyone else used butter? And could this be the reason the dough is so soft? I think I may need to let this chill over nite.  The dough flavor is INSANELY yummy.  I can't wait to taste these cooked!

These are great gingerbread men! I cut back a little on all the spices as my 2-year old will be eating them (and she seems to have my husband's cinnamon allergy), but they still turned out great. I also cut back on the flour a little, only using 1 3/4 cups, after reading previous reviews.. That was a mistake. The dough needed the extra 1/4 cup. But it still worked out fine, I just sprinkled on a little more flour when rolling out. One batch turned out 18 cookies for us, but we were using fairly large cookie cutters. I made a simple thick icing out of icing sugar and milk (plus different colors of food coloring!) and doodled. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe.  For those in the UK or Aus. use tracle not molasses and increase the flour to 21/2 - 3 cups flour.

I'm not sure what happened, but my dough was quite stiff and unrollable...however, I am giving it 4 stars because the cookies I ended up making with it tasted great! Even my youngest daughter, who is NOT normally a fan of ginger snaps or gingerbread cookies said, "Mom, can you make these cookies again?" What I ended up doing with my unrollable dough was form them into balls (like peanut butter cookies), put them on the cookie sheet, and flatted them with my palm, then baked them. They took somewhat longer than the time in the recipe (approximately 15-18 min), but they came out crispy on the outer edges and moist on the inside. So I will make this again and it won't matter if the dough is unrollable!!!

Sorghum molasses works wonderfully in this recipe! It gives a light color and unique taste.  {Allrecipes staff told me that recipes which stated they had not yet been yet tried, would have the rating deleted.  I guess we'll see, won't we?}.

This is so good I am sending the recipe to my sister in Indiana tonight. The dough is sticky even after chilling in the fridge all day, but I just rolled the dough out between parchment paper and then cooked the cookies on the parchment paper on my cookie sheet for perfect ginger bread men. This was the first time I have ever made ginger bread cookies and I will make this a tradition for years to come. Thank you for such a good recipe. Merry Christmas all.

I agree with the comment that the recipe should read "3 cups flour", not 2.  After making the first round, the dough was extremely sticky and unworkable - even with 2 hours in the fridge, 30 minutes in the freezer and a floured SILPAT!

Once I added that extra cup of flour (and losing some of that stickiness, trying to make it work), they turned out GREAT.

I'm trying another batch tonight with 3 cups of flour instead of 2.  After making the dough in my mixer, I can tell this is the perfect solution.

Way, WAY too many cloves and after almost 2 hours of chilling, still required a ton of flour to roll out onto parchment.  Not sweet or spicy enough for my tastes.  I suggest adding more sugar and some black pepper to give this one some kick!

Fantastic!!! my son adores gingerbread, best recipe we ever made. Really liked the added spices. I substitute brown sugar for the white and 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice for all the individual spices. My 2 inch cutter makes 36 gingerbread babies, 10 minutes is perfect on silpat lined sheets in my oven. I also use half whole wheat flour with great results.

I doubled the recipe, like many other reviewers, and added 1/2 cup natural applesauce instead of the second stick of margarine.  I also forgot to add the extra yolk, and added about 1 cup more of flour to make it workable.  It was still sticky, but workable, after one hour in the fridge.  And I kept re-rolling the dough, incorporating more and more flour.  Wish I had read the reviews about cutting the cloves in half.  Oh well, these cookies were STILL really good.  With some adjustments (like adding the extra yolk, and lessening the cloves), it would be *****.

I've made these two Christmases in a row now - they get rave reviews as the softest, tastiest gingerbread men ever each time.  I always make some vanilla icing to top them with - a little hint of added sweetness really contrasts with the deep spiciness of these and sets them off.  They're excellent, melt-in-your-mouth cookies.

I made these twice. My first batch was darker in color and a lot less sticky. It baked well and held its shape - tasty :) My second batch, however, was lighter in color and waaay too sticky. It spread like mad when baking, though the taste was the same. I'm sure I didn't leave out any ingredients - the only thing that was different was that I used a different brand of molasses. I'm not sure if that could have been it, but either way, these are delicious cookies, shaped or misshaped ;)

These turned out great. I think the dough is supposed to be sticky, that's why you refrigerate it. If you follow this recipe exactly and roll them out to a quarter inch, the consistency turns out perfect. My only gripe is that to make a decent amount of the big gingerbread men, you need to double the recipe. This made 6 big cookies and another tray of little ones.

This was the best recipe I have ever came across.  I've tried other recipes and always found the cookies to come out dry and hard.  The whole family couldn't get enough.  They were a bit gooey to work with, but I just added more flour.  I will use this recipe from now on.

Very good - easy to work with.  My kids loved them - they were trying to eat them before I even had them decorated.  I will definitely make these again.  I cut cloves down to 1/2 tsp. as recommended and they were fine.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've never made gingerbread cookies before and I was in the mood to this morning.  After getting most things out, discovered I didn't have very much cinnamon, no ginger, or cloves.  I improvised and used equal amount of Chinese 5 spice powder.  These cookies are AWESOME!  The dough didn't even get funky after rolling/rerolling.  I'm hooked!

EXCELLENT!  I have never made gingerbread before so that is saying something!  Here are my few changes.  I used butter instead of margarine and skipped the cloves (instead added a little extra cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice).  I also doubled the recipe - only made about 4 dozen cookies and they were not huge so I am glad I doubled the batch.  I found for a 1/4" cookie, 7 minutes in the oven was plenty for a chewy cookie, any longer and they tasted too crunchy.  (But the flavor is still perfect).  Also, had to use a lot of flour when rolling the dough, on the counter and the rolling pin b/c it was so sticky.  Overall, I WILL make this recipe again - delicious gingerbread cookies!!

This recipe is awesome.  I made the really big gingerbread men and cut the recipe in half.  Only made 6 gingerbread this way. I used Betty Crocker's new microwavable white chocolate for the features.  That turned out great.  Update... I doubled the recipe and it did not turn out. Way too spicey.  Also, I left batter in refrig over night.

I've never made gingerbread before, but this was easy and wonderful!  It was a real hit with my son's playgroup!  I'll definitely make this again!

I may have done something wrong, I used Grandma's original molasses, and I doubled check to make sure that I put everything in. I let my dough chill longer than an hour and even added extra flour, but the dough was so sticky that it was impossible to work with. Any advice would be appreciated!

These definitely lived up to their name...a cookie with a lot of punch!  Frosted them with cream cheese frosting, delicious!  My only complaint is that they got extremely soft...to the point that they were falling apart as we were eatting them!  Still, delicious!

Mum always used to give me Gingerbread Men as treat when I was little. Now I'm doing the same for my boy's. This is the best recipe for Gingerbread Men that I've ever found. I gave some to Mum yesterday and she liked it so much that she asked for the recipe! My boy's & husband love it too. I made a batch two days ago and it's already gone- Thanks for the memory.

I came across this recipe years ago in a book, and have been using it ever since.  Though I have tried other recipes for variety's sake, this is absolutely the BEST gingerbread recipe I have ever tried!

This recipe is outstanding!  I had such a craving for gingerbread and this just hit the spot.  The cookies are perfectly spiced and came out soft and chewy.  The dough was extremely easy to work with, even after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Two thumbs up!

I made these ahead of time for Christmas when my grandson would visit. They never made it into the freezer. I made another batch, ... same thing. We managed to save 5 cookies. So that would be a yes, they’re good.

I made these for the holidays this year and they SMELLED SO AMAZING when I was mixing the dough. But after refrigerating it, the dough was gooey and soft, not at all the consistency I needed to roll and cut them out! I ended up adding lots of flour into the dough. I think that this happened because I spooned the flour into the measuring cup, like you’re supposed to, but the person who wrote this recipe just scooped it right from the bag. Also- THESE COOKIES SPREAD OUT A LOT. Two inches apart is not an exaggeration. I cut and baked them into circles because of the unfortunate consistency of the dough, and they turned out soft and spicy, just as I had hoped. Lastly, TAKE NOTE: don’t skimp on the sugar if you do not plan on decorating them! I do this with most cookie recipes and I am usually pleased with the results. But these cookies need the full amount of sugar to balance out all of the wonderful spices. With a few tweaks, this recipe could be great.

Yes these cookies came out amazingly DELICIOUS! Since they were eaten by both grownups and children, I put 1/4 tsp nutmeg and everything else the same. We had to make another batch soon after the first batch of cookies were eagerly eaten! Will definitely share and make this recipe again and again!

I made this a couple of days ago for Christmas and they were great.  I would increase the spices just by 1/4 to taste. Also the cookies are best eaten the next day. Not the same day. 24 hrs later actually gives it the flavor of homemade cookies. I eat one after I baked it and was disappointed but a day later, they tasted great. Also the royal icing adds a great compliment to your creation.

Made this recipe as written. Turned out soft enough to be delicious and still sturdy enough to make gingerbread houses with. Would certainly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is definitely going into "the box" as my family calls it.  I did follow suggestion of other reviews to double all spices except the cloves as we prefer a little extra in our gingerbread.  It turned out fantastic!  Only down side is that the dog was also quite impressed and ate half the batch as they were cooling.

I made this recipe on a whim. No one in my family likes gingerbread anything.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I refrigerated the dough overnight, and the next morning I broke it into 3 parts to work one third of the dough at a time, making sure the other two thirds of the dough stayed cold till I got to them. The dough was very sticky, but I rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper, unsticking the paper from the dough every time I rolled over it with the rolling pin. It made 23 - 3.5 inch gingerbread men, and 35 - 1.5" ginger stars.  The smell while baking was intensely spicy-fragrant, and we aren't used to these smells at our house.  Anyway, they tasted fine to me.  The cookies baked for 5 minutes on the top shelf of the oven, and 4 minutes on the bottom, for a total of 9 minutes.  I baked the stars the same way, but for 8 minutes instead of 9.

I am SO sorry I can only give this recipe 5 stars.  I have made so many different gingerbread man recipes and I have finally found one that is soooo good and easy to work with.  I love the spiciness of the cookies.  It is not overbearing and has the perfect balance.  I baked them for 8 minutes which made them just slightly crispy on the edges yet soft in the middle.
You may want to get discouraged thinking the dough is too sticky but it is not!  Just add a little extra dusting to your board and they will come out perfectly....learned this by trial and error.  My great granddaughter who is not a cookies lover, really like these.  So give them a try exactly as the recipe is written, then if you feel you must make adjustments, do it the next time.  Happy Baking!!

The best! Dough wasn’t too sticky to work with, & the best flavor I have ever had in a gingerbread cookie. Made these for the past two years & have been a hit everywhere I’ve taken them. 
Multiple requests for the recipe... but I can’t give away this secret ;)

Many compliments on the taste of the cookie. A couple tips/notes: When baking, I had to remove them at the 8 minute mark and immediately take them off the pan or it would over bake. Note the cookies harden when out of the oven. Also, this batter sticks to everything. I had to use a good amount of flour on the surface while I was rolling it out and used parchment paper on the top of it so the rolling pin didn’t stick.

I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour.  Except for that... I followed direction exactly.  I used a food scale and metric measurements.  I scaled the recipe for 6 cookies and got 4 good sized cookies.  I made the dough and put in fridge overnight.  I didn't have any problem rolling out or cutting the the dough!  My oven needed 12 minutes... but they did come out a little crunchy. :)  Great tasting cookie and super easy!  First rolled cookie that I didn't hate! :-)

Help. It looks like video says 1/2 tsp for cloves and ginger - but recipe calls for 1 tsp clove and 1 tsp for ginger. Made as stated in recipe and was too sticky and too much clove.  Used butter instead of margarine and not sure after over night in refrigerator, the dough, within a minute of working it was too soft. Suspect it needs more flour and less clove. Not sure I want to keep experimenting with this one. bummer.

Loved the spice and molasses combo of this recipe. I cut mine a little thinner than planned so they turned out softer than I hoped (I was afraid I'd forget about them if I tried to bake them longer).  Next time I'll roll dough to 1/2" thickness and bake a little longer.  Yummy overall.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I made it with spelt and had to substitute extra baking powder for the baking soda and they turned out perfectly!  The best gingerbread cookies I've ever made.  

However the dough is really tough to work with it it far to sticky to roll easily.  With a little experimentation I found that freezing the dough before rolling makes it far easier and using baking paper AND flour to make sure things don't stick.  Freezing after the cookies are cut into shapes makes them keep their shape better while baking and they won't spread too much.

Very sticky as others have said.  I found using the freezer for the dough with generous flour  is what helped.  Cookies bake up crispy on the outside with the perfect chew on the inside.  Flavor is spot on!

These were soft, the recipe made  9-10 good-sized cookies. I think it is missing a spice(allspice?? and vanilla). The dough can be a bit sticky, so make sure to refrigerate prior to rolling out. The cookies didn't spread much. It's a good recipe.

The flavor is amazing with just the right amount of spice. They have a pleasant crispy texture as well. However, even chilled, this dough is way too sticky to slice with cookie cutters prior to baking. I rolled two flat sheets covering my 2 baking sheets and cut the gingerbread people out after baking.  8 minutes see

These are very tasty. I used dark molasses (like my mamaw always did) and it was plenty of spice. Cookies are nice and soft. I rolled them out at 1/4" and they are perfect.  I used butter instead of margarine and I use organic sugar.

These are REALLY GOOD with the following, slight modifications:  I used butter, decreased the cloves by 1/2 (I wouldn't want more than that) and increased the other spices by approximately 1.5%.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for gingerbread cookies!

This was absolutely delicious! Spicy, but not to much. I followed the recipe exactly except I took the advice of other people and chilled dough overnight the dough is VERY sticky but chilling, and keeping it chilled as much as possible worked wonders!  By keeping the dough chilled it allowed me to not  use extra flour when working the dough for cutting. The cookies are super moist!  Everyone has loved them!

These were absolutely delicious. They actually are a little bit spicy too! The dough was definitely soft when rolling it out, but adding a little flour to the surface/rolling pin did the trick in maintaining good cutouts.

I enjoyed the robust flavor of the cloves.  I will use only a half teaspoon of salt the next time I use this recipe since the baking soda can add a salty flavor. I over cooked the first batch which made them rock hard. When working with dark dough, it is hard to judge doneness without tasting. So I would stick to the suggested 10 minutes if I were you. There was no reason to add extra flour if you refrigerated your dough for the time suggested. I covered my mixing bowl with plastic wrap and put it straight into the refrigerator. Rolling out on wax paper was easy with a light sprinkle of flour on the wax paper, but be careful not to put flour on top of your cookie dough otherwise it will show on your cookie after baking. All in all the cookie was not bad.

I'll make it again, but will need to double the recipe if doing gingerbread men! I don't know how to get almost 3 dozen men out of this!

I ended up using a small committee cutter in order to get the 30! But they're tasty!

Made these exactly by the recipe, adding extra ginger and a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper, and they are pretty good. The dough was easily workable after chilling and baked up well, they just didn’t have punch we like even after adding the extra spice. If you like your gingerbread mild, go for this recipe.

Just couldn't keep these delicious cookies in the house over the Holidays. Made several batches with different shapes and decorations, with each batch being devoured in a matter of days. Tried them rolled out thinly for a crisp cookie and rolled out thicker for a more chewy texture. Either way was a hit with everyone. I preferred the crispier version. It was unanimous that this spicy gingerbread recipe is much more tasty  than the usual bland molassesy versions, and closer to the traditional rich complex British/Caribbean flavour we're used to! For best results:  keep the dough refrigerated in small balls ( 4 or so) until ready to roll out and work quickly; be generous with all the spices, including the ground cloves; a few pinches of freshly ground mace really enhances the flavour; and easy on the molasses. Best gingerbread cookie recipe!!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to just follow the recipe (other than using butter and not margarine)  , and I am glad I did. My children who love decorating gingerbread cookies never liked to actually eat them - until now. This recipe makes a light, soft yet crispy cookie (though firm enough to build a gingerbread house) that is perfect for dipping into tea or coffee. We made the first batch after Christmas. Today is the 12th of January, and I am mixing the third batch. I bake the cookies for 8 minutes, any longer changes the consistency and - strangely - even the flavor quite a bit.

The only change was to use butter instead of margarine. I found this to be easy and delicous. They ended up tender not crispy. Everyone liked these. I also like how this recipe doesn't make a huge batch. I think this will be our family's new recipe for gingerbread men.

Great gingerbread.  My partner decided to make it even spicier with some black pepper added.

I made these cuties mostly per the recipe, except I used butter, bumped up the cinnamon, and didn't include the cloves (personal preference).  Maybe if I had used the cloves there would have been a stronger spice flavor?  As made, they are still really good.  We're going to be decorating them on Christmas!

This recipe is as close to my childhood gingies as I've ever seen.
I just substituted brown sugar for the granulated sugar, used whole eggs instead of just the yolks and voila! The same
As I remember. The recipe doubled nicely.

I too, qualify as a WestCoastCdngrl, albeit on East Coast now.   What a hassle.  Used butter and thought this was a problem with my dry dough, but read some reviews who liked using butter.  Added 1/2 tsp maple to recipe, still too dry, added 1/8 anise and dough seems moist enough to roll later.  At least now, not as crumbly, sticky factor not applicable using parchment to roll out and bake.    Post baking the first batch came out too done as I had a hard time reading the dough.  However  not burnt, the second batch much better.  I will decorate with icing;  that  should improve overall taste.  However this recipe is not my favourite ginger cookie.

Very yummy! Whole family loved them. I did not have any issues with this recipe. The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of margarine and it all worked out wonderfully! I will definitely make these again!

Easy recipe. I did not use cloves or nutmeg(not particularly a fan of either) however, without those 2 ingredients, I think the cookies came out perfect for my taste! And my boys love them too?? Delicious!

I combined several of the advice of others and they turned out great.  I did NOT add additional flour, except a little when I was rolling them out, but the dough was VERY chilled and hard, so it worked well.  But, I also took the advice of someone else and doubled all of the spices, except for the cloves.  They turned out very tasty and moist.

I kept the recipe the same except for I neglected to buy ginger (I thought I had some), so I subbed cinnamon. It was still really good, but I think they would have been perfect with ginger. I didn't need to refrigerate them or add more flour, as other reviewers stated.  I cooked mine for 10 minutes because I like them a little crispy. Oh, and I subbed butter for the margarine
Thanks for the recipe! :o)

I feel like a good recipe shouldn't have to be tweaked to death. Otherwise, it should just be a different recipe. So I followed precisely and it's just not good and I'm a baking foodie. Cookies are hard as a rock and just not tasty either. Thought I would be able to take them to my 80 year old mother with Alzheimer's, but worried she'll chip a tooth.

I  added more spices except cloves as recommended in other reviews.  Stored batter in fridge for 24 hours and rolled 1/4" thin.  Baked about 10 minutes on a stone baking pan.  Judges said they were very soft and spices were just right.  Won first place in cookie contest, did use different decorations.

The GOOD: I followed the recipe only I used Pamela's GF pancake mix for the flour. Working with the dough was easy - we chilled it for an hour first, then rolled it out between parchment paper after sprinkling the ball and paper with flour. We also dunked the cookie cutters in the GF flour before cutting each cookie to prevent sticking. 

The BAD: The flavor is terrible! Again I followed the spice measurements  only lessened the clove measurement a bit after reading reviews. It tasted WAY over salted and also off, there was too much of something in addition to the salt...we think maybe still too much clove? Not sure. I'm going to read other gingerbread recipes to compare. So even though  we love spicy food and ginger flavor, none of us (out of 4) enjoyed the flavor of these cookies to the point where we don't want to eat them.

CONCL: So a win for finding an easy recipe that works with Pamela's GF pancake mix. Bummer we wasted so much time for cookies we don't like, but the kids at least had fun. I'll tweak the spices and go from there.

I've never made Gingerbread b4 so I followed the recipe exactly.  The are PERFECTION.  When the 1st tray came out a little soft I baked the second tray a little longer for crunchy cookies and they did not disappoint!!!  (Our family prefers crunchy cookies to soft chewy ones )  Both were great!

Let me start by mentioning that I’m a cookie FIEND. I bake upwards of 50 dozen cookies every holiday season, so “been there, tried that”.  This recipe is actually pretty good. I made a double batch right out of the gate, but substituted shortening for butter. I won’t do that next time- it didn’t affect the texture, but it didn’t help the taste. The flavor of these particular spices will “bloom” better with butter, as the recipe states. 

Having read many of the reviews before I tried it, I will say that yup- it’s crumbly. BUT...if you refrigerate the dough overnight (which I did) or freeze it (which others did), the dough WILL come together nicely as you thaw and roll it out. It also will keep its shape well while baking (I.e., no misshapen blobs). 

Why only four stars? I think the amount of flour is off a smidge. Unlike other folks, my dough was nowhere NEAR sticky. I’m used to measuring based on ounces, not cups, so I think that may have something to do with it. Next time, I will use much less flour and add “as needed” while I mix. The only downside to this is that more mixing —> more gluten = denser cookies. 

Bottom line: Don’t dismiss this as your new go-to gingerbread recipe. The key is to tinker with the flour a bit. The flavor is great and it performs well for rolled/cutout dough purposes. I’ll update as I attempt to make a few changes and try it once again.

I don’t like gingerbread cookies usually but these were nice. I followed the directions to the t except for the baking time, 5 minutes was enough time in my oven. My first batch which stayed in the full time were hard and overdone.

These cookies taste delicious.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 1 and 1/2 cups flour and substituted 3/4 c brown sugar for the white sugar.  My only complaint is that my gingerbread men are not very thick and fluffy, but I think that is my fault.  I think I rolled them too thin.  One thing I've noticed about allrecipes.com is that no one seems to state how many the recipe should make.  If I knew how many the recipe should make, I would have known I was cutting them too thin when I turned out with way too many cookies.  Overall this is a great recipe, especially with the slight modifications.

I have made this recipe twice and absolutely love it.  The only change I made was to double the cinnamon.  For my taste, the resulting spice level is perfect.  I made gingerbread men for a Victorian Christmas luncheon that I hosted.  Everyone raved about how good they were.  The leftovers held up exceptionally well, as they were flavorful and tender several days later.   Can hardly wait to make again for Christmas.  I have new gingerbread "house", "man" and "woman" cookie cutters to try.  I may even try my hand at decorating them in the traditional manner.

I make these cookies every Christmas season, and I love them! The cayenne pepper is such an amazing and different addition, and I always get tons of questions and compliments on these! They turn into great gingersnaps as well! I usually take the leftover dough and roll them into walnut sized balls, give them a quick roll in some white sugar, and bake them as usual!

Easy to make, chilled in 3 pieces as recommended which made it easier to work with before cutting out. 8-9 minutes cooking time depending on size of cutter and OMG! Taste amazing - perfectly spiced for my palette!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

My daughter made these for Christmas and I begged for the recipe. Made them myself   Did t cut them quite thick enough, so they were more crisp than my daughter's but still delicious. They're my husband's  new favorite cookie. I'll be making them often.

After a week or more, the gingerbread cookies were still soft on the inside with a nice not too crunchy outside.  I will definitely make this my go to gingerbread recipe.

I doubled this recipe and actually like it better.  Because of the increased molasses the dough is darker, and made soft, chewy cookies.  Every one said they are the best they've had!

This was my first time making gingerbread cookies and they turned out great!!  The dough smelled and tasted too strong or too spicy, so I was concerned, but once cooked they smelled and tasted great!  I especially liked how soft the cookies were and they stayed soft for days!

These are excellent as written.  Key is keeping the dough cold and rolling out between wax paper.

I made some altercations to this recipe that worked out really well for me. The first was I used butter instead of margarine. Secondly I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I changed some of the spices too;  I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and only 1/2 tsp of  ground cloves. I also added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract. These cookies turned out great they were soft with a very cinnamon taste and a hint of spice which I loved.

Wonderful cookies!   I followed the recipe with one exception, subbed butter for the margarine.  Keep the dough as cold as you can during the rolling process to avoid stickiness. I rolled it between two sheets of parchment. No extra flour needed. Also lined the baking sheets with parchment.   Thanks to Stephanie for a great recipe!

Perfect dough for cookies or gingerbread house.  Naturally, flavoring is optional.  I love the scent of cardamom in it (being euoropean),  that is additional to the original ingredients.  Also, I always add lemon zest.  Just like salt, it brings the flavors to life.  Again, since I am european, I add pure honey instead of molasses (the same amount as it is calling in the recipe.  HONEY dough does not like to be touched.  Mix it with a silicon, or wooden tool.  Put it in the fridge to rest.  DO NOT turn on the oven until you are at least halfway done with cutting the cookies.  Maybe it sound like an over kill, but I like it when my job is a breeze, so I even turn off humidifier, shade my windows that would shine on my work area.  I made for times the amount for a party last Saturday.  It is only Friday, and I just got the next double batch done!  Doesn't it say it all?! :-)

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic!! The dough started a little crumbly but once you work it out a bit, it rolls nicely. I rolled it in confectioner's sugar. For those who think these aren't "spicy" enough...I'm not sure what kind of gingerbread cookies you eat, but these are certainly spicy enough for me!

I will definitely make these again!

These cookies were amazing. Easy to make and delicious. I accidentally left the 2nd tray in for a minute too long and they overcooked. I sent them to work with my husband?? and kept the good ones for my Xmas cookie boxes.

This batter was so sticky! We could not use cookie cutters with it! We had to fight the dough to even get it off the spoon into the baking sheet. I'm not sure what went wrong but I'll try a new recipe next year.

This recipe was great. We only chilled the dough for about 30 minutes and it still rolled without issue. Taste was perfect. Texture was perfect baked at the recommended time of 8 minutes. Will definitely make it again.

Made this twice before reviewing. Perfect recipe! My first (and second) time making gingerbread from scratch. I subbed butter for margarine. I wanted the second batch really spicy so I put in an overfull teaspoon of ginger. I noticed a huge difference in texture from my first batch to my second. The first batch I started with room temperature butter and whipped into cream with the sugar. The second batch I had less prep time and melted the butter. Starting with room temp made for much fluffier cookies. They puffed up quite a bit. Overall yum!

I like it really spicy so I added about a tsp of fresh ground pepper. I kept the dough in the refrigerator for 2 days before I could make the cookies. The dough was perfect for rollling and cutting and baked beautifully.

My wife doesn't like cookies that are sweet and as a diabetic I also shy away from them. These cookies, however, are to die for. We both love them. So now the question is do we want to give as Christmas gifts as originally intended? I made two additional batches so problem solved. I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the cloves in half based on some reviewers comments.

Excellent cookie.  Used brown sugar instead of white because that is what I normally use.  Keep dough cold and it rolled out great.  Nice flavor.

Love this recipe!  Tasty, rolls out well between wax paper, takes well to decorations (red hots, sprinkles and mini M&Ms).  My 3year old daughter and I enjoyed the whole process of making these together.  UPDATING THIS REVIEW because I've made these at least a dozen times now - use Grandma's molasses rather than any other kind - it makes a big difference in taste.

Great chewy gingerbread! I followed the recipe exactly as written except for the spices because the cloves looked like way too much. Instead, I used 1 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp. cloves. This combination is spicy and balanced. Even with regular molasses the cookies come out dark and strong tasting, which I like, but my kids do not. Substituting corn syrup for some of the molasses makes the cookies lighter in color and taste and appeal to a larger audience. 

The dough will be wet, but do not give in to the urge to add more flour which will toughen the cookies. Chill the dough for at least a couple hours and roll it between two sheets of wax paper to prevent sticking. The dough becomes exceedingly sticky and difficult to handle at room temperature, so put it back in the fridge between baking. *Do not over-bake.* 8 or 9 minutes made nice, soft cookies.

I followed some of the other comments.  I was generous on the flour and spices.  I also used a generous 1/4 cup of raw sugar and 1/4 cup of brown.  I did not have any  margarine, but used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening.  The cookies turned out wonderfully, spicy and rich flavored, although they did spread a little.

my first ever attempt at home made gingerbread cookies. Awesome!!!  I didn't chill the dough cause I am so impatient but just floured my surface and my roller.  They turned out so cute and delicious and soft just like I was looking for.  Thanks

These turned out great! Easy to roll, good texture, and good flavor. They did lack a strong spicy bite that some gingerbread cookies have, so if you like your cookies very spicy you might want to add some more spices. Also, the recipe makes a small batch, so I would definitely double it next time. I drizzled thick basic glaze (powdered sugar and milk) and they turned out fabulous.

The cookies tasted good, but the work put into them was not worth it. I made the recipe as listed and the dough was mush! I chilled it over night for 12+ hours, but that didnt really do anything. If I do make this again, I'm going to add more flour and brownsugar like someone suggesteed and probably use unsalted butter instead like I always do for my cookies. But as is, I am rating this recipe as it is LISTED, and as it is listed it NOT good.

Great recipe,  I like mine quite spicy so I added extra ginger and allspice instead of clove.  Depending on personal preference 10 min in the oven is great for a nice soft cookie or you can increase it to 15 min for a slightly crunchier cookie, but make sure you keep an eye on them they burn very quickly.

I made these cookies with only one adjustment, instead of margarine, I used butter.  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe said.  They came out perfect, and we iced them with white chocolate icing.  This recipe made 24 cookies

This is a very good recipe. I gave it four stars because AS WRITTEN there is too much clove. I'll cut it in half next time. The taste of the other spices are there but blurred by the clove. For those who think it's not spicy enough, I suggest checking your spices. They may be out of date. Spices are one place you shouldn't skimp when buying ingredients.

These cookies are awesome.  I experimented and found that doubling the cinnamon and halving the cloves tasted best.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I refrigerated the dough over night and rolled out between sheets of parchment paper.  I cut out circles with a biscuit cutter and made 21 cookies.  I put the cut cookies on the.cookie sheet in the refrigerator for 5 minutes before baking.  I cooked in a gas oven for 8 minutes.  I also did a batch by scooping the dough with a 2 Oz scope and rolling the balls in large crystal sugar and pressed the balls flat with a glass.  Both cookies were awesome.

Great recipie. I doubled the spice (I love spice) and it tasted strong like pumpkin pie. So I was happy!  I did chill overnight and it was hard to roll out. So I wouldn't do that again. Rolled out well between parchment paper with a bit of powdered sugar. Used electric mixer on low. Be sure to not over mix. Cookies came out same size as went in which was nice. I will be making a double l of these and freezing them to eat year round. Well worth the work.

Best tip is rolling chilled dough between two pieces of plastic wrap. Then remove top layer of plastic and do your cookie cutting.  Slide the plastic wrap with cut dough onto cool baking sheet.  Then put the cut dough in freezer 5 minutes.  Then remove pan from freezer and remove cutouts and place them on parchment paper and bake.

My family really enjoyed these cookies.  I reduced the cloves as well and used fresh crushed ginger (1T) and everyone found it very yummy.  I appreciate the reviews as I have a gluten intolerance and cannot taste most of my baking - so I look for consistent remarks  - like too much cloves. These hints are greatly appreciated and can save me a good deal of time when I'm trying a recipe for the first time.

The Christmas season does not really kick off in my house until we've made these. Decorating them is family tradition even my college aged kids look forward to. They have the perfect softness to them and the flavour cant be beat. To make sure the cookies are even and not too thick or thin in one area, I roll between 2 appropriate  sized dowels. All the cookies come out the same with no too crispy edges

Excellent! These cookies are nice and soft but firm enough to handle and decorate. The ONLY change you need to make is use a whole egg or else the dough is too dry.

I love spicy cookies,  so I doubled all of the spices except the cloves,  and I found that I was missing them, so next time I'll just double all the spices. I used Vietnamese Cinnamon, and found it rather subdued (in a good way), however I may add more next time for a little extra.

10/10 will make again

I made these completely as is, and think they're wonderful!  A little more flour could be added so it's not as sticky, but the taste is wonderful!

This is a wonderful mildly spiced cookie.  I added an extra 1/4 cup flour and the cut out consistency was perfect!  This will be my go to recipe!

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. First try in making gingerbread cookies by a non-cook (amateur or otherwise). The result didn't disappoint after around 10 mins in the oven. The clove is strong. I made several sizes of cookies. The small ones are 80% crunchy (I love crunchy), the bigger snowman cookies are mostly soft and a bit crunchy at the edges, although there is a bit of "cardboard texture" outside. Still love it, though.

My favourite gingerbread cookies! I love the spices in this recipe, and I'm so happy to have found it. When I was a kid we always got a certain brand of box mix gingerbread, until one year they stopped making them and I couldn't seem to get any as good...until this. Delicious, and while others may find the clove taste to be too much, I think it's just right.

i always follow the recipe exactly the first time i make something. The only thing is my molasses is stronger than what you would normally buy at the store so when i made the dough it was very strong tasting. i was making it for a recital so i was really hoping it wasn't going to turn out bad, but after it was baked it was DELICIOUS! i am definitely going to make this again! :D

This recipe makes the most delicious gingerbread cookies ever; better than any store bought that's for sure! They taste the best the day after for they stay soft. I followed the recipe exactly and had great results. I made a butter cream icing for fall ones and have put melted milk chocolate on them for valentine's day (so good!). I keep my shapes simple; just the circumference of a small measuring cup, and they turn out perfect in 8 minutes. Do make them a bit thick, I find it helps them stay moist for longer, but mind you they don't last long in my house! :D

I want to update from a previous review I posted.  I almost never bake, so when I saw margarine, I thought the stuff in my fridge was good to go.  So, I'm wrong and there's other margarine that I should've been using!  Even with my baking mishap (way too runny before), I was able to problem solve and the cookies were delicious.  There's just the right amount of spices and flavour.

I added cardamom and used butter instead of margarine, plus added some cayenne pepper, and these were spicy and delicious.

Great for making gingerbread houses. Triple the recipe for a large house. Also use chocolate candy melts to fuse together the pieces. Can't melts give a stronger fuse than royal icing and it dries faster.

I followed the advice of others and substituted 3/4Cup of brown sugar for the white sugar and didn't have any issue with the the texture of the cookies being like cardboard but I also don't pack my flour, I make sure it's nice and fluffy when measured off, and level it with a knife. I make nice thick 1/4 inch cookies so they're softer. I cut 3 of them real thin and they were crunchy and hard, so definitely make sure you roll them out to a decent thickness... I definitely agree with other reviewers that they weren't necessarily "spicy" like the title says. I will make these again and try doubling the spices like another reviewer suggested. After making them again I will modify my review. Definitely like this recipe and will make them again.

I love the flavor of the cookies this recipe produced, but struggled with its stickiness.  Added up to 1 more cup of flour and put the dough in the freezer before I found it easy enough to work with.  Definitely recommend, though.

Followed recipe exactly & chilled overnight. The dough was the consistency of muffin batter - super sticky. Added 1/2 cup more flour & used a lot of flour when rolling - worked out well. Tasted good & looked good. Thanks!

This dough is VERY sticky to work with, there is a very heavy molasses flavour which over powers the spiciness and the final product is not crispy but chewy.  I followed the recipe to a T wih the exception of adding more flour so that I could work with it, and I am very very disappointed.

These are super yummy and so fun to make with the kiddies. Followed the recipe exactly, except substituted butter for margarine, and they came out perfectly. They are not too spicy at all, in fact exactly what a gingerbread cookie should taste like. P.S. You definately have to refridgerate the dough overnite.  I think that may be where some were having trouble?

The flavor of these cookies is just awesome!  The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is that they are very difficult to roll and cut.  

Your dough needs to be and remain cold to roll and cut successfully, which would likely happen if you had stone counter tops and a stone or steel roller.  If you are like me and don't have both then I recommend to use a touch of flour on the dough and roll it out between 2 pieces of parchment paper as other reviews have suggested.  This worked somewhat well for me, I had to pop the cut yet unseparated dough in the fridge for a bit to get cookies off of the parchment paper.  I guess you could also just pull off the excess and bake them on the parchment paper, I didn't try that but will next year!

Bottom line: these cookies are worth the effort to roll!  Bake them, enjoy, and share, if you can (it will be hard to let them go home with family)! :)

Everybody is saying how their dough was too sticky, but I didn't have a problem with it.  I used canola oil instead of margarine, so maybe that made a difference.  Other alterations: I cut down on the cloves to 3/4 tsp, used 1/4 tsp salt, and I used 1/2 tsp ginger with a lot of freshly grated ginger too(maybe I'll use even more fresh ginger next time).  I don't like very sweet things, so maybe next time I'll cut down on the sugar a bit. I expected to decorate them, but I liked them so much that I just left them plain.  Eight minutes bake time left them crispy on the outside and slightly chewy in the middle.  I didn't expect to like them as much as I did, and I would make them again.

When I was younger I HATED gingerbread cookies but I LOVED this recipe. The only change I made to it was I left out the ground cloves and I added homemade icing to the cookies after they cooled. They were delicious and I suggest you make two batches 'cause these cookies flew off the plate.

Doubled the recipe. Subbed butter for the margarine, and used additional spices (cardamom, star anise & cayenne). No issue with dough, gave it ample chilling time. Nicely spiced and lovely texture.

This was a good recipe. I used black strap molasses and followed the recipe exactly.  I found that keeping the dough thick made for chewy cookies.  It was a nice adult gingerbread cookie- kind spicy.

Theresa were the best gingerbread cookie I've ever had. I did add the extra flour, as some reviewers suggested. I also have very small children and do not have the time to roll and cookie cut, so I teaspoon rolled them, then rolled them in green and red sprinkles for our holiday liking. I also pushed a small chocolate chip into the middle to look like the peanut butter kiss cookies. Super cute. Super yummy, and great with iced latte... Santa will be pleased to have these laid out for him...

Dough was very dry.  Had to add lots of oil to give it some moisture.  My kids love the taste though!

Good recipe.  Very sticky dough but easily remedied by flouring your surface well before cutting out shapes.  Also you can knead in extra flour if it's too sticky.  Better too sticky than too dry which makes it impossible.   If you can't make this recipe, then maybe you should buy your dough instead.  Or stop baking altogether.

Has a spicy essence but not too strong. They are a good classic taste. I frosted with melted white chocolate for a bit of added sweetness.

I have used this recipe for several years now. I look forward to the holidays so I can make these. The only thing that I have changed is using butter instead of margarine. Delicious and soft cookies every time.

When I made this for my family, they immediately became the "World's best gingerbread men". In Norway, which is where I live we usually have this tradition where the kids in the family cut out these in different sizes and shapes, decorate them and then eat them for Christmas.
so this is my rating:
Taste: 12/10
Shape-ability: 8/10
Spices: 100/10
Well to make a summary, Best recipe ever!

My daughter and I make this recipe every Christmas. They are delicious! I made a batch yesterday and my daughter, son and a friend ate the whole batch in one afternoon/evening (Oh, yes, I had a few, too. :^). We don't change a thing; they are perfect as-is. The dough seems very soft, but after chilling they roll and cut out perfectly.

Added 1/8 C brown sugar with the sugar and butter and an extra 1/8 C flour in hopes of using a crazy cookie cutter (it didn't work, the dough was sticky).  Also only used 1/2 tsp of cloves and made up the difference with cinnamon and nutmeg.  Glorious.  I ended up using smaller cookie cutters (~2" tall and 1" wide) and cooked 7 minutes.  I am high altitude, if that makes a difference.  I cut them out on silicone cookie mats so I didn't have to transfer them.  This probably reduces the life of the mats, but I could see no other way.  The cookies were a hit at the party.  Next time we plan on cutting out small sticks and building a structure.  Not firm enough for large sheets for walls, but it will be a repeated recipe.

Followed recipe exactly and it wasnt just a little sticky, it was so sticky that after being overnight in the fridge it still would not roll out. The taste is excellent but making gingerbread"bread" instead of gingerbread"men" defeated the whole purpose of this recipe. I ended up baking it in one slab. Once it was cooled I cut out the cooled bread with heart shaped cookie cutters. I then made cinnamon ice cream,froze that as a slab and cut out heart shaped pieces of ice cream. I put the ice cream between 2 cookies and refroze until after dinner. The family loved the icrem sandwiches so I made success out of disaster. But I still do not have gingerbread men cookies!

Delicious & easy to make! Used butter instead of margarine. Dough was easy enough to work with as long as dough is cilled, and you sprinkle extra flour on rolling surface as well as following pin. Very tasty - got plenty of compliments.

Love this recipe! The children love these too!
I wasn't able to get molasses and cloves.
I replaced both molasses and sugar with brown sugar and omitted cloves.
My family don't really like ginger but I used 1 teaspoon ginger powder. The aroma match with other spices very well! Everyone are able to accept it.
If you are looking for a strong ginger taste/spicy you might want to increase the amount of ginger.

I swapped out the white sugar for brown sugar and added an extra 1/2 tsp of ginger but otherwise stuck to the recipe. These were absurdly sticky, even after two hours in the fridge. I think I worked in two or three cups of flour just to make them manageable. The flavor was bland, probably in part to the extra flour, and didn't have any sweetness. I got 20 gingerbread men out of the batch and because I was tight on time I decided to pipe on some frosting and serve them anyway, but I won't be making this recipe again.

I used Darlingdash's tip (3/4 brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour), and someone else's tip to dust off the extra flour before baking them. The result was so delicious I ate two before my husband caught me. That said, it's been a long time since I made gingerbread, and I forgot that they rise. My dinosaurs are indistinguishable from my trains, snow-people, and pine trees. I also had to put half the dough back in the fridge because it was getting too soft to roll out. For the rest of the dough, and the next batch, I will stick to more traditional, and less distinct gingerbread people, and put fewer on my baking tin.

I did not double the spices like others suggested. Dough can be sticky but kept it chilled and coat with flour when rolling and its fine. Very good consistency and pretty color.  I only baked for 8 min. and they were perfect.

I love, love, love this recipe!  It's quick, easy, full of flavor and doesn't require tons of ingredients!  I actually printed it off with the intention of making it closer to the holidays, but I was so pleased with its simplicity, that I took the recipe out of the drawer and got to baking!   Yum!!!

I'm very happy with the results. I read through a lot of reviews and made notes before making them. I made just one batch and separated the dough into four, and then pressed flat between glad wrap so I didn't have to wait so long for it to set. I used butter, golden syrup, doubled the spices, and substituted allspice for cloves. Yes the dough is wet and crumbly and sticks to everything, but you just have to flour the work surface and rolling pin every time you roll and I had no problem at all. Use a spatula to get the men onto the tray if needed. And being Summer in Australia, I know to work fast because the dough will go back to room temperature in less than 5 minutes! I experimented with various thicknesses and will now make a batch to give away for Christmas. I would also suggest popping the baking trays with uncooked men back in the fridge for ten minutes first to help them keep their shape and not spread too much.

Discovered this recipe a couple of years ago and fell in love with gingerbread men!  I followed the instructions, didn't change a thing - they came out perfect.  I do ice the cookies once they are cool.  They stay chewy for close to a week.  I barely get 36 cookies from this batch, so best to double it if makiing for a crowd.

Love love love this recipe. I'm on my second batch this week. I do refrigerate longer (because I'm usually running around doing other things) and that may be the difference since I've had no issues with stickiness...if anything, I have to knead the dough to get it stickier. I also use a non stick rolling pin and a cookie mat instead of flouring the rolling surface which works wonderfully. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I tried this recipe last year and I can tell you this, loved it! the cookies melted in my mouth and were perfectly spiced. my only complaint is that the dough is a tad sticky, but I fixed that by keeping the dough in the fridge between batches and making sure to flour the rolling pin. And I'm definitely making this again this year.

my 6 year old loved these, my hubby said they needed to be iced more.  But he doesn't really like gingerbread cookies.  I iced them with homemade royal icing.  I also tinted some of the dough red and put little hearts in the middle, since it is close to valentines day.  The dough was very sticky and hard to work with even though I did refrigderate it and use whole wheat flour.  Other wise this recipe is good.

Made this recipe using Shortening rather than Margarine.  -someone old me that margarine/butter doughs spread more, and shortening stays in shape better.  Otherwise I followed recipe to a T.  I would recommend rolling the dough out on the parchment paper that you'll be baking on, cut out the shapes, and remove the excess away.  This way your cookies stay in shape and don't stick to the surface.  Chilling scrap dough before re-rolling helps a lot.  Rolling and baking on same parchment paper also helps when you move the cookies onto a cooling rack.

Recipe also works for Gingerbread Houses.  I rolled the dough out to about 3/8", dough made 1 house with a bit left over for trees, decorations, and a chimney.

It's a delicious cookie, but I agree with previous comments about it not being spicy enough!

I was VERY skeptical about this recipe.  I had only blackstrap molasses, which is stronger than the regular kind.  Then I read reviews that stated that the molasses was overpowering in their recipes.  I ended up cutting the molasses in half (1/4 c) and then adding 1/4 c of agave nectar.  I also cut the cloves down to 1/2 tsp.  I was still worried until we tasted them. They are very good - even my ridiculously picky son liked them. We will make them again next Christmas.

Yum!  I used 1/4 t of nutmeg and 3/4 t of cloves just because I was worried they would be overwhelming.  It was still nicely spicy.

I just made these to give away as Christmas gifts and they turned out really well. ^^ I cooked them exactly according to the directions except I made a double batch, one with honey instead of molasses and one with blackstrap molasses instead of milder molasses. I made maybe 12-14 cookies in total from each batch (I made them really thick) and baked them for about 8 minutes. They just came out of the oven a half hour ago and are still soft, but I can't judge their fully cooled softness. 
I will mention one thing though: the dough is pretty dry. When rolling out I recommend adding a slight bit of water to the dough. Also, give a good few hours for the dough to soften to roll out after refrigerating it. My honey one softened fairly quickly, but the molasses took about three hours to soften enough to roll. >

I have never written a review before but this recipe is so delicious I just had to.  It took me right back to my childhood and the cookies my German Great Grandmother used to make.  The dough is super simple to work with and you can even bake them a bit longer if you like a crispier cookie without the flavor changing at all.
Can't say enough good things about this recipe.

These are wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly - perfect. Moist and delicious, but plenty firm enough for easy transport, gifting, decorating, whatever you need. We rolled out between parchment sheets, which made things very easy. My two-year-old decorated by drizzling melted white chocolate on top.  They look wonderful and taste amazing. These could be a new tradition for us.

I had really high hopes for these gingerbread cookies. The texture was perfect, but the flavors were way too pungent. Kind of reminds you of the Christmas candles. All the containers I put them in now have a permanent gingerbread smell!! :(  Maybe I'll try again with half the spices....

I was a little worried when I put the dough in the fridge as it was crubmly, but I worked it a little and it rolled out great. The most handsome gingerbread I've made and didn't puff up in the oven. I did leave out the cloves and added a bit more cinnamon. The flavour of the cookies is fantastic and my four year old and her friends love them!

Delicious - great spice flavor. Please note that the recipe takes an hour more than noted, if you do in fact chill dough for an hour as directed.  This one goes in my collection!

I'll give this 4 stars, because for those who love an authentic spicy gingerbread cookie, these are definitely spicy.  The only modifications I made were using butter instead of margarine, and adding 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The flavor was a little overwhelming for my taste, and did have a bit of an aftertaste.  Next time I'll cut back on the cloves and molasses.  However, they cooked great and were soft and chewy.  Everyone liked them.

The cookies were delicious! Only complaint is that the dough needs to be instructed to chill for much longer. I let chill for 4 hours and it was still extremely difficult to roll out.

I used butter, substituted light brown sugar, and per other reviewers I cut the amount of cloves in half.  I refrigerated the dough for one hour, rolled it in a little bit of flour, then rolled it between 2 sheets of Glad Wrap.  I didn't have a problem with it being too sticky.  I kept unused portions in fridge.  Next time I will double recipe.  Flavor was perfect.  I froze them and will frost them closer to Christmas.

One word...AMAZING!!! The flavor is my favorite of all gingerbreads...Followed recipe almost to a tee, I did not have cloves so I substituted allspice. Chilled in the fridge for about 20 hrs and had absoloutely no problem rolling dough out. I just put a bit of flour on the surface and the rolling pin and it came out great! The gingerbread men held shape and cracked very little. Did not compromise appearance enough to be an issue.

Although the dough was a little bit of a pain to work with (would crack and not roll out easily), the cookies turned out great!  I sub'd out the ground cloves for all spice (didn't have any cloves on hand) and they turned out yummy.  Looking forward to icing them and getting some ready for Santa!

This is a perfect recipe! There is no need to change a thing. The only advice I can offer is if you prefer a crispy cookie you can roll these out thinner, and if you like them soft, roll them to the 1/4 inch thickness.

This is the perfect gingerbread cookie recipe.  I have a home child care and often bake with the kids, and this recipe was perfect as written.  The dough was very easy to work with, and the flavor isn't too molasses-y- sometimes the the little kiddos dont care for that strong flavor.  These were very yummy!

I had a horrible experience with this recipe. I made them exactly as written, but there was NOT enough flour, I let the dough sit overnight and I could not roll these out. They were so sticky I couldn't move them after cutting them out. I tried baking some but the taste and texture wasn't worth the effort, I threw the rest away. I'll try another recipe for our gingerbread this year.

After reading the reviews I added a little more cinnamon, ginger and cut the cloves in half.  I also used butter.  They came out very good and rolled out nicely after chilling.  Also used white whole wheat to add more nutrition. I would make this again.

My first gingerbread men. I upped the flour to 2-1/2 cups at first, and just a bit more during mixing, doubled the spices except clove and added 1/2 teaspoon allspice. Love them, my dough mix was dry and easy to ball and roll, and lift cookies. I did not need to chill before rolling. At first my dough was crumbly and could not hold together (due to more flour) but I sprinkled water until it just balled and held together to roll. A dream to cut and loved by all. A wonderful soft cookie. Also, my oven is broke so I baked them 3 at a time in a toaster over on a double sheet of aluminum foil... they came out beautifully.

Loved this recipe. So tasty & the cookies came out awesome! The dough was a little sticky. next time i will divide the dough & refigerate it seperated. I used a little flour on the rolling surface & the rolling pin & gently rolled the dough out. Was just fine. I would definitely make this again & again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Perfect just the way it is.  Perfect flavour and consistency.  I did not have an issue with stickiness, as others have said.  It says to leave the dough to chill for an hour, and perhaps skipping that step could result in stickiness.  Baked them to be firm enough to ice and decorate, but still soft and chewy on the inside.  Best gingerbread men recipe I've used!  Thanks!

Perfect as is.  The only thing I did was double the recipe to make more yummy soft, spicy cookies.  The dough was a joy to work with

Cookies were chewy and delicious !! I substituted brown sugar instead of white sugar (1/2 cup). Next time I would add 1/2 tsp of allspice and only a half a tsp of cloves. Definitely a keeper!

These were great! Chewy and very tasty. It's hard to stop eating them!  Only problem I had was the dough - as some of the reviewers said, it was too wet. I think I added extra 1/2 cup or so and it turned out perfectly.  Also, since my son doesn't like them too spicy, I put less cloves and ginger and increased the amount of cinnamon a little.  I'll definitely be making these again!

I found this recipe to be most unfavorable too much clove not enough sugar. The cookies came out soft. We were hoping for firm enough to frost but wanted some plain also. not good in our opinion.

Perfect recipe...my go-to for rolled gingerbread cookies.  I double the recipe and roll the dough thick so that cookies come out soft and chewy.  Frost with cream cheese icing and decorate.  They hold up well in the freezer.

This was my first time making gingerbread of any sort, and compared to whatever recipe my cousin makes each year when she makes hers, I find that these are great.  I've never really cared for gingerbread, but following this recipe to the letter, I've come to really like them.  As other reviewers noted they aren't really "spicy" but nicely spiced.  I found I was having a lot of trouble rolling the dough out and not having it stick and fall apart (making me think I screwed up somewhere), but thanks to my husband showing me "the trick" (slower rolling relying more on pressure than speed), I got the hang of it and every batch turned out great!

These were awesome! Perfect flavor and perfect texture. I did have to keep the dough really cold to get it to roll without sticking, but it was totally worth the extra effort!

What delicious cookies! I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and doubled all the spices except for the nutmeg, which got an extra 1/4 tsp. only because I'm not fond of its flavor. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!  With the extra spices the cookies are the perfect balance of flavors, and the texture is out of this world--soft and chewy straight from the oven and then a little crisper (but still tender) after cooling on a wire rack.  Wonderful recipe--thanks for sharing!

These are awesome!!  I didn't change a thing and they were just perfect.  We like our gingerbread cookies a little thinner, more like snaps, and these worked just fine soft or crisp.  Love them!

This recipe is ok.  The dough is sticky and I had to add much more flour to get it to a rolling consistency.  Taste is god, but  a little heavy on the salt, I'd do a heaping 1/4 Tsp next time.  Also these were mild in flavor for my house's taste.  I'd up the cinnamon and ginger to a full TSP next time.  Also I cut these a little thicker than 1/4" and then they rolled and cut much better.  Pretty tasty all in all.

This recipe was great. I followed all of the instructions except I took the advice of another person and doubled the spices, all but the cloves. The dough was very sticky, but I refrigerated it and that helped. Stayed fresh for days (almost a week I think)

These are the best! I've made these 3 times in the past month and everyone seems to like them--including my sister who claims to hate ginger.
I don't use all of the molasses, though. I add about 2T molasses and use honey for the rest because I don't really like molasses. These cookies are awesome!

Easy dough to work with and a nice spice.  My daughter thought they were a bit to spicy, so next time I may adjust the spices a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe in my opinion.  I added the flour slowly because someone said 2 cups was too much - I used almost 2 cups. I increased the ginger and cinnamon and a little less cloves + I added about 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.  I find the dough really easy to work with - chilled an hour and rolled in between parchment as suggested.  My only problem is I am useless at decorating - lol.  Highly recommend this recipe for beginners and others alike.

I thought these were really good.  I accidentally put in an entire teaspoon of nutmeg instead of half.  No one seemed to notice!  Cookies had a good, soft texture and never got hard.  I was too lazy to sift the flour...don't know if that made any difference at all.  They still looked adorable and tasted great.

These cookies are great! I used 3/4 cup brown sugar in place of the granulated sugar, Dumped a bunch of cinnamon in ;) added 1/4 teaspoon cardamom and did not have cloves so I put in allspice. I also left the dough in a zip lock bag, in the fridge over night. I did not even get a chance to frost them! I will have to double the batch next time. :)

These turned out okay, I chilled the dough for a couple of days till I could get around to rolling and cutting it out. I cut my gingerbread men thick, about a 1/2" and they baked up nicely. Mine turned out crunchy and I made sure to slightly underbake them, but they were still good...I'm just used to a softer gingerbread cookie. The spice ratio was great, not super spicy but flavorful. A decent gingerbread recipe, but a little too crunchy for my preference, although great if you're looking for a spicy, crunchy gingerbread cookie.

These are pretty good, but the directions are off.  They rise up quite a bit, and take close to 20 minutes to cook through.

This recipe is AMAZING!!  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar and I only used 1 1/2 cups of flour.  The dough  was very easy to handle. At first I was a little nervous to try this recipe because a few people said the dough was mushy, but mine turned out surprisingly well!  These cookies are so soft and have a "melt in your mouth" effect! Yummy!! I'll definately make these again!

After having a family friend try 3 different gingerbread recipes and having no sucess, I tried this recipe exactly and I had no problems and it's one of the best ginger bread cookies i've ever had! Definitly has a spicy taste and all you have to do is sweeten them up with a little icing! Thanks so much for this recipe! You made this easy for someone first time making ginger bread cookies!!

What a wonderful recipe! My husband has NEVER liked gingerbread, but he can't keep his hands off of these.....perfect flavor he says.  I have had numerous compliments this season.  I did, however, add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon vice 1.  I made sure to take them out early enough so they would stay soft.  Will make these every year! Thanks soo much!

This dough is a really great consistency for rolling and cutting.  I didn't have any problems with it sticking to the counter or cracking.  However, I found these to have a very strong molasses taste (which I am not fond of).  I agree with some of the other reviewers who commented that these are not spicy at all - to me the only thing I could taste was the molasses. 
I would make again for ease of using cookie cutters with my daughter, but not to share with other adults.

First time I've ever made Gingerbread Men and this recipe made it pretty easy.  Next time I will do what some suggested and use parchment paper.  Everyone enjoyed them!

Finally, FINALLY I have found the recipe that will make gingerbread just like Mom's! I followed measurements exactly but let the dough chill overnight, and then used the parchment trick suggested by others: roll and cut shapes on parchment paper (I used masking tape to hold it in place on my countertop) and then transfer the paper directly to the cookie sheet; also, after the first roll and the dough section softened, I put parchment on top, in between the rolling pin, and there was no sticking at all. With this trick, I used absolutely NO flour to roll, the cookies cooked exactly as cut and there was no stress. And best of all, they remain soft and wonderfully spiced.
The easiest and best gingerbread recipe I've ever seen!

This is a very good recipe. The cookies are flavorful, easy to roll, and hold up well. I wiil be reusing this one. Will work well for making gingerbread houses. The only changes I made were to add more spice and added lemon zest and a little lemon juice. It gave the dough an irredescent glow.

Oh, for yum! Mine turned out crispy and spicy, like a gingersnap.  I made some modifications:  left out th egg and reduced salt and cloves to 1/4 tsp each.  I think I added an extra half-cup of flour, but I used parchment paper when rolling and baking.  Thanks, Steph, this is a keeper! (Some of the kids think these are too spicy - but they smell wonderful and adults love them.)

These cookies were good, but a little dry. You really have to flour your surface well and flour your rolling pin or they will sick. Decorated they are beautiful, i will definitely make these again

Definitely will keep for next year.

SUPER cookies - my daughter loves them!  I doubled the cinnamon and the ginger!  We like them spicy!  I refrigerated the dough for 4 hours and it rolled out fine with a little extra flour on the board.

These turned out delicious, not blah like many gingerbread men I have eaten. I did half the amount of cloves, and used 3 ounces of molasses instead of four, which seemed to take care of the sticky problem other reviewers had.  A single batch of these makes about 12 5" gingerbread men, so you may want to double or triple the recipe if you are making big ones!

I really enjoy the spices this recipe offers though I did hold back about 1/2 tsp. on the cloves as other's suggested.  The only problem I found was the dough was too dry to roll together.  I fixed this with a couple tsp. of milk.  It rolled out perfectly after that and was very delicious.

Perfect!  I doubled the cinnamon and halved the cloves.  They were soft, tender, and a perfect balance of spices.  I used Smart Balance in place of the margarine.

These cookies had a great flavor - I wouldn't change a thing.   After refridgerating the dough overnight, my dough was very sticky, so I used extra flour liberally when rolling it out.   The cookies still came out perfectly.

I have never tried to make gingerbread cookies before, and although I never cared for them, my grandaughter loves them.  This recipe is fantastic!  Even I like these cookies, and my husband and grandaughter love them.  I followed the recipe, but after reading other comments, added a little extra cinnamon.  They were easy to make and delicious!

These taste wonderful!   My husband was like... Oh my goodness these are fantastic! The flavor is awesome.  The only fault I found is the dough was very sticky and difficult to roll.  I ended up adding a little flour and then they worked out fine.  I worried that this would take from the flavor - but it didn't seem to.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

Pretty good. I used butter instead of margarine. I doubled the recipe, but took it a little easy on the spices, and did not double them (except cinnamon). More like one-and-a-halved them. I thought that would be far too many cloves and nutmeg too. Those spices can really be punchy in too great of quantities. I used the Decorator Frosting from allrecipes for these. A great combo. 
Oh yeah, and they smell really good while baking!!

Awesome spicy cookie! My friends and co-workers devoured them! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great - soft, chewy and spicy. The dough got a little sticky after it had been out of the fridge awhile; just keep it chilled and use a well-floured surface and it'll be fine. Great recipe - will be making again soon!

Like others, I found the title misleading-- these have a nice, but mild spiced flavor. They are not spicy.  Also, I agree that you really should follow the direction to chill the dough, which helps to prevent stickiness.  However, even after chilling, you will probably find that you still need to add several tablespoons of flour while rolling the dough out. I find it very helpful to run a knife or bench-scraper under the dough before cutting the men out.

This was my first time making Gingerbread Men and I could not have asked for them to turn out any better! The only thing I did differently was I followed some other reviewers' advice and only used a teaspoon of the ground cloves. Next time I make them I think I may use the full tablespoon. For the icing, I followed what one reviewer used and did 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1 whipped egg white and a 1/4 tsp. vanilla. I thought it was a little runny but ended up turning out pretty good. All in all, I will definitely make this again!

TOO flavorful for me... I was looking for something a bit sweeter, a bit more cinnamony, but it certainly lives up to its name!

I want to say, though, that even though I worked with small, frozen balls of dough, the dough was still way too sticky for me, so maybe if I had added a lot more flour both my concerns would have been moot.

This was a pretty good recipe, although... I had to add about 1 more cup of flour in order for these little guys to work (this isn't counting the flour I used to roll them out). So once the extra flour was added, the spiciness went way down. So my suggestion would be to add 1 more cup of flour, and possibly double the spices.

This was the first Gingerbread cookie recipe I've ever done.  I was expecting a "hard" cookie, and this turned out to be quite soft.  I also wasn't expecting it to be so "spicy".  I personally did not like the cookie, but my friends and family said that they did so that's why it's getting a 4-start.  Maybe next time I will cook it longer at a lower temp and cut the clove in half...let ya know!

Good--but I had trouble with the dough.  I am living in a really humid area which does not help, but the dough has a slightly crumbly texture that I am not used to seeing.  Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar as well as 1/4 cup white and I doubled the spices with the exception of the cloves.  They cooked beautifully but really difficult to roll out.  Will try again, just instead of putting in the fridge overnight, I may try a short stay in the freezer.

Great recipe! I'm going to fiddle with the spices a little, and they bake in 5 1/2 minutes in my oven.

Spicy? Seriously? I made these for Thanksgiving. I wanted spicy cookies and figured my husband and I could have most of the batch because no one else in the family eats spicy food. Boy did that backfire. One of the grandparents went on at length about how nice I was to make cookies bland enough she could eat - she typically doesn't even eat black pepper because it's too spicy. The mother of our autistic cousin pulled me aside and thanked me for making cookies her son could eat. He always wanted to eat gingerbread men at holidays but could never handle the spice. Several other people commented that they usually hate gingerbread, but these cookies were great. Everyone took some home - which was good, because I did not care for them at all.

These were really good!  Just short of all five stars because the dough was VERY sticky - I ended up adding about another cup of flour.  Thank you for sharing!

We really liked the end result of this recipe but, as previous reviewers have noted, it doesn't make a lot of dough, given the effort that goes into it. I would try and make double next time but suspect the stand mixer would struggle with that much very stiff dough.

I have tried this recipe a few times.  I even got ambitious and made a gingerbread house out of it.  I had the same flour problem.  I entered them in our local 4-H days and they got a red.  Judges said they were too spicy?!? Hello!They did not even read the recipe?!?! However, this is my favorite gingerbread recipe.

These are so yummy!  Seriously, even my ultra-picky 4 year old loves them...she and I cannot stop pinching the dough!  They baked up nice and soft after 8 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper in my book...I've looked for ages for the perfect gingerbread cookie!

These are wonderful.Everything about this recipe is perfect. And I actually had no problem whatsoever with sticky dough. Didn't add extra flour or anything.  These are soft, and have a fantastic flavor that can't be beat anywhere else.  These are a staple around the Christmas Season.

These smell WONDERFUL when they're baking and taste even better! Nice, moist texture too. I used half white sugar and half brown, as well as half molasses and half corn syrup. Thank you for this "keeper" recipe. :-)

This recipe was a huge flop.  I give it a two because the cookies had a good flavor, I should say the 6 cookies I was actually able to make.  I followed the recipe and tried to work with some of the suggestions of those who rated the recipe with 4-5 stars.  The dough was very very soft.  So much so that I had to roll it out between wax paper and freeze it before I could cut out the gingerbread men, and even then I had to work very quickly.  I ended up so frustrated that I threw 75% of the dough away.  Better luck with another recipe.  I had high hopes!  Maybe there will be gingerbread men next year.

I chilled the dough in the freezer for a few hours before I was able to roll it out.  Even then, it was very soft to use cookie cutters.  I ended up taking a small chunk of dough, flatting it with my palm, pressing down the cookie cutter, and peeling carefully and sloowly away the surrounding dough.  It was worth all that work!  They taste great cooked for less time for a softer cookie, or more time for a crisp cookie.

Wow!  Best gingerbread men I have ever had!  They smell sooo good.  Nice complex taste.  Very strong clove flavor, so I might take it down a notch with this ingredient (personal taste).  The dough was a bit sticky.  I used a little bit of flour and parchment paper, but still had to stop 1/2 way to re-chill the dough.  It might be fun to personalize this recipe.  I will make this again.

I made my first batch yesterday and they came out very well. The color and taste of the gingerbread were just right. I had to chill my dough for two hours because it was still soft after the first hour. Today I made another batch and they came out VERY differently. They were lighter in color, and I chilled it for two hours and they were still soft and sticky. I didn't change anything so it's a little strange.

This year me and my mom were baking the christmas cookies for my husband's huge family consisting of a brother, two sisters, a brother-in-law, a future brother-in-law, and one sister-in-law. But that's not all, one of my sisters has 2 kids, my brother has 3 kids, and my husband and I have 2 kids. And last but not least, grandma and grandpa. I don't know what it was about those cookies but everyone must of had at least 3 each. I soooo glad I made 3 dozen!!! I plan to do the same for every year to come!!
                Sincerly,

I can see why people who don't  usually like gingerbread like this because it really doesn't taste like gingerbread! Too spicy, not sweet enough, and the dough was very difficult to work with.

This did make a very delicious cookie. Mine were milder because I had to substitute light corn syrup for molasses, and I used half the cloves because of my picky eaters. I personally would have liked the full amount. My dough was very dry and crumbly, so I added more syrup, which was probably a mistake. My only complaint with these cookies is that even after freezing half the dough overnight and rolling it out just as soon as it was soft enough to roll, using a cookie sheet that was not hot, and working as quickly as possible (not great for an activity with the kids, which is what I originally intended), the cookies still spread enough to make the so-carefully-cut-out shapes all but indiscernible. Probably my fault, not the fault of the recipe. We dipped them in white chocolate sauce, and even my husband, who doesn't like cloves or white chocolate, thought they were divine. I agree with others--the recipe didn't make enough cookies for all the trouble.

I'm not usually a gingerbread fan - I just make them more for the fun of decorating and to give away - but I loved these!  They were perfectly spiced.

Pretty good recipe, makes a nice soft cookie.  I used 1/2 WW Flour, and it didn't make them too heavy.  There are probably better recipes out there, but this is a good basic one.

Excellent!  Best Ever!  Substituted dairy free margarine and 1 1/2 tbsp oil 1 1/2 tbsp water 1 tsp baking powder for the egg (egg allergic).  Better than any recipe I've ever had, including store mixes.  A real keeper.

I am no baker, but following the simple directions (plus comments about using less cloves, more flour, & refrigerating the dough overnight) and I've turned out a perfect cookie that I'd be proud to give away to friends.

Great recipe! I made an army of mini gingerbread men and they came out perfectly at around 6 minutes. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and had no problems with sticky dough.

Seriously addicting! These were awesome!! My husband never cared for gingerbread cookies before but he couldn't stop eating these!! I will never use another recipe again, thank you Eileen! I used butter instead of margarine and did everything else the same. They were super easy to make and the taste is spicy but delicate at the same time. This recipe a fantastic.

definetly not for the faint hearted. A very strong cookie, but once decorate the sweetness of the icing and sprinkles tones it down quite a bit. I tweaked the recipe a bit. I started following it perfectly, but when I took it out of the fridge to roll it was way way way too sticky and moist. I added about a 1 1/2 cup to 2 cups more flour and let it chill overnight. This made it ALOT better and way easier to work with.

I didn't change a thing in these cookies.  I like them very much and so do my kids.  They taste awesome dipped in tea :)

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the dough is very hard to work with.

I will only give it 4 stars because the dough is very sticky. The dough is difficult to work with. I did add more of each of the spices. Overall the recipe is good.

In my opinion, these are the perfect gingerbread men.  They have the strong spicy taste that I was looking for, and they baked up beautifully (I cut them nice and thick because that's the way I like them)!  The dough was also very easy to work with.  My family gobbled them all up before I even had a chance to make any frosting for them!  This is definitely going to be my only gingerbread men recipe from now on!

These are spicy as the recipe states.  Do not make them if you do not want a strong cookie.  I served them at Christmas dinner and my husband's aunt raved about them.

Thanks for this recipe.  I omitted the cloves, only because I don't care for them and the recipe tasted just like good old fashioned gingerbread.  Easy to work with, do cut out cookies with and decorate.  My boys loved them.

Everyone loved these, but I had a hard time rolling out the dough after the recommended hour.  It was much better after chilling overnight, but I still used a lot of flour in the roll-out process.

This gingerbread looked very good but it was the exact opposite with the taste!!!!
I made some for our family party. They were soft and chewy but they were spicy & the molassas just didn't taste right, I would not recommend this recipe.

Excellent!!! I found that I needed to add a little more flour. Also, I only used cinammon and ginger because I didn't have the other spices. However, they ended up excellent! 8 minutes was JUST the right time for moist, fresh cookies!

I mixed these up last night adding 1 tsp of each cinnamon & ginger according to some of the reviews. (We like spice) I found the dough to roll easily. (I rolled on a piece of waxed paper to  limit the stickiness)The only problem is with the timing-maybe my oven is to quick but,after 12 minutes they came out like ginger snaps-good but not soft. I found 8 minutes worked beautifully!

I had the dough in the fridge for 4 hours and still could not get a gingerbread figure to lift off the counter (with a lot of flour) so I ended up making little round cookies and although my husband liked them, I will personally never make them again.

Wow, did I do something wrong or what? Dough was awful and crumbly. Tried adding water and then tried adding flour. Continued adding flour to try to get it to roll without sticking. Cookies were flat and hard after baking. The spice was nice, but I will use another recipe I found here and add more spice to it. Won't make these again.

Excellent cookie recipe.  Stayed chewy for 2 weeks after baking.  Used only half a tsp of cloves.  The "bite" wasn't as strong and made my second batch much more popular with my family.

super yummy cookies! I reduce 1/4 cup of sugar and flour, which I find the dough is much easy to handle (I chill it over night).  I also add some all spieces!! thanks for the recipe ^^

These were yummy! I used butter instead of margarine and left out the ground cloves completely. I also used 1.5 tsp of cinnamon instead because I love the taste of cinnamon.

Theses are wonderful!  I'm not patient enough to roll and cut so I chilled the dough for a bit, scooped teaspoonfuls, flattened and baked.  I may cut down on the molasses next time-- I felt it was a bit strong.  Definitely a keeper!!

The taste of these cookies is good but I had a tough time keeping the dough together.  It turned out a little crumbly, though I admit I used butter flavor Crisco since I didn't have any margarine.  Has anyone tried to make these with butter?

Maybe it was the molasses I used... but when i finished mixing the dough (minus the cloves) I tasted  too strong ! I ended up mixing in a few tablespoons of milk and some brown sugar, and a tsp of vanilla. Toned down the strong molasses flavor big time and they were much better! Baked up great, nice and chewy! Not sure if my result was due to the molasses I bought or not!

Wonderful recipe!  If you're using a regular hand-held mixer, beware - this dough gets very dense.  I like my cookies a little softer, so I shortened the cook time a bit.  Perfect - great flavor!

These were great!  Finally found a gingerbread cookie recipe that was ALMOST like mom's.  The dough worked up great and was very easy to use.  I cooked these for about 8 mins because I like my cookies a little soft and they tasted delicious.  I only gave 4 stars because while they really are yummy, I have had better and I wouldn't call it "the best" recipe.

Only changes I made was to half the cloves and double the cinnamon.  Consistency was fine for rolling...although I need 80 so took the lazy route and scooped level with a #70 small scoop, rolled in sugar and flattened out to 1/4" before baking for nine minutes.  Crisp on the outside edge and just a tad chewy towards the middle, with just the right amount of spice.  Basically a great molasses cookie with some zip!  Thanks Steph!

These cookies taste awesome!  I love the blend of spices--very tasty.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I found the dough to be very sticky when rolling out and I had to add a LOT of extra flour.  Other than that, this recipe is a keeper.

This is a pretty decent recipe, I used a 1 1/2 tsp ginger and cut the cloves by half. I also had a problem of the cookies being salty, but I'm pretty sure that would be remedied by adding the salt to the wet ingredients so it has time to dissolve. I will make these again, good texture and pretty easy to work with.

These weren't what I expected but they were still really good.  My dad says they're the best gingermen he's ever wrapped his lips around.  I think next time I'll play with the spices a little bit and turn my oven up.  I finally had to crank it to 370 after 15 minutes of cooking my first batch.  Also, I didn't find this dough to sticky AT ALL in fact, I had to add a couple tablespoons of warm water just so I could roll it out.

This was my first time making gingerbread and using molasses but it was terrific. The dough smells like molasses but it totally bakes off and you dont taste it at all. This is perfect as is. The dough is sticky but just be patient and use more flour as needed. They actually taste like honey cake a little bit. I frosted with royal icing and they were all gone! Keeper!

These were great - loved the flavor!  I used 1t of cinnamon and 1/2t of nutmeg, per my own taste.  Decorated them with mini m&m's before baking.  Very easy to make also.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted great! Easy to make and cut out! I cut the amount of ground cloves in half as recommended by other reviewers as well.

My husband and mother do not like eating sweets, but they raved over these cookies!  I followed the recipe in my first batch, but the molasses was absolutely overwhelming.  I recommend using half the suggested molasses.

I don't know....I just wasn't thrilled with these.  They were okay, but not great.  I think there is too much ground clove (maybe cut it down to 1/2 a teaspoon).  I don't think I'll be making these again...sorry!!

This is a good "eating" gingerbread(as opposed to a good "building" gingerbread).  A nice dough to work with IF you roll directly on greased cookie sheet, cut out g-men and peel the excess off the pan.  Otherwise your g-men will be mis-shapen.  I added allspisce to the other spices and used equal amounts of each to please my own taste.

Without a doubt, my favorite new cookie recipe. We made ours with fresh ginger instead of dry, and only cooked them for 8 minutes instead of 10. The change enhanced the product for sure!!

Ok, I tried this recipe again thinking that the first time I did something wrong, and seeing how it got good reviews. However, they are just as bad the second time around. WAY TOO sticky. I will not try these a third time!

This is a very easy recipe to follow. I'm usually weary of ginger since I overused it once, but it's very nice in this gingerbread recipe. This was my first time working with molasses and I was thrown off by the almost soy sauce scent of it, but it faded once baked. I'm going to bring these cookies with me to share at a cookie exchange. Thanks!

These were very good. Took them to the college students at church and at the end of the night I only had half a cookie left! Definitely a keeper!

I only got 15 cookies out of this recipe...and they weren't very big or thick.  That was a little disappointing.  Also, the dough was incredibly sticky and difficult to work with.  Be sure to work with small quantities at a time...leave the rest in the fridge!  Complaints aside, these cookies were DELICIOUS!  I just wish I had more of them!

This is the best gingerbread cookie recipe I have found.  The dough was very easy to work with and the cookies turned out looking perfect.  My husband and 16 month old can't get enough.  The cookies had the most wonderful taste, I decided not to ice them.  Instead, I used food coloring markers to decorate them and they look very pretty.

These are SO YUMMY!  I've tried other gingerbread cookie recipes that didn't have enough spice...these are great!  As other reviewers suggested, I cut down on the cloves a little and the cookies tasted wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!!
