So yummy! However, I did add a little kosher salt and some fresh ground pepper to the orange juice and fennel. I was a little worried that the fennel would be to strong - but it was a perfect compliment to the halibut!

I was looking for a recipe to use my grouper and fennel.  In tailoring the recipe, I also didn't have the type of oranges suggested but had some honey tangerines, I DO NOT suggest this.  I would highly suggest to ensure you have the right kind of oranges or use grapefruit instead, the juice was too sweet for the fennel and gave it all an odd taste.

Delicious!  Very tender and flavorful.  The orange and fennel go great together with the Halibut.  We used navel oranges, as that's what the grocery had.  Next time I'd live to try blood oranges.  My wife loved it - subtle, tasty, and not fishy.

Very good.  I only had navel oranges and only had fennel seeds.  While not as beautiful, it was really good.  I made on stove too, using a copper pan with a little butter and orange juice as the base.  This gave a nice caramel to the fish that is sometimes missing if not on the grill.  Came out very nice as a winter dish too.

Tried this recipe, very refreshing and wonderful summertime dish. I added some mini heirloom tomatoes in with the orange and fennel to give it a bit more colour and it turned out great. Would have taken a picture but it didn't stay long on the plate!

The recipe is a good basic one -- I was intrigued by the combination of orange and fennel --  but my family likes more robust flavors than this combination seemed to be, as written in the recipe.  Therefore,  I added some chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 T) instead of the tarragon, about 1 1/2 teaspoons of Sriracha, a light sprinkling of sea salt and lots of ground black pepper.  It was outstanding and just the right balance of flavors to complement, but not overwhelm, the grilled fish.  Another small point--  for ease of serving, I coarsely chopped the orange segments and chopped the fennel rather finely.  It made a really nice, spoonable salsa and preserved every bit of the juicy flavor. I served it separately, as my husband generally insists he doesn't care for "sauces" and I was afraid he wouldn't like it plated over his fish.  To my delight, he certainly loved this salsa -- he kept spooning more  of it over his fish, while exclaiming, "This is REALLY good!" There was none left.  That's a major success in this household. Thus, 4 stars as written; 5 with some minor adjustments .
