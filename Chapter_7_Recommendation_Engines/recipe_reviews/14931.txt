This recipe has been one my family has used for decades!  I have gone to several parties recently and taken this appetizer with me; they are gone in seconds, and I donâ€™t add anything else to the recipe.  The only thing I do different is bake them in the oven at 375 degrees for 20 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.

We have been serving this in our family for decades, but, we marinate the water chestnuts in soy sauce & garlic powder, before wrapping with the bacon.  Much more flavourful.  Give it a try.

Easy, quick and delicious. At our house, when there is only one left there can be quite a battle.

Secret - ADD BROWN SUGAR!  Roll the water chestnut in brown sugar before wrapping the bacon around it.  Hold together with a toothpick.  This adds just a hint of sweet syrup and makes this snack awesome!!!!!!

This receipe is terrific....can change it up by covering the in a mixture of equal parts of ketchup and brown sugar instead of just the brown sugar.  Evyerone raves either way.  Thanks

These are great if you are looking for quick and easy.  However, to make it a 5 star recipe, go the extra mile and try the Bacon Water Chestnut Wraps recipe on this site.  It's kicked up a notch with a great sauce. You gotta love a recipe with 2 ingredients that can be microwaved!

we too have been making them a long time but on ours we use 1/2 cup chili sauce, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup mayo mix together pour over wrapped bacon chestnuts, and bake 350 45 mins . Before I pour sauce on them I microwave them 10 min or so, to give them a head start on cooking. never any leftovers

My mom actually bakes these in the oven around the holiday and I will be making them this sunday for the super bowl.  One thing that adds that I recommend is smothering them in bbq sauce!

This would have been fine but after just a few minutes I had water chestnuts exploding in my microwave. Maybe my microwave oven is too powerful but will bake these in the future. I also think they need a sauce of some type.
