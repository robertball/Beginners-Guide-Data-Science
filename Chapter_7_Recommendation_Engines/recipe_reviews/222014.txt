Yum.  OH!  I made this as a one-dish crockpot recipe and it was delicious.  I used chicken breasts, not tenders, adding them raw to the seasoned tomato sauce mixture and cooking it all on LO for 3.5 hrs (less for tenders).  After adding in the rest and topping with the corn muffin mix, I cooked on HI for 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll add diced onion (1 sm) and 1-2 cloves minced garlic to the tomato sauce mixture, but even as is, this was great, and a keeper.  Thanks for posting!

I made this last night and thought it was great! I added some sauteed ingredients (a large minced onion, corn, chopped mixed bell pepper strips). I also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. I omitted the water and just used the juice from the Ro-Tel can. Lastly, I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but at the end of the day, the basis of this recipe is great. Don't be afraid of the 1 1/2 T of chili powder. I thought it would be quite spicy with that much but it wasn't at all and I added the Ro-Tel too! Don't be afraid to continue what started this recipe in the first place...the pantry raid!

This was easy and delicious. I didn't even  brown the chicken first. Just simmered it with the tomato sauce. My family loved it.

Nicely done, Mama411, and an aptly named recipe! I had most of the ingredients in my pantry, but substituted pinto beans for the black beans, added a can of Mexican-style corn, and used sour cream rather than cream cheese.  It was superb! Cooking the chicken in with the sauce eliminates a pan, too!

This was awesome.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  For me this is pure comfort food; and it is so easy.  I cheated and used shredded rotisserie chicken, light cream cheese and substituted my customized Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe with corn and jalape√±os from this site instead of the cornbread mix.  So it was a super fast dinner.   Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  I actually used leftover turkey instead of the fresh chicken, and didn't bother with the pre-browning.  Also, my local grocery store didn't have cornbread mix, so I used the Homesteader Cornbread recipe from Allrecipes.com, made a half batch, and substituted it for the last three ingredients.  Have I mentioned how much I appreciate this website and all of you contributors and reviewers!

This made a delicious and hearty meal. The only changes that I made were to use 2 cans of chicken, browned with onions and a tsp. minced garlic.  My family loved this one. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe would've been great if I had followed the original recipe.  I followed the review that recommended I cook it in the crock pot.  After 5 hours, it was complete mush!  We dipped tortilla chips in it, but it was a little much to call it a main dish.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.  The flavors were great, but a little sweet.  I may look for a corn bread mix without sugar.

I made this tonight, and I didn't change one thing.  My husband asked for seconds and he is a picky eater. I loved the corn bread topping.

Incredible! This was a last minute recipe that I truly had all the ingredients for and it was delicious! I was a little suspicious about the cream cheese, but just like the author, it was all I had available. Don't skip it--it definitely makes it better! I'm not sure if you can mess this one up. I added the onions and garlic and green peppers, too, and it only added to the flavor. I'd give it more stars if I could!

This was awesome!!! I couldn't figure out what to cook and was looking for something to throw together with what I had. I subbed sour cream for cream cheese. And used 2 cups of cheddar cheese instead of mex style. It turned out great.

Thanks for sharing this very easy and tasty recipe.  Good as is.  Great base recipe and works well with substitutions you find in your pantry or fridge.  Some substitutions that I found to work: Try salsa instead of tomato sauce; pepper jack cheese for cheddar; chili powder, garlic, or other spices if you don't have taco mix; ground beef instead of chicken; chili beans instead of black beans; corn meal using the recipe on the bag (about 3/4-1 cup of corn meal) if you don't have corn muffin mix.

Fantastic casserole! There was nothing left, my picky family of four went back for two and three servings! My modifications:  I used an 11x7 pan, reduced chili powder to 1 TBL and sauteed some chopped onion and garlic and added it to the sauce mixture.  I roasted two chicken breasts and shredded them, mixed them in with the other ingredients.  So good, I'll make this many more times! Thanks for a great recipe.

YUMMY!!  Super easy and super good!  Added canned corn, cilantro and 1/2 jar of salsa and a little extra sour cream.  My Dad (who is super picky) wants me to make the again!  GREAT RECIPE!

Used canned tomatoes as a sub, had no taco seasoning added additional curry powder, salt and cream cheese all on the blender.  Mixed in beans and poured over chicken thighs (skinless, bone in).  Was fast and great.

This had a lot of flavor and my whole family loved it, even without the corn bread topping which I didn't have.  I used chicken breasts and the "Chili Seasoning Mix II" recipe from this site (which is so easy to make and keep on hand, you'll never buy it again) instead of the taco seasoning and chili powder.   I did everything else as stated and added a can of corn along with the black beans.  I use cream cheese or sour cream in red sauces quite a bit, and it really adds a level of richness and cuts down on the acidity. The cream cheese in this dish is a definite plus.  I can't wait to make this with the corn bread topping next time because I know it will be incredible!

I made this last week, simply because I was craving Tex-mex food and I had all the ingredients. I already had cooked chicken, so all I did was chop it up, making the rest of the recipe pretty darned easy. This would also work well with ground chicken, turkey or beef, making it very versatile. 

I don't normally use taco seasoning packets - we make our own sauce using Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce from this site. But, I did have one buried in the pantry - good use for it! I used Jiffy Mix cornbread. I let my son put everything together, and just lightly supervised. We used a 9x13 cake pan, because I didn't have the size listed in the original recipe. 

Well, it was truly tasty! It got a thumbs-up from the entire family. Sadly, there was only a tiny little bit left over, so next time, I might make two pans so we can have some for lunch the rest of the week!  I forgot to take a photo at the beginning, but took one at the end of the meal! LOL 


Thank you for sharing such a quick, tasty meal. 


(PS - I see a few reviews talking about how salty the dish was. I think your answer there is whatever taco seasoning you used. There are many brands that have a very high salt content (it makes the package weigh more). I'd either make your own taco seasoning, or use a good quality brand in the packets. Also saw someone else talk about sour cream-you didn't read it right-this recipe takes CREAM CHEESE.  Amazing how folks give a low rating to something they didn't even make as written. :/

Amazingly delicious!!!  I added a couple of things for a little more veggie content (rotel, frozen corn, can of green chilies) used cream of mushroom instead of tomato juice because that's what I had,  and salt free taco seasoning.  Adjusted for our taste, but no major structural changes.  I love how flexible this recipe is - you could make it spicy, make it mild, whatever you want and it will turn out!  This one is a keeper.

Mine became a Chicken Chili, but it is comfort food and good!  I cooked 2 LARGE chicken breasts in a crock pot (probably 2/3 lbs each) and cooked them under the tomato sauce, Taco seasoning, chili powder, I used broth instead of water and following some of the suggestions in the reviews I added paparika, 1 diced onion, some garlic and a small can of green diced chilies.  I cooked the chicken this way on low for 1 hour and then on high for 2+ more hours.  Chicken turned out perfectly and still moist - I was able to put it on a cutting board and cube it before putting it back in the crock pot.  Once I added the beans I figured I wouldn't be able to fit a good cornbread layer in my small crock pot, so I opted to cook the cornbread in a glass 9x9 in the oven.  This also left me just enough room in the crock pot to add a bit of diced red & yellow peppers and I declared it to be chicken chili.  Wonderful, favorful and hardy.  The Jiff cornbread just took it over the top.  Next time I wouldn't bother with the cream cheese - you can't taste it and I would just serve sour cream and cheese on top.

This was very good, even my husband liked it and he doesn't care for cornbread. I used my mom's recipe for cornbread, and also added some diced onions and peppers as well as frozen corn. We'll definitely have this again.

After making the recipe as written (5 stars), the only change I made was to add chopped jalapeno to the chicken sauce and to the cornbread while mixing.  Really yummy!

I liked it and my husband loved it so much that he asked me to make it 2 more times within a week. My in-laws loved it, too and asked for the recipe. I used rotisserie chicken...all shredded. Used spicy chili beans(but wasn't spicy at all)...added 1 onion and 2 jalepenos. Added 2 TB chili powder and used 1/3-1/2 sour cream instead of cream cheese cause that's what I had at home. I used the "grandmother's buttermilk cornbread" recipe from this site and it was a perfect amount for what this recipe calls for. 9*9 might/can be a bit small depending on what/how much of other things you add but I managed to get all of it fit into that 9*9 pan without making a big mess. It did overflow a bit but I had foil underneath so it was not a big deal. I used sliced cheese(cheddar and colby jack) since I was out of shredded cheese.

Delicious as-is! I have subbed ground chicken many times before, and I like how you really get chicken in every bite that way. Great, easy recipe, with items I usually have on hand (I specifically keep cornbread mix in the pantry just to make this at any moment). May be a little on the spicy side for those not used to having hotter foods, so you can always cut the chili powder in half to still get the flavor without much heat. I recommend doubling the recipe and baking in a 9x13 pan so you have plenty of leftovers to enjoy!

This dish was delicious!  I substituted Neufch√¢tel cheese for the cream cheese, and used reduced-fat (2%) shredded Mexican-style cheese to cut back a few calories.  We were making this for a gluten-free couple, so used gluten-free cornbread mix.  With all of the substitutions, it was still perfect.  We had to drive to our friend's home, so decided we bake it there.  Once I put the chicken in the 9x9 pan, I let it cool for a while, topped it with the cheese and the cornbread mix, and we stuck it in the oven a half hour later.  We had no issues.  We also prepared a second dish, because we didn't know how many would be in attendance.  They ended up freezing that one for later.  It's definitely an easy meal to put together for new parents.

This was so good! My husband had the best reaction: "I have no clue what this is, but it tastes amazing." My 14-month-old son and super picky 2-year-old daughter also devoured it. 

I cooked the chicken with the water, tomato sauce, and seasonings in the slow cooker for a few hours. It shreds so easily and really soaks up the flavors. Turned the heat off before adding beans and cream cheese. Cream cheese can curdle if left in a slow cooker for too long. Then I baked it (as written in steps 4 and 5) with the cornbread mixture & cheese.

Made it vegetarian and added green chilis and red peppers. Only used half of the cream cheese called for and it was perfect. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. I usually do't make any changes the first time I make a recipe just to taste the "original". However, instead of runing to the store for ingredients that I didn't have on hand, I raided my pantry - I used a can of undrained diced tomatoes w/ green chilis (I should have left out the water as the resulting dish was a little "runnier" than the picture). I only had a little over 1 Tbsp of chili powder left (I ended up being glad as it was a little too spicy for me, but my husband loved it). I also had a little refried bean leftover from another dish and threw that in for good measure. Maybe next time I'll add some corn based on some other comments made here. Thanks Mama411

Excellent recipe as is and also a great base for modifications. I recently made with boneless skinless thighs sauteed(with bacon grease) seperately until achieving some good carmelization then shredded\chopped added to the sauce. I sauteed serrono into the same sautee pan after the chicken was done and deglazed with a litlle chicken broth and poured into the sauce. Yummee

This recipe was okay.  I used shredded chicken breast meat & added corn.  I used a box of Jiffy Corn Bread mix, but felt it was too sweet as a topping for this recipe.  A different corn bread mix would be better.

This was great!  Mom and daughter approved. Will make again.

I made it with shredded chicken omitted the cream cheese and used pinto beans--I meant to add corn to the mixture, but forgot. Served with a spinach/tomato salad.  

Best part about this recipe is you can add or omit or replace some ingredients and suit to your own liking and it will still turn out worthwhile. 

Thanks to the original poster for sharing.

Ok, first time I made this, I added to much milk when I was making the corn bread. Possibly, I wasn't reading my directions very clearly. Luckily, I had instant vanilla pudding and added that.....
I've always made my corn bread this way! 
It was delicious!!! 
I've done it both ways now and it's a win win either way I go. My daughter loves it so much, she wanted me to make it for a holiday dish! Lol
Thanks for sharing such a fantastic recipe(:

This was excellent! I made mine in a crock pot, too, and since I didn't have cornbread mix in my pantry I just used the quick recipe on the corn meal carton since I did have all that. This is a great starter with so many options. Thanks!

I have to admit that this review is based on a few minor changes.  I did not add cream cheese because I'm not a cream cheese fan.  I don't know how much chicken I used because I used some leftover baked chicken.  Then I tossed in about half a can of mexi-corn.  I used a 9x7 pan and that seemed to be a good size pan for this.  Will make this again.

Very tasty dish. I did make minor changes--I had a 1/2 red pepper leftover and about 1 serving of corn so I added those.  I also used my own homemade taco seasoning to control the salt.  Next time I may omit the cornbread mix and serve over rice.  I also added some fresh lime juice and cilantro to each serving.

I didn't follow the recipe 100%, just because of personal preference.  I cooked the chicken in the sauce and shredded.  I cut the amount of chili powder to 2 teaspoons, and substituted a can of corn for the beans, because my kids won't eat beans.  Overall, I don't think the changes compromised the integrity of the recipe.  We served with sour cream.  It's definitely a keeper, and can be tailored to your likes.  Next time I'm going to try ground beef!

Very good but I made a few changes for a healthier version. I used 1/4 C Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese, cut cheese to 1/2 C, added 2 C raw baby spinach to the chicken/sauce mixture, used 2 egg whites instead of 1 whole egg, used skim milk.

I have to say that I really had my doubts about this recipe, but decided to give it a shot anyway. This recipe was amazing! I made the recipe exactly as stated and really loved it. It was also really simple to make. I would definitely make this again.

Boy was this delicious!!  I used the breasts from a rotisserie chicken to save time and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  the only change I would make would be to omit the chili powder, there is enough in the taco seasoning. the combination of the filling, cheese and cornbread were perfect.  can't wait to make it again.

This was very good and did, indeed, use things I already had on hand in the pantry. Hearty, filling, tasty meal that would be great in winter.The reason I am not giving it more stars is because it made a HUGE mess. I followed the recipe which uses a pot and 2 pans, 2 bowls, and when simmering it was splattering all over. I HIGHLY recommend using the previous posters suggestion of making this in the CROCKPOT to save on the cleanup times. 

I hate when people change every ingredient and then give a review, but I did exchange the black beans for red and it was very good. Everything else I did as the recipe stated. Next time I would add a little diced onion and probably some corn.

I actually didn't care for this recipe. I made it because of the great reviews, but I thought it was just ok. The only thing I did different was make my own cornbread topping (which was the only part my children liked and ate), and after tasting it I topped it with sour cream (which really helped in my opinion). I would say it was a 3 star recipe, but my husband really liked it so I went ahead and gave it 4 stars.

Just like the recipe title states, I had every single ingredient already in my pantry (though I had to "make" tomato sauce out of tomato paste).  This casserole was amazing!!

This was wonderful! I used a package of taco seasoning for chicken. 1/4 cup of cream cheese is equal to 2 oz, or half a small package. I assembled the casserole ahead, but topped with the corn bread mixture right before baking. Great with a dollop of sour cream!

It calls for a T and a half of chili powder that could be an issue.  It was just plain horrible.  I never leave reviews, I know I should but don‚Äôt take the time.

Pretty good and simple, but a little spicy for the kids. I added a can of rotel, a can of corn and a chopped onion. I will make this again with less chili powder and maybe some black olives too. Good week night meal. A keeper.

I cannot possibly say enough good things about this recipe. It's rich, warm, and pure comfort food. I usually make a double batch in a 9x13 baking pan. This has become a regular part of our recipe rotation--other than summer, when it's too hot to bake a casserole, I make this at least once a month. The best part is that if you use neufchatel cheese and go easy on the shredded cheese, it's much healthier than it tastes! Thank you so much for this recipe!

The first time I made it, it was delicious and tasty.  The second time, I changed it up a bit, adding diced onions, red bell peppers, Mexi-corn (canned),  I added extra cheese, and subbed in Sour Cream instead of the cream cheese, and made jalapeno cornbread to go on top.  It went over amazingly well.  This one will definitely be made again.

Added some lime juice to the saucepan mixture, left off the cornbread, and tossed the cheese with cilantro before spreading over the mixture.  Since I left the cornbread out, just baked it for 8-10 min and then broiled on low for ~5. Also topped with some avocado slices. Absolutely and fantastically delicious!

A most easy and delicious meal for the whole family. I subbed pinto for black beans and sour cream for cream cheese. Also used a gluten-free cornbread mix in lieu of regular mix. Blended like a dream and tasted amazing. Will make again!

Not sure what happened but this didn't work for me.  Would have rated lower but may be user error.  Way too salty, even though no salt was used.

I made this recipe a second time since my family loved it the first time. I used a whole chicken and removed the skin. I boiled it with celery and seasonings then shredded it. I cooked the cornbread according to the package directions which was slightly different than the recipe also added onion and cilantro. Had to double the recipe for my family. It is yum!

This was delicious!  And I love that it included ingredients that I keep on hand.  The only change I made was using chicken breast that I cut into bite sized pieces.  I needed to use a larger pan than 9x9.  It filled it to the top and I was afraid it would boil over in the oven.

It's a success when all 5 in my family love a recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. I went by one of the reviews and used cornbread without any sugar. I chose Martha White Buttermilk Cornbread mix and followed the directions on the bag (no egg and 2/3 c milk). I also baked the dish according to the cornbread instructions - 450 degrees for 18-20 mins. It turned out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a surprise hit!  Everyone loved it.  In true pantry raid style, I had to sub petite diced tomoatoes (I had no tomato sauce) and it turned out great.  I mashed them up to try for a more 'tomato sauce' consistency.  Everything else exactly as written.  I will make this one regularly.

i wanted to add green chiles,corn,etc to this dish,but made as is for my first time and got a thumbs up from everyone.will definitely make again.i like how versatile this can be.if you don't have black beans I think pinto or even kidney would be good.rotel instead of tomato sauce?all kinds of ways you can modify to your own taste.if I have the time I will make homemade cornbread mix next time,though.the boxed stuff is too sweet for this recipe,in my opinion

Awesome recipe!  I added a can of diced, fire-roasted tomatoes and some fresh squash and onion, and I upped the chili powder a bit and added chipotle powder, but otherwise, I kept it exactly the same.  Hubby and I both LOVED it, and I will definitely make it again.

We tried this a couple weeks ago & tonight I tried it with some tweaks.
I had some leftover smoked turkey(1 lb) that I chopped up. Used 1 cup of our favorite salsa instead of the 1st 5 ingredients plus cream cheese with chives.  Then Pinto beans.  for the topping I used a can of creamed corn, 1 egg, 1/4 cup jalapeno cream cheese & a box of Jif corn bread mix. whipped it together the pour over top of turkey & cheese. LOVED IT!! Next time I may add shredded pepperjack.  Happy Cooking....

We made this last night, and since it was "pantry raid" that is what I did, I used 1 can rotel tomatoes and 8 oz can of tomato sauce. i also added 1 drained can of corn. I made my own taco seasonings from a recipe on this site. The rest I pretty much did as written. Husband loved it. such an easy recipe to change to whatever you have on hand. Thanks for sharing it mama411.

I thought it was good, but not great.  My boyfriend liked it all except for the beans (he said he doesn't like the texture, but maybe it's the taste too).  The idea is great, I think I will modify it a bit the next time I make it.  The only thing I didn't add was chili powder because I didn't have any (or couldn't find it).  And the sauce did splatter all over, so I will be more careful with that next time and keep a close eye on it and turn the heat down - it was a pain to clean up.

This recipe is delicious, though I made some slight changes and additions. First, instead of frying the chicken, I just popped a couple chicken breasts covered in foil into the oven at 375 F for about 35 mins, then shredded them. After that, I cut up a small green bell pepper and onion, saut√©ed them and added the chicken and the sauce mix. For the sauce, I omitted the chili powder as I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site, which is quite spicy. To the sauce I added a can corn and a can of red kidney beans (instead of black, as they are not sold where I live). Also cannot find Jiffy mix here, so used a "fake-it" Jiffy mix from a blog called Fake-It Frugal. Had to bake it for about 40 mins altogether. I would definitely like to make this again!

Yummy!  My hubby and I loved it.  I'll definitely be making it again.  I used a 10 ounce can of Rotel in place of the tomato sauce and added another 1/4 cup of water.  Add a bit of sour cream when you serve it and it's delicious!

I made this tonight, with a couple of changes. No sour cream, and out of cornbread.  Instead I used Pillsbury Cresent Rolls to cover the casserole.  And since we have3 teenagers, I also cooked egg noodles to go with it.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the idea. :)

I was scrolling thru recipes looking for pizza crust when I happened across this one that stood out and practically yelled to try it! 
So I did.  I read just a few reviews and found one that added additional ingredients--and I thought it sounded super easy so I gave it a try. I do everything 'to taste'... I used 2 chicken breasts leftover from a rotiss chicken, 1/2 c.minced onion, Rotel tomatoes with the juice, black beans-rinsed, chopped up Anahiems (I had frozen from my garden), chopped green peppers, 2t. Cumin and about 1/3 c. chicken broth along with the original recipe ingredients.  Use the 8x8 pan or you may not have enough cornbread mix to cover well. I also used med. cheddar cheese in place of Mexican cheese-who knew, right? I am the true Mexican food junkie in our home but hubby was a great sport and actually ate his sizable portion! Needless to say--it went over well. Serve with a generous dollop of Sour Cream and sliced avocado on top~ yum! √ú

I made this last night.  The total cook time from start to finish was nice and quick.  I would suggest splash guards for getting the sauce to simmer and then again when adding the sauce to the chicken.  I added a cup and a half of frozen corn at the same time as the black beans.  Also, I used my kitchen-aid to shred the chicken (Really easy, medium setting about 1 minute).  I brought leftovers to work today and might eat it for dinner tonight!!

Yummy dish and it was simple.  I used an 8x8 pan instead of the recommended 9x9 pan, and I already had a pound of cooked chicken breasts.  In a bowl, I mixed the cooked shredded chicken with the other ingredients, and poured it in the pan (without heating first), then topped it with the cheese and cornbread mixture.  The 30 minutes in the oven at 375F was more than enough to thoroughly heat the ingredients.  This was a simple dish, and having the leftover cooked chicken breasts made it very fast to assemble.

This ends up being just pure comfort food for us and it's easy to put together with ingredients that I usually have on hand anyway. Very budget friendly too. I do use the tomatoes with chiles added for a little added flavor and just bring the sauce together at the end when the chicken is done browning and that works great. Doing it that way you can end up only dirtying one dish, yay.

Amazing! I followed the recipe as given, just added some garlic powder and hot sauce to suit our tastes. This dish  is not very impressive in the looks category, but if you can get passed that you will not be disappointed.  I don't know exactly how much chicken or tomato sauce I used ( just had a Ziploc with leftover sauce in the freezer) but watch out- once the corn bread bakes up, my 9x9 pan was VERY close to spilling over.  Loved it with a little sour cream on top. My husband ate so much he didn't even want dessert after!

Delicious, and I can't wait to make it again. I didn't measure perfectly and had used my own taco seasoning, and also had to make the corn bread from scratch since I didn't have a package. I think it's hard to go wrong with this keeper.

This was REALLY good.  I made it with some mashed cannellini beans instead of black beans, and less Chili powder for the kids' sakes.  Very tasty.

This dish has so much flavor I was pleasantly surprised! I didn't use the chili powder because I'm kinda a wimp when it comes to too much spice. I did add some black olives, but that's all I changed. I will definitely be making this again!

This was awesome. And I also did my pantry raid. I had no tomato sauce, so i pureed crushed tomatoes i did not have black beans, so i used refried beans 1/2 cup fat free sour cream. I forgot to put the cheese on top of meat mixture and had to place on top of corn meal mix. Still very good.

This was GREAT. I used it as a base recipe and made the following changes:
1. Sauteed diced white onion, bell peppers, and garlic. Added the sauteed veggies to the saucepan with a can of garlin/onion canned tomatoes (instead of tom sauce) and seasonings, heated through while I did 1.25 lbs of chicken tenderloins.
2. Used an entire block of cream cheese mixed in with the tomato mixture.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9*13" pan. I substituted leftover rotisserie chicken and used canned enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. This way I only used a sprinkle of cumin and garlic powder. DELICIOUS!!

This is a tasty and excellent recipe. I made for the bridge ladies for lunch and they had seconds! I used a layer of rice I cooked in some of the tomato sauce and then layered everything in a casserole dish. I had salsa, sour cream and black olives at the table and served with a salad. Thanks for this easy recipe.

My husband and I loved this, with a couple of minor changes
(1)  I made my own Taco seasoning mix using spices already on hand, intentionally making it extra spicy for my husband.  
(2)  I used two eggs in the cornbread mix.
The problem I will have to address next time I make this is that there is just way too much cornbread for the chicken mixture.  I‚Äôll probably double the meat mixture. Will also try this with ground beef

Excellent and easy. Sometimes I add corn, an extra can of beans and a bottle of Trader Joe‚Äôs Enchilada sauce to stretch and double the recipe because my family goes back for seconds.

This was better than I expected. I think I might make it again, but will make the sauce and chicken in the Crock-Pot and make a separate pan of cornbread to serve with it.

This was so good! The sweetness of the cornbread blended nicely with the filling. The only thing I would change would be to make less cornbread and more filling because it was pretty thick on top. I also didn't use a 9√ó9 inch pan - that would've been way too small. Overall, very different and I was pleased with how it came out!

I LOVE this idea! I did tweak it a bit but it's definitely an excellent base-recipe!
I wanted mine to be more of a true enchilada casserole, so I skipped the cornbread and went for layers of tortillas and cheese (like a Mexican lasagna!).  I also added quite a bit of garlic and onion powder, and a touch of cumin to vamp up the Mexican flavors.  Finally, I also added cilantro and corn to the chicken mixture.  SO GOOD and definitely one of my favorite new weeknight dinners!

I just started cooking about 3 months ago (first Mom, then wife and then I always just "warmed") and of the about 30 different recipes I've tried, following them to the letter I'm not ready to experiment, this has been the best so far.

I love this recipe so much. It‚Äôs easy to modify based on what canned ingredients you have on hand, and it reheats just as good as fresh out of the oven. My husband requests it all the time. It definitely has a regular rotation in our house.

I really liked this recipe. It's gluten free which is great for me, and it tastes like comfort food. I have made this several times and each time I add a different little twist. This recipe is versatile and aptly named. There are so many different things to change this recipe for variety. I have used both chicken and ground beef. Added corn, olives, green chilies, substituted salsa for tomato sauce. The options are almost endless. Thanks for sharing this recipe and inspiring some quick comfort food.

Loved it....Made as recipe states. Tomato sauce was homemade and used chicken thighs. Will leave off the cornbread topping. Maybe cooked too long but it was crunchy and not required.  To be more "authentic" may incorporate a tortilla. But the casserole itself was delicious!!!

This is really tasty! I followed the recipe exactly until I put the cornbread batter over the sauce and cheese. I didn't have a 9x9 inch pan, so I used a 8 1/2 x 11 pan, and one box of cornbread mix wasn't enough to cover all the sauce. I was afraid there was too much sauce even for the larger pan, and with two packages of cornbread mix, I thought I would have to clean the oven! But the cornbread absorbed a lot of the liquid. I'd like to make it again, and try ground beef. I'll also add some green chilies.

This dish was soooo delish! My husband‚Äôs first thought when he woke up the next morning was, ‚Äú babe! Dinner last night was the s***!‚Äù. The only ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù I made was that I used sweet cornbread mix to balance out the chili powder. This will become a staple in my house.

I used more cream cheese, prob 1/3 c, slightly less tomato sauce -by 1/2c and would prob cut down on the taco seasoning next time to half a packet. It's a forgiving recipe to experiment with.  I can see adding grilled corn, onion, peppers etc.    Very good!

This one's a keeper--indeed, great comfort food.  This one also makes a lot, so share with guests and more family, so go large on the baking dish and be prepared to add more cheese(s).  I used Mexican, sharp cheddar AND shredded pepper jack cheeses.   I merely added a can of pinto beans with the black beans. The cornbread mixture: Added generous dashes of cilantro, chipotle black pepper and Green Tabasco.  The "chicken mixture": Added generous pinches of paprika, cilantro and Tabasco Smoked Chipotle--with a lot of taste tests when I smooth blended the cream cheese ( my tastes had me add more than 1/4 cup of it ).  And the chicken: I browned whole chicken breasts and thick diced them; worked out really well.  I can see marinating them in extra batches of the sauce a couple  of hours ; an idea worth trying, I think.  Easily feeds a family of 4---with a guest or two; do enjoy!!

I really try, as much as possible, to adhere to the original recipe the first time out so as to give it a fair shot and later, an accurate review.
That said, I did not have the corn bread mix -nor any corn meal- on hand but did have the small fajita-style flour tortillas, so that part of the recipe differed from the original.
Additionally, I used boneless-skinless chicken thighs from the freezer which I had marinated with Italian dressing...however, not to worry! This only added to the AMAZING flavor in the filling!
I also substituted jarred salsa for the tomato sauce, with extra tasty results. (Out of tomato sauce this night)...
The remainder of the recipe was followed pretty closely and this is definitely a keeper! 
Everyone loved this meal and next time I plan to serve alongside a southwestern side salad for extra flavor and texture.
Four chicken thighs, shredded; along with the other listed ingredients yielded enough filling for 15 fajita-size (along the lines of a soft-taco, in size) enchiladas which were lightly topped with additional salsa and shredded mild cheddar cheese... Again, these were ingredients that I had on hand, so I was pleased to make good use.
Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!
As you can see, it has served to inspire the sharing of many delicious meals... That has to be a great feeling! :-)

Yes we loved it, the sweetness of the cornbread and the creaminess of the chicken and beans. Made it twice, doubling the recipe each time. Delicious and easy!

I loved it. I followed the basic recipe, except I baked it in a cast iron pan. I lined the bottom with crumbled tortilla chips, as I wasn't sure if it would stick. It came right out. I used low sodium tomato sauce & taco seasoning, and rotisserie chicken. I also added a little salsa verde to the chicken mixture. It was the perfect heat level. I used Jiffy corn muffin mix, I know some people don't like it because it's sweet, but I liked the sweetness against the spiciness of the chicken. I was very easy to make, I'll definitely make it again.

Instead of making the sauce I used a can of El Paso enchilada sauce, AND  a can of corn as well as the beans.... it was delicious!! I made flan and that was nice with it! It was so easy.

Followed the recipe exactly as written & it was delicious! My husband said numerous times it is a winner. Think next time I may try using two large cans of chicken breast, just to make it even quicker.

I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of diced tomatoes, chili ready, and homemade taco seasoning mix on this site. Everything else was as listed in the ingredients. This dish was amazingly delicious.  It fed my family of four with no leftovers and they all loved it.  I will be making this again but I think I may double the recipe next time and add more chicken.

Ok I didn‚Äôt put the cornbread on it but did make it on the side to put in it. Not jiffy as everyone said to sweet but grocery store brand. Doubled the recipe and used rotel not tomato sauce (3 cans), a jar of pace salsa, no water, and one and a half packs of taco seasoning. Topped with Mexican cheese. Crazy good. I‚Äôll make this one again soon

It turned out well. I made it for a church potluck and it was appreciated by all. I added chopped onion and minced garlic. Since I doubled the chicken I also added another can of beans - pintos with jalape√±os, a can of Rotel tomatoes, and a can of white corn. I also added another 8 oz can of tomato sauce and some extra chili powder. It was definitely spicy!

Wife avoids gluten.  Used GF Taco seasoning packet, and GF honey flavored corn meal mix instead.  Also, pulled chicken apart before putting them in sauce...less mess.   Otherwise, straight recipe.  The littl e sweet flavor from the cornbread mix was great.

I used a Jet oven to brown the meat with onions that I added to the recipe.  Then I switched the Jet oven to slow cook and added several cloves of garlic and diced fresh jalapeno. When it came time to add the cream cheese, I skipped the corn bread mix and added diced up corn tortillas. There were no leftovers.

Very tasty! BUT my corn bread did not cook well in the middle. I made this ahead and had my daughter mix up the batter and pop it in the oven. Avoid this issue by putting the batter on when the other ingredients are hot. As for my family we will bake the cornbread separately. Simply because that‚Äôs how we prefer it. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and quite delicious.  I made this pretty much as directed since I did not have tomato sauce used seasoned chopped tomatoes and it was great. You could easily add ingredients you like to this base.  Canned green chilies would be great or even corn.

I did not shred the chicken but otherwise followed the recipe  to a T.  It was good the first night and I would probably shred the chicken next time to see if there's any major difference. I would suggest adding more cornbread, maybe doubling it, but we like cornbread. I would not recommend this reheated from leftovers though...it does not fare well.

I liked it, hubby not so much.  Added can of corn and some tomatoes with green chilis.  Hubby would have liked better without the chili powder but more heat/spice.

A little heavy but really good.   I shredded left over chicken.  Since the chicken was cooked,  (not sure it was necessary)  I heated up all the ingredients and mixed in the cold chicken at the end, before placing in the oven.  I served the casserole with salsa and sour cream.

I made this for my family tonight and it was delicious! I've never had anything like it. The corn bread and the cream cheese in the sauce really made it for me.

This was good and I did have everything on hand already - big plus! Next time I‚Äôll make the cornbread separately so I can control the proportions. The box I had made a huge layer compared to the meat mixture and was also sweet- not my preference to go with this dish.

This is one of the best casserole recipes I've made.i followed recipe, however, I shredded breast meat from a Costco rotisserie chicken and used just 3/4T chili powder. Turned out delicious! The leftovers were also very good!   My boyfriend loved it. Me, too! Will definitely make again

Wow!! This turned out so good! I did change a few things, based on what I had on hand, (it is a pantry raid recipe) and used canned venison, enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce, and the West Tennessee cornbread recipe for the topping, as I only had cornmeal. I also saut√©ed onions & garlic & added that to the meat mixture, topped that with a little cheddar, then the cornbread mixture & the whole family gobbled it up. I was planning on eating light tonight, but had thirds, whoops!! Very good recipe, thanks! I will have to try it when I have chicken!

3rd or 4th time making this and this is what I do. I first followed recipe. After that, this is what I change. You technically don‚Äôt need to shred the chicken just cut up and saut√© small pieces. Add to recipe one can of corn and one can of diced tomatoes. I use a homemade taco seasoning from Allrecipes so I used that verse a packet. Cream cheese is a weird thing I think to add into the sauce so I add sour cream like most people would do eat with other dishes like tacos burritos etc. and I serve over rice and just skip making cornbread based off of my preference. It is a really good base recipe, just add corn, tomatoes, and use sour cream verse cream cheese. It is good reheated also. My husband isn‚Äôt a fan, but more for me. Also if you wanted to add onions and green peppers that would be good too.

Followed directions and it was very good.  I used a Costco chicken instead and just simmered it in the tomato sauce for 30 minutes.  Kids loved it. Will definitely make again.

Ok guys please don't get mad with me about this but I made some changes to this recipe. I used light red kidney beans instead of black beans, I add onion chopped fine, and I changed to cornbread mix to a biscuit mix. oh I also changed the water to chicken broth.  I will let you guys know later how it turned out. I have two children that don't eat black beans, and one that does not eat corn bread.

This turned out amazing! Although it definitely took way longer to prepare than the hour estimated, but it was delicious. I used more like 1.5 lbs of chicken tenderloins and a 13x9" pan, expecting leftovers when I made it for my Mom and younger brother. But nope, we devoured it all! Planning to make it again for the holidays as a side.

EDIT: made it again 2x since my original review! Still amazing, quickly becoming a family favorite

Love this recipe. have made it many times and there are so many ways to change it up. instead of tomato sauce and water, use 1 can rotel and I jar taco sauce. I usually dice up half an onion and 2 belk peppers, 1 green, 1 red, about tsp of minced garlic saute til almost soft. Cook the chicken breast whole in the sauce for about 20 min on simmer then remove and shred, mix it all back together. also found that adding drained fried corn or corn with peppers is great addition. really gives the feel of an enchilada but in a casserole. family loves this and have shared this recipe with many friends.

We love this recipe just the way it's written.  If you like a little extra kick, you could add some diced jalapeno.  We've also made the chicken in the slow cooker, and used it as filling for burritos and tacos.

I was so skeptical when I was making this, but it was delicious! I followed the recipe, and will make it again the same way next time. I only had an 8x8 pan, and it took about 10-15 extra minutes to cook before the topping was done in the middle.

I made this exactly as written except I added 1 small onion and 1 tsp of garlic to the sauce. I also diced up a little bit of jalapeno and put it in the cornbread. I took it to the Fire Dept and everyone absolutely loved it. Delicious!!!!! You'd think it would just taste like tacos but it doesn't. I was able to fit all of it in an 8x8  just in case you don't have a 9 x 9.

There were a lot of steps to the recipe as written, but it was worth it. I substituted marinara sauce because I didn't have tomato sauce in my pantry. My teenager enjoyed it even though it had spices and beans!  I served it with baby spinach and called it a balanced meal!

These are really notes for myself instead of a review. I didn't measure very carefully so next time I would add more cream cheese and more shredded cheese. I would also cut back on the chili powder and add add some cumin, bell peppers, garlic, onion and substitute diced tomatoes for at least some of the tomato sauce.

Loved this!  I saved the extra pan and cooked the chicken in the sauce. I also added a can of corn and tomatoes with green chilis. It was a hit- thanks for sharing!

I used can cream of chicken, can of enchilada sauce, rotisserie chicken, can pinto beans, (out of black beans) fire roasted corn, small can sliced olives, 1/3 block cream cheese (cubed) 4 tbs salsa, shredded pepper jack cheese, cumin, chili powder, garlic, mixed and heated until bubbly at edges, then topped with jiffy corn bread, mixed as directed. Finished cooking 15 minutes until corn bread done. I figured since corn bread only takes 15-20 minutes I should get the other ingredients hot first, it turned out Perfect! I love making casseroles but, so many turn out good but, not great, this one is on our Great List, I will make again and again, it was that good.

Pretty good casserole that was easy to make and enjoyed by the whole family. I served it with shredded lettuce, pico, and sour cream. If I make it again, I will choose a less sweet cornbread mix.

Cooked it on Boys Scout ousting this weekend in a Dutch oven. Everyone said it was a keeper. I added some corn and green chile's to the chicken and corn bread along with some cheese to the corn bread to make a Mexican style corn bread. It took about 15 minutes longer to cook (need to look at how it did the coals), but worth the wait.  The recipe as written works well with a 10 inch Dutch oven.

I followed some of the suggestions from others and it was wonderful. I think even without  any changes this would be excellent. I took a chance and made it for the first time for company and it turned out great. It's a keeper. Thanks

This recipe was super easy. I used skinless chicken breasts and added corn   I was short on Chili powder so I added a little extra taco seasoning ( not packaged)   The corn bread added an extra  yummy factor my husband loved it as did I. This will definitely go into the go to recipe rotation

This recipe was great!! My husband and my son loved it (clean plate)! The only things I did different was that I used half the amount of tomato sauce (pretty much 8 oz instead of 15 oz) because we aren't fans of too much sauce in any of our food and the other thing I did different was the cornbread... I made my own from corn meal (you get to control how much sweetness you want in your corn bread). And that's all that I did different! We loved it and I will definitely do it again!

I used pinto beans instead of black beans. Also split cornbread and put half on the bottom and half on top. To speed it up, you could use canned chicken.

This is a good recipe.  Even the non- enchilada people in my family cleaned their plates. I had all the ingredients and I found this recipe a good way to use them. I made a mistake and put the cheese on top of the cornbread, but it turned out ok. I think if I put the cheese first and the cornbread batter on top of it the cheese would have melted and the cornmeal would have risen more.  I'll make it again

I made this recipe tonight and it was yummy! I think it would've been better using shredded chicken as the recipe states instead of diced chicken like I used. I also think I'll add canned corn to the filling next time and see how it is!

Good flavor! It seemed to make too much sauce as written. Maybe I'd skip the water added to the sauce or reduce the tomato sauce. Also I feel that this could have used more meat/bean/veggie filling to offset the puffy cornbread topping. I used a Marie Callender mix- which tasted fine. I plan to try it again. I'm sure this would be good with ground beef too. This recipe reminds me of Bisquick's cheeseburger pie which is part of the appeal for me.

This is an easy recipe resulting in a very tasty dinner.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly except for adding a small (about 7 oz) can of whole kernel corn.  My wife and I liked it a lot and will make it again.  Well worth trying.

We didn't like this as a casserole, but in an attempt to not waste food, we pulled it out and used it as a spread on crackers and chips (a kind of thick dip) without the cornbread topping..  We think it is great that way and have made it several times using rotisserie chicken to shorten the prep time and passed it around to friends.  They also love it.

Instead of combining and simmering the tomato sauce mixture in another pan, I just added all the ingredients to the chicken along with the beans and cream cheese. It simmered for a few minutes.

Family loved it!  Just need to remember to add it to the "rotation" and do it again.  Didn't have cornbread mix, so I made a half-batch from scratch. Didn't have tomato sauce (no idea why not), but used a can of tomato paste and 3 cans of water.  Added a can of corn, just b/c I felt it was needed, the only "real" change to the original recipe. Thanks for the easy dinner!

Well....3 of us ate the whole thing.  Granted, two of my 'customers' were big-appetite men but if it was not delicious, they would not have snarfed it down.  Interesting twist on enchiladas (and easier!).  The corn bread really makes it.  I did add onions and sprinkled chili powder on top for a nice presentation but other than that followed recipe. A keeper.

I used ground deer and added one can of corn in addition to the ingredients. I also used the hot taco seasoning for a little extra spice.  My husband loved it and he's pretty picky.  It was good the next day too!

This was AMAZING. I did make a couple changes due to food allergies and some preference. I made my own taco seasoning, and used dairy free shredded cheddar style and pepper jack style cheeses and dairy free cream cheese. I also added a small can of green Chili's and olives. Great with or without sour cream added on plate.

Not many recipes are easy weeknight meals, worth 5 stars, and make it in to our regular rotation but this one does!!! So good plus my husband loves it, and it makes good leftovers for lunch the next day. I probably make this at least once a month.

Made this for dinner and the family devoured it! Followed the suggestions of others and added a tsp of cumin and a layer of grated cheese between the mixture and the cornbread and it rocked! First time using gluten-free cornbread (I was skeptical) and it worked out perfectly. I'll be making it again.

LOVED it! I added green peppers and next time I'll add corn. This was wonderful, definitely need to make again. I didn't have enough tomato sauce, so I used an 8 oz can of sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes with its juice. I still added the water, but that made it runny, so I won't add it next time.

I really like this recipe it reminds me of a recipe my mother use to prepare for us when we were children. She use to prepare her favorite sirloin chili w/beans. She would top with Monterey jack & cheddar cheese. Then add the cornbread mix on the top like you do in your recipe. She usually serve it with a green salad & chill Sangria. Yum!

OMG....the casserole was gone in minutes.  Everyone loved it.  Made it almost as iis...except I have a very mild palate so I only used half the amount of chili powder.   I also added a cup of Mexican corn.  Will make this again very soon.  DELICIOUS!

This has quickly become one of my favorite recipes. I double it, use a 9x13 and we eat it for 2 nights. Excellent as is, no substitutions or adjustments needed.

Loved the recipe but made a change to the corn bread mix.  Mine was a 12 oz. Glutino so I cut it in half and followed the half of the recipe on the box.  Also made 4 servings.

I liked it a lot. made it again and I had no cream cheese. I used some heavy cream and a little half in half and a Mexican blend cheese. Also used jiffy corn bread mix. (need two) just double the milk and eggs. Also used left over turkey.  so I did not have to cook the meat. quicker. Yum. A little sour cream on top is also good

My husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe and I'm not even a cornbread person so this was an experiment for me. It was pretty easy to make too and sooooo good as left overs the next day, tasted even better! The only changes I made to it because I'm not a person who likes too much spice and was a little nervous about the Chili Powder was instead of the 1 1/2 tablespoons of Chili Powder I only did 1 tablespoon which was perfect, just the right amount of bite to it. Were also cheese lovers as well so we added more cheese. Instead of 1 cup we did 1 1/2 cups of cheese. Overall we would definitely make this recipe again. May even add different things to it next time too like onions, etc. Our only complaint my husband and I had was the cornbread on top was very thick so the bad thing was you most of the time you tasted the cornbread. I would of liked a thinner layer of it on top, but it had a really crunchy taste to it which we liked. It could of been the brand of cornbread mix we used as well though.

This was excellent!  Even my picky kids ate it!  I used a recipe for Excellent and Healthy Cornbread to top it with instead of a boxed mix, so it would be gluten free. I did use cubed chicken breasts instead of the tenderloins.  Thanks for the easy to make recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was I added a can of creamed corn to the Jiffy corn mix before I topped the chicken. It made for a delicious and creamy crust.

I loved this recipe! The only thing that I would change is using a little bit less cornbread. Other than that, it's perfect and makes the best leftovers.

This was delicious!!  We added finely diced red pepper, green pepper, onion, and rotel to add some hidden veggies, and swapped out plain Greek yogurt for cream cheese to lower fat content.  Served it with avocado, and it was yummy!  My five year old liked to chop up the cornbread part and mix it all together!  The only g-free cornbread mix we could find was 12oz, so we added the 1 egg but increased the milk to 1 and a third cup, plus used a bigger pan to make it the right consistency and size!

OK this is simply AWESOME!, I searched the web for a chicken dish that involved cornbread and after making this tonight im convinced theres now WAY she just "THREW" this together. and if im wrong, open a restaurant NOW! yes it may seem im overselling it but im not. I added a couple of tbls of ranch dressing to the sauce but other than that, made no other alterations. thank you!

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly this time. Next time I'm going to adapt it a bit. Hubby and I can't take a lot of spicyness (actually our tummys rebel) and while this is not bad spicy I want to take it down a notch and add some corn and onions.

My hubby says this is the best recipe I've made him so far. The only modifications I made were adding 2 tbs corn kernels to the corn muffin mix and adding 2 sprigs freshly chopped cilantro. Very yummy, will make again.

We really loved this recipe! I did have to make some changes due to what I had on hand. Instead of tenderloins I used three large chicken breasts. I cut them into cubes, browned them, then added the tomato sauce and spices. I cut the chili powder back to 1 teaspoon, due to personal preference. I completely skipped shredding the chicken (which saved me a step, and wasn't necessary since I had already cut the chicken in cubes). I had to use dark red kidney beans instead of black beans and cheddar cheese instead of the Mexican blend. I didn't have a 9X9 pan either, so I used a 9X13 pan. I doubled the cornbread topping, due to the larger size of my casserole, and it worked out well. I will be making this again! Thanks!

We really liked the recipe but disliked having the cornbread on top.  Update: I made it again and omitted the corn bread, added a cup of frozen corn, and had a thin layer broken corn chips on the bottom.  EXCELLENTE!

Used leftover rotisserie chicken, added sauteed onion, corn and used pinto beans in place of the black beans. Topped with cilantro and fresh jalapenos when it was served.

I thought this was great.  We've tried Mexican casseroles and never been too impressed. I was looking for a way to use up leftover baked chicken and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did!

I did decrease the amount of chili powder for the kids and added a small can of corn (drained).   Then I baked in a 9x11 dish because I didn't think it'd fit in the 9x9.   It was delicious and a hit for us as well as our 2 & 4 yr old!

I didn't have everything, but it's very flexible.  I had to make my own cornbread used a buttermilk one off this site, then no taco seasoning just used the liquid in the beans and added Mexican oregano with the chili powder and it still came out yummy.

Way too salty!  Not sure what I did wrong.  Followed directions exactly and could barely eat it.  Would recommend cutting taco seasoning in half as that's probably the culprit since the recipe does not call for salt alone.   Maybe adding some rice would even out the saltiness.  Wow was it ever salty!  Reading the reviews, I don't see that anyone else had this problem so I'm not sure what happened to mine.  :(

This was easy and super good! True to it's name, I also raided my pantry to make it, of course I didn't have everything exactly as called for but it was very easy to make substitutes and turned out great.

I really expected to like this but it was very disappointing. The flavor was overwhelmingly chili powder; you really couldn't taste the chicken or beans or cheese. I think the concept is good - but this recipe still needs work.

Anything my kids eat is a winner with me!  I was in a hurry, so didn't put the cornbread mix on top, but did add in a cup of cooked brown rice.  I had boneless chicken breasts, so used them instead of tenderloins.  Very tasty.

This was DELISH! My husband loved it! Best comfort food I have made in a long time.  Only change I made was to use vegetable stock instead of water and I combined sharp cheddar cheese with the Mexican-syle cheese blend. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe doesnt make the most beautiful presentation on the plate, but boy is it delicious. My husband didn't want to eat it at first because he said it looked like "mush", but once he tried it he couldnt put his fork down. I made the recipe as is the first time around and it was absolutely delicious. But my husband and I prefer beef so I used taco meat the next time and it was even more amazing!I also omitted the tomato sauce and added a can of rotel tomatos. The corn bread topping is such a brilliant idea. This recipe is impossible to screw up and its so easy to modify according to your family's taste. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I made this last night, following the recipe, and adding corn as others had suggested. My partner asked me to add curry powder to the sauce as well - It was amazing! We went back for seconds and we rarely do! The spice was just right, and the cornbread was such a treat. I think next time I will try the lo-cal version with the yogurt and skim milk :)

The corn bread on the top was a great change from using tortillas.  Next time I might add corn to the mix; it was fine without it but I thought it seemed missing. Family loved it just as is though!

It's easy and tasty. I usually keep some shredded chicken on hand in the freezer, but that's the only adjustment I've made in the handful of times I've made this recipe.

bummer. I didn't like this at all. The taste of the tomato sauce and taco seasoning just did not taste good to me, and didn't blend with the chicken at all. Won't be using this again:(

We loved it, but if your family is more than two people, double it. It was perfect size dinner for two, with enough left overs for one.

I am going to try this with a package of Mexican cornbread mix.  Since it has peppers
And spices in it, I think it would add to the recipe !

This is fabulous!,  I used chicken breasts and saut√©ed them in onions and garlic, but I could easily use canned chicken in a pinch. Great easy dinner recipe.

I make this often.  My husband loves it!  You can use cooked, rotisserie, or grilled chicken.  I like to use the mild taco seasoning so it's not quite so spicy.  It's a keeper!

This was very good but next time I'll double the meat mixture as it was all corned bread. I didn't have Jiffy mix so made a recipe off the bag. I also put it in a 9 x 13 pan. Will make another time.

this was good! i was concerned that the underside of the corn bread topping may be slimy (as happens with doughy topping sometimes) but the happily the cornbread made a nice crunchy crust and the cheese was melted to it. my husband kept nibbling at the cornbread part! in true "Pantry Raid" style i made up my own sauce with the taco seasoning, water, salsa and some tomato paste cuz that's what i had. i also tossed in some leftover rice and used sharp cheddar cheese. i will make this again. thanks for sharing.

The whole family LOVES this recipe, and it is a great way to use leftover roast chicken. Just shred the leftover chicken into the sauce
as you would the cooked tenderloins.

I made the corn bread from scratch...it came out awesome...but I would double the meat mixture for the amount of cornbread the scratch recipe gives.
I'm making it tonight with left over turkey from Thanksgiving and adding some veggies too.

Made this tonight.  Added a can of drained corn and 1 can of drained fire roasted tomatoes with garlic.  Used my own taco seasoning since I make my own.  Didn't add water and used a roasted chicken breast that I shredded. Also added a little bit of the juice from my jar of pickled jalapenos for some heat. This was very very good.  Love the fact that you can tailor this to your tastes. Could easily be made with ground beef as well.  Add what you like.  Delicious, would definitely make again!!

This is great as a dip. I used refried beans instead of black beans.  Will make again without the cornbread, as an appetizer.

My husband wasn't the biggest fan so I've been working on it since I made it. I would have added more cooked onions and peppers and spread out the corn bread a bit more.

Really yummy!  I cut down the amount of chili powder to make it more kid friendly and used my favorite home-made cornbread batter (Buttery Corn Bread from this site) instead of a mix.  I don't know if it was because I used a homemade cornbread, but it took much longer to bake than 1/2 hr.  I ended up raising the temp to 400, cutting slits in the cornbread topping to let the heat in better, and covering it since it was getting too brown on top.

Excellent. My entire family loved it. I have made someting similar to it with a polenta topping before. The cornbread was much better. The only things I changed were that I added diced oninon, corn and rotel and to the sauce mixture but did not add any water. I added cliantro and substituted sour cream for the cream cheese. I poached my chicken then shredded it before adding all of the sauce and bean mixture. Then I topped it with cheese and put in the fridge to bake later the same day. Added the corn bread topping just before baking.

made this with a couple tweaks and the whole family enjoyed! I did a can of enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, no water, quesadilla seasoning instead of taco, no beans (husband doesn't care for them although I'm sure it would have been great with them), and a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles (wanted to try the Rotel tom&chile but didn't have them on hand). I also used 2 large cans of canned chicken because we had just gotten home from out of town and I didn't have any chicken thawed for this. Some chopped garlic and a sprinkle of cumin and this dish was good. I didn't know how I'd feel about the corn bread topping but it gave it a nice contrasting sweet flavor. Definitely a make again, although I might add some brown rice in the mix to thicken it up a bit since we don't use the beans.

This was good!  I used canned chicken because I was in a hurry, and it tasted fine.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't think it tasted much like enchilada, though....more like chili and cornbread casserole, but that's ok because it was yummy!

OMG, this was sooooooooo good! I left out the chili powder because all I had was hot tomato sauce and I didnt want to burn our mouths. I also used cream cheese that had onions in it (all I had), but it worked out great! You will not be sorry if you try this recipe. It is fabulous!

Oh man this was soooo good and oh so easy to make. I have a few picky eaters in my family so they were weary about the corn bread mix on the top but when I went for leftovers the next day it was all gone! Instead of the classic corn bread I used chi chi's sweet corn cake and it was awesome! I'm definitley saving this recipe to my box!
