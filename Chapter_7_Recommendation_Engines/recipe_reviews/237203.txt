I made it in my Instant Pot using frozen thighs.  I added the other ingredients and pressure cooked for 15 minutes; then manually released; added cream.  Very tasty sauce and tender and moist chicken.

This sauce was sooo delicious!  Restaurant quality!  Served with asparagus instead of fettuccine (the sauce even tastes great over the asparagus).  The only change I made was that I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2.   I recommend starting the sauce well before the chicken, it takes a long time to thicken.  I will definitely make this again!    :)

The dish was quite bland.  I should have followed other recommendations and added more garlic and spices.  The sauce was boring and I tried to salvage the dish with Parmesan cheese, which helped a tad.   I donâ€™t think I will make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I added about 6 cloves of garlic and served with bow tie pasta and a side of asparagus. This would be good over rice or just with fresh string beans or asparagus.  As the other reviewer said, I might add some more spice too. I wish I used the whole 12 oz jar of peppers. Next time. Enjoy!  And thanks!!

So yummy! Next time I  am going to add a bit of cayenne to give it a bit of spice.
