I have made this recipe for 35 years but we moved this past summer and I lost my recipe box.  I was so happy to find it again.  This fruitcake is meant to be solid fruit and nuts, so DON'T double the batter.  Try this instead:  Sift together the dry ingredients. I use kitchen scissors to cut the dates and cut them into a very large bowl (I sometimes use a large roasting pan).  Then take about a half cup of the flour mixture and sift it over the dates.  Toss the dates to coat each piece with flour.  Repeat for the pineapple, the cherries, and the pecans.  By now all the fruit and nuts should be mixed together and coated with flour.
Now wisk the sugar, eggs, and vanilla together and then pour it as evenly as possible over the fruit and nuts.  You can try using two spoons to mix it all together, but I quickly switch to my clean hands and work the sticky stuff throughly to dampen all the flour.  When throughly mixed take it up by the handful and pack it into the loaf pans.  Pack it in so there are no gaps among the the ingredients.  Bake, cool, cut thinly, and enjoy!  (You can add liqour after it is baked by wrapping the cake in cheese cloth, soak throughly with your favorite liquor and store it in an air-tight container until ready to serve.)

I really like this recipe.  It is extremely tasty without any alcohol.  I did make two changes however.  I used 1 lb pecans and 1 lb walnuts. I also doubled the batter.  Otherwise this recipe came out perfect.

Excellent recipe, except it omits adding the pecans.  Adding them with the fruit produces the desired results.

Not my Grandmother's Fruitcake but soooo close.  Have been looking for a recipe like this since we lost her recipe years ago.  Kept the amount of fruit the same by weight but made the mixture of candied mixed fruit,candied cherries, candied pineapple,dates and raisins.  Slightly chop the nuts....Mix half the flour with the fruits.  This will keep fruit from sticking together.  Add fruit and nuts last.  Please don't double the batter.  THIS IS FRUITCAKE, not cake with fruit.

Thanks to Clinicalhynopsis for the tip to half the batter. Just too much pecans and dried fruits/dates for that amount of batter stated in the recipe. Using the amount of batter specified, I halved the cherries, pineapples, pecans and replaced the dates with mixed fruits. This recipe is so simple to follow yet the outcome is perfect for a fruitcake that is moist inside, crispy on the outside, crunchy and with lots of fruits. Good for kids since it is not alcoholic.

For a slightly healthier version, I substituted half whole wheat, half white flour.  Replaced white sugar with mix of succunat and raw sugar. I also used dried fruit for the candied fruit and it worked great, especially since I don't like maraschino cherries.

The cake was too sweet, and the top got hard, and the center gooey.   Would never make this again.

I would never half the batter, it's awesome packed full of fruit and nuts. I am thankful I followed pajlymans tips that she left on Dec 24 2007. I added my picture, I chopped the fruit up because we like it that way. We also put the batter in a 12 x 9 pan and sliced it into 6 mini loafs for sharing. It took quite a bit longer to bake in the 12 x 9 pan, I think I baked it for almost 2 hours! I also added cinnamon because my husband likes cinnamon, the cinnamon made the dough darker. I put 2 teaspoons of cinnamon but my husband thought maybe 1 tspn would be sufficient. I loved the nice crusty top this recipe made.

I have made this fruitcake for over 40 years. I like to add one and a half pounds of dates. It was originally in a magazine with several other holiday themed cakes. This was my favorite.  It is the only fruitcake that people always ask me to make. It is more of a confection than a cake.
