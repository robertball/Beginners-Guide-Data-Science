I've made this recipe twice now and used Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken. I used half a can of milk instead of the milk and water. To save time, I just scooped the sauce over the squash like it was spaghetti and I skipped baking. Very fast, easy, cheap and healthy. Would be good with mushrooms and/or broccoli.

My children absolutely loved this (ages 20 mo, 4 and 8 yr). My husband and I both felt that it needed some garlic; so I sauteed some garlic in a pan and added it to our portion of the squash. I think it would have been better if the garlic had been added in and baked with the dish. We will definitely make this again!

My vegetarian girlfriend really enjoyed this, but I wasn't a fan.  The sauce was very watery.  I would cut down on the water and add a little more cheese.

I loved this! I made it with cream of mushroom soup and just half a can of milk - on the side I sautee'd some garlic, onions and mushrooms then put spinach in at the end - and added this to the soup mixture.  Put it over the spaghetti squash and baked it for ten minutes with green onions and panko crumbs on top - didn't have cheese so I didn't put that it and it is still amazing. I'll try it with the cheese next time.

Our family really enjoyed this - what a pleasant way to enjoy this veggie!  We made a few necessary changes, due to what we had on hand, but like others, we did find it a bit bland.  (Our only changes were cream of chicken rather than celery and cheese type, as we had no Swiss.) Next time, we'll likely use cream of mushroom soup, add garlic, season it more - fresh ground pepper and salt - and add mushrooms.  Perhaps onion also.  We followed the suggestion of using 1 cup milk, no water, and the creaminess was great when mixed with the squash.  I roasted the squash in the oven by halving and seeding it first, then baking it for 40 minutes at 350 (halves upside down when roasting) - but the overall recipe was a nice change from others.

I should not be rating this because I did not make the Alfredo sauce according to the recipe, as I usually do not cook with canned soups and did not have any on hand.  I also used a different method of cooking the spaghetti squash... I cut the squash in half and then cleaned out the seeds.  I immersed the cut halves in boiling water and boiled for 20 minutes until a knife could be easily inserted in the skin.  Then I removed the halves from the water and allowed them to cool enough that I could use a fork and remove the "spaghetti."  In no way would I mistake this for real pasta, but it made a tasty side dish with the Alfredo Sauce I prepared using the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce on AR.

I followed some of the suggestions and modified the recipe to add one clove of garlic (minced), 1 cup of milk (instead of 3/4 c water and 1/4 cup milk) and sauted mushrooms. My very meat-centric husband thought it was excellent (as did I). Will definitely make again.

I guess my Spaghetti squash was bigger than I thought cause 50 minutes left it still crunchy. Even though I messed up we still really liked it! I did make a few changes. Didnt have Swiss so used Mozzarella and Colby cheese. We like lots of cheese and I didnt measure but the sauce thickness was perfect. I added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and some dehydrated celery flakes. I also just scrapped the squash noodles into my sauce to keep from messing up another dish. It was wonderful and I plan to make this again!

I, too, used all milk instead of water and added a little seasoned salt.  Some reviewers complained of the dish being watery so I strained my squash before combining it with the other ingredients.  Can't complain about the results!

I had some spaghetti squash,  and so I tried this...unfortunately it is pretty bad. I don't know how to fix it to make it better.

I made this a main dish by adding sauted chicken and a can of mushrooms. I used cream of mushroom soup and mozerella cheese instead.  I also added additional spices. Will definately make this again.

I did like this recipe.  but I felt it needed more to it, like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I used the garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery, only used milk, and threw in some nutmeg.  would probably make again with some more tweaking.

Pretty good. Even my reluctant vegetable eaters ate it. But not something I would rush to make again.

The recipe is fabulous as an Alfredo recipe which is always bland to me.  I added a little garlic, used all milk instead of the water and used mozzerella cheese instead (what I had on hand).  The kids had seconds and dad thought it was great!

It was incredibly bland. I tried adding extra cheese and hot sauce and smoked sea salt to no avail. Tasteless but edible...

I eat a lot of vegetarian foods and I love spaghetti squash but this dish was not very good.  I used very little extra milk due to other recommendations; it still was too watery.  It lacked flavor even though I added garlic and basil.  I think the problem is the cream of celery soup.  I love spaghetti squash but will not be using this recipe or any recipe remotely close to it again.  My teenager daughters found it inedible and they love most all vgetables.  If a want a sauce I will use an alfredo or any other pasta sauce.  I prefer to brown the spaghetti, add garlic, onions, basil, parsley and cheese.  Still looking for a different way of making it.

Me and my family Loved it! I made the recipe shorter tho by cutting the squash in half and deseeding it 1st (easier when not so hot) and cooked it in microwave (was much faster)! Only thing I added was salt and pepper while cooking...YUM! I had some zuchinni and shrimp to use up so I fried them together as a side and tell you what, it was PERFECT with this recipe! Next time I am gonna try adding garlic, think it would be awesome! I LOVE TO COOK!

Definitely easy, kids like it.  Depends how you feel about canned soup taste.  think it would be an easy camping recipe though.

I didn't care for this at all. I love suash and liked the idea but the sauce just didn't work for me, it was thin and runny. There wasn't much flavor, it was extremely mild but the flavor that was there I did not enjoy. Would maybe be better with a "cream of" other than celery and some added seasoning.
