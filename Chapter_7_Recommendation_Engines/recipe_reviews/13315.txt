Very good!  I am happily surprized by this soup.  I didn't crock-pot this but made it in a dutch oven.  Browned sausage first, drained it, wiped out most of grease from the oven.  Added the onions, carrots, and mushrooms.  Let them cook til onions were clear.  Added 3 diced yukon gold potatoes, kraut, broth.  Didn't have cream of soups, but didn't miss them at all.  Added a bit of oregano instead of dill, as that's what was on hand and extra garlic.  Makes a lot, so we'll be freezing at least half.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Will be making again!!

I have made this soup numerous times and it's one of my family's favorite meals.  They ask for it weekly!  It's especially good during the cold winter months as it is very rich and filling. I made it the first time as written, and have since made the following changes.  I only gave it four stars because I think it's much better with fresh vegetables instead of canned.  I used three yukon gold potatoes (peeled and cubed) five or six carrots (peeled and coined) about 1 1/2 TBS dried dill weed, a 32 oz. jar of sauerkraut with the juice, and a little extra chicken broth.  Also, I leave out the garlic.  With these changes it's a fantastic meal if you're a sauerkraut lover!  It really reminds me of the sauerkraut soup at the Polish restaurant in my hometown.

This soup is just so good! I love making homemade soups and using the crock pot! I took the advise of other cooks and added chicken and sour cream. I also used fresh potatoes and carrots.I really enjoy making unique dishes and this one is a keeper! So nice to come home to this great soup that is perfect for a cold winter in PA! I served this with dilled Havarti cheese and warm bread.

My Husband absolutely LOVES this soup!  I make it quite often.  The flavor is tart which we like.  I usually double the recipe because it goes so fast.  I also use twice the sausage ( One pound of keilbasa and one pound of hot sausage).  Fresh potatoes and carrots work perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This “Sauerkraut Soup II” is fantastic!  It’s a simple recipe that demands attention because it is so unusual!  Everyone at my office was asking for some when they smelt it warming up in the break room.  

I made a few changes….I left out the cream of chicken soup, and added instead a pound of chicken breasts.  It shredded nicely in the soup and made it more of a hearty meal.  I also used fresh potato’s and carrots, which worked out great as well.

If you like sauerkraut, or even if you don't, then this is the recipe for you!  We tend to like it a bit more on the sour side so we put some extra sauerkraut juice in and it turns out great everytime.  Its quick and easy and I have made it about 10 times now.  My mom is pretty picky with food and even she raves about it!

This was delicious-it made a nice lunch after being outside shoveling snow! I changed this a bit with low fat soups, low salt chicken broth, added fresh carrots, celery and mushrooms and then added 1/2 C. of fat free cream cheese to add to the creamy texture.  YUMMO!

I used fresh carrots and potatoes rather than canned, and sauteed them in butter first.  The soup is really delicious and my kids even liked it.  Amazing!  It's Oktoberfest time here, and this hearty German-style soup is perfect for a fall day.

I had to make too many changes to rate this higher than a 3, but this is a good base recipe to modify according to what you like.  The first time I made exactly like recipe, and it was way too watery, not enough meat, and I wasn't crazy about the dill taste.  The 2nd time, I eliminated the water altogether, doubled the meat (used hot turkey sausage links to decrease the fat content) used parsley instead of dill, and fresh carrots and potatoes.  After all that, it was an excellent soup.  I used a 32 oz jar of kraut also, and kept some of the juice in there.  Delish.

This was a wonderful soup! I gave it 4 stars because we didn't see the need for the extra water. I parboiled one large baking potato and a bag of frozen mirepoix, used 12 oz. of Johnsonville Cheddar and Jalapeno sausages and a 14 oz. can of drained sauerkraut. I'll definitely make this again - thanks for the recipe!

I think this recipe is great! If you love sauerkraut you will love this soup. It would even be good without sausage. I did not make this in the crock pot.  I just cooked it on the stove. The sausage was pre-cooked so I didn't brown the sausage before I added it.  This really is great soup!

This was awesome! I love sauerkraut and so did as another cook suggested and just put a whole bottle of wine sauerkraut in, juice and all. I also used fresh celery (I don't like carrots) and fresh potatoes (I have never bought canned potatoes??!). I used farmer sausage and just used chicken broth instead of water. Serve with a baguette and it's a wonderful meal!! Thanks for the recipe! :) It smells wonderful when cooking!

I made this recipe for dinner last evening, and it was a hit! Using a crock pot, I put in all ingredients (I used fresh potatoes and carrots) except for the sauerkraut and sausage, and cooked it on high for 6 hours. I put the sauerkraut and sausage (turkey sausage, since that is what my family likes) in for the last hour of cooking. We do like the taste of sauerkraut, and may put in even more next time!
Great recipe!

I thought this was soup was very easy to make and extremely tasty.  My husband and I both loved it, although it made too much for one sitting.  I froze the rest and we'll have it again in a few weeks.  A nice, hot meal on cold winter nights.

Tip:  If you drain/rinse the sauerkraut it takes care of complaints about this soup being too sour.  I did this and I think it's more of a sweet-sour.  I also drained and rinsed the other veggies...rinsing reduces the salt content.  Also, I used polish turkey sausage; I think that worked very well and probably lowered the calories a bit more from those calculated.

To make it healthier, next time I'm going to use fresh carrots, fresh potatoes, and figure out how to make the base cream soups from scratch.  I did use home made chicken broth this time just like I do for everything.

This is a good, hardy soup. Like many other reviewers, I used fresh carrots and potatoes. Since we do not like "sour" sauerkraut, I drained and rinsed it before adding it to the mix. I also used 28 ox. of sausage, but other than that, I followed the recipe. Very much a keeper!

Although our family liked the soup, we didn't finish our bowls.  There was just something off~maybe next time (if there is a next time) I would add another can of cream of chicken to add more creamy flavour.

I have to give this 5 stars because 5 out of 5 people at my dinner table loved this soup!  I used a bag of diced potatos w/onion because that's what I had, and added some onion powder to taste...it was a very pretty soup...the aroma was wonderful.  My husband says I have to make this again...excellent recipe!

This is one of the greatest soups I have had in a long time.  I would probably go with fresh potatos next time though.  Also, I accidently got cream of celery instead of chicken, but I thought it added a great flavor.

great tasting soup.... quick and easy to make. Will definitely make again. I would not change a thing, But if you dont have the canned potatoes and carrots you could just use fresh and boil a little longer.

This is a really good soup for a chilly fall day.  I did make a couple changes to it, I used fresh baby yellow potatoes and fresh carrots instead of canned, when using fresh vegetables I cooked the soup for 6-7 hours in the crock pot.  I will make this again for sure.

Oh my word. This is fabulous! It smells delicious cooking, and I couldn't wait to sample it. I let i simmer on low for about an hour on the stovetop, and it was perfect. I used pre-sliced fresh carrots instead of canned, and omitted the sausage. After digging out from the blizzard here in Chicago, this soup most certainly hit the spot. Thanks so much Terrilyn!

Good recipe...My family makes homemade sauerkraut every year.  I always add a cooking apple finely chopped/grated to add sweetness...It works in this recipe too :)

I've had this recipe in my files for years. I have never used potatoes in this soup but I might try it. Comes together great in a crock pot just dump everything in and cook on low about 6-8 hours. Thanks  Terrilyn

I loved this recipe. I was a little cautious using canned veggies but it really comes out good. I love sauerkraut so I just put the whole can in. Wonderful Octoberfest food!

I felt like making something German today, New Years Eve. I actually am German, but my family has been very americanized (is that a word? :) so I wanted something my ancesters might have eaten. I chose this recipe because it looked easy. The soup turned out great! It was very good tasting, easy to make and I would definitely make it again. In fact, I'll probably keep ingredients on hand for it.

My dad raved over the taste.  He ate it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

I will definitely make it again.  I made sure to drain the sauer kraut well and did use two cans of mushroom soup to make it creamier.  I did not add as much water as stated in the recipe.  It was really yummy.

Love soup. Love sauerkraut. I must say, I have never come across a sauerkraut soup recipe. I am so glad I found this one.This was absolutely delishous.  I don,t make many recipes twice just because I love to try new stuff. My hubby  insisted this one get added to the "make again file" Yes. it is that good!

I did a couple of mods, used fresh green beans instead of carrots, fresh potatoes, didn't use the dill, thought it came out great!  I think next time though, instead, I'm going to use shredded cabbage instead of the Sauerkraut, I know that seems to miss the point, but felt it was too vinegary for me.

We omitted the dill and onions (personal preference).  We did not have mushroom soup, so we used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  This was absolutely delicious!!!  This will be one that is made again soon!

Fantastic!  I had no idea what to expect from this, but it was delicious, and my kids even loved it! I make my own kraut, and am always looking for new ways to use it.  I followed the recipe basically as written, but next time I think I will add more kraut.  I also did this on the stove because I didn't have time to make in the slow cooker.  Delicious, will definitely make again - thanks!

Really enjoyed this soup but we love kraut.  I did take a small tube of biscuits, tore it into little pieces, and added the dough to the soup the last 30 minutes, cooking on high.   Great recipe.

Sauerkraut soup is a tradition in Slovakia for Christmas Eve dinner and my husband thought this tasted like what he had growing up. I added bay leaves and a few corn peppers. It was delicious!

This was delicious!  My boyfriend is allergic to mushrooms so, borrowing off of what other reviewers said, I skipped the cream of mushroom soup and substituted a pound of chicken breasts and shredded them about an hour before serving. It turned out great and the sauerkraut flavor was not overwhelming at all!

With all the great reviews I was expecting more from this soup.  It was fine but I don't think it was outstanding.  I think it had too much water, I would recommend reducing it by a cup and a half or 2 cups.  An extra can of potatoes would have been good.  After tasting this we added about 1/4 cup cooked brown rice to the bottom of our bowls of soup.  This addition helped with the watery aspect.  It is fairly inexpensive and does make a lot so it would be ideal for a St. Patty’s party or Oktoberfest.

This was a good soup. I saw some other reviews and comments about the tartness. I put a few spoonfuls of sugar, and rinse the sauerkraut. I didn't have potato's on hand so I used the dried potato's out of a box of Betty Crocker box without the packet of sauce. That worked out well, and I used an extra can of cream of mushroom to make it creamier. I also cooked the onions and garlic in olive oil  before adding them to the crock pot. I hate cooked carrots so I left them out.

Nice for a change, but not something I would make on a regular basis. I liked the veggie combo, but wasn't sure about the smoked sausage - more of a texture thing rather than flavor. I think I may experiment with sauerkraut, mushrooms and sour cream.

My Mom has been making this for years and our family loves it.  We like kraut, and made like this it has a nice mellow flavor.  Mom also uses a summer sausage for meat cut into bite size pieces.  The only thing hers has that this doesn't is mushrooms.  She probably uses fresh veggies too. Highly recommend for your kraut lovers--a very hearty soup.

Very good.  Especially a nice Oktoberfest addition.  Next time I will probably use small red potatoes (not canned) and perhaps add a bit more Sauerkraut (cause I love sauerkraut).  All in all, a good recipe.

This is very good and I even used a low fat sausage.  It was wonderful and you don't feel guilty at all.  I didn't have dill but I just used a little oregano instead.

Use 3-4 sliced carrots and a few chopped potatoes and par boli these first. Also, saute the onion and garlic a little first.

Scrumptious Terrilyn! I too used fresh vegies, in addition to homemade stock I had in the freezer. For the meat, I just cut off what I had left from spare ribs we had last week. I did have the cream of chicken soup in the house, but strangely no mushroom, so I used a can of Bean and Bacon soup instead. As long as I was going this route, I decided to throw in some navy beans which really thickened it up nicely. My only other addition was about a tsp. of caraway seeds. I didn't tell the kids that there was kraut in the soup until after they fell in love with it! "Souper" and thanks!

A nice, hearty winter soup.  I think it was one of our favorites, and we've made it several times since, and every time its a big hit.  I did add a package of Lipton herb soup mix, and that complimented thee caraway and other flavors beautifully.

This tasted much better than I expected.  I had a half of a jar of sauerkraut left and needed to use it up so I drained all of the juice out first. If you use real potatoes it takes about 4 to 5 hours in the crockpot on high!

I love this recipe!! It's the tartness and dill that put it over the top. Like another review, I gave it 4  because I like to use fresh, not canned veggies. I always have carrots and potatoes. I used turkey broth leftover from Christmas. It's so rich, I used some lemon juice to cut the richness. I also used elk brats, which I had in the freezer. It's better using the original recipe, except the veggies.

A wonderful addictive dish.  I've also made it with smoked hot dogs and it worked well.  Not as good as the sausage but in a pinch it worked.  Added smoke flavoring when I used the hot dogs.

This is better than I thought and it has a great taste.  I didn't do any adds, as I like to stick to the recipe as much as possible the first time.  I did however, only add 2 cups of water and I used the entire 14oz can of kraut.  4 hours on high in the crock pot was just right.  Next time I will use fresh potatoes and carrots, but this really is a easy way to make it if you want to stick to the cans. Still great.

Great comfort food. My picky husband loved it with hard bread and hot sauce. I also delivered some to my daughter at work. The aroma in that small break room would make anyone hungry.

Loved this soup and that's coming  from a Polish girl  who loves sauerkraut.  Followed  recipe just added more sauerkraut juice  because  I like it sour.  Needed a new soup to make  and I found it. This  will be  a favorite recipe in our family.

I made this soup last night and love it.  I used a whole jar, 32 oz., of sauerkraut, fresh vegetables and added celery and mushrooms.  If you don't like kraut, you won't like this.  I love sauerkraut and I almost hurt myself with this soup.

After searching for ever for similar ingredients. I changed it up a bit ;->. I rated this 4 stars because it was easy and gave me a boost to what I had on hand...I use  1 1/2 LBS GROUND VENISON SAUSAGE (low fat), FRESH 1/2 head CABBAGE, 2 stalk CELERY, 1-2 large CARROTS,2-4 cut up RED POTATOS (depending on size) AND 2 cloves Fresh GARLIC..seasoned as directed.. use the crock pot on high for 2 hr and low for 4 hrs. and it turned out Absolutely Fantastic... Will go great with french bread, salad and to top it off. cold frosty BEER.... great (after Trick-Treat) dinner :-)

Loved the great taste in the original soup and then made it into more of a casserole by eliminating the water and cutting the broth down to 1 can. I doubled the recipe & added a little more meat.. A wonderful treat!

I took one bite of this.  Boyfriend didn't like it either.  I don't think I've ever rated a recipe so low.  I had such high hopes after reading the rave reviews on this one.
