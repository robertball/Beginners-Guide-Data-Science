Served at a bring-a-dish holiday gathering. Received a somewhat tepid response. The taste was okay but it didnâ€™t have a pronounced smoky flavor. In our coastal community, smoked fish dips are served at most restaurants and many local fisherman have their own secret version creating a high bar for achieving marvelous accolades. The cream cheese base produces a firm spread and tends to overpower the other ingredients. Refrigerated this dip for about 8 hours before serving. The flavor profile better developed by the following day so you may want to make this a day before serving.

So simple to prepare.  Flavour is excellent.  Followed the recipe to the letter.  Everyone at home loves it, either as a dip or on toast, even for breakfast!

Great flavors but I used my food processor! Put the lemon juice, dill, chives, horseradish, and capers in and pulse to get a paste. Then add cream cheese and process until well mixed. Finally add the trout chunks and pulse for the consistency you want. Much less labor and the exact same results.
