Made as written except for the jack portion of the cheese I used half monterey jack and half pepper jack to give it some extra kick. This was excellent! The one problem I did have was that this gets thick and quick. I ended up using a lot more half and half to thin it down. When I make this again I'll use only half and half instead of the whipping cream/half and half combo. Thanks for sharing!
