I love Chef John. I mean, seriously. How awesome is this guy? Pinchy Pies? You had me at Pinchy. I love the recipe, his cadence, and all his little jokes. Give this man his own show. :)

Outstanding PP&J Pinchy Pies!! I tried it with thin sliced ham and various cheeses.  All had their own pop, as it were; however,  I found American cheese the best in my humble opinion.
