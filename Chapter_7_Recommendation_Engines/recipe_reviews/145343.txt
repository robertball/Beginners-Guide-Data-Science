Very good, a simple change to regular rice krispy bars. 90 seconds in the microwave was perfect to melt the margarine and marshmallows, and then we stirred in around 2/3 cup of chunky PB. My five-year-old had fun trying to stir in the cereal, and then licking out the bowl. Oh, and I lined the pan with sprayed wax paper for easy clean up. Thanks for sharing! :)

An even better addition:  melt one bag of semisweet chocolate chips on top of the PB bars!!  Heat oven to 200, and place full pan with hard chips spread across the top, and let them melt- about 8 minutes- then spread.  YUM!

Easy and excellent, as expected. I just melt everything in the microwave, which almost eliminates the risk of burning and makes the cleanup super easy.

I've made these for years...the peanut butter cuts down the sweetness. Another option to rice krispies  is cocoa krispies

Of course these are delicious. I LOVE rice crispy treats and adding peanut butter gives them a special twist. I also melted some white chocolate and drizzled some on top for a sexy look.

Rice Krispie treats are the best!  Adding peanut butter definately was a nice change for a different flavor.  I've also added about 1 & 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips to this and they came out very good.

These are an awesome variation on the classic Rice Crispy Treats, especially if you love peanut butter.  This version takes me back to my childhood big time.  So good!

Had fun making these with my 8 yr old. I have celiac disease, so I subsituted some Rice Chex cereal for the Rice Krispies (not gluten-free) and it came out great! So nice to enjoy a snack with my child!!

These were so yummy! First time making homemade ones and never knew there was such a big difference. These have a very suttle peanut butter flavor so if you want a strong taste you may want to add more peanut butter

The recipe sounded like a spin on the traditional rice krispy bar, so I thought they would be good.  I would definitely not recommend heating the marshmallows on the stove, much easier and less messy in the microwave.  It also seemed that there was not enough rice krispies because there wasn't enough marshmallow to mix w/ all of my rice krispies, so my bars were falling apart when they were done.  Overall the taste was good, but needs some tweaking.

Very good.  I like the flavor combination of marshmallow and peanut butter.  This is how my mom made them when I was a kid. I had no idea growing up that crispy treats were made any other way.  Now my family insists on the peanut butter version.

Memories of making Rice Krispy Bars with my now-grown children when they were youngsters sparked an invitation to make them again. Instead of using Jif creamy PNB, I opted to use 2/3 cup of extra crunchy PNB. They turned out great. I followed Duckball's  method, melting marshmallows, butter, and PNB in a glass bowl in the microwave oven for 90 seconds. Looking through the glass door, I thought I'd have to add 20 seconds. Didn't though (am glad I opted not to) because once I put a wooden spoon to it, the fluffiness "evaporated" into a sticky liquid. Had trouble handling the mix when pouring into the glass dish so ended up buttering both hands to spread it evenly. Thanks, Jif, for a change - great idea. ;)

Yummy! My father-in-law discovered these at a picnic recently. I brought a few home and he hid them from the rest of us. :)  I also just made a batch for my toddler, but I used his cheerios instead. They turned out perfectly delicious. I also added the chocolate to the top!

I thought this needed a bit more moisture, the peanut butter made it a bit thicker and harder to spread in the pan.  Hubby loved them and said he liked them better than regular marshmallow crispy treats...I disagreed, I like the plain ones better, but these were a nice twist.

Great and simple. I sprinkle the top with semi-sweet chocolate chips and press them in before it cools completely. I use buttered hands to press it in to the pan.

I made these for the guys that live with me and my husband and they all loved them! I made with extra marshmallow(used full bag) and crunchy peanut butter(what we had on hand). One of the roommates is rather picky and he was thrilled. The whole pan was gone in only a few days.
