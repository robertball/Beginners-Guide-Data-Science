I cut the amount of oil back and added in additional pumpkin puree. I also didn't want to mess around with cutting a bunch of cranberries in half, I just threw them in the food processor and pulsed them a few times for a rough chop. Right before baking, I sprinkled each muffin mound with a little sugar. Baked at 350*, these were done at a little over 20 minutes. We all thought this muffin was fantastic, especially me. I really loved the combination of the pumpkin, cranberry with the hint of orange. Very, very good.

These muffins have great flavors...you can taste the pumpkin, orange, and cranberries in each bite.  I didn't have fresh cranberries, so I used chopped dried cranberries and it came out great (~1/2 cup dried cranberries for the full batch should be enough).  Also, I cut the recipe in half, but it only made 10 muffins; next time I'll make the full batch, and perhaps also add chopped walnuts.

Awesome recipe! Interesting mix of flavors- I made it a bit healthier by subbing the oil with applesauce and a I used a full can of pumpkin. It was VERY moist! Also, as someone else suggested I let the fresh cranberries "pop" in a simple syrup on the stovetop (1/2 c water, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 c fresh cranberries. Made lovely swirls when folded in! I also cut the sugar to 1 1/2 since I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the cranberries. Kids LOVED these.

These are awesome!  I replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of wheat flour because I used an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of 8 oz. Also, I only used 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Also added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts with the cranberries, that I just burst quickly in the food processor instead of cutting in half.   I love the tart taste of the cranberry mingled with  the sweetnest of the muffin...different and great combination!   This will be a great hit at the Thanksgiving table!

I made these muffins with a few alterations. I used melted butter rather than oil, and used less than 1/2 c. so that I could use more pumpkin. I only used one egg (I was short) and reserved a Tbsp of sugar for the cranberries. Instead of cutting each cranberry, I cooked them with the reserved sugar and a Tbsp of water until they burst, then folded them into the batter. The added syrup (from the juices, sugar and water) sufficiently loosened up the batter to muffin consistency. They were pretty delicious if I do say so myself. As an added bonus, the cranberries folded into the pumpkin batter have a really nice Autumn swirl effect. I'll make these again and again!

These muffins didn't rise well for me, but the taste completely made up for it. The blend of flavors is delicious and the cranberry flavor really pops! Will definitely make these again.

Good  recipe. I used leftover cranberry  orange  relish, then reduced the sugar by 1/2 a cup. I left out the oil. It didn't  need it.

Excellent! Great flavor, wonderful smell, and looked great with all the cranberries being cut in half. I gave it four stars because it is a bit of work cutting all the cranberries in half, and I prefer a bit more spice in my muffins (I'll be adding more next go 'round)

These are good if you like pumpkin spice. I'm not a fan of nutmeg so they're not my favorite, but they were a hit at brunch. Love the tartness of the cranberries.

These turned out really tasty, however, they didn't set up like I wanted.  They were lumpy looking on top instead of a smooth top. Other than that, they were good!

This is my go-to muffin recipe. Everyone loves them. I follow the recipe for the most part but have made them without orange peel when I didn’t have any; the peel definitely adds to the flavour but they are good without as well. I sprinkle the top with pumpkin seeds before baking. Adds a nice little crunch.

I wish I'd thought of applesauce, but I didn't, I think the oil made the muffins 'heavy'.  I had trouble getting all that oil mixed evenly into the batter. They were very sweet, one muffin was about all anyone could eat. I'd call this a recipe to build on.

Had some fresh cranberries on hand, and love pumpkin...could not have been a better turn out!  Love it!  Enough to make 12 muffins with half of the recipe and a loaf to save for later with the other half....did not change a thing!

I made these muffins this week with some differences. I cut the recipe in half and substituted applesauce for the oil. I added 1/2 a cup of milk otherwise the batter is too thick. I found I couldn't taste the pumpkin much, so next time will add more.

Great recipe! I added another half cup of pumpkin and instead of the pumpkin pie spice, i added 1.5 tsp cinnamon, half teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice.  They were delicious!

I made this with fresh pumpkin, half the sugar, and replaced half of the oil with apple syrup. I think it could use a bit more pumpkin pie spice! Other than that it was great. I will definitely make it again.  It was the first time I used my silicone muffin pan (er, tray, I guess it isn't a pan) and they came out easily.

This was so amazing. I had about two and a half cups of cranberries, so I doubled the recipe and supplemented with raspberries. I also use a two cup can of spiced pumpkin, stuff ready to put in a pie, so I didn't have to add the  pumpkin spice. It was a lot of work for me, but totally worth it (especially on Thanksgiving).

Loving the idea of a cranberry swirl in my muffins, I used the simple syrup idea, putting about 1/4 C sugar (I used this amount from the sugar called for in the recipe) in a small saucepan with the cranberries and a small amount of water.  I let it heat up until I had been hearing the berries burst open for about a minute and set it aside until ready to fold them into the batter.  I didn't have any oranges, but did have some clementines, so I zested two of them.  It seems to have worked just as well as orange zest would have.  The hint of citrus flavor was a wonderful surprise to my taste buds.  Another touch I added was a pinch of sugar on the tops of each muffin (some before I baked them, some after baking and still hot, for variety).  

The muffins were delicious, and using a large Pampered Chef scoop to portion the dough, I got 23 muffins.  I would have had enough for 24, scraping the sides, but there wouldn't have been any cranberry in it, so I decided to "taste" that batter once I'd put the muffins into the oven.   

I will definitely make these again!

Seriously the most delicious muffins I may have ever had! A perfect breakfast treat for the Fall season. I did not use 'pumpkin spice' or orange zest (didn't have either in the house), but I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a sprinkling of cinnamon on the top of each muffin. Dee-lish! This recipe made enough for our house AND enough for me to give a few to friends.

These had a nice balanced flavor.  I cut back the sugar to 1 cup and subbed applesauce for the oil.  We found them very dense and they seems to lose flavor as time went on
