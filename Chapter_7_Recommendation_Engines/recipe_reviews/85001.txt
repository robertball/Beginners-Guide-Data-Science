I've noticed several people confused about the sugar...it's not for the eggs, but the tomatoes. This is a traditional Chinese dish. I am not Chinese, but I've had it in many places in China and learned to make this from a Chinese girl. They even substitute ketchup for tomatoes sometimes.

My family always put sugar in eggs so I liked that although the soy sauce was a bit strange in this dish.  I probably would have preferred to leave that out and just add mozarella cheese to the egg/tomato mix instead.

MMM. This was so good. I ate mine over rice with some extra soy sauce. Next time I will add some onions and maybe shrimp or chicken.

Delicious! I served the dish with rice.  The only thing I changed was adding 2 more eggs.  I had scaled the recipe up to 4 servings and 4 tomatoes, chopped just seemed like too much.  With the 6 eggs it was perfect.  I suppose the amount of tomatoes depends on the size of the tomato you are using as well as personal preference.  This is just like a dish my mother used to make all the time when I was growing up.  My husband was surprised to learn this is a common chinese dish and I was surprised he liked it!

I absolutely LOVED this. It's so different. My husband said he put too much soy sauce in but I disagreed. I thought the 'little extra' was perfect.

I was looking for a recipe that tastes like the eggs and tomatoes I had while in Lanzhou, China.  This didn't quite make it.  I only used a teaspoon of sugar, and I think that was too much.  :(

This was edible, but I'm not at all sure about the strange soy sauce twang.

I also like to add a drop or two of sesame seed oil when mixing with the rice.  I grew up having these eggs with steamed rice - it's one of my favorite comfort foods!

This was a bit different. I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was a quick, fairly tasty breakfast. I made it exactly as written; the tomatoes I used were Romas, i.e., on the smallish side, but the egg/tomato proportions were fine by me. The sugar taste in the dish was kind of unusual, but I liked it. The dash of soy sauce was hardly discernible, and I love soy sauce, so would've liked more. This was a quick way to use up some perishables I had on hand, and I might make this again some time.

Even though I cut back on the amount of sugar in this recipe it was far to sweet for our family.  It was suggested I not make it again.

This is exactly how my dad made eggs for us growing up. Except he added the veggies in the pan before removing from heat. When I was a kid, I thought we were the only family who ate eggs like this (he was a Hawai'i expat)! Great memories, great breakfast.

I added an extra egg and one chopped avocado at the end which paired well. A bit too sweet for me, it probably depends on the tomatoes. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I really enjoyed this it was light and tasty, and I have not eaten or made scrambled eggs in years, I think the sugar and the soy sauce really help the taste :)

I loved this dish growing up in an Filipino-Chinese household.  My only adjustment to this recipe is to change the ingredients to your tastes and observations.  Too much tomato could make your scramble too watery.  And you shouldn't need both soy sauce and salt.  I prefer my combination to be just tomato and eggs.  Try it with some buttered jasmine rice!

The eggs were great as was the dish. One thing I'd change is don't use more than a few tbsp. of soy sauce, it has a strong taste and when you say dash people sometimes add more than just a few tbsp. that's required.
