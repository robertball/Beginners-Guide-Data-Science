Like the previous reviewer, I layered the ingredients instead of rolling.  Chicken, shaved honey ham, shredded swiss cheese, bacon.  Broiling at the end is a must!  Tons of flavor.  My husband thought leftovers would be good as a sandwich filling, so we're giving that a try!

This was very good.  I didn't bother to flatten the breasts, just left them as is.  I put the ham on top and added the chicken broth--cooked, covered for 30 minutes, then added the cheese and used bacon bits and broiled for about 2 minutes.  They turned out great and didn't have the mess of pounding the chicken.  I'll make it again.

This was very tasty and easy to make. I suggest turning the chicken over when broiling so all the bacon gets crispy.  Will definitely make this again!

This is just delicious. I use the pre-cooked bacon so it doesn't need the crisping at all, it's just great out of the oven.

This was a huge success in my house.  I don't particularly enjoy cooking so I try to find easy recipes that sound tasty to me.  Originally my husband and son thought I bought it already prepared and nearly fell off their chairs when I told them I made it from scratch. This was really delicious.  I'll definitely keep this one in my recipe file to make again.

Chicken a la AWESOME!  Oh man, I made myself sick going back for seconds.  I made it exactly as the recipe reads, except I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for a few hours.  In addition, I made the cream sauce in the Quick Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe.  I thought it might be dry otherwise.  Really really good recipe.  I will definitely make again.

Tasted good, although it came out of the pan looking a little rough (it slid apart).  I didn't crisp the bacon in the broiler as suggested, but definately should have.  Will probably make again.

made this tonight. had to substitute cheddar for swiss when I realized my intended cheese had molded, but otherwise followed recipe. Layered instead of rolled, for simplicity. Turned out well... I thought it was average, hubby thought it was pretty good. I'd try it again, especially with another cheese.

Delicious! Didn't change it a bit. To make flattening the chicken breast easier and way less messy, put it in a large Ziploc bag and use the flat side of the mallet (or whatever it is called).

Great for low carb dieters. Very yummy. I used Wishbone's Italian dressing instead of chicken broth and it turned out sooo good, better than with the chicken broth I've learned. I've made this twice and everyone loved it.

I didn't bother to pound my breasts down either...I decided to butterfly my breast, layer the ingredients on the bottom (pan side) then fold top back over and layer again, then using the precooked bacon, I wrapped it around my breast and attached with toothpicks so that it's pulled a little tight, make sure that the tooth picks go somewhat into the bottom portion of the breast. then bake accordingly, adjusting a bit for the thickness of the breast...it was absolutely wonderful, the bacon was some awesome texture added to the dish.

Nice rendition of rolled chicken breasts.  Just a note to those who seem to insist on "crisp bacon".  Bacon can be cooked thoroughly without being crisp (i.e. without the fat from being fully rendered).  It is rolled around the chicken to lend it's flavor.  Fat is flavor!  Crisp bacon is at the most - just salty.

This is a great recipe, my husband loved the chicken, and he is not a big fan of swiss cheese. I also did not bother to flatten the chicken and it still worked.

I stacked this like some others suggested, lso used boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  I didn't use the whole can of chicken broth because after I started pouring, it was entirely covering the chicken and I wondered how my bacon would crisp at the end while swimming in broth.  My picky husband liked this alot, however we both agreed this could use some sort of sauce.  The chicken broth just wasn't doing anything for us. Any suggestions?  I will definately make again and experiment with different sauces on top.

We didn't really care for this.  We couldn't taste the cheese, I think most of it seeped out the ends.  It was dry, even cooking it in the broth.

I pretty much did what most of the other reviewers did, I layered the ingredients rather than rolling them up.  I also didn't use a whole can of chicken broth, just poured enough to have about an inch in the bottom of my pan.  Very yummy, thank you!

This recipe is to die for! Whenever you're looking for a really good, "homey" chicken recipe, this is the one! I found it while looking for a chicken recipe easy enough to make within an hour and different than just grilled or baked chicken. Had never made Chicken Cordon Bleu, very similar to this, but it came out perfect! I wish there was a sauce for it though... but still fantastic! Juicy, Tender, Savory Chicken! Very much 'A La Good!'

This was a yummy and different way to excite your baked chicken fans in your house-hold. I need to tell ya that you might want to use plenty of chicken broth while baking this dish...and a little basting will ensure that it comes out as moist as possible. We liked it - and will try again. Served with stuffing and a fresh salad on the side.

This was delicious and my family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. We had one portion left over and the next morning I sliced it into several 1/4" slices and made sandwiches for my 2 sons for their school lunches and they really enjoyed them.

It does not say if you cover the chicken when you put it in the oven. So I am guessing not.                   thanks Judy

I cooked it on the bbq using a cedar plank. So, had to drop the broth part and didn't use the bacon. It was Delicious!!!!

Really good - and easy!  Also, makes a very nice presentation.  The only thing was that it came out a bit dry on top - maybe I should have made a sauce (ala Cordon Bleu) - that might have helped.  Still, I will definitely make this again!

This was so quick and easy!  Like some other reviewers, I didn't pound or roll the chicken; just layered and baked.  I did two breasts and just covered the bottom of the baking dish with broth.  I used the broiler at the end to crisp up the bacon- be careful with that part.  Four stars instead of five only because it didn't completely blow me away, but it was really good.

My picky husband and son love this recipe.  I cut the chicken breasts in half to make portions smaller and cook time more effective.

The combination was very good. I think next time I will do as others have done and layer it instead of rolling. It was a pain to roll these.

Very good!  Like one previous poster, I used the sauce from the Chicken Cordon Bleu II recipe on this site.  WONDERFUL addition!  I didn't have honey ham, so substituted prociutto, and that worked fine.  Used the chicken broth on the bottom of the baking dish.    I went to the trouble of pounding out the chicken breasts and rolling them up, and it made for a very pretty presentation.  I did find it necessary to flip them over when broiling the bacon at the end to get the bacon crispy all over.  I may try leaving the bacon off entirely next time.  I think it would still be very good.

My husband loved it! I just draped the bacon slices over the chicken rolls so I didn't have to turn them during cooking and it broiled nicely at the end.
