This is the only traditional Greek salad on this site. I hate it when you are instructed to add in a million different things. Greek salad is SIMPLE...Oregano and a little mint MAYBE tops it off.

I think maybe you forgot to add the oregano?? It's not authentic Greek salad without the oregano in the dressing - I would add about 1 tsp of dried oregano leaves to this dressing - then YUM! :-)

Simple and delicious - I used half the amount of red onion called for, added a little oregano and bit of salt and pepper.

Add some oregano and this would be exactly what I learned to make in Greece.  If you have other colors of bell peppers available, I would add them as well.  The best Feta is the block packed in juice--you'll have to crumble it yourself, but if you can find it, it's a lot better than the pre-crumbled kind. People go crazy over this salad every time I make it.

Wonderful! Big hit at pot luck. This actually measures out more than enough in one serving. Will make again

Really tasty and refreshing flavor. I love dressings that do not cover up the flavor of the vegetables. I did omit the onions, as we aren't big fans. Totally simple and delicious. Thanks :)

I wanted to try a Greek salad without lettuce and gave this one a try.  It was pretty good.   I added 1/2 tsp of oregano flakes to the mixture prior to 'cooling' in the fridge.  Next time I'd cut back on one of the tomatoes and add another pepper instead. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious when you add some black olives and instead of the olive oil and lemon juice I found some greek vinaigrette with a wonderful flavor!  This is a great recipe when you are needing something to do with all those leftover veggies from the garden!

I agree that this is one of the few authentic Greek salads on the net.  I spent two weeks in Crete and had at least eight Greek salads each at different places including a beach stand.  Not one had olives, lettuce, "English" cucumber, basil nor fancy dressing.  Always a large amount of extra virgin oil with small amount of lemon juice or vinegar, salt and oregano.  A large block of Feta sitting on top.  They had proportionally more tomatoes than this but that's fine as it depends on one's preference.  Garden ripe tomatoes only please.

This is good. I left out the green pepper and added some small chopped romaine lettuce. Only thing missing is some "definitely needed salt." I used an English style seedless cucumber partially peeled. And, for the onions, because they have a stronger taste, I sliced them and had them on the side for whoever wanted them on their salad. And, I served the salad right away so the vegetables would not wilt in the fridge from the lemon juice.

Excellent - added a little red wine vinegar, oregano and some green olives. Delicious way to use some garden produce.

Loved it. Only used half of red onion. added 1/8 cup of red wine vinegar. And I just had to add the olives. My kids made me make 2 days in a row. Thanks.

I love this greek salad.  The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of oregano, kalamata olives and some salt and pepper.  I also let it marinate for a few hours and then add the feta cheese.  It's always a bit hit!

I just spent 2 weeks in Greece during which time I ate Greek Salad nearly every day.  The red onion and green pepper were always minimal and sliced extremely thin.  Add salt and oregano and it's perfect!

Not as good as I thought it would be.  Go easy on the onions.
