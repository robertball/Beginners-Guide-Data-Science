Haven't made anything with harissa spice mix before but I had a lot left over from when my daughter visited so looking for an easy-to-prepare recipe to use up  the harissa. Followed recipe exactly as is but instead of grilling, I baked it in the oven since it wasn't grilling weather outside. Very tasty with a bit of a kick. Even my son who doesn't care for overly hot, spicy foods thought this recipe was a keeper. Definitely will make again but now I'll have to buy more harissa spice mix!

I didn’t go in expecting much but this recipe was delicious! I didn’t marinade for a long time and I baked the thighs instead but the flavor was still spot on. Even my very picky 11 yr old liked it, we’ll definitely do it again
