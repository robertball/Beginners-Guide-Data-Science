I made some changes - first I infused some olive oil with garlic, I removed the garlic and seared the scallops in the oil on high heat. Once the scallops were done I transfered them to a plate. Then I added the butter and sauteed some garlic and shallots and added about 2 tablespoons of flour (as a thinkening agent for sauce).  Then added some chicken stock and w-wine, lemon, pasta, asparagus, tomatoes, parmesan and of course the scallops and tossed it all together.  So good!!!  I guess I came up with my own recipe, but thanks for the good start.

Made this for dinner last night and we were pleasantly surprised with the results. Bravo!!! A recipe thats oh so simple, but oh so delicious! I followed it exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. What an excellent dish this is to serve to your sweetheart. My husband made all those "mmmm good" sounds as he ate, and he's somewhat picky when it comes to seafood recipes. Thanks for submitting this one; I will definitely be making these again!

Easy and delicious.  I served over angel hair pasta with fresh grated parmesan.

Regarding the reviews that slammed this recipe because of the amount of butter - DUH!  Couldn't you tell before you started cooking?  I love butter.  If I was dieting, this wouldn't be the way I'd prepare my scallops.  But I'm not - and this recipe makes me so happy that I'm not!

This is an enthusiastic 5 star rating.

These were wonderful!! I added chicken broth, white wine, lemon juice, parmesan cheese, garlic, salt pepper and butter in the skillet after searing the scallops, and added the scallops back in once these were mixed.  I made angel hair pasta and added canned spinach and mixed the scallops and sauce and spinach and pasta all together, it was great. **added parsley and italian seasoning too**

Good!.. After cooking the scallops in the butter I took them out and added the lemon and other ingredients back in the pan along with a little marsala wine... simmered a few minutes.  Last I threw in some Italian parsley and scallops back in the sauce then served over linguini! ~ Made it again tonight but didn't use any lemon since I didn't have any... more garlic and I seared them for a darker colored scallop!  Served with pasta from a box and broccoli.

This was delicious!  My palet just recently found a fondness for seafood but I'm still pretty picky.  Tonight my husband made this recipe and I was a little nervous, I'd only had scallops twice in a restaurant, I was pleasently surprised, this was so wonderful. He wants me to let you know he added fresh parsley, tarter sauce, half n' half, cayenne pepper to the lemon/salt mixture.  This made it creamier and made for a nice presentation.

I live on Cape Cod so have sea scallops often.  I've tried tons of recipes and yours is the best.  I only made a couple of changes...I used half butter and half olive oil with crushed red pepper to brown the scallops...and added some white wine to the sauce after removing the scallops.  Thanks for a super recipe!

Don't add the garlic before the scallops! Scallops should be cooked on medium high to high heat (you want them browned after all- "No color, no flavor" as Gordon Ramsay says), and this just means the garlic burns badly in the butter while the scallops cook. I trusted the recipe, and had to quickly heat up and add butter to another pan to transfer the scallops to before they got burned garlic taste on them. If done again I would add the garlic after I'd turned removed the scallops and turned down the heat. Then add the lemon juice and seasonings. Otherwise simple and tasty.

We were going to have Chinese takeout tonight and while looking over the menu, I thought scallops in garlic sauce sounded good.  Then I realized we had scallops in the freezer and decided to make this recipe.  It's great!  We added some broccoli after the scallops cooked and sauteed it a bit and it tasted wonderful.  Next time we may add some shrimp and use asparagus instead.  Try this simple recipe, it will bring out your creative side!

I was almost out of butter, so I used maybe 1/2 Tablespoon of butter and supplemented with olive oil. It turned out SO yummy, though I imagine that with all butter it would be even better. I sprinkled a tiny bit of cayenne on the top. I recommend!

Took suggestions of Mia and seared the scallops in garlic infused olive oil and then made a sauce with some butter, chicken stock and a little white wine.  Then added in some mushrooms asparagas and tomatoes.  Let that simmer and then added in the pasta.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it, even my picky kids.  Delicious, different and easy to make.

This was my first time making this recipe—and making scallops. I researched cleaning (rinse/pat dry) and cooking times (2 min per side if scallops rest at room temp first. To test if done, prick with fork; if done, fork will bounce back a little. If mushy cook a little longer). I just added this for any first-timers like me because these tips worked and the scallops were cooked perfectly. Anyway, I had 1 lemon, so I used fresh lemon juice. I did not have fresh garlic, so had to use my squeeze mince. Otherwise, I made according to the recipe and it was easy and delicious. When my mother taught me to cook over 40 years ago, her advice was to try a recipe as written the first time, then make any changes the next time. I still adhere to this unless I think there is an error or I know to tweak part of the technique along the way. Thank you for this simple, delicious recipe!

If you are going to try this dish, make sure you use FRESH GARLIC and FRESH LEMON JUICE, both of which I didn't have.  Will give this recipe one more try using the fresh ingreds. I mentioned otherwise it was just okay. Will rate this again.

Fantastic, and so simple!  I had never made scallops before, so I was looking for something easy and fast.  They came out perfectly, and the sauce is delicious!  Would be great over pasta.  I have a ton of fresh thyme growing, so I added some of that, and it made everything look pretty too.  ;)  My husband, who has never even had scallops (and was a little scared to try them, lol) even liked it!  Thank you very much for this simple and delicious recipe.

This was so fast and very very easy!  I didn't have fresh lemon juice so I used lemon pepper instead.  I also threw in some shrimp.  I think this would be good with mild white fish as well.  I served this with peas and Rosemount Traminer Riesling white wine.  Great pairing.

Great recipe! After browning the scallops in a 50/50 of EVOO and butter, I pulled the scallops.  I added some sauteed onions I had  left over from the previous night and a splash of Chardonnay to the pan, and added some cooked shrimp and cut asparagus. No lemon, so I dashed on some lemon pepper. I put the scallops back into the pan for a few minutes and served over pasta, along with a cilantro sourcream sauce. Five stars!

Very good. i think I used too much lemon (just eyeballed it), and I overcooked the scallops, but it was still very good.  I also added some half and half and a bit of flour to thicken the sauce.

These scallops are an easy weeknight family dinner. I may also try them over angel hair pasta as an app for company. The recipe's deliciousness is inversely proportional to its easiness - which in my mind is pretty much the perfect combo. And speaking of perfect pairings, we had it with a burgundy-style sauvignon blanc, dry and lemony. We followed some of Mia's tweaks, sauteeing shallots in with the garlic, adding white wine, plus a little flour to make a creamier sauce. We also added more lemon than the recipe calls for. At the table, we topped it with fresh grated parmesan and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. Parsley would have been great, too, if we'd had it on hand. Thanks for giving us a new family fave!

This was okay, but the butter could probably have been cut in half (and I like butter). I tried to make it exactly as written, but around here, I could only get what are probably medium-sized sea scallops (not like the huge ones I've gotten in restaurants). I served it on a bed of angel-hair pasta (as suggested by the recipe photo), and it lasted me for two big dinners. The taste was decent, but frankly, I was expecting something better - the generous amount of garlic was a bit drowned out by all the butter flavor, and I would've liked it better-balanced.

First time making (and only second time eating) scallops. My husband and I both loved the recipe.  I doubled all ingredients except for the scallops because we like more sauce.  I added a splash of sherry and some flour to thicken the sauce a little. I also added a tablespoon of parsley.

I think these are the best scallops I've ever had!  I love scallops and order them we we go out to eat, but I'm suprised I've never made them myself!  This recipe is super easy and simple - I've found that the best recipes are.  I made no changes and they came out superb.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

The scallops were cooked really nicely, but I thought that there was entirely too much butter! I used about a third of the amount with good results. I guess if you were going to serve these over plain pasta all that butter would be ok. I served these scallops over "No Cream Pasta Primavera" and it was a hit.

This is a yummy recipe. I think I would use smaller scallops the next time because my hubby is not a fan of the big ones and I have a hard time figuring out when the large ones are ready. But we both LOVED the sauce. I added more veggies and sauteed ciopponi onions, zucchini and squash in a separate pan then combined it all and served over angel hair pasta. Yum!!

Wonderful!  I cut WAY down on the butter and added a little olive oil, heated to very hot, added the garlic, then the scallops, and fried the scallops about 3 mins./side.  They browned beautifully!  Removed the scallops to a covered plate, added about 1/3 cup of white wine, reduced it, added lemon juice, pepper, and about a half tsp. of dried tarragon.  Poured over the scallops and enjoyed!  I know this all drastically changed the original recipe, but it's a five-star rating.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is pretty close to perfection.  It's one of those recipes where all the amounts of the ingredients are completely adjustable to taste.  I wanted my sauce full of lemon and garlic, and so added more of those, and once I took out the scallops I added a dollop more butter.  Rich, buttery, delicious and took just a few minutes.  I served it over angel hair pasta.

Easy and very tasty. The key is a high temp and patting your scallops dry. You also don't want to crowd your scallops.

Won my husband's approval! The lemon mixed with butter gave this dish a nick kick of flavor. I placed the scallops on cooked spaghetti noodles before pouring the sauce, and topped it off with chopped parsley to add some green color to the dish. My only mistake was cooking the scallops for too long (10 minutes total?). They seemed a little dry. Next time I would cook it for less time on the pan.

These were very good, I can see all sorts of possibilities with this recipe, adding angel hair, some asparagus or zucchini and pouring the sauce over would be dynamite! Thanks for a very easy quick recipe!

This was really easy and quick and really good! I used bay scallops since that's what I had. I cut way down on the butter and used EVOO along with it. I also seasoned the scallops with a bit of Old Bay and cayenne to give it a little kick and finished with chopped fresh parsley. Served over linguine and it was delish!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. One change I have made since finding it, I saute the scallops in a mixture of 1/2 butter, 1/2 chicken broth to cut back on the fat. It still has a wonderful taste and is much better for you. I use homemade chicken stock that I make ahead and freeze in ice cube trays for ease of use.

Very easy and very tasty.  I had lots of the buttery broth so this would be excellant served with a nice crusty french bread to dip into that broth.  I have added this to my permanent recipe file.

I made this last month using the exact specifications and I felt like it was worth only 4 stars. The reason for this is that I felt like it was missing something. Fast forward to last week. I remade my scallops using this recipe except this time I added a dash of fresh chopped basil and half a teaspoon of Sriracha. It was Fantastic. I highly recommend making these small alterations. :D

I made the mistake of getting scallops from the grocery store.  They turned out rubbery.  Make sure to use FRESH scallops that you can purchase from a seafood market, preferably right on the coast.

I didn't know scallops were so easy to make.  My scallops were kind of small but maybe I cooked the little dudes a bit too long.  Next time I'll strain the liquid that is with them in the bag.

Horrible meal.  By the time the scallops browned the garlic was a black tarry goo stuck to the bottom of the pan.  The lemon juice evaporated within ten seconds and I had to add. Half cup of white wine to get any kind of “sauce”.  Scallops were tough and dry and it took an hour to scour our the skillet after.

If you click on least positive review you'll learn what really happens---BOILS in SO MUCH butter! NOWHERE does it say to dry off scallops before putting in the pan like every other recipe in the world either. Should have known better but saw all the "great" reviews & the pic (NOT even a possible look if recipe followed) and handed it to husband, since so "easy". AWFUL. Saw the boiling EXPENSIVE scallops, took everything out of pan, blotted, with paper towels and then used common sense to sear. Thought I could trust reviews here but like everywhere else now, apparently not, though not sure what the point is.

Olive oil for half the butter.Garlic salt, Lemon Pepper, Old Bay,  and White Pepper.  I added a little bit of Riesling.  I also poured it over the pasta (Linguini or your choice, Angel Hair).  Sauce:  Leftover sauce from scallops.   1/2 cup of the starched pasta water, zest of 3 lemons and juice, and 1/2 a stick of butter for the sauce and put it all together.  Maybe drizzle a little bit of olive oil with it. When it's cooked,  Don't forget (store bought parmesan)  1/2 cup. mix that in with a little olive oil.  Then served with scallops over the pasta with  fresh Parmesan on top .

I always try the published recipes and measurements first  to see how it really comes out before making changes. Both my wife and I found this recipe most tasty ! Scallops do render a lot of water when cooked so I poured off most of it before adding the rest of the final ingredients.  Definitely will make this dish again!

It was very tasty but the garlic burned. You can’t sauté the garlic at medium high and then leave them in while cooking the scallops. Next time I will remove them until the end

Great recipe.  I used 1/2 Cup of butter as I didn't have quite 2 pounds of scallops.    The flavor was so fresh and good!  Will make again for sure!

Made them for my husband 2 weeks ago and he's been asking for them every since.  So glad I put the recipe in my favorites so I could find it again.  I used olive oil and butter for sautéing and removed the garlic as it turned brown.

Scallops done get browned with this method, but are poached instead in butter.  This recipe doesn’t work for this reason.

Made these for a party of 18 last weekend.  This was easy enough to pull off that amount.  Everyone was raving.  I added capers and made extra sauce to serve over angel hair :)

I cut the recipe in half and only used a dash of salt. It was delicious. I also served the sauce on the side rather than pouring it over the scallops.

I'm always afraid of overcooking scallops so mine were a bit pale.  Next time, I will not be afraid of using higher heat so they get browned.

The only problem was the scallops were to wet.  We tried to dry them prior to cooking but as they cooked a lot of liquid was produced.  We ended up transferring them to another pan that helped with the searing.  I was afraid they would be overcooked but they were still good.

I changed a bit and followed the most helpful review. First, I clarified the butter as I boiled bow-tie pasta. Then I drained most of the butter into a cup. I lightly salt & peppered the scallops (1 lb) and cooked them in the butter. When finished, I removed them to a plate. Deglazed skillet with white wine, and added shallots and garlic for 1 minute. I added the rest of the butter, lemon, salt, pepper, and capers. Then I added the pasta and finally the scallops.

Used this basic recipe and it was amazing!  I did change things up a bit though.  First, I halved the recipe for just the 2 of us and cooked and crumbled a few bacon strips.  After searing the scallops and removing them so they did not become over-cooked, I added the bacon,  lemon juice, about 1/2 cup chicken broth and about the same amount of chardonnay, 2 chopped green onions and served on spaghetti with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.    Served with a colorful salad with raspberry vinaigrette and a crunchy bread.  Have absolutely never had anything so beautiful or tasty in any restaurant that served scallops in my life!  Thanks for the wonderful basic recipe and the suggestions of many reviewers!

Excellent and simple.  I followed instructions to the letter and guests commented it was restaurant quality.  Only advice is not to cook the scallops too long (for the ones I used it took @2 minutes per side).  Definitely a home run - on my first time out with scallops and no one had the slightest idea!!!

The gentle lemony sauce made these sea scallops great. I followed the recipe without any changes, and the meal was loved by all. My husband and granddaughter were fighting over the last few. No leftovers. Will definitely make again

This was excellent and definitely quick to whip up.  I do love capers so I added them to the garlic and butter.  I also did as other reviewers suggested and after the scallops were done, I added some EVOO and butter to the pan and threw in some asparagus and mushrooms.  OMG!  To die for!!  I served it on a bed of wild rice.  Definitely a keeper!!!

This was very good, very easy.  I slightly browned the garlic in the butter, added the small scallops.  After about 4 minutes I added some chicken broth and parsley and lemon juice, just to make it saucier.  I had to add Wondra gravy flour to thicken my extra sauce, then served it all over fettucine.  I'll make it again, with more garlic and probably cilantro rather than parsley.

Excellent recipe.  My version:  Cooked garlic in mixture of butter & olive oil.  Removed garlic.  Sauted scallops, added salt and a dash of red pepper flakes and some dried parlsey.  Removed scallops when ALMOST done.  Added lemon juice to the pan along with a little chicken broth & fresh broccoli flowers.  Covered and steamed broccoli until crisp tender.  Returned scallops to pan along with some cooked pasta.  Heated very slowly until all ingredients were warm.  EXCELLENT & so easy.  The red pepper flakes do kick it up a bit, but just use a little.  Be careful not to overcook the scallops.

3/4 cups of butter is so much butter the scallops drown...not possible to turn them, and therefore they never brown.  And way too much garlic.  Think maybe scallops are better eaten in seafood restaurants.

Great flavor. My sauce got a little dry. I left the scallops too long on the frypan. Should have indicated it in the recipe. Other than that, easy and yummy.

great! made the following modifications ... half butter/half evoo. sauteed the garlic. added fresh lime (out of lemon) ... turned off heat and added scallops (had frozen bay in the freezer ... as long as you don't cook them too long, they stay nice and tender). when the scallops firmed up added all into cooked whole wheat fettuccine. it disappeared!!

Reminiscent of a scallop dish I had McCormick and Schmick's.  Just shows that you shouldn't invest in eating out too much.  Be wary of adding too much lemon juice.  It can make the dish bitter.  I also seared both sides of the scallops before adding them to the butter/garlic mixture.

A nice, easy way to do scallops. This recipe calls for more salt than I like, so add it slowly. Otherwise, very good - thanks!

I'm a rookie cook and I nailed it.  Added some chopped green onions for cooking and presentation.  Great recipe, easy, quick and tasty.

I made this for my husband and toddler tonight following the recipe almost exactly. I added a bunch of asparagus, mushrooms and a red pepper, so increased the sauce by 25%. I used a bag of frozen scallops (the littles ones) and served on penne. At first it was a little bland, but as the sauce soaked into the pasta it got better. My husband rated it a 4, but I don't think it will join our regular rotation of meals, it was still missing something (no pizazz) and that's alot of butter for one meal.

Very good. I made as directed but halved the recipe as I only had 1 lb of scallops. I made Orzo with Parmesean & basil from this site on the side. This recipe was easy & quick. I will make again. Thanks!

Came out DELISH!!!   I followed reviewer Mia’s changes except I used a pre made  garlic olive oil. Didn’t have asparagus so I used some leftover sautéed Brussels.  Also used sun dried tomatoes.  Followed all other changes Mia used.  Sauce is scrumptious!   I will definitely be making this again.!

So easy to make. So delicous. I made these scallops as a side dish for a rib-eye steak for Valentine's Day dinner. I may try next time ad an open-faced sandwich topped with oyster/baby bella mushrooms in butter and white wine. Tjank you for a super easy recipe.

Made it as directed. Used fresh chopped garlic. Wonderful! The garlic bits ended up chewy and carmelized, almost candied. I served it with Cacio E Pepe. Everyone loved it, even the kids!

I made these for dinner last night and  modified the recipe to work with one pound of scallops. They were fantastic! Absolute perfection. I would absolutely make them again and it's a great recipe for a company meal. All evening we were talking about how good they were!

Love this recipe.  Easy and quick to make.  I didn't use as much butter (1/2 cup)  and it was still just as good. I've made this before and will continue to use this as a "go to" recipe.

I hagad 1 pound of scallops. Sprinkled with salt and cayenne, seared in basil inflused olive oil and garlic.  Stirred in 1/4 cup flour, then added 2 tbsps butter, lemon juice, a little chicken broth, 2 tbsp parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of Italian seasoning.  Served over linguine.  My husband was very skeptical of the lemon juice with pasta, but he loved it and so did I.

I had a great scallop recipe saved and when I went to look for it  I couldn't find it. I found this one that was similar so I tried it. BIG mistake this recipe was WAAAAAAAAAAY tooooooo lemony and this is coming from a person who loves lemon. IF I make it agai I will cut the lemon way down. That's the problem with Allrecipes you never know how bad a recipe is until you make it and you can't rely on the reviews because everyone's taste is different.

Not sure if I did something wrong (I really don’t think so) but my garlic burned. I saw a comment from someone else and they removed the garlic before cooking the scallops-I recommend doing that. Otherwise you’ll end up like me-I can’t even make the sauce...sad

So simple and delicious. I did add a splash of white wine as someone had suggested. I was a little nervous about cooking them correctly. I did them about 2 minutes on each side and then a little. I took one out and cut into it to make sure they were cooked.

Highly delicious and very buttery! My helpful hint would be to make sure that you don't use 3/4 cup of salted butter, or the sauce will come out to salty. Use unsalted butter. Otherwise, the recipe is perfect!

I didn't have that much butter so I used a butter/coconut oil combination, it was great! I just squirted my lemon juice into the pan and didn't measure, I couldn't really taste it so I don't think it was enough, next time I'll measure!

I only needed to make 2 servings.  Based on that I adjusted the recipe for that proportion  and followed it step by step.  They were the best scallops I personally have ever made.  Cooked to perfection!
I served them with mushrooms and zucchini pesto marinated kabobs, cooked on the grill and  served with a garlic butter sauce.  Yum, Yum.

The recipe was good but needed a tiny bit of pizazz to become great.

I reduced the butter to 1 stick (1/3 Cup) which was plenty, and added a cup of chopped flat italian parsley and allowed to bubble and soften, then added garlic careful not to burn. Then added the rest of the ingredients along with  a 1/4 tsp of tiny shredded lemon zest. Once the scallops were browned on both sides, I flabayed the dish with about a 1/2 of suaveningon blanc (white wine). I loved it and the kids loved it.

I originally  thought this called for way too much butter as the scallops seemed to almost boil in the butter. But they where delicious. We served them over fresh Tagliarelle  pasta with Truffle butter and topped it off with fresh parmigiana. This will be one our special dishes we serve our guests.

To cook scallops fast, the skillet gets too hot for the butter, garlic, lemon (and I added finely chopped parsley and chives) as a sauce. My advice is to cook the sauce separately. It needs to be clear and buttery, not burnt and crisp. Divide and conquer. Also added fine mashed potatoes, and soft-ish asparagus with fresh peach slices. Just put the peach slices on the asparagus when served. That will warm them slightly. You will be amazed how beautifully the peaches work with everything -- including the scallops. This is a 5-star, but not if you use the butter and garlic from the scallops as the sauce. Enjoy!

Quick and easy to make, however, it was difficult for a first time scallop maker to know when they were done. The recipe itself was delicious and fast.

This is an excellent recipe that brings out the natural deliciousness of scallops.  I made it as written but would make some minor changes the next time.  Spray the pan with cooking spray rather than oil and butter.  Heat pan before adding scallops.  After scallops are cooked, place in serving dish that has been warming in a 300 degree oven.  Return them to the oven while you make the sauce.  Now add butter and oil to saute garlic and then lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over scallops.   I served over jasmine rice with sauteed thinly sliced zucchini, onions and garlic seasoned with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper and sprinkled with grated Romano cheese.  Delicious!

So very simple for this non-cook.  Flavors were great.  Served it on a bed of wilted kale.

This was so delicious that the rest of my family made toast to soak every last bit of the sauce. I didn't get my butter as brown as they show in the video, so I think I need to set the burner a bit higher next time. And there will definitely be a next time.

I bought some scallops at Costco.  I had never made them before, so I tried this recipe and it worked out well.  The recipe seems suited for some creativity, so I'll tweak it a bit to spice it up a little next time.

Absolutely wonderful.  Be sure to use good butter.  I've been cutting back and using olive oil in recipes - but this was worth the "cheat".  
Will make again.

I deglazed with a buttery Chardonnay and sprinkled some organic unseasoned breadcrumbs in the final sauté and made a roux for a thicker sauce.  This is a really good base recipe.

I made this following the recipe.  I found this to be very uninteresting and a poor use of expensive scallops. I gave a two star because my husband liked it.

Amazing! This is the first time I've made scallops and so glad I used this recipe as a base. I replaced butter with olive oil and added shrimp. I also sautéed separately zucchini, mushrooms and asparagus and mixed in the fish and lemon sauce and served over rice. Topped with parmesan cheese.

Very easy and very tasty.  Less than 10 minutes start to finish and everyone wanted more.  We used crusty French bread to get every bit of sauce, but rice or pasta would be good, also.  Definitely will make again.

This is a good go-to weeknight meal.  Don't cook the scallops as long as the recipe suggests as they will get tough and chewy. Three minutes on each side should be enough taking them out of the pan as soon as they become opaque.

Scallops are so easy to overcook but these came out great.  We like spicy so a tad heavy on the red pepper flakes but otherwise exactly as prescribed.

Loved it! After making as directed, I removed the scallops and add steamed strings beans to the pan so it can get some of that delicious buttery lemony sauce on it.

Don't need as much butter as called for. In fact, if you use maybe a third of the amount suggested, the scallops will properly crisp up. Otherwise, they kinda boil in the butter which is fine, just not as tasty.

I followed CruiseM's  note, but removed the scallops and added a little flour to the garlic butter before adding the white wine and capers.  Was fantastic!

We were in a hurry tonight and this was a snap to make! I must tell you I am never a fan of scallops. I would make it again but I will try some other new recipes too.  My husband said he’d give it a 4 Star. So... you take it from there.

Extremely simple recipe. Be careful not to cook to long as the scallops will not be soft enough and may be slightly chewy. We did about 5 min per side. Sauce is delicious over pasta.

So easy and super yum!   Added capers at the end for a bit of saltiness.  Best to use similar sized scallops for an even cook.   Will make this again for sure!

I made this delicious recipe twice and followed it exactly as written both times.  Yes, there is a lot of butter, but it is needed to conduct the heat and sear the scallops.  If the butter is too much, leave it in the pan and enjoy the seared scallops without the extra sauce.  But if you want a real treat, pour the delicious butter over your scallops, rice or pasta.  Hint - don't turn the scallops until they are ready - no peaking and you will get a perfectly seared scallop.

I added a couple tablespoons of marsala wine. It balanced out the lemon and made the sauce slightly thicker.

This recipe was amazing!! Very simple but with a lot of taste. I’ve never made scallops before so I looked it up on all recipes,,, guess what ! Found it made it! Delicious.
My only regret is that I didn’t take a picture.  My husband loved it. I made pasta and poured the scallops and the lemon sauce  over them. Thanks  again for the delicious recipe.

Delicious!!!! Only thing I changed is that after cooking the scallops, I pours the butter out and used new butter. For the new butter, I used more minced garlic, salt & pepper. Then, I pit the scallops back in the pot and added the lemon.

Made as directed, but had trouble with garlic burning while trying to complete the 10 minute cook time at medium high. I reduced heat to medium, and still reached internal temperature of 165F in 10 minutes

This recipe is very good and easy. To suit it to my taste, I think I will reduce the amount of salt and butter if making half the recipe.

Reduced the recipe to 1 serving. Melted butter with a bit of EVOO  in the cast iron, browned the scallops then turned off heat before adding the garlic. Turned out well. Simple and delicious!

It tastes great!  My scallops are frozen and has lots of water when I cook them. Does anyone have any suggestion on getting rid of the water before I cook them?

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was super good.  I love scallops and get them in restaurants whenever I can but I can honestly say that this beat them all.  I served them over the frozen veggie spaghetti made from zucchini and lentils in olive oil.  I placed the scallops over the spaghetti and poured the butter mixture over the scallops.  I added a sprinkle of parmesan after it was plated and it was wonderful.  The dish is simple and really easy to make. Be sure to cook on a medium to hot stovetop because you will not get a nice golden crusty sear if it is not hot enough.

I love simple and good and this is right on!  One thing that is not mentioned in the recipe is to dry the scallops.  Works much better.  Easy to adjust to smaller amounts too....I did just 1 dozen .

Note that you can use grease as a sauce.

Made this using  fresh garlic and fresh lemons and it was very flavorful. I chopped up and sautéed fresh spinach with  green, yellow and  red peppers in it  as a side dish and it was a delicious meal.

I made this and liked the ease and flavors.  I made it as written and I think having the heat high enough to sear and cook the scallops properly causes the garlic to burn, making the butter sauce bitter.  Next time I will warm the garlic to flavor the oil/butter and then take it out as others suggested.  I think that will definitely make this a five star recipe.

I suggest that you stop by the local Chinese resturant and pick up some vegatable fried rice to pair with these scallops.

I love this recipe. It's quick and easy.  I made it as written the first time, but found it a bit too lemony for my taste.  I recommend going light on the lemon juice and omitting the lemon zest shown in the video. To keep the scallops from turning rubbery, cook no longer than 2 minutes a side at medium high heat.

Using the recipe exactly as written makes an easy and very tasty way to prepare scallops. This is my go to recipe for scallops.

I was disappointed with this recipe. butter burns before you can get a good sear on the scallops. olive oil would have been a better choice

Delicious! We added extra garlic because we like protecting ourselves against imaginary vampires. We made the recipe as is but think the white wine would be an excellent addition.

Fry the scallops with some cooking oil on high heat and NOT butter because butter will burn and turn dark brown, after searing the scallops remove them aside then add the butter, garlic and other stuff to make the sauce then return the scallops into the sauce, simmer 2 min max and serve.

Made this the other night for the two of us, so I used about 3/4 lb. of sea scallops. I was serving wild rice with them, so I figured I'd make the full amount of sauce, to ladle over the rice. It was really good, and I'll be making it again over the holidays for my 92-year-old father, along with Scampi!

A quick and easy recipe.  I coated scallops in panko to add texture and added 1/4 cup dry white wine. Allowed sauce to thicken slightly then added back cooked scallops and cooked pasta.  Sreved topped with favorite Italian cheese. Very easy meal.

I wanted something different for supper and gave this a try since my husband and me love scallops. It was really good just as the recipe called. Husband finished off the remainder so I have no picture to post but I suppose that is proof that it was a hit!

I've made this twice and it came out poorly the second time. But: I was at sea level the first time and in Denver the second. Also the scallops I bought the first time were very small and the bag called for them to be cooked frozen, the second time I had very large scallops that were supposed to be thawed ahead of cooking (which I didn't see until right before I started the recipe.) The first version I made came out perfectly and really mimicked lobster.  The second one (at altitude) was definitely not as good. I had to cook the scallops a whole lot longer (because of the altitude and the size of the scallops.) The garlic browned eventually and the scallops just never firmed up right (even after adding a minute in the microwave after I plated it. It just took forever to cook them.) It ended up a pretty lackluster dinner the second time. I will be happy to make this again with the smaller scallops at home at sea level. I will not bother with this recipe next time I'm in Denver though.

The original recipe was missing something. The 2nd time I made it, I added some white cooking wine (2-3 tablespoons) which added lots of flavor.

I followed some of the other reviews and added half and half with fresh parsley to the lemon butter sauce.  Served it over angel hair pasta and it was delicious! Everyone loved it.   Will definitely make this one again.

So I made this exactly as the recipe but put it on top of some sauteed veggies (mushrooms, summer squash, and zucchini) and poured the sauce right over it. I sauteed the veggies with butter and olive oil and added a smidgen more of minced garlic. Combined with the sauce and the scallops, with an orzo salad to go as a side, it was absolutely delicious!

Easy, Easy, Easy and very tasty. I tweeted this recipe a little added chives and lemon peel. Lots of garlic but it made the dish.

I followed this recipe exactly and must say they were the best scallops I've ever cooked!
I wouldn't change a thing!

My husband raved over this.  It is quick and easy. I added shrimp too.   I lightly coated the shrimp and scallops with grated parmesan first.  And I took other reviewers advice and added about 1/3 cup of Chardonnay and 2 Tbs of flour to thicken the sauce a little.  I used fresh garlic and Minute Maid real lemon juice.  This will be a go to recipe for me now.

Made this tonight and we loved it.  I modified the recipe.  I used 3 tablespoons of virgin olive oil instead of butter. I cooked the garlic in the olive oil for about 3 minutes, then removed all the garlic to a bowl.  Then seared the scallops and when done put them on a plate.  Re-added garlic to same pan, added 4 tablespoons of lemon juice, salt and pepper and simply warmed that until the mixture was hot.  Poured that on top of the scallops.  Delicious!!

Note: if possible, use dry scallops.  Store bought scallops have a chemical mixture they sit in that makes them almost impossible to sear/brown.

Made exactly as written.  You will not be disappointed.  I used elephant garlic, which is sweeter and more mild than regular garlic and we loved it!  I too made a triple batch and served with angel hair pasta.

I made this tonight. The only thing I did differently is I added a little flour to thicken the sauce a bit per another member's review suggestion. I did find that there was WAY too much butter in my pan. I ended up butter poaching the scallops rather than getting any kind of nice sear on them. I drained most of the liquid off mid recipe but it was too late. I would use maybe 1/4 of the butter to cook with but melt the remainder to have enough sauce.

Great recipe and a great base for improvisation! I made a few changes just to use up what I had in the fridge. I pan seared the scallops in avocado oil & removed. I then followed the recipe but added sliced mushrooms & asparagus spears, covered until cooked through. I served over parparadelle pasta. Hubby & I loved it. A definite repeat! Thank you!

I added white wine.  Wished I had removed garlic before adding scallops as garlic started to burn before scallops seared.  Would make again but probably add more liquid and serve over pasta

I don't eat any seafood so have a very hard time cooking what I won't taste.  Hubby raved about his one.  I cut down the butter and added olive oil to lighten it up.  I used about a tsp of lemon pepper.  I also thickened the sauce with a bit of flour and served over angel hair pasta.  I know I will have to make this again. Thank you.

I used the tiny bay scallops - 1 pound and adjusted the other ingredients to apply to 2 servings. It was great! I used bottled lemon juice (lazy) and that worked fine. I've also tried it with shrimp (16/20 size) - great, too!

Awesome.  I didn't have a lot of scallops, but still made a full batch of sauce and poured it over our pasta.  I added some fresh diced tomatoe for some fresh vegetable taste.

This was my first time making scallops and they were delicious! I changed up the sauce by adding white wine to the butter/lemon juice and reduced it to make a thicker sauce and it came out really nice. I wish there were more sauce so next time I will add in chicken broth as well as the wine and I think that will help with the issue I had with the flavor being too lemony.

Very yummy. We added a little bit of white wine, fresh parsley and it came out perfect! Will for sure do this one again.

Wonderful recipe.  I sauteed the scallops in basil olive oil with a pat of butter.  I seasoned them with a touch of chili powder also.  I then removed and sauteed onion, garlic, yellow and orange bell peppers, green onion, and added a touch of crushed red pepper.  With the lemon juice it was amazing!

Very good.  Will definitely be making this again.  I used bay scallops because we prefer them. I poured it over speghetti and we sure did enjoy it.  Thanks for another keeper Button.

Too buttery for our family....I tried to reduce the butter and substitute olive oil but it didn't help.  My husband and I found it to be okay but our three kids didn't care for it all.

Delicious and super easy. Served with angel hair pasta tossed in butter and sprinkled with some fresh parsley and grated parmigiano reggiano cheese.

I'm a fairly inexperienced cook, and decided to try this because of the few ingredients and the scallops (my husband LOVES them).  I served them over whole-wheat pasta, and it was wonderful.  This is a great quick-and-easy weekday recipe.

There is nothing that smells as good as scallops sauteeing in a pan.  These tasted as good as they smelled.  I followed some of the recommendations by others and added some white wine, flat leaf parsley and the juice of two lemons.  I served it over fettucine and cooked some broccoli into the pasta water.  So this ended up a one-dish meal of scallops, pasta and broccoli.  My husband's comment was "this is great!"  I will definitely make this again.

Great flavor, everyone enjoyed the scallops. 5* for quickness and simplicity! Only thing I added was a dash of basil for the sauce.

This was ok. Too much butter for my taste, and the "sauce" poured over after was inconsistent and gritty. My boyfriend complained about it (which he NEVER does) NExt time, I'll go with a more simple recipe, but how much simpler can it get..

I love this simpe fast dish or appatizer. I modify it by adding just a little more lemon juice and fresh cilantro. It is wonderful like that and the way it is.
