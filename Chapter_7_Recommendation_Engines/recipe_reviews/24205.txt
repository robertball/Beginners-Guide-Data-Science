I make this every year at Christmas time. It's my families all time favourite! The only thing I change is that I sprinkle the icing sugar over the cookies from a sifter rather than rolling them in it. I found the sugar got too chunky that way.

These are fantastic cookies. I have made them for years as "Hidden Kiss Cookies," a recipe my college roommate's mother would send in Care Packages. It is the cookie my family dreams of--they swoon when I make them! It is helpful to chill the formed cookies for 30 minutes or so, and NEVER use an insulated pan or you'll wind up with one cookie with chocolate lumps across the cookie sheet.

My kids LOVE these cookies (so do my husband and I)!  We had a little assembly line going of unwrapping candy, scooping dough, and wrapping the kisses so our whole family could help.

These are the favorite cookie in my household.  I make them with almonds too (change the vanilla to 3/4 vanilla and 1/4 vanilla extract.) Everyone loves them!

Be sure to refrigerate shaped cookies in the fridge for about an hour. Otherwise, the cookies will "spread" while baking.

I found this recipe back in 1981 and it is one of my all time favorite cookies. Makes a special treat for co workers, bosses and now that I have kids in school teachers and special staff members. 
I have also used the Hersey's Hugs and the bite size Snickers and Milky Way's and other bite size candys. 
This will become one of those recipes you DO NOT want to share and only pass on to family.
Two thumbs up and finger licking good.

These cookies reminded me of Danish wedding cookies, with the exception of the hershey's kiss inside.  They were quite good. I handed them out in a cookie gift basket I made for Christmas, and lots of people liked them.  I also added someone colored sugar to make them Christmassy.  
One caution, this recipe does not make a lot of cookies.  I only got about 33 cookies.  Also, these cookies do not stay round.  They have a flat bottom and a rounded top from the baking process.  I would love to know how to keep them round for the next time I make them if anyone has any suggestions.

Great recipe!!  Be sure the dough is COLD when working with it, and if possible , cold when they go into the oven.  I also found that a tablespoon is too much dough to wrap the kisses in.  My first batch came out looking like top hats, half the tablespoon and they turn out perfectly.  My dad can't eat nuts so I made a special batch for him with out the walnuts and they were just as good.  A really big hit at Valintine's!!

Delicious...but definitely chill dough.  I didn't with my first batch and what a mistake.  They completely fell apart and looked horrible.  The dough is great!  It tastes almost like a cream cheese cookie!  The kiss inside is a nice little present when you bite into it!

These are my new favorite cookie. I did find that when I mixed up the dough it needed a little moisture so I added approx 1 tablespoon of milk and it held together really well (I didn't measure, so use your judgment). Anyway, if you like russian teacakes and chocolate you will LOVE this. They will be on my list for Christmas cookies every year!

These were very easy to make, great to let the kids help out.  I used about 3/4 of the amount of nuts called for and they tasted yummy!  They are best when eaten warm.

These have everything I like in a cookie - rich and buttery with chocolate!  The fiddly part where the dough is moulded around the chocolate kiss is worthwhile as the result is so good.  I will continue to make these.

I love this cookie.  My mom used to make these every Christmas but when I wanted to make them this year I couldn't find her recipe.  These taste just like hers did and I'm so happy!!  YUMMY!  My daughter enjoyed unwrapping all of the Kisses (and sneaking a few herself).

This recipe has been a big hit!  I have used it for Christmas the past two years and plan to use it again this year.
