I liked the idea of this for a Christmas breakfast.  It tasted good.  However, the pancakes were very heavy.  A little bit goes a long way.  I followed the recipe, except added an additional teaspoon of baking powder per another reviewer's recommendation.   It is nice for an occasional change of pace.  Thanks for sharing.

I flip-flopped the amount of flour and eggnog and added a teaspoon of rum extract and a sprinkle of nutmeg. I served them with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. Very tasty pancakes but flat. Next time I make these, I'll increase the baking powder by an extra teaspoon.

These were good,..thick, and unusual,..but I thought Hey,..its Christmas why not?! One thing I did do that really made it was I infused my syrup with nutmeg and cinn. really brought out the flavors in the pancake, and pulled them together.

Overall, these are good. And you can alter the recipe to your tastes. After reading some reviews about the batter being thick, I decided to do 1/2 milk and 1/2 eggnog - and you could still totally taste the eggnog in the end. I added some nutmeg, too. They taste like regular pancakes w/ a bit of eggnog flavor. Good texture, too. If you like eggnog (I love it), then you'll probably like these.

These were awesome! They were so fluffy and flavorful. Great with maple syrup.  I had to cook them on a low heat. Once I got the heat right they turned out wonderful.  I will use this recipe again. When i poured the batter into the pan I spread it out thinner with the spoon. I noticed they cooked more even by spreading it out in the pan...Thankyou. Bergandy

My family LOVED this big, soft, fluffy pancake.  I actually made 2 different ‘Eggnog Pancake’ recipes from AR.  This one was the winner.  I made as written, but didn’t oil the griddle before frying.  I placed the batter on a dry griddle.  The pancakes came out so nice a plump and cooked very even.  I made a double batch and froze them.  My guys just reheated in the microwave for a quick, warm breakfast.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I tried these with some organic eggnog and they were really tasty.  They have a fairly high sugar content so I used a less-hot pan to keep them from burning.  The batter was fairly thick which made the pancakes thick and fluffy.  Even with the sweetness from the egg nog, we still added syrup!

No syrup needed! Left the recipe as is however I used a cast iron skillet! No time for bubbles I think I had the pan to hot lowered to medium. My suggestion when you flip squish with the spatula or they will be raw in the center

Easy and delicious. My family loves eggnog so this was a no brainer. I tweaked it based on previous reviews by using 2 teaspoons baking powder and adding a splash of whole milk and a couple of pinches of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I spread out the batter a little with a spoon. Cooking on medium heat worked.  They're pretty sweet, so in the future based on how sweet the eggnog is, I may leave out the sugar.

Add an egg! I tried this as written, cooked a small sample and found it to be very heavy/dense. So, I added a beaten egg to the rest of the batter, which lightened it up very nicely. Great, delicate flavor.

I thought the recipe could use an egg, so I beat an egg in a measuring cup, then added enough eggnog to equal 1-1/4 cup. I also added a dash of nutmeg. The pancakes came out great. My husband and son liked them.

I like eggnog but I usually thin mine down with some milk. So that's what I did with this. I added about 1/4 cup milk to thin it down and It still had plenty taste but less filling. Anybody that likes eggnog will like this.

What a wonderful idea for pancakes.  I used leftover eggnog, and I could not find my baking soda so I used all purpose flour instead so that it would not be an issue.  I also added three pinches of nutmeg to the batter.  What a wonderful holiday treat.

went straight into the trash! The kids wouldn't even eat these. Waaaaay too much egg nog. Batter was too thick and I couldn't get them to cook all the way through, even on low heat. they were sticky in the middle. Also stuck to the pan pretty easily- had to keep oiling the pan.

Beautiful, fluffy, and thick pancakes with lots of eggnog flavor! So good with a touch of cinnamon maple syrup. Will make every year when we have eggnog.

I did make some changes. I didn't use as much flour and I also did use the baking soda, and all of that other stuff because the flour had all the stuff incorporated into it. I also could smell the eggnog, but I couldn't taste it.

We are stuck inside due to the wildfire smoke and can’t go to the store. We made several substitutes to this recipe and stumbled upon, what my kids are calling, “the best pancake recipe ever”. We used coconut oil instead of vegetable because we didn’t have vegetable oil. We didn’t have egg nog, but my son says egg nog is just like milk and we had almond milk. I did 1cup almond milk, 1/4 cup French vanilla creamer and a tablespoon of brown sugar in place of the egg nog. I was nervous. We kept everything else the same. They are wonderful! I will definitely be making these again.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. They did not turn out very well at all. They stuck to the pan and were extremely difficult to flip. The ones that did survive tasted decent. I won’t make this recipe again and will continue my search for an egg nog pancake recipe.

These were way too heavy for me. I was expecting more  eggnog taste too. Absorbed the syrup like a sponge. I did use homemade eggnog as opposed to the store bought if that made a difference. I won't be making these again.

These were great! I made them with Kemps light eggnog. I did add a sprinkle of extra nutmeg and an extra 1/4 tsp of baking powder. My son picked out the eggnog aroma right away. My girl loves all things eggnog and was really impressed.

I liked this recipe, but knew my family would need to taste some spice.  I added both cinnamon and nutmeg and they were great.  I like a fluffier pancake so I couldn't give this recipe 5 stars.

I like this is a base recipe, though I did make the changes recommended including adding nutmeg to taste, adding a teaspoon more of baking soda, and subbing a beaten egg for some of the eggnog. I also used So Delicious coconut eggnog instead of regular. And since I am not really big on plain pancakes, I added two diced apples. The pancake batter is pretty heavy; the apples helped lighten the experience and were a nice combo with the eggnog taste. Didn't need anything but butter for a tasty Christmas breakfast.

Used slightly more eggnog.  Batter was just a bit too thick.  Nearly just as easy to mix up as the packaged mix.

Didn't change a thing. I will definitely be making this again,  it is perfect for left over eggnog.

I used Evan Williams Eggnog and served with walnuts and homemade blueberry syrup. I always add a surprise fried egg, over-easy, to the middle of any pancake stack. Pancakes reheat so well refrigerated or frozen so I make extra while the griddle is hot.

These were amazing! I was hesitant at first because the batter was so dense and did not spread on the pan. I also accidentall burnt them because they took so long to cook. And STILL they were amazing. I can't cook for the life of me, so if you can figure out how to lighten the batter, these are the perfect pancakes. So rich with egg nog, it went perfectly with syrup.

Wow, these were tasty! When I first read the recipe I thought "that's too much eggnog" but after whipping up the batch with a bit more flour and only 1 cup of eggnog, I had to add more eggnog. My batter was still really, really thick but they taste great! I didn't have the problem with them being flat at all, almost too puffy. Maybe some eggnog is thicker than others?
