I didn't have real maple syrup but used pancake syrup.  Cookies weren't very sweet so I put a brown sugar icing on them.  They were better with the icing.  I may try making these with karo syrup and using other flavorings like lemon or coconut, all with icicng.

I just baked these and they are delicious!  I love maple syrup and it gave the shortbread that extra flavour.  I also thought the dough was a bit more like a batter so I just added more flour so it was a bit more manageable to shape into balls.  As the other reviews had said it wasn't sweet enough, I added a little sugar to the butter whilst creaming, about a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a tad more maple syrup than the recipe called for.  I also sprinkled some demerara sugar over them before they went in the oven.  I knew they would be good as the smell from the oven was fantastic.  Will definitely make these again!  Thanks :)

These cookies are great. I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar because the previous reviews said they added sugar, I suggest to add sugar it makes it sweet but not too overbearing. I also used fresh maple syrup from an organic market, not the bottled kind, if you can get your hands on some fresh maple syrup it makes the cookies that much better!! I also used just a little less butter, everyone loves them!

These are easy and fast to make. I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on the tops before baking.  They taste very good!

Really light, sweet and mapley! After reading the reviews, I added the following to the recipe as well as rolling the balls in organic cane sugar before baking:
-add'l 1/4c maple syrup
-1/4c organic brown sugar

Very simple and delicious recipe, thank you!

Tasty, light and definitely shortbread.  The only problem was that they didn't taste as maple syrupy as I had hoped, even with an extra 1/4 cup of maple syrup.

So good and so simple! I wanted cookies but my ingredients were limited because we're moving. I happened to have real maple syrup and oat and rice flours. I even had to cream the syrup and butter by hand because I already packed my mixer but the cookies turned out! Because other reviewers said they weren't sweet enough, I put some white sugar on the first batch. The second batch I didn't and both were pleasantly sweet. I will definitely make these again :)

I thought these cookies were really good. I don't know what people are talking about being boring. they are a shortbread cookie they don't need to be too sweet. they were just right.

followed the recipe exactly. perhaps that was the downfall. ended up with boring pancake cookies and the incredibly subtle maple flavor completely disappeared once the cookies were cooled. :(

Good cookies, added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 2 TBLSP. of sugar, a little extra flour and after one batch cooked I added chopped walnuts to the batter and that made them extra yummy!  Next time I will add walnuts to the whole batch.

These cookies are delicious. They are great "adult cookies" because they aren't too sweet, with just a light maple flavouring. They go very well with tea. My kids aren't too fond of them, because they aren't sweet enough for them, but us "grown-ups" love them. I do suggest that you at least double the amount of syrup it asks for, because I did that, and the maple was still quite faint.

OK, so I'm testing out unique cookie recipes in preparation for the holidays, so first I halved this recipe.  Then, I made a few changes as suggested by reviewers: a bit more flour, a bit more maple syrup, a bit less butter and a good bit of brown sugar to taste as I prepped the dough.  I made the balls the size of large filberts rather than walnuts and this gave me a good dozen even with just a half recipe.  Then, I put a sliced almond in the middle of each.   I, too love maple flavor and I did use real maple syrup in these.  Shortbread, on the other hand...meh.  They took 7 and a half minutes to cook at this size.  Hmmm, even with the additional brown sugar and maple syrup, not as mapley as I'd like.   They are softer than shortbread, so that is nice.  I'd make them again if I could find little mini maple chips to mix in.  I think that would be a nice touch and add to the subtle maple buttery taste.  This is a fun basic recipe to play around with-- thanks!

I found this recipe in an attempt to clear out my pantry before going home for Christmas break. That being said, I unfortunately did not have maple syrup, just honey. I subbed that in (with vanilla extract, of course) and they turned out amazing. The texture and taste were spot on. Wish I could have made them with maple syrup!

Simple and delicious! I used grade B maple syrup which is more nutritious and I put a pecan on top. Everyone liked them. Thank you!

This recipe is pretty good, but I'm not sure if it is for all tastes. If you want something that screams maple this is probably not for you.

Not a bad recipe. Really easy & quick. Looked more like a batter than a dough when I first mixed it up, but when I chilled it in the fridge, I had no trouble rolling it out and cutting into shapes with cookie cutters. Only problem was I think I would have liked it a little sweeter; I'll try sprinkling the next batch with some sugar on top.

This just became my go-to for shortbread! We are diabetic so I used Cary's brand sugar-free syrup and 1/4 tsp maple flavour. I pressed it into a 8x8 pan and baked at 325 for 50 mins, though it could have gone a bit longer. My daughter couldn't tell it was sugar-free! USE ROOM TEMPERATURE SYRUP and make sure to cream your butter and syrup thoroughly!  If you have difficulty creaming your butter and syrup together, leave it to warm up.

Not too impressed. I thought these would be great. I love shortbread, but they were not sweet at all and I could hardly tasted the maple syrup.

I added just a few drops of maple flavoring as well. I found the second batch easier to form into balls as I refrigerated the dough while the first batch baked. We liked these because they are not overly sweet. If making for others I may frost with some type of maple cream. Will definitely make again.

I made 1/2 of the recipe to test  the recipe and added about 1/8 teaspoon maple extract to half of the dough which was 6 cookies. (6 cookies didn't have extract) We really liked the maple extract addition rather than the plain half which didn't have the extract. I also sprinkled on a light coating of maple sugar mixed with raw sugar before they were cooked to give it a little extra sweetness.

Added about an extra cup of flour so that it was more dough-like. It turned out really good and I will definitely be making this again!

I made as is and then with 3 tablespoons added brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon powdered fenugreek spice. I preferred the slightly sweeter version but still enjoyed the first as a more classic shortbread for tea. Fenugreek has a distinct maple flavor but shouldn't be used by pregnant or nursing women. It has been used for thousands of years and has pride of place among several cuisines.

The baking time indicated on the recipe is too short, I made my cookies smaller and increased the baking time to 16 mins at 180C for them to be fully cooked through as my first batch was uncooked in the middle and I had to put them back to bake for longer. It is also a bit lacking in flavour. Probably will not make it again.

These were just the right amount of sweet for a shortbread style cookie. I took them to a Christmas party, and they were well enjoyed. Someone suggested dipping half of it in chocolate and I may try that ??

These were absolutely delicious. As others said, it did not taste like maple syrup, but for me it was just the right amount of sweet (and my 7 year old agreed). I'm glad I didn't add more than the recipe called for - I used 100% maple syrup and maybe that makes the difference? I did add 1 tsp of almond extract and substituted whole wheat pastry flour for white flour (these tweaks taken from a similar recipe in 100 days of real food), but all the proportions were kept the same, and it was seriously amazing. I did have to cook them longer - more like 20 mins. I love these and will make them again and again!

Loved the results! I needed a recipe with no egg or vanilla extract, and they came out great. I just added about a tablespoon of white sugar to the dough, and some chopped walnuts. Next time I will probably chill the batter for a few minutes to make it easier to work with. After I took them out of the oven I let them cool for about 2-5 minutes, then rolled them in some confectioners sugar.

Delicious and easy to make! Needed about 1/2 cup more flour and I had to cook them fit afoot 25 minutes.  I also turned them into thumbprint cookies with jam in the center.

I love this recipe! I've made it both regular and gluten free - both times I found mixture was closer to cake batter than cookie batter so I added a touch more flour and added powdered sugar. The powdered sugar helped thicken the batter as well as added more sweetness since this recipe is not very sweet. I use real maple syrup only, and add a dash of maple flavour extract. These cookies are always a hit!

The cookies where soaking in melted butter when they where in the oven. They tasted like butter and salt with a hint of maple syrup.

Fantastic recipe, the family gobbled them up and they're so easy to make, definitely going to make these again. :)
