These are delish, with a slight change; I added a tsp of almond extract and another 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the butter mix. I also prefer mine a bit smaller sized so instead of taking a tablespoon full to shape into crescent I took a little less they just look wonderful when petite.

i LOVE THIS RECIPE.. IT IS SO EASY. I DIDNT HAVE ALMOND SO I USED CRUSH WALNUTS AND ADD ALMOND EXTRACT.  THEY CAME OUT REALLY TASTY
