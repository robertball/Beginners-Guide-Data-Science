Ooohhh, this is good! I made two changes or substitutions to the recipe. 2 tablespoons olive oil was subbed with 2 tablespoons "garlic olive oil" (gifted to me by Marianne) and the 3 tablespoons chopped garlic was omitted. I also used Seasoned Salt from Hawaai (gifted to me by Mauigirl... now that stuff's good!) instead of Kosher salt. We topped salad greens with this oh so yummy salsa and called it dinner. Corn chips added the crunch factor. I will be making this many times this summer. Both as a salad for dinner and as salsa.

This zippy little salsa gets quite a punch from fresh garlic!  I used about half the amount specified in the recipe, and we were quite satisfied.  Bright, refreshing flavors and beautiful colors make this salsa a great accompaniment to seafood or chicken.  Thanks for the idea!

This corn salsa was wonderful! I believe what sets it apart from others is the 3 Tblsp of garlic! As it is not summer, I didn't grill the corn. I will try it like that though when it warms up. I used 1 cup of defrosted sweet corn I steamed in the microwave for about 1 minute. I followed the ratio of the ingredients, but used 1 large tomato and a 1/4 cup of onion, diced small, and the same amount of cilantro chopped. I can't imagine using more than that much raw onion. For the salt, I did about 1/4 tsp or so.

So easy to make!  We loved it and made it exactly the way it was written with just a little lime squirted over it so we didn't add too much salt.

This was outstanding.  I did a few things different:  I used red onion instead of white, because it's what I had.  Likewise, I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder, maybe a teaspoon or thereabouts.  I used some Mexican chili-salt-and-lime seasoning in place of some of the salt.  I used regular vegetable oil, half of it homemade chile oil (dried red pepper flakes in a jar filled with vegetable oil).  And I replaced the red wine vinegar, which I don't really like, with a combination of lime juice and seasoned rice vinegar.

The never ending "What to make for dinner" cropped up on Friday afternoon. The kids and I had went to Costco, we grabbed some shrimp and I decided to make shrimp tacos with these Little tiny tortillas I found. Got home and looked up salsas.  I had almost everything I needed for this and a quick trip down the street would fix the rest!! WOW n OMG are words that come to mind!! I used fresh limes instead of the vinegar. Could be served on pretty much everything, which is what has been happening this weekend!  Thank you very much Ms. Croff!!

Wonderful recipe for leftover corn on the cob! I always have cilantro, onion, and tomatoes. I served this for 3 days straight, 1st as appetizer, 2nd afternoon as snack, then to finish it up-as a side dish with Mexican stuffed Peppers (another recipe on this site) with tortilla chips, the perfect compliment to a spicy dish. Cool and refreshing on these hot summer nights!

Been wowing my friends for a few years with this recipe. Also is divine over grilled chicken breast for a low cal twist. I add the juice of one fresh lime over the salt and tomatoes. Let it sit for a bit then add the rest and oh, of course I add more cubed avocado.
