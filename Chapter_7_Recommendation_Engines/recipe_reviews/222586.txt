Lovely recipe. I would probably use ham or bacon alternately, as well. So convenient. I don't understand, when folks say, they won't or might not try the recipe again, just because it needs more spice. Can a person not pick up the cayenne or red pepper flakes & put some in? That makes no sense to me.

WOW! These are delicious!  I used Jimmy Dean's Sausage Skillet package which has peppers, potatoes, onions, and sausage in it-found in the freezer section. Cook the skillet contents first before adding it to the eggs and only use a little more than half of the package.  Also, I figured there would be enough seasoning in that that I wouldn't have to add the garlic powder,black pepper, and salt, but I was wrong.  If You use the Skillet package, You should add the garlic powder and pepper, but no salt.  Anyways, these are amazing if You follow the recipe exactly too! Who would have thought to bake eggs in cupcake liners.  This recipe is a keeper!  :)

I added in one large minced fresh red pepper and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. This was quick, easy and filling. I served these with homemade home fries and whole wheat toast. The great thing about recipes like this is they are great with any kind of meat you have on hand or any kind of vegetable you want to throw in.

I make 3 meals a day for a disabled person and this recipe has been a huge hit!  After months of frozen pancakes and waffles this egg-muffin was met with rave reviews!!  Since the meals are made 8 hours ahead reheating was a major concern.

This recipe works very well for making ahead and reheating in the microwave.  If you have a 700W micro reheat for 1 minute 30 seconds and let rest 30 seconds before eating.  If you have a 1100/1200W micro reheat for 1 minute 10 seconds and let rest 30 seconds before eating.  If at all possible reheat in a dish covered with waxed paper so that steam builds up.

Try "HOT" flavor sausage for a change also mix it up with different additions.  I've added chopped sweet red pepper, cubed fresh bread, several different types of chees (Swiss, Gruyere, Fontina, manchego).  Winter squash puree (butternut) and asparagus are also great additions!!

This is a great recipe and can be altered for any taste.  You can add a 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup mayo so they puff up.  Very easy and can be kept in the fridge for days and re-heated as needed.  Great for kids in the morning, as they can microwave them on the way out the door and eat them on the bus. Super mom time saver!!!

My family loved these. I did use 1lb of pork sausage instead of half.

This could obviously be made a lot faster and with a lot less fuss if just simply scrambled on the stovetop - but then you'd totally lose that "these are so darned cute" effect! I made these in silicone cupcake liners sprayed with Pam and just lined them up on a cookie sheet, using a soup ladle to fill them. I used bacon rather than sausage, fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and 1/4 c. finely chopped red pepper rather than green (the green pepper is in the directions but not in the ingredients list!), which gave these such nice color. There's a lot of room for creativity and versatility in terms of ingredients - ham, sausage, crab meat, salmon, different cheeses or vegetables, herbs - the possibilities are really limitless. They're delicious, although how could they not be? Cute and colorful too - they rise up puffy and tall and get a nice, golden sheen to them. I don't know that I'd bother with these little guys for a whole bunch of people because it would just be too putzy, but for just Hubs and me it was a special little treat on the plate this morning!

I was so happy to come across this recipe.   I'm studying for the Bar and I just can't take time every morning to make breakfast.   The freeze great and you can pop them in the microwave, in their frozen state,  and heat them at 50% for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes.   Boom.


I made these with the ingredients I had on hand and I don't think I'll do it differently next time.   I was out of cheddar cheese so I used pepper jack instead, and I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.   I also chopped up precooked Jimmy Dean link sausage - great time saver.  I also threw in a dusting of red pepper flakes, and a splash of cream to make sure they'd be fluffy.  They were.   They weren't quite done at 25 minutes so I baked them for an extra 5 minutes. 

Everyone loves them.  And mornings are much easier.

I love all things breakfast and it's great having a "muffin" to grab for on-the-go.  I added some cream cheese to the mix and cooked the sausage in maple syrup!  So very tasty!

Try baking a hash brown and putting a small square at the bottom of the muffin cup with the other ingredients. I made 48 for my church breakfast and it was a big hit. Each person got a piping hot egg cup to enjoy.

It's scrambled eggs in a cute shape and you don't have to stand over the stove.  Don't use cupcake liners,  grease even a non stick muffin pan, use any and all ingredients you like in an omelet or quiche, make sure to season accordingly, cook any protein before adding to eggs, add 1/4 cup each mayo and water to get a fluffy rise, cool before putting in a zip lock in fridge,  freeze them and heat in micro at 30-60 seconds each.  I've summarized the reviews. You're welcome.

Yes, I made them.  Jalapeños, swiss, tomatoes, and cooked Applewood smoked bacon.

These were wonderful.  Easy to make and great for on the go.  I've been looking for a low-carb breakfast recipe that I could eat on the way to work.  This is it.  Added green chile, otherwise followed recipe exactly.

Deliciously convenient! I added a whole pound of sausage and tossed in a can of green chilies to make them a bit perkier.  They were made specifically for a brunch and I was amazed at how even little kids came back for seconds.  Super big kids said I should've doubled the recipe. Have made them twice since and DH and I love them cold! Gave the recipe to neighbor and she says her kids grab one to eat on the way to the school bus stop. Good stuff.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe today for the first time. Overall, I think it's a good recipe, but as others have mentioned, a little bland for my taste. I'll definitely use hot sausage next time. 

I also used cupcake liners - which I won't ever do again! It's really hard to get the paper off. The result was an egg muffin that was reduced to scrambled egg chunks in my hand. Next time, Pam.

Question: Can these be frozen? If so, how do you reheat them?

I wanted to know if this could be made with Egg Beaters. So, I tried it, turned out fabulous! Mixed a carton of Southwest Style Egg Beaters with 4 whole eggs, used Jimmy Dean precooked turkey sausage crumbles, added Real Bacon Bits, fresh mushrooms, bell pepper and onion.  I don't like to cook so this really cut down on the prep work and I'll have breakfast for several days. Sprayed the muffin tin with Pam no problems with sticking.  Will definitely make these again.

These are GREAT!  I altered this recipe to make it healthier.  I omitted the salt, cheese and sausage and used 6 large eggs and 1 1/2 C egg substitute.  I also sprinkled in some Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning and pepper.  Still a fabulous alternative to an already terrific recipe! With the reduction in calories, two muffins make a serving of the following:

I add everything BUT the kitchen sink to these. One of the best times was with a $0.99 package of broccoli slaw - added 1/2 the package along with the meat, cheese, onion and bell pepper. I would have added mushrooms but did not have any. YUMMMMMM!

This was not a hit with my family.  My boyfriend thought it could use more seasoning.  Tried it with and without sausage.  Definetley recommend sausage to give it more flavor.  Don't think I will make this again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I had unexpected over night guests and was looking for a simple breakfast I could feed several people who were waking at different times.  This recipe was the perfect fit!  Not having breakfast sausage on hand, I substituted two links of chorizo, cooking it as you suggested the bulk sausage.  Instead of cheedar (which I was also out of!!), I substituted pepper jack.  They were a hit!  The second time around I made the recipe as written, using hot breakfast sausage since we like a little spice in our eggs.  Again, a huge hit!  I love a recipe that is adaptable, which can only be done when the "bones" of the recipe is dependable.   Thanks again!

This was fantastic.  I wanted to share the experience of using a silicone muffin tray.  It bent in half and I burned myself, and spilled one of the muffin tins into the new oven.  Note to self: put something more sturdy under the silicone muffin tray.  :0(

Love these but they all stuck to the cupcake liners and looked messy and ripped apart when I took them out. Next time I'll just use a greased muffin pan!

These are fabulous for the busy school and work week.  I have been making these tasty muffins for my family for the past few months, and it has been a huge time saver during the hectic morning rush.  Since I am a vegetarian, I substitute the sausage for "veggie burger crumbles" in the muffins I make for myself.  Enjoy!

I loved making this recipe on a cold Saturday morning; my kids really loved it! I  used Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage (the one in the big tube). I also substituted scallion (green onion) instead of regular onions as my kids wouldn't eat it otherwise. And, I used white pepper too, because if my kids saw black pepper - they wouldn't eat it. I will say however, although I used a standard 12  cup muffin pan (non-stick but used cooking spray) the eggs really fluffed up in the oven and ran over the edge and made quite a mess in the oven. I'd suggest using a cooking sheet underneath, or line the bottom of the oven with foil. I'll for sure make these again and try other ingredients to change it up.

These were tasty.  I added fresh spinach, garlic, seasonings.  They're great to serve immediately.  I didn't care for them after reheating and not at all the next day.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe pretty close and added a few things. I added spinach, mushrooms, jalapeño ( didn't have any bell pepper) and topped each tin with feta cheese. Added red pepper flakes, salt and fresh minced garlic to spice it up some. I also used savory breakfast sausage instead of plain ground sausage. I added more eggs to account for the extra ingredients.

I used jumbo muffin tins instead of regular size ones, this increased cooking time to 40 minutes. Nothing burned but the middle was still runny at 20 minutes. Also do not fill these to the brim, they leaked out everywhere. Try to fill them 1/2 to 3/4 full.

It turned out super flavorful despite my challenges and my wife loves them for a quick breakfast out the door.

These were pretty good.  Think I would spice the mix up more next time.  Fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  Pepper Jack cheese?  Cut the recipe in 1/2 for the 2 of us.  Added the mayo and water as one reviewer suggested.

These were easy and delicious!  I added half a red bell pepper and a few handfuls of chopped spinach and sauteed it all with the onion and bacon (didn't have sausage on hand).  I added oregano because my husband is in love with it, and salted the veggie mix a little since I added extra.
I didn't have muffin cup liners so I preheated my well-greased muffin tin with the oven so the oil sizzled a little when I filled the cups.  They still stuck slightly but not so bad as eggs usually do in the oven.  They came out pretty enough to serve to company!

I  use silicone muffin cups and this worked great for these.  Found they needed a bit more cooking than called for.  Froze very well.  Were better when taken out the night before to thaw then microwaved than they were when put into the microwave frozen which made them a bit tough.  Very easy and convenient breakfast for when you are in a hurry.

My boyfriend loved this recipe! I used "lil smokies sausage" and Munster cheese. I also added mushrooms. I cooked the onion, sausage and mushroom together in a skillet before I added them to the cupcake pans with egg mixture. Great recipe! Perfect breakfast for someone with a busy schedule.

I am a very picky eater who never adds enough seasoning for my Southern born husband's liking. We both really enjoyed these, he didn't even want hot sauce on top when served. I used a shake of dried onion so the onion flavor would not be overwhelming. Cut recipe in half for me and hubby. Used pre cooked Owen's breakfast sausage and Mexican 4 cheese blend. Forgot to put the sausage in mixture so just sprinkled it on top of egg mixture in muffin tin. Did not have bell pepper so omitted it. Will try next time with spinach, mushrooms, etc to make a variety to freeze. 
I used Crisco Olive Oil Spray in muffin tins. My pans are really old but I had no sticking. As another reviewer stated, they look "wet" when done, just use the knife test and pull out when knife comes out clean. Mine took exactly 20 minutes in my faithful gas oven.

I made minor changes, instead of sausage I used chopped ham and kielbasa and I added chopped spinach and tomatoes. I substituted cheddar cheese for low fat mozzarella. These were easy, filling, and tasty. I will be making these again soon! Yummy!

I love these. I have also tried them with spinach, mushrooms and turkey bacon. The possibilities are endless! I prefer greasing my tins vs. using liners. I want all of my eggie goodness without peeling it off of the liners.

I made these less greasy by using precooked turkey sausage.  I've also tried a bit of onions, green pepper, & mushrooms with very good results.

I have made these a few times now and love them every time. I add a quarter teaspoon of baking soda to make them puffier. I've used different combinations of bacon, tomatoes, green pepper, onions, broccoli, you name it really... and I also like to add fresh Parmesan cheese.  Delicious.

The portability factor for this meal got my attention, and I wasn't disappointed.  A great high protein, low carb, tasty breakfast that can be taken to work when time is tight - and it lasts a few days!  Some tweaks I made after following the original recipe verbatim:  1) Sauté the onions before adding to egg mixture.  This softens and sweetens the onion flavor; otherwise they tend to be too pungent and overpowering. 2) Know your oven and watch the cooking time.  A few minutes too long and the texture becomes uncomfortably al dente.  3) I added a couple pinches more salt and a full bell pepper (about 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup).  Seemed to balance and wake up the flavor.  4) I haven't added cream cheese yet, like another commenter, but it sounds intriguing. 5) The capital of Nebraska is Lincoln.  OK, that was some trivia, and cribbed from a satirical (and funny) 70's movie. Anyone care to guess?

This recipe was awesome! I did change it a bit, though. We are vegetarians, so I skipped the meat, and also added 1/2 cup of broccoli, and let it cook for 23 minutes. It didn't look done when I took it out, but that was just the cheese and it was perfectly cooked. It's an amazing recipe.

I added chopped mushroom, red bell pepper and spinach, colorful. If you bake them in silicone muffin pans, no liners needed. But, place pans on cookie sheets for non messy handling (learned the hard way).

Pretty good...takes a long time for basically a backed omelet. Be careful of overcooking thee bottom...looks ugly and unappealing and gets kind of rubbery. I suggest just cooking it over the stove covered in a skillet for a minute or 2 longer to set the ingredients....like a frittata....then cut for all to enjoy

Made this but added 1/2 cup of milk and adjusted recipe in half. When I first took this out of the oven they looked beautiful, all puffed up. While I was toasting some English muffins I heard a funny little sound and all the air literally came out of my egg muffins and they went flat, but still tasted good. I guess I will try the recipe again without adding the milk, but I added the milk because I like my eggs light and fluffy. The egg muffins were not undercooked and tasted very good, just did not look as nice.

Made three batches of this recipe all one night, one bacon, one sausage and one with ham. First I sauteed a large onion, garlic, a red pepper, yellow pepper and a jalapeno in one large batch that i divided into thirds.  In each bowl I mixed the rest of the ingredients. I used paper liners but hated the way they stuck. I will just grease the muffin tin  next time. These freeze well, my boys love them!!!
I made these again with breakfast sausage, red pepper,onion, cilantro, jarred diced jalapeno peppers, diced black olives, and all the cheese i had in the fridge, and dashes of cumin, garlic salt, black peppper and hot sauce.

These were good. I tripled the recipe, but put in the whole 2 lbs of sausage, so I wouldn't have 1/2 lb leftover. Have frozen them and reheat for breakfast. Oh yeah, I left out green pepper so picky son would eat them. Came home to find picky son eating them as after school snack, as well. High praise.

I saw this recipe but did not have sausage. It worked just fine with some leftover ham in place of the sausage, although I would have preferred sausage and will try that next time. I also doubled the pepper since my family loves their eggs peppery. We enjoyed it! 

The reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is that we couldn't taste the cheese at all. For this reason, I think next time I will leave the cheese out of the recipe and melt it over the top of the "muffin".  I plan to refrigerate these and use them to make an easy microwaveable breakfast sandwich during the work week, so that I can have a real breakfast, even when I'm running short of time (which is most mornings, unfortunately).  Beats all the crappy so-called "breakfast sandwiches" on the market that are full of fat and sodium.  Can't wait to try it again :-)

These are so simple and cute. I used bacon, shallots and feta cheese as that is what I had on hand. I missed the green peppers but will try with red peppers next time as I prefer the sweeter flavor of the reds.

This was a great simple recipe. I was looking for something that I could make for breakfast that was fast. My seven year old son couldn’t wait to eat these for breakfast, he had to try one this evening when I baked them. He absolutely loves them! We are a no pork family, so I used turkey sausage. I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I added the amount of seasoning to my liking. It may have been just slightly more than the recipe stated. I also added Mexican chili powder. That is just my go to seasoning. For my cheese I used a mixture of cheddar, Colby, Swiss, and Gouda. Delish! This is will be my go to all in one breakfast!

Good recipe and is open to whatever changes/additions you want to try. 
I added about half a teaspoon of baking soda to the mix for extra "fluffiness" - seemed to work OK.
Then tried a quick variation of putting a silicone muffin tray -sprayed with non stick - in the microwave -my 1100 watt one took 30 seconds per egg -(made trial batch of 4 eggs) and they were just right. Great to eat immediately or freeze/refrigerate for later.
Have since cut 12 muffin tray down to 9 so it fits in microwave and put it on the glass microwave tray before filling so no handling problems, and I can have 9 of 'em ready to eat in less than 5 minutes. 
Thanks for the idea.

I am on a well known diet plan so I substituted the cheddar for part-skim mozzarella and the sausage for ham.  Turned out excellent! These will be a breakfast staple for me.

Added potatoes & cubed ham in place of sausage.  Personally would use less onion & definitely use muffin cups next time for ease of removal from  tins. I think with some changes for personal taste these will be great!

Having made these a few times with marginal results because of sticking/cleanup, I purchased SILICONE BAKING CUPS online (be sure to get 100% silicone, PBA free).  These are da bomb!  There is absolutely no sticking and you just wash in warm soapy water.  The best part?  They come in a 24-pack of 8 different colors. Be sure to put the cups on a jelly roll pan (like a cookie sheet with sides). I have the grandkids choose which cups they want to build, put out all the possible ingredients and they have a blast filling "their own" cups.  Then I add the beaten eggs and we're ready to go.  Oh, and Grampa and I can add all the "yucky stuff" to our own colors, like leftover potatoes, sautéed onions, broccoli, and whatever spices we'd like.  I find that when kids take ownership of some of their food choices they're more likely to eat it!

Super easy and delicious!  Use a silicone muffin tray for the easiest clean up ever.   I whisked in some chopped fine herbs, salt, pepper and crushed chilli peppers into the egg mixture and let it sit for a few minutes.  Then I sauteed peppers, onions and mushrooms prior to adding them to the eggs.  I topped them off with chopped cherry tomatoes and sprinkled Romano & parmesan cheese about half way through baking.

I made these this morning using 12 oz of cubed ham, 1 c. cheddar, and 4oz of cream cheese. I also added a little milk. They turned out great! I had a little left over and baked that in small ramekins for about 5 minutes longer than the "muffins." Will definitely make again depending on how well they freeze.

Made these for some overnight company and everyone raved about these. They were not only delicious but looked really cute on the plate with a small side of fresh melon.

There are so many different additions you can add for your family's preference . Next time I'm going to add a finally chopped jalapeño for a little zip. Thank You for Sharing.

I made these for church and they were fantastic. I increased the recipe to serve 50, but it ended up being close to 75. I filled the muffin tin about 1/3 full to stretch them out to feed as many as possible. I sprayed my tins with olive oil and the muffin came out clean. It only took 20 for them to cook. Very tasty! I will make these again!

Turned out great except for the fact that they stuck......really badly.  I will try the paper liners next time.  I used ham instead of sausage.  They were a hit with the hubby.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  It's so easy to make. I added some of the veggies from my veggie salad (black olives, broccoli, cauliflower, and onions).  I also placed half a slice of pepperjack cheese on the top once it was done. I baked mine in mini loaf pans, which yields 2 servings and made it oh so cute :-)  I'm on my 3rd day of Atkins and this is perfect for breakfast. My son has gluten allergies, so tonight I will be making him a batch as well as making them for work Friday morning as a surprise.

Quick and easy. Can adjust the spices if you want a batch to have a little more kick, I usually add some worchestershire sauce.  Also, I use brown and serve turkey sausage as a short cut.

Way too easy!!  This is a winner!  You can sub the sausage for bacon or ham.  I make these ahead of time and send them to daycare with my son for a quick breakfast.  
This is an awesome way to make eggs for a brunch and not get stuck in front of the stove.

This is delicious! I had no meat on hand so I used zucchini, green pepper and onion. Since there was no meat to "bulk" it up I only used 8 eggs and it still made 12 servings. This is so much better than regular scrambled eggs as it was much less greasy. This is definitely a keeper and cannot wait to try different variations.

Good recipe. Used chorizo instead. I cooked it on a skillet first and added one medium shredded potato, then drained the fat. Only problem was that they stuck to the muffin liners. I also wish they had puffed up more but, overall this is a fun way to make eggs. Nice for a grab n' go breakfast, or for a breakfast potluck or brunch.

So very convenient for a single person.  I make them a dozen at a time and freeze them. Any meat, and most veggies work as well as cheese. Season to taste. Super easy supper when I don’t feel like cooking.

Our new favorite make-ahead breakfast! I’m a messy cook, so I assembled them a little differently - a scoop of egg in each tin first, then adding the veg, cheese and meat. Try this with bulk hot Italian sausage, too! Delicious.

Fun and easy to make.  We enjoyed the muffins! I made them with finely diced ham rather than the sausage and I did have to omit the green pepper so instead used some Salt-Free Seasoning and thyme to perk them up.  This is a keepie!

Made these with green, yellow, red and orange bell peppers. Also added cajun seasoning. Baked half in a regular muffin tin with paper liners and half in a "jumbo" tin  with cooking oil spray. The first batch stuck to the paper liners, second batch popped right out of the pan. The jumbo size are perfect to add to an english muffin for a handy on the go breakfast.

followed the recipe except for the cheese. had some leftover cheese that I wanted to use up.  Kept the same amount of cheese. This made 18 muffins for me. I filled the wells 3/4 full. They did not puff up, but as these were used as appetizers, I did not want huge portions.

I made them this autumn morning because they looked so stinkin' good, unfortunately mine were not. I've been baking and cooking at least 40 years and generally I'm pretty good (unless I'm mad at my husband) so I know what I'm doing, but these muffins were lacking in flavor and were way overdone at only 20 minutes. Oh well. I'll try again another time.

The taste was great. I had a terrible time with the egg sticking to muffin pan.  It was a non-stick pan and I sprayed it with a best-selling release agent.

I put in bacon, broccoli, cheddar cheese and onion. They turned out delicious. I have made this recipe twice and am happy with the results. I fully recommend this recipe for family's that have different tastes. You can easily add different toppings without a hassle. I have a daughter who is a very picky eater and she loves these muffins!

Quick and easy. My wife doesn't like peppers so used green onion to add color. Also used sage sausage and mushrooms. Pretty tasty!

Just as a first test, I only made 1/4 of the recipe.  I used cooked turkey bacon, chopped into small pieces, and I sauteed the veggies before adding to the mixture.  We're going low-carb here recently, and these will be great to have in the freezer.   I'll be playing around with other veggies, too.  Spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, maybe artichoke hearts, so many possibilities!  AWESOME, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!

I added a small amount of cheddar and a sliver of pre-cooked bacon to the tops, after 10 minutes of cooking, to add a little flair. Very good addition! Great to freeze these and pop them in the microwave when I don’t feel like cooking.

I get it that it's not fair to the recipe to change ingredients, but I didn't have sausage so I used bacon.  These were super easy to make. I used six eggs instead of 12, as I wasn't sure I would like them.   I'm glad I didn't make more.  Eggs like this are not my cup of tea.  I won't make them again.

I have picky children, so I didn't add onions. Instead I added 1/4 tsp. onion powder. I didn't use cupcake liners, just sprayed a muffin pan. If you let them cool, they are pretty easy to remove with minimal breakage. These had great flavor - I plan to make again with other fillers (tomoto/cheese, just cheese).

I will definitely make this again!  Based on other reviews, I doubled all the spices (except the salt, which I left as-is), and added a little hot sauce.  I also used silicone baking cups- the eggs muffins slid right out and nothing stuck to the cups at all.  Granted, I now need to clean 12 silicone cups but I'll take that over scraping a muffin pan or losing half my muffin to paper liners anyday!  Just fill the silicone cups slightly less so the mix doesn't spill over into the pan.

I sauteed my veggies and let them cool before adding to the eggs. I beat my eggs until they are well beaten..comletely lemony color. I read that doing that makes them fluff more and its TRUE.  I also use silicone cupcake liners.

This was a good base recipe. I ended up adding about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder as well as more cheese. Be sure to grease your muffin cups well if you don't want to spend 15 minutes cleaning your muffin tin. Would make again.

Made with ham, cheddar cheese and green peppers.  Great for my daughter to take on the way to work.  Healthier than the chocolate granola bars she has been taking.  Thanks.  So versatile.  The possibilities are endless to put in these.

Better on the second try with 1/2# cooked, crumbled bacon instead of sausage.  I cool completely then freeze.  Weekday breakfast: microwave from frozen one minute at half power.

Easy and delicious!  Made them for our tailgate.  I substituted bacon for the sausage.  You could really use any ingredients that you would add to scrambled eggs or an omelette.

Excellent! I’ll cut back eggs to 9 next time,  since 12 eggs made too much to fit 12 muffin cups. I’d add some minced fresh parsley or thyme. The best thing: I have leftover egg muffins ready to eat, cold or reheated in the microwave.

Yummy! I didn’t have breakfast sausage, so I used some real bacon bits. I also used sour cream, a splash of milk, green onion, chopped garlic and some fresh basil. I’m sure you could use anything breakfasty you have on hand! Super great breakfast choice. I’m going to freeze some to take to work with me!

Very good. I used maple flavored sausage and only 11 eggs as that’s all I had. These had very good flavor but seemed slightly dry...maybe it was because of the missing egg or maybe I should have changed the time or temperature since my muffin pan was non-stick. I would make again for sure but might change the cook time or temperature.

I changed the recipe a lot (substituting 1/2 lb. smoked ham for the sausage and 8 oz shredded cheddar for the half cup swiss. I also omitted the onion and pepper)! But I was inspired by this recipe and I'm so excited to have these all ready to go for easy (low carb) lunches! Also, I've been spending a fortune on the Starbuck's sous vide egg bites and these are even better!

It was all good minus the fact that you have to cook it at different times for each muffin. Otherwise, it was great I didn't keep the peppers or onions and it was marvelous. When it came out of the oven some were raw.

I made these with changes because of the ingredients I had on hand, but they were delish!
Instead of sausage, I used Canadian Bacon, green onions instead of regular onions, jarred fire-roasted red peppers instead of green.  I kept all ingredient amounts the same and they were so very good - thanks!

They were good but a little dry, I used Turkey sausage rather tha regular sausage.  Next time I think I will add onions, red pepper and an extra egg for a little more moisture!

Super easy, delicious and a visually appealing dish. I substituted pork sausage with Field Roast, Vegan Apple sausage sauteed with baby bella mushrooms, and used 10 eggs.  The Egg Muffins came out moist, savory and golden brown.

It was a hit...but I did modify the orgional receipe...I used pepperoni and italian seasoning. Peppers are a must too. Poured in muffin cup, this way something to hold onto when not on a plate. Enjoyed it on a road trip.

I did a half dozen-6 eggs, about 1/4c shredded cheese, fresh onion diced, salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika (I just did like four shakes each except the salt), a slice of ham diced, and a splash of milk to make it fluffier(I use lactose free),  and I smooshed some leftover tater tots into the bottom before I put the egg mix. 350f for 25min.

Ok, so what I did was cook bacon first THEN I cooked onion, bell pepper, and some mushrooms in the bacon drippings. Then I added everything to the egg mixture with some cheese and popped it in the oven. Tasted like a southwest omelette. Sooo good, I will be making these weekly now!

followed recipe exactly, except used a mini-muffin tin. Filled that plus 2 ramekins. Still had to bake for around 20 minutes. I don't like sausage with eggs, but my husband liked them and they were a hit at a potluck. Easy to make and transport, so will probably make again.

Although they are tasty, clean up isn’t worth it. They do not come out of the muffin pan in one pieces, they stick to the bottom thus making for scrubbing the pan. If I were to attempt these again, I make cut rounds of wax paper for the bottom of the tin or make it as a quiche.

Delicious, quick, and great for the constantly on-the-go person! I love that you can make them the night before and then they will last up to a week in the fridge. Then all you have to do is microwave them for like 30 sec. Boom! A healthy, and yummy Breakfast!

For the recipe "as written" - five stars! Really good and easy to make!  Great recipe!
Of course I made some changes! That's one of the great things about this recipe - you can easily alter it for your taste.  I followed a recommendation to add "1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup mayo so they puff up." I used about 3/4 lb of (Neese's) hot sausage, increased the cheese (I used extra sharp) to about 3/4 cup, and just slightly reduced the garlic and onion (for our taste). Finally, I added about 1/8 tspn of Cayenne pepper.  So good!!!!

This is SO brilliant to take to morning meetings etc. I used spicy sausage and substituted RED pepper for the green ( for the color and I just like the red better.. who knows why)
This is a great recipe, thanks SO much!!

I read reviews and decided to make the following changes per reviewers experiences.

I used 9 oz packet of precooked Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles,  3/4 cup of diced smoked turkey, cajun seasoning instead of salt, omitted the garlic and omitted the onion. I added 1/4 cup of diced canned jalapenos and splash of milk and heaping tablespoon of mayo, per others suggestions.

I got 20 breakfast muffins, they were hearty, meaty and flavorful without being overly spicy.

I used a non stick muffin pan and let them rest for 5 minutes before easing them out with a tiny silicone spatula. They did popout with minimal sticking. Letting them rest seems to be key.  Next time I will try to find parchment muffin liners as they pull away from food without sticking, they are fantastic. Sprouts or health food store that specialize in baking will have these. Great recipe and will  make and freeze for quick breakfasts.

These were delicious and perfect for a brunch I hosted. I used paper muffin liners and that was a mistake as they stuck to the egg muffin. I'd skip the liners next time or try the aluminum cups that I imagine would work better.

They were just ok as we didn't eat them all. If I make them again I will add some hot sauce and some herbs.  I  also will not use the paper muffin cups as the egg mixture stuck to the greased muffin papers.

This is so easy to make and my husband and toddler gobble these up! It's also been really good to take to brunch parties or mom groups. I just make half with meat, half with veggies for my non meat eating friends. I love the clean up is quick and easy plus kids and adults seem to love these. They're always gone quickly! Deviled eggs used to be my go 2 for parties but now it's this. Quick, easy, healthy and crowd pleaser. Win win!

Made these for baby shower brunch. Added mushrooms and used sautéed green peppers and onions. Made everything day before and used measuring cup to add 1\3 to paper cupcake  holders the morning of family he shower. Topped half with extra cheddar. Next time would try without cupcake paper as the paper sticks and makes removing difficult when muffins are hot. Some salsa over the top adds to the flavor.

Good base recipe. Due to others comments about being bland, I added a cup of salsa, doubled all ingredients except the eggs and cheese. I used 18 eggs and 2 cups of mixed cheddar and American cheese. All the ladies at church thought it was deliciously! Thank you for a good recipe!

Made for our "breakfast for dinner" meal this evening.  I followed the recipe fairly closely,  but definitely knew I'd have to add more seasoning, which I did. I threw in some diced broccoli as well as some sundried tomatoes, which was a wonderful addition. Used a 1/4 cup to pour the egg mixture into the muffin pan, topped with  extra cheese and baked 22 minutes. Served with pan-fried potatoes and extra sausage links, the hubby and I really enjoyed these, but picky 9 year-old didn't like the texture. Since we have leftovers, I'll be happy to reheat one of these for breakfast tomorrow morning. Easily customizable with pretty much any ingredient you want to add, this recipe will be made again.

Awesome recipe! I used pepper bacon, pepper jack cheese, fresh basil, spinach and diced cherry tomatoes. I added less than a quarter cup of water to the eggs and they were surprising fluffy and moist. They also microwave great for three days. Perfect for a quick breakfast! Thank you!

This was good and easy to make, but it stuck to the paper cups really bad. If you use paper cups, I would also spray them with a little bit of cooking spray. Other than that, yummy!

I keep 'scraps' when I make anything with ham, turkey, beef, etcetera, each in their own little {cleaned out} frosting container with a lid, and put them in the freezer because they have already been cooked. I keep shredded cheese and garlic and onion powder or even sometimes have the small container as above filled with diced onions. 

There is MINIMAL cooking/prep time. I have a 12 spot muffin tin {one of the fancy stick free but usually spray it lightly because of the cheese} and put 1 row across with real bacon bits {usually store bought but not always}, 1 row with turkey, 1 row with beef, one row with chicken, sometimes have left over sausage instead of one of the other meats, and with the onion and garlic and just a touch of pepper {mixed, from a grinder} and adding the cheese it's no trouble at all.

There are chinese takeout soup {large/tall} that will hold about 5-6 of the muffins, the smaller containers hold 2-3, or other containters, even ziplock freezer {sandwich size is usually big enough for a couple, don't want them sticking together} then when needed pop 1 or more in to the microwave for about a minute and done. Don't see what some are complaining about, have made this several times and ways, and if do the already cooked/freeze it so it doesn't ruin/cooked-prep thing it's just a matter of mixing up the eggs, adding a little bit of spices and cheese, then putting some of each type of meat in each muffin space.

So easy to make and the taste was great!
Used red bell pepper, baby spinach/kale mix, and cut up some cooked pepperoni (what I had on hand) baked 25 minutes and  they were great even without cheese!

I used ground beef instead of pork.  I also added sun dried tomatoes, Oregon and basil.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  Still in the oven, but smells delicious!  Cannot wait to eat one in the morning for breakfast on the go.

Delicious!  I cooked them in jumbo muffin tins for 17-18 mins.  This makes them more flat And round - perfect size for a toasted english muffin.  Voila!  Awesome breakfast sandwich!

Very good as is. Made this a handful of times now and used what things I had on hand or had a taste for. Only problem I came across was the stuff sticking to the paper liners and/or muffin tin itself. USE SILICONE CUPCAKE LINERS! They came out PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe!

These scrambled egg muffins turned out amazing, and tasted delicious. I used turkey sausages instead of beef to make this recipe healthier. Also, I substituted the cheddar cheese for another healthier option which was 1/2 cup of feta cheese. I also added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to add a little bit of spiciness and flavor.

Nice and easy way to break away from the same ol, same. Salt, pepper, and spice to your liking; Add and take away according to what's good to you then, voila! Something that's sure to showcase your creativity and willingness to try something new.

This is pretty good.  I'm not a huge egg fan but this had plenty of flavor.  I didn't have enough sausage so I chopped up some ham and bacon to add to the sausage.  I cooked for 23 minutes but next time will only cook for 20.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made them for brunch.  Next time I might add some mushrooms.  Or substitute sausage for bacon.  Forgot to spray on muffin cups ending sticky to the paper cups.

These turned out fantastic! The only change I made was I used Colby jack and cheddar cheese which made it nice and cheesy. I only made 6 so I halved the ingredients which worked out fine. This recipe is easy and takes very little time.

I added sautéed mushrooms and potatoes with a small dice. Other reviews talk about it being bland, but I had seasoned the sausage and the vegetables with a little bit of salt when I cooked them. I also added an Italian  Herb mix  and crushed red pepper.  I used muffin liners and like other people it stuck to the liners. I will skip the liners next time I make it. I made these to take on an airplane with me for an early morning flight.

These were delicious!  I made them on a whim-was wanting something different than our norm but didn't have all of the noted ingredients so used red pepper instead of green and 11 slices of bacon instead of sausage.  My family doesn't like onions so I added a bit of minced onion for flavor in lieu of fresh.  I made extra and reheated during the week for before work/school breakfast.  Will definitely make again!

Sunday school class really complimented me on this recipe.  I liked it. But, I thought it was maybe under-seasoned a little.  Maybe I didn't follow recipe.  It was good enough to give it a second try.

These are EXCELLENT!!  Use PARCHMENT cupcake liners and they won't stick........I always saute my onions first.
I also made some in my mini muffin tin......sprayed with Pam and they did NOT stick.  (I only baked the mini's for 19 minutes).
These freeze very well.  Get a couple out while having your coffee in the AM and by the time you are finished with your shower & hair, just pop in the toaster oven for a few minutes.

I liked it!  This was great for taking to work for a quick breakfast.  Mine seemed to have a hint of sweetness, not sure if it was from remaining in the fridge a few days.  I have plans to try different variations, ham swiss and spinach, bacon onions and cheese.  Will definitely make again!

I like the technique. It really leaves you open for any number of things. I grated some carrot and sweated them with some onions in olive oil until tender(don't be afraid of the salt here to really get the moisture out of the ingredients). Then used my trusty frozen spinach to add some substance. If you didn't like this recipe you lack imagination. 

Protip: don't use paper liners. 'Tis a fools errand.

These are really good! I halved the recipe because there were only two of us here for breakfast. Also I added 1 tsp. of Frank's Hot sauce per other reviews and because my husband likes hot sauce on eggs. We ate them with English muffins. These would probably be good for tailgating because they would be easy to serve. I'll make these again!

I used ground turkey sage sausage (fresh), minced garlic, onion powder and adobo vegetable seasoning instead of salt for added flavor and sautéed the onions with the sausage and garlic. IT WAS AMAZING! Whole family loved them!

I've read a lot of the reviews for this recipe but no one has mentioned the different texture these have. I had my oven at 350 like it called for but my muffins were pretty rubbery. I made a muffin tin (12) with no liners and a muffin tin (12) with paper liners. I sprayed the first with cooking spray and while they released from the pan okay, the baked on residue took me 15 min to scrub off. (Yes I was practicing what to say in my review as I scrubbed, and scrubbed, and...). The lined muffins worked great cleaning wise.  They popped right out of the tin. Except, the bottom of the muffin looked weird. Kind of like your face looks when you suck your cheeks in.   These also have a very rubbery texture and quite a lot of the egg sticks to the paper. So, I will not be making these again.

I make these at least two weekends a month so that my kids can grab a quick healthy breakfast on their way to school. I adjust the ingredients to what I have on hand and usually spice it up with hot sauce or green chilis. 30 seconds in the microwave and they are good to go. They are good for a few days in the fridge but don't try to freeze them.

These were incredible, my boyfriend and my brother demolished them in ten minutes. I felt there was a lack of veggies though so I added scallions and some red bell pepper to give them more color. When I took them out of the tins, though, they did not come out clean at all and it's sticking to the insides like glue - it's been 12 hours and I'm still soaking the muffin tin. I sprayed it a lot with non-stick spray beforehand, to no avail, clearly. Did anyone else have this issue, and find a solution?

Turned out great for a brunch I had to make a dish for!  I used Italian sausages instead for a little bit more flavour and a touch more garlic powder. Everyone loved it so I will definitely keep this one in the recipe box!

Delicious! We made these with turkey bacon, and added 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 of mayo for fluff, and 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powdered.  Also, we threw these into a muffin pan without liners, though we used cooking spray, which I regret now at the sight of the mess left behind.  Next time, I'll remember the liners.  We'll definitely make these again!

Love these! I prep my food on a weekly basis - for health (no excuses for fast food when everything is already made), time, and quick meals for my family. These are great for that; one egg, .5 tbsp of milk and some chopped meat or veggies and I have 5 healthy meals made with a few to spare.
Scrambled eggs aren't hard to begin with but this makes making them even easier.

I used precooked sausage links and browned them up nice in a pan. I put 1/4 cup egg, cheese, garlic salt, pepper mixture  into the greased baking cups. Then I added chopped mushrooms and the equivalent to half a sausage link sliced up into each cup. For the adults, I also added chopped bell pepper and spinach. Then topped with more egg mixture. I had enough egg mixture to make 2 more additional muffin cups.  I found that since there are more chunky ingredients, there is less egg mixture in each cup, thus they cook more quickly. These were done in about 15-16 minutes.  I served with salsa which seemed the perfect compliment. It really tied all the flavors together. Sourdough toast and OJ or some fruit round out the breakfast nicely.   This was very easy and fast to make and bake.  Thumbs up from our family of 5, children ages 9, 13, and 16.

I thought these were absolutely wonderful. I give four stars because my husband believed it needed more seasoning. I can agree with that. I used bacon instead of sausage and I also added yellow and sweet red peppers along with the green peppers. I love that it's mobile and versatile.

Easy recipe. I was looking for a quick on the go breakfast and I think I found it. I will make these again and maybe try the hot sausage in them.

These are an absolute STAPLE in my house! My 2 year old loves them, and so does the 5 year old I babysit regularly. My husband and I do, too! We've used bacon, ham, sausage, or just plain with cheese. Always delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly. I used sweet Italian sausage. My husband and I thought this was very good. I wanted something to take to work in the morning. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I sprayed the muffin tin. A couple of the egg muffins got stuck. Next time I will try greasing the tin. Will definitely make again.

Was in a rush and whipped this up with leftover smoked ham, jalapeño sausage, red onion, spinach, and a can of mild rotel (salt pepper, garlic and onion powder). Scooped that mixture into cupcake liners, and topped with scrambled egg and cheese mixture. Fantastic and quick!

I sautéed the onions with a red bell pepper  along with two minced garlic cloves in about a tablespoon of butter with some thawed, drained hash browns. I placed a bit of this mixture in bottoms of muffin tins. Added browned, drained hot Italian sausage on top. Put a little shredded cheese on top of that. Mixed the eggs in a bowl with salt, pepper, dash of milk and a couple shakes of lawry's seasoning.  Poured about 1/3 cup of egg mixture into each muffin tin then cooked as directed. Took to a church breakfast and a couple of the ladies asked me for the recipe. Will make these again. I wanted to add Ortega canned green peppers but didn't have any. Also want to spice it up a bit more as we like it in our home.

Great base recipe! It can be altered to any taste.  I followed the recipe the first time I made it, but now I add red pepper and hot sauce.  Used it to feed a large group, so everyone could sit down and enjoy their meal together.  It received rave reviews. Plus, they look more appetizing than a huge blob of scrambled eggs.

I made the full recipe for my church breakfast this morning. I filled some with ham and some with bacon. The recipe made 30 mini muffins.            8-3-2016 I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting it in half...oh, and using red bell pepper instead of green. It's what I had.  I served these along with cheese grits, biscuits, and watermelon for "breakfast for dinner" tonight. My husband really liked them. Fill them to the rim of the muffin tin. They rise beautifully! Just a caution - the cheese is barely discernible.

I pretty much just did the eggs and sausage. I can't have cheese and don't like peppers and onions. I think in the future I will try it with turkey sausage to save some fat and calories. Definitely a lot of variations to make it suitable for everyone!

I really loved this recipe because it's so versatile. I agree with others when they say it needs a little more spice. I added a little cayenne pepper and fresh garlic and it made a huge and wonderful difference. Also, I made in mini muffin cups for my toddler and he loves them. Thanks for recipe!

I made it use the 2 dozen eggs.  I filled the muffin cups  3/4 full and it still made 34 .  I used Pork sauage, and added the salt. I used the mild cheddar cheese. But the muffins needed more flavor to it.  I  wouldn't want to add more salt, but it needs something more.

This is a delicious, simple, and quick recipe, thanks! I mostly stayed true to the original recipe but made a few personal tweaks for taste based on the ingredients I had on hand. Instead of sausage, I cut up deli sliced honey ham into small squares. I used green, orange, and yellow bell peppers as well as red onions in the mixture. I omitted the garlic powder. I substituted cheddar cheese for a Mexican cheese blend then greased the muffin tins with butter and Pam spray. Removing the muffins from the tin took a slight amount of finesse, but I was able to successfully remove them all while keeping them in tact by using a knife to cut around the edge first, then use a tablespoon to gently pry them out. I enjoyed making this for my breakfast during the week and hope to make it for guests in the future!

Great recipe! If there's something you don't like it is so easy to alter to whatever is in your frig. Ham, bacon, sausage. Any kind of cheese. Add spinach and or tomatoes. I added basil and oregano. You can't mess this up!!

I make a batch of these for food prep for my busy weekday mornings for a low calorie quick  breakfast. I use Jenny-O turkey sausage and usually add some chopped spinach, mix of sweet peppers and onions. My 1 year old also loves them which is a bonus! I freeze them then reheat for about 25 seconds for a hot low calorie breakfast in a hurry!

Made this over the weekend and loved it.  I made half the recipe and used  one diced Aidell's Chicken & Apple sausage.  Used green onion instead of regular onion since that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make this again and have been sharing the recipe with family and friends since everyone loves the idea and it turned out so great.  May play with it in the future, like adding tomato or different cheeses and spices.  But it's a keeper.

I used half whole eggs and half egg substitute and  some spicy sausage. Very good! I make a batch then we just refrigerate and nuke for a quick breakfast each morning. Excellent!

These are perfect!  I am in a rush in the morning and don't have time to cook, so these are awesome.  I use a full pound of meat.  Instead of pre-made sausage, I use lean chicken and add a seasoning blend (so you get less fat and more protein).  Using double the meat gives me more like 16-18 muffins.  Delicious!

This was so good! My parents loved it when I made it for them on a Sunday morning. I used sausage links that I cooked and chopped up into pieces and also added chopped fresh basil and spinach. I'll definitely make this again.

This was easy to make - I used 7 eggs, it made 8 egg muffins.  Used ham instead of sausage.  I thought they were ok, might prefer something with a light crust.  Good for a quick protein filled breakfast.

Made these this morning for a quiet Sunday Breakfast and they were great.  The cooking time was to short for me as I needed to let them go 8 minutes longer but that may be due to the fact that I filled my muffin tin.  After making this as a base recipe I can see the future for spinach and mushroom or a Mexican flare with chorizo and jalapeno or even a basic western omelet style with ham and cheese.  This recipe as a guideline provides an endless array of options, smoked oysters, artichokes, baby shrimp, the list is as long as your imagination.

Surprised the family with this recipe on Saturday morning. I chose to use a mild Portuguese sausage (chourico) that worked out well.

Loved these muffins! I used what I had on hand---leftover ham instead of sausage, an orange bell pepper and chopped up some fresh spinach that needed to be used. They are just what I need for a quick and healthy breakfast.

I always use milk in my eggs, so my eggs are having to bake longer than 25 minutes at 350.  They are still cooking for the second round of 25 minutes.

This was a nice brunch. I made it without onion and green peppers but with extra seasonings. I will do this again with ham, onion, bacon or even with taco meat. Simple and easy, I served it with American fries and buttered toast. Yum!!! I bet they would freeze nice also!!!

An extremely easy recipe that was simple enough to make in a half-conscious state.  Was looking for an alternative to the omelet and various egg breakfast recipes that I typically have during the week.  Also makes it extremely easy to share with family and friends...  

About the only change (and a minor one) I did was to sweat the pepper and onion so that it would be easier to separate and distribute through all 12 muffin tins.  (I tend to chop large).

These egg muffins are delicious !!!  so easy to make and great for brunch or make ahead and eat for breakfast throughout the week -- reheat in microwave for 20 seconds.  I will sometimes use leftover bacon instead of sausage.

We made this Christmas morning for breakfast and we loved it.  I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and sauteed onions with it when the sausage was almost done.  Used a teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  Next time I plan to use hot Italian sausage, fresh garlic and sharp cheddar cheese. I cooked the sausage and onion the day before so that in the morning we just had to beat the eggs, add the seasoning, cheese and sausage mixture.

I made half in muffin cups and the rest in a muffin tin sprayed with non-stick spray. Those in  the muffin cups stuck to the cups, so unless there are any tips for avoiding this, I wouldn't make them that way again. To make this recipe more animal - friendly, I'd crumble up black bean burger, or use a vegan option that is sold in bulk. The black bean burger would add a lot of spice which so many are saying they miss in this recipe.

As I write this review, I am enjoying one of the muffins I made.  I used Morningstar Foods veggie "sausage" paddies, instead of the regular sausage.  I'm finding it to be just as tasty.  I also used more cheese.  Super tasty, especially dipped in a bit of ketchup!

Had to serve with tabasco sauce to bump up the flavor.  The idea of scrambled eggs served as muffins is a nice change.

There's no reason NOT to like this dish. It's surprisingly easy, perfectly easy, tasty and satisfying. I will post a photo if this site allows it. Great recipe I used munster cheese, canadian bacon, diced white onions and eggs.

I am going to make this recipe yet today, and have high hopes for a tastefull, yummy outcome. Folks have alreadt given the suggestions concerning using different-colored sweet peppers, to add coloring.  I'l do that, and come back with any anctual changes, and the report! The whole concept of a grab-n-go healthy snack is one I want to try.

My son and I really enjoyed these, very quick meal for leftover sausage. Hubby liked it ok but said it definitely needed more seasoning. Might try with bacon next time.
