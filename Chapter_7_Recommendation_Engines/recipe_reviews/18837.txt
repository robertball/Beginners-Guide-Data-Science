We loved this!  Instead of the stovetop method -I first boiled the sausage for about 10 minutes and then I through all of the ingredients together in my slow cooker and let the flavors meld together on low for 8 hours...YUMMY!  Served it over rice with veggies on the side.  So good we wish we had more sausage in the house to make it again tomorrow!  Will do again and again...

My family loved it.  It is easy to prepare and would make a great appetizer.  Next time, I'll boil it and then add it to a crockpot with the sauce for several hours.

Delicious!  I made it last night.  I was in a hurry so I only boiled for 10 minutes and baked for 30.  It was still fantastic!

This was delicious! Thanks to comments by others: I cooked the sausage for 20 minutes, In the sauce: I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1 garlic clove to the sauce.  Added sauteed cabbage to the sausage and then covered with sauce, and baked. I served it over mashed potatoes. YUM!

Wow! Definately a winner in my book.  I soaked it for only 20 minutes and cooked it at 350 for 45 and it came out great!  Served over rice is nice.  Might try a little corn starch next time to thicken it up so it will stick to rice and not fall to bottom of bowl.

This was pretty yummy. We used a pre-cooked polish sausage, so we only needed to boil it for about 10 minutes. The sausage came out super tender and juicy. We served it over rice. My fiancee thought it was a tad bit too sweet for polish sausage, but I thought the sweetness was nice and subtle when paired with the flavor of the Worcestershire sauce.

I boiled the sausage for 10 mins and baked for 30 mins per reviews. I only had 1 lb polish sausage so I added more veggies(celery, green pepper, carrots) to the onions. This is a nice and easy base recipe to make when you want a little something different. I increased the amount of water for baking because I added a cornstarch paste towards the end for a thicker sauce.

This was good. The sauce had great flavor. To me, this recipe is best served as a party dish - done in the crock pot.

Made this dish for my boyfriend and his roommate. We had sausage, but didn't know what to do with it. Uses not too many ingredients making this a very easy and tasty dish. Adding pineapples to it gave it a great taste,but  I think I should have added more hot sauce.

This was so easy and so good!  I used a good quality keilbasa and added just 2 additional ingredients to it.  Dried mushrooms and rinsed, and drained, saurkraut.
I love Polish sausage with these 2 ingredients and I couldn't keep myself from adding them. The taste was fabulous! DEFINATELY a keeper!

This my new favorite way to use polish sausage. I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted pineapple juice for the water. I also added the drained pineapple, and a bag of frozen peppers and onions. I put it all in the crockpot on low for 3-4 hours. Served over rice, it was a huge hit.

This was a HUGE hit! I skipped the hot pepper sauce, and used some steak sauce in addition to the Worcestershire (ran out). I turned it into a casserole of sorts, by peeling and slicing a few potatoes, cutting up the sausage, and mixing it all together in the casserole dish with the sauce. I baked it and served it that way. My husband couldn't stop eating it, and finished it off that night! He's not a picky eater, but he really commented on the flavor.

This was BANGIN'!!!! I used the ingredients listed without adjusting anything but I adjusted the cooking time. (just didn't have 2 hours with a hungry teen that would keep asking "When is dinner ready?") I boiled the sausage for 20 minutes while I preparing the other ingredients. I also sauted the onions prior to adding them to the sausage. I cooked it in a dutch oven then drained the water and added the other ingredients, boiled that for a minute or so then added to the oven on 350 for 45 minutes. Ohhhhh yummm!!! The sauce caramalized and was a great contrast of sweet and spice. Next time I may make more sauce to see if I have some extra to put over rice or something.

Oh so good ... YUM.  I boiled it (lite sausage)for 20 minutes while I placed all the other ingredients and a tbls of corn starch into a warmed crockpot to make the sauce.  Perfect served over rice with steamed broccoli on the side.  The next time I make this, I may double the sauce and add red and green peppers, and fresh mushrooms. Also great as an appetizer and so easy.  Thanks vey much.

What a disappointment!  Since my husband loves kielbasa, I'm always on the hunt for different ways to prepare it and had high hopes for this recipe because of the ratings and comments.  While it's true, the dish was not greasy it also lacked the savory flavor I'm use to with kielbasa.  The hunt continues.

This was pretty dang good!  I thought it a bit too sweet, so the next time I'll reduce the brown sugar a tad, but really, it was very very good.  I loved how it caramelized a bit.  Next time I make this, I'll pair it with some mashed spuds like some others have suggested.  Thanks!

I added a little Mr Yoshida's gourmet sauce to this recipe.  Very good overall.  I think I would boil the sausage for less than an hour, though.

This is yummy!  We don't have kielbasa often, but when we do, this will be the recipe we use!  It smelled delicious as it was cooking and didn't dissapoint at the table either.  I think adding the garlic was an excellent suggestion!  Next time, I think a little sautee'd, chopped cabbage would be great add to in too!

This is an excellent recipe and very easy to make!  I simmered the sausage for just 20 minute and it turned out just fine.  You can cut back on the brown sugar.  Plus, depending on the brand of kielbasa, the fat grams may be less than those indicated on the recipe.

This is by far the best use of kielbasa I've ever tried.  It can be served as a toothpick appetizer, or as the main course with rice or possibly a pasta.  The only add-ons I use is thinly sliced red and green peppers, and fresh crushed garlic.I have been wowing my kids' schoolmates, our friends, and family with this recipe for over two years now.

I rarely give a recipe 5 stars, but this one deserves it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I only had 1 lb. of kielbasa, but I still made the same amount of sauce. I was concerned because of how strong the Worcester sauce smelled, but it cooks down, leaving the meat saturated in a sweet glazy sauce. This takes 2 hours to cook, but it's so simple, you have to barely lift a finger during those 2 hours!
This was absolutely delicious and left my husband and I wanting more. We rounded this off with mashed potatoes and corn mixed in with the sauce. Will make again and again! Thanks Bea for a great, simple recipe!

We loved the flavor of this recipe. I followed DC in TX's suggestion and just put everything in the slow cooker after boiling the sausage for 10 minutes. An hour before eating, I mixed in about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with some water to thicken up the juice to serve it over rice. The only thing I would do different would be to saute the onions before adding them in; even after 8 hours, they were still crunchy, and we prefer a soft, cooked onion. Someone else mentioned pineapple juice and chunks...sounds like a nice idea too! Great versatile recipe.

Recipe is definitely one to try.  Even my kids enjoyed this dish!  I used precooked sausage & put all of the ingredients in a pot & cooked it for about 15 minutes.  I added about 3 additional cups of water for extra sauce along w/a little chicken broth to soften the sweetness.  I then thickened it a little with corn starch & served it over rice (w/chicken broth for flavor) and black beans.

We're not a huge fan of spicey and I wanted to try something different with our polish sausage. Instead I replaced the hot sauce with some maple syrup and added a bit of cornstarch and cold water to a jar, shook it up well, then added that to the boiling sauce to thicken it up before pouring it over the sausage and popping it in the oven. The turned out really nice and everyone liked it! I'll definitely make this again, and maybe even try the hot pepper sauce sometime:)

For having a father in law who was born in Poland I had quite a challenge when I decided to make this. He said it was better than his sisters. We also made potato pierogies and our dinner was fantastic.

For taste and preparation this is five stars! I let the sausage cook in the oven for about 35-40 minutes and served over rice.I also added garlic. Next time I will double up on the sauce mixture.

Added 1 lg can chunk pineapple & sauce, omitted water & lemon juice. Reduced Worcestershire to 1/4 cup. Added heaping spoonful of cornstarch, and two dollops of ketchup. Heat sauce to marry flavors and cornstarch, then pour into square baking dish, over sausage, which was linked and  boiled for about 15 mins. Cover w/foil & bake at 350 for 30 mins. Remove foil, stir, bake 30 more mins, stirring occasionally. Let cool 10 mins, stirring occasionally. Very good!

The whole family loves it!  Kids and all.  Not to spicy.....just right.  Every time I've made it, I've gotten the same reviews.  ***** (Five Stars in my book!)  UPDATE:  Great as a make ahead dish.  We did this and put it in foil to warm up while ice fishing.  All you need for utensils are toothpicks. Yummy & easy.  Also another good tip is to bake in a glass Pyrex casserole dish.  It always caramelizes nicely and looks pretty when serving.  Great over rice or over buttered egg noodles.  Either way, you will have no leftovers!

I made this with little smokie sausages I had left over because I bought too many for the holidays. I used pomegranite vinegar instead of the white and it was delicious. 
Thanks for the easy recipe with loads of flavor.

This is my new favorite way to eat polish sausage.  I followed the recipe, except that I mixed a can of undrained sauerkraut with the sausage before adding the sauce and simmered together in a skillet for time recommended (instead of boiling with water).  I think this gives the sausage a great taste.  I also added a little garlic powder and a few extra drops of hot pepper sauce to the sauce mix.  While I enjoyed the sweet taste, I will probably cut to 1/4 cup of brown sugar next time.  Great recipe!

Simple and easy and it works great as a main dish or side dish. My kids (ages 3 & 6) had never eaten kielbasa before this, they loved it. I think the sweetness in the recipe is what made it for them.

These were ok, but not quite what I was expecting.  I may have to tweak the recipe some to get it to my tastes.  Plus I think an hour may be too long for these, at least in my oven.  They were a little tough.

This was OK.  I agree with a previous reviewer, this would be better as an appetizer with toothpicks.  I guess we prefer savory kielbasa recipes for dinner.

My husband loved this, and it was really easy to make. Smelled wonderful while simmering also. Based on the other reviews, I cut the brown sugar down to just 1 tablespoon.  Be careful with the tabasco, I got carried away with the hot sauce and made it a little too spicy.

Easy, quick and very tasty.  I found no reason to boil the kielbasa first - I sliced the kielbasa and poured the sauce mixture over it and baked it for 45 min.  I served it over mashed potatoes.  The sauce was great on the potatoes.  Good comfort food.

Made as is, minus pepper (my taste). Thank goodness because it was spicy enough due to the onions (can't tolerate spicy). It was a very tasty meal, the reason for the 4 star was too much time for such a simple recipe. Plus I'm thankful to other reviewers that cut the time from hour - 45 min.! Although next time I will cut time to 30 min. because the sausage was just a little over done, but still able to eat! We will try this again, thanks for posting!

My husband and I absolutely loved this!  I used 1 lb of Kielbasa instead of 2 lbs and browned it on both sides with coconut oil before simmering for one hour and I used cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp) instead of hot pepper sauce and it was so yummy!  I made some fried rice with White Minute rice which was delicious with this!  Sweet carrots on the side and you have one wonderful meal!  I will be using this recipe a lot, a lot, for sure!!!

I took the suggestion of so many others and boiled the sausage for about 10 minutes and then put everything in the crockpot. The only change I would make would be to add more hot sauce but we tend to prefer spicy food. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I boiled some red potatos then chunked up the potatos, onion, and Polish Sauage in a large pot for about 15 minutes. Drained the mixture and fixed the sauce. I then put in baking dish as directed and baked for 30 mins. I then poured into a serving bowl so the flavoring would cover. It was great

I used 1 LB turkey kielbasa- boiled it for about 30 minutes then put it in the oven for 50 min.  I doubled the sauce.  It was good but not great.  Seemed like a lot of prep work for the result.  Not sure I will make it again.

I, for one, loved this recipe. It took a while, but with two kids to look after, setting something on the stove for an hour, and then again in the oven for an additional hour allows me to get out of the kitchen and play! I made half of this recipe, for me and my boyfriend, and I served it with cheddar mashed potatoes. As soon as my plate was empty, I wished I'd made the full recipe! It was SO good, I will be making this again and again!

I absolutely loved this. I halved the recipe for use with 1 lb. turkey kielbasa, and that does work if you flip the sausages halfway through the oven time (so that both sides get equally coated). Boiling the sausages for the complete amount of time removes the fat & changes the texture of the sausage, making it firmer (but not chewy), and drier but not dry. I can't explain it--it does something wonderful! But you have to like Worcestershire sauce to enjoy these as written, as that IS the dominant flavor. With that said though I'm sure you could adjust the recipe to use soy or teriyaki sauce instead if you prefer that to Worcestershire! I will make this again anytime I have kielbasa or Polish sausage to use up, thanks!

The most important step is the simmering for 1 hour! You must dispense with the greasiness of the sausage for this to turn out well. It is nice and sweet. If you don't like sweet so much, use less brown sugar. I served this with Polish Cabbage Noodles (found on this site) and the sweetness of the sausage went together very nicely with the cabbage and onions!

This sounds weird but it is delish!  The only way I knew how to cook keilbasa was with potato and sourkraut.  This is way better served over mashed potatoes!  Yum!

Very good! I used about half of the brown sugar, and I think next time I will only use half an onion. I also used precooked sausage and boiled it for about 10 minutes. It went into the oven with the sauce for about 45 minutes.

This sauce was yummy! But, I used precooked polish sausage and the sausage tended to get dried out. Next time I will not cook for the amount of time suggested. Or if there is uncooked polish sausage out there, I will try that. The sauce was soo....good though. I served it over rice. I will take that sauce recipe with me to other recipes. It was certainly good!

This has been one of our favorite recipes since I tried it a few years back.  It always turns out good even when I have to make a substitution or cut the cooking time.  We serve it with rice or egg noodles.

This was delicious!  I took note of the other reviewers suggestions and simmered for 20 minutes (my sausage was fully cooked) and then baked in the oven.  Easy and a kid pleaser!

Yummy! I used pre-cooked Polish sausage (very cheap) and it was still excellent and even easier. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. For a Polish girl that is used to the more traditional Polish sausage, this is a delightful change!

Great recipe!  I only had a pound of sausage, but used the rest of the ingredients with the 2 lb measurements.  Next time I will slice the sausage in shorter slices to absorb more of the flavor.

Loved the flavor, I used red pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce. I don't usually like kielbasa because of the grease, but boiling it really took the grease out.

This was so good! I fried the 1 inch pieces with the onions and garlic then made the sauce and baked for 45 mn. I bought the already cooked sausage. Worked out great my friend who ate Dinner with me asked for the recipe right away!

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I used Polish sausage and I did not have 2 pounds so I used a little more than 1 pound and made the sauce for two.

I boiled the sausages for approximately 20 minutes.  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar as I am not fond of sweet meat.  I added about 10 dashes of hot sauce...I prefer spicy to sweet.  I added red, green and orange peppers and served on rice.  It smelled wonderful and tasted great.  It was appreciated by the whole family.

This recipe is gobbled up at potlucks. I didn't boil the sausage as long as indicated. I boiled maybe 15 minutes. It takes some of the grease off but didn't make it very tough. Chopped bell pepper is a great addition to the onion.

What a great flavor the brown sugar/worcheshire sauce combine to make! Very easy. It has become a semi-weekly staple in our house. Serve as a main course or add to your favorite veggie/cheese casserole! Leftovers (if there is any) great on a bun.

I followed this recipe exactly as printed. The slow boiling definitely removes a lot of the fat, which is good, however the fat is also much of the good flavor of kielbasa. I would definitely make it again, but I would only slow boil maybe 30 minutes and reduce the brown sugar to maybe 1/3 C. it's quite sweet, but delicious!

I love that this preparation takes out a lot of the greasiness of the sausage and it is so easy to prepare.

I was torn between 2 stars and 3 stars.  It was ok.  I think too much trouble for the end results.  I'll pass on this one.

I made this last night, and it was tasty.  I had the precooked sausage also, so I only let it boil in the water for about 5 minutes.  I also didn't have time to cook it in the oven for an hour and cooked at a higher temperature for 20 minutes.  Next time I will try the crockpot method others mentioned, since it will likely give the meat more time to absorb the flavors.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper instead of hot pepper sauce since I didn't have any around.  It gave it a nice kick but did overpower the other flavors a bit, so next time I may just leave that out or try chili pepper instead.

Very Good. I did do a few things different. I added Garlic and cornstarch  do to other reviews  and I had to  substitute the Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce. I will make again following the recipe but I  thought it may help someone else.

This is one of the best recipe and easy as well! I had this dish a whole meal by adding potatoes and making a few alterations. My SO couldn't get enough of this dish.
After I boiled the sausage for 20 minutes, I set it aside and added 5 chopped potatoes to the boil in the saucepan until they were only slightly tender. I drained and began the sauce,  adding about a tablespoon of ketchup to the mix. Once that came to a boil, I added the potatoes to simmer for 10 minutes. I added the sausage to a deep baking dish, poured the potato/sauce mixture over and topped that a few seasonings: garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Then comes a layer of a half cup of shredded American cheese (the good deli stuff, don't go cheap on the cheese) and a sprinkle of fresh basil and parsley (mostly for added prettiness).  Bake and watch it disappear!
On a final note, some homemade bread would be the perfect finish to this meal, as the sauce makes an irresistably great dip.

TL:DR  Add potatoes, cheese, seasonings, and homemade bread.

I only seared the diced polish sausage. Then in a bowl I mixed all ingredients. Then once the sausage was basically I added the box sauce. I let boil till it tackle like teriyaki sauce. Yum! Cooked some white rice and used the certain sauce to eat with rice and sausage. Love this recipe.

I simmered the fresh Polish Sausage in beer for 1/2 hour or so and used chicken stock instead of water for flavor. Gonna make this again for sure but next time I'll need to thicken the sauce was too thin.

I took the advice of many people leaving reviews to use the slow cooker - I actually wished I had used MORE sausage and less onion -- it was SO good but too much onion (for my own liking). 

I ran the slow cooker after boiling the sausage on WARM for 25 minutes to let the ingredients really absorb the wet ingredients, followed by another 40 minutes on low, and finally finished on 40 minutes on high. It was tender, the onions had a little crunch left but nothing raw and the flavors were delicious.

Easy recipe to make and carry to neighborhood get together. I adjusted recipe to 6 servings because I had 3 lbs of sausage. Reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup. Used a large Vidalia onion , added 1 garlic clove and hot sauce to taste.  Yum! Will definitely make again!

I used UNCOOKED sausage, NOT smoked or precooked. I removed the casing. Loose meat made into balls works best. I slice up my sausage and let it cook in it's own juices for about 15 mins just to brown and cook half way. It'll finish cooking in the sauce. I omit the water but keep the drippings as the base to add all else to. I simmer covered on the stove, stirring occasionally, keeping it at a low boil, for another 30 min or until it thickens to my liking.  Broccoli is a nice add in at the end. I served over mashed potatoes, white rice or wide egg noodles.
For a slightly less 'sweet' and 'richer' flavor, cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 dark molasses. This is how I usually make it.
Just an old Southern way taught to me by my mom.

My husband said this is the best sausage he has ever had!  I did cut the sugar in half and only boiled about 20 mins.  Other than that, followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Was amazing!!  Thank you for a great twist on kielbasa!

Very good!! Followed the recipe as posted, only omitting the hot pepper sauce, just a personal preference.  My only change next time will be to cut down on the baking time, I think 1 hour was a bit too long.

I made this for a potluck and came home with an empty dish :-). I only simmered the (fully cooked) sausage for about 30 minutes and used the cooking water in the sauce (skimming off the fat). I also threw in two cloves of minced garlic and used a bit more hot sauce. Oh, and Splenda blend brown sugar because my Dad's diabetic. It received raves from the party goers!

We liked this!  I used turkey kielbasa and only simmered on the cooktop for about 10 minutes.  Added ketchup to the sauce ingredients and left out the onion.  Baked 30 minutes, then returned everything to the saucepan and added a cornstarch slurry, like others have done.  Very good!

The sauce was nice, however didn't enjoy it with the polish sausage.  It reminded me of the grape jelly/chili sauce meatballs, only this was MUCH more work.

Great way to make sausage!  Even my very picky family of 5 all enjoyed this recipe, definitely a keeper.  Made just like the recipe called for but added a can of chunck pinapple (will leave out next time!), the only part the family didn't like.  Next time I'll stick to the original recipe.  Served over rice with steamed peas on side, perfect meal...only problem was there wasn't enough.

We really enjoy this dish. I have made it three times.  It's easy and quick especially during weekdays when we are all busy. I use the precooked polish sausage and boil it in water for about 5-mins to remove some fat and I follow the instructions to the recipe.  I have also reduced the sugar to half of what the recipe calls for.  It's not a fancy dish but something about it keeps me coming back for more.

This review is from a Polish person. Not worth the trouble. Takes way too much time to prepare. This was tasty but it's not special enough to warrant the time it takes to make. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 C, added garlic to the sauce & covered the kielbasa with sauteed cabbage then baked. Served over mashed potatoes. I don't see myself making this again but who knows. Thanks.

This was not a hit at my house. They were very overcooked. Maybe I cut them up too small.

I changed it a lot, but it was a good base recipe. I didn't cook the sausage first because it's already precooked. I added about 1/4 c. ketchup, used Splenda instead of brown sugar, and added a can of pineapple chunks.  It was very good.

This was really good over rice for a main dish.  Skipped the boiling, but would probably boil beforehand next time to cut the grease.  Didn't taste really greasy, but it was there.  Did add a clove of garlic to *umph* it up a bit.  It's not overly sweet, but not your usual savory sausage either.  Good stuff!

This was great!  My husband loved it and he is kinda picky.  I have even done this without boiling the sausage first and it worked fine.  It is a once a week or so keeper.

Good recipe, I added three times the hot sauce which worked out great.  I also added two cloves of garlic minced, which created a great flavor variation.  Thanks!

This was good. The sweetness was a bit too much for some, but the majority of my dinner guests really liked this dish. In the future I would add more pepper sauce to even out the sweet & spicy factor.

It was alright.  Too sweet for our taste.  I served it with egg noodles and added about a cup more water while cooking.  If I were to make it again, I would keep the added water and reduce to brown sugar, maybe by half.

Mmmmm mmmmm.  A welcome alternative to the usual ways to prepare polish sausage.  Seems to be a flexible recipe as far as time goes, and very easy.  I boiled for 1/2 hour and baked for 1 hour.  Onions were omitted due to husband's dislike of onions.

This is good, but I would suggest using it more for an appetizer than a main dish. It is a bit too sweet for a main dish, we thought, but is delicious and would make a good appetizer. Interesting mix of flavors, in a good way.

What an absolutely lovely recipe!  I was running very late today and didn't have time for the big meal I'd planned.  I had 2 pounds of kielbasa in the freezer and found this recipe so I gave it a try.  I put it all in the crock pot, and the only change I made to the ingredients was to add 1/2 cup boiling water at the end because I thought I let it go a little too long.  We were especially pleased with the way the tough kielbasa skin cooked up so soft and chewable.  Really, a lovely recipe and I thank Bea very much for sending it.

I made this last night & it was great!  The kids even liked it!  This would also make a good appetizer, however, the 2 hours is a little hard to handle.  You have to decide ahead of time to make this.  But it sure was good & I'll make it again!

A good quick meal.  Tastes even better the next day.
