I divided the cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella in crust; 1/2 cup cheddar in main dish

Made it Keto friendly! 
Omitted bread crumbs in crust 
Use 1/8 tsp of psyllium husk in place of flour in eggs

Could eat this everyday! So good!

Apparently, my cauliflower was too big so I had way too much crust.  No problem, I made 2 quiches.  I had to make another egg, cream and flour quiche base.  Oh and to stay away from wheat flour.  I put 2 tablespoons of almond flour in the cauliflower crust and 1 tablespoon of coconut flour in the quiche base.

This was a great dinner dish. We ate it for lunch and breakfast too. I added asparagus and mushrooms! Very good and enjoyed by all!
No photo as we ate it too quickly.

I didn't have cauliflower so I used hashbrowns as the crust. Prebaked for 12 minuets. Turned out great.

I’m not a big sausage fan but my husband loves it.  I found a sausage with venison in it. This was truly excellent. I also cooked it in a cast iron skillet to get an extra crispness to the “crust.”

Next time I make this eye appealing quiche I will spice up the cauliflower crust.  It is a little bland.

I liked this recipe very much but the crust was a bit bland. Will add nutmeg and Italien seasoning next time

There was no salt or pepper in recipe, so I added 1/2 tsp to crust mix, and coarse pepper to the egg mix.  My wife thought I should have "cubed" the sausage, but it was fine for me. I had quite an pile of riced cauliflower, but after frying in pan, it gets minimized and was the right amount for the pie dish.

Overall it was pretty good.  Couldn’t find whole wheat panko so used regular. Also used hot sausage.
