This was ok. I followed the recipe exactly, but also added a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips along with the toffee bits. I didn't like the "streusel" on top- 1 cup was way too much and it made the top of the cake taste dry and mealy. The cake also bubbled over top of the streusel and toffee chips in several places so the cake wasn't very attractive either. It satisfied my craving for sweets but I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

This was a very quick and easy cake to make, but it just did not excite me.  I thought it was ok but nothing at all special.  The base was pretty bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked for 40 minutes.  Thank you for sharing but its not something I will be making again.

I have made this cake twice so far, and didn't need to change the recipe at all-it's very good and quick to make.I was not able to find the 6oz bags of toffee chips so I used just 1 10 oz.

This tasted fabulous!!! Everyone at my job loved it. I made it in a bundt pan, which is not a good idea because I tried to remove it and it looked terrible but tasted great!! And so easy to make!
