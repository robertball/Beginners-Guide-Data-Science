I was hesitant to make this recipe with only one review but I am glad that I did.  I really liked this cookie.  It was light tasting and soft.  I don't like hard cookies.  I used McCormack Gourmet California Lemon Peel for the lemon zest and followed the recipe.  The lemon taste was light and when I make them again I will increase the peel and the ginger.  Thanks for sharing.

If you like lemon, you will love these delicious lemon cookies.  The baking time was a little longer for me than the time listed in the recipe.

I put some green or red sugar to give a festive feel
might add more zest next time.

These are delicious, i used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar and i mixed crushed hazelnuts with sugar and put it on the cookies with the help of a spoon.

These are quick and easy and yummy. However, if you have lemon you have a lemon, why not use real lemon juice instead of cream of tartar? I didnâ€™t have tartar so I used lemon juice. I will make these again, probably tomorrow because I want to try them with sherbet in a cookie sandwich and I think the kids will have eaten them all.

I've made them twice.  Once using coconut oil and once with crisco. They were just okay. I would like more lemon flavor. I used zest of 2 lemons
