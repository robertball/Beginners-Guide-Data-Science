This whole concept of making scones with soda fascinated me! I used Sprite. They were so easy to make, came out very tender, and tasted like a light biscuit with no lemon flavor at all. I didn't have lemon curd or mock Devonshire cream, so I iced the top of mine with a lemon glaze. I will definitely keep these in mind for my next tea party.
