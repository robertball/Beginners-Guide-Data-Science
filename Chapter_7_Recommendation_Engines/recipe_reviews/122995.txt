This is a great recipe for meal planning. However, I only cook them until they are no longer runny. Then I allow them to cool before I place them in labeled freezer bags. As they cool, they will thicken up. By doing this, they are not rubbery when they are taken out of the freezer and reheated.

Really good! I added 1/4 C. mayo and 1/4 C. water to scrambled egg mix so they would puff up, with incredible results. They rose about 1 inch above the muffin cup.  I almost made half the recipe, but am glad I used the whole dozen, DH and son ate the last one this AM.

This is a great use for most types of leftover veggies...I used mushrooms and red peppers with cooked bacon. Here is a solution for the messy cupcake pan - use the aluminum/tinfoil disposable cupcake liners.  I tried paper and aluminum - the muffins stick to the paper cupcake liners - even with spraying them but the aluminum cupcake liners come off on their own...leaving behind a beautiful fluted design on the muffins.

These are very easy to prepare.  I bake them and then store them in the freezer for use during the week.  Watch them - it is easy to overbake!

These are very easy and very good.  I made them with small differences, instead of the onion and pepper, I added about 1/3 cup mostly drained chunky salsa.  I also used 8 eggs and 1 cup egg substitute.  I made them in mini muffin pans (Cooks about 12 minutes and makes about 48 mini muffins) for a church reception and got LOTS of compliments.  I also made some using just eggs, cheese, diced ham and salt and pepper.  They were super popular!  I made them Friday and kept them in some tupperware until Sunday.  Then reheated them at 200 degrees for about 15 minutes.  I'm going to have to see how well they freeze...because I got requests for more!

These were super easy to prepare and my kids loved the idea of a hand-held breakfast. I did make a couple changes to suit our household. I cut the recipe in half, used two eggs and the rest were all egg whites. I used red pepper and added fresh garlic. I DID saute the veg in a small skillet while the sausage was cooking. Very good. Even I could eat them! I think I might add mushrooms next time or use bacon. TIP: If you use mostly egg whites like I did, be sure to grease the pan really well. Otherwise, you'll have a mess on your hands.

I really enjoyed these!  To lighten them up, I used canadian bacon in place of the sausage, used 6 eggs and 6 egg whites, added extra veggies (red pepper, broccoli) and used light cheese (wouldn't recommend fat-free cheese for this recipe). One of these muffins, a yogurt and some fruit is a very filling protein-packed breakfast!

I cooked breakfast for a few friends this morning and was trying to think of something to do with eggs, green pepper, and onion. Voila! I had lil Smokies on hand, rather than the typical breakfast sausage, but those diced up worked just fine. Everyone loved these and they were SO easy to make for a group! I served them with optional sides of ketchup, salsa, or hot sauce.

Delicious and perfect for a quick and easy breakfast! I made these more into a quiche though. I sprayed the bottom of my muffin tin with Pam and "lined" in with bread that I cut with a 2 inch biscuit cutter. I cut the amount of eggs way down using only half and added some milk to get these a bit "puffy". I used green onion as no type of onion was specified. I used chopped Canadian bacon vs. pork sausage and added a bit of dijon mustard to perk up the flavor. I baked this at 375 for 20 minutes and they came out really good.

This could obviously be made a lot faster and with a lot less fuss if just simply scrambled on the stovetop - but then you'd totally lose that "these are so darned cute" effect!  I made these in silicone cupcake liners sprayed with Pam and just lined them up on a cookie sheet, using a soup ladle to fill them.  I used bacon rather than sausage, fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and red pepper rather than green, which gave these such nice color.  To make sure the peppers and onions were cooked through I sauteed them before adding to the eggs, to which I added some half and half and chopped chives.   There's a lot of room for creativity and versatility in terms of ingredients - ham, sausage, crab meat, salmon, different cheeses or vegetables, herbs - the possibilities are really limitless.  They're delicious, although how could they not be? Cute and colorful too - they rise up puffy and tall and get a nice, golden sheen to them.  I don't know that I'd bother with these little guys for a whole bunch of people because it would just be too putzy, but for just Hubs and me it was a special little treat on the plate this morning!

These were simply delicious!  What a yummy breakfast, brunch or lunch meal!  I doubled the cheese (I won't next time, as it was unnecessary), added some coriander and parsley and omitted the green pepper because I didn't have any.  But I'll definitely add the pepper when I make these again.  Yum!

I thought these were very good, quick, simple and endless possibilities.  I sprayed my muffin tin very heavily with original PAM; spooned sausage into the individual spots; then filled with egg mixture; baked for 10-12 minutes; let sit for 1-2 minutes; ran a knife around edges and they popped right out.  As in baking cookies or cakes, if you let baked goods cool more than 1-2 minutes, they will stick; you can always pop them back in the oven to warm back up and then do the 1-2 minute rule.

The onion really overpowered the flavor of the eggs and sausage. Next time I will cut back on the amount of onion.

After reading numerous reviews, I still coulnd't decide between a greased pan or liners, so I did 1/2 and 1/2.  After baking, the first greased one I tried to remove was a bit tricky, but eventually came out pretty well and the rest followed suit.  The lined ones of course popped right out of the pan, but the egg stuck to the liners so much that we ended up with hardly anything left to eat of those.  So I would advise to use a heavily greased pan.  The flavor is great, the texture is okay.  A little like over cooked scrambled eggs with a rubbery texture.  Kids didn't notice, or they didn't care, because they ate them all.

I make something similar to this.  First I grease the muffin pans and then take grand biscuits and flatten them, and then spread them in the pan.  You can then fill them with your egg mixture, top with cheese and bake until the biscuits are golden brown.  I wrap and freeze them for camping trips, quick breakfast's ect.  Then you have your bread with your breakfast too.  Numnum

I undercooked these just slightly and still found them to be on the dry side. If I were to do them all over again, I'd use less egg, more cheese, and I'd add sauteed mushrooms. Then I think these would be bearable or perhaps even good, but this recipe didn't do it for me at all. Dry rubbery eggs just ain't my bag, baby.

We've made these for years and the kids love them!  I actually add a 1/3 to 1/2 of a raw biscuit in the tin with the other ingredients.  I've used all sorts of breakfast meats, egg and/or egg substitute, various cheeses... you just can't mess these up!  And who doesn't love a portable breakfast?  Great re-heated, too!

Fantastic concept! I used the idea from this recipe, but only used Bacon and Cheddar in mine. They were a huge hit at Easter, re-heated well and will be a staple at my house. I was really surprised at how great these were- Thank you!

I got 15 muffins from this and they tasted great, but stuck badly to my well-greased pan.  Next time I'll probably just do it in a skillet like regular scrambled eggs.

I have been making these for months (as I am on a low carb diet).  Instead of Eggs, I actually use the Southwest Flavored Egg Beaters to make it more healthy!  I make these Sunday evenings and pack them all week as breakfast!

Made with diced left-over turkey, red pepper, jalepeno, green onion and mozzarella. Thru in some fresh dill cause I had it. They were done in about 20 minutes. Light, fluffy and tasty. Will definitely experiment with these.

I had to give it a 4 b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I read through most of the reviews and maybe people are having a problem with sticking b/c they are not using sausage? At any rate, I made this for the first time for company so couldn't take the chance of it sticking. I sprayed the tins with pam and also put a little butter on the bottom. Like some reviewers recommended I did put a little mayo (about 1/4 cup) and a little milk (about 1/4) and mixed in my electric mixer with 16 eggs. I used 1 lb of spicy sausage omitted the onion and added a little bit of dried jalepenos and almost a cup of shredded mexi cheese blend and filled about 1/2 full. I took them out when a knife inserted in the middle came out clean and took them immediately out of the tin. NO STICKING whatsoever! They slid right out. They were great! I will definitely try them again, with other veggies.

Great recipe!  Something different from your standard scramble or omelet.  I halved the recipe since its just the hubby and I.  Next time I'll make a big batch and freeze a few for his breakfasts.  Also, I think I'll try them with bacon.  Thanks Cathy!!

yuuuuummm.  I added 1/4 c mayo and 1/4 c water as someone suggested and it made the muffins light and airy.  They look awesome coming out of the oven but they sink down---don't know if treating them like a cream puff shell (turning off oven and cracking oven door open) would help that at all.  Still very good.  Leftovers are great and easy to microwave for a quick breakfast next day.

Folks, WHEN YOU'RE FEEDING A CROWD, this is the way to go.  Serve them on napkins with potatoe patties, potatoe gems or tater-tots and forget the washing up.  Great idea.  Who wants the hassle in the morning.

10/6/2009  Made these for breakfast for my family and company.  What a hit!  Just like an omlett but easier.  I added diced tomatoes and extra onions, green pepper and cheese, as we like lots of veggies in our omletts.  We also used tabasco sauce to dip these in.  I did a double batch and put the rest in individual ziplock bags for a quick and easy breakfast for our on the go family.

Easy, peasy breakfast. I'm at home alone today so I scaled it to 3. I used my silicone muffin cups. Didn't have any meat. Used a bit of half & half, very good hot sauce & very sharp cheddar. They were so good. Very versatile recipe to play around with.

Fantastic!  I've made these 3 times now.  I just cool to room temp and wrap 2 to a package in plastic wrap and freeze.  My family just microwaves in the morning for a quick hot breatkfast.  Easy recipe to change up the flavors of the ingredients.  Thanks Cathy - I see your recipe in my future for a very loooong time.

These were really good. I would make them again.  Definitely don't forget to grease your pan like the OP says. Let's just say that "non-stick" is an expression to be taken with a grain of salt.

Easy, versatile and quite good. You really can put in any filling you like. I made a bunch of them and kept them in the freezer, just pulling one out and reheating for a quick breakfast.

Taste was good, but everyone is right...a messy cleanup!  I didn't use liners, but sprayed the pan well, and it took 2 days of soaking to get all the egg off!  Not sure if it's worth the work....would rather just make a casserole.

A great little fun way to serve up hearty eggs.  I halved the recipe for the 2 of us & it was perfect for a 6-count muffin pan. These were great even without sausage (wanted to make a vegetarian breakfast).  I had 1/4 cup chopped tomatoes to use up so I added them & we loved the result.  We enjoyed these along with our cheesy grits.  The muffins did stick to the pan a little bit even though I sprayed it pretty good, so next time I'll try the aluminum muffin cups as suggested by others.  Thanks for sharing this great breakfast recipe!  :)

I'm not rating actually this recipe because I'm just commenting on my own recipe that I've been making for years:  I divide the cooked sausage and vegies (and feta cheese) between 12 muffin cups, then I pour a carton of liquid egg substitute over the fillings until the muffin cups are full.  Have one of these "muffins" with a piece of fruit and you have a really great, filling, and fairly guilt-free breakfast.

This is just like a recipe I have , except I add green chili's (canned), ,add the cheese, I dice up bread(plain white) for this I would use four slices, 1 cup of milk, and 1/2 stick of melted butter ( the real stuff). Will make more muffins and should not stick as bad, if it does add a liittle more butter. Have a great day ya'll !!! ;)

Thanks for a cute way to make breakfast, Cathy.  I've made these a number of times and I've discovered I enjoy adding shredded carrots, a handful of chopped baby spinach and a little milk.  I don't even bother with bacon or sausage.  And I can get by with only 6 eggs plus ingredients filling all 12 cups.  They are a little on the heavy side but I still enjoy them as well as I do making them.  Very fun.

These are really good, and I love how they are perfect sized for my bento lunches. I individually wrapped each muffin in plastic wrap and then placed in a freeze bag and froze for future meals. I used 10 eggs, 1/2 cup of pepper jack cheese, and a mild pork sausage. I seasoned with pepper and Johnnys Greek garlic seasoning. I also cook these until no longer runny and finish letting them set up while they cook in the pan. Cooking these in silicone bake ware was the way to go.

These are excellent!!!! I made a split batch of these doing 6 ham/green pepper/cheddar and 6 bacon/jalapeno/cheddar. I placed in individual ziploc bags and placed in the freezer. I pop them in the microwave for 1 minute wrapped in a paper towel and they turn out wonderful! What a great on the go breakfast! I love the change up from my usual Oatmeal or Bagel! Thanks!

These are essentially little omelette cups.  It would take just as long to prepare them traditionally in a pan, but I do like the portability factor and portion control.  These are a great low-carb meal or snack to have frozen and ready to pop in the microwave whenever you need them.

I like the simplicity of this idea.  This fit the bill for what I wanted: easy to make quickly, the kids will eat it willingly, provides protein, easy for the kids to get it themselves out of the fridge.  I've made it a couple times and have just used either ham or bacon, with cheddar cheese.  I will try adding baking soda next time for more lightness, and will probably make it a bit more like a quiche by subtracting eggs and adding cream (a crustless quiche).  Also, be sure to not let the muffins sit in the pan very long after removing from the oven; take them out of the pan as soon as you can so they don't over cook from the heat of the pan.

These stick to the liners if I use liners, and stick to the pan if I don't.  Heck to clean up.  I vaguely recall learning somewhere that protein will stick to a pan if it's not hot enough when the food is added to the pan - something about if the food congeals quickly upon contact then it cannot adhere to the surface.  So I think next time I'm going to try and grease the tins then heat the muffin tin in the oven while I prepare the ingredients, then add the egg mixture quickly and put it back in the oven.  Failing that, I will cook it in a rectangular/square glass casserole dish and cut it up afterwards into squares.

I made these as a different reheat breakfast. They were super simple to make and really good. MY daughter loved them both fresh and as reheated leftovers the next morning. I added a bit more garlic then called for but that is just a personal taste. I also left out the peppers because we aren't a big fan of them

Pretty good, and excellent for company. Made these for a brunch and everyone couldn't stop talking about the presentation and what a great idea it was to have an egg dish with virtually no last-minute effort. I accidentally cooked mine a minute or two extra and they were on the dry side, so be careful to take them out as soon as everything is set, and perhaps consider serving a sauce on the side.

I loved these! The 5 stars is actually from my husband who is pretty picky about food. I added sliced mushrooms to the bottom of the cups and poured the egg mixture on top. I also mixed in a little chilli powder. Topped them with salsa. They were great!

Brunch was entirely off this site: Blueberry French Toast, Glorified Hashbrowns, Peach Praline Muffins, and Scrambled Egg Muffins. Yummy and super easy recipes! The scrambled egg muffins were a split decision: I love all eggs, any way possible and only thought they were okay. My mom is picky about eggs, but loved these. Weird! That said I like how easy and portable they are. And I adore that they are portioned out. I left out the sausage and added 2/3 c milk and they were very moist. I think these would be fun to serve "make your own" style with a topping bar set out, perfect for a little one's slumber party!

Cut in half and it made six perfect muffins, using 1/3 cup mix for each.  Easily came out of my silicone muffin pan with no mess.  Didn't have bell pepper so used a little celery.  Might add some jalapeño next time.

Made these for a weekend when I had a few friends as houseguests and they were a huge hit! I made several batches because of differing tastes. I'd say go easy on the salt, because adding the cheese also adds some salt, and my first batch with cheese in them was REALLY salty. But they were still popular!

I made these using bacon since i forgot to buy the sausage. I sauteed the onion a bit in a tad bit of the bacon fat to soften them up a bit (no one like a mouth full of raw onion in this house). They were pretty good. I can't wait to taste this with sausage! (please make sure you spray the muffin tins generously as they stuck to the sides pretty bad)

I love this recipe!  I was making my daughter eggs every morning but now just make these and freeze them.  I added some diced up sausage patties we had in the freezer, some diced orange bell pepper, and a little mozerella cheese-they were great! I also only cooked them until they were not runny then let them cool and put them in the freezer for the week.  They continue to cook when you take them out of the oven, so you need to take them out a little early!  Great recipe, easy recipe, perfect for some make-ahead breakfasts on the go!

BEST BREAKFAST ON THE GO!  I make these now every week so my husband and I can bring them to work, pop them in the microwave and get an easy hearty breakfast.  TIP: I use 8 eggs and 6 egg whites to lower the cholesterol content a bit. I use the foil liners and spray each one generously with original PAM.  This will get them out right away when done, but they do sink in like a souffle so it's either that or less spray and they will stick a bit to the sides but keep a better shape in the end.  Either way they are DELICIOUS and you can put anything in them you want! Very forgiving recipe very make-your-own.  I used peppered bacon and red peppers, next time I will use mushrooms w/Canadian bacon.  YUM!!

Didn't care for these at all.  Too dry and too messy. I have a recipe that you add the eggs to pastry cups and bake.  Much better and much much less of a mess.

So easy and SOOOO good! I used bacon instead of the sausage, and added diced mushrooms, but other than that, followed the recipe. A huge hit, and is already a favourite.

We really enjoyed these.  Quick and easy to make with whatever you have on hand.  I used bacon, some left over sauted mushrooms, onion and fresh galic instead of galic powder.  Husband said they reheated nicely.

Very tasty and easy to make for large groups! Even if you're in a hurry this is a quick fix but tastes like you spent all morning in the kitchen! Tastes good alone or even put salsa on it!

I made with 2 eggs plus 8 egg whites, omitted the sausage and added red bell pepper...very colorful! I also took another's suggestion for freezing and cooked them only until they weren't runny...this way they don't overcook next time I reheat them~

These are great!  I omitted the sausage and lined the muffin tins with a thinly sliced piece of ham and it helps reduce the "stick".

These were good, and easy to make.  It worked out well for our family, because I could tailor them for each person (no sausage for the vegetarian & no cheese for the lactose allergic).  Make sure to grease the tins well, because they tend to stick.

The muffin pans are a terrific idea.  I sometimes use tin cans with both ends removed to mold the egg but they tend to leak.  Another "lighten up" idea:  instead of sausage add some of the "fake" crab.  Perhaps some red pepper too to counter the bland crab taste.

I think this is a nice spin on quiche. I made this without cheese. I sauted red peppers with grape tomatoes and green onions. I also substituted fresh garlic sausage and fresh garlic. I sprayed the bottom of the muffin pan with Pam and put the red pepper mix in the bottom of each muffin cup. At the same time, I made a pkg of 5 minute couscous and mixed it in (while it was still warm) with the egg/sausage/cilantro/salt mixture/dried oregano. I only used 5 eggs. The mixture made 18 medium sized muffins. My hubby loved it.

This is a great recipe! My family gets together every sunday for brunch, and these muffins have become a huge sucess at my house. I like to mix it up a bit, sometimes ill substitut the sausage for bacon or for little chunks of ham, or sometimes Ill use all three. And I find the onion a little too strong so i chop up green onion instead. Everyone loves these!

I made these exactly by the recipe.  They were pretty good, but nothing to rave over.  It tasted just like an omelet only in a different form.  I would have preferred if they were a bit cheesier, so next time I may increase the cheese.

I made these with ham instead of sausage (therefore no dirty fry pan required). They're tasty and fun. But make sure you grease the pan really well or they won't want to come out. Also, I would resist the temptation to add dairy product to make the eggs more fluffy and moist. The first time I made them I added some sour cream and the muffins didn't come out of the pan at all, even with teflon coating and a good greasing.

I just made 6 of these and they are great.  I cut the recipe in half, and had a little left over so I decided to fill the cups up to the top.  I added a little milk so that they would be fluffy.  I used bake spray on the muffin pan and they slid right out of the pan.  I'm going to freeze what I have left over and reheat them later.

Such a great idea but I couldn't get over the consistency. Because reveiwers complained about ruined muffin tins, I used disposable; I also used muffin cups - they baked for at least 45 minutes, stuck to the cup and were a little too mushy. I might try adding some kind of Bisquick for texture.

These were delicious!!  I changed 2 things.  1) added more veggies only because I like a little more crunch, and 2) baked them in "Texas Muffin" pans.  It made 8 bigger "muffins" and I baked them for 5-10 minutes longer.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Very Good!  I first prepared the recipe as directed here.  It was really very good.  Then, I prepared it in a way I consider a little bit healthier.  I used deli-sliced sundried tomato turkey slices chopped up in place of the sausage and added a teaspoon of fat-free mayonnaise.  I also used fat-free cheese as well.  It was different, but very tasty.  If I could eat it that way, I think the original recipe is best.  I have included a photo of my healthier version.

These are tasty and easy to make. Not great but good. These do cook quickly and I would only cook for 15 min. next time. In addition I will try adding milk to the egg mixture as the egg muffin was very dense. Even denser when reheated the next day.

This is a decent recipe, I would rate the taste as "average", the biggest problem is the clean up.   Based on reviews, I very heavily greased the muffin pan as I did not have aluminum cupcake liners.   The pan took my husband and I approximately 20 minutes of vigorous scrubbing to clean.  Frankly the food was not worth it.  Bottom line,  the food was good/average but the clean up was much too much trouble!

I think this is a good recipe to refer to, even if you don't have sausage. I have used chopped deli ham in lieu of sausage, and also have made veggie versions using chopped sweet peppers and broccoli, even feta cheese. I only use 6 eggs, which make 6 medium muffins... perfect amount to keep in the fridge for me and hubby to grab for a quick breakfast.

I call these my "clean out the fridge" muffins. I had 10 eggs, a handful of spinach, 1/4 of an onion, and some baby carrots, so that's what I used instead of meat and bell pepper. Next time I plan on adding some hot sauce to the mixture, we found these a bit too bland.

Made these for the first time and they are great.  I used diced turkey ham, red bell pepper, onion, mushrooms and cheddar cheese.  I upped the veggie content quite a bit so used only 10 eggs and still got 12 muffins,  I also added a tsp of baking powder for a little lift.  These were a big hit.  Good any time meal idea and the variety of fillings is limited by only imagination.

What a great idea!  Just made these for breakfast for my children and me...they were delicious and so fun and easy, too.  I just tweaked it to our tastebuds and used bacon bits for simplicity today.  Can't wait to have them with the sausage...my husband will love these muffins!

I used 6 eggs and added what I had in the fridge...diced ham, shredded Mexican style cheese, salsa, milk, salt, and pepper.  Topped with a little more cheese when I pulled them out of the oven.  I sprayed my silicone muffin pan and didn't have any problems with them sticking.  Super easy to assemble and tasted great!  I will definitely make these again and again!

The taste of these were excellent!!!  I was a bit disappointed when they fell after pulling them out of the oven, but perhaps I didnt add enough mayo to make them more fluffy.

These were really good and easy to make ahead, freeze and reheat.  Be sure to spray the muffin tins well for easy removal.  Spicy sausage is a plus, if you like a little more kick.

I made a batch of these in attempt to have something healthy and fast on hand in the morning. I used about 3/4 of a small carton of liquid egg whites and 2 whole eggs. I added plenty of chopped green pepper, tomato, onion, & a small amount of shredded cheddar cheese. Plus a dash of milk, salt & pepper, and garlic powder. Whisked everything together and baked for 25 min. I let them cool and stored in the freezer. In the AM I just pop one in the microwave for a min and half and I'm out the door. Definitely use paper or foil liners! If not, make sure you heavily grease/spray your muffin pan.

I loved these.  I made mini muffins with ham and cheese. They were so easy and good!  For those who have issues with sticking....I just used baking spray and they popped right out.  Great recipe. Thanks.

I cooked the onions and green pepper with the sausage.  I think, as written, it is a tad bland for my taste.  However, it is an easily adjustable recipe that you can make to your own liking.  That is the beauty of it.

These weren't bad, but I thought they were pretty dry.  Worth working with, though, so next time I'll add some American cheese and a touch of milk.  They DID disappear fast, though.  I love the concept!

Made these several times and always great just as described in the recipe.   Doesn't taste like eggs and presents well on the plate.  I have also substituted seasoned ground turkey for the sausage and increased the peppers to make it a bit lighter, also excellent.

Oh yummy!  These turned out really nice, although they stuck to the muffin tin a bit and didn't look as nice and poofy by the time I wrestled them onto a serving plate.  Still, for once a crustless egg dish didn't go watery on me, so I was happy.  I sliced up 5 precooked turkey sausage links, left out the green pepper, added a few dashes of tabasco, used pressed fresh garlic instead of powder, and saved the cheese for last, sprinkling Swiss on half of them and Cheddar on the other half.  The guests to whom I served them pronounced them "very good" and had no preference between the cheeses.  I only had a Swiss one, and it was mighty tasty.  I will definitely make these again.

These were SO yummy!  I did a bit of a healthy take on them, and made fewer, because I'm the only one who eats eggs.  For 6 muffins, I used 1 cup southwestern egg beaters, 2 tbsp. water, 2 tbsp. nonfat plain yogurt, 1/4 cup chopped mushrooms, 1/2 a plum tomato chopped, 1/8 tsp. onion powder, 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, salt & pepper. I used a disposable muffin tin (after reading all the reviews about sticking!) and sprayed liberally with Crisco spray.  After I poured the egg mixture, I crumbled 1/2 strip of cooked bacon on top of each, and distributed evenly 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese.  I baked them for about 22 minutes, then turned the tray upside down onto a foil-lined cookie sheet (they popped right out - no sticking!) and stuck them back in the turned-off oven for another 3 minutes (I like my eggs pretty well-done).  They were gorgeous!  (And delicious!)

These are yummy but labour intensive so make a big batch and freeze them.   Definitely use foil muffin liners or grease LOTS or they will stick.   A great idea for the freezer.  I think I would have all the ingredients cooked/shredded/chopped the night before to make these for a group in the morning.

What a wonderful recipe. There are so many different variations to try. Finding wheat-free recipes can be difficult - especially breakfast. It's a tasty addition to a wheat-sensitive person's diet. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were really good. They needed a little more spices and they looked so beautiful in the oven, but when I took them out, they fell. My husband wants me to make these when his parents come next week...I guess that says something!!

I, too, used the aluminum liners in the muffin pan.  I would have used the paper, but I read one of the reviews.  I liked the onion, switched the green to red pepper and added cheddar powder as well as cheese to this recipe.  It was great.  My son didn't even think of using ketchup on these muffins.  Thank heavens.  Do you know how hard it is to prevent a 5-year old from using ketchup on eggs?  I will make this until he gets tired of it.  Thank you Cathy!

I followed recipe as written (I always do the 1st time)  I also took other reviewers advice and froze cooled muffins for quick breakfasts.  They really are good.  I'm a borderline diabetic and these have just enough protein to carry me through the morning without a "slump".

I kept mine simple, just eggs, cheese and ham.  They are wonderful.  I wanted to break my kids' sugar-y cereal routine, and this is just the ticket!  They do re-heat well, without being rubbery.  It keeps them full through the morning and gives them protein instead of sugar to start their day.  Perfect!!

WOW!  These are awesome!  I had to make some changes due to what I had on hand.  I used canned diced chiles instead of bell pepper and bacon instead of sausage.  I halved the recipe and got 6 huge muffins.  I sprayed with Pam and didn't have a problem with them sticking at all.  My kids each had 2 muffins!

Delicious!  The only problem was that although I sprayed the crud out of my nonstick muffin tin, the suckers stuck in there, so they did not come out beautifully.  But as I said, DELICIOUS!!!

Phenomenal!  I added 2 ounces of canned, chopped & drained jalapenos....next time I'll add the whole 4 ounce can but all the seasonings and vegies were spot on.  Will definitely make again.

This was very tasty. I changed it up a bit based on the veggies I had on hand but it was very good. I added mushrooms, ham, peppers, hot sauce and onions. I sprinkled cheese on top. I pulled mine out of the oven around 16 mins. Not only are they great for breakfast/brunch, but also a good snack. Thanks for the idea!

Very good and versatile.  All of the children liked them and they were solid enough for the children to eat them as finger food, yet elegant enough to bring to a brunch.  Excellent idea. Be careful on the time.  I only had to cook them for 14 to 16 minutes.

Wow, so easy and delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and used two veggie sausage patties, microwaved for one minute then chopped up, red bell pepper instead of green and added about a tbsp. of snipped chives.  What a fantastic breakfast/brunch menu item, easily tweaked to appease your family's tastes - whatever you put in your scrambled eggs or omelettes, you could probably put in here!  I can't wait to make this again - Thanks for sharing!

These were great!  I subbed ham for sausage, per personal preference and swiss for cheddar, because I forgot the cheddar at home and my mom had swiss!  Very simple and even I enjoyed them (and I'm not a big fan of *eggy* dishes!).  These were a nice addition to our Mother's Day brunch.  Try them!  The variations of endless.

These wowed everyone who has gotten to eat one. I made these for grab and go breakfasts and put a bunch in the freezer. My husband took some to work and he just called me to tell me how great they are and how they are all raving over these "muffins". Thanks, these are a winner!!!

I made this recipe in mini muffin pans and it was a hit with the kids!  I used a silicone mini muffin pan and they just tumbled out.  You really have to watch the timing though, 5-7 minutes was all it took.  I topped them with cheese for the last two minutes.  Great to freeze and take out for kids for a quick snack

What a great idea for a picky family.  I made it a family affair and everyone added their favorite ingredients to the egg mixture.  I placed small plates of sausage, ham, bacon, jalapenos, tomatoes, feta cheese, cheddar cheese, green peppers, spinach and onions out and let the family do the rest.   Thanks for the idea!

These were good and work really well if you don't have time to cook breakfast.  If ANY egg mixture gets onto your baking pan, clean it BEFORE you put it in the oven - once that stuff bakes on, it's baked on for good (had to throw mine away).

they were great and even my husband sayed they were really good and that says alot.  Im not much of a cook but you cant mess these up.  I used ham and half eggs and half egg beaters. heard complaints of sticking so I lightly coated the muffin tin with margarin and then sprayed with olive oil well and used alumanim pain and they slid right out

Fantastic!  I used 8 eggs, green onions, 8 Morningstar Farms sausage patties (made it very meaty, could have just used 6) cheese, and cut a circle out of some day old onion buns to put in the bottom (this made 11 muffins for me).  Baked for 20 minutes at 350 and they were perfect.  So excited to have my breakfast for the next two weeks already made!

Delicious and easy!  I sprayed silicon muffin pan and had no mess whatsoever.  I substituted the sausage with the pre-cooked bacon that I intentionally overcooked in the microwave for crispiness and added Louisiana hot sauce to the mixture to give it an added zing.  Calorie count using large egg, bacon, and 1/2c (rather than 1/4) fat free shredded cheese cheddar was about 120 calories. These could easily be made less than a 100 calories with egg beaters and a few other modifications.

Quick,easy and extremely customizable! I recommend using muffin liners as the eggs were difficult to get out and the pan is a mess. Muffins were a hit with kids and hubby so I will certainly make again.

I like a lot of spice and added paprika and kosher salt to this recipe. I also opt to Hot Sausage. I used Maple once and it really didn't do well.

Very good and easy to make. I did sub some of the eggs with egg beaters and that worked great! I didn't really taste the cheese, so I'd either use a little more or perhaps sliced cheese.

We LOVE these!!!!!! I use a whole pound of sausage, just cause that is the typical package, and it is perfect (my husband always prefers more meat, anyway;-). They are so easy & quick to make & eat! I make them the night before then leave them in the refrigerator, already in the pan. Just throw in the over a few minutes before we want them! Great as leftovers too!!

Yum!  Simple, easy, delicious, and versatile.  I used bacon because that's what I had, and skipped the onions because my kids don't like them.  Made for a great breakfast in the car when we had to leave too early to eat at home.

I made half of this recipe using 6 eggs, 1/2lb sausage, 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup green pepper.  I filled 6 cups with 1/3 of the mixture.  Many of the muffins overflowed - which may have to do with me changing things.  I will say that every single one of them stuck and came out looking beat up.  I highly suggest spraying heavy with non-stick.  I will probably just make omelets next time because it's less messy and faster.

Yummy, yummy!  I've wanted to try something like this for a while.  I did as another reviewer said and addesd some mayo and water to make them puff up while baking (about 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup respectively).  I'll work on them not sticking to the pan next time.

I used bacon instead of sausage, finely chopped colored peppers instead of just green, 1/4 cup dried minced onions instead of the raw onion, 1 cup cottage cheese instead of the shredded cheese.  We love this recipe.  Making it again tomorrow.

OMG. Just made these. They turned out great. Did take others advice and grease the pan.  Having company in Oct. will be serving these for breakfast.

Yummy. I added extra sausage, onion and bell pepper, which I loved but my hubby thought it was a little too much.

This is one of my family's favorites now! I made some changes because I didn't have some ingredients on hand, namely green pepper. I chopped up fresh spinach and used more cheese. I also used frozen turkey breakfast sausage. I chopped it in pieces and added it with the cheese and spinach to the muffin tin before I added the beaten eggs. That way every muffin got an even amount of everything. I served them with biscuits. Delicious! Big hit with the family! I plan on making 2 muffin tins for our church Sunday School class. Thanks so much for the recipe!
Sincerely in Christ,
Leesa C.

An easy recipe and a huge hit! The options are endless, and even the plain and simple muffins are gobbled up by the kids. I use a small food processor to easily whip up a batch. The mayo suggestion from another user is divine!

My husband really likes these, so in my book that's a winner!  I used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers and a bunch of chopped up mushrooms---sauteed them lightly along with the onion with the fat-drained sausage.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I had a little trouble removing them from the well-greased muffin tin, but I had a LOT of trouble cleaning the muffin tin afterwards!  I'll try some of the other options offered here in the reviews to correct this next time.  And there will be a next time.

I loved how quick and easy this recipe was. But I just don't understand the high ratings. I made it exactly according to directions. The muffins stuck to the pan even though they were greased and not overdone. The most I can figure is that either 1. This recipe just isn't for my taste. and/or 2. I used the wrong kind of bulk pork sausage? It has happened too often though that I am excited to try a recipe with a high rating and I don't like it.

These were really good.  I made them for my kids, quick and easy.  Even though I used liners and sprayed them thoroughly, the egg mixture stuck to the liner which was frustrating.  But again, great for kids, can freeze or put in the fridge for easing heating throughout the week.

They were a fun little novelty and I imagine a great addition to a brunch.  But for the family on a regular Saturday morning?  Not so practical. And a little dense.  And can we talk about the pan?  There's nothing worse than scrubbing baked-on egg from a cupcake tin and I greased well.  I think I'll stick with my breakfast burritos for a "make-ahead and freeze for individual breakfasts" option.

These were quite good. I used cooked bacon instead of sausage, but followed the recipe for everything else. I did spray my pan with cooking spray, but still had some sticking.....oh well, it was still worth it! I wrapped them up individually with cling wrap, put them in a freezer bag and now they are ready for a quick breakfast.

Very quick and delicious! I only made a few changes - I thought I had sausage in the fridge bot no, no bacon either - so I cut up some ham and used that. I also left out the peppers as my kids won't eat them. I then greased the cups with real butter, baked and and....YUMMY! I served with blueberry coffee cake from this site and we were off to a GREAT day! Thank you for this welcomed change breakfast!

My son absolutely loves these.  He likes to add a liberal dose of hot sauce before baking.  We wrap and freeze these for individual portions.  Great breakfast for a family on the go.  I know that he's eating well and I don't have to get up early to make him a decent meal in the morning.

My family loves these.  From my husband to my 3 year old daughters.  They are easy but a fun change for eggs.  We make them different ways each time.  The first time we followed the recipe and loved them and since we realized how easy they are we change up the veggies and meats depending on what we feel like or what we have in the house.  If I am not using sausage in a batch then I use a little bit of mustard to get some spice.

These are very good and very adaptable to variations. I have made them all summer for my 19 year old son working labor for the summer. He liked grabbing a couple from the frig and running out the door! Thank you!

These turned out good and 2 of them made a nice breakfast entree.  I added a little mayo and water as one reviewer suggested to make them puff up, which was fun.  Overall very good.  Would make them again, as they are kind of a novelty, too.

Great tasting a fun!  I can't believe I haven't thought of something like this before.  I made these for a quick brunch one day after my husband's soccer match and they were delicious, easy and so flexible -- they're a great conveyance for whatever you have on hand.  These scrambled egg muffins were such a wonderful new idea for me.  Thank you!

These are very good and are great for anyone eating breakfast on the go.  I modified the recipe and used chopped turkey sausage links, reduced fat cheddar, and Egg substitute.  I also threw in some chopped mushrooms. Even with the LF substitutions they were still impressive.

Good but not great!  It tasted almost like egga you would make on a skillet.  I recommend adding 1 jalapeno (seeds removed), faux sausage (Morning Star) and more cheese!

Delicious.  Added 1/4 of a fresh jalapeno, finely minced, and used veggie sausage (Morningstar), which we cooked/sauteed & chopped up, to add to the batter before baking.  Delicious, served with fresh avocado & some light sour cream!

If my picky two year old loves it then it's a definite 5 star in my book.  Unfortunately, I can't comment directly on these, because I don't eat eggs.  But, my son and husband (and even the dog) loved them.  I did add a bit of leftover ham, but otherwise made them as is.  Thanks for the great breakfast recipe that will definitely will be made again.

These were a hit with my boyfriend.  We both loved them and I will continue to make these often with many different meat/veggie combinations.  Instead of the green pepper/onion I used 3 T. picante sauce.  Yum!

These turned out GREAT! I used silicone muffin wrappers, sprayed with Pam and mine came out beautiful! I am going to try to freeze them for upcoming company. I will tell you how they reheat at a later time

I couldn't get mine to come out quite right.  They stuck to the pan when I went to take them out.  They tasted great though, and I love the idea, so I'll try again ;)  I also used pepperoni instead of sausage, added 1 tbsp milk and 1 tbsp flour.

Very good.  Used diced ham instead of sausage.  Baked 25 minutes and they were over-cooked.  Next time I will add more cheese and bake for less time, but a new family favorite.

I halved the recipe since it was just for my husband and me. I didn't have sausage so I used ham and the muffins were absolutely amazing. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because the clean-up of the muffin tins was a BIG pain, even though I greased them and used whole eggs ( and not just egg whites). Maybe I'll try paper cups. Thank you for this new twist on eggs for breakfast!

These were a nice change from the usual breakfast. I would like to do away with the rubbery, dense texture of the eggs, though. This is a very versatile recipe that would allow for a lot of different add ins. Thanks for sharing it with us!

These were really good! I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used spicy sausage, red bell pepper instead of green, and I halved the recipe. I had two problems... although I did grease the tins with cooking spray the muffins still stuck to the pan pretty well. Some of the muffins crumbled because of this. My second problem was that when I filled the tins only one third of the way full I had enough for 12 muffins instead of 6 (like I said I halved the recipe). There was really no need to only fill a third of the way because the muffins didn't really rise that much. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will grease the tins extra well, and I will fill the tins all the way to the top. Thank you for this fun breakfast!

GREAT recipe! I didn't have a lot of the ingredients so used whatever I had, just eggs, ham and cheese and it came out very good. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a tbsp of water and it came out fluffy. Also, I did not use any seasonings. The cheese and the ham gave it plenty of flavor. I sprayed the muffin tins with Pam and it came out without any problems, unlike some reviewers' comments. You can totally vary this recipe to your taste. AWESOME recipe!

These were really good and everyone loved them! I only used half of the sausage and a handful of chopped green onion instead of white onion. I added some diced tomatoes to a couple of cups, also, for some color.  I spread Crisco in the cups instead of spraying Pam and the eggs came right out.

4.5 Just what you would expect, a sort of hearty omlette in muffin form.  Will certainly make again.  I sauteed the onions peppers quickly before adeding just to make sure they would be cooked thoroughly.

I made these for Christmas morning with my family.  Everyone loved them, even the people who showed up an hour late.  The reheated muffins disappeared.  I didn't have all of the veggies that I needed so I used salsa in some and fresh veggies in the others.

This recipe ruined my pan!  Even though I sprayed the muffin tins the eggs really dried on them. The muffins came out in pieces.  Maybe would be better to use muffin tin liners.

Very good, but be sure to take it out while it's stil a bit too gooey to ensure perfect texture when served. It tastes just like any basic scrambled eggs recipe, only with goodies and in a convenient form.

This is a nice recipe!! I use an Italian sausage cut into little bits and I also rolled up two pieces of lunch meat and cut into bits. Did not have shredded cheese so I added about 1/8 cup of grated Parmesan and diced pieces of green, yellow and red peppers. My bf and the kids loved it. Next time I will leave out the sausage and put it on the side; the flavor was too much

What a simple yet tasty way to serve eggs!  I modified the recipe for my kids (less garlic, no veggies!).  I didn't have any meat on hand, and just made it minus the meat.  Then I poured the mix into shaped holiday cookie sheets and baked for 5 minutes.  Using one reader's suggestion, I pulled them out of the oven while they still looked a touch undone.  They set quite nicely as they were cooling down.  When I popped them out of the pan, I was even excited.  It was so cute to see egg-shaped stars, santa hats, christmas trees.  The kids loved them!  I wanted to upload a picture, but they are all gone.  Thanks for such a simple way to brighten up a school morning's breakfast!!!

Quite delicious.  I had them for a brunch and everybody loved them.  I used pepper jack cheese and goetta (a Cincinnati breakfast meat) instead of sausage.  They came out a little dry, so I advise taking them out at 20 minutes instead of 25.

Very tasty and fun to try adding things to it!  HOWEVER!!  I recommend using cupcake liners.  The non-stick cooking spray didn't work for me.  I spent way too much time scraping out my cupcake tin after dinner!

The kids loved them! I was planning on making omelets but I knew that the kids wouldn't go for veggies in them so I opted for these instead. The kids raved! They could not taste the veggies :) They took longer to make than omelets but were worth the extra time. Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks Cathy
What a easy and wonderful recipe. We don't eat pork since I have had pet porkers. We used spiced turkey sausage, which is also low in fat. I cubed the cheese and didn't use salt as the sausage has salt. I wish I had your creative mind to come up with something so simple and so dang good. I give you six stars. Thank You

Great easy recipe for a crowd.  I made homemade breakfast sausage for another dish in my brunch, so I used bacon in these instead.  I also added chives.  Very good when cooked at 20 minutes, but ovens do vary.  Just pull them out right at the point they look almost done as they will cook a bit after you take them out of the oven.

I made these for the office breakfast one morning, and they are a hit!  You can get creative and add different veggies and meats, or be super healthy and use Egg Beaters and low fat fillings.  If you use cupcake liners, they will overflow, so don't fill it as much!

Really good! Added 1/4c mayo and 1/4c water to eggs and sauteed the onions first.  Greased the muffin tins with a tiny bit of margarine and they popped right out.  Easy to make and very cute.  May try to incorporate potatoes/hash browns in the future.

Really good, full of flavor and texture, nice and moist.  My grandchildren ages 5 and 8 and I made them for their dad's birthday brunch today.  Everyone enjoyed them immensely.  Kids really enjoyed all the egg cracking and mixing.  Served with potato pancakes, english muffins and a fruit plate.  Thanks for a good breakfast dish recipe.  I used disposable muffin tins and buttered them up before filling them.  The "muffins" popped right out, no sticking.

These are perfect for bringing to a brunch!  They're easy to make, easy to transport, and so easy to eat!  You can mix up the veggies and cheese for variation and even friends who "don't like eggs" liked them!

I sauteed the onion and red bell pepper while cooking the sausage.  They were okay, but probably will not make them again.

Even though this is such  a simple recipe that even I could do it (!), I wasn't sure if my picky kids and husband would like it-- they tend to go for the "traditional" look for breakfast.  My kids loved them (my 3 year-old --who never eats much-- ate 3!!!)  and my husband who is a GREAT cook said they were really good and asked they be made again!  May try sausage next time and a little seasoning, but for someone who isn't very good at cooking, this was a HIT!!!!

I made these so my husband could have a quick breakfast before work. I plan on individually freezing them. I did eat one myself and while they were good, they were rather dense. I think adding a bit of milk would help fluff them up a bit. I also tried to put these in muffin liners that were sprayed with pam. They still stuck. Next time I won't be using the liners. I also used a 1/4 cup versus the 1/3 cup scoop reccomended. The 1/4 worked perfectly.

love how these looked when they came outta the oven! :) i just threw this together with what i had in the house (eggs, shredded cheddar cheese, ham, salt, pepper), added a little bit of milk to fluff it up and also put pieces of honey butter flavored Grands biscuits (as others suggested) for the crust after spraying with Emeril's buttery spray (mmm butter). because of the biscuit-crust i'm DEFINITELY making these again, but i'lm also going to have to make sure i put in more ingredients like the peppers/onions/sausage.

I used chorizo, and it came out great.  I used half with liners and half greased with an olive oil spray... I have to say that the non-lined ones came out nicer, and I had no problems with them sticking.  Also, I had extra mixture, so I actually filled them more like 2/3 full, and I thought they came out to a nice size- more puffing out at the top.

Yummy recipe!!  Although I forgot to add the garlic, they came out great.  No problems with them sticking in the pan.  I used a corn oil cooking spray, sprayed into muffin pan until it actually looked like it was way too much!!!  They just slid right out and gorgeous were they!!!  Oh, did I mention yummy too??

Awesome recipe. Quick and easy just the way I like for Sunday morning.  I cut out the sausage (didn't have any) and used salsa and doubled the green pepper instead to help bulk it up.  Next time I might use muffin liners or try greasing the tin a little more since it stuck a bit.

Excellent!  Very tasty and very convenient to serve, especially at a group breakfast. As per Valorie's suggestion, I tried adding 1/4 c. mayo and 1/4 c. water and much prefer it with the addition.  I also use red peppers instead of green peppers as I find it give it a much rounder taste! Great recipe and serving idea! Thank You!

7 egg whites & 7 whole eggs + a sub of turkey sausage to make these a bit healthier.  Then made them in larger muffin tins w/ 1/2 cup scoops.  This gave 137cal, 8gfat, 2g carb, 14g protein. I think they need a little something to make them pop now though, I'm thinking some hot sauce would really help so I'll try some franks or chipotle sauce in the mix next time.

went to 1 heaping t of garlic powder, 3/4t of pepper, 3/4t salt, 1T+ of franks red hot sauce, & a hint of chipotle powder.  Also seasoned the ground turkey with garlic, white pepper, chipotle, & alepo.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I took another readers advice and added 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup to make them rise.  They rose beautifully.  I didn't have any trouble getting out of the muffin pan.  I just sprayed it really well with pam.

I used a mix of egg beaters and egg whites, with 1 T of fat free sour cream for each egg equivalent.  A touch of dill weed, turkey sausage and it is an elegant meal fit for a couple of old diabetics

Followed suggestions from other reviewers for healthier alternatives.  Loved the ease of preparation.  The cooking time allows to cleanup and other meal tasks which was great.  Will be using this in my menu planner for at home and at the cottage.  Husband really enjoyed them and I have a feeling that grown children and company will enjoy them as well.  Thank you for a great addition to my meal line up

I made this once as written, and once with what I had available and both times they came out great.  My changes in the second round was to omit the green pepper and used some leftover mushrooms and potatoes...yummy!  My 2 year old ate three of them!!  My only complaint is the clean-up...even with using some non-stick spray, it took some hefty soaking/scrubbing to get this cleaned up!

I used breakfast sausage links that I had left over from day before breakfast and it worked great to just cut them up.  I also changed the cheddar cheese to co-jack as this is preferred with my family.  I tried the version with the drained salso cause I did not have green pepper and onion on hand--good idea.  My son topped his with sour cream.  Will have to try the freezing method for a later date, they were a good hit for Mother's Day brunch with the family.

These were really good, and reheated nicely. I also made them with egg beaters and those were good but they did not hold up as well. My only struggle was even with majorly spraying my muffin tins the eggs still really stuck and the tins were a bear to clean.

This was just average for me.  I like my eggs a bit softer and fluffy.  The eggs turned out kind of chewy and dense.  This type of baked eggs just isn't my cup of tea.  It is super convenient but just make sure you grease your pan VERY well (EXTRA BUTTER).

These were very good. I added some red bell pepper as well as the green. Next time I will saute the veggies with garlic before adding them to the egg mixture to add a little more flavour and soften them up a bit.

The flavor of these was great but my biggest complaint is how they stuck to the muffin pan. I used pam spray to grease the cups and the egg still really stuck on. Next time I might try making these with the little paper cups you use for cupcakes.

I loved the flavor of these and they were a big hit at the brunch potluck I took them too.  However, I had major issues getting them to NOT stick to the pan.  I tried greasing the pan, a silicone pan, and muffin cups and they always stuck

What a clever idea!! The idea alone should get 5stars. I made some with sausage and some with bacon. This would be very good to make for guests. Will make again.

These were so easy to prepare!  I used almost a full pound of sausage and left out the peppers.  It made 12 good sized muffins.  Works great to make at the beginning of the week for quick breakfasts every morning!

I cannot believe how easy and delicious these are.  We're snowed in today, so I used cooked bacon rather than sausage.  My 17 yo son ate 8 all by himself.  Much better than scrambled eggs I make. In fa Oh, also cooked for about 15-16 minutes as recommmended by others.

Easy and versatile! I loved the idea of this recipe.  I added bacon, shredded cheddar, & leftover diced chicken florentine (spinach and chicken). Cooked for about 20 minutes and it was perfect! All kids ate it and they looked very cute. I will be making this and passing it along. Great idea!

I thought it was pretty good, but I think it would have been better if it had some bread crumbs, or was cooked in a hollowed out muffin or bread roll (freezer style, so  the bread cooks at the same time.)

Made these this morning and froze most to have on hand for weekdays when I am running late and need a nice grab-n-go breakfast.  Great idea, but I left out the sausage and used just the whites of the egg as I am TRYING to change that diet!!!  Very good and fluffy.  Thanks!

These were very fluffy and tasty. All I had on hand were Lil Smokies, so I just chopped those up and they tasted great. I omitted the onion and green pepper and added slices of pickled jalapenos, for my spice-loving boyfriend. I think these could have used a bit more cheese and they were a bit hard to get out of the tins (I greased them liberally). Thanks for the great breakfast idea.

I had to bring an egg dish to MOPS today and didn't have a lot of time.  These egg muffins were a HIT, and SO easy to make. People were asking how I made them.  

The muffins weren't "pretty", but they were good.  :)  (I used bacon instead of sausage, and Tastefully Simple Onion Onion instead of actual onion.  Left the green pepper out because not everyone likes green pepper.) It was really good!

This was really great!  I didn't have any cheese, I used red peppers instead of green and little smokies instead of the sausage.  One "muffin" was quite filling and mine really did work out to one egg per muffin cup.  Delicious!

Delicious.  Also, one of my family will not eat sausage or green peppers, so for his, I diced up and browned pork roll, and substituted it for the sausage and I left out the green peppers.  We really liked the original version, but I think we all liked the pork role version even better.
