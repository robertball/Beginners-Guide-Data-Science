Very good - would give it 5 stars but I did make some alterations.  First, I used about 1 1/2 cups of croutons, 5 eggs and 1 cup of milk.  Otherwise, the casserole would have been very flat in an 8x8 dish.  I used crumbled bacon instead of ham, and with the butter and cheese, the casserole was a bit greasy so next time I would cut down on the butter a bit.  Would also possibly add some diced onions for extra flavor.  Overall, a very easy and tasty recipe.  WILL make again!

***UPDATE***Made again without butter (coated croutons with butter flavored cooking spray).  Tasted just as good but a lot less greasy.  Also rolled the crumbled bacon in paper towel to remove some grease.

Very YUMMY! My fiance and I have made it 3 times already since discovering it! I've even tried baking it immediately after preparing it, as opposed to letting it sit for a while, and it turned out just as good. I've also used ripped up hamburger bun pieces instead of croutons and that worked fine too. I now cut down on the amount of butter as previous reviewers suggested and the casserole is much less greasy. Oh yes, I also use 5 eggs and a tad more milk to fill the pan a bit more, but the casserole fluffs up a bit while baking. Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM!!!!! This is a great and easy recipe to make for breakfast! I did add 6 eggs insted of 4 and used 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 to avoid any "burning" of the croutons.  I have made this three times now and each time I try something new..I'll add green and red bell peppers and onions and the next I added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Very Tasty!  In fact, I plan to double the recipe and make for the upcoming Easter holiday. Thank you Pat!

I made this Christmas morning.  Did not have croutons so I put some bread in the oven and toasted it and then cubed it and used that.  Delicious!  This recipe is definitely a keeper, and one that I'll use again and again.  Everyone loved it!

This was excellent, wonderful flavor. I cooked it in a loaf pan and had no trouble with too dry. The boyfriend actually commented on how tasty it was, and he's not into eggs! I made it as stated, except had no croutons so I just cut up a piece of toast. Nommy! UPDATE: This time I am trying to clean out the fridge, so I added some cottage cheese, half a green pepper, a chopped roma tomato, a little spinach and some basil. Used toast again and had white cheddar on hand. Popped it in the fridge about 4 pm and threw it in the oven at 6:45. Took about an hour to cook with all the extra stuff-and I had to dump out a LOT of extra grease-but turned out great! Much richer with the cottage cheese.

This turned out GREAT!   As most of us do - I try to cut back here and there.  Where it called for butter I used "I cant believe its not butter" and I made my own croutons (baked).  I heard its healthier to do so (store bought ones are fried.  I used low fat cheese & milk!  YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW!   Great recipe.....  Thank You

So easy and great tasting.  The bonus for me is that this is a breakfast casserole dish feeding four, as opposed to 40.  :)

I made this for Thanksgiving brunch.  It was very simple and delicious.  I scaled it to 12 servings and used a little more croutons that called for because I used chorizo sausage instead of ham.  Chorizo is very greasy!  I also made my own croutons from fresh mini loaves (white & wheat).  Everyone loved the casserole, even the kids!  I will use this recipe again.

This was a very good breakfast and i loved the fact you can make it the night before.  I agree with the other users that you should not use so much butter and i think I might even try bacon bits the ham seemed to be a bit much

I hate to say anything negative but I have to put my 2 cents worth into this.  The croutons did nothing for this recipe.  I have made a 'great' breakfast casserole for fellow workers, but this would not have been it.  I have eaten some sorry egg casseroles at B & B's and this was to me like some of them, unimpressive.  Sorry, but I won't make this one again.  Some people are easier to please than me.  I am a 'breakfast person'.  My husband wasn't impressed either.

If you’re not a fan of stratas or bread puddings, like my husband, you won’t care for this either. But for me this was such a nice change from the umpteenth variation of omelets or scrambled eggs. I added my favorite omelet ingredients, mushrooms and onions, and used a flavorful and plump, freshly made garlic crouton from our market’s bakery.  I really enjoyed the addition of the mustard which gave this just a little flavor twist.  It served real pretty too and was a cinch to throw together after supper last night to pop in the oven early this morning.  Nice.

Made this morning with Canadian bacon and reduced fat cheddar and sprayed with cooking spray to omit the butter. I also used egg beaters and it was delicious.  Simple basic recipe that you can tweak to your own tastes/dieteary restrictions!

What ever you do, don't omit the butter and use something terrible like Smart Balance, which is just colored water!  I used potatoes instead of croutons and omitted the mustard since I didn't have it on hand.  This turned out wonderful!

For someone who coupons, I can almost always get croutons for nothing. This recipe absolutely comes in handy for using those croutons and it's filling and tasty to boot. I took one of the other reviewer's suggestions and used six eggs instead of four and I added some sauteed onion, garlic, mushrooms and red pepper as well as a little chopped chives and fresh black pepper. Next time, I think I'd cut the butter back some and use a little non-stick spray in it's place as it did turn out a little greasy. My kids really loved this. It's almost like a puffy oven omelette. VERY simple to make as I was cleaning up the kitchen from dinner and to just pop in the oven as I was waking up in the morning. This one's a keeper!

This recipe is surely a keeper! From a health angle I would use Pam (or equivalent) spray, or at least switch to the unsalted variety of butter. Parmesan cheese, in addition to being better tasting, seems to offer less calories than cheddar.  Also, I suggest your chunk of refrigerated cooked ham be boiled a bit (~15 min) to bleed off its excess salt content, before slicing for use.  Ditto for tasty variants, e.g., exotic sausages like merguez or chorizo, to vastly reduce their excess fat.

Delicious! Since I am counting calories, I omitted the butter altogether (per others' reviews that it was too greasy) and added a thawed/drained box of chopped broccoli between the cheese and ham layers. I made it for breakfast with a group of friends and everyone loved it! It was so easy and I will definitely make again and again.

I use buttered on one side, bread, lay on bottom of casserole, butter side down, makes a great "crust" on bottom of casserole,
then mix all ingredients except cheese, and meat, sprinkle meat on bread,  pour egg, etc. mixture over bread, sprinkle cheese on top, refrigerate and then cook as directed, till done, so easy so good!

The first time I have ever eaten a breakfast casserole, so I have no bench mark to measure this against, but we really did enjoy it.  I did make this slightly different, I used seasoned croutons and sprayed them with pam spray.  I topped with cheese, diced onion and mushroom and then finished off with the milk and egg mixture, I omitted the mustard (as I knew my boys would not like it) and seasoned with plenty of salt and pepper.  Finished off with ham and another sprinkling of cheese.  I did bake for an extra 15 minutes than the recipe called for.

This is a really nice simple recipe with a lot of taste mileage for the work =)
I made it once with ham and cheddar (plus a bit of fresh parsley), and the next time with browned and crumbled sage sausage and Swiss. Both times I only used about 1 tbsp. butter, which I used to generously grease the pan. I also used 6 eggs. I have made innumerable egg casseroles, and have waited a long time for a recipe I actually like...this is "The One"!

The genius of this recipe is that it is easy to make, delicious to eat, and very adaptable.  We enjoyed it as it was written as well as when I've made some changes.  For Easter brunch, I used 1 cup of croutons tossed with only 2 T butter.  I added one more egg to the mix and let the casserole sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I brought the casserole to room temperature then added another 1/4 cup of cheddar over the top along with 1/2 cup of diced ham. The casserole baked up puffy and delicious and was eaten all up. 
It is our go-to breakfast casserole. It's also great cooked in big muffin tins as individual servings or in mini-muffin cups on a sampling buffet.  A bonus is that this is so satisfying, no one was hungry until dinnertime.

The taste is excellent and we can't wait to try other varieties. Like many of the readers we did not let the dish sit overnight. It turned out fine. However, while we like butter, it amazed me how uch grease bubbled out of this. better to cut back the butter!

Delicious!! I didn't have croutons, so I tore up bread that was in the freezer, and that worked just fine. I also added black olives, diced onions, and salt and pepper to the egg mixture, and everything turned out GREAT. I love this recipe because it's so flexible based on what you have in the refrigerator, but it brings scrambled eggs up to a whole new level!  Highly recommended, and this will become a new regular-breakfast meal for me.

Very good! I added a little extra milk, 5 eggs instead of 4, and chopped onion. I would cut down on the butter next time too like others suggested.

I have made this recipe for years, so I am not surprised to see it posted here.  It is our Christmas morning breakfast.  I particularly love it because I prepare it the night before.  So simple, and you can add whatever other ingredients you love.  I have even made it with crabmeat instead of the bacon or sausage.  I always add onion powder and garlic powder to the egg mixture for more flavor.  It is really good!

Made this for a house-ful of people and everyone loved it.  Only change I made was to use day old french bread cut into chunks instead of the croutons.

Loved the ease of this recipe by using croutons for the bread.  Taste was spot on.  For the first time I made as written only doubling it for a 13 x 9 pan.  The next time I'm going to add onions and peppers and maybe try it with sausage.  This is a great recipe that I will return to again and again.  Thank you siegmunp for posting this.

This is basically the 'Christmas morning wife saver ' in the best of bridge.  Have made it for years. The one in the Best of Bridge is better.  This is a very small portioned recipe

This was pretty good!  I read lots of reviews, and decided to skip the butter.  I used Smart Balance spray on my baking dish, and there was no sticking.  I suspect that this recipe will accept modifications such as peppers, different meat, spice, etc. fairly well.  I will be making this one again . . . thanks for the recipe!

This tasted really good!  Cut down on butter, tho.  I needed 3 paper towels to soak up extra.

This recipe is so versatile! I can add veggies, spices or different kinds of meats and it always turns out perfect. I usually double it and put it in a 13x9 pan. This is a regular in our house.

Wow!  My whole family loved this and ate every last crumb!  I made a vegetarian version with a sausage substitute, and it turned out great.  I could see this becoming a family favorite right away.  I did increase the croutons so they pretty much covered the bottom of the pan, but I left the other measurements as in the original recipe.

I was too tired to prepare it the night before but I don't think that mattered.  Wegmans only had maple-cured ham that day and that sweetness did not work with the savory, i.e., use plain ham only.  Overall, my guests liked it, but it was really nothing special.

Mine came out dry and almost burnt...I even had to put foil over it for the last 10 minutes for fear of a blackened top.  An 8x8 baking dish was much to big for this recipe.  I wish I'd tried it in a 1 1/2 qt dish, but I won't be making it again to see if it's any better.  Sorry. :o(

this was good.  i used ham, and added some mushrooms.  not an over the top delicious recipe, but certainly an easy and cheap meal to fill the belly.  i used a garlic and onion crouton, which gave it a nice flavor without having to chop up a real onion and garlic.

This was just okay for me.  The ham made it pretty salty, but it's a great way to use up croutons.

This was very good and different from my other egg bake recipes.  Like many others, I did make it "my own" - mainly by adding more eggs.  We are hearty eaters and everyone enjoyed this dish.

I made this for a big family gathering this weekend, and it was very popular even among the picky eaters. I bought seasoned focaccia bread with jalapeno's at the grocery and diced and dried it to make the croutons. It really added flavor to the dish.  Also, I would recommend using much less butter, as the dish seemed too greasy (I think the cheese would probably melt out enough grease without the butter, since it goes on top of the croutons.) Also, I added a small can of diced green chilies to the egg mixture for a bit more flavor.  I did not refrigerate overnight, just assembled and cooked it right away.  Very good!

We love this casserole.  I did up the croutons to about 1 1/2 cups.  I also use egg beaters and fat-free evaporated milk to save some fat and calories.  There is also no need to refrigerate, I just pop it into the oven.  Super yummy!!!

This was very good. I also didn't have croutons so I stuck 2 pieces of toast in the oven until crispy and brown and that worked perfect. My husband and mother-in-law thought this was excellent.

I really liked this recipe even though I made changes.  I feel okay rating it even with the changes because it's one of those recipes that's easily modified to suit different tastes.  Based on other reviews, here's what I did.  I sprayed the dish with butter-flavored Pam instead of using butter.  I used a whole bag (about 1 1/2 cups) of Texas Toast Garlic and Butter croutons, which added a great flavor.  I used 5 eggs, but kept the milk at 3/4 cup.  I also left out the mustard, used bacon bits instead of ham, and put the cheese on top with 2-3 minutes of cooking time left.  For anyone wanting to use bacon bits instead of ham, I cooked up 8 strips of bacon (1/2 a package), and that seemed just right for us.  Oh, I also didn't let it soak overnight.  I just let it soak while I cooked and crumbled the bacon, and it turned out fine.  Everyone gobbled it up!

i changed most of the recipe I made a sweet  casserol wherein i blended banana, cottage cheese and yogurt as I was out of milk with 1 egg. (infact this made it nice and rich). I used olive oil, cheese(Parmasean-grated) and raisins and nuts and sprinkled a pinh of brown sugar for the taste.  I added crutons and small pieces of ham..amd cooked for 15 mins each ramkin at 435 degrees. Tasted yummy..especially my picky daughter ate it so tells me it must be good.

Good basic recipe. You can change ingredients liberally. Next time I am going to try a southwestern/mex mix. Chorizo, onions and maybe some jalepenos.

Used Texas Toast garlic and cheese croutons and leftover turkey sausages that we had cooked on the grill in lieu of the ham.  I cut the skin off the sausage.  Easy to prepare and tasty.  The mixture was light and fluffy because I increased the milk.  I served it with Tabasco sauce, next time I will add cayenne to the recipe. UPDATE: I used a large, glass baking dish...melted 1 stick of butter, used one bag of garlic croutons (approximately 1.5 cups) which covered the bottom of the pan. I used 8 -10 eggs and 2 cups of milk. I browned one cheap roll of pork sausage. I forgot to put the cheese over the croutons so I put it on top. Delicious! Everyone commented that it was a light, and fluffy casserole with lots of flavor from the croutons. This is my go to overnight breakfast recipe.

Great recipe!  I tinkered with it ever so slightly, as other reviewers suggested...5 eggs instead of 4, less butter and ham, more croutons...and knowing me, probably more cheese!  The resulting casserole was very yummy!  I used seasoned croutons and mild cheddar cheese, but it might be interesting to use different flavors to mix it up a bit.  I think I might even try bacon next time instead of ham!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great Recipe can be adjusted to what you have around.  I made it with leftover steak and did not let it sit overnight, but only for about 20 minutes - and it turned out fab.

I used seasoned croutons, Woebler's Sweet Hot Mustard, sauteed some garlic and onion in the butter before tossing in the croutons.  Topped off with some chopped fresh cilantro and grape tomatoes.  It was delicious!  I'm sure the original is good too but I love my food flavor packed and needed to add the garlic and onion!  I made 1 serving and baked it about 20 minutes.

This was a big hit. Made it the night before and it was a fabulous Christmas morning breakfast. It looked great when putting it together, then in the morning the croutons had absorbed most of the egg mixture. I thought OH NO! but it was perfect. I will make it again. Will make a great light quick dinner also.

Was definitely the dish to make for New Years Day.  Very rich and filling.  I thought it was a bit buttery, will reduce the amount of butter used next time.

I loved, loved this.... it was easy and  quick; I was wondering what to do with some left over ham; I had them calculate the recipe down to 2 servings and used herb & garlic croutons also put some leftover broccoli on the top and baked it in a loaf pan, I let the mixture sit until the oven was heated (not over night) as I wanted it for dinner, I only cooked it 30 minutes as it was a smaller quantity of eggs (2); although I thought it was too greasy next time I'll use less butter.

Me and my family loved this dish!!  I made some changes; I used more croutons-enough to cover the bottom of a 11x7 pan, change the recipe to serve 6 servings.  I added a little bit of chopped green onions and used sliced American cheese (it's all we had).  I will definitely make this again!!!

Really great recipe! Used Morningstar sausage patties instead of ham for a veggie option, and it was dee-lish! Super easy recipe, and perfect for popping in the oven on Christmas morning like we did!

This is not just a simple and easy recipe to make but also a great taste one. My husband, my kids (8 and 6 years) love it, and it was all gone every time I made it. Sometimes, my kids wanted this for their breakfast two days in a row. I only increase the cheese to one cup, and added either frozen spinach or canned mushroom to the recipe. It is easy and quick to make, even my in-law liked it. I've made it so many times that I've memorized the recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe really fooled me (in a good way). It seemed so simple to make that I was not expecting anything out of the ordinary. But it is now one of my favorite go to breakfast casseroles. When I made it, I used garlic cheese croutons.  I had a small boiled potato and a small serving of asparagus left over from dinner the night before so I chopped it in too. It was delicious. The recipe is also great as is. But add a little extra this or that and it is still great. Thank you for this terrific egg casserole recipe. I am always on the look out for a new one to try, and this one definitely made the A List for taste and simplicity.

Simple, quick, delicious and flexible!  Prep time was minimal and actual baking time wasn't extreme.  I made the original recipe and it was really good as is.  The recipe is ideal for adding your favorite vegetables or a different cheese.  A lot of possibilities.

I didn't have any ham and I had 4 hungry teenagers who had spent the night.  So what I did was used left over slices of pizza to make this.  sausage and pepperoni topping from 2 small slices.  And instead of croutons I used the pizza bread without the toppings (1 small slice that I left out overnight to get stale).  The other 2 pieces were stored in the fridge overnight.  Unanimous votes of approval from the kids.  It had a bit of grease on top when I took it from the oven so I poured that off before serving.  Delicious!  Omitted the mustard and did increase to 6 eggs and used 1 cup of milk.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you!

Because the description says the recipe is adaptable, that is exactly what I did! I used biscuits for the bread and doubled the batch to fit in a 9x13 dish. I also used sausage and added some parsley for color. Very tasty!

When I read this it sounded like one I make, only small. I had 5 egg yolks left from making white birthday cake. I used them and 3 whole eggs. Had 2 dinner rolls left so melted just 2 Tablespoon butter in 8 x 10 baking dish & crumbled rolls on top of butter, then followed recipe--except did not wait to bake. Very good! I think if you use croutons it would need to sit overnight in fridge. Thank you!

Very good recipe.  I made it twice this weekend.  The first time with bacon and the second time with sausage.  It is not a WOW flavor but it is a very tasty breakfast casserole and extremely versatile.

My family really liked this. I left out the butter but used butter Pam spray instead and it worked like a charm plus no added fat/calories! I added an additonal egg and used Stove Top stuffing for the croutons. Really easy & good.

My family did not like this.  I substituted the ham for sausage added mushrooms and this made it too greasy.  I think I will try it again but stick to the ham and maybe added green chilis.  The croutons did not appeal to any of us either...maybe hashbrowns instead.

Nobody in my family liked this.  It didn't have a good flavor at all.  I don't know if it was the croutons I used or the mustard powder, but I will not be using this recipe again.

Be careful if you double this. I tripled the amount of croutons and used 7 eggs instead of 8. It would have been better with still more croutons.
I used Zesty Italian croutons which gave it a zippy flavor. Actually a bit too much flavor for one of my guests but everyone else really enjoyed it.

This was great! We wanted something other then the same ol thing for breakfast and this was it! I did not let it set over night, and it still turned out great. I added a little bit of onion green and red pepper. Next time I will not put as much butter, but we loved it! :)

Made this for a family get-together.  Left out the mustard powder but added Garlic Powder, Dried Minced Onion, and Red Pepper Flakes (a dash or two each). Made a double batch and there wasn't any left!

I made this casserole for Christmas morning.  It was fantastic.  I had eight people here and they all loved it.  I made a separate small casserole with egg beaters and less ham for my father-in-law who has to watch his cholesterol and salt intake.  I followed the advice of the first reviewer and added more egg. I also used the butter Pam instead.  It was perfect.  I am going to continue to make this for a quick morning breakfast as it was also great reheated.

I served this Christmas morning and it got rave reviews; just about everyone had seconds. 
I followed the suggestions and reduced the butter to two to three tablespoons, increased the croutons (essentially having one layer of croutons at the bottom of the dish) and cheese by 20%.  Additionally, I sprayed the casserole dish with a cooking spray which kept it from sticking too badly.
I doubled the recipe (8 eggs) and found that an 8x12 pan worked fairly well; a little smaller would also be fine but would probably take longer to bake.
The next time I'll probably add some diced red or green peppers for color, and perhaps some chopped scallions.
I'm very salt sensitive and found the recipe a bit salty given the amount of ham, cheese and croutons, but it was not excessively so.  If you really dislike salty foods, I suggest using low sodium cheese and/or making your own croutons.

Pretty  bland flavor profile.  Really don't know what the croutons were for.  They disappear in the process and we could not taste them.  I made this to use up some left over country ham and if it was not for the ham the casserole would have been tasteless.  Can't understand what all the 5 star ratings are for.

Much better if you leave the croutons out & serve it with toast.  It's also ok to mix it up, pour it into a large frying pan on low, cover it, then turn it carefully when the eggs start to set.  Sort of a cross between an omelet & scrambled eggs.  You don't have to heat up your oven & it's ready much sooner.

I read most of the reviews and made a few changes. I omitted the butter and used Pam spray. I also used chorizo (microwaved for one minute to cut back on the grease, drained on paper towels)and added more cheese. I had garlic cheese crouton, which gave lots of flavor to the dish. I was so easy to throw together. I plan to make this for a brunch baby shower. I hope it holds up in the chaffing dish.

I made this recipe and we loved it.  Only change I made was I left the mustard out, and I used real bacon bits on the top. I used the croutons I had on hand which happened to be Texas Toast garlic & cheddar.  I wondered about the garlic, but it was wonderful.  I am making it again, but in a bigger dish so that there is more leftover.  We had a small left over serving last time that we reheated in the microwave, and it heated very well and tasted wonderful even the 2nd time around.  Will make this often.

Alright, per reviews and because I had small farm fresh eggs, I used 6 small eggs. And because I have a salty palate, added some salt, pepper and cajun seasoning to the original ingredients along with some fresh chopped chives. The result was tasty and fluffy, my only complaint was it seemed to be seeping water. Maybe the skim milk I used or needed another egg? Well, hubs and I enjoyed it anyways and will definately try again to perfect to our tastes.

I doubled the recipe and used a 13 x 9 pan.  The end result was very thin and not fluffy at all, but it did taste good.  Since it was so flat I used it to make breakfast sandwiches on toasted bagels the next day.

I had a breakfast casserole about 7 years ago at a bed and breakfast and I was very much in love with it, but the owner would not part with the recipe.  For years I have been trying to duplicate it and this recipe is the closest I have ever tasted.  Simply wonderful even for dinner.  I doubled everything and added mushrooms and green peppers.  My picky boys devoured it.

My whole family loved this recipe!  I adjusted it for 6 servings and made it in a 11 x 7 dish and it fit perfectly!  I used garlic-cheese flavored croutons which gave it a lot of flavor!  Will make again and soon!

This was fantastic! A great way to use up leftover Easter ham. I used whole-wheat toast instead of croutons, didn't use any mustard, mixed in about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic with the ham before putting the ham in, used a little less cheese, and didn't wait overnight. Between the two of us we ate the whole thing in one sitting. Totally delicious and I will definitely make again!

The best one I've made in years.  Used low-fat pork sausage, non-fat milk, 4 egg beaters and 2 eggs.  It was perfect.  Did not use any butter or oil on the croutons as they were already seasoned.

I give it four stars because it is easy, low calorie (especially as far as traditional breakfast foods/casseroles go), and can be made ahead of time.  As a result of those factors, I make it all the time.  As far as taste goes, I've had better, but it's worth it to me to cut the calories and cook with ease.

Great recipe to use as a basic.  I only had enough dry mustard for 1 pan, but made 2. The 2nd pan, I just threw in several different spices (one of which was Tastefully Simple's Spinach and Herb mis), and that one was better than the plain one. However, my sister who doesn't prefer real flavorful stuff preferred the one where I followed the recipe. I really appreciate having a recipe that is a great basic that I can add to and enjoy many variations of. I added more croutons - maybe used a cup total? And a bit more than a cup of ham. SO tasty! Thanks!

Such an easy dish to put together the night before guests show up and throw in the oven in the morning for brunch. I added Pancetta instead of regular ham. It was great and everyone enjoyed it.

I've made this recipe twice. Both times I strayed a bit—adding my own mix-ins. I would call this a good "base" recipe and recommend knowing the flavors you want to taste.

It's simple and easy. I make it on Sunday for breakfast the whole week.  My favorite part is that I can take last week's leftover produce and throw it in! (This week: spinach, parsley, cherry tomatoes, and a potato)

Thank you!

I first made this for a family gathering.  It was an absolute hit! I have since made it for supper as well as breakfast.  It never fails.  The flavors mix well and the aroma that wafts through the house causes your mouth to water.  I have made this with eggs and EggBeaters.  It works well with both.  Not all egg bakes work well with "fake" eggs.  I highly recommend this one.

I added about three handfuls of fresh spinach to the mix the night before. I put the timer on for 20 minutes, pulled it out, found the ham on top was browning too quick...so I covered the casserole with thin processed swiss cheese slices, as that's what I had on hand, popped it back in for 10, pulled it out when the cheese started browning, covered the casserole with foil, cooked the final 10 minutes. Let it sit for a few minutes, then sliced it up and put it on hamburger buns. Kids loved it. For mine, I added sliced vidalia onion and buffalo wing sauce to spice it up, and gobbled it up! Next time I'll use 6 eggs as everyone else says, and maybe the cheese sliced will go on a bit later in the cook, and the ham underneath the egg mixture. But there will be a next time for sure!!!

I love a recipe that is a base for making it your own.  Instead of croûtons, I toasted some bread like others suggested.  Also, I played with sweet and spicy tastes by adding one piece of french toast (cubed) to the based and topping the egg mix with chopped jalapeños.  Yum!  Thanks!

This was easy. I thought the butter made it a little greasy.....too salty for my taste.

I made the recipe as listed and it turned out wonderful. Easy and delicious. Like another reviewer said, I toasted my own french bread cubes since I did not have croutons.I did add some garlic and onion powder also to give it a little extra zing. I will definitely make this again when we have company.

It was really good.  I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and substituted Turkey Bacon for the Pork Bacon.  I will make this again.

My family loved this! The dish I used was smaller and deeper, so I had to leave it in a bit longer than the recommended 40 minutes. The colour of this dish (thanks to the croutons, I think) is so appetizing! Easy to make. Enough for 3 people if not using it as the whole meal (I served it with tourtière) for a super-yummy Christmas breakfast meal).

This was so good. I threw it together the night before, stuck it in the fridge, baked it the next morning and served to our overnight guests with croissants and fresh fruit. Super easy and it received rave reviews from all parties.

I am a flight attendant and constantly look for things to make so I can have nutritious meals. I have made this many times as is and making additions I have made it Mexican using jalapeños and mexican 3 cheese blend; I have made it with sausage, bacon, ham or no meat. I have added mushrooms, spinach, peppers,even broccoli. I have doubled and tripled the recipe for when I have guest, I freeze it in individual servings and take in my food bag so I have breakfast on the road. It is always good.

I made this for 24, used the servings to determine the ingredients.  I baked it for 1 hr and 20 minutes in a huge casserole pan.  It was a hit!  They came back for more.  It is in our recipe rotation for our group.

This was delish! It transported me to a country inn - it was simple, delightful and I will make it again! I missed the instruction for refrigerating overnight and had no issues baking it right away. So good!

Delicious and easy! I made a few small changes: used butter flavored cooking spray for the pan, used shredded mozzarella instead of cheddar, and made croutons with day old bread. I also added garlic powder and a pinch of white pepper to the egg mixture. My boyfriend, who has been very sick, said this was amazing. Five stars for sure, and I'll be making this again.

The family liked this, only comments being less butter and less ham.  I used shredded Colby Jack, cuz that's what I had, but cheddar or sharp cheddar would be better.

Easy-Doubled it for a 13' by 9" baking dish with 10 eggs (maybe 12 would be better). Added 2 scallions to egg mixture,  a 5 oz bag of croutons and more cheese.  Set in fridge for 2-3 hours then baked

This was the first time I made it. I did make some changes, a lot of changes actually!  I added fried onion, 2 more eggs, 1/4 c more milk, about a T. of Miracle Whip to the egg mixture. I also added some Lawrys and Greek seasoning. You can never have too much cheese in my opinion so of course I added extra cheese along with 2 slices of Pepperjack cheese broken up. I didn't have croutons so I used some left over home style biscuits instead. It turned out great!! Hopefully next time I'll have croutons on hand!

This was average for me.  I think it does need more eggs and some salt and pepper.
