very nice basic marinara.  I didn't have fresh basil so used 1 tsp. of dried.  Also added some fresh chopped parsley and 1 more clove of garlic, as I love garlic flavor.  This had a nice fresh taste.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to use much less EVOO..maybe 1 tbsp. is all that is needed.  I found the extra was just floating around on top but it didn't taste 'greasy' though.  I would also double the recipe.  After I let it cook down to the consistency that I like (on the thicker side) it was enough for 3 people which was fine.  Very nice.  thanks for the quick and easy recipe.  It is amazing how flavorful this was with such few ingredients.  I used a sangria(was all I had) and the extra sweetness I think helped so it was not tart at all.

Great marinara sauce!  I cut down on the oil and added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I like my sauces a little bit thicker.  This went great over angel hair pasta.

Very very good. I served it with spaghetti. The reason I gave it a five is b/c it had so much flavor. I added some garlic powder and I left out the half cup of water. I thought it would make it to runny. Mine turned out great. I froze the leftovers for next time. Great recipe.

I probably commited some horrible chef sin, but it paid off. I used white wine instead of red wine. I had just worked out and had no energy to drive to the store. Nevertheless, the flavor enhancement of the white wine was spectacular, just enough zing to change this from everyday marinara sauce to something special. We really enjoyed it. I only used two tablespoons of olive oil, to reduce the fat a bit and also added a small can of tomato paste (to thicken the sauce) and a pound of ground turkey. My wife and son both thought it was excellent and I will definitely repeat this one over and over again.

Great simple recipe. At the last minute I realised I'd run out of red wine so used white. Only used 2 tbsp of oil. We had this with quick gnocchi from this site. Will use on pasta soon. Thanks.

This was the best marinara sauce I have ever had! I left out the oil and used garlic from a jar. I also let it simmer for about 60 minutes. I served this over Gnocchi I from this site. I will definitely  be making this again.

This tasted like the marinara sauce from Maggianos.  I used dried Italian seasoning blend as I like the flavor.  WIll use fresh basil when I have it in summer.  It is really tasty and I will make it often.  Thanks!!

I added sliced baby portabellos as I was sauteeing the garlic at the beginning of this recipe and I think it was a good addition for a change. Great Recipe!!!

This was excellent.  I used fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned.  It was a little runny but I think that was because of the fresh tomatoes.  Will definitely make again!

I have several sauce recipes that we like but I was looking for a basic marinara. I used fresh ugly ripes, homemade wine and basil from my garden. I halved the sugar because the tomatoes were very sweet and didn't measure the oil but probably used a little less. After sauteing, I added the wine to the garlic and reduced it by about half before combining everything. I then simmered over an hour uncovered because we like a thicker consistency. I make this quite a bit for freezing. Thanks Eleanor!

I have made this twice now.  the first time I made as directed using diced tomatoes that I canned last year from my garden.  It was wonderful.  My husband loved it and he normally doesn't like Italian sauces.  The second time I didn't have any more diced  tomatoes so I used a jar of stewed tomatoes that I canned last year and I had some fresh tomatoes that need to be used out of garden this year.  After letting this simmer until ready I took my stick blender and blended it smooth.  It absolutely to die for.  I am using it to make meatball sandwiches.  I will be using this recipe often.  Thank you so much for sharing this.

So much for the cheap canned red sauce I usually use on pasta for an easy week night meal.  This is just as quick to make and 100 times better!

Did you know, Old school Italians say it's bad luck to cut the basil with a knife, it must be torn as in this sauce.

Yum! This is our new favourite marinara sauce. I think everything tastes better with wine ;) And my kids and husband really love this sauce too. I usually make a double batch and freeze some. I also add tomato paste to thicken it up a bit.

Enjoyed it.  Recipe here is enough sauce for about a half-pound (typical package) of pasta, so be sure to double this recipe for a whole pound of pasta.  The only change I made was adding an extra diced tomato (and therefore less water since tomatoes add water when cooking), because my can of tomatoes was only 14 ounces and really enjoyed the extra tomato chunks, so next time, I'll add a couple of extra tomatoes.

I give this sauce 5 stars! I did add a small can of tomato paste with oregano, basil and parsley. I used a pinot noir wine and I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used dried. We are planning to use this sauce along with an alfredo sauce for a wedding we are catering later this month. Excellent!!

This turned out to be a pretty good sauce. It was a bit runny for me, even though I did leave out the water. I added onions, mushrooms and extra garlic, and it ended up pairing pretty well with my mushroom raviolis.

A very simple yet tasty Marinara sauce, used fresh garden herbs and did add some mushrooms since they needed to be used. Served over linguine noodles with a nice cucumber tomato salad.

It tasted good as made, but I like more spices in the sauce. So I added a teaspoon each of Italian seasoning, oregano, and basil leaves.  Did not have any fresh basil.  Did not use the sugar. Also put one onion in the processor while mincing the garlic. I used a burgandy wine.  Making it again today.  Everyone really loved it. Thank you for a great basic recipe to go on, the wine is what makes the difference.

This sauce is very light & fresh. A new favorite of mine!! It is so simple and quick, I was very surprised at how good it was. I reduced the wine (it was my dad's, I didn't want to use it up, lol!) and used 4tsp of dried basil. I cannot wait to try it with fresh basil!! Deff a keeper!

This sauce was great and so easy, however I did add a little tomato paste to thicken it, a little chopped onion and oregano also.  I don't think I will every buy store sauce again.

This was a great simple sauce!  I didn't have any wine in the house so I substituted beer.  Funny enough... It really worked.  Thanks!

Alright alright alright...I was having my doubts when I was in the middle of making it. Thought maybe it was because I had doubled the recipe and used canned tomatoes (2 28-oz cans). It was looking rather thin so I added another 6 oz of tomato paste. Even at the end, was still doubtful because the color wasn't your typical marinara color. Then I tasted it. Yeah, it's good.

Very tasty and simple. Definitely comes out a bit thin as described; I made a double batch but rather than using 32oz crushed tomatoes, I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and 12oz tomato paste for thickness. I added a little extra garlic and a quarter teaspoon dried oregano to make up for the added tomato, and cut the amount of olive oil in half (it's plenty oily that way), but otherwise used the listed ingredients and quantities. Next time I will probably add more herbs. The flavor is simple but gets a nice dimension from the wine.

I have been looking for a good red sauce recipe. I finally found it. I used holland house red cooking wine and added a bit of tomato paste when I noticed it wasn't thickening up like I am used too. Fresh basil is wonderful!!

This was the first time that I have made marinara sauce. I had to make a few changes, just because I didn't have the exact ingredients. I used tomato sauce instead of tomatoes and I used red wine vinegar and added an extra teaspoon of sugar. My very picky husband raved about it and went back for seconds. We had this over Italian sausage with peppers and onions and wheat penne pasta. I will definitely be making it again !!

I have never made a marinara with red wine, I was sceptical. I tried it and was very impressed, this one is in my recipe box now.

Of course I tweaked it just a little by sautéing up some fine diced  carrot and celery with the garlic. I also seasoned the oil with a fresh cayenne pepper diced.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. 

This one will be in regular rotation.

Not the usual heavily tomato sauced version, and that is great. It simmered and cooked down, but was still not as thick as some sauces, which is what I was after. I use this as my basic sauce for recipes which include a jar of spaghetti sauce, and wow, what a difference!

Loved this sauce!! I have never used red whine or sugar in my sauce so this was a stretch to try something new since I was brought up and taught how to make sauce one way. I loved the flavor of the wine, subtle, not strong....and so easy to make. I soaked my Meatball Nirvana from this site in this and served over whole wheat spaghetti. Will make this again. Thanks!

This was delicious.  As a garlic lover I doubled the garlic...still could of used more, but that's more personal taste.  I also used San Marzano tomatoes....sweet and flavourful.  Will make regularly.

What a wonderful flavor.  I did omit the EVOO and replaced it with roasted garlic in a jar, and I used Splenda instead of white sugar... Great to freeze. Next time I will double the recipe.  Wonderful over sliced microwaved veggies.  Thank you!

Nice, flavorful sauce. I made it with a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and doubled all other ingredients except the water. Even with less water, it was a very thin sauce so next time I'll omit and add some tomato paste. The wine gives it a nice flavor and it's good and garlicky!!! :)

Great recipe, made as written. I really can’t stand how every recipe on this website has thousands of comments and every person decides to list how they changed the recipe and THEN how it turned it. Helloooo if you changed it- then it’s NOT the same recipe and the review is void and null- which means it messes it up for everyone because every review on this website is inaccurate. Jeez. Nonetheless I made this- and every recipe- as listed and it was delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving it a 4 for being a wonderful framework.  I tweaked this a bit to fit my personal preferences.  Upped the garlic to three cloves, added a 1/4 cup of onion and 1/4 cup of romano cheese.    This is the best start I've seen so far!  It's super easy to make and easy to customize to your family's preferences.

I doubled the recipe and found it to be a little thin so I added one can of tomato paste.  I also used dried basil about a 1 tsp, tasted very yummy on cheese ravioli, will definitely save my $$ and not buy marinara again.

I made this recipe tonight for supper to make meatball subs. I used a sweet red wine and loved the taste. The only thing I forgot was to put in the basil. I will definitely use this recipe again and hopefully will remember to add the basil next time.

When I didn’t have enough jarred marinara sauce for my lasagna tonight, I sought a recipe.   I chose this one because a) it called for red wine and b) I had all ingredients on hand other than fresh basil.   It lent a hand to the best lasagna I have ever had in my life, regardless of who made it.   I used an immersion tool to smooth out some of the bigger chunks of my canned tomatoes, otherwise no other changes.  Top notch recipe; thank you for sharing!

This is a really great, basic recipe! I am not much of a cook, but it is so easy that I have not used jarred sauce for years. The only changes that I make are to use less Olive Oil (I eyeball it, but I probably use 1-1.5 tbsp), and I use a little more sugar (almost 1 tbsp). Really yummy over pasta, in lasagna or over roasted veggies.

I have made this “Marinara” without red wine. I’ve made it for many years but called it spaghetti sauce. I dice up onions and garlic and cook til reduced with beef paste mixed with some water and add bay leaf then 2 cans of tomato sauce and one paste. I add my own seasoning mix, sugar, a dash of cinnamon, and a secret ingredient. Guests love it. There’s a slight beef flavor and delicious.

It was very tasty, but I prefer my marinara sweeter and thicker than the straight recipe calls for.   I’ll probably keep this recipe, though, and modify some.  Probably adding a sweeter wine and eliminating the water would suffice, but I might try with the tomato paste as a substitute.

Made without wine or water. Added more garlic. Will add some tomato paste next time, as I like a thicker sauce.

Used less olive oil (1-1/2 T), used fire roasted diced tomatoes, added tomato paste (small can), added oregano, simmered for an hour, then added sliced sweet turkey sausage (par boiled then browned and sliced). It was so tasty. I may never used sauce from a jar again!

I doubled this recipe and made quite a few adjustments. I used a little over 5 TBSP of olive oil, 7 cloves of garlic, added 3 TBSP of parsley, 2.5 TBSP of basil, a small can of tomato paste, 2.5 TSP of sugar, 2.5 TSP of salt, included a 1/2 can of diced tomatoes, added a few dashes of oregano, black pepper, garlic powder and chili powder. I also increased the wine by about 1/4 cup. It turned out great! Going to use the sauce for homemade lasagna.

Ok.  I think the recipe uses way too much olive oil.  I recommend half.  Also it was so thin!  Had to add some tomato paste to thicken it.

Amazing! I had all of the ingredients (besides basil) to make this! Because I didn’t have fresh basil I used dried ones. Also I added a bit of lemon because I like my food with a hint of lemon in it! Also, I put some cilantro leaves in it. Overall this was amazing! Went very well with my rice balls

This was terrible. I'm glad I tasted it first - it was bitter!  I had to add about a teaspoon each of dried basil, marjoram, thyme, and oregano, plus some garlic powder and ground black pepper to make it decent.

This is good start to making a nice and hearty marinara since it uses red wine vs. white. I doubled the recipe to use this for a vegetarian lasagna but the sauce seemed a bit too loose so I thickened it by adding 2 TB of tomato paste and half a sauteed onion with a handful of fresh, chopped sauteed cherry tomatoes and reduced it on med-high heat for an extra 10 minutes and that did the trick. I'll definitely be using this as my go to marinara  Thank you for sharing.

Really easy and delicious! I had about 8 small Campari tomatoes that needed to be used, so I used those in place of the 16 can of tomatoes. I took the seeds out, cut up and processed in my mini-processor. I also added 1 small can of tomato paste and extra jarred garlic, 1 tblsp of olive oil and doubled the sugar. It didn't look like much, so I added a small can of tomato paste. No fresh basil, so I added 1 tsp of dried. Looked and tasted great after 20 min of simmering. I hope to try this sometime with fresh basil; I know if will be a lot better! Keeper recipe! UPDATE 8/31/19: I used a 17.6 oz carton of good quality crushed tomatoes and also added a can of tomato paste. I did have to add 3X the amount of sugar called for to cut the acidity for my tastes. I already had a bottle of rose'-merlot wine opened so I used that. I was happy that I had fresh basil available for this (which is slowly going by the wayside with other summer garden flowers and veggies). This  won't be used for another day or so, and it will be even better then. This restaurant quality sauce!

This is a perfect example of a simple, perfect recipe.  I don't mind slaving over a great meal with lots of ingredients and steps, but this just doesn't need anything more.  Do NOT skip the basil though!  It's the best part.

Real tasty basic sauce, excellent for novice and experienced cooks. I had two cans of diced tomatoes because one wasn't enough. They looked too watery, so 2Tb of tomato paste and a potato masher later, I had something approximating crushed tomatoes. I adjusted proportions to accommodate the extra tomato product, other than that made as directed. I have frozen basil cubes from my garden, so I just chucked one of those babies in the sauce. Very nice, picky husband likes it better than the gross jar sauce he uses when I'm not looking.

I thought this was a very good sauce. The first time I made it with a merlot-cabernet blend, and the second time with a cabernet. It turned out much better with the merlot-cabernet blend. I also agree with the suggestion to add more sugar and to simmer for 1 hour, as the flavor of the wine had not yet blended at the suggested time.

This is fantastic! I also like to make it with Italian turkey sausage added to the filling. Cook it with the mushroom stems and mix in the cream cheese after it cools a wee bit. Soooooo good either way!!!

Loved this!!! I always get super nervous as I don't cook often but this was so easy and delicious!! I definitely impressed my boyfriend. I added some onion to mine as well as some fresh parsley. I also made just a bit more than the recipe (28oz jar) and it was enough for two adults, two lunches and a bit left over after. Perfect!! Will definitely make again :)

Great flavor!  I doubled the recipe,  I didn't add the water, added 6 oz. of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Also added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I let it simmer for about 1-1/2 hour and I think that gave it that flavor.  Will make it again!

I like this sauce on pizza or flatbread (haven't tried it with pasta), but it's too runny to use as is, and I have to reduce first. Also, either my stove is lacking power or there's a typo in the recipe, coz on my stove garlic wouldn't start to brown on low heat even after ten minutes. You might want to cut back the olive oil as it separates from the sauce.

Great recipe! I started with fresh Roma tomatoes that I diced and cooked down for an hour before I added the rest of the ingredients. I also added a can of tomato paste to get a thicker sauce. This will be a staple in my kitchen.

I let it simmer about 20 minutes extra so it's not as runny but other than that it's wonderful.

So easy, quick and cheap!  I used less EVOO, more garlic (because I had a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes) and no water.  It was still thinner than jarred sauce, and I let it simmer for an hour!.  But the flavor was fantastic.  Will use this recipe for sauce all the time!

This was so simple and delicious!  I would advise adding a corn starch slurry as it was rather runny.  I added it along with a can of tomato sauce.  Served over ravioli.   It was perfect.

Made this sauce for eggplant Parmesan and it was amazing. I double the recipe for the sauce and used the extra to top with. So delicious. I will be using this sauce a lot.

I used fresh tomatoes out of my garden.  I blanched them to remove skins and mashed them myself. This sauce has excellent flavor. The wine makes it. Would like to can some for winter using my garden tomatoes.  I did add tomato paste to thicken it.

The wine makes this recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and left out the water.  Since I was using fresh chopped tomatoes (6 large-ish tomatoes made about 4 cups of sauce!), I found there was more than enough liquid, even without the water.  Therefore I simmered the sauce for 45 minutes to reduce it to the desired consistency.  Other modifications:  sauteing the garlic with onions and mushrooms, and adding dried parsley.

This would have easily been a five star if not for the salt. I used about 2/3 of the salt called for and put the sauce over gnocchi. The gnocchi should have mitigated the salt, right? Nope. Way too salty for us. I will make again, but will add salt sparingly and taste as I go.

Was surprised that a recipe this simple could taste so good.  Will absolutely make this again.  I added tomato paste, and cut the oil back to 2 tbs. after reading other reviews.  Our store bought marinara days are over!

I used this sauce when I made my chicken parmesan and everyone loved it. I made bowtie pasta to go with it. I made it again this weekend and everyone loved it. The wine I used was Shutter home white zinfandel this time and the taste of the sauce was even better.

The flavor of wine was strong. I believe a sweet red would be much better in this recipe than the dry red I used. It tasted great as a dip with toasted ciabatta bread. I would have only given the recipe 3 stars but since I didn't have any fresh basil on hand I used dried basil so I bumped it up a star.

This was OK, but a lot heavier than I think of marinara being. I would use as a regular pasta sauce, but it's just too much for dipping or lighter pasta dishes.

This was just the kind of recipe I was looking for. Basic, and one that I could customize as I wanted to. I didn't have any red wine on hand so used some chardonnay and I think it tasted great. I also added some onion, zucchini and baby portobello mushrooms. I simmered for an hour or so so it would thicken. Really good, simple sauce.

I added 1 medium onion and omitted the wine. I also grated in half a carrot for a little sweetness. Next time I'll leave out the sugar.

I doubled the recipe because I could only find 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. I only used 21/2 TBSP of oil, however. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and it came out with a very good taste, given the few ingredients.

Very, very good just the way it is written!  It's my kids' favorite sauce now (I prefer chunky sauces, but this is perfect for a light pasta meal, or dipping mozzarella sticks or rustic bread).  I bought a small basil plant so I have the fresh herb whenever we want this tasty sauce.

Very Good! I've made this twice now and my husband goes nuts for it! I don't know which type of wine I'm supposed to use so I used a Merlot. My only tweaks were to add a little Italian seasoning, dried parsley, and onion powder. I did that because those are some of my staples for all savory dishes. I totally recommend you try this one. Everyone who has tried it loved it.

IDK what happened to mine but it came out really really thin like a soup. It was delicious none the less. I agree with the other posters who used less oil. To me it felt more than tasted oily but it was still very good. Honestly I kind of liked it as a soup if I made it again and turned out the same way (soup) I think i would add chunks of old bread to it so this delicious recipe can now have two purposes bread or pasta.

This marinara sauce reminded me of what you'd find in an italian restaurant! I had a plum tomatoe that was starting to shrivel up, so I chopped it up and threw that in. An easy sauce recipe that's a keeper.

this was delicious! it's so easy to make. i followed the suggestions of others and only used 1 tablespoon on evoo, i also added dried basil in with the other ingrdients so the flavor could simmer for a longer time. at first i thought the taste of the wine was overpowering but after leaving it overnight the flavors really mixed well and it's even tastier! i served it on top of ravioli, it was so good!

This was delicious!  Next time I would also minimize the oil used, because like the other reviewer I had quite a bit floating around on top when all was said and done.  I also reduced it uncovered for an extra 20 minutes after simmering to thicken it.  Thumbs up!

Best Marinara Sauce I've ever had period, and so incredibly easy to make!  I had to make some modifications which might have enhanced or changed the flavor.  I ran out of red wine so I had to use White Merlot (more of a rose wine).  In addition, I am garlic intolerant so I used half of a finely chopped shallot instead.  Served it over a turkey meatball recipe I got from Joy of Cooking and it was just perfect!  I'm never buying bottled sauce again!

Great recipe... the only change was to use only 1 tbsp oil and added 3/4 of 6 oz can of tomato paste I had in the fridge to thicken it.  It was perfect!  Flavor was great, the kids loved it!

Good basic marinara sauce. Very fresh tasting. I doubled this recipe. Instead of adding water, I added tomato sauce. I also added two minced onions and sauteed them in the EVOO with the garlic. I paired this sauce with Lovestohost's Meatball Nirvana, served over whole wheat pasta. Very good!

VERY VERY VERY good and very easy. Whole family enjoyed including my four year old. I did have to use dried basil b/c I had no fresh on hand.... we all loved it though. Thx for GREAT recipe

Not bad, but the wine was a little strong. I used a Cabernet, so maybe something different would taste better. I simmered the sauce with some frozen meatballs to serve over polenta for a quick dinner.

Good, fast, simple recipe.  I added ground beef to make a meat sauce for Spaghetti.  It was OK on the spaghetti (a little thick), but was fantastic for dipping bread.

I made this not too long ago and I absolutely loved it!  I will definitely make it again.
