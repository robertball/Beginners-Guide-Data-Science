My husband ate this, my 5 year old ate this, my  1 1/2 year old ate this and this is one happy mama!  The only thing I changed was that I removed the ham steaks, added 1/2 tbsp of additional butter then cooked the apples w/ syrup. (I was in a hurry and the apples didn't seem to be getting done on top of the ham)  After the apples were nice and carmelized, I returned the ham to the pan. Nice recipe, Thanks Sarah!

Quick & easy to make and IT TASTES GREAT!  I used brown sugar instead of maple syrup because I didn't have any on hand. I kind of made my own by mixing together slightly less than a 1/4 cup of brown sugar with a 1/4 cup of water and several tablespoons of Kero syrup in a large Pyrex measuring cup.  (Who cares about calories) I heated it to a boil in the microwave for about 2.5 minutes.  Watch not to boil over. :o)  I also used Allspice as sugested by another reviewer. Thank you

My husband wasn't excited about this because he always has to have pineapple with ham steak, BUT he loved this and I thought it was really good myself.  Thanks Sarah!

Very yummy! I grilled my ham steak and cooked the apples separately. I used two of each apple otherwise we wouldn't have had enough to go around.
I served this with fresh shredded yams sauteed in a little butter with raisins thrown in and a quick drizzle of maple syrup added. The yams cook up super quick and go great with the flavor of the ham steak. It's 110 degrees here in Phoenix but this meal made it feel like fall! Mmmmmm

This was delicious and very easy.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I peeled the apples and added a squirt of horseradish sauce to the maple syrup to cut the sweetness a tad and add a bit of bite.  My husband loved it and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very quick, very easy and Very Good! I made the glaze with apples separately and let the ham steaks marinate in the sauce for a few hours before reheating and serving. Someone had wondered of a good side dish for this meal... Sweet Potatoes! I'll make this again. Thank you

Great flavor. I really enjoyed this, DH said "he is not a ham person" but if I wanted to make it again he would eat it and he will definitely be eating it again. I sliced 1 gala and 1 granny smith apple and put the slices in a bowl, sprinkled some brown sugar on top and microwaved covered at 50% power for 2 minutes while the ham was browning in the frying pan. Put the apples on top of the ham and sprinkled with the cinnamon and simmered for 5 minutes. Easy and delicious.

This was a great way to make ham and perfect for a cool, fall evening.  I also cooked the ham first, removed it from the pan and then cooked the apples.  I also added chopped pecans.  Everyone, even my picky 2 year-old loved this.  It gets five stars not only because it tastes great but it's so quick and easy too.  I used a full 1/2 cup of maple syrup and didn't find it too sweet.  NOTE:  From what I've read, Grade B maple syrup is actually higher quality than Grade A.  I always buy Grade B now as I find it a little less sweet and syrupy.

I had to make a few slight changes for this to be fantabulous, so I gave the recipe 4 stars as is.  First, because it doesn't say, be sure to use unsalted butter, the ham adds more than plenty of salt to the recipe, no extra is required. I reduced the butter by 1/3 (ie 1 TBS) and sauteed the apples in it, then added the syrup and apples, which I cooked until they were almost done. I added the ham steaks and cooked them until they were heated through, which was enough time to allow the apples to finish cooking to perfection. As others stated, double the apples; they are so delicious on their own or in every bite. Under no circumstances use pancake syrup...yuck.  Use REAL maple syrup; it was more than sweet enough and didn't taste artificial. Next time, I plan on reducing the amount of syrup by 1/4 or more; as it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. I made extra for leftovers so that I could fill buckwheat crepes with the ham and Swiss cheese. I heated until ham was warm and cheese was melted. I warmed the apples and spooned them and juice over the top. It makes for the absolutely most delicious lunch.

This was quite tasty even though I decided for some odd reason to cover the pan while the apples cooked, and it ended up rather watery.  I don't care for ham but was tempted to have seconds.  I'll make it again soon as I'm sure it's even better cooking the apples with the lid off so they can caramelize a bit.  Yum!

OMG! this was amazing!!! We ate it all. And everyone loved it. I used real maple syrup, and 2 gala apples peeled, cored and sliced. I cooked The steak until browner, removed it while I cooked the apples in butter and cinnamon for. Few minutes. Took them out, put steak back and added apples on top. Then poured syrup over it all wig about 1/4 cup of water. Covered and simmered for 18 minutes or so. And!!!!! ADD HORSERADISH! it was amazing with the spicy tang of horseradish and sweet of syrup. Amazing!!!!

You wouldn't guess how great-tasting hot maple syrup tastes with ham if you didn't try it for yourself.  This recipe took about 10 minutes, tops, to make.  If you enjoy Honey Ham, this is 10 times better.  High compliments.

Quick and easy, this looks great on the table on my old oval platter.  My guests always ask for the recipe.  I get the butcher to cut a slice of honey ham 1” plus.  I brown both sides and then put in the rest of the ingredients and simmer until the ham is ready to serve.  The house smells wonderful!  Thank you Lesley.

On a whim, I bought ham steak at the grocery store but had no idea what to do with it.  I decided to give this recipe a shot but was unprepared for the amazing flavor that pancake syrup, cinnamon, and apples would add to the ham.  It's not overly sweet - just a perfect blend of flavors.  YUM!

This was a very nice change from how we usually have our ham steaks. I followed the directions and also added a bit of allspice. I thought it would be sweeter, but it was just right to compliment the ham! This one's a keeper!

This was delicious!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a favorful ham steak and apples that were sweet, but not too sweet.  A great  combination of flavors.  Will definitely make this again!  Next time I will use more apples, everyone was dissappointed that there was not more, and adjust the syrup and cinnamon accordingly.  Thank you for a wonderful, easy, recipe!

This dish was a huge hit at my house.  I was told that for now on I have to make to ham steaks because there just wasn't enough.  I never had that problem until now. :)  So glad I came across this dish.  Will be making again and again.  Thanks for this quick, easy & yummy recipe.

This was delicious.  I didn't have any green apples, so I only used red.  Also, I used real maple syrup.  Next time, I would probably follow other's suggestions and remove the ham, cook the apples in the syrup, then add the ham back in at the end for a minute or two.

Delicious! Very simple to make. The apples and maple syrup combined is very tasty. The presentation of the dish looked appetizing. I will definitely be making this again.

So yummy and simple to make. I sauteed the apples a little longer by themselves so they would get soft. A perfect fall dish.

This was a magnificent way to cook a ham steak.  Found a particularly thick one at the store and had almost 1/2 cup real maple syrup.  Probably used more than a teaspoon of cinnamon, a gala and a granny smith apple.  Yummy and the leftovers were great too.

LOVED! Very flavorful, not too sweet....just right!! I used 2 gala apples, as that's what I had. I admit to cooking the apples beforehand w/the butter, syrup, & cinnamon & adding into the pan w/the ham. Fantastic! Served w/mashed potatoes, green beans, & corn casserole. Thank you!!

Really good. Made some modifications, though. Used 1/4 cup each syrup and brown sugar. Sprinkled cinnaman sugar over apples before adding them to the pan. Overall, great recipe. Can't wait to make again.

Gee, this was really good.  Received this as my daily recipe via email last week.  Made it as recipe said except I used Apple Cinnamon syrup by Mrs Butterworths.  No maple syrup on hand.  We didn't think it was too sweet at all.  Really, really enjoyed it!  Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this twice now, once for my husband's office-mates because they saw (and smelled) the leftovers he took to work the first time. Everyone seems to like it. It has a really nice flavor, not as sweet as I would have thought, and it's super fast. It's not gourmet, but I'll make it every now and then. I used sliced ham instead of hamsteak. I think it would be nice with chopped pecans or walnuts.

Hey there!  This recipe is highly dependent on the type and quality of ham steak you pick.

We used canola oil instead of butter for health reasons, and our ham steak was overly salty.  Also, we only had red apples.

Other than that, it was yummy. =)  Would try again, but with a better ham and more apples.

We thought this was a little sweet.  I made it exactly by the recipe but if I make it again I will definitely cut down on the syrup.

Wonderful recipe! I cooked the apples first in butter, syrup, cinnamon and even a little brown sugar til tender. Set aside. Cooked the ham in a little of the sauce from the apples. Drained the watery ham after the ham was done. Then added the apples and all of the remaining sauce to the hot ham. DIVINE!!! Absolutely divine!!

So simple!!!!  I only used half the butter, as the extra fat wasn't necessary in my non-stick pan. We only had Granny Smith apples in our fridge, but it still turned out amazing.  Tasted great, not too sweet, not too salty.  Quick and easy, with leftovers for lunches!

This was so easy and delicious! The flavours really did work perfectly together. Made exactly as directed for the exception of using pure maple syrup instead of maple-flavoured pancake syrup. This is going into the regular dinner rotation.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  This was a very quick and easy recipe that tasted wonderful.  My husband ate the first bite and said "Wow, I don't think I'll ever be able to eat ham any other way again!"  I made this exactly as the recipe called for and there were no leftovers.  My 5,3,and 1 year old devoured this meal.  Yummy!

My very picky 6 year old asked for seconds! I agree with the other reviewer who said to remove the hamsteak and cook the apples separately.  Otherwise, excellent as written.  I'll be making this again soon!

I made this tonight for supper and it was SO good!  I give it 5 stars because not only is it delicious, it's perfect for weeknight meals because it cooks in no time at all.  I changed the recipe slightly in that I put the butter, ham and apples in together and when the ham was browned on both sides, I removed it.  I sauteed the apples and then added about 1/3 cup of real maple syrup, 1 tsp of cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp of allspice.  Once everything was heated through, I added the ham back to the pan for a few minutes.  The end result was really good; I will make this dish again for sure.

This is one of those recipes that you try because it looks interesting and you think it will taste good. Then you taste it, and it is absolutely DELICIOUS! The combination of flavours is a must try. And it is so easy to prepare!

This was good. I love the apples with the maple syrup. I used real maple syrup. I always put applesauce on my pork and this is so much better!

Very delicious, quick and easy.  I used a few more apples and added a little honey/mustard when eating the ham.  Not too "mustardy" though as to take away from all the other delicious flavors going on.

This was excellent and so easy!  I made it for a Friday night dinner, when we were both exausted from work and school, and just wanted a nice hot meal - my husband and I both really enjoyed it.  I used non-stick butter spray to fry the ham, since I like to be as health conscious as possible. I have a frying pan that acts as a "grill", so I cooked exactly as instructed and then turned to low and put the cover over until the apples were soft.  It was delicious - and, by the way, I used the full 1/2 cup of maple syrup and did not find it too sweet at all.  Thank you!

These are very easy to make. I did not have a pan big enough to fit all 8 of the ham steaks for I put them & the apples in the oven. Turned out great, Wonderful easy fall meal.

So simple of a recipe, it was a big hit with my family. My daughter who normally needs applesauce with ham, ate this so fast, I wasn't sure I gave her any. I used smaller ham steaks instead of one large one. I also used 2 green apples and 1/2 of a red one, and a little more syrup to make a nice glaze/gravy that we put over our cut pieces of ham on our plates. Very moist and a big hit, this is a keeper

I really enjoyed this.  I made this as directed, except that I used a reduced calorie syrup.  Also, I added the apples beside the ham instead of on top so they would cook better.  I would like to try this with pure maple syrup, but it's very good as written.

Very good. Not too sweet, but definitely livens up plain ham steak! I used smoked, fully cooked ham and added it after the apples were soft (used 3 for a little extra) and used pumpkin pie spice. Served with mashed sweet potato.

Amazingly delicious.  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it really wasn't.  I had pre cooked ham streaks.  So to alleviate on some calories/fat I grilled them using my grill pan to heat them.  Then added them to the pan with the cooked apple/syrup mixture.  Cannot wait to make it again.

I didn't use ham steak and it came out okay. I overcooked it and used butter-flavored syrup instead. I would bet with the pumpkin pie spice and maple syrup it would be awesome.

This is a great way to do ham steak. I used real maple syrup rather than maple flavored because that's what I had on hand. The combination of salty ham and sweet apples with maple is delicious. Husband liked it too. Thanks for a great recipe!

Finally, a solution to dry, tasteless ham steaks. This is great. Being from Vermont, I never knew what "maple flavored pancake syrup" was. Try it with real maple syrup, and you will have a real taste sensation. Used it with a plain old ham steak (from Costco, and it was superb !!!

The perfect choice for my Christmas brunch.  Not only was this delicious, it made my whole house smell amazing!  The only addition I made was a few whole cloves.  Merry Christmas!

This is a good basic dish. The husband and three boys enjoyed it. I think it would still be tasty browning the ham in something lighter than butter. I may just try an olive oil cooking spray next time.

Really, really good. I have some picky eaters, and this was a favorite across the board.  The first time I made it, I didn't have maple syrup, so I did what my mom used to do: I used brown sugar and a little water (mom hated maple flavor, having made herself sick as a kid on maple candy, so we always had brown-sugar syrup on pancakes).  It was fabulous, even without the maple.  Next time I made it, I laid out the cash for the maple syrup, and it was worth it.  Raves from all family members.

This was very simple to make tasty.  I added the extra spices as others had reccomneded.  The leftovers were even better because the apples soaked extra flavors.

I thought this was pretty good, and my 18 month old son ate it and seconds. I made it the way the recipe said, except that I added a little bit of brown sugar to the mix. I will definately make this again!

Ok this tasted very very good,everyone gobbled it up! But My ham steak was very thick, which I think left me with a tougher piece of meat at the end...I will be making this again, but throwing it all in the crock pot to simmer and cook all day long, I bet it will taste even better!

Don't worry that the apple pieces won't soften enough - they do. Also, use REAL maple syrup not the fake stuff. It's worth the extra money to only use the real stuff.

This was ok, but not as great as I expected after reading the other reviews. I used the suggestion to cook the apples first, but still just not so special. I'll stick to broiling ham steaks with brown sugar and prepared mustard as I learned from my mom years ago.

Really tasty and easy.  I opted to cook them in the oven at 450 degrees for 10 minutes, since I was making the Sugar Snap Peas from this site with them.  Both turned out excellent.

We never really liked ham much until this recipe.  Since we are cooking for only two, the syrup didn't cover the ham and couldn't really reach the apples to flavor them. The first time we made it, after a few minutes we pulled the ham out and placed the ham on top of the apples. Even then, the apples didn't pick up much flavor. So the second time we heated the ham, then set it in a warm oven.  We cooked the apples directly in the syrup, butter and cinnamon over medium heat with a lid covering them.  When the apples were soft, we put the ham on top of them, covered it and cooked a bit more.  We both were loved the variation. Oh, and we added extra cinnamon because my husband is a cinnamon fanatic.

This was very good.  My children loved the apples.  I'm rating it a four star recipe only because I have another glaze recipe that I use that I like better.  Next time I will combine the two recipes and it will be great.

This was really good.  The only change I made was I used Lite syrup, and then drizzled real maple syrup over everything a few miutes before taking it out of the pan.  Made with scalloped potatoes and salad.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Made this for dinner last night with two changes. I'm diabetic so I used a no sugar maple syrup. It still turned out wonderful. My husband commented on it and decided it would make a wonderful breakfast. I served this with brown rice for my husband (I can't have rice), and a deluxe Cole Slaw using cabbage, carrots and bok choy. The meal was very good. I also used olive oil to brown the ham in instead of butter.

I am a have-to-look-up-cooking-terms new cook (ha!)  I just started cooking about 3 weeks ago.  This was the best meal to date.  My husband and I LOVED it... and the left overs too!  I also cooked the apples separately, adding 1/3 more real maple syrup and some additional butter (as recommended by one of the reviewers).  I actually think I will add more apples next time.  I loved the taste they added.  This was so quick and easy, and it was just the best!!!!

We loved it!  I didn't have a good frying pan with a lid so I steamed the apples in a couple of Tablespoons of orange juice - along with a sweet potato, which added some great flavor  and then simmered that briefly with the ham, syrup and cinnamon combination.  Served it with corn bread muffins and proclaimed it a feast fit for a king!

We tried this recipe tonight.  I made one little change because my husband is diabetic.  I used a maple flavored pancake syrup, but it was a sugar free variety.  We both loved this recipe and will be making this one often.  We had butternut squash and steamed white rice to complete the meal. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

A wonderful dish! Great taste, especially in the apples. I had a little trouble with my steak because it was thiner. Be carefull when simmering, so as not to burn one side. I also added some brown sugar for the heck of it. I will make this recipe again, its very easy!

Sarah,

I made this for supper last night with macaroni and cheese, and it was good. A little bit sweet for our taste, but I will make it again, and maybe use more cinnamon, less syrup, and maybe some ginger to cut the sweetness from the syrup. The ham steak came out so nice and tender, almost like it was marinated for hours. The apples were perfect, and the house smelled good.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good.  I have made it many times.  I agree with other users, cook the apples first.  I cooked them in butter for about 10 minutes (until soft) then add everything else.  I also used a little extra syrup so there was more sauce.  Very good.  You can also use thick sliced deli ham.  Works great.

I probably should have followed the recipe exactly and used the amount of syrup called for, but I was afraid it would be too sweet. So I added less. We really didn't care that much for it.

This was so easy!  I'm recommending it to everyone.  Even my finicky boyfriend loved it.  I don't know what side dish would compliment this well though...

I made this as written served over egg noodles and it was well liked. Great way to use up extra apples and try something different.

I made this exactly as listed the first time and thought it was a bit too sweet.  I made it again using less syrup but adding vegetable broth (could use any broth) and my family loved it!  My changes were 1) halved the recipe 2) peeled the apples 3) tossed apples with 1 Tbsp Maple Syrup 4) removed ham after browning and deglazed pan with broth, then added apple mixture and simmered for a couple minutes, then returned ham to pan and let simmer a few minutes more.   You can adjust the syrup to the sweetness you want.  I appreciate the simplicity of the original recipe, so next time I may just mix the  syrup and broth before pouring over apples & ham.

My supper club girls and I really enjoyed this recipe! I doubled the recipe, but kept the cinnamon at 1 tsp. It was very good and simple to make! Can't get better than that! Thank you for the recipe!

This is such a delicious, fast, and easy recipe! As others have noted, I also cooked the ham first, then pulled it off to cook the apples, and put them back together in the pan for a couple minutes in the end. Also, thank you to all the reviewers who recommended adding some horseradish. I tried this, and my husband, 1 year old, and I all loved it. My biggest problem with a lot of ham recipes is how super sweet the sauces are, but with the addition of the horseradish, this was perfect!

We loved this, but I will say, be careful!  It burns super easily with the butter and sugar content being pretty high - and the apples cook pretty quickly as well. I served this with baked sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli - was a hit!

I made no changes.  I halved everything and made a single serving with a small individual ham steak. 
It's quick and easy.....the basis for a tasty meal paired with a starch and a green veggie or salad.

It had good flavor, I used real maple syrup.  After reading over recipe I realized I didn't use the butter, which truly was an oversight and the apples might have turned out richer if I had.  But really I didn't miss the butter until I reread the recipe after the fact.

Very Good!  An easy satisfying meal. Especially as far as the ingredients and preparation are concerned.
I did not change a thing. Just bought a "thick", (about 5/8") quality ham steak  and golden delicious and gala apples (both peeled) .

Being a diabetic I had to modify the recipe.  I was sugar free spiced apple cider mix and maple syrup, no apples. You do what you can.

I made this the other night and my husband said it was one of the best dishes I’ve ever made.  I used regular maple syrup in place of pancake syrup and those bags of already sliced apples you find in produce (1 bag of red and green).  I left the skin on the apples.  I browned the ham and set it aside while I simmered the apples for 25 min or so, then returned it to the pan.  I will definitely make again!!

I enjoyed making this because it was a nice change, and it did turn out pretty well but I just don't think I'll be making this more than once a year come fall time.  Personal preference I suppose.    I'm just not a huge cinnamon fan.  Thanks for submitting.

Great easy meal! I also did not have maple syrup so followed another reviewer's tip: brown sugar 1/4 cup, water 1/4 cup and 3 tbls corn syrup. Sautéed apples in pan then added fried ham per another suggestion. All else as per the recipe. Served with mac and cheese and sliced beets. It is all gone.

Yum! I reversed the recipe a bit... melted butter with 1tsp oil (to prevent the butter from burning) on med heat. Added brown sugar and let melt/carmelize. Then I added the apple slices. Sauteed about 3 minutes, flipped, coated with a few sprinkles of cinnamon. Then I moved the apples to the side of my big skillet and added the ham steaks. I let them cook and brown in the skillet,  flipped and covered with the apples, then lightly dropped the maple syrup over the steaks and apples. Yummo! I paired this with the Cajun Style Baked Sweet Potato recipe on this site.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing :-)

It is similar to what my mother used to make. We liked the cinnamon in this. My advice: never use the fake pancake syrup for anything. Basically it's chemically enhanced sugar water. Use real maple syrup.

This is awesome!!  I got dinner started a little late and wasn't able to saute the apples as long as I would have liked, so they still had a little crunch to them.  Regardless this was yummy and I will definitely be making it again :)

I usually use ham steak glaze, but this is a great alternative. We love the syrup topping. I sounds strange and sweet, but turns out good with the apples. If u like your ham a little sweeter, try it!

This was just wonderful and perfect for fall! I just sauteed up the apples along with some sliced onions, cut my ham steak into strips and added it to the pan, and then topped it with regular pancake syrup and pumpkin pie spice, and simmered it for a little bit.  Didn't bother browning up the ham steaks cause it tends to dry them out.

This was a good recipe. I used apple fruit/cinnamon fruit cups instead of whole apples. It still tasted good and took less time since the apples were already diced and cooked. Overall, very good. I would make it again.

I did as others mentioned - fried ham steak in butter, removed to a separate dish then made the apples.  I did add the little horseradish to help cut the sweetness and I am glad I did.  We couldn't taste the horseradish but I know it helped make it not so sweet.  I made extra of the apples and will be able to use them over ice cream, pancakes, or whatever.  Thank you!

I made the recipe exactly, and the ham steak was AMAZING. It was very tender and flavorful and I wouldn't change a thing. The apples give the steak a great flavor profile and the tartness of the green apples cut the maple syrup's sweetness. I didn't particularly like the apples themselves, but I'm not a fan of meat & fruit together anyway. The rest of my family loved the apples' flavor, so definitely serve them with the steak!

I was a little disappointed in this.  I expected the apples and syrup to add some sweetness, but the apples didn't pick up much maple flavor and the resulting sauce was actually a little salty.

This was delicious. Absolutely delicious. I used smoked honey ham instead of a regular ham steak and let the apples caramelize in the syrup itself rather than on the ham (since I was only cooking for one, not enough room on the ham). I made a side of spiced roast potatoes and a simple teriyaki stir-fry to go with the dish, and it was easily the best meal I've had in a while. I highly recommend this recipe, as it is really simple and really quick and it won't leave you hungry. Thank you!

I will definitely make this again, but I will cook the apples first next time.  They were just not getting done sitting on top of the ham steaks.  I see now that many of the reviews said to cook them separately.  That's the only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5.

Great recipe! Both my toddlers eat this and asked for seconds. I added sliced carrots and some Allspice to the apple mixture. Plus, I used pure maple syrup. I had precooked ham steaks and just tossed them into my electric skillet once the apples and carrots cooked. I will make this again...you can't get much easier than this for a weeknight meal!

We enjoyed this! I am not a fan of overly sweet dishes, and this had just a hint of sweetness that wasn't overpowering. I cooked ham & apples separately as recommended by others, and then put them together to finish cooking. I used a bit of grated nutmeg but otherwise followed the recipe. Will make again. Thanks!

This is delicious and has become a regular meal.  I sliced the apples very thin as suggested and partially covered to finish cooking.  The only change was that I used 1/4 cup maple syrup rather than 1/2 cup since I tend to not like ham too sweet. 
This goes very well with the 'German Spaetzle Dumplings".

My kids love ham anyways but this recipe is out of this world good! I buy a whole boneless ham and have it sliced and then use those slices, very easy and doesn't take long to cook. Just make sure apples cook long enough. You definitely want them soft rather than crunchy.

This recipe was easy and delicious. My family really enjoyed the apples and maple flavor. It added to the smoky, salty savory flavor of the ham.

This is a very easy recipe to dress up a ham steak.  My wife does not care for ham, even going so far as to say she will not eat any ham unless it is from the honey baked ham company, but she ate her whole portion of this dish!  My 3 year old son was eating it faster than we could cut it up for him.  This recipe will be a regular in our house.  Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this.  We did as others suggested and did the ham first, then the apples, then combined them.  It was so easy.  Great for the season!

This was a welcome dinner on a cool autumn night. It's better if you do not overcook the apples. We used sugar free maple syrup.

We loved it! It is actually similar to what I do already to ham steaks. But the difference is I never thought to add apples. After reading the reviews I decided to cook the ham, then remove them from the skillet and add the apples to cook seperately. Then i returned the ham to the skillet. Perfect! I was afraid the apples would not soften enough. I used granny smith apples. Good recipe! Thanks!

Yummy fall recipe! Added apples in with ham, right in the beginning, After frying the ham, I removed it to a warm plate, added syrup, cinnamon & allspice & simmered till apples were soft, added ham back in, placed apples on top to warm up ham and then transferred to dish & poured sauce on top.  Served with brown rice & 1/2 cornbread muffin heated with butter.

Soooo good! My family loved this. I followed the recipe except used golden delicious apples because it was what we had in the house.  Overall, I found the recipe quite sweet, but that could have been the apples?  I think next time I'll try granny smith for a little tartness.  Served with sweet potatoes, maybe next time I'll try squash for something different!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This is easy to make, looks beautiful and tastes  delicious.  What more could you ask for.  I used real maple syrup and I peeled the apples because no one in my family likes the peel.  I thought this might be really sweet, but it was perfect, I will make this again and again. Thanks for a really good meal.

Great recipe!!! Once I added the apples I put the pan in the oven to cook the apples, because I didn't have a cover for my frying pan and I didn't seem like they would cook very well on top of the ham. Only took about ten minutes for the apples to soften. Wow! So easy and good, definately a keeper.

I guess we were expecting more from this recipe.  We just didn't taste the maple syrup all that much in the ham, and it was browning and simmering in it for quite a while.  We had to go to the refrigerator and get some horseradish mustard to add some "oomph" to the ham.  Not a bad recipe, just average.

Wow.  I love the way the apples picked up just a little bit of salty flavor from the ham.  I used Grade B real maple syrup, as suggested by another poster.  I also used just a touch less than the recipe called for because that's all I had.  It was very subtle--not overpowering at all.

This worked really well, and was extra easy!  When all was done, I turned the stove to low, and it held for a good while (15 min or so) while my hubby decided to come to the table.  I halved the recipe and forgot to add cinnamon at the end, but I will not forget next time, I think it will add a little bit more humm.

Wonderful fall recipe.  I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect.  I served it with a sweet potato casserole and a green salad.

My husband and son LOVED this!  They said it's the best ham I've made.  And it's so easy!  I'd give it more stars if I could.

This was great!  It was ready in no time, and my husband loved it.  Used real maple syrup (a little less than the recipe called for), and the flavor was wonderful.

Very easy and tasty! Steak tends to be a little tough. Perhaps, some additional cooking time is needed to make it more tender.
