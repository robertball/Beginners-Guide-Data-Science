8-4-2016  ~Whoa, talk about a flavor punch of fresh cherries – this is it!  And to coin a tired expression, these muffins are just “bursting with cherries.”  Other than substituting vanilla for the almond extract (I wanted to taste pure fresh cherry flavor) I prepared these as written and would do so again.  These are quick and easy to mix up and get in the pan and a trusty muffin/cookie scoop helps that along.  I’ve found that the size of muffin tins varies, so it’s always a good idea to start baking these a few minutes under what the recipe directs and add more time as necessary.  In my case, I got 10 beautiful, plump and perky muffins that baked in 19 minutes.  These muffins will make you wish cherries were in season all year. (Even tho’ pitting them is kind of a pain in the neck I could do without)

If you use a large cookie scoop, this recipe makes exactly 12 perfectly sized muffins.  Also, the batter is thick enough that the fruit remains suspended in the batter and doesn’t sink to the bottom.  No flouring of the fruit is necessary.  I always sprinkle the sugar on the muffins right after they come out of the oven so the sugar doesn’t melt into the batter.  The end result is a fruity, delicious muffin that everyone will love.

Great recipe! I see some people used vanilla instead of almond extract, but I really prefer the almond and cherry combo. I used a jumbo muffin pan instead of making regular sized muffins. I think this worked better because even after quartering the cherries, the fruit chunks are pretty big. It took about 30 minutes to bake jumbo sized muffins, and they turned out perfect and delicious. This would be a great recipe for hosting a summer brunch!

One of the best muffins I have ever made! I cut the sugar a tiny bit and needed to add a smidge more milk when mixing as the batter was just too thick. Baked for 18 minutes. And RESULT! This one I definitely a keeper!

I used a cup of jarred sour cherries that I'd been trying to figure out what to do with for a year now. These were AMAZING. I used the measurements as is, minus the extra sprinkling of sugar (because I forgot...). Can't wait to make these again. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Listened to the rest of the bakers and increased the milk to 1/2 cup and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup slightly rounded.  Substituted Bread Flour for all purpose flour. Also didn't have a cherry pitter so my cherry pieces were 2 big slices and 1 small slice around the pit.  Also used a round ice cream scoop to fill the muffin tins and it worked perfectly. (Don't level the scoop --just like with ice cream). The muffins baked 19 min and were slightly darker than I thought I wanted when they came out of the oven.  I quickly got them out of the pans so they would not continue to cook.  Oh my gosh --when finished they were a delicious concoction! The outside of the muffin had just the right amount of crunch, the inside was not too sweet but very moist and the taste of the big cherries was decadent.  The big pieces of cherry were perfect!  All I can think of is Tea Party!!  Lovely.  If anything, I would add another 1/4 cup of big cherry pieces.  Also, this was easy to make without turning on the mixer and waking everyone up early in the morning.  Great Recipe.  I am off to buy some more cherries -- I am in love. (-:

Delicious. Used frozen dark, sweet cherries from Costco that I slightly thawed and quartered. Used coconut sugar but regular white sugar would have been awesome as well. Next time I will try to sub some whole wheat flour for some of the AP flour. Added a few more splashes of milk as the batter looked too thick. Did not add extra sugar to top. Awesome recipe. Could use frozen blueberries as well, maybe peaches, raspberries, etc. Yum!

Delicious! I’m so happy that I found this recipe because I’m not a fan of cherry pie. The muffins were perfect. I make more so my husband can take some to work.

These were really good...except I did have to make changes.  The batter was thicker than most cookie doughs.  I had to double the milk.  I used vanilla extract because it was all that I had, but I’d like to try almond next time.  Also, next time I will add at least half of a cup more cherries.  My husband wanted to eat them all.

This is such an easy recipe and the muffins are lovely and full of fruit. I made one batch with almond extract and one with vanilla and both are very good. I had to use slightly more milk than called for because the batter was very stiff. Otherwise the recipe is beautiful as written - I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for future cherry seasons! I'm also curious to see if it would work as well with frozen cherries...

I’ve made this twice now. The results were very, very good both times. I don’t keep fresh cherries around, but I do keep dried cherries*. So I poured 2 cups of boiling water over 5oz of dried cherries and let them sit until they were cool.  The first time I made these, I drained the cherries and used as directed. The batter came out almost like dough and yielded muffins that were extremely dense and a little dry.  The second time I made it, I added 1/4 cup of the cooled cherry water, and it made the muffins lighter and fluffier - more like a cupcake, which I loved. *Dried cherries can be more tart. I like that; if you don’t, try an extra 1/4 cup of sugar.

These muffins are great. I used plain yogurt in place of the milk and added a bit of milk to the yogurt, also used vanilla and added cinnamon. The recipe doubled well. 
Very quick and easy recipe with a yummy result.

This recipe is sooo, sooooo good! We hunted it up when our fruit trees came into season (we had a TON of sweet cherries this year). This became a favorite in our family after that.

I will make it again for sure - super easy and delicious.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and also used almond milk instead of regular milk.  These were light and delicious.  I got 12 muffins out of this.  Also, i forgot to put the sugar on top and didn't miss it!

I was worried about how thick the batter was but they turned out really well. I added a 1/2 cup of toasted pecans and switched the almond extract for vanilla because that's all I had in the cupboard.

It's cherry season and I didn't want my cherries to die before they could be eaten!  I incorporated a couple of the reviewers' changes...I used 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C sugar, 2 C of cherries (all pitted, easy if you have a cherry/olive pitter) all but 12 were halved. I placed a full cherry on the top of each muffin.  I also used an ice cream scooper that made it easy to fill the muffin tins.  I did not use muffin papers but just greased/sprayed the muffin pan.  I have a pretty accurate oven and it only took 15 mins to cook at 400 degrees.

I had my son make exactly as written, except he forgot to sprinkle sugar on top.  I prepared the cherries as written. My charries were on the larger size, so the pieces were a bit big. Everything cooked nicely, but i would have preferred to have more, smaller pieces. The flavor was very good. Exactly what I expected. They are nice and moist. Next time I might cot each cherry half into 3, and do half vanilla and half almond extract.

I really liked these. I upped the milk to half a cup and cut the sugar to a little more than half a cup as others suggested. Also used vanilla instead of almond extract and just put a sprinkle of sugar on the tops. They were light and moist and went very quickly. Great alternative to blueberry muffins.

This recipe was easy and tasted great.  I love almond flavor so I did a whole tsp of the extract instead of 1/2.

I had my 5 year old daughter help make these delicious muffins. We had an excessive amount of cherries from cherry picking and glad we chose this recipe. The almond extract went perfectly with the cherries.

I substituted 1/2 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of almond flour, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and didn’t have regular milk on hand so used buttermilk. The result was some super delicious moist muffins!

I thought these were scrumptious! I used sour cherries from my tree and they tasted great. I topped them with a sprinkle of turibinado cane sugar and saved the recipe to make again.

Great recipe when you have a bunch of cherries utilising baking items that you’d already have in the house. I made a couple of changes for my own taste and because I cannot follow a recipe 100% without putting my own stamp on it. I added some pecans and dried cranberries, cinnamon and pumpkin spice for that extra spicy flavour. I also made this as a loaf because my muffin pans were inexplicably missing. I had to add a little extra milk and a little butter to the batter as it came out a bit too thick for a loaf. It looks and smells wonderful. Can’t wait to dig in with the fam.

Good use for cherries that were on the way out.  Not a common fruit in muffins, but I thought they were very good. Pitting them was a real pain, though. Soon after I started, I put on disposable gloves, and it helped to alleviate the mess and red hands.  The batter was quite thick, so I did have to add more milk. I made these into six jumbo muffins.

I made a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand: 1/3 coconut flour and 1/2 c all purpose, and I used coconut oil instead of canola. As per typical coconut flour, they didn't rise as much as I wanted them to, but they were delicious!!!

The batter was quite thick, so I added a couple tablespoons more of milk to the batter. Other than that this recipe is great! It has a nice crunch on the top of the muffin and great flavor from the cherries. It was incredibly moist. It came out in just 18 minutes instead of the 20 minutes in the recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty! The family loved them! The only thing I changed was I used vanilla extract (didn’t have almond) and used an entire teaspoon. I also had to add more milk to make the batter loose enough to pour.

These were amazing!  I doubled it and they were perfect.  The second batch I used half milk and half sour cream and they were even better.  I'll make these again for sure.

These were very good. I made exactly according to the recipe (though it only made 11 muffins not 12) except I sprinkled sanding sugar on top as 1T on each muffin seemed too sweet given they were sweet cherries. 
One thing is that it's odd to have a sweet fruit in a sweet batter. Next time I will try raspberries, blueberries, or blackberries in them but overall very nice!

I thought they were good but my husband thought they were the best muffins he has ever had. He ate most of the batch. And he is picky/doesn’t like baked goods much. I followed the recipe exactly. Success!

Loved the muffins. Next time I will double the amount of cherries as they just didn’t have enough in them. I used sour cherries because I have a freezer full. And I made mini muffins so my toddlers can handle them, definitely a hit. One batch lasted 5 days in my house, so a double or triple batch will be needed!

Theses were delicious! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and used thawed cherries that I had in freezer. Those were the only change I made. Perfect and easy! Great muffin base. Not too sweet. I will try with blueberries next time. Two thumbs up!!

These  were good muffins. Oddly enough I didn't like the sweet dark cherries as much as I thought I would in this recipe. Bake time was 16 mins.  Made 10 muffins

7.22.16  I did lighten up this recipe by using Egg Beaters®, skim milk, and Splenda® Sugar Blend, all of which worked well in this recipe.  The recipe doesn’t say whether to use sour or sweet cherries, so I used bing cherries (what I had on hand).  We don’t like super-sweet things these days, my cherries were plenty sweet, so I did cut back on the amount of sugar (personal taste preference). The batter was really thick, and I thought about adding more milk, but stuck with the instructions as written.   If I make these again, I will add a bit more milk because it was difficult to fold in and distribute the cherries evenly.  As a result, I ended up too many cherries in some muffins and not enough in others.  I don’t think I overfilled the muffin tin, but I ended up with nine (not 12), and they didn’t overflow the muffin tin hole.  But all in all, this was easy, and we enjoyed them.
