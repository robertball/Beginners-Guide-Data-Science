I took a lot of creative license with this. I did use all of the ingredients as listed (except for omitting the cayenne entirely), but changed the execution of the recipe. Most important, I did not cook the shrimp first!  Shrimp cooks so quickly that I knew not only was this unnecessary, it might even be detrimental.   I poured a mix of melted butter and lemon juice in the bottom of my pan.  I mixed up the bread crumbs with enough olive oil to moisten them, and added the minced garlic, chopped parsley, and some salt and pepper.  Coated the shrimp with this mixture, then baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.   Beautiful and excellent!  I served this with Lemon Butter Herb  Pasta and Garlic Vegetable Sauté, both recipes also from this site.  Five stars with the above-mentioned changes.

Yummy! Made it for my husband's birthday! Comparable to Red Lobsters baked shrimp. I added shredded parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. It was a little too spicy for me but my husband loved it! Will be making this again!

Absolutely loved it!  I made it for my fiancé as a surprise and we both really enjoyed it. A nice Chardonnay compliments this dish very well too (just FYI).

I used the bake only recipe after reading the reviews.
Added 1/2 tea. Red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.
And did not par boil shrimp.  Melted butter , wine and lemon I preheated oven at 400.  Then added raw shrimp and rest of ingredients.  Cooked 6 mins.  Then stirred and cooked another 6 mins.  Was so gooood!
Will keep this one for sure.

OMG... my husband is more of a meat/potatoes kind of guy but he DEVOURED this and couldn't stop telling me how great this was!  Only thing I did differently was using panko bread crumbs instead of Italian, although I'm sure Italian would've been just fine!  Served the shrimp (and scampi sauce) over plain ol' spaghetti, with steamed broccoli and garlic bread on the side.  Fantastic meal!  Can't wait to make it again.  Thank you thank you!

We Loved this scampi. We will be making again. I only used 1/2 tsp of the cayenne. Tasted better than Olive Garden.

loved this as written...can't stand the reviews that changed everything and loved it.   I'll add add garlic salt next time and red pepper flakes.  I served mine over angel hair pasta with lemon, lemon zest , olive oil and parm cheese.  Sopped up any extra garlicy butter with some lightly toasted garlic/parm croutons

My family loved it!  I did use 1/2 cup butter instead of  1 cup. I used slightly less cayenne pepper. I think it would have been fine to you use the amount of cayenne the recipe called for. We do like spicy. I used more garlic. We are a garlic loving family. I will definitely make this again!

This was excellent.  The cayenne is definitely needed for that extra something.  Took a cue from the other reviews that said it was too spicy and only put 1/4 tsp cayenne-perfect amount of zip.  Added parmesan to the breadcrumbs.

This was to die for! I did what another lady did and i looked up that butter lemon herb pasta recipe to go with this and man, this whole thing was delish! My kids ate it standing up, before they sat down at the table. I thought what another lady wrote that now her boyfriend thinks she's a good cook, was so funny and quite true. Make it for someone you love and they will think you are a great cook! Oh yeah, i did cut down on the cayenne pepper as other people said it was too spicey. Also, I did not cook the shrimp beforehand, and just kept the dish in the oven for longer than what it called for. This time I used the exact amount of cayenne, for the kick. Do not skimp on the lemon juice.

This was very easy. I had frozen, pre-cleaned shrimp so no need to pre cook! If you like spicy keep it the way it's written oh there wise less pepper!! I ate it over rice!!! Can't wait to make for a dinner party.

I made this without the lemon juice and cayenne pepper since I didn't have any and used chicken broth instead of wine.  I also added enough bread crumbs to the butter mixture until nicely moistened and tossed the shrimp in the butter mixture so the entire shrimp was coated with the breading.  It was delicious!  I'll be adding this to my list of things to make when I have guests.

Made this with fresh shrimp caught the same day. I'm being completely honest and not exaggerating when I say this is easily top ten of the best things I've ever eaten.

I made this for dinner this evening and like naples34102, I also took creative license with the recipe, because boiling shrimp before baking would have made them taste like rubber.  Baking is sufficient.  I poured melted butter and lemon juice in my round Pyrex pie pan.  I coated the shrimp by dipping both sides and placed them in a pretty arrangement.  Then, I mixed the chopped bread crumbs (multi-grain), minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt and pepper together and drizzled this with olive oil and mixed it once more to coat.  Top the shrimp with the seasoned bread crumbs and baked at 400 degrees for 15-17 minutes. The bread crumbs were delicious and crispy on top and a nice blending with the buttered shrimp.

I loved the technique of melting the butter and flavorings in the oven, and then adding the shrimp and breadcrumbs.

This has way too much butter and cayenne for us, and I even cut the cayenne in half. It was too spicy. Not impressed with this at all and will not make again.

I thought this was the best shrimp scampi I have ever tasted! It was so easy to make and worth every bite. I made it just like the recipe called for without any changes.

I've made scampi dozens of times on the stovetop with butter, wine and garlic, but the cayenne and bread crumbs added taste and texture that made the whole dish pop.  YUM!

Very good, only 4 stars because there was far too much butter. I expected to have a "crispy" bread crumb topping. Good flavor, will make again with less butter.

I loved the flavour and the kick from the cayenne but the cooking method didn't work for me. I skipped step 1 completely, my shrimp were on the smaller side 16-20 count.  To get a little colour on the shrimp I put them under the broiler for a few minutes. I will make this recipe again but I'll have to fiddle with the cooking method.  I made this for surf and turf  night and served it with spaetzle. It's a solid 5 for the flavour! Thanks for sharing.

This was good. Followed the recipe exactly, but wondered why the pre-boil for the shrimp. Next time, I'll omit that. Served this over angel hair pasta.

Fantastic!  Easy to throw together, felt like a dinner out night. Like others, I used thawed frozen shrimp, panko bread crumbs, reduced the butter some and omitted the cayenne because I didn't have any. I used garlic salt and seasonings I had on hand and freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top. Will make this again for certain!

It was OK as is, but it definitely was spicy. I thought it was just barely tolerably spicy, but my husband thought it was fine. Our kids wouldn't touch it because it was too spicy for them. It made a lot of sauce. I tried to spread out the sauce by throwing in a bag of stir fry veggies that I stir fried. I ended up mixing the whole shebang together with a full box of cooked spaghetti. It is easy and tasty, but I think I'll alter the heat level next time.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. What differs it from other scampi recipes is the cayenne and the breadcrumbs. The cayenne was great. The breadcrumbs were the downfall. My shrimp were tight in my pan to keep the breadcrumbs from falling down.  Didn't happen. So, when I went to put it over my pasta, I had this unpleasant mush of breadcrumbs. They also sucked up the wonderful juices.  So, lose the breadcrumbs and you have a delight. Just another scampi recipe .But, the cayenne was what made it  a delight, after working around the breadcrumb mush.

Loved it although I would add a bit more broth next time as my husband and I wanted to drizzle it more over our angel hair pasta. Loved the kick from the cayenne.

I am not a fan of shrimp scampi but my husband is. I decided to make this for dinner. I feel in love with this shrimp. It turned out perfect, was quick and easy.  I will make this again and again.

Mine came out too greasy.  I did have a little less shrimp, but that was it.  I used everything as the recipe says.  I had to pour out all the butter after realizing there was way too much.  I am not a pro in the kitchen, so this was disappointing.  After fixing everything the best I could, it did have a nice flavor at the end.  Next time, I'll know to keep an eye out for the butter.

This was the easiest, most delicious Shrimp Scampi ever!  Lots of butter and garlic, just like we love.  I didn't change a thing and served it over angel hair pasts.  It was as good as a $20 dinner in any restaurant.  I used cooked shrimp so it even took less time to prepare.  And, I took off the tails before cooking.

Substituted frozen cooked shrimp (thawed) and then followed the recipe & cooking time. Quick & easy. Served with herbed angel hair pasta & a side salad. Will make again.

So delicious! I followed the reviews and did not precook the shrimp. Just mixed everything together and baked it. Also didn’t have any cayenne pepper but added paprika and black pepper. I also added basil and some grated Parmesan cheese.

I added salt and half the cayenne due to a 5 year old eating as well. It was great but I may cut the breadcrumbs down a little maybe 1/3 cup but other than that, I will definitely make it again! Thanks!

This recipe inspired me and I made the best shrimp scampi ever because of it. I didn't use the bread crumbs because the scampi looked and smelled so good without it that I just added some pasta and enjoyed it as it was. Delish!

We all liked this.  Although I made a half batch there were still too many shrimp.  Will have the rest by themselves for lunch tomorrow!.  I personally thought there was too much butter and bread crumbs. Next time I will use less and see what happens. Very easy and tasty. Will make again to be sure!  I forgot to mention that I did not cook the shrimp ahead of putting it in the oven.  There is no need to !

I followed the recipe for the sauce and cooking, but I added sliced black olives, red and yellow peppers, sliced mushrooms and halved cherry tomatoes.  I used to get a similar dish at a local seafood restaurant growing up called “Sunset Shrimp”.  This was better!  The flavor was terrific!  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe except there is NO REASON to ever boil shrimp first, then bake it for 15 more mins--it would be rubbery and tough. Cut way down on the butter, added lemon and a bit more wine and it's a winner!  Panko bread crumbs work well too.

I used half a cup of butter, half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, & frozen cooked shrimp (thawed).  Baked at 375 degrees.  Sprinkled with shredded Parmesan cheese when done & served over pasta.  Very good!

I did use 2 pounds of shrimp and doubled the bread crumbs and parsley and kept the same garlic, cayenne, and lemon juice. would make it again. Wasn't as tasty as I imagined and next time I would add more cayenne as you could taste it but wasn't that hot.

I have cut down on the amount of liquids going in it because my shrimp were swimming in it and the bread crumbs would turn out too soggy but soggy or not it is still the best I have ever had.

Husband raved when I made it.  I didn’t have cayenne so I used some Cajun spice and it worked out well.  I also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on it.  I boiled my frozen shrimp so I only baked this for around 10 minutes.  Will make it again for sure.

I made it as written except for pre-cooking the shrimp (totally unnecessary) and leaving out the cayenne pepper, using paprika instead.  I did not care for the recipe for a couple of reasons....one was the amount of lemon taste.....a little too much for me.....and the other was that it should have specified a pan size so that the butter sauce wasn't as deep OR to use less butter in a 9 x 13 pan.  I would have preferred the shrimp to be a little on the crispy side instead of the soggy ones I ended up with.  So, if I make it again, I will use less butter and lemon and make more of a batter to coat the shrimp instead of floating them in the butter.

Really outstanding except for a couple of things. I just sprinkled a little cayenne in the mixture, not as much as indicated on the recipe. Next time I’ll add some salt since it seemed a bit bland and I’ll use half as much butter. It was sort of a soggy mess out of the oven, but I poured and mixed it over the angel hair pasta and it was delicious! Oh, and I didn’t bother to boil the shrimp - I simply ran some hot water over it while it was thawing.  Home run on this one!

This recipe really deserves 5 stars for flavor, but there's no need to follow the first step in the directions to boil the shrimp.  I did use 1/4th less butter & a bit less cayenne  due to personal taste.  My only quibble, other than the possibly detrimental direction to boil the shrimp, was in the rather pale look of the finished dish.  The next time I think I'll try naples' method of mixing in a little olive oil with the bread crumbs.  The next option along with the oiled bread crumbs might be a bit shorter bake time & a brief trip to the "tanning bed" (broiler).    :)

I would give this recipe 5 stars for taste but for the fact of too much butter - I'd cut it back by half next time.  I'd also follow the recommendation of another reviewer to use a dish that just fits the amount of shrimp so that more of the bread crumbs will be on the shrimp, less mush in the pan.  The shrimp does not require precooking. I made sure the shrimp was well covered in the melted butter, wine combo, then sprinkled the crumbs on and baked for 15 mins.  I served it with fresh-made crusty bread.  Mmm mm good.

I mean, it was delicious, but 1. cup of butter? I used 1/2 cup and it combined with the breadcrumbs to make a buttery (but delicious) mush.

It was just "ok" to me. I found the shrimp kind of mushy  cooked this way.  I use a better one than this.  I'm trying to keep the best ones I try out in each category and this one didn't make the cut.  It wasn't bad--it wasn't "great".

The reviews were wonderful from my husband and friends!! A keeper. I did NOT cook the shrimp first, as several people also didn’t, and baked it for 10-12 minutes at 400. I also added some olive oil to the bread crumbs to moisten them. I made it in a 13 inch pan and would make it in a slightly smaller one next time in that the bread crumbs went in the melted butter broth and didn’t stay on the shrimp. We had wild rice and a salad with crusty bread and it was perfect!

Very, very good.  I followed the recipe except for cooking the shrimp prior to baking and it turned out perfect.  My husband loves spicy but me, not so much.  I used the called for amount of cayenne pepper and it wasn’t to much for my taste.  Such a quick and easy recipe, we will make this often.

Very nice easy recipe. Used a pound of salad shrimp and skipped out on the bread crumbs to mix it into angel hair pasta. All else as per recipe, I also skipped pre-boiling the shrimp which is not necessary, they'll cook in the oven. Topped the dish with grated asiago after plating. Beautiful.

This recipe is simple and delicious. The only suggestion is I use more breadcrumbs then called for. I toss the butter mixture with the shrimp and then add the breadcrumbs to the mixture and mix with the shrimp.  I also add a cup of wine (you can never have enough!)  It just has enough kick with the spice.  It is made at least once a week around here :)

Very good! However, as someone on a diet I used half the butter and the breadcrumbs were unnecessary. Also, the shrimp came out a bit overcooked so I'd only boil them for about a minute. Serve it up with some rice and veggies and you've got a delicious husband pleasing dinner!

Delicious.  Scaled down a bit for the two of us, but kept most of the saucy stuff.  I did cut the butter to 1/2 cup, melted all of it and put most into the pan.  The rest I combined with some olive oil and the breadcrumbs, mixed well, and used that to coat the shrimp, as suggested by another reviewer.  I also used about 1/2 cup spinach instead of parsley, and had a few capers to use up and so I added them too!  Cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp, and used cooking sherry since I didn't have white wine.  Placed the breaded shrimp atop the other ingredients in the baking pan, and broiled for the last 4 min.  Will make again. UPDATE 8/5/19: Stuck more closely to the recipe and method. Added broccoli florets after melting the butter in the pan and the addition of the other sauce ingredients. Also halved cherry tomatoes. Baked all this without the shrimp for about 15 minutes, then added the shrimp and bread crumbs which were combined with parm and more garlic. Wow, what a great recipe.

One of my favorite recipes to make!  We don't cut the cayenne at all, it's the perfect amount.  I go a little light on the lemon juice, it gets overpoweringly lemony otherwise.  If you don't have any breadcrumbs on hand I've used crushed triscuits in a pinch!  I also add about a tsp of salt.  Better than any restaurant- if you have fresh parsley it would probably be even tastier.

Its really good every body likes it.   
When I make it I double up on everything becuase I cook two pounds of shrimp..  

I also use cook it differently.   I use half the butter and sometimes omit the cayenne pepper entirely or just use a little black pepper instead.   

To make the mixture I melt the butter in sauce pan, with garlic but not to cook it.   Just get rhe butter melted with it and warm up the garlic a little also put in dry parsley at this stage.      remove from heat, then add half of the bread crumbs, white wine and raw peeled and drained shrimp.     Then throw the whole thing is a 7x11 casserole dish and sprinkle rest of bread crumbs on top.    Cook same as directions and Voilà.   This is the easiest thing to make ever.

I pretty much followed the original directions with a few minor changes. I used half cup of butter and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne. I also used 1/2 regular breadcrumbs and 1/2 Panko with a generous tsp of Italian seasoning mixed in. I didn't par-boil. I placed the shrimp into the melted butter mixture, cooked for 6 mins. Removed, flipped the shrimp over and covered with the breadcrumbs.  I continued to cook for 8 minutes. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce tasted good but the breadcrumbs were soggy and unappealing.  I will do this again but leave off the breadcrumbs unless I plan to broil the 2nd side.

Doubled the ingredients and maybe should have cut back on the butter, cayenne pepper and the garlic. Put it over a bed of angel hair pasta and is now a new recipe I can add to my book!

I used half the butter, chicken broth instead of wine and half the cayenne. Plus broiled a few minutes. Killer recipe! Def use all the butter called for if serving over pasta or noodles.

I used the most helpful positive review to make this dish.  I used less butter and would probably use less lemon next time.  I opted for not using the cayenne pepper,  but would try it next time.  Served with spaghetti noodles and alfredo with vegetables.  Everyone seemed to like this - especially Jake.

This was a very good recipe.  I followed another users suggestion and did not pre-cook the shrimp.  I added it raw to the melted butter mixture.  I omitted cayenne pepper and used seasoned salt in its place.  I then added some olive oil to the bread crumb mixture before putting the crumbs on the shrimp.   Definitely will make this again.

Glad I checked the comments because cayenne would have killed this dish. We didn't cook the shrimp and left out the cayenne. It was amazing over angel hair pasta and homemade Alfredo sauce. One of our new staple meals.

I made it as some suggested without cooking the shrimp before putting it in the oven. I think could do with less butter but overall it was a fantastic easy dish!

I made it with a little different seasoning, based on what was available, but it turned out good. The only issue, though it was a big one, was the bread crumbs. Perhaps my crumb size was too small, or the amount just a suggestion, but the amount specified was WAY too much. I put it on and it just made big clumps that soaked into the sauce. Not blaming the recipe, just something I won't do again next time I make it.

I did not care for this recipe. Too much butter, too much bread crumbs, too spicy and definitely not enough lemon flavor.  Not anything like any shrimp scampi I have ever eaten.

Absolute Perfection!! The only alteration that I made was to add about a Cup of very finely sliced Onion. Shrimp was 'On Sale' and since we don't eat much Seafood -- I thought this would be a refreshing change. Served it over some Angel Hair Pasta and some Garlic Bread Sticks. Heaven on Earth :)

Super easy and so much better than the store bought version.  I did cut back a little on the butter.  I used precooked shrimp and only put them in towards the end (just enough to heat them up).
