I'm not a big meatloaf fan but my whole family loved this as did I. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions with two large cloves of garlic and also made some garlic flavored breadcrumbs. I also make a glaze type topping from another meatloaf recipe which was 2/3 cup ketchup, 4 Tablespoons dijon mustard and 4 Tablespoons brown sugar and poured it on top before baking. It was reall great and complimented the flavor nicely. Will make again for sure.

OUT-OUT-RAGEOUS!  We love meatloaf and I have three or four favorites - this now becomes #1!  The only things I changed was because of what I was in the mood for - ketchup I am sure would have been fine but I substituted the ketchup with jarred beef gravy with mushrooms and poured what was left over the top of the meatloaf (inserted holes with my finger into the top of the meatloaf so the gravy could seep through).  I also added just a dash of Worcestershire sauce and 1 l/2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning.  I was only using a little more than a pound of beef so I cooked my loaf at 425 for 1 hour. (I always use that temp. for meatloaf) and at that temp you can put potatoes in the oven and they are baked through at the same time. Served creamed spinach with it.  Dinner was done in no time and what comfort food!!! Thank you submitter - this meatloaf was soooo moist.

I liked this recipe as a starter but I made lots of changes: sauteed mushrooms and onions before folding them in, used pepper relish instead of ketchup (it gave another layer of flavor, and moisture).  I also used Rachael Ray's recipe for Italian meatloaf glaze.  The overall effect was outstanding. EDITED: I've been making this recipe with 3/4 ground turkey and 1/4 ground pork (as lean as I can get), and it is excellent.

This tasted pretty good. Instead of mixing the mushrooms up thru the whole meatloaf, I patted 1/2 meat into the bottom of the pan-then added a layer of mushrooms, swiss cheese slices, then rest of meatloaf mixture. In last five minutes-I added few more mushrooms on top and few more swiss cheese slices-just until cheese melts. Everybody loved this. Thanks for shaaring.

I LOVE this meatloaf!  I'm not a meatloaf fan normally, but this recipe has become one of our favorites.  One tip: form the meatloaf in a loaf pan and then slam in into a 9x13 baking dish and remove the loaf pan.  The meatloaf will still keep it's loaf shape, but all the fat will go around it and the loaf won't be mushy.

Yum! Espsecially if you use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and add about 4 cloves of garlic.
Leftovers can be made into sandwiches.

This is a really good basic meatloaf. I switched out the bread crumbs for oatmeal (only because that's how I grew up with it being made). I also added a few healthy dashes of worchestershire for some added flavor.

This was the first meatloaf that I have ever made and the whole family loved it! The changes I made(thanks to reviews) were: onion soup mix instead on onion, cream of mushroom instead of ketchup, & garlic salt instead of salt. Next time I think that I will add some Swiss cheese.

The secret of this recipe is the minced mushrooms which keep the meatloaf juicy.  I have been making this recipe for 3 years now.  Originally I put the 6 whole mushrooms inside which was a novelty, but now I just mince all of the mushrooms as a preference and for the ease of slicing the cooked meatloaf.  I add 1 tsp of oregano and replace the ketchup with a tomato-basil pasta sauce.  For the last 5 minutes or so of cooking, I drain the fat away and put a little more of the pasta sauce on top to improve the appearance.  A tasty and dependable recipe for a juicy meatloaf.

This was good.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup.  We do like our other meatloaf recipe a little bit better, but this was good and we needed a change.

I always swore I would never make a meatloaf because my mother made it so often for dinner when I was a kid. But this morning I woke up and decided to surprise my husband with one and thank goodness I chose this meatloaf recipe. We both thought it was fabulous just as the recipe is!

this recipe was good and simple, but it tasted pretty normal. the mushrooms really did not add much flavor. still it was alright. i added garlic but i think it still needed more than i added.

Delicious and very easy to make! I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup; ground turkey instead of ground beef; crushed whole wheat crackers instead of bread crumbs. When I made it another time, I added a lot more mushroom (24 oz) to 1 lb of ground turkey and it turned out even more flavorful!

This was REALLY good! I used turkey, and to tell you the truth I forgot I wasn't eating beef. The mushrooms add so much flavor to the recipe, and it was good till the last crumb. It made for excellent sandwiches as well.

I would give this a 4.5 if it was possible!  The recipe itself was good, but I did change it.  Sauteed chopped mushrooms, onions, celery, and garlic.  Added to meat mixture.  Subbed Dorothy Lynch French dressing for catsup and baked 1 hour at 425 degrees.    Very good!  Will make again!!

I made this gluten free by drying my own GF bread crumbs and I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. It was very tasty, definitely will be making it again.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I was hesitant as it looked too easy!  I made 3 minor changes - I didn't leave any mushrooms un-minced as my son hates mushrooms and I wanted to hide them ;)  and I added 3 leaves of fresh minced basil (mine grows like crazy so I add it to just about everything).  My son loved it so much he had seconds!   Also, I used Adoba seasoning instead of salt.   Next time, I will try sauteing the onions and mushrooms first.

Excellent! My wife (a fine cook in her own right) said that this was the best meatloaf she had ever tried. It will definitely be part of our dinner plans going forward. I actually used "meatloaf mix" from the supermarket and panko bread crumbs. Very moist and flavorful!

Really moist and good! I did what one member suggested, instead of ketchup i used spaghetti sauce. Also, I used canned mushroom. What i did was saute the mushroom with garlic then put it into food processor together with onion. Then mix it with the ground beef and other ingredients. All ingredients blended so well. My roommates loved it!

Yummy! I generally don't like meatloaf (make it for hubby & kids) but I sure do now! Substitutions: 1 C quick rolled oats for the bread, deli mustard instead of Dijon (for the glaze). My only qualm is that it spilled over the sides of the pan, making a mess. Probably because I used 98% lean gr beef. While eating it, my kids requested extra glaze sauce, so you might want to make some extra. I whipped it up & microwaved it for a few seconds. I also sautéed the onions & mushrooms with the garlic like others suggested. Will make again!

This meatloaf turned out wonderful - very flavorful and juicy! I like spicy food so I added some chopped jalepenos and a dash of hot sauce to kick it up a notch!

Delicious! I'm not a huge ketchup fan, so I was glad to have the essence of it, but not overwhelming. Next time I might add a few dashes of Worcestershire or a bit of minced garlic, because I thought it needed just a tad bit something more, but the addition of mushrooms were so good, and the simplicity of the ingredients for the flavor might be just want some people like!

Good! but not great (for me). 
I topped it w/ 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire, 1 Tbsp Ketchup.  This is the topping from "Turkey and Quinoa Meatloaf"

This is a wonderful recipe that never does me wrong. I put a lot more mushrooms then the recipe calls for so I always have to drain water mid-bake but I just really love mushrooms! It always turns out great. I also use ground turkey instead and people tell me they cant even taste the difference. I usually serve it with mushroom gravy on the side.

Not a big fan of meatloaf but this was DELICIOUS!! Even my hubby who stays away from ground beef, loved this dish! I did make a couple changes, as suggested by other reviewers, which are as follows; sauteed pre sliced fresh portabella mushrooms with the 1/2 cup of onions and diced bell peppers in a pan with 2 cloves of garlic before mixing into ground beef mixture. Used garlic herb flavored bread crumbs and baked at 375 degrees for an hour and a half.. Paired this with sauteed green beans/bacon bits and mashed potatoes and we were in heaven!! Definitely will be making this many, many more nights to come!

I absolutely loved this dish! I put it into 4 small loaf pans and each loaf was more than enough for dinner each night for me and my daughter. Loved the whole mushrooms in the middle....it was like a little surprise treat! I will definately make this again.

Very tasty.  I put a topping on the last 20 min. of baking:  1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup bbq sauce & 1T Steak Sauce.  As others suggested I did saute' onion, mushrooms, green pepper (because I had some), and chopped garlic (because this goes in about everything!) before adding to meat mixture.

EXCELLENT! Did not include the whole mushrooms, but everything else was followed exactly as instructed.  Did not use a meatloaf pan - baked on broiler pan which allowed most of the fat to drain.  Covered with foil after one hour and removed from oven 20 minutes earlier than specified.

One of my beat meatloaf! I made it with the recommended glaze and it was fantastic! I shaped it in my glass load pan and smashed it onto a cookie tray, then slathered on half the glaze, and more part way baking.  Next time, i wont put in the whole mushrooms, it made the meatloaf hard to slice.  Thanks for all the helpful advice!

Easy to make, awesome taste. Second time around I added diced green peppers. We make double batches, cook, slice and freeze for easy lunches, and quick dinners. Remians fresh and juicey.

This Meatloaf was terrific.  I used "Meatloaf Mix" (1/3 beef, veal and pork) and 8 oz sliced Baby Bella Mushrooms. Took advice of one reviewer and sauteed 3/4's of the mushrooms with onion and garlic in 1 Tblsp Butter and 1 Tblsp Olive oil before mixing in with meat mixture. Then, I put sliced mushrooms between two layers of the meat mixture before topping it off. Also used 1/4 c.Hickory Smoked (commercial) BBQ Sauce and 1/4 c. ketchup instead of all ketchup.  Finally, used equal parts ketchup, BBQ sauce and Steak sauce to make 1/2 cup sauce to spread of top of loaf.  Flavor was wonderful!

Beware--this recipe takes only about 50 minutes to one hour to cook! If you cook it for as long as it states, you'll have meat-flavored cardboard. That being said, I love the mushrooms in it--makes it juicier and fun too.

This is a very good meatloaf---make it better by adding diced green pepper to taste---for color, try a red or yellow sweet pepper----can also combine all the colors, for better presentation.

It's hard to get excited about meatloaf, but this was outstanding!  Great flavor.  I added a bit more onions & mushrooms than it called for so it didn't bind quite as well as it might have, but the taste was delicious!!! Will definitely make this again!

I dropped the bread crumbs and added one more egg.  Like other reviewers, I used the food processor for the mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions before adding. Had a green pepper on hand, so threw that in, too.  Don't be scared by the amount of mushrooms - it was great. Kids ate it up and never noticed.  Grown-ups noticed and loved it.

Probably the best meatloaf I've ever had.  I didn't make any substitutions to the recipe, but I didn't have exactly 2 pounds of ground beef (1 1/2).  It was SO moist and tasty!

I thought this was great!  I added more mushrooms than called for and also added some carrots and celery to sneak in some more vegetables.  It came out moist and delicious.  I will definately keep this as my regular meatloaf recipe.

Great idea!  I only used about 6 or 8 small sliced mushrooms and it was enough.  The sauteed onions really give it a good taste.  I reduced the meat to 1 lb and 1/2, which turned out to fit just right in my pan.  I spread brown sugar and ketchup on top, because to me, that is what completes a good meatloaf.  Overall good recipe!  Thank you!

This was sooo good.  I left my mushrooms chopped too big and the meatloaf fell apart but still tasted wonderful.  I added cheese to it but will not do that again.  The loaf does not need it.  Will make again!!

My first try @ meatlaof, husband & I both loved it. I must admit I made some additions based on other reviews; I added garlic to the meatloaf mixture & some slice of cheese to the middle; finally I topped the meatloaf with MISSMEGHAN's glaze.  Can't wait to try the leftovers.

I and my family absolutely loved this meatloaf. My daughter loves it because of the surprise she found after smashing into it, my husband loved it because he is a guy, I loved it because it was too easy. I added diced green pepper and instead of ketchup i used tomato juice, i still topped it wit ketchup.

Still the best meatloaf I have ever made hands down. I usually add extras like peppers to get a little more vegies in it.

Really tasty.  I would just change to maybe add 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs to keep it light and to soak up some of the juice as its really, really juicy.  Also note that you need to let this sit for at least 10 minutes so that it can keep its form when you cut into it.

My husband said to give this a 4.5!  It was really very good.  I added a few things...Sauteed onion, green pepper, and chunky chopped mushrooms and 1 packet of onion soup mix (got it from another recipe from this site).  Also for the last 10 min I added a sauce of tomato paste and bbq sauce to the top. :) yummy! I will make it again.

Instead of 1/2 lb fresh mushrooms I used a can( 1/4 lb. approx) of whole ones   ( minced) because it's all i had. Added 3 cloves of minced garlic, dash of cayenne, some msg t.t( it does wonders) and a little more salt and pepper than recipe calls for. Didn't add the whole mushrooms in the middle. Added a layer of ketchup to the top of meatloaf before baking- did not use any in meatloaf mixture. Took just under 1 hr 45 min to bake. Cut beautifully. My mother could'nt get over how well it sliced-she was impressed-she's a meatloaf lover and so is my hubby- he said it's as good as his dad use to make it when he was a a kid. I used some of the "juice" from the meatloaf  with a club house mushroom gravy mix, and it was divine. Love this recipe. Definately a keeper. And i hated meatloaf before this. Way to go! I would recommend this recipe to anyone- meatloaf fan or not!

I thought this recipe was great! Not a ton of ingredients, which my budget appreciates, but still had good flavor.  I may add a few more spices next time, but overall, very good.

This recipe was good... I made some interesting substitutions that you all could try. I used eggbeaters instead of whole eggs. I also have two ideas for the fresh mushrooms... Pennsylvania Dutch canned mushrooms or Cambell's Beefy Mushroom soup in the can, don't add water. Also scallions instead of onion... different flavor. tomato paste instead of katchup, and 2 Tbs. Steak Sauce, and dont forget fresh minced garlic and 1/2 cup Italian style breadcrums. I've tried all of this and it tastes great. Leave a little of the tomato paste to cover the top for the last 15-20 minutes of cook time.  Thanks for listening.

Tastes great but completely falls apart.  I believe she meant to say to cook the onion and mushroom (except the reserved 6) - would try again but with cooked veggies.

This is an outstanding recipe.  I have been playing with it from time to time, substituting different mushrooms to see which one works wonderfully.  I've found that Baby Bellas and Whitecap/Buttons work the best on this, while Maitake gives it a very smoky flavor but does not bind the meat as well.  Your milage may vary on this.

This was *extremely* good.  Everyone raved, and my roommates chose to eat the leftovers for every meal until they were gone -- not to mention made Sad Faces at the empty pan -- and I don't think there's higher praise than that.

I really recommend using a meat thermometer as the recipe author suggests; when I cooked ours, it reached 160 way before an hour and 45 minutes were up.

The boyfriend RAVED.  But then he always does that.  

I am not a meat eater, but the gravy from it was excellent!  I added some onion soup mix in there too.

OK, I *really* revamped this one!  I made it vegetarian by using boca crumbles for the beef.  I also added a bit of garlic, and glazed the top with ketchup in the last 15 min of cook time.  It was very yummy!!

This was very good. I minced the mushrooms (except the 6 whole ones) as well as the onion and half a red pepper in a food processor. I also added garlic. I also put  garlic bbq sauce on top about 20 minutes before it was done baking. It was really tasty and juicy and I will definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe because I love mushrooms and had never thought to add them to a meatloaf.  This was pretty good but thought it could use a little garlic.  The cooking time is far too long, I only cooked it for about an hour.

I have to admit this was the best meatloaf recipe I have made to date, but still seemed lacking in some regard. I minced all of the mushrooms instead of leaving some sliced. My husband liked it because it was moist. It had good flavor on its own but I will experiment with other seasonings next time.

This was okay. Nothing too special, a little bland for my familys tastes. Husband not a fan of the whole mushrooms. Would be good for kids. Easy & quick to make.

I like meatloaf on occasion and I like mushrooms with just about anything... but I didn't care for the two of them together as much as I thought I would.

My boyfriend was very suprised when he seen the layer of mushrooms within the meatloaf. I felt like a gourmet chef! The meatloaf turned out very moist and wonderful! a+ to the creator

This recipe is excellent.  Served it to company and they raved about it.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Turned out great.

Well, I am giving up on Meatloaf recipes. I don't know what it is I do wrong, but no matter what recipe I follow exactly, the meatloaf always sticks solidly to the bottom of the pan, even though I grease it well, AND slide a knife around the edge during the cooking process. It's so frustrating! This was just the same as all the other meatloaf recipes I try - it tastes ok with a good dousing of ketchup or bbq sauce - but it looks bad. *sigh* I just can't get it right. :(

This is a lovely meatloaf recipe. A couple of changes I made based on personal preference were to substitute the ketchup with V8 juice (more flavor, less sugar) and to use 'meatloaf mix' (33% gr. veal, 33% gr. pork, 33% gr. sirloin) instead of the sirloin alone. I find it lends to tender texture and deeper flavor to the meatloaf. Great recipe, thank you!

Loved this one!  Used tomato sauce instead of ketchup, but it was very very good!  Made it for an admitted picky eater, who had never had a meatloaf before.  He's asking me to make it again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It had too much minced onion for us, but it was still very good.  I coated the top with ketchup and made a mushroom and beer gravy to go with it and mashed potatoes. Excellent!

This was ok.  Could barely taste the mushrooms.  That was pretty disappointing.  Not a big fan of meatloaf anyway but was hoping this would be really good.  Sorry, but probably won't make this one again.

Adding mushrooms to meatloaf was something I had never done.  I am however a mushroom lover so went for it.  I minced all the mushrooms and found that you really couldn't taste them but they were a great additive for moisture I think!  I added twice the amount of onion, some A1 and McCormick Steak seasoning (rather than salt and pepper).  I also used some wheat ritz crackers and crushed sage garlic stuffing croutons rather than standard bread crumbs.  I also used a glaze recipe from another meatloaf recipe on this site.  1 cut ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar and worcestershire.  Delicious.  My boyfriend said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had and asked if I was sure to keep my recipe this time (as my meatloaf seems to change every time)  This time I have it all down in my notes and will do the same again and again!

I have made this 3 or 4 times now, and each time it gets better and better. The only thing I added was a bit of garlic salt just for more taste. It always works really well if you throw everything into a mixer.....  gotta Love only washing two things, the mixer and the dish you cook it in!!!

Really good! I used plain breadcrumbs and added some seasoning - basil and a bit of oregano. I also added two cloves of garlic and sauteed them in some butter with the onion and mushrooms before adding them to the meat mixture. I also used a glaze of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar that turned out great. I will definitely be making this again.

We loved this meatloaf. Like others, we sauteed the mushrooms and onions. The whole mushrooms did add a lot of liquid to the meatloaf - so it fell apart quite easily. We're thinking of leaving out the whole mushrooms next time, or perhaps using fewer of them.

Wrapped this perfect creation in bacon and topped it with a sauce (brown sugar, dijon mustard and ketchup). WOW

I’m at a loss. I felt the cooking time what is twice what it needed to be I happened to check it one hour in and it read 192°. It totally lost its loaf shape and was overcooked.??

Made this for my parents.  Took the advise of one of the other commenters and added Swiss cheese as my father is on a big mushroom/Swiss burger kick lately.  My mother loved it!!  My father, who cant find a nice compliment to save his life, complained it was cold, regardless that it was fresh out of the oven.  That means he could find nothing else wrong with it!!!  It smelled fantastic and even my vegetarian brother commented that it looked good.  Cant wait to make it again!

This is an excellent recipe. I added some additional veg to the mix on my second try with sautéed mush and onion. I am not a fan of ground beef, but the people eating dinner each came back for more- which put a smile on my face.

Wow!  This turned out better than I’d hoped!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and subbed mushroom soup for the ketchup.  Added a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  I sautéed the mushrooms onions and garlic and used seasoned bread crumbs.  Very tasty served with mashed redskin potatoes and peas and mushrooms.  This will definitely go on my “comfort food” list!

Ooh, so good, the only 2 things  I changed were, I put garlic, chopped tiny in with the onions and mushrooms, when they are just about done.  Also I put two tablespoons of soy sauce in, instead of salt. It is so moist and delicious! Sometimes I add a cup of whatever cheese I have on hand, and top it with a mixture of ketchup,brown or reg. mustard, and a Tbsp. of brown sugar. Delicious

I made it as per the directions.  I found it a bit bland.  I would add some tpe as of BBQ sauce on top next time.  Like a smokey chipotle type.  My husband liked it, but he likes meatloaf and I rarely make it!

I used this as a launch and added a cheese layer in the middle and a standard Ketchup based topping in the last 15 min. Turned out really well. We enjoyed it.

I used 1 lb lean beef and 1 lb lean pork,  it was a little on the dry side probably because of the leaner meat. I wish that I had added Worcestershire sauce...next time. The au jus makes a good gravy or use it for a meatloaf dip sandwich, especially with all the leftovers (only two of us in my house)

I thought this was delicious. I followed the recipe to a T and my husband raved about it. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cook the mushrooms a little before adding them to the mixture because it gave the meat a mushy texture, but the flavor was great!

loved it...son says it is the best meatloaf ever.  it's so good his friend will buy all the ingredients just so I make it when he is over.  
My only changes are to mince all the mushrooms and use a brown sugar, mustard, ketchup glaze.

Absolutely the best meatloaf recipe I have ever made. This will definitely be my "go-to" recipe from now on. I made only minor changes: I minced all the mushrooms. I also made a glaze combining "Red River Barbeque Sauce" and Dijon mustard. Proportions to taste. I applied the glaze during the last five minutes of baking and turned on the broiler. The glaze provided a nice little kick and another layer of flavor. The only other change I might consider would be using "meatloaf mix" instead of simply beef.My meatloaf hit target temperature in just over an hour.

Mushroom Meatloaf Haiku: "Mushy and quite bland. Way too juicy and crumbly. Mushrooms not so great." So the "layer" of six whole mushrooms in the middle, coupled w/ the overly-moist texture, made cutting this into meatloaf slices a total fail. A pile of ground beef on our plate that looked unappetizing resulted in my husband not even finishing his plate, my daughter reluctantly finishing her's (so that she could "pretty please, pretty please have a kit-kat bar"), and me trying to salvage the leftovers by making a mixey-uppey taco salad the next day; fail there as well. We love mushrooms, we love meatloaf, but this recipe was just a dud for us.

I followed the recipe exactly and we did not like it at all. It was very bland, had no taste in our opinion. My recipe is much better than this one. Will not be making this again. Can't believe all the 5 star reviews. Oh well I guess we all have different tastes.

This is excellent! As many reviewer noted, I sauteed onion, mushroom, and garlic along with some leftover tomato pulp, and that flavor and moisture base was fantastic. Added worcestershire and garlic powder to the mix, and used oat bran instead of bread crumbs. I used a standard pkg of ground meat that was 1.3 lbs, adjusted the volume of other ingredients, and baked 425 for an hour, with a ketchup/mustard glaze. Next time will do a layer of cheese halfway inside the loaf. This is a keeper!

This is the BEST meatloaf I have ever made/tasted. My husband loved it too. It was so moist with a delicious taste. I pureed the onions and garlic before adding and misread the recipe so I only added 2/3 cups of bread crumbs. I minced the mushrooms really small and they added flavor but didn't stand out. My husband said I need to make this at least once a week. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

The mushrooms kept the loaf very moist and juicy throughout.  I made a few changes: 1) sauteed the onion and mushrooms with a little bit of fresh minced garlic before mixing into the meat, 2) doubled the bread crumbs portion, 3) topped with a glaze made with: ketchup, a dash of balsamic vinegar, sugar, and garlic powder.  Turned out delicious and both my husband and I loved it!

Wow! Tried this recipe (slightly revised) last night. It came out moist and delicious and my husband LOVED it! The only tweaks I made were to omit the onion and not put the whole mushrooms in the center. The only down side was that the mushrooms threw off so much liquid it bubbled over toward the end of cooking (good thing I set the pan on a cookie sheet). Next time, I'll cook the mushrooms first. We served it with roasted Brussels sprouts & carrots.

This recipe is simply and tastes great! I made a couple of modifications to it after my first trial run with the recipe: I used portobello mushrooms all thinly sliced and place in the middle of the loaf along with asiago cheese to add additional flavor. This has become one of the family's favorites and guests' requests for dinner!
