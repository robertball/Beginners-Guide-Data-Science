give this recipe 4 of 5 as is...was very tasty and great with ranch. took away 1 star b/c it was a bit salty...try 1/4 tsp. or omit all together. second time added 2 tsp. franks hot sauce to milk mixture and 3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper for more flavor. this makes it 5 of 5...not spicy at all just a little more flavor...just as good as hooters!!!!

These were definitely a hit.  I used zesty pickle spears instead of slices (they retain less oil than an equal weight of slices AND it takes less time to coat and fry them all), added hot sauce to the egg mixture, and added garlic salt rather than plain to the flour.  I also tossed a couple of teaspoons of steak seasoning to the flour.  I made my husband test them before we left for the party, and he approved.  I'm glad I made two jars of pickles, but I wish I had saved one or two for myself!

This is great!!!  We were down south last week and had fried pickles at two different restaraunts.  It was the first time i had them and I was in love.  When we got home, we had to replicate them.  Got on allrecipes.com and found this one.  The only difference is that we used a skillet and added cayanne.  For dipping we used ranch with dill.  The breading sticks to these much better than the kind we had down south. :)

I've been meaning to rate these for over a year...This is one of my husbands favorite snack/side dish when we have some sort of sub-type sandwich or hamburgers.  I usually add a little more pepper to them when they come out of the pan just because that's what he likes.  I've also thrown a handful of panko crumbs into the mix at times for a slightly different texture. Either way these are good.  Serve with ranch dressing.

I had fried pickles at a small diner in Charlotte for the first time.  I never thought anyone could come close.  Wow this is the best recipe for fried pickles ever.  Almost better than the diner.  Loved them!

Added 2t Frank's hot sauce and 2 t cayanne and these turned out AWESOME!  Be sure to eat it with Hidden Valley's homemade buttermilk ranch prepared according to the back of the packet.

I was introduced to these at the Pickle Factory Restaurant Bar at Pepin WI. It is located on Lake Pepin on the Mississippi River and is at a wharf area. Of course they are famous for the Fried Dill Pickles. It is a cool popular place if you every get to Wisconsin. I crave these and this is a great recipe. Not the healthiest so that is the 4 star but sometimes we eat things not too healthy.  I do like some panko crumbs mixed in with this (1/2 c.). It seems lighter and a different batter. They serve it with Ranch Dressing but I am going to play with a little hot sauce in it. Now I can make these at home and not have to drive 500 miles.

I grew up in the South but I had never heard of fried dill pickles! I'm surprised my grandmother didn't know about these... I fixed them just like the recipe said but instead of deep frying, I put then in a cast iron skilled and fried then on all four sides until they were golden brown and crispy. I'll make these again....

Jeez... I hate to be the odd person out here but I really disliked these. I was so excited to try them too! I love pickles and thought these would be awesome. I hated the texture of the pickles after they were fried. They became soggy and slimy and retained none of their great crunch. Sorry, I guess this recipe just wasn't for me.

I just don't think you can go wrong w/ fried pickles.  These were awesome.  I do skip dipping them in the milk and butter as the batter sticks to them w/out it.

I made this recipe for the playoffs and had a bunch of friends over...they all LOVED them! We usually go to Hooter's for our fried pickles and these taste exactly the same! I served mine with spicy ranch dressing for dipping. Fantastic recipe! Thanks so much!

Instead of flour my mom and I used Tempura Batter Mix Extra Crispy.  Pretty good.  Couple suggestions; repeat the coating step atleast 3x, cut the pickles into bite size, also like others said use some hot sauce in the milk mix.

the breading is perfect.  i would add garlic and hot sauce, as others have suggested.  i sprinkle it with parmesan before i serve it.  i skipped the worcestershire.  i add 3T olive oil  to the oil to make it crisp better.  i don't know why it works, it just does.  learned that from making chalupas.

I have made these twice and each time they were a big hit in our home. I followed the recipe exactly and used ranch dressing for dipping sauce. They are very similar to the fried pickles that one of the local bar/grills in our town is known for.

These are GREAT! The drier the pickles, the better since it holds the batter better.

Numnumnumnumnum!!! These were excellent (and I've had a few fried pickles in my lifetime!). The batter stuck nicely to the pickles, which is a problem we've had in the past with other recipes. We used Claussen pickles and sliced them a little (just a smidge) thicker than your normal pre-sliced pickles. I would recommend after dipping in the egg mixture then the flour, wait about 20 minutes or so, then dust with a little more flour. We also tried this batter with some jalapeno slivers (even better than the pickles I think). We'll be making these often, thanks!

Tastes just like what we eat at a Lowcountry restaurant in South Carolina.  I chop pickles into round slices, do not use the Worchestershire and do add 1/4 t. of paprika to the dry mixture.  These are delicious dipped in ranch!

These turned out great! I'm not usually good at frying foods, but these pickles were delicious. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted Dale's marinade sauce. Yum!

These were good as written, but needed a little something. I added a few drops of tabasco sauce to the egg mixture, and some garlic & onion powder to the flour mixture. This was great for breading zucchini as well!

These were really pretty good, but they were super salty.  I  would omit all of the salt.  They're super good dipped in sour cream which cuts some of the salt flavor.

these were good, but not the best I've ever had. The batter needed to be thicker, I think.

I live down south and crave fried pickles being pregnant.  I now don't have to stop at my favorite diner on the way home from work, I just cook up a batch everyday!  This is quick and easy!

Yum. I used buttermilk because it was close to being out of date. and I didn't have any worchestershire sauce, so i used steak seasoning for grilling. Still they were delicious. One thing I do differently is to pat the pickles dry, batter, and then chill in the fridge before frying. seems to keep the batter on better.

These were great! I was so glad to come across this recipe since I lost mine a while back! We had them at our tailgate and everyone loved them! A couple of my inlaws from up north in Wash. state came down for thier first football game had never heard of these before. They were a little leary of them at first, but once they tried them they kept eating them! They both said they need to come to MO more often now and try more things they don't have up there! Thanks so much for replacing my lost recipe! :)

Excellent recipe!  Had fried pickles out at a restaurant and decided to try my hand at it using this recipe.  My family loved them!  The next time we ordered them out at a restaurant no one liked them-they said this recipe was so much better!  Definitely use good pickles, and we dipped in Cajun ranch dressing (8 oz. of favorite ranch dressing with 2-3 tsp Cajun seasoning) Thanks for sharing :)

I added hot sauce (to taste or preference...mine was 1 tsp. I like the flavor without it setting my mouth on fire) and used dill pickle spears...the dill hamburger chips were too salty after cooking them....and left out the salt. This recipe was soooo easy and flavorful....loved it!!! Thank you :-)

Good recipe. We didn't use all the ingredients for time sake but the pickles turned out good just using the egg wash & flour. Dipping in Ranch dressing is great.

I really enjoyed making these pickles. However, after several trials, my family and I decided garlic powder and a little more pepper makes this a much more delectable treat!

Delicious! The hardest part, really, is breading the pickles since it's so time-consuming. I had a teaspoon of Frank's Red Hot to the batter and served with homemade ranch! I can't wait to make them again!

Pretty good. They definitely need a little extra flavor and no added salt. I added Tony's cajun seasoning to the flour. This is a really easy recipe and they turn out nice and crisp!

Very good recipe- we made a batch as is and it was really good.  Then we did a batch with extra seasonings in the wet mixture and the dry mix.  Sooo much better! I used a season salt for the dry and a garlic sauce in the wet mix... couldnt cook them fast enough for everyone! Will definitely use this base recipe again!

Delicious, easy, but MESSY!  We tried the *dipping them twice* process AND only once - we prefer the "single dip" method.  Less coating on the outside and they cook better and look prettier.  Served with honey mustard for dipping.

Made this with pickle spears for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved them. I love how the batter stayed on so well because of the time in the fridge! Much better than the chips I used to fry and always had batter falling off! We will have these again!

I loved this recipe!  I even forgot to put the salt and pepper in the flour and just put it on the hot pickles when they were hot.  I dipped them in buttermilk ranch dressing.  I used the sandwich pickles.  The dip and flour is enough to make more than just a jar of pickles.  I may reduce the amounts next time if I'm just making these for myself.  Though it's great if you're making these for a party.

Loved these.  I used the flat dill sandwich pickles, which makes ALL the difference in the world - they're SUPER easy to fry and turn.  I normally have an issue when I fry pickles with the batter not sticking to them, but I think the 1 T. of flour in the egg mixture did the trick.  I double-dipped them as the recipe called for, but I am big on the fried part, so I will triple-dip next time I make them.  The Worchestire gives them a nice little kick/flavor.  These were awesome!!

Husband loves the fried pickles they serve at our favorite pub, so I thought I'd give these a whirl. I definitely recommend using peanut oil - things turn out so much more crispy and less greasy than using veg oil. Served them with some Ranch dressing. Good stuff!

This recipe tasted almost dead-on to fried pickles I had eaten in a restaurant in Georgia over the summer. The South can come into my Pennsylvania kitchen any time! Hint: Slightly increase ground pepper to a teaspoon or so.

I have tried several different recipes and this is what I've been looking for. It's a nice batter that provide just enough thickness to give the pickle a bit of something extra. The batter, however, is a bit plain. I added garlic salt instead of plain salt which gave it a little more flavor. Thanks for sharing.

amazing! I added the hot sauce and cayenne pepper to the egg mixture, but also added parsley, Cajun seasoning, and onion powder to the flour mixture. Delish!

I'm in the military, stationed in Hawaii, and it can be hard to find some of my family's favorites from back home on the islands.  My pregnant wife started to crave "frickles", as we call them.  Found this recipe and it hit the spot!  I added in some garlic powder and a pinch of chili powder to the flour mixture.  This recipe is highly-customizable!  I'm trying to watch what I eat, but I couldn't help but to have some of these puppies with my light, home-made ranch.

I tried following this, didn't work at all. You need approx 1 cup flour 1 cup milk and the egg so it becomes a batter. Flour the pickles first, then dip them in batter, and add Panko bread crumbs to the dry mixture of flour and seasoning or the coating doesnt stick or fry well at all.

Pretty much had to change this entire recipe.

OMG!! These were just what I woke up craving today. (No I'm not pregnant!;) They were delicious. I added a little Franks Hot Sauce to the milk and egg wash, and some pepper, garlic, and onion powder to the flour coating. I skipped the Worcestershire sauce because I didn't want them to be too salty. I cooked them up in no time, then ate them all. I only made a small amount. I'll be making these again! Thanks for the share.

I am always in the kitchen, and I love trying new recipes or finding the "southern foods" my husband loves. We're newly married, and I am so glad to say that my first attempt at this was a success! I surprised my husband with these, and he has me make them every chance we get. = ]

The BEST thing I've ever made from this site, these were AWESOME!!!! I DID add a little hot sauce to the mix like another person suggested but to be honest I think they woulda tasted just fine without it.. Will absolutely be making again- think perfect football season appetizer! :)

I made REDLASS46's refrigerator pickles back in the early fall to use up cucumbers from the garden, so I used those for this recipe.  Delicious!  I added garlic salt and lots of black pepper after reading other reviews, and double dipped/battered each pickle before frying.  I served them with ranch dressing.  They were a huge hit at our super bowl party; thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe.  Made it for the first time yesterday.  Used baby kosher dills so the pickles were bite-sized.  Added a 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce to the egg mixture and served with a homemade buttermilk ranch dressing for dipping.  Would definitely make again.  Easy to prepare and do, great as an unexpected appetizer.  Let the dill pickles sit out for about an hour after sliced to help dry out a little.

Thanks for a great recipe. The only thing I changed was to use whole kosher dill pickles which I sliced. My boyfriend and I thought this recipe was as good if not better than the ones you would get in a resturant. Yummy!!!!

Delicious and easy! Just the right amount of crispy and pickle-y. Sometimes the restaurants add too much breading and you lose the taste of the pickle; this recipe hit the spot... Especially when served with Chuy's Creamy Jalapeno dip!

The batter is WAY too thin and the recipe calls for too much flour/dry ingredients.  I added an extra egg and flour to the batter and took out more than 1/2 of flour and added plain bread crumbs to the dry ingreds, plus  a lot of spices.  My first batch (from AllRecipes) was so bland and tasteless...I working on my 2nd batch as I type this.  Good luck!

Wow!  I'd never had fried pickles before but came across this recipe and just had to try them.  Note that the recipe does call for double-dipping: Milk-flour-milk-flour.  This gives them a nice coating of light batter.  Wonderful in ranch dressing.  Had them a few times now and get 'cravings' regularly.

I actually LOVE fried pickles.   When I became pregnant with my 3rd child it's what I craved.  I made these as followed and was not a HUGE fan.  They were good but next time I'll have to make sure the oil isn't too hot and I may opt to use breadcrumbs instead, maybe with some spicy seasoning.

Tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, the only change I made was to the method.  I dipped in the egg mixture, then the flour, then back into the egg and then back into the flour and into the fryer.  This makes a thick, crispy coating.  Mix up some mayo (Hellmans) and fresh garlic and dip away!

Easy to make.  The taste is just okay unless you have a great dipping sauce (I used the sauce from the blooming onion).  DH thinks it'd be much better on a burger or in a sandwich.  Fun to try and the kids loved them.

Quick Easy and Fun!.... would be much better with a spice element such as cayenne pepper. Batter stuck on great... maybe a little too much, next time I will try just one dip in mixture and flour.  Overall great

This recipe is legit.  Excellent.  Only change I made was added a few sprinkles of chili powder to the flour mixture and omitted the salt.  A definite hit.

These turned out really well! I had to use gluten free flour for health reasons. I didn’t use a whole 32 oz jar of pickles, but made the coating as listed. I only used a small amount of oil to cook them in. The kids loved them!

Love this recipe. I did add parmesan and some garlic to the flour mixture but it was great. I also used whole pickles instead, just preference. Works either way.. will be saving this recipe

I made this but had to substitute milk with water + butter, and Worcestershire sauce with soy sauce. I don't know if this was due to my substitutions, but it turned out a little bit more salty than anything else. Otherwise, the pickles were very good!

These came out perfect. I even did some single battered and they came out great too. I did cut the salt in half otherwise they would have been overly salty.

I added another egg as I didn't feel the 1 egg was enough to provide enough of a sticky layer for the flour.   I seasoned the heck out of the flour with garlic pepper, spicy paprika and salt.   I liked the Worcestershire in the egg mixture which is why I originally went with this one.   If you are using a NuWave or other element to heat, set the heat at 375 for a good 350 oil temp.  Also, I used whole pickles and sliced them very thin the 2nd time around which worked much better.

Great base recipe but you definitely need to season up your milk mixture and the flour. I added Tony's, cayenne, and garlic powder to the flour mixture and hot sauce to the milk mixture. Mixed Frank's Buffalo sauce with ranch for dipping.  might I add with all the spice I added, it was not spicy.

Gave me something to do with my almost full jar of pickles, at least. Came out great. I didn't use salt though because usually I find pickles too salty so with it deep fried it's just right. I am confused about the significance of the 1 tbsp of flour in the mix. Mine just settled on the bottom of the bowl. And the milk really watered the egg down. Tastes delicious though!

very tasty!  I omitted  the salt since it is salty enough as is.  batter stuck on pretty well, I think I will also add some hot sauce  next time and try to sub some of the flour for cornmeal to add some texture.

Great recipe! Followed exactly. Be sure oil is not too hot. We dipped in ranch, but would suggest a horseradish based sauce instead.

These were excellent! My family loved them and they were so easy to cook in our little new deep fryer. Good directions to follow too! Tastes delicious with ranch on the side. I highly would recommend these to anyone.

I love pickles. I have only tried fried pickles once at a restaurant. They were very good. I made these but added onion powder, garlic powder and some Cayenne pepper but sadly they weren't that good. the first couple I ate were good but then they slowly got worse... maybe its because I'm pregnant and I think everything tastes weird but idk. They were ok. Could have been better.

Made these exactly as the recipe said, used Vlasic pickles and sliced them myself.  I never really understood the fuss about fried pickles until I tried these! So good!! Crunchy and the batter stuck just fine. I will def make these again!

We made these tonight with a few adjustments and loved them.  We are out of worcestershire sauce but added hot sauce to the milk mixture.  I also added a little garlic and paprika to the flour mix. I made a blooming onion dip to serve with these...excellent!!!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made off this site... It was delicious and my boyfriend really loved it. The salt and pepper in the flour mix make a big difference, and I mixed hot sauce and ranch dressing for a dipping sauce which was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!!

I love the fried pickles at BW3 and these were even better!  I used Claussen Sandwich Slices and cut them in half.  On the last batch I dipped them back in the egg then flour a 2nd time.  This was the best batch of all!!!!!!

I didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce instead.  Also, I added a little cayenne pepper and garlic salt to the flour.  I fried them longer than what the recipe said because if you take them out when they float to the top they aren't brown.  I left them until they turned golden brown.  These are delicious!

I doubled coated these, although the process of making these turned out fine, the taste wasn't great...was my first time trying 'fried pickles'..I think I'll stick to eating it out of the jar.

This was sooooooo good! I'd never heard of fried pickles before but thought I'd give it a try. An instant hit in my house!

Excellent! Totally satisfied my pregnancy cravings for fried pickles. As far as I'm concerned, no need to hunt down restaurants which serve 'em up right! They are crisp and nicely seasoned.
