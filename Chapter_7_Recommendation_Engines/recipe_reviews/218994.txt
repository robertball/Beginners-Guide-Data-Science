Love this type of sauce traditionally served with veitnamese eggs rolls. Your recipe rocked. I did add 1/4 tsp Thai chili paste, but it didn’t raise the heat factor. Missed the part about 24 hour melding, but was still great only after making it 2-3 hours in advance. It’s a KEEPER!!!

Made this the day before, for Christmas.  My wife made Lumpia Rolls, a Filipino type egg roll, served on most special occasions.  The only thing I did different was used a lime instead of lemon.  Came out awesome, the whole family and a close Filipina friend of ours, couldn't get enough. We where dipping Lumpia rolls all day..hahahahha  
Thanks for a great recipe and Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year..

This is a good, solid 4 star recipe as written  but your intro elevates it to 5 stars.  I may even take my own sauce to our local restaurants.  Their Nuoc Cham hasn't been satisfying lately.

This is as good as it's going to get, I added soy sauce along with the fish sauce and lemon, added a little extra punch.

Perfect dip to go with Vietnamese beef skewers! I used rice vinegar instead of the white vinegar, so it was a little less sour. Still, it was yummy!

This is excellent! I had a whole bunch of cooked spaghetti squash and needed a bright dressing to make a salad. I followed the recipe faithfully except substituted 1/4 cup Splenda for the sugar (for a low carb option). I took a taste before refrigerating and already know its a winner.

Thank you so much for this great recipe.  It is the perfect place to start for making great sauce to one's own taste.  I like it with a bit less sugar, and no peppers.  Then I add just a little soy sauce right before I eat, because my husband likes his without!  Some of the other recipes on this site for Vietnamese Dipping Sauce just didn't work at all, but this one was great and easy to adjust to taste.

This is really good! My family prefers this sauce to be sweet and sour, rather than spicy, so I left out the chiles and green onion just cause we don't like green onion. But some minced red onion made for a nice floating "topping" on the sauce. It was yummy just hours after being made, but will let it sit and see how it mellows out :)
