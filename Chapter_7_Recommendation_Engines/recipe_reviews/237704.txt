I made this for my trainer as she wanted something quick and good for her busy days. I made it as is and she, and her friends, liked them a a lot. She then asked if I could make it a cookie so it felt more like a treat. I made them with applesauce, added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a bit more vanilla, and used a small scoop to portion the cookies. I baked them at 350 about 12-13 minutes. They turned out great! Just enough cookie-like consistency, although a bit softer. I also let the batter stand about 5 minutes then stirred it before scooping. I plan on using pumpkin next time! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this recipe with semi-sweetened chocolate chips, walnuts instead of almonds (all we had on hand at the time), and chocolate veggie based protein (what we had) and it was fantastic! Our coconut was also sweetened. The recipe was not too sweet and not too bitter. I recommend the chocolate chips for sure though of you have a sweet tooth.

Moist and delicious. I did not have a sweet and spicy black tea on hand so I used chai tea instead which worked fine. For variety I will make it again using pumpkin or applesauce instead of mashed banana.

A FANTASTIC  recipe!   I make 2 pans of these every few weeks and my husband takes them to work. We freeze them after they are cut and they thaw by lunch! )  I love that there is no sugar.  I double the cinnamon and add  pinch of cloves, and cardamom,  little bit of nutmeg and a 1/4 tsp. of ginger.  I brew a lot of tea, I always end up needing more.  I found I can substitute 2 - 4 ounce containers of baby food bananas for the fresh, with no change of taste.  I made one of each last time, and they got mixed up in the freezer and he did not notice at all! I sometimes switch between almond butter and peanut butter,  or do a mix of both, depending on what's in the house. I tried MANY recipes to give him protein with lunch and this and a pumpkin one are the only ones he requests!  I

A great recipe with no added fat or processed sugar!  Although this probably earned a 4 star with me, the basic ingredients are great.  Needs SALT and a tad more sweetness that could be achieved with a touch of Monk Fruit or Stevia.   I did the pumpkin version as not enough bananas were on hand.  This pumpkin version should have measurements for recommended additional spices.   Flavors of baked bars meld better after being refrigerated.  So satisfying for a quick breakfast on the go.

Daughter loved them.  HOWEVER, the nutrition information seems quite suspect.  It says that there are 25 servings, each with over 10 grams of protein.  Did a rough calculation and didn't come close to those numbers.  Whoever came up with that information needs to recheck their numbers.

I was very pleased with how these came out.  I made it with the bananas and nuts (no chocolate chips.)  I have only unflavored whey protein powder, so I did add extra vanilla.  I found the sweetness OK, but the rest of my family would prefer it a little sweeter, so I will probably add some next time (I don't know if the vanilla flavored protein powder has any sweetener in it.)  This seems like a very customizable recipe.  I look forward to trying it with pumpkin.  I also think the banana version would be great with some cocoa powder added.

These are easy and delicious. I don't think they need the coconut on the top as it just basically falls off anyway, even though I patted it down prior to baking.

Great recipe!  I made a couple of changes. I added about 1/2 cup of chopped Israeli dates to add sweetness and they sure did! I also used Super Butter Seed Butter instead of peanut butter (so they can be used for school lunches) and also added 2 tbsp of ground flax seed  They are the chewy, delicious factory-made- granola-bar substitute we have been looking for!

I've made this recipe several times, and my husband and I both love it. It tastes good with chocolate whey powder rather than vanilla and tastes good even if you don't have coconut. This is our favorite healthy bar snack.

I made these almost exactly like the recipe except I substituted 1T of the chia seeds for 1T flax seeds.  They were fresh tasting and filling with almost no sweetness to them which is a nice change. My kids dislike them since they're not sweet, which means more for me!

Flavors all blend together.  I did not use the coconut.  I also used chocolate chips instead of craisins.  My son thought they were not sweet enough so next time I make them I will use what one review suggested  of 1 teaspoon of brown sugar.    My son suggested putting butterscotch or white chocolate chips in next time..  You can definitely play around with this recipe which makes it nice.   I also baked only 20 minutes and the bars were not hard.

My favorite new recipe. These are moist and delicious, and not too sweet. I make a batch on Sunday to have for lunch/snacks for the work week.

I skipped the protein powder and chia seeds, but used 1/2 C. each of sunflower seeds, gold raisins, black raisins, walnuts and coconut.

These bars were awesome. I made them and had breakfast ready all week long. I made them without the coconut, protein powder or the craisins and they were great. It's the kind of bar you could throw anything into. The tea seemed to make the bars nice and flavorful.

I had steel cut oats so I cooked those first and then added them. I also did a combination of almonds and cashews and I had a mix of dried cranberries and blueberries. Turned out fantastic!

This recipe deserves a review! SO good! Great balance of sweetness, is moist but holds its shape. Very satisfying at any time of day. Followed the recipe exactly except didn't put coconut on top
