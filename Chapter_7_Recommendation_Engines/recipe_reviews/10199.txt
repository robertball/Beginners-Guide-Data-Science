This recipe is fast fast fast.  We made graham cracker houses and it was thick like glue. I actually assembled the houses with sugar melted in a small omlete pan.  It works like hot glue if you would like to try it.  Just put the sugar in a small flat pan.  Heat on med-high until melted then turn down to warm.  dip the grahams into the sugar and they stick and dry within seconds.  This royal icing recipe works great for sticking the candy or decorations on.

Fantastic.  I used 1 egg white, 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 1/4 tsp cream of tartar and the results were most excellent on sugar cookies. The cream of tartar is essential for a smooth icing .  For all of you looking for the perfect royal icing, you've now found it!

I add 2 cups of confectioner sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice to make icing for my cupcakes and it was perfect. It is dry outside and soft inside which is a hit with kids.

Perfect!  I doubled the recipe for our gingerbread house, and it could not have worked better.  It set up well, and is VERY strong.  I remember when I was a kid having such a hard time getting the house to stand up, or the roof to stay on, etc.  No problems with this one!  In fact, our house has a steep A-frame roof, and we covered the entire roof with overlapping Necco wafer shingles.  They are HEAVY, and we put them on with the roof already in place.  This icing held it all on with zero slippage.  I was very impressed.

It tastes awful, but we primarily just make our gingerbread house for decorative purposes, so this is not an issue for us.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! This works GREAT! I used this to ice gingerbread cookies. This will surely be my go-to recipe for decorative icing from now on. It dries very nice (dries hard so it doesn't get all messed up when you stack cookies on top of each other). And it was SO easy!!!!!

I was not looking forward to making this and have been putting it off! Needed the recipe for icing for Sugar Cube House Contest in my family. Thought I would get a head start so I would not get overwhelmed with it. EASY to make, thought it would be much harder. Just made it and put it in a zip lock baggie and cut the end off and used it to glue my "bricks" together! Started the outline and was very pleased with the results! Thank you for such a great recipe that makes it easy for us baking/cooking newbies!

I pastuerized the eggs first by placing them in 140 *F water for 3 1/2 minutes.  I added the cream of tarter to the egg whites and beat them together, then beat in the sugar and 1/4 tsp vanilla.  If your icing is runny and a smaller yield it is because you haven't beaten it long enough.  I beat it for 7 minutes.   I used this for icing cookies, so I  thinned it with water-- a way to tell if it is the proper consistency is when it is the mark left from a knife dragged through it disappears within 5-10 seconds.  It pipes well, even just using a baggie with a hole in the corner.  I will definitely make it again.

I forgot to beat the eggs and just mixed them together.
I whipped it extra long then it was just fine.
We made candy train with it and it turned out perfect!
I didn't have any problem with the icing at all.

My husband was concerned it uses the raw eggs though.

As written, the recipe did not work for me. After 35 seconds of beating the egg whites into the icing sugar/cream of tartar mixture, the whole thing hardened to the point of actually breaking the hand mixer. Once I overcame the horror of this catastrophe, I deftly switched to a wooden spoon and my trusty bicep-tricep tag team to finish the job. I needed to add the juice of one fresh lemon to add enough moisture to be able to reach a decent consistency. Not a great recipe, but thanks for the new muscle training regimen.

Worked great! I added 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/8 tsp almond extract for subtle flavoring - tasted great.  2 batches covered and decorated 30 large cookies with a little left over.

This frosting is perfect to decorate sugar cookies! The trick is to beat the heck out of those egg whites! I had to dump out my first batch since it was too runny from not beating the eggs long enough.

Great Recipe for a perfect Royal Icing!!! It dried nice and hard--I made a crown out of the icing... make a pattern- Tape it onto a coffee can, tape wax paper on top of that, then trace the pattern on the wax paper with this royal icing, let dry--repeat 2 more times, then let dry overnight. Carefully remove the waxpaper from can and peel off of the icing VOILA!!! Will be a great topper on a cake!!! Thanks a lot Veronica!!

Great icing, great taste.  Just remember to beat the eggs first, you'll probably be beating them for 5 minutes.  Then beat the sugar into the eggs a little at a time.

We just made and decorated 8 gingerbread houses using this icing. I made two triple batches, and it turned out perfect both times.  I let the icing harden overnight before we added decorations to the houses the next day (using this same recipe to glue them on). This is definitely the best recipe for when you need icing "glue".

Goes very well with gingerbread cookies... made half a batch (32 servings) and that was enough for a full batch of cookies... but we didn't cover the whole cookie.  Also, we didn't sift the sugar (sifter was still wet from cleaning after use for our cookies).  Great recipe!

Add a little lemon juice and you will have a wonderful frosting. Be prepared to frost quickly as this frosting sets right away.

I am sooo happy with how this icing turned out...it was perfect!  The gingerbread house was VERY easy to put together, much easier than past years.  No slipping and the icing dried super fast.  I thought I would have to make a different icing for the kids to use on the cookies they were going to decorate and eat because another reviewer said this icing tasted bad, but I changed my mind after a taste test...it tastes great too!  I will be using this icing year after year.  Oh and I tripled the recipe, 6 eggs, 3/4 tsp cream of tarter and 9 cups of sugar.  It was plenty for the house and all the cookies.

Used this to ice sugar cookies.  A bright white color.  Has a thick consistency, which was nice because it stayed put and didn't run off the sides but stayed spreadable for a long time, long enough to ice several dozen cookies without rushing.  Very fast recipe!

I'll use this recipe again and again! Used it to make pacifiers out of lifesavers & dots. A little candy for a baby shower. I did use a tad of pure lemon extract to add a bit of a different taste to the assembled candy. Also when using the egg whites, I made sure to use them at room temp.

My second attempt on this recipe was far more successful than the first one... I've learned my lessons. I piped roses of pink royal icing directly on chocolate cupcakes, which made a nice contrasting colors. Love it this time!

This recipe works great. I don't have much experience decorating cookies, but this worked perfectly. My only thing is that it sounds like it would make a lot, but it goes really fast, so I would suggest making a double-batch. We used this for gingerbread houses and it works great. Amazingly, the kids actually thought it tastes great!

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and was pleased with the result. The icing was relatively easy to apply with a small icing tip, and it became easier as the icing bag warmed up in my hands. It's got a mild papery taste, so it's better used as glue or as a piping decoration on stronger flavored cookies like gingerbread, rather than used like cake frosting.

I'm happy with this recipe. It was stiff and setting up before I finished decorating my cookies making it hard to pipe. I warmed it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it was better to work with than when I first made it.

Made as instructed, except that I halved it because it was just my daughter making one small house.  I used powdered sugar, if that makes a difference.  I added several drops of thick food coloring GEL, and it did not affect the consistency whatsoever.  This held up very well, and dried in about an hour, so that she could start decorating.  Great recipe, thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out as perfect as promised!  It was just what I needed for our Christmas cookies.  It dried within an hour of frosting them, and held on to all our sprinkles and stars!  I added a little vanilla extract and lemon extract- very sweet!

The Best !!! This was first time making royal icing and this recipe is the bomb. I had the ingredients on hand so that it a huge plus! It set up well  and was easy to work with. I am so glad I tried it! I made two batches and the 2nd came out as well as the first. It is an idiot proof recipe .:)  Thank you!

I was looking more for an icing to decorate the gingerbread houses with and this one was too thick for that.  I thinned it out by adding another egg white but also a little more powdered sugar because just adding an egg white makes it's too runny.  I played around with the ratio and found one that works for me but this was a good guide.  If you are looking for the actual glue for the gingerbread houses, I think the way this is written would work great.

I have no experience with icing, but I can HIGHLY recommend this recipe now. It is soooo easy to make, and can easily make more on the spot when I ran out. I chose this recipe because it didn't use carn syrup, and didn't require heating on the stove.

12-2011.  This royal icing recipe has been the best I've tried over the years.  Each Christmas, the kids decorate a gingerbread house, but the tricky part has been making the walls stick to each other. This icing is really thick and gooey, and the walls went up easily!

Easy and tasty. I think I'll mix it by hand next time though. I may have broken my electric mixer this time. It gets pretty stiff pretty quick. Great recipe though.

Awesome recipe!  Worked Fantastic!  I just added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract just for some flavor as I was using this for sugar cookies, and it worked great.  I tinted the icing too and had no problems.  I even doubles it and had no issues it still came out great.  I wanted the consisentcy slightly thinner for 1 batch and just added a little bit, like 1 tsp of water and it was perfecto!  Thanks for sharing!

Having worked in Gingerbread construction for many years I would say this is the standard 'Royal icing' recipe. To cement walls and roof tiles you want a firm icing.   To create 'snow drifts' you'll want something softer.  Think about where you're going to use the icing before you add all the sugar.    It will be a little thick for piping with a small tip if you add all the sugar.

I used this on gingerbread men. I divided and made seperate colors and some just with the white outlining. I added vanilla as one reviewer suggested. I mixed the cream of tartar and egg white together than slowing added confectioner sugar to my desired consistancy. I will use this recipe again.

Great icing, I used for piping as the recipe goes but then dilluted with water to flood the cookie. Dried smooth, hard and sweet, I added vanilla for extra flavor and this did nothing to the color or texture. It was a good frosting for adding color to as it is easy to blend, be sure to let dry Completely before stacking or icing over with another color! Great for my needs! Would get 5 stars however the recipe as it stands I think needs a flavoring like vanilla, orange or something for added taste.

I think with a few tweaks this recipe can be very versatile.  For gingerbread house icing, add another egg and another 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and mix for 7-8 minutes(non-stop).  Time based on use of a Kitchenaid stand mixer wisk attachment speed 4 then 6 when all incorporated.  Frosting is ready when firm peaks form and is back to White color.  This will make very workable frosting that is quite hard when dry.  If you want more firm, add another tbsp or 2 of confectioners sugar.  For the issue of smell and flavor, add 1/2tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Adjust to taste, but my family loves it.  For cookie frosting, spread thin.  this will be thick, butmakes very stackable cookies that hold decorations well..  For an easier to use cookie icing, use my same recommended ingredients above, but only beat 4-5 minutes as instructed above. Cookie icing will be a bit thinner and spread more evenly.  If too thick, add 1/2 tsp water at a time to desired consistency. be careful to not use too much water. This colors well for lots of variety.

I made the Children's Gingerbread House recipe from this site, then used this recipe for icing since I had cream of tartar (magic stuff) and I know it really helps the icing harden. I made it just as listed but did this one change: mixed it until it got combined and a bit stiff, then since it didn't seem strong enough, added about 1/2 cup extra powdered sugar with a sifter a little at a time until it got pretty hard to mix. You can tell when it's done cause your shoulder hurts a bit, but should be nowhere near "beater-breaking". :)
This recipe made enough to ice a small gingerbread house (using Wilton house cutters) with all the trimmings (men, trees, etc.). (If you had a large house I would bump up to 95 servings or so for 3 egg whites and more sugar.) It held like a dream! I probably didn't even need to prop up the roof (though I did out of habit and I recommend this practice). I do use toothpicks to prop up the other stuff. Hint: put icing under the toothpicks. Basically, just put icing on the "ground" wherever you need it, then just use a sifter or sieve to scatter powdered sugar snow over everything to hide it.

This recipe was too runny as is, I had to add a lot more sugar just to get it to a semi-usuable consistency.  This recipe may be okay for a cookie or children's gingerbread house, but definitely not good for a cake or for a baked item where you need royal icing for more intricate designs and decorations (the icing is not a good enough consistency to dry properly for that).  It is a simple recipe, just be sure you know what type of project/icing consistency you will need this for... for me it wasn't a faster route, it actually set me back time wise.

I just got done making this Icing.. It was easy and quick... Not sure if it is the egg whites or the confectioners sugar, that gives off that taste... kids don't like it at all. Very unhappy with this.. going to use the method for Italian cookie icing instead!

We just finished making graham cracker "gingerbread-style" houses with the kids.  This recipe worked great.  I mixed the cream of tartar and powdered sugar in a bowl first and then added the lightly mixed egg whites.  After mixing the ingredients with a spoon (so I wouldn't have powdered sugar all over my kitchen), I mixed with an electric hand mixer for about 5-7 minutes.  I definitely didn't end up with four cups worth, but the consistency was good without any additions.  We didn't have any vanilla extract, so I omitted it.  I made one batch as directed and then mixed another 1/3 batch.  We had enough for all three houses, one of which was a four-story condo. :)  I will definitely use this recipe again next year.

It was great on dark chocolate cupcakes and I added a couple of drops of vanilla to mine. This is exactly what I needed. It made the journey in the car to Mom's house better than a softer frosting would have.

Great Royal Icing recipe, but the proportions are off - I would say this only makes 2 cups of icing (also, not sure where the 64 servings came from).

made this to use with gingerbread cookies.  Icing set way to fast & was pretty difficult to work with.  The cookies weren't great either (McCormick).  Unusual for Allrecipes.com anyway, useing less sugar may make the icing a little more easier to work with.

This is a decent icing. I was a little worried at first because it seemed very runny, but it harden really well. We colored it and used it to ice cookies. Everything was okay until we actually ate the cookies. The icing tasted like wet powdered sugar in a non-desirable way. I'm sorry to say that we will not be using this recipe again

Awesome recipe.  I do have a few tips on decorating. I found this most helpful in making  a snowflake design on a sugar cookie. Take a mixture of warm water and confectioners sugar to make a clear glaze. Take a small paintbrush and coat the cookie, giving it a shiny appearance. After you pipe the design on the cookie, again use the warm mixture with the paintbrush to smooth out the lines. Then add the edible glitter. They are simply gorgeous.

This was VERY easy to make!  To be able to pipe it on cookies, I had to use 3 beaten egg whites instead of 2 to get a looser consistency.

Perfect! Just made a gingerbread house from scratch and used this recipe exactly (made no changes). It came out nice and thick, but still manageable.   We propped up the house with can goods to help it set, but started decorating immediately. After about 10 minutes we didn't need the cans anymore. It even tasted good! This will be my permanent royal icing recipe.

This was perfect for making gingerbread houses!  It was easy to make and held everything in place.  I added color to some of it and it still turned out great.  It tasted fine, but next time I will probably use the suggestion of other reviewers and add a little bit of vanilla.  I think that would make it taste amazing.

This is an excellent, easy Royal Icing recipe.  It mixes up within 5 minutes and hardens quickly.  A downside to royal icing is that it typically does not taste very good.  That isn't the 'fault' of this recipe but a trait of royal icing.

I personally hate the taste of this - it's just what I would imagine super sweet gluey icing to taste like. However, it holds amazingly well and dries super quick. I would never eat this frosting, but I *might* decorate with it.

This sets up great.  Suggestions:  Add the cream of tartar to the egg whites instead of adding it to the sugar.  Cream of Tartar is used to help "stabilize" or stiffen the egg whites.  Note: I modified the recipe a tad by using 1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar (1/4 tsp. in conf. sugar and 1/4 tsp in egg whites).  Use a quart size zip lock bag to pipe onto the cookies, and try adding 1 tsp. of vanilla extract  to bring up the flavor a little bit.

worked perfectly for me--had plenty to do a house, maybe even two houses!  I scooped it right into a quart-size zipper bag & snipped a corner to apply the icing.

An easy enough recipe that my 9 year old daughter and her friend were able to make on their own.  The icing worked like cement on their gingerbread house. It held the sides and the roof beautifully - even with all the candies on it. It is a great recipe to work with.

This recipe worked fantastic for decorating gingerbread houses. The consistency was perfect for a frosting bag, after carefully measuring each ingredient. I'm sure it would also work fabulous for a gingerbread house - as it was a nice thick frosting. Thanks for sharing!

The directions are vague but I was able to figure it out. I loved the way my cookies turned out with the frosting. I added water when the consistency was too thick.

Great recipe! I sifted the powdered sugar directly into the bowl along with the cream of tartar. I used all egg whites from the box and beat them before SLOWLY adding them to the mixture. I wasn't sure about how much to add of the whites, so I started out modest (1/4 c.) and added a little more when the mixture seemed a little dry. I also added some lemon to help flavor the icing. Tastes great and it dried quickly for my gingerbread house. It was my first gingerbread house and we let the set house stand overnight. My daughter and I are going to decorate it today and I can't wait! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe! I look forward to using it again in the coming years to make more gingerbread houses! :)

This is a great simple icing.  I used it for decorator cut out cookies.  I kept it thick to do my outlining and thinned the rest with milk so i could "flood" the colors within the outline.

This icing was perfect...at first. I used it to make my gingerbread house this year because I wanted an icing that would hold up to my heavy decorations. In the beginning this icing was perfect, my gingerbread house came out beautiful and all of my decorations adhered to the gingerbread. However, after a couple of days, decorations began cracking off and breaking because the icing broke off like glass. After a couple more days, walls began cracking off and the whole thing came apart. Needless to say, it was sad and disappointing to see hours worth of hard work become destroyed due to a poor icing recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, beat the egg whites for five solid minutes in my Kitchen Aid, but this still did not work. I warn others about this frosting because it seems perfect, but will leave you disappointed and will leave your effort and hard work destroyed. I wish I knew this before I spent over six hours working on my gingerbread house.

This is a great recipe.  It was quick and easy to make.  I used it to decorate gingerbread people.  I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and almond extract.  It did make a lot of icing.

Having almost no experience with icings and flooding I tried this recipe on sugar cookies (AllRecipes Best Rolled Sugar Cookies).  I found the icing easy to work with, tasted great, and looked great on the cookies.

This is an excellent recipe!  I am pretty new at decorating cookies, so if I can do this, I am pretty sure anyone can!  I followed another review, and used one cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar, and one egg white.  I wanted the smaller batches, as I wanted to do a couple of different colors.  I know I could have made one large batch and divided and colored it, but I was doing the cookies in stages, and actually found it to be easier to make separate smaller batches as I was ready for it.  The first batch I made, I thought it seemed a little runny, so I added a smidge more powdered sugar.  Although it worked out, do NOT do that!  It is so much easier to work with when it is a tad thinner- it spreads and sets beautifully!  Thanks for sharing a terrific recipe- I am going to be using it a lot :)

I made this for some gingerbread men at Christmastime & it worked well...I do think I needed a bit more powder sugar to make it the consistency I wanted but it was still great...just keep mixing until it's the right thickness for you

Well I was going to give this 5 stars but hubby didn't like the taste. I used this for rolled out sugar cookies. I still gave this four stars because I liked the way it worked with the sugar cookies. My hubby suggested adding vanilla to add more flavor but that could turn a white icing a brown?!? And my kids loved the taste of the icing without alterations. So we will try the vanilla next time and see how it goes.

This is a great icing. We ended up with too much though because I went with the reviews that it doesn't make much. I whipped mine for quite awhile because I was distracted and got more than 4 cups. Our gingerbread house turned out perfect though. I didn't even have to wait for the walls and roof to dry before we were able to decorate it.

Great recipe for gingerbread men!!! Only thing is that it's really thick, which makes it very tough to pipe through a bag.  But I toughed it out cause it was exactly the texture I was looking for.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!! :)

I took the suggestion to add the 1/4 tsp lemon juice but you will still need to use 3 cups of powdered sugar or the icing will be very runny.

Dried pretty quickly.  I used about a teaspoon of lemon juice instead of cream of tartar.  I kept this in the fridge, covered, when not in use, and it has so far lasted pretty well in there.

This was my first time trying out different piping techniques with icing, and I was actually really disappointed. It was really runny, and the patterns I tried to make just glooped together and it just looked likes lumps of goo. :P BUT that being said, it would be great to just do a general icing of sugar cookies or something, and it tasted so good, so I would use this maybe as a 'base coat'.

I made as directed.  Would be nice to know how long and to what extent you beat the egg whites.  This is important.  When it says to beat the whites with the icing sugar, mine hardened immediately, not 5 minutes as directed.  It’s very firm, I put into a zip lock bag, and sealed sending home to my daughter to join their tiny houses together for the gingerbread house.

Have made with regular and pasteurized egg whites with no problems. Veryyyy carefully added 1/4 tsp of water at a time to get consistency for flooding. Thins out quickly, so be careful when adding water.

It dries like cement. Perfect for building glue. I didn't really measure the sugar, just eyeballed it, and 4 egg whites. I did have to beat it to death, but it's humid where I'm at. It never got really thick like some of the other reviews said, but it worked just fine.

This is a really good recipe! However I found it was a little too dry to get into a icing piper easily, so I added about 2 tablespoons of milk so soften it up a bit. But otherwise it was fantastic!

I hand mix instead of using an electric mixer. I found that the icing still hardened but wasn't rock hard like other reviewers have stated. It was hard enough that I could stack them in the tins just not normal gingerbread men consistency. I recommend the recipe

It needed just a bit of lemon juice to get to proper consistency but that could have just been my measuring of the pwd. sugar.  Turned out thick, shiny and worked great as glue for our gingerbread house.  We will definitely make this again!!

Loved this icing. Held up great. We used it on sugar cookies and then finished off the left overs by making a cute little graham cracker gingerbread house.  I love a hard cookie icing and this one delivered.

Perfect for making a gingerbread house! Easy to make, and easy to use. To keep it from drying out, put a wet piece of paper towel in the bottom of a tall glass, and when I wasn't using the pastry bag filled with the icing, place it tip-down into the glass. Will keep for days as long as you keep the tip moist. You can also place it in a plastic container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the icing, and then put the plastic seal on the container, burping out any air. Just re-whip it with a spoon when ready to use again. It will keep for days like this as well. Great recipe!

Made as specified. Beat the egg whites well before adding to the sugar/cream of tartar mixture. Used to decorate gingerbread cookies. I can see where this stiff, fast-drying icing would work well for building a gingerbread house!

This worked great for our graham cracker "gingerbread" house. My aunt and I put it together and then my 4 year old nephew had a blast helping to decorate with candies and coconut "snow". We didn't eat it so I don't know how it tastes, but it kept soft while we were working with it and hardened quickly after piping which is exactly what you need for gingerbread structures!

Fantastic! Quick easy and took gel coloring nicely. The icing was very  easy to work with and came out better than expected. I wish I can say the same for our graham cracker house. I took the advice of another reviewer and melter sugar in a sauce pan to crest a glue. That worked out beautifully.

this recipe didn't work out for me the way the original recipe was written. I used my kitchenaid mixer and less than a minute into it it turned into a hard brick and almost broke my mixer. not wanting to waste ingredients I decided to add a tablespoon of water to the "brick" and it immediately smoothed out and turned into an icing that I could use for glueing together a gingerbread house. next time I make one I think I'll be looking for a different recipe to use. this one definitely would not be good to use if making something edible like cookies.

Not liquid as it should be and followed it precise.  Came out stiff.  Almost like buttercream stiff without smoothness.

Tastes great! This icing sets up so fast it's great if you don't have much time to wait for the icing to dry. It was a hit and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I used room temperature eggs and beat the egg whites in my kitchen aid mixer while sifting the powdered sugar and cream of tarter.  I used the flour shield on my mixer and gradually added the dry ingerdients.  It was perfect and frosted 24 3 inch round  cookies.

This is a great recipe, I use it for icing cookies. I beat the egg whites in a small bowl with a fork before I add it to the sugar and cream of tartar in the mixer and it turns out every time. I also use gel food coloring instead of liquid food coloring to make different colors. You have to work fast, it starts to dry after about 4 minutes when I get it on the cookies.

My 16yr old daughter used this to decorate her cutout cookies. It was super easy to work with and worked perfectly with a nice hard crust developing so that the cookies could be stacked if necessary. We like to make a thicker and a thinner version of this (just add a little bit more liquid in) to pipe a thick border around edges and then "flow" in with the thinner. Gives a very clean look. Will be using this again next time!

Easy to make!  For cut out sugar cookies, I used equal egg whites to cups of powdered sugar. Don't forget the cream of tartar.  Three egg whites and 3 cups sugar was more than enough to frost 4 dozen small cookies.

I had to add water to the recipe to get any consistency  resembling icing by following the recipe as written. added the water till the icing was to piping consistency. we used this recipe to make our very first gingerbread house. Once it was piped onto the housing structure it worked fabulous;y. as both structural mortar and for the candy attachments. 
made a second batch  added almond extract & it tasted great

I had to add a few drops of water. It was too dry to whip. I also whipped by hand. 
I only used 1/2 the recipe.  We didn't have that many cookies to decorate. Worked well. Quick drying.

The only change is that the texture is a little too thick for when I ice cookies.  I use a little squirt/ketchup type bottle, and add drops of water at a time, then stir until I have the right consistency.  Love this for when I want to make detailed cookies!

Made it exactly as instructed and it was way to thick!  The kids couldn't even spread it on their gingerbread cookies.  I ended up adding icing glycerine to make it spreadable.  Looking back I might have added an extra egg white or something but I will not be using this recipe again.

Super easy. I didn't have cream of tater so I went online and found that in icings and frosting's you can just leave it out. For best results put cookies that have been iced in the refrigerator or freezer so that they can harden.

I love this recipe and it is definitely a keeper!  Frosted gingerbread cookies with it and it was delicious!  I put it into bags as shown in the picture and it was a little harder to squeeze out than normal frosting, but my 4 and 5 year old boys did it and loved every minute of it :)

Works great. Make sure to beat it a good long time with a powerful mixer to get air into the icing and thicken it. I love some lemon juice and vanilla in it for flavor, but have to add some more sugar to make up for the liquids.

This recipe is great! I did add a little bit more butter/sugar for taste but otherwise they baked up soft and yummy!

Added vanilla to taste as little flavour otherwise.  Used pasteurized egg whites.

This icing turned out perfectly, and it was quick, even with a hand mixer.  I made sure to beat the egg whites before adding them to the sugar.  Then I put the icing into baggies, snipped off a corner, and squeezed it out to make decorating our candy house super easy.  I also found this tip from another reviewer to be essential: use melted sugar to glue the house pieces together (we used graham crackers) before decorating!
