This is the second time Iâ€™ve tried this recipe. The first time I did not grind the nuts enough.   The second time was perfect. 
I did not like the overpowering taste of coconut oil, I switched to avocado oil. 
My family loved it.

We thought this was a great dinner, and I'm not going to mark down my rating because of a couple of little things I thought about it.  First, I'd start with only about 4-5 ounces of the almonds because I had a whole bunch left over.  The little pinch of Italian seasoning would not even come close to flavoring that amount of almonds.  Next time I would only stovetop it because putting it in the oven only took a few minutes after browning it in the pan.  But we loved the flavors and the almond coating.  I was surprised that the almonds stuck to the chicken without using an egg dip, and we loved the crunch of the almonds.  Thanks for this recipe because I will make it again!
