It was the tenderest, juciest potroast I have ever made and I would make it again.  Made it with a "found" chuck roast from a friend who's freezer went belly up.  Had the oven bags on hand and decided to try it.  Think it would be fine with just one pkg of onion soup mix. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of water. Put in potatoes, carrots and another whole yellow onion with the vegies.  I don't make pot roast because usually mine has come out dry and chewy in the past.  Now it will be a go to recipe.

Delicious! I will never use a different recipe for pot roast. Followed the recipe and it was done in 3 hours. Tender and tasted sooo good. Thanks for this great recipe. The oven bag did a great job and clean up was a snap.  Martha V.

Just made this and it's awesome. Side note - I went to the store to study the onion mix packet, and decided to skip adding the mix.  Sodium in it is 600+ mg...and you're getting enough sodium in the beef consomme and Worcestershire sauce. SO, suggest adding more onion, garlic, paprika, pepper to the mix for taste.   I also added about a teaspoon of natural raw sugar in with the Worcestershire/beef consomme/water mix (as it is the only thing I saw on the onion mix bag that was missing in this recipe). I also added red potatoes to the bag, and took the the cooking time (when veggies/potatoes added) to an hour, instead of 45 minutes.

The short of it is the family loved it. My wife said this tasted like her grandmother's roast. It came out GREAT!

Very easy and delicious! I used half a packet of the soup mix because I find the entire pack a bit salty and I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the consommé.  I also sautéed fresh mushrooms in the pan I used to seat the meat which added a nice flavorful topping to the meat when plated!

Simply Delious...My husband is the meat chef in our house so when I told him I'm making the beef for Thanksgiving he was shocked.  He gave me my props..LOL LOL. I just added mushrooms since my family love that with beef.

Such a great recipe, thank you for sharing it with us all!! I add a lot of garlic powder, and onion powder also a bunch of pepper to the flour mixture. I’ve used a can of consume to make this as the recipe calls for but I’ve also used beef broth and it turns out just as delicious. Replace water for beef broth, I highly recommend it! Thanks again!

This method of cooking the pot roast is excellent! The pot roast came out so tender and juicy. Due to food allergies I did not use the onion soup mix but I tried to replicate the spice  mixture.  I also could not find beef consommé  and used beef broth instead. The vegetables were absolutely delicious cooking in the meat fat, I took the recipe authors advice & added a potato. Will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious! I never love my roasts, but this one was so flavorful. I used cream of mushroom, as someone else did, because I was out of consumme. This created a kind of gravy that I could eat with a spoon. I added carrots, celery, potatoes, mushrooms and onions. Put the potatoes and larger carrot pieces in at the beginning. Then added the rest as the recipe suggests   I cooked it just as they said, but left it in the oven at 200 for about 1 1/2 hours. I had been afraid the roast would need more time, so I put it in early. It was still perfect after staying in the warm oven.

It was perfect. I added a potato, but should have added more and more carrots. It’s supposed to feed 8, but the biggest roast I could find was only 2 and a half pounds. Three of us pretty much demolished it.

Moist, tender and flavorful.  This recipe was a huge hit with my family. I used a turkey sized bag and added lots of quartered golden potatoes, carrots,  and onions. The pan drippings make a delicious gravy too.  Don't count on having leftovers. We couldn't stop going back for more.

Best pot roast I have ever made. It’s as good as my mother’s was and I have tried for years to get it right. She didn’t have oven bags in those days, but this recipe comes closest to the pot roast she made 50 years ago. I did thicken the gravy though. That and left out the mushrooms, because I don’t care for them.

I didn’t put mushrooms in, but only because I forgot to purchase any. I added more vegetables than the recipe called for because we like lots of vegetables with roast. Aside from those two variations, I add my accolades to the author of this recipe for creating the best pot roast I’ve ever eaten!

I followed the directions exactly and my husband said, “this is the best Pot Roast you have ever made”.  Needless to say, I love to experiment however, I will be sticking with this recipe.  Thank you so much Shelley.

Really good. I cooked mine a bit longer, about 3 hours on 325. Next time I would only use 1/2 cup of water in hopes of the gravy being a bit thicker, but otherwise this is super flavorful and it came out so tender it was amazing. This was even better than the pot roast I make in the slow cooker.

This roast recipe made the most tender, flavorful roast that I have made in a long time. So tired of rubbery beef made in slowcooker or oven, so this was a much appreciated change.

This is my favorite recipe on this site. I will never make pot roast any other way again. The oven bag made the meat perfect. I've slow cooked and done on the stove top, neither can compare. The only thing I do different is add one cup of the drippings to 1 can of cream of mushroom soup for gravy. Whip up some mashed potatoes, poor gravy on them and meat. 
This also inspired me to do my Thanksgiving turkey in an oven bag.  My guests said they have never had such a moist delicious turkey.
