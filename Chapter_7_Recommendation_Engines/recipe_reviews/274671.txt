This is really good if you like spicy stuff.  I made 1.5 batches and split it up between 3 casserole dishes.  One was made as per this recipe and was good.  All the canned/jar jalapenos my husband saw at the store were actually pickled and the juices that mixed in with the overall creamy mixture was tasty.  I do think that if someone makes it without the jalapenos that it needs pepper and maybe another seasoning or two.  One was mixed with rotelle and a sprinkle of pepper, the third one I sprinkled cayenne pepper and chili powder and pepper on and that was good too.

11.5.19 After I mixed the corn and peppers with the cheese sauce, it seemed extremely thick, so I stirred in some of the reserved corn liquid.  I shouldn’t have because as it cooked, it really thinned out, the consistency was way too watery, and I ended up baking for an additional 20 minutes to cook down the liquid.  And this is not the recipe’s fault, it’s mine. I’d recommend you follow the recipe as written as I will do in the future (and should have done this time!).  I scaled this down to 4 servings, so just 1 can of corn, and the only change that I might consider is cutting back the butter.   It puddled a little on the top which I just mixed in before serving.  I might add some chopped onions and maybe try adding some buttered fresh bread crumbs on the top in the future, just for some variation. This is so darn easy to make and is really tasty.  I used Trader Joe’s Hot & Sweet Jalapeños  which gave tantalizing flavor to this side dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
