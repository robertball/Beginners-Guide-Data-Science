Not too bland, not too bold, just right - and for my turkey dinner tonight that means it was perfect.  Hubs and I both appreciated its simplicity.  I used orzo for the broken vermicelli and chicken broth rather than the bouillon and water.  Even tho’ the submitter encourages using your choice of seasoning, I stuck to the Greek seasoning as the recipe was written.  As she said, however, the recipe is versatile so it allows the flexibility to use any number of different herbs or seasonings.  We loved it, plain and simple.

What an absolutely delicious side dish for either chicken or pork.  The store didn't have either vermicelli or greek seasoning.  I used the greek seasoning recipe from the AR site (it was great) and whole grain thin spaghetti for the vermicelli.  From a presentation perspective, I think I'll break the pasta into smaller pieces the next time.  Since I used 2 tsp bouillon granules, I did not add the salt, and we didn't miss it.   We like pepper, and this was just the perfect qty for us, but if you're not a pepper lover, you may want to approach that measurement cautiously.  I think this would make an excellent filling for a hollowed out whole ripe summer tomato or even adding some shredded chicken to it for a summer lunch.  Moist, flavorful, and just downright tasty.  Thanks, Ann, this is a winner in my book.

I've tried so many rice pilaf recipes but they never seem to have the great flavor I'm looking for. This one intrigued me since it had the chicken bouillon, so I gave it a try. My only change was using Orzo in place of the vermicelli, and it worked out fine. I did add a bit more Greek seasoning, my own blend. Not only was the rice full of flavor it was a fluffy perfection.  I use Uncle Ben's Long grain rice and a pack of Goya chicken powder (it has a lot less sodium than other brands). This beats all other recipes I've tried. My husband said it was the best rice pilaf I've ever made. So this is now my go to rice pilaf recipe. Thanks Ann.

A great base recipe. I like to add my own twist and this recipe certainly allowed for that. Will be using this recipe again.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I didn't have Greek seasoning so I used Old Bay since I was serving shrimp also. I also used brown rice instead of white which, of course, increased the cooking time.  I liked the brown rice so next time would use about 1/2 the butter and increase the water to 3 cups.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe.  I was serving baked cod and wanted a rice side dish to accompany it.  This was perfect.  I also wanted to have peas as a side dish, so threw the frozen peas into the pilaf the last few minutes.  Saved washing a pan and looks very colorful.

I've purchased the prepackaged versions of pasta and rice and like this much better. Doesn't take separate shelf space in the cupboard, and I can put in the spice and bouillon to suit the entrée.

Makes a large batch, but reheats well.

I expected a nice side dish - but I hadn't expected the WOW.  I didn't have vermicelli so I used orzo. I also used an extra long grain basmati rice (which I had rinsed first) .  I will make it again using the orzo, it was a nice shape contrast. I had no store bought Greek spice so I followed a recipe I found online  (I used fresh mint and fresh oregano).  I added this pilaf to  my permanent  recipe book. So simple to prepare, yet tasted top chef. This is a spectacular recipe, thank you Ann.

I like the flexibility with this recipe. It beats buying it in a box!  My local grocer only had Orzo, which I actually prefer.  I keep Knor bouillon cubes in my pantry at all times.  It is more seasoned, so I didn't have to add extra salt. This was a perfect compliment to the Lemon Chicken Piccata, also on this site.

Made this recipe for 6 servings and it turned out great.  I served this with fish so I switched the Greek seasoning to Old Bay as suggested by the recipe submitter. Love that you can change the seasoning based on what type of meat it will be served along side.  I have made other recipes similar to this and they have lacked flavor; this one is now my favorite!

Really good recipe for rice pilaf and easy to make! I subbed the vermicelli with gluten free thin spaghetti. I confused recipes and thought I needed ½ diced onion. So, I ended up sautéing it with the spaghetti. I used 2 cups homemade chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. I simply added a little of each spice (except for onion) from the Greek Seasoning recipe on this site. I also added about ¼ tsp turmeric because I wanted more of a yellow tint to the pilaf, which bouillon probably would have given. The only change I might make next time is to use 1/2 of the butter called for in the recipe, but that’s a personal preference. Recipe is excellent as written and we’ll definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW, this rice is fantastic! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil to cook the vermicelli in, just to try to make it a bit healthier (worked out great). Also, I did not have Greek seasoning on hand, so I used 1/2 garlic powder and 1/2 season salt, which was awesome. The family LOVED this rice...a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used brown rice and modified the recipe to account for the additional cooking time.   About 50 minutes before serving I started a cup of brown rice with about 2 cups of water and chicken bouillon.   About 30 minutes later, I used the butter to cook the small pasta pieces as recommended and then put them into the rice mixture, stirred and kept cooking until rice and pasta was tender.    I also cooked some chopped onions and garlic with the pasta which is purely optional, but suits our love of vegetables.

Made this for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it. Even my three picky boys. I did make some adjustments to the recipe. To manage the salt, I didn't use bouillon, just used chicken stock. Then added salt, pepper and dried parsley for my seasonings. Another reviewer commented that the amount of liquid in the recipe was not enough. I had a similar issue and doubled the amount of liquid (chicken stock) that the recipe called for and this solved the issue.

This is rice a roni but with a different seasoning. Thanks for showing me I can make a better seasoning to go with mine. I only put in either beef or Chicken broth low fat and low salt in mine when I make it.

This is my go to recipe to add rice with my souvlaki dinner.  Sometimes I cheat and just add a bit of fresh souvlaki marinade as I'm cooking the rice for the seasoning.  The kids love it, and it makes a lovely twist on boring old rice. Have made it a few times already, and will continue to do so!

but my rice wasn't dry, it was still UNCOOKED.. i added a couple of tablespoons after cooking for 20 minutes and it was done enough, but the bottom was overcooked/crunchy.. if i were to try this again i'd use 3 extra tablespoons of water and watch it closely.. i liked the amount of pepper, but we're pepper lovers.. felt it was salty and i didn't even add the 1/2 tsp of salt.. i should have taken the advice of other reviewers and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil in place of the butter.. i think that would have solved the salty issue

I've been backing off box/bagged rice mixes and this is a winner! I used whole orzo to bump up the fiber and will also try with brown rice, but really good. This recipe is so versatile to add veggies & different spices. Possibilities are endless. 10 WWPP as the recipe reads but I'm sure that can be lowered a bit with the whole wheat and brown rice. Very grateful that you shared; thank you.

Thanks for sharing Ann!  A great base recipe to serve with just about any entree. I didn't have the vermicelli so substituted spaghetti, also used Old Bay and 1/4 tsp of pepper.  Will add mushrooms next time and use the Greek seasoning.  Happy Eating!

Delicious! I was making schwarma chicken so I decided to add hot curry powder in place of the Greek seasoning and it turned out well.  I like being able to adapt it to the main course.  Thank for a great recipe!

As almost anything can be added to this great base, while it was simmering, in a site pan I did chopped onions, red pepper, and also some celery (which is is good for adding an earthiness flavor). I stirred it in after rice simmer was complete. Delicious. Amazing hw easy. Don’t be intimidated by frying vermicelli — it was my first time and it was easy. Adds amazing flavor to rice that rice so much more savory.

I used orzo because it's what I had on hand.  This is a good, basic rice pilaf.

This  is delicious!! I will certainly make it again and again!
I made a few changes since I had to use what I had on hand;
chicken broth, whole grain brown rice and whole wheat
thin spaghetti. It was perfect, thank you!!

I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice.  I had a crowd of 10 for dinner and wasn't sure how much to fix.  Since the box of rice said serves 4, I used 3 boxes.  WAY too much!  I would only use two boxes for that size crowd again and figure to still have leftovers. I added all the seasonings listed in the recipe but  I wasn't sure what to do with the seasoning packet that came with the rice. I added one of the three packets I had.  Next time I think it would be fine to just add the packets of seasoning from ever how many boxes I use.  The only other change I made was to use 1 t. of Chicken Flavored Better Than Bouillon instead of the granules.  It has so much more flavor than the regular bouillon cubes or granules.  Easy to make and all loved it.  Served it with Turkey. Since I had so much left over, I used it to make a Long Grain and Wild Rice Soup with Turkey.   I'll defiantly make this again.

I use orzo and add about 1/4 cup chopped mushrooms and 1/4 cup chopped onion as soon as the orzo is becoming golden. I also add some minced garlic and parsley and saute right before adding the rice and liquid. VERY GOOD. I could only find Cavender's Greek Seasoning, and I used twice as much. Nice flavor. Sometimes I add 1/4 cup heavy cream at the end of cooking and let it sit 10 minutes--heavenly!! The family and teens eat this right up. Goes well with broiled fish or any meat dish.

Great recipe!  I have made this a few times using different seasoning blends. Also, since I am allergic to stuff that is in bullion, I used home made bone broth for the liquid. It turned out wonderful!

This has become a regular side at our house. It is perfect as is, however, sometimes I add some broccoli florets (chopped pretty small) towards the end of the cooking. The family likes that, too.

I love this, especially with minor adjustments:  I use brown rice because it's healthier, and Fideo instead of broken vermicelli. (Fideo is available in the Mexican food section.)  I use 3.5 cups of water because brown rice needs more liquid and just a tad more chicken bouillon powder (Caldo de pollo is the best).  I also add herbs de provence instead of greek seasoning. And simmer for about 45 minutes.  We love it and leftovers freeze and reheat well.

THIS IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE PILAF I HAVE EVER TASTED. I didn't have Greek seasoning so I made it without, but it's seriously incredible. Perfect flavor to go with meat of any kind.

I didn't have vermicelli so I used 1cup of rice only. I diced one medium onion and sauted it in 4 Tbsp.  butter until  translucent then added a heaping Tbsp. of minced garlic and sauted for one minute. After that I added 2 cups of Turkey broth and followed the recipe from there.  It took about 20 minutes on low heat after bringing to a boil to cook through and absorb all the liquid. Very tasty rice dish. Served with baked chicken and kale. I will make this again.

Really Good!  I had hubbs fooled into thinking I bought the box stuff!  If you are used to eating the -a-roni brand....  you will most likely never know the difference except this is definitely less salty - not less flavor just not as salt laden as the box stuff.  I used my kitchen shears to cut some long spaghetti noodles into small pieces instead of breaking vermicelli noodles.  Will definitely make this again.

Awesome! Rice roni without the box and makes me feel better about serving it to my kids. They loved it. I have used both precut spaghetti (sometimes I find this in the grocery store other times not) and orzo. Both work out great. I added most of the ingredients for the recipe for Greek seasoning found on this site.

I've made this three times in the past three weeks. I CAN NOT believe I used to buy this stuff in a box. This is so easy and tastes excellent! I did adjust a few spices to my own taste, reducing pepper and increasing the Greek so all three spices ended up around 1/2 tsp. I have also subbed vermicelli for orzo with great results.

Made this as a side dish for dinner tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy to make and a big hit with the family.  There wasn't a grain of rice left:)  I always like following a recipe exactly the first time I make it so I can submit a fair review.  I would definitely make this again and again and change it up with different spices.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this as written last night,  halved for 2 people and subbing low sodium chicken broth for the bouillon/water. It was very good, and it's light flavor profile paired nicely with fish. This is a simple recipe for DIY (and healthier) Rice A Roni that can easily be changed up to go with whatever you're serving. It would be nice with Italian Seasoning II served with chicken Milanese. Beef broth will pair it with simple chopped steak, add some cumin, coriander, paprika and tomato paste to give it a Mexican profile, and so on. Easy and versatile, it's a recipe easily committed to memory, ready whenever you need something quick and easy. Thanks for sharing, Ann.

My kids loved this.  I prepared pretty much as written except for the Greek spice.  I added my own seasonings. I prepared it for 8 servings instead of 4 and had leftovers even with me, my husband, and three hungry teenagers who each had generous seconds.  As another side note, I'll probably use about half the butter next time.
