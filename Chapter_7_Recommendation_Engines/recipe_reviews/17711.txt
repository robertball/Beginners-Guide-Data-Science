If you are looking for a great quick way to season ANY meat this marinade will work. We have done: chicken, pork chops, burgers, and steaks so far. It really is a tasty quick way to liven up dinner. Oh yeah, you can use any type of vinegar you have tooo. I have used white, apple cider, red wine and balsamic vinegar individually and it's still awesome. So if you don't like a certain kind of vinegar you can easily use a different kind!!!!

I thought this might be one of those highly-rated recipes that turns out to be a dud but I was so pleasantly surprised. This is the most delicious chicken and I had every member of this family raving about it. We grilled the chicken breasts after pounding them, only marinated about two hours. Tender, cooked perfectly. I will only make chicken this way from now on. Went great with a bottle of cab because of the grilling and ranch flavors. Wow! I am going to go to bed dreaming about this one tonight. Definately one of the top recipes I have ever made from this site. And did I mention how easy it came together?

Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Wow! what a great recipe!  I used the Lipton Ranch soup and dip mix packet with the rest of the ingredients just as written.  Started with frozen, boneless, skinless, chicken breasts. Poured the marinade over the breast while they were thawing in a covered corning ware dish. I pre boiled enough potatoes for hubby and myself. Preheated oven to 400 degrees F. Took the chicken out of the marinade and placed them on a cookie sheet and popped them into the oven. I then put the potatoes in the marinade to coat them well. When it was time to turn the chicken over I put the potatoes on the cookie sheet with the chicken. Turned the potatoes once to brown on the other side. The chicken and potatoes were excellent!! So quick and easy, I can't wait to try this on different meats. Thank you so much. This will be a regular at our house.

Very Tasty! Read the reviews, then I altered alittle. Used 6 skinless, boneless tenderloins. Doubled recipe and then added water to make 1 cup of marinade. Baked 350 in marinade covered 25 min. then 25 min. uncovered. Poured off liquid and left in oven while I finished side dishes. Tasted great, even picky kids ate it. Thanks!

This is one of my husband's favorites. We usually serve with rice. I've done this multiple times, and to tell you the truth, the amount of time I've marinated it hasn't made much of a difference.

My family just loved this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, and marinated 3 chicken breasts that I cubed.  I put the chicken on skewers and grilled on my George Forman grill.  Had my grandchildren over for dinner and they were thrilled with their "chicken-on-a-stick" dinner!  Thank you, I will be making this one again and again!

YOu know, a long time ago the Ranch packets used to have a recipe on them for Ranch Chicken.  A way my college roomies and I made it was to just use: chicken breast + Ranch mix. No vinegar.  250 degrees, bake for 2 hours with foil cover and the natural juices and the ranch make it so tender you dont need anything but a fork.

I'd really like to give this 4.5 stars (.5 knocked off for the cooking time, which seems off to me).  For this recipe to be so easy, this was truly tasty!  This is a perfect dish for a weeknight dinner.  Now, I used 2 HUGE chicken breasts that I cut into smaller portions first.  Then I sprinked half the pack of dry mix onto my meat & let it marinate for an hour.  Then I mixed the remaining dry mix and the same amounts of oil/vinegar and poured over the chicken.  Baked uncovered for about 45 minutes; I dunno what type of chicken would be done in 15.  Either way, mine was perfect...moist and still had some liquid to drizzle over the meat.  I'm having leftovers for lunch today...YUMMO!

Simple and tasty. Instead of broiling the chicken, I put it in a tinfoil pouch, closed for twenty minutes at 350, then open for another twenty at 400. My husband's going for seconds right now.

This was a delicious marinade.  I pounded my chicken breasts flat, then let them sit in the marinade.  Instead of broiling, I dredged them in bread crumbs and sauteed them in olive oil.  The were nice and crispy, and much lighter than if I marinated them in prepared ranch dressing.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I cut up one whole chicken and used that. I realized my packets were 4 oz. I had two of those and used considerabley more olive oil to marinate. I marinated the chicken for no more than one hour so it wasn't too salty. I lined a 13x9 pan with foil and clean-up was easy to! With the bone-in chicken it took about 22 minutes flipping every 5 minutes. I broiled on HI with the rack one down from top rack to avoid burning. I will definitely be making this again. Perfect with a salad. Broilers are great for getting that outdoor grilled taste.

Suzy great recipe. I have one that is basiclly the same. I put ranch dressing in a bag and marinate the chicken up to 24 hours. Take ranch bread crumbs and crush add dry ranch dressing some salt and pepper to taste and take the chicken and either dredge in the dry mix or put it in a bag and shake it. My husband loved it!!!!

Oh my gosh!  I've used this recipe for years.  I first learned about it on the back of Hidden Valley Ranch.  I saw it once, and never saw it again.  Luckily it is easy to remember.  THE BEST RECIPE!!!  I boost the Red Wine Vingar just to add a little zing....otherwise, it is perfect.

This chicken recipe is absolutely delicious! I used boneless chicken breasts and baked them for 30 - 35 minutes. Then broiled them for 10 or 15 minutes until 180 degrees. 
I believe this is the first recipe I have commented on after using this website for a couple of years.

We made this the other night and enjoyed it.  I mixed the marinade in a bowl (it was quite thick), dipped my chicken, coating both sides.  I placed them in a shallow baking dish and poured the remaining mixture over the top.  I was concerned that if I’d used a resealable bag, all the marinade would stick to the bag instead of the chicken.  Then I refrigerated it for several hours before dinner.  We grilled this rather than broiling it, which worked out very well.  This may not be my favorite chicken, but it’s certainly a snap to put together.  That alone makes this worth making again.

This was absolutely delicious!!! At first, I really didn't think it was going to be enough to add flavor to the chicken, but it came out perfect! This is going to be a regular in our house. Grilled these instead of broiled, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with this one.

I have been making this for several years. Only you mix in a bowl the Hidden Valley Ranch packet and the red wine vinegar and olive oil. Then you place it in a baggie and let it marinate. The only downside is the HVR packet looks exactly the packet for the dip so you have to be careful not to get the wrong packet.

So easy and so good! Very moist chicken with only 1.5 hours of marinating time. I broiled 5 min, turned the pieces and broiled another 2-3 min. Very yummy with pasta and alfredo sauce.

Like most of the previous reviews, I was amazed at how easy and GOOD this recipe was! Followed ingredients to a T... baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes then set the oven on Broil and broiled for 10 minutes, or until the top starts to get brown and bubbly. Highly recommend. Enjoyed with rice and veggie- simple, simple!

This is now the ONLY way I will fix chicken! Man-friend thought this was wonderful paired with broccoli/pasta Alfredo, I uploaded a picture because our breast was rather large. Easy, Quick, and super moist and tasty!

Outstanding!!!! I used chicken wings seasoned with some Emeril Seasoning...since I knew I was only marinating for an hour.  They turned out great!!!  I baked them for 45 minutes and then placed under the broiler for the crispiness!!!

My family really liked these but I couldn't try it (I'm on a diet that I can't eat this stuff). I marinated pork chops the night before. Next time I am going to try it on chicken, I was justy trying to use up some pork, although I do think it can go on any piece of meat. So simply this one is a keeper!

This turned out delicious!  I put frozen breasts in the bag with marinade and let marinate about 9 hours.  By dinner time they were thawed and by the taste, they were marinaded just right.  Broiled as recipe said about 8 min on one side and 9 on the other.  Were done perfectly then, very tender and juicy.  Will definitely make again.  Very easy to do with great results.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. Something out of the ordinary to do for dinner. My boyfriend loved the chicken! Instead of red wine vinegar I used Balsamic, and also added a half teaspoon of liquid smoke. Cut up the chicken and scewered with onions and broiled for about 20 minutes. Tasted like kabobs right off the grill! Thanks for the great recipe!

The marinade was nice and thick and really coated the chicken. I didn't take the time to pound the chicken to an even thickness (prepared early while people were sleeping elsewhere in the house) so I didn't broil the whole time - I baked about 20 mins at 350 and broiled for 4 or 5 mins at the end to brown the top of a parmesean cheese/italian breadcrumb coating I had applied. I put the coating on because I have occasionally overcooked chicken when I bake it as opposed to grilling or sauteing - this marinade turned out to not need that precaution, it was very tender and juicy. The flavors stand well enough on their own, I don't think the cheese or seasonings in the crumbs were needed and actually detracted from the delicious marinade. I look forward to getting this recipe onto the grill - thanks for sharing :)

No fuss, no muss, extremely tasty recipe for chicken breasts.  Instead of the package dressing, I used the Ranch Dressing from this site -- a little more healthy.  I used one less tablespoon of olive oil and it worked just fine.  Great recipe!

This was pretty delicious...although pretty salty.  I didn't have enough dry ranch dressing, so i added some liquid Ranch.  The chicken was moist and very juicy, although I would have preferred a little more Ranch.  Hubby loves Ranch, and he thought it was pretty good.  Definitely worth making again. :)  I put the chicken on the very bottom of the oven while broiling, and used a meat thermometer making sure to take out the chicken before it hit 165 degrees.

This recipe is amazing!  I followed it exactly but only got to marinate my chicken for 20 minutes.  My boyfriend who typically hates chicken breast absolutely loved it!  I grilled it for about ten minutes on each side, and it was super moist and full of flavor!  This is going to be my go to chicken marinade always!

Wonderful!!!  I tried this recipe according to directions and I must say this is a very tasty chicken.  Although I didn't do the chicken breast-instead I cooked chicken thighs (in bone) and chicken legs-and they came out wonderfully. The following day I made whole shrimp  kabobs the same way. and they were the best shrimp I've ever had.  Thank you very much for the post tasty, tasty, tasty--If you like flavor you must try this marinade

This was great and extremely easy.  I made it gluten free for me by using Hidden Valley ranch mix. My 12 year old daughter couldn't get enough.  I marinated the first batch then had to make more immediatly.  Both marinated and not were great.

We loved it!  I marinated it overnight and all day (about 21 hours) and did everything exactly as the recipe says.  I wouldn't change a thing!  My husband said "That chicken really has a LOT of flavor."  I broiled it and it took a little longer, but I just used my meat thermometer and broiled 10 minutes on one side, then turned it and broiled until it came to 160 degrees.  Will be making this again for sure! I served with fettucine alfredo with peas and mushrooms added.  Great meal!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. Quick and super easy even when you increase the amount of servings. In addition I usually dry out the boneless chicken breasts but these turned out so juicy. It says to marinade for an hour but I did it for 8-9 hours. Turned out wonderfully!!

I used white balsamic vinegar and marinated for 1 1/2 hours.  It was good, moist.  Next time I will marinate longer for hopefully more flavor.

I was really excited to try this. Seeing that it's the summer and excruciatingly hot as heck, I chose to grill these instead of broiling. Anything heat wise in the house is a huge no-no in 95+ degree weather. Let me start out by saying the simplicity is FANTASTIC for those who like simple and easy. The taste in it's own right is also fantastic and even more experienced pallets will completely enjoy the flavor. I marinaded mine overnight (Only because it was just too hot to go out to grill, so we had sandwiches) and grilled the next day. I'm so excited about this recipe that we even let my neighbor try "A BITE." It came out delish, and grilling is a wonderful option to broiling in the summer months. The fact that this can be enjoyed year 'round for sure gets my vote. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using it often. We're foodies in this house so taste mixed with ease and room to add your own spin is great. This chicken, perfect as is. :)

Very yummy.  I used frozen chicken tenders and let them marinate for about 30 hours.  I lined a pan with aluminum foil, and broiled for about 5 minutes each side.  It created almost a carmelized finish on the chicken that was really very tasty.   Easy prep, quick to cook, and a snap to clean up.  This is definately a keeper.

Really tastey.  I jused regular chicken and added more olive oil.  It was still kind of thick but it has a crust on the chicken that was very flavorful.

WOW, thanks for this recipe! I made this as written but decided to cut the chicken into chunks and grill them as shish kabobs. I cut up an onion and a red and green pepper, tossed them with a little olive oil and McCormick’s chicken seasoning. Made kabobs by alternating veggies and chicken and grilled them up. Served them up with Uncle Bens wild rice for a dinner everyone loved! I will be making this a lot! Thanks!

I played around with this since I didn't have all the ingredients. I used Italian seasoning mix, apple cider vinegar, and cut the olive oil in half. I rubbed the mixture on chicken pieces, and then backed it on 400 for nearly an hour, broiling the last few minutes for a crispy finish. The family loved it.

This is now a favorite marinade. I marinated the chicken for 1 1/2 hours and then broiled it. It was flavorful and juicy. Definitely a keeper.

SUPER good! I'm not a huge fan of boring ol' grilled chicken breast, but it's healthy, so I keep trying to find better recipes. I loved this one! And my husband was CRAZY about it! The best part - it's SO easy! I didn't feel like cooking the evening I marinated it, so it marinated 2 days. No problem! All the better. Thanks for the easy, yummy, healthy recipe! This one's a keeper.

So easy and so delicious.  I prepared the marinade as listed and marinated overnight.  I grilled the chicken on an indoor grill and it was wonderful.  Very tender and very tasty!

Absolutely delicious.  When I started making it I realized the bagger at the grocery didnt bag the ranch dressing mix.  So I substitute the seasoning mix from a box of Suddenly Salad that my daughter had brought home from college.  It was a ranch with spinach mix. I was worried but it was delicious!!!! Very moist and full of flavor.  My husband wants me to make it like that again!

I'm a terrible cook and hardly anything I try turns out tasty. I marinated chicken breasts, salmon fillets, and tillapia fillets the night before and then we grilled outside.  Everyone loved it!  I'm giving 5 stars because this recipe is super easy, dummy proof, and both kids and adults liked it.  Thanks for a recipe that made me a hero in the kitchen for once.

I had lamb cutlets in the frig and couldn't decide how to cook them, so I used this recipe (to the letter).  It was delish.  I didn't know what a Dry Ranch style dressing was, but made it up according to the info on this site.

This is a mindblowing idea!!! And SO simple. I tried this except I let it marinate for 2 days instead of overnight...was MMMMMMM! Only difference is I increased the servings and instead of chicken breast, used 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they're much juicier, have better texture and are much more flavorful than dry chicken breasts. And the few extra calories in dark meat are nothing because the flavor  more than makes up for it. Next time, I'm going to try this with turkey.

Got this recipe from a friend a few months ago and she told me to grill the chicken on the BBQ. It is awesome that way as the chicken get a little charred. I suppose you can get the same affect with broiling so I will try it. Also, I prefer to use thin sliced chicken breast.

VERY GOOD. i did not have 'red wine vinegar' so i made up my own substitute by using 'rice vinegar' and a splash of red wine (pinot noir). DELISH! Also put ours on the BBQ grill.

This was A-MAZING!  The chicken came out so tender and flavorful!  This will definitely be a keeper.  One side note, due to unforeseen circumstances, the chicken marinated in the refrigerator for two nights!  Don't know if that made a difference or not, but it sure didn't hurt it!!

WONDERFUL!!! I would suggest 2-3 tbsp on red wine, pepper, more chicken can be added. I have only used on chicken Wings...usually about 6-8 in bag to marinate (3 hrs @ min). Poure marinate over meat. Bake for 30 mins at 350 with bottoms up.. then remove & adjust oven to broil temp...turn meat upward skin up, broil for about 15 mins...until darkens.  A KEEPER...VERY good recipe!!!

This was really flavorful!  I only had chicken tenders so I used those, and I threw them on the BBQ instead of using the broiler.  So simple to make...just put them in the marinade in the morning and grill them when you get home.  If you know what's in the marinade then yes, it does taste like Ranch, but at the same time, the vinegar changes the flavor so if you didn't know what was in it you might not figure it out.  But who cares, it was good!  Will definitely make again!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Broiling definitely gave us the grilled out taste we were looking for.  I used chicken tenderloins and had some left over for a grilled chicken salad today.  Can't wait until lunch!  Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe!

This was very good and easy to make.  I had to cook it for longer than fifteen minutes, but the chicken I used was pretty big.  I was hoping that it would get golden like it did in the other pictures, but overall it was juicy and very flavorful.

This is absolutely the best chicken I have ever eaten. I started with 3 frozen chicken breast, mixed the ingredients together in a gallon ziploc, rinsed the ice off of the chicken breast, added them to the ziploc and massaged marinade into the chicken. I marinated for about 6 hours. Before I grilled them, I wiped the breasts off as i was pulling them out of the ziploc (B/C of the reviews of burning marinade) then lightly sprinkled with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, and put on the grill (325 degrees) I ran out of gas after 10 mins. (I KNOW, HUH?) I put them in the oven and finished them on a broiler pan for about 15-20 mins. (still at 325-350 degrees) Anyway, I left the judging to my picky 6 yr. old son and my (just recently picky) 10 yr. old daughter. She finished her plate of a chicken breast, saffron rice (aka banana rice) and green beans, in just under 5 mins. My son (a chew 32x per bite) did it in 10!!! So, to all you Moms looking for the PERFECT chicken recipe, this is it! This will be added to my weekly rotation.

This was very good - not "oh my gosh I can't wait to make this again" good but pretty good.  I will make it again, it was pretty simple.  The marinade came out so thick that I knew the chicken wouldn't be covered by it so I had to add more oil to loosen it up a bit.

Very simple, very tasty recipe.  I mixed the marinate ingredients in a zip lock bag and added 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  This was much, much more than the 2 breasts originally called for but the marinate goes a long way.  Placed bag in the refrigerator and shook it up when I remembered it.  Six hours later, placed the chicken on a hot grill for 8 minutes each side.  It was wonderful.

I made this, and after marinating the chicken nearly 24 hours, it still turned out dry.  A bit of a disappointment.

I made this recipe with 9 thighs as we don't care for white meat and tripled it. Doubled would have been plenty. My fiance grilled them and they were delicious. This is a keeper and thanks so much for sharing!

Very tasty and easy to make.  After re-reading the recipe, I realized I was using two breasts instead of two breast halves...so I doubled the marinade as I was using twice the meat...and I decided to cut the breasts into strips.  I broiled it under the second rack in the oven and then after the time was up, marinated them again and broiled again for another five minutes.  The charring of the broiling actually adds quite a bit of flavor as well!

I made this for dinner tonight changing the recipe to feed 6 people.  Everyone loved it.  I did use boneless breast.  Some of the pieces were thick, so I had to cook them for 20 minutes until they temped 165 degrees.  I served this with dumplings and a green salad.

As someone suggested I halved the dressing so not so salty, and cooked in the oven at 350 for 15-20 minutes (I used boneless strips so they were thin) and it tasted very good. Tasty fast meal. 5 stars for ease!

Just made these last night, followed the recipe exactly (using thin cut chicken breasts, so I shortened the broiling time just a little) and they were a huge hit!  Extremely easy, tasty, and very little cleanup if you line your broiling pan with foil before cooking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We used Hidden Valley ranch mix & doubled the recipe for 4 breast.  We only had time to marinate for 1.5 hours & cooked on  medium heat in a charcoal grill & threw on some fresh cracked pepper while cooking, AWESOME! My wife said it was the best chicken she's ever had (served with fresh green onions brushed with olive oil & seasoned with pepper & Lawry's salt then grilled for the last 4 minutes). One of the best dinners we've had in a long time!

This was a great dish.  The chicken came out tender and flavorful! Very easy and fast to put together. I only let mine marinate for 1 1/2 hours and it came out great. I served it with "Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes" and a cucumber/tomato salad w/red wine vinegar and parsley. GREAT!!!

This has become another one of those easy always keep ingredients on hand recipes in our house now because it's just so simple and so deicous. Even the picky eaters are requesting this regularly! Only thing I do different is I use the same amount of marinade and buy more chicken, usually about a pound to pound and a half of thinly sliced chicken breasts and I tenderize by simply pricking with a fork before marinating. Simple as that. :)

Big hit!  I followed the recipe exactly (marinated for 2 hours) except I doubled it so I could cook 4 chicken breasts and I only had tarragon vinegar on hand so I used that instead of the red wine flavor.  I broiled on the top rack (500) for 18 minutes.  So easy and so good.  My husband couldn't wait to have the leftovers today (which were great btw, even cold and a day later).

Needed a little salt and pepper.  Next time I will bake or fry it.  I like browning my meat a little bit.  Besides that it was prefect.

When I make this again I will either use less of the Ranch mix or slice the chicken to add to a cream cause over pasta. It was VERY salty. I marinaded it overnight to help with flavor, but that may have just made it saltier. I also had to flip the chicken under the broiler and do 10-12 min on each side to cook it through. Tasted good ...just too salty.

Really liked this.  I had 4 breast halves, so increased the oil and vinegar.  We wound up going out with friends at the night I was going to cook these, so they marinated 2 days in the fridge.  Only thing I would change would be to turn them 1/2 way through to brown on both sides.

Nice quick and easy recipe.  Very tasty and moist chicken.  DO NOT be tempted to add any other spices like salt or pepper. The HVR mix has enough salt.  Will def try again.  Thanks Suzynagy and AR!

Tasty and oh so easy!  I used boneless thighs only because we prefer dark meat of the chicken.  Thanks for a quick week-night recipe!

A-mazing! Used apple cider vinegar because that was what I had. Grilled to perfection at 7 mins a side. I will be watching for chicken sales so I can grill up tons of this for the non-grilling season! Thanks!

I've been using this marinade for grilled chicken for 10yrs! It is by far one of our favorite recipes. You know it's a keeper when your kids say you could serve this in a restaurant!

I ended up buying a whole chicken fryer cut up and I doubled the marinade.  We grilled the chicken for 20 minutes on each side and the chicken turned out so moist and juicy.  My husband was still talking about the chicken the next day.  Easy, fast, delicious... you can't beat that!

I thought this was just okay. The chicken was a little bland (I even seasoned ith w/salt & pepper before marinating it) & there was nothing special about it. I'm not sure if I'll make this again or not.

Very Good! My chicken was too thick to cook on broil (I forgot to pound them before marinating) so I just baked them. They turned out very nice. I used 3 large chicken breasts and for the marinate I added 1 extra tb of olive oil.

Oh so good!  This was a fantastic marinade!  I doubled the recipe,  mixed it up, as directed, and threw it in a zip-lock bag with leg quarters for about an hour.  I cooked these on the BBQ grill, and they were to die for!  Served them up with some baked potatoes and green beans.  I think next time I might make extra marinade and try injecting some of it into the thighs and leg pieces for some extra zing.

Great dinner for when you forget to put something to marinate overnight.  It tastes just as good being marinated for 2 hours.  Delicious with some parmesan on top!

Enjoyed the flavor this gave to chicken breasts. Very savory with a bit of zest to it. I used white balsamic vinegar and baked these instead of broiling them.

This was pretty good. The ranch was a little overpowering. I think I'll double the oil and vinegar next time to have more of a marinade and tone down the spice. Definitely worth a try!

I tried this for the first time and it was good. I'm not sure if it was the type of ranch I bought but man the chicken came out salty tasting. My husband and son LOVED it so I will for sure try it again. We grilled it outside and I was suprised that it came out so juicy. I also took other reviews into consideration and marinated the night before and left in in the fridge till I got home from work. 4 stars from me!

So simple, and so delicious!  It's hard to beleive that something so easy to throw together turned out with such a distinctive & yummy flavor.  In his bedtime prayers, our 6-year old son thanked God for the chicken!

AMAZING! Thank you so much for this recipe! It's so easy and delicious. My husband says it's his new favorite recipe. The fact that it's very healthy is an added bonus! I substitute white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar (personal preference) and put equal parts olive oil and vinegar (to reduce the cost a bit). This is pretty much the perfect chicken recipe-easy, cheap, delicious, and health!

Great recipe...so easy and tasty.  I agree with other reviewers - double the marinade (I let it sit for about 10 hours).  Also, it took longer than 15 minutes to broil so make sure it is cooked through like the recipe states.

Very good! My husband said "how did you make this?" it was so juicy and tender i was suprised. the marinade was also flavorful, even though after broiling there didnt appear to be much marinade left on the breast.

I think this is a very good recipe.  I made it for my husband and myself and both agreed that we liked it.  It's an easy version and gives you another option besides barbeque sauce for grilled chicken breasts.

I usually follow receipes exactly, but I did not have the right ingredients.  I had frozen chicken breasts, which I did not thaw, Safeway Onion soup and Dip Mix, Balsamic Vinigar.  I just followed the procedure and marinated the food all day and it was terrific.

This was so good and easy. My son absolutely loved it and asked why I didn't make more. I doubled the amount of marinade, and I'm glad I did. Otherwise, it would have not been enough. Definitely a keeper.

Not sure whether to give this 3 or 4 stars.  It wasn't great but it wasn't bad.  It didn't have much of the ranch flavor that I was expecting.  I had higher expectations for this recipe.

This chicken recipe was so easy and delicious. Very tender. My very picky 22 year old loved it and even took some to work the next day for lunch. Made it exactly as written except to flatten the chicken breasts before marinating them.  Thank you SUZYNAGY.

This is the most delicious and moist chicken I have EVER cooked.  EVER!!  It deserves ten stars.  Marinated it for the day and cooked on a stovetop grill.  I will NEVER use plain chicken again.  Definitely let it sit for about 10 minutes after you remove it from the heat.  SO tender and juicy.  You can't go wrong with this one; can't wait to try other meat!

Made this Monday morning and let it marinate while I was at work.  It turned out very well -- the chicken stayed nice and juicy.  I did end up adding more oil and vinegar, because the mixture was a little too gritty and lumpy and not liquid enough to marinade properly at first.  Also, I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used basalmic -- and for the hell of it, I added one small splash of soy sauce.  Very tasty, and extremely simple -- two of my biggest requirements in recipes.

Let the marinate in the fridge overnight. Pounded them to uniform size before putting them on the grill. Served them as grilled chicken sandwiches. The chicken was moist and the flavor wasn't too bad, tasted the tiniest bit salty, perhaps because of the ranch mix I used. I think this may taste better as a beef marinade.

I used pieces from a whole chicken, so for that reason I baked at 350 for an hour instead of broiling.  I marinated for about 1 1/2 days as well--had other chicken recipes to try first!  Bf enjoyed it very much--nice ranch flavor, and the chicken is very moist.  Thanks for the recipe.

This chicken is absolutely delicious!  Very moist and flavorful.  I substituted the olive oil for FF italian dressing, and I forgot to add in the vinegar (although I suspect the vinegar would make the chicken even more tender and juicy).  Next time (and I will be making this often) I will add in the vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't overly impressed with this.  I laugh when people make mention of the salt content - there is ranch dressing mix in here, so you need to expect that it's going to taste salty.  Anyway...I breaded and baked and while it was flavorful, tender and juicy....it wasn't what I was looking for.  Thanks anyway!

This recipe is delicious! Thanks.
I marinated the chicken for about an hour and broiled it for 10 minutes. Perfect! I served with rice and salad with ranch dressing.
I used kosher skinless boneless chicken breasts.

This was one of the best recipes I've tried on here! I found it was a little too salty though and I love salt. I followed some other reviews and doubled the sauce. Next time I will double the sauce by double the liquid ingredients but only use ONE ranch dressing packet. I think that will make it perfect!  SO DELISH!

I tried this recipe and my family and I really liked it.  I followed the recipe, the only thing I did differently was let the chicken breasts sit all day in the marry sauce and broil that evening.  It was excellent.  Doesn't look like its enough sauce for four ck breast, but it is!  My 4 yr old daughter gobbled down 1 and a 1/2 by herself!  We'll use this recipe again for sure.

I am a huge fan of Ranch so I decided to try this.  VERY happy I did.  Like someone else, I pounded the breasts and grilled them, marinated about 5 hours.  It was delicious without being over-powering.  A great grilled chicken dish to make if you are having company and not sure how they like their chicken.  Picky 13-yr-old son said "now THIS is good."  You can't go wrong with this one!

I make this every other week and it is my family’s favorite. No changes except that I have to make extras!  It is important to discard the marinade. Don’t do what I did the first time and pour it over the chicken. Just follow the directions to the letter.

This chicken was delicious.  I added a little more of the olive oil and vinegar because I had 3 chicken breasts but probably would have been fine with the amounts in the recipe.  All 4 people in my family liked this.

Best chicken marinade ever. I was worried it wouldn't be good so we only marinated one chicken breast in this and the others in light Italian dressing. We grilled outdoors. This one was the favorite by far. I felt like it made less of a marinade and more of a paste but that worked fine. I'm not sure it would have been enough marinade if both chicken breasts were large. We probably only marinated 30 minutes or so but it was so tender and delicious!!!  Will make this often. Thanks for such a simple and delicious recipe!!!

This was very tasty, and very quick and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was to cook them on a gas grill, I checked the temperature several times and pulled them as soon as they reached 165 degrees, to make sure they didn't dry out.

This has been a favorite for a couple of years. Quick to set up, drive the kids to activities, come back to cook quickly under the broiler. Substitute Greek plain yogurt for the oil - my husband's acid reflux is triggered by oil. No problems so far with the yogurt substitute!!

This is a fabulous recipe and so easy to prepare.  We love the tang that the red wine vinegar imparts, so we add an extra tablespoon (or more) of it but even "as written" it is very tasty.  It's our "go to" recipe when we are grilling chicken!

It was a very tasty dish, however the cooking times need adjustment. Raw chicken breasts are not going to be done through with only 15-20 of broiling.

This was amazing and ridiculously simple. Mother-in-law says it's the best chicken she's ever had. The chicken was frozen when I started marinating it and was still very moist and flavorful.

I baked the chicken instead of broiling it. It came out just as well, but next time I am going to try a teaspoon of sugar in the marinade as it was a wee bit salty. Other than that, it is definitely a keeper :)

I found that the cooking time was way too short for chicken. I almost tripled the time. The flavour was good. I think I'll try it again, but back it.

Came out terrible. Maybe because I started with frozen chicken tenders.  Might be better to thaw, then marinate.

This was just ok...everyone doused it with barbecue sauce, even after marinating for several hours. Not strong enough flavors, just ok. If you plan on dousing your chicken in barbecue sauce anyway this recipe would add a bit more flavor. Otherwise keep looking.

Very flexible, didn't have ranch mix, so used 2 tablespoons of Hidden Valley buttermilk ranch dressing and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar pomegranate and 1 1/2  tablespoons of olive oil for the marinade.   
This was for two chicken breasts which were cut into four pieces to absorb more of the marinade.

Decided to grill at 400 degrees to sear and then immediately turned down the heat to 300 degrees. Rotated for 5 minutes or so to get the dark grill marks repeated on the other side for 7 minutes, checked for well done and it was.. 
   It was even better than a similar recipe tried a few days earlier.

This was very delicious! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. So juicy and tender! I threw the marinade together and tossed the chicken in a ziploc the day before so that I could have it the next day. Leaving it overnight I think definitely let the marinade sink in. I broiled it one rack down from the top like another user said and it came out a lovely golden brown. I served it with sour cream mashed potatoes and broccoli. Great for a weekday dinner and I'm sure kids would like it too. I would like to try this marinade and then bread and fry the chicken next time!

This recipe is so easy! I marinated the chicken (3 breasts instead of 2) for about 24 hours- took about 5-10 minutes. I then put them on a broiler sheet and sprayed cooking spray over them to keep them moist in the oven then topped them with a few seasonings (I think I used cajun seasoning and garlic and herb seasoning). I broiled for about 15-18 minutes and they were so good! Very moist and delicious.

Fabulous. The only substitution that I made was using the spicy ranch instead. It added just the right amount of spice, and added a wonderful kick to an already fabulous meal.

I have made this three times now and it is great. My husband loves it. I didn't change a thing and all three times I did let it marinate for 24 hours in the fridge, it came out good each time.

I liked this, didn't find it too salty because we used more than 2 chicken breasts. Also, we didn't broil this, we grilled it. Very good this way. 

To those who said they marinated it for the 24 hours and it was too dry..this recipe really shouldnt be a longer marinated recipe..because of the higher salt content. Salt cooks food...with out heat. A quicker "marinade" with this is best. Like 3 or 4 hours tops.

We made this 2 nights ago, and my 6 yr old keeps asking us to make it again!  It was delicious.  We did let it marinate over night.  It was juicy and full of flavor.  I was concerned it would be too tangy or the ranch would be overpowering, but it was not at all.  We have plans to make it again and serve on top of a salad!

Oh boy did this fly off the platter! I have 6 kids, and I basically had to quadruple the amount of chicken, but I used 3 packets of Ranch Dressing mix. It made enough to coat all 8 halves after I just added a tiny bit more of the liquid ingredients, and a splash of buttermilk I had from making mashed potatoes the previous night. Served it with rice, and braised Swiss Chard, and there was nothing left! Thanks so much for sharing, and giving me a new fave for my household! :)

I used more chicken then what the recipe called for and doubled the marinade recipe. I had to leave it in the oven a little longer too but it turned out fantastic. My husband and daughter asked me to make it again which they usually don't do with new recipes. This is definitely a recipe I will be saving!

Fantastic recipe! Our broiled chicken came out tender, juicy, and so flavorful! I added a few things: two tablespoons of mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan, 1/2 clove chopped garlic, 1/2 clove roasted garlic. And instead of vinegar, I used a splash of white moscato wine. I combined all of that into sort of a paste, saturated the chicken, and had it marinading in the fridge for about an hour. We broiled it for about 25 mins (our meat thermometer read the meat at 144 degrees). It was the best chicken I’ve tasted in a very long time and we look forward to making it again.

Delish! Marinated overnight and used balsamic vinegar as that is my family's preference, and they loved it. You know you have a winner when they ask for it again.

I made this last night, after having marinated the chicken overnight.  I set the time at 15 mins and it still looked a little pink so added 5 more mins. The flavor was not overpowering but the chicken breasts were so moist!!! Will make this recipe again.

I put them on the grill rather than the broiler.  Excellent...however I tad bit salty, that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.  I'll definitely make again.

I don't understand the positive reviews. I combined all the ingredients and let it marinade for several hours. Baked it for 30 minutes and broiled for a few minutes. My husband and I thought it remotely tasted fishy.

We grill ours instead of broiling. And try grilling or broiling the marinated chicken and then make salad of greens, cherry tomatoes, green onions, bellpeppers and along any either favorite salad fixings; and chop the chicken then serve over the salad. Fanstatic!

These were so easy and so very good. After marinating, I grilled the chicken outside. Served as sandwiches, with tomato, onion, spinach and bacon... With some ranch dip as a condiment on top (made with dry ranch mix and greek yogurt). YUM, the whole family loved these.

Thank your for this delicious recipe!! It was easy, quick, and very tasty. I marinated the chicken overnight, and the next day broiled it for dinner. It came out with a crispy crust, and incredibly juicy and tender on the inside. I want to try to marinate steak kabobs in this marinade, I'm sure it will be amazing. Thanks again for sharing!

*EDIT* This continues to be one of my favorite recipes from this site.  *EDIT* I doubled this recipe and used boneless chicken thighs which I marinated overnight.  Delicious!!  My picky son raved about it and told me to put this on a weekly rotation!

This was delicious!  The flavor really popped with each bite.  I made it on the grill and used turkey cutlets and it was wonderful!

What can I say? It's boneless chicken. Just okay. I followed the recipe but used a cast iron grill pan, finished in oven for 8 minutes after searing. It was perfectly cooked, but the flavor was minimal. I don't get the rave reviews. There was no sauce, and mine did not look "red", like some of the photos.

Well, I made this and I agree with some that it is very bland...I saw where it says only 1 ounce of the dry mix...I am wondering now if they meant one whole package, and that is 3.5 ounces. My husband couldn't tell I did a thing to the chicken except that I  forget to put the salt on it,  he said...But it was very juicey....

Took much longer than the recipe calls for to broil even though I scaloppined the chicken.
Just OK. Would not make it again.

We found this to be just okay.  I marinated overnight, baked then broiled a few minutes to give it a golden color.  It was flavorful and moist, it just wasn't something we would WANT regularly.

This was great! I used a whole cut-up chicken and tripled the recipe to have enough marinade. My husband loved it and he's not big on new recipes. I baked it in the oven at 400 degrees until done.

Made exactly as written. I wasn't sure there was enough marinade for the amount of chicken but it was perfect. Everyone loved it, even my husband who claims to hate ranch (I didn't tell him it was an ingredient so it couldn't have been so powerful since he didn't notice on his own either).

I doubled this recipe, except I did not double the ranch seasoning because I thought it might be a stronger flavor than what I desired. It turned out delicious. It was very moist and flavorful. Definetly marinate overnight; it's so much tastier that way. Thanks for the recipe, my usual chicken recipes were starting to get boring!

Nothing earth shattering about the end result. I'd hoped for a lot more based on reviews, but this one was nothing special. Will not make again or use any form of this base to modify. There are a ton of better recipes out there.

This has become one of my favorite, "standard" recipes.  Because using my broiler sets off my ultra-sensitive smoke detectors, I bake this recipe in the oven instead at 375 for about 30 min., depending on number and thickness of chicken breasts.   I mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl instead of a plastic bag and stir it thoroughly. I love the minimal prep time and then the tanginess of the final result.   This is a winner in my house!

This was a super easy way to give traditional chicken a new flavor.  I used skinless chicken thighs, which kept it very juicy and also marinated overnight, as suggested by several others.  I will definitely make again.

My new favorite way to make chicken :) I used a package of savory herb since I didn't have ranch on hand and it still came out amazing on the grill.

This was delicious! I used my indoor grill. I had to grill it for a slightly longer time than the recipe indicated but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loved it! It was a great early spring meal paired with sauteed zucchini and couscous :) Will definitely keep this one!

It was good.  I used three chicken breasts so there would be something for lunch tomorrow, but didn't think about increasing the marinade recipe.  I think it would have been better had I thought about that.  I flipped the chicken after the 15 minutes so the other side could get browned for a few minutes.  I prefer drier chicken, so I probably should have cooked it another 5-7 minutes.  Next time I'll make more marinade, marinate it longer than 2 hours and cook it longer, but it is definitely worth making again.    The marinade did burn around the chicken, but the chicken seemed to be unscathed, so I'm not sure how to prevent that burning.  Someone else mentioned that too, so I'm interested in any thoughts as well.

I tought this was good, did not think it was great, I think next time I will use more Ranch Dressing, it just diid not have a distinctive flavor for anyone. The broiling caused problems as the leftover marinade broiled first and burned before chicken was done. Any suggestions?

Yup, I really liked this. It was easy, fast and very filling. I ate the entire thing in one night and fixed it again during the weekend.  I wonder what would happen if you used a different dressing mix? And could you grill it?

This was a fantastic recipe!  So easy and quick.  I didn't marinate for the full hour, but I'm sure that if I had, it would have only been better.  We also ended up grilling the chicken and then cutting into slices to use in a salad.  So yum!  Will make again and again. Thanks!

Oh, lord Did I make a boo boo!  I read some reviews that said it was better if you doubled the olive oil and vinegar.  Well...I totally misread the amounts and used OUNCES, not tablespoons!  Boy, is my face red!  But believe it or not....it turned out very well.  After marinating, I discarded the marinade and just grilled the chicken.  My husband and I loved it!  I'm not sure it would have been as good using the small amounts that were stated in the original recipe.  I wound up using 4 ounces olive oil and 2 ounces red wine vinegar for 2 large chicken breasts that I pounded thin.  I could have probably used even another chicken breast--with my mistake, there was plenty of marinade!

I used bone in pork chops. Marinate them for about 5 hours then cooked them on a gas grill. They were the best grilled pork chop I have ever eaten. Very juicy and taste like stake. Me and my family say THANK YOU!!   Sandy Atlanta, Ga.

Sorry, two stars is the best we can offer. It was a very easy dish to prepare however the flavor was very bland. We will not add this one to the rotation.

This was easy, fast, and tasted great. The only reason i'm giving four instead of five stars is that the flavor was a bit overpowering. I used tenderloins instead of whole breasts and that made a difference. Next time I will either reduce the amount of the seasoning or increase the amount of chicken. I also used regular vinegar and it worked fine.

Wanted this recipe to be good but the MSG in the ranch seasoning really bothered my husband and took him over a day to recover.  I suppose it's because the ranch packet is concentrated and in this dish you eat more than the average portion of ranch seasoning.  The recipe was easy enough but I cannot make this again.

I had to go to a meeting and wanted to make something easy.  I didn't have ranch seasoning, so I covered the chicken with a jalepeno ranch dressing that my mother-in-law bought for us.  I let the chicken marinate in the dressing for 2 hours while I was my meeting.  When I got home, I took the chicken out of the dressing, and pressed in bread crumbs.  I baked it at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  It turned out great!  My husband loved it, also!  Thanks for the recipe!

This wasn't bad but DH and I both said we could not tell that it had marinated in anything, no flavor, just chicken. It made such a small amount of marinade, really just enough for 1 breast.

DH said this is the best non-restaurant chicken he's ever had.  The kids and I loved it too.  I made the marinade when the breasts were still frozen and let them sit in it for two days while they defrosted, then DH cooked them on the grill.  It's a light but very flavorful taste, one that we'll be enjoying lots this summer!

This is the best chicken marinade I have ever tried from this site!  My husband and two year old loved it!!! If I had to say anything negative it would be that it is a little salty-but I love salty-so that was perfect for me!  I marinated the chicken with the leftover sauce while I grilled it-I did not broil it-and it turned out perfect and juicy-very flavorful.  I also served it will rice and broccoli.  Perfect!

Pretty Good! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and white vinegar. I only had 21/2 hours to marinate the chicken, but the chicken tasted very flavorful. Easy and great for a weekday menu.

I really like this recipe.  Have made it a couple of times and I keep coming back for more. Couldn't be easier.
