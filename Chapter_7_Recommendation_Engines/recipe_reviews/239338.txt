We really liked this soup.  I didn't have regular sausage so I used Adielles sausage (I sliced very thin). I also used applewood bacon salt in place of regular salt, but everything else was the same (I used Kale).  We were very pleasantly surprised.  Even my husband liked it (and he NEVER likes anything new)!

I did not have kale so I used collard greens. I would like to try it with potato inside of an instant mix. The soup did not look smooth. Very good flavor. Would make it again.

We actually really enjoyed this recipe.  We added twice as much of the sausage as the recipe called for and 4 cups of chard.  It turned out to be quite the comforting dish!  It's even really good as leftovers because it thickens a little more.

I followed the recipe mainly. I added the bacon with the sausage and poured it over pasta.

Loved it! My husband was skeptical about the kale but after trying it, it was just fine for him. I cut back both milk and chicken broth to 4 cups as recommended by another reviewer.  Definitely plan on making it again and again. Delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe! My husband loves it!! I did make a couple changes. Instead the roasted garlic mashed potatoes, I cut and roasted regular and sweet potatoes with garlic and herbs. Next time I’ll just do sweet potatoes, they went perfect with the kale and sausage. Also instead of pepper flakes I added cayenne which added a nice kick. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I didn’t add flour but used a blender to thicken a portion. I will likely use turkey bacon from here on out because I just don’t want the grease. Otherwise I followed the recipe and took it to a fellowship dinner. Everyone loved it!

Easy and tasted delicious. It’s not a copycat recipe for the Olive Garden’s soup, but it does have a similar flavor profile. I will make it again!

This is a delicious, easy soup! I made it with kale and added about a cup of cherry tomatoes, cut in half, towards the end of the cooking time.

Really simple and easy soup with lots of flavor. Everyone loved it.  First time I've ever seen my daughter eat kale!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, making 2 minor changes.  I used pork Italian sausage and a whole onion.  The flavor was on point, but there was just too much broth.  I may make it again, but definitely reduce the milk and chicken stock.
