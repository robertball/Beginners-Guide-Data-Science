I used a bigger I think 11" pan.  I needed extra eggs I used 5 whole & 2 white's only.  Extra garlic & parsley only 1/3 cup of parm as I ran out.  Looks good, smells good, tastes great.  I will stick w/ my changes going forward, this was great & the fiance enjoyed it.  Easy to reheat in the microwave in the morning if you don't have time for this much cooking before work.
Oh and I used the jalapeno sausage by al fresco, it has a pretty good spice bite to it, and adds a nice spice too the whole thing.

Great and easy recipe.  I didn't have the asiago sausage but I added about 1/4 cup to the egg mixure.  It came out great!

We love Frittatas and this one was good. Though I made so many changes to appeal to my husband that it might be a new recipe. I nicknamed it Kicked up al fresco Roasted Pepper and Asiago Chicken Sausage Frittata. I also needed to use up some fresh veggies and potatoes. So I made some hashbrowns, then I roasted a few fresh hatch chili's and a  jalapeno and I sauteed theses with some mushrooms and a bit of onion and garlic. I used the hashbrowns as a crust then layered sausage, mushrooms, chili's, peppers and onions, then I poured egg mixture over the layers. I put shredded gouda and parmesan chees on top. Once bottom was set on the stove. I put it under the broiler and set the top and browned the cheese a bit. This was excellent! Will make this again. I am posting my kicked up version. Check it out.

I served this up to my husband and oldest daughter for breakfast. I had reservations on the recipe. Only for the amount of sausage and egg mixture. I completely followed to a T right down to the size of skillet to use. When mixing the eggs with the other ingredients, I knew I didn't it didn't look to me enough and I was right, however I didn't stray from the recipe at all. I waited until after my husband and daughter finished before saying anything. Both said the same thing I was thinking. And said while it was good with the flavors, they agreed it was to thick with meat and where was the eggs, so to speak. I will make this again. But however use only half a package of Chicken Sausage and chunk the slices into smaller pieces. And keep the rest of the ingredients the same.

Our family really liked this though it did seem a little dry. It could be that our oven runs a little hot. We will also add an extra egg of two next time. As for the sausage, we loved the flavor. This is a definite keeper. Thanks

Very good, but the first time I made it, it was WAY too salty. I reduced the amount of cheese the second time, and it was much better.

Loved it, easy, had everything on hand, we enjoyed for dinner, so the serving size of 6 was really hopeful, maybe for small servings like at a buffet...

The roasted pepper and Asiago cheese gave this a fresh taste. I also added pimentos. Good flavor.

This was just OK.... we all ate every bite but in order to make it again, I'd have to do some things to it.  The sausage is good- don't let the initial smell of it throw you off when you open it. Asiago and roasted pepper are strong tastes and they mellow out once the dish is cooked. The main problem I had was there was not enough egg- we have tiny chickens here so I used 6 to equal the four the recipe called for and I could see immediately it was not going to be enough. Secondly.. this needs some sort of cheese other then Parm. Since it was like a breakfast type dish (though we had it for dinner), I found myself wanting it cheesier and cheese would add additional flavor. The peppers seemed to be a bit of overkill since it was also in the sausage. I used homemade and I don't think I would use them again. Whatever you do, don't leave out the parsley. You can't see it in my photo but it really does add that extra fresh taste this dish delivers.

My store didn’t carry roasted pepper
& Asiago chicken sausage, so I used sweet Italian chicken sausage. I wasn’t sure if my pan was
oven-proof, so after I browned the sausage, I put the mixture into a 10-inch Pyrex pie pan, poured
the egg mixture over the top, and sprinkled with a little shredded Asiago cheese. I baked it in the
oven for 10 minutes. The only change I would make would be to add a couple more eggs and
bake in a 9-inch pie pan. This is a very quick and easy recipe that doesn’t require a lot of time or
ingredients. It came out very good.

This was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite flavor of sausage, but other than that tasty and quick. I have never preset a fritata on the stovetop and finished in the oven before - I liked that method. I did add some mushrooms because I had them, and they were a great addition.

This is a FANTASTIC dish.  It is very quick and easy.  You can make everything in one pan and it tastes great.  I took this as a meal to a family that had recently adopted 2 girls and everyone LOVED it.  The Tabasco was just the right amount that even my "heat sensitive" kids ate every bite and asked for the leftovers the next day.

This came out really good. I increased my eggs to six otherwise made the recipe as written. It came out a little dry for me so I would lessen the cook time somewhat. The sausage was a great flavor. I would definitely make this again! Thanks Al Fresco for a great product.

I loved this one dish meal, I used a cast iron skillet...and it turned out perfect.  I did not add extra roasted red peppers, but I did add in some sautéed baby bella mushrooms and 2 extra eggs since it didn’t seem like enough.  We loved the flavor of the al fresco chicken sausage! This is my second review, and this time I added some browned cubed hash brown potatoes to the bottom of the pan, then poured the egg mixture over the top!  My family loves this breakfast!

5 stars for flavor, delicious! 3 stars for lack of balance. Using all four of the sausages in the 12 oz. package with only four eggs would result in a sausage pie with a wee bit of egg. I used three sausages and 7 eggs and it came out perfect, a nice frittata with more than enough meat. Otherwise I made no changes. Served this for a quick supper with fresh lemon butter asparagus. We all enjoyed this one!

Wonderful! I love frittatas, so I knew this would be great. We were not disappointed! I did add two extra eggs, because the size of my pan was a bit larger than the recipe called for. The result was still chock-full of flavor!

This was really good. I was wary because it didn't call for salt, but the Parmesan cheese added a good amount despite being low sodium. Thanks for the recipe! I'll make this for breakfast again.

It was good but needed less sausage or more egg.  Also used chopped tomatoes instead of the roasted peppers.  A pretty decent quick, easy meal.

This is such a quick breakfast recipe and it was enjoyed by all.  I loved the roasted red peppers, but I think it is flexible enough that other vegetables could be used as well. I'm thinking broccoli in addition to the red peppers!  The chicken sausage is so flavorful and I love that it is fully cooked.  No worrying about getting the meat cooked to the right temperature!

I'm rating this recipe 4 stars as written. The ratio of sausage to egg is off so if you plan to use the entire package of sausage, increase the eggs to at least 6. I also added some chopped mushrooms but followed as written otherwise. It's a great tasting frittata with the correct egg to sausage ratio!

This was excellent!  I couldn't find the Roasted Red Pepper and Asiago sausage, so I used the Sundried Tomato flavor.  I also had to substitute dried parsley (approximately 2 teaspoons) for the fresh flat-leaf parsley.  My entire family loved this and we all wished there had been enough for seconds.  I did only use two links of the sausage and I think any more would have been too much.  We'll definitely have this again in the very near future.

We love frittatas but the next time I make this I will either use ground sausage or cut the slices into smaller pieces.  Even though I cut the slices very thin the sausage flavor overwhelmed the other flavores.

Love chicken sausage and this was perfect for the leftover chicken sausage and peppers that I had made a few nights back. I used 5 eggs, added 1/2 a grated zucchini, some italian seasoning and dried basil, pecorino romano cheese and some low fat mozzarella cheese, omitted the hot sauce. Great way to use up leftovers and an easy dish to make that is very tasty. Thanks!

This was okay. The family ate it but wouldn't care to have it again. Neither the husband or daughter cared for the texture of the chicken sausage.  I don't eat eggs so I can't give a personal opinion.

Very easy and tasty! I was not able to find the Roasted Pepper Asiago Chicken Sausage, so I used the Al Fresco Sundried Tomato Chicken Sausage. I think when I made it again I will only use 1/2 the package of sausage. That would be plenty for us! Thanks for the recipe!

Mine kind of fell apart when I plated it, but it was really good.  I would probably leave out the garlic if I served it for breakfast again-a little too much early in the morning for me.  I did love the ease of preparation, and next time will probably add some cooked sliced or diced potatoes.  Good, not great.

While this is a very simple ad quick recipe to make, my family really does not like this sausage.  I have tried this product several times but its just not for us.  If I was to make this recipe again I would use a sausage my family does enjoy in place of the Al Fresco

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe although I didn't use al fresco sausage since it's not available in my area. I diced chipotle sausage in another brand which worked very well with the red peppers and hot sauce. I used only 3 sausages but should have used only 2 since the egg to sausage ratio seems off a bit. Easily fixable though. Delicious and filling recipe! No salt is called for and none is needed. I also used only 1 tsp. olive oil. I served this with grits and a fruit cup.

I made exactly as the recipe was stated.  We really enjoy the al fresco sausage, but, this was not one of our favorite flavors.  Both my husband and I also thought the ratio of sausage to eggs was off.  For our taste - there was way too much sausage.   It was a good basic frattata, but, nothing special for us. 4/14/12 Just a comment on this. Although, we didn't think this wasn't one of our favorite dishes last night, this morning I heated it in the microwave and broke up a piece in a warmed wheat tortilla with a little hot sauce. It was really good and made a nice portable breakfast wrap for my husband. I have cut a few slices and froze them. Hopefully once they defrost they will taste good. If so, This would be a great to make the frittata, cut it into 6 individual pieces and freeze. Pull a piece it out the night before and you'll have a quick weekday breakfast wrap.

We loved this!  I didn't use the called for sausage (sorry!) but used Trader Joe's Chicken Apple Sausages.  They worked perfectly!  I don't have  a non stick oven proof pan so I sauteed the sausage, garlic and roasted peppers (which I roasted myself) in a pan then transferred to a pie plate and then added the egg/cheese mixture.  I did add 3 extra eggs, 7 total, to fill the pie pan up a decent amount.  Added a little extra parmesan to make up for the extra eggs.  Gave a few twist of the salt shaker as well, but that was just personal preference.  SO good!

This was very good, however, I agree with several other reviewers that it needs more eggs--at least 6, if not more.    I use any flavor of chicken sausage I have, this time, I'm using Trader Joes garlic chicken sausage.
