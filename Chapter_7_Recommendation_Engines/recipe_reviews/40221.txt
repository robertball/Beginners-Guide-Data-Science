I was REALLY disappointed with this recipe.  And it's from Schilling/McCormick -- They should know how to cook!  I feel it was a waste of good spices, shrimp, and my time.  Was not very good or flavorful, and I followed instructions to the letter.  Skip this one and use your ingredients for a better recipe.

this meal turned out to taste something close to watered down noodles and shrimp with no flavor.  I tried to thicken it up and add more seasoning but it dod no good.
