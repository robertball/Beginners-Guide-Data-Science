5 stars for both flavor and simplicity! I was a little skeptical because of the few seasonings, but this is perfect!  I didn't have time to marinate for 8 hours (poor planning on my part), but even with only 30 mins, this was bursting with flavor! Aside from marinating time, I made this exactly as written.  This didn't make very much marinade - there was no extra for me to drain from the meat before cooking, which was fine.  A nice touch with the added basil!  I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper at the end for a bit of color.

The flavor was well balanced and over all it was super easy to make. I wouldn't say it was my favorite meal ever, but I would definitely make it again.
