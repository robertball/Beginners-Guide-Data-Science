I thought this was very good.. I made exactly per the recipe.   A couple of comments - I have a very high speed Ninja blender so I was able to get the raw veggies very small in the drink.. but it never did get completely smooth.  I dont think this would work in a traditional blender.. but YMMV.  I tend to prefer a smoother drink so next time I made this, I will add cooked carrot and beet rather than raw
