I made this recipe for a holiday potluck at work.  I never ate pretzel salad before, so I decided to make it the day prior for the family.  Everyone at home loved it.  So, I made the next batch for the potluck and it was a HIT!  Everyone at work was asking for the recipe.  Even those who said they hated strawberries liked this recipe.  I used an entire 8 oz. tub of whipped topping.  Also, when making the jello, I dissolved the jello in 1/2 c. boiling water.  Then, I added 1 c. of iced water to the jello and then stirred the jello until the ice melted.  It was the perfect temperature to immediately top and refrigerate.  Also, it cut the four hour refrigeration down to about 2 hours.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!!!

I didn't wait long enough for the jello to cool and set. I waited about 10 minutes. If I made this again I'd try waiting 30 minutes at least. Also using twice or triple the amount of cool whip.

I made this for the senior center and it was a winner. Easy to make and tastes wonderful. Let gelatin mixture thicken 30 mins in refrigerator before pouring on filling layer.

I LOVE this salad!! With trial and error, I've gotten the steps down. This is what works for me, make sure you "seal" around the edges of your baking dish with the cream cheese mixture. So when you pour the jello part on, the pretzels won't get soggy. Also, once the cream cheese layer is on make sure it is room temp before pouring the jello part on. Mine jello was still a little hot when I poured it onto the cream cheese part that I had just taking out of the fridge and the hot jello cracked the cream cheese layer and seeped into the pretzels.

This is a great recipe, however when I made it the first time I did not understand the directions clearly and did not let the gelatin mixture cool completely before placing over the cream cheese layer. The entire dish bubbled and mixted together. It did not look the best, but still tasted great.

You can't go wrong with this pretzel salad, everyone loves it. To the reviewer below, you need the 3/4 c. butter so your pretzel crust doesn't stick to the pan. Also, make sure your gelatin mixture isn't too liquidy before you pour over the pretzel crust. Let it thicken more than just 'slightly.'

I love this! the salty crunch of the pretzel crust and the sweet, cream-cheese layer, goes fabulous with the jello strawberry layer. I have made many times and prefer it less sweet, though. I use only 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup sugar, 3oz of sugar-free cherry jello and 3oz box of regular cherry. It's less calories and still tastes great.

Tastes good.  However I can never get the cream cheese layer right.  Once I add the jello, it seeps through to the bottom, and the layers are all innertwined.  I will continue to practice.

My mom has made a variation of this recipe for years and it's always a hit! I took it to Food Day at work and got rave reviews. Plus, leftovers never last long. The only modification I made was to use half a cup of butter in the crust.. three-quarters of a cup just seemed like too much. I think next time I'll use more pretzels for a thicker crust. From one Sarah to another, thanks!

Excellent recipe. I couldn't find mine so looked here. I used regular sugar before and it was great, but the powdered is wonderful too.

Turned out very well.  My changes:  After you mix together the cream cheese and powdered sugar, substitute for the whipped topping: small container of heavy whipping cream (8oz) and an additional 2-3 Tbsp. of powdered sugar.  Whip cream and sugar together until stiff peaks are formed.  Blend this into the cream cheese mixture until smooth.

Note:  I used homemade whipped cream for a topping.  I tried adding a pretzel topping but it was too much...better to use chopped nuts to touch it up if you desire.

Very good.  I tried to healthy it up by using low fat margarine (didn't get crispy) but the end result was still very good.  I did use the Neufchantel cheese and fat-free Cool Whip.  I also didn't have any strawberries so I used a can of no sugar added cherry pie filling.  Very good dessert.  I like the salty with the sweet.

Excellent blend of sweet and salty.  I had no problems with the layers blending.  I did let my strawberries thaw and cut the water down just a bit.  My jello layer was too firm so next time I will add the recommended amount of water.  The crust sweet/salty ratio was perfect.  It got rave reviews at my Mother's Day dinner, even with the firm jello layer!  I did ad another layer of cool whip as another reviewer posted.  I don't think I would like it as well without it.  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this for a pool party and was afraid that the jello part would spoil from the heat, but we kept it in the cooler until ready for desserts... Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I would in the future, use more butter in the pretzel mixture as mine did not stick that well.But it's delicious!

I just made this dessert for Easter, it was easy to put together and looked pretty. I used lowfat cream cheese and whipped topping (that was fine).  The mistake I made was to use sugar-free gelatin, a bad taste between the salty crust and splenda sweeten jello. Next time I will use the good old sugar based gelatin.

This is a favorite at our house.  I use raspberry jello and frozen raspberries because I don't care for frozen strawberries.  This year I got a lot of compliments...more than usual.  This year I had pretzel rods on hand so I got out my food processor to crush these big pretzels.  I crush them to very fine, like graham cracker crumbs.  I think this made the difference this year.  I have also mixed some almonds in with the pretzels in the food processor.

Something is wrong with the measurements. The pretzel layer was fine but the cream cheese layer was way too thin and as someone else noted, the way it’s written it says to let the jello thicken a little bit and pour over. It ran right through to the pretzel layer and was also not enough to cover the cream cheese layer.  Will look for another recipe for this dish.

Good, but a bit too sweet for me.  I will probably try this again but will reduce the powder sugar to 2/3rds cup.

I use some raspberries and some strawberries and I use them frozen and mix with the hot jello then it is cool enough to pour over the cream cheese mixture and I find the salty sweet is great I am asked to make this every time I go anywhere.

A delicious pretzel salad that is different from the others.  The filling uses powdered sugar rather than granulated white sugar.  The middle layer was very creamy using only 1 block of cream cheese and 1 cup of powdered sugar.  I took this to a big family gathering and everyone who tried it, really enjoyed it.  I only came home with 1 scoop left.  I will be making this one again.

I make this quite often. You can also do Mandarin oranges, pineapple and cranberries at Xmas time.

Wonderful recipe, just not user friendly, as it is difficult to deter the proper temperature the jello should be before adding it in.  My jello obviously didn't set long enough (even though, I waited a long time) because it seeped down to the bottom:(

Only thing I would change, use a smaller dish.  This doesn't fill a 9x13.  But the dessert itself is fabulous! It's always a hit!

Awesome!  My aunt used to make this when I was a little girl.  I substituted the strawberry gelatin and frozen strawberries for cherry.  I don't like frozen strawberries.  It was just as delicious!

I am giving this four stars, despite the fact that it looks to be DELICIOUS, because the amount of jello is grossly underestimated.

Unless I did something wrong, in using 3 C frozen strawberries (thawed slightly), they actually froze the jello while it was chilling, and I believe they absorbed some of the jello (I even used 2 boxes!)    The result of my creation was a crummy top layer of strawberries with a bit of jello.

If someone can assist me in perfecting this, I would be VERY HAPPY.

I also used applesauce instead of butter in the crust, used honey wheat pretzels, fat free cream cheese, and sugar free jello.

I hope that this is killer like I remember!

I didn't even have to make you recipe to rate it...I've made this many times before and it is my favorite!  If you haven't tried this before, it is surprisingly great!  I will say I've tried it once with low fat cream cheese/fat free cool whip.  It still tasted very good, but did not hold its form well at all.

I thought this was pretty good, I would probably double the crust recipe, to avoid the jello from sinking into it.

Love the taste of the buttery pretzel bottom. Sweet, salty go great together. Give this a try.

This was pretty good. Reminded me of cheesecake. I think the pretzel crust was too salty and next time I'll use graham cracker. Plus the pretzels were ridiculously hard to crush. The pic of this dish looks great. However, what is on top of the jello layer? I'm guessing whipped cream, but it's not mentioned in the recipe. If I make this again I will double the filling and jello layers as it was just not enough following  the recipe.

This is a wounderful dish for any holiday gathering.  I use Cherry Jello and Frozen cherries instead of strawberry.  My entire family begs me to make this every year.  This year my mother finally decided to try it and ask if she could keep what was left. Which was amazing.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  You can mix it up by adding different fruit (such as bananas) or using a different flavor jello.  I also substituted low fat cream cheese and cool whip for full fat products to make it a little less fattening.

I finally got to try this after everyone kept raving on how good it was & I wasn't impressed. The toppings are extremely good but the pretzel crust was extremely salty. With the crust being so salty, it clashed with the topping. I would love this with something other than pretzels.

This was great -- I made it with gluten free pretzels, and light cream cheese, and it was still amazing!!!  In addition, I was short on frozen strawberries and only used one 8 oz package, instead of 16oz. and it didn't even seem to be lacking... I look forward to trying the recipe with the right amount of berries!

Yummy!!!  This dessert was so good!  Next time, think I'll use a graham cracker crust.
Thanks for the great recipe.
