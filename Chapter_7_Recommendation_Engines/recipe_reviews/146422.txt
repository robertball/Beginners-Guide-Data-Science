SOOOOO Good!  awesome!  wow!  we have been known to make this twice in one week!  we serve it over warm rice and don't even need a side dish.  our one year old loves all the color and eats it up - we served it for her birthday party and it was a big hit.  we kept the hot peppers separate (we use chili peppers since jalape√±os aren't available here) so they can be added to taste.  this is even good up to two days later!

This was an absolutely excellent recipe! My local supermarket did not have red bell peppers so I had to improvise with green bell peppers. Also, I added one can of whole kernel corn because corn and black beans go together like peas and carrots! :)

This was delicious.  I didn't add any salt or pepper.  We will definitely be using this recipe again, very healthy and wonderful flavor combination.

Absolutely Delicious!! A friend made this for me when my son was ill. I was hesitant but the moment I tasted it, I was hooked and asked for the recipe. I've never reviewed anything here but had to pass on my thoughts...it's that good!!

Delicous.  I cut down on the cilantro, however, because I find it too overpowering.  Otherwise, I prepared exactly as the recipe says.

Excellent salad that would go well with many things.  I served it with chicken enchiladas and mexican rice, and that worked really well.  Would be a great pot-luck dish too. This is the sort of side dish that I would plan the rest of the meal around.

I made a couple minor changes and it was delicious!  I added a can of corn, left out the olive oi (NO need), and substituted 1/3 diced red onion for the green onion (thanks to previous reviewers' suggestions).  Be sure to make it at least a few hours in advance so the flavors can meld and a little juice can form.  I served it as a slasa with chips, and then as a salad or condiment for shrimp fajitas.  It was perfect both ways!!!

So, so good! We have eaten this salad as is and eaten on blue corn chips with sour cream. Any way you eat it, this salad is fabulous and very simple to make! We often cut the cilantro.

Fabulous!!  This has become a favorite with my husband.  I use it as a side to pan seared or grilled snapper, talapia or other meaty white fish.  This is what we call Floribean cuisine!  I pair this with a chilled Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and make the Keys version (no bake, no eggs) of Key Lime Pie to go with it. It's next best to being in the islands!!

I made this while on vacation in Florida. It was the perfect dish for the muggy weather, very fresh and light. I ended up chopping the ingredients pretty small, adding corn, and a serving it as a salsa with homemade guacamole. It's the perfect sweetness to balance out the taste of the guac!

Love this recipe! I used reduced sodium black beans and skipped the green onion. Great served over spinach or with shrimp.

This recipe was pretty good, but I would recommend using a little less cilantro and green onion.  Other than that, it was a wonderful compliment to the Mexican lasagna I made.

Great, refreshing salad! Perfect side dish or quick lunch for Spring/Summer!  I added about two cups of whole wheat couscous, and it was perfect!

Very good... though it wasn't a huge hit at the cookout I took it to.  Corn helps.  I thought the quantity of green onions was too high.

This is fantastic.  I use the recipe as stated, but chop everything really fine to treat it like a salsa.  I make it all year round - it provides great flavors in the middle of summer as well as a nice warm kick in winter.  Every time I take it to a party other guests rave and ask for the recipe.  For me, it's a way of making sure there is something healthy to eat at the party, but it makes a terrific presentation and fits right in with the rest of the table.  I pair it with green pepper slices and Xochitl tortilla chips (they are very thin with a flavor that compliments this salsa really well).  It also works well as a side or topper for chicken/pork or does well with a taco.

This dish was everything I wanted it to be. I served it with mexican food as a fresh alternative to refried beans and plated it on top of a small amount of spring greens.   I didn't have fresh cilantro, fresh jalapeno or spring onions, and used cilantro from my spice cabinet, jarred jalapeno and a quarter of a purple onion and it was just fine.  It was not popular with my teenagers, but my husband and I loved it. I can't wait to serve it to company with grilled fish.

Fantastic!  I had an extra mango and looked for an easy recipe to use it in.  REALLY, REALLY good! As another reviewer suggested, I added a can of corn because I was a little short on the 2 cups of mango.  Also used a sweet frying pepper because I didn't have a bell pepper.  Try this!  It won't disappoint!

Just had this tonight at my sister-in-law's.  Great with pork tenderloin, as well as a dip for tortilla chips.
