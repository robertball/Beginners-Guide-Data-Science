Best recipe. Simple and the traditional way of making flan. Tips: Keep your baking dish warm/hot in the oven while you make the flan, so that when you do pour your caramel (melted sugar) into it, the caramel doesn't harden as quickly. When melting sugar, be patient and keep the heat LOW because the sugar may brown too dark. Don't fret if you still have small lumps of sugar in the end.. they will desolve when you bake the flan. As for the flan mixture, blend everything in a blender (adding the condensed milk last because its thicker) for the most effective and fastest way of mixing. Also, personally 3 eggs is not enough for me.. I add 5 (known people that add a lot more)... but the egg  amount depends on YOUR density peference. Good Luck!

For first time flan makers: By no means an I a novice in the kitchen:(just never made caramel before) however, it took 3 tries and several phone calls before I got the caramel right. The recipes do not say that the sugar will go from syrupy to hard and rocky looking and that continued cooking and stirring will return it to the liquid caramel state you are striving for. Not knowing this caused me to toss the first two batches.  Be patient, took almost half an hour. Keep the heat low and keep it moving in the pan.

This is the one.  I've made several flan recipes from this site and others and this recipe is the best. Have made this one several times now, and it is by far the best.  Some hints:  Melt the sugar with a drop or two of lemon juice. Do not stir the sugar while it's melting, just swirl in the pan occasionally. If you are worried about the sugar hardening too fast, heat the pan under hot water until ready to pour in sugar and dry with a towel.  A warm pan will give you a little more time to tilt and coat the bottom before the sugar hardens. When you pour the custard into the sugared pan, pour it through a sieve to strain the mixture (I would recommend this tactic with all custard type dishes). Bake the flan in a water bath...it's not hard to do, and yields much better results. Last, bake this dish a day ahead of time.  Let it sit overnight in the fridge (cover with wrap) before warming the pan's bottom in a warm water bath, then invert to release on a plate. Much of the carmel will have liquified and will run over the flan. Yum!  If there's some hard surgar left in the pan, who cares?

This is the recipe i've always used... but for what here in Mexico we call Chocoflan or Pastel Imposible (in southern mexico.. Impossible Cake)... all you have to do is prepare a chocolate cake mix and pour it over the flan mixture, then bake it on water bath (350 degrees) for 1:20 hours.... I promise you won't regret it :)

This was an awesome recipe!  Easy to make and more wonderful to eat!  If you are worrying about the carmelized sugar hardening too fast, mix all the ingredients first, and then melt the sugar and swirl in the baking dish.  This way, there is no gaps between swirling and pouring your flan  mixture into the dish.  Also, as a slight variatioin, I added 4oz. (half bar) of cream cheese to the recipe - to give it a firmer texture, since you're only using three eggs.  After the flan had cooled completely (about an hour), we could eat it right away instead of torturing ourselves and waiting overnight.  You'll be glad you added the cream cheese!  Serving suggestion - serve with a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream - you can't go wrong!

WOW! Great, restaurant-quality flan that's creamy, rich, and the perfect sweetness. I blended the ingredients in a blender, which eliminated the need to strain the egg mixture, and I used a water-bath to make sure it had a delicate texture. Also, I kept the baking dish I was using over the oven vent to keep it warm, so the caramel didn't harden right away and was easy to spread. I've made this a few times, and it's perfect every time! For an adult variation, replace 2oz. of the evaporated milk with 2oz. of caramel cream liqueur. Yummo!

I liked this flan. It is a bit different than most I've had because of the reduced amounts of eggs. However, it works very well and it was tasty. One thing I wanted to mention.... the caramel/syrup thing seems to give some people problems but it can be done very easily with this short cut I use ALL THE TIME! I took a pyrex measuring glass (the 2 cup capacity one) and added 1/2 c water , then I added the cup of sugar to that water and stirred. Then, I placed it in the microwave and VOILA!!! Depending on the power of your microwave, the time will vary. It will take about 7-10 minutes at high power for the water/sugar mix to turn to caramel. Take a peek to make sure it doesn't get too dark though or it will taste bitter! You want it a medium amber color. DO NOT touch the syrup at any time!! I have a friend that did and the skin on her finger practically came right off and she didn't stop screaming for a while. OK?? BE CAREFUL! If you notice that the syrup hardens when it gets on the pan, don't worry. It will do so!! The important thing is to get it distributed in the pan as good as you can. It will melt again when baking. I always use a water bath and do not cover with foil (or anything else).

I loved this recipe. I decided to use this recipe since it seemed easier than the rest. I followed other suggested suggestions and used 1 extra egg and added cinammon. I also put some vanilla in my sugar after it melted down. I used a water bath by placing it onto a cookie sheet filled with water. I ran out of foil so I placed another cookie sheet upside down on top of the flan. Its's a trick I use whenever I run out of foil and it works great every time. This was my first time making flan and I expected it to be complicated but it was so much easier than it seems. I plan to keep using this recipe.

I joined this site bcuz of this recipe!! I just chose it bcuz I had 2 cups of reg. milk that were about to expire. Changes I made: substituted the evaporated milk for 16oz of reg. milk and added an extra egg and baked for only 30min. FLAN TURNED OUT TO BE MY MOM'S FAVORITED DISH and she loooved this! She ate 3 pieces and the only reason she stopped was bcuz she wanted to leave some for breakfast :)Thank u so much for this recipe! NOTE: the flan was bubbling and making holes in the oven which is why I took it out early...Does anyone know why?

I like that it has less eggs and it takes little ingredients for the flan but it is missing a key ingredient for caramel.   1. Add some WATER! I learned this from foodnetwork, add til it looks like "wet sand."  With plain sugar you're more opt to burn it. 2. Keep stirring, constantly  3.  Take it off the heat the moment it reaches the color you want and have your dish(es) ready because it will harden almost immediately. I use individual glass custard cups. 4.  Sugar likes to recrystallize, as one reviewer noticed, so add a few drops of something acidic.  I always have lemon juice on hand so I use that.  5. Try medium heat, med low is too low.  You can go higher but be careful.  Then for the flan, it is custom to give it a "baño de maria" or "water bath" by inserting your flan dish into a larger dish, and filling the larger dish with hot water that reaches about halfway of your flan dish.  It prevents it from cooking too much.  And last but not least, I learned from experience that you NEED to give flan many hours of refrigeration, preferably overnight.  You need to give the caramel time to re-liquefy, otherwise you'll be like my first flan ever and have hard candy discs! I hope this helps, its truly not difficult with a little advice and a bit of practice.  Happy baking!

OK..let me start by telling you how difficult making the caramel on the stove was. I gave up after 45 minutes. I tried this last night and it failed. I tried it again this morning but changed a few things. 1) Use 2/3 cup of sugar with small amount of water, and a little lemon juice. Place in a pyrex measuring cup. Microwave for 2 minutes, check color...mine was perfect after 4 minutes. 2) While caramel is cooking, place 4 eggs in a blender, use "beat" button, until well blended. Add remaining ingredients.  3) Pour caramel in a DEEP 9" pie plate, which has been sitting in a larger pan with boiled water, keeping pie plate warm. Move caramel around plate until evenly coated. Place back in "bath" water. Pour blended ingredients, slowly, on top of caramel.  Pour boil water until it reaches half way up the plate. Cover, loosely, with foil and place in center of oven, at 350. Bake for 55 minutes. It will come out perfect.  Cool and invert onto a dish, after running a knife around edges.  No problem with sticking. Cover and refrigerate several hours.  Total prep time was around 10 minutes...very easy with microwave and blender!  It turned out to be one of the best flans I've had. YUMMY!!

EXCELLENT recipe. I've tried so many other flan recipes and this one tops them all. I have already made it three times for potlucks and I keep getting asked for the recipe. I can't believe how easy and few ingredients it took to make. My boyfriend asked me to make one for a family dinner and another for himself!!!

decided to try this method instead of my usual and i was very disenchanted. texture is an important factor with flan, & this one just doesn't cut it. it was spongy with a swiss cheese texture that I didn't care for. Looked soggy, saggy on the plate. Mixed up another batch of the same ingredients, but baked it in a water bath and it came out like absolute VELVET. I promise you that you will never bake flan according to this recipe's instructions again once you taste it. Keep the ingredients the same, but DO NOT skip the water bath, and I guarantee you all a slice of heaven!

This was the most down to earth, simple recipe for flan I have ever found. Not to mention, it made the perfect texture. Some suggest adding an extra egg or two (or even more) and that is a good suggestion if you like your flan egg-ey. Adding more and more eggs gets it close and closer to the texture of scrambled eggs, which is good but not always desired. Adding more eggs also helps to set it better and makes it easier to get out of the pan. Personally, I prefer to follow teh recipe exactly, as it gives the most traditional texture and flavor. Also, some advice on the sugar syrup: DO NOT BE AFRAID OF MAKING SUGAR SYRUP. The instructions here are perfect for making the sugar syrup - Just get over the fear, as it is easy (especially once you get used to it). There will always be a few tiny chunks in your sugar syrup. Recommendation here, as others have put it down. Have your pan pre-heated as it will keep the sugar syrup liquid longer while you allow it to spread on teh bottom of the pan. If you do it this way, you shouldn't need a spatula to spread it around. And when you get read to pour your milk and egg mixture, ladle a bit in first, and then pour the rest in, to equalize temperature. After it comes out of the oven, you might have a few "volcanoes," meaning places where the sugar syrup has boiled through. Don't worry about it! Just cool it until it is cold in the fridge, take a knife and scraped the sides and turn it upside down and voila. Perfect flan!

Excellent recipe. My husband loves flan, so I make it frequently. I added the extra egg per many reviewers. I feel this was a mistake and won't be adding it the next time. The easiest way to caramelize your sugar is in the microwave. I'm surprised more people don't use this method. I use 1-cup sugar & 1/4-cup water. Pour into glass pie dish and stir. Microwave, at 2-minute increments. It will eventually caramelize -- just be patient. After the first 4 minutes or so, begin to watch it closely. You may have to stir, gently, with a wooden spoon once or twice to evenly distribute the sugar. My microwave did the job in 7 1/2 minutes. After cooling on the counter, I refrigerated overnight. Unmolded the next day. Beautiful results. Thanks for sharing!

I do not know what happened to this recipe but it was like eating scrambled eggs with caramel sauce.  The first thing is there is not enough directions.  To liquify sugar you DO NOT STIR as it clumps together and then carmelizes.  When it hit my flan dish it turned totally hard.  I read another recipe to only shake the sugar once in a while so I tried that and it turned out beautiful.  Another thing is that the eggs should only be whisked and not beaten and the dish preheated in the oven to warm it so that the sugar does not turn hard before swirling it around.  I was a caterer in another life, so am not just talking off the top of my head.  Be sure to give full and exact directions with all recipes.

i really enjoyed this flan recipe. i've found most flans to be too eggy for my taste, but this one is just right. i also appreciated that you don't cook the custard stovetop and then bake it too. i followed a reviewer's suggestion to combine the ingredients in a blender. then i divided it into ramekins for individual servings. didn't cover with foil. for creamy custards i definitely advise a water bath. i hope you enjoy it as much as i did!

Great flan recipe! I have to admit, this is the 3rd time making it for me and I was able to get it into the oven after 10 minutes of preparation.  I had the most difficult time with the sugar on my past two occasions...first time it had a burnt flavor which i did not like and the second time I couldnt get the sugar to melt into a light golden color, it would just end up too dark.  However, I came across this other reviewer who had used the microwave for melting the sugar and it came out perfect! light golden yellow in 4 minutes!  I just added a few tablespoons of water and a few drops of lemon juice and watched it in my microwave for about 3 or 4 minutes.  As soon as it starts to turn golden color take it out of the microwave because it will continue to cook.  I figured this isnt the traditional way of making caramel but it still tastes the same and soooo much easier!

EXCELLENT FLAN! Tips: Use a Bundt pan (with a hole in the middle). This keeps it from being under cooked in the center and creates a pool in the center area for the wonderful caramelized sugar when you turn it over. Keep your Bundt pan warm on the stove burner or in the oven while you caramelize the sugar, so that when you pour your caramelized sugar into it, the caramel flows easier around the pan.  Use a Bain Marie (water in pan) and place in oven while preheating in a sturdy pan such as a turkey roaster with high sides. Place the prepared flan pan into it being careful water level is not too high to splash into flan pan.  Use a blender to blend the eggs, milks and vanilla before you start on caramelizing.  I added 5 eggs and it is the perfect density! When melting sugar, add a 1/2 tsp or so of lemon juice and swirl often until a golden brown liquid; then quickly pour into warmed Bundt pan and turn from side to side to cover the pan bottom and part way up the sides. My Sicilian Grandparents in their 90's LOVE IT and it is really quite easy once you get the hang of it!

There are several recommendations I would like to make for this recipe. 1.)  LINE your oven with aluminum foil on the bottom.  The sugary sauce leaked out of my pan all over the oven.  About 40 minutes into the recipe it almost seemed to be boiling in the pan! 2.)  This recipe should be cooked in a "bain marie" bath for more "even cooking" and NO sticking to the sides of the pan when inverted would occur. 3.)  One cup of sugar, which you cook down, is way too much for this size flan.  It should be 1/2 Cup at the most.  This will cause the leakage. 4.) ONE hour is way too long for this recipe.  30-40 minutes in a "bain marie" water bath is totally adequate.  Mine stuck along the sides because I followed the recipe.  I had a feeling this would happen!  And it turned brown all over the perimeter.  Not at all like the photo that accompanies the recipe. 5.)  It was the sweetest Flan I have ever eaten.  So if you don't like VERY sweet desserts, do not make this.  The sugar sauce should not dominate the flan but this one does. 6.)  Hint:  Do NOT stir the sugar when cooking it down until it is completely dissolved.  Stirring causes lumps and then you have to cook it longer to get them to melt!  You will risk burning the sauce in this case. 7.)  Use extreme caution when handling the sauce to avoid severely burning yourself. 8.)  Use a DEEP dish pan, not a traditonal 9" pyrex pie plate or it will be a clean up disaster! Good luck from a very experienced cook!  I won't be making this on

Thank you so much for using my picture to represent such amazing recipe!

My family, who prefers lighter, semi-sweet desserts, loves this altered recipe. :)

Filling:

I recommend using 4 eggs with and add 1/4-1/2 cup of milk to the mix. Add the whole can of evaporated milk. Add as much of the condensed milk you want depending on how sweet you want the custard to be, try to keep it light (remember there is going to be sweet caramel on top). I would add about 2/3rds of it.

Caramel:

The 1 cup of sugar for the caramel was a little too much (you'll get a lot of caramel leftovers if you do).
I used about a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar. Once the sugar turns into a golden brown, turn off the heat and very quickly spread it over the bottom of the pan. Make sure it isn't to dark, it may taste a bit burnt that way.

Cooking: 

I steamed the flan instead of baking it in the oven. Steaming the flan is actually much faster and quicker. Tastes just as good :)

Fill a deep pan with 1 inch of water (make sure the casserole dish can fit in it) and be sure the pan can be covered.

The total boiling time of the flan will take about 30-40 minutes. Every 5-10 minutes quickly wipe the lid of the pot to prevent too much water from dripping into the flan.
Around 30 minutes, poke the mixture with a knife to see if it is firm enough. If there still any raw mixture, keep cooking it until the knife comes out clean.

Have fun :)

Excellent!  Truly authentic, traditional flan.  Very light and smooth.  Don't add more eggs, 3 is perfect.  To prevent the caramel sauce from hardening, put the plate in the oven while it's preheating.  Then afterwards, put the pie plate w/caramel sauce in the oven to keep warm while you're beating the egg mixture.  I find 1 cup of sugar makes a little too much caramel, so I only use 3/4 cup - makes plenty.  Definitely cook in a water bath and tastes better after a night in the fridge.  Gives the custard time to set and firm up more.  But taste great the same day too.  Very elegant, easy, quick desert.  Your guests will be impressed. (Much better and authentic than Creamy Caramel Flan -which tastes like cheesecake, and is too thick.)

delicious!  things to keep in mind - heat the pie plate because as soon as i poured in the melted sugar it hardened.  also, no where it mentions making a water bath and that's your best bet with these types of dishes.

Great recipe!  Followed many other suggestions and made changes accordingly.  Made in ramekins instead of a single pie pan.  Used 1 1/2 cup sugar for caramel, needed more for the ramekins.  To give myself more time to pour the caramel, I placed the ramekins into a towel lined roasting pan and added an inch or so of boiling water to warm the ramekin bottoms.  I mixed the flan in the blender, adding the condensed milk last.  Used a total of 5 eggs.  Strained the mixture and poured into ramekins from a measuring cup (too clumsy to pour from the blender!).  Baked in a water bath (added more boiling water till about halfway up ramekin sides), 350 degrees, about an hour.  This mixture makes about 5 1/2 cups total liquid with extra eggs.  I made 8 6oz ramekins, but could have easily made 10.  This is a really great tasting easy recipe.  Give it a try!

I'm Puerto Rican and creamy flan is a staple of my island. Flan should not jiggle and cause the person to chase after it on a plate...lol. This recipe is exactly how I make it. Delicious. THe more eggs you put the more holes and less creamy, thus 3 eggs is perfect. IF you want to make it a Flan de queso (CHeese flan) just add a 4 oz package of cream cheese to the mix, it will make a nice slight creamy cheese taste without compromising the soft creaminess of this flan.

ABSOLUTELY authentic amazing flan. I've read all the reviews and only made one change. Bake this flan in a water bath. (The submitter may have forgotten this small but important detail) This will eliminate the probles of sticking to the dish. Once it's out of the oven and cooled, it will come out very nicely. The taste can be sweet but you can always cut back on the sugar. I am a pastry chef by trade and I will most certainly use this again; a very authentic Spanish taste and wonderful texture. Excellent for the holidays and I'm making it for Thanksgiving potluck. THANKS!!

OK, I'm guilty of going through reviews to find a common theme of changes others have made to come up with the best recipe the first time I make things.  With this recipe, that was a MISTAKE.  I added extra egg, and though still tasty, it had too much of an eggy consistency.  Just not very smooth and creamy.  The second time, I made it EXACTLY as written.  Both kids said it was 10X better.  TIPS: 1) don't freak about the sugar.  I put my stovetop on 4, and just kept it moving as I was doing other stuff in the kitchen.  Don't stir, just bring out your inner chef and move the pot around.  It will get lumpy first, but that is normal. 2) I use a deep dish pie plate. 3) keep the dish in the oven so the caramel won't harden too quick when you pour it in. 4) Use a blender to mix egg, milks, and vanilla. 5) If the dish you use is close to full, be sure to put something under it.  It does swell up, and will make a mess.  I saw no need for the water bath.  6) don't change a thing.  Make this as written!

Loved it. Reminded me of my childhood back in Madrid when abuela had us over for coffee every friday night and served this amazing dessert. Tip for first-time makers of this scrumptious dessert - Be patient when making the chocolate. If you do not wish to make the caramel using the dry method, in which you simply leave it on low heat until it starts to caramelize, do what I did: Put a cup of sugar in a thick-bottomed small pan, and add 3 tbsp. of water to it. Mix everything together until the sugar has completely merged with the water and turn the heat on low. Mix it occasionally until you see the mixture beginning to boil.  Then leave it alone. Don't touch it, don't even look at it. Let it simmer for about 15 minutes and check to see if it has turned into a reddish-coppery mixture. If not, leave it alone until it does. Also, heat up the pan before putting the caramel in it, and for easier spreading, use a brush when spreading the caramel.

While the ingredients may be great, the recipe itself results in a curdled flan.  This really needs to be baked in a water bath.  I've made flan many times, but wanted a simple recipe using sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk.  I was wary of the lack of a water bath in this recipe, but made it anyway.  Once cooled, it came out curdled and chunky - not smooth and creamy as flan should be.

So good I almost passed out in the kitchen! I changed a few things to ensure perfection though. With the aluminum foil cover, I poked about 20 toothpick holes in it so that it will properly bake all the way through. Then after letting it cool on the counter for 20 mins., I shifted it to the freezer for 30 mins. Then I moved it to the refridgerator for an overnight sleep. All this was to guarantee its firmness. Next day, I inverted it and it was soo beautiful and I was so proud, I divided it up for 5 girlfriends and watched them jump up and down, screaming how good it was! Thank you!!

This is just an option that I use sometimes when I prefer a less "eggy" tasting flan - instead of 3 whole eggs, I'll use 5 egg yolks.  It makes the flan more smooth and creamy.

I was just like many others - afraid of messing up a flan. But I tried this recipe because it was simple and straight to the point. It came out delicious! I was so impressed and so was my husband. I followed the advice of other reviewers, made it with 4 eggs so it can be more dense, used a water bath and kept the pan in the oven so when I pour the caramel it will give me time to spread it before it hardens....perfect!!  I have also made it without the water bath and it does not come out the same. The flan broke up in the pie pan, but still tasted good. There is now a product that is a caramel sauce made especially for flans, so you wont have to make the caramel yourself. They have it around the evaporated and condensed milk in the supermarket. I made a flan with this sauce, but if time allows, I prefer to make the caramel myself.

Yep, this is the original recipe my family has used forever. The only thing is that when making the caramel, I also add 1/4 cup of water to the sugar and make sure that I keep the sides of the pan moist by dipping a brush into a bit of water avoiding the crystalization of the sugar and the evaporization of it. You'll also get a lot of caramel this way. And the covering isn't really necessary. I've been making flan this way for 20 years. It is so creamy and EVERYONE loves it!!!

I have died and gone to flan heaven. OH MY GOODNESS! Esta flan esta' magnifica, y perfecta! 
I think a previous reviewer who claimed it was not sweet, must have omitted the sweetened condensed milk and used two cans of evaporated instead. I followed the recipe as is, but took the advice of some reviewers in that I added 1 more egg, and a dash of coffee extract along with the vanilla. I baked it in a water bath at 340 degrees (my compromise for the suggested times of 325 or 350) for one hour covered loosely with aluminum foil that had holes poked in it. I then turned off the oven and opened the door a crack, leaving it in there for an additional half hour. Then I let it sit at room temp for an hour and a half and then I put it in the fridge. 

The most labor intensive part was the sugar carmelization. WORD OF CAUTION: Be really careful stirring the sugar when it starts to liquify.... I splashed some on my hand and sugar burns are nasty. 

I also whipped all the flan ingredients together in my blender on low speed, and I strained it when I poured it into the dish, but I see no reason to do that, nothing remained in the strainer.  

Anyhow, this morning I awoke to the MOST magnificent spanish flan I have ever tasted and I brought some in for my coworkers who are mexican and they are now declaring me "La Reina de Flan" or the "Queen of Flan."  I would give this 10 stars for taste if I could... and I would still give it 5 stars for preparation... even though it is a lot of work...

Delicious and so easy!  I used the microwave method to make caramelize the sugar that another reviewer suggested.  It was easy, but you definately need to check it closesly toward the end...
" pyrex measuring glass (the 2 cup capacity one) and added 1/2 c water , then I added the cup of sugar to that water and stirred. Then, I placed it in the microwave and VOILA!!! Depending on the power of your microwave, the time will vary. It will take about 7-10 minutes at high power for the water/sugar mix to turn to caramel. Take a peek to make sure it doesn't get too dark though or it will taste bitter! You want it a medium amber color."

I "tried" to make this flan recipe last night. What a disaster! The fluid keep boiling out of the baking dishe and went all over the oven, causing a temporary fire and a smokey kitchen!  At least bake over a cookie sheet, but that was still not enough to help the overflow of oozing.  My sister is married to a Brazilian and told me that any Brazilian she saw make it baked it in a "steam bath" You place the flan dish inside another large baking dish filled with water and then covered it with another pan.  Obviously a standard 9in round glass baking dish was too small.  When I poured in the batter, it filled it to the very, very top.

I absolutely love flan and have tried many different versions from various reputable restaurants all over the world, including my hometown NYC. This version is just as good if not better than the ones I've had! I would highly recommend it for its ease of cooking. The only thing I did differently is mix the egg and milk in a blender and cook the flan in a water bath just like others have recommended. In the future, I may also reduce the sugar because the caramel seems a bit sweet for my taste. Otherwise, the recipe is GREAT as is. Thanks for posting!

This is just the way my bride of thirteen years makes Flan, except she bakes it in a Flan Pan, (that you can get at most Florida markets,) and she bakes it in a pressure cooker for twenty minutes. Perfect every time! She says that using a whisk to mix the ingredients works better than using a blender because you are supposed to be "gentle" with this little bit of heaven.

So Good!! My son is in town for a couple of days and requested this (his favorite dessert.) I have learned over the years to cook the sugar over low/med-low heat and swirl the pan a little - not to stir and it works great every time. Once the color begins to turn light brown - watch it very closely, it can go too far quickly. The foil did stick a little but no problem because after flipping, you will never notice it.  Followed the recipe and thought the texture and flavor was perfect. I know this will be requested again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I've made flan several times and this was delicious and easy.  My only complaint was for those who never made a flan before you must bake the flan in a water bath.  This was left out of the recipe (very Important)!!!  Also, I've made the caramel by melting the sugar in the microwave, 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon water.  Mix water into the sugar mixture and microwave for approx. 5-6 min. It should be a copper color - don't let it burn.  And, you must immediately pour the caramel mixture into the pan as is hardens very quickly.  Otherwise, this was a delicious flan.

For simplicity this recipe deserves five stars... however, the taste was average and hence my three star rating.  I believe the best way to make flan is from scratch using egg yolks, heavy cream, and sugar.  If you're looking for a simple and quick flan recipe - go for this one.  But if you're a fan of a rich flavor, this one lacks it.  TIP:  It is better to cook the flan in a water bath than directly in a dish placed in the oven... place the baking dish inside a large roasting pan - line with a dish towel, fill with water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the baking dish - cook for same length of time.  This helps prevent the flan from curdling and the caramel sauce from hardening.

This came out great on the second try, but the caramel was a lot harder than it sounds. I finally got it right on my sixth try.  Cooking slow over med-low heat the sugar was crystalizing on me bad every time no matter what I did. I googled and found a video from Alton Brown for caramel where he uses clear corn syrup and a Cream of Tartar to stop the crystalizing. Adjusted for this recipe it is 1C sugar, 1/2C water, 1/2 Tbs. corn syrup, and 1/8 tsp Cream of Tartar.   Use a wooden spoon to blend everything at first but after it starts bubbling, NO STIRRING.  Cook over medium heat and watch for the color you want.  It came out perfect the first time I used that technique. On the flan, the one hour time came out good, maybe even a bit long for a really creamy flan.

This was my first attempt to make flan, and it could not have been easier or turned out more perfect.  I followed the instructions almost exactly but did take advice from other reviews.  Here are the tips that worked for me:

1) I prepared my caramel in the microwave using the "wet" method by adding a 1/2 cup of water to the sugar in a pyrex measuring cup.  It was ready in about 8 minutes on high, but did need to watched carefully. I started with 5 minutes and went up by 1-minute increments from there.  I noticed that the caramel continued to darken after being removed from the microwave, literally while I was pouring it into my pan.  I think another few seconds would have ruined it.

2) I poured and swirled my caramel in the pan immediately after removing from the microwave.  This is crucial as it did harden very quickly.  If there's any real skill involved in preparing this recipe correctly, this is it.

3) I prepared my custard in a blender so it was super smooth, and baked in a water bath rising halfway up the sides of my pan.  1 hour was not long enough for me as the custard was still completely liquid in the center.   I ended up baking 20 minutes longer until the center was set but very jiggly.

The results were amazing.  I brought the flan to a party and other guests raved.  The custard was silken and the caramel was molten and luscious.  I wouldn't bother to try any other recipes.  This is it.

It's a super easy recipe to follow. The only thing I would change about it is the amount of sugar that gets caramelized. I thought 1 cup of sugar was waaaay to much so I lessened it to 1/4 cup and it was perfect! Also, I've always had the worst luck with caramelizing the sugar on the stove. What I do instead is put the 1/4 cup of sugar, in my round pan, in the oven for about 30-40 min at 360 degrees. Just keep an eye out for it so it doesn't over caramelize and burn.. but it's a no fuss, no mess way for sugar to melt and caramelize. Once you see it all caramelize and become amber, take it out and pour your flan mixture in and follow the rest of the recipe as listed. Best of luck to all you flan-makers!

This was my first time cooking flan ever. The ingredients in this recipe are perfect. I added 1/4 tsp of almond extract to infuse the flavor. The only MUST is to cook this in a warm water bath like others have said. Place your dish inside of a roasting pan, fill with HOT tap water to half way up the side of the dish. This made the flan velvety smooth with NO cracks. I'm not sure if this was the reason, but my cooking time was 2 hours, not 60 min. I also did as others recommend, to pre-heat the dish so that the caramel can smoothly cover the dish when you pour it in. This dish was a big hit and was completely gone at the end of the party. Will definitely make again!

Delicious and easy! I used a bit of lemon juice in the sugar to help it melt faster, and an extra egg in the custard for firmer texture. Thanks so much!

The ingredients are fine, but following instructions as written resulted in a disastrous end product.  If you have to use the comments to alter the recipe heavily just to make a workable, edible end result, then I consider that recipe a failure.  DO NOT try this one without the water bath!  Also recommend using a dish that's substantially deeper than you think you'll need, else you risk the foil sticking to the top.

This was really delicious and easy to make.  It is not what I am used to from flan, what I usually get at the Spanish bakeries is more dense.  But this is quite delicious.  Smooth and creamy.  I used 5 eggs, mixed it all in my blender.  I heated my pan in the oven for a few minutes before pouring the melted sugar in.  I didn't have any problems melting the sugar, just stood over it and stirred until it melted.  Somehow my pie pan cracked when I poured in the sugar.  Also I baked it for 60 minutes in a water bath but the middle was still quite jiggly and I wasn't sure if it was done--did some research and flan should be jiggly in the middle.

Served this at an authentic Mexican dinner, and all the guests (10) raved about it. The guests of honor (both Mexican)  said it was fabulous, and they were transported back to their childhood!

Worst part was melting the sugar for the caramel. Use a big, wide fryingpan instead of a saucepan - it is easier to melt and swirl the sugar-caramel. It took me 3 goes to get it right, but was worth the effort. Keep your flan dish warm in the oven and pour hot caramel into warm dish for best caramel coverge.

Definitely cook in a warm water bath, but mine cooked quicker than I thought it would (about 45 minutes). The guests loved both the taste and the texture, and none was left over. Definitely a keeper!

Finally found a flan recipe that my husband loves.  He said it's better than his mom's and better than most people's he had tasted.  If I'm going to make regular flan, this is it.  The firt time I made it, I used water bath and used 4 eggs.  The second time, I used 4 eggs but baked it as recipe suggested and it did't come out as smooth and it was flat.  Will never bake flan without water bath again.

This was my first time making Flan after having successfully made creme brulee.  I'm giving this 1 star because the end result had absolutely no flavor.    Then, I realized why:  The custard has no sugar in it.  If you want to make this, add more sugar because one can of sweetened condensed milk isn't enough.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did differently is that I added a teaspoon of Instant Coffee to give this dish a bit more flavor and depth. I get rave reviews on that one addition every time. I also used a water bath because the flan turns out so much better. And you have to let this sit in the fridge overnight otherwise the carmelized sugar won't liquify well. Hope this helps.

This is the best flan I've ever had and it's very easy to make. I did adjust how to make the caramel and my technique is fool proof. In a sauce pan, I add 1/2  cup of water to 1 1/4 cups of sugar, and stir to saturate the sugar completely. Put the spoon away because you won't use it again. Next I cover the pan with a lid and turn the heat on to medium low. The steam created inside the covered pan prevents the sugar from crystallizing. There is no need to stir. Just leave the pot covered, checking periodically. When it is completely liquified and at a rolling boil, uncover and continue to cook until it has reached your desired color. Remove from heat a pour into your baking dish. It is the easiest way to make caramel, and you can't screw it up. Also, I use a mesh strainer and cheese cloth when I pour the custard into the baking dish to make the flan smooth and creamy.

You don't need three eggs - you only need two.  Sometimes even one will do, if it's large enough.  The eggs are there to hold it together, nothing else.  Either in the oven or on the stove, you need to set up a steam bath (double boiler) for it, to keep it moist and from cracking.  It will set better.  30-45 minutes cooking is all you need - definitely not 60 minutes. Too much egg and overcooking will make it taste exactly like that - overcooked eggs instead of creamy flan.

Noticed in other reviews some are adding the 1 cup of sugar to the flan mixture, then saying it's too sweet. This is not what the recipe calls for, the sugar is to make the carmel, not go in the mixture.

I loved this recipe! My recipe is more complex than this one but this one is nice and simple and has a nice flavor. If you've never made flan or caramel before here are some tips: 1. The more eggs the more dense it will be, so for a creamier texture stick to the 3 the recipe suggests. Many Puerto Ricans never use less than 6 eggs! 2. Add a bit of fresh squeezed lemon juice to the sugar to keep it nice and smooth. 3. Caramel hardens FAST. Do not put it in an ice bath to cool! It will cool as soon as you start pouring it so work quickly, but if it hardens before you can swirl it around the baking dish, don't worry it will melt in the oven. 4. Water Bath isn't 100% needed, however, using one makes for better texture and even cooking! 5. If you never made caramel before, it's ok to stir but don't overdo it, otherwise it will get grainy. Just stir it lightly as it melts to ensure even cooking, and ALWAYS use a wooden spoon or risk melting your rubber spatula! Sugar reaches high temps and becomes extremely HOT and you can easily burn yourself! My first caramel war wound came from trying to "taste test" the sugar with a  dip of my fingertip! lol :) Thanks for this recipe! This is my new at home recipe now!

oh man, this was tricky for me. Here are a few of my notes: Melting the sugar in a med sauce pan takes about 30 minutes. Do not use a small pan- use med/large pan. Keep it on med-low heat, do not stir, only swirl pan. I added one extra egg. I used a blender to mix eggs/milk/vanilla. I kept the pie plate warm as advised. But even with the dish warm-carmeled sugar would not spread easily in the dish. It set up quickly.  When it came out of the oven I realized the carmel topping coats the top (bottom) as it bakes, so no biggie. I baked it in my 9.5" glass pie plate. I let it cool for over 2 hours, it didn't come out easily. I had to place a knife around the edges, it was very sticky.  I did not use a water bath. It took 60 minutes to cook, the color looked beautiful. The texture was not smooth like it should be, but the flavor was awesome. I could eat most of it right now if my son wasnt eating it up! He loves it.

I really wanted this recipe to work. All the great reviews and I can't figure out what i'm doing wrong. This recipe curdled on me not once, but twice. The first time I did as the author said, and did not do a water bath. The second time I did use a water bath, and it still curdled.

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  The only change I made was that I used a blender to mix the custard ingredients and I baked it in a water bath.  Others I served it to thought it was great.  I thought the sugar tasted a little burned.  I will try this recipe again to see if it was my mistake.

This flan was great, but a lot of work. I would do it again, but only if I had the time and energy, and maybe if I had company over. When my mom's mexican friends ate the flan though, they said that it tasted authentic-- so my work paid off? The reason I gave the recipe four stars though, was because it was only after I looked through a lot of reviews that I came up with the perfect [or near perfect] recipe. You can find one I typed up that's a variation of this, but just uses all the advice at http://engineeringllama.blogspot.com/2008/04/full-revised-spanish-flan-recipe.html

This recipe is so delicious.  Easy to prep and make.  At every function I'm asked to bring the Flan.  Flan is thicker and creamer, not eggy tasting and watery like some other recipes.  A trick I do to flip flan over is to place the baking dish in warm water to loosen up the caramel and flip it over.

Perfect flan!! I also made the Creamy Caramel Flan but that was way too thick for me.  It was more like cheese cake then flan. This was more light and fluffy and exactly what I was looking for.  Next time I will try to use low fat evaporated milk or low fat sweetened condensed milk and see if that takes anything away from it. It was great...very highly recommended if you want something similar to true mexican flan.

I made this for a going away party for a girl at work. She said it was her favorite dessert and it looked tasty and fun to make. Don't let the short list of ingredients fool you! The ingredients are very easy to put together, but there are several tricky spots that warrant special attention:

1) Have the pan with melting sugar set to medium low, not just low, otherwise it will take forever.
2) Do not overcook the caramel! Once it starts to brown, make sure you take it off the burner BEFORE it gets to be too dark, it should be a golden amber, NOT dark brown color. I overcooked it somewhat, and it tasted a little bitter in the end, but that could have been easily avoided.
3) Do not stir the sugar mixture, it will crystalize! Just swirl in pot every 3-4 mins.
4) I agree with many other posters - adding more than 3 eggs is a good idea. It will make the custard more jiggly, and not as hard. I added 4 rather than 3 as the recipe calls for, but could easily see myself adding 5 or 6, just didn't want to risk it since it was my first time making flan.
5) Tip from my friend - if you don't like the taste of eggs, squirt some lime juice into the mixture, this will neutralize the egg flavor.
6) Preheat the baking pan in the oven before pouring the caramel mixture. I preheated mine in a larger pan filled with water.
7) Don't confuse dry milk and evaporated milk when shopping!  
All in all, this turned out pretty well and I got plenty of compliments, just wish I didn't overcook the caramel!

Made my caramel in the microwave as suggested by another reviewer.    1/2 cup of water, 3/4 cup sugar in pyrex measuring cup and microwave 7-10 minutes.  Watch closely after 5 minutes to make sure it reached golden brown color and not too dark.  Flan was mixed in blender.  It is much too sweet with the  1 cup of sugar.  I will mke it make it next time with just a 1/4 cup or none at all.

Put baking pan in another baking pan filled halfway with boiling water.  Poured in caramel into warm pan without any trouble.  Bake for an hour in hot water bath.

Even though it's extra sweet, it hasn't prevented me from eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

This was a difficult recipe since I'd never made flan before. I think I cooked the sugar too long & it made an awful mess PLUS you MUST immediately clean that pan or the sugar will harden & be hard to get out of the pan. Also, it said to cook for 60 mins, which I did. When I went to remove the pan from the oven (in a water bath as suggeste by other reviewers), the flan was totally liquid still so I thought maybe I did something wrong & cooked it longer without the water bath. Then the melted sugar came up thru the center of the flan. Could someone tell me if it is supposed to be liquidy after 60 mins? Would love the input. Thx!

Love this recipe. It is actually better than my mom's recipe. I followed the directions exactly. I think next time I'll use an 8" pan, instead of a 9" pan, to make it thicker. It is creamy, not too sweet, and luscious. Our family's new favorite dessert.

It came out perfect and easy.  I used 3/4 can of condensed milk, still a bit too sweet, next time I will only use 1/2 a can.  When you melt the sugar, just watch it closely.. medium heat, turn heat off when you see it medium brown, it will continue to brown a little more.  You must bake in a water bath to get it smooth!  I also think baking for 60 mins makes it too firm, I like it a little softer, best bake at 50 mins.

I used this recipe to make flan for the first time, and it turned out amazing.  I used the addition of 4 oz cream cheese and an additional egg because I needed it for a dinner party the same evening. I heated the pan before pouring the melted sugar into it, and blended  the remaining ingrediants in a blender.   Turned out incredible.  Everyone LOVED it.

Made this today for the 4th of July -- Delicious!!!!  Rather than adding vanilla extract I used Orange Liqueur also added a bit of Orange Liqueur with the sugar when I made it into a caramel.  This recipe was so easy to make that your kids could do it (with the exception of the carmeled sugar an adult would need to do that part.)  It taste like the Mexican restaurants Flan they serve with these little changes.  :)  DELICIOUS!!!

The flavor of this recipe was good.  I found the instructions to be lacking.  In my attempt to make the caramel I found it impossible to get the sugar to change color at the medium-low heat... or medium... or even medium-high heat.  My arm was tired after stirring for well over 20 minutes with no advancement of the color of the mixture.  I tried adding a little water but this steamed off quickly.  When I changed the heat to HIGH that's when, finally, it started changing to the classic caramel color and smell.  I find it difficult to believe that medium-low heat can produce anything golden in color.  Another problem I saw was the necessity to cool the resulting flan without solidifying the caramel that's now in the bottom of the dish(es).  I have yet to solve this mystery but will continue to research for the proper method.  If the caramel is too much like candy then it solidifies during the cooling step.  It would be nice to have a target temperature for the caramel itself and to use a cooking thermometer at this step.--------- Update: Here is a better way to make the caramel. Combine: 2/3c. sugar; 2Tbl water; 1Tbl light corn syrup; 1/8tsp lemon juice... in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring only until sugar dissolves.  When sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to medium-high and cook without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing sides with wet pastry brush, swirling pan, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.

Great and easy recipe! I used 4 large eggs instead of 3, after reading a few reviews. The sugar took a while to melt and will turn clumpy before turning liquid.  I baked my flan in 6 warm ramekins (7 Oz ramekins) and put them in a water bath. I did not use all the caramel, and saved some to make simple sugar art to decorate this delicious flan!

Flan has been my FAVORITE dessert since I was a little girl, so I have had many in my lifetime.  This one did not disappoint.  In fact, it was fabulous.  Very traditional taste.  I did add an extra egg to the recipe and baked in a water bath.  I am definitely not a chef and this was my first time making a flan, but it turned out beautifully and tasted even better.  Try this if you are a flan lover.

I've never made a flan before and know how finicky it can be.  We were having a church social with a Mexican theme dinner and decided to give it a try.  I looked at all the flan recipes on this website and decided to try this one out.  It was SUPER easy and worked like a charm!!  I had read several of the reviews and made the following changes:  1) I used 5 eggs.  2)  I used only 2/3 - 3/4 of the can of condensed milk.  3)  I added a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I didn't measure it out, just shook a bit in.  4)  I just used a hand mixer to mix it up real good.  5)  I put my glass pie pan in the oven @ 350 for 5-7 or so minutes to warm it up for easier spreading of the melted sugar.  I rolled the pie pan around and coated the sides good, let it sit for about 1 minute and then rolled it again for a second layer.  I let it sit for a few minutes (3-5 maybe ???) so the caramel was starting to set and then poured the egg-milk mixture in.  I covered the pie pan with slightly vented foil.  I did use a water bath - I used my turkey roaster and put a kitchen towel in the bottom and poured very hot water on top just enough to soak the towel.  I then set the roaster on the oven rack (used middle rack), set the flan inside the roaster, and poured in more of the very hot water until about halfway up the sides of the pie pan and then I baked it at 350.  I found mine didn't seem set until 70-75 minutes of baking.  I pulled it out and set the pie pan in the fridge for about an hour, in

This recipe made me a happy man - Been sampling flans in American   restaurant  trying to find a match for those I consumed while living in Europe.  Biggest complaint about Stateside flan is the cloyingly sweet caramel universally served.  Granted, this is personal taste but, I find that taking the caramel to a very dark brown at just the point where you get just a touch of bitterness produces a much more complementary sauce.

Here's some things I learned the hard way while making this recipe:

1.  Use the "wet" method of caramelizing.
2.  Pre-heat the mold that you are going to bake the flan in- about 5 minutes in a 300degree F oven - will increase the time the caramel is fluid enough to ensure coating the mold as desired.
3.  The best way to remove hardened sugar caramel is to simply let it soak in water.
4.  One reviewer mentioned all the caramel stayed in the mold - had the same experience but found that if you give the flan a couple of hours in the mold to soften up the caramel and wait 15 minutes after removing flan from fridge before removing from mold you will get the max pretty brown cap on the flan and a nice quantity of syrup in the serving dish. 
5.  I opted to use 6 (about 6 Oz size) ramekins with about 5 oz of batter in each. 
Wifw says it's the best flan she has ever had, I agree -

The best flan recipe I've tried from this site. Like other reviewers, I bake in a water bath. Also, I mix 1/4 cup water with the cup of sugar. This makes it easier and faster to melt it.

The texture is a little too dense for my family, but the taste is great. I think the recipe is good, I probably overcooked it. 
I definitely suggest using a water bath for this dessert since I baked two, one with waterbath, one without, and the one baked in water came out silky smooth. When using a water bath, be sure to cover ramekins loosely so the steam can go in. Never cover the cup too tight. Trust me, I learnt it the hard way.

This is a great recipe for flan and it is very simple. I have never made flan before and my husband always raved about his mothers, so I decided to give this one a try. I looked at all the other recipes on this site and decided on this one because of the simple ingredients and I found out that traditional flan is a very simple dessert. I tried using an 4 eggs first, but I found it too thick for my taste. I made it again with just the 3 eggs and it is perfect. I did however use a blender to mix everything together and I used a water bath to bake it. This recipe is a keeper.

Muchas gracias, Adriana.  When my expert-flan-maker friend tried it and I told her it was just popped into the oven with no water bath, she was appalled!  She called me a heretic and refused to believe me!  Maybe it turns out well with a "baño maria" but if it turns out this well without one, why bother??  Before this, I had some disastrous attempts at caramelizing sugar, but what works for me now is to use a non-stick saucepan, cook over medium-low heat, and pay close attention. It's done when it's all foamy boiling but you can tell that the liquid is translucent, not cloudy.  I've served this flan to my Mexican students many times and they love it.  Thanks again!

I was volunteered by my 9-year old to make  dessert for their Cinco de Mayo festival this year. I thought it would be fun to make something traditional, so I made this recipe this morning as a sample test. *grin* (aka: I get to eat this one!) 

Man oh man, Is this yummmmmmy. 

I didn't think the sugar would ever melt, but be patient and remember, don't stir it! Just swirl it in the pan every now and then.

Very good!  I use four eggs and it comes out perfect.  To make the caramel easy, I microwave one cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of water for about 10 minutes.  This is my hubbys favorite flan.  - Brandy A :-)

I tried this recipe three times in one night.  The first flan blew up in my oven. After my husband cleaned the oven, I started over, but this time the flan caught fire. After my husband came again to my rescue by extinguishing the fire, I made one last flan. It's currently on life support and not expected to make it. My house now reeks of burned flan and my kids are packing their stuffed animals for a quick escape thinking that I'm going to burn the house down. I'm sure this is a great recipe but I failed miserably trying to make it. Good luck to the rest of you! I'm giving it four stars because my horrific cooking skills should not be a factor in rating it.

Excellent and simple.  I get this done in under 1/2 hour.  1)place everything in a blender and blend. 2) melt the sugar at the same time.  3) Find a bowl that would bit in a pressure cooker or a pan called flanela (that has sealed locks) 4) I dump the caramel (I like it burnt cuz it gives a bitterish taste) into the dish, then immediately add the content of the blender.  

Heat up the pressure cooker until it is at full regulated setting.  Let it go for 15-20 minutes.  Turn off and let it cool down by itself.  Walk away to do laundry or get ready to go to that pot luck party.

Come back, take out pan, run the knife along the edges, invert it.  It is best if you can refrigerate a little to harden while consuming dinner.  Made it 10 times in 2 months to all dinner parties and never failed; so far.

I loved how simple this recipe was. I added two extra egg yolks leftover from another recipe, a sprinkle of cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg. The results were wonderful! 

May try to use the microwave caramel next time, as sugar took forever to melt!

love this easy recipe and it only uses 3 eggs! but instead of covering it with foil while baking, i put my dish in a water bath uncovered for an hour. i would suggest to use 1/2 cup sugar instead and add like a tablespoon of water to the syrup. this process takes really long so be patient! let it cool then enjoy!

This is a simple yummy recipe. The caramel is not difficult to make you just have to be patient. For those of you who preffers a less sweet caramel you can add a couple of drops of fresh lemon juice. Also if the thicknes of the sweet condense milk and the evaporate milk is too much for your palad you can use one can of consense milk, use the same can to  fiil it up with regular whole milk and omit the evaporate milk. It will give you a less dense ligther flan. If vanilla is not available use a couple of cardamon seed to avoid the "eggy" taste.  This is a simple, traditional and excellent recipe. Thanks Asoto!

This recipe turned out perfect. I made it for my mother in law who loves flan and she loved me for it :). Making the caramel was not difficult at all. I kept the pan in the over while it was preheating so that it was hot and that gave me enough time to coat the whole thing with the caramel. It only took about 10 minutes for the sugar to melt, the key is to melt it in hot heat and not stir until it's done. It takes a few minutes to start melting but just leave it alone. Be careful it's extremely hot and dangerous when pouring. I did bake it in bano maria (water bath) for 60 minutes. I placed the roasting pan with the water in the oven while it was preheating so by the time the mixture was done the water was hot.  I covered it foil and that was it. Perfect flan

This is a good recipe. My grandma used to do it with 4 eggs and added a whole package of cream cheese. The cheese flan version is the same recipe but you have to mix the cheese in. So the cheese wont clump mix it first (i melt it real good with 1 min in the microwave) and then add the rest of the ingredients. Cook time is the same. You can use a round or squared 9' glass pan. When baking I suggest doing "baño de maria" which is placing the glass dish in a another dish that has water in it. That makes the flan cook better and not burn in the bottom. Happy Cooking guys!

I perhaps have a smaller/thinner than usual flan pan (I ran out and bought it before making this).  60 minutes was too long to bake.  I had the caramel overflowing and burning on the oven bottom (setting off smoke detectors).  I should have watched it after 35-40 minutes.  I will be trying it again this afternoon.

Oh my gosh! This is great! Mine did not come out looking quite as pretty as some of the other pictures but it tastes incredible. When they say that the sugar syrup dries fast it does! Literally in just a few seconds so follow the advice of others and put the pan in the oven for a few minutes so it is warm and the syrup will spread better.

Wow - Great flan. we have always wondered how flan is made and assumed it was a difficult process. We were wrong and this is a great recipe. Add more eggs for a stiffer flan, less egg for a creamier flan. Either way, this was just plain excellent !

I love this recipe. It's the one I used to make as a child except that I used to make it in a water bath in a pressure cooker. The flavor is great but the texture was not as I remember it. This one came out very porous and not as thick and creamy as I remember it. I think next time I will try adding another egg. 
I like the fact that this recipe didn't call for the water bath.
But I will only use half the amount of sugar. I did heat up the glass pie dish with water in the microwave to have it hot so the sugar didn't harden right away.

gahhh. this turned out terrible but due to own fault. Was in a bit of a rush and forgot to cover with aluminium foil, thus ending up with a burnt Yorkshire pudding-like thing that was v.hard. Do not forget the aluminium foil!!

I think this recipe is awsome!!! I've never made this before and I've always thought it was complicated. I saw the recipe and thought I'd give it a shot. Yum! Just like Mexico! My husband who is from the capital of Mexico loved it. So much in fact that he ate more than half by himself! I warmed up the baking pan in a water bath before pouring the melted sugar and I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and baked it in a water bath. I cooked it for 60 minutes the 1st time and it never did completely set, so I added 5 more minutes the 2nd and it was perfect.

Used this to serve to my daughters 6th grade classmates as part of her presentation for a social studies project on Spain.  Followed directions to a tee.  No problemo.  A little messy but very tasty.  Was not bland in the least.  All the kids loved it including the teacher!

This recipe was very simple to make. The flavor was so delicious and the texture was just right. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a tiny amount of water to the sugar, which made it easier to melt and carmelize. I also strained the custard before I put it in the oven. The caramel didn't disolve completely when the flan was finished baking, but that could have been because I didn't refridgerate it over night before serving. I was able to stretch the syrup, however, by adding a little water to the hardened caramel which remained in the pan; I let it sit 45 minutes until it all disolved, and I served it with the flan.

Excellent recipe. It may help to add some cold water to the sugar, swirling the pan to dissolve the sugar, then caramelizing it at a medium high heat. And as others advised, straining the custard and placing the flan dish in a pan of water while baking yields better results. Also--where I used to work as a pastry chef, we would cover the baked, cooled flan & refrigerate it over night before serving the next day. This makes the flan texture cold & wonderful & the caramel has a chance to liquefy.

Maybe someone can help me out here. I thought I followed the recipe to the T... I initially had trouble making the caramel liquid part because it kept getting hard and when i poured it into the dish it hardened right away, preventing me from spreading it all over. So I had to make more caramel to cover the gaps. anyways then I poured the egg mixture on top of it and popped it in the oven. Half an hour into the baking, I opened the oven and I see my egg mixture bubbling like a cauldron, along with the caramel part that started to boil over the white part!! I let it be and took it out of the oven and let it cool on a wire rack. It wasn't a pretty sight, it looked ugly to say the least. Then when it got cool, I tried to take it out of the dish but the edges were ROCK hard from the caramel that seeped onto the top!! so i had to stab the edges with a knife and cut it all around. then I flipped it, and the other side didn't look so pretty either :( I am very disappointed. Can someone tell me what I did wrong so I can make this again. It tastes fine, just looks horrendous and messy. Thanks!

This was truly AWESOME and SO SO EASY. It's basically fail proof. I read the other reviews and didn't really need to change anything at all. Don't put it in the refrigerator, the directions didn't say to. It's great because I don't have to put it in water like other recipes suggest. It's the best flan I've ever had and I will only keep this recipe for flan. It's very rich in flavor but not too sweet.  Perfect for the holidays!!

Great results that surpassed my expectations!  I am a novice and this was my first attempt at both a syrup and the flan. I read the reviews and did the following: placed the glass dish on top of the stove near the vent to warm it while working on the rest of the steps. Increased eggs to 5 and used a blender to mix the vanilla and both milks before starting the sugar (condensed milk added last and no lumps formed so straining was not necessary).  Added a few drops of fresh lemon juice to the sugar and stirred continuously until the "wet sand" look was achieved. I didn't have quite enough to coat the bottom and certainly not the sides of the dish but I continued anyway (after cooking, the syrup had spread just fine-perhaps I should have let the sugar liquify a little more but I was nervous about it getting bitter as others warned about).  Placed a cookie sheet underneath the dish with about a half cup of water to create the water bath. Covered with foil. Tried a bite once cool and the rest the next day.  Next day texture and flavor seemed better. Will definitely make again as I think with practice this can become an easy recipe to master and requires very few ingredients.

This is a great recipe. I am Cuban and this is a very authentic Spanish flan. A few tips that I think are worth mentioning is that you don't want to over do it on the sugar. If you have to much caramel on the pan or its uneven, after you flip it over the flan will be sunken because the sugar will have melted into it. If you are between having more or less sugar, less is the way to go. I have made flan before with no caramel on the top and it does not taste much different. This is not to say you shouldn't have the caramel top. That is a key element of flan, but don't ruin your flan by putting too much. If the sugar is hardening a lot faster than you can spread it evenly across the pan, which it will do, try putting your pan on the burner to get it hot.(Make sure you are wearing oven mitts!!) Another thing that is mentioned in many recipes, but not in this one is putting it in a water bath. Just find a slightly bigger cake pan and fill it up about halfway with the flan pan inside of it. It will make the flans consistency much smoother and evenly cooked. Don't overcook your flan either!

First time flan maker checked this site, recipe looked good less eggs, a good thing, then I read a few reviews, I've found  I learn a lot from these with most recipes, one in particular from eka01 caught my attention, a faster way to mix ingredients.   Instead of melting sugar over heat she put 2/3 cup sugar and small amounts of water and lemon juice in Pyrex measuring cup and microwaved it, 2 minutes, check sugar, then another 2 minutes, finished, I found in my micro it took only 3 minutes total. She also used a blender to mix all ingredients, eggs first then added remaining ingredients, I tried it.  I was concerned because I was having friends in for dinner, Cuban pork roast, rice and beans then the flan, and he is a flan LOVER has had it in many restaurants including some in Spain.  when I served it, he said it blew him away, told him I would like constructive criticism so I could improve next time, he said it was perfect the way it was and not to fool around with recipe!  I really wanted to thank "eka01" for her tips!!!

This is a great recipe, the only things I would change is to only put the egg yolk instead of the entire egg and use 6 egg yolks. Delicious dessert though!

I love the flavor of this recipe but to make this correctly in is slightly inaccurate  my changes were instead of 3 eggs I used 6 eggs yolks no whites, and when adding this to the hot milk you must continue to add the egg mixture slowly so then the eggs to curdle ( the idea is to slowly change the temp of the eggs so you get the smooth texture) then when putting it in the oven using a water bath of boiling water will also help with the not burning of the custard.

This was my first attempt at Flan, and it turned out great. Very easy. I had to read up on liquifying sugar, (swirl don't stir!) but beyond that it was super simple. Mixed the filling in a blender per another reviewers suggestion and allowed to cool for an hour before turning out. It was just okay warm as it tasted smokey almost burnt, something I've noticed when eating flan before. We refrigerated the leftovers and upon trying them the next day discovered that the smokey flavor had all but disappeared.. amazing! Try this one.. cold!

Made changes but only because I like a more solid flan. I added 3 yokes, only used 3/4c sugar for the caramel, and baked in a water bath uncovered. This is a very easy and fast recipe to put together (used my blender). The 3 extra yokes made it a very smooth but firm textured desert. Until come across a better recipe, this will be at the top!

I tried this over the weekend.  The only change was I made it with 4 eggs, upped the vanilla and cooked it in a water bath for 1.5 hrs.  Pre-heated the baking pan before adding the sugar. OMG I think I'm in love.

I have made this flan recipe several times, and I follow it as written.  It is always delicious, and my family thinks it's better than restaurant flan!  I don't add extra eggs because I like a creamier, lighter flan.  Heating the sugar caramel is a little tricky, but if you're patient and watch it carefully, it turns out great.  One adjustment I recommend is making the flan the night before.  This way, it becomes firm and all the flavors blend deliciously.  Plus, it's easier to get out of the pan without cracking.

I have been making this recipe for years thanks to my mother-in-law who lived in Cuba for many years. It is my husband's favourite dessert so I make it often but cook it in the pressure cooker. Place it in glass or metal container, cover with foil, add water to half way, bring it up to pressure, and let cook for approx. 15 minutes.

I forgot to cover my baking dish with aluminum foil and remembered to do so halfway through the baking process. Needless to say the flan was lumpy but still tasted great. Also, when making the sugar syrup, make sure you smear the baking dish rapidly because the syrup hardens fast. Last of all, the hot syrup should be an amber color.

I did follow advice on putting 5 eggs instead of what you said with the 3, because I have read that people do add a lot more. But I think next time I will follow yours with the 3. It was very tasty, my hubby loved it.

This was really good.  I made the mistake of adding an extra egg as some reviewers suggested, but I prefer the original recipe.

I've never made caramel before, so a little more explanation on what to expect as the sugar is melting would be great.  Mine turned all clumpy and hard and I was about to throw it out, but decided to let it keep going and then it was fine.

I cooked the sugar a little too long, but it did not make a difference in the taste.  It was soooo good.  The only problem is, I am the only one in my family who likes Flan and I have eaten nearly the entire thing by myself.

Ok, so mine looked nothing like the picture, but it was SOOOO good! I LOVE flan, and this was so good, it tasted like it came from a restaurant! Be careful though, as mine bubbled over and got all over the bottom of my oven (thank goodness for self cleaning ovens!!). I would recommend either not filling your pan up all the way (like I did), or putting foil under it to catch any spills. Despite the mess I made, it was totally worth it and I will definitely make it again.

Very delicious! My bf is Filipino and he said this is exactly the way they make it in the Phillipines. The sugar syrup wasn't even hard at all to make so I'm not sure why some made it such a big deal.

This flan is excellent!  I added cream cheese, as someone else recommended and was worried because it doesn't look like it blends in well.  However, I went ahead and baked it as the recipe calls for, and it turned out perfect.  Richer and thicker than other flans.  Thank for the recipe!

I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and it had a good consistency. I used 10 small individual glass dishes like the ones used for jello.  I put them in the fridge for 4hrs when I took them out I let them sit out for about 1/2 hr. I inverted the dishes but the sugar was hard as rock so most of the sugar stayed on the dish. It was delicious but maybe next time I won't put it in the fridge.

Super easy and super tasty!  A big hit!  Would definitely make again.  Did add two more eggs to the recipe at the suggestion of another reviewer.

REALLY GOOD, next time ill just leave out the sugar bc it didnt really caramelize or harden it just melted and left a really really sweet layer on the bottom that i didnt rly like.
*****update--ive been making this recipe as is, but i felt it was too too sweet so i cut the condensed milk by 1/4 and it was better. it was still a little sweeter than i like so i think itll be perfect next time if i use only half the can of condensed milk. also water bath did nothing for me.

Since the recipe is very simple it doesn’t provide much guidance.  Helped to read reviews for this and other flan recipes.  I used 4 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, and left out the vanilla. The 4th egg made it denser than I personally like. Had to mix batter in a blender on low - couldn’t get smooth with the electric mixer.   No trouble with melting sugar that many reviewers mention. Low heat and stirring is all you need. I did overheat the first batch.  As a result, when I poured the syrup into the baking dish, it wasn't very soft and hardened quickly, so I couldn’t spread it. With second attempt, once the sugar liquefied, I quickly poured.  I also took the advice on the water bath when baking and ignored all the different advice on the type of baking dish to use (deep or dark pans). I bought a $3 large aluminum roast pan and used a clear glass baking dish. I put the baking dish in the center of the pan and then poured hot (not boiling) water half way up the sides of the dish.  Refrigerated the flan 8 hours. When it was time to serve, took a knife along the edges and flipped onto plate. No problem. Make sure to put the serving plate on top of the dish before flipping. The syrup just poured over the sides without me doing anything.  I was surprised how easy it was to make… really fast and simple. Even though I would have liked it to be less dense and will use only 3 eggs next time, it was a huge hit with my guests. I think the density is really personal taste.

This is amazing!!! I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and it was pure perfection!!!!! I baked this in a large (glass) baking pan set my two small glass pans with the batter inside and poured hot water into the large glass pan. This will melt the caramel. When the hour was up I took the individual pans with the flan and set them to cool down for about an hour then refrigerate for a day for a really good flan.

I followed reviewers' recommendations and heated/carmelized the sugar with a couple dashes of lemon juice and a splash of water. (It took a while, maybe 30 minutes, but turned a perfect golden brown.) I also baked the flan in a water bath.   My man, who travels to Panama frequently, said that this flan tastes as good as the best he's had in Panama. (He also has celiac disease and therefore can't have any foods with wheat - so finding an excellent, naturally gluten-free dessert is an exceptional score!)

This was fabulous! I added 2 extra eggs and made it in a glass pie dish placed in a large pan of warm water. I also added cinnamon to the liquified sugar. I served this at a celebration party we had for my 5 month old son and got rave reviews. Thank you!!!!

This is a simple recipe, but you need to make adjustments if you want it to look like the picture.  I've made it many times but it only comes perfect when I make all the adjustments.

Dos:   

1.  Heat pan in oven before pouring the caramel in.
2.  Add extra 2-3 eggs if you prefer a thicker consistency.  As is, the flan will be a little liquidy if you use 3 eggs.
3.  Cook in a water bath otherwise the flan won't have a smooth texture.
4.  Warm it in  another hot water bath if you are going to invert it.   This will loosen up the caramel.  Otherwise, it will defn. crack because the caramel is stuck to the dish.

Best if baked in a pie plate. I used 4 eggs and baked in a warm water bath. After they had cooled completely, I again had in the warm water bath for a few minutes so that it released easily onto the serving plate.

Loved this recipe!! I added an extra egg which made the perfect consistency! I used some of the other reviewers' tips such as adding a few drops of lemon to the carmel mixture and baked in a water bath (my mom used to cook it this way). My boyfriend who is very particular about his flan absolutely loved it!! He could not stop raving about it and getting more helpings!! I will definitely make this again! I was not too sugary as some flans tend to be. It did take a little while to get the carmel to melt and loosen out of the pan though.

My Dominican friend absolutely loves whenI make this. Says it's perfect . I  surprised her with my Flan skills on this one! 
I cooked it in a water bath  and let cool before turning it over.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the flan mixture.

Wonderful. Is made even more tasty with coconut extract :) The only suggestion I would make is to use less sugar for top/coating; you really don't need that entire cup.

Blending all the ingredients in a blender makes it faster, and smoother.  Also, I would recommend adding an egg, more vanilla, a little rum, and covering it with aluminum foil while baking. This tastes great---do try it!

I work with a lady from Spain, and she tasted this flan and gave a big thumbs up!  I use 6 eggs for an eggier taste. To make the caramel syrup, I put the cup of sugar in a large, thick-bottomed skillet (for a more even heat distribution), a low heat, and I wait till the sugar begins to melt.  I don't stir the sugar or shake the pan.  Just let the heat do its job.  As you wait (patiently!) for the melting process to finish, it is necessary to move the pan off the burner periodically, but eventually the sugar is all melted without becoming scorched or turning into concrete.  This is the most difficult part of the recipe to accomplish, but when you do it right, the result is amazing!

Very good flan!  I did what the others suggested and it came out perfect.  I mixed the custard first while the sugar carmelized and poured the sugar onto a heated dish.  I also baked the flan in a water bath.  My husband loved the flan too!  Great recipe.

Turned out very very well. Per other reviewers recommendation I used and extra egg and reduced the sugar to only 3/4 cup. I think I could have recuded the amount futher and the desert would have tunred out just fine. Also I baked it in a water bath and it turned out great! Overall easy to make and extremely tasty!

Like many of the readers, I also baked my flan in a water bath, uncovered. I only added 1 Tspn of vanilla instead of the full Tbsp, as I wasn't sure if the vanilla would taste too overpowering, but it came out tasting just fine, and it didn't take away from the flavor either. The result was a rich and creamy, mouth-watering flan...soooo goood!

This is a really good recipe. Here's a tip, before eating it, put in the fridge. To cool it down. This is the best most original Flan recipe there is! This is the best desert especially if you like Mexican or are Hispanic!

Made this for a Mexican themed dinner and it turned out excellent! Even people who don't like custard liked this.  I baked mine in a water bath so it wouldn't be so dense. Also refrigerated it overnight, I think that's the key in making sure you have a nice liquid carmel topping.

This turned out perfect! The only thing I changed is the sugar. I used brown sugar instead of white just because thats what I have always done. But by far this is the most authentic flan recipe I have ever tried, thanks for sharing :-)

After reading the last review, I just had to try this recipe because it got a lot of great reviews. I, too, am Spanish and I just couldn't resist trying this out for myself. I thought this was excellent for flan. If you don't want it as heavy, bake it in a water bath and it will be lighter. I think that is what makes this recipe different or heavier but OH MY is it tasty. It is very very delicious and vey easy and my family loved it. You can't go wrong on this one. It truly is one of the best flans I've tasted.

So here is what I learned:  to melt sugar, use a medium sized skillet, start with about half the sugar, as it melts add the rest. Do not stir it, but tilt the pan to get it moving. It goes fast, and it hardens faster. Work fairly quickly. 
I made 7 individual flans  and cooked it for about 40 minutes in a water bath.  
This was restaurant quality or better! We ate it warm... like heaven on a spoon.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, I was kind of skeptical in making this, due to the fact that i would have to put it in a water bed. But it turned out so easy and so so good

I make 8 pans of this 3 times a year.  It's a very good recipe.  One of the reviewers had a brilliant suggestion to microwave the syrup (sugar and water) rather than using a pan. It's a wonderful short-cut and the only way I will make flan, ever!  I put 1 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of water in a pyrex measuring cup, and as she suggested, microwave for 7 minutes.  Depending on your microwave, it could take longer so keep an eye on it.  When it starts to turn med. brown, take it out.  It continues to cook and will get darker.
This is a very good recipe, you will love it.  I usually put 3 oz. of room temp. cream cheese in mine to make it a little richer, but either way, this is a keeper.

This was my first flan and this recipe was just perfect. I added two more eggs based on comments below. It turned out fantastic! Making the carmel was the trickiest part. Patience was key, plus really a medium burner. I was nervous about burning the sugar and kept fire a little too low for the first few minites. But once I got the hang of how high the flame needed to be to make it into liquid I was on my way! My family just loved it.

I bake mine in a water bath. That's very important while cooking this dish, every hispanic mom/grandma will not bake it without it. Its a real deal. Also, I add 5-6 eggs and 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a splash of fresh milk. That's how my grandmother taught my mom...

OK ladies I am new to the site and new to really experiment ting with cooking dishes outside my box. I joined a food club and my food choice to present was seafood paella. I had to pair it with something light since paella is so filling. A friend told me what to but I decided to research recipes and comments to see. I am proud to say my flan came out perfect and I've never tasted or even heard of flan. It was The recipe it simple I used as per my recommendation and some reviews I used 5 eggs, can of evaporated and can of sweet condensed. I mixed really well sat in fridge for about 20 minutes removed and whipped again just for good measure lol I used the warm bsthmrthkd I took a huge roasting pan and added boiled water I put the pan in the oven first then poured the water in it for safety measure. Since so many ppl complained about making the suagar mixed I opted out and I bought caramel topping. I layered the bottom of a 9in pie dish and placed in the warm bath I then added the mix and covered with foil. Baked for 60 min cracked the door and cooked for another 15 minutes removed cooled went around edge with knife so no  stick refrigerated . when I presented I sliced  piece on a plate that was decorated with a Lil drizzle of  caramel garnished with  dash of whip cream a strawberry and a few bkueberjries..very light dessert...sorry so lengthy but this was super easy and good.

I ditched all my complicated flan recipes and started using this one. It's very simple to make and very creamy. 3 eggs or 4 eggs, you cannot really tell the difference. It's just as good. I am filipino and this leche flan is one of our favorite dessert. I make it every get together and my friends loves it. They always want the recipe and they couldn't believe I only used 3 eggs! I bake it in the oven "water bath" style and for the syrup, I heat a small pot on high, put in the sugar, when i start seeing the sugar liquifying, i start stirring it, then when half of it has been liquified, i turn the stove to low-mediun heat then keep on stirring until all of it is in liquid form. I pour the syrup right away and coat the bottom of a pyrex dish. don't panic if the syrup starts hardening or cracking. also another tip is i cook it a day before and keep it in the fridge till ready to eat. I have also tried using 14 oz half & half since i didn't have the evaporated milk and it turned out just as creamy. also do not skip the vanilla!

This was great, and by far the easiest flan recipe I've made.  Couple of thoughts that make it even easier:  I don't bother with the foil, and it turns out fine.  I've also used a combo of evaporated milk and whole milk when I need to make a large batch, and it turns out fine.  I use ramekins, and this makes about 8.  Finally, I've always had trouble with my caramel hardening in the bottom of the ramekin, so I switched to Smuckers Caramel Syrup.  Even better!

Shortcut is to use the blender likeartsychicany suggested AND skip the sugar/caramel if you're in a hurry (just flip after chilled & top with Smucker's caramel sauce). I used 5 eggs & it was too "eggy" to me. 4 eggs was perfect. I also added a dash of whole milk & 2 dashes of heavy cream. One hr & no more! Perfect texture.

This was so easy and tasted AMAZING!!!  My husband usually doesn't even like flan, but he loved this one!  I copied other reviewers and added 4 oz cream cheese and mixed it all in the blender......not one thing wrong with it, thankfully since I made it the first time for company that I barely knew.

The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly and it was flat and too dense and the outer part (bottom) was too well-cooked.  I made the following changes and it was PERFECT:
1.) I added 1/4 cup of water to the sugar when I cooked it which allowed me to better control the color/texture of the sugar.  It turned out perfect.
2.) I cooked the flan in a water bath using the hottest water I could get out of the tap.  I cooked it for 1.5 hours at 350 degrees and it turned out perfect!

Excellent.  I use coconut cream/milk instead of the condensed milk and it is superb- the coconut cream makes it a bit creamier and adds a touch of coconut flavor.  My husband is from Argentina, and he applauds this flan :)

A tip for flan-making novices: the key to making it be great is not to cook it for too long (almost every flan I have had outside of my home has been overcooked).  Flan is easy to make, but hard to cook perfectly.  It should be firm around the edges, but still jiggly in the middle.  If you get those little holes throughout it, then you've cooked it too long.  It will still be good, but you'll miss out on the creamy, smooth texture you get if you don't cook it too long. Of course, I've also cooked it too little more than once, and that's not good either. I wouldn't recommend trying this for the first time if you're making it for guests.  After a few times of cooking it either too much or too little, you'll know right when to take it out of the oven.

Great flan! I also kept the ramekins in the oven while I made the caramel so the melted sugar wouldn't harden too quickly.  I made the melted sugar in the microwave (1/4 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar and 3 drops of lemon juice) for 6 minutes until golden. I used 4 eggs and added 1/4th tablespoon of almond extract to the custard portion as well. Lastly, I too placed the ramekins in a cake pan filled halfway with water. Baked for 1 hour uncovered. Turned out perfect! Makes 6 ramekins. UPDATE: Repeated this again as a healthier version with fat free evaporated milk and fat free condensed milk  and  only used 3 eggs as recipe called for and it was just as good as when I made it before!

I loved this recipe! I had to make it for a Spanish project and I definitely will be making it again. I recommend keeping the pan warm in the oven because the melted sugar hardens very quickly so it is much easier to pour into a warm pan. I forgot to add the vanilla extract but you couldn't taste the difference. It was still great!

This was great; however, I made a few changes, so I don't know how the exact recipe would be. I added another egg and also 4 oz of cream cheese.  Everybody loved it. Sugar takes a while to caramelize completely. Dont let the sugar burn. It should be an amber brown. If it turns dark brown, it's probably burned, which means it will be bitter. I made that mistake once.

I've been using this recipe for about 4 years now! Never fails to impress. I always had to make 2 for my family, and have started making 3 now because of how much everyone loves it.

The only thing I do differently is only add in half a tsp of vanilla (I found 1 tbsp to be too overpowering). I also bake in a water bath uncovered for an hour, and let it cool overnight in the fridge. 

Sometimes I'll add lemon juice to the sugar, and sometimes I forget. The lemon juice makes the sugar more liquidy and without any lumps. But the lumps always melt in the oven anyways.

Cloyingly oversweet, and if I had not added baking *in bain-marie*, the texture would have been awful. I first learned to make flan during the years I lived i Spain. There, my friends used fresh whole milk, nothing canned, to make it. The two canned milk products used in this recipe make it taste of can, and that's just plain nasty. Sweetened condensed milk has the additional problem of coarsening the texture of the flan. Using the heavily sweetened milk product in addition to the full amount of sugar Spanish cooks use makes the flan taste cloying; it is not this sweet in Spain, the homeland of flan. In addition,. it is customary for Spanish cooks to add a long strip of lemon zest to the sugar before caramelizing it; they remove the lemon zest after the sugar turns a good, dark caramel. This recipe fails to tell you to bake it in a bain-marie, which ruins the texture. A flan baked in bain-marie is much smoother and less prone to forming those unpleasant little bubbles.

This recipe was awesome!  I had the picky eaters asking for seconds! I am not the most confident cook but I read many of the comments and followed suggestions and it was just great! I used 4 eggs instead of 3. I made the syrup in the microwave using the sugar, about 1/4 cup of water and a squeeze of lemon juice...and it was about 6 minutes before I saw it turn slightly brown, so I took it out and it continued to brown. I made the mixture of the other ingredients in the blender before doing the syrup in the microwave.
I had the oven preheated with the flan dish in a water pan as suggested.
Let it cool after cooking it and put it in the frig overnight...
GREAT recipe! Made it soo easy!

I don't really like the taste of flan but I made it for my Spanish class earlier this year and everyone loved it! Melting the sugar was the hardest part for me, but apparently I'm doing it again since now my mom is wanting some. xD But I really liked making it; it was easy for the most part and people enjoyed it. :)

my husband loves flan and this recipe is awesome you can do so much with this recipe make it your own.  Just a little note use a dish you can throw away you will never get the sugar off I even tried to boil it off didn't work just a hint for you I added some fresh nutmeg to the custard and some finishing salt to the sugar gives it that little hum that people can not figure out I love adding things to recipes and this I a great recipe to add things you will love it

Okay i do like this recipe but, I do think that the sugar for the caramel is to much and the vanilla in the Flan mix should be lowered to 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp it comes out with a way to strong vanilla flavor.

This was delicious but I had difficulty getting it out of the pan. I did put it in a iron skillet with water for about 5-7 minutes but it required longer.  I had to take it to a party and it cracked when I took it out.  However,it was delicious and I did not take any home.

Wow, I just love this recipe!  It tastes completely authentic.  We vacation regularly on an island in the Yucatan, and I always order this for desert.  It's so simple, but so good, and it's sooo easy to make with pantry goods that I always have on hand. You basically mix it up and pop it in the oven and it's done!  I guess I especially love it because it reminds me of vacations in Mexico!

Made this recipe last night and OMG! Just tried it after letting it sit all night. It is Sooo good!! I did read all the reviews 1st and I made some changes according to the reviews. I used 4 eggs just cause I prefer that texture and I cooked it using the bath version. Just tastes better to us. I made the caramel in the microwave. 1/2 cp water 3/4 cup sugar and a dash of lemon juice. I watched it closely and it took about 6 minutes to turn light Amber. Poured it into the pan that was heated and it spread great. No Problems at all. and for the people that seem lost with the sugar? it is not added to the flan/egg mixture. the 1 cup sugar is for the caramel.. Thank you Asoto!! Love this recipe! its a keeper.

I never liked flan as a child... it always had this taste (kind of like this one turned out!). But, as an adult, I recently tried one that was so delicious... I wanted to give it a chance! I took the advice of others & added a couple drops of lemon juice to the sugar. I swirled it & cooked over low heat it was a beautiful light brown color. I had the dish heating in the oven so it was almost hot. Used blender... I did the water bath. After 1 hr I took it out. I checked it & it was still very watery... so in it went another 45 mins. Again after taking it out it was still watery in the middle. So I didin't use the water bath this time baked another 23 mins. After letting it cool I inverted it all this lovely looking caramel came oozing out... then I tried it. UGGH! the caramel was so unappealing! We all cut off the caramel top & the rest was okay... My hubby & MIL liked it (but then they always liked flan). Now, to be fair it maybe the other suggestions I followed... so I will try this again following the recipe 100%.

Wasn't pretty, but tastes delicious!!  Made it exactly as recipe called for.  Will probably cut back on the sugar next time as it was way too sweet for me.

This was my first attempt at making a flan.  I follow a suggestion to bake the dish in a pan of water.  I also added 4 eggs instead of 3 and used a blender to mix ingredients.  I had to cook mine for about 12 minutes longer than the original 60 minutes as it was still quite liquidy at that time.  I had company over and we all held our breath as I flipped over the flan.  Happily, it stayed it's shape.  Even better than that was the taste.  Everybody was raving about how delicous it was and that it was the best flan they ever had.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was simple and it was a hit. very easy! The 2nd time I made the flan I toasted some coconut and sprinkled it on the sugar before throwing in the custard to bake. The coconut version was very  good. I did add some vanilla essence to cut the rankness of the egg.

Simple and elegant!

For a party over a dozen persons, I upped the eggs from 3 to 9, increased the condensed milk to 1 1/2 cans, and 4 cups milk. Baked in a waterbath for exactly 1 hour. For a beautiful smooth silky texture (no tiny holes), be careful not to overcook the custard. The center should still be a little jiggly.

Delicious!  Used 3 jumbo eggs.  Then put 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice with sugar for the caramel sauce.  Used 4 tablespoons mexican vanilla in the flan.  Put flan ingredients in the blender and blended for about 1 minute total.  Very easy dessert to make and so delicious!  Keeps well in the fridge so you can make a few days ahead to minimize "day of" preparation.

very very delicious!! just made it and it came out so good. I also added 5 eggs, didnt think 3 was enough. The lime juice in the sugar also gives it that special flavor that makes it even better. Will be doing this easy recipe from now on.

I am half Costa Rican & half Purto Rican with a Dominican hubby & I've been making flan for my family for years and I make my flan base this way, but I  mix everything in a blender. I keep reading that people are adding sugar to the flan base. The sugar is for the syrup people!!! You can also try making a coconut flan. Just add half a can of cream of coconut. When I'm making my flans for my family reunion I bring them in aluminum cake pans. Everybody raves over my flan! I usually bring about 8. For my family of 5, I'll use Pyrex pie plates. My hubby, 3 kids and I love my flan! If you're not Hispanic, you can tell people you baked an authentic Hispanic flan. Have fun baking!

Make sure to use a stainless steel, copper, or clad pot, pan, or bowl when melting the sugar (I used a stainless steel mixing bowl over the stove, it only took about 10 minutes).

This recipe is very delicious!, but I had problem making the caramel, it is too slow and it didn't worked well, so I used an small pan with a little bit of water. I baked the flan the way the recipe says and it turned out beautiful!

Make this exactly as the recipe is listed, BUT bake it in a water bath. If you don't know what a water bath is Google it! : ) I had to! I had never baked anything in a water bath prior to making flan. This is a super easy recipe. My girlfriends loved the flan and couldn't believe that I made it myself. They also begged for more... This is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful, easy recipe. I did make extra of the caramel just because that's how we like it and I use vanilla beans instead of extract but that's just a personal prefrence. Overall a great, easy, tasty recipe

This was my very first flan and I was really worried about ending up with a frittata instead of nice custard.  Thanks to this simple recipe and some reviewer tips, my first flan came out GREAT!

I used six eggs since I like a denser flan, and added a touch of vanilla to the caramel like another reviewer suggested.  I had a taste once it cooled to room temperature and it was very good.  However, it tasted AMAZING after I let it chill in the fridge overnight.  It could just be my personal preference, but I recommend popping your flan in the fridge for at least 4-6 hours before serving.

ETA - I did not use a water bath since I did not know that is a common way flan is baked.  As I wrote in my review, my flan (first one ever!) came out great.  So, I really don't think you *need* a water bath.  Just be sure to check on your flan regularly to avoid overcooking.  The temp control on my oven is wonky, anyway, so I checked every 10 minutes or so.  Total baking time for me ended up being about 45 minutes.

This recipe had a good texture, and taste was decent. Used some advice given such as water bath and 4 eggs. However, i found it was just too sweet, and i normally like sweet things. I would suggest cutting down on the sweetened  condensed milk to maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of the tin, and cutting down on the sugar.

This turned out wonderfully and I got tons of compliments. Very authentic and not too eggy. My first sugar melting batch burned so be sure to put the heat very low so it melts uniformly without burning, be patient with this first step. The rest is super super easy and yes, definitely bake in a water bath but you don't have to, still turns out great. My Puerto Rican friend said it tasted very authentic and would be wonderful for Cinco de Mayo party I plan to make again.

The only issue I had with this was the amount of liquid in my pie plate; cleaning the bottom of my oven was not pleasant!  :)  However, the flan was delicious and got a good response from my family on Mexican theme night.  I'd make again but maybe pour individual ramekins of flan instead of using my pesky pie plate.

Fantastic Flan!!!! Best Ever. My husband and I made it together on our anniversary. It was so good we didn't even let it cool all the way before diving in. Warm and creamy. It was great from the fridge too. We ate most of it in one sitting LOL. I took advice from others and added one additional egg (I was using extra large) and also added 1/4tsp cinnamon. Blended it all in a blender at once. I used a glass rectangle pan (don't have round), 2 cookie sheets. One for water bath and one to cover it. Turned out amazing.

Made this for a Mexican Food themed get together and it was a hit. I added an extra egg yolk as several of the traditional recipes I came across used 4 eggs. It was dense creamy and delicious. I'm sure it would be just fine without the extra yolk though. I also had the most success using the microwave method for the syrup (in a previous review) after burning the first batch over the stove.

double the carmel.  I prefer the 3 egg recipe for a finer texture.  To set up quickly-and for a coarser testure use 5 eggs ( turns out like rice pudding)

I made flan before, many times and using almost the same recipe as this one, but with 8 whole eggs and it always came out tasting great. I did try this recipe last week, and it came out very, very sweet. But the texture was great. I think cutting down the condensed milk down to 2/3 will be just right. I used Borden and wondering if different brand has different amount of sweetness.

I have made this flan a few times now and it is tasty. I use 4 eggs and fat free condensed/evaporated milks and blend it together in a blender while the sugar caramelizes. The only tricky part is the caramel sauce, but be patient and use a few drops of lemon juice to speed things up.

Pretty good!! I'm trying to find a recipe where the flan comes out creamy, almost the consistency of smooth cream cheese. I had it once at a restaurant and I'm still on the search for something similar. This was definitely a little more of an eggy flan.

Yummy!!! Me and my husband licked the ramekins clean. I followed the recipe (measurements) to the T but I agree with other reviewers that the Directions are lacking. So I read atleast 50 reviews and concluded that: 1. Add water and 4-5 drops of lemon juice to the sugar (untill it turns into the consistency of wet sand) before starting to caramalize it. 2. Bake your flan in a water bath. (Insert your baking dish into another bigger baking dish and fill the bigger dish with water to half the height of the inside dish 3. With the measurements given in the recipe, it takes more than 60 mins for the flan to bake if you use a deep baking dish. If you are using  ramekins then you would need a little less than 60 mins. To check if done insert a knife in the center of the flan. The knife should come out clean (almost). The flan is a little jiggly when done.  CONS:  I used 3 whole eggs as called for in the recipe but my flan smelled a little eggy and I hate that smell. So next time I am going to add more vanilla essence. Some reviewers said they added 5-6 eggs .....not needed...3 eggs are more than enough.

I should be embarrassed about my behavior, but this flan is simply too delicious. I took a bite or two when it first came out of the oven. YUM. I let it cool for about 1 1/2 hours, taking bites at 15 minute intervals. YUMM. I couldn't wait long enough for it to cool completely so I pulled it out lukewarm and voila... it's soooo beautiful! And YUMMM! I just ate a 3rd of it. YUMMMM! I was looking for an authentic recipe and here it is! Please don't ever make the ones with cream cheese. Gross. This is it. Throw all the liquids in a blender, add and extra egg or two if you want it denser. Oh so simple. Didn't have any trouble with the sugar melting once I put the dial on medium-high. Melted right away with no problems! Definitely do the water bath. Sounds harder then it is.

My family is Cuban and *knows* their flan. When I first made this, they were skeptical because it was a little different than our traditional recipe, but they loved it, and it really is absolutely delicious.  My personal tip- to use one less pot, try heating your caramel in your baking dish- I use either a stainless steel loaf pan or a enameled iron dish for making flan. Aluminum is even fine, as long as the custard only comes in contact with the caramel and not the pan. Also- you should strain the custard mixture as you pour it into the dish.  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Ok, this was not an easy recipe for me to make. I put the sugar in the pan and it NEVER liquified. I tried adding a little water and constantly stirring but it never turned golden and eventually the water evaporated. I was totally frustrated. I just had hot sugar. Finally I turned the heat up to a little past medium and what was supposed to happen finally did. Next time I make this it should be easier and less frustrating now that I know how to make the caramel. As for the flan, it was pretty good. I will be making this again.

This is a great and very simple recipe for traditional flan. Absolutely LOVED it! Flan is my favorite dessert and now that I know it's so easy to make, I'm going  to make it all the time!! Just like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, heat up the pyrex dish while mixing the ingredients so the melted sugar doesn't harden when you pour it. Enjoy :)

A tad bit sweet, though the consistency is perfect.  I agree with other reviewers that 1 cup of sugar produced entirely too much caramel sauce.  Would probably make again,  using less condensed milk.

I made this with my son for his Spanish project. Per reviewer suggestions, I added an additional egg and let it cook for 15 minutes longer because it was still very uncooked in the center. It came out perfect and his teacher raved! This was SO simple, much more so than I expected. Will definitely make again! I'm thinking cream cheese to the mix would be wonderful as well.

I made the mistake of asking my neighbor what kind of desert he liked. Of course he said flan, I had never heard of it at the time. He went by a restaurant and picked one up for me to try! Love at first bite! I made this tonight and it was wonderful!! I used four eggs instead of 3 and used the hot water bath. I put it in the refrigerator over night and used the hot water bath to melt the caramel before serving.  Perfect!   Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was excellent! I was so impressed that it turned out. I did add an extra egg as many reviewers suggested. The one thing I did do that I won't do again is used real vanilla bean and it made it a bit crunchy as I think I added to much but that was my own fault. Also following other reviewers advice on making the carmel sauce. I did not stir the sugar until it started to liquify then stirred. It takes time and if it is clumping stop stirring it is too soon. Also warm pan in oven before pouring in carmel sauce and then cook in water bath.

How to clean pot after caramel: fill the pot with water (3/4 of the way or so) put some dish washing soap, and bring to a boil. Stick spoon (or utensil) used for caramel inside. Once boiling, gently scrape caramel off of utensil. Pot remains unscratched and you can actually see your spoon once again.     I changed a couple things, for one 4 eggs. Secondly, put into a water bath in the oven. Amazing flan everyone wanted the recipe.

My peruvian boyfriend and ecuadorian roommate swear by my flan recipe :) I use 4 eggs instead of 3 to get the right consistency, and brown sugar instead of white sugar for a nice rich caramel color. Tastes better when made a day ahead and chilled well. One of my favorite desserts - very cheap to make and doesn't take much time.

Let me just say-I don't like flan. I was making for a cooking club-spanish theme and I got desert. But OH MY, this was tasty!

My Aunt used to make this when she visited its a huge favourite. The only difference with this recipe is that she uses 5 eggs and steams on top of the stove. I tried this and it came out lovely. Warming the pan before you put in the caramel was very helpfull as well as swirling the sugar every now and then by lifting a little off the burner while holding the handle (no spoon) while it melted on low flame. Also I just filled the condense tin with skimmed milk after I poured out the condensed milk. After coating with the caramel and filling with the custard  I placed the filled tin which had a lid inside a pot with water half way up the tin and covered tightly with pot cover.(You can use foil to tighten the cover if slack just around the rim) This was on a medium to low flame for one hour then take off to cool somewhat.  Cover the tin with a pie plate and turn upsided down and there you have a great desert.

Excellent, and easy--I actually got the sugar to carmelize without burning it! ;-)  I did add a little cream cheese and an extra egg, to get it to firm up a bit faster, since I planned to bring it to a potluck only 3-1/2 hours after putting it in the oven.  They loved it, but next time I'll try the recipe as written, since it seemed a bit heavy with the modifications.

A hit with my husband and family! I doubled the recipe to make two flans and it still came out very nicely. Next time I will add 6 or 7 eggs per recipe, rather than the 5 for a more dense version.

Very nice consistency and easy to make...it's too sweet though. The custard part doesn't need any sugar, the caramelized sugar on the bottom is definitely enough! So next time I'll just use evaporated milk.

This is the same recipe that I have in one of my authenic mexican cookbooks.  This is the best flan I have ever had. People I know who didn't like flan now love flan because of this recipe.  In my recipe book it is called cheese flan because of the smooth and sturdy texture.  I do use a waterbath when baking.  My mother in-law who is Colombian and a very good cook requested the recipe from me after I made it for  her.  Prior to tasting my flan she contended that her recipe was the best but now she has a new recipe.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner to go with my sister-in-law's paella. Everyone just loved it. The taste is creamy, smooth, and sweet, and the flan looks so pretty. I had trouble the first time I tried to melt the sugar, and it melded itself to the bottom of the pan. The second time, I put the heat on the lowest setting possible and was very, very patient. Don't give up on it, the end result is so tasty.

I've made this recipe 3 times, because my husband loves it (and so do I)!  I usually prepare the egg mixture first, and then carmalize the sugar.  I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon, a small cap full of raspberry extract, and 3/4 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  This gives it a little extra zing!  I've never tried to make this without baking it in a water bath, so be sure to use that method! (Just put a cookie sheet in the oven, your baking pan with all the stuff in it, and fill the cookie sheet with water, but do not put so much water in it that it spills out into the oven).  Enjoy!

This was a great flan.  Married into a Puerto Rican family I got the approval in authenticity taste.  I did use four eggs and I added 1 tablespoon of Kahlua.  It was fantastic!!!  I will make this one again!

If you simply follow the easy instructions, and use a water bath, this is by FAR the best Flan recipe on this site.  And I have tried nearly all of them; DH loves Flan, and I needed to find one that was easy to prepare and was restaurant quality.  Here it is!!! When he makes it, he sometimes adds more eggs, or just yolks, and says it is delicious either way; but I like it just as the recipe states.  Always a hit with guests, and has become a favorite of the family.  Thanks for a superb recipe!!

This was my first attempt at flan.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and pre-heated the pan prior to pouring the caramel.  Unfortunately, I forgot to either shorten the cooking time or let the pan cool completely before adding the custard, because after 60 minutes I had an omlette.  It was a very tastey omlette at least, I just need to dial in my cooking time.

This was my first attempt at flan, and I was so proud when the raves began after everyone tasted it (even my sister who doesn't care much for flan said it was really, really good). I, too, did the water bath as suggested by others, and though the texture wasn't as smooth as I hoped it would be, it was still delicious. At first I was a little worried 'cause the top was a little dry during baking, but once inverted, the persentation was gorgeous.  I personally found the taste was a lot better after a day or two, so I'll make it a couple of days in advance from now on. Haven't tried any other flan recipe, but with this one on hand, not sure that I want to...  :)

This flan is excellent! Much better than anything you can buy in the Seattle area, it is even better than the wonderful flan I buy at my local market in Mexico! I added a little lemon to the caramel, as someone suggested, I think that makes a huge difference in the taste. I'll be making this a lot!

This flan was ok... i was trying to come as close to the flavor of my grandmothers recipe without asking for it. This definately did not come close, it was way too rich and didnt have much of the eggy taste which is what i enjoy most in a flan. Otherwise if your in for more of a custard without too much of the egg taste, stick to this recipe.

This flan was delicious!  It was my first time making flan, and my boyfriend (from MX) loved it.  I used 2 Pyrex dishes and baked half of the ingredients with just the aluminum foil cover, and the other half with the aluminum and a water bath... the flan baked with the water bath was MUCH smoother and sweeter that we ate that all  in one sitting. =o)

Awesome Flan! That rich, smooth and sweet taste almost melts in your mouth really put your salivary glands to work. You won't want to drink anything with it since it might wash down all that heavenly taste. The secret is to eat every bite like its the last.

Easy to make but it did not have the kind of "flan" flavor that I like. Next time I'd try it with less condensed milk and more eggs.

I have never made flan or caramelized sugar before using this recipe. It came out wonderful and the texture was divine. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up storing it whole in the fridge over night before eating it. I recommend letting it get cold before eating.

Yikes!  DEFINITELY use a water bath and NOT foil!  I’m a very experienced cook and have made other flan recipes many times, using a water bath, with absolutely no problems.  I was cautious about this method, but gave it a try.  After about 30 minutes the caramel started wicking up the foil and bubbling over the custard and burning on the oven bottom (curses).  I know I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1/2 teaspoon of finely grated orange zest.  I’ll NEVER omit the water bath again!!!

Great recipe and instructions.  I followed the to the letter but ended up with about 3/4 cup extra custard for a 9" pie pan.  I also baked mine in a water bath as that has been my go-to method for custards and cheesecakes.

Jus like my mom made it. I add an extra egg if I’m making my flan shape fancier with molds. The extra egg adds structure. I also use a hand blender from cuisine art. I used a blender once but it put lots of air. I also add half a table spoon of vanilla and 3-4 sprinkles of cinnamon. I split the portions into a muffin tin.

Great and easy recipe, although I have a couple of tips that make it even easier. I was struggling to get the sugar to caramelize. I gave up and found a recipe to caramelize the sugar in the microwave - using the same sugar, 1 cup,  but added 1/4 quarter cup of hot water and microwaved it on full power for 5-8 minutes, watch it  carefully so it doesn't burn. I used a glass casserole dish and melted the sugar right in the casserole dish. Once the sugar was golden brown (about 7 minutes in my microwave) I swirled it around the casserole dish. I used a water bath and put the casserole dish in the empty pan on the stove door, I poured the flan into the casserole dish and then added the water to the pan and put it in to bake. It takes a little longer to bake with the water bath, just keep an eye on it until the center is set.

Delicious!! I love the simplicity of this recipe. I doubled the recipe, but used 1 Tbls almond extract instead of all vanilla. I love the way almond extract flavors desserts in addition to vanilla. I do the same thing with my sugar cookies & they are so much better. This recipe is a keeper!

Today however I changed it.  I didn't have evaporated milk in the house so I substituted coconut milk and added an extra egg.  It came out even more delicious

I was absolutely outraged with this recipe.. It told me it would be ready in approximately 1 hour or so, but after pressing its picture multiple times, no flan appeared on plate an hour later. I would give this 0 stars if I could, but my three year old daughter told me that she visualized flan in her dream once, so that's a plus. But the all American cherry pie tasted so good. 
Further more (see how fancy i am?), I would not do this again! *Insert heavy breathing*
ok, im done

My husband said this was the best flan he's ever had. I read many of the helpful reviews, since I'm an insecure cook.  The changes I made were minor:  I added two drops of lemon juice to the sugar, I used a water bath, and I used 6 custard cups rather than a 9" pie plate.  This made for a beautiful presentation. Making the liquified sugar was easier than I expected. I used a heavy saucepan, which may have helped, and shook the pan occasionally. I also had the egg mixture ready to pour, as one reviewer suggested. Can't wait to make it again!

Very easy to make and tastes great!  Second time I made this!  I followed  another readers tip and made the caramel in the microwave.  Place  1/2 cup of water in a two cup Pyrex measuring cup and add one cup of sugar. Place on high for. 7-9 minutes.  Watch carefully to get to Amber color.  Too long and it will taste bitter.  So easy and it came out perfect each time!  No worries about burning the sugar!

This is almost like my basic recipe except I add 5 eggs and 8oz of soften room temp cream cheese. Also for a nice change up I sometimes exchange the sweetened condensed milk for one can of cream of coconut. When I bake it, I bake it in a water bath. This makes it even smoother and creamier.

I used 5 eggs, as well as 2 tsp of cornstarch, blended everything. In hindsight will forego the cornstarch, as it came out a bit dense.  I also baked in a water bath. it was my first time making this.
Some caramel is still stuck on the dish, but most melted when I put the pie dish in a hot water bath before inverting.

I've used this recipe for a long time.  The only thing is that I use 6 egg yolks with one can of sweetened condensed milk and one can evaporated milk.  I don't use vanilla extract either.  

The caramel is the hardest part to make.  Patience stirring it until it becomes liquid, can take long.  Delicious!!!

I have been looking for a good flan recipe. Loved this! Tried another flan recipe from this site (baked flan) and it was too eggy. I used 3 egg yolks and only 2 of the whites for this recipe. This was so delicious. This will be made over and over.  Found the perfect flan recipe.

I added one extra egg for texture.  Slow and patient with the caramel syrup.  I also added about a tablespoon of water to the sugar for melting.....

My first time making flan and my husband loved it. He gave me the biggest compliment by saying it tasted like the one his Dominican mom used to make before she passed away. I reworked the recipe by using 4 eggs and I used the water bath when I baked the flan.

I took a bite and it was too sweet! I left the flan in the oven longer than the instructions said because I wasn't sure if it was done. The consistency was terrible. =[ It looked lumpy instead of the smooth texture I was looking for.

I followed the directions to the letter (and I am a fairly accomplished cook.  First I too was surprised it wasn't cooked in a water bath.  Putting it together was quick and easy.  I think 60 minutes of cooking is too long.  Much of the caramel over flowed onto the bottom of my oven, burning and smoking.  I let it cool as directed but it still wouldn't come out of the pan the next morning(I made it the night before and once it was cool I put it in the refrigerator).  Even if I let it come to room temperature and ran a knife around the edges, it didn't come out.  So I scooped it.  It was way over cooked.  The eggs were like curdled.  Overly sweet - though that didn't bother me as much as the texture.  It was not creamy at all.

This recipe was soooooo easy!!!!
Flan tasted amazing!
I did this receive twice one with 4 oz of cream cheese and am extra egg, since I like more of a creamier cheese cake flan and it came out really good

I also tried the recipe exactly , and it came out really good... It really doesn't need cream cheese it has that creamier texture already, but u can only notice it because the cream cheese one had a slight more creamier taste . Either one is good, i suggest everyone trying the recipe exactly first before modifying it.

Also u must do the water bath when it cooks! And I used a glass oven safe cookware dish for the flan 9.5 fit perfect!
Melter sugar in the microwave , came out great super easy added half a tablespoon of water ( no lemon juice) , came out good!

Must try!

When u take out the oven u must poke with a tooth pick (just like a cake) if it comes out clean its ready. In most cases 60 min is average but the other times I tried it was like 2 hours!!! I think it depends if u pour hot boiling water in the water bath or just regular water, that may take longer if u just pour cool water

But the tooth pick method is the best way to tell when to take out
And make sure ur glass dish is for oven use!!

I never had flan before, so I don't have anything to base the after-product against, but it was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was increase the eggs to 4 and use a water bath to bake it in.  It was so simple and delicious.  I didn't have problems with the caramel, but I have made dozens of batches for Christmas candy.  It took me about 20 minutes to melt the dry sugar but once the sugar wasn't lumpy it was the perfect coppery-color you want.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I don't usually change a recipe the first time but from reading reviews I decided I would.  I used the microwave to melt the sugar and added a half a cup of water. I let it go around 6 minutes, going 2 minutes the first 4 minutes and 1 minute at a time after that. I believe it was 6 minutes.  I let it get a bit darker then golden and it was perfect. I put all the other ingredients in the blender (using 4 jumbo eggs) then put the pan in another pan of water in the oven.  This turned out better then I had hoped.  My husband said it was better then any restaurant Flan he has had and bragged about it for a couple days. I think this is my new favorite dessert recipe! So simple!

This was a delicious and very easy recipe.  As other reviewers suggested I increased the eggs to 5, made it very rich.  I also increased the sugar by a 1/4 cup to make sure I had enough sauce (can't have too much of that! ;) ) I used a 9.5" pyrex pie dish.  Also, so you know you are doing it right, it seems that the sugar will never melt.  It kinda sits there and clumps, then it finally starts to melt in places, then clumps some more, but then hits that magic place where it all melts.  REMEMBER...this stuff is HOT, just a little will burn the snot out of you.  When you put it in the dish it will stick to the sides as it cools.  I also baked mine in a water bath.  Enjoy!

This Flan was the bomb.  I made it for my mom for mother's day and I can't wait to eat it with my family.  I would recommend using the water bath for sure! Just place your flan pan into a larger sized pan with some hot water into the larger pan with water that goes approximately half way up the sides of the flan pan.  Also, I would definitely recommend making the caramel in the microwave.  It's just  lot easier.  To do this, I put 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water into a glass pyrex bowl (but you could use any microwave safe container, glass is probably best though since it gets very hot.  Then i mixed the sugar and water and microwaved the mixture for 2 minute increments. I think it took about 5 minutes in my microwave total.  Keep an eye on it because you want it to be nice and light colored. Enjoy!!

As far as taste goes, this flan was delicious.
When it comes to making the caramel syrup, I would add a 1/2 cup of water to the sugar and allow it to come to a boil until it reaches the desired color, since this is much easier than waiting for the sugar to dry melt.
As far as cooking, I do not recommend covering the flan with aluminum foil. My oven actually caught fire at one point because the syrup on the bottom boiled to the top of the dish and out the sides ending up on the bottom of the oven and catching fire.

I have never made a flan before trying this one and baking is really not my strong point but I loved the flavor and texture of this one.  I did struggle a bit trying to get it out of the pan even with trying all the suggested tips.  Other than that, the recipe is easy and makes a nice presentation.  Thanks.

I've made this recipe a dozen times, and it's wonderful. Like others have said, a water bath is a must if you want the perfect texture. I've also made it with 4oz of cream cheese and lemon zest. It was amazing, too.

My son had an International fair project for school and chose Spain. We wanted to bring in Paella and Flan (Everyone makes a dish from their country to share for dinner at the end.) We used this recipe for it.
   I've never made custard, and I was intimidated to do this, but it was incredibly easy and turned out wonderful. Was also fun for my son to help with.
    I am not a "flan fan" but everyone who enjoys flan talked about how delicious this particular recipe was.

This was my first flan attempt. I used individual ramekins and the boiling water bath technique and it still came out delicious. It was "Finger-licking-good" and "da bomb" according to my guest.

Absolutely amazing!  I'm not a novice in the kitchen, but was a little nervous about making the caramel sauce.  I ended up taking the advice from the Perfect Flan article and mixing in 1/2 tbls of Lemon Juice.  I also took the advice of previous comments and used 5 eggs and blended the egg mix with my stick blender and baked it in a water bath.

A hit at a farewell party. The Flan turned out delicous. It had enough caramel so that it tasted very sweet and the consistency was perfect. I did add a tablespoon of vanilla so that the flan tasted more vanilla-y rather than egg-y and results turned out great. Although the caramel was hard to make, I got it on the second try. I would recomend a few drops of lime juice to the sugar and letting it stand without stirring on low-medium heat.

This was perfect.  I did add an extra egg, but it gave it an eggy taste - I would stick with recipe.

This was quite delicious.  I made it with 5 eggs (farm fresh from my chickens!), and mixed it in the food processor (be careful, it might overflow!), then baked it in a water bath.  My daughter asked for three helpings!!

YUM!  Easy recipe (now that I know how to do the sugar sauce).  I used 4 eggs and 4 oz. of cream cheese and it came out delicious.  The texture was good too.  Next time I will try it with only 3 eggs but still use the cream cheese.  I baked it in a water bath (as other reviewers suggested) for 1 hour and 8 minutes.  The four of us each had 2 pieces and cleaned the pie plate.  Will definitely make again.

I gave this a 4 because the flan itself was very tasty. This was my first time EVER to make flan. I do have a question if someone will be kind enough to answer. The caramel sugar mixture you make in a sauce pan tasted kind of weird to me and idk maybe I burned it but it was kind of bitter. Did I burn it or is this how its suposed to taste becaue my mom actually quiet enjoyed the flan entierly.

The first time I made this, I did not have the proper pan, so I made it in a tin pie plate. I used 5 eggs and like another reviewer had stated, it was too much like scrambled egg texture, but had a great taste. The second time I made it, I used the exact recipe in the correct pan, and it spilled out all over the bottom of my oven and made a horrible mess that smelled up the whole house. It was unedible. I would like to try it again, next time in the water bath once I got all the burnt pieces scraped out. There has to be a simpler way. :(

This recipe is perfect! It's easy & fast! They only thing I changed was the caramel syrup. After reading all the previous reviews about how difficult it was to make the caramel syrup w/ sugar on the stove top I decided to buy it in a bottle made already. It was delicious! I served it @ a dinner party & no one knew the caramel wasn't home made (& it was about $2 to buy in a bottle).. not worth all that trouble making it.. :)

I skipped the cup of sugar, added an extra egg and subbed the 14oz. can of evaporated milk with 1 and 1/2 cups of nonfat milk. My flan came out rich and creamy, with a nice consistency. This is a wonderful recipe because it's easy, flexible and delicious no matter how you convert it. Gracias!

So my son needed to take a flan to school for Mexican Independence Day. I'm an American living in Mexico so if I was going to make flan I needed to do an execelent job. After comparing the ingredients and directions of this flan and another recipe I found, I decided to go with this one. I made one in a 9 in. round and I made a really small one so that I could try it. I'm not a flan fan, but I had to taste it before sending it off to school. I didn't add an extra egg like many suggested, but I did add about 3 oz. of cream cheese. I put the cream cheese and a little evaporated milk in a blender before adding all of the other ingredients to the blender. I also used a water bath. The small one turned out perfectly. It was quite yummy. My husband and son loved it. The larger one took quite some time to bake. I stopped keeping track after 2 hours. Finally, I just turned the oven off and left it in there. I used a knife to go around the edges and turned in out onto a plate. I will definately make this again.

This is a great recipe!  One problem I had was the sugar took a LONG time to melt into the syrup, although that is probably the time is should take.  I would DEFINITELY suggest using an extra egg and DEFINITELY don't skip the water bath.  One other problem was that one hour was NOT enough time, if I were anyone using this recipe I would put it in the oven, cook for an hour, check, and if it is still watery then leave it in the oven and check it every half hour.  I didn't keep track of how much time it took me but it was easily 2 hours.  It might be because I am at higher altitude but I am not sure.  Other than that it tasted great!

Very tasty flan! This was a bit of hard work on my end when it came to putting the flan in a water bath. I did not have a roasting pan to use so I had to improvise. I use a gas stove so it was challenging to adjust the temperature. Otherwise it was very creamy. It was easy to invert once cooled. I left it out for 2 hours, it was really hot. I also used 4 eggs instead of 3 eggs. Took me almost 35 minutes to slowly melt the sugar in the pot on low. ( i have a gas stove). Lastly, the caramel somehow stained the bottom of my round glass pan and I am soaking it now to get rid of the brown stain...don't know if this is normally the way it is with baking flan? Maybe I just left it out too long or didn't refrigerate it after letting it cool down. Thanks for the recipe, it was a real good experience. will try it again.

First time making and it was easy. Only thing some spilled when I went to put in the oven and I only had a square pan not round. I think this makes a difference for the thickness too. The taste was great and I did add an extra egg and cinn. like someone suggested. Fiance who is Puerto Rican loved the taste, but said it needed to be thicker.

Flan tasted good, but I am disappointed that it has lots of holes inside like swiss cheese.  Another recipe I used from my sister gave my flan a very smooth texture.   I wouldn't need to go up here to vent about this, except I made a big batch and was hoping to give some to coworkers and presentation wise I am not happy.  Now I have to eat up all of this sugary custard.  The picture on the website is somewhat misleading.

Very good recipe.  The second time I made it, I did not use foil, I baked it in a water bath.  Also, I added a little cinnamon and a 2 dashes of nutmeg.  It started out a Great recipe, this just added a little touch.  Thanks for sharing the original.

Great flavor and super easy. It's a bit "harder" then what I expected (more of a bite then pudding). Will be making again - Thanks for sharing.

Yum! Holy cow was this recipe good & simple.   Only thing I would do differently is to literally pour the hot syrup right before pouring the egg mixture. I followed the recipe directions & ended up with the caramel completely stuck to the bottom of the pan when I inverted.

This is true, authentic-tasting flan. Just follow as is. Some reviewers suggested baking flan with yellow or chocolate cake batter on top...  well, here's another suggestion:  make 1/2 the flan recipe (use 2 eggs) in an 8" round, and make the cake (I prefer the yellow) in 8" rounds too.  Poke lots of holes in one of the cake layers (still in pan), and mix the remaining 1/2 cans sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk with 3/4 cup whole milk, and pour over the cake you've pierced. Now you have a quick, easy tres leches! (Save or freeze the other cake layer for something else.) Put both the flan and tres leches in the fridge for several hours... overnight, if possible. Once stable enough to handle, assemble the tres leches on top of the flan on a serving plate. Frost with sweetened whipped heavy cream, if you like. I love it without any frosting! Absolutely heavenly!!!

This turned out great even though it was my first time making flan.  I ended up adding water to the sugar and stirring while it cooked, in order to make the sugar carmelize.  I also added a little brown sugar.  One thing I wish I knew ahead of time was that the flan still jiggles when it's done cooking.  The best way to check whether it's finished is by sticking a knife in the center.  I did as others suggested and cooked it in a water bath.  I also blended the egg mixture in a blender, which was nice and easy.

I made this flan two different ways: 1. with 4 large eggs and cinnamon and 2. the original recipe. For me personally the original recipe is so much better. My family, two of which are toddlers, thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd option as well. The first one was good but the texture of it was simply not to mine or my family's liking. If you want the more custard-like texture follow the recipe as is, but if you want something more fluffy add more eggs.

The taste is good but there are a couple of things to remember.  Instead of a 20 minute prep time, it was more like 45 minutes and that was just melting the sugar into a caramel glaze.  I had to push the heat up to medium in order to get it to melt that soon.  You need to put the pie plate on a cookie sheet since it can bubble over while cooking.  The other problem is that you have to remove the foil at 60 minutes and check the center of the flan.  Mine took 70 minutes to cook because the center wasn't done.

So easy and delicious, I've always had trouble making the Carmel part but I followed another reviewers lead and used the micro i did add a few tablespoons of water in with the sugar and in five min I had the perfect Carmel the rest I threw in my mixer and mixed well I baked it in a water bath and had to add an extra 10 min baking time, we loved it!!! It lasted a total of 20 min will definitly make again:-)

I give this 2 1/2 stars. It was pretty easy to make and I had no problems melting the sugar-- I added a tablespoon of water and turned the heat down very low. I covered with tinfoil and made a very shallow water bath (in a cookie pan), but it still baked well, no cracks. It took about 30 minutes longer than the baking time, and like some others have mentioned, there is way too much caramel glaze. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, and overall I will probably not make this again.

So, this was my first time cooking the sugar and I ended up burning it....I will definetly try again.  The custard was a little bit eggy for me, so I think I will cut down on that as well.

Wonderful. I followed others and added one more egg for a total of 4 and cooked it in a hot water bath. I used by 8 inch square and when I check it after 60 minutes it was really, really liquidy. I cooked it for another 30 minutes and it was great. I put 1 cup of sugar in a fry pan on low heat and it took forever, by the time I spent a minute going to another room it got really brown. I tasted it and it seemed ok, but next time I'll be more careful. It just had a little tiny burned taste, but everyone ate it up. I'm going to make it again this week for a potluck.

I've been looking for "my" perfect flan recipe and finally found it!  I especially like that this recipe only calls for 3 eggs which is much less than most recipes.  I did "water bath" bake it though as I have always baked flan that way.

My husband loves flan, and I had never made it before... I decided to make it for a romantic dinner I had planned for him, and it didn't disappoint me! It was great!

I just threw all the custard ingredients into the blender and gave it a whirl.  My husband says it is just like our favorite Mexican restaurant's flan.  Just what I was looking for!

Came out great the first time!! I followed earlier reviews and swirled sugar instead of stirring, made with 5 eggs instead of 3, mixed in blender while sugar was caramelizing and baked it in a water bath.  It was perfect!!! Creamy and smooth, just as good as any restaurant I have had!!

I've made this a few times and it is great every time! As some suggested, I baked it in a water bath.  I also used 4 eggs instead of 3 which created a perfect consistency; not too eggy, yet firm and creamy. Some have suggested using brown sugar as a substitute for the white. Because of the molasses added to make brown sugar, when liquifying, the molasses can burn quickly and ruin the sugar syrup (I know cuz I did it!) White sugar works perfectly. I combined the egg mixture in my mixer and did not need to sieve. I have received rave reviews on this flan and it is easy to make with simple ingredients. Comes out perfect every time! This will be a staple in my dessert repertoire!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated but I did cook it in a water bath because I was afraid not to.  This was fabulous.  It turned out perfectly and was just sweet enough.  It was simple to make and I had all the ingredients here at home.  I'll make this again and again.

This was such a great flan recipe. My husband and I really enjoyed it and I can't get enough. What I did was beat the eggs in a bowl and then mixed the beaten eggs and everything else in a blender. I also used a Teflon pan for the flan and it turned out well, not any different than a glass one I don't think. I also did the water bath for the first time, and it seems to have worked. The http://engineeringllama.blogspot.com/2008/04/full-revised-spanish-flan-recipe.html website helped a lot.

This is THE BEST flan! My family loves the caramel so I use about 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of just the 1.

First time making Flan and it turned out to be easier then I thought.   I followed other peoples tips about putting evap., vanilla, and conde. milk in the blender.  The sugar was the only thing I wasn't too sure about, so I ended up putting a few drizzles of water.  I thought I burned the sugar but it was perfect.  This is a great recipe!

This is really easy to make and came out great.  The only thing I would change it the syrup. Instead of making sugar to syrup I would use regular caramel syrup and it tastes much better.

Followed the recipe exactly except added 1 extra egg.  The flan was not a smooth silky texture but had holes and was very think.  Will try recipe again but will do the water bath and shorten the cooking time next time to see if that'll make a difference.

Turned out pretty good, although it did need more time in my oven (approximately 80 mins). Nice consistency and taste, but I like the cheesecake caramel flan recipe from this site better.

This flan came out perfect! I took the suggestions from some of the other reviewers and used 1-2 drops of lemon juice when melting the sugar.  I also added an extra egg for a total of 4 eggs. Additionally, I baked it in a water bath and the whole cook time was more like an hour and a half with these changes.  An extra tip is to wait until the flan is COMPLETELY cooled before you attempt flipping it-I just took a plate and put it on top and flipped it over when it was cooled in the fridge for about an hour or so.  Great recipe-I have never made flan before.

This recipe sounded very easy, and it was my first attempt at making flan. My first impression was that there was too much sugar used! You would only need about half. I guess that's all personal taste.

The other thing that was quite important that got left out, though, was the fact that flan needs to be in a water bath while it is in the oven... something I didn't find out until -after- the fact! 

All in all this flan turned out alright, my coworkers liked it well enough, but it could be improved. Not bad, but not terribly impressive, either.

OH MY!! This recipe turned out sooo good!  I followed the custard recipe.  I made individual ramekins 350 for 30 minutes and chose to add a caramel sauce to the top. It is so yummy!! sweet but not sickly sweet. OHHHH my...that's all I can say.

First time ever making flan. Opted to make "Cup Cake Size Flan". I only put the sugar mixture on the bottom of the cup cakes and heated the cupcake molding at noted by other users before putting the sugar in it. Came out perfect except I will try and perfect making it creamy. Some of the flan's came out a bit bubbly but I think it was because I blended the mixture. My husband love it! I will definitely make again and never buy this at the restaurant because I can make it!

This was ok, but VERY sweet. I also felt it was a little bland, so we added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to jazz it up. I'm not the worlds biggest flan fan, but it was good, and got even better when it cooled and had time for the flavors to blend a bit. When the pie plate it was cooked in had cooled enough to handle I put a dinner plate upside down over it, held the two together and flipped. This makes inverting it so easy and not messy at all.

Very creamy! I put the mixture through a strainer while going into the pan to take some of the egg whites out so that it would be extra creamy. I also baked mine in a water bath so that it wouldn't crack. I usually make flan with 12 egg yolks but this is much better for you since it only uses 3 eggs and it tastes wonderful! Would definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

I was really afraid of trying to make something like this but it turned out really well.  The only thing is that there is quite a bit of caramel sauce but it was ok because half ended up with the flan, half stuck to the bottom of the pan in a hardened disk.  I baked at 325 in a water bath.  Definitely will make again.

My husband is Filippino, and Flan is a staple in their cuisine. I have tried several different recipes for flan, all of them needed too many eggs, or even egg youlks only, kind of expencive, But this is IT! Ridiculously simple! And equally ridiculously GOOD! My husband savors every bit of it. For the Christmas Season I added a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice - AMAZING!I am making it today for my hunny as Valentine's Day surprize. I might add a few drops of red food dye. We'll see.

Delicious and so easy you'll wonder why you haven't been making it for years.  I found that it tasted better and had a thicker consistency after sitting in the fridge overnight.

It is very had to get the sugar correctly and a pie pan is not the right size. It should be done in a water bath not just placed in the oven and probably not covered, cooked at 325 degrees and check to see when done with a knife coming out clean.  I followed the recipe instead of using my past experience and had the custard part boil over to the bottom of the oven and some of it was bubbly not smooth. Yes, I did check my temperature...it was what was suggested (350.  If I try it again I will use a larger container and also use a water bath.

The custard part of the flan was OK, but the "carmel" was just a big mess. It turned into a hard glass like candy on the bottom of the baking dish, and is difficult to clean. There must be a better way.

Definitely strain and bake in water bath. I used 6 ramequins instead of the pie plate and they came out wonderful. I had to bake them a little longer though, about 1 1/2 hrs. I just used a knife to separate them from the sides and they slid right out. Wonderful recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I enjoyed  this  recipe very much. Because I use metric  size  tins My can of evaporated milk was large then  amt  called for   so I used  4 eggs and it work great.  Instead of the caramel  I sprinkled dark brown sugar on the bottom of the dish and used the water bath  method of  cooking .  I will make this  again.

I normally do not like flan-I do not like eggs-but this however was so sweet and yummy it will now be one of my favorites. I however melted the sugar in batches it was easier and did not burn or become chunky-

Really an excellent recipe.  Of course I made a couple of changes.  I used about a pint of half and half to replace the evaporated milk.  I also added about a cup of cream to reduce the sweetness a bit from the flan. (Otherwise, the original recipe is too sweet for most palates)  However, even with my sweet tooth, the extra cream makes it perfect.  I also added a vanilla bean instead of the extract, and put in about 2 teaspoons of henessey to taste...left it in the oven after 60 minutes of baking for about 2 hours (till it's cool to the touch) and oh my god, what comes out is the best flan I ever tried...it should be called slap my momma flan...cause it's soooo good you just want to slap your momma...thanks so much for the recipe...

I've made this in the past, and was looking for the recipe again to make for Thanksgiving.  It's a great recipe.  Reading more recent reviews, I may add an extra egg this time, but otherwise...it needs no changes for perfection.

As a latina this recipe rocks. Once pour mixture in to your baking dish, put you dish in a larger one with water in it (bano maria).Once cooled ant out of the oven let flan sit overnight in the fridge. Serve cold....Delicous.....

This was an excellent flan.  Didn't change anything except I did use a water bath and poked holes in the aluminum foil. The texture was superb.  When making the caramel, I highly recommend using the largest diameter pan you have so the sugar is spread out in a thin layer.  It melts more quickly and evenly.  I had no problem melting it, it melted rather quickly and turned a nice light gold and I quickly used a spatula to pour it into a glass pie plate and quickly swirled it around.  YUM!!  Whatever is still left in the pan you cooked it in will cool and crack and makes a yummy candy treat for the kids!

The flavour was spectacular.  I've never even had flan before, nevermind making it myself, but I found this to be way more egg-y than I expected...  Kinda rubbery, almost felt overcooked?  Not sure what I did wrong -followed recipe exactly, except cooked in water bath, per the suggestions of others. I LOVED the flavour, but the texture was so bad that I likely won't try again without help.

I don't know if it's the way I cooked this, but the sides of my flan don't look as nice and smooth as those in the other pictures; however, the inside of it is very smooth and creamy. The changes I made were: I baked them in individual sized glass bowls and used 2 eggs for 4 servings. The bottoms of the bowls are small, so I tried to coat the entire bottoms and sides with the sugar (maybe a mistake?). Cosmetic differences aside, though, the flan tasted wonderful, though very, very rich. It would probably be fine with 1/3 less sugar. Also, I didn't use a water bath, but I'll do so next time.

I have made this three times and have gotten rave reviews every time.  The last time, I used the the suggestion from an earlier poster of putting the pie plate in the oven when preheating.  That really did help with keeping the caramel hot until it was completely spread around the plate.

I tried this with 4 eggs because I like a denser texture but I think next time I will do it with 3 because it was too dense for me. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that the flavor of the custard was a little bland. I will still experiment with this recipe and look for others till I find what I am looking for.

A fiend from San Salvador gave me this same recipe, with a few minor adjustments..using 4 eggs, 2 tsp lemon peel grated, and you can add 1 pkg of cream cheese if you like it sweeter like cheese cake..but is not necessary..wonderful just the way it is.. takes time however..and results are better on the stove with water, than baking.

I had never made flan before, and after reading the reviews I considered whether to bake it in a water bath or without.  I decided to make it without, as the recipe states, in order to give the recipe a fair trial.  As I was melting the sugar I kept the pan I was going to use in the middle of the stove top so the heat from the warming oven and the nearby burner would make it warm, to facilitate swirling the melted sugar.  That seemed to work fine. I did strain the custard as I poured it into the pan.  Near the end of the baking time my sugar bubbled over onto the bottom of the oven making a mess.  When I inverted the flan, some of the sugar remained on the bottom of pan, hard as a rock.  I'm wondering if I cooked the sugar too long, making it too hard.  The taste of the flan was very good, but I thought the texture was denser than what I've had in restaurants.  Overall it was a good experiment, and we certainly enjoyed eating the flan, but I doubt I would make it again.

My husband has been wanting me to make flan for as long as I can remember but I just avoided it for some unknown reason. It was so ridiculously easy! I even cooked it in the water bath just cause I wanted it to be perfect. Caramel was liquid, custard was not eggy at all, husband said it was just like mexican restaurant... I thought it was better. I'll make this a lot.

This flan recipe is the most authentic I have come across.  Delicious!  When you are baking it in the oven place it in a larger dish filled with water and this will help the process for the custard to cook properly.  The caramel is supposed to be a liquid topping when it is completed.  When you go ahead to put the caramel in the bottom of the pie pan, you will need to spread it quickly.  If it does end up hardening before you have it spread throughout it has cooled down too much so if you heat it up, it will become liquidy enough to spread again.

It's good but very sweet.   Since the condensed milk is already high in sugar, I suggest that you lessen the white sugar required in the recipe.

the flan tastes great, but I was under the impression that the melted sugar would make a hard crust on the top. I let it cool overnight and when I turned it onto the plate, the top was all liquidy and most of it ran off.  Maybe this is normal?

I followed the recipe as is and it didn't turn out that great. The flan itself tasted okay, but the top of the flan burned a little. The caramel stuck to the pan so it didnt come out as easy as it should have when i flipped it over. If I decide to try to bake this again, I will put it in a water bath.

I gave this recipe 2 stars because my husband really liked it otherwise it would have been 1.  It's HEAVY, very cake-like and way too sweet.  I'm Spanish, have had authentic spanish flan and this isn't it.

I dont know if I did something wrong.  I follow the recipe exactly and it came out very dense.  It taste alright but the texture is just a tad HEAVY! I think I prefer the box jello kind.

Whoa. It would’ve been nice to know I should’ve placed the baking dish on a cookie sheet. The sugar I had coated the dish with boiled out all over my oven. Glad I had a pizza stone that protected all the elements. Almost started a fire. I’m pretty angry.

Followed recipe to the T. Set my alarm to 60 minutes, went outside to shovel, and when I came in at 60 minutes, my caramel had been boiling over onto the bottom of my stove for God knows how long ... Not to mention, the flan is cracked.

Fun. easy recipe. I made this twice. However, I would remind people to use a 9 inch DEEP DISH pan to make this. covered with foil, it still managed to spill over in the oven when i used a shallow pan. The second time I forgot to cover with aluminum but I DID remember t put foil on the rack below for easy cleanup. So it was a bit more browned and not as custard-like but still delicious. Today is my third attempt. Just took it out of the oven-no spills, beautiful. Deep-dish 9 inch pan-covered in foil for baking.  My family loves flan.

For many years, my spouse's former favorite flan was made at a restaurant on the main highway between Texas and Patzcuaro, MX.  But he thought this one was even better.  And it looked beautiful -- certainly guest worthy!  I will make it again soon.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and didn't use a water bath.  The caramel started boiling and sputtering and as a result the flan looked like a huge mess.  The next time, I used a waterbath and it worked much better.  My advice to all:  USE A WATERBATH!

I love this recipe! I tried this recipe over 5 years ago and everyone loves it. Have made so many flans since then. I cook the sugar when it is just a caramel color and make sure you have your oven mits on when you pour the hot sugar in the cake pan. I learned the hard way. I've tried other recipes and this is the one=)

When incorporating all of the ingredients, I added an extra egg to it. I felt like it needed it. After it chilled, the density of the flan was perfect. I would only change the vanilla to half of the amount next time. It was a little too much for my palate. I still give this 4 stars.

This is a good recipe for quick and easy flan especially for beginners. However, as others have mentioned, texture is important. Its a little too stiff. Flan should have a more custard type texture (should be a bit more jiggly). 
It still tastes really good.

Love this recipe a perfect base for any starter. I became comfortable with this recipe as it only requires so little, so I have changed it up a bit ; I add 2 eggs instead- because my mother-in-law doesn't like to use a lot of eggs in her food- I also add coffee as my father always taught me this(Highly recommend adding a bit, gives it a more mature flavour) and it turns out perfect! I also don't do the caramelized sugar (just my choice, I think it doesn't need it). With those small tweaks it taste even more delicious!!! Alone, the recipe is also always great as is.

 ¡Buen provecho!

This is the best flan recipe!! A small change I made was add 1/4 cups of sugar when make the caramel to make sure you have a generous amount to coat the bottom & sides of the pan. Also, make sure to use a rubber spatula & a non stick pan when making the caramel.

I've been using this recipe for over 30 years,  except I use 4 eggs.  I prefer a firmer texture.  However, for over 30 years I would always struggle making the carmel. I make my flan in a double boiler, so I would always make the caramel in the top portion of the boiler, and I was lucky if I got it right after three tries. However, after reading the reviews for this recipe, I started to see that a lot of people made their caramel in the microwave. Well, let me tell you, last night I made this flan and I made my carmel in the microwave!!! Perfect!!!!!  Like others say,  you have to watch it, because as it starts to turn golden brown, it can turn really fast!!!

This is the recipe you’ve been looking for. I promise. 

On my first time, I forgot to put aluminum foil on it, and I put it in the toaster oven on the wrong setting. It still came out delicious, just a little too bubbly. My mom insists that it was perfect. 

I’ll make it again soon this time with foil and in the actual oven and I’ll post photos.

I had never made flan before, always afraid such a luscious dessert would be much to difficult or involved to make. Boy, was I wrong! This one didn’t require any ingredients I didn’t already have on hand, it was simple to make (after I’d read several tips on making the caramel sauce in the reviews), and it was so delicious there wasn’t a drop left after a small dinner party, mostly because everyone wanted seconds! 
This is definitely one you want to plan for at a minimum several hours in advance, especially if you prefer to eat it cold. I let it cool to just above room temperature then put it in the fridge for at least an hour.

Excellent flan.  Use bakers sugar as suggested, it does take a long while to melt. Be sure to keep the dish you are putting the flan in warm otherwise it returns to crunchy sugar immediately.  Water bath a must for baking.

Fabulous!   Like others I used a blender and used 5 eggs total.    I first whipped the eggs up then added the evaporated milk  and the vanilla.   When those were blended I added the evaporated milk.   No need to strain.

The caramel...I cooked my sugar in a nonstick pan over low heat until the sugar became a crumbly/rocky texture.    From there I poured it into my flan dish that had been in the preheated oven at 350 and placed it back into the oven.   I waited about 10/15 minutes until the crumbles melted into a smooth caramel that evenly coated the pan with no stirring on my part.   I added the egg and milk mixture and put both into a water bath.     Covered with tin foil and baked for 60 minutes at 350.    Super easy and delicious!

When I made it, it came out really crumbly. Although the taste was good, it wasn't really a good texture or appearance for a flan. I researched a bit into other recipes and they usually call for 
1) a water bath and 
2) way less baking time.
I don't know if it was on me, but I will be trying other recipes. 
One thing my mother said was that I used a bad baking sheet...

This was my first time making flan for my husband who loves it and I followed this recipe without making any changes other than accidentally over pouring a tad bit more than a tablespoon of vanilla extract and I must say that this flan came out phenomenal! I was sure to beat the eggs, milk, and vanilla really really well and the flan came out super smooth and creamy. I don’t think I’ll ever feel the need to make any changes to this recipe.

This was amazing.  And easy to make.  I did add 2 extra eggs based on other reviews.   I let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The texture was perfect and the taste was wonderful.

I have never baked the flan in direct heat, I always bake it in a water bath. Also, a flan is very easy to overcook! I bake it for 40 minutes then I start checking it every 5 minutes or so. You want to leave the flan a little jiggly in the middle, take it out of the over and leave it in the water bath so it can finish cooking outside of the over. An overcooked flan has a grainy consistency, whereas a flan that is cooked just right is nice and creamy. I also use 5 eggs instead of 3.

I have been craving flan for a few weeks and loved how simple this recipe was .... I made a small alteration by adding 5 eggs rather than 3 for a more firm texture, and I used brown sugar not white sugar  ... I however used a whisk to mix my ingredients and I wanted a more smooth consistency... I will absolutely be making this recipe again , and using a mixer to get a more smooth texture , also I found this to be very very sweet , not in a bad way , but I will use a little less condensed milk in the next batch to cut down the the sweetness and let you all know .
Thank you so much to the poster of this recipe my craving had been satisfied

Beautiful  consistency and not too sweet. I had to make this in a 9x13" and cut it into mini bites, so it's a little thin, but it came out  awesome!

I used 6 eggs, yes 6!  I first received this recipe from a friend and her recipe called for 6 eggs...the rest of the recipe was the same as this Spanish flan.  Because hers was so delicious, I used all 6 eggs, and a spring foam pan.  Next time I’ll use a 9 inch round because I want a more thicker piece of flan rather than thin one.

Followed recipe very closely with a slight adjustment in adding 2 more eggs.  Wish I would have baked in a water bath as others suggested.  Came out ok but not as silky as I hoped. Next time I will do it in  a water bath.

Delicioso!!! I made 100 mini flans in little tins for a party, they were perfect! So glad I found this recipe, it made it so much easier to put the ingredients in a blender and I also added 1 more egg and sprinkled cinnamon on top which ended up being the bottom!!!

This is the "Perfect" consistency and texture of flan. I'm SUPER picky with textures. I made this recipe after my boyfriend begged me for 2 weeks to make it. He had the first serving. Needless to say, it made him dance and say "perfecto!"

This will be a staple in our home.  And, for the record, I'm not a fan of flan but this has changed my mind. 

I must say, I will try bakers sugar next time for the caramelized glaze.

worst recipe I ever tried, EPIC FAIL. I followed the instructions to the T.  Everything seemed to go as expected...then, when the timer went off,  the flan was boiling (I understand that is not good), cooled it off to room temp, followed the instructions to sit the glass pan in a hot water bath...noooooope...would not come unstuck from glass pan...eventually parts fell down onto plate, at least 3/4 of it was stuck to the pan....what a disappointment....back to the drawing board..

To those having trouble with the sugar. A tip I learned in culinary school. Mix the sugar with a little water before cooking it. It keeps the sugar from burning. The water will evaporate before caramelizing and will give much better results.

This is a great recipe. I used a metal cake pan and the one I use was a bit to small. The caramel oozed out some but all in all great taste. I made it again in a larger pan and it was perfect. I will try mixing in some cream cheese next and experiment with lemon zest and orange zest.

Absolutely delicious flan! Agree with recommendation to warm the pan in the oven prior to pouring the sugar syrup. I placed the pan in a water bath. Placed a decorative spun sugar piece on top. Definitely a favorite! Thank you.

I was looking for an authentic tasting recipe to impress my Hispanic family and this was perfect! I added 2 tbsp of water and a few drops of lemon juice to the sugar mix to help with the melting process and it worked. I also added half a box of chocolate cake mix on the top and baked it altogether for 1 hour 10 min and made a Choco-flan or 'pastel impossible'. I also took the other reviewers advice on heating up the pans to help the Carmel syrup spread easier. Also hot bath after taking it out of the fridge to ensure an easy flip process!

i swirled the sugar directly in the (metal) baking pan.  used one extra egg YOLK (at room temp), dumped and vigorously mixed in the eggs and cans one at a time. 
 baked in a water bath. nice and creamy flan. ran a knife around the rim, let it cool a bit then inverted. some variations, some coconut milk, coffee, ginger, brandy in mix instead.

This is a great flan recipe! It's a bit tricky but once you get it right it's delicious. The first time I made it I just followed the recipe here and it came out a little overcooked. It comes out the best if baked in a water bath.

Awesome recipe. I read previous reviews before I started to make this so I changed a few things. First off I added 2 tbs water and a couple drops of lemon juice to the sugar while cooking in sauce pan. I also decided to cook in a water bath. While preheating the oven I preheated the water bath with the glass dish I am cooking the clean in. Doing this helped the sugar spread evenly when I poured it into the heated dish. I also combined the rest of the ingredients in a blender on low pulse and added an extra egg. Came out prefect!

Firstly I used a metal cake pan instead of a glass one. But most importantly I cooked the sugar on high for a minute then started spinning it in small circles until it was liquified. Once liquified I took it off the stove and spent the caramel around the pan on the sides until it started to harden and resist gravity. Then i let it cool for 5 minutes before putting my flan mixture in. Once it's in the oven I left it in for about 50 minutes until the flan no longer stuck to my knife.

I love this recipe, I used a latch pan and didn't close it right so it did come out flat because it leaked, but that is my fault. It tasted amazing everyone in my family loved it. It is very traditional flan, we are Puerto Rican and it tasted like it was from Puerto Rico.

A good flan. A tip on the caramel - it helps to add 1/3 cup water to the sugar before you even turn on the burner - stir until all the sugar is thoroughly moistened, and try to avoid getting sugar on the sides of the pan. Wipe the sides with a moist towel or rubber spatula to clean up stray sugar crystals, and then heat like usual. Never stir it, just swirl the pan gently to mix and avoid crashing out your caramel.

I made this three times and they've all come out well thanks to all the advice from other reviewers. Four eggs are better than three if you want a firmer flan and while patience is a virtue, you can speed up the caramelisation process by adding 1/4 cup of water and gently stirring on low heat. Bring to a boil when the syrup is somewhat clear and take off heat when it starts to turn golden. Putting the mould in a warm oven while you beat the eggs and milk also keeps the caramel from hardening too quickly (yep, that works :)). Good luck ;)

First time making  flan and this recipe is a winner. I like my flan eggy so I added 2 yolks.  Be patient when melting the sugar.  Keep on low heat and it will eventually fully melt and turn a dark caramel shade.  Immediately pour syrup in pan.   Tilt pan to get syrup on the sides but be careful because it is very hot.  I used a flan mold, which is great.  

Use a whisk to beat the remaining ingredients.  No need for a blender or mixer.  I placed the flan in a pan of water and placed in the oven.  The key is not to over cook the flan.  I cooked for 50 minutes than turned off the oven, opened the oven door a bit and left it in there for an additional 20 minutes.  Once the flan is fully cooled, place in the refrigerator over night.  Use a knife around the edges of the pan and invert  onto a plate.  A good flan will be smooth with no holes.

Maybe it was my fault. It took 3 attempts to melt the sugar. (Dry method, wet method and finally in the microwave) I found the texture to be less than the smooth I've had in others' flan. Mine had a bit of a scrambled eggs texture and it was way too sweet. It did flip out of the pan very easily however.

I made this per instructions. Tips, when puring the sugar, put down a piece of wax paper....easy clean up.  Tip #2, if,making individual flans, fill the cups about 2/3 full. They will expand when cooking and cleanup was difficult.

I followed the directions by artsychicany to keep the pie plate warm in the oven before pouring in the caramel and using a blender and it turned out wonderful. I'm making it again as a present for my son because he loves flan.

When I made it I had to make it twice. The first time it bubbled over in my oven, but I didn't have foil over it. Then when I made it a second time I put it in a deeper pan and put foil over it but it still bubbled over! It tasted good but it left a mess in my oven. If you want to do this recipe put it in a deep pan and hope for the best.

The recipe is written poorly and doesn’t give nearly enough direction on how to melt the sugar. It took me over an hour based on these scant directions, and by the time it sat for less than 2 minutes, it hardened. There are easier ways to make caramel for this type of application. The custard seemed to set okay, but the texture and flavor are lacking severely.

This was my first time making flan instead of trying others. I am very glad I found this recipe because it was perfect and came out great. I had it all to myself though because that's how I found out everyone in my house hates flan. Nonetheless, I loved this recipe. Thank you!

I followed the directions exactly.  It was a total failure.  A texture like a sponge.  Horrible.  Heat is obviously too high and the bowl probably should have been put into a water bath while it cooked.  I can't believe the picture that shows this recipe!

this recipe does not describe well how the flan should cook. read the comments of others about water bath and NO FOIL.  It is very grainy and bubbly without the water bath.  Also, avoid foam creating in the beaten eggs ...

So good! Made this for the first time just as directed. A couple of comments that might help others: 1. The sugar does take more than 30 minutes to melt at low heat, a setting of about a 3 on my stove top. It looks like nothing is happening for almost half that time but BE PATIENT. No need to stir. 2. You can preheat the oven and make the filling while the sugar is melting. For the filling, I used my smoothly blender and it worked great. When the sugar was a nice amber color, I poured into the baking dish and the filling right after. Don’t worry if the sugar gets hard after you pour it. It will remelt in the oven. 3. MAKE SURE your baking dish is not too shallow. This was my case and the flan didn’t hold its form very well. It was so thin it absorbed too much of the syrup and didn’t have that creamy look inside. And even though it was covered, the syrup boiled over while baking because of the shallow dish. None of that ruined the flavor however. It was ugly looking but tasted amazing!!!!! Now... to get all that hard candy from the bottom of the oven...

Seemed easy to make. But instructions don’t indicate how hard it is to get out of the pan. “Let cool and flip it over”, not gonna happen. Thanks though!

Thank you for the tip of microwaving the sugar with one cup sugar and half a cup of water in a Pyrex glass !! It helped big time! I saw my sugar turn to the amber color after about 6-7 mins . It tastes the same as doing it on the stove but it is so msuch easier this way. 

I used 4 eggs instead of 3.

Thank you for this recipe!

First time making flan. Good recipe, but I thought there was too much vanilla. It certainly smells good, but it can be overwhelming. In the future, I would decrease it to 2 tsp. I also baked in an 8 x 8 glass dish than was placed in a water bath. I slightly overbaked mine and got those unsightly bubbles on the side, so I would take it out around 40-45 mins. Mine was a bit on the firmer side, but still smooth and creamy inside.

First time making flan and this recipe was easy and delicious.  The only challenging part was carmelizing the sugar .... I followed instructions exactly used a blender to mix ingredients and used a water bath covered lightly with foil .. no issues

The posted recipe leaves a lot of vital information out. I've made it twice. Once as instructed, once with the advice from the reviews of the recipe. 
Changes in second try::
1) slowly beat eggs with little whisk, while slowly adding ingredients. DON'T OVER BEAT YOUR EGGS
2) don't stir the sugar, just swirl the pot. Cook it on a 3/4 to prevent burning. 
3) use a water bath!!! It saves the dish every time!!!

Now, the second one came out absolutely delicious. The picture added is the first one, clearly over beaten with an electric mixer. (I only used speed 1, and it was super powerful. )

Eaay to follow. Used a flanera, so made the sugar right in there on the stove. After the caramel hardened a bit, just poured the custard right in. The texture was so smooth! My husband loved it!!

Excellent!  Used four eggs. Nice custard consistency. Be patient with sugar as it melts. Don’t stir or even tip pan as it will make pieces of rock candy. Don’t worry about perfectly coating baking dish because it all evens out when it cooks. Definitely needs water bath or it will curdle. Luckily I had made it a long time ago and remembered that.  Forgot to cover with foil and it was fine. Also chill before flipping onto serving platter. Flipped too early on one flan and it slipped into a pile. Still yummy but not pretty! This also releases more of the sugar syrup though I still lose a lot to the dish for some reason. Best to chill overnight.

I am a first-time flan maker and it turned out great!  I did, however, take some suggestions from the other reviewers and use 4 eggs, used my blender to mix my ingredients, and made the caramel in the microwave with 1 cup of sugar, just enough water to make it look like wet sand, and about 3 drops of lemon juice.  I felt I had a little more control of the browning of the caramel.  I used a water bath, cooked it for the full 60 minutes.  When I went to get it out of the pan the next day after refrigerating overnight, I put down in a pan of boiling water to loosen up the caramel a little.  It was fantastic!  Definitely will be making again--Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

I followed this recipe before and the results were delicious. However, I've made flan multiple times since then and I find that when you blend the main mixture in a blender and bake the flan in a water bath instead of what is shown in the video, it comes out the best for me. I would recommend making the flan the night before because it is much easier to flip it out onto a serving dish then.

But like i said this is not something i cook often so i went with what it said.   i learned my lesson. next time cook in a water  bath. very disapointed

Perfection on my 2nd try! So creamy yet solid. My 2nd try I followed the recipe completely except I only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  I am so happy I found this recipe because we are addicted to flan. My first try I followed what a reviewer said and used 5 eggs, which made the texture way off. I will stick with the recipe, but reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup is perfect for us. (Also I cooked it in a water bath).  Yummy!!!

First off, if you don’t want scrambled eggs YOU MUST BAKE IN A WATER BATH. Its the only reason I give this recipe 4 instead of 5 stars. I personally already knew this about baking custards, so I was lucky enough not to make the mistake. Water baths make them bake smooth and with little to no bubbling. The tin foil cover is good too, but it won’t prevent the scrambling. A water bath is when you place the flan/custard baking dish inside a larger baking dish that has hot water filled about half way and rises up to surround the flan dish when inserted. First boil water. Then place the larger dish on the oven rack and pour in the water. Finally, submerge the flan. If the water does not rise to the edge just add more hot water from the tap. Bake as directed and enjoy.

My first attempt at flan... Based on some reviews, I added 1 egg (4 eggs total instead of 3) and also added 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese.  Microwaved the 1 cup sugar with 1/2 cup water in 2 cup measuring cup for 8 minutes to an amber color, super easy, just be careful.  Cooked for 1 hour and 10 minutes in a water bath.  It came out really good!  Next time it'll be awesome with a couple minor tweaks... I will keep it at 3 eggs and bake for 60 minutes to get the consistency a lil more jiggly.  I think the 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese was helpful and plan to keep it in next time, as well as continue the water bath and micro'ed caramel syrup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

It came out a little tasteless, I think I would add more vanilla or another extract next time, or maybe double the caramel and let that sink into it. I had no trouble with the caramel (I've made it before) but the filling did bubble over and spill onto my oven (my fault, forgot the pan was an 8"). I tried the trick mentioned by another reviewer to let it sit in a pan of hot water before turning it over, but this just left it overly warm and it came out misshapen.

The recipe was very simple. It turned out very nice. However, I think the quantity was extra for the 9in dish I had. When in the oven, the sugar syrup spilled outside on the tray.

First off, I appreciate that this is even on here but the simple fact is that  this recipe did not work for me. Secondly I  I followed the recipe exactly how it was written. I was really looking forward for this to work for me, but this recipe was a complete fail.  For all the people who gave the five stars yeah,  I want to see proof of how you made it. Perhaps you guys enjoyed it because of the taste? Why did mine turn all crusty? What did I do wrong? I want answers. I am fed up with this, I love flan, everyone was looking forward to wait now I’m like a laughing stock. Getting one star from me, Disappointment.

We love flan but ordering at various restaurants has not met our expectations. This recipe was incredibly easy and will definitely be repeated whenever we want flan. It is so smooth & creamy. The texture is even smoother after a night in the refrigerator. Yum

I love this recipe. I’ve used it quite a few times. I don’t add water when I caramelize the sugar. Just sugar on medium / high heat until brown. Be careful not to burn yourself.  I don’t cover the flan with aluminum. I cook the flan in a water bath. Perfect consistency.

Best recipe I’ve ever wen through. Cheap and easy to make. The whole family pressures me to make more and I don’t mind it at all, it’s a great dessert to have around. After several attempts and trimming, the best advice I can give for an excellent flan is to use 3 eggs, one entire can of sweet condensed milk (I used the Carnation brand), one can of evaporated Carnation milk and five drops of vanilla extract (if you’re using pure extract, trim it to 2-3 drops). I used a not la 8inch baking pan so I added water to a separate pan and placed it under the flan. 360 degrees for 45-50 min, just enough to bake it to a firm, wiggly texture. Leave it out to cool for 5 min then refrigerate for 3 hours. I adjusted this process my own way but I couldn’t have done it with this helpful recipe.

I made this last year and it was perfect. some have said that they prefer to add more eggs but I liked how light this came out.   Also, I loved that it was not overly sweet and how can I say that this has to be the cheapest desert ever.

I loved flan/pudding ever since I can remember but never tried making it. I used this recipe for my first trial of flan and it turned out great. I divided the ingredients by three because I was using small cans. Definitely recommend!

This basic recipe is easy and delish!   Please do not hyperventilate over making the syrup.  Using a pyrex bowl with a handle that holds at least 3 cups, mix 1 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of water.  Cook the mixture in the microwave on high for 7 minutes or until the syrup changes to a rich amber color.  Then pour the caramelized syrup into the 8 servicing dishes.   It's that simple!  Also, I recommend placing the ramekins on a thick layer of napkins, then filling the tray about halfway up the sides of the ramekins with water.  The texture of the flan is smooth, creamy...with no bubbles.

Great base recipe, an additional steps that seems to help keep the bubbles away is to sift the custard, tap the tin to shake all the bubbles out and place it in a bath while it cooks.

I have made a couple variations of this recipe: 1 had orange juice. 1 had lemon juice. 1 had cinnamon. I've also added a pinch of salt to the caramel as it cooked and 2 pinches to the custard. Those are currently cooling so we shall see if they taste as good as they did prior to cooking. 


Update: well, the lemon curdled the batch I added it to... the cinnamon one was closer to what I wanted but I need to take it out 5-10 mins earlier.  Going to do some more research on lemon custards and how to avoid that curdling effect. To be continued.

First be VERY CAREFUL with pouring hot caramel into a glass container. Our glass pie dish shattered, and we just spent over an hour cleaning up glass shards and chipping away at hard caramel on our floor and counter. Not to mention my wife was burned and cut by the caramel and glass when it shattered.

We plan to try this recipe again, but NOT in a glass dish.

My neighbors loved this so much they made me promise not to wait until the next Cinco de Mayo to make it again. I tried it for Bacon fest and added some bacon to it - I like it better without the bacon.
Only hard part and I think it is my inexperience is getting the caramel the right consistency. By the time the 'lumps' are out, it seems to be at hard crack stage and when it hits the pie plate, it hardens before spreading completely. I think warming the pie plate will help. Any suggestions?

The first time I made this flan, I followed the instructions and found it a bit runny. The second time, I added two more eggs and it was perfect. That's the way I do it now and my friends are always happy.

I was nervous about making flan but I'm so happy I found this recipe and read the comments! Here are the changes I made: 

 I combined the sugar and about 1/4 cup of water in my glass measuring cup and microwaved on high until the sugar started to get a little color. (About 5 minutes, but microwaves vary.)

I kept my glass pie dish in the oven until I was ready to pour the melted sugar in. 

I used 1 extra egg and blended all ingredients in the blender. 

I used the "Bain Marie" method for the full 60 minute cook time. 

Cooled overnight. 

I had to make this flan 2 days in a row per my family's request. This recipe is a keeper!

Went out on a limb and made this recipe never having made or eaten flan. It was a bit stressful not knowing what the texture should actually be. I followed recommendations from other reviewers and added one more egg. I baked in a water bath partially covering, cooled and refrigerated overnight. Being unsure, I removed it in the morning to a cake plate with sides. Success! It kept well until serving time covered tightly. Served surrounded by raspberries and blackberries at a paella party with excellent feedback. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

The basic recipe worked well. I used 3 eggs but added half a package of cream cheese which was outstanding. The caramel sauce recipe I wouldn't bother with - first, you'll burn yourself, and second, it hardens into an awful mess. Instead I made a regular caramel sauce with sugar, butter, milk -much easier! I will definitely make this again.

I was SO nervous about trying this recipe but am no SO excited about how wonderful it turned out!
After reading the reviews, I made the following changes:  used 4 eggs instead of 3, made the caramel by heating the sugar in a 2 cup glass measuring cup with a few teaspoons of water.  Cooked for 2 minute increments x 2, then checked after every 15 seconds or so until it was caramel colored (burnt it the first go round!). Poured the caramel into a warm deep pie dish and cooked it in a hot water bath (boiled water and added to a roasting pan about halfway up the pie dish) for 65 minutes. Muy bien!  So creamy and delicious! I can't wait to make it again and again!

Horrible. Followed the recipe - and ended up with just slightly more then would fit in my 9 inch round baking dish, so I threw some away. Recipe doesn't say that the flan will puff up and stick to the foil. And because it's so full, the sugar boiled over making a mess. BUT the biggest problem was that it had a texture like an eggy sponge - not smooth like most people want flan to be.

My husband and I loved this flan. I made it exactly as written but I did bake it in a water bath recommended by other reviewers. It cooked in 58 minutes. I will make it again as it is my hubby's favorite dessert.

This recipe is outstanding. Like others mentioned, my only alteration cooking the dish in a water pan.

The caramel is the trickiest part, but that hasn't stopped me from making this several times. Just stand by the pot, be patient, keep the heat low enough, and stir. Your boredom will be rewarded.

Very pleased with this recipe.  I´ve never made flan before, eaten it a million times, just never made it.  Today, I decided to give it a try for the first time.  I opted for this simple recipe and, thankfully, I wasn´t disappointed.  I did it in a water bath and had no problems making it whatsoever.  I wasn´t sure when to take it out, and although I baked it for a lot longer than the recipe called for it still turned out great.  I impressed myself lol...my husband loved it too.  This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks a million to the person who shared this recipe!

I was excited to make Spanish Flan for a cultural project in Spanish class. However, melting the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat took 40 minutes of constant stirring. I read reviews of this recipe beforehand, and I found that melting the sugar should take only 10 minutes.

I am not a fan of flan normally, but this was very good. The caramel was hard to make because I didn't know what to look for, but even though I got burned by it, it turned out really well.

For those struggling with their caramel hardening right as it goes onto the pan: No need to warm up the baking hand beforehand. Just add about 3 tablespoons of water with your sugar when you make the caramel. Swirl the pan around gently just enough to mix the sugar and water, and then leave it alone on medium heat. Once it starts to change color, swirl the pan around evenly until it is a nice amber brown. Turn off the heat and pour it into the pan. Immediately swirl the baking pan around to coat it evenly with the caramel. (optional: if the caramel is still too thick, add a bit of hot water after your caramel reaches the amber brown color and swirl, making sure to put the pan away from you to avoid getting splashed by the hot caramel)

It took a little bit to get the Caramel going, but once I adjusted to the wet method with water and lemon juice it worked out just fine. Had the flan in the fridge for 36h before serving at it was delicious. It's some work but definitely worth it.

Excellent recipe! I made two modifications: reduced sugar for syrup to 1/2 cup and it was plenty, and I added an extra egg. The reason for the extra egg was because other recipes on this site call for 5 eggs and some reviewers thought 3 eggs weren't sufficient; so I took the advice. Used the blender to combine ingredients. Baked with water bath, let cool, inverted, and left overnight in the refrigerator. The result was a sublimely perfect, creamy, and smooth flan!

Unfortunately, we did not like this at all.  The consistency was not what we consider custard-like.  On the positive side, thanks for the tip on carmelizing the sugar.  It worked great!

It took a few tries before I got this right, so worth it in the end. I placed the flan in a water bath when baking, this seemed to prevent it from over cooking.

awful. First try at melting the sugar turned into a solid molten blob of rock candy that melted my mixing spoon. Second try -- same thing. Sugar did not melt as recipe indicates, and I patiently took my time! Checked a couple of other flan recipes, both of which included liquid with the sugar to aid in the melting process. I added water, which helped, but still not great. Very unsatisfactory result with the filling too. I'm a decent cook, so I was pretty horrified at the results of this recipe! Next time -- I'm buying flan from a local Mexican grocery store!

Flan is my favorite dessert and have spend lots of money buying from bakeries. Because I am now in a tight budget I decided to make it myself. Wow it was so good and if it wasn't I would say it. I follow all the directions. I see why others would had a problem with the caramel. You have to use a non stick pan and put it on medium and don't touch it until the sugar become liquidity. You just have to keep an eye that it doesn't burn. The only thing I did different was the baking. I used an aluminum foil container, cover with aluminum paper and made wholes, bake in a water bath and after 45 minutes I check to see how firm it was. I cool it for 30 minutes and put it in the freezer for another 30 minutes then put it on the fridge overnight. It came out firm and creamy. It didn't have an eggy taste which I love. This will be my go to dessert recipe from now on.

Made it with 5 eggs as it's closer to the traditional texture I wanted. Doesn't need a cup of sugar for the caramel I had tons left over. Maybe half a cup.

Pretty standard flan: however, I would also add a teaspoon or so of water to the sugar mixture in order to keep it from burning! I usually end up burning it once or twice every time I try to make this, so thus, the water.
Additionally, I only used egg yolks for the custard portion, then I strained it through a sieve in order to get a more solid texture.
I make this so often it's not even funny to be honest.

The only thing that I will suggest is that you put a tray or heavy aluminum foil under your dish to prevent the sugar that spilled over while baking to prevent smoke from the burning sugar and to keep your oven clean!

Loved it... Turned out perfect!
Followed these Tips: "Keep your baking dish warm/hot in the oven while you make the flan, so that when you do pour your caramel (melted sugar) into it, the caramel doesn't harden as quickly. When melting sugar, be patient and keep the heat LOW because the sugar may brown too dark. Don't fret if you still have small lumps of sugar in the end.. they will desolve when you bake the flan. As for the flan mixture, blend everything in a blender (adding the condensed milk last because its thicker) for the most effective and fastest way of mixing."
I added an fourth egg for density, otherwise  followed the recipe .
Good flavor, plated nicely, served with coffee and fresh fruit... Everyone loved it!

The longer the flans in the refrigerator the more the sugar will melt so when you flip the flan you will plenty of caramelized sugar syrup to cover the flan on top.  You can make coffee flan too by just adding instant coffee or Kahlua coffee liquor to the mixture before baking, always bake in a water bath. I've added rum to my flan too.  Banana flan too. Coconut flan too.

Yummy! A daunting dish, I am surprised at the result. The flan is beautiful and tastes creamy with few bubbles throughout. My flan released cleanly from its dish and presents and cuts beautifully. It is not noticeably sweet, even with all the sugar called for.

My flan was baked in an approx. 1.5" water bath (baño María). I used three large brown eggs, and vanilla was omitted. My flan was baked in a 10" metal round and cut with a knife around the circumference before removal from its baking dish.

Blissfully simple and beautiful and creamy!

This was a great opportunity for me,a 12 year old, to make this Flan. It tasted great. The hardest part was making the caramel. From past experiences of making Flan, with my grandma, this one needs just a little work with the caramel. The Flan was a bit to caramelly.

This recipe was an absolute fiasco! The caramel in the bottom of the dish was like cement when tried to invert it onto the plate. I had to reheat it to get it out at all and it was a total mess. A few tips on how to do this would have been nice.  Not nearly as easy as I was led to believe.

Followed the recipe and it was delicious!  Made for a dinner party and it was a hit.  Only suggestion is to do a water bath - I didn't and set off our smoke alarm and made a big mess in my oven.  I used a 10 inch quiche pan but it still overflowed.

I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and made it with 5 eggs (plus a little whole milk) and cooked it in a water bath.  It came out perfect - everyone was so impressed.  Served with a Mexican-themed dinner for 25 guests.

I followed this to a T, and even did it again to make sure I did it right.  I was really wanting to try Flan for the first time, since I never had it before, and this is the most popular recipe I could find online. It just tasted like sweetened scrambled eggs, andit was really gross. The three other people I had try it with me didn't like it either. I really can't tell if I did something wrong or not since I've never had flan before, but I definitely wont be doing it again with this recipe.

Just made this recipe for my kids and they loved it! (Especially my five year old daughter who cried  when she finished it all and I told her there was none left)  Another thing to mention- if you add a pinch of mustard to the caramel sauce it gives it a bitter flavor that is amazing! 
Love this recipe!

I ended up combining this recipe with another when I made my flan, so I doubled the number of eggs and added an ounce of cream cheese.  I also did a water bath as well, which I would recommend for any flan.  It was a little bit too eggy, so three eggs was probably perfect.  Other commenters have said that making the sugar syrup was difficult, however, I used raw cane sugar and it was extremely easy.  Hot tips for making this flan: use a two-quart baking/pie dish, use raw cane sugar, add cream cheese, check it frequently as it bakes.

I am Cuban and I was looking for a traditional flan like my grandmother used to make. She and my mother were born and raised in Cuba. Cuban flan and Mexican flan are completely different. Whenever she would try to teach me though it would always be different and she would never measure. Now that she has passed, I regret really paying attention. I wanted something with the buttery, rich taste I grew up knowing. I found it! I added 1 extra egg to this recipe and that's it. This is definitely a keeper and tastes just as good as grandma's.

SO easy and delicious. I made individual ramekins instead of one large one and my dinner party loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good! I added 2 extra eggs because I just like the texture that it adds but the flavors from caramel and condensed milk really made this a hit at dinner. I almost wanted to lick the pie plate after, it was so good.

Loved it because it is made from only a few ingredients that I usually keep on hand, easy to prepare either in a blender or mixer, and can be made in advance.  The first time I made it I worried about turning it out.......never stuck once, and I've been making it often since.

Oh my God, this is terrific.  I do recommend that you use a DEEP DISH because the syrup will cook over, and you have a mess to clean up.  That's one thing I will change for next time - use a bigger pie plate!  That's okay, that's why I have a self-cleaning oven, windows, and fans.  (burned sugar fumes...)  The flan was worth the lesson.

I made this for my grown son's birthday (cake) - it was a huge hit.  When we lived in San Diego, we used to get the most delicious flan.  Back in our hometown in the Midwest, I wanted to make a great flan, and this was excellent.  Made it exactly like the recipe - 3 eggs only, and I poured the custard mixture through a sieve into the baking dish.  When making the caramel, I used 1 C sugar + a generous "squirt" of fresh lemon juice.  Heated slowly over medium heat - NO stirring!!  When liquid, poured into a warm glass baking dish and swirled to cover the bottom.  Before baking, I covered with foil, put in a large roasting pan, added hot water 1/2 way up the baking dish.  Baked for one hour, cooled, then refrigerated.  Couldn't have been more perfect.  Silky smooth and just delicious!  Absolutely rivals any I've ever had!

After reading the reviews I did several things differently.

I used the microwave method of carmelizing the sugar which was perfect and I would not consider doing it any other way.  I put 1 cup of sugar in a pyrex measuring dish and added ½ cup of water, stirred the water and sugar, and then microwaved.  Initially high power for 4 min, Stirred once with a wooden spoon, then 2 min increments (no more stirring) until golden brown/amber color.  Took about 8 minutes.  I had the ramekins sitting in a pan in warm water and then poured in the sugar and swirled to coat the bottoms and a little of the sides.

I used the blender to mix the ingredients.  I put the eggs in first and blended them, then added everything else.  Worked great, well mixed.   Very easy to pour into the ramekins from the blender.  This recipe was enough for 8 ramekins.

My big conundrum was about how long I should bake the flan.  In the reviews the baking times ranged from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  I initially baked 30 minutes then added 10 minutes then added about 5 minutes twice.  So I think ultimately baked it for about 50 minutes.  I think that was a little long.  The flan tasted great and was nice and firm, but I think could have been a little creamier if baked a little less time. So, maybe 40-45 minutes would be better next time.  Some reviewers said it should be a little jiggly in the center when you take it out of the oven. Mine was not.  Others said the knife should come out clean, my toothpick never did,

As flans go, this is a good recipe.  I did add more eggs (2) which made it a bit eggy, so maybe better to keep with 3 eggs.  As far as making the caramel, I do agree with a reviewer that recommended adding water just enough to cover the sugar and have it look like sand.  This is how the professionals do it.  But, be sure not to stir it because if sugar gets on the sides of the pot it crystallizes.  So, put in sugar in the middle of the pot, spread it out a bit, then add some water.  Poke it with a knife or such to get all the sugar under water.  Follow instructions of letting the sugar boil at the lowest heat possible without stirring it and watch for the color to change.  Once it starts turning color, you can ensure even color by swirling the liquid in a circular motion just by moving the pot in a circular motion.  Let it get a solid amber color, be patient.  I didn't warm the ramekins as one suggested, wasn't necessary.  Just spooned in the caramel and tilted the ramekins immediately to have it settle evenly.  Not really a big issue because when you warm the ramekin later the sugar (more instructions forgotten in the recipe) will liquify and allow you to invert it onto a plate.  Even though I used individual sized ramekins, it still took 60 minutes for the custard to cook so that there was just a small jiggle in the middle.  I did place the ramekins on a thin towel inside a roasting pan and filled the roasting pan with hot water up mid-way on the ramekin.  This may have mad

WATER! ADD WATER!!! The flan was fairly successful. Except for the caramel. I was having a difficult time until I looked up how to make the caramel the consistency necessary and every single site said to add water to the sugar. When I did so it was much better. Oh. And let the caramel set/cool a bit in your dish first before adding the flan mix.

It was so easy and delicious. After reading many reviews, it appears that some people complained of the consistency. Please understand flan can be creamy or more gelatinous depending on the country and its region, at times.  Excellent taste.

Disclaimer: I don't like flan in general, but it was my mother's birthday and this is her favorite dessert. I had never attempted a dessert like this before, but she said it was perfect! Not too eggy, not too sweet - and the caramel sauce came out perfectly. On the recommendation of another reviewer, I made the caramel sauce in the microwave: add water to sugar until it reaches "wet sand" consistency, then microwave it (stirring frequently) until it  reaches a golden brown color (about 3 minutes for me). I also backed it in two smaller Pyrex dishes and a waterbath at the same temp, and both were still done in 60 minutes.

I added vanilla bean and used a hand mixer to mix the eggs, milks, and vanillas. I also placed tinfoil covered round pan in a baking sheet with some water.  Listen to the recipe, cool COMPLETELY.  This help with the consistency.

I always loved growing up having flan in our home, of course being cuban, we always used more eggs to obtain that custard texture and richer flavor.  You may wish to try using the water bath version, otherwise this recipe was pretty good .., thank you. :o)

My first time making flan and I got rave reviews from my family, with my stepdaughter saying it was the best she has ever had; in which she has Hispanic heritage on her side. Simple and straight forward recipe that was easy to execute. In addition, the tips from reviewer Artsychicany (beauty & culinary skills) made it even that much simpler and perfect! This will be my flan recipe!

Well I have eaten flan many times and, I have made it once or twice.  I noticed this recipe did not use the bath water, but I thought well with all the reviews and ratings I'm sure it will be fine.  It wasn't  it looks like tan cottage cheese it doesn't taste terrible ,but it looks awful not creamy like a custard. This recipe should add the water bath as a must do. I will try it again and see ,but don't bother making it without water bath it's pointless.

This is seriously the best flan recipe I've found, people who don't like creme caramel still end up liking this flan. I've made it as is and it's turned out perfect but when I don't have evaporated milk I've substituted 2 cups whole milk and used 4 eggs and it's turned out perfectly. Also sometimes forget to use the foil, didn't notice any difference. To make it a bit different I usually put some cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg in with the sugar while it's caramelizing, smells so nice when it's done!

I made this yesterday and did not like it but maybe I did something wrong.  I was not nearly as thick as the picture but very flat.  I did not use the water bath.  Could that have been the difference?

Delicious and absolutely easy to make. Two advices for newbies: Remember it's a liquid that's going in, so make sure you can keep it stable when entering the oven (It's not that evident when you have tinfoil covering it). The second is: Double this dish!!! So so so delicious and holds good for a week so you'll have tons of time to delight on this.

I added a little too many drops of water, so the syrup did not come out as golden as I like...be very careful when making the syrup 1-2 drops is enough.I followed suggestion by oven heating my ceramic dish in oven while making the custard and baked in a water bath. it was delicious.

I have made this recipe many times , I put the sugar in a pot on low and cover it . While its cooking I make the plan, I be,I've that while that sits the bubbles disappear . I uncover the sugar and hope for the best.  If it's not all melted it's ok because it will liquidate

I added a little orange zest and used 6 oz custurd dishes, came out so good. This recipe is nice and creamy. Definitely cook in a water bath also, keeps edges from over cooking.

My advice is:
1. Preheat along with water bath at 350F and lower it to 320F once you put in the custard bowl to bake. 
2. To make it creamy use half and half or heavy cream. Also, use more egg yolks more than whole eggs. 
3. Use small baking dish; preferably ramekins or tea cups
4. I use granulate sugar rather condense milk for less to remember to buy. 
5. Make sure to strain through sieve to make it less bubbles and more creamy smooth consistency.
6. Don't use blender at all for making too much foam and bubbles that cause "holes" inside your flan.
7. Use toothpick (insert and out should be clean) to check rather just shaking the flan at the end of baking to cause less water bath spillage.

I love flan but this was my first attempt at making it. I followed the recipe exactly but followed some of the tips I read: I used a blender to mix the ingredients, I made the caramel in the microwave and I cooked the flan in a pan of water. It came out perfect! Light, creamy texture and wonderful flavor. I will be making this often. It was such at hit at the party I brought it to, there was none left.

I love this recipe….have made it several times, and my mom has requested that I bring it for Christmas this year.  

I make the caramel sauce in the microwave as another person suggested, and let it cool there….keeps me from getting any hot sugar burns!

I followed directions and used a reviewers suggestion for water bath while baking. It was way too sweet, and will cut back on sugar next time. I plan to make this again and hope for a better result.

I made this as directed and I didn't like the texture. I tried it a second time with 5 eggs instead of 3 and in a cake pan instead of a glass baking dish. Reduced the heat to 325 and placed in a water bath. With my slight adjustments came out much better. I also lightly greased the sides of my pan and made removal of the flan much simpler. My step son and his girlfriend loved the flan so overall great flavor but directions slightly off (well for me anyways)!!!

I have made this recipe dozens of times. It's easy to adapt the recipe. I like a bit thicker flan so I add more eggs. I've added chocolate condensed milk, chocolate powder, cinnamon, chocolate syrup, vodka, rum, liqueurs and even cut the sugars in half  and it is always a show stopper.

This was so awesome. Perfect recipe. I did use the water bath like some of the reviews suggested.
I'm not sure how how adding water to the sugar was supposed to help, but it only made rock candy for me. Not caramel!! Its much easier to add the sugar to a pot and put it on med high and watch it.  It gets brown pretty quickly.  You can swirl it around or give it a quick stir and take it off of the eye. That works for me. 
I also strained the mixture through a fine colander into the bowl. Thank God because there were a few egg lumps.

It came out so smooth, creamy, and sweet. It was the perfect consistency. I covered ot tightly and put it in the fridge to cool.

I've used this recipe before, I loved it then as well. 
this time, instead of soiling a pan to make caramel (which is too much trouble to clean, in my experience) I oiled the pyrex dish and put the sugar straight in! I placed it under the broiler of my oven for about 15 minutes. checking on it every 5 minutes. the indirect heat of the oven is much easier to make the caramel- directly in the dish. once the sugar looks 80% melted and golden brown, take it out. so it doesn't burn. then add the custard. you'll thank me later ;) enjoy!

If you're having trouble cleaning the sugar pan after step 2, I learned that you can put water in it, boil the water, and the sugar will dissolve into the boiling water. When all the sugar is dissolved into the water, empty the water for a seamless clean! I also use a little less condensed milk, since the entire can was too sweet for my family and I.

I'm a novice cook, 22 year old kid. This recipe was super easy to follow. The first time I made it I nailed it. Great flavor and texture. The second time I made it, it turned out even better. But then again, I come from a family of Mexican cooks, so I might have had a bit of an advantage when it came to prep and execution...I definitely recommend this recipe, it tastes great.

Followed recipe almost exactly, only difference was using a water bath while baking. I have made this several times and it turns out wonderful each and every time. Very traditional taste. I would recommend using exact ingredients and measurements, do not add more or less eggs.

Tasted amazing!!! Pretty simple once you get the sugar melting technique down. I suggest flipping it over before refrigerating. It was stuck when I tried flipping over after chilling.

1 hour in the oven was too long: the flan was burned. The caramel also hardened and stuck to the pan. After I flipped it over onto a plate, it collapsed and came out in a messy pile of chunks. I recommend thinking through the instructions better.

This is an awesome flan recipe! I have been using a different recipe for years and decided to try something new. I read all the reviews and thought they sounded good. I will be using this recipe from now on with just 2 modifications. I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I took 2 of these flan to a neighborhood gathering and everyone went wild over them--lots of compliments. They were delicious!!!

This was delicious. I was so surprised at how easy it was to make. The only thing I changed was putting it in an oblong pan because I didn't have around one. I took it to a Mexican potluck where it was devoured by all.

It was okay.  The people I made it for said it was delicious.  I added an extra egg and thought the consistency was firmer than another flan recipe I made.

i tried this in the pressure cooker.  I glazed the Carmel mixture in Unheated custard cups, poured the mixture in and sealed with aluminum foil.  I did not blend the mixture in a blender, just whisked it.  I did add an extra half cup of milk to it.  I have a six quart pressure cooker, and placed the custard cups on the rack in the cooker.  Once the pressure rocker began to rock, cooked it for 10 minutes.  Then I immediately cooled it under running water and set the cups to  cool until they were able to be handled.  Then I inverted  each one into a serving bowl.  They came out perfect, but because I didn't invert them immediately, wasn't as much syrup.  I have larger custard cups so could only do it in batches, two at a time, but I think for the smaller ones may be easier to glaze too..  I used 1 cup of water in the cooker.

This is a family favorite.  Rock your world good.  Impress all your latin friends and make this for them.  I made it exactly how it was written and it's awesome.  I've also taken suggestions of using 1 extra egg and that works too.  In addition, if you're not a fan of caramelizing sugar in a pan, use the microwave!  It works, it's fast, and (almost) error free.  I have to warn you though, don't burn the sugar... you'll regret it, stink up your place, and probably set off alarms.  As an alternative suggestion, you can also mix an 8 oz. package of cream cheese into the mix if you want that brick in your belly feeling (a richer flan).  Flan fans.  Take not.  Try this.  It really is a five star recipe.

This is a great recipe and really easy to make.  My only comments would be is to absolutely add one more egg to give it that extra creamy texture, make sure you bake it in a water bath and lastly be careful when you're melting the sugar that you don't burn it.

i wish it was a bit more creamy and also i think next time i would heat the carnation milk and temper the eggs before because it did have a slight egg taste that i hate. i also followed the advice of one of the review and did 1 1/4 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of water and cover sugar while it cooked to make the caramel. was just ok but the family lied it

This recipe completely failed for me. I'm an experienced baker and followed the recipe exactly, but the flan ended up with holes all through the bottom where the sugar had boiled up and was much too firm after 60 minutes of baking. I had to make a replacement dessert right before my party because this was not servable.

I made the exact recipe but doubled the amount for a party with a Mexican theme.  It ended up being the only dessert. I did add cream cheese (8oz), which made it super awesome!!!!!  I forgot to turn it over before serving, but that wasn't a problem, the whole thing was gone fast!  Great recipe for my 1st time time making flan :)

It was my first time making flan, and it came out great! This recipe made it easy.  To make sure that the mixture was perfectly smooth I beat it with my immersion blender.  I made it the day before and put it in the fridge, the only difficulty I had was getting it out of the mold. But after some banging with a knife handle it finally unmolded perfectly.  I think that happened because I used a 7inch mold but all the Caramel, so it was too thick on the bottom.

The flavor was good but I couldn't get it out of the pan.  Also, the foil stuck to the egg mixture and some of the top of the flan came off.

This was my first time making flan. I did everything as stated in recipe.. Although I did beat the ingredients in blender as one reviewer mentioned, also warmed the baking dish prior to adding the Carmel and everything seemed fine... Not sure why it didn't come out creamy like a flan..it was more like spongey/scrambled egg like. :( the flavor was pretty yummy though... Not sure what I should do differently to achieve the smooth creamy texture.

This is the same recipe that I used to make.  It is so easy and so good.  Never had it to fail and even made it in the microwave a few times.

Looks good. The recipe is simple. I probably would not use aluminum to cover it while baking. I would add more eggs to prevent any lumpy flán outcome. Overall it looks like a easy to follow recipe. 350 is the common baking temp but could be adjusted if need me. Thanks.

My only additional notes on this recipe are, 1) when melting the sugar, make sure the bottom of your saucepan is nice and wide so that your sugar makes as thin a layer as possible. That way, it won't be burned by the time it's all melted. Also, on my stove, medium heat for melting the sugar was plenty. =) 2) MAKE SURE TO BAKE COVERED. It loses too much moisture if you don't!

Recipe needs an adjustment to the vanilla!  I suggest to use 1 TSP instead of 1 TBSP.  All I taste is vanilla and I thought it was strange to add a whole tbsp, but the reviews convinced me to try it.  With the adjustment I would give it 4-5 STARS

I never thought of flan as something that I could make myself. I would order it at a local resturaunt, which is awesome, but expensive. Overall, this is a good recipe and very, very easy! I did the water bath like other people suggested and the texture was wonderful (placing the smaller pan in a larger pan and pouring boiling hot water into the larger pan until it reaches the midpoint of the small pan to bake). I really do like this recipe, although I thought 1 tablespoon of vanilla was overkill. I think next time I will half it. Also, just a dash of cinnamon would be nice in the sauce. This is of course my personal preference. Also, it's really good with a little bit of real whipped cream (not cool whip) on top.

1) light copper for caramel, dont let it "brown", 2) use blender minimally, helps to break down egg, 3) IMPORTANT for smooth custard: strain through cheesecloth or potato sack cloth, 4) water bath cover lightly at 300 degrees (350 was too high and caused my custard to become uneven)... SO HAPPY!

I used 3 jumbo eggs, probably would equal 4 large.  I made the custard in a blender first, so it'd be ready to pour into the pie plate.  Also knew exactly how much water was needed for the water bath and had that boiling.  Someone mentioned crystalizing the sugar in the pie plate in the microwave, so I did that.  1 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of water and a few drops of lemon juice. It was easy.  @6 minutes.  I did it at 2-minute intervals and watched it.  As soon as it turned light brown, I put the pie plate in a roaster, poured the custard on top, then the boiling water and into the oven.  Refrigerated it overnight and crossed fingers when I turned it onto a plate.  It turned out great.  Compliments from my card club.

Considering how simple this recipe is it comes out great!  I added 6 tbsp of water to the sugar to make the caramel sauce but that was the only modification.  This came out perfectly and I received wonderful praise from my coworkers at a potluck!  Thanks!

This is very easy.  I bought a flan pan with a lid and cooked it on top of the stove in a boiling water bath.  I also added two more eggs.  I cooked it for 90 minutes.  Just had to add more water occasionally so the pot didn't go dry.  I bought the pan in Mexico, not sure if they are available elsewhere.  Great for camping

It was very simple so I was not expecting much. This flan is very good. I made it last night to have as a Valentine's Day dessert and tried one before tonight's meal. It has a great consistency and flavor. I baked it on water trays and it was simple. Before adding the caramel I had the small baking dishes on hot water as someone else recommended so the caramel wouldn't harden instantly. Worked great!!!! I think this will become a family favorite.

I did not like this recipe. It might just be a personal taste thing. I found it too rubbery and not very creamy and too sweet. I am still on the hunt for a creamy, light and tasty flan. I'll keep looking!

This recipie is great and my flan came out delicious.However, I believe I made a mistake because I used brown sugar instead of white sugar as indicated so the caramel coat came out very think and flan could get out easily from the baking dish :) Also, flan wasn`t fluffy so I think I might have to practice a lot until I master this recipie because my husband loved the taste.

Amazingly simple recipe, provided you add a few tweaks. When you are making your caramel, wait until it starts to melt. When it starts to get that rich almost amber color, take it off the heat and toss in a couple of pads of butter. It'll cool the caramel down so it doesn't over cook, mix until the butter is all or almost gone (it will melt quickly), then pour into your mold. I had a Pyrex glass pan that I put a washtowel on the bottom off, flat, and water so it would reach half of my flan mold once the mold settled to the bottom. Then, cover with tin foil and cook. It took me an extra 20 minutes, but it came out very creamy, rich and not too egg-ey. Added an extra egg and about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the recipe. Will be making again. I used La Lechera brand condensed milk and it seems to do the trick well.

This is a hit every time!!  The caramel spreads in the baking dish better if I put the dish in the oven while it preheats.  I've made it a few times with 3 eggs, but I like it a little better with 4.  So many people have asked me for this recipe - it's a really good one!

Simple. I doubled the recipe. Next time I'll cut the sugar back to single recipe qty because I prefer less carmel.  My husband is from Chile and he loved it!

The first time I prepared flan dish from this recipe, the flan did not come out right. The caramel was too liquidy, even after I allowed it to set over night. When I checked the flan the following morning, the caramel was still liquidy and the custard part of the dish was darkened on top. I followed the recipe exactly the way it stated but was not satisfied. I highly recommend placing a glass pan of water beneath flan dish prior to cooking(did not specify in recipe) to give it that beautiful color and texture. The second time I prepared this dish, I place a pan of water beneath it, and it came out great.

This was my first time making flan. This flan recipe extremely easy to make AND it tastes delicious! Just be careful when reversing the flan onto a serving plate; I ruined it a little on the side but still looks good ;)

i used 4 eggs instead of the three as other people had mentioned to do so. i have attempted to make two flans. the first one did in fact not turn out the way i expected it to. i burnt the caramel sauce so it did have a funny taste. the second one did turn out and it was perfect. as i found out, i am the only one in my household who likes flan. more for me i guess. :) thanks again. five stars from me now.

This was fabulous, though a little too thin for me.  I don't think I used enough eggs but will definitely make again using more eggs and maybe a smaller, thicker pan.

I have never tried Flan before but always wanted to. I am not sure how it is supposed to taste but I didn't like it very much. I will say that mine turned out well with the cooking method and time stated. I ended up giving this away to my neighbors for them to enjoy.

Thank you for this recipe!  It is very simple (compared to the others posted), even I could make it without messing up! I made a few alterations to make it a 'little' healthier and reduce the # of calories. I used 5 eggs as suggested by a reviewer and the texture was still nice. I used low fat milk instead of evaporated milk but the same amount per the recipe. and I did not use the entire can of condense milk - i used 3/4 just to cut back on some calories lol but it was still sweet enough for my liking. I omitted the caramel part because i did not feel adventurous and i am not missing the added sugar.  Can't wait to eat the rest this afternnon and make some more next week!

Pretty easy recipe so far. It is in the oven now.  Took the advice of other people and melted the sugar on high heat and it was done in a jiffy.  I also put the pie dish in a pan with a bit of hot water in it.

Very good.  Like other reviewers, some of the caramel stayed in the pan, but there was more than enough that poured over the flan, so no complaints here.

I found this to be easy to make. The flan comes out looking great as if it was made by a professional chef. I made this during the Christmas holidays and everyone lovedd it. I am really a novice to cooking. Thanks to the ASOTO for this wonderful flan.

My first try at flan 15 years ago was such a failure that I haven't attempted it again until now.  This came out perfect and was pretty easy.  I did warm the pan so that the caramel did not harden immediately.  Wish I had known that trick before!  Thanks for a great recipe.

My first time making flan and it tasted great! Carmelizing the sugar took a lot of patience, and I didn't do the best job, so I'll have to work on that next time. The only other problem I had was getting it out of the pan... I made it in the evening and once it was cooler, I put it in the fridge for the next day. I had to soak the pan in warm water to loosen up the carmel before I could get the flan to come out.

Loved this recipe! I had to substitute the evaporated milk for whipping cream because when I opened the can of evaporated milk I realized it had expired and I didn' t have another one. Also, I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for because the center looked way too undercooked when I took it out of the oven (I cooked it in a can as opposed to a shallow pie dish, maybe that's why it took longer). Despite these changes the flan came out perfect and it was a complete success among my guests!!!

Oh my heck, this was the first time I ever made Flan because I was scared to deal with boiling sugar but I made it and it was AWESOME.  But I'd recommend 4 eggs instead of 3 but idk, I'd try it again with 3 to make it slightly healthier

I LOVE this recipe, I have made it about 5 times now, though, and it comes out "Bubbly" every single time.

I feel bad rating this recipe, it could just be that I didn't know what I was doing, but my recipe turned out not very tasty =/

1. Use a DEEP dish  pie pan, not the regular size.  I had egg mixture left over and got a FLAT flan.  2.  I forgot to cover it with aluminum foil and I don't know if that's what made the flan so "cakey" but I love a very custardy flan, so this didn't work for me.   Maybe the 5 eggs I used caused it?  3. When baking in a bath, use a cookie sheet with sides, and boil the water and pour it into the cookie sheet AFTER your flan is placed and ready to put in the oven. (no one tells you that.  I put the water in while I was preheating both pans which made handling them drippy and way too hot and dangerous while trying to pour the egg mixture).  Duh.  4, My guests thought this was tasty, but it was too cake like for me.  Very nice flavor however.  But not the texture I remember from Spain.

Unbelievably sweet and creamy.  Also, very easy to make, took only 10 - 15 min. prep time.  I will be making this again.

Best flan I’ve ever made. To make it lower in fat I used the fat free condensed milk, fat free evaporated milk and egg whites. I also used half a cup of sugar, that made enough caramel for my flan. Came out great.

This recipe is okay, but I think I prefer a more dense flan with 5-6 eggs. Anyone know how this recipe differs from a Mexican flan? As far as I can tell, all the components are the same.

This tasted good but didn't turn out--literally. I followed the directions for turning it out onto a plate, but the flan didn't cooperate. I was rather embarassed to take it to the dinner we were going to, but I did anyways.

I made this and it was the first time I had even thought about making something this fancy.  I used the Chocoflan variation, an entire cake mix won't fit on top of the recipe, only about a cup of it.  Also, I had never heard of a water bath, so I just filled a baking pan full of water and sat the pie pan in that, and I think it worked like it was supposed to.  Anyways, it was pretty good, I took it to a Cinco De Mayo luncheon at work and nobody got sick.  I did have to throw half of it away because it didn't get eaten but no big deal, that usually happens with everything.

Loved it, loved it, loved it! Perfectly creamy, smooth and not too eggy texture. Tastes great and super easy to make! Made my flan in 6oz ramekins. Baked at 350 for 30 mins in water bath loosely covered with foil until just set. Melting the sugar requires patience and a strong will to suppress the desire to stir it, but still completely do-able. Highly recommended!

I just love Flan. The four star is due to the fact that is was too sweet for my taste. Will make this recipe again but will just use half a can of condensed milk as suggested. I think I will use less sugar too the next time.

Really delicious recipe! I used 5 eggs instead of 3, and baked in a bain-marie. It turned out great, a little on the firm side, but my boyfriend doesn't like runny Flan. Will be making this again!

Excellent flan. I reduced the amount of condensed milk to half or even less because it was too sweet for me. Taste as good as the one we had at our favorite mexican restaurant.

I used 1 1/2c half and half instead of condensed milk, 5 eggs, and 1T Grand Marnier instead of vanilla.  Used sieve to strain the mixture and baked in a water bath. Cover with wrap and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  Love it!

I don't know why since I used the water bath covered with foil maybe the lack of holes in the foil, not sure how the steam works with this. The outer perimeter was kind of curdled looking with the inside of the flan beautifully silky smooth. Maybe I need lower heat and  less baking time .Overall this was so good, very rich maybe a little too sweet, though. Next time I'll cut to half the sugar. I  also had syrup with a hard buildup on the bottom of the pan. Still this  desert is one of the most delicious ones I've eaten. I'll continue to practice until I get it down pat. Thanks for a winner!

Really, really good.  I didn't change a thing.  A little messy, since the carmelized sugar leaked out of the baking dish during baking and after, but worth the delicious taste!!

I liked this and it was very easy, although does require patience while melting the sugar.  I was wondering if there was a trick of making the filling with a smoother texture. I thought it should be smoother, but don't know what I could have done differently.  Some of the sugar mixture did solidify in the pan, but there was stil plenty enough to cover the flan.  Any suggestions?

Wonderful!!  I have eaten flan many times and this is exactly the same as the ones I've had.  I added one more egg, baked it in a water bath and cooked for an extra 5 minutes.  It was perfect.

this was really good. It was my first time making flan and I was very pleased, my boyfriend who's from Ecuador loved it. I think next time I'll use a strainer and strain it before putting it in the dish. Also I melted the sugar no problem but when I took the flan out there was a thick layer of hard sugar on the bottom.... What did I do wrong?

Prepared for Christmas Eve and was a huge hit.  Perfect.  The user tips helped as I pre-warmed the pan.  I made two recipes and put one in a bunt pan, which was fun. To better remove flan from pan before inverting, warm bottom of pan in a hot water bath for about a minute.  Enjoy!

This recipe tastes great and is very easy to make. I followed it exactly but I also followed the recommendations to use a water bath and cover in foil with holes poked in it. I was a little skeptical when I took it out of the oven because it looked a bit undercooked but I let it sit in the fridge overnight and it was perfect. This is now my favorite recipe for flan.(By the way, be patient with the sugar. It will take some time to caramelize but it's worth the wait.)

Absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing on the recipe. I made two flans for about 20 people and everyone loved it. This is going to be my main flan recipe from now on. I have tried many other recipes, from Cuban cookbooks and web sites, but this one tops them all. I used dark cake pans because it was all I had on hand and it came out PERFECT. Just remember that the sugar takes a long, long time to melt, especially if you don't have a powerful stove. Try this recipe -- you'll love it!

This is my first time making flan and it came out very well. It has a nice custard flavor and consistency. It doesn't have the excess egg flavor. Next time I will make them in individual serving cups instead of a pie pan because it is a little runny and messy.

Overall this is a great recipe.  I've made it a couple of times and I have made a couple of adjustments.  I use 4 eggs instead of 3, add some fresh grated nutmeg and bake the flan in a water bath for about 50 minutes max.  It is a hit!

My first time making flan, it was easier than I thought! I wish I found this recipe earlier! Great recipe, I think I would cook it a little less than an hour though, maybe 45 minutes?

Followed the recipe to the letter, but when it can time to serve to the dessert, the caramel was a hard disc shape candy, instead of the yummy liquid sauce,and the consistanty of the flan wasn't smooth.
