This has always been a favorite with my family too. We wrap them in foil and put them in the oven, it makes the buns a little crunchy, more like pizza crust and keeps them warm for times when some of us need to eat at different times.

I decided to wrap the sandwiches in foil and bake them in the oven at 400 for 5 or so minutes.  It melted the cheese & made the buns toasty!

Quick and easy, but next time I'll use a spicier pizza sauce and add some chopped onions.

This was really quick and easy to make... A big hit with my kids!!! I did add onions in with the meat just to give it a little more flavor... This was a nice change from sloppy joes. I will definitley make this again!

this was a really good recipe for the kids to help out on. they can add the cheese and spoon on the sauce.  I personally put the buns with the cheese and sauce on into the oven at 350 for about 3-4 minutes to melt the cheese and the buns get crispy instead of soggy.  we also added pepperoni on them and then sprinkled the hceese on top.

Wonderful recipie!  I used ground Italian sausage instead of ground beef and added pizza cheese & red pepper flakes to give extra flavor. Everyone loved it, I'll be making this again.

The title was a little misleading to me. I just jotted down the ingredients and didn't read the instructions. In my mind I pictured an actual burger topped with pizza fixings instead of a sloppy joe style but regardless, it was tasty, simple, and quick for the night I didn't have much time to work with. I am having to cut back on cheese for health reasons so I used a little bit of shredded instead of a whole slice. I also added a few mushrooms because we love them on our pizza. I think next time I make it I'll add some onion and pepperoni to the beef mixture to give it more kick. This is one you can easily add your favorite pizza toppings to give it variety.

Make sure to use a pizza sauce you really like. I couldn't find the one I wanted and was disappointed with the one I used. I also think that next time, I'll do a seasoned hamburger/sausage mix.

My family did not like these.  I thought they were just OK.  I followed the recipe except for microwaving them and I used shredded Mozzerella that I had on hand.  My husband said this was food for the dogs.

This is one of our favorites. Try adding spam by grating it and add a second cheese to it when u cook it before u put it on the buns.

I thought these were going to be tasty....my husband and I thought it tasted like spaghetti without the noodles on a bun. I even added pepperoni but it tasted nothing like pizza. Sorry not for us.

I love this recipe.  I usually add some mushrooms and/or green peppers to the mix.  Either way they're great.

Pizza burgers are a cross between burgers, pizza, and sloppy joes. My sister makes them with half the hamburger and half sausage browned together and toss in some peperoni's for more of a pizza kick. Also when when it's all cooked and drained and the sauce is warmed threw sprinkle the cheese on top and cover until melted. Serve on toasted buns. My whole family loves this one.

My family really really liked this recipe.  Excellent!  Super easy for families on the go or short on time.  I chose to broil my buns so that they weren't soggy.  We will definately make these again.

Love this recipe.  All three of my children (and hubby of course) eat this all up, and that rarely happens!  I do add a slice of pepperoni and sometimes genoa salami before I pop it in the oven to melt the cheese.  Easy and very tasty!  Thanks for the post.

This was something very different than the usual sloppy joes. I added a chopped onion to the mix and next time I think I will dice up a green pepper, add a touch of hot sauce, and maybe even some mushrooms just to really make it a pizza burger. I followed the directions however I found that it was just to sweet without adding any of the above items.

definitely a quick recipe, but my family found it a bit lacking in flavor, could be the sauce I used, but I added pizza spices and it was still a bit bland.  Will try again and experiment next time.  Thanks!

I added some garlic salt to the meat while it was cooking. I used Ragu Pizza sauce. It was a little bitter but it didn't ruin the taste. I will just add a pinch of sugar next time. I toasted the buns so I didn't have to microwave to melt the cheese. Family loved them! I will add to my recipe box!

Suggested additions (to taste):  pepperoni and green olives (both chopped).  definately oven bake to melt and slightly brown the cheese on top.
