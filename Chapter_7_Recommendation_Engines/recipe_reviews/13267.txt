Well, I was surfing for cabbage recipes- cabbage is cheap and I am broke. I was skeptical about this recipe but had all the ingredients on hand so what the heck? 
I was surprised- this soup is rather quite yummy and rich tasting. And considering it cost about $2 to make well worth it. I will make it again.
I would recommend using a low sodim broth, it came out a bit salty.

What a great soup for a winter meal.  I cut up some leftover ham and added that to the pot too.  I also had to add salt.

I tried this recipe on a whim and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  My 12 year old ate 3 bowls (amazing for her!) and my husband said he enjoyed it.  I doubt I will make this again, unless I use some variation.

This soup is definitely a keeper.  Super easy to make, I threw it all in the pot together and let it simmer away.  I love how it is low-cal and high-fiber too.  Different and tasty.

This was a tasty soup, but I did not like the texture of the beans with the soup. Next time I make it I will just add tomato sauce instead of the can of beans. I skipped the direction of cooking the vegetables first and just added them to the broth. Also basal and garlic powder improved the taste of the broth.

This is a great basic recipe, with lots of room for customization (different veggies, beans etc etc) My biggest problem with making it as written was that it was extremely unappetizing looking. If I were to make it again, I would add a bit of color with red potatoes with the skin on, carrots, bell pepper etc. But anyway, this is a great start for a healthy, easy and inexpensive meal. Thanks, Ruth!

Made this last night and was pleased with the result. Almost forgot the can of baked beans but added it just before it was too late. I also added 1 carrot with the other veggies and 1 clove of garlic before the final heat along with 1/2 tsp of basil. Next time I'll probably cut the basil down to 1/4 tsp.
Cooked the cabbage for about 15 minutes, stirring every 5.
My beans were a big tin of Bush's southern pit bbq beans as that is all I had.
Tasted surprisingly good but the house still smelt a bit of cooked cabbage ;-)

This is a great recipe but I wanted a little more spice. I added one package of Lawry's spaghetti sauce powder. I also added 1 lb. of pork meat and 1 large can of diced tomatoes.  I cooked it in the crock pot. Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I made this soup yesterday on a snowy day and found it to be easy, and quick to make. Upon tasting it, I felt it was rather bland, and not enough broth. On a whim, I added one more can of chicken broth and a can of condensed tomato soup. It made a big difference in the flavor, and it was hard to stop eating! I recommend it.

I also found this recipe to be bland.  Adding some ham or smoked sausage helped a lot.  Another thing that helped was adding some apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons or more, added just the right zing.

Great recipe!  We used danish cabbage (leftovers) so there was already some sour cream and caraway seed mixed in.  I thickened it with some cornstarch and made drop dumplings for the top.  I stewed them all together for 20 minutes and we had a great meal!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is ok - it is filling and tastes fine, but not spectacular.  I made a lot and froze it, which will be convenient down the road.  I like the affordability factor too!

I wasn't in the mood for a super thick soup so I chose to thin it out. I simmered a  very meaty ham bone in much more than 4 c water and eliminated the potatoes. I cooked it for about 2 hours. Then just dumped all the veggies (with the addition of carrots and corn for color) and simmered another 20 mins or so. Added the pork and beans when the veggies were tender. I tried a bowl without apple cider vinegar and it was good. Then I added a splash to another bowl as suggested by another reviewer. I liked the addition very much. I enjoyed it very much and I would like to make it just the same way. Great use of a cheapo can of pork and beans!

I doctored this up a bit and enjoyed it very much.  I added carrots and bell pepper to the other veggies.  At the end, I added a can of tomato paste, so it turned out to be a tomato-vegetable soup.  I almost added ground turkey, but didn't.  I also thought about adding chunks of ham.  I think either would have made it even better.  I will definitely make again.

Very good! I substituted collard greens for the cabbage, and used sweet potatoes instead of regular. It was hearty.

A wonderful soup and a brilliant way to reuse bbq beans. I had made baked beans with homemade bbq sauce (way easier and faster than it sounds), so had less sugar in mine and a more complex flavor than tinned baked beans. However, in these soups, the cabbage is frequently not the last ingredient, which is a big mistake for people who like cabbage leaves with substance instead of mush (which is not everybody, so if you like your veg softer, cook longer :) No judgement here!). It needs to be the last thing you throw in as your cabbage leaves really only need to be in the soup for 15-20 minutes on medium to low heat.

This was really good with a few additions. I thought it needed a more tomato base and I had a 1/2 jar of leftover spaghetti sauce in the fridge so I added that, about 2 tbsp lemon vinegar, juice of 1/2 lemon, I also added 1 sliced carrot with the veggies at the beginning. I used vegetarian baked beans instead of pork and beans. I simmered the soup for about 2 hours and it was delicious.

Given all the canned ingredients, I was hesitant to serve this to company at a dinner party. Although I was concerned it would be bland, this soup was suprisingly tasty and actually had quite a complex flavor. Nice winter soup. Guests all wanted the recipe!

Definitely a keeper. This was simple and tasty. My only substitution use Penzey’s Bavarian seasoning instead of a Bayleaf. I’ll try it again with some diced up pork for variation.

This was surprisingly delicious!  I didn't know what to expect, but it turned out great!  We don't eat pork, so I used Bushs vegetarian baked beans.  I added some tomato paste and lemon juice to help the broth flavor pop a little more.....in a separate skillet I fried up some turkey kielbasa- which went well with this soup.  Thanks!!

Making the soup as written, it was just too bland, so I only gave it  1-STAR.  I ended up making the soup as follows, plus added the following ingredients too make the soup more flavorful. First, I used 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to sauté the onion and celery. I then actually added 6 -1/2 cups of already shredded coleslaw mix (with shredded carrots), and sautéed that for a few minutes, and then added 2 teaspoons of jarred minced garlic. After adding the broth, I added 2 (15-oz.) cans of Meijer Organic Baked Beans, as one can of beans just didn't seem like enough, and too cut the sweetness of the baked beans, I added 1 (6-oz.) can of tomato paste. I don't know why "baked bean" is in the title of the recipe, when the recipe itself states to use a can of pork and beans, so just like others have stated, I too used baked beans in the soup. And after I added the cans of beans, I then added the pepper,  1 small bay leaf, plus a medium size bay leaf, and a 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil leaves. Also, when it came to adding the potatoes, I did add 3-1/2 cups,  as there was plenty of liquid to add more vegetables. I ended up simmering the soup for 30 minutes, and after my husband and I ate one bowl of soup, I still felt the soup was missing something, so I added 14-ounces of sliced and already sautéed smoked sausage, and after re-heating the soup the next day, the soup was even more flavorful.  With all the extra add-ins, I'd say the soup tasted a lot

It's a 5 for sure.  So simple and so tasty.  Next time I will add some lean ground beef just for a little more protein and filler.  I have added beans to my soups of course but for some reason never thought of pork and beans.  I used Bush's brand.  A new go-to winter quick soup!

Loved this soup! Used baked beans instead of pork and beans. Perfect soup for cold weather.
