I made the recipe as described but I had a pound of Cod, so I did a little more than double the ingredients and it came out excellent.   Living for most of my life on Cape Cod I appreciate the fish that  this land is named after.  The cod is not buried in the ingredients but complimented by them, and this dish is easy to play with after you make it  the original way.  I don't need to change it!

Bland. Cod can't quite stand on its own with such minimal seasoning.

This was a big hit with my picky family. I followed the recipe exactly and it was good. The second time I made it, I added lemon zest and it was fantastic. I highly recommend adding fresh lemon zest, you won't be disappointed. Happy cooking to you all!

Made the recipe without the lemon pepper, ... just added pepper, and some fresh lemon juice.  Tasted great.  Simple to make and easy.

I used red onion, fresh lemon zest and juice, and chardonnay for the wine.  Only cooked my fish 3 mnutes on each side.  Delicious!

This was delicious and very easy to make. I didn't have lemon pepper to added (literally) fresh lemon and course-ground pepper. I added more lemon at the end. I also used 2 cloves of garlic, instead of 1. I will definitely make this again.

Doubled the recipe and used a Pinot Grigio for the white wine.  Very tasty!  I was a little concerned as I saw some comments about the cod being difficult to turn over.  I used tongs and a spatula and was able to gently turn the pieces of cod fillet over.  Make sure you do that around the 4 minute mark because if the fish starts to flake, it will be harder to turn the pieces over!

I love this recipe! It was quick and easy. Although, I did make it with butter instead of olive oil for more flavor. I also added black pepper. My side dish was my special sautéed asparagus. It was a hit! Will be making this twice a month for sure.

The onion and garlic was a nice flavor enhancement for cod which can be bland.  This was delicious. I skipped the parmesan and just seasoned well with salt and pepper.  It worked well with steamed broccoli as the sauce flavored that as well.

This worked out really well for me but you have to season to your taste.   I served mine over jasmine rice and drizzled some of the wine mixer over the cod in addition to the Parmesan and cracked black pepper and sea salt.

Not complicated. Flavor was okay, not amazing.  I’ve eaten cod all my life but I’ve never cooked it.  It turned out tough following the cooking 3-4 minutes on each side. Not sure if it was the cod or the cooking.  I’d probably make this again but cook it less time.  I’d probably also tweak the topping.

I followed the recipe except I added fifty percent more lemon pepper than it called for which gave it a little flavor boost. I used fresh cod, not frozen, and only the thick side of the fish. All the cooking times were right on. It was delicious.

Delish! Fast, easy, and tasty. Not sure why you need parm at the end so I just used a little bit and a sprinkle of lemon zest because my lemon pepper seasoning wasnt high quality. Will definitely make again.

Super easy recipe which is what attracted me due to limited time.  However, the fish turned out very bland.  The onions were tasty, but I won't be making this again.

This was fast, easy and delicious! I didn't get to take a pic, as my husband and I were both starving . . . but we thoroughly enjoyed this for a quick Saturday night dinner with a nice big salad and some crusty bread. I did add some chopped fresh parsley to the sauce, but other than that, made as directed. The sauce was so delicious that we used the bread to clean our plates. Will make again!

Nice recipe! I find most cod to be pretty nondescript. This is a simple recipe that adds flavor and moisture with the oil, wine, onions and garlic. Used a good quantity of fresh ground pepper, lemon zest and some lemon juice in place of the lemon pepper. Turned out to be very nice. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! Next time I will double the onion. I pretty much caramelized/burn't the onion and garlic but ended up perfect! It gave a really  nice depth to the dish! I'll make this again

That was great! I’m super picky about white fish and hate anything fried, so it was nice to find something new to try. Absolutely loved it! The filets stayed in one piece just fine. Will definitely use again.

Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing! My cod also fell apart in the pan after flipping, but no worries, still was yummy. I put the parmesan cheese in the mixture at the end before serving. Will definitely make again and again!

Turned out ok. I really prefer fried fish. But I might try this one again since I am trying to stay away from the oils.

Was delicious. Easy to do. My cod was a little thicker than shown so I used a little more wine. So very moist and everyone over it.

This was so delicious and wonderful to make.  I've skipped the pepper and used lemon zest instead of wedges. I've used Aldi's frozen cod. Although it said to cut the cod into 4 pieces as a list of ingredients, I left it as is.  I've also plated it on top of Fresh Express's Caesar Salad Deluxe's salad greens.  I would make it again for sure.

Is it just me?  I have no idea how to turn cod filets over 4 times without the fish crumbling. I only turned it twice & it became bite-size pieces. A mess!

This was a good recipe. I thought it needed something but not sure what. My husband liked it a lot. For those of you who may have not cooked Cod before, it cooks really quickly, which I didn’t know, like minutes and mine fell apart badly but still tasted good. Just be careful on how long you cook it.

Well, my husband thought it was good, but he couldn't taste the fish! I used a lb. of fish, so I used the Allrecipes  ingredient calculator.  It resulted in a recipe with way too much onion, which released too much water into the mix, I'm not sure the 1\2 cup of olive oil wasn't too much. On the positive side, I accidentally grapped cumin instead of the red pepper and sprinkled a little bit over one fillet.  I was surprised, it actually worked! We had the fish over rice, which helped absorb a lot of that liquid.

Bought nearly 2 pounds of fresh cod and came to my cooking bible in Allrecipes to find out how I can make the fish more exciting. As a relatively inexperienced cook I found this recipe appeared to have the two things I seek: simplicity and flavor. My wife and I agree this was a winner. We didn't have any lemon pepper so substituted for ground pepper and lemon juice, but everything else was as per the recipe. Obviously we needed to up all the quantities and I even had two pans going at once to hold all the fish. Make sure you spoon the left over juices onto your cod as well as they contain a lot of flavor.

So easy and so delicious! I'm not a regular fish lover but this was definitely going to be made again. Hubby loved it too. I added some cornstarch to make the sauce a little thicker. Delicious!

This was very tasty, and I will make it again.  It really gave a relatively  bland fish, great flavors. Very quick, very easy.

Great quick recipe.  Penney spices has a Florida seasoning that I used instead of  lemon pepper.  Worked really well.

I was concerned about the reviews.  People either thought it was bland or exceptional. Per one review, I doubled the ingredients but used 1 lb of cod.  One note is, the garlic cloves I used were large.  The dish was exceptional.  Both my husband and I loved the final product!  We will make it again. It was very tasty!

This was very bland. I didn't change a thing except added even more lemon pepper seasoning than it called for. But, it was still very bland. We had to have some ranch on the side to dip it so my kids could get through it. We will not make this again.

I read the reviews and added capers and a little juice from the capers.  It was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and can't wait to have the left-overs.

It was just okay. I added salt and pepper to combat the blandness mentioned in other reviews. I felt like the onions, as prepared, didn't really contribute to the flavor of the cod. Serving with lemon wedges made the flavor a little better.

4 min per side too long for the filets I had.  A tad bland so added some capers and caper brine to taste.  Fresh lemon juice and salt would work as well.

Fantastic... Used red onion , did not use the Parmesan. I cook in an iron skillet for added nutrition. Excellent flavor.

I tried this recipe last night and it was amazing.  The flavors blended together so well.  It was definitely NOT bland.  My entire family loved it.
