This was a wonderful quick and easy recipe.  I had rotisserie chicken leftover, so I used that, great weeknight meal!

This is a fantastic, easy & quick meal to make. I use garlic and onion saut√©ed in butter with fajita chicken strips, along with the remaining ingredients (using preferred flavor of Asiago Cheese Alfredo Sauce by Prego) and this meal is a family favorite! Very creamy! I stick with milk instead of cooking wine to keep the consistency of alfredo, and it turns out fantastic every time!
