I used Tarantula Tequila in this recipe only because I did not have Sauza brand. This margarita has a KICK but it's quite delicious. I have to admit I wasn't sure that a raspberry margarita would taste good--I was wrong. DELICIOUS. NOTE: If you use Tarantula Tequila, it does have a citrus-y flavor, keep that in mind. I thought it made this drink even better.

This tasted so artificial to my husband and I.  I think next time we will incorporate fresh raspberries with a simple syrup and another liquor.

I really liked these margaritas. The flavor was perfect, and the Sauza Blue Agave tequila was really smooth. Perfect!

I used Chambord in place of the Razzmatazz (which I couldn't find).  This was a good drink---everyone at my party loved this one, but I wanted to have it a little stronger---maybe less margarita mix.  It was a little sweet for me.  I will make this again but make my own lime-simple syrup mixture.  I used Sauza Blue Agave Tequila for this drink.

I skipped the margarita mix and just used lime juice instead. It was tasty and a big hit with the crowd of people I had over! I would make this again.

This was awesome. I can't wait to try it again and use fresh raspberry puree after I harvest my crop of berries this year!

This was a hit.  We couldn't find Razzmatazz, so DS steeped fresh raspberries in vodka for 3 days and we used 1 part fresh lime juice to 3 parts water.  I like the combination of raspberry and lime and the Sauza Blue Agave tequila just makes it all come together.

Great flavor! The only change I made was that I blended it with ice. Super tasty!

This was a hit at my BBQ. I used the blue agave tequila along with 6 oz of the Razzmatazz. I made it as directed but then wanted a slightly stronger Raspberry flavor. I added frozen Raspberries and Lime slices that was frozen to help keep in cold. I will be making this again for my next girls night in.

I used raspberries that we picked fresh and had frozen.  This turned out great as a frozen drink!

This was really delicious! Was a huge hit.  We started off with the recipe as it, when we ran out of Margarita mix, I put frozen raspberries and blueberries in a blender with Sauza Gold and it was awesome.  Both versions were gone quickly!!

Awesome drink, loved the flavor and color. Hubby liked it as well, not nearly as sweet as we expected. Will have a few more in the near future! ;)

So yummy! I loved the rasberry flavor and this margarita is a beautiful red color.  The margarita was not overly sweet and blended well with the silver Sauza tequila.

We thoroughly enjoyed this drink and will most definitely serve this again.  We did use our Ninja blender to mix the ingredients with ice and whipped it up really well to a good froth.  We also used the margarita mix that has to be refrigerated and has an expiration date. It is better than the kind the you do not have to refrigerate and I believe makes a difference.

Everyone at our "Shake it up - Night in" (4-27-13) loved this margarita!  It was the favorite one of the night.  Will be blending this one up again soon!  Thanks Sauza!

This is a very good recipe. I thought it was a tad to sweet but nothing undrinkable. My husband loved it. I used pink sugar for the rim because its pretty :) I did use Sauza Blue tequila.

I loved the tangy, sweet flavor of the raspberry. It pairs nicely with the really smoothe Sauza Blue Agave tequila. The next time I make this, I'm going to use red sugar to garnish the rim. You can buy it at the liquor store. This would be a nice drink for a girls' night in or a summer get-together. Refreshing!

I have just found my new summer drink!  I am not a big tequila fan, but with that said, I LOVED this one! The Sauza 100% Tequila Silver is the only one I really like. The others have always had such a harsh taste to them, but this one is so smooth and goes down nicely.  It's the perfect combination of flavors. I was pleasantly surprised to find the pairing of the raspberry and margarita mix not only worked together, but actually complimented each other. Go ahead and give this one a try. I'm sure it will be one that you go back to again and again.
