Quick and easy. To make it even less time-consuming, break into pieces when cool, rather than trying to cut bars.Some folks on my Christmas list will be getting food gifts, so I am seeking out the best Almond Crunch recipe on this site!

This was so easy to make and SO good!  No baking involved, but you really do have to stir for the full five minutes as stated in the recipe...  very YUMMY - and looks like a cute gift when SOME  is packaged in a small clear cello bag tied with a ribbon...

Great recipe. Boiling the sugar and the butter took me about 15 minutes, it says five but just keep waiting until it's an amber color.  Turned out great....

This is awesome.  It tastes like a more delicious version of a Clark Bar.  Definitely sprinkle the top with chopped nuts for eye appeal.

Very yummy recipe... should have read a few of the reviews first... I think it took a lot longer than 5 minutes for it to be a brown color and pourable... tastes awesome though!

excellent recipe. just made it 5 minutes ago and i sampled it before it cooled completely, sooo good, it reminds me of a skor bar.  I had a ton of almonds left over from a trail mix and all the other ingredients i had on hand.  Very quick and easy

I used only 1 cup of choco chips the 2cd time I made this & everyone liked it better. the 3rd time i used peanut butter chips  & choc chips in layers & crushed almonds as the garnish -this was a huge success.

An easy, tasty recipe that i have made successfully many, many times.  my only change is to use brown sugar instead of white. I found it to give a richer taste, overall...thanks much!

This is delicious!  I made it and really impressed my mother-in-law.  I would cut the crushed almonds in half though, as they didn't stick to my butter mixture, but rather stayed in the bottom of the pan for the most part. Also, it takes a lot longer than 5 minutes, but just keep stirring and you will get there.   Absolutely delicious and just like almond roca!

Converted measurements to metric system, and the result was amazing. Delicious, very easy and fast to make. Used dark chocolate for batch one and milk chocolate for second batch. Both are delicious. Oh, and used crushed nuts instead of crushed almonds. Will def make this again!
