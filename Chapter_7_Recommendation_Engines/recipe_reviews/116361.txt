This was so tasty and very quick & simple to make.  I made just a few minor revisions.  I only had an afternoon to marinate, so I did 4 hours instead of 8, but the taste didn't seem to suffer. I added a bit more salt & pepper per some other reviews and also sprinkled thyme on top as one person suggested.  I used regular russet potatoes since I didn't have red potatoes and used 3--the perfect quantity for a 11 x 7 pan.  If you're making it for more people with a larger tenderloin I think you could easily add more potatoes and cook in a 13 x 9 pan instead.  This is one of my new favorite recipes and will appear regularly in our dinner rotation. THANKS!

Nice flavor, moist.  I roasted it in an oven bag to retain the juices.

I made this for a dinner party of 10 and it was wonderful.  I added fresh rosmary to the pan when I cooked it and sprinkled some thyme over the top as well.  We served it with an Avo-Cranberry Chutney and it was great!

A balanced blend of flavors I grew up with and enjoy with spot on time and temperature directions. I didn't measure exactly but I don't think the submitter intended us to.  I didn't "marinate" the potatoes at the same time as the tenderloin, however, choosing instead to just toss them with with the olive oil, garlic, rosemary (I used fresh), salt and pepper just before putting it all in the oven.  I used more potatoes than called for in the recipe - good judgment on my part because they were awesome good!  Rather than the 11x7" pan I used a small cookie sheet, spreading the potatoes out so they could get all golden brown and crispy.  This was delicious and satisfying - something quick and easy to prepare the night before I hit the road again with a BIG pay-off.  (Lining your pan with foil and eating it all up so there's no leftovers to wrap eliminates the need for clean-up, making this even quicker and easier!)

This was very easy to make especially because the potatoes and pork were all in one pan.  Had a lot of flavor.  Just be sure not to overcook the pork.  I did not need to leave mine in the oven for the full stated time.

Pork Tenderloin Roasted Potatoes' Haiku: "Impressive flavor. Not hard to make, and worth it. We ate the whole thing!" Followed this recipe exactly (maybe a *bit* more garlic) and we were astounded at how outrageously good this was, with such little ingredients and prep work. Timing is pretty spot-on: baked 23 min., kicked the broiler and browned those taters nice and crisp for 5 min. The tenderloin was, well, tender and tremendous, the red potatoes were the perfect balance of crispy exterior, fluffy inside. Even my 3-year old obliterated her plate.

This was absolutely delicious!  The pork came out tender and the potatoes were yummy also.  I used a bigger piece of meat so I cooked the meat for half an hour before adding the potatoes.  Will definitely make this again.

This was the first time I've made pork tenderloin and this recipe was very simple and easy.  It tasted very good and I love that the meat and potatoes are all done in the same dish.  I'll make it again I'm sure.

This was excellent! I used a bottle of garlic and herb marinade that had been in the pantry since last year and needed using up. The pork was moist and tender (though hello, it's a tenderloin!), the potatoes were flavorful and crispy. Everybody ate it, and it was easy! Can't wait to have it again.

Followed the recipe exactly as is, we had this for supper tonight and wow it turned out fantastic!  Yummy garlic smell wavering throughout the house while it baked.  I baked the potatoes until they started to become a little crispy and they were so delicious. Will definetely make again.

This was awesome, and so easy!!  I wanted to use 5 potatoes instead of 2, so I doubled the marinade and divided it into 2 bags.  Roasting for 25 minutes then broiling for 5 was perfect (as long as your potatoes aren't cut too large).  I did need to add salt to the end, so I think adding more to the marinade would be good for next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent tasting meal and the potatoes were exceptional (the carrots I added too).  I used turkey tenderloins (2-3/4 pound ones) and doubled the recipe.  Since I did not have rosemary, so I used poultry seasoning in its place.  I also added carrots (don't slice carrots thin or they will burn) with the potatoes.  I only had about four hours to marinate, but the taste was still wonderful!  My entire family loved this meal, and I plan to make it many, many times.

This was just delicious.  Our house smells amazing, too. Followed recipe exactly except for pouring a little marinade over all while cooking. Will be a keeper for my regular meal rotation.

The amount of rosemary called for overpowered the tenderloin, and my family isn't a big fan of rosemary to begin with.  I'll try it again, but I'm going to use dillweed, which has a more delicate taste.

I marinated the pork for 2 days and it was delicious.  I was concerned about the potatoes turning brown, but did marinate them for about 10 hours.  They did turn brown in spots and I did not find that very appetizing, but the flavor is good.  I did not half the marinade.

Despite the fact that I probably overbaked it for about five minutes (I was waiting for the juices to run clear, which they never did... strange), it was really tender and juicy, both the night I made it and the next day when I zapped it in the microwave. (I did use half a shallot since I only had one garlic clove on hand.) I cut the potatoes too large so they weren't the texture I wanted them to be (and that left me wishing I had gravy... if this recipe was adapted to produce a gravy at the end it would be perfect), but that was totally my fault and the only bad thing about the dish. I am saving this recipe forever!! Thanks for posting it!

I followed the instructions and added more garlic than it called for, I also added carrots. I was only able to marinate it for 2.5 hours and it was still very tasty. The rosemary adds a wonderful taste and it makes the potatoes even better. The meat thermometer is a good idea. I used it to time the readiness of the meal. My husband liked it and we have leftovers for sandwiches. Thanks!

So, I had never baked a pork tenderloin before.  I usually make medallions or grill them.  I wanted to try something different, so I picked this recipe.  I wasn't too thrilled with it.  My family ate it silently (which is very unusual), and they were not singing its praises like I'd hoped they would.  The texture was a little different than we were used to, the flavor was nothing like I'd imagined...all I could smell/taste was rosemary, and the potatoes left a lot to be desired.  I was not a fan of the two cooked together.  I was pretty disappointed as I was putting the leftovers (quite a few) in the fridge...knowing how much tenderloin costs...and fearing they will not be eaten.  I probably won't be trying this one again...sorry...it just wasn't for us.

Easy recipe.  I added about 1/3c of balsamic vinegar to the marinade which gave both the meat and potatoes a little more punch.  I still may tweak the recipe a little bit the next time.  It was still just a little bland for my taste but easy, the pork was moist and the potatoes were very good.  Would make again.

This recipe has become a regular at our house.  It is so easy to make and incredibly good!  I have made it a number of times for others and I always get compliments.  A lot of times I end up not even marinating it, and it is still very good.

SO easy!  I didn't broil it at all, and since I used my convection, it only took about 35 minutes to cook a tenderloin that was about 1.75 pounds - more than twice as big as the recipe is scaled for.  VERY tasty - this one is going on my "last minute" dinner recipe list.

I made this for my family and a few guests. Everyone loved it. I especially liked it because of the simplicity in cooking it. I definitely will be making this again.

Thought this was amazing! I used a 2.5 lb tenderloin and cooked for approx 50/55 minutes. It turned out so moist and flavorful. I only added thyme and onion powder in addition to what the recipe calls for prior to putting in oven. Will definitely make this again and again.

I added a little more garlic for alittle more flavor but it was really good. It was even better as leftovers the next day.

This was such an easy meal to prepare, and very flavorful...we loved it.  We did vary the recipe slightly, added diced carrots, sweet potato, and onion, and marinated for about 1/2 hour.  And instead of marinating the tenderloin, we drizzled it with olive oil and coated with italian seasoning breadcrumbs.  Definitely will try this again.

This is an excellent recipe to work from. I added 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil an 1/4 jar of roasted red peppers and used fresh rosemary the second time I made it and got raves from everyone.

I think this needed a little extra "oomph" to be a 5 star recipe... but I think it was easy and relatively quick to make, so I will attempt to figure out how to make it a little more flavorful!

I made this just as the recipe specified.  This was a basic, tasty dish.  Not an exciting or particularly flavorful dish, but one that made for a good, easy weeknight meal.  I will certainly make this dish again.

Disappointing, to say the least.  Needed more salt for sure, but probably would still be rather bland.  Yes, it was easy, but that isn't enough for me to make it again.
