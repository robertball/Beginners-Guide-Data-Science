12.7.15  A lot of ingredients for hummus, but the finished product is worth the effort.  I used a can of garbanzo beans, drained & reserved the liquid, and ended up adding about 2 Tbsp of the liquid back to the hummus to get a spreadable consistency.  I felt fairly certain just from reading the ingredients that I’d like this recipe, and I wasn’t mistaken.  Layer upon layer of flavor.  I do think a healthy shot of Sriracha would be a god addition.  Do allow time to chill, as we thought the flavor improved greatly on the second day.

I made this recipe for a Ladies' event at church.  It was a hit!!!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  :)  I left out the PB as some cannot eat it.  The hummus still came out wonderful.  No one in the produce section of our large grocery store had a clue about Thai basil or the difference between it and regular basil.  I finally found Thai basil in a jar in the Asian section of the market.  One tip -- I made it in my Vitamix & had a hard time.  Next time I will definitely use the food processor.

Worth the trouble to find all the ingredients.  Exotic flavor with a sweet pop combine with the deep chickpea flavor to create an amazingly new combo.

Excellent! I added tahini that I made from one of your recipes and garnished it with roasted garlic and olive oil. It was creamy and fresh.

Liked it.  Was a little too sweet for me so I'd lessen the sweet chili sauce next time.  Bell peppers were my favorite dipper.  Other veggies and pita chips were good too.
