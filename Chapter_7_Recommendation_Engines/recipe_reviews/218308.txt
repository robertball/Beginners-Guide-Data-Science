The original recipe was submitted using reduced fat cream cheese, cottage cheese and yogurt.  I do not reccomend using fat-free as the texture of these will alter the final product and make for a runnier frosting.  Also if you do not have butter milk on hand, you can make your own!  Mix 2 tablespoons white vinegar with fat free or reduced fat milk, stire and let stand for 5 minutes.  This is usually what I do, since I have no need for a large bottle of buttermilk after I make this cake.  You can also use egg whites instead of the egg beaters...instead of egg beaters use 4 egg whites.  You may also need to add additional powdered sugar to stiffen the frosting.  Remember that the nutritional information will change if you alter the recipe.

This "cake" does not taste bad, but neither does it taste like cake either.  It was an experiment to me, and every single person I served it too agreed that it much more closely resembled a sweet, dense red velvet muffin.  The cake was extremely heavy and short. The icing was delicious but did not taste like normal icing and was difficult to spread because it was so thin.  It was much more similar to overly sweet yogurt.
I also found that the artificial sweetener was funny tasting and needed to add some sugar to keep the cake from tasting awful.  The original recipe called for 1 1/2 cup sugar so I added about 3/4 cup sugar to this recipe.  
I would NOT recommend this recipe if you are trying to make something that resembles a traditional red velvet cake, or trying to make a cake for other people.  However, if you're just trying to be healthy and eat it within your own home, go for it!

Not bad, but I got to say, using fat free isn't nessairly the best for you. Low fat foods and fat free have lots of added chemicals to them,preservatives, and don't tell me wrong a TON of artificial sweetners, whenever I bake I use natural cane sugar, 1% cottage cheese, 1 cup buttermilk because all the ones with no fat are really bad for you. But; nicely done cake, without cheese or milk it could be vegan.
