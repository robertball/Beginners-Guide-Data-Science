5 Stars and More!!!  Made this after seeing it in the Allrecipe's Magazine and just couldn't resist.  Made exactly to recipe and it turned out so tasty.  The sauce was delicious and added to the overall flavor.  I think next time I make this I will not add any extra salt.  Other than that....perfect!  Thanks SandyG for submitting this and to Allrecipes for publishing it.  I might not have tried it otherwise.

Excellent! Saw it in the magazine and it turned out exactly like the photo! Served with couscous and sautéed spinach. Next time will add a little corn starch to thicken up the sauce and will cook the chicken a little longer than recommended (mine was a little under-done at 2 minutes per side.) Will definitely make again.

Made this last night for dinner with blanched home grown green beans and mashed potatoes. Wonderful recipe. I did not have the dry white wine so I used low sodium chicken stock instead. I also slightly thickened the sauce with 1t of cornstarch since we were running behind and didn't have time to let it simmer for a bit longer to reduce. :) It is now in our regular rotation for dinner.

This dish was delicious! The only thing I changed was to add 2 tbsp of corn starch to the wine sauce to thicken it up a bit. will definitely put this into the rotation! :)

So yummy! Maybe the one thing I would change is using less chicken broth. The amount called for takes a long time to reduce while the chicken is waiting.

Way to much Sage!!  We took the Sage off after awhile and that helped mellow the dish.

I think this is the first recipe that I've made that looks just like the picture in magazine! Fabulous taste, my husband said it is his new favorite chicken dish. Didn't modify the recipe; simple ingredients, great flavor.

Loved it! I like the suggestion by one of the cooks that added capers to the sauce. I will try that next time instead of salting the chicken. We used large sage leaves from our erb garden. They were a little too pungent but probably because they were cooked within minutes of picking. We will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

SO good!  Added a few capers at the end and a little garlic powder with the salt and pepper. Quick and easy.  I could serve this to company!

Made this for my parents, including my poor mother who currently has a broken leg.  It was so delicious, I think it made her forget about the leg for 30 min or so.  Made as written with sauteed garlic and spinach and couscous on the side, as well as a good chianti.  Pretty easy, but feels fancy.

To get the total meal calories 350 - 400, and to lower sodium, I used thin-sliced chicken breasts and then wrapped with just one slice of proscuitto, and used low sodium broth. Delicious!

I have made this twice and love it. It's so easy and tasty.  Once I made it with provolone and the other without, it was fantastic both ways!!

My family loves this (chicken+bacon=no brainer).  I cook the chicken in butter and skip making the sauce.  I serve this with cheesy mashed potatoes.  Really, good.  It seems 'fancy' but is relatively simply.

My new favorite!  I followed the recipe as is and it is wonderful!  I served it over orzo pasta and just used the sauce to flavor plain orzo and it was yummy!

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. Husband loved it. I cooked chicken on med/low heat and put a lid on to assure chicken was moist when finished. I have added to my recipe box and will make again. Great way to jazz up chicken.

I saw this recipe in the Allrecipes Magazine and it reminded me that a neighbor had made this for our family after I had some surgery about a year ago--we loved it then and loved it again tonight after making it myself.  I used fresh basil leaves from my herb garden instead of the sage --it was a wonderful substitution.  Also, I made half the sauce amount and it seemed adequate.  I just wish thin slices of prosciutto were less delicate to handle and wouldn't keep breaking up as I work with it.  Great for low carb watchers!

I made this because it was in the most recent Allrecipes magazine.  It was featured as a "weeknight winner".  No way, it was  way too time-consuming for a weeknight.  In addition, it was way too salty even though I didn't salt the chicken.  Lastly, the sage flavor was nearly nonexistent.  Will not make again.

It was ok but I don’t know if I’d make it again. It just didn’t seem to have the pizazz I was expecting from reading the other reviews. And fighting the prosciutto slices that were stuck together was a bit of work.

My husband and I did not care for the spooning sauce. It didn't matter, though, because the meat was terrific and can stand on its own.

Family loved this!  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for a couple hours first. Didn’t have sage leaves so used a small amount of ground sage. I did use fresh basil leaves to get the look of the sage leaves. I dusted the tops with a small amount of Italian bread crumbs and put that side down first in the hot oil. The gravy topping is important so I made a corn starch/water mixture and put that in the drippings with enough chicken stock to make all the sauce I knew my family would want.  Delicious!!

This is in my favorites now. I make it almost every week. Easy and delicious.
