This picture shown does not give this justice...please replace pic with another one...i have made this many times and it doesn't look like what the first pic shows...i don't know what that is...it looks more like chocolate cake lava cake ...than chili...kind of scary...this is actually a beautiful meal comes out colorful and flavorful not like the pic very dark and scary...no it is very tasty and even pretty to look at when straight out of oven...sorry to whoever posted pic but seriously, i know it was probably a bad shot but do us all a favor and remove it...it doesn't look like what it is suppose to...but recipe is great ! thank you!

This was so easy and really tasty! The only thing I'll do differently next time is increasing the amounts on the spices and adding them to the meat while it's cooking with the onion instead of with the other ingredients. I used two lbs of beef and a little extra on the other ingredients as well (12oz salsa, a bag of frozen corn) and it made an enormous casserole - I used a 4.8 quart dish and it was probably enough for 6-8 people.

I made it just like the recipe said to and it turned out great. I doubled everything. For a large family outing! I cooled it and served it the next day reheated and everyone loved it! This is a fail safe simple recipe that most will enjoy.
