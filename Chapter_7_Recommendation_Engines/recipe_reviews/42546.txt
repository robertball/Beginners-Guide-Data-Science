The only time I change a recipe is if reviewers follow the recipe and don't like it and then change some things and wind up loving it.  This was not the case with these potatoes.  Everyone who followed the recipe seemed to really enjoy them.  Why some reviewers made substitutions without trying the original is beyond me.  I followed the recipe to a T and they were absolutely delicious.  Will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

We had a dinner party for 22 last night and I wanted a potato dish that would hold and could be prepared early. These potatoes were WONDERFUL! Like many other reviews, they were tender and creamy as though they had cream or cheese in the ingredients. I quadrupled the recipe and I am very happy we have one pan left for leftovers! I highly recommend making them as written...you will not be disappointed!

I know this is a side dish, but I read a few reviewers that said they added ham.  So I did the very same, then omitted the salt.  OMG!!  The result was SPECTACULAR!!  Because I was afraid the juice from the ham would make this too soggy, I only added 1 1/2 cups chicken broth instead.  Otherwise, I did exactly as directed.  This is a definite meal when you add the ham.  I cut mine up in large chunks, as opposed to little cubes.  I did two layers...potatoes, onion, ham, potatoes, onion, ham...then more potatoes and a few onions sprinkeld on top.  Served this with fresh steamed asparagus and warm, buttery sour dough dinner rolls. No leftovers!! 

THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!

I have made scalloped potatoes for years and always sprinkled the layers of flour, salt/pepper, potatoes, milk and now I wonder why I waited so long to change to a recipe calling for a sauce.  The sauce if anything is creamier and I did not change anything except added parsley to the top also just before browning.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very yummy recipe, the potatoes came out really creamy, everyone loved them. What I did though, was I sauted the onion, salt and pepper with a teaspoon of garlic first, then I whisked in the flour and let it cook for a about a minute before adding the stock and mayo. I also added 2 tablespoons of Parmesan and a little parsley. Then I mixed the sauce with the potatoes in a big bowl and then emptied it all into the baking dish. I also added  about a 1/4 cup shredded cheddar for the last 15 minutes.

Really good...and well worth the 2 hour wait to eat them!  I did sub light sour cream for the mayo and used a bit more of it and also added garlic in between the layers of potatoes and onions.  A definite keeper - thanks!

I hadn't liked scalloped potatoes as a kid and decided recently to give it another shot. This recipe worked out very well. It's very easy to make. The only change I made was substitute light sour cream for the mayo and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Delicious!!

I was so hungry for scalloped potatoes and had never made them myself - but this recipe was so easy and delicious!  I used sour cream since I was out of mayo, and added parmesan cheese and fresh parsley to the top for the last few minutes in the oven.  Great recipe!

Good side dish.  The only changes I made was to add fresh minced garlic & some white sharp cheddar cheese to the sauce .  I think it would have tasted just as good without the additions.  Easy!

Great recipe!  I usually dread the 2 hour wait since I have to plan so far ahead, but this weekend my mother-in-law took the dish and microwaved the potatoes and onions in the casserole dish for 15 minutes after they were layered/prior to pouring the sauce on it.  Then we popped it in the oven for 30 minutes and it tasted exactly the same as when we baked it 2 hours.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made EXACTLY as recipe indicated. We liked the flavor of the white sauce which I'm sure is due to the chicken broth and mayo. Very creamy,very very good. 
If I were to change anything then it would no longer be the recipe intended and far too many people are doing this on many recipes. Comments should only be on the recipe written, not with your additives. If you want to make it your way,and you have a good idea, submit yours. Comments on taste is what this is all about. This was good as it!

It didn't take that long to cook for me, so my potatoes may not have been as big as called for thus the faster cooking. This was yummy and really down home tasting. My family liked it all around. We ate leftovers today for lunch. It is a great simple recipe for special potatoes. I sliced my potatoes on a mandeline, thinly, and I sprinkled about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top. I had checked them after about an hour and ten minutes, put the cheese on and baked about 10 more minutes.

I agree with other viewers it is perfect as is without altering anything. However, I have made it completely vegan, using vegetable broth, earth balance butter, and vegenaise (instead of mayonnaise) and everyone loved it and they couldn't believe it was vegan! Thanks for a great recipe!

Just looking through my reviews, I realized I had not reviewed this recipe.  I've used this recipe many times and recommended it to my friends.  It received raves from my family at a reunion and from guests at my table.  It's easy and delicious "as is". No need to add cheese.  At Christmas, however, I was crunched for time and assembled it, then put it in the microwave for about 10 minutes,stirred it gently so I didn't break up the potatoes, then put it in for another 10 minutes. It turned out tasting just fine, it was done, it just didn't brown.  I'd do it again like that in a pinch, but the browned in the oven potatoes are better.  I'm making them for company again tomorrow to go with baked chicken.

First time making scalloped potatoes and it turned out perfectly! There is no need to alter this recipe in any way. I halved the recipe because there are only two eaters in the apartment. I used 3 large baking potatoes and increased all the ingredients by a little bit, eyeballing mostly. It looked soupy at first but after 10 mins out of the oven, it got absorbed. Would love to see what this would take like with cheese. I like the simplicity of this recipe and the fact that it's low-fat. Definitely make again!!

My whole family loved this recipe. I love that it is lower in fat and calories than traditional scalloped potatoes and you will never miss all the cream and cheese!

Made these in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours. very yummy. I did add 1 tsp onion powder & 1/2 tsp garlic powder too add more flavour.  Put whole crockpot under broiler for a couple minutes to get a nice golden top.

I have never made scalloped potatoes before. However, last evening the mood struck when I found this recipe. I made exactly as written (no substitutions or tweaking as is my usual MO). They were very tasty and tender. My family enjoyed them, too. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

WOW this was Excellent. Followed recipe to the "T" plus added leftover Easter Ham cubed 1/2 pieces. Layered ham with potatoes and onions. So delicious, this is just what I was looking for in a Scalloped Potatoes Recipe, made from scratch with a Roux, not condensed soup.
This is definitely a keeper.

I read the very first review and decided to give it a try too! I followed everything exactly (and it took everything in me not to improvise with spices as I was making the mixture in the saucepan) but one little taste and wow! The sauce was good! I knew it would make some of the most perfect potatoes, and I was super happy it didn't require milk as I just ran out! So impressed. This is my new staple potato! Thank you to both the chef, and the reviewer!

Great recipe!  The sauce had an awesome flavor.  I add a little cheese to the suace and seasoned the potatoes and onions with salt and pepper before putting them in the baking dish.  I also made a bread crumb topping to add some texture.  My husband and I loved it!

Even my pickiest child ate these.  They were easy and delicious.  I forgot to add the chopped onion so I took another reviewers suggestion and added french fried onions to the top towards the end of baking time.  I also baked at 350 to cut the baking time down.

YUM. I subbed veggie stock for the chicken, as I'm vegetarian. The only qualm that I have with this recipe is that once all of the wonderful potato slices have been delicatedly and intricately placed in the baking dish, it is hard for the thickened sauce to seep down to the bottom layers. I would perhaps recommend pouring some of the sauce when you've layered about half of your potatoes to ensure more even distribution. I also added a heaping tablespoon of dijon to the sauce mixutre.

Loved this recipe, I've never made scalloped potatoes & this seems like a foolproof recipe. I only made a couple of changes, I seasoned my potatoes w/ sea salt, black pepper and garlic powder & added shredded parmesan cheese ( for the last 30 minutes). I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Outstanding!  I was very hesitant as Scalloped Potatoes with a rich cream sauce are a comfort food for me, but since this recipe is good deal less calories, I had to try it.  Very happy I did, the whole family just loved them!

My husband said he had to make himself stop eating this. I have to say I was surprised how nicely flavored this dish was with such simple ingredients that most people have in their pantry.  I certainly will be making this again.

This dish is delicious!! Didn't change a thing about it & don't plan to next time! Came out perfect in texture & flavor. We loved it with our meatloaf dinner! Is definitely one of our favorite potato sides so far. Thank you SO much for this recipe! :)

I made this exactly the way the recipe stated..  Next time, I will definitely substitute sour cream for the mayo - it tasted mayonnaisey to me.  Still, great recipe, and SO DARN EASY!  :)

I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out!  I worried that 2 hours was too long to cook them, but the potatoes came out perfectly cooked.  I used red onions and instead of chopping, used halved skinny strips, which contrasted nicely with the potatoes.  Also added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1 c. shredded sharp Cheddar to the sauce.

Speed it up by increasing heat to 375 and stirring the pan after 30 minutes.  Cuts the cooking time to 1 hour.  Otherwise, excellent recipe!

Really good.  Tastes even better the next day.  I liked the fact it called for chicken soup instead of milk.  Will definitely make this again.  I did lightly salt & pepper each layer of potatoes and onion. Just added 1/2 the salt called for in the sauce.

These were awesome!  I made them for Christmas dinner and everyone in my family loved them.  The sauce is fabulous!  Just like the other reviewers have said the potatoes come out so creamy.  I contemplated adding cheese (because everything's better with cheese, especially potatoes!).  But I'm glad I didn't, they did not need it at all.  In fact I think adding cheese in addition to the butter would have made them too oily.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was once they were done I removed the foil and put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes to brown them.  Best scalloped potatoes ever!

Great recipe!  I took another reviewers suggestion and cooked potatoes/onions for 15 min in microwave and then added sauce and cooked 30 min in oven.  Worked perfectly!

oh wow! This is so good!  I followed the recipe basicly as written, except I needed to make it glutin free.  I used 2 tbs of corn starch instead of the 1/4 cup flour and used Helmanns real mayo. next time I will add a little more salt.  This is definatly a keeper. Thanks!

I made this ahead, just as written, and it turned out great. I didn't double the sauce or anything and it wasn't swimming in sauce but nice and creamy. Great recipe, don't change a thing! Unless you want to put cheese on the top. A little cheese never hurts.

Yummy comfort food!  Served this with a ham for Easter and everyone loved it.  Decided to increased the pepper to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder for extra flavor after reading other reviews about it being a little bland.  Also added 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese in the layering and subsequently decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  Now a family favorite ~ Thanks!

Very, very good.5 large potatoes for me made 3 casserole dishes worth. They were large russets. Keep this in mind. Maybe 4" white potatoes or something. Either way, it's very tasty, and I won't be making it again soon, since I have a ton now. *grin*

These were good, and very easy, however for our taste they seemed to lack something in flavor and richness.  I attribute this to the use of mayo as the only "creamy" ingredient.  I think I will continue looking for other recipes.  Note, if you make these, do not be concerned when pulling them out of the oven to find them very "liquidy".  The liquid is all absorbed within 5-10 minutes of removal from oven.

Wonderful recipe,  I did use only 1 cup of Chicken Stock, and and 3/4 cups of skim milk.  Had to have my milk....But It turned out to be the best I've ever made.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I followed the recipe to a tee other than subbing sour cream for the mayo, and adding 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the top. My wife said this was the best potato dish she'd ever had, and she's a potato-aholic! Baked for an 1 1/2 hour at 350º. Five stars and highly recommended!

Very good alternative recipe for potatoes.  My only problem was my perception of a large potato is different from theirs b/c after slicing my potatoes, I could see that 2 cups of broth would not be enuff so I added another cup of broth and another tablespoon of flour.  Glad I did, after my alteration, the were perfectly covered in just enuff sauce.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic and topped them with a cup of cheddar cheese and they were the perfect side dish to my beautiful fillet of salmon, thanks!

The only change I made was to use homemade turkey stock instead of chicken broth.  Everyone in the family loved it and there were NO leftovers.  I also cooked the onions in the butter before stirring in the flour.  Uncoverd the pan for the last 20 minutes or so because I like a crispier top.   This would be good with cheese on top too, I may try that next time.   Definately will be making this often

I was so tempted to add things to these potatoes, like cheese or garlic or chives. However I made them exactly as the recipe was written and I'm glad I did, these were so creamy and so delicious, I will be throwing out all my boxes of scalloped potatoes and making these from now on!!

I made this for a family gathering on New Years Eve. I wouldn't have believed you could make scalloped potatoes without milk! Everyone really liked it. They were surprised when I told them it didn't have milk in it. Definitely will make this again!

We make this often, it is excellent. We do add some meat, ham or kilbaska sausage, and some cheddar cheese on top. We uncover it 1/2 hour before done to allow the cheese to get a nice color to it.

I used my Kitchen Aid so maybe my potatoes were sliced too thin, but these were the blandest scalloped potatoes I've ever had.  I will go back to my  mom's recipe that is more of a cream sauce (milk included) and cheese on top.  I was very underwhelmed by these.  I wanted a change up so that's why I tried this recipe, but I regretted it.  There was no party in my mouth.

WOW!!!  This is so good I almost cried.  We haven't had scalloped potatoes since going gluten free/dairy free almost a year ago because I always relied on sour cream and condensed mushroom soup.  I made this with dairy free margarine and rice flour.  Delicious!

Wow.  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first dish out.  I did add a little more broth as it only covered the potatoes 1/2 way up, but I think it would have been fine if I had left it as is.

Got excited when I saw this recipe and started making it before I realized it needed to cook 2 hours!  So I made it in the microwave!  Microwaved it for 30 minutes in a covered baker and then let it sit for about 15 minutes with the lid on... it was FABULOUS.

I've used this recipe quite a few times now, and it's a huge hit with my family. I've done it directly by the recipe the first few times, but sometimes switch it up a bit. 

If the long cooking time worries you, you can do this in the microwave. I nuke it for 20 minutes then finish it off in the oven and get it done from start to finish in about an hour.

These potaoes turned out wonderfully. I would have never thought to use chicken broth. The broth added so much flavor to the dish. I did cheat and added some aged parmesean shavings before putting in the oven. I will definately be using this recipe again in the future.

Very yummy!  I added more pepper than called for and 1/2 cup of colby jack cheese sprinkled on top 10 min before pulling it out of the oven.  Will make again!

These are the Best scalloped potatoes!  I've made them several times and the only change I made was to add ham and top it off with French's fried onions for the last 10 mins of cooking (uncovered).  Delish!

Tasted good, a bit different than the normal cheesy potatoes. I would make again over the cheesy ones because it still tastes good but is healthier.

I'm sitting here eating my second helping and just want to say that these potatoes are really, really good.  I added ham to the layers to make this a meal, rather than a side dish, and I sprinkled some cheese on top near the end of cooking.  My picky step-son said that the person who came up with this recipe is brilliant ;)

So nice to find a recipe  without the can of cream soup. It is just hubby and I and I usually have to scale down most recipes.  This was tasty and nice and creamy.  I did cheat a little.  I nuked the potatoes while making the cream sauce and only had to bake for an hour.  Thanks for another keeper.

These were really good, but they stuck pretty badly to the bottom of the dish so I would recommend greasing the dish beforehand with butter or something.  Otherwise they were very tasty and I appreciate they weren't covered with cheese or smothered in cream!  Made them seem just a little bit healthier!

I've made this recipe several times and love it. I forgot to rate it. I usually make more when I make this because we like leftovers. I use a lower sodium chicken broth and this last time added fresh chopped chives from the garden. Yum. It's so rich tasting, especially with a little more mayo. No one would believe there is no milk or cheese in it. I'm sure I'll be making this again and again.

Overall--great, easy recipe.  Very forgiving if you're increasing the recipe or need to alter the cooking temperature/time to accommodate other menu items as well.  The only thing I would change is to add some fresh herbs to the sauce, but it's still a wonderful stand-alone recipe.

I had an hour until dinner when I spotted this recipe and almost didn't make it because of the cook time.  I thankfully read "klake's" review about microwaving potatoes and onions for 15 minutes first then adding sauce and baking for 30 minutes.  It is our new favorite! (Even with two picky 7 year olds! Yay! something new for dinner!) Thank you for the awesome recipe.

We very much enjoyed this recipe. I doubled it because of guests but I only used 7 potatoes (maybe my potatoes were just very large) and they filled a 13x9 pan. I had this on the bottom shelf in the oven...maybe a mistake because they were very, very done in 1 1/2 hours. Added some cheddar cheese and melted/browned under the broiler. Will make this again...just enough leftovers for my son-in-law to put in his lunch tomorrow.

Easiest scalloped potatoes i've made.  Family loves them and has become an instant favorite.  Will continue to make.  I didn't change the recipe it's great the way it is.  But i usually do double it and bake in 9 x13 pan to make sure there are left overs.

I've tried a few scalloped potatoes recipes on this site and this is by far my favourite. My super picky, never gives a compliment, husband really liked them too. I made these ahead of time (early afternoon) for dinner so the only small change I made was to make extra sauce to make sure my poptatoes were covered so they wouldn't brown while waiting to be cooked. Awesome!!

These we good, but I would have liked a little more sauce. Maybe next time I'll double the sauce and layer it in. Also, added a thin layer of grated cheese on top and it was delicious!

Wonderful potato recipe. I've made it twice now and my family loves it. I did not change a single thing. I gave this recipe to my daughter who was so happy to find that neither sour cream nor milk was needed. The chicken broth brought such good flavor to the potatoes. I made Scalloped Potatoes for many years when my children were growing up, but it never went over as well as this recipe. Please try it first before changing any ingredients. You'll be glad you did!

This dish was fantastic! I followed the recipe to the T and all my friends were raving about it! The potatoes at the top were rock hard though - so I advise covering the dish with aluminium foil and removing the foil at the last 20 mins, to ensure that the potatoes at the top remain soft!

This is an incredibly tasty recipe,  I too like many others put on cheddar cheese on top during the last few mintues of the baking.  The sauce cooks up so nice and thick and creamy  My family loved it!! This is a keeper and to be shared with many of my friends,.

Wow - almost guilt free scalloped potatoes that taste great.  I sliced my potatoes in the food processor for uniformity and speed - worked good.  I did add just a bit of cheddar to the sauce and then sprinkled some on top just for the last 20 min. of cooking.  Went great with the pork chops we had tonite.

My husband HATES all potatoes except fries.  He RAVED about these.  I actually overcooked them so that the edges became crunchy and he loved that most of all.  I am so happy to finally have a potato recipe that he'll eat!

This was a great recipes.  Creamy and delicious.  I made it vegetarian by using vegetarian "chicken" broth and I also used veganaise instead of mayo.   Parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top would probably be a good addition.     The cooking time of 2 hours seemed to be too long.   When I took the potatoes out, they seemed to be almost falling apart.  ( I have an oven thermometer so I know it was at 325).  Will cut the time next time I make these.

I"m giving this 5 stars because my son went back for 3rds...and my hubby continuously said it was good. I liked it as well, I just wish it looked better on the plate. Totally tastes better than it looks. So don't be scared when you take it out of the oven and think to yourself "Oh boy...do I want to try it?" ;) Try it, you'll be happy you did.

These potatoes are fantastic! Like another reviewer suggested, I first sauteed the onion in the butter with garlic, then added flour, brother, mayo. I also added parsley and paprika (~1/2 teaspoon each) to the finished sauce prior to adding it to potatoes.  This will be my new scalloped potatoes recipe!  Note: to make gluten-free, add cornstarch instead of flour, it works just as well.

I love that there is no milk and less butter than a traditional scalloped potato dish.  This turned out very good.  I sauted the onion with the butter, used 1 more potato than in recipe, increased the broth to 2 cups 
'cause of the extra potato, and cooked it in a 4 qt. rectangular baking dish to cut down on cooking time{1 hr.} Cheese on top last 5 min. or so and it was excellent!  Not the same as standard scalloped potatoes, but awesome as it is.

I'm sure it is me, not the recipe.  SCALLOPED POTATOES ARE DEAD TO ME.  I screw it up horribly everytime.  This time, of course, it is Christmas morning and I have 22 coming for dinner.  I did screw it up last Christmas too, but realized it at serving time.  So, this year is actually better given it is 8 am.  

Despite all the excellent reviews and a doubtless wonderful recipe, here's what happened to me - I tripled the recipe and used a single large lasagna pan.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I decided to cook it in advance and warm up for the dinner - but when I looked at it the potatoes were all grey and completely unappetizing!!  Also, the 'sauce' stuff didn't make it between the potato layers.  Best advice - if you are going to double or triple, do it in separate pans.  

Cripes.  Maybe I'll use the cheese I got for appey's and make mac and cheese????

Many people in our family are lactose intolerant and it is hard to change old family favs to be milk-free.   Because this recipe uses chicken stock and mayo instead of milk-this was a very lucky find for our family!  I have made it several times as directed- the only change is I usually triple to recipe as my family inhales it!  It is delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing:).

These scalloped potatoes and onions are FABULOUS!!!!!  I made them last night for supper, and it was so easy, the only thing I did different was added shredded cheddar cheese (mild) and placed pork chops on top after browning the chops.  What a fantastic dish!  My husband and son loved them and requested them often!
Will keep this recipe handy!!  Thanks!

This was my first time making scalloped potatoes from scratch and I enjoyed the fresh light flavor of this recipe and the ease of them.  In the future I might try changing the mayo with sour cream just because I don't care for mayo that much.  Everyone at my Easter table really enjoyed them and there weren't much leftover even after doubling the recipe!

So, so good! This recipe has redeemed my opinion of potato scallop since I have bad childhood memories of my Mom’s recipe – a lumpy, mushy pile of potatoes and onions floating in some milky sauce.  Ick.

This recipe caught my eye – no milk.  I tried it and my even my little ones (2 and 4) loved it.  I even made it twice in one week!

Follow this recipe exactly as instructed you’ll be enjoying a simple but absolutely delicious potato casserole.  Perfect for those of us who are still buried in the middle of winter.  Thanks for the recipe sydny, this will become a regular in my repertoire.

I tried them the second time but didnt have chicken broth or mayo, so I used beef broth and sour cream....excellent substitutions.

This is the only side dish that my family requests again and again.  As the kids are big fans of potatoes, they actually prefer this side dish to french fries.  I too was skeptical about using chicken broth instead of milk, but it came out really creamy.  Great flavor!

Well, all five of my kids loved it!! I loved the fact that it had no milk, as my daughter is lactose intolerant.  It was creamy and delicious and I made only one modification.  My daughter is also celiac, so I used rice flour, otherwise I did everything just like the recipe.  No left overs either!

This recipe is amazing and always brings great results and compliments.  The first time I tried it I followed the recipe and they were awesome but the second time I made a few changes to our taste.  I sliced the onions instead of chopping them, stirred in 1/4 cup  cheese whiz when the sauce was cooked and poured it over the potatoes.  When it was cooked I sprinkled the top with dried parsley, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, 1/4 cup bacon bits and 1/4 cup chopped green onion and put it back in the oven until the cheese had melted.  We can't get enough of them and can't stop eating them.  By far the best scalloped potatoes I have ever had. OMG they are soooo good! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  It's one of my favourite comfort foods.

I am absurdly picky about the taste of food these days and really didn't expect much from these potatoes.  I decided to try them because of the reviews.  They were delicious.  I like them better than scalloped potatoes made conventionally which I doubt I will ever make again. Well done!!

I'm sorry to have to give this a poor review, but after following the directions exactly, the dish was tasteless and mushy. I usually make scalloped potatoes starting with a similar roux, but then adding milk or cream and my seasonings. I wanted to try something a little different, and I noted that this recipe was rated quite highly. I can't for the life of me figure out why.

Made these for Christmas dinner and served with Ham, altho I like these potataoes I would have preferred a cheesy kind to go with the ham. I will make these again(I followed the recipe) but will pair it with a different meat. Seemed like a great lighter alternative to the usual potatoes. Go ahead and put the onions in you can't taste them after they have cooked down.

I'm really surprised at the great reviews on this recipe.  I served it for a holiday dinner, followed the directions to a tee, and I actually got a comment that next time I should go with the boxed stuff.  Yes, it was a rude comment, however it was probably true.  They tasted ok, nothing special, and it looked grey and sloppy on your plate.  Is ok for a everyday dinner, but nothing special.

I added all ingredients except the mayo, my family does not like mayo. I found it bland and maybe the key ingredient is the mayo other than that it was good. Next time I will try a little variation like some suggestions from the reviewers

This recipe is even better than those recipes made with milk. I used boullion mixed with hot water. Adding hot water to the flour mixture makes it thicken much faster, too. The chicken broth adds an extra oomph that I never realized was missing from using milk.

Very tasty scalloped potatoes!  Only adjustment I would make would be cut back on the salt slightly or buy low-sodium chicken broth.

Love this recipe! It took me a while to master the sauce, but I finally made it work for me. Have tried variations, including a mix of Yukon gold and sweet potatoes... With gruyere cheese or ham between the layers it becomes a meal instead of a side dish. This is probably my favorite recipe I've found on All Recipes!

Made this as part of mis7up's Hidden Treasures challenge.  This has been in my recipe box since 12-29-2010.  We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was much lighter than your traditional scalloped potatoes that are made with milk and cheese.  I thought the chicken broth added a lot of flavor to this recipe.  I did not peel the skins off the potatoes and covered the pan with foil.  Baked with foil for 1 hour, uncovered and baked for 30 additional minutes.  Perfectly baked and delicious.

I followed the recipe exact and my husband loved it. He said it reminded him of scalloped potatoes he used to have in high school.. and to him, it was a good thing. For me, I wasn't too big of a fan as he was. I think next time I would incorporate cheese into it - that's the way I like it.

I was not sure about this recipe because I had never had scallop potatoes without cheese. But It was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and son loved it. There was no leftovers left. This is definately a keeper.

This is my go to scalloped potato recipe.  I've made it many time and it always tastes perfect, usually I add cheese too.  It has taken way longer to cook almost every time I've made it but always gets rave reviews.  During a large dinner for guests (Easter I think) I made it and let it cook the whole day in the crockpot.  Kept my oven free and worked like a charm...  even got the crispy bits on the outside.  :)

Excellent recipe! Easy to make...the only time consuming part was peeling the potatoes. Since I own a slicer, it made slicing the potatoes very simple. Great recipe to serve with a roasted chicken or maybe even during the holidays!

Made this for a catering job without trying it first. It did get very watery. I don't know why. I like the addition of the onions. So, next time I will make mine the old fashioned way with the addition of onions and maybe the manonnaise too. However, I think I will stick with the evaporated milk instead ofr the chicken broth. Might put in a little chicken seasoning. Thanks for these ideas.

Honestly theeeee best scalloped potatoes evarrr! I used fresh garden potatoes, and fried the onions for 3 minutes or so and then layered between potatoes. WITH the addition of 3 or 4 cloves of garlic ( I put it in everything ) I sliced them thinly like the potatoes and scattered through out the dish. I never made scalloped potatoes before, but going forward this is a new side dish I'm keeping. Thanks for sharing

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it came out great.  It was very tasty and I will definitely rotate this into my dinner routine.   My only change was to broil dish uncovered at 400 degrees for the last 20 minutes of the cook time to give it a nice golden brown finnish.

So simple and awesome!  Loved it!  I had 4 tablespoons of butter left in my fridge, so I just threw it all in thinking that the extra tbsp would enhance it, but it didn't, made it more oily.  So don't feel that you have to add more butter, it doesn't need it. If you use a 13x9 cake pan, this will cook a lot quicker, took just an hour.  Keeper!

We just loved these potatoes!  I used white whole wheat flour from Trader Joe's and reduced fat mayo and added a bit of garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  So great to find a scalloped potato recipe without cheese.  Thanks so much!

This is a great recipe for someone like me that is lactose intolerant. I added regular onion and some green onions plus a little cayenne and poultry seasoning along with salt and pepper and it turned out so good. The leftovers tonight were just as good.

OMG!!!! These potatoes are soooooo good! I was a little worried because when I made the sauce I forgot to add the mayo but when the dish finished the sauce was thick and creamy and had a ton of flavor! So I didn't even need it! Thanks for posting this recipe!

easy to prepare- and delicious but takes so long to bake!   I prepared it in the morning which was nice. I used red potatoes. I forgot to layer onions so mine were all on top- gave it a nice texture.

Very good and easy to prepare. I may reduce cooking time, or lower the temp, because an entire layer hardened and burned to the bottom of the dish. Most likely user error though! What was salvageable was delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

These are unbelievably good!  The ingredient list may sound odd, but the results are the creamiest potatoes.  The recipe is perfect as written.  Team these with Beth's Meat Loaf, from this sight and a salad and you have one great meal!

Made this as written and it's pretty bland.  Next time, I'm going to melt velveeta cheese into the sauce and pour over the potatoes.  Everyone at our party added garlic powder to their plate.  It was just missing 1 little ingredient to make this dish a 5.  Paired this with "chicken fried chicken" from this site and "Bruce's hot barbecue sauce" from this site.

We LOVE these potatoes!!! After making them according to the original recipe, which was a big hit!, I tried adding a cheddar cheese layer in the middle, and again as a topping after the sauce went on. Mmmmmm... Try 'em, you'll love 'em!! Bon Appetit!!!

I added ham as others have and I also cooked mine in the slow cooker for about 4 to 4 1/2 hours on low. This bought me more time to get other things done before dinner.

This was so easy and so amazing!  I'm sure this will be at the top of the request list from my family.  I added just a little cheddar on top because my family loves cheddar but it wasn't even necessary.

Excellent side dish. Prepared it just like the recipe (even though I thought a LOT about adding some cheese). It was excellent as is and was a great hit. Will definitely prepare again. Might experiment with some cheese on one side of it.

I really enjoyed these potatoes. I followed the recipe fairly closely except I used low sodium chicken broth and light mayo. I did add the salt. Next time, I will check the potatoes as they are baking because I would like them not quite so soft.

Made this for New Years Eve after searching for some kind of "fancy" potato dish.  I was persuaded to try this based on the many four and five star reviews, and I was NOT disappointed.  It has a very simple, but still rich potato flavor and the subtle spice of the broth, mayo and salt and pepper really complimented the savory steaks and veggies I was serving.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Easy to prepare and delicious.   I only had one cup of broth so I used milk for the remaining liquid.  It turned out fine.  The only bad part is having to wait two hours before I can eat it!  It's worth the wait though.

An awesome scalloped potato recipe!  Very easy to turn into a super tasty vegan side dish!  I used Canola Mayo, soy butter, and veggie broth instead of chicken broth - but kept all the proportions the same.  Do not be afraid to make to pans of these potatoes if you are planning on taking them to an event, as they will go fast!  I did omit the paprika, but only because I has run out, and they were still fantastically flavored.  Also, if you prefer to have a browned top on your potatoes, uncover and let cook for the last 20 minutes.

This is a very good recipe. The timing is alittle off but, everyone cuts potatoes different. Different thickness' with potatoes mean different cook times.I have made it several times and.....my husband doesn't know it is lower fat ;) In fact, nobody has noticed! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a fantastic dish. I am not a fan of onions and was able to replace this with ham for a nice scalloped potato and ham recipe. I did add some onion powder to the mix and it was delicious! Thank you!

I picked this recipe because it didn't call for any cheese so I could add as much or as little as I wanted and I am very happy with the results! I followed the directions completely with a small handful of cheese on the top; I used the four cheese Mexican blend.

I fixed these and we enjoyed them a lot. Hubby was late getting home so they were in the oven more than 2 hours and were well done but so good. Not dried out or anything. Will definitely make again.

Very delish.  I added a generous handful of grated sharp cheddar to the sauce the last minute of cooking and the same to the top of the casserole during the last 10 minutes if cooking; my kids/husband gobbled it up.  I also used 1 T. mayo & 1 T. Light sour cream as a substitute for 2 T. mayo.  Very creamy and because my kids were crazy for the melted cheese on top, I may try adding a bit of grated chesee to every layer with the potatoes/onions next time.  Great recipe.

I made these to the letter with the only exception of adding crumbled Italian sausage. Even though I drained the sausage quite well, this recipe turned out very, very greasy. I may try again with only the original ingredients, but I'm a little disappointed.

Good basic recipe, but IMO tastes a bitt better when you add a bit of milk, and season your potato/onion layer with salt, pepper and onion powder. You can change to au gratin by melting a handful of shredded cheese to wet mixture.

I would have only given this 4 stars because even though these were good, I wasn't blown away.    However, my husband and the friends we had at dinner said it was a 5 star recipe for sure.  My husband said it was the best scalloped potatoes he has ever eaten.  I did alter slightly - I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and about 3/4 cup parmesan.  I layered half the potatoes and onions in the dish, then I poured half the sauce and a layer of cheese before added the rest of the potatoes and onions.  I topped with the remaining sauce and cheese and uncovered for the last 20 minutes of baking so the top would brown.

I was skeptical, but glad I tried it. I've never made scalloped poatoes without tons of cheese and a million calories. I did use nayonnaise (soy based mayo sub since I am allerica to mayo) and it turned out nicely. Thanks!

I carmelized the onions first and it gave it a much better flavor.  Try adding chicken or broccoli for a delicious one dish meal.  Also good with vegis and chicken baked over brown rice.  You will not miss the milk sauce at all.  This is delicious!!

Very good but I think it would be better to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

I took a chance based on the rave reviews and made this dish for Easter dinner with my family of "foodies".  After many years of scalloped potatoes later - they raved over this one and called it the "best scalloped potato dish ever!".  They were shocked that there was no cheese/milk.  I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely in a 9x13 pan.  Used Pam spray in the dish and the clean up (as opposed to scalloped potatoes in years past) was a snap.  No sticky pan!

I probably won't use this recipe again.  The potatoes had a good flavor from the chicken broth, but I didn't find them creamy at all.  As a matter of fact, they were dry.  And when I added the mayonnaise to hot broth, it congealed and I never did get it mixed in real good.  Think I'll stick with the ol' milk recipes.  Thanks anyway.

It is good for what it is, a dish to celebrate the potato with minimal distractions. I would have liked more sauce, although I was amazed at how good it was without milk. It had a nice flavor by itself, I just wish there had been more as the flavor was subtle. I found myself adding a little more salt and wishing I had added a tiny bit of garlic or more onion, or maybe a small amount of grated sharp cheddar cheese. I will use this recipe in the future, with minor additions, and more sauce.

absolutely the best. I have been trying to find a recipe for 30 yrs. Haven't liked any until now. The whole family enjoyed them and I have even passed the recipe on to my niece who said her husband who eats anything without comment, loved them. Did not change a thing. Thank you

Left out the mayo because I didn't have any. Did half the dish as scalloped potato and half as scalloped broccoli and cauliflower. The latter side was delicious. Highly recommend trying. Both were yummy.

This is so good and a no brainer!  Go by recipe, add some garlic powder and parsley.  Make sauce first and then thinly slice potatoes (otherwise potatoes get dark).  Slice onions into rings, and then make 2 layers of potatoes and onions.  Add sauce and cover with foil.  Bake @350 for 45 min. to 1:00, take off foil to crisp the top or add cheese.  No need to par boil potatoes or sautee onions.  It comes out great!

Gee, I hate to give a bad review, but this just wasn't for us. I read the other reviews, I used fresh potatoes and chcken broth,  I added extra onion, I added garlic, I added paprika, I made sure the dish cooked long enough, I stuck it under the broiler for a couple minutes to make sure it was done...it looked great. I found it almost tasteless, my wife complained it tasted/smelled strongly of fish; nether one of us enjoyed it. I am trying to find a scalloped potato recipe which will keep me away from Betty Crocker. Unfortunately, this wasn't it.

This recipe is great just the way it is.  But, if you want to speed things up...parboil the sliced potatoes for about five minutes and bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes.  I tried this tonight as I was short on time, and they came out perfect!

I'm rating this a 3 because I thought there was a key ingredient missing (of course to my preference, but still likable by most everyone) and then factoring in that after I recalculated it to serve 12, there was too much onion, but that's not the recipes fault, as onion can be overpowering in quantity. I should have scaled the onion down and added more if I felt it was necessary. I also don't have 2 hours to make this, so I altered that, too. My changes were: 1) peel and slice potatoes then boil to tender crisp then drain 2) Sweat out your onion slices in a drop of oil in a non-stick pan (using them raw on a quick cook method makes it too oniony) 3) add 1 cup freshly shredded cheese of your preference (cheddar and monterey jack for us) 4) scale back a bit on the broth and halve--if not eliminate--the mayonnaise so it's not too oily/greasy. (I guess fat-free mayo would also add the flavor and not the fat, but could be too sweet.) I just combined the wilted onions and drained potatoes in a casserole dish, then poured the cheese/broth mixture over it evenly and baked for 35 minutes at 350º. (Optional - reserve some shredded cheese and sprinkle on the last two minutes of baking and then turn broiler on for a little bubbly cheese effect at the top.)

I made these for a family dinner Christmas day and they were the hit of the dinner.  My 90 year-old grandmother who is a phenomenal cook sang praises and THAT is an accomplishment!!  They upstaged the ham I spent of ton of money and time on!  I think the special touch of the mayo (I used light mayo) and good quality paprika were the winning touches making these DELICIOUS! I LOVE THIS WEBSITE!! Thanks All recipies!

I've made these several times, occasionally with variations when I didn't have an ingredient on hand (like subbing sour cream for mayo, beef broth for chicken broth, etc.), and they have always been great. I am just wondering, though, has anyone ever doubled the recipe? I am thinking of doing that for Thanksgiving, but I am wondering how it will turn out if I still use the same 13 * 9 inch pan.

I'd like to say two things first: 1) I always change recipes, and 2) I really don't like mayo. That said, I did not change a THING in this recipe and it tasted AMAZING. This is now THE scalloped potato recipe for me. It's fantastic! (My potatoes were pretty thin, though, so it only took an hour at 350.) Thanks so much!

The BEST scalloped potatoes I have ever eaten!  I've never had good luck with scalloped potatoes and have tried a lot of recipes.  This one is wonderful.  I did sprinkle a little parmesan and mozzarella in the last few minutes uncovered but I really could have skipped that, it was so good.  So rating on the original recipe (no cheese) I'd give it 5 stars.  Also 5 stars with the added teeny bit of cheese too.  :)

I never thought i would change my usual scalloped potato recipe but i'm so glad I tried this one. The only thing I did different from the origional recipe was to par boil the potato slices for about 15 minutes as I didn't have 2 hours to allow for cooking time. Oh, and i kept the onion in slices and added a green pepper. It was perfectly done in about 45 minutes. These potatoes burst with flavor. Delicious!

I had to "half" recipe from 6 to 3 (actually for just 2), but it came out just fine.

One change: did not have any paprika, so used very little salt for recipe and sprinkled seasoned salt instead of paprika on top before baking, worked just as well, if not better.

This was great!  I have to admit that I was skeptical but the other reviews and easy preperation sold me.  I'm glad I tried it..these flew out of the pan..no left overs of this!  I have to admit that I threw some grated cheese in between the layers because I was scared that they wouldn't be cheesy enough for my family..It came out great but I think it would have been great without the added cheese.

I made this recipe and it was delicious and creamy.  I doubled the onions and followed the advice of another review where I sauteed the onions first.  I really liked making the sauce separately and I do think mixing it with the potatoes and onions before putting it in the pan was good.  I did bake it for 1hr 45min in a convection onion. Took off the foil 20 minutes before it ws finished.  A wonderful dish for Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it!

These were the BEST!  Made the sauce as directed and added leftover ham to the potatoes.  I also added shredded cheese to the top about 15 min. before it was done and finished baking uncovered.  I did increase the heat to 375 and it was done in a little over an hour.  EXCELLENT.  Have made it 3 times already in the last 2 weeks for different events!  My whole family loved it!  The first time I made it my husband and I ate almost the whole entire dish by ourselves!  We had to remove the dish from the table or we would've eaten the whole thing!  Have also passed this recipe on to several friends and family since I made it and they all have had the same results!

These weren't like any creamy scalloped potatoes, I've ever had. But, I like that they had a great peppery and yummy flavor, that my family loved, and they are lowerfat. By time we were able to sit down to dinner, they were a little overcooked (no liquid left) but my family loved them that way. I guess I will overcook them the next time, too! Lowfat, cheap, and liked by all... there WILL be a next time.

This is in our regular rotation now. I slice the potatoes with a mandolin and use bouillon to make the broth (then omit salt).

This recipe was great!  It's nice to find a scalloped potato recipe that doesn't use mountains of cheese.  I used red potatoes I'm sure Yukon would have been good too.  I used yellow onion and it was fine.  I didn't have a 2.5 qty pan so I used a 3qrt and there was no issues.  I wouldn't change this recipe at all beyond types of potatoes, it's just so simple and good!

You know when you're trying out a new recipe and there comes a point in the preparation when you know, you just KNOW that it's going to turn out delicious? Well that's how this dish was for me! When I poured the sauce over the potatoes and onions I knew it was going to taste good, and it did!  My family ate it up. I didn't have ready made chicken broth so I used a tbsp of chicken boullion and 1 3/4 c. water.  I also used 2 tbsp of plain yogurt instead of the mayo. I didn't have paprika either so I just sprinkled the top with Mrs. Dash table seasoning and it still tasted great. I was worried that it might have had too much onion, but I worried for nothing. The onions didn't overpower the potatoes. This recipe definitely goes in the recipe box! Thanks for an easy and tasty dish!

Yummy, easy recipe.  I don't normally like onions but they were great in this recipe, they didn't overpower at all.  Can't recall if the recipe calls for it but I add some paprika to the top of the dish near the end and it adds a nice flavor to it.

They were pretty good!  I would add a little parmesan to the top of it next time, though.  Also, they cooked in an hour instead of two, which was pleasing.

Rating this 4 stars because if you follow the recipe (even if you have to change a couple things) it still turns out great (but not amazing). I had to use half chicken and half vegetable stock because i ran out of chicken.  I also had to use miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.  Still came out great and the sauce was so simple and good.  My only objection to it was that it was pretty bland. It needs a spice to give it some character.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These potatoes are absolutely delicious!  The recipe is definitely a keeper.  I was afraid the bottom layers might be a little dry so instead of pouring all of the sauce on the top, I drizzled a little of the sauce on each of the lower layers and then put the rest on top.  I slso scattered tiny dollops of butter on the top of each layer.

This was really good, and easy to prepare.  I used 4 VERY large potatoes (Costco size) and that filled up an entire 13x9 inch pan.  The sauce as directed was still plenty, even though I had my doubts.  It cooked up moist and delicious, although I thought it missed a little something- I think the addition of whole, roasted garlic cloves would really add a nice dimension to the flavor.  Even without that I would make these again.

These are THE BEST scalloped potatoes I've ever eaten - let alone made!!!  The only addition I had - some melted cheddar cheese during the last 5-10 minutes.    A new family favourite!!!

I found some things lacking in this recipe. The sauce was bland and inadequate for the amount of potatoes I had. I added a can of cream of potato soup, undiluted. I layered the potatoes onions and sauce individualy and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top. I baked it for 1 hr covered and for 1 hr uncovered. I think I will stick to my familiar recipe from now on.

Very good recipe.  I scaled it up for 12 people, used a 13x9 pan, baked 2 hrs. and it was perfect. I used a bit less onion though.  Great for when you are tired of the same old cheezy potatoes recipe.

I followed this recipe to the T.  Everyone liked it. It's easy and has ingredient that most have on hand.  At first I thought that the sauce would be too thick, but after baking it was just right.  Hard to believe that there is no milk in this recipe because it is so creamy.

I changed the recipe a bit.  I added a 1/8 square of cream cheese and 1/3 cup of cheddar cheese.  I also added some garlic, onion, pepper, and seasonal salt.  It was delicious!  My husband ate three servings.

I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings for my husband and me and baked it in small individual casseroles in the toaster oven for an hour.  Did not change anything except for not adding salt and it was delicious.  Hubby said they were about the best he ever had.  These will be a regular for us.

4 stars because I made some changes...however with my changes, I give it 5 stars!  I couldn't bring myself to use chicken broth - I have never heard of chicken broth in scalloped potatoes - and no milk?  So, I used skim milk instead of chicken broth.  I did use everything else called for and also added 2 cups diced ham (hubby won't eat scalloped potatoes without ham).  This was so delish with my changes, I believe the mayonaisse made a difference and am glad that I didn't deter from using it.

These were fantastic!! The only change I made was adding about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar to the cream sauce. They came out creamy and rich and were very easy to put together. It's a simple yummy dish and I highly recommend this recipe.

I sometimes use vegetable stock if that is what I have. I had trouble with the mayo going lumpy so use sour cream now. I have also browned my onions, celery and garlic first in the butter and love the deep flavour! I then add more raw onion  between the layers.
My Dad was not a fan of traditional  milk and flour scallop potato but loves this one.

these potatoes turned out fantastic...just the right amount of creamyness.  My husband loved them and normally hates scalloped potatoes.  I used smoked paprika to add a little something extra.

This was delicious as it is written! Especially if you let it cool off a bit before serving. Surprisingly creamy seeing there is no milk or cheese in it.   I will most certainly make this again.

I have been making these for a long time now. I leave out the onion for personal pref but replace it with a little onion and garlic powder. I was skeptical of the mayo the first time I gave the recipe a try. But its amazing!

delicious! Now that I've made them from the recipe and know that they are good, I'll start adding the goodies that make them even better. I love how they taste so cheesy without an ounce of cheese in them.

My family did not care for this dish, they said it was bland and tasted like the instant scalloped  potatoes you get out of the box.  I didn't change a single thing on this recipe and followed it to the letter.

I honestly don't know what all the rave reviews are about. I made this for company for Sunday dinner and was so embarrassed! I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was so dry and bland it was like eating spoonfuls of dried potato flakes.

It was a good recipe just not outstanding. My husband and son liked it a lot but I think maybe I was expecting more flavor and built it up in my mind to allow room for disappointment. Great basic process that came together nicely, I would just add some Adobe season all.  I also seasoned the potatoes w/s&p after they were sliced.

This is one of those recipes that is really high rated, and it leaves me scratching my head on why I didn't like the taste.  Maybe scalloped potatoes just aren't for me.

It's too bad you can only give 5 stars... I'd give 10. I've been making scalloped potatoes for many many years but this is THE BEST I've ever made. Next potluck I'm taking this dish and a whole slew of copies of the recipe to hand out. I didn't change a thing, I cannot think of a single improvement any one could make. Deelish

I followed the recipe but I added 6 ground up garlic cloves and then cooked for 90 mins and took it out and added 8 oz of cheese and cooked it another 30 mins and it was fantastic and received compliments all around.This will be a long term recipe for me thanks for sharing!

Really good.  Might season them up a little next time but will definitely make again.  I put the potatoes and onions in the micro for 10 minutes before adding the sauce to speed up cooking time. Thanks for sharing

A great starting recipe. I made it with two layers of potatoes and onion, adding chopped ham and fresh spinach layers. I decreased the broth to 1.5 cups. Fabulous!

I doubled the sauce part because I put it in the fridge overnight with 1st batch of it on it.  Then second night I cooked it for half the time and was not spreading at all.  So that's why I doubled.  I need to slice the potatoes more thinly also.  Very good.

Pretty Good.  I doubled the recipe and it came out really runny/greasy.  It tasted better the next day.  I prefer white creamy scalloped potatoes that I sometimes add some shredded cheese to.

This recipe is awesome.  I've made it a few times (exactly per recipe) for family meals and it's so good you can't stop picking at the leftovers.  Can throw some cheddar cheese in too if desired.

This recipe is great.  However, I did change it due to not having chicken broth in the house.  Instead I added milk.  I give the credit for the flavor to the ingredients I got from this recipe; mayonnaise, lots of onions, the layering of the pota + onions and the small amount of red pepper I added.  thanks.  heaj

I used my food processor to slice the potatoes evenly thin. I used dried mince garlic to save time of crushing fresh garlic. I also added capers. It was delicious even for my pickiest eater.

This was delicious, creamy, and simple.  I added ground mustard and garlic powder.  During the last 30 minutes, I topped with parsley and shredded cheese.  Perfect.

Made these potatoes the other night-had to come back and save the recipe to my recipe box!  Everyone loved them!  I added Bratwurst, peppers and onions to make a casserole.  Cut up the bratwurst into bit size pieces and sauteed with the peppers and onions in a little beer while pre-cooking potatoes in the microwave. Put everything together then into the oven for about 30 minutes adding panko crumbs and a handful of cheese in the last few minutes and broiled just to brown.  Absolutely the best!

This has become my favorite potato dish.  The potatoes always come out so rich and creamy.  The first time, I made the recipe as stated, but felt they were lacking in tastes just a bit.  After that I began adding a handful of cheddar cheese.  This recipe is so easy and tastes amazing!!!

I was leery of this recipe at first because of the mayo... let me tell you, I'm SO glad I made it!  These were the BEST scalloped taters I've EVER had and they couldn't have been easier!  I was also nervous at the amount of onion but really they just sort of melt into the onions!  Even the kids (well 5 out of 6) LOVED them!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated (don't like to change a recipe the first time) It was as good as everyone claimed it to be. It does tend to have a more chicken-y flavour because of the broth, which we all enjoyed. Definitely will be my go-to recipe for scalloped potatoes. Give it a try if there is lactose intolerance in your family.

I'm going to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and give it 5 stars.  The first time I made it I had some humungous potatoes from the garden so figuring if they were equal to five large potatoes was difficult.  I just sliced enough to fill a 9x13 glass baking dish.  Needless to say it came out a little dry albeit with good flavour.  This time I used the same amount of potatoes but I doubled the amount of sauce.  I added half the sauce after I had layered half the potatoes then added the rest of the potatoes and topped with the remaining sauce.  I baked covered for the first hour and a half then uncovered for the remaining 20 minutes or so.  People said they were the best "Scalloped Potatoes" they'd ever had.  Thanks for the recipe, made me look like a hero :o)

Where was this recipe thirty some years ago.  Made it last night as a side dish for our Thanksgiving ham and my husband's words were"These are the best freaking scalloped potatoes I have ever tasted".  So after thirty three years of guessing, this will be the one that I will keep near by.  Made it exactly and sprinkled sharp cheddar on top. MMMMMMMMMMM good.  Mind you not good for me who is trying to watch what I eat, but i do enjoy cooking for my guys.

Made this for our early Thanksgiving dinner in Canada and there was nothing left at the end of dinner!  Everyone loved these.  Only changes I made after reading a few reviews: sauteed the onions for a couple of min; added a pinch of garlic powder to the sauce; 20 min before, uncovered and spread 1/2 with shredded chedder cheese, b/c my husbands family likes cheesy potatoes - but they all said that the side w/out cheese on top was great too.  Broiled for about 10 min to get the top really bubbly and browned.  Thanks  for a great recipe!

Mmmm really this is soooo good, I don't know how there can be any bad reviews at all. Honestly if you use the wrong broth it will taste disgusting. I did that once, I used the "no name" broth and it was horrible horrible. I only ever use Campbells Chicken Broth and that one time I decided to try something different and never again will I do that. I also put the paprika in the sauce not on top, i'm never a fan of that, I always like my spices in the food not on top. Great recipe, really really delicious.

They were only okay.  Followed the recipe precisely.  Consistancy wast great, but tasted a little like the potatoes that come out of a "roast" which are not MY favorite.  Tried, but will not make again.

Great recipe and easy to put together. I think next time I will do half the layers and put half the sauce and then repeat again. The layers are so tight that I don't think just pouring the thick sauce over the top enables it to get into all the layers properly. I removed the lid for the last 20 minutes.

These potatoes were delicious and super easy to make with my food processor that I used to slice both my potatoes and onions. I followed the recipe exactly (I doubled it to serve 15 people) with one minor exception; I topped the potatoes with cheese and paprika. The end result was delicious, but not really heavy with cream and butter like a lot of scalloped potato recipes.

These is a great recipe!  So easy to make and I love the fact that broth & mayo are used instead of a condensed soup or heavy cream.  I added one minced clove of garlic to the sauce and layered in Parmesan cheese. I cooked the sauce on medium heat and did not remove it from the stove until it was nice and think (could take over 2 minutes). First time I ever made scalloped potatoes and I am keeping this recipe. Also, the sauce can be tweaked with your favorite spices should you feel like experimenting!

These were the best we ever had. My husband could not stop eating them. I added cheese to the middle and top layers and baked for 2 hours. Served with smoked maple ham and glazed honey carrots. YUM YUM!

So Yummy! Added some Garlic with the onions because we love garlic! and I didn't have mayo, so I used sour cream.
I used my mandolin to cut my potatoes so it made this recipe easy!
Thanks

These were excellent1  I cooked them in my pressure cooker though.  Also, i found that I only had 1 1/4  c broth so I did use some milk to finish it out. I love onions in my potatoes so I did add another 1/4 cup.  Will definitely make again.

When I was putting this together the smell reminded me of deviled eggs.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just odd for scalloped potatoes.  Anyway, I wasn't blown away but this was pretty good.  The sauce turned out nice and thick.  Definitely check your potatoes at the one hour mark.  Mine were done in just over an hour.

Made it exactly as written and was FANTASTIC. A HUGE hit with everyone at Christmas dinner! My only comment, 5 potatoes was too much for my 2.2 quart dish (all I had), probably only needed about 3.5 large potatoes or 4 medium.

I added leftover ham pieces too and the family loved it.  I used a sweet vidalia onion and I used small red potatoes and left the skin on them.  The casserole had great flavor and not as heavy as the ones made with milk.  I also left out the salt since ham was added!  I will definitely make it again.

After reading all the great reviews, I decided to make this for a potluck. I wanted to get away from the higher fat versions that contain cheese and even more butter. Beyond doubling the recipe, I followed it to the T. They were BLAND and COLORLESS. I was embarrassed because folks are normally used to me making something tasty. Two lessons learned . . . never try a new recipe on company & never trust the starts in the review section.

wonderful.  i've made this recipe several times.  i slice the potatoes first and put them in water so they don't brown while i'm getting everything else ready. i don't change any of the ingredients but i do add ham because it makes it more of a stand-alone meal and not just a side dish

Excellent as written!  Kids and adults love it.  We have had it with and without cooked ham - both great!  Thank you!

Good flavor & super easy.  I added sliced Kielbasa to it to make it more of a main dish/casserole.

This was the first time that I have made scalloped potatoes, and it certainly did not disappoint. I liked that this recipe isn't weighed down with tons of calories from using cheese and other dairy. The potatoes turned out very creamy, and the baking time was perfect. Will make again for sure!

this was amazing and easy, I really liked using the sauce instead of milk!  I added a few leeks to the recipe and it was really nice.

This was great!! I have tried to make scalloped potatoes before and it did not turn out well. I recommend seasoning the sauce with seasoned salt and pepper for a really nice flavor. I also added cheese on top of the layers of potatoes and onions. Again, this recipe was great!!

Seriously fantastic.  I didn't change a thing -- a first for me! Oh, wait -- I did add chopped fresh parsley on top, but that hardly counts!  Really great, husband devoured it, sorry I didn't make more!  A perfect combination to the sole with tomatoes recipe also on this site.  Great!  Thanks!

I tried to stay true to the intent of the original recipe and avoided weighing this down with cheese.  I sauteed the onion and 1 tsp of minced garlic in the butter, added the flour, and finally added the broth, mayo, salt, pepper (doubled to 1/4 tsp) and 2 tsp dried parsley.  I stirred the sauce into the potatoes and put it all in a greased pan.  I also did not peel the potatoes and sliced them as thin as possible...I thought it wouldn't take a full 2 hours to bake, but that amount of time was perfect.  This makes a nice potato side dish that isn't so heavy...adding cheese or making potatoes au gratin would be a different recipe.

Awesome recipe for scalloped potatoes.  I did substitute sour cream for the mayo and I sauted my onions in butter first.  I love that this recipe is lighter then most with the chicken broth instead of heavy cream, etc.  I was alittle bad and added alittle bit of cheddar cheese to the top about 10 minutes before the dish was ready.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!!

Best scalloped potatoes I have ever eaten! I made the recipe as written with the only difference being that I used Vidalia onions.  They are my favorite type of onion and currently in season.

Love this recipe as-is. I did try it once adding a little cheese on top, but I found it didn't really affect the taste and was just as good without.

The only way I have ever made scalloped potatoes is with milk. I thought I would try this recipe since I'm not able to tollerate a lot of milk. The bases for this dish is a lot like my baked potato soup. I really liked this. I will be made here many more times.

Very good and easty to make scalloped potatoes. I made 2 pans of this. One pan using the recipe just as stated (omitting the onions since I have family members who don't like onions - I substituted shredded cheddar for the onions and used a tsp of onon powder to add a bit of the onion flavor) and for the other pan I did add the onions and topped it all with a some shredded cheddar cheese adn foontina cheese. This was a sure fire hit. Yummy!

This was wonderful. I followed the ingredient list exactly as it was written. However, I didn't have the 2 hours that it need to bake so I sliced them thinner than I have ever sliced anything in my life and prayed that they would be ready in an hour. They were ready and delicious!

Excellent recipe. I often add a little parmesan cheese between the layers of potato along with the onion. People I've made this for say it's the best scalloped potatoes they've had! Bravo!

really really good! it takes a long time, which breaks my normal rule of 30 mins or less, but since scalloped and au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite, i gave it a try. it was a good success. only thing is that my flour/butter mixture clumped when i added the broth and mayo and i'm not sure how to fix this. other than that, its great.

I really did not like these...I thought the mayo gave them a an off flavor.  I guess I'm just used to scalloped potatoes made with heavy cream or milk.

I am lactose intolerant and it is hard to find a recipe without milk, cheese or cream of (fill in the blank) soup.  This is perfect.  Delicious, nutritious and easy to make.  Didn't need to change a thing!

very good and very yummy.  This recipe turned out wonderful.  It also did not take 2 hours to cook and I found 1 hour was almost enough.  I have used chicken and beef broth and will try vegetable broth next.  I also always skip the mayo as I am not sure how much it would change the taste and we prefer not to eat processed packaged foods.

I followed this recipe exactly and this to be a solid recipe.  My very picky nephew (3 years old) helped prepare it and devoured it!!!  I also have a child who cannot have milk products and substituted the butter with a safe substitute without issues.  I will most definitely make this one again!

The first time I made it exactly as the recipe read. It was a 5 star dish. Tonight I added left over ham and increased the sauce just slightly. This was also a 5 star winner. Thanks for sharing.

Soo delish and easy!!I made a large casserole dish of this so I should have doubled the sauce but it came out great! I also used cream cheese instead of mayo.Whipped up the cheese with some stock in the microwave..perfect!

This was fabulous and flavorful!  I served this on Christmas day to rave reviews.  It is amazing how decadent this is without cheese or cream...so rich and satisfying.  I followed the directions except I did not measure the onion...I just used one baseball sized onion chopped.  Great recipe...a keeper!

Different flavor than I was expecting.  This not your traditional cheesy scalloped potatoes.  Still good, will make again.  These taste even better later.

Delicious!  Really like this version without the milk base.  Cooked for about 3 hours total, 1 hour uncovered with some cheese melted on top for the last half hour or so.  Was a big hit with everyone!

It's more like onion gravy, a little runny for my taste.  But it's been a hit both times I presented this dish to the dinner table.  I think I will continue my search for something creamier.  Thanks though!

I made these two years ago Christmas when we had guests over for dinner..made the following changes which made a difference in how it was: added 2 T. parmesan cheese, 1 T. bacon bits, 1 T. minced garlic, 1 t. thyme, 1/4 c. or more shredded cheese for the top 15 minutes prior to taking out of the oven. I should've pre-cooked my potatoes as they were a little crunchy after 2 hours, but no matter, the dish was still FABULOUS! Am planning to use this recipe again for Christmas Eve this year.

Everyone loved this recipe.  People were asking what kind of cheese I used in it.  For a fairly low calorie dish, it tastes extremely rich and flavorful.

This recipes was very good and even my husband who loves the scalloped potatoes I've been making for years, liked these ones.  The sauce seems to be creamier and tastes "lighter" (for lack of a better word).  I suppose the caloric and fat content would be lower in this recipe than my original recipe because it uses chicken broth instead of milk.  Fat content would be lowered even further by using low-fat chicken broth.  An excellent, easy recipe I know I'll use again!!

This was absolutely delicious. I sliced my potatoes really really thin, so the 2 hours was a little long. Be sure to baby-sit a little for the last half hour or so since everyone will slice the potatoes differently.

Amazing! I was skeptical about the lack of dairy in this, but decided to try anyways. Sliced the potatoes very thin with a mandolin and followed the recipe exactly except I added a thin layer of cheese with each layer in the dish. Everyone loved them including my husband who is a cheese lover. Will make this a staple in our house.

I had to doctor these up quite a bit to avoid a bland dish (based on how the sauce tasted before adding it to the potatoes).  I added more salt, cayenne, garlic powder, and dijon mustard.  With those changes, it was pretty good, but I did miss the milk. It had a great, creamy texture, but something about the flavor was not quite right.  I'll probably make this again, though, because I'm not supposed to be eating dairy these days (sad).  It's a solid dish, but didn't impress me.

Very good. Followed recipe ingredients but made the broth/sauce in the microwave instead of pan. Next time I may add shredded cheddar on top for last 10 minutes.

wonderful - so tasty. didn't need salt because of the chicken broth.  Changes I made: sauteed onion with the butter, then added flour.  Also added cheese to the sauce and then over top.  I got talking too much and left these potatoes in for longer and they were still great (lucky lid was on)so they may not need as much as two hours but overdoing them is okay too.

I made these for 10 servings, using the Allrecipes Calculator.  They turned out perfectly!! The only thing is that when I changed the servings, it said to use 1 & 1/4 tsp salt...when I tried the sauce before I poured it on top, it was salty.  However, when the potatoes were done, they were perfect!!  (I just didn't put any salt & pepper on top on my own plate).  Very good recipe!!

I can honestly say this was great.  I wanted to review the recipe honestly and fairly, so to begin with I did not change a thing. I made it a 2nd time and added shredded cheddar as I had a surplus.  I enjoyed it both ways.  I will say everyone preferred it when I chopped the onions finer.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  I don't know what that picture is, but they don't look like that!  Don't hesitate to try this one.  My mother-in-law had three helpings.

Wonderful!  I didn't have chicken stock on hand so used vegetable stock and was excellent.  Also increased recipe to 150% and put in 9x13 glass casserole.  Cooked in same amount of time.  Great creamy potato recipe without all that fat.  Thanks so much

Love it! I am going to make it again... and again and again.  I am only cooking for my husband and I so I didn't want to make too much of it so I estimated roughly 2/3 of the recipe and it still turned out awesome.   I used 3 large potatoes, 1 cup broth, 2 tbls margarine, 2 tbls flour 1.5 tbls mayo and stuck with about 2/3 cup of chopped green onion (wasn't sure if the recipe called for green or large onions) and it turned out awesome still (with enough for leftovers tomorrow).   Also, my oven did not have a 325'f setting so I used 350'f and it was ready in 1 hour 15 minutes (which was great since that's when the rest of my super was ready!)

My husband really likes scalloped potatoes and I haven't made them in such a long time.  He was so surprised when he saw them on the table and commented more than a few times how good they were and asked to have them more often.  I had to use sour cream because I only had about a tablespoon of mayo, but that's the only change I made.  I can't get over how creamy these were!

I realized after I started making this I was out of salt! Well I finished making it anyway and it turned out awsome!  Even with no salt.  I have made a few recipes from this site and this is the only one that I gave 5 stars.  Maybe I just really like potatoes but the chicken broth and mayo really gives this a great simple creamy flavor.  I had thought of dressing it up with bacon and cheese but it really doesn't need it, and neither does my waist-line! Perfect as is!

05/06/09- Easy to make and didn't even have to go to the grocery store before preparation as I had everything on hand.  What a easy and impressive potato dish.  Loved it!   09/08/09-  I have made these several times since my review in May.  I usually add 1 or 2 potatoes and double the sauce portion of the recipe using half and half or milk instead of doubling the amount of chicken broth.  It makes for a creamy and tasty potato dish and so easy.  I don't think the 2 hour baking time is really needed, a little over an hour usually does it.

These are fantastic. Don't change a thing, just try them  this way. I only added a handfull of cheese on top, and let it melt after they were done. I doubled the recipe, and it turned out great, everyone loved it. I have never had success like this with scallop potatoes. Thanks so much for a family favorite!

This recipe was delicious! They only took 1 1/2 hours in the oven, and came out very creamy and flavorful.  I will definately make them again.

This was such an easy recipe to make, my first time making scalloped potatoes from scratch.  I did add about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese while boiling broth, butter and flour--my family declared it "Yummy"--will make this again.

I followed the recipe as directed, as the other readers instructed, and really did not care for this at all. The onions were incredibly overpowering and the only flavor in the dish. I had very high hopes from the great reviews, but did not like this.

Excellent! I did all my prep work the day before (sliced potatoes and made sauce) and just assembled and popped them in the oven at the proper time. I added cheddar cheese, but they really don't need it. If adding cheese again, I would reduce the amount of butter so they are less greasy.   NOTE: If you slice your potatoes in advance, be sure to keep them immersed in water while storing to prevent them from turning brown. I forgot to do this and while they tasted great, they looked awful!

Made this the night before and put it in the oven in the morning on Easter Sunday. It was so delicious. I made them following the recipe exactly. Since I made a ham, it might be good to add a little ham to the leftovers.

These were very good - easy to make, and the results were what I expected. The only adjustment I made was using Smart Balance margarine and mayo, otherwise I followed the recipe.  They cooked in the same amount of time as my Easter Ham.  Will definitely make again for a special occasion.

Great receipe, great dish, great reaction, no leftovers.  Had to make a dinner for a group including a lactose intollerant person.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Everyone loved it.  Put out some grated cheddar but it really did not need it.  This was a real lifesaver for the host.

My new favorite scalloped potato recipe.  The only change I would make is to increase the sauce as mine turned out just a tad dry but the flavor was great.  Only needed 1.5 hours in the oven but sat nicely covered on the counter waiting for the rest of the meal to finish.  Great recipe.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe and how simple it is, but gave it a try.  They turned out super tasty and as expected, were easy to do.  Served with ham they were a great addition to a nice "comfort food" type of dinner.

I would make this again but I would add a few changes. 1) 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 2) 1 cup old chedder cheese grated. But if your looking for a scalloped potato recipe without cheese this is a keeper.

I thought these were great! I followed the directions but pulled it out too early. I thought my slices were a bit thin, but they really need to cook the full time stated. Regardless, my picky 3yr old ate it and loved it! I will make this dish again!

I followed the recipe exactly but my family found it tasteless and pastey. I am giving it 2 stars because it was easy to make, but there are much better scalloped potato recipes out there.

Great for when you have nothing( milk, eggs, nada) but potatoes. I had 8 small ones, but used the recipe for the sauce as is. I subbed the mayo with 1 TB cream cheese and 1 TB yogurt and sliced onions into rings. Cooked at 400 for a hr to speed things up. Most important thing- don't just sprinkle paprika on top. I covered the tops of my potatoes with the paprika and the smoke paprika flavor  made the dish. Here's where it fell short: Way too much butter, even for my 8 potatoes. Would go with 1 1/2- 2 TB, and use about 3 TB yogurt, maybe more because I like the creaminess it gave. And I forgot to add the garlic like I was planning to, and wish I had at the melting butter step then the butter would roast with the butter. Overall, good recipe.

Very delicious dish! I had to cook it a little longer and at a higher heat than the recipe asked for (but it might have been the dish I cooked it in). Yum!

OMG, this was so good. Followed recipe almost exactly except I left out the salt and added about 1/2 lb. left over baked ham and 1 large clove of minced garlic.

I have a hard time rating this.  I think I overbaked it and the potatoes came out mushy.  However, it had good flavor.  I also think it needed much more salt.  I'd make it again, just not bake it as long as the recipe calls for.

Great recipe, absolutely delicious. I've made this a few times, once put kielbasa in the pan before baking. Wonderful! Note: If you are using broth that is not sodium free, you do not need the extra salt.

It's a little on the salty side.  I would recommend cutting out the salt since the chicken broth is salty enough already.  Great taste!  To make things easier, just use a mandolin to slice the onions.

Hubby requested scalloped potatoes for Christmas dinner... and I loved that this recipe used stuff that I already had at home.  No need to buy bags of cheese or cartons of cream.  Tasted wonderful, he couldn't believe there was no milk!  Will make these again.

Wonderfully delicious and easy!! This dish was a nice change from the traditional scalloped potatoes made with cream or milk. The sauce is actually a chicken gravy that adds wonderful flavor to the potatoes. I made my chicken broth from bouillion cubes, and increased the broth to 2 1/2 cups. I also substituted the mayonnaise for sour cream, as suggested by some others, since I felt the sour cream would add more flavor. Seasoned to taste and topped with cheese at end of baking time. Baked covered at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, using a 13" x 9" buttered casserole dish. Great dish to serve with chicken. This is a must try recipe!!

I'm not that fond of scalloped potatoes but, I tried these last night and they were actually very good. I did sprinkle some shredded cheddar cheese on top after they were finished cooking and let it melt naturally by placing the top back on the dish. I'll keep this recipe on hand.

This was probably the best recipe I've ever used for scalloped potatoes.  I greatly recommend fresh potatoes which is what this recipe calls for.  The only thing I found is that it needed a bit more of the sauce, other than that it was delicious.  Next time I may double the sauce portion to pour over the potatoes.  I will definetly make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I made it as stated plus I added approx. 1 cup leftover cooked ham.  It barely fit into my 2.5 quart baking dish.  I will use this recipe every time.  No changes are neccessary.  When we heated up the left overs my husband added some cream style horseradish to his.  It added a fabulous zing.  I will try adding 3 tablespoons horseradish to the whole batch next time.  I also thought the cooking time could be reduced to 1:45, but maybe that is just because I sliced my potatoes quite thin. Either way this dish is absolutely great!  You won't regret making it!

This is so easy.  I ran the potatoes and the onions through my Cuisenart, which made this a very quick recipe.  I doubled the recipe for a dinner party, and the guests really loved these potatoes.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  I like the idea of using chicken stock instead of a heavy cream.  Like others, I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  Since I’m a garlic lover, I could not resist adding a bit of garlic powder in each layer.  I uncovered the potatoes during the last half hour of baking to give the top layer some crispiness.  The low oven temperature combined with the long baking time produced very tender and favorable potatoes.  This recipe is going to be one of my favorites.

this recipe served 6 adults with no leftovers - the onions were a bit strong to me but not to others, next time I will saute them first. I used cream of mushroom soup (had on hand) and didn't care for the mayo when I tasted it before cooking so added about 1/3 c. sour cream. turned out perfectly. may wish grease pan first since they stuck a bit to the bottom (I used a glass casserole dish) may need to lower temp. for glass next time

This was not only easy to make, but it came out came out perfectly! I prepared a ham and was in the mood for scalloped potatoes. I am so glad I chose this one---I highly recommend it!! The recipe calls for baking 2 hours or until tender--I baked it for 1 hour at the recommended temperature and it was tender by then.

These were just okay. I followed the recipe exact except I added in some leftover ham. They were good but just not as creamy as what we like. I think I will stick to my normal recipe which contains milk unlike this recipe.

AWESOME! I did make changes based on other reviews advice. Here are the changes that I made: 
I used dehydrated onions (had on had), I added them to my melted butter, along with a little menced garlic. Then I added my flour to complete my rue. Salt and pepper to taste. I then layered the potatoes, thinly sliced velvetta (had on hand), and rue. Repeated two more times. I then baked uncovered for 45 minutes at 375, 30 minutes at 400. The last 15 minutes I added shredded cheddar and mozerella cheese. Also, very important, I scaled the serving size to 3, which I beleive is half of the original recipe. My husband LOVED, LOVED these potatoes. The last time I tried to make homemade scalloped pots, it was a disaster. This recipe is perfect-with the changes I made of course. Though I would imagine the original recipe is just as tasty-we are cheese people. Husband was very impressed there was no milk involved.

I really didn't think this would have much flavor but decided to give it a try based on other reviews.  I added two minced cloves of garlic, otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  Halfway during the baking process I remembered an appointment so I turned the oven off and restarted it an hour later.  It turned out fine.  DH loved it, said it was better than mine, so now it's our recipe, too!  Even better as leftovers.Thanks.

I thought that the recipe was very easy and simple to make, I loved it. The only thing a did a little different was layered the potatoes with shredded cheddar cheese to give a creamier flavor. Other than that it's great!

This was okay with some added garlic, and MUCH better once I sprinkled some parmesan on top with extra salt/pepper.  Wish I'd baked it that way. Very creamy without milk but doubt I'll make it again. Hubby didn't like it. I use a similar recipe for Sicilian style potatoes with capers that kicks!

I love that this recipe doesn't call for cream of anything!  I used red potatoes (all I had on hand), and added some garlic, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  They were delicious!  And I used the leftovers to make potato soup - yummy!!

2 hrs seems a ridiculously long time to cook anything, but I put this together ahead of time, cover tightly and refrigerate until 2 hours before I need it. Then I pop it in the oven and do the other things I need to do.  It is well worth the time and effort!

I added shoulder blade chops to make a complete meal.I browned my meat first, made a double batch of the sauce, layed my chops on top of the potatoes with sauce, used a pyrex 9X15 glass pan. turn chops over after one hour of baking. It will melt in your mouth. Keep the same potatoe quanity just double on the sauce. The flavor was unbelievable.

Changes I made ... I used milk, instead of water, and added chicken bullion to that.  I added garlic, which blends in nicely I must say.
Left the rest of the same.
As for the thickness of the sauce ... Personally I recommend pouring it over the potatoe's as soon as it shows itself thickening, because I waited the first time, and it didn't really ... go down into the pototoe's, and stayed primarily on the top the first time.  Still tasted great though.
Needs something ... extra.  Can't lay my finger on it, but it's missing something to make it a "wow" recipe.  But ... it's a keeper all the same.  :)  Thanks.

Other than adding a can of drained corn nibblets to the layers, I made this exactly as the recipes said. It was deliciously creamy and something I will make again. Im also passing the recipe on to friends and family.

We had dinner guests last night and I tried this recipe out on them. What a hit! I did add 2 minced garlic cloves to the sauce and I sliced the onions vertically to give a little more texture. A beautiful part was that I prepared it in late afternoon, baked it and placed it back into the oven just prior to dinner. This will definitely be a "go to" recipe for me in the future. Thanks!

I'm looking forward to tasting this.  I just put it in the oven.

The sauce was delicious.  If you r an experienced cook, start the sauce first.

I added cheddar cheese and cooked chopped bacon to the layers.

I know it will be scrumptious.  Can't wait!
Thx for the great recipe.

Wow, love this recipe.  1. Basic ingredients I always have on hand. 2. So easy to make.  3. Tasty.  4. Most importantly, family friendly.  Not only did my 4 and 2 yr olds love it but the adults did too.    
This recipe would be great the way it is but I wanted to make it a meal instead of a side so I did the following.  Thin layer of potato, then layer of grated onion, carrots, and celery.  Another layer of potato, then ham and cheese.  One more thin layer potato, then sliced mushrooms.  Poured sauce on then paprika.  Thank you for this great recipe.  We will be making this a lot!

AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

Such a deliciously, cheesy, creamy, comforting recipe. I used red potatoes b/c they're starchier and soft and creamy when cooked. Didn't have mayo, used a pkg. cheddar/jack cheese, and used beef bouillon-practically what I had on hand. Otherwise, followed the recipe. AMAZING!!!!

Excellent! Because I love garlic, I thinly sliced 3 garlic cloves and sprinkled them between layers. Also, I grated about 1/2 cup fresh parmesan and sprinkled between layers, and a bit on top for an extra zip. Wonderful.

I cooked the potatoes in the chicken broth for 5 minutes to cut down on baking time. I was out of mayo so used ranch dressing.  My family raved about them.

This was an excellent potato recipe that I used to accompany my Easter ham.  We had one guest who doesn't like things with white sauce, so had never had scalloped potatoes.  She, and everyone else, loved this one.  Thanks.

Excellent recipe! Follow it exactly and you won't go wrong. I salted and peppered every layer of potatoes. I also sprinkled the tiniest bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese over every layer as well, and a bit of cheddar on top. I've also made it with ham mixed in, too. This is easily the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had!

Made this tonight for Easter. Great low fat alternative to classic scalloped pot.'s  Made ahead of time and a few of the top potatoes browned, but other than that...I did add some shredded cheddar cheese at the end and they turned out great..  Dad quoted, "these don't look lo-fat, but they are fantastic"

I love cheese, so I was a little unsure of this recipe.  But the reviews have never let me down before so I went with it. It was awesome.  My husband and mother devoured it!  I used more than 5 potatoes and more than 3/4 cup onion (red & white onion) so I doubled the sauce. Next time I'll try a little cheese on top, but really like to stay as close to the recipe as I can the first time I make it...It's a keeper!  Going to have some leftovers here soon. Thanks for a wonderful recipe...lower fat content too.

I added a bit of mustard to the sauce because I like the tang it adds.  Otherwise, this worked really well.  Be sure to use big potatoes or 7-8 small/medium potatoes or it will turn out too greasy.  Good recipe if you're out of milk or cheese but want something savory/creamy.

This was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly with one addition. I added about 3/4 cup of grated cheddar cheese on top just because I love cheese, but if you aren't a cheese nut then don't bother because the recipe is awesome as is. I think that slicing with a mandolin is critical to get the thin potato slices.

Didn't have the mayo and used 3/4 cup of milk and only 1 cup of broth, and used the college inn seasoned broth.  Flavor was fab for a usually bland dish.  Went over awesome.

This was not what I was hoping for.  It needed more flavor.  I will stick with milk, flour, butter and garlic when making scalloped potatoes.

Very tasty.  I think the broth makes it especially delicious.  Great to fix ahead and just pop in the oven before company comes.

It has been along time since I made scalloped potatoes because of the fat, calories and cholesterol content that normally comes with them!I made this dish tonight for company and it went over very well. I sliced my potatoes  thin and it only took 1 hr and 10 mins to be cooked! Not the 2hrs suggested in the recipe.I used Campbell's chicken stock and added 1 clove of garlic to the sauce, as someone else suggested.The fact that it is lower in fat and cholesterol is great!It has a very nice flavour to it. You can tell it is not made with cream, however, the flavour is very good and everyone was suprised scalloped potatoes could be this good without milk or cream added! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this recipe for quite a few years now, and really enjoy it. I do tend to go a little heavier on the mayonnaise than the recipe calls for, and find that you can't really cut back on the s&p by much (especially with a low sodium broth). I also like to sprinkle some smoked paprika on the top, too.

I've made these many times and they are fabulous.  I've made them exact as the recipe says and also adding thyme and rosemary to the sauce. Both ways are great. This has become my sister's favourite comfort food. Even my picky mother likes them! Every time I make them for guests they can't stop eating them.

I try to rate/review a recipe only if I've followed it as written but I knew going into this that I wanted cheese scalloped potatoes. Even with that modification these were awesome. In the past I've always made scalloped potatoes with milk to make the sauce. Using chicken broth gave so much flavor but didnt have the heaviness that the sauce can have(dont get me wrong, that heaviness is pure comfort food). With such a small amount of mayo, i almost omitted it because I thought "surely that adds nothing" but just in case, add it!!! These were great!!

Love these potatoes! I've since saving this recipe omitted onions from my diet. I don't add them any longer, and they are just as delicious without. I can't remember when I originally saved this recipe, but I do know it's been over 5 years ago. I remember it calling for a sprinkle of paprika on top. I still do that, and it's the best!

I have made this several times, it is the best recipe for scalloped potatoes that I have ever tried.  I was surprised there was no milk it in like most recipes but that sauce is wonderful!  (When I tried to share the recipe to Face Book it tagged a review saying that it was loaded with cheese... there is no cheese in the recipe.)  I added about 1/2 pound diced ham to it this time, you can see it in my photo.

Just made this for dinner (added ham to make it a meal).  Didn't change the recipe at all, otherwise.  My husband loved it and so did I!  Was very easy to make and well worth the two hour bake time.  I layered the sauce with the potatoes, onion, and ham.  Absolutely perfect!  Thank you for sharing.

This is a favorite in my home. My grandson is lactose intolerant and I am allergic to tomatoes. This is one of the few recipes that I can make and not have to fix something different for one of us. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I followed this recipe twice, as written. I have had my potatoes turn GRAY both times! Not at all appetizing. I'm grateful I never made them for potluck or company other than family. I have no idea why they would turn this color, but the change starts as soon as the sauce is added. As for the flavor, just not WOW!, which is what I was hoping for based on the reviews. I had to add a lot of salt to my plate to make it worth eating. Will not waste time and ingredients on this again. Added a pic of the unappealing next day leftovers.

PLEASE...save yourself some calories & try this recipe as is before adding cheese! I tried this recipe the first time because I was out of milk.  While it doesn't taste 100% like trad'l SP, the creamy sauce ends up tasting like there is cheese in there somewhere.  Also, if you're in a hurry, slice your potatoes super thin & bake in a 9x13 pan.  You can cook it that way in under two hours -- I believe I have done it in about an hour depending on how deep I make it.  Delicious!

These truly are the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had.  There is something magical going on with the ingredients, because even though there is no cheese in the recipe, these potatoes taste of cheesy goodness!  Everyone is shocked when they ask for the recipe.

We tried these for the first time last Christmas, and just the other day my son asked me to make them for this year's Christmas Eve dinner.  They are that good!

Very, very good! My husband now prefers these to the boxed kind. These are so much better for you considering you actually know what you are eating because you made it yourself. This will be my one and only scalloped potato recipe. I may add sharp cheddar next time since my husband likes them cheesy. Also, if you have a food processor with a slicing option, that really speeds up the prep process!

Very nice recipe, made exactly as directed, however the sauce either needs to be thin when poured over the potatoes or you need to add a little extra liquid and sort of work the potatoes around to get the sauce down through the layers.
DH loved it, next time I'll add some more seasonings just for my own tastes.

Added minced fresh garlic in the potato layers.  Put cheese on top for last 20 min and covered.  Thought there were going to be way too many potatoes, but it turned out perfect.

I'm very surprised at how well this turned out. It is a little on the bland side but the fact that it is so creamy without all the milk, cheese and gloppy soups I give it the full 5 stars. I'll make my own adjustments on the second round. I am shocked by the simplicity of this amazing dish. I'll be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly - probably would only give it 4 stars as is,  but added a mix by Tastefully Simple called Warm The Oven Savory Cheese dip mix.  My OH My - this was heaven!!!  I'm going to try some of the other cheese dip mixes - or Bacon Bacon and Garlic Garlic!

Simple comfort food.  A little on the bland side.  But then again that is why some people like scalloped potatoes.

I just made this to go along with Cherry Glazed Tenderloin. My BF just loved It all! Thank you so much for the recipe, It turned out fantastic! It was probably my oven, but I had to leave It for an extra 15 min. Then I kept it under the broiler for a few minutes to get a little more browned on top.

This is my new 'go-to' recipe for scalloped potatoes!  I made this exactly as the recipe said and it was excellent!  Super easy to do, too!  Nothing complicated and no strange hard to find ingredients.  Next time I may try some cheese on top for the last 15 minutes or so as I read in some of the reviews.  But it was delicious as written!

I realized I didn't have chicken stock so I used beef broth and they were superb.  However, I will cut on the margarine next time.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like it. Too oniony and lacks flavor. However, lack of milk was interesting enough to give it a try. 

BTW, for those first making scalloped potatoes don't rely on the time or precise measurement of the sauce for thickness. Use your own common sense... if it looks like it is too thick to fill the crevices between layers of potatoes, it won't. And once determined, "thin" it out... water, milk, whatever, but don't hope that pudding mess will find its way in the nooks and crannies of potatoes layers. Paste is only good spread between layers and not top down.

I made these potatoes for our son n law's birthday dinner. Because he loves cheese sauce, I chose to make a cheese sauce made of one block velveeta cheese and 2 1/2 cups milk to pour over the potatoes after they were taken from the oven. Today, our daughter called and asked for the recipe.

This recipe is fabulous. Paprika seemed a little boring so I cooked it covered for the first hour and a half without the paprika and then I added some shredded old cheddar and Italian Parmesan to kick it up a notch! Really worked well and was a perfect match with Ham Roast ;.) As for the comment about the layering not covering it enough. I just took a spoon and really stirred it together before cooking. Simple Solution ;.)

Cut that baking time way down by placing onions and potatoes in a skillet with 1/2 cup of the liquid, cover and steam until the potatoes are just tender.  Combine with the rest of the ingredients and bake 15 minutes.

Yum, Yum, Yum!!!  These were FANTASTIC!!!  I usually change recipes to our taste, but this time I pretty much went with the recipe (I did put a crushed clove of garlic in with the butter and made a bread crumb topping) and I'm so glad I did.  These were the best scalloped potatoes I've ever made!!  I made them for a party and the entire batch was eaten. . .absolutely delicious!!  YUM!!  Thanks for sharing!

a woman i invited to potluck dinner made this dish for the occasion and i have never before tasted such creamy, delicious scalloped potatoes.
i went back for seconds but i was already too late, 
everyone else liked them just as much.
she kindly showed me the all recipes site and the recipe for the potatoes and i have not made them
any other way since.
not only are they easier to prepare than my previous method with milk and flour, they beat the pants off them tastewise.
sure glad i invited her to dinner!

So easy and turned out very good! I had all the ingredients on hand so this will be a new go-to dinner. The only change I made was to add cubed ham. Who know scalloped potatoes could be so good without cheese?

First, I cheated and used two bags of sliced potatoes from the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  Amounts worked perfectly.

Second, I "veganized" it by using vegetable broth, Vegenaise, and Earth Ballance buttery sticks.  

The dish turned out perfectly!

I wanted a change from my usual scalloped potato recipe.  Made it for company and they raved about it because it wasn't as rich as the traditional recipe.  Easy to make and very tasty with the chicken stock.

Most recipes I have tried the Scalloped Potatoes seem to be dry and bland, but this recipe is easy, creamy, and tasty.  It is a keeper and does not require milk......

So easy and so delicious - followed the directions exactly except I cooked the chopped onions in the melted butter for just a few minutes before adding the flour.  Perfect!  Will never go back to using a milk based sauce for scalloped potatoes.

This was good and certainly light!  It didn't have the same creamy/cheesy flavor I usually look for.  It's much healthier scalloped potatoes and onions than we normally eat.  Don't know if we'll have it again though.  Directions are spot-on!

these were luscious and tasted rich and satisfying, as if they had cream and lots of butter...but they don't! they are my favourite new go-to scalloped potato recipe as they are actually healthy enough not to save just for sometimes like the fat-laden versions of this classic recipe force one to do. Now that Fall is here, it's the perfect time for comfort food and these fit the bill.  Don't change a thing...just make and fall in love!

I made this for dinner and followed the recipe exactly, except at the end added some cheddar cheese on top.  This was very good, my whole family loved it!! It was also very easy to make.

I know I'm definitely in the minority but I didn't care for this. It might have been that we are cheese-hogs but these just didn't seen right for scalloped potatoes.  Taste wasn't bad but it just seems....wrong to have a cheese-less scalloped potato recipe.

Excellent! I did not use mayo though (allergy to eggs), I used sour cream. Turned out fantastic. I also didn't measure the ingredients too much.

These were the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I used about 8 cups of medium sized red potatoes because that's all I had.  I also used light Miracle Whip.  They turned out perfectly and I will never make mine with milk again.  I might add garlic and some parm. next time as other reviewers suggested and I might even try adding ham to make more of a complete meal but I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome recipe! Thanks so much. The only thing I change in this recipe is when I add ham, then I cut back on the chicken broth just a bit to allow for the moisture of the ham. Note that I use uncooked ham. This recipe cuts out lots of calories of milk and cheese but still gives incredible flavor!

This was a family hit!  Didn't change anything on the recipe except the onions (I used spring onions instead) and this was so moist and delicious.  It was SOOO easy too.  Going in my recipe book for sure.

We have a list of things that I cook that are so good I'm never allowed to buy it packaged again.  Scalloped potatoes are now on this list.  I have made this recipe several times and it is always perfect.  I will say that I omit the paprika because I'm allergic to it, but I don't think it needs it!  Highly recommend it.

Delicious! I actually didn't make it per the recipe. I didn't use the flour or chicken broth.  I added about a 1/4 cup sour cream and a splash of milk to the mayo.  I also added shredded colby jack cheese in between layers. No offense again the submitter of the original recipe, I just decided to add my own twist.

This was amazing. I made two large casserole dishes of this to bring to a party. Usually you would only bring one. By the end, both dishes were almost gone. My father in law had three helpings. I will never make these any other way.  I did make a few changes due to others reviews. Instead of mayo I used sour cream and cream cheese. I also had leftover ham. So I put that through a food chopper to make really small. Layered the potato and topped with shredded cheddar cheese, along with chopped ham and onions.   It's so amazingly good. I love how creamy and flavorful it turned out.

Loved this! Used a small amount of skim milk because I didn't have quite enough chicken broth, and added a little shredded cheddar on top right at the end. Also used light sour cream instead of mayonnaise, just to use it up before vacation. Will definitely make this again.

I wish I could give these more than 3, but what others called "creamy" was more like potatoes and chicken gravy to me.  I was looking for a more traditional scalloped potato with cream.  These weren't bad if you like the gravy and potato combo.

made this for the first time and thought it was great.  The only thing I did differently was that I did not have any mayo and so I substituted sour cream.  I did tip if with white cheddar cheese.  excellent and will make again.

very good - I used a little less onion due to picky children...I had trouble with my potatoes turning gray -- couldn't slice them fast enough. Next time I would either have the sauce already made and put the potatoes immediately in the sauce, or else slice the potatoes and immediately drop into a pot of cold water...kind of a pain as an extra step, but it would look a whole lot better.  I used a large, shallow casserole dish, so they were done in about 1 hour 45 minutes.

A very good recipe - everyone told me how awesome it was! However, I wouldn't recommend making it early...the potatoes will get brown!

Needs more flavour next time. Also, the potatoes soaked up all the sauce.

this was good, but not all that great. I followed the recipe as is and the thing I didn't like was there was no sauce in the middle or bottom. it was just all on top of the potatoes. so the middle and the bottom was pretty plain.

This was a fabulous recipe!  I made this for my Easter dinner and everyone raved about it and wanted to take home the leftovers.  I exchanged the all-purpose flour with potato flour to keep the recipe gluten free, and it was great!  I did what others had suggested and about 10 minutes prior to finishing up in the oven, I put some shredded cheddar cheese on top and broiled it until it was nice and brown and bubbly.

Wonderful I made this to take for an Easter dinner -- NO leftovers and I had doubled the recipe! When stirring in the flour into the butter watch the color you can make your sauce a brownish color, not that it tastes bad, I did it, and I had nothing to take home. Excellent recipe and I will be making this again. Thanks!

This was not actually scalloped potatoes, it was good  and I actually made it because it didnt call for cheese or milk.  But it didnt taste like scalloped potatoes and I said this to my husband and he said "it tastes like potatoes and gravy" and I thought about it a second before I said, huh, thats exactly what it is.

FANTASTIC! These are my hubby's favorite way to eat potatoes, period. I especially love this recipe because it is flavorful and delicious without relying on being crusted in cheese (don't get me wrong, occasionally I add a layer on top, and it's still great). The only thing I do different is I use heavy cream instead of mayo, because since I was a kid I can't stomach mayo. Sometimes I garnish with freshly snipped chives for some extra color.

Disappointed.  Are you supposed to stir the potatoes?  The sauce did not incorporate into the potatoes, so I had sauceless, plain potatoes in the middle.  Still, the recipe has promise.  I'll try it again.

Great recipe!  Followed instructions as written - very tasty & easy to make.  Used a food processor to slice potatoes (2mm disc was perfect!) and chop onions. 2 hr cook time is too long, though.

I tried this recipe for easter dinner and it was very good. I admit to adding shredded swiss cheese and sliced green onion between 2 layers of potatoes and sprinkling some cheese on top before baking. I tested "doneness" and found that 1.5 hours was enough time for baking and a nicely browned top.  Oh! I also rubbed my glazed stoneware baker with fresh garlic before adding the potatoes. Glazed stoneware gives the best results and is a snap to wash up. The dish was practically clean when we left the table. Thanks for a nice variation for one of my family's favorite dishes.

Added leftover diced ham - left out salt Baked it in 9x9 stone dish Forgot to cover it - came out crunchy and dark on the top but Matt thought that was great Did NOT need 2 hours - 1 1/2 hours was more than enough Would be a nice side without ham

Wish I could have given this a 4 1/2.  My 3 teenagers loved this and each gave it a 5.  Very creamy comfort food.  I made a batch 1 1/2 times the original recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  The potatoes were done to perfection in 1 1/2 hours ... think they may have dried out or been mush if I'd left them in the whole 2 hours.  My  husband and I both were thinking of things we could add to give it just a bit more zip, but as a comfort food, this is an awesome basic recipe.

Loved the taste. I used home made chicken broth that had wine in it. Potatoes were a bit over baked both times I made them - reducing the time on the second round. Next time I'm going to keep the peelings on hoping to keep more structure to the spuds.

1st off, I didn't have time to cook these for 2 hours, so I covered it with foil, uped the temp to 450 and in 1 hour it was done to perfection.  It came out looking beautiful and I was excited, but when I tried them, they had very little flovor.  I had to drown it with garlic salt and parsly and top with cheese to get any flavor.  This was a good starter recipe, but we like more spices.

Excellent recipe! I've made it a few times & it's been good every time. I usually add some shredded cheese to each layer & sometimes I add real bacon pieces.

I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of these! Don't get me wrong, it was a great recipe, I like the idea of pouring the "sauce" on the potatoes instead of having to get even layers of Flour on each potato like most recipes. But the taste for me was a little bland.I'll try putting my own twist on it next time, and I defiantly will put cheese on them...whats Scalloped potatoes without cheese!

i used light mayo and these still turned out very good. i used my food processor so my potato slices were really thin. if you use your food processor check at 1 hr 30 mins. mine were almost mashed potatoes. i like to be able to distinguish the individual slices still. i served these with spicy fried chicken and Green Beans with Walnuts (also from this site)

Excellent!  Everyone loves these potatoes.  To make a hearty dinner, I sometimes add leftover diced baked ham.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was fantastic!  the only change i made was to layer in some sliced provolone cheese.  i don't know what kind of a difference it made, but i had it, so i threw it in.  this was a real crowd pleaser, and i have some VERY picky eaters in my family.  this was the hit of christmas dinner!

This had a great flavor due to the chicken stock versus the usual milk base. I used a fairly large casserole so I doubled the batch but made 2.5 times the sauce becaue I used some very large potatoes out of my bushel so it didn't seem like enough sauce. It came out very creamy and I had many compliments. I brought to our family Christmas dinner. My aunt asked me for the recipe.

This was really delicious and rather easy.  Since it didn't use milk, it wasn't runny at all and instead, very creamy.  I brought it as a side dish on Christmas day and got rave reviews.  I also added cheese on top as many others did.  Will make again!

These were good.  The kids loved them.  Not a five star rating because they weren't that creamy and I really expected something different.  I turned out like a seasoned mashed potato casserole.  Still tasty.

This turned out great. Everyone was stranded at our house because of an ice storm.  I was sick in bed, after Christmas, and  we had a house full of my husbands' family.  I instructed him to make this recipe and to slice the left over ham from Christmas Eve dinner, serve with buns and that was Christmas days lunch. Without this easy side meal, we would have had a lot of hungary people.

I liked this scalloped potato recipe for the fact that it didn't curdle like some recipes make with milk/cream.  I mixed in some leftover cubed ham for a complete meal.  I still think I like a little creamier style scalloped potatoes.

I thought it was ok. The chicken broth made it taste like there was chicken gravy all over it which I wasn't too fond of. Not a bad recipe, but I probably wont make it again.

These potatoes are easy and taste delicious.  I added some chopped garlic and stirred it every half hour or so.  Smelled so good. I kept going for the smaller, already cooked pieces and ate them before it was all finished cooking simply because I couldn't wait.

Best scalloped potatoes recipies I've tried. My entire family loved it. Followed recipie plus added in others' suggestions of parmesean chees, garlic, and thyme. Added sliced left-over ham on top. It would also be good with crumbled bacon mixed in.

Delicious!  We've tried several other recipes only to be disappointed, this recipe is perfect!  We did add appr. 1/4 cup monterey jack cheese but, I believe it would have been just as good without it.

This works for an easy potato dish.  Don't cut the potatoes too far in advance (like only 30 minutes), because they discolor fast.  Made a double batch for 10 people, and had way too much.

This recipe was a little bland for my taste.  I made it according to the directions, however next time I will try adding some garlic.  Overall, a decent starter recipe.  I just think it needs to be jazzed up a bit.

Excellent!  I used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 3 and think I could have gotten away with using just 1.  After slicing the potatoes I boiled them for about 10 minutes.  This reduced the baking time back to less than 1 1/2 hours.

Good, but I think next time I'll reduce the amount of onions (by half) and the sauce (by a quarter). Tasty, but a bit rich for my liking.

WOW! I tried this recipe exactly, and it was FANTASTIC!! I shared the recipe with my sister who did not have mayo and added ham and some garlic powder...loved it also. This is one of the few recipe's that does not need tweaking, very VERY good

These were so good and soooooo easy. Followed the recipe exactly but did change the bake time and temp. Made it with meatloaf, so everything baked at 350 for an hour and a half. Potatoes were a little mushy but still very good. Next time I'll try baking them for just an hour. When I make meatloaf again, of course.

The easiest scalloped potatoes recipe I've made!  I love the fact that it's not loaded with dairy products.  I sauteed my onions in the butter and then added the flour to make the roux.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These potatoes were very good.  I was concerned there was not any milk in the recipe but they were still very creamy.  I'll be making them again and again.

Dish turned out exactly as I expected.  Followed the recipe exactly except I did sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top when I took it out of the oven.  I think this would be a nice base sauce for mac and cheese.  Thanks for sharing!

Scalloped potatoes without milk, way cool. I made them according to the recipe, using water mixed with "better than chicken" bouillon base for the chicken broth. This potato recipe is inexpensive and very tasty!  I read where folks add cheese, isn't that potatoes au gratin?  Want more flavor?  toss in some herbs. I served these potatoes as a side with Lemon and Herb Roasted Chicken (this site) and steamed fresh carrots.  Next time I make the potatoes, I will omit the salt if I use the bouillion stuff.  Delicious.  (Updating:  I didn't care for the leftovers the next day.  Next time I'll make only what I can eat that night).

I would actually give this 4.5. It was a great alternative to using milk, which is what I've always done in the past. I did kind of miss the creaminess of milk. Also, I would leave the salt out & just salt at the table-my personal preference. I'll definately hang on to this one!

This was easy and delicious.  I'll be making these potatoes often.  Followed ingredients exactly, but I accidentally set the oven temp. too high. I'm glad I checked on them because they were done in 45 min.  I'll try the correct temp./time next time.  I'm also going to try this in the slow cooker.

PERFECTION!! I used to hate these when I was little - but my mom always used the box kind...thought of giving them a try as an adult and came across this homemade recipe, we LOVED it - so easy and SO yummy! Even while I'm unemployed I can enjoy a yummy meal without breaking the bank!! Only thing is that the mayo didn't dissolve completely in the saucepan and so we had a few mayo lumps, but oh well, we'll remember that next time!! (because there will be a next time) Also, we added a touch of granulated garlic to the sauce, just bc we like garlic :)

I seasoned the onions with salt and pepper and sautéed them in butter four to five minutes. I did additional seasoning with chives, thyme, minced garlic, and parsley. Based on reviews, I stirred the cream sauce and potatoes together in a large bowl in order to evenly distribute the sauce.  I microwaved the potatoes first using the baked potato setting on my microwave and then cooked them for an hour at 375°.  Five minutes before the potatoes were done I sprinkled another round of the above-listed seasonings on top of the potatoes.  Perfect.

This turned out really well. Creamy and delicious. A bit bland though, next time I will add more spice. But, it's definitely going in my recipe book.

This was really so good and so easy to make in advance. I couldn't believe how good it tasted without adding any milk. I did cheat and add a handful of grated cheddar cheese in the middle and on top, but that was my preference. It would have been good without it also. This is a keeper.

DELICIOUS! I made it just as is and we loved it! I like variety though so I may try it with different ingredients to change the flavor every now and then, but I love the basic recipe as is! YUMMY!!!!!

This is really a great recipe; and the fact that it requres a few basic ingredients makes it even better. The potatoes are delicious and very creamy!  I sampled it as soon as I took it out of the oven. For my taste, it was missing a little something. So I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese.  I put the foil back on to let the cheese melt. PERFECT! This is definitely a keeper!

I used half milk and half water but next time will use all milk. Otherwise it was great and fairly healthy. I also boiled the potatoes for a minute or two before putting them in the oven. Will definately make again. Thanks!

I doubled the recipe for a family dinner and I think I added too many potatoes because the sauce kinda disappeared.  But it was still very good. I was really well done aver 2 hours so I may reduce the cooking time for my oven may be too hot. Next time I will try with less taters. I did dot some cheese on top near the end and broil, just for appearance,  it didn't need it for taste.  Yummy as is.

This recipe is P.E.R.F.E.C.T. exactly the way it is.    I had a dinner party for 6, and since we are a potato eating bunch, I doubled the recipe and both pans were cleaned out!   This dish got rave reviews and requests from all for the recipe.   My old recipe was good, but didn't turn out consistently good.  And, it was full of artery clogging milk and cheese.  Good-bye old recipe!  FYI:  I agree with the reviewer that said the roux in this recipe would be good for pasta/noodles too.  Add some parmesan cheese and milk/broth mixture (instead of just chick broth) and it is very similar to my recipe for "alfredo" sauce.

Well, too bad about these.  For starters, they were WAY overdone after 1.5 hours in the oven - like mush.  My oven is calibrated perfectly, so it wasn't that.  The only thing I can think of is maybe my potatoes weren't as large as the owner of this recipe - hence there may have been more liquid, making them too soft.  I ended up broiling them to get a tiny crust on the top, but it was too late.  They were just soggy mush without any flavor except onion.  And the poor onions were so wilted.  I think to save all the leftovers I'll mash them and serve them that way.  It might be a hit!

My second time making scalloped potatoes, and this time I cooked enough. The taste is great, simple and will definitely make again. Thanks. I did cook at 350 degrees because of my roast, so was probably little less then 2hrs and while I was cutting my meat uncovered them for the few minutes while still in oven.

I was told to never make scalloped potatoes again because mine were so bad. So about a year latter I had a craving for them and I found this recipe, my family loved it so much i had to make it twice in one week. The only thing I did differently was added beef stock instead of chicken because that's all i had on hand and they were fantastic. FIVE STARS

These potatoes are really great. They're a little mushier than the traditional ones, though. I sprinkled some cheese on top, and they could use more onion, but I'll definitely make them again.

Simply Delicious!  This was first attempt at home made scalloped potatoes.  It was so simple and very good.  The only minor change I made was to saute the onions in a little butter.  This is a definitely a keeper!

Excellent!!! I made it tonight without changing a thing and it was tasty. My husband and 14 month old loved it too. All I did was ensure that all the potatoes were immersed with the sauce...you could not even taste the onions. Will definitely be a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing.

Good and easy. Because the potatoes are sliced thinly, you really don't need to peel them. One less step in an already easy side dish.

By far the best Scalloped Potatoes I have ever made.  I precooked the potatoes in the microwave then sliced to cut down on bake time in the oven.  Added a few thinly sliced rings of red onion and a few good sprinkles of freshly ground black pepper between the layers before pouring on the sauce.  A great big yummy was heard from all at the table!!!

I've made scalloped potoatoes for many years and thought that they were always quite good.  For once I tried a recipe.  This one was a big hit and very easy.  Only thing I changed was the cooking time.  They were done in about 1 hour and 15 min.  If I had left them in for the full two hours they would have been mush.  Less time made them just right.  My husband has declared that he doesn't eat potatoes.  When he saw this dish he tried some and came back for seconds.  This one is a keeper in my books.  Thanks.

Made this dish to go along with our Easter ham... there was none left afterwards! Very good. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. (Nota: I use Epicure chicken bouillon which has a few seasonnings in it already...)

I only used 4 potatoes and used a vegetarian "chicken-style" broth. I used earth balance margarine and vegenaise which made these potatoes vegan. They tasted great and were very rich and creamy. I think they could be even better with some kind of meat and/or additional vegetables.

Perfect!  (I did add cheese to the sauce off heat, just 'cuz it was a holiday, and who doesn't love cheese?!)  But otherwise, I wouldn't do this any other way!!

Very good.  We used extra pepper, but we like lots of pepper.  I never knew scalloped potatoes were so easy.

I made this recipe two nights ago. However I did use milk instead of the broth(didnt have any on hand). And I did have to uncover and bake an additional 15 to 20 minutes because it was kindy "soupy" and the potatoes needed to be browned on top. Will make again with the slight changes I had to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe

Easy simple and delicious! This is an awesome recipe, I had no idea it would turn out to be one of "my" listed comfort foods.  I changed the recipe slightly by adding 1/2 cream of mushroom soup, along with 1/4 cup cooking sherry. I also sprinkled about a handful of Italian blend cheese over it halfway through baking.

This recipe is fantastic! I did change it just a bit because I had some fresh whole leaf spinach and some celery that I wanted to use up. So I added diced celery and the spinach to the onion and potato layers. I also added grated marble cheese on the top.It was soooo good. I'm sure this recipe is wonderful just as written and will try that next time.

I love scalloped potatoes but am allergic to wheat and eggs. I made the recipe using a wheat-free gluten-free flour by Bob's Red Mill and an egg-free mayonnaise by Nasoya. The sauce tasted a little too mayonnaise-y before I poured it into the pan with the potatoes but after baking it was all delicious! I will definitely make this one again.

I added 8 oz. of FAGE non fat greek yoghurt to 1.25 cups of chicken broth(made from Better than Bouillion stock, which is great!, sauteed the onions 7-8 minutes in olive oil first, and left out the mayo and used 1/2 the butter. It only needed 1.25h at 400 degrees on convection. Great and easy.

I made this recipe, however, I used the ham juice I was also having, instead of the chicken base.  My family raved over the recipe.

NEEDS MORE FLAVOR - it is a very easy dish to make and it cuts way down on the fat intake, but read other reviews to see what they did to boost the flavor (I made it follow the directions exactly).

These potatoes are fantastic but I kind of improvised and changed the recipe a bit to fit what I had in the pantry.  Instead of chicken broth, I used french onion soup and I had to add a lot more than the recipe called for.  It turned out fabulously, but it only needed about 1 and 1/2 hours.

I thought this recipe was very good. It tastes very similar to the one that calls for a can of vream of chicken soup a can of cream of celery soup and half a cup of mayonaise.We liked it . but it lacked the WOW I was hoping for.

Only had small organic potatoes on hand, so I used 9 of them instead of 5.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It had a great texture and was super-easy, but I wanted a more robust flavor.  Next time I'll kick up the spices a notch.

I'm giving this a five star for how easy it was to prepare and that company and a picky son thought it was great. I liked the fact that there was no soup or cream but found that it needed something else for flavour. Made the recipe as stated but will tweak it for my own taste. Thanks for a very easy recipe.

This recipe was so good and so easy.  I had raw broccoli I needed to get out of the fridge, so I tossed it in. I also added grated cheddar the last 1/2 hr.  This recipe didn't need adjusting, I just love cheese and broccoli.  It's a keeper!

Wow, did my family ever love this dish! I received a Cuisinart mandoline slicer for Christmas, so I ended up using it to slice both the potatoes and the onions. I'm not sure the taste was any different, but the perfectly layered presentation was gorgeous. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing.

Delicious! I made this recipe on Christmas morning, and put it in the oven and forgot about it (we had a very busy day).  Everyone thought that the flavor was incredible, and it was the perfect companion to my Christmas ham.  Very easy and very good!

This recipe is so much easier than the complicated one I was using from American's Test Kitchen.  I combined them both using the easiness of this recipe with the flavor of the other.  I sautéed the onion and one clove of garlic.  With the broth and mayo I added one bay leaf and a sprig of thyme.  After the sauce was thick and bubbly I poured it over a bag of "Simply Potatoes" Homestyle Slices from the supermarket in a 2 qt casserole dish. The sauce was creamy and the potatoes were cooked just right.  BTW it's a pleasure to find a recipe for scalloped potatoes that does not include cream of anything soup, heavy cream and gobs of cheese.

I always loved scalloped potatoes, but my husband never cared for them.  I decided to try them.  I followed the recipe to a T ... however, I used italian seasoned chicken broth because that's what I had on hand.  Excellent.  My husband and son raved.  Will definitely make it again.  Best part... it's SO EASY!  Although you need a little extra time since it bakes for two hours.... FIVE STARS... Thank you!

Great recipe! My boyfriend and I are lactose sensitive but we wanted scalloped potatoes to finish off some holiday ham.  This recipe fit the bill and it was perfect!  Update: Have made these again this last Easter and my boyfriend's daughter-in-law who says she hates scalloped potatoes, tried these and absolutely loved them!  Guess they will be a staple from now on when mashed won't do.

Very nice flavour.  Found you don't need to cook for the suggested 2 hours.  1 hour is plenty, but you should check them for tenderness. Made a small change by adding some freshly grated nutmeg to the sauce for a slightly more french taste.

I am sorry, but this was just awful.  While it was in the oven, the smell of the broth/mayo mixture was making me feel very uncomfortable.  I ended up having to remove it from the oven after an hour, transferring only the potatoes to a different dish.. and adding milk and parmesan to it, and putting back in oven.  I was very excited to try this, and I think the concept was great, but unfortunately, I did not like the flavors.. in replacement of typical scalloped potatoes side dish.

Delish!  Everyone loved these and all were surprised that there wasn't any cream or cream soups used in the recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T, and was extremely pleased with the outcome.

So good! I left the skin on the potatoes for the health benefit and I doubled and cooked the onion in a little butter until soft. Very very good.

It was strange to make scalloped potatoes without milk but this tasted very good. I added garlic and topped it with cheddar cheese and bacon bits.

This is the best scalloped potatoes ever! It's now one of our favorites. The 2nd time I made it I added a pinch of garlic powder and just a sprinkle of cheese on top. It's so good! I never heard of using mayo & broth instead of milk or cream, but it's so much better! LOVE IT!

Yummy - great taste!  I do agree with some of the other reviewers - needs more sauce.  Also the recipe calls for 5 large potatoes and I think they might mean medium potatoes.  I have made this twice so far and 2 and half large potatoes is plenty for 4 people.

The addition of mayo gives it a neat flavor.  I loved the versitility - left out the onions (hubby dislikes), added ham and microwaved for about 20 min. until potatoes were tender. As good as it was, I am betting baking it makes it even better.

Loved it. It was easy to make..though cook time took long but well worth it. kinda reminded me a little of potatoe salad, considering it had mayo in it..which I though was weird at first..lol but it was great. we ate it as a side dish the first time and as a main course the second time...and yes this one is a keeper.

These turned out really good. The only changes I made was using vegetable broth instead of chicken (we're vegetarian) and vegenaise instead of mayonaise (personal preference). They were pretty oniony but my kids even enjoyed them. I think these will become a staple in our house! Great comfort food.

Very good. Easy. My husband could not get enough of these potatoes.  I made no changes at all except I baked them at 400 for an hour and turned the oven down to 350 for another 20 minutes.  I should have checked at an hour -- I think they were probably done.

This recipe was great! I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand, though-I upped the onions by about half and swapped out the mayo for sour cream (a bit healthier and gave it roughly the same consistency).  Also cooked it covered at 375 for about an hour, then added mozzarella cheese and cooked, uncovered for another 10 minutes.  Turned out absolutely delicious-I might have taken the top off a little earlier to give it a chance to thicken the sauce a bit more, though.

Made them again tonight but scaled it to 4 servings, added sliced carrots and celery to the mix and a few slices of processed cheese.  Did everything else as the recipe called for.  Cooking at 360 (toaster oven) for 1 hour.  We'll see how that works and put it in for longer without the foil if necessary.  I really wanted to use the fresh vegetables I had on hand instead of discarding them at the end of the week.

Great recipe! It does take a while to bake, but isn't hard to make. I did add some grated mozzarella to the sauce, just for fun.  It would have been good without it, too.

I have made this many times. It's a family favorite and has introduced me to the versatility and functionality of the potatoe. Only change: omit the salt and add 2 cloves minced garlic to the sauce. Love this!!!!!

This was fairly easy to make and was tender, but I prefer the creamy taste of traditional scalloped potatoes to these slightly chicken-flavored ones.  Increased the oven to 400 and cooked for 1.5 hours and they were very tender.  Hubby and kids liked them.

Intially, I was put off when I saw mayonnaise in the recipe instead of milk, but these were very good.  My husband thought they were "great."  Thank you for an easy recipe that can be made ahead.

really good and soooo easy to make I didn't change a thing, except the cooking time. I baked at 400 and cut it down to only needing to bake for an hour in a half. I didn't have enough time to cook it for 2 hrs so that is why i changed the time.  They came out so delicious and tender.  I served this as a side to slow cooked citrus turky( also on this site) and they complemented each other very well. Thanks for the fab recipe

Wow.  This recipes is awesome!  I would have never thought of Mayo but it is a nice touch.  I didn't have the broth so I used water.  Plus I chopped up ham into bite size pieces and put on top of the potatoes.  Thus I omitted the salt. Definately a keeper!!!

Made this for Easter dinner last night, and everyone raved!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!  Thanks for the healthy recipe that is also dairy-free (my daughter is allergic to dairy.)  We served it with a little crumbled bacon on top for some added color and texture.

I found the exact recipe to be slightly bland. Take note that a quality chicken broth is crucial. I'd even suggest reducing it some for more flavor.  Next time I'll add a clove of garlic, a little more salt, and cheese to the sauce. I also served it with sour cream.

I made this dish fully expecting my very picky husband to turn his nose up at them as he does most things. Much to my surprise he *loved* them! They were really good. The best scalloped potatoes I've ever had. I didn't have 2 hours to bake them so I just made sure to slice the potatoes very thin and I increased the oven temp. I've made them twice now and they didn't take long at all. The potatoes were tender in about 30 minutes at 425 but I let them continue to cook just a little longer until the paprika top was nice and golden. SO GOOD!!!

Plain, simple, beautiful. Used whole wheat flour (that's what I had) and microwaved all the liquid ingredients together (just a little tricky with the flour clumping). Also added fresh chives for extra color and flavor. Wonderful non-dairy ('parve') side dish, reheated beautifully.

OMG - This is the "special scalloped potatoes" recipe I've been looking for since my step mother left 15 years ago, all it needed was salt. I cheated and microwaved it to cut the cooking time, but it still turned out wonderfully. Used homemade mayo too, so even better.

I really loved this recipe.  For years I have used my mom's traditional recipe with whole milk but the idea of using broth I really liked.  Since I am a vegetarian I used vegetable bouillion and the taste was great.  I also used the suggestion to add some fresh garlic...oh, and the leftovers were even better!! Thanks!

This is absolutely one of the best scalloped potatoe recipes I've made.  I used red potatoes, and the only chicken broth I had was already seasoned with garlic.  I used it, and it turned out Yummie.  I did put some crumbled cheese on top to melt/brown..the last 40 minutes.  This is a keeper !

Very simple and delicious! I just moved to the Middle East, and the stores don't have ingredients that other scalloped potato recipes require, like condensed soup and packet seasonings. This was very easy to prepare, and I was able to double it but still cook it in a pan the same size. Everyone loved it.

2hrs is a ridiculously long time to bake and my potatoes were mush - completely overcooked.  Also, needed more salt.
