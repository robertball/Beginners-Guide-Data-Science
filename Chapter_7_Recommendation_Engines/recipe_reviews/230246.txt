First, this recipe has a major omission...there's no liquid among the ingredients.  You could almost eat this with a fork without the liquid.  Add 1 can of water (or milk if you want it creamy), and you'll have a quick soup worthy of a five star rating.  And a sprinkle of grated parmesan on the top would be a good addition when serving.  I typically would have rated this lower than four stars because of the ingredient omission, but because this is the first review, I don't want to discourage anybody from trying this.  The final result is something that tastes homemade, not something out of a can.  It's good!   ***** 8.9.16***** I'd almost forgotten about this recipe.  Needed something really simple for a cup of soup, and once again, this didn't disappoint.  (with the addition of the water as mentioned in original review).

Like others I modified this a bit, but it was great!  Changes I made were minor, left out the rosemary (not something our family enjoys), and I added a can of diced Italain style tomatoes that I blended with an immerison blender before adding.  I also added one can of no fat 1/2 and 1/2.  Everything else was the same and this is a great soup.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and added one can of water and one can of half and half.  I also added some gnocchi and a smattering of red pepper flakes.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  This was really fast and really good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to fix something other than just plain tomato soup from a can. So I gave this recipe a try and the family loved it! Note: Just be sure to add 1 can of water to the recipe.

Great recipe, but I usually just add basil pesto, instead of the basil and rosemary. I usually have ajar on hand so this makes it a "pantry" quick soup when I don't feel like driving to the store in the months the herb garden is not producing. I also add a few dashes of Tabasco, but both my husband and I add that to just about everything :) 
A very easy recipe and soup for someone not experienced at "homemade" soups.

Have done this for MANY years. I do omit the rosemary. I use whole or 2% milk, and NO oil.  I use either salt-free butter or Can't believe it's not butter.  Only use about a tsp.  Always approx tsp/tbls of sugar to cut acidity.  Pairs great with grill cheese.

Served with grilled cheese and salad! Made as directed. Thick...but that is how I like my soups best! Would also well as a recipe for spaghetti sauce if you're in a pinch! Will make again! So tasty!

So, for thanksgiving I doubled the recipe in hopes for it to be a little smoother, and added water, but I couldn't see any major change. However, the FLAVOR was FANTASTIC! The rosemary was strong, but didn't overpower the tomato taste. Everybody loved it.

I too add a can of water. But do try this soup. Quick and easy and very tasty. It is my go-to when I want a quick soup to go with a salad.

I'm really not a huge fan of canned tomato soup but I was craving some to go with grilled cheese sandwiches and thought I'd give this a try. It really was pretty good! I added a little tomato paste to the onions and garlic while they were sauteing also added a can of Italian style tomatoes then gave it a few zaps with the immersion blender. Put the finely chopped rosemary and basil in and some Italian spices. Next time I get a craving for tomato soup I'll definitely make again! :)) Thanks! P. S. I also added some water and some half and half to thin it out a bit.

I was not a tomato soup fan, but this recipe has changed my mind. The extra flavor from the basil and Parmesan really helps. I had most of a can of tomato paste left from another recipe, and mixed that with 1 1/4 cups of milk rather than use canned tomato soup.
