This recipe is great, but I would add some orange juice to the salsa. I would definitely make this again.

This mango salsa was divine.  Truly a great summer recipe.  A good mango salsa recipe is rare, and this one tops the list.  This was gone in no time from the center of our table!

The salsa was rather tasty, but I wasn't too crazy about the lack of seasoning on the chicken.  While the salsa is incredible and gives flavour, I like to layer my flavours so they compliment each other.  I think I'll play around w/ the seasoning for the chicken.  The salsa is incredible tho!

This was quite good! I diced the chicken before salting (I omitted pepper) and cooking so that I wouldn't have to cool it before cutting. I think the chicken was flavored through better for this. I used 2 chicken breast halves but did not increase salt or coriander. I used cayenne instead of a red chili (didn't have one). I added a tomato and a pinch of salt to salsa. Serve over coconut rice, as another reviewer suggested, which was good, but I think next time I'll try serving in corn tortillas with lettuce, tomato and avocado. Thank you for the neat recipe!

This was fantastic.  I didn't chop the mango and orange and onion finely enough I think but I as for the tast this was GREAT!  I'm new to this recipe-using, I think I might have a gluten-sensitivity so I'm just trying it out for a few days to see if that helps or not so this was a great start to this diet.  Thanks for posting!

Very refreshing taste for a healthy summer meal! I was short on time so I used the store made salsa and prepped the chicken as directed and it was still delicious. Looking forward to making the salsa fresh!

This was amazing! My family loved it. I will make this again.  I made it as described but I might add additional red pepper to the salsa to kick up the heat a little more next time.

This was amazing! The flavors of the mango and peppers was so good. I substituted a jalape√±o for the red child and put a little cheese on my chicken and warmed the salsa a little before serving. Absolutely the best thing I've made in a long time!!!

We sliced up the chicken and layered it on top of spinach...  And even though it was an entire chicken breast, husband said it was a "nice, light dinner."  We didn't have coriander, so we substituted cumin (1:1 ratio), and the salsa needed additional salt + lime juice.  But honestly a fabulous recipe that will be added to the regular rotation for SURE. LOVE.

Nice recipe but too much onion for my liking. It benefited me to let the salsa marinate in the fridge for a few hours to meld the flavors and produce a juicer salsa. Overall, good recipe.

Oh my goodness! This was heavenly! I took some liberties with the recipe...based on some reviews and my own tastes, but what a divine combination. I used a white fish as the author suggested. I didn't have an orange, but substituted a yellow pepper. Then I jazzed up the spices with garlic powder, ginger, and a dash of cayenne. To the salsa I added lime juice and soy sauce. I also served everything over coconut rice cooked with tumeric. This was beautiful and so delicious. Going to make it again soon!

I decided to grill the chicken instead and I also used a Serrano pepper to give it a little kick. Very good dish! Will make again :)

I'm not sure how close I sticked to the recipe, but it was a great starter!  I didn't measure the pepper, salt, or ground coriander.  It just put it on evenly, until the juices soaked it up.  I grilled it as well, instead of frying it, and used different mango salsa recipe, because I was already making salsa and had my ingredients from this: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mango-salsa/detail.aspx
