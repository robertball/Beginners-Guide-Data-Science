I have made these for years. My husband loved them. I made in a crockpot and set going all day on low. He even liked warmed up the next day. Great for parties.

Nothing really new here, this is a recipe buried in many people's recipe boxes long before the internet even existed.  Good, as always.----UPDATE 4.24.14---Used this recipe’s standard sauce ingredients, but I substituted Johnsonville® Italian Hot Sausage links for the wieners.  I did brown the slices on both sides in a non-stick skillet and then they went into the sauce.  The first bite gives you a sweet saucy taste, then the spiciness kicks in with the sausage.  Maybe an unlikely combination of ingredients, but these flavors partner well, and they all disappeared VERY quickly.  Just another, totally different option.

Yeah, I modified it (forgot brown sugar)- but no worries... Had a large super bowl crowd so I went to the wholesale club (BJ's).

1- 40oz bottle of organic ketchup
1- 40oz bottle of sweet baby rays bbq sauce
1/2 bottle of jim beam bourbon
onion powder (enough to cover the mix of the above, or to taste)
1- large pack of cocktail weiners ( like 2 or 3 lbs)
3/4 bag of meatballs

Mix the sauces, bourbon, and onion powder right in your crockpot and then add the meats

Threw it in the crockpot for like 8 hours and it was perfect.

You could cut down on the sauces and bourbon, but people loved it so much they were putting it on everything- and really, why measure when this is so easy

We have made these for years using Bratwurst, Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but no booze. We are having a church supper next Saturday and we are signed up for an appetizer. I wonder what they will say when they taste these?

A huge hit! Whenever I bring them anywhere I make a ton and they always are the first thing to go.
Instead of cutting up hot dogs we just use cocktail weinies to save time, and because they taste amazing! We also leave it on the stove a bit longer than the recipe said to, but it just helps the sauce thicken a bit, so it coats the dogs more.

I made this recipe last night with a few improvisations, and my husband and teenaged-children loved it. I used the following ingredients to make the sauce: Rufus Teague's "Bit o' Heat" barbecue sauce, brown sugar, and vodka. Yes, I used vodka instead of bourbon, and it worked well. Your mileage may vary, of course; and don't ask me to tell you the proportions that I used -- I just winged it. :)

I used little wieners which were great, but I felt there was too much bourbon for the recipe.  Next time I'll half the bourbon and I think it will be perfect!!

I actually  put this sauce on a ham in the slow cooker and used it for pulled pork sandwiches.  It was so good.  Next time, I will add some chipotle chili powder for a little heat and I suspect it will be even better.
This is MUCH better on pork than on beef.

I used little smokies instead of hotdogs.  Everyone complemented them well!
