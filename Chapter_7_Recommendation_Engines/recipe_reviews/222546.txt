We call this a Salty Dog. Put salt around the rim of the glass. My favorite drink!

Use fresh grapefruit juice...it makes all of the difference.  I used lime twisted gin as that is what I had.  No matter--it was fabulous!!!!!!!

This is the best breakfast cocktail, ever! :). I rimmed my glass with sugar and it balanced out the tartness!  Yummy!

One of the few cocktails I like (whiskey neat man). 
As shown I know it as a Salty Dog. 
Anyway it's done I like it. No sugar though. HANGOVER!

Wonderful, yet simple drink that's perfect for sitting out on a warm summer night. With only three ingredients you can't go wrong. I opted to use vodka instead of gin and lined the glass with a bit of sugar. Great balance of tart and sweet!

Freshly pressed grapefruit and a decent vodka are key to this drink turning into the "bomb!"  Cant lose!

I have heard the name and thought it sounded fancy and complicated.  It is easy to make.  It sounds like something you would drink wearing a 3 piece suit and making very big business deals.  It tastes really great and it is now one of my favorite drinks.

Didn't care for this--I used bottled grapefruit juice so maybe that's why.
