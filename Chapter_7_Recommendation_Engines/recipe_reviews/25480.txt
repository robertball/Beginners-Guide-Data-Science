These burgers were awesome!  I did not have dry mesquite seasoning on hand, so I just used BBQ sauce mixed in with my turkey and jalapeno peppers.  The bugers turned out very moist and yummy!

We added a Tablespoon of bbq sauce to the meat and then topped the burger with a slice of pepperjack cheese.  This is just about the perfect burger.  You don't need condiments for this one.  It truly stands alone.

We make turkey burgers all the time and usually the same way, so it was great finding this recipe. Everyone loved the pepper addition. I didn't have the mesquite seasonings on hand, so I used a little liquid smoke and also some garlic and onion powders. Way to cold here in N.J. for any outdoor grilling, so I cooked on top of the stove and added barbeque sauce to my pan. Thanks Jenna!

This burger is absolutely flavorful and tender.  I made as is, not adding to your recipe.  Great!  I served it on Sara Lee whole wheat buns (grilled) with sauted onions and pepperjack cheese and green leaf lettuce.  I will  make them again.

Apparently I'm the only so far who has actually followed the recipe by using mesquite flavoring. We thought the burgers were very tasty with a nice bite.

I will definitely keep this recipe at the front of my book.  I did tweak it a tad.  Like the recipe calls for I used Jalapenos But I used the ones in a jar and diced them.  I also used the mesquite dry seasoning, which I loved.  On my own I added about 1 tablespoon of chopped up onions, a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, and about 1/4 cup of flour.  Very very tasty!

When my hubby came home from work and I told him I was making turkey burgers I could tell he was skeptical. These turned out great, very juicy and flavorful...I did add an egg to the mix with 2 lbs. turkey. They were a hit with the family, thanks jenllong!

Great change of pace from beef! I added crumbled bacon and shredded cheddar to the patties before grilling and served in a pita with a little bit of light cream cheese. Yum!

Really salty and too strong of a smokey taste with the whole pack of mesquite seasoning mix. Maybe would have been better with 1/2 package.

This recipe is SO good and so easy!  My husband asks for these at least every 2 weeks.  I follow the recipe exactly, but add a tablespoon or so of BBQ sauce to hold the burgers together.  They really don't require any condiments, but I like to top mine with sour cream.  We eat these with sweet potato fries quite often.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Best turkey burger I think I've ever had. Still prefer regular hamburger. Served mine with Pepper Jack cheese and Thousand Island dressing for a sauce. I plan on trying this recipe with ground beef.

The only reason I gave this a 3 was because I took Travis's recipe and instead added taco seasoning. I really, really loved it! Definitely worth a shot!!

These were okay, not as good as I expected with all the rave reviews.  I think jalapenos from a jar would work better since these were still crunchy, even though I diced them so small, and I guess I just don't like mesquite.  I used the McCormick seasoning pack and it tasted very salty and processed.  Very flavorful, just not the flavor I like.  Not my thing.  Won't make again.

Good and easy.  I've made this recipe both with fresh jalapenos and with canned jalapenos when I don't have fresh on hand.  Both work fine.  I like to add a little chipotle-flavored Tobasco sauce into the mix and melt pepperjack cheese over the top during the last couple of minutes on the grill.

I tried it, but knowing that the mesquite seasoning mix, that I use, is good for 2 pounds of meat, as a marinade. So, you may want to cut back, as the flavor is strong, if not used as a marinade. Flavor was good, but not too strong. A food safety reminder, though. Ground turkey needs to be cooked to 165 F, as it is poultry. To cook to desired doneness, is dangerous. "Well done" for ground chicken and turkey!

I gave this a 4 because this is the FIRST turkey burger I ever had. QUITE NICE. I'm a 55 year old Polish dude now living in Fl. I was told by the wife to pick up a few packs of ground turkey from my local Publix. I forgot to get ground chuck so I looked here. THANKS, I can't wait till tomorrow to try spicing them up with some pesto & crushed pepper. SWEET!

Juicy & flavorful! I used 3/4 of a package of mesquite on a 20 oz package of turkey store ground turkey. Next time, I'll use a whole package. Grilled indoors on a grill pan and topped with american cheese on whole wheat buns. These are fantastic! Going into the dinner rotation!

If you use this recipe, please don't use the mesquite.
