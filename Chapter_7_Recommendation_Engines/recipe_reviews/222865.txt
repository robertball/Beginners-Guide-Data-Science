I almost bypassed this one simply due to the high calorie and fat content, but I am really glad I tried it.  I used what I had on hand and followed the recipe, but used a few lighter ingredients (2% milk, half the butter, etc).  I sauteed and browned the chicken, and took a tip from another reviewer and added chopped portobella mushrooms, because I had one that needed to be used up.  The original poster omitted the garlic due to an allergy, so I sauteed a couple of chopped cloves of garlic with the mushrooms.  I had fresh Italian herbs in the garden, so I added those (finely chopped) toward the end, and served it with some freshly ground pepper . I felt it needed more than just salt as a seasoning.  It probably didn't get quite as thick it would using the heavy whipping cream, but my family was happy to sop it it up with bread (next time I'll use a little cornstarch as a thickener).  Even lightened up, this one is a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious! I used light cream instead of heavy cream, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. This recipe is a keeper

I used half & half (didn't have whipping crm) one clove of garlic minced, garlic powder, a little onion powder and grated parm cheese (the powdery kind as it's all I had). My husband & I both liked it! Next time we will also add mushrooms and may get grated parm cheese. Husband isn't a kale fan, but said it gave great flavor to the meal. Also, we served it with brown rice. YUM thanks!

This was DELICIOUS! I used baby kale so I didn't have to mess with de-stemming (and I had it); 2% milk and some cornstarch (didn't have heavy whipping cream); a blend of Parmesan, asiago, and Romano cheeses (what I had - sensing a theme? LOL!); minced garlic;  more salt and pepper; served over/mixed with rigatoni; and garnished with a bit of basil and shaved Parmesan (not necessary, but I love garnishes).  If you don't have or like kale, spinach would be a perfectly wonderful substitute.  I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again and again!  Thank you!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone in the family LOVED it!  I did go the lower fat route by using 2% milk and corn starch, and added 2 cloves of garlic, plus a little salt.  It was very, very good.  I couldn't help think that maybe a little white wine would go good in it too?  Will definitely make this one again!

I found a new favorite!!!  I used the advice of others who reviewed it, I did skip the red wine vinegar though, but I did add greek olives and lots of garlic, it was fantastic!!  Served it over spaghetti.  Next time I will add artichokes as well.  I will use this recipe over and over again!

Loved this. I used non fat greek yogurt instead of the cream and just a sprinkle of fresh parm. The way the red wine vinegar cut the bitterness of the kale was perfect.. will remember this trick for any kale cooking

This was fantastic! I used some advice of others and added my own twist. I used 1% milk and cornstarch instead of cream, olive oil instead of butter and I added garlic and of course BACON! What I ended up with was a light cream sauce with tons of flavor! The whole family loved it and I will be making it again for sure.

I needed a quick dinner to use kale and cooked chicken I had on hand. I followed the other parts of the recipe as written, and since my chicken was cooked, did not have to do the step of removing the kale from the single pan. We ate it over brown rice and loved it! I'm making it again for the second time in as many weeks.

Loved it! I was inspired to wilt the kale in 1 T red wine vinegar. Cooked the chicken in olive oil with s & p and 1 t dried basil. Saved the juices from strained chicken and cooked 1 whole shallot, 2 T  garlic and set aside with cooked chicken. Melted 4 T butter and whisked a few T of flour. Cooked 1 minute and added 2 cups low sodium chicken broth and brought to simmer. Added 1 cup heavy cream and 1 t basil,  simmered till creamy and added chicken and shallots and 1 can drained mushrooms, heated through, then added kale,and voila! Serve over cooked noodles or rice. Quick and easy and delish says the hubby!

The amount of cream, cheese and butter really detract from the health benefits of kale and chicken breast. The taste is pretty good, although the cheese made it chewy. I won't make it again.

Really good and a GREAT recipe for using excess kale from the market.  Like several others, I added garlic, a little extra sea salt and thickened 2% with cornstarch instead of cream.  Lots of flavor!

Can't go wrong with this recipe, apparently. I changed this a LOT and it was amazingly good. I microwaved a smaller amount of kale in a splash of vinegar and splash of water. I dredged halved chicken breasts in my favorite Louisiana breading mix, then browned the chicken in the olive oil. Then added a little butter, browned the garlic. Tossed in the kale and some brocoflower. I put some milk in the bowl with the leftover breading, added maybe 2 oz parmesan and italian herbs and pepper, and then tossed the whole thing in the skillet. It thickened up and was wonderful.

Fantastic! Subbed red for white wine vinegar & heavy cream for half & half, just because I didn't feel like going to the store. The whole family loved it, including my usual kale complaining son!

We ate this over angel hair pasta.  My husband, oldest son and I thought it was great.  My pickier 8 & 5 yr old children weren't big fans but did pick the chicken out of the sauce and managed 1 or 2 bites of the kale!

Delicious.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream, made the sauce a little thin, but still very good.  I added diced tomatoes and that really added another dimension to the flavor.  Very good.

LOW CARB!  SKIP THE  PASTA.   VERY TASTY!  Calories you are saving on the Pasta  you can splurge with the heavy cream.   No heavy cream on hand ?  Try sour cream instead also very good!  MY TWIST:  pan fry onions and garlic first till transparent  then add the  chopped kale cook as recipe states.   I add chopped precooked  Rotisserie Chicken, Black Beans & Mushrooms(canned is fine) along with the Heavy Cream and Parm Cheese heat till all hot an gooey(5 min)!    Serve in bowl!   Excellent !  No need for any starch unless desired.  My kids love it! PACKED with Protein and Vitamins.

Easy and delicious! I agree with other reviewers that the high calorie content almost scared me off, but it was delicious and filling, and I couldn't eat a whole serving. I sautéed onions and whole garlic cloves (about 15 because I love garlic!). For me the sauce was a bit thick, so next time I'll reduce the cheese.  Boyfriend loved it and went back for more... Told me to be sure to save this recipe!

I also changed the recipe - used evaporated skim milk to save calories with the corn starch and 1/2 olive oil / 1/2 butter.  Sprinkled with a little cayenne pepper - husband had two helpings (so much for counting calories  LOL).....will be making again

I had kale and mushrooms I needed to use, and this recipe was perfect to use them up! I stuck with the recipe, with the addition of the mushrooms as some reviewers recommended, and my family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I took the suggestion of using  half & half everything was amazing. I used it as a filling on tortilla shells to cut Carbs but very filling and delicious. A new favorite!

Wow this was great!  I made it exactly as written EXCEPT I added a good dose of garlic powder to the chicken, and I had no heavy cream. Instead I made a roux by adding butter to the sauteed chicken (and I used a little oil too because the pan was dry after the Kale was removed), then I sprinkled flour into the pan, alittle more butter, alittle more flower, whisking it around until it made a nice thick paste, then I added the 3/4 cup milk to make a sauce.  I continued adding milk to make it a nice creamy consistency because I had eventually added a more butter and flour to make plenty of creamy sauce.  I only added alittle bit of parmesan cheese towards the end.  I served it with some leftover white rice I had that I warmed up in the microwave.  Everyone loved it, its definitely a keeper.  See my pics!  :-)

Very good! I went the full fat route because I had some cream in the fridge. I didn't add any water, but just sauteed the kale in butter and a clove of garlic. I liked the addition of the red wine vinegar when cooking the kale; that bright touch of acidity helps cut the richness of the sauce. Definitely will make again!

This recipe would probably be best using the heavy cream and all the butter, but didn't have cream and didn't want it so high in fat, so I used 2% milk, corn starch to thicken and half the butter. It was fairly simple and fast.  My hubby and son both dislike kale, they ate and enjoyed it!  I felt that there wasn't enough sauce, so I doubled it.  Added some fresh lemon juice and lemon zest, garlic powder and oregano.  Will make again. :)  Yoga/Cycle Chick

steam plenty of kale and chop fairly small.   Added garlic and onion powder.  Everyone really enjoyed and asked for ends.

I really liked this recipe.  I had no red wine vinegar so added red wine, and took the authors advice about garlic.  It was fabulous!  
Sometimes you just want something hot and creamy and basically scrumptious.  This one was it!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it.  I made some modifications because I didn't have anything on hand.  1) I had chicken breasts already marinating in a bit of bourbon bbq sauce before I ran across this recipe, so I used those marinated chicken breasts in this recipe. I also don't have a food scale, so I used 4 chicken breasts.  2) I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used the 1% milk I had on hand with some plain yogurt.  3) I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I splashed some balsamic vinegar on the kale instead.  Other than those 3 modifications (which are actually quite substantial deviations, I admit), I followed the recipe.  

Result: SO good.  The kale was even better than the chicken, but the chicken was outstanding as well.

I really liked this dish!  I did add some garlic and mushrooms and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream.  Very nice!

I followed this recipe to a T. When I re-added the kale to the cream mixture, it curdled. Don't know where I went wrong with this recipe.

YUMM!!! I made this with 2% milk and skipped on the red wine vinegar. My boyfriend and I loved it. I suggest to add a lot of kale because its just like spinach and wilts down to almost nothing. I served it over gluten free macaroni noodles!

It's good, I blackened the chicken to give the cheese sauce some flavor, but in the end, it would be more economical to simply throw in a jar of alfredo sauce than making it.  I followed the directions to the letter and found the sauce lacking in flavor.
I cooked the chicken alone in bite size pieces.  Loved the kale but might steam it next time, not fond of the texture.  Added garlic.

Overall, a nice change.  I served it over penne pasta.

I always make the recipe first following the directions to a "T".....as written I thought it was just okay.  I wasn't crazy about the vinegar taste, personally I thought it was too pronounced. I think with some "tweaking' of the recipe it has the potential to be fantastic!
