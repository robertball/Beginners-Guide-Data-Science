This was ok.  I followed the recipe exactly.  HOwever, I found the clove flavor to be kind of strong  and I was expecting it to be sweet for some reason.

I thought this was an interesting and tasty variation on brown rice. We prefer to eat brown rice for health reasons, but I don't really care for it, so I'm always looking for ways to jazz it up. We had this rice with pork chops and will definitely be making it again.

This seemed like a great idea but it was too thick and the clove flavor was definitely too strong and the pumpkin to overpowering..this needs some other ingredient to mix up the taste.
