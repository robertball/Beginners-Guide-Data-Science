I threw in a good measure of homemade taco seasoning and used black beans instead of pinto beans. I actually threw everything into the crockpot and cooked it on low for most of the day. The little kids liked it but my husband and I didn't really care for it. It reminds me of taco dip, which is okay if you are eating taco dip but not so much if you want soup.

This turned out pretty good. I did throw in a packet of taco seasoning in my beef because I felt it needed it to give it a true taco flavor. Honestly, I thought this tasted AND looked better before adding the cheese. If I were to make this again, I'd leave out the Velveeta and just garnish with shredded cheddar. Oh and I added some sliced black olives and that was a nice touch.
