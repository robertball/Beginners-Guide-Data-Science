Made these the night before Halloween and our kiddo liked them. Instead of French bread though, I just used refrigerated pizza crust dough that I cut into rectangles just because she's not a fan of French bread and black olives because she doesn't like green ones. Anyway, cute idea!

Baked for 5 minutes and broiled on low for 2 more because we like our pizza well done. Only 3 stars because my 8 year old daughters didn't notice they were mummy's. I asked why one was taking an eye off and she said because it was gross. My husband and I got a kick out of them though but if I make these again will use pepperoni for the eyes as shown in the substitution recommendations.
