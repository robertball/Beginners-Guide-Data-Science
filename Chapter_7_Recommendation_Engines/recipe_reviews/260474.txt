The combination of flavors will wow you and your brunch guests. If you don't have pancetta or prosciutto just use bacon and thin sliced black forest ham.

I loved this.  I added chopped green onions.  I cooked the white parts with the pancetta and used the green to garnish.  it was so good I made it 3 times in one week!

I've been fixing a version of this for many years, being a former Californian I was raised eating Avocados since I was a child but I had never fixed this with Pancetta and it's something I always have in the freezer.  I fix this the day after I bake bread because it's so good on home baked bread.  I use thin sliced ham because I find the prosciutto hard to cut through when everything else is soft.  The flavor of this simple dish is outstanding.  I also fix this sometimes with a soft fried egg, saves a pan!

What  a nice change from the usual eggs and bacon. Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare. I used lightly toasted sourdough and I served it with fresh fruit. A champagne worthy breakfast/brunch.
