This was pretty good, but I expected to taste more of the spiced rum.  We did add  more rum to each drink, nobody was complaining, and the glasses were empty, so I'd say it was a success.

This recipe came in my inbox last night (Friday) and it was perfect timing to try because a couple of friends were over for a movie ;-) I didn't have root beer and spiced rum on hand but did have cherry cola, Bacardi Gold and French vanilla ice cream so gave that a try. YUM! Thank you so much for the fun, tasty idea and am now going to experiment with assorted soda and rum flavor combinations and, of course, with root beer!!
