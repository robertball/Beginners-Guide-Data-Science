Great recipe. The only thing I did different was I chose to boil the ribs for 30 minutes, and drain.  I browned the ribs in a little oil after seasoning with garlic powder, salt & pepper. I added sliced onion to the crock pot, placed the ribs in, added the sauce and cooked on high for almost 5 hours. The result was fall-off-the-bone ribs, with a delicius sauce. Hubby loved it as much as I did.

Delicious! All the kids, even the pickiest 3 year old, liked it. I decreased brown sugar to 1/2 cup, only added about 1 Tbsp of honey and used apple cider vinegar. Salted and peppered ribs, then quickly browned them on the stovetop on all sides. Cooked for 5 hours on high as directed. Ribs turned out perfect and the taste of the sauce is amazing. It had just enough sweetness though, so adding as much sugar and honey as recipe calls for would be too much. Thanks for a delicious recipe! It will become my staple.

This was good, as to be expected.  My entire family enjoyed this recipe.  Even my 10 month old son.  I think he would have kept eating  hadn't I stopped him, lol.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I decided to use this for Easter Sunday and I am glad I did.

Great recipe!  Definitely a keeper.. 
The whole idea behind the crock pot is to make it easier on oneself.  I followed the recipe exactly as it called for, and the ribs  were delicious.  There appeared no need to brown them ahead of time, or boil them or broil them either.  As someone suggested once cooled I skimmed  the fat and threw  it out.  So, if concerned about the excess fat, I would suggest making them one day ahead.  Everyone loved this.  
 I even used the remaing sauce to make baked beans right in the crock pot!  They were delicious too!!
 THANKS!

This was amazing - I followed others advice and boiled the ribs for 30 minutes then browned them slightly before dumping in the crock pot - because of this I had to add a tiny bit of broth later in the cooking, to keep it moist. As per other readers, I also cut the sugar in half, did not add salt (soya sauce is salty enough). The sauce was so flavourful. I served it with mashed potatoes and a big green salad. This will be a regular for me.

I loved this recipe! The only substitutions I made were using Dijon mustard instead of ground mustard, and I also added onions. Thanks for sharing this recipe...it was a hit!

What a fabulous sauce! I used organic apple cider vinegar in place of white. And I'm sooo glad I did! The flavor was perfect! Also dijon mustard instead of ground because that's all I had on hand. The pork ribs just fell apart & were so tender & flavorful. My Aunt was in town & she was just amazed by how good they were. Only thing I would do differently was either boil ribs first or use a ladle to get grease off of sauce. Another way would be to put sauce in fridge until grease turns thick & scrape it out. We poured the sauce over the top but it was a bit greasy from the ribs. There was enough sauce to save for another dish. Perhaps on the bbqer? Served with baked beans & baked potato. Very good recipe! Thanks will use again. Maybe with chicken next time.

Great recipe base that really lends itself to adjustments for whatever flavor profile you're looking for.

However, before dropping these ribs in the slow cooker, you should really stick them under the broiler for 10-15 minutes to brown them and render away some of that fat. Otherwise, the fat is going to end up dripping into the sauce, and your ribs are going to be floating around in a loose, oily base (see the one picture someone uploaded) instead of being the sticky, thick beauts they should be. I skipped this step the first time around, and had to reduce/skim the liquid in a pan afterward, then baste the ribs with the fixed sauce. Still ended up working, but an unnecessary headache that could probably be avoided by browning them first. At least I'm assuming; I haven't tried browning them first yet. You may still want to drain and reduce the sauce afterward if you're not getting that sticky texture.

Great sauce! I used balsamic vinegar instead of white, Dijon in place of dry, and fresh garlic. I did find the sauce a little sweet so I added some Worchester, and extra vinegar and mustard. Will do this again.

I am keeping this recipe.  My family loved it.  I boiled the ribs for about 20 minutes and did not brown them, and used a little less sugar.  The meat was falling off the bone before 5 hrs.  I will be making this again.

Cooked ribs in oven for 45 mins at 350 degrees (because it was too large to boil in a pot). This eliminated some of the fat. My changes: only 1/2 cup brown sugar,  2 Tbsp honey; added 1 diced onion, onion powder; no salt. The "sauce" was too runny, and not so flavorful, but still very sweet.

First time using slow cooker for ribs. It was a very easy recipe. Followed recipe without changes and placed in crockpot on high.
After that step there  were the two changes that I made: 
1. The meat was literally  falling off bones in 4 hours so I cooked It an hour less than stated. 
2. I discarded most of the liquid (which consisted of an abundance of fat) and placed some bbq sauce atop ribs, and served as such.  Served it for a pot luck and everyone loved it. Will make again.

These ribs are so tender and flavorful. I did boil them with a few garlic cloves for about 20 minutes. I used 1 cup of ketchup with a cup of Sweet Baby Rays honey barbecue sauce, but followed the rest of the recipe as written. I cooked them in the crockpot on high for 3 1/2 hours and on low for 1 1/2 hours. I definitely will make them again. They are falling off the bone and sooo good! Thank you!

The best spare ribs I’ve ever had, partially because of the sauce but mostly because of the “spare ribs”. I usually just make regular ribs but these were amazing.  They are really hard to find in the grocery store, but once I did, it was like finding a pot of gold.  I bought 3 packs!  Super easy recipe and everyone loves them.

Wonderful recipe. I followed other reviews and boiled them for 30 minutes then browned them . Recipe said put in slow cooker for 6 hrs on high. Sounded like to long to me so cooked for 5 hours on low. They were falling off the bone. I didn’t give it a 5 because my sauce although delicious got to thick.

Perfect! My family, especially my son LOVED the ribs. Only mods I made to the recipe was not using the full amount of sugar called for and seasoning the meet with a rub before hand.

Excellent recipe! Sprinkled bit Adobo seasoning on meat before brushing with wet mixture. Super fork tender, served with baked potato & fresh green beans from my garden. Will be making this over & over again. Delicious!

Excellent easy dish. I put Ted Reader bone dust on ribs and broiled first just to get grease out of ribs. I mixed liquids and poured over ribs in  slow cooker.I used half the sugar and honey.  I also used apple cider vinegar.

Had slow cooker on med low & it was done in 4 hours so watch yours when cooking.  I didn't care for the smell the vinegar gave off in the house so would cut back some. I had written down others suggestions about remove fat, boil 15-30 min, dry to brown & then put in slow cooker. I didn't have hardly any fat on our ribs because I cut it off prior to freezing them. I did brown thinking without the fat it shouldn't need it. Well the sauce went in on the thicker side & with the slow cooker comes out very runny.  If I'm eating wet ribs I prefer the sauce to be stuck to the ribs. I think we have many other rib recipes so will probably not use this again.  The ribs were fall off the bone though & tasted so-so.

Very good first day but even better as a left over. I would use a little less ketchup but it is really only for my own tastes.

i boiled  the ribs for about 25-30 minutes and also used molasses instead of brown sugar.  I made this for my family and  a few months later i'm still being praised for it.

This dish was so easy and delicious!  I will definitely do it again!  I halved the ingredients since I only had 21/2 lbs of spareribs.

Made with the exact ingredients. Only had 3 1/2 lbs of ribs. Did boil them for 30 minutes before putting on crockpot .They were done at 5 hours and then broiled them in over for 10 minutes. These were as good as when o make them in the oven!

Great recipe; like others, I adjusted and added fresh garlic, spicy brown mustard, a small amount of sugar, adding a 1/2 cup of a favorite off-brand barbeque sauce, and a few of the spices I like and use .  It was very tasty and the ribs fell apart.  Would definitely make again and it will taste different each time as I adjust again.

Absoluely amazing.  I boiled the spare ribs first the put it in the slow cooker.  All ingredients are stocking things and SO easy to do.  Love it when it standard ingredients all put together turn into a  fabulous meal.

Followed all directions and used all ingredients asked for.  Tastless and dry.  Even used to quality spare ribs.  Will not make again.

Super easy and soo good. I make this while I'm at work and it's done and ready to eat when I come home, which is pretty awesome for spareribs.

Easy and delicious.  This tastes just like a baked recipe I used to make for Sweet and Sour Ribs that had to marinate overnight in the fridge and were baked in the oven.  A new favourite.

I just made this today and  it was delicious. Super tender and flavorful.  I only had apple Cider vinegar so I used that instead and browned the ribs with garlic salt and pepper before adding it to the slow cooker.  Will be making again!
