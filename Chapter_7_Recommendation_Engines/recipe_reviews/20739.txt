this bread was wonderfully moist!  i totallly changed a couple things in the recipe, i used 1 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar,, i used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and i added a tsp and a half of vanilla... so the bread was browner... it was very moist and i ate half the loaf before it cooled!

This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever made.  I tried it because it looked quick - and called for 3 ripe bananas which I needed to get rid of.  I left the walnuts out and substituted vanilla chips.  I also added a teaspoon of Vanilla.

Had mixed success with this one. I used only brown sugar in the amount indicated, and that might be the problem. Wife suggested needs to be sweeter, stick with white sugar (however, note that in many reviews of this dish a Â½ brown and white sugar mix is used and suggested). Also we don't use nuts because my son can have a non-tolerant reaction to them. But he didn't even finish his first slice. Wife thinks there's too much backing powder, "I can taste it try cutting it in half". I didn't even know baking powder had a taste. I still don't. Wife did say something that hints on were to go with this. She noted that, "...muffin-like breads like this loaf can be tricky". As you make this dish, try keeping that hint in mind. For example are raisins a good addition? And any tricks you have to help keep a muffin from becoming a heavy blob, they might need to be put in play here. I've given the dish a 4 star because I do like it. But, again, it's trickier than a rooky baker might want to take on. And that's just my story, "Rooky baker takes on more than family can chew".

like other reviewers i used 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar plus added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the batter. half whole wheat & half all-purpose flour worked very well too. lastly, i couldn't help but sprinkle a little cinnamon-sugar overtop before baking this wonderful bread. i made an extra loaf as a gift for friends....they loved it! many thanks madison!

So simple to make and very moist. A great way to use up ripe bananas. This was probably the best banana bread on the site. Definitely give it a try.

Excellent! The bread was so moist and delicious. I liked the nuts but I would like to substitute them with chocolate chips next time. Good work!

Great recipe, I also substituted the 1/2 cup sugar for brown sugar, I also used pecan slivers instead of walnuts.  Topping with sugar, turned out very moist and tasted even better the next day!

This was superb! My 3 yr old loved it, my husband loved it, my 7 mo. old wants to try it, and I loved it! And boy was it easy to make, too! I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown, added vanilla & 1/2 tsp of cinnamon & omitted the nuts. I also baked for 45 min. in a 8x8 pan. Yum!

I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and subsituted whole wheat flour for all purpose flour and it tuned out great.  Still moist and tasty-oh I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  I have also made muffins with this recipe, 12 muffins bake for 25-27 minutes (with whole wheat flour).  Everyone loves them!

I doubled this recipe. I needed two basic loaves to share with my favorite neighbor down the street and the women from my Mom's Group. I did use butter but I cut the amount in half and substituted homemade organic applesauce. I also cut the sugar in half. I used organic eggs, whole wheat flour and because some of the women in my mom's group have nut allergies so I omitted them. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. This was a great basic banana bread recipe that's not all gussied up. NOTE: Because banana bread can be a little cranky and cook too fast on the outside, I covered the loaves halfway through with foil to prevent them from burning before they were through baking all the way through.

Excellent recipe! THE BEST Banana Bread I'm pretty sure I have ever had! The only change I made was instead of 1 cup sugar, I did 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. The batter was even amazing so I was excited when it was done, I ate a HUGE hunking piece! I will be making this again and again and I think I will be giving it to family and friends for Xmas

very soft, and delicious! I did do the half brown sugar and half white. Also added some cinnamon and  vanilla. I did have a hard time with the outside almost burning but the inside not being ready.. Not sure what rack to put it on in the oven. But taste was good.

This was the best banana bread I have made, and I`ve tried so many recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly as given.  It was so moist and the texture couldn`t have been any nicer!  The banana taste really came through on this recipe.  I can`t say enough about how good it was!  Thanks for the recipe.

Don't understand why...but, I made this twice and both times I was not impressed with the flavor or the texture. I thought the fist time may have been because I might have unknowingly forgot an important ingredient. But when it turned out no different the second time, I knew then that I wont be making it again. I have no clue as to what I would do to improve it. I'll just keep looking for a banana loaf recipe till I find one I like.

LOVE IT! This is the first time I'm trying to bake something that requires the butter and sugar to be mixed first. I added spekulaaskruiden (a spice mix consists of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and mace) and I omitted the walnut since I didn't have it. It was awesome. Even my mom and sister (they are bakers) loved it. 
Thanks, Dakota Kelly.

Great, I use granola mix with raisin, oats, pumpkin seeds, and either almonds or walnuts, I mix this granola myself for yogurt topping and always have some in the house.. I add a cup and it is just great.. if the mixture gets dryer than it should I add some yogurt as well, it is banana base, and healthy although I doubt is reduces the calories,.. but great for lunch bags, and road trips... ENJOY!!

My family and I loved it so much and it was gone the next day! It's moist and has the right amount of sweetness. I added 1 tsp of vanilla just like what the other reviewer suggested and it was yummy! I don't think I want to try any other banana loaf recipe. I'll make this over and over! :)

Another rave review.  This banana bread was a big hit with our Sailor who is home on leave.  We won't have to worry about whether or not to freeze leftovers.   Very flavorful.  I used half brown sugar and half Splenda, egg substitute, and white whole wheat flour.   Added the vanilla and cinnamon suggested by other reviewers.  This bread smells heavenly when it's baking.

This is probably the best banana bread I've ever made. I used whole wheat flour mainly because I have a whole bag of it I needed to do something with and 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and it came out fabulous! I will be making this from now on. ;)

I used 1/2 c. brown sugar, less butter, maybe 1/4 cup (I never measure exactly) and wheat flour. Also added some raisins. Didn't have a loaf pan, so I used a round flan pan instead, end result Banana cake look!

This is a great banana bread recipe!  I have been making it once a week since my family enjoys it and those over ripe bananas that do not get eaten are put to good use.  I have tried different variations including adding a cup of chocolate chips, making mini loafs, and I even made some mini muffins for my son for an after school snack.  Great recipe!  :)

Great basic banana bread recipe. I did half whole-wheat flour and half all-purpose. Otherwise did exactly as written. Turned out great.

easy to make.  Followed directions except substituted white wheat flour b/c I was out of white flour.  I also sprinkled some sugar on top before baking to give it a little sweet crust.  It was great and I'll be making it again.

taste great.I baked the batter in 8 mini loaves. only took 20 minutes!!  I subbed dark brown sugar for the white sugar and it came out great.  taste good even without nuts, i just didnt have any on hand.  Next time I'm going to add some blueberries.  its not super moist, but its moist enough to stand on its own but its not dry at all.  its amazing hot with butter.

My family got this recipe from an elderly neighbor we adopted as "Grandma" about 50 yrs. ago. She probably got it from her mother, who got it from her mother. It's been made for generations, because it's sooo good. The only difference is that Grandma's recipe calls for 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. If you use salted butter, omit the 1/2 tsp. of salt. I don't use nuts, but I do add at least a cup of plumped raisins. Raisins are a natural preservative, so this bread stays fresh for days without refrigeration. I bake it in an 8" x 8" Pyrex baking dish at 350 deg. for about 1 hour. If you cover it as soon as it cools, it will stay very fresh and moist. I cut it into 3/4" slices and then cut those into thirds. I tried Grandma's recipe the other day with one cup of Miller's bran and about 1/4 cup of buttermilk added to it. It didn't change the taste at all, but it made it heartier and a little chewier. My boyfriend said it was the perfect snack on a very difficult 8-hour bicycle ride. He shared a piece with a co-rider who said it was good enough to be sold in stores.  He was going to share some with other riders, but decided he like it too much to share! It tastes better each day, especially warmed for 10 seconds in the microwave, with a little butter. I've printed out several recipes from this site for banana bread that I'm going to try, but I'll be surprised if I find one that I like better than Grandma's, especially with the added Miller's bran.

Definitely one of the best banana breads I have made.  I used the other suggestions by using 1/2 brown sugar and adding vanilla.  I also added choc. chips.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is great.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla after creaming the butter and sugar. I also added an extra banana to the mix.  I baked the loaf for 50 minutes, instead of 60, and it was perfect.  My 2 year old loved it and he's not crazy about bananas so I consider it a success!

I was looking for a recipe that let the flavour of the bananas shine and this is certainly it. I made two changes due to dietary restrictions...Earth BalanceÂ® instead of butter and milk chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. I used four bananas, they were small, that had been frozen.

I made a few changes, added 3/4 c coconut and the same in chopped dates.  I omitted the walnuts as I was out.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 brown and white sugar.  Cooked in about 55 minutes in my park model oven.

best bread ever! I've been making banana bread for years, but after reading the reviews, I had to try this one. This is my new banana bread recipe! I did use Energy Egg Replacer as my husband has an egg allergy. I also added a tsp of vanilla and sprinkled cinn/sugar on top before baking. Everyone in my family loves it.

I've made this recipe at least 15 times now.  I follow it to the T, and I love how it tastes.  Make sure the bananas are very overripe though - it adds a lot to the flavor and sweetness.

Lost my wonderful Banana Loaf recipe so tried this one. I must say it is really good. I skipped the nuts as my husband likes his banana loaf as is... he asked for a second slice!  I toasted the slice and served with a slab of butter.   Thank you!

This was  a very nice loaf. Enjoyed it with a cup of tea. Only thing I didn't add was the nuts. Next time I will throw in a few raisins.

Thanks Dakota, this is a saver & will print it out for further use.

Not the all time best, but very tasty and quick and easy!  

I did half white and half brown sugar, half white flour and half 50/50 flour, and added vanilla, as suggested.

Wonderful taste and texture. I too substituted 1/2 of the white sugar with brown and added vanilla. I'm glad that I stumbled upon this. Will definately make this again.

This was a great simple banana bread.  My husband loved it!  I doubled the recipe and added two extra bananas (one per loaf) since I wanted to use them up.  Didn't add the nuts since hubby doesn't like them.  Overall great mellow banana flavor, not too sweet, and you really "know" it's banana bread -- not banana with a zillion other flavors bread.

This was pretty good banana bread. Very very moist, and once you eat one piece, you cant stop!!  I added a little bit of cinnamon and will add some vanilla next time.  I was this was a *little* bit sweeter, next time I may add more sugar, or maybe my bananas were just not sweet.  Either way, I will make this again!

My go to banana bread recipe. I like to use half and half brown and white sugar. Also I add a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon. I've tried to make this with 4 bananas to make it extra moist but it came out too gooey.

Delicious & easy to make! I used half the sugar because bananas are already so sweet! I donât think this would taste as good with a full 1 cup of sugar.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now it is awesome you can kind of create your own by adding chocolate chips as well but what I always do with sprinkle brown sugar on the top of the loaf before baking it is amazing

Brown sugar instead of white sugar. Followed the rest of the recipe. My oven runs hot so 55 minutes was a bit to long. A little dark on the bottom. Next time I will check after 45 minutes but overall it was easy to prepare and very moist and tasty. Giod recipe.

This has been my best banana loaf yet!!! This recipe is amazing, super easy and no complications. I made double the recipe and made one leaf with chocolate chips, another loaf with walnuts and the rest in cupcake size. What a hit!

I made a few changes to the original recipe: 1) added brown sugar instead of white; 2) I added a little bit more banana (the recipe calls for 3, but since I was making double and I had 7 ripped bananas I just used 7 without changing anything else! I think that's why it turned out better!); 3) used unsalted butter. 

All and all you can't go wrong with this AWESOME recipe! Good luck!

I use half white sugar, half brown sugar.   And I throw in lots of chocolate chips, walnuts, peacans and almonds.  I finish it off by sprinkling a Dusting of white sugar on top (and sometimes extra chocolate chips!) before I put it in the oven.  
Been using this recipe for years and everyone loves it!!!!

I made it using only 1/4 c of white sugar and 1/4 c of non sweetened shredded coconut. It turned out well. You could add a bit of honey if they wanted it sweeter. Next time I might add 1/2 c of shredded coconut.

To be very clear, this recipe definitely makes two pans. I used the mix in one, and the pan didnât seem to be overfilled, but 10 minutes in the batter was bubbling over the sides, and I had a big smoky mess on my hands.
The cooked bits did taste good though

I have been using this recipe for a few years and I absolutely love it, although  I do NOT use walnuts and after the first time making it I decided I would add a 4th banana and have been since. (Itâs a weekly thing at my house). I also add an extra 1/2tsp or vanilla. Sometimes chocolate chips. Itâs fantastic. Making it as I type??

Made this today and it was perfect!! 
I did go half brown sugar and half white and added a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon on top. 
It turned out so well, I have requests to make more ASAP.

Just finished making this recipe. We didn't have walnuts to add. And I didn't have any baking powder so I added a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice. I also added a teaspoon and a half of vanilla as per another reviewer on here. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly however using 4 smaller bananas instead of the recommended 3. I like my banana bread really moist and this is delicious. I have not made my own banana bread before because I've had so much bad banana bread I was nervous that I would just be wasting a bunch of ingredients. This is fantastic and I will be using this recipe again every time my bananas get a little over ripened. Thank you very much for sharing.

Easy to make comes out super moist I always double or *4 because my children love it so much. I usually put a little less sugar then is called for and no nuts for my school age children can take it to school. Also make in a bunt pan or muffin cups. My 3year old loves to help when mixing ingredients.

Baked them in a sheet that is shaped for 6 small breads then reduced cooking time. Froze each loaf then pull them out as needed. The small loaves are great for slicing and bringing in lunches. Will make this again but will probably reduce the sugar a little.

Itâs my go to recipe for Banana Loaf, I add chocolate chips for my coworkers. I agree that it easily doubles for 2 loafs. I always freeze my old bananas and let them thaw but still are cold when I add 5he in. I find ( believe) thatâs what makes my loafs so moist.

Good ingredients. I used dark chocolate chunks instead of nuts. However, I ran into a problem by adding wet ingredients to the dry, as per the recipe, I found this to be odd, as it is always the other way around. The texture looked like cookie dough as opposed to batter. I added two more bananas and a bit of water to change the texture and it seemed to work. When it was fully cooked it looked great and it had great flavour but the texture made it inedible. I have only tried this recipe once but Iâve never made a bad banana bread in my life until I tried this recipe.

I added some cinnamon to it because there was no spice to it It turned out beautifully. I tripled it to make quite a few loaves Use bananas that are a little ripe to get that true flavour ! Love this recipe !

Simple to make and tastes great. ?? I substituted with brown sugar one to one, and my bananas werenât too over ripe like everyone suggests, but it turned out great anyway. The amount of sweetness in the batter was perfect. If it were any sweeter, it would be too sweet. Will definitely make again.

Turned out great,  I used vegetable oil instead of butter I believe it was....pecans on top only, and ripe bananas make a huge difference in sweetness and banana taste.

It was pretty good. The recipe says 60 minutes, but it was ready after 30. The temp was right and everything. I also think there wasn't enough butter. I used a muffin tin since I don't have a loaf pan. If my father wasn't at home to watch the muffins, they would've burnt. It was delicious, though. Smooth, moist, and soft. I recommend it but instead if 60 minutes, try 30.

This recipe is a good one except  next time I will lower baking temp to 300-325. bottom got a little burned. I added some cinnamon. Also in the past I have subbed brown sugar , and the loaf seemed a little richer.

So just found out that my son is reactive to Sugar so I am trying this out with Truvia so I used a third a cup of Truvia instead of 1 cup of sugar and I am adding about a cup of cranberries pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds mix to sweeten it a bit and just tried it and it is really good

I made the recipe without the nuts. Turned out very tasty. My cook time was on the lower end and could have maybe been even less time. But was good, whole family ate it.

Tip for everyone.  Make sure your bananas have plenty of brown on them.  If they're perfectly yellow for eating, your banana bread won't be as flavourful.

I made muffins out of these, using Splenda instead of sugar.  Put them in for 25 minutes.  They were great!

I've also made a small modification of adding 1 TBS of molasses to give it a "brown sugar" flavour, and just a couple of dashes of black pepper.  Perfect!

I doubled it but still made one big loaf and it was absolutely gorgeous. best banana cake I have ever made. If you put the bananas in a blender instead of mashing them it makes it even lighter and fluffier. Absolutely amazing!!!

I liked this recipe, but it was a little dry.  I followed the recipe as is, except I had one extra banana than called for.  My husband said he would have liked it more if it was a little sweeter.  I had put chocolate chips in a portion of the bread, and to me it was really good, but I agree the portion without chocolate was a little dry and bland.

Very tasty only "moist" is not how i'd describe the way mine turned out. I wonder if It should have specified (3) Large bananas because mine were a bit smaller. or maybe add either oil or unsweetened applesauce to make it more moist. I still enjoyed it and would try it again or sure with adjustments.

I have made this recipe many times now and it always comes out good. I just add about half a cup of whole milk to the original recipe. Adding a spoon of vanilla definitely elevates the flavor.

I found an hour was too long and half my loaf was a bit on the dry side.  Next time I'm going to try either at a lower temp, like maybe 325Â° or shorter time maybe 50min.  I'll see how that sums up and rate/comment again!  Happy baking! ;-)

I thought this was really good!!! I substituted Splenda for the sugar; make 2 smaller loafs; and used 1 cup of walnuts instead of 1/2. Will definitely make again!

Loved this!  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, added a TSP of vanilla, and some dark chocolate chips and used whole wheat flour.  I baked at 390 degress in cupcake tins for 20 minutes and these were to die for!  Hubby approved!

this was magic. The only change I made was going half brown sugar and half white sugar. This bread rose nicely and was just fantastic. My husband took some to work and his coworkers loved it, too. I've tried a few banana bred recipes from this site now, but this is the one I'll keep!

I have made this loaf twice, doubled. It works well for a loaf or muffins. As a tip for making sure any banana loaf is moist, use over-ripe, frozen bananas which have been thawed. They look ugly and the loaf may turn out darker, but trust me, it's worth it. Also, substitute half the butter for oil (I use corn oil or canola oil...whichever I have on hand.) Here are my adjustments: 1) 1/4 cup butter plus 1/4 cup canola oil; 2) 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar (work any brown sugar lumps with a potato masher if your mixer doesn't get them); 3) 1 cup white flour & 1 cup whole wheat flour; 4) 1/2 tsp baking soda instead of 1 tsp (this will cut down on the baking powder or baking soda taste which MikPhx spoke of...well, which his wife insisted on); 5) increased salt from 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp; 6) added 1/2 cup chocolate chips in addition to the 1/2 cup walnuts (my family likes it so). Finally, the first time I tried this recipe, I made muffins (had to reduce bake time, of course). The second time, I made the loaf (two large loaves, since it was doubled)...but I think I needed to cut the bake time by 5 minutes since it burned in the bottom. (It could be my testy oven.) In all, I will be keeping this recipe since I have tried many. Thanks!

This is great! And Iâm a terrible cook so I keep an eye out for simple recipes that work and this one does. Quick, simple and it tastes great. I agree it could be sweeter and may try adding a little vanilla next time but other than that itâs pretty much a fool proof recipe. If youâre a kitchen putz like me then bookmark this recipe.

This recipe is super easy and delicious!  I really don't like most banana breads because of the walnuts, so I omitted those and added chocolate chips instead (muffins take about 15-18 minutes).

This was the most delicious banana bread I've ever had. It was moist, and with the chocolate chips I added (instead of nuts), it was dessert all by itself! Although my husband put vanilla ice cream over a piece and that was delicious as well! Will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent Banana Bread, a very easy way to use up those extra bananas! I added lots more walnuts and some pecans because I like it crunchy and it was great. Freezes well also.

Absolutely delicious, moist banana loaf that was so easy to make in my food processor.  Followed the recipe exactly but only needed about 50 minutes cooking time.  Tasted extra yummy when served sliced and spread with butter.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good! The first was gone with in the hour it was pulled out of the oven.  I made two loaves, both of which I added some pumpkin spice, just to make it a little different, but the other I added a 1/2 cup chocolate chips and lessened the white and put in 1/4 brown sugar, and sprinkled both with brown sugar which gave it a nice crusty top.

I've tried many banana loaves and none have ever been as well received as this one!  It's so simple, light and delicious!  I add a half tsp of cinnamon and substitute sugar for maple syrup (3/4 cups for each cup of sugar minus 3tblsp of liquid per cup of maple syrup used).  Perfect!!!

This bread is delicous.  Mine came out sweet and moist with a crunchy crust.  I used four bananas.  I baked mine on the gas grill with the front and back burners on low and the middle burner off.  It baked for 1 hour 45 minutes.  I covered it with foil for the last hour.  The crunch crust combined with the moist cakelike center were a wonderful texture combination.

I've made this Banana Loaf several times and everyone LOVES it. I've even taken a picture of it that shows it in it's glory, just out of the oven and to hot to cut. If I hadn't taken it then, at least a fourth of it would have disappeared!

This was soooo good.  I added vanilla extract and used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the nuts.  It's a keeper.  Thanks Madison!

I modified the recipe as others suggested...adding 1/2 tsp vanilla, substituting brown for some of the white sugar and cutting that down a little.  I also removed 2 tbsp of butter and replaced with 2 oz applesauce.  I made these as mini muffins and these were very good!

Brought this into work, and most everyone liked it. One or two people said it was a tad "nutty", so next time I might use less nuts (I used pecans instead anyway)

I did half brown, half white sugar and added a 1/4 cup of sour cream and one extra banana and used a glaze on top.  Everyone loved it!

Perfect recipe! I had too many bananas, and nearly doubled the amt called for. It was TOO much banana taste...the next day I made it again using only 1 extra banana and it was perfect!
