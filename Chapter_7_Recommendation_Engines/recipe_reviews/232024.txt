Curiousity got to me, so I made 6 eggs in a disposable foil muffin tin.  Since I read the reviews and my oven is not, I baked them @ 325 degrees for 25 minutes, then plunged them in ice water for 10 minutes, as instructed.  Turned out perfectly!  And I like my hard boiled eggs 'hard' - almost green.  The eggs peel easy and the minor discoloration in no way outweighs the convenience of this method.  Don't think I'll ever boil my eggs again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I love how eggs cook in the oven compared to boiling! I read about the red/hard spots people are getting where the eggs touch the pan. Alton Brown's YouTube video shows him doing this but with a thoroughly damp towel laid on the oven rack then resting the eggs on the town so they never touch metal. I had no red or hard spots. I posted a picture of my peeled eggs with one egg cut open to show the perfect yellows. This is my go to method from now on!

Just tried this recipe and they came out great. I put a little crumpled up foil in the bottom of the tin and rested the eggs on top making sure they didn't touch the sides and no brown spots!

Was there supposed to be water in the cups? I tried this for my Easter eggs this weekend and they turned out rubbery :( Also you could tell tell where the egg touched the pan as there was a hard red/brown spot on the egg that stuck to the shell when peeling. They tasted fine but weren't very pretty to look at

Our holiday crowd is so big and deviled eggs are absolutely "the thing" in demand, so, quantity matters and trumps the 'lil colored spot where the eggs rest in the muffin cup. Not sooo ugly and easily trimmed off with a sharp Wüsthof, then glopped over with the tasty deviled filling. Just saying, this is a deviled egg factory's dream and the flavor/texture remain a favorite with the crowd. I always sprinkle a little paprika on top anyway, so appearance is solid :o]

For the folks who have a problem with the burnt spots, the solution is to keep the eggs from touching the muffin tin.  There's probably other ways to do it, but I took a sheet of aluminum foil, put it over the top of the muffin tin, pushed it down a little into the cups so that the eggs don't roll out.  I also only cooked them at 325, but for the full 30 minutes.

They came out perfect.

I did the recipe exactly as written. One thing I noticed when I read reviews, before I did the recipe myself, some people were having a hard time peeling the eggs. When I first started peeling my own eggs, it was not going well, but as I got to the last ones, which were still in the cold water, they began to peel great. That being said, I don't think it's the cooking process that causes the peeling problem, but not leaving them in the cold water long enough. Hope this helps. I will try this recipe again.

I used brand new eggs that I bought TODAY to make these. I know you're supposed to use 5+ day old eggs but I was impatient. And let me tell you...these eggs were a breeze to peel. Only one egg had some difficulty and some of the membrane pulled off some egg but no big deal, I'm not making them for a cocktail party! I have a brand new oven so the first batch I baked for 27 minutes at 325 and they were hardboiled but the yolk had the slightest bit of moisture in them. I prefer FIRM hard boiled eggs. So I readjusted to 29 minutes at 350 and they came out perfect! Firm and the slightest bit bouncy. Since you have to transfer them to a bowl of ice cold water, just peel them under the water and it'll be easier. This is how I'll make my eggs from now on. Mess free, no huge pot of water to haul around the kitchen. :)

Big secret is to put them in silicon muffin tins. No dots from metal muffin tins or by laying them in the oven shelf. I just tried these today for the first time.  I made two different batches to test it. I used older eggs in one and newer ones in the other. A). no marks; B). EASY, just put the muffin tins away and that's it; C). The shells slipped off the egg for some of them before I could peel them! D). You can do this while doing other things.  Four  suggestions: use cupcake papers so eggs won't sit on metal or use silicon 'tins', use a gravy ladle to remove the eggs imediately from the pan to water with ice in it, and set oven to 325, not 350. I won't make 'boiled' eggs again because this is way easier and it's easy clean up.

I will never go back to boiling eggs again!  I cook a dozen eggs dry (no water)in the muffin tin at 325 for 24 minutes.  Then I pop them into ice water and they are a breeze to peel.  The tiny brown dot is not a problem....just pull it off.  Like boiling eggs in water, you cannot use really fresh eggs.  They need to be just a bit older to peel easily. To those whose eggs came out rubbery, I think you need to adjust the time down from 30 minutes.  That would definitely be too long in my oven.

I LOVE hard cooking eggs this way!  It is so easy and hard to screw up.  Clean up is a cinch.   My oven runs pretty true to temp, so 30 min was perfect for one dozen.  I think i should have shortened the cook time for my half batch.

For me, this is the only way to do hard cooked eggs. There's no watching the pot or guess work (if you forgot to set the timer). In addition to this, to make peeling a breeze, put eggs in a glass jar with a lid and add a little cold water and shake a few seconds. Take the eggs out of the jar and the shell just falls off. I always dreaded having to drag out a pot, boil the water, and then usually lose a couple of eggs due to cracking in the process. This method works great!

I have tried this recipe  many times. I love the texture, as the eggs come out creamy. if you don't  like the  brown areas caused by the muffin tin, don't dispair! Simply  put the eggs on the  oven rack instead. Brown spots appear, but do not  go all the way through to the egg itself.

Almost every egg was cracked when I took them out of the oven. Those that were not cracked did so upon immersing then in the ice bath. The eggs also had brown spots all over them. I used this method to use the eggs for coloring then for Easter baskets. This may be a good way to cook them to eat, but not if you need them pretty to decorate!

I was not impressed with this recipe. I only cooked mine for 25 minutes because I knew my oven was a litter hotter. The side the of egg that was on the bottom of the pan, all of them had a brown mark on them. I was only using them for egg salad but I would have been upset it I needed them for deviled eggs. They did not peel well, either. Going back to boiling them.

I did not care for this recipe. They had brown and yellow spots on the boiled white part of the egg inside.  Most chunks of the shell stuck to the egg and I had a hard time removing them.  I was making them for deviled eggs and the outside has to look good, so by the time you cut off the yellow and brown spots, and then gouge out where the shell pieces stuck to the egg, they were not presentable.

If you check out my photo, you can see that mine are not pretty.  Hard boiled eggs are not my forte, so I'm going to give the recipe the benefit of the doubt, particularly since our oven can be a bit contrary.  I planned to pickle mine, so i wasn't worried about presentation and decided not to bother with the tips from prior reviewers regarding preventing the spots.  My eggs did end up with a tony spot or two per egg were contact was made with the tin. I simply sliced it off.  The shells did not come off easily for me and one egg was totally ruined.  I kept it in the photo so you could gauge the "doneness" of the yolks.  While I wouldn't use this method when presentation was clutch, it'll be nice to use when making macaroni salad, or something similar, where presentation is moot.  THANKS for the recipe!

Works great, peels easy. Baking gives the yolks a little different/better taste.  I do this all the time now.

CAUTION - some of these actually EXPLODED on the way out of the oven - I ducked for cover! I baked at 325 for 30 minutes. The only thing I can think of is that my eggs are super fresh (as in from my backyard chickens). 
That being said - they were cooked perfectly - but the discolorations (brown spots from the oven) would make them unsuitable for dying for Easter eggs. 
I'll post a pic of what they looked like coming out of the oven - you can see the ones where the shell exploded.

I used a mini muffin tin instead of the full sized tin.  This exposed more of the surface area of the egg.  I did not use the paper cups.   I made these for lunch with my wife.  They were the easiest peeling eggs ever and not rubbery at all.

I like this recipe. For the brown spots, I cut the eggs in half so the brown spots were on the bottom of the egg white under the devils food filling and my family never noticed the brown spots.  I was the only one that knew they were there.  I told my family later and they were surprised to know they had any brown spots on them.

The eggs aren't rubbery, but yes you will have spots and I Also noticed that the overall color of the white isn't quite as white as when you boil. But, most recipes call for the eggs to be chopped, dyed, halved and stuffed so it makes no difference. A purist should probably stick to boiling but this is so easy I will do it this way from now on.

I just tried this method & got PERFECT EGGS! No green ring & no spots on the eggs. There was a spot on the membrane at the large end (air pocket) but not on the shell or egg itself, so peeled away with the shells. I used the toaster oven on convection @ 325* & put 6 eggs in a silicone muffin tin for 22 minutes. I'm so happy to have found this! Devilled eggs can be a part of my life again!! (I hate pouring boiling water down the drain.) Thanks, user!

I tried a dozen eggs. 325 for 30 minutes. 4 poped and cracked wide open. Multiple spots on them all and I did not really see a difference in the pealing of the shell. I will stick to boiling them for now on...

What size eggs do you have? That important detail is missing from most recipes. I trialed this recipe today with 6 large eggs  that were a few weeks old but still a week before expiry date. I preheated well to 325 F. My oven is usually true to most recipes. I placed foil over my muffin sheet  first and made slight dips in the cups so I could place the eggs in without them touching the sheet, as recommended by some reviewers. At 25 minutes I put the eggs in an ice water bath for 10 full minutes. They were very easy to peel. No red spots. The yolks were done more than medium, but just short of what most people call hard (which I find chalky). This is my favourite doneness for eating and for deviled eggs! I would adjust time for extra-large or medium eggs. You may need to adjust for your oven's performance and your preferred doneness. Great recipe! Thank you.

Ok I love the idea of this method, because no matter how hard I try, I always goof up hard boiled eggs. Either I over cook them, under cook them, or the shells crack as they’re boiling. Please don’t judge me, I’m a very good cook, I just always screw up eggs. Well apparently baking them is no different. I just baked 15 in the toaster oven for 30 minutes at 350, 2 of them burst open. Last time I made them in the same toaster oven at 325 for 30 minutes, and most of them were still a little raw-ish in the yolk. I just can’t win.

I made this recipe just as stated. These were the worse hard (baked) eggs that I have ever had. Out of 12 eggs done this way: one exploded in the oven, 5 more popped open the eggshell (without completely exploding the egg). They were no easier to peel than boiled eggs and the yolk was no less green (in fact I think it was actually greener). There was a brown streaking on most of the eggs, indicating that they were quite nearly burnt - that is if the rubbery texture didn't give it away. Let me first say that I used fresh eggs that my chickens laid themselves within about five days of the cooking. Perhaps part of the problem with VERY fresh eggs is that the air bubble is a little larger than store bought, antibiotic laden, Genetically Modified, feces-infested-crowded-inhospitable chicken(ish) eggs. Because half of the egg shells were broken once I took them out of the oven, when I dunked them in cold water they (of course) filled with water and would not keep very long.       I think that 30 minutes is too long at 350 degrees, or even 325 degrees. Perhaps 250 degrees might work well with my fresh eggs. I dunno.

Love using this method.  I had to make slight adjustments with the temp and time cooked to work with my oven, but it was worth it.  

I do not care for the small brown spot on the egg, so I loosely lay down aluminum foil across the muffin tin, crumple it on one side of the tin, then slightly press the foil down into the muffin cups (do not press all the way down), and then crumple the foil on the other end of the muffin tin.  This enables the egg to "float" and not touch the muffin tin.  

Hope this helps those who do not care for the spots either.

It turned out surprisingly well. I was a little worried about how the eggs would handle the heat so I added a little water in each muffin cup. I don't know if that changed anything, but I like this cooking method. Thanks!

I tried it. I used a silicone muffin pan to avoid the red spots that some were complaining about. Instead of having a red dot,I got a large discolored yellowish area they also had a big dimple at the bottom. The yolks were not centered. Maybe that is because I let them sit in the muffin pan to get them to room temperature. At this point I am not a fan but will give it one more try when looks are not important.

They taste fine, but mine were difficult to peel.  I would use this method at work, but not at home.  I don't mind boiling them, and they peel easier if you put salt in the water.  

Good method for some situation!

So after reading about 30 reviews, I decided to give this a try.  First, I did line my muffin tin.  I took  doubled squares of parchment paper and put them in the bottom of each muffin cup.   Next, I took a squares of parchment paper and cradled each egg as if using a paper liner.  Then I baked for 30 minutes at 350°.  EVERY SINGLE EGG had some form of discoloration and a dark dot.  None of the yolks were centered within the whites.  However, for my purposes, that doesn't matter.  Only one  egg was  really, really, really done.  Meaning light greenish grey, very thin line around outer layer of the yolk.  The rest perfect yellow.  Decision for me is if I am making devilled eggs, I will do traditional boiling.  For use as an ingredient, I will do this method.  Way easier.  Some of my eggs peeled perfectly and some not so much.  Taste was spot on for the one I sampled for breakfast.

I did it with the recommendation of someone else who suggested spreading foil across the tin, with indentations gently made for each egg.  Worked great- delicious, easy

Awesome.  I used extra large muffins tins and put my egg inside of cup and then filled each cup with warm water.  I then baked as directed and then after 30 minutes immersed the cooked eggs in cold water and ice cubes.  Turned out perfectly would do this again in a flash.

Horrible. Terrible. No Good runny eggs.  This was the worst. Dyeing eggs for Easter I decided to try this method for my 5 dozen eggs we were dyeing. My kids like to eat a few eggs as we go, first egg was perfect. Second egg had a runny side other side was perfect - half cooked egg. The third was completely raw. Fourth a perfect soft boiled egg.  SO FRUSTRATING. We then started googling way to tell a hard boiled egg from a raw. Out of pure frustration I ended up putting ALL the eggs into boiling water just to ensure they are fully cooked. Never Ever Ever again. Waste of time and energy.

I followed the instructions to the letter, I even put liner's to prevent the eggs from getting pan marks. But in my posted picture I got red spots on my eggs which for me personally I don't care, these eggs will be getting made into egg salad. I tried this recipe out due to me having to replace the cooking elements on my electric stove which has me using my oven a lot more than using the stove top for cooking. So I haven't tasted them yet but I'm sure I'll be happy with the results.

These boiled eggs were amazing!!! The egg yolks were creamy and soft. I put them in the oven in muffin tins for 28 minutes and at 350. It is soooooo difficult to find the right amount of time to boil eggs in Alaska. They are either too gooey or too hard. Maybe the altitude?

This didn’t work for me at all. I was going to make about 4 dozen deviled eggs. I decided to do an experiment  and sacrificed 2 eggs. One of my freshest( maybe bought 4 days before, one  from some that I had for a couple weeks). They were room temp. I saw another site that put them directly on the rack , so I did  that. Baked like this recipe said, put into ice water.  Thise shells were stuck wose than any I have ever seen. Most of the white endef up a broken mess. Age  of eggs didnt seem to make any difference.  SORRY.  Just didint work for me . Glad I didnt try all 4 dozen. 
I did discover what turned out to be a great method for ne.  I steamed them in my 3 level steamer and they almost peeled themselves. ( google  steaming eggs to hard stage) takes about 12 minutes

Works pretty well. Browns a little bit of the egg on the inside, but I think it may be easier to peel these than boiled ones.

Preheated to 350* and kept them in for 20 minutes. Immediate ice bath for about 10 (didn't time it). Most of the eggs were very easy to peel - you can't expect perfection 100% of the time. The inside came out perfectly for every egg doing this! And yes, I am also showing off my cooking in the picture....

Made sixteen eggs in a mini muffin tin according to directions. They came out perfect and were insanely easy to peel! I did get some very small brown spots. Simply peeled that part off since I'm making egg salad. If you're doing deviled eggs you may want to follow other suggestions and add tinfoil or other barrier to the bottom/sides to avoid those.

I couldn't eat them, not done.  I tried the suggestion of others here to do 30 min at 325.  They had runny whites near yolk.  They were also impossible to peel. I won't even try this again.

This may not post since I actually haven't tried it yet, but I'm definitely going to, and soon! I'll use my silicon muffin cups  and will make  sure to leave them in ice water (will add more ice if necessary), and maybe even peel them under water as one reviewer suggested. Egg salad coming up!! Thank you for this!

I like soft boiled eggs, so had to experiment with the timing. In my toaster oven at work I place the egg right on the oven rack and bake at 350 deg. for 17 minutes, then plunge in ice water until they are cool . Perfect if you like them soft, not dry, and so easy. Other reviewers have given hints as to how to eliminate the little spots on the shell, but my purpose is to shell and eat the egg, so the color of the shell does not bother me.

I used foil as suggested in other comments so no spots and my tip is, after baking crack shell a bit before plunging in cold water that way water gets between shell and egg for easy peeling! I just gave them a whack with a butter knife as they are to hot to handle at that point. Also let eggs warm to room temp before baking to prevent sweating spots ;)

These did not work so well for me, I would recommend a lower temperature and shorter amount of time. The egg shells exploded off in my oven everywhere and the eggs were too dry to eat.

It didn't work. My eggs came out with the white gooey and liquid and the yellow half cooked half runny and raw. I cooked as instructed. Not sure what exactly went wrong.

Nope. Nope. Nope. 350° was too hot. Burn spots were left on the bottom of the egg. The eggs were sweating. The sweating spots turned into burn spots. I had four out of the 12 to crack.  I had a thermometer in the oven to make sure it stayed exactly on 350° which was way too hot for the eggs.

Followed the directions exactly. 325 degrees for 25 minutes.  They were runny and I had to throw them away.  So disappointed.

This is so easy! I have heard about this method for months and finally decided to try. It's so consistent among eggs, less risk of breaking in the water, and they turn out PERFECTLY! The yolk is beautifully yellow, and the shells peel off so easily! I usually put the eggs back in the carton and store them in the refrigerator after the ice bath. I think this helps loosen the shells as well. It's so easy to grab and go! I will never boil eggs again! :)

I followed the recipe exactly, with jumbo eggs, but every one had a couple burn marks on the white!  If they were just for munching, no problem, but these were for Deviled Eggs for Thanksgiving.  I am not aware that my oven cooks hot...?  Would not recommend this method when the eggs need to look perfect!

Oven: 325 degrees. Lined muffin tins with foil and then added paper muffin liners to each csup. I believe this added step prevent  brown spots on shells- just in case you want to have a bowl of hard boiled eggs on your breakfast or brunch buffet table. The oven method helps in the peeling of the eggs, which I found to be much easier than the traditional method of boiling the eggs. Have tried this method 5 times, and each time  the eggs came out perfectly! No more boiling of eggs! This method is a keeper!

While I haven't yet made the dozen, it is now on my list.  I prepped four eggs with the ascribed instructions and they turned out perfectly.  This will be my preferred method of hard "boiling" eggs in the future!

Tried it since I have a hard time getting shell and not white off egg when I boil. No better. The issue isnt getting the shell off as much as how to prevent the white from adhering to the inside of the shell. There is a thin film between the white and the shell, this is what the white adheres to and prevents me from shelling eggs without the white....have not had luck with ANY suggestions.

Very easy to do.  They peel easily and the yolk does not stick to the white part of the egg.  It does leave a tiny small brown mark where it may have touched the muffin tin (I used cup cake wrappers as well to keep from rolling around.)but its so  small it just pinches off.  Definitely found a new way to boil eggs.

Some of them exploded.  So I took them out of the oven (350 degrees) after 27 minutes.  And some were greyish around the yolks.  They were wet around the whites when I shelled them.  Taste was fine.  Texture was fine.  Might make it again because it beats leaving a pot of water unattended!

I placed the eggs right on the rack due to not having a muffin tin.  A few of the eggs started to crack so I decreased the baking time by 5 minutes.  There were some brown spots on the shell and the egg whites turned slightly off-white, but they taste great!

These were easy and pretty good. My guest and I both thought they tasted like regular boiled eggs, with not much discernible difference in texture. I wouldn't use these if I wanted them for deviled eggs or anything where they needed to be pretty. They had a very tiny brown mark on them where they touched the edge of the pan, and the yolk was a bit green, which I have been told is a huge no-no (a sign of overcooking). But for snacking purposes they are easy and great when you are not feeling well. I cooked them at 325 degrees instead, which I read somewhere else on the Internet, and for just 25 minutes. I think 350 would have been too high, and resulted in even more green, I do have an oven thermometer, which says the temp is right, but I may go for even less time to try to nix the green (unless I'm having a Dr. Seuss breakfast:))

They wouldn't peel! The white tore off with the shells and by the time I ripped half the eggs off with the shells the yolks were cooked on one side. I cooked them directly on the rack before and had much better results.

I was disappointed - I tried 3 eggs and found at least 2 spots on each egg which is unacceptable for "deviled" eggs.  I will continue with bringing to a boil, and then cover with lid (off the burner)

I liked the convenience of this, but did not like having to cut off the red dot on the eggs; I followed the tip to cool off for 10 minutes in ice water, I found them anything but easy to peel unfortunately.  I think I'll stick to my old fashioned way next time...

I followed the recipe exactly and did not find them easier to peel than boiled eggs.  Also, I had at least one brown/orange spot on each egg which was not appealing when used for deviled eggs.  The whites were discolored also.  I'm glad I tried it finally, but from now on, I'll go back to the regular method.
