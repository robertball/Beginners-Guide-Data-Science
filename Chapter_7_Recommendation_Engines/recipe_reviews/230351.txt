Yummy!  So happy to use produce from our garden. I didn’t have bottled dressing so just used olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I had never added basil to this salad before. Thanks for the idea. It added wonderful flavor.

One of my favorite dishes.  The seasonings and color are very palate pleasing; to the eye and to the taste buds.

I’ve made this salad a lot this summer, and we love it! The bottled dressing makes it so easy to put together. I don’t have fresh herbs, so I just sprinkled a little of each dried. The feta cheese makes this so good! My only issue is that a whole 16 oz bottle of dressing is way too much—I only use about 8 oz.

This was pretty good. The bulk of the flavor comes from the Greek dressing, so make sure you pick a good one! I don't normally buy bottled dressings, so I wasn't sure which to get. I bought one of the famous brands, ahem, rhymes with raft. I wouldn't recommend using theirs. The dressing isn't affecting my rating though since it's one  I chose. However, I did find using a full bottle to be a LOT of dressing, so use your judgement on that one. I appreciate the time saved by using a bottled dressing, but next time I will just make my own. I also had to increase the fresh basil and oregano because we could barely taste it.
