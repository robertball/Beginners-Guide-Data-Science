My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  I used more like a cup and a half of panko, omitted the Parmesan, and added a generous measure of Old Bay and cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.  I cooked the clams for 60 seconds on each side and they came out perfect. Will definitely be making again!

Living in Alaska, we have tried numerous clam preparation methods and recipes.  This is by far the best ever.  It does take a bit of preparation, but it is totally worth it.  I share this with my special friends.  We use the necks and diggers for chowder; so with this recipe, only use the "steaks".  I like a squeeze of fresh lime on mine, and we all love some fresh, homemade tartar sauce.  We are very blessed to have the opportunity to dig and enjoy these razor clams on a regular basis. I should also add that where we live, a hungry man can eat no more than four of these enormouse clam steaks...okay, maybe five.  So you may want to adjust the recipe accordingly. Thanks for the recipe; it is exceptional!

Living in Western WA gives us opportunity to enjoy clams for dinner almost all year round.  After cleaning the clams, we use our Food Saver to vaccuum seal the clams and freeze.  When we fry our claims we substitute cornmeal for the flour and add a little cajun seasoning to the Panko bread crumbs.

This is a forgiving recipe...I misread the directions and dipped the clams in eggs, then flour, and then back in the eggs , and then the panko....didn't cause any problems whatsoever.  The family thought the breading was a little bland....I  really did up the seasoning in the flour...and I just kept the panko and parm...I think I will add seasoning to the panko mix....I fried fresh razor clams (mixture of foots and body).  I heated the oil to 350 F and then fried several clams at once.  For 3, I did it under 3 minutes total...the crust was a dark brown...this was a perfect time...I did not cook any batch more than 3 minutes....in fact,  most of my clams cooked at 2 min mark or 2 and 1/2 min mark.  They were perfectly cooked.  I found that I needed more panko than the 1 C suggested in the recipe.  I also was able to cook 12 clams with this recipe.  I had a lot of the flour mixture left over...so it might be worth considering to half the amount of flour...so not to waste...

We've been cooking razor clams for years and this is by far our favorite recipe!!!  I cut the clam into 3 or 4 pieces, you want them good sized and instead of fresh parmesan, I use the parmesan/romano mix in the can with green lid.  It isn't as chunky, it blends nicely with the panko.  It is a bit time consuming, but once you've had them it doesn't seem like all that much work.  Each time we make them, the pieces get bigger and bigger so it doesn't take so long to fry them.  I like them with fresh lemon squeezed on and them dipped in a little bit of tartar.  They are also delicious just by themselves!!!

My family loves to go razor clamming down on the coast of Washington State. This is our go to recipe when catching our limit. We made a big batch of fried razor clams for dinner that night with half our clams, and then a pot of clam chowder for dinner the next night. Panko crumbs are essential for this recipe if you like crunch.

We absolutely love this recipe! My husband never really cared for the clams until we tried this. Now he loves them! It's the only recipe we ever use. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Monster hit!  Made a batch of these from fresh razor clams and everyone raved about them!  The key was the coconut oil I fried them in and also that I beat the clams thin before breading. Delicious mix of herbs and perfectly crisp not too thick bread mix.

This is the BEST RAZOR CLAM RECIPE EVER!!!  We are a little crazy over dill in our house, so the only thing we added to the recipe is fresh dill & we omitted nothing. The flour, then egg, then Panko/parm makes the breading turn out perfectly & my clams have never tasted so good now that I am using a tendrizer first and then frying them for the correct amount of time.  This is the only recipe we use now.  Thank you!

First time I ever ate razor clams!! Love the recipe!! Razor clams? Not s'much. LOL I'm not a huge fisher lover. They were alright, I guess, as long as I didn't look at them. LOL I feel like a little kid!! After digging them up, all I could see was their squidgey little bodies and I just couldn't swallow. To those of you who eat these... break them like Danigirl and you got yourself a winner!! :D

Used just seasoned flour (Mike's fish batter), the egg wash, and the panko. Tricky getting the oil temperature just right to brown it without over or undercooking, but once I got that figured out the results were excellent.

After 20 years of frying razor clams that were sometimes tough, this method of freezing-before-frying ensures perfect tender clams every time even for the beginner.  Thanks!
