Great recipe!  We didn't have any peppers or mushrooms so I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted onions.  I caramelized them in the pan I used for the bacon and the worchesterschire/dijon gave them an almost onion-ring flavor.  It was too cold to grill, so I ended up cooking the steaks in the same pan with the onions and just piled them up on top.  The blue cheese gave this recipe a nice touch of flair.  As we were eating dinner, my husband said, "The website called this dish 'Men Love this Steak.'  Well, they were right."  Mission accomplished.

Another new favorite for the boyfriend. For the most part I followed the recipe. Instead of steak seasoning, I just rubbed in some salt, pepper, garlic, and basil into the steaks. I knew the sauce was going to have a strong flavor and I didn't want the steak seasoning to compete. Due to the freezing temps outside, I cooked the steaks inside in the bacon fat leftover from the frying. When the steaks were done, I removed them (kept them warm in the oven) and saut√©ed some onions (don't like mushrooms) in the bacon fat/steak juices. I proceeded to make the sauce as specified. Though I forgot to add the butter, the sauce didn't seem to miss it.
This recipe is a definite keeper.

They most certainly do! Aside from being a *little* more liberal with the dijon and worcestshire, I followed this recipe exactly. Thanks for the recipe, KLEVEAR, it's a hit!

I have a terrible habit of ruining steak so I was nervous about using this recipe.  My husband was coming home from a long business trip and I wanted to bless him so I tried this one.

Wow!!! It was the best meal I've made in a long time.  We all loved it!!!  I used feta instead of blu since none of us like blu and the feta really topped this off!

I agree with the writer, Men love this Steak!

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipie! I did have to make a few substitutions to please my husband! Used onions instead of the peppers and mushrooms- and it was fantastic! He begged for the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I also added a grill butter I made with basil and garlic. Thanks again for the recipe!! Will make many more times!

Great recipe.  I normally give 4 stars unless it makes me say, "WOW!"  This was really good.  My husband does not like veggies or bleu cheese, yet he scarfed it down without any hesitation.  That says 5 stars to me!  Lots of flavor.

It's true.  After just one bite both my son and my husband declared this to be the best steak I've ever made!  Like the other reviewers I used onions instead of mushrooms and peppers, feta instead of bleu cheese and I added a splash of red wine to the sauce just because I like it with red meat.  This recipe is a keeper, for sure!

Very good steak. I made this tonight with some refried beans and sliced avacado. My husband is hispanic so he like his beans. I doubled the veggies because I made four steaks. Turned out great. My husband said it was one of the best steaks he has ever had. Thanks for the recipe and I will be making this all the time!

This was so great. The rib eye steaks I bought were quite thicker so I just kept them on the grill a bit longer. This recipe is so easy but everyone thought I had been cooking all evening. Served with baked potatoes and sourdough bread. Thanks for this recipe!!

This had so much flavor and was super easy! It was my first time making steak, and things could not have turned out better. I cooked the steak in a broiler pan in the oven, which made things even faster. What a great combination of flavors from the blue cheese and the sauce that the veggies sauteed in! I will definitely make it again.

The is a fabulous recipe.  Like some before me, I wasn't able to grill the steaks (Wisconsin is cold in the winter).  I made the bacon, poured off most of the grease (just left enough to cover the bottom), and cooked the steak in that pan.  I preheated the oven just the lowest setting possible and stuck the steak in there to keep it warm.  Then, I sauted up some onions and mushrooms in the steak/bacon juice with the Dijon mustard and the worchestire.  I piled that on top of the steaks and then added a bit of blue cheese.  We left the steaks in the oven for another minute or two to melt the blue cheese just a bit.  They were DELICIOUS!  My husband is already requesting that I make this for him again next week!

I made this according to the recipe but used t- bones. It was so yummy!! Our only problem was that it was so delicious that we overate. 

Today is our anniversary so I made this with "Absolutely Delicious Root Vegetables" (submitted by NEWSAHMOM), a tossed salad and Stuffed Strawberries (submitted by IMVINTAGE) with shaved dark chocolate for dessert. Love this website!!!  Awesome meal :)

Just for the record...WOMEN love this steak too! I modified with what I had: venison loin steaks and I wrapped each steak in bacon and secured with toothpicks before setting on the grill. Wonderful!

I made this and it was pretty good, my man liked it too. But, we agreed that there needs to be either blue cheese or bacon, not both. It's just too salty. Also, next time I won't cook the veggies in the bacon grease. I think the veg would be better if it had it's own flavor instead of bacon flavor.

I had everything chopped and ready to start cooking, when I opened the white paper to unwrap the steaks and they turned out to be pork chops.  I went ahead as directed, except I used provolone instead of blue cheese, since it was pork. My family said they were the best pork chops ever!  I agree.  If it is that good on pork, then it would be really great with steak!  Cant wait to try it again, with the correct meat.

I made this topper for our london broil and served it on the side. My father in law loved it! I didn't buy fresh red peppers because I had a jar of roasted ones and it was still great. Love the combo with these ingredients.

Loved this! I forgot to add the cheese and the bacon, but honestly it didn't even taste like it was missing anything! So easy and delish! I am a new cook and I don't have a grill, so I cooked it in the broiler and it still came out perfect! Thanks!

This was amazing.  We increased the mushrooms, peppers and added onions.  I also increased the worchestershire and dijon a little bit as well.  Served with grilled asparagus and baked potatoes.  What a hearty meal - definitely worth making again!

This was delicious!  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning to season the steaks. I didn't have any mushrooms, although I wish I did, and I used feta cheese rather than bleu cheese.  It was a hit! Everyone loved it.

Holy !  This rocked my world. I substituted Feta for the Blue Cheese.  I also added green peppers.   This was a huge hit.  I can't wait to make it again for another special occasion.

This was a fantastic recipe! I added red bell pepper in with the other veg and because of the weather decided to grill the steak. First I crisped up the bacon and then cooked the steak in the bacon grease - I transferred the steak to a warm oven until everything else was done. My husband and I both loved it, he said this was the best meal he's had in a long time!

Wow, do men EVER love this recipe... and women too!  Made it basically as it said except added a tad more dijon and worchestershire sauce... also added some red onions to the vegetable mix and probably a bit more butter than it called for. Didn't have any blue cheese so used feta. Delish!!! Thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper!!!

Wow!  So good!  I think anyone would love this steak.  So easy and delicious, I will make this again and again.  I didn't have worcestershire, so I had to substitute Maggi sauce.  I think I would keep it like that too because it was a huge hit!

Pretty good - I didn't add butter. Used onions instead of the vegetables in the recipe. Overcooked the meat a little bit since I did everything on the stovetop and kept the steaks warm in the oven when I cooked the onions. Served with scalloped potatoes and sauteed spinach. Nice dinner after a rough day.

These were ok.My bf and I actually enjoyed the veggies more than the steak because we prefer our steak marinated rather than rubbed. I didn't see a purpose for the bacon. Maybe just to flavor the veggies?

well klevear, you are right - my man loved this steak!! :)  my only change was to use feta cheese instead of blue, since hubby doesn't like blue cheese.  but otherwise i was true to the recipe.  and since my hubby is really stuck on A1 for his steaks, his great approval of this says a lot!  thanks!

Very good indeed!! It reminded me of Applebee's Bourbon Street Steak. Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I did add onions to my bell pepper and mushroom saute.  I also omitted the blue cheese, since we are not fans of it and replaced it with feta cheese.  This was awesome indeed.  I served with steamed brocolli and wisconsin beer cheese soup. YUM!!

AMAZING!!!  So much flavor!  This steak is fantastic!  I will certainly be saving the recipe and making it again.  Per suggestion of the other reviews, I used onions instead of peppers and crumbled the bacon.  Once again, an utterly FANTASTIC recipe!  Your man will love it!

Very good indeed. I pan fried my steaks with a square pan that has grooves in it so I got the grill marks on the steaks. Turned out great! I forgot to buy bell peppers though but the bleu cheese and bacon  gave  nice flavors.

I made this recipe for my fiance and I and overall the recipe is good. The ingredients all go well together. One change I will make the next time I make it is using sirloin instead of ribeye. The ribeye is just too fatty for this recipe. I do not like fat on my meat so cutting around all the fat kind of ruined the experience of enjoying the delicious veggie, cheese and bacon topping. Oh, I also added onions to my veggie mix and some pinot noir in the sauce. I will make this again but with sirloin.

Like natalie, I didn't use bacon at all. The butter, worcestershire sauce, dijon mustard combined with the moisture from the mushrooms and red peppers to make the sauce a perfect consistency for me. I left the blue cheese on the side. I loved it with the blue cheese. My wife, though she didn't like the blue cheese, loved the rest of the recipe!

Very good.  I did mess up and made the sauce before adding the mushrooms and peppers.  It was still tasty, but didn't have enough sauce to put on top both steaks.

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner tonight. He and his roommate LOVED it! Only problem I had was that it didn't make lots of sauce with the mushrooms and peppers. I added some more Worcestershire sauce and dijon and it came out great. Definite make again!

This steak is simply delicious. OMG!!! Like others that tried it, I skipped the mushrooms. I put the steaks in a zip lock bag with the Worcestershire sauce and steak seasoning for a few hours.  I added more Worcestershire sauce, butter and Dijon mustard for an extra creamier sauce  to the bacon fat!!. I also added sliced onions into the sauce until they caramelized. The blue cheese gives the steak a nice kick!! The left overs were even better for breakfast with eggs!!!

This recipe was amazing and, yes, my boyfriend loved it when i surprised him with dinner one night. I didn't really measure out the pepper. I just cut a whole one and a whole onion and threw in a few mushrooms bc we're not big fans of them. I was also a lot more liberal with the sauce and mustard. All in all, amazing recipe. I think I will make it again this weekend! It's one of the few I can't screw up! =]

Greasy, but definitely delicious. Next time I will NOT use the bacon grease for the veggies, and Im sure it would then get 5 stars. the butter should be plenty to saute them.

The combination of flavors in this recipe is awesome.  I also added more worcestershire sauce and dijon mustard (to taste) and I rough chopped the peppers to bite size pieces.  It wasn't noted in the recipe, but I used McCormick's Monterey Steak Seasoning on the steaks and pressed it into the meat prior to grilling.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I doubled it as I had 4 steaks. They were devoured! Sometimes I overthink the seasoning on steaks, I'm not very confident with the grill yet, and this recipe forced me to keep it simple. Wonderfully balanced and full bodied. I recommend it to anyone!

This was great, the only thing I did was double the ingredients with the bacon sauce so I could drizzle it over my mashed potatoes , I will be making this again.

I really followed the instructions on cooking 3 minutes on each side and only turning once.   Perfect for medium rare.   The flavours were a nice change from other steaks I‚Äôve done.

This recipe was probably the BEST steak I have ever eaten in my entire life! My family loved it. I used onions instead of peppers because that's what I had. Outstanding!!

I made this tonight, but I doubled everything. Every one thought I was a rock-star chef.  Especially my husband who never gives me praise unless it is deserved.  I cooked the steak rare and after I put the bleu cheese on, I put it in a warm oven to melt it for a minute.  This girl loved this steak too!

Does well on any steak.  Add some yellow onions and a half of smoked jalapeno if you have it.

I made this steak for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day! It was really good!  Neither of us used steak sauce and that is always a must! I made it in the pan because it was also to cold to grill! I also substituted the mushrooms for onions and feta cheese instead of blue. I would also like to add I'm not a fan of Dijon mustard, I couldn't taste it however, it just gave it a really good flavor!

I just made it and it was delish!  I did grill in the middle of Feb in Chicago and it was well worth the chill.  I didn't have peppers or mushrooms so I followed the advice of others and used onions and I added a clove of garlic.  I wasn't quiet sure about using maple bacon but that was all I had and it was very good.  I was also a little worried about using honey dejon and it worked too! Over all a very delicious dinner!

I absolutely love this recipe! I do change a few things to suit our taste. I add onions in with the peppers and mushrooms and I top the steak with swiss cheese before adding veggies because we don't like bleu cheese. I fix this very often, and I'll never fix steak any other way again!

This worked really well.  I added chopped onion and I put the bleu chz on the steak while it was on grill to melt it.  The bacon grease was a little much but still delicious.

This is a wonderfully simple, elegant and tasty recipe! I only changed the steak type as ribeye steaks at Costco were $50 for four steaks.  I used beef loin, boneless NY steaks.  These were 60% cheaper, but tasted great!  The bleu cheese crumbles were essential to the success of this recipe.

Very Awesome.  We made it minus the bacon and the bacon grease and it was delicous.  I think I'd prefer onions instead of the red bell pepper.

I made this recipe twice and it was great both times. Yesterday I used thin sandwich steaks and because of the cold weather I cooked them in the same pan I used for the bacon. I removed the steak and kept it warm while I sauted onion and peppers. I then added the rest of the ingredients to the pan and made it extra saucy.  I served with baked potatoes and everything came out so good. This recipe is one of our new favorites.

This is one of the best steaks I ever made. It was delicious. I followed the recipie to the letter and I was not disappointed. I did add spinach to the veggie part, but that was the only change I made.

I liked this steak.  My husband, however said, and I quote "You could have made this for anyone else and been fine, but I HATE it."   Needless to say, won't be making this again.

I made this for my boyfriend. He absolutely LOVED it! Said it was the best meal I had ever made. I pan-seared the steaks first then threw them in the oven for about 5-8 minutes. They were pretty thick steaks so they turned out perfectly. I made zucchini/squash with this dish and drizzled lemon juice and garlic salt on top of them and baked them in the oven. GREAT MEAL! This steak is the absolute best.

I added yellow onion, used orange pepper instead of red, honey dijon mustard instead of regular dijon mustard in the veggies and they turned out great.  I also added the worcestershire sauce and honey dijon mustard along with the steak seasoning and the steak turned out very tender and delicious. I will definetly be making this recipe again and again!

Good recipe idea.  It needed something to really bring it all together in the end so I added 1/2 cup of half and half and a 1/2 tsp of sugar.  Fresh cracked pepper and a little fresh parsley at the end can go a long way as well-- then it became 5 stars.

As the submitter of this recipe, I'd like to clarify a couple of things:  I use McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning (but you can use whatever you like) and I use center-cut or other meaty bacon.  Don't use fatty bacon.  I like to use red bell peppers, too, it makes a better presentation, but DH thinks they aren't as good.

My husband and I both LOVED this recipe.  I used the George Forman to grill the steak (since we don't have an outdoor grill) and it worked great.  Only cook the steak for half the time, but it tasted good and left little mess.  Cooked asparagus in the frying pan after the bacon and it was an excellent side.  I usually tweak and add spices as I like lots of flavor, but didn't have to do a thing to this one.  It had plenty of flavor without any tweaking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the recipe very similar to above and it was so good.  The first thing i did differently, was double the bacon... because who doesn‚Äôt love bacon?!?!  Then after removing the bacon, i added 1/2 of a sweet onion and spinach.  Then went onto the sauce.  I didn‚Äôt have Dijon, so I used yellow mustard, and doubled the worchesire sauce and added a little bit of garlic.

This was delicious, and I think I enjoyed it as much as my men (hubs and two grown sons).  I used New York strip prepared medium rare and sliced it into 1/4 inch strips and spooned this over.  I also drained half the bacon fat and then added the cooked bacon back into the veggies at the end of the cooking cycle.  It's not nearly as heavy as it sounds and I will definitely prepare this again.

Turned out really well. My husband loved it with the bacon and blue cheese. I am not a huge fan of blue cheese and I skipped the bacon but still enjoyed the steak with the peppers and mushrooms.

Was fantastic I cooked the bacon in an electric skillet and then cooked everything else in the bacon fat afterwards. Was amazing! Even my 1 year old loved it. She devoured the mushrooms especially.

First I will never buy a steak from Walmart again.  Tough, stringy and inedible.  No need to ruin a great steak with this marinade and vegies.  Plain broiled from the oven with baked potatoes and string beans almondine.  Chocolate and Pistachio pie with fresh whipped cream make a great dinner.

My man did love this steak! I followed it exactly except for cooking it in the oven (20 min at 250F, then pan seared 2 min/side) and it honestly turned out way tastier than I thought it would, even with me being a steak-hater. Thanks!

4 1/2 stars for this recipe. It was very flavourful, but a little bit too salty because of the bacon. Next time I might halve the seasoning salt, otherwise it was absolutely awesome.

FANTASTIC RECIPE!  My fianc√© just kept saying "wow", wow. LOL. I added onions to the peppers & mushrooms, as he loves onions. Also, used green peppers b/c that Is what I had. I now have to make a large batch for his company bbq this Friday. And he is diesel mechanic so it's all men. Guess that means its a winner!  Thank you!!!

Super easy steak recipe when you aren't able to use a grill. My boyfriend loved this and is waiting for me to make it again. Be aware of the cut of the steak as this can change the cooking time for the desired amount of doneness.

Wow, it's just so good.  My husband just told me it's the best dinner I've ever made (and I've been cooking for him for 7 years).   Didn't change a thing except I pan fried the steak since we don't have a BBQ.

Great recipe! This recipe taught me how to make a mean steak - and I'm a beginner-cook. I don't have much experience cooking steak, so I was a bit nervous trying out this recipe - but everything was self-explanatory and the best thing is that steak tastes great a bit rare; so you don't have to obsess over cooking time. The only thing is that this IS heavy - I would recommend omitting the butter as bacon grease itself has so much fat/calories and will cook the vegetables perfectly by itself. I used the red pepper and mushrooms - next time, I'll also throw in some onions. I served this for my boyfriend for a romantic dinner - he LOVED the steak. I served the steak with a salad and homemade mashed potatoes (found that recipe also on allrecipes; it is the garlic-herb mashed potatoes, went GREAT with it!)  I don't like blue cheese so I skipped that step. Thank you for this recipe!

This steak was delicious!!!! I used Penzeys steak seasoning (which I think makes a big difference)! I ended up cooking the steaks on a braiser since I live in a high rise (can't grill!) turned out perfect! Served it with sliced potato chips seasoned with Lawrys seasoned salt! Yummy:)

Incredible recipe!  Made exactly as recipe indicated and it was so good!  My husband and I have had the opportunity to eat in very nice steak houses, and this rivaled many of them.  We will definitely have this again and are looking forward to serving it to guests.

I have to say I had high hopes for this given the rave reviews, but it wasn't spectacular.  The veggie/bacon topping was delicious with the blue cheese, but the steak would be so much better if it was marinated.  Also, the recipe contains much too much grease.  I didn't even use the butter, and still felt it was a tad too oily for my taste.  The Smothered Filet Mignon recipe on this site is far superior.

tastes AMAZING!!! made it with a side of roasted potatoes (from here as well) and sauteed asparagus. If you're on a budget, make it with Chuck Steak, I did it and it's still amazing.

This steak was a BIG hit with my husband.  He told me a million times how good it was and even thanked me again for dinner before he went to bed lol.  Only thing I would say is I doubled the butter, Worcestershire, and mustard sauce part because by following the recipe I did not think it made enough to really put a good amount on top of each of the steaks.

I used a full red bell pepper thin sliced, and about 2 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms. I didn't have steak marinade, so I used a tomato and garlic marinade and then proceeded as directed. We LOVED the bacon/mushroom/bell pepper topping on this; we sprinkled with a little Parmesan cheese and it was so yummy!

Like many, I altered slightly.  I cooked in pan with the bacon grease, added onions and used feta cheese and it was a big hit.  I do recommend cooking steak for only a few minutes and letting sit for 5 minutes.  My steaks came out pink in the middle and the knife glided through...perfection!  I did 2 steaks to start and it took me about 15min but an hour later, I breezed cooking another steak in less than 5 minutes.  The receipe is simple that it's burned to memory that I can make in a moment.  Thanks!!

My boyfriend doesn't like red bell pepper so I took the advice of another user and carmelized some onions.  The steak was delicious and he absolutely loved it.

Made this for dinner tonight, it was very good and I will make it again.  I did do a few changes based on what others said.  First was I marinated the steak with Whiskey-Marinade (from this site).  I also used Feta cheese with fresh chopped basil, instead of the blue cheese. With the mushrooms and red bell pepper I also added red onion and garlic. Also made more sauce for the veggies.

This is a fantastic, yet easy steak to prepare.  My man loves his steak, and grills several times per week.  This one not only got rave reviews by him, but he wanted me to make it again this week.  We added some wood chips to give it a smokier taste and like the other reviewers, omitted the mushrooms in lieu of onions.  Yum!! The second time I omitted the bacon (and obviously the bacon grease) to make it healthier, and it was still really good.  This is now going to be a staple recipe in the home.

Never thought I would ever say that "I like Blue Cheese", but it was lovely on this recipe.  Just could not say enough on this recipe, just soooooo good.  Will make it again and again.  A winner.

This was a great recipe, I did make a few adjustments. I marinated overnight but added white wine to the mixture. I didn't have any peppers or mushrooms, but I made fried onion strings. It was delicious. I also have used the blue cheese, but my kids prefer it with feta or provolone. This is definitely one of my favorite steak recipes.

you can rarely go wrong cooking this cut of meat. However, I used the broiler, 6-7 minutes on each side, and my husband enjoyed it. The blue cheese gives it a nice kick of flavor.

Really good topping on a steak!  My wife and I loved it!  I was out of mustard so I just used more worcestershire and it was still great.  I can't wait to try it again with the mustard to see what it adds.  I think next time I will use a little more red pepper and maybe add some onion.

Holy Cow was this DELICIOUS!  (No pun intended).  I used rib eye steaks and the meal was just fabulous.  Extremely high fat, yes, but so worth it if you do this only occasionally.  I didn't have dijon on hand and used regular French's mustard;  I guess I don't know if it tasted better or worse, I just know we were VERY satisfied and full for hours.  I did grill small potatoes with this meal and it was definitley too much to eat.  Yum.  I will make this recipe again, next time I want to be showered with praise, (and have time for a loooong walk afterwards)!

My husband loved this steak...even with a few of my mistakes!  (I forgot to take the steaks out of the freezer, so I had to quick defrost...then, I found out I had no bacon...so I had to skip that)but he thought it was wonderful!  If I make it with the bacon next time I am probably guaranteed a mall shopping spree!  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best steak I have ever made at home. I loved it! Next time I make it I will have to cut down on the red bell pepper due to my husband and teenager not being big fans. I, however, loved each and every single bite! We broiled this versus grilling and we used filet mignon versus rib-eye. Resturant quality for sure!!!

This steak was delicious! My boyfriend and I both loved it. I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but I had some left over from another recipe and it paired extremely well with the bacon and mushrooms. The only thing I did differently than the recipe was I cooked 6 slices of bacon, since they shrink after they're cooked, and I got rid of half of the grease. But next time I make this, the other change I would make would be using onions instead of red peppers. But overall, great!

We had it without the cheese since neither of us are big fans (and I didn't have any in the house).  It tasted great. I added onions to the original recipe and made the Dijon mustard. My husband loved the bacon addition.

Treated myself and my wonderful wife to this tonight. Increased the portions (8 oz of beef barely qualifies as an appetizer for this carnivore, no matter what the doctor tells me!), doubling the amount of blue cheese proportionately, adding a goodly amount of garlic (Q: What is food without garlic? A: Sadly lacking!), using all three vegetables suggested. Served with grilled garlic potato slices and a nice Merlot. My taste buds claim it doesn't get any better. Now THIS is how a man is supposed to eat!! ;-) *Great* recipe which I will serve repeatedly in the future - thanks for the submission.
