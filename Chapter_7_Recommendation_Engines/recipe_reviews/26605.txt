Quick, filling, delicious and easy. My family realy Loved  it! I served it over mashed potatos.
 I added a few things to this recipe that realy made it rock.
1:I used condensed beef vegtable soup insted of regular veg. soup.

2: I added about 3/4 cup choped onion when I browned the beef. (I use the frozen ones)

3: I added the following spices while browning beef- 2 tsp onion powder - 2 tsp garlic powder
2tsp Italian spice and 2tsp seasoned salt

4: I added a can of choped stewed tomatoes.

This is a great base recipe, but it requires a lot of "tweaking." I put in about half a can of drained green beans, generous garlic salt, seasoned salt, ground black pepper, and thyme. My boyfriend LOVED it. I am going to try adding more vegetables next time. Good if you are a creative cook who just needs a "starter" to work from. :)

Wonderful!!! I didn't have any cream of veggie so I just used the mushroom soup at the end. I sauteed an onion in a cast iron skillet and set it aside, browned the ground beef with italian seasoning, salt & pepper, mixed in the mushroom soup, added the sauteed onion with 3 cloves of minced garlic, brought the whole thing to a boil and served it with mayo, tomato and avacado on top of Oroweat Country Potato buns. My husband and I couldn't stop saying "Yum!" the whole time we were eating it. Thanks so much for posting!

I am learning how to cook...I barely can boil an egg...this recipe (over homemade mashed potatoes that I found on here) was soooooo easy, good and left my family full. I added onions and garlic.

I haven't tried this recipe, although it sounds great; I make mine with V-8 and Velveeta cheese in place of the soups and mix in your favorite pasta...delicious!

Not only is this not "goulash" this is not a recipe. This is a "dump"!
It might taste OK but it's like a recipe for making toast.

My kids LOVED this recipe - I didn't think that it was too bad either.  I added a small bag of frozen corn and we served it over mashed potatoes.

I made this as written and when I did a taste it was a bit bland for what I wanted so  I decided to add a small can of diced tomatoes with green chiles to spunk it up a bit. We served this with macaroni but next time will try it over mashed potatoes without the tomatoes added. Thanks for a good recipe that is easily adaptable. It’s unfair to give a recipe a bad review because you don’t agree with the name of it or it has too much salt content. If you look at a recipe and see it has 2 cans of soup in it and you think it has too much salt content, move on, find something else but rating a recipe you haven’t even tried is unfair to the author of the recipe and this was the goulash style I grew up with.

Oh the Salt content!!! I did not make this exact because the salt content would be through the roof and I don't recommend eating condensed soup without adding water or milk.  I used the cream of mushroom, ground beef, and 1 cup frozen mixed veggies and 1 cup low sodium beef broth. It was good but not very goulash-y. More like a quick beefy supper soup.

It's quite nice, but really needs an onion and a few cloves of garlic in it as well. I usually serve with boiled potatoes.

This is what a cupboard of random things gets ya... Here's what I did.  Browned the beef with minced garlic and onion.  Had to add a second can of cream of mushroom, due to the insanely overpowering Veg soup.  Also, chucked in sour cream, milk, a pkg of Country Gravy Mix, Penzey's Black & Red, Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle and a shot of vanilla (yeah: Vanilla). Served over Angel Hair noodles.  It wasn't horrible by any means, just something I won't do again...
