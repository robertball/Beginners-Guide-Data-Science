This is REALLY yummy! I made the "potent grog" from the footnotes, and I'm very pleased with the flavor. This is good without the ice cream, but I really think the ice cream makes it. It froths up a whole lot, so be ready with a straw!

This AMAZING!!! I originally made this for our Halloween party last year and it was such a big hit that now I make it for all of our parties!!! It's so simple and delicious! Serve it in some large glass or metal mugs for that Halloween/Harry Potter feel#

AMAZING! I drizzled a little bit of caramel sauce over the top for the ~look~. Perfect drink for a Potter Marathon.

Leave lots of room in the cup when you drop the ice cream in,  but so worth it. Rich, creamy, sweet, and buttery,  but not oily or syrupy.
