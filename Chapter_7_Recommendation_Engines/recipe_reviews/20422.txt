This is a good jumping off recipe, that tastes those from restaurants. I used chicken with bones/skin and boiled it in the water, just as for chicken noodle soup.  I strained the broth thru a wire strainer into another pot.  I estimated the water to add to make the 15 cups. I wasn't going to measure hot liquid. I didn't have coriander. I coarsely chopped up cilantro (the leaf part of the same plant as coriander) and added it to the bowls of those who wanted it.  I didn't have tomatoes with chile peppers, so I chopped up two  jalape√±o peppers. Fresh just seemed better than canned.  My chili powder was hot. Despite my changes, this soup came out mild, which is fine.  Some like it mild, some like it hot.  Those that liked it hot added hot pepper sauce to their own bowl.  The last 5 minutes of the 25 I added a half a bag of frozen sweet corn. Also, I used the little pieces of nachos at the bottom of the bag. How I served it: I put a scoop of rice and a pinch of cilantro into the bowls. I laddled on the soup.  On top I put the cheese first and then the chips.  Then they added hot pepper sauce.  This did make a HUGE amount.  But with 7 people, I loved the leftovers. If my two child want Mexican for their graduation party, I will double this recipe. *laughs* As I am writing this, my oldest is going back for his 5th bowl! I think this was a wonderful recipe. But it also leaves room for the chef's imagination and taste difference. *S* Way to go Zeke!

This soup was delicious.  I read through the other reviews and added in additional ingredients and removed the tortilla strips altogether (it doesn't need them).  I made the recipe for 6 servings instead of 12 and it still made about 8-10 cups worth!  I added in 1 can of black beans (drained and rinsed), 1c. frozen corn, lime juice from 1 lime, and 2tbs. cilantro.  I reduced the broth/water to 4c. and added in 2, 10oz. cans of Rotel tomatoes/chiles.  I served it with the avocado and also a dollop of sour cream.  Really yummy & easy!

This was a great soup, full of flavor, and texture, but I tinkered with it. I only made 1/2 of the recipe as it seemed like enough to feed an army. I added a can of rinsed, drained, black beans and 1 1/2 c. frozen corn for texture. Instead of blending the onions (which bruises them) I fried the onion and garlic in margerine till tender, then I added the water and bouillion. If you like your soup smooth-blend the vegetables.  But if you like texture, try it this way. We topped with cheese-but also added a dollop of sour creme. For a southwest recipe-there was a very strong Italian taste, so next time I will cut back on the amount of oregano-but it was good with the full amount, I just wanted more of a southwest taste.  The kids loved it (even the picky 1 year old) and half of the recipe fed 7 of us with enough leftovers to feed us another meal.  I will definately fix this again. Thanks Zeke!

YUM!!!!! 5 forks up!!!!! Good enough to make for company! I added 1TB of olive oil to the broth, what a yummy broth!! I baked my corn tortillas, and garnished the soup with light sour cream, avacados and grated low fat cheddar cheese. A very nice hearty low fat meal!!

Excellent.  I used chicken broth for the liquid and a pint of homemade salsa (ready-made is fine) instead of the veggies and canned tomatoes.  Much easier this way and very delicious.  Also used baked corn tortillas rather than fried.  Low in fat but full of flavor.

Way to go, Zeke! This soup is delicious. I suggest to add a can of corn to your pot. Also, baking the tortillas is much easier, quicker, and healthier than frying. To shread tortillas quickly, stack about 4 at a time and use scissors!

AWSOME! Used 4 cups chicken broth in place of 3 cups wat, still use 15 bullion cubes. This takes a lot of time to make. I am thankful my sister was here to  shread chicken for me! or dinner would of been 30 minutes later!Couldn't find ground coriander, but found coriander seeds and put them in  my chopper  to groung. Worked perfectly! Will make again, an plan to have more time to do so!

WHOA!!!! This was delicious! I added dried cilantro, omitted the avocado and halved the recipe. Added shredded cheddar cheese at serving. This might be a touch watery or liquidy but I am not complaining. I do think adding black beans and maybe a little corn would be a nice touch. This is out of this world! Thank you.

Zeke, quite possibly the best soup we've ever had. Thank you.  I used Ro Tel diced tomatoes with cilantro and lime (added just alittle more fresh lime and cilantro) to the puree mixture. I also added about 1/2 c. corn.  We would have given it a 10 if we could have.

Yum! This was a delicious soup, and very easy. I did the same as some others said and didn't puree the vegetables and added black beans and corn. I also used crumbled tortilla chips in place of the fried tortilla strips, and only made half the recipe, which was more than enough for my family of 4. I will definitely make this again!

This soup was sooooo amazing. Better than any restaurant we've been to. I didn't changed much.. just added corn. I didn't have any corriander, so I didnt put that in it, but I added in some cayenne. Would make it over and over again!!

I scaled by half but used full amts of coriander and cumin.  Oregano bottle was empty so I added about a t. each of dried cilantro and parsley.  I added a can of organic pinto beans for more fiber and some frozen corn,  and used homemade chicken stock.  Simmered with a sliced jalapeno to kick it up a bit. Topped with smoked paprika and served with Corazonas Squeeze of Lime tortilla chips from Costco.

I had a busy day, so I cooked the chicken in the crock pot with chicken broth. When I got home, I shredded the chicken, and went ahead and finished the soup in the crockpot. This soup is sooooo good, it was worth the extra calories to fry the tortilla strips! I served it with shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this recipe using a good chicken stock from the grocery store. Again, the basic recipe is fabulous and we devoured it. I thank you for an excellent start!!

Thank You, Zeke, for sharing!  My husband and I love Tex Mex and we have been missing it ever since we left Texas.  This soup is just what we have been looking for.  I mixed things up bit by adding 1 can of corn, juice and all.  I also boosted all the seasoning, we like lots of seasoning, and added fresh chopped cilantro.  The end result was good enough to bring my husband back for 3rds and the neighbors over to see "what smelled so good".

Great Soup!!!  I added frozen corn and will probably add some black beans next time.  Over all, it has a wonderful flavor.  Can't eat just one bowl...  Thanks so much.

This tasted delicious.  I am sorry to say I did tweak it a bit based on some left over items I had from Super Bowl apps that I had in my fridge.  I don't like to waste items.  I halved the recipe to serve to my family of 5.  We served it with fish tacos.  Everyone had seconds and we had a serving left over. It makes a TON!  I used 1/2 a rotisserie chicken which saved on time.  I also only used one can of rotel (half recipe called for 1/2 can) that I blended up smooth.  I added a 1/2 can of corn and a 1/2 can of red enchilada sauce. I kept the spices the same but cut back on the oregano- my recipe stated 2 TBS.  After I put one in, it seemed like a lot so I added only another 1/2 TBS.  I think there was too much.  No one complained but I thought it was a bit much.  I didn't have celery so I added a tsp of celery salt.  My family gave it 5 stars.PS-  There is no way I am frying tortillas when I have chips at home.  LOL- crushed them for the top.

Everyone went back for seconds!  My husband looked at me after his first bite and said, "keeper".  Topped it with jack cheese,  cilantro, avocado, lime, and fried tortilla strips.  Did add a little frozen corn and omitted carrots, and oregano.

This was a great starter recipe to add to. Instead of the tomato/onion/garlic blend, I used one can of original Rotel /Garlic/Onion. We added one can of corn and one can of black beans as well as one full lime. We made half the recipe using only 6 cups of water and 3 veggie bouillon cubes (tons of sodium in these cubes) and it was TO DIE FOR!!!!

I made this soup and it was delicious.  I added corn and black beans and used 4 chicken breast halves instead of six.  It is awesome, I also used fresh cilantro instead of coriander and it it turned out great!  Thanks to Zeke!

didn't change a thing, and loved it. enough to feed an army, but i appreciate that since we often have large groups of people over. i used to live on mexican food, then moved to germany. you can guess how good the mexican food is over here. one of the things i missed the most was tortilla soup, and this turned out just as yummy as the kind i used to eat at my favorite mexican restaurant.

This is a great soup! I loved it! I made it as the recipe is. Next time I think I will make the tortilla strips shorter (easier for eating), but I wouldnt change anything else! Thanks Zeke!

My family LOVED this soup! My teenager helped make this one. Fairly simple and easy to follow recipe. We did use the full 1/4 cup of mexican oregano, and it was just right! I cut back on the water and chicken boullion cubes down to only 10 cups worth instead of the 15 as our stew pot was quite full already. We'll be able to have just enough leftovers tomorrow as it made about 8 servings this way. I only used about 16 of the corn tortillas. Since I had the oil hot, I served this with cinnamon crisps for a lightly sweet dessert (flour tortillas quartered, fried, drained, & sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar).

This is great: I added a can of hominy and 2 more cups of water (I like it soupy)Did it really call for 1/4 cup of oregano?Was that a typo? I used 1 tsp. Fabulous with the baked strips, the cheese and the avocado. Spicy: The Black pepper? Better than restaurants' for sure!! Makes me look like a great cook!!

My hubby and I make a huge batch of this soup at least twice a month. Its a good chinky soup and fills you up. We use the spicy Rotel diced tomatoes because we like it spicy, and we omit the celery and carrots, and instead add corn and hominy. It is so good, and it warms up a winter evening. We love this soup!!

This was a wonderful meal.  We made a few substitutions....we opted for fresh cilantro instead of the dried oregano and we added a can of black beans and a can of corn.  A word to the wise...go easy on the cilantro - otherwise that's all you will taste.  We froze our leftovers (since it makes a ton!) and it was even better the next day...and the day after.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...we loved it!

I can't beleive that I'm giving this only 2 stars when everyone else gave it 5. I'm wondering if something is wrong with my taste buds! I didn't particularly like this soup. I mean, it made enough for an army, so of course I will eat it (it's not that bad) but I don't know what everyone is raving about. I didn't expect a thick soup but it was too watery I thought. (I also added black beans and corn) The flavor was okay.  I would not make this again. I didn't add any tortilla strips as I was trying to save some calories, but I'm sure that with those, sour cream, cheese, cilantro, that this soup could taste better. Anyway, I was very disapointed.

This recipe was delicious!  It was really easy to scale down for 2 people (I thought we'd have leftovers, but it was that good!).  Baking the tortillas was really easy, too (I baked them at 425 for about 6 minutes, then kept a careful watch on them).  Adding sour cream was the perfect last touch!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this soup!  It was so good and light but yet packed full of flavor.  We even added a dollop of sour cream to ours for a creamier taste.  Absolutely delicious soup! Thanks Zeke for sharing it!

Excellent recipe! I tweaked it for our style and what we had on hand (homemade broth and the chicken used to make it). The only thing I will change for future batches will be to decrease the oregano significantly and probably use tortilla chips instead of making my own.

Very good start but I think tortilla soup should always be served with lime on the side. I served the soup by adding the dry ingredients to the bowls, the chicken, some extra tomatoes I set aside, the cheese, avocado, & tortilla strips. Then at the table I added the hot soup so it was as fresh as possible.

This turned out to be one of the best tortilla soups I have ever made.  I chopped the onion, celery and carrots very fine.  My husband, who doesn't eat any veggies, ate his whole bowl.  This one is a keeper for our family.

I followed the recipe to a T with one exception, I doubled the recipe for everything except the oregano, just couldn't see using 1/2 c of oregano.  I thought the 1/4 c would have been too much as well, was pleasantly surprised that it didn't overwhelm the dish.  My husband says, it's almost perfect... thought it needed about 3 tbls of tomatoe paste.  Still he immediatly had 3 bowls.

This was a great soup!  Tortilla soup is one of my favorites and this one did not disappoint.  For no specific reason, I did not add carrots and celery, but did add corn & black beans. I also cut back on the oregano, and added about a teaspoon of adobe sauce - added just enough spice and a smokey flavor.

I love tortilla soup. Especially the tortilla soup at Cheddars. This fails in comparison. I followed the directions exactly and just found this to be an average recipe. Sorry, but I won't be making this one again!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!
ZEKE...you ROCK!
I made the recipe for SIX.
My modifications:
I added one 14oz can of pinto beans, a whole chicken (skinned) instead of the chicken breasts only, an extra tspn of cumin, 2oz canned diced green chiles, and used the whole can of each: 14oz diced tomatoes and 14oz diced tomatoes with chiles (so as not to throw out the other half of the cans!)
Also, I cut the tortillas into strips, sprinkled them with taco seasoning and made them crispy with spray in a non-stick pan(WAY LOWER CALORIES THAN FRYING!!!).  
What a terrific soup!

if you are looking for a thick, dark tortilla soup, this is not it.  however, it is still very good!!!  i omitted the celery and added canned corn and a few handfuls of pasta.

Wow!!! The best tortilla soup I've ever tasted. Before, my husband and I would drive an hour to a cafe to eat their yummy tortilla soup but now I only drive three, to the grocery store, to buy the ingredients. Whenever I have friends over they request the soup. Thanks!

Really, really good soup.  I, too, added a can of corn and a can of black beans.  I accidentally added an extra can of tomatoes too.  Three stores later and no corn tortillas so I bought flour tortillas.  They MADE the soup.  We dolloped on sour cream and jack cheese.  It did make a lot but it was even better the next day.  Try it, you'll like it!

Ladies and Gentlemen...I have finally found my favorite soup!  DELICIOUS!  I only modified it a bit - like other's, I added a can of corn, but also threw in a can of spicy black beans.  Used one more clove of garlic and made chips out of the tortillas rather than strips.  I used all spices generously as I love my food spicy!  Perfect for a cool night, or a nice Spring day (such as my case), and even better the next day as leftovers.  I highly recommend this for soup lover's - thanks much, Zeke!

I have always loved El Torito's tortilla soup, until I tried Zeke's. Now it is the ONLY tortilla soup I eat. It is THE BEST !! So if you like eating at resturants dont try this, because once you try this, the rest is...well... sad.
thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

We LOVED it!.  I made it in my instant pot, putting it on soup setting using a whole chicken for 30 minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as directed.

My family loved it. Though I didn't use the right oregano at first and it did not taste right.  The oregano was too overpowering. So I had to take the oregano out. The oregano is not an ingredient you can substitute.

this was a great base for what i was looking for.. i admit to deviating quite a bit as i wanted this to be healthier, but i'm super impressed with the end result.. i cut the recipe in half and left out the fried tortillas all together, as well as the cheese and avocado toppings (it wasn't needed).. i subbed homemade chicken stock for the water/bouillon.. i boiled two bone in/skinless chicken thighs in the stock, having already added the spices to it (double the cumin and chili pepper and only 1/2 tsp oregano as my stock had oregano in it already).. i removed the thighs after 40 minutes, skimmed off the fat, and then added in the veggies.. i used one can total of plain diced tomatoes (drained) and added 2 jalapenos that i deseeded/deveined.. bumped the garlic up to 2 whole cloves.. i doubled the carrots and celery.. added a small bunch of broccoli and one zucchini and then shredded the chicken meat and added it back into the pot.. this came out heavenly.. a little bit of lime and some chopped cilantro took this over the top.. ty for the inspiration

Not the same soup I had in Mexico but equally excellent!  My husband rated it 10/10 which says a lot!  I cut up a rotisserie chicken into chunks which saved time and was cheaper than boneless, skinless chicken breasts and worked perfectly!  Couldn't find a can of tomatoes with chilies so used a can of both instead.  Definitely will be a family favorite!

I love this soup! I make quite a bit in the winter time.  Today I made it in my slow cooker.  I halved the recipe, as I always do, and just put the water, chicken, bouillon cubes, blended onion, tomato, garlic and spices into my crockpot and cooked it on high for about 4 hours.  Then I took out the chicken and shredded it and put the carrots and celery in along with some corn and black beans and cooked it for about another hour. my kiddos love this soup and I will keep making it :) thanks for sharing! Oh, I did have all the fixings but for the tortilla strips part I just buy a bag of chips :)

Boiled a whole chicken in enough water covering chicken about 3-4 inches. When done take out of broth. Add rest of ingredients to broth and cook till veggies are nearly done. Shred chicken and add to broth. May need extra broth and/or seasonings. Use your own taste buds. :) I call it veggie-chicken tortilla soup. This was delicious. My husband even liked it, and if he likes it it means it's really good. I put 3 different types of can beans. Didn't have enough of 1 kind. This recipe is easily adjusted so just adjust to your liking:). ENJOY, Thanks Zeke

Love this recipe, have tried in a crockpot as well.  Turns out great every time. My daughters always ask me to make it.  I do add black beans to it as well.  Usually we just crunch up some tortilla chips on the top.

This is our family's favorite recipe.  Anytime we go to a restaurant that has tortilla soup we order it, but it just doesnt compare to this recipe.  We add a can of black beans to it.

This recipe is just as good as the best tortilla soups I've had. And it's served just the way it should be, with avocado, tortilla strips and cheese.

My family and I thought this recipe was outstanding.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I made quite a few changes to it.  I pan cooked the chicken with salt and pepper while baking the oil brushed tortillas.  I replaced the carrots for 1 zucchini, yellow squash, and red bell pepper while also adding a can of black beans.  I also replaced the can of regular tomatoes with those including jalape√±os to spice it up a bit and only used 1/8 cup of oregano.  Topping it off with some fresh cilantro, the avocado, tortilla strips, and a pepper jack/cheddar cheese combination we only had a few servings left after feeding 5 people!

We didn't love this recipe.  I did use tortillas instead of tortilla chips, however.  Came out a little mushy.

Used this recipe as a base - added hominey(sp?) and cut back on all ingredients since I was making it for 2.  Overall a good recipe to tweak to satisfy your own taste.

This soup is great! I added a some kosher salt which brought up the flavor a bit. I also sauteed the onions and garlic in butter then added the blended can of diced tomatoes. I also cut back on the oregano as a previous reviewer suggested. And last, i sliced the carrots and celery into relatively large peices instead of chopping them.

All and all, it's a great recipe! The broth itself makes a great base to elaborate on and just add more veggies too or whatver your heart desires!

Excellent recipe.  I served this for my aunt and uncle.  My uncle has been bugging me for the recipe, glad that I found it again.

Next time will try corn and black beans, may be mighty tasty.

I have had this recipe with the author and it is amazing. Can be halved. Frying the strips makes this recipe 12pts on Weight Watchers, but if the strips are baked, it brings the points down to 8 per serving. Zeke, this is my most favorite of all soups in the world. You are an incredible cook!

This recipe it great! Use fresh cilantro instead of coriander. The spice combo it perfect! 15 cubes of buillon seems a little too much. Everyone loved it!
