This bread is delicious!!!! I was looking for a recipe that used bananas and canned pumpkin to get rid of some of my Thanksgiving over-stock. This was the perfect recipe! Changes I made: I used 3 bananas instead of 2, allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice and only 1 tsp of that, and I added a tsp. of vanilla. Also, only used 1/4 c. of oil. Baked in mini-muffin pans for about 20 min. Thanks for the great recipe/idea! I would have never put banana and pumpkin together but it works wonderfully in this bread! Also, used 1/2 cup light brown sugar in lieu of the honey.

I love this recipe! The changes I've made address the already noted difficulty with cooking time. I divide the recipe into 2- 4"x10" loaf pans and it  takes about 50 to 55 min. I have also added diced candied ginger and it complimented the banana and pumpkin beautifully.

This is a great bread, and easy to make, too. I can't praise it enough. I can taste the banana, pumpkin and honey in every bite. I put a lot of golden raisins in it and it is just the best quick bread I ever made/ate. 
It did need to bake longer than the recipe indicated - more like an hour rather than 45 minutes.

I have been  making this recipe for months now...a favorite!  Works with fresh OR canned pumpkin, though I throw in an bit more banana.  I also use whole wheat flour instead of white flour and it stays moist and lovely.  I have also made this as a straight banana bread, by replacing the pumpkin with more mashed banana- it makes the best banana bread I have ever had. Highly recommended for a healthy quick bread!

To get this bread to bake properly, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake for about 90 minutes.  Low and slow is the way to go for ALL quick breads!  Other reviewers who complain about the outside being black and the inside being doughy are adjusting the wrong way.  Turn that oven down!  I made this bread according to the recipe, omitting the raisins, and adjusted the oven temp and cook time as I have stated.  I'm enjoying a perfectly baked slice now!  I prefer quick bread recipes that contain sour cream or buttermilk, but this is a very nice loaf.  I have never seen honey used in a quick bread before.  Four stars from me!

The bread had a nice flavor, but turned out uncooked and gooey, even though I baked it for way longer than the 45 minutes.  Because of the nice flavor, I think the bread has potential.   I will try the recipe again, but with a higher cooking temperature.  I'll let you all know how it turns out.
Addendum:  I baked the bread at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and lowered the temperature to 350 degrees for the remaining 30 minutes.  The bread did cook, but was a bit dark on the outside.  It tasted pretty good on the inside though.  I think the trick here is to only fill the pan about 1/3 full.  It might bake up nicely at the 350 degree temperature in the original recipie if the amount to be baked is not too dense.

I really liked this bread but banana and pumpkin are both very strong flavors. Mixed together, they kind of cancelled each other out and I couldn't taste a lot of either. I would use either all bananas or all pumpkin in this recipe. I made it lighter by replacing the oil with the same amount of applesauce and using half real sugar and half Splenda sugar substitute. Also, I baked the bread for 60 mins and it wasn't done. I recommend at least 70 mins because mine fell and was heavier because it wasn't all the way done.

I loved this recipe!! I would not consider it low fat though at 7 Grams per serving (1/12th of recipe).  I substituted 3/4 cup of oatmeal for 3/4 cups of the flour.  I also felt I needed to bake it for more like an hour rather than 45 minutes.  Taste got high ratings at my house!!

The oven temperature setting +/or the cooking time for this recipe isn't right!  Like many of the other reviews have stated it just doesn't get cooked all the way through.

Well, I was pretty disappointed in this one.  The banana flavor was completely lost and like others, I had the problem of it not cooking completely even though I left it in for an extra 20 minutes.  The outside was turning black so I had to take it out.  The flavor was okay but between what was not cooked on the inside and what was burnt on the outside, there wasn't much to eat.  Maybe muffins would be the way to go.

I have to agree with so many of the other reviews... I baked this for over 1 hour & it still was not done inthe middle.  Completely unedible and I will not make this again.

Outstanding "bread" or perhaps better put, "cake." I followed the advice of a few others and cooked this as a cake in a Bundt pan. Then I made a vanilla glaze. I had a little icing left over from an Italian Cream Cake and mixed it into the vanilla glaze and it was fantastic.
The bananas and pumpkin flavors blended well. I did use 4 medium bananas and 1 can of pumpkin. Had no pie spice so used cinnamon, ginger, and all spice.

Fantastic recipe!  This is a keeper in our house.  I made the following changes to make it a little more healthy, but just as delicious:  2cups white flour, 1/4cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 wheat germ (instead of 2.5c white flour). Each time I make it, I reduce the white flour and increase the whole wheat, so I may update this again.  To cut down on fat, I filled the 1/3c measure halfway with applesauce, and then filled it up with oil. Also, I mixed the raisins in with the dry ingredients first. This prevents them from clumping together, and reduces your mixing time which helps keep the mix moist and tender.  Finally, I made this mix into muffins, baking at 350 for about 20 min (or until the tops spring back when you touch them).  Delicious!!

This turned out great. After reading other reviews, I felt comfortable to experiement with the recipe a litle. Sinice I don't have a 9x5 inch pan, I made this into a bundt cake, and baked it for about 55 minutes to an hour.  I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips instead of raisins and followed another review's advice and used 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger instead of pumpkin pie spice.  I added a smidge extra of pumpkin, and i felt it could of used even more.  Oh, and I used apple sauce instead of oil which didn't seem to make a difference taste wise.  Finially, since it was a cake, I whipped up a quick sugar glaze with powdered sugar, vanilla, milk, and butter which turned out great.  This is an easy, delicious recipe.

Very moist and delicious, specially made with 3/4 walnuts plus 3/4 craisins (dried cranberries) - I used craisins in place of the raisins. It takes approximately 1:30 hours to bake. Keeps well in the refrigerator.

Very good!  As other reviewers did, I substituted apple sauce for oil, and used 1/4 cup flax seed meal, 1/4 wheat bran, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup while flour for the 2 1/2 cups of plain flour.  Also used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I topped a few with coconut flakes before baking and would recommend adding coconut to the recipe next time.  They were a little bit dry as muffins for me, but I wasn't sure how long to bake at 350, so I may have kept them in too long. Usually subbing all the fiber for flour means a little longer in the oven, but I don't think these needed it.  My 4 year old son and my husband both liked them a lot.  Better than traditional banana bread and it has lots of potential for adding other ingredients that go well with pumkin - sunflower seeds, nuts, coconut, white chocolate chips, craisins, etc.

Holy MOLY! What an AMAZING recipe! The aroma was so strong, it made my whole apartment smell of pumpkin. YUMMY! Two things... it's not much of a bread, it has the texture of a muffin, and the flavor of a cake. Very sweet (and I LOVE sweet!). Second... if you don't have pumpkin spice, add 1 teaspoon of Nutmeg, and half a teaspoon of Ginger... UNBELIEVEABLE!

this made 4 very nice large perfectly mounded mini loaves.  1 c. whole wheat subbed for part of the flour, omitted the raisins, and added 1 tsp. Mexican vanilla.  This is a very thick batter; the thickest quick bread batter I can remember but it is perfect.  Both bananas were black-skinned.  This is very moist with the small amt. of oil used.  The spices were perfect.  I love the way this presents out of the oven; pehaps because the batter is so thick.  It rises very high.  thanks for this nice recipe as a different way to use up those black bananas.  My oven baked these 4 loaves in 48 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very doughy and wet.  Even after baking it longer, it never dried up any.  Don't know what happened...

If you prepare this recipe as directed it will not cook through.  I doubled the cooking time to 90 min and it was finally done.  It is wrong to rate this five stars and change the recipe because some folks (me) will prepare it without reading the reviews.

I did the same as some of the others, by adding Allspice as well as Pumpkin pie spice and more sweetener (White Karo). Regarding the baking issue, I split the batter into 2 pans, baked it at 350 for the 45 minutes and had no problem. This bread did come out very good!

Followed recipe pretty closely but made these changes:  substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour, used 1/4 cup brown sugar for the white and because I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp of cloves and nutmeg and omitted addition cinnamon.  This recipe makes 18 muffins cooked for 18 minutes.

This bread was really great!  As per other reviews I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used a spice mix (ginger/cloves/nutmeg) but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did add pecans instead of walnuts but that's my flavor preference.  I made a smaller (4x6) loaf and 12 mini-muffins and I really love the flavor!  Yes, it's mild, but that's how pumpkin tastes.  I'm going to stock up on pumpkin so I'll have it around next time my bananas start going brown - much better than plain old banana bread!

To use up available ingredients, we used pureed winter squash, brown sugar only, thawed frozen bananas, and raisins.  We doubled the recipe and used a large flat baking dish, and this bread came out perfect!  I used the convection oven at 350, and it baked up dark, but not burned at all.

excellent recipe.  instead of using sugar, I used applesauce (by grating 1 apple with my pampered chef Micro Grater - it made the apple into instant applesauce - peel and all, it's fantastic).  The recipe turned out perfect - the kids even loved it - that speaks volumes.

Yummy!  Followed the recipe exactly except added full 15 oz can of pumpkin (about the same) and about 1 c of chocolate chips instead of raisins/walnuts.  Baked in mini muffin tins for 18 to 20 minutes.  Great recipe!  Who knew banana and pumpkin went together so well!

Very good! Very moist, loved the flavors. Made in a bundt pan. Great way to use up that large can of pumpkin that you opened and stored the leftover in the fridge...and those almost "in the garbage" banannas. Nice. Will make again. My kids loved it!

It's the first "sweater" day of the season.I'm curled up knitting,the smell of pumpkin and spices wafting thru my home.If the smile on my Husbands face is any indication,this recipe is awsome.I used nuts AND raisins,3 banannas,allspice for the pumpkin pie spice and 1/4c oil.Mine baked up perfectly in 45min,I also made a vanilla glaze to drizzle on top-YUM!!

This bread came out perfect!  I cut the recipe in half and baked in a jumbo muffin pan.  I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the total flour and added chocolate chips.  I do muffins because it is just me.  I wrap each one in foil then put all of them in a zip lock freezer bag and pop them in the freezer.  That way, when I want a muffin, I can take out just on.  Sit it on the counter and it is ready to eat in about 10 minutes.  Keeps me from over indulging in yummy muffins!!!

I agree with the other reviews - the bread was great but took much longer to cook than advertised.  I probably cooked my bread about 1 1/2 hours before I was able to put in a cake tester and it came out clean.

Delicious and moist! I followed the recipe exactly but had to add 10 minutes to the cooking time and it was perfectly done. I did use walnuts but omitted the raisins out of personal preference.

Took over an hour to cook and was still not fully done.  Perhaps because I used a glass bread pan.  In any event, gooey, disappointing and won't make again.

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic I used fresh pumpkin and added walnuts and frosted it with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled crushed walnuts on top of that and my hubby loved it.  I was able to get to small loafs and one large loaf of bread out of this recipe.  I will be making more of this tomorrow as I still have lots of fresh pumpkin to use up.  Thank you for sharing your great recipe.

Great!  I modified it to make it lower in Weight Watcher points.  I left out the oil and instead added one egg yolk.  I substituted the honey for brown sugar.  Then, I baked in muffin tins for about 18 mins at 350.  It made 24 muffins at 2 points each!  I put them in the freezer to have a yummy and healthy snack on hand.  Just microwave for 15-20 seconds.

I took these to work and everybody loved themI added 2 t. of vanilla extract, 2 t. of cinnamon instead of one, 1/2 c of walnuts and omited the raisins. It was funny though, some of us tasted more pumkin and others tasted more banana. Either way, they were great. I did muffins.

Wow!!!  I was looking for something to use up some canned pumpkin, and this recipe fit the bill.  However, I did revamp it to create some healthy muffins.  I made some big changes, but these turned out AMAZING, and surprisingly light!  I will be making these again and again!

Changes I made to make these healthy muffins:

- 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the vegetable oil
- Sweetener in place of the 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour, 3/4 cup oats, and 1/4 cup wheat bran in place of the 2 1/2 cups white flour
- 1/4 cup flax seed meal
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder instead of 1 tsp

I ended up with 20 muffins filled 3/4 full.  Baked at around 300F (my oven cooks hot).  I am not sure how long they were in, but I believe they took about 30 minutes.  

A must try!  Delicious!

Delish. Excellent. OK, I read all the comments about the cooking time, so I cut the pumpkin to 1 cup. Used 1 banana. 1/2 cup apple sauce (no oil), 3/4 cup brown sugar (no honey or white sugar) and no raisins but I did use chopped walnuts. This is delicious; who doesn't have an old banana around, and I've had fresh pumpkin in the freezer since last October. Great recipe! Oh, 50 minutes is fine for a 6x9 pan this way, plus 6 muffins (25 min).

LOVED this recipe! I will definitely be making this again and again. The bread is moist and dense with a great flavor. I did make some adjustments. I used brown sugar instead of honey, a dash of nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice, 3 bananas instead of 2, applesauce instead of oil, and whole wheat flour. So that is a number of changes, but it came out great. Just bake for about one hour at 350.

For those of you having difficulty with the cooking time, I made this recipe for muffins instead of bread and it came out okay -- they were REALLY dense, but they tasted good.  I baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes and I turned the pan halfway through the baking time so that the browned evenly.  I got 20 regular sized muffins out of the recipe.  I did cut the flour by a half cup and replaced it with rolled oats, and I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  And I added candied ginger instead of raisins.  Decent recipe but I'm not sure I'll return to it.

This bread is excellent, I used applesauce instead of oil and chocolate chips instead of raisins. I used 2 1/2 bananas (my son ate the other 1/2) and a little over 1/2 of a big can of pumpkin puree. I didn't measure.  Half the batter went into a loaf pan and the other half went into a muffin tin. the muffins were done in about 20 minutes, and the bread took close to an hour. It was so delicious and moist. I'm making more tonight, thank you!!

I substituted liquid eggs for real, used splenda for the sugar and omitted nuts and raisins. Recipe was pretty easy and it tastes oooh so good. Next time I will use that many reviewers have done...used applesauce for the oil.

I think the banana pumpkin combo is great!  I use homemade pumpkin puree.  From what I can tell, the only bad thing about this recipe is the 9X5 pan and the cooking time.  As suggested by others, I divided the batter between two slightly smaller pans, and I have also used 4 mini loaf pans--both times baked for about 55 minutes.  Perfect--no goo in the middle.

I used butter in place of the oil, omitted the raisins and only used the pumpkin pie spice, as I didn't want the bread to be overpowering with spice. This recipe made two medium sized loaves. These turned out moist and fluffy.

My kids LOVED this bread.  I did add a little extra banana and a little bit of vanilla.  With that, it did make a large loaf that took very long to bake, so next time I'd put it into 2 pans.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/2 t. more cinnamon, 1/8 t. clove, 1/8 t. ground ginger and 1/2 t. allspice (or nutmeg if you'd prefer).  This disappears within 2 mornings of baking it.   The kids had fun making it too!  Great recipe!

Loved the flavor but I must have done something wrong when I baked it. I subsituted applesauce for the oil (and have never really had a problem with this before). I baked it for the right amount of time plus 15 mins and it still was not done in the middle (the edges were yummy though!). My daughter loved it. I will try it again with the oil next time.

Agree w/ those who say double the spices. If you don't  have pumpkin pie spice (I don't), mix your own with 4 parts cinnamon, one part each of ginger, allspice and ground cloves, and 1/2 part nutmeg.

Good recipe which can be easily  adapted.  I added extra pumpkin, cut the sugar in half, and used half whole wheat flour.  I also cut the oil in half and added applesauce.  Rather than adding walnuts to the batter, I sprinkled them on top along with a powdered sugar glaze.  Very tasty!

I give this recipe 5 stars.  I used 1 c. white flour and 1 ½ c. whole wheat flour which resulted in a nice consistency.  I was low on honey and used a combination of honey, brown sugar, and white sugar.  I changed the spices to 1 t. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 t. allspice, 1/2 t. cloves, and 1 t. cinnamon.  I baked in a muffin pan at 350 degrees for around 25 minutes.  Delicious and nutritious!

Absolutely love the taste of the bread! I combined some past reviews however and maybe should have only took one reviewer's advice. I used 3 bananas total and 14 oz. of the pumpkin. I also used the applesauce vs. the oil. I ended up cooking for about 90 minutes and the middle was still ridiculously moist. Not sure if it didn't cook all the way through, or if it just became that moist due to my additions. I did add a half cup more flour assuming it would help compensate for my additions - not exactly the case (I used wheat and all-purpose.)  My boyfriend and I are still eating it however! : ) Tastes great...I just am going to take it easy on the additions next time.

Moist and yummy. Used 3 bananas and half a cup more pumpkin puree. Didn't have honey and substituted with half a stick of melted butter. Kept sugar at half cup but added semisweet chocolate chips which made up in sweetness. Used a bundt pan, and the bread turned out perfectly golden brown and moist. Baked for about 40 minutes. Tastes even better when served with dark chocolate drizzle.

Excellent Bread.  Like other reviewers, I added an extra banana, used 1c. whole wheat flour, and substituted brown sugar for the honey.  I made muffins with this recipe and they were very moist!

Followed JIVE TURKEY's recommendation and split the batter into two loaf pans (plenty of batter for each). Turned the temp up to 375 instead of 350. They both cooked perfectly in 47 minutes.

I was looking for a guilt free vehicle to put cream cheese on and this is it.  I did change the recipe slightly ... substituting unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and using only the honey to sweeten the bread (no white sugar).  I was a little bit worried but the bread is absolutely wonderful ... doesn't even need the cream cheese!  Based off of previous reviews I used half the batter to make a small loaf and the other half I used for muffins.  Everything cooked up just fine in 45 minutes.

My officemates loved this recipe. I had some leftover batter and made muffins, which I baked for a shorter time. I also exchanged some of the white flour for whole wheat and corn flour to give it a bit more fiber.

P.S. after reading other reviews, I put about 3/4 of the batter into the bread pan and made the rest into about 6 muffins. This way the bread cooked all the way through and didn't take too long.

I made this recipe using a cake pan since I didn't have a loaf pan.  It worked fast and great!  I used xylitol (natural sugar alcohol with a GI of 8) in place of the sugar, only 1/3 c honey, and whole wheat pastry flour.  I also squeezed in a clementine orange, since we had these on hand.  It was absolutely delicious!

oh heavens is this good ! I used a miniature loaf pan that turns out 8 small bread loaves and cooking for 25 min made them just perfect ! I also baked a full loaf for the time specified in the reciped and it also turned out lovely. These little darlings will go in all my Xmas presents this year. For now they are snuggled up in my freezer while i enjoy the smells of the season the bread left in my house. I added a touch of Ground Cloves and instead of nutz i put in orange flavoured Craisins. HOORAY !!!

Seems like there is just that over the top thing missing (could be the rasins? nuts?) Made about 20 regular size muffins, they were still really good. My 2 year old loves them.

Awesome! I did make a few changes though. I thought that the pumpkin to banana ratio was a little unbalanced so I used 3 bananas instead of 2. I also added 1 tbsp. of vanilla extract and I used a half cup of chocolate chips instead of raisins. Yum!

This was a very tasty breakfast for our family! Next time I will follow other reviewers' suggestions and split it into two pans - We cooked it for 55 minutes and it was still a little doughy in the middle. Still very delicious, so it will be a keeper!

wonderful!  moist, really good flavor, I will definitely make this again and again.

I added 1/2 cup of wheat germ in place of 1/2 cup of flour -- I also split the recipe into two small loaf pans.  otherwise I followed the directions to the letter.  yum!

I substituted apple sauce for the oil and it was very good.  The only thing I would change would be to add more bananas to the recipe.  I got a lot of pumpkin flavor but had trouble detecting the bananas.

This recipe is great and it made the apt smell so good. I used an extra banana and craisins and made it in mini loave pans.  35 minutes worked great for the mini-loaves! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

I really like this recipe.  It is my most frequently requested quick bread (without the raisins). I also play with the flour, using half whole wheat and sometimes a 1/4 cup wheat germ.  Great especially for giving your kitchen that perfect fall smell as it bakes.  A great moist on-the-go breakfast.  Also have taken half slices and spread a soft cream cheese frosting to make "cookie sandwiches" as a special treat.  The only thing is that it takes about 60 minutes to bake in my oven.  Otherwise, it is terrific.

Best pumpkin bread ever! Excellent recipe ---Everyone loved this. Sweet but not overpowering. I substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour for 1/2 the white flour. Added dates instead of raisins; they really gave it some kick.

Great recipe! I used the unsweetened pumpkin pulp and over-ripe bananas from my freezer. I didn't have all the spices called for, so I used only cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, adjusting the amounts to make up the total amount called for. I took them over to my my son's house for the children's 'before school' breakfast, and saved one back to go into a school lunch the next day.

This recipe is fantastic! It took an electric beater to get everything smooth, but it was worth the effort. Also, a full 60 minutes was needed  in my oven, but the bread was still moist and absolutely DELICIOUS!

Probably the best thing I've ever made. The  recipe is flawed with the 45 minutes cooking time.  When I took it out after 45 minutes it was definitely still very much wet so I turned down my oven to 325° and cooked it for an additional 25 minutes carefully rotating it so my top doesn't burn. But I use the recipe exactly to the tee.  Including the 9 x 5 Loaf pan.  This is a dense recipe so I cooled it overnight before removing it from the pan.(I made this late night)  The next morning it was perfect. I topped it with walnuts before baking  as suggested without raisins. Next time, I will throw in chocolate chips and maybe pecans. Absolutely deeelish!

This was really yummy, however I don't think the recipe calls for enough pumpkin spice... Next time I will definitely add more.

Delicious !  The perfect combination of pumpkin and bananas. I hadn't thought of mixing those in a bread . I find the flavor of pumpkin overwhelming in pumpkin bread so don't make it often. The bananas mellow that out and  add a fragrant taste .  Instead of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil (from Costco) and 1/2 the flour was whole wheat which did not make the bread heavy.  1/4 cup of chocolate chips for grandkids appeal.  Freezes well so I will keep one  for drop-in visitors.

This bread is really good...for the sake of taste and health I replace the white sugar with 1/4 cup molasses...for the sweet tooth(s) in the family I sometimes add chocolate chips or pecans or both...the molasses makes the bread lovely and moist.

This bread is a delicious and hearty busy morning treat! I made a few adjustments to up the health factor. I subbed brown sugar for white, and used 1 cup whole wheat, 1 1/2 cups white flour. I also added a third banana to keep it extra moist. My family loves it...didn't last a day! Leave extra cooking time though. It took mine over an hour.

Made two loaves and cooked for 40 min.  Used three bananas and the whole can of pumpkin (cause what do you do with the little left over).  Ended up with 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup almond meal because I didn't have enough regular flour. Used a little less than 1/2 cup honey. It turned out very moist and we couldn't stop eating it!  Might try and use a little less sugar/honey next time just cause I don't like things that are too sweet.

This bread is really moist, the pumpkin and banana really compliment each other.  I was a little skeptical of the two, but it is delicious!  And not overly sweet.

Excellent basic recipe that I modified based on other reviews.  Here's my version: had only one can of pumpkin, so added 1/3 c. Greek style vanilla yogurt; used brown sugar instead of honey; used slightly less than 1/2 c white sugar and added 1 T maple syrup; for flour, used: 1 c all-purpose flour, 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 c. oats, 1/4 c. wheat germ; added 1/2 t. allspice; used craisins instead of raisins; included walnuts. (all other ingredients were same as original recipe) Made 12 muffins (20 min) and 24 mini-muffins (13 min). Turned out perfectly!  Think I'll add diced apple next time... Yum!  Thanks to the original submitter and all the reviewers!

This recipe needs some work. The baking time/temp for a loaf of bread is not right. I ended up leaving it in a lot longer than 45 minutes, until the top began to turn black, but the center was still not cooked. Because the bread puffed up so much above the pan, I sliced off the blackened top to level with the pan, and put it back in. It finally cooked all the way through, and it had a pretty good taste, although I might adjust some of the spices next time.

This is the best pumpkin bread I have tried yet!  It is so moist and flavorful.  Even my husband, who doesn't care for pumpkin, raved about it.  Unfortunately, I am a health nut  so I don't let myself splurge often on this recipe.  I will be playing with it to make it a little healthier.

verdict is still out since it's in the oven. I thought 1 cup of sweetener was excessive w/ all that ripe banana, so I did 1/4 cup honey (and 1/2 cup is expensive!) and 1/4 cup raw sugar. Used 1 C oats, 1 1/4 C spelt flour instead of white flour. Used half the oil and coconut oil instead of toxic vegetable oil, and threw in a couple spoonfuls of homemade pear/applesauce as well. Used cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg. I went for the two-short-loaves method- they looked pretty wimpy batter wise, but didn't want to risk 1 1/2 hours and a burnt top/gooey center! So I'm watching them closely, going to start checking at 35 minutes. (oh, and 325) Can't wait for breakfast!

Delicious! My husband cannot stop talking about how delicious the bread is. I substituted brown sugar for the white and used mostly whole wheat flour.  I made a double batch and cooked both in the oven for 1 hour and 5 minutes.  They are perfect and moist and the pumpkin and banana really blend well.  Just fyi, i would consider this much more pumpkiny than bananay.

Texture anad appearance are beautiful but even after doubling the bananas I found the flavor lacking. I added a bit of cardamom which brings a nice element to the recipe but I'll continue to tweak this to improve the flavor. Makes amazing mini-muffins (bake at 350 for approx. 12 minutes). I did increase the baking powder slightly as well. I've found that it helps make a lighter and fluffier muffin as opposed to the usually dense and heavy texture of pumpkin and/or banana breads.

I like this a lot more than plain banana bread. But, I thought it had a little too much cinnamon in it, considering it's in the pumpkin pie spice and as a separate ingredient. I'll just stick to the pumpkin pie spice next time, and not worry about the extra cinnamon. I also forgot the raisins, but I liked it without.

I have made dozens of recipes from this site and i had to create a membership just so i could review this one.  This recipe is goooood.  I didnt have pumpkin pie spice so i doubled the cinnamon and added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a sprinkle of ginger.  No raisins or nuts per preference.  Of note, i have made this as a loaf and as mini muffins.  The loaf was a flop as it was mushy on the inside and dry on the outside.  The mini muffins were amazing.  If you half the recipe, it makes 24 fluffy mini muffins.  Cook at 350 for about 12 minutes.  You can even be lazy with this recipe and use self-rising flour and stir all ingredients at once with a wisk (no need to get out mixer) and it is still delicious and fluffy.

I did alter the recipe a bit but it turned out FANTASTIC!!! I made jumbo muffins stuffed with cream cheese.  I swear...I will never eat another store bought muffin again!  Changes I made were: applesauce for oil, half honey half maple syrup (I ran out), didn't have pumpkin pie spice so used allspice, nutmeg and cloves and used 1/2 c. oats for the flour.  Sooo good and will definitely make again.  **also these do not need a paper cup as it will stick...just grease the muffin pan**

LOVE the flavor combo of pumpkin & banana! I lightened things up but using egg beaters, baking Splenda, agave necture instead of honey, extra pumpkin puree in place of oil and replaced 2/3 of the flour with whole wheat. I've been experimenting with different pumpkin bread recipes on this site and this one is by far my fav.

After cooking for well over 1hr 20 minutes at 350 degrees, the outside was hard and nearly burnt and the inside was still undercooked!

Oops - I forgot the cinnamon! Oh well. I took the advice here and changed honey for brown sugar, used 1 c whole wheat flour for some of the white flour, only 1/4 c of oil, and added 1 t of vanilla. I also added 1/4 c of pecans and 1/4 c of chocolate chips.  I put it into 2 loaf pans and am starting with 20 min for baking. We'll see!

Don't give up on this recipe because of the cooking time- a few tips:  Sift your flour into the measuring cup, or fluff with a fork.  Too much and it will be too dense and not cook through.  Raise the temp to 365 for the after the first half hour for about 15 minutes, then back to 350 for the last 15 minutes- mine had a lovely crown.  I use self-rising flour in bread recipes- omit the leavening and salt.  It makes a much less gummy batter.  As far as flavor, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1tsp. each clove and nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  I also added 1tsp. orange extract- it brings out the banana.  It makes a very nice loaf, and is a great, not overly sweet basic recipe.

Fantastic flavour, holds up really well with slicing and leaving it out for a few days, and tastes best with a little honey spead on it!!  Had to bake mine for ten minutes more than the recommended so definitely test to make sure it's done!

I made this yesterday and wondered what I did to ruin it.  I'm glad I read the reviews today and found I'm not alone  - it took an hour and a half (!) to bake and it still wasn't done (I gave up after that).  The pumpkin/banana combo seems to cancel each other out, so it's not very flavorful; it's also very "heavy".  I'm disappointed  - it sounds really good and was easy to prepare, until I had to check it every 5 minutes for an additional 45 mins. beyond  the recommended cook time.

This is a greeeaaaat recipe!!  Like another reviewer, I made this into muffins and they were so moist and tasty.  I added the vanilla as suggested as well.  The recipe makes about 16 generous sized muffins.  It is great for using up the extra pumpkin in the can after Thanksgiving.  Thank you!

This was a major hit. I pureed a fresh roasted pumpkin and used it instead of the canned. And pureed the banana along with the pumpkin. Family loved it and insisted it show up again. So I am making it for the second time in 4 days... definitely needs the raisins!

Oh my! If I had to rate how yummy my home smelled with the pumpkin and cinnamon that wafted throughout the house I would give it 10 stars!!! This is delicious! I don't know why I can't resist a pat of butter melting into the first cut piece with steam still filling the air as if I needed to add any more flavor...This would be good with a dollop of homemade whip cream too! Hey, it's October and my quaint New England town of Gilford NH is dotted with scarecrows and pumpkins growing in the fields right in front of me. Ya gotta make a few pumpkin theme foods! Friday I made the Pumpkin Turkey Chili and I had left over Pumpkin so I had to do something with it... This hit the spot! Thanks for a great Autumn recipe! Gets you in the mood that's for sure!

I thought this was lacking something.  It could have had a little more zing to it for all the effort of making it.  It makes alot for one loaf.  It would have been better as one loaf and a little something else because it took much longer than the required time to cook.  I used craisins instead of the raisins and wish I added nuts too.

Very good, I substitute applesauce for the oil and reduce the sugar & honey since I add chocolate chips and make as mini muffins.  Perfect bite size treat.  Also it has been mentioned that the banana doesn't add anything but it does.  You may not taste the banana flavor but I tried without banana and it was not as good.  I make these at least a few times a month.

I used applesauce and only 1 T. oil, to make it healthier.  I also included some ground flax seed.  My daughter likes chocolate chips, so we put some of the batter in a smaller pan with some chocolate chips and it was yummy too.

This bread did not set at all. I baked it for almost 3 hours and it was still mushy. It only gets 1 star because it smelled good while it was baking.  It was hard as a rock after it cooled!

This was incredibly well received by my family, and they are definitely not always keen on "healthier" snacks. 

After reading several of the reviews, I made a number of adjustments: I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and a whole can of pumpkin (~14 oz); I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and upped the flour to 3 cups (half whole wheat, half all-purpose); I didn't have enough honey, so I made up the difference with real maple syrup (though I'll probably go with all honey next time). 

I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted with 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger as suggested by another reviewer. The flavor was a hair strong for my taste, though, so I think I'll probably reduce both a bit on the next go. I'm not a big fan of raisins and I don't use nuts because of my toddler, so I added about a cup of chocolate chips (half milk chocolate, half semi-sweet chocolate). 

Because of the extra stuff, there was too much for a single loaf pan, so I split the batter between two pans. Don't be afraid to bake it longer than the indicated time; a nice browned (not burnt, obviously) exterior pairs so nicely with the moist interior.

I will certainly make this again!

BLAH...this was very bland. I didn't really have a problem with the cooking time like the other reviewers, but it was not a very good tasting recipe.  The banana and the pumpkin do seem to cancel each other out.  Not even 14 of the loaf got eaten.

This is great! What a combination of flavor. The only problem I had was there was too much batter for the loaf pan and it overflowed into my oven. It was worth it in my opinion.

I've prepared this recipe twice now for my family and everyone just loved it! My toddler can't get enough of it... It's not too sweet and the consistency is just right for little hands to handle. My pre-teen also likes it a lot. This bread is now a regular staple at my home.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I took the advice of earlier reviews and halved the pumpkin pie spice. I also made muffins instead of a loaf, so the baking time was must faster. To reduce fat even further, I substituted applesauce for for the oil, and everything turned out perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is really good. I made it with chocolate chips instead of raisins and omitted the walnuts. I would also use 1/2 as much pumpkin pie spice.

This is a VERY moist bread and it was nice not to throw out my jack-o-lantern and to use the bananas in my freezer. The kids liked it a lot. It was delicious. It needed a full half-hour added to the cooking time. Try it!

READ BEFORE MAKING THIS!  I guess I should make a practice of reading reviews before I try a recipe because something was very wrong here.  It smelled heavenly, looked beautiful and the toothpick came out clean after 45 minutes, but when I turned it out of the loaf pan, it landed with a splat.  The ends, top and bottom were done but the middle was gooey and uncooked.   I suppose the nicely cooked top cleaned the toothpick on the way out.  I felt a little better after reading that other bakers had a similar experience after adding another 20 minutes to the cook time, but it's always a bummer when something is a complete fail.

I wish I read the reviews instead of just looking at the stars. The darn thing just won’t cook in the middle. It has now been 55 minutes and it’s so dark. I want to go to bed but waiting for it. I might just call it quits.

HORRIBLE RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS! Cooking time for this recipe is nowhere near correct! 45 minutes at 350° in a 9x5 pan... not even close. it was still totally raw in the middle. The top appeared done, so I took it out. Toothpick was clean (as the loaf was large so I couldn't insert the toothpick even halfway down). Let it rest for 10 mins and attempted to lift it from the pan with the parchment paper that I lined it with. the whole middle was wet. I put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes and it STILL wasn't done. I had to taje it out anyway because the top was starting to burn, not to mention the loaf fell flat because I took it out at the state 45 minutes mark. NEVER using this recipe again.

I read through the reviews and made a couple of tweaks to the recipe based on the reviews.  I ended up making 24 regular sized muffins with this recipe.  I used 3 bananas instead of 2, 1/4 cup of oil instead 1/3, 2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of rolled oats (oatmeal) instead of all flour, 2tsp total of ground cinnamon instead of the pumpkin spice, and 1 cup of chopped apples.  The muffins are moist and delicious.  You can't really taste the pumpkin, it tastes more like cinnamon apple/banana bread, but I really added in the pumpkin for extra nutrition for my kids, so that's ok with me!  Enjoy!

Tasty! I altered the recipe on a few accounts: Used 1/2 cup almonds instead of walnuts, and added 1 teaspoon almond extract. I have no pumpkin spice, so instead I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon anise seed and used butter instead of oil. Was going for making a brownie-like pumpkin-banana bread, used a 13"x9" pan instead of a bread tin and it worked perfectly! Cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. Also used fresh pumpkin from this year's Halloween Jack-O-Lantern plus two spotted-brown very-ripe bananas. So delicious! Going to freeze what I'm not eating today so I can enjoy it longer. :3

Delicious! Used maple syrup in place of honey and melted butter in place of oil ( only because I'd didn't have the other ingredients) baked in 2 loaf pans instead of 1 at 350 for 50 minutes. Loaves turned out perfect. Nice and most and full of flavour.

This is a great base recipe. I doubled it without any issues. And like many, I cut the fat--or oil in this case--and swapped in sour cream. I was heavy-handed with the spice--I love me a little fall spicy goodness, and used crasins and walnuts. I used an instant read thermometer to make sure the loaves were done. 210 degrees--It took about an hour and ten minutes. I brought 2 loaves to work and they were gone by 9:07.  big hit.

Added vanilla - nice addition. After reading the reviews, I made muffins instead of a loaf. Cooked at 350 for about 20 minutes - perfect.  Added a little extra pumpkin just to finish the can. Subbed in unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the oil. Next time I will try subbing in applesauce for all of the oil. Subbed brown sugar for the white and used less than recipe called for. Delicious recipe! Nice crumb. And it was perfect to use as a cooking lesson for my ten year old.

Great recipe and yes it is healthy and yes I did make some changes!  For the flour, I used half white flour and half almond flour for baking.  I substituted all of the oil for equal parts applesauce.  I added the whole can of pumpkin which is a little more than the 1 1/3 cups it calls for.  I added half of the white sugar it called for and the other portion of sugar I used brown sugar.   I also threw in a scoop of vanilla vegan protein powder.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and omitted the raisins (kids don't like them)  Its not overly sweet which is good!  Also, I reduced the temp to 325 and the batter made a loaf pan and 5 muffins - I only added 2/3 batter to the loaf pan because I knew it would rise - the muffins were done in 25 minutes and the loaf pan needed more time - about 60 minutes - I would only do muffins next time.  This will be great for breakfast!

very good bread! I made a few minor adjustments. Used 3+ ripe bananas (not 2), used a bit less honey, 1/4c. sugar (less), and added chocolate chips (because my boys like those most!). I did need to bake this about 70-75 minutes (vs. the mentioned 45 min), as it was gooey inside  still. I covered with foil towards the end, and it never got too brown or black on top - it was perfect, Very moist, not too sweet, just delicious!

This bread was surprisingly good.  I'm not a fan of banana bread but the banana is not so over powering with the pumpkin.  I made several changes though.  I put 3 bananas, 1 can pumpkin, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 c oil, 4 eggs, 1- 1/2 tsp salt, 2 cups sugar,  2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp ginger, 1/2 cup wheat flour, 3 cups white flour. Put in 3 - 8x4 pans. Bake at 350 for 58 mins.  Turned out perfect!!!!

This was and is amazing!! Super moist! I followed some of the advice of others and made some of my own adjustments; 3 bananas, 1/4 cup oil, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, omitted pumpkin spice and used 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground clove. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar.   I also did 1/4 cup ground flax seed, 1 1/4 cup ground oats, 1 cup flour. I split it into two bread pans and cooked about 55 minutes at 350 degrees.  I made an oatmeal, butter and brown sugar strussal for the top prior to baking.

This recipe was o.k.  I made them into muffins instead of a loaf and added chocolate chips in addition to the walnuts.  They turned out very dense and weren't super moist, the chocolate chips helped, a lot.  There isn't a strong pumpkin or banana flavor.  If I make these again I'll try extra baking soda or maybe another egg to try and lighten it up and probably some extra pumpkin spice.  Don't get me wrong, these aren't bad by any means, they just aren't great.

I took the advice of gradysmom. Low and slow.  I cooked it at 330 for 1/2 hour longer then called for and it came out perfect.  The only change I made was brown sugar for honey because that's all I had . Very nice loaf but I  found more banana flavour and no pumpkin.  For that reason alone I probably won't make again. Or will make and omit banana.  I was looking forward To a little more of a pumpkin loaf.  Ty

Loved this- did make a few adjustments though- used a mixture of maple syrup and honey/ used mostly ww flour/ added some quick oats/ and added a tablespoon of  cacao powder for more nutrients also used my bread maker to make this- put everything in pressed dough setting to stir it up for 6 minutes then switched to bake setting- took about 1 hr and 15 in the bread maker- so yum!! Thank you for this great recipe!!

I thought it was very good.  I had no problem with it being too moist.  It did take over an hour too cook, but it was perfectly done inside and out.  I am wondering if perhaps those who said it never cooked used fresh pumpkin as opposed to canned? Fresh has much more water in it than the fairly dry canned pumpkin, so unless you strain it through cheesecloth for a few hours it might just have too much water to cook properly? I used Trader Joe's organic canned pumpkin and it was just right.

It's a pretty good recipe in my opinion! :) made a few substitutions and modifications ... used FOUR bananas instead of 2 (i like to taste the banana and i wanted to sweeten it more without adding sugar) and a little extra pumpkin. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. didn't have any raisins or walnuts but i did have pecans so i added a half a cup of those! Did not bake it in loaf form, but instead in Muffin form! 350 for 20 minutes and it made 24 muffins  :) Perfect recipe for the fall, a quick breakfast and for my preschooler to take for snacks!

I have been using this recipe for over a year now and I love it! I have not made any modifications except for the cooking time. I start with the recommended time and then check, if not done I increase the time in 5-7 minute increments until it is done. This bread is a hit every time. Today I am trying it out as a muffin recipe. Very excited I love the honey flavor in this.

This is fantastic!  After reading several reviews, here are the tweaks that I made, and that I will stick with.  1/4 cup of vegetable oil instead of 1/3.  Used an entire can of pumpkin, instead of 1 1/3 cup.  Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of honey. 1 teaspoon of Allspice instead of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  1 cup of chocolate chips in place of raisins, left out the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand, or I would have added them too.   Baking time, was 80 minutes at 325 degree oven. I have now made 2 loaves, and both turned out perfectly! I love this bread!  Thanks!

I will admit that I took a shortcut and used 2 cups of Bisquick and 1/4 cup oil instead of the flour, baking soda, baking powder and 1/3 cup oil. I also made individual muffins so I cut back the time to 20 minutes and made 2 batches of 12 muffins. They were GREAT!!! Love this recipe and so glad to be able to use the pumpkin left over from our Thanksgiving feast. :-)

I added 1/2 cup ground flax (in place of 1/2 cup flour) and 1/3 cup hemp protein powder and lowered the sweeteners a bit for a really healthy and yummy snack for my young kids.  They turned out great!

Yeah, okay, I had to bake this for an hour. But who cares? The taste is AMAZING. Instead of raisins, I added 1/2 c. chocolate chips, resulting in some pretty awesome chocolate chip walnut banana pumpkin bread--pretty much all the best quick breads in one.

Somehow I ended up with more batter than would fit in a single 9x5 loaf pan though, so I filled up a few muffin cups with the leftovers. I baked the muffins for 40 minutes and they still came out a little overdone. The bread is definitely the winner here.

I made this using the quick bread cycle on my bread machine.  To make it a little healthier, I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, and used whole wheat flour and raw sugar.  I also used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.
It's wonderful!

Besides the baking, I made this just as the recipe directed and it was wonderful! Not too heavy on the banana but enough for a good taste and very moist. I did not add the raisins (my husband does not like them) but the walnuts were delicious. He did suggest to add chocolate chips next time. I took into account the previous reviews on baking difficulties, so I split the batter between two loaf pans and baked as directed and they baked in 40 min at 350 degrees F. The loaves where a little short, but perfect for a quick bread. Thanks for the recipe!

Cooking it an extra 15 minutes still didn't completely set it. I added more spice than called for, and it was without flavor. I still can't figure out how pumpkin plus bananas plus spices and sugar = no taste, but somehow this recipe does it. My toddler took one bite and walked away from it.

This is an awesome recipe!  Being the chocolate lover and raisin despiser, I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins and loved that change!  I also used brown sugar instead of white for no reason other than that's what I had in front of me.  LOVED this.  Oh, and I made muffins, not bread!

I make this bread all the time. Usually I use 3 bananas and a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin puree, and twice the spices that the recipe says. But, I put the batter into TWO bread pans, or else it takes like an hour and 20 minutes to bake and burns the crust. In two pans, it turns out perfect, in basically 45 minutes. Usually a little more still though.

After reading the reviews for this, I decided to go with muffins instead of the usual bread pan. It took about 35 minutes for them to cook, but once they were done, they are absolutely amazing. I put a little bit more banana in it than it called for, and used 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon of both cloves and nutmeg instead of the 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice (as I didn't have any), and it tasted great. It's even better with a little bit of melted margarine.

I made these into mini muffins baked at 350 for 20 minutes which was PERFECT. Tastes much better the next day. I used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of honey (didn't have any) and closer to 3 bananas. I also experimented and added various toppings before baking such as a sprinkle of coconut flakes, mini choc chips and finely chopped macadamia nuts (that were mixed with some sugar & cinnamon). Fun, tasty variety! Didn't use raisins either.

I was so glad to find this recipe as I had some bananas and left over sweet potato that needed to be used.  Because I used sweet potato instead of pumpkin the flavor was probably lighter, but I was also able to cut the amount of sugar as sweet potatoes are plenty sweet on their own.  I substituted brown sugar for honey, as I was out, and only used 1/4 C. of brown sugar and 1/4C. of  white sugar.  I also used 3 mashed bananas as recommended by other reviewers and used a combination of ginger, nutmeg and ground cloves in substitution for the pumpkin spice.  Oh, and I had a batch of walnut streusel topping in the freezer so I added a C. of that to the top =)  The cooking time I needed for a toothpick to come out clean was 65 mins.  We ate some fresh from the oven and it was yummy!!!

It was good, but it took 70 minutes and the bottom started to burn before the toothpick came out clean enough to remove from the oven. If I make it again it will be split down into two pans. Also, I could not taste the banana at all. I used light and regular raisins and homemade pumpkin puree.

I love the flavor of this bread, I can taste both the banana and the pumpkin!  I had to take away a star however, because there is something wrong with the baking time/temp.  I ended up having to bake mine for 70 minutes.  I then covered it tightly with aluminum foil for the 10 minutes it cools in the pan after taking it out of the oven.  This helped to seal in the heat and finish baking it before it got too brown on top.  It worked!  It came out looking lovely and was very moist.  The only other change I made was to replace 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour to make it more wholesome.

This is an excellent bread.  It needs to be put into two smaller loaf pans though - in just one pan it's a huge bread that needs more than an hour to cook.

I made this recipe with good results.  A moist tender bread, with a nice pumpkin banana flavor.    The adjustments I made were to puree the pumpkin, banana and sugar in the vitamix until smooth. I then mixed in the eggs and dry ingredients, but I omitted the butter.  Lastly I took raisins that had soaked in grape juice  for 2 hours and stirred them in at the last minute.    Thanks!

I made a wheat-free, gluten-free version that turned out great! Having tried a few gluten free baking mixes, I found Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix the best. Eliminate the oil, baking powder, and baking soda. Other changes (as recommended by others): increased banana to 3 and cooked in mini muffin tins about 20 minutes. I made half with raisins (some of my kids don't like raisins). A big hit! Thanks

I forgot to add that I added about 1 tsp. of nutmeg (to a quadrupled recipe) and I think it was just the right amt. (Because I did not have pumpkin spice).  With 1 tbsp. cinnamon, it's hardly over powering.  These muffins are almost buttery on their own. I did keep the oven at 350 and started the 2 loaf pans on the very top rack and the muffins below.  I think that helped keep the outside of the loaves from getting too dark.  The inside loaves are perfect after baking for just over 45 min.  WOW!  :)  :)  :)  We have a Whirlpool oven and live in a relatively speaking high altitude.

I am giving this 5 stars as a muffin recipe!  I looooved the taste of combining pumpkin with banana. It was very unique.  My changes are: 5T butter instead of vegetable oil;  1t of vanilla; 2t of cinnamon.

The recipe needs some work,  but not a bad overall flavour.  I used applesauce in place of the veggie oil, only used about 1/3 of a cup and bit of sugar as the applesauce was sweetened, dropped the salt to 1/8 of the teaspoon sprinkled the top with brown sugar.  Like the other reviewers said, the cooking temperature and time is way off. At 400 for about 40 mins, the top came out perfect with just a touch of gooey-ness on the inside.  If or when I make this again, I would bake it for 50 mins, and add some nutmeg.  It also yielded 2 and 1/2 loaves for me.  Definitely don't fill the pan more than 1/2 way full.

As most stated, the cooking time is way off.  I even baked with a convection oven and I still had to bake the bread for about 75 minutes.  The recipe suggests to mix just until combined, I think in the future I will mix it a little more.  For some reason most of my spices settled down to the bottom and the lower crust of the bread had a very strong taste.  I'm sure that was due in some way to an error of mine.  Maybe next time I will try them as muffins or split into 2 pans because of the uncertainty of cooking time

My husband loved this bread, but I thought it could have used a bit more flavor. I left out the honey though because I didn't have any, so that could be why. To fix the time issue, I split the recipe into two smaller loaf pans and it got done in about 50 minutes. I will probably make this again and try it with the honey

Good pumpkin bread but not the best.  At least the banana gives it a little different flavor than other recipes.  Like others, I used fresh pumpkin and had to bake the bread for approximately an hour and ten minutes to get it done.

So delicious!!  I used a little extra banana, and added pecans and butterscotch chips....even talking about it makes my mouth water!  The recipe made way too much for my bread pan so I used the extra batter to make muffins - They were such amazing little mounds of goodness that I think I'll just skip the bread pan all together next time!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a very yummy recipe which I made into muffins. I added 1 tsp vanilla and chopped walnuts. Cooked for 29 minutes at 350 degrees. They are amazing!

Yummy. I used very dark honey that was almost like molasses. I think it needed a little vanilla flavoring to deepen the taste a bit more, but I will definitely make this again.  It did have to bake a lot longer than the recipe called for - maybe 20 more minutes- I just kept checking with a toothpick.

I just pulled this bread out of the oven and it smells delicious! I changed a few things: applesauce instead of oil, subsituted some whole wheat flour for the white flour and baked the bread at 325 for 90 minutes and it baked wonderfully! I am excited to try a slice when it cools down. yum.

I was definitely good, but not as sweet as some of my other recipes. I will add extra spice and maybe an extra banana the next time I make it!

If doubling recipe, only bake one batch at a time. Maybe its just my oven, which is NOT convection, but I couldn't get it to bake all the way through. I make this lots though, so in the future I'll just bake it one batch at a time even if I double the recipe.

Needs to bake more than 45 minutes!  My loaf took more than one hr 10 min.  Not sweet enough, too (and I'm not one for overly sweet things).  I would increase honey and/or sugar.  Very dense.  I added raising, nice touch.  Will probably not make it again.

Great recipe! My kiddos love this bread. I have already made 2 batches of mini loaves and they are eating it faster than I can make it.  The only thing I did different was use 2c whole wheat white flour. I will make the next batch with applesauce instead of oil.

I agree with previous reviews--this bread just will not bake all the way through. I even cooked it 25 min more than called for and the bottom was still goopy. I also did not care for the taste of the bread--very heavy, dense tasting. I ended up throwing most of it away.

I loved this recipe! I added chopped walnuts and no rasins, it turned out great. The second time I made it I wanted it for a dessert and I poured a vanilla glaze over it while still warm. Amazing! My family loved it.

Mmmm delicious! Instead of 3/4 cup of raisins I added 1/4 cup each of chopped walnuts, chopped hazelnuts, and rolled oats. I found the batter to be a little dry so I added 1/4 cup of milk. It was the best pumpkin bread I've ever made. I plan on baking this one over and over again...thank you!

Very good recipe, worth using again. I made them into 18 muffins (regular size). Baked about 25-30 minutes, I can't recall exactly. My friends gobbled them up.

Our tasters liked this recipe, but didn't love it. It needed something more... maybe more of the spices, maybe more of the pumpkin, just something more. Still it was moist and tasty, but needed to cook MUCH longer than noted.

Yum!!! I didn't have any pumpkin so I used butternut squash. This was a great recipe to use up my yucky bananas. Neither the banana nor the butternut squash were too overpowering. I saw that many of the reviews said it was really mushy so I replaced the honey with sugar and I made muffins instead of bread. The mini muffins took about 15 minutes and the regular muffins took about 22 minutes. I iced the muffins with powdered sugar and milk glaze and I added about a half a bag of mini chocolate chips. This might just be a new autumn tradition.

I used a PChef stone loaf dish, maybe that's why it took so long to bake to center done-ness, almost 90 minutes.  Easy to mix, good flavor, would try again.

I won't make this again. As others mentioned, it took forever to cook, and even though I left it in the oven way longer than it said to, the middle of the loaf was still all mushy.

I was expecting a real "punch" of flavor with the bread, but I thought it was sort of bland. I made it for my toddler in an attempt to get some good stuff in her. But if youre just looking for something tasty, it needs some sort of glaze or topping!

Great recipe.  I ended up making 2.5 batches to use up all of my bananas.  Made a couple changes - added pecans and ground ginger.  Let it sit about 20 minutes before cooking to get a lighter bread.  Everyone loved it.

Excellent!  I followed another reviewer's advice RE:  cutting down the oil to 1/4 c., adding 3 bananas, 14oz. pumpkin, and 11/2c. whole wheat flour & 1 1/2c. white flour.  It made 2 loaves, and took a little longer to cook, but it is wonderfully moist with lots of flavor.  Golden raisins and chopped walnuts really add to the bread as well.  This is definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe 3 times and always turns out delicious - though I've modified slightly. I've replaced the oil w/equal applesauce (makes it extra moist), increased cinnamon and added some nutmeg too to give it more 'spice'.  I've also sprinkled crumbled walnuts on top and have added chocolate chips on occasion.  Extremely easy to make & rave reviews everytime!

Delicious! I actually ended up making mini muffins instead of bread (I was snack Mom for 17 kids!!). I increased the temp to 375 & baked for 15 min. The teachers said the kids ate them up & asked for more! There was the perfect amount of pumpkin & banana. I didn't have honey so I used applesauce in it's place. I'm baking more for other daughter's class!

YUMMY! I just made this and have to say it's worth all 5 stars! Awesome recipe. I had to bake it just a little longer than the 45 minutes though. It makes a lot, I got a loaf and 6 muffins out of it.

The banana flavor doesn't come through that much but is more of a fat substitute. It is moist and does take longer to bake (about an hour) but if it browns too quickly top with a bit of foil. (This works well with all quick breads that take a bit of time to bake in the center.) I used whole wheat pastry flour. I would call this low fat (others don't think so) since I believe that low fat means 3 grams of fat per 100 calories. A good breakfast bread.

I used 3 small bananas, all whole wheat flour and 1 tsp. allspice instead of the pumpkin pie spice.  Very tasty and moist.  I tasted both pumpkin and (subtle) banana. Took 15-20 minutes longer to cook than stated.  Will make again.

I used dried chopped apricots and dried cherries, instead of raisins.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour and Splenda for the white sugar.  Turned out wonderfully!  This is a keeper!

Yum!  A hit with me and my 2 boys.  I made several changes: 1 banana instead of 2, 1/2 c. applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup pumpkin, 3/4 c. brown sugar instead of honey & white sugar & 1 3/8 c. amaranth flour + 3/4 c. tapioca flour in place of the all purpose flour (my son is allergic to gluten).  And no raisins (I forgot this time).  And I made 6 muffins and one loaf.  My kids ate 2 muffins and asked for more.  I thought it was delicious, very moist.  I'll be making another batch very soon!

Sweet and delicious! This is a great recipe!  I actually cut the honey and the sugar to 1/4 cup each and added 1/2 cup walnuts.  I always make about 5 muffins and then use the rest of the batter to make a loaf.  
I cook the muffins for about 20-25 min. with the bread, then remove from oven.  I then continue to cook the bread for another 20 min., cover and cook for 15 more or until done.

Awesome & easy!  I would have never put pumpkin & banana together but what a taste sensation. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the honey.  I also baked it using a mini-loaf pan (8 loafs).  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe tonight, and it turned out great!  The only things I substituted were: I didn't have another can of pumpkin to make the 1/3, so I added another banana instead; and I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/2 t. ginger, 1/4 t. nutmeg, 1/2 t. cloves, and 1 1/2 t. cinnamon.

I made 12 muffins and 1- 9" cake out of the batter. No problems with the baking, but my oven was very pre-heated since I had used it to cook a roast before hand, so that may have helped.  The cake was a little extra-moist in the very center, even though the toothpick came out dry.

I think this it is great that it's flavor is a bit on the mild side -  it makes it more versatile: eat it more like a bread with only butter, add some honey for something a little sweeter, or top with frosting (or powder-sugar glaze) like I did to serve as a cake!
I'm going to try it as toast too.

I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I love this recipie!  It has been a family favorite for years now. I make  mine into muffins.  The kids eat them up and ask for more.  They are loaded with vitamins with the pumpkin and the banana.  I will continue to make these moist muffins through the years to come! 
Sometimes when I don't have any honey, I use maple syrup or brown sugar and they still come out moist and delicious!

This recipe turned out pretty good for me, no problems with undercooking when I followed others' advice:  divided the batter into four mini loaves instead of one large loaf.  Baked for 50 minutes.  I agree that there is no strong pumpkin or banana flavor, it tastes just like a spiced quick bread.  But I still really liked it - a great way to use up ingredients in the house - thank you for this recipe!

Well, I intended to make this recipe as-written but was missing some ingredients.  I ended up using pure maple syrup in place of the honey, butter in place of the oil, and a mix of raisins, craisins, and butterscotch chips for the total amount of raisins.  I also used a mix of whole wheat and white flour.  The finished product is good - but would be better with just raisins or maybe raisins and chocolate chips.  The other subs worked out fine.  A great recipe to use up some extra pumpkin and over-ripe bananas that I had on hand.

This bread was okay. I added chocolate-covered raisins and butterscotch chips. A sort-of muttled taste, not strong pumpkin or banana flavor. Probably won't make it again, but good to try.

OK - I doubled the recipe and would not recommend that.  I also replaced the oil with applesauce which was ok but then I would probably skip the honey because it was almost too moist.  I did add mini choc chips and that added a nice sweet touch.

Both the banana and pumpkin flavors were easy to taste, which is pretty hard to do with bananas I've found!  It was loved by everyone who had some as something out of the ordinary and for the most part pretty healthy.  It did take alot longer than 45 minutes in the oven, though, before it was done.

I used GF flour (daughter has wheat allergy) and used applesauce instead of oil. Based on other reviews, I did use more spices. My kids loved this, ate it as dessert and for breakfast:) Gave it 4 starts since I feel like the spices really needed to be increased, will make again.

The flavor is pretty good, but like others said, it didn't bake thoroughly.  I split it into two 8"x4" pans and baked for about 55 min at 350.  It's still gooey in the middle and not well structured.  It tastes good enough for us to eat, but if I bake it again I'll play with some of the other reviewers' modifications.

Delicious recipe! To make it a bit healthier I substitute oil for applesauce and I use Splenda for baking instead of sugar. I also lower the oven temp to 325 and cook for approx 90 minutes. If the bottom starts to get too dark I wrap it in foil. I've made this several times with rave reviews. Sometimes I add chocolate chips. It's a decadent bread that's low fat/low sugar. (Minus the chocolate chips!)

Very disappointed in this seemingly great recipe! The baking time is WAAAY off! I have added nearly another hour of baking time, and counting,  in an effort to get the internal goo baked! Currently, lightly covered with foil in an attempt to avoid producing a giant crouton!! Should have known that with as much banana and pumpkin in a single large pan, something was off! If there is a "next time", I will bake it in two 8x4 pans. Just really mad that this recipe had such misleading high marks, when the reality was that the glowing reviews included remarks about the bogus bake time! I guess that's on me because I was in a hurry, looked for a banana pumpkin bread recipe, saw that  Allrecipes-which is usually very trustworthy- had this great looking recipe, and I went for it.

This bread was bland and very dense.  While we love pumpkin bread and banana bread, this combination was NOT a crowd pleaser in our house.  The only change I made was baking it at 325 degrees for about 80 minutes or so.  It came out a beautiful golden brown and was moist, but that was all it had going for it.  I will definitely not make this again, and I am really surprised that it gets such a high rating.  It is one of the blandest quick breads I have ever had.

Wow! This is an amazing recipe! I did have to cook if for a lot longer then what the recipe said, though, as many of the reviews said. But the taste was great: not to sweet, and pumpkin-banana-y. This bread was very moist. It was wonderful. Thanks for putting out this recipe, matzahball, though you may want to edit the cooking time+temperature:)

This is a good recipe but the cooking time needs to be adjusted as it was not cooked after 45 minutes. Most Bread like this take between 60-75 minutes. This one took 65 minutes.

Loved this recipe! I doubled it, used 3 cups white flour, 2 cups whole wheat, only used 1/2 c brown sugar (no white sugar or honey), and 2/3 c unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil.  And then added in some chocolate chips at the end.  I baked two loaves in metal pans at 375 for around 55 mins. The taste was great, although the whole wheat flour made the crust a bit tough/chewy (someone with more baking experience than I have could probably figure out a way to mitigate that). Even so, I would definitely make again!

The bread did not cook, even after baking for 1 hour and 15 mins. We will try to fill the pan 1/3 of the way next time. Think this recipe needs an edit....

I followed the recipe exactly except I only had 1 cup of pumpkin so I added another half of a banana. I also divided it between two 9x5 bread pans as it made a lot of batter and baked for 45 minutes. A toothpick came out clean but as they cooled they flattened out a bit and are a little dense on the bottoms (but still cooked) so maybe a little longer wouldn't have hurt. This recipe is DELICIOUS. I will be making it over and over again!

I used maple syrup instead of honey and used 2 table spoons less of white sugar. Used 3 medium over ripe bananas and almost one can of pumpkin. Used walnuts and no raisins. Cooked in the over for an hour and 5 minutes. The loaf came out perfect and not stodgy at all! The recipe is definitely a keeper.

These made 2 dozen lovely muffins. 175 degrees C for 20 minutes. I substituted coconut oil for canola and added some flaked coconut instead of nuts or raisins. Delicious flavours.

Loved it!!  Will make again!!   Changes:  1 c all purpose flour;  1 cup almond flour;  ½ tapioca flour.    1/6 cup olive oil 1/6 cup applesauce. I followed reviews and used  2 pans 
                   
                      the foil pans after  35 min.

Everyone at work has gobbled it up!  I used a whole wheat pastry flour (that’s all I have), sugar free maple syrup instead of honey and no-cal brown sugar (Swerve) instead of white sugar. Might had some nutmeg next time. I made 2smaller loaves (couldn’t even get the batter in my 9x5 pan). Yummy!!!

I wish I read the reviews before I made this. I would've added twice the spice, and either split it into two pans, or baked the loaf pan on lower heat for  longer like someone in the reviews suggested.  I had to bake it forever, and it came out very dry and overcooked on the outside and was rather bland overall. Not the best bread I've made. I'd like to try it again with the alterations and see if it comes out better.  :(

Great recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer and added some vanilla extract, chopped candied ginger in place of the raisins and an extra banana. The flavors are excellent and create a perfect amt. of sweet. I used my greased mini muffin pan instead of loaf or regular muffin pan for smaller portion size to equal less guilt : ) I bet these would freeze nicely  if sealed well too!

I didn’t use honey, and instead I used some extra sugar.  Also, I used a little bit of soy milk to thin it out as well as using extra oil for the two eggs.  It was really great while it lasted in the family!

I followed the recipe, but did not add the raisins. I used a 9x5 loaf pan, but it was way too much for the pan. The flavor was great, but messy when it overflowed the pan. I definitely make it again, but use two loaf pans.

Very moist and baked as directed with the exception of I added 3 ripe bananas.  It needs more spices so next time I’ll add additional cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and maybe 1/2 tsp of ground cloves.  I actually had extra batter so I made 6 additional muffins and baked at the same temp for 20 minutes.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it has not cooked throughout. I have tried splitting the batter in to 2 load pans and the center still does not cook, just raw batter. the outer edges cook perfect and from what I've tried is really good, just wish the whole dish would cook correctly. any tips would help!

I made following the ingredients exactly (except I used olive oil since I don't use vegetable) and per my husband they are very good. I think next time I will add a bit more spice to them. Otherwise, perfect.  I made them into muffins since that's how we prefer to eat them. This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Just excellent. I replaced half the vegetable oil with 4 tbsp. creamed butter. Replaced half the sugar with brown sugar. And used 3 bananas instead of 2.

I used the recipe as a starting point, not the recipe by itself. I took a lot of people's advice and decided NOT to bake this in a bread pan. Glad I did, because it STILL came out somewhat "mushy" on the bottom, while the top was crusty and brown.  What I added differently was whole wheat pastry flour in place of all purpose (because of personal preference in using less processed flour). I also added about 3 or 3 and a half cups of cored, peeled, and sliced apples (a variety of them) because I had apples to use up. I also added much more cinnamon and less pumpkin pie spice (just personal preference again; I like cinnamon way more than pumpkin pie spice). All else was identical to the recipe given. Finally, I baked it at 350 degrees for at about an hour and 25 minutes. 45 minutes was way too short, even though I chose a much larger Corningwear dish (a 10 X 10 X 2 inches). With this big of a dish, it should not have been mushy on the bottom. I was afraid to bake it any longer for fear the top would become burned or too crusty. It tasted OK, but because of the mushy texture on the bottom, I won't be making this recipe again.

I followed the recipe exactly! Except I had to bake an hour. Also I added a simple caramel drizzle on top and served warm with churned butter.

I used stevia instead of the sugar but kept the honey and used a little less. The previous folks were all correct in the cooking time.  I needed about 1hr 10 min to get it cooked through. It will make a great breakfast bread.

Excellent recipe!  I made it into muffins with using whole wheat pastry flour since we were out of all purpose.  I added 1 tsp vanilla which enhanced the flavors.  I can’t believe how light and moist they are!  I was a little worried since banana and pumpkin are two strong flavors, but it melds perfectly together.  Thanks for the great recipe and addictive muffins. -Will make again!

The bread is delicious! I even substituted apple sauce for the oil and the bread was still amazing! The only adjustment is that you definitely have to cook it at leeeeast 15 min longer than the suggested time if not 20 min.

This is a moist & delicious loaf. I usually bake with whole wheat flour & find that regular banana loaves dry out quickly but definitely not this one! The pumpkin helps to retain the moisture & it doesn't last for long in our house! Thank you so much for sharing.

I made this bread according to the recipe but omitted the walnuts. It was delicious and a big hit in my house. I did have to add to the baking time. This bread is super moist and delicious. I'll be making it again. I like the combination of pumpkin and bananas.

Ok, I do think this bread tastes awesome, but it came out gooey. I cooked it 30 minutes longer then it said. I feel the problem is that it should have made 2 loafs. It's away to much for 1 loaf pan. I added vanilla extract. I will try it again.

It was great once I added some more time. I should've read the ratings, as I had to bake an additional 25 minutes.  I did add foil to the top at the 45 minute mark,  since it puffed up over the pan and had browned darker than I was expecting.

I loved this cross between banana bread and pumpkin. I used three bananas and made them into muffins with a cream cheese frosting. ( I added a picture above) and I also added raisins because I love them. So tasty and moist, the flavor was such a pleasant cross between banana and pumpkin it really blends well.

These were really good!  I increased pumpkin to a full can (abt two cups), I decreased oil to 1/2 cup, used whole wheat flour, and added 3/4 c brown sugar rather than the brown sugar/honey mixture.  I baked them in muffin tins for 20 minutes!

I had to bake it another 30 minutes and it still was too wet.  I followed the recipe perfectly and it didn't  work out.  I won't be making this recipe anymore.

I decided to make this for breakfast and it turned out great! Just make sure you bake it for about 10-15 minutes longer. Other than that, my family and I loved it

My family loves these!  I substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for the honey and use a whole 15oz can of pumpkin. Adding the walnuts makes it extra special. I bake in greased muffin tins at 350F for 20 minutes. Perfect every time. :) I get about two dozen muffins, which we prefer because of their portability and single serve ease. Delicious!

I love this bread, so soft & moist.  I did go w/ some recommendations on baking time.  I baked 4 mini-loafs @ 325 degrees for 45 min. and they came out perfect.  I am going to drizzle a little icing on top when they cool a little more.  The secret I learned after reading review is...bake it at lower temp. for longer period of time.  I will now do this for all my quick bread recipes.  Thrilled!!

I made this 2 ways.  The first was just as the recipe states with an adjustment to 325 degrees and baked for 60 min.  The second one was just like the recipe, but with just pumpkin rather than pumpkin plus bananas.  I used extra pumpkin at about the volume of the bananas and baked it the same as the first loaf.  
I thought the taste was good, but not outstanding, not very sweet (I'd like it sweeter) with a cake-like texture.  I would prefer a bread a bit sweeter, and slightly more moist.  (This was not dry however)

I love making this bread and have twice in the past month!! I substituted the white sugar for coconut sugar and it was still delicious. I have a gas oven so I had to cook it for about an hour or so.  Anyway we eat it in the morning then warm it up at noght with vanilla ice cream.

By far the tastiest bread. My girls loved it. It was my first time baking with pumpkin. I used normal pumpkin(not canned), and also used ground all spice. It is moist and delicious. Why I didn't give it a 5- it's way too sweet

I used molasses and honey because I didn't have enough honey and I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also had some difficulty like other users with it being done all the way through in 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes and covered it with aluminum foil and I cooked it for about an additional 40 minutes.  It still came out good moist in the middle.

I ended up making muffins instead of the loaf. And of course being new to baking and the like, over cooked the first batch by about 10 minutes. Also, I added chocolate chips instead of raisins. My better half still claims they are delicious and I'm going to tend to agree! Thanks my love ??

Deliciously moist and spicy! I made 3 smaller loaves and followed the recipe exactly stated. I saved one loaf for me and gave the other loaves to family. My bake time was way  off, but I think it's my oven. I kept a close eye on them and they came out perfect! This ones a keeper!

I will definitely be making this recipe again soon, especially now in the fall! It is delicious and moist and a very forgiving quick bread if you decide to substitute ingredients. I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla extract and decided to use brown sugar with a combination of honey to give a more caramelized flavor. I also doubled the recipe to make two loafs, a muffin pan and a mini muffin pan! Changing the oven temperature to 325 was a great suggestion and using a toothpick I was able to judge when to pull them from the oven :)

This is a good recipe, after reading reviews I changed a few things. I used 3 bananas, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and used 1tsp of salt. I made them into muffins, 2 dozen and added a cinnamon sugar mixture on top. Baked at 325 for 25min and they are perfect!!! My kids love them and my coworkers will too :)

It's tasty, but the recipe needs some fixing.  It took me over an hour to get a clean toothpick out of it, and at that point the crust was starting to burn, AND parts of the loaf were still a little undercooked.  What's the best way to fix that, different temperature?  Different type of pan, like a 9x9?

Liquid / dry ratio way off on original recipe.  Changes I made that turned out well: reduce pumpkin puree to 1 cup, reduce honey to 1/4c, replace half all purpose flour with whole wheat,  and bake for 60 minutes (covered with aluminum foil for last 15min).   For pumpkin pie spice, used nutmeg, all spice and ginger.

This bread is the best of both worlds, banana and pumpkin!
It makes a large, moist, beautiful loaf. My family finished it in one night.(even the ones who don't like honey!) I added chocolate chips instead of raisins. Definitely a keeper!

I chose a banana pumpkin bread so I didn't have to use a lot of sugar. This works! Very moist and flavorful. I made a few modifications: I decreased sugar to 1/3 cup, use 1/2 cup olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and 15oz. can of pumpkin instead of measuring it out by cups. So delicious!

Followed the recipe almost exactly - only change was not using pumpkin pie spice due to nutmeg allergy, and instead guesstimating amounts of ginger, allspice and a bit of ground cloves, plus the cinnamon. The bread turned out perfectly.

SO GOOD! Everyone asked for the recipe.

I changed the flour to whole wheat flour and used applesauce instead of oil and stevia baking sugar instead of white sugar and it was the best banana bread I've ever made.

What makes 100x of a difference is the ripeness of the bananas. Make sure they are completely black and I promise they'll be amazing. I did one with young bananas and it did not compare.

Super good. The changes I made were I used 3 bananas instead of 2, used brown sugar instead of honey and I added butterscotch chips instead of raisins - so good! I made the batter into muffins instead of a loaf and baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Made 18 muffins.

This came out delicious. I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Baking Mix and replaced honey and white sugar with 3/4 cup total sugar in the raw. 
Cooked on 350F with convection bake for 40 minutes.

This recipe made wonderful muffins.  I baked them at 350 for about 22 minutes and they were just right. I did add 3 bananas (just because that's what I had on hand), so the banana flavor was a little stronger, but still absolutely delicious.  A perfect way to enjoy the first days of Autumn.

I made this using acorn squash instead of pumpkin because my neighbor gave us a few acorn squash. It turned out pretty awesome.

We loved this recipe. I made it with all the listed ingredients. I only changed the pan. Instead of one bread pan, I used two 8x2 pans and baked for about 50-55 minutes. The bread was moist and flavorful, but not overly sweet. Next time, I'd love to add a glaze. Yum. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was fantastic! I took the advice of others and baked it at 325 until it was done to my liking! And it turned out perfect. 

As for ingredients the only thing I did different was adding 3 bananas and I added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. It was amazing!

I made no changes to the recipe. I countered the long cooking time by making 12 medium muffins and a bread with the remaining batter. I just put them in at the same time.   About 30 min later it turned out beautifully and it has a fantastic flavor that my family loves.  I personally feel it tasted even better the next day as the flavors joined together. I am making more this week!  Plus I think I will follow the same cooking style with my own banana bread recipe to avoid overlooking it!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

So scrumptious but bake time needs adjusted.
I bakes for 12 min longer and finally decided I had to be wrong and pulled it out even though I knew better. Top middle section is gooey now and a mess. :(
I should have baked atleast 15-20 min

Substitute honey with 1/4 cup maple syrup. 
3 bananas, not 2

Frosting: Greek yogurt with sugar to taste (about 1/3 cup to 5oz yogurt) and splash of vanilla - wisk sugar in gradually)

I really wanted to like this recipe and thought it would be a great way to use up my overripe bananas, and made it exactly as written. It wasn't anywhere near baked at 45 minutes and cooked it an extra 15 minutes. I did appreciate that it was less sweet than typical banana bread, but the honey in the recipe didn't lend the  sweetness that this bread needed, and the banana flavor was barely noticeable. Chalk this one up to what it was, but I'll keep looking for another recipe that better incorporates the flavors of the two main ingredients.

Not great.  It tasted like neither banana nor pumpkin and the outsides burnt before the middle was done. Should have just made normal pumpkin bread.

Great! Just do what the other reviewers suggest, and bake it in muffin tins. Also, go for full fall flavor with dried cranberries and pecans instead of raisins and walnuts.

After reading reviews I divided the batter in half and made two smaller loaves. Despite this the interior never got completely done while the exterior of both loaves was rubbery. Worst of all, it had little flavor. The pumpkin and banana seem to cancel each other out and it just tasted both sweet and bland. What a waste of ingredients!

Delicious! After reading some reviews I split between two loaf pans. The batter was enough for one full loaf and about 3/4 of the second.

This is a very moist and delicious bread.   I used fresh pumpkin with banana's,  let the pumpkin drain and mixed with the rest of the ingredients.   I will be making another one and bring into work..

With only a 1/3 c. of oil in a large loaf, this is very low fat compared to other similar breads.  And its noticeable, though not necessarily unpleasant.  The texture smooth and moist and he low fat content does make this a better vehicle for spreading with cream cheese than some other recipes.   I doubt I will make this again.  You don't really taste the banana very much, and presumably the addition of banana that causes you to use less than a full can of pumpkin.  I don't like recipes that leave bits of ingredients in my fridge--particularly ones I don't normally use-- and I now have about 1/3 cup of pumpkin that I may or may not find a use for.   With regard to cooking time, I had no trouble.  With this and similar recipes, I bake for 40 minutes, then leave the door shut, cut off the oven and give it another 20 minutes in the still hot but cooling oven.  Always works perfectly.  I used frozen banana, which I did not thaw but ground up in the food processor and added last to prevent the extra moisture of thawed bananas from being a problem.  That worked great.  I dialed down the spice based on personal preference and added vanilla.  The amount of spice does not figure into my review, but I used just half a tsp of cinnamon, half a tsp of allspice (I don't keep pumpkin pie spice), and a tsp of vanilla.  I thought it gave a pleasantly fall-like but not overwhelming flavor.  I might increase the cinnamon back to 1 tsp. if I made again.

My family really loved this bread once it was finally cooked. Agree with everyone,cooking time should be 70-80min. I used fresh pumpkin and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top of the batter before baking. Everyone says it smells like Thankgiving in our house. YUM!!

This one did not impress me. It doesn't really taste like banana, nor does it taste like pumpkin. I followed the recipe except for using molasses instead of honey and 3 bananas instead of 2 (they were kind of small).

I made this recipe this morning. I had 4 ripe small bananas that I used but other than that, I followed the recipe. It is very good and moist. I ate it with butter. I think it could use a little more sweetness for those sweet tooths in the house but I think this recipe is good as a bread.

Very Good. I have been wanting to make something with pumpkin - it's that time of year! Since I had a couple of browning bananas, this was perfect. I added the walnuts but not the raisins. I also added 2 tsp. vanilla extract because I like vanilla in most everything.

Maybe I was expecting something a bit more cake-y but I could barely taste the pumpkin - couldn't taste the banana at all and it has a slightly salty taste more like too much baking powder or baking soda. I will try a slice from the middle in case my first try was not mixed well enough but I do not like it at all.

We loved this bread!  I only used 1/4 c honey and added 1/4 brown sugar to make up the difference.  We baked in 4 small loaf pans for about 43 minutes.  It turned out perfectly and we sliced and ate the first one warm with cream cheese.

This bread is so delicious! As many reviewers stated, there is an issue with the cooking time, which is easily rectified. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but after 45 minutes it was still gooey in the center. So I covered the bread with foil to prevent over browning, and continued baking for another 15 minutes. Came out perfect. It's even better the next day!

Turned out very nice!  Very moist and flavorful (although I only added 1.5 teaspoons of the pumpkin pie spice, a bit more banana and less pumpkin, and a bit more than the 1/4 teaspoon salt the recipe called for).  It ended up baking for about 51 minutes.  The only gooey bits consisted of chunks of banana that were not smashed up enough.  Will use this recipe in the future -- maybe I'll add chocolate chips next time.

It was a very dense bread and my kids weren't into it like they are when I make the Downeast Maine recipe off this site.

Delicious! I added a bit extra of the spices as suggested, used 3 bananas instead of 2, and baked for 50 minutes.  It came out perfectly! Moist, chewy, and flavorful.  Loved it.

Delicious and healthy.  I made these to use up bananas and canned pumpkin.  I made them according to the recipe except I cut the sugar.  I trippled the recipe, because I had a lot of bananas to use.  Triple recipe gave me 80 muffins.  I made muffins to put in my kids lunches, packs easier than bread.  I only added 1/2 cup sugar total for the trippled recipe.  I also added white chocolate chips, which made it a very yummy desert-ish.  I didn't add the optional raisins or walnuts, but added an extra banana because they seemed small.  I also used duck eggs instead of chicken eggs.  That was what I had on hand and they are supposed to make everything fluffier because of the extra egg white.  They are delicious.  I baked them for around 15 minutes at 350-degrees and they were perfect.  Not sure how this would turn out as a loaf, but it was terrific as muffins!

This recipe is great and I made it GLUTEN FREE. I tweaked it by adding 2 extra bananas, 1/4 cup of olive oil instead 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, 1/3 cup shredded coconut, a dash of ground cloves and some dark choc chips!  Also substituted rice flour to make it gluten free!!  Made wonderful muffins and soft cake like cookies.

Yum. Followed almost to at "T", didn't add the pumpkin pie spice as I didn't have it and added chocolate chips to half of the batter. Made them into muffins, didn't last 2 days. Delicious.

This is a great recipe!  I made mini-muffins and they came out perfect...springy, moist and yummy!  I opted for the muffins as I have two small children and with what everyone was saying about cooking time in a loaf pan, I just decided it was best to avoid it.  I did make some adjustments--because I just can't seem to follow a recipe as is....

First of all, I used 4 completely black bananas.  I also used pumpkin pie mix instead of pumpkin puree because that is what I happened to have.  Also, I was out of vegetable oil, so just used melted butter.  I know super healthy....  I only had a small amount of honey left too (can you tell I wasn't planning to make this?) so I used brown sugar instead.  Again, maybe not the healthiest, but tasty!  The rest I did as written and they are amazing!  Thanks!

Good muffins. Made a 1/2 batch, baked at 400 for 18 minutes in greased muffin pan. Good banana flavor and pumpkin flavor.

I made this tonight for my husband who is a banana bread nut. It smelled really good, I baked it for about 1hr 15 minutes on 325. I also used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 chopped pecans. Hubby picked the 4 star rating for taste, it was very easy to make and made little mess. I will try it again when I'm off the South Beach diet and can have carbs again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made as directed, but added 15 minutes to the cooking time. It turned out okay. Mine came out fully cooked, even though I made just one large loaf. The bread was a bit dense, though I blame the whole wheat flour I used. It was a good wau to use up extra pumpkin and bananas, but probably will not make again.

Added 3/4 c of chocolate chips and substituted 1/2 c brown sugar for honey. Perfect mix between banana bread and pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. Yum. Large recipe - needed large loaf pan or it would have taken long time to cook. As is, had to cover the top after regular cooking time and add 5 mins to finish the middle.

I followed this to the recipe. I'm not sure why I didn't like the banana/pumpkin taste. Maybe I was expecting it to taste like pumpkin bread. My two year old liked it. I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. Maybe only using one banana next time will do the trick.

my whole family liked this- even my 2 year old grandson!!  The banana does get lost, but I had added 3 overipe frozen bananas to the mix, that may have been the reason. It does need a little more extra time to bake, but since we like it very moist it was great for us.  
Next time we're going to add finely grated carrots to see if the grandbaby can get his veggies in with the bread.

I liked this recipe and will probably make them again. I modified the recipe a bit to the ingredients I had on hand: 3/4 cup of pumpkin and 3 bananas. I am a fan of mini muffins and just spayed the nonstick pan instead of using muffin cups.  They didn't stick and turned out well. I didn't notice the pumpkin as much as the banana, but I assume this is because of my recipe alteration.  Next time I will try following the ratio of pumpkin to banana.

The taste was good on this bread, but I had to cook it much longer than the 45 minutes suggested, and by the time the inside of the bread was done, the outside was too dark.

i followed someone else's advice and subbed apple sauce for the oil and one more banana and it was delicious!

After reading all the reviews, I really experimented with this recipe!  I only had one banana, so I used it and a bit of apple sauce (in addition to the pumpkin).  I didnt have any honey so I used real maple syrup (not the pretend stuff!).  The maple syrup gave it a great "background" flavor. I also added some chocolate chips (because according to my family:  "everything tastes better with chocolate chips!").  They were baked as muffins (so they actually took less time).  In addition to the 12 "regular size" muffins, I also had enough batter to bake 3 large muffins (they obviously took a few minutes more in the oven).  The house smelled WONDERFUL from these muffins too!

This was incredibly easy and pretty good. I used chocolate chips instead of nuts. I wish the pumpkin flavor was a little more present.

Wonderful recipe!  Followed it to a 'T', except that I made it into bars instead of bread loaves.  I baked for only 25 minutes, and they turned out perfect.  I topped with cream cheese frosting, and they were a huge hit at work!

This recipe was fantabulous!  My husband especially loved it.  I used 1/3 whole wheat flour, 1/3 spelt flour, and 1/3 unbleached flour, plus added about 1/4 cup of flax meal.  I used 3 bananas and a little less oil.  I also baked it for about 1 hour and 10 minutes and it came out perfect!  Yum yum yum!!!

This was very good.  The texture is slightly rubbery, but the flovor is wonderful.  I made is with my own homegrown fresh pumpkin and omitted the raisins, put in walnuts.  I doubled the recipe planning on a loaf for home and one for college daughter, so as my bananas are small used 5 instead of 4.  The doubled recipe made 3 and a half loaves.  I think that the problem some people are having getting it to cook may be due to filling loaf pans to full.  Next time I think that I will use brown sugar instead of the white sugar.

We really loved this recipe.  I did some modifications based on some other reviews.  I raised the temp to 400 degrees and added another banana.  I cut down the pumpkin spice to 1 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 cup more flour as well as 1 tsp of vanilla.  I tried making it into muffins and it made 12 and a small loaf of bread.  The bread had to cook longer.  Both turned out great and it was a nice change to regular pumpkin bread or banana muffins.  I'll certainly make this again.  Thanks for the idea!

I really was looking forward to this bread but I baked it for 2 hours and it was still raw in the middle.  I have no idea what went wrong - I followed the recipe.  I see some other people had the same problem.  I'm still giving it 3 stars because the top and sides that did cook were wonderful.

This is good, it does take extra time to bake in the center, muffins really work better for it, and I got 24 medium sized muffins out of the recipe.  I also used 1 egg, 2 egg whites, all whole wheat flour, some flax meal, and wheat bran.  reduced oil to 1/5 of a cup, added a banana.  The bread stayed moist for days, and my 2 year old loved it.

I agree - it takes a lot longer to cook.  Took me 1 hour 15 minutes.  And I don't taste a lot of banana but it's good!

This was really good bread and I could actually taste the banana AND the pumpkin.  Kind of a wierd combo, when you think about it, but it tasted GOOD.  Did 2.5 bananas.  Made one batch with all honey instead of honey & sugar and just love the flavor...but then, we prefer honey.  No nuts/raisins, just soft, tasty bread.

This bread was very moist, but it didn't taste like banana at all.  I thought the pumkin flavor was too strong and it dominated everything else.

This was very nicely flavored and moist. Thanks to a tip from one of my Cooking Friends, I subbed eggnog for 1/2 cup of pumpkin. Used part (1/2 cup) WW flour, 1/2 teaspoons each of cardamom, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I meant to add vanilla like Tunisianswife but forgot. I made 2 smaller loaves. Thanks for a great combo of flavors, Matzahball.

If you are doing this because it's "low in fat" well it's high in sugar. Taking other reviews into consideration,I did this recipe with adding an extra egg and cooking it for an extra 15 minutes and it came out a very soft moist but super tasty... cake.
