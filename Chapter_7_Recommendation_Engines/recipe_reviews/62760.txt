As a chef I don't know if I should admit to thoroughly enjoying this recipe. It tastes nothing like it sounds meaning it is fabulous. Seriously give this a try - the whole bowl was gone - enjoyed by even the skeptics. Love it!

We didn't care for this. Bland flavor. I had a big bowl of this left after a potluck.
