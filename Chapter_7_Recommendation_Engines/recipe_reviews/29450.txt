Oh my god, this is good!  It's so easy, it should be illegal.  I always tweak recipes, and I didn't do anything to this.  And I've used the sauce on crab cakes and all sorts of stuff since.

My husband and I were actually fighting the night I made it, after we started to eat, we gave each other the ", this is good stuff" look, opened another bottle of wine, and all was good....

p.s. I made it three weeks later for my french super chef extraordinaire "I only cook my salmon on a cedar plank" mother-in-law.  I breezed in from work at 6pm, and had a gourmet meal on the table 20 minutes later, I could tell by her face she wanted to hate it but she couldn't, SHE LOVED IT!!  Thank You!!!!!!!!!!

I thought this was an excellent and quick way to prepare salmon.  I cut the dill mustard sauce in half as it made plenty to cover the fish.

I made this for my fiance and another couple for a small dinner get together.   WOW!! The sauce was so easy and reminded us a bit of hollandaise sauce and was wonderful. I will absolutely make it again.  (I added a tad more honey than the recipe called for.) Thank you for sharing Karena

Well, gee, that'll teach me. I made the sauce first and wasn't thrilled when I tasted it. Definitely too much of a "tang" as a previous reviewer said. Then I put it ON the salmon (I baked vs. poaching) and wow, was I wrong. Definitely a great match, gave enough flavor to the salmon without overpowering and...no tang! Delicious. Will definitely add this to the repertoire.

This was truly wonderful. I used the leftovers to make "salmon cakes" and the sauce was a graet replacement for tartar suace.

As everyone else has mentioned, this is unbelievably easy to make.  I loved poached salmon.  The shallots were still very strong in flavor, so we'll ditch those next time.  Interestingly enough, I liked the sauce immediately after making it, and less after sitting while I did the rest of the cooking.  I think we also pulverized the dill a little much, tasted like fresh mowed grass to me.  I might use dried dill next time as I like it much better.  I also thought the sauce tasted a little too sweet and lemony, so I may throw some capers in there and be careful watch the lemon next time.  Served this with roasted asparagus and baked potato - dynamite how fast this all comes together.  15 min at 425 for the asparagus, 11 minutes for the salmon, 5 minutes in the microwaved, wrapped in a wet paper towel for the potatoes!  Sauce on all of it ;)

This was delicious and so healthy. The sauce was wonderful and totally guilt free. I couldn't stop eating this. Hubby thought I wad crazy to "boil" the salmon but he changed his tune after he took his first bite. No leftovers for this one.

Very good. I followed the recipe as calculated for ONE serving. Used red onion in place of shallots. Used dried dill (about 1 tablespoon). Very good. So moist. 10 mins was right on the money for about a 1" thick piece. At one point the small pot boiled over, so watch that you keep the flame low. Don't use too big a pot if you're not cooking much salmon because you'd have to really dilute the wine with a lot more water to cover the fish. Can't imagine why some people didn't like the sauce... it was fantastic... even with dried dill. I used Riesling wine. (Don't cook with any wine you wouldn't want to drink!) Sure beats cleaning up the grill or having dried out salmon. Can't wait to make it again!

Oh, I hate to leave reviews like this, but I REALLY disliked this dish! The sauce had no subtlety and the flavors really clashed. My husband and I ended up laughing about it, scraping the sauce aside, and making sandwiches out of the salmon cutlets, but thank heavens I didn't try to make this for guests.

This was so simple yet tasted complex!  I love poached salmon so I make it a lot, but this was all about the sauce.  Like another review that I read, when I tasted it, I thought it was going to be too tart, maybe a little too sweet even but it was absolutely a perfect combination with the fish.  I did add a touch more yogurt just to make it a little thicker the second time I made it and I used goat milk yogurt because it is what I had on hand.  It was the perfect summer meal (or a hot January night in California), the sauce made it light, just right for a warm evening.  I will make this again and again, and use the sauce on a lot of different dishes as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my family of 15 and they all absolutely loved it. Although insted of poaching the salmon i baked it in foil with onions, lemons, and sprigs of dill. The sauce was a perfect compliment to the salmon, thanx a million.

Absolutely delicious! The sauce was delicious on the salmon and rice pilaf I served with this. I imagine it'd be delicious on any seafood item. I did change up the poaching liquid slightly since I didn't have wine. I used chicken broth, water, dried tarragon, lemon pepper and some of the dill. Will be making this again!

The sauce was fantastic!  I didn't have plain yogurt so instead I used low fat sour cream.  I also decreased the amount of lemon juice like some reviewers recommended.  This was my first time poaching fish and it turned out well!

Love the sauce.  I had just made a similar sauce (only thing missing was the mustard) and decided to come on here to see what else people were doing with those same ingredients.  I went back and added the mustard to the left-over sauce...  next time.

this turned out perfect.  Loved the sauce.  I used dried dill instead of fresh and added more lemon juice.  And I didn't have shallots so just sliced up a sweet onion.  Will be making this again.

Sauce was wonderful, I didn't actually poach the salmon as it instructs here in the recipe, so I only gave it four stars.  Used sauce over grilled salmon filets and it was terrific.  I will update review when I poach the salmon.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really easy to make.  I used regular mustard instead of dijon and the sauce over powered the dish.  I will try again with either less mustard or dijon.

This was pretty good even though it didn't look very pretty...poached salmon is just plain ugly looking.  The flavor was still good.  Liked the sauce, will probably use the sauce with grilled salmon.

I was suprized at how much I like this, usually I like my salmon on the dryer side, but the texture wasn't smooshy like I thought it was going to be. The sauce was a nice addition of flavor to go with a fish that didn't have much flavor. My only change was using greek yogurt instead of regular, makes me wonder if it would have tasted even better..

I thought this is amazing!! I am a beginner in the kitchen, and I wasn't sure about the entire meal. I'm so glad I made it though..... I would cut a little of the lemon juice next time.

Generally, I'm not a fan of dill. This was okay to me, but prob won't make again. Good starter recipe for someone whose never cooked salmon before and is grill-less.

Good solid salmon recipe. I like how easy both the salmon and sauce was to prepare. Only change for future use would be to cut the sauce recipe in half--definitely didn't use even half of it.

OH MY GOD!! It's the best salmon I've ever had. I tried it 2 weeks ago and have made it 3 times already.  The sauce is really good too, I use sour cream instead of yogurt. It's easy, it doesn't leave fishy smell in the kitchen, and super healthy. I added some pressed garlic to the salmon on the pan.  I'll keep on doing it forever.

The sauce was easy and delicious. The salmon was great cooked this way. We'll definitely make it again. Quick, delicious, and easy, just how I like meals to be! We served with rice and asparagus.

We've tried this recipe twice now, once without the sauce and we modified the poaching liquid.  We didn't have scallions, and were going for a lemon theme, so I included some lemon zest and juice in the wine/water mixture.  Very nice.  The second time we followed the recipe to the letter and found it fantastic as well.  Thanks!

Had to use dried dill, but still loved it. I imagine it would be even better with fresh.

When I was younger I ate salmon all the time and I ate so much of it that I got sick of the taste of salmon so I would try and disguise the taste. I haven't had a piece of salmon in years, but last night 
I made this and it was absolutley delicious, we're having it again tonight. Thank you for putting an end to me not eating salmon anymore.

This has to be one of THE best & THE easiest 'fancy' dishes to make.  I've made several times & each time has turned out fantastic.  I usually make extra & make salmon patties from the leftovers (when there are any!)

Oh, m'gosh!  Delish!  Didn't have yogurt & used mayo.  DO WATCH poaching time.  I've found that 5 min/inch for the thickest part is quite sufficient to fully cook thru, yet not dry out.

This was terrific. I made it with low fat sour cream instead of yogurt and it was great. Moist, tender and really flavorful. I served it with rosemary garlic couscous and tomato salad.  Great recipe!

This was delicious, healthy and easy to make.  I was a little skeptical at first, but loved it!  I used "low-fat" plain yogurt, and a tad more honey...at first I thought it was good but too "mustardy". A little x-tra honey took care of that! Served w/green beans and red potatoes. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Very simple, very quick. Just what I was looking for! 

The sauce was good. I substituted light sour cream for yoghurt because it was what I had on hand. I think next time I would add a touch more honey. 

Those who have not developed a taste for dijon mustard could use yellow.

Overall, I really recommend this.

I only followed the recipe for the sauce since I alredy have a recipe for poaching.  The sauce had a very strong lemon taste and was not thick at all.  I may try it again with some serious changes but not too sure about that.

This recipe is very simple to prepare and very tasty. I do agree with other reviewers that the sauce is very pungent and that the recipe makes too much. Definitely use less mustard.

I wish I could agree with the other reviewers, but we were just not overwhelmed with this recipe.  The sauce had a bit of a tang to it that wasn't to our liking (probably from the yogurt and lemon juice.)  I added more dijon and fresh dill to compensate, but it still didn't knock our socks off.  I will say one good thing, though - - the "make ahead, no-cook" sauce was very easy to prepare.

A great way to poach salmon, but the sauce is too lemony. Next time I'll cut the lemon juice in half.

Loved this dish....simple and so delish! The sauce is extraordinary. I always half the amount of the sauce as it makes quite a lot. Since it is only my hubby and I, we need less. I am not a huge fish fan, but the sauce is so tasty I could probably put it on cardboard and enjoy it!

I was actually searching for a dill sauce for grilled salmon.  After reading reviews I decided to try my first attempt at poaching salmon.
I rated the recipes three stars because my husband and son both enjoyed the dish however I thought it was just ok...bit overrated for taste.  The dill sauce was ok -- a bit tart, not as tasty as I hoped. 
However, it was so easy to poach the salmon so I will make again but try another dill sauce.

This is a nice change from the sweet or savory ways we often prepare salmon.  The sauce goes together quickly and poaching the salmon could not be easier!  A meal that is elegant enough for weekend entertaining, but simple and quick enough to enjoy during the week!

The only I changes I made were to use sour cream instead of yogurt in the sauce and omitting the shallots (didn't have any, or onions) from the poaching liquid. This is the first time I've had poached salmon, and i must admit I'm not too crazy about it. The sauce was alright, but not well-liked. Overall a decent dish, but not a repeat for us.

This recipe ROCKED!  I've always been a little hesitant to poach fish; I thought it might turn out mushy.  But this fish turned out to be delightfully moist, not mushy.  And the sauce?  Super! The only tweak I would make to the sauce is to use less dill.  The recipe calls for 3 TBS, I used 2 and still thought it was a little strong for my taste.  Other than that, this was excellent!

I thought the sauce was way to heavy for good fresh salmon. Just a little lemon juice and fresh dill next time. Poaching it in water and wine strips it of its natural flavors. Will never make it again.

I made this for my mom and sister-in-law and paired with asparagus and cous cous.  We drank the leftover wine with the salmon, which was great.  I would recommend cutting the sauce in half, since the recipe made too much.  But overall, so delicious!

I just made this for dinner tonight. I didn't have any yogurt on hand so I used mayo and no fresh dill so we used dill seed. This is the first time I have ever made salmon and will be using this recipe again. Even the kids loved it.

You don't often get great-tasting, healthy and easy all in one recipe, but this delivers all three. Poaching is such an easy way to cook fish, I don't know why I don't do it more often. I only had a little leftover wine, so I put it a lot of water and added a chicken bouillon cube -- also put some leftover dill sprigs in the water, don't know if that had any effect but the salmon had a great flavour. I skipped the shallots and forgot the lemon juice, and didn't miss either one. I heated up the sauce in the microwave before serving; it was delicious. This is definitely one I'll make again.

I pan seared my salmon. I'm not much for measuring, but did about 1/4 mayo to yogurt ration, a few squeezed of lemon juice, generous sprinkles of dill and probably a few tablespoons of Dijon. I usually hate Dijon, but this way the flavor is mild and the sauce was really yummy.

This was fantastic, and my family loved it!  I am a beginning cook, and the directions were simple enough for me to successfully make the dish.  Thanks so much for sharing! One of my bigger pieces of salmon didn't quite cook all the way through, so I'm wondering if there is a way to make sure it's cooked without a thermometer?

Just made the dill sauce.  Put it on spicy grilled chicken and it was awesome.  Will try other herbs because I think they will turn out great

Very tasty!  Making it again I'd go with less dill and Dijon. Added bay leaves and whole peppercorns to the poaching liquid, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. Served with baked asparagus (as recommended, yum!) and mini potatoes.

Dried & Rubbed butter on salmon skin side, drizzled a little evoo on foil before putting  salmon skin side down , drizzled a little more oil on top. Salt & pepper . Mixed 1/2 C white wine, 1/2 lemon juiced , 2 tsp capers. Folded up sides of  foil , sliced other 1/2 lemon put on top with handful of  dill weed leftover from making sauce . Folded up pouch, cooked for 12 min on med/ high on grill. Took it in stay warm bag for the boat, ate it 2 hrs later Perfect!!!!! Sauce is Awesome used it on my tuna & roasted veggies too!!

My new go-to salmon recipe!  Other recipes sound good but still tasted fishy. Not only was this easy, but the sauce (so easy!) made the difference. I used garlic since I don't have shallots, and replaced the dill (I don't care for it, so I don't buy it) with taragon, my favorite new herb.

Overrated... It didn't blow me away. It's very simple to make, which is good. I think I will keep searching for something with more flavor.

This is the second time this week I'm making this dish, we love it! I had never poached salmon before and wow was it easy and with the sauce I feel like I am at a high end restaurant. I made enough to have for lunches as I am doing the whole low carb/ healthy protein thing and this dish is making it very easy to stick to my "diet". Excellent!!!

Go to summer recipe for easy dinner parties!  I make mine ahead & serve chilled with blanched chilled asparagus & a quinoa Mediterranean salad.  Nice on a hot summer evening.  Very easy to put together, too!  The sauce is just scrumptious!

I have never poached anything and this recipe was the easiest. I made the recipe as stated with everything but the dijon mustard which I was out of. I used regular mustard instead, it was good but probably will not make that substitute again. The salmon was pretty good by itself and the sauce was ok on its own. But together the pair are great. This sauce does make a lot. I tried the sauce the next day with a lemon garlic chicken I made. I think all the lemon in both recipes made the flavors clash. Overall this was a good quick and easy meal I will probably make again for my boyfriend as he loved it but this time with the right mustard.

I would make this again but, the sauce was the -1 star for me. It was good but, the temp of the sauce seemed unnatural to me with the fish. I liked the poached method and will definitely use this recipe again with some changes to the sauce.

I'm not a huge seafood fan, but I made this for my mom's birthday. She absolutely loved it. I had a lot of extra sauce though, it could probably be halved. However leftover sauce could be used on other dishes....

The fish was good, but the dill was overpowering to me. I like dill, but I didn't like this sauce. Personal preference, I guess. I was OK with the recipe, but I don't think I'd make it again.

Y'know, this recipe surprised me... We were caught at home on a Sunday night with no dinner plans and not much in the fridge other than salad... 

So I thawed out some Sutchi Fillets (catfish?), poached them as suggested (which was a lot less difficult than my hubby made it out to be), and whipped up the sauce using low fat sour cream and dried dill...

And well, we enjoyed it more than we expected we would! The more we ate it, the more liked it... looks like we will end up repeating this recipe often (like when we're caught with not much in the fridge again... LOL)

The salmon is really good and you can substitute a plain 'ole chopped onion.  My husband and I neither one cared much for the sauce.

Very nice light healthy meal.  Would've been 5 stars but salmon itself lacked much flavor.  The dill sauce was wonderful. My partner loved it.  Served with basmati rice and zucchini. Really great for a quick, hassle-free dinner.

My beau and I made this one weeknight and it was the easiest and quickest thing I have tried in a long time.  The sauce was delicious (although there was a lot left over) and easy to make as was the fish.  I would highly recommend this to someone who wants to make an impressive dinner fast.

Dear Kevvie,

The salmon was good
The company better
The best in the 'hood
So we wrote you this letter

The sauce was delic
We spread it all over
Then made a wish
On a four leaf clover

It cooked just right
Smelled absolutely devine
The presentation was tight
I made it mine

Hilary didn't finish
But Will cleared his plate
The food did diminish
At a very fast rate

So now we are done
And moving on to other fish
We had so much fun
Creating this dish

All the best,
Hil and Will

Very good!  I'm trying to learn to like salmon (since I know it's healthy) and prepared this way, I think I could eat it often.  The sauce is a bit runny; to be honest, I wanted to spread it on thicker since it was so good.  Will definitely make again.
