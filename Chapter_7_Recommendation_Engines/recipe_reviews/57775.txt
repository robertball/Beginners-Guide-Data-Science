This is one of our family favorites! I've done these as bite sized appetizers baked in the oven and as "stuffed backstrap" on the grill. Making it as one or two large backstrap pieces, putting it onto a platter and slicing off servings, takes less time to prepare. We've used the Italian dressing as the marinade, but if you're not a fan you can replace the dressing with any marinade of your choice. We've also used soy/worchester with 1 tsp. ground ginger, which is equally as good.

I have been cooking a simular recipe for years with maple bacon and that is what I had on hand. That being the only ingredient change I made. These are very tasty! Spicy....so if you don't like the heat, cut the jalapeno slice in half, but they are so good in this recipe. 

It was raining, so I broiled them, turning once, until bacon was crispy. Also, I "nuked" the bacon half done to make sure the bacon was done and the venison NOT overcooked. 

This recipe is a keeper and will be devoured again!

These were great. I added two slices of pepper but I like spicy food. We even had some surprise guest who really like these.

This is our favorite way to eat backstrap!  Use fresh jalapenos sliced and half with seeds removed instead of pickled for a little less heat.  DELICIOUS!

i thought the dressing was overpowering and didn't fit well and the cream cheese allthough it sounds like it would be good didn't turn out to be very good when combined and heated with everything. i ate everything but probably won't make this one again

LESAXTON-Thanks for a great recipe! 
In the days leading up to Super Bowl, I was debating on what dish to make for the family. Well, my problem was solved when my neighbor and hunting partner emailed me this recipe. I changed the recipe by using Dale's Meat Marinade, as an injection and soaking marinade for the venison. I rolled the wraps up after letting the meat marinade for about 4 hours, and put them on the grill. Also, instead of using skewers, I put the rolls onto a wire press basket that is usually used to grill vegetables and it worked great. All I can say is....WOW! It was a hit with the entire family. This will be a regular for any occasion and when family/friends visit. If someone doesn't like hot and spicy food, just use less of the pickled jalapeno, leave them out, or try a sweeter pepper (banana pepper). Give this recipe a try, you won't regret it. Make sure to watch your grill, the bacon grease will flame up.

OMG wonderful!!!!  We are big venison eaters, and this was GREAT! The ONLY thing I did differently was added a little apple cider to the marinade.  Will make this again and again, thank you.

I have never liked venison but this was by far the best venison recipe I've tasted.  I did cook the bacon part way before putting it all together.  Has a wonderful taste.

My husband I and both LOVE this recipe.  My husband put a little spin on it and used tequila in place of the Italian dressing, and added a bit of teryaki sauce. Delicious!

My husband and I LOVE these!  We made them for an appetizer one evening and ended up just eating them as our main dish!  They were soooooo delicious!  We ended up cutting chunks of venison and pounding them with a meat tenderizer.  It made the meat "go a bit farther" since we did not have very much meat thawed.

Awesome recipe!  The jalapeño definitely gave it a good flavor, I wrapped. The venison with bacon and stuck toothpicks in to keep it together .  Don't have a grill so I broiled it.  2 thumbs up!

Love it!!  I didn't use Italian dressing. Quick and easy.   I followed Jesekajoy's mix of 50/50, soy/worcestershire and a "fat" tsp of fresh ground ginger.  I also added a slice of water chestnut in the wrap.  Used a lockable grill basket and soaked toothpicks to keep them together.  YUM!

Pre-made these for tailgating at a college football game.  They turned out awesome!  I did find that slicing the meat "thin" with a jerky slicer works pretty easy so the wraps don't get so big.

Made these last night and they were excellent!  I made a few for kids with no cream cheese or peppers and they were great too.  I would want to marinate them perhaps overnight to get just a bit more of the zest...but this is by far my favorite Venison recipe.  THANKS!

I have tried this recipe a couple of times but generally I find darker bird meat like woodcock and dove really do well with this. Do not use the cream cheese. Any cheese that is a little harder and can stand up to some heat will definitely make you happier after the grill. Also, to take away game flavor make sure to marinade overnight and don't be afraid to season what you are marinading. Garlic, onion, spices and worst sauce or soy are popular to add but really use what you want. This same recipe can be used along with veggies and made into kabobs that will be awesome. This is a little too to plain to waste your tenderloin on, but it will definitely work on meat that is more tough. good luck!

We loved this. The venison was so tender after being marinaded in the dressing.  We used fresh jalapenos which turned out well.  We spread the jalapenos throughout the roll and used a little Tony's Creole seasoning on the bacon.

Take your time wrapping these. Microwave bacon for 1 min and then wrap. Taste great the second day, 1 min in the microwave.

I've made this many times.  I vary the ingredients somewhat.  I use green pepper instead of jalapeno sometimes and always use a small slice of red onion.  I put the cream cheese in he pepper, then add the onion then wrap it in the Venison strip, then wrap it in the bacon.  I use toothpicks to hold the bacon on and only grill it until the bacon is cooked.  The venison will be cooked perfectly by then.  It's awesome every way!

These are awesome! I bake mine on a rack in the oven. Make sure though to flip them over when they are done one top so the bacon is crispy all around. BTW I wrap the whole wrap in bacon.

Changed marinade to Worcestershire and liquid smoke.  The trick was wrapping the full length of bacon around the meat in each direction to keep the cheese from melting and falling out on the grill.  Skewer twice in crossing pattern.  Use thinnest bacon possible to get crispy result without drying out venison.

This was amazing, best way I've cooked venison. I used fresh jalapeños and microwaved the bacon a little before putting them on the grill. Thank u for the amazing recipe
