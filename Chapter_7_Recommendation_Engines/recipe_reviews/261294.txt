I made this for the sole purpose of sauce for chicken wings. I think it would be too sweet to just dip chips in but it was excellent as a wing sauce. The habanero's I used were pickled in a jar so I'm not sure if that made any difference heat wise . You get the sweet at first and then the heat comes in from behind. It was spicy, yes but that is what habanero's do best.
