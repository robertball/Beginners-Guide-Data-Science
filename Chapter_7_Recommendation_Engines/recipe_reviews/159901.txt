Loved this recipe. I used frozen puff pastry(where you find the frozen pie pastry) It comes in sheets already rolled out, which makes it fast and easy. After baking, I brushed a glaze made with icing sugar/milk and almond flavoring right over the sliced almonds. It was just what they needed for sweetness. My coworkers were calling me at home for the recipe weeks after! An impressive EASY treat. 5+++ stars.

I definitely recommend making your own puff pastry for this one.  I used a recipe I found on Google called "Quick Puff Pastry."  After I ran out of my homemade dough, I used up some store bought pastry I had in the freezer and those claws didn't come out nearly as beautiful or delicious.  The other thing I would change next time is adding more egg and sugar to the filling.  I found it too think and not quite sweet enough.  But still, OH SO GOOD!

Pretty good... I would recommend NOT putting sliced almonds on top because they burn in the oven. A sugary glaze would be a million times better. Really good with coffee. They don't keep really well though. Next time I'd half the recipe.

My rating is mostly for the filling of these almond wonders!  I love how the almond flavor is intensified with the Amaretto and almond flavoring.  I used my mouli to grind the almonds--the fine grate for half and the medium grate for the rest.  It turned out perfect.  I made these as directed, and I would agree that the almonds on top burned.  I may next time just skip the egg wash on the top and go with a very light powdered sugar/water drizzle.  These are time intensive, but what a feeling of satisfaction at the spectacular end product!

Made it with two filling recipes, one from this recipe, one from a pignoli recipe. People like the filling from this recipe better because it has better almond flavor. However, it is more labor intensive. My little coffee grinder and I worked very hard to get that 2 3/4 Cups of ground almond out. To avoid burning almonds slices on the top, I used a pan toasting those slices. After the bear claws are done, I put on the sugar icing and toasted almond slices on each claw and return them to the oven for less than a minute.

I halved the recipe for the filling (to 12 servings) because I was using Bob's Red Mill almond meal and didn't have the full amount required. I also only had one sheet of puff pastry (the kind that comes in a box of two sheets, frozen). So... I rolled the pastry a bit and cut it 9 equal squares. I piped the filling in the middle of each square, brushed with the egg wash, sealed cut the 4 slits and then placed each bear claw on the parchment lined baking sheet spreading the "toes" a little in the process. I brushed it again with egg wash and proceeded to put sliced almonds on some of the pastries, leaving the rest plain. I wanted to see what was better and I have to say that either way worked for me. Yes, the almonds brown but mine didn't burn. However, if you like you can also add almonds later when the pastries are cooled IF you make an icing drizzle to put on top of them. The almonds will stick to the drizzle. I chose to do that instead of the powdered sugar because I don't like the mess powdered sugar makes when you are eating it. My drizzle was just powdered sugar, amaretto liquor and a little water. When it was the perfect consistency I drizzled it on top of the pastries and then sprinkled almonds on those that didn't have any. I have plenty of leftover filling but I will save it in the freezer like the recipe author recommended, for a later use. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

These were delicious! I made the blitz puff pastry and it got 10 bear claws (I may have rolled the dough too thick). The filling makes enough to fill at least another batch of puff pastry. I made it a few days in advance and kept it in the refrigerator, but it lost its flavor. Next time I will make the filling right before baking the pastries. It was also very pasty, so I will leave out one egg white next time I make the filling. The bear claws definitely need the egg wash to come out shiny. I put sliced almonds on top before baking, and only one really browned.

I made these as written and really liked them. I did add a glaze to the top made with powdered sugar,amaretto liquor, and a few drops of milk. YUM! I didn't put the almonds on top before cooking since some said they burned and just added after the glaze was drizzled on top.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make. Very light with great taste.  My husband loved them. I will definitely make these again (and again). They turned out picture perfect.  Even had to share with my neighbor.

I prefer to make a recipe exactly as written the first time. This was probably the most difficult, expensive snack I have ever made. The almond paste would not break down but jumped through the mixer blades in huge clumps. I decided to go ahead to the next step hoping the ground almonds and sugar would help to break down the paste. Wrong. I finally dug in with my hands and crumbled it manually. When it came time to spread using the pastry bag I didn't have the strength to do more than a couple so I enlist hubby. Even he had to take a break. On the last dozen I finally grabbed a handful and manually rolled the almond filling and finished them off that way. Today I had one and I guarantee that for all the work and cost I won't be making these again. They weren't good enough to overcome the hours spent making them.

A little suggestion --  If you do not stock a bottle of Amaretto in your bar or pantry, but a "nip," one o those little bottles behind the counter at the liquor store. If you make your own puff pastry, reserve the two teaspoons called for in the recipe, and use the rest to replace some of the liquid in the dough recipe for a little added flavor.

It was relatively fast and easy for me to make. I had almond flour (bob's) and I just made my own almond paste (1-1 ratio almond flour and powdered sugar, a little bit of melted butter and a bit of egg whites, blend until thick dough paste) easy peasy! I only made what I needed and added more almond flour as per directions. Used store-bought puff pastry and omitted liquer. I agree it wasn't sweet enough to be a bear claw (and I don't like sweets) and the paste was too thick. Add more egg whites to a consistency you'll like (It doesn't really melt in the pastry while baking in the oven). I always keep a carton of egg whites because it's faster, easier, and you can use it for macarons, swiss meringue BC, foamy cocktails... ETC!

To IrishFancy, No, almond paste and marzipan are not the same thing and you cannot substitute one for the other.  Marzipan has sugar and other ingredients added to it.  You should be able to find almond paste in the baking aisle of your grocery store.

Drizzled (tsp butter, tsp water and powder sugar until made a syrup) on top when they are done, then dusting of powder sugar. Delicious.

Surprised only 19 reviews - this is a great recipe and super simple, with very professional results. I serve these for breakfast on Christmas morning, for charity bakes... Freezes well. I  freeze the filling in a piping bag, so takes up less freezer space.  Assembling the bear claws take no time.  

One year I added orange zest, another year glace cherries,  we love these.  Definitely dust with confectioner's sugar to get that professional look.

I used Anna Olson's puff pastry recipe.  The pastry was amazing.  Instead of piping the filling I rolled it into a long rope like play dough and layer it in the middle.  A lot less clean up of pastry bags and tips.  My family and friends were amazed!!

I added a bit more salt (because Instacart delivered gouda instead of gruyere).

I thought it was really good (no leftovers) but I will try a couple more recipes before I decide on the perfect one for my family.

I actually use this recipe as a base to make almond pinwheels. I opt out of the liquer and add more butter instead. I spread the filling over a sheet of puff pastry, roll it up jelly-roll style, place it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, then cut into 1/2 inch slices. I bake them at 375 for about 18-20 minutes. Once cool, I drizzle with an almond flavored glaze and sprinkle sliced almonds on top. They make an excellent delicate cookie-like pastry. Great recipe!

Puff Pastry just does not "make it" - not a real bearclaw, disappointed, but the filling is good  -  will continue to work on the correct pastry dough

Followed the directions to a tee except for baking temperature. I baked on convection at •375 for 15 on the lower bottom half (gas oven) then at •400 for 15. They were amazing!! Thank you
