Low fat, low carbos'and lots of fiber, neat recipie (Around 8 slices is 142 calories a piece).  I make all the recipes I review several times before I review them.  My final master piece is this:  I took 4 bags of organic fresh spinach (don't know the ounces, sorry.  Just got the pre-packaged stuff.)  Microwaved with some water for about 8 min.  Then drained and sautéed to evaporate the water along with one clove of garlic.  I like garlic but not for breakfast.  Optional-I've added onion and mushrooms and sautéed them along with the spinach.  Funny thing is the onion didn't make that much of a difference in taste so I've eliminated it.  Then i add only 6 ounces of 1/3 fat cream cheese (I don't think it needs a whole stick) I also only use a 1/4 or less of Parmesan cheese.  I don't like one flavor over powering a dish unless it is suppose to.  I used 2 egg whites instead of whole eggs.  Mix all the above.   I lay 5 slices of Muenster or mozz on the bottom, pour in the spinach and don't top it with more cheese-- it doesn't need it.  Bake as usual.  I found it's sometimes salty so watch which Muenster cheese you add.

This is a favorite recipe at class cafe. We only use 1 pkg. spinach and we use 2 cups shredded mozzarella mixed with a heaping Tb. of flour and pressed into a pie plate for the crust. We also like to make mini quiche in a cupcake pan. I am not a fan of spinach as a rule, but this is a keeper!

This is a great recipe, but I did make some changes.  I used sliced Colby cheese instead of muenster, and a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach (which was thawed in the frig.) instead of two 10 oz. boxes.  The garlic powder was omitted, and  4 drops of Tabasco sauce used instead.  I added 5 brown and serve "light" sausage that were heated up in the microwave first, and then chopped up.  I also beat the cream cheese with an electric hand mixer to make it smooth, and beat the eggs in the same way.  I layed it out as described in a 9 inch pie pan, stirring the spinach, sausage, parmesan and seasonings into the cream cheese mixture.  Baking time was 30 minutes.  It was just terrific like this and I will be making it often.

This got rave reviews when I made it for a mother's day brunch.  I reduced the spinach by a box and reduced the cream cheese to 6 oz.  I know I used a good bit less than the 12 oz of muenster the recipe called for as well.  I would use more eggs next time to make it more "quiche" like.  Very good!

I thought this was awsome!  So easy to make and even better because there is no crust.  I did use shreaded mexican blend cheese for the 'crust'.  Also sauted fresh spinach in garlic and added 2 turkey sausage I took out of the casing.  I will be making this over and over.  Fantastic recipe!

This was such a wonderful dish - I made it the night before, then early the next morning just popped it into the microwave to reheat.  It was fabulous!  I think I might choose a more robust cheese next time, like a sharp cheddar, but the recipe is also just soooo good the way is.  And what better way to eat spinach?

This recipe is now a staple in my house.  EVERYONE I have served it to has RAVED about it.  It looks beautiful and tastes fantastic. No one would guess that it's so simple to prepare.  The only thing I've modified is that I cook the spinach in the microwave... i don't just thaw it.  It makes it much easier to blend in the cheeses and egg.

We tried this recipe for Mother's Day, and while it was not bad, it didn't taste at all like quiche.  It had an overwhelming cream cheese taste.  Using cheese as a crust is a great idea though and we'll try that with another quiche recipe.

This was a hit! I cut down the Munester cheese by about half. Next time, I think I'll leave it off the bottom too. I am looking at a lot of low-carb recipes because my mom needs low-carbs, but I am a vegetarian who is somewhat lactose-intolerant so we are having trouble finding things that works for both of us and pleases the picky males in the house. This one was a hit! I got compliments from everyone in the family. Will definitely be making again, and soon!

I made this for dinner last night, and it came out pretty well.  Even my spinach-phobic brother tried some and said it was "not as bad as he expected."  (Coming from him, that's high praise.)  I liked it and my mother loved it.  I halved the cream cheese because I needed it for something else, and it turned out to be the perfect amount.  I think it was already a little too cheesy.  I used slightly less cheese on the bottom than suggested, and next time I would mix the cheese with some breadcrumbs so it doesn't taste like you are just eating straight cheese.  Also, I only had enough Muenster cheese for the bottom, so I topped the quiche with cheddar.  After 20 minutes, the cheese on top was golden and bubbly.  (I cooked it at 435 rather than 350 because I needed the higher temperature for something else that I was cooking simultaneously.)  All in all, this was good and I would make it again.  I didn't have quite enough spinach on hand, but I used what I had and it just sat a little lower in the pan.  I think this recipe is very flexible and open to adaptation, which is a big plus in my book.

This turned out great! I have made it as is and with substitutions. Now, I always double the eggs and decrease the cream cheese. I think the cheese on top is unnecessary. A jar of artichokes in place of some of the spinach is wonderful! Looks and tastes professional.

I had  spinach to use up and found this recipe very yummy and easy to make. I followed others advice and added 2 more eggs and cooked sausaged and only 8oz of muenster cheese. Mix all the ingrediants together instead of putting the extra cheese on top.

My family loves this recipe! I like onion with spinach so I added 4 minced green onions. I've made it twice and the crust came out much nicer on the bottom when I prebaked it (10 minutes for my pan) and cooled before filling it. Reheats nicely, too.

I used 3 eggs, a 6oz bag of fresh spinach that I sauted and drained, and no salt, but otherwise followed directions. Wasn't done at 35, so put it back in for 10 minutes. It was barely set, next time I'd put it in longer anyway. It was great tho, both my husband and I enjoyed it greatly.

It was wonderful. I modified it slightly by using 4oz Muenster and 4oz Provalone. Instead of the 8oz Muenster. I adore the texture Provalone adds and the two cheeses compliment each other beautifully.

Excellent side dish!  Easy to make and very adaptable!  Love spinach and love muenster!  I had one pkg of spinach so I halved everything, and actually used less than half of all the cheese and it was still very cheesy.  I think next time I make it I'll throw it in a prebaked crust!

I can't believe I have never rated this recipe! This is one of my absolute favorite recipes to make! I have been making it since 2006. I love this and so does my husband. I eat low carb so this is perfect. I do add some fresh grated nutmeg; it goes very nicely with the spinach and gives it nice subtle flavor. Great recipe, everyone should make this. :)

Not quiche at all.  Just a side spinach dish with a ridiculous amount of munster cheese.  I would never make this again.

This was excellent. The only difference I made was I added a drained package of spinach to it. Believe me, it's worth it!

Needs less spinach and cream cheese and maybe add some mushrooms.  Make sure to use presliced cheese.

I liked using cheese as the crust, but I wasn't a big fan of the rest.  I agree with previous reviewers, it doesn't taste much like quiche.  I like spinach but this was just too much.  It probably would've been better if we had added other ingredients.

I cannot stand spinach but this was very good.  Everyone in my family loved it.  It is simple and quite good.  I added about 1/2 tsp. of garlic power and a full tsp of salt.  I LIKE garlic.  If you like less, use less than I did.

i enjoyed this recipe, however, i screwed it up by not paying attention to the temperature at which i was baking. as the days went on, the quiche tasted better and better. needs salt though. i added red onions to this recipe and it turned out rather nice.

This is a great recipe. I used 8 oz of fresh spinach instead of the frozen, sauteed it in a little olive oil with garlic and onions.  Even my picky teenager loved it.

This was DELICIOUS. I used about half the spinach, added an egg, and reduced the cheese down to around 10oz. I also threw in some fresh sautéed mushrooms. So I did make some modifications, but the base recipe is glorious!

Good but really dry and very dense.  Not fluffy like I expected.  Get a much deeper dish next time than shallow pie tins.

Made this to fatten my 15 month old up.  Unfortunately, she wasn't too interested.  I thought it was great but only gave it 4 stars because it's so unhealthy for those of us over 2!

Very easy and quite good! In my opinion its not at the same level as a classic quiche with crust and all, but for being essentially frozen spinach, egg, cheese slices, and cream cheese, it is SO convenient to just throw together.

Less spinach. Less muenster. Less cream cheese and the light kind. Added mushrooms and another egg white. Used shredded cheddar chesse on top and it was good, will make again and would serve to company as well.

This was very good and easy to make. I used a 16oz pkg of spinach, 3 eggs, lots of garlic, used a block of low-fat cream cheese, and also added some feta. I topped it with cheddar b/c that's all I had. I only gave it 4 stars b/c it seems more dip-like than main-course like and my kids, who like everything in it, didn't like it. But really, what's not to like? Fat, fat, more fat and spinach.

I wanted to add that caused my husband and I GI distress digesting all the spinach and cheese. It was so good to eat, but not sure it was worth the stomach pains/gas it caused.

This was awesome!  The only thing I added was some onion powder to the spinach mixture.  My husband thought it was too cheesy but I thought it was perfect.  My 18 month old son ate a whole piece!

I loved it!  I used a 16oz bag of frozen spinach and based on reviews, 6 oz of the cream cheese and it was great.  I only bought an 8oz Muenster so I used chedder on top.  I will definately make it again.

I wasn't very impressed at all.  I don't think that it should be called quiche as it had no quiche texture.  The favor was good but it was much too cheesy.  My husband liked it, but we wouldn't call it quiche.

Made this with fresh cooked and drained spinach and added some chopped baby bella mushrooms-used 1/2 the cream cheese (reduced fat) called for. For crust used Sargentos lowfat shredded colby-jack cheese-great recipe and love the no crust concept for quiche.  am going to try making it in sqaure pan and cutting into small squares for appetizers at my next party

This was OK, but the Crustless Spinach Quiche recipe here is much better, more quiche-like. Maybe it's the cream cheese that I am not so crazy about.

I have made a similar dish to this for many years after having seen it in a magazine with rave reviews but I use 16 oz sour cream instead of the cream cheese, a pinch of nutmeg, and no parmesan cheese or garlic powder. Very tasty dish!

Tasty, but a little salty or something. At any rate, I was aware that I was eating a huge hunk of cheese when I bit into it. Best not to think about the fat content. (I used fat free cream cheese and I think the quiche was better for it.)

Filling, however. I made it for a dinner party with limited ingredients on hand and it made a great vegetarian protein dish without seeming too meatless :)

The recipe was hard to follow because it was very non specific. You have to use your best judgment with the salt and the pepper and the quiche turns out different each time you use it. also It would probably turn out just as well using monzerella.

I made this for a brunch.  I made it the day before and served
it cold because there was no room in my oven to put it in to reheat.  I took it out of the refrigerator and allowed it to warm up to room temp before serving.  BOY, was it delicious!!  Every one at the party asked for the recipe.  This one is a definite "keeper"!

This, along with AllRecipes' "Cream of Pumpkin Curry Soup" was a major hit at my Thanksgiving table.  Now that I'm following Atkin's, it's even better.  I used a little extra parmesan for flavor.  I'm currently baking one with half spinach and half artichoke hearts, and bet it will come out great.

This was a little too spinachy for me, and I love spinach.  Seems to be too much of this and not enough egg mixture.  Wasn't sure how just putting the cheese in bottom of pie plate would work but it doesn't STICK!

I made this recipe for my vegetarian daughter on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used about 4 ounces of fresh baby spinach torn up instead of frozen. I was able to cook this in a large toaster oven since there was no space in the regular oven. Really easy and the low carb count is a bonus. I will make this often. Thanks Doreen!

so i made some changes but not big ones because the recipe is awesome . first i didn't use frozen spinach i used fresh spinach . instead of using 2 10oz frozen i used 18oz fresh. second i cooked down the spinach with the garlic and salt instead of mixing it in with the cheese . third i like mozarrella cheese so i added  8oz of mozzarella cheese to the mix. and it was good. everything i wanted and everyone loved it .

Wonderful! Popeye would be proud.  Freezes well and is also very good served cold and cut up as an appetizer.  You can also substitute well-cooked thinly sliced collard greens in the place of spinach.

Okay, my family LOVES spinach, so I thought we would give this a shot. I read all the reviews, which I normally don't, and made a few adjustments. I used 4oz cream cheese and a large dollop of sour cream. 16oz spinach. Sliced mushrooms, maple breakfast sausage, and artichoke hearts. I also upped the eggs to 7. A lil bit of shredded sharp cheddar on top perfected it. Also, I used a 9x13 baking dish so had to cook it an additional ten minutes. EVERYONE loved it, the kids wanted seconds and thirds. Will defintely make it again and again! For my first attempt at making a quiche, I am very satisfied. Thanks for the recipe!

Now don't get me wrong. I love cheese more than chocolate but this is a lot of cheese. I cut back on the muenster by about 1/4th and used lower fat cream cheese. I added some onions and mushrooms. It was good. More like a creamed spinach side dish, not a quiche.  As another reader suggested, it makes a better spinach dip than a meal.

This recipe is delicious, but the second time I made it I had no spinach so I substituted frozen (thawed) broccoli.  My husband loved it, so now I use broccoli more often than spinach.

Awesome!  I'm not a big spinach fan but I absolutely loved this and so did my family.  I used 1/2 tsp of pepper, salt, and garlic powder.  I also added a cup of slightly cooked zucinni strips.

This was a very dense spinach dip on a cheese crust. Not a repeat for us- but we don't like cheese THAT much.

This was excellent...the only thing my husband said was he felt like he was eating spinach dip for dinner.  So, when I heated up the left-overs, I sprinkled some croutons in the dish, then put the spinach quiche on top.  Very, very good.  I would definitely add a few croutons next time I make it.  I know that is adding carbs, but it is still better than a pie crust!!

This was unexpectedly delicious! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, but otherwise did not change a thing. I ran out of muenster cheese slices for the top of the quiche so I baked it open top, which gave the spinach on top a crunchy sweetness. All the kids ate it up!

I made this recipe this morning and used the Neufchatel cheese and sliced the Muenster cheese (I won't do that again!). It was good for a change of breakfast food. It had a tange that I didn't expect. I will fix this again and maybe add onions and mushrooms next time. I will add the meufchatel again, and buy the sliced Muenster instead of the brick.  Thanes for sharing!  LindaK

An excellent low-carb dish. I added sauteed mushrooms and it was delicious. The cheese "crust" was commented on and enjoyed.

This was the first time I've had/made quiche and it was very good. I took the advice of other reviews and didn't use all the spinach; I aslo added some Jimmy Dean hot sausage and it was wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Pretty good quiche if you are a spinach lover. It tastes like spinach dip baked in a cheese crust. It's good, but very spinach-y.

Excellent recipe, especially for those of us looking for low carbs.  Not exactly low fat, but worth the splurge.  Made the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Even my husband, not a huge quiche fan, really enjoyed it.
