Wow that's a whole lot of sweetness... most of the "energy boost" here comes from the high sugar content. Perhaps this recipe would be more appropriately filed under Desserts.

This was great! I have a low-sugar tollerant child so I didn't have the sweetened ingredients in my cubboard. I didn't add the sweetened milk just added the extra fatfree milk. Instead of regular maple sugar I added the sugar-free pancake syrup. It tasted great!!

I made the mistake of actually using the entire CAN of condensed milk. So NOT necessary! Two tablespoons will do

I changed the proportions of things in this because 2 cups of protein powder would have made a sludge. I was guessing the recipe really meant 2 SCOOPS. I think this has way too much sweet stuff... I added half the maple syrup and it was sweet enough.. thinned it out with unsweetened almond milk instead of sweetened condensed. I did really love the flavor of the avocado in this.. never tried it in a smoothie before
