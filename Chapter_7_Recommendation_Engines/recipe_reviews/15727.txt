I only wanted to make 6 pasties, so I cut the flour, H20 & shortening in 1/2 (2 cups flour & 1 cup shortening); then to make it low fat, I used 1/2 cup nonfat sour cream & 1/2 cup crisco instead of 1 cup of lard. For more flavor, I added 2 cloves fresh,minced garlic to the dough.  This dough is great, very easy to work with! I used potatoes, carrots & onions for the filling, sauteed in chicken broth & added dill & cumin to that.  I used leftover beef made in a crockpot & used juice from that to make a gravy for over the top....delicious!

These are terrific. Even my 6 & 10 year old loved them - they each ate 2 and they're really large! I substituted some potato for half the rutabaga so they wouldn't taste it - but I did!

This may be called a Cornish Pastie but traditional Cornish Pasties are filled only with onions,potatoes and chuck. These days all sorts of additional nonsense is added which distracts from the original taste.

I was so excited to make these pasties!  The filling tastes just like the pasties at the local cornish pasty shop.  I used chicken instead of beef and pork.  Also I left out the butter and WISH I HADN'T!!  The crust was pretty dry after only 40 min.(I used butter flavor shortening instead of lard) and I think the butter would've helped.  I will try this again, though, because the filling is so good.

I didn't use rutabegas and pork but added white wine, dill, marjoram and sage to the meat mixture.  I also made a mushroom gravy to pour over them and everyone loved it!

These were very easy and very good. I used potatoes and carrots and added some minced garlic to the meat while it was cooking. We liked eating ours with a jar of gravy. Ketchup was good too. They were just too dry on their own, otherwise.

This was incredibly dry!  I had to smother it in gravy and the others in ketchup for them to be eatable.

Very good!  I did not use the rutabegas because I did not think the kiddos would eat them.  But the filling was great and the crust was tender and flaky!!

my mom and i made these last night with only a few alterations (due, mostly in part, to not having certain ingredients). used crisco instead of lard, potatoes instead of rutabagas, and didn't have any green onions or butter to put on top.  they were awesome!! the only thing we'll do differently next time (because we're definitely making them again!) is drain the pork after cooking.  the meat was a little greasy.  we made them in two batches and much, much smaller than the recipe called for (we made them in those super-size muffin tins).  fabulous!

I tried and tried, but I just could not get this crust to come together.  I ended up having my husband stop at the store on his way home from work for some large size biscuits, rolled them out and filled them with the filling mixture, and topped with a bit of shredded cheddar and butter.  Folded them back over, slid into the oven and about 20 minutes later, we had meat pies.  Not the original recipe, I know, but I wanted others to know I had trouble with the dough.  Filling (minus carrots) was excellent, especially with a bit of garlic powder stirred in.  Will make again, but with a different crust recipe.

I think there's something wrong with the pastry recipe.  I did try it, and I had to add a lot of flour and almost no water.  It rolled out OK, but the finished product was pretty weird.  The filling I changed around some, and it was good.  The rating I gave is an average for the whole thing.

I had the oppertunity to visit Michigan's UP this past summer and found this delightful treat too good to resist! We had been purchising premade pasties from the grocery store and they stopped carrying them!  So, what does a good cook do?  Make and freeze a dozen of these!  Delicious!  Just as good as the UP's delight and we could add the items that we like and omit the ones that we don't!  Like an English Calzone!

I too was excited to make and serve this recipe.  My husband is English and we ate pasties while living there.  I was worried about the pastry but it tasted great.  I am not a baker and it was a pain to roll out the dough but fortunately they looked good after baking. (BTW, I used Crisco instead of lard.)   However, the meat and veg was very bland.  I used potato, parsnips, carrots and the onions as per the recipe.  Never again for this one.

Made these for the first time, - they came out a bit dry, but probably my fault as I forgot to put dots of butter in just before sealing the pasty. My (British) husband loved them anyway and asked for a repeat!

I ended up with twice as much filling as pastry. I also added a little sage and thyme. Otherwise they were great!
