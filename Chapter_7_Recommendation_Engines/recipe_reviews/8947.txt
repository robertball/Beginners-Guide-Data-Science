The frying part is good and the sauce is good, however, the simmering part (for us, anyway) kind of ruined the dish. We like our wings crispy and this made them soggy. We'll go back to just frying, placing them in a covered container with the cooked sauce and giving it the good old shake.

These wings are great!  Instead of frying, we baked them (400 degrees for 50-60 min).  Also, we used "Frank's RedHot" sauce, and added a dash of Worcestershire, and about a 1/2 tbsp of honey.  Good stuff!!

This is certainly the closest to what real Buffalo wings are supposed to be like on the side. The main comment I would add is that the correct hot sauce for the authentic Buffalo flavor to use is "Durkees" or "Frank's Red Hot."
Otherwise, I've been told by chefs in Buffalo that margarine, not butter, is used to get the correct consistency for the sauce. Other ingredients you can add are (any or all): Tabasco to spice up the flavor, crushed garlic, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, honey, a smidgen of prepared mustard. I am in the opinin that ketchup or tomato-based sauces should not be found anywhere near Buffalo wings. But, as is, this recipe is perfectly authentic, if that's what you're after. A+

I have long sought the trick behind great wings.  This recipe reveals it.  Keep it simple.  The second step is the secret.  Instead of dumping lots of hot sauce on the wings, put the wings in the sauce.  I usually use more hot pepper sauce, but my family and friends love spicy food.  Interestingly, if you accidentally make the sauce too hot, adding a little more vinegar reduces the heat.  I don't know why, but it does.  
    I sometimes fry the chicken in advance, and then reheat them very slowly with the sauce in a covered pan.  It's easier when I have folks over to watch the game.  Reheat slowly, as, if you try to rush this, they will be dry.  
     My twist on this, in what is probably a vain attempt to make these a little healther, is to use thighs instead of wings.  I get some good sized thighs, trim off the fat, and cut them into three pieces.  One cut one each side of the bone, leaving a nice amount of meat on the bone.  Be careful, though, as these fry more quickly than wings.  But everyone loves them; some prefer the boneless strips, and others go for the piece with the bone.  Nonetheless, whether you use my thigh trick, or use the wings, this recipe is the real thing.  Thank you, Ginger.

I make a similar recipe but like a thicker sauce like some of the others who rated this recipe.  Add about 1/2 tbs of flour to the melted butter to create a roux.  Then add your hot sauce and vinegar.  Also, lightly flour dust the wings prior to frying.  Use Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing with added crumbled blue cheese and serve with celery sticks and you have an awesome appetizer/meal.

Flavor is perfect. My suggestion is that the simmer time should be posted.  Mild 15 minutes, Medium 30 min., Hot 45 minutes.

These wings are sooo good!  I bake mine in the oven for 45 minutes at 425 on the broiler pan so the grease can fall off, then toss them in the crockpot for spicy coating.  Maybe that's a *little* healthier ;)  My husband doesn't like very spicy food and these were perfect for him (I added tabasco to mine before serving).

Awesome! You don't have to go out for wings when you have this recipe.  I used the "coating" mixture from the  "Restaurant Style Chicken Wings" off this web site and deep fried them, then used the sauce from this site.  They are delectable!!

We love these wings!  They're our new favorite - even better than what we get at most restaurants!  A couple of tips that helped us: the longer you simmer the sauce the spicier it gets.  So if you like hotter wings, let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes or longer.  Second, my husband likes his buffalo wings crispy, not soggy.  To achieve that, he fries the wings separately in a deep fryer, then sets them aside in a bowl.  Once the sauce has finished simmering, he pours the sauce over the wings in the bowl and mixes the wings around to coat evenly.  It produces crispy and tasty wings every time.

No frills but very tasty.  I baked my wings for 40 minutes at 400 - then sauted in jalapeno juice, butter and hot sauce.

Having grown up in the area of the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, I had the pleasure of eating a lot of buffalo wings.  The original recipe is easy: Oil for frying (must be crisp) Frank's Hot Sauce and butter.  Absolutely no vinegar or flour allowed.  I make wings for huge crows.  Bake naked at 450 deg on a sheet pan for 30 minutes or until very golden brown.  Melt other ingredients and ladle over the wings and place back in oven for another 10-15 minutes.  Also the "Original Buffalo Wing Sauce" that the Anchor Bar sells to stores is not the original.

If you want to reduce the amount of fat and have equally tasty wings, steam the wings for ten minutes, refridgerate for one hour, and then bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Then turn the wings over and bake for 20 minutes more.  There is no need to simmer the wings in the sauce.  If you want them to be hotter, just adjust the sauce to butter ratio.  These wings, steamed and baked, are even crispier than the fried version and very good!  Also, there is little need to add extra vinegar.  The hot sauce is almost all vinergar anyway.  It is better if the extra is omitted.

This recipe has potential. For the wings, I recommend baking them in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. For the sauce....use 1 bottle of Frank's Orginal Hot Sauce, 1/2 stick of butter, a little brown sugar(optional), dash of worcestershire sauce, and a little garlic powder to taste. Melt butter first and add the other ingredients. Simmer for 8-10 minutes.  Toss cooked wings in sauce and place them on baking sheet. Broil for about 5 minutes. Serve w/Ken's Blue Cheese dressing.

These were awesome! However, they are VERY VERY VERY SPICY!!!!!!!!!!  I can't stress enough that if you don't eat spicy foods (like me) very often these will hurt your tongue and lips after eating them.  Start with 1 (ONE) tbsp of hot sauce first.  Then add more if desired.

I fixed these for my son to take to a football bowl party and my son's opinion was "they were awesome!"  I liked them, but for hubby and I, they were still too hot and I barely put any of the hot pepper sauce in.  For the record, that's just us, we don't like any food that is hot and spicy.

These wings were sooooo good! I used Frank's Wings Sauce, its not like the regular Frank's Hot Sauce, it is specifically made for buffalo wings. It is in an orange bottle. You HAVE to get this brand. it is so authentic and delicious. I also didnt add any vinegar. Just equal parts of the sauce and butter. Seriously taste better than if you were out to eat!!

Even better if you use Red Wine Vinegar in the saucse.  Also, sprinkle parmesean cheese on the wings 10 minutes prior to leaving the oven.

Like other viewers I also bake my wings as opposed to frying ( I hate splattering oil!) I use Cholula hot sauce mix in fresh garlic and butter and toss in the baked wings..  So delicious!

These wings are amazing.  We do everything as is written except we add Tabasco sauce to the vinegar and hot pepper sauce.  For the hot pepper sauce we use Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce.  We do let them simmer for about 10 mins.  We like our wings with some zing.  Dip these in ranch dressing and enjoy with a frosty beer.

Perfect!  I've been restaurant cooking for many years and I've always loved the basic "shaking my wings up in a bowl of Louisanna Hot Sauce" and serving them up that way.  I'm glad I tried them this way since the butter added that extra flavour I was looking for! For those wondering why their sauce doesnt stick, I'm willing to bet that they are using margarine... butter is essential!

I baked mine for an hour at 375 degrees.  I give this 4 stars because it WAS NOT enough sauce for what is listed.  I made literally double than the amount listed for 24 wings.  (My friends and I love our wings a bit saucy.) Everyone loved the sauce....LOVED! I made some on the side for the non meat eaters for their soy nuggets.  It was seriously a hit! :)  DELICIOUS!

This recipe is also not hot.  It actually tastes like "medium" from Pizza Hut. :) I used the Frank's Hot Sauce.  (Not the "wing sauce" because the recipe becomes altered when using the "wing sauce."  

It was great though! :) Will use again!

I have used this recipe at Super Bowl time for years and the wings always disappear like magic! I have learned how to tweak it a little for those who prefer milder wings. I shake the wings in a bag of seasoned flour (I use Hooter's) first, then add 1/4 c honey to the sauce. I make two batches so everyone can have the heat level they want.

This turned out great.  I'm going to try grilling the wings instead of frying next time.

These were incredible. I've never loved wings, but after this recipe...I'm beginning to see the light! I made these for father's day and they were perfect! The texture and the flavor were out of this world!    I liberally salted the wings before I added them to the oil and didn't need any in the sauce.  We're very mild-type people, so I took the suggestion to use Louisiana hot sauce and I only simmered it for about 5 minutes. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how much hot sauce I actually got into the pan as I just kind of nervously eyeballed it. It worked though and was the perfect blend of enough heat to give it a kick but not enough to overpower the flavor.  It was perfection!  Thanks for a great recipe. It's my new favorite!   PS -- This would be an awesome recipe for a low carb diet!

Only thing we did differently is to dredge the wings in a flour, pepper, and garlic salt mixture, and then bake them in the oven on a cookie sheet, instead of frying them. This makes them a little more healthy and is not near as messy. (The trick is to broil them for about 5 mins at the very end to crisp them up) Used Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce. Served these with creamy pasta salad. Yummy!

I did the simple way and fried the chicken, made the sauce, gave them both the ole' shake and baked them for about 20 minutes. if you simmer them, you won't get that crunch that everyone likes

We made three types of wings for the Super Bowl - these came second on my list. Not very spicy and needed more sauce.

i baked my wings.   1. steam wings for 10 min, (you want to steam them to render some of the fat out of them so they can be cooked on such a high heat.  learned it from the show good eats, makes a very crisp and juciy wing.) place on 1/2 sheet lined w/ parchment and a wire rack & pat dry then put in fridge for 1 hr. .   2. place in 425 degree oven and bake for 20 min and rotate for another 20 min.  then combined with the sauce recipe.    for seasoning i used koshar salt, fresh black pepper, garlic/onion powder, and some paparika.  Came out very nice, good tangy taste with a nice hot aftertaste.  Some recipies i have tried were way to buttery tasting this has a very good taste.

Yummy. I followed the advice of another reviewer (ChristineA) and browned the wings under the broiler for about 3 mins on each side before transferring them to the crockpot. Into the crockpot, I poured an entire bottle of Frank's, several shakes of Tabasco, and a couple splashes of vinegar. I let the wings simmer for about 2.5 hours on high, and they were falling off the bone and so flavorful. My hubby was thrilled. :)

Thank you submitter, and thank you ChristneA for the tips.

I have been making these now, by this recipe with a few tweaks from reviewers tips, for a couple years. They are the BEST chicken wings and get rave reviews every time I make them! Instead of deep frying, I put mine, seasoned w/salt & pepper, under the broiler, flipping once to crisp both sides. Then I add the chicken to a slow cooker with the sauce, using FRANK's Hot Sauce (YUM!). Slow cook for couple of hours and they're falling off the bone! DELICIOUS!

Yummy!!! I took a gander at the reviews. I broiled the wings a bit, then placed them in the slow cooker and let them sizzle away in the sauce. I did add a touch of honey to the sauce and even more hot sauce. Great recipe- thank you

This is SOOOO wonderful! I was craving wings this afternoon, so I found this recipie, and a few minutes later, I got these goodies!  I used Tobasco sauce, and they turned out perfect for my taste-mild-medium.  (TIP: The 5 tbsp sauce is 1/3 cup.)  I used boneless chicken breasts, and they would've been a little more moist had they been baked and then simmered it sauce.  But, delicious still!

Omitted the vinegar since hubby usually says hot wings have too much vinegar in the sauce and it was excellent!

I too opted to bake the wings (425 for an hour) vs deep frying and we'll make these over and over again - thanks!!!

These were a big hit and I'm making them again for a Superbowl party. Wings took 9 minutes to cook in FryDaddy and we added 10 drops of Tabasco to the buffalo wing sauce. A must try!

This recipe is great. I did make a couple of changes. First I melted butter in sauce pan and once melted added two tablespoons of flour and cooked for about 2-3 minutes. Secondly, I added a dash (1/2 teaspoon) of worschestershire sauce. Also, I used Franks hot pepper sauce (5 tablespoons) not to be confused with hot sauce. I added approx 4 tablespoons of Louisana hot sauce. Put sauce in a bowl when wings were hot of the grease, added them to the bowl and shook them. They were DELICIOUS! *dont overcook sauce as it will seize up, even if it does...can still be used as long as the wings are piping hot)

These were very easy to make and the flavor was good.  I do like mine a little hotter than this recipe, so I added more hot sauce and red pepper flakes to bring the heat.

These were GREAT!!! I actually used Frank's RedHot Buffalo Wing Sauce, added a few splashes of the Franks RedHot Original Sauce, about 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper, and about 1 Tbsp. of butter. Talk about FIRE!!!! My husband and son often talk about wings not being hot enough. These wings had their lips throbbing!!! (I got them both.) They were a bit too hot for my liking, but I didn't let them see me sweating inside. lol

Everyone tends to over think buffalo wings. You fry wings till crispy done. Toss with franks hot sauce and butter. the more hot sauce the spicer the wings! No need at all to cook in sauce and that won't make them hotter!

Simple to make and even better than restaurant wings! I would suggest baking them, as it is much more simple and healthy than frying. Simmering the wings will give them back the juicy wing texture you are used to! I simmered mine for about 45 minutes to make them extra spicy.

This recipe is Awesome.   I also like Buffalo Ranch & Garlic wings that I had at a little sandwich shop, the people were from NY, they knew how to make the best wings. They closed down so I came here looking for a recipe & this was the best one, So I made this one & added 1 tsp. of Garlic Powder and 5 tbsp. of Ranch Dressing, "Remove from heat before adding the dressing", then toss over the wings. I like mine crispy, so I don't simmer the wings in the sauce. I took these wings to a friends house for a football game, Everyone was bringing wings, and mine were the best, they were gone first, Everyone loved them.

I used frozen chicken nuggets rather than wings, since that's the only chicken I had on hand when I got a craving for buffalo chicken. I baked them until they were crispy and then followed the recipe for the sauce. They were delicious! My kids and husband loved them too!

I use boneless chicken breast or wings. I lightly coat in olive oil and then season with salt, pepper, chili powder and garlic powder. I then place them in the oven at 375 degrees for 60 minutes. Once taken out of the oven I coat them in the hot sauce mixture in a pan on the stove on medium heat. Simply awesome.

Deliciously spicy and buttery goodness!  The only recommendation I would make is that in the initial frying make sure you get them golden and crispy and well drained before you fry them in the sauce so you'll have to fry them for a lot longer than 10 minutes.  If the skin is not well crisped, the wings will be soggy.  I had to fry them in batches because I didn't have a whole quart of oil so it took a bit longer.  We dipped them in Ranch dressing.  Reminded me of the chicken wings at Waterloo restaurant.

I have tried various wing recipes at home but was always disappointed.  Not true with this recipe! As some others, I dusted the wings with flour and added about one tbsp. of flour to the butter to thicken it up a bit.  I also used 2 cloves of garlic and doubled the butter and pepper sauce because I was concerned there would not be enough sauce to simmer the chicken in...not like chicken wings are low-fat, anyways, right?  I was glad I did so, but will definitely increase the amount of pepper sauce next time, but we like our food SPICY!  My husband thought that this deserved five stars but my son and I wavered near four stars, though only because we wanted a little more kick.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Ginger!

Very good recipe! I dusted the wings in flour before frying them. We used Frank's Red Hot sauce- I highly recomment it! The flavor was perfect.

These buffallo wings were very good and quick.  I used 4 1/2 TBS of regular hot sauce and 1/2 TBS of Tobasco.  It was spicy, but not too hot.  If you like your wings like I do, make a lot more sauce than the recipe recommends.  I had to double the recipe, but I like them with a lot of sauce.
Very good.  Might experiment with Cider vinegar next time.

I promised my kids Buffalo Chicken Wings for dinner but the restaurant where we normally order from was closed. I looked online and tried this recipe.  To my delight, my family prefers this recipe to any other wings they could try.  It was excellent!

The sauce was on spot! I didn't have any white vinegar and didn't want to buy it for one recipe. I used apple cider vinegar. It was fine.

Very good..I omitted the vinegar, but that's just my taste. Also, I didn't add salt. The hot sauce is salty enough for me. Very good recipe, thanks for sharing it!

Deep fried wings are the ONLY way to go!!!  We have been doing it this way for years.  Only, we heat the sauce (Frank's red hot, margarine, garlic and whatever else at that moment) then we place the cooked wings and sauce in a tupperware bowl, place lid on top and shake to coat!!!  That way they do not get soggy....as always serve with real bleu cheese dressing(Marzetti) and celery sticks.

These are really good wings, I deep fried mine in peanut oil which gives chicken a great flavor. I did not use the vineger, I also use Franks red hot sauce. they came out really good, not any different than the resturants.5 STARS!!!!.

After reading the reviews, I thought my family would love these...however, they did not.  The sauce was too thin, and after most of it dripped of the wings, they looked very unappetizing.  The flavor wasn't much better.  You can really taste that vinegar in there.  There was definitely a lot of something missing.  I guess it takes more than vinegar and hot sauce to make buffalo wings.

like other reviewers, i used frank's hot sauce & left the vinegar out. also, we baked the wings instead of frying them. they were excellent but you have to make sure you REALLY coat them well for enough flavor.

I grill these or broil them to cook, to eliminate some of the fat. They turn out just as good and you can vary the heat by cutting down on the amount of hot sauce or adding some barbeque sauce to the mix.

This recipe is great. I have not had good wings in over 10 years until I tried this recipe. My father is a real wing lover so I gave him this recipe and he makes them about once a month. Thanks Ginger.

These are the best with fresh celery and homemade ranch sauce.  I ONLY use Franks Red Rot "Hot Buffalo" wing sauce.  A deep fryer is a must to ensure correct temperature.  Enjoy!

These were quite good and very easy to make. I dipped the wings in flour first before deep-frying and also used Frank's Red Hot. We will surely be making these again, very much like restaurant wings.

I added a pinch of salt (because it says season to taste) and they were so salty, unbearable salty. The flavor was good, but I believe that is because we like the taste of Franks hot sauce. The method was fine, we got a crispy wing that was not greasy. Just do not add salt.

I like this recipe a lot.  I think folks who say deep frying makes the wings greasy are not deep frying them right.  Deep frying is tricky, because you have to get the oil VERY hot, like to the smoking point, then you have to have A LOT of oil.  If done right, the food doesnt get greasy at all.  And these wings were dee- lish- us.  i just fry them the way i normally do with chicken seasoning, coat them in seasoned flour and then follow the recipe thereafter....

Recipe turned out great, although I overcooked the chicken...

I read the back of a bottle of Franks and it doesn't say anything about adding vinegar so I left it out. They turned out great!!

Rather than mess with digging out the bone in the wings, I cut up good sized chunks of boneless breast.  I blanched the chunks in flour and deep fried them before tossing them in the sauce.  I'm a life long vegetarian so I have no idea how they tasted.  My husband raved about them and has insisted on having them repeatedly since then.  These were incredibly simple and fast considering how much he enjoys them.  Good stuff!

This recipe is GREAT!!!! I have made wing before but nothing like this. We had a big party (about 50 people)  this weekend. I had about 250 chicken wings and I was sure that I would have to eat chicken wings for the next two weeks but when the party was over I only had 3 wings left. Everyond LOVED the wings and at least 10 people wanted the recipe. The deep frying takes a lot of time but it's all worth it. Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe. Instead of deep frying, I browned them in the oven first. Just the right amount of fire for me. Thanks.

Although this recipe has good flavor the sauce is too thin and does not stick to the wings well enough.  It also seems too oily or something.  On the third batch I lightly dusted the wings in a mixture of flour and cayenne (making sure to shake as much flour off as possible)before frying and this seemed to help considerably with making the sauce stick.  

Good recipe but not 5 star good.

I use “Crystal” hot sauce for this recipe using the same amount as the recipe calls for. Additionally, instead of white vinegar I use apple cider vinegar. For cooking, I grill them. First, I salt and pepper the wings then put them over direct heat getting some good color on the wings. I then put them in a foil pan, pour the hot sauce over the top, and finish cooking them this way. Also, serve Ranch and Marie Blue Cheese dressing on the side. They are easy to keep warm in a crock put if you are serving them at a party – your guest will love them!

Loved this recipe, the chicken turned out nice and crispy, however it wasn't hot enough for me. Next time I'll add more hot sauce and some hot peppers.

This is a great recipe!  I changed one thing though.  I used cider vin instead of white vin.  I thought it gave it a little bit more flavor and it wasnt as bitter.  I also wanted to tell you that... My husband always buys bags and bags of hot wings.  So, when I made this recipe I froze them on a cookie sheet then put them in a freezer bag.  He cooks them like he would the ones he buys.  400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes. Now, I only pay about .99 a pound!  Thanks Ginger!!

Quick, easy, but really pretty bland despite the fact that I added much more hot sauce than what was called for. Probably won't make them again. Sorry.

I tweaked this between this and the Buffalo Chicken Wings III one.  After deep frying the wings I added the following sauce:  Melt Butter and add finely chopped garlic and a couple of pickled capsicums (finely chopped).  Fry for a while until fused in the butter.  Add some ketchup and Bajan Hot pepper Sauce – I used Aunt Mays Bajan Pepper Sauce – let it bubble and add the wings and turn to low heat … Came out kinda with a sticky spicy kick… Did not take a picture – sorry.

This is the recipe I have been looking for!  These ae great wings!  I wish I had bought more than 3 Lb. of wings when I made these! The vinegar was definatly a plus!  Gave it that extra kick and smell!  This will now be my standard wing recipe!

Was pretty good.  I breaded it twice.  After dip in Sauce, don't put back on baking sheet.  Put on broiler.  Seasoning was awesome, they just were as little mushy.

These are about the most similar to the popular restaurants that I have found.  I don't typically like wings that are breaded first then fried so this hit the spot!

I have used this recipe many times. For my taste, I fry the wings until they are crispy, 15 minutes or, if frozen, close to 20 minutes. 
After moving the wings to the butter/hot sauce, I turn up the heat to medium-high and stir them until the sauce is thick and sticks to the wings. This keeps them nice and crispy! 
I have also taken to adding a lot of black pepper to the sauce to kick it up.
LOVE this recipe.

Watch the butter.  Doubled the sauce and I still don't know how the wings are supposed to "simmer".  Best thing to do is let sauce simmer on its own while you fry the wings, then shake on the sauce in a container or bag.  Ours were greasy and soft.  But the sauce definitely is good.  Husband added horseradish and Sriracha hot pepper sauce (found in the asian section, the one with the rooster on it--SO spicy). We loved the sauce.

Great Buffalo sauce.   I only made a few changes to make it healthy.  I used Parkay buttery spray instead of butter and I used a chicken cut up into cubes without the skin.  I did add a tablespoon of honey to the sauce to cut it.  I used the same Parkay buttery spray to fry the chicken chunks in a pan.  My husband was skeptical, but once he ate the first bite he was hooked.  Same flavor and crispy chicken but no fat or skin from the wings.

Wow! Absolutely wonderful sauce. The Frank's Hot Sauce is the key. Watch the amount of butter. I added garlic powder as someone else suggested...it was just the right touch. Served during a football game gathering and they were a hit! This will be the only chicken wing sauce I will use from now on. Thanks Ginger!

I followed others' suggestions and dredged the wings in flour with seasoning salt before frying them. I also doubled the sauce for the amount of wings I needed. They were good and hot but I was trying to make some of them less hot by adding more butter and less sauce...didn't work too well.  With the addition of the flour to the wings the sauce did stay on.  Don't "boil" your sauce or it will separate. My first batch had to be tossed.

These were ok. Coming from upstate NY, I am used to "WOW" with my wings. Not nearly enough sauce, and what sauce there was didn't really stick. I tried 2 recipes from this site for a party. The other recipe I tried was gone looong before these were. I think maybe triple the sauce and coating the wings with flour, garlic powder and pepper (letting the light coating sit a little bit) would have made a world of difference.

Can't give this one more than 3 stars. To start, I followed the recipe to the letter and there was not nearly enough sauce to cover the wings, I wish I had doubled the amount. Also, what little sauce I had didn't "stick" to the wings at all and since this was my first time making wings, I'm really not sure if there is something I could have done differently. I will continue looking for something better

Excellent!!! They taste identical to the wings that we buy from the take out joint down the street!!!!!  I buy the large bag of Tyson Frozen wings from Sam's Club for $12.00 and can make approx. 40 wings...great for parties!!!!  Make em today!!!  I double even triple the recipe because we like lots of sauce.

These wings were great.  They really do taste just like the ones in a restaurant.  I was in a rush to make them so I basically just stirred them around in the sauce for only a minute or two and because our family doesn't like hot wings, they were perfect.

This wing sauce is great I added some garlic powder and honey to the sauce and it was devoured quickly!!! The only thing I changed was that I only put in 1/4 teasp of vineger we found for us that 1 tablespoon was way too much vineger but other than that is was yummy!!!   

thanks!!! :)

This is our favorite wing recipe. The only thing I do different is to simmer 1 clove smashed garlic in the sauce. It is a great addition.

Very tasty, but not nearly hot enough for me. I added more hot sauce (Glory Hot Sauce)to suit my taste. The sauce was a little thin and didn't coat the wings well. Instead of salt and pepper, I used Sylvia's Sizzlin' Hot Spice to season the wings. Next time, I think I'll try dredging my wings in a little flour before I fry them.

We loved them!  My honey said they're better than the ones you get in Buffalo, NY (where buffalo wings originated).  Thanks!

The sauce was really thin and greasy tasting and not nearly hot enough. Even my fiancee who likes his wings milder didn't find them spicy enough. (And I added about 3 - 4 extra tbsps of hot sauce and 1 tbsp of tobasco!) I also found that there wasn't enough sauce for all of the wings when I followed the recipe exactly. I think next time I'll try to sweeten the sauce with a bit of honey, use a little less margarine, and use a different brand of hot sauce for a better taste. These could be really good if the sauce was right. The texture of the wings was great. I like the idea of deep frying them and adding the wings to the sauce to let them simmer.

I doubled this recipe, and served them at a party...they were gone within 15 minutes. Everyone loved them!  I made double the amount of sauce, and let them simmer in the crockpot which worked great.

Buffalo wing perfection! I don't live near a pizza place that can make good buffalo wings, so I am happy to have this sauce recipe. I didn't bake the wings, I floured the wings and fried them. I did have to double the sauce because of the flouring. So delicious.

This recipe is missing garlic and a few pinches of cayenne pepper.  Its a good jumping off recipe to add things to it to make it your own.  If nothing else, add garlic and you'll have a much better tasting wing.

I followed the directions exactly for the sauce and it was wonderful - the only thing I did differently was add some chopped jalapeno to the sauce while it was simmering to give it more of a kick since we like really spicy food.  Instead of using the sauce on wings I baked some chicken breasts and coated them with the sauce - very good.

I just made these wings and they were awesome! I followed other reviewers and just tossed them in the sauce making sure to coat them well rather than cook them longer however I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and they were a hit!

My rating is based on my cooking abilities and experience. I baked instead of deep fried, added some honey to the sauce, and then baked the sauce in. Was a hit with my family... although personally, I will probably dome something a little different next time, want a little more flavor...

These were very good. I played around with different hot sauces to achieve the taste I wanted. I also rubbed some salt into the wings before deep-frying.

Used bone-in chicken thighs in place of the wings. It took longer to cook approximately 15 minutes in the pan & then I stuck them in the oven at 425 degrees on the 3rd rack to the bottom for about 20 more minutes. Turned out great! Served with french fries.

These were a hit!  Baking them they were still crispy and slightly healthier:).  I added tabasco for hotter wings.  The juice stuck to the wings thanks to TX Chef recommendations. Will make them again!!

The sauce is great but deep frying the chicken wings make them really, really greasy.  My hubby and I think that baking them using the sauce would make them much better.

Incredible!  My husband said that these wings were better than a restaurant chain in our neck of the woods called Wings Etc... The sauce tasted PERFECT!!!  It wasn't too hot, but if you wanted it hotter, you just add crushed red pepper.  Instead of placing the deep fried wings in the sauce and cooking on the stove, we just tossed the wings with the sauce so the wings would keep their 'crunch'.  Thank you so much for this recipe, we'll use it over and over again!!!!

Good wings...definitely saves money instead of buying them from a wing joint.  Be mindful of what hot sauce you use, the wings can be hot, but oh so good!

This recipe is very close to the original, and very good. A couple of hints: - use Sriracha for the hot sauce. The flavor is wonderful.  - dip the wings in the sauce to cover them, then bake in a 450 degree oven for 5 minutes.

I liked this recipe.  I didn't deep fry the wings I just baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 min.  This is a easy yummy recipe.  I would also make extra sauce just to pour overtop after.

It was awesome and so simple to make, I found the recipe the same night I made them, they are better than any restaurant buffalo wings and cheaper! I'm never buying restaurant buffalo wings again! Thank you! It's a family favorite now!

These were tasty.  I liked the zip of vinegar.  I found we had to eat them right away as they lost there crispness when they sat.  I am still looking for a healther/baked version of Buffalo wing.

Another excellent buffalo wing sauce.  We decided this would be considered 'medium' at our local wing place (BW3).  The tablespoon of vinegar was a nice touch, giving the sauce a tang.

These were awesome!!! I tweaked it a bit because we  like it a little hotter and a lot of ppl said it wasn't spicy.  I doubled the recipe EXCEPT the hot sauce was XTRA hot, I also added 1/2tsp of garlic powder and I left the vinegar at 1 TBLS.  This recipe beat ANY (and I've tried a lot!!!) that I've tried.  These are FIRE!!!!

I just got finished eating these wings, and they were PERFECT! I definitely prefer hot wings without a flour breading. I used the sauce as is, other than adding a little garlic powder. I also used about 1/4 cup regular Frank's hot sauce, 1/4 Xtra Hot Frank's sauce, and I only had white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. This sauce was exactly what I've been trying for - after trying several other recipes, I am glad I found this one. One other note - I used margarine, which I think is better. Butter is too overpowering, in my opinion. Thanks for a perfect recipe!!

My husband loved these!! I breaded them with bread crumbs before frying and cut up boneless chicken instead of wings - they were a hit in my house! Goes great with Bill's Blue Cheese recipe I found on this site!!

I had a bet with my teenaged son that I could make better wings than Domino's pizza, and after comparing a copycat recipe on the web, found that this is pretty much what ingredients they use. Of course, now that I won the bet I'll be making these forever!! At least we'll be saving tons of $$. Fabulous recipe that is almost foolproof too.

Great recipe!  Wings came out great and I got a lot of compliments.  Also my husband usually gets intestinal problems (if you know what I mean) when he eats hot wings, but he loved these and didn't suffer any bad side effects!

This was a great recipe.  I used chicken strips instead of the wings and I dredged them in flour before frying.  My husband and I didn't think it was hot enough though, so next time I will use more hot sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

i baked wings @ 400 degrees for 60 minutes. and pretty much followed recipe. put in double vinagar, a bit of honey, and tablespoon whistershire. I didn't think there would be enough sauce but there was plenty to mix with wings. stirred wings around in sauce for about 3-4 minutes and they wuz perfection. gonna keep the recipe.

Husband absolutely loved.  I'm more of a 4ish, but then again I'm not a buffalo wing nut like he is (grin).  For mine, I added a splash of honey, a dribble of Worcestershire, and then a squirt of ketchup ... As far as the rest of the procedure went (for my records, sorry) went ahead and baked earlier in the morning, then when it came time to eat, tossed in sauce and ran under the broiler.  Came out nice and juicy and not dry at all (big fear).  Thanks so much for recipe!  Oh - I did only simmer for about 5 to 8 minutes as I was worried about the spiciness.  Next time go to 15 minutes or so........

This was perfect just as written!  The only change I made was adding a bit of crushed garlic to the butter in the sauce and everyone loved these wings.  I used Louisiana Hot Sauce and was generous when measuring.  It had just enough heat after simmering about 10 minutes - tasty but not overpowering.  Will definitely be making these again.  So fast, east and delicious!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe. The sauce was completely on the money, I did however add a litte extra vingegar to lessen the extremeness of the hot sauce. But my boyfriend loves hot stuff and totally loved the recipe.

Wonderful!  I sprinkled seasoning salt on my wings and baked them from frozen state for 10 min, turned them and baked for another 10, turned them, sprayed with Pam and baked for another 10.  I only used 3 tbsp Frank's Hot Sauce because my kids don't like them too spicy.  I simmered these for 15 min and put them back under the broiler quick to crisp.  Everyone loved these.  I will add 4 tbsp hot sauce next time. They were so tender.

I made this for a football tailgate and it was a huge hit!! I fried the wings at home. Then in a foil (throw away) loaf pan I placed the butter, hot sauce, vinegar on the bottom and the fried wings on top. I seasoned the wings when they came out of the fryer so I didn't add additional salt and pepper. When it came time we put the pan on the grill and waited until it was hot enough to eat. It was fantastic!

I don't give 5 stars often. I'm from NY state and I grew up eating wings like this! Now that I live in Montreal I can't find them. Thanks for the recipe! Now I can make them at home whenever the craving strikes! YUMMY!

I have used this recipe a hundred times. Great as is, or easy to tweak - with some garlic powder, seasoned salt, Old Bay, lemon pepper or whatever you like. 
I use frozen wings and fry them for an extra 6-8 minutes. Let 'em get a little crispy before putting them in the hot sauce.  Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I made these exactly as the recipe stated (except I doubled the sauce as there wasn't enough).  They were very good except I found them too salty.  Next time I make these I will not add any salt and I will use unsalted butter.  My husband RAVED and RAVED about these and even sent me an email this AM about them...still raving.  We are low-carb-ers and these have 0 carbs so I will be making these again and again.  Excellent!!!!

Perfect! 

Like other reviewers, I also added a little flour to the butter mixture and also some garlic powder. Less hot sauce because I am a "sissy".  The wings were so good!

Made this for my husband and his brothers.  They all thought the sauce  was great.  I did add flour to it to thicken it and let it simmer a long time.

I made these for the Super Bowl XL.  My husband didn't like them and he likes almost everything!  Sauce wasn't thick enough and just wasn't very tasty.  I won't make this again.

Great recipe.  Cooking the sauce and wings after the deep fryer is the secret!  Just sauce doesn't have the same flavor and doesn't stick to the wings.

The sauce turned out pretty well, and since I used a milder hot sauce, they weren't too spicy.  My 18-month-old niece kept begging mommy and daddy for more chicken.  I also added some garlic to the sauce, which I thought added a good touch.  These turned out great and everyone was happy.

We loved this recipe!  I doubled the ingredients for 40 wings, used half the vinger, and simmered for about 15 mins.  I also put a light coat of  flour on them before frying to help absorb the sauce.  These were awesome.

I followed exactly what it said, but it wasn't very spicy. Also, I think the vinegar was too overpowering. I used Frank's Buffalo Wings Sauce. My brother and sister didn't think it was that great. I guess I will try it again next time and tweak the ingredients.

If you don't like these, you don't like buffalo wings.  I baked for 50 minutes (25 mins each side) coated with butter and flour to get around frying.  I'll fry next time because I'd like them to be crunchy.  The sauce is EXACT!

Excellent wings.  I read past reviews complaining it was not spicy enough, so I added more hot sauce and even a dash of cayenne.  Boy did it make it spicy, almost too spicy!  I think I'll just stick with the original and add a dash or two more.

The base recipe was great! Added a little cajun spice for a little more zip. Mixed this wtih about an equal amount of barbecue sauce for an interesting taste.

My guy thought these were great and said I should make them once a week.  I used Franks hot sauce and left the vinegar out.  I will try making them again today with the vinegar or maybe substitute jalapeno juice.  I think they could have been a little hotter.

Very good!  I grilled the wings instead of frying them.  They weren't really very hot, but I am from green chili country!  I put them in the crock pot to keep them warm until game time.  Everybody loved them!

these were pretty good. i simmered them in the crock pot, and i had to double the sauce recipe to get all the wings coated.  they just weren't really all that hot...maybe i needed to simmer longer, or maybe next time i'll buy a hotter hot sauce.  overall though, this is a good, easy, quick recipe.  thanks :)

Very easy to make.   A couple of quick notes.   Dust very lightly with corn starch, then fry as directed.   Add the melted butter and hot sauce (and honey if using) into a large bowl.   When wings are done, dump them into the bowl and shake to coat.   Add salt and pepper and you’ll have the best wings you ever tasted.  The corn starch gives a nice crispness to the wings.

A very light sift of flour gave a crisp crunch!

These are awesome! My husband is a huge wing fan and he is still raving about these! I made 2 minor adjustments. ...I baked them instead of frying and I added some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it abit so it would stick to the wings more. My husband said he these are the best wings ever!

I am not a wing fan but I made these for my husband. He claims they are the best he's ever had. I must confess, they looked and smelled so good, I had to try them too. Delicious (and just so you know, I usually say ICK)! This recipe is a keeper, and I will make wings this way from now on till forever!

Fantastic!  I baked mine on a rack over a cookie sheet on 425 for 40 minutes, then turned it up to 450 for the remaining 5-10 minutes.  They crisped up nicely.  I put all the wings in a large bowl and poured the sauce over to coat.  Much cheaper than take-out and just as good, if not better!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love the sauce for these wings. I usually fix 24 wings so I double the sauce and add 2 cloves of garlic to let the wings simmer in. The only other thing that I do different is I BBQ the wings first on a grill and then I simmer them in the sauce for about one half hour. LOVE EM!

Being from Buffalo NY, this is pretty much it. Use Franks Red Hot if ya can, and fry in peanut oil if you have it. Always dip in blue cheese, never ranch!

Perfect recipe for perfect wings. Now on game days i get out my deep fryer and make wings. I only purchase party wings from the stores so I dont have to do the extra step of cutting the wings before frying.

This is just the recipe I was looking for when trying to make a wing sauce. I use Frank's Red Hot, butter, vinegar, and salt/pepper.... then add grilled chicken and put in a wrap. So yummy!

This is a great recipe. I made it for my husband last night. Next time I will put more hot sauce...I also coated the chicken lightly with some flour then fried it till it was nice and golden. I simmered it in the sauce for maybe 10 to 15 minutes. My husband who does not normally eat the wing of the chicken loved this and we will certainly make this time and time again.. Thanks

Excellent. I made a few changes as some people have suggested. I dusted the chicken with flour before frying. I used about a tablespoon of flour to the butter mixture. I used Texas Pete's Buffalo Style BBQ sauce. I also broil them a couple of minutes to make them crispier. I highly recommend Marie's Chunky Bleu Cheese dressing for that finishing touch.

Easily the best wings you'll taste!  I like to add about half a cup of sweet and smokey BBQ sauce (Sonny's is best, you can buy it Sam's) and a couple dashes of garlic powder for more of a robust flavor.  Just perfect!

I asked my husband to rate these since I don't like buffalo wings.  He said they needed a little more kick to them.  Not quite hot enough to suit his tastes.  He likes the flavor though, just not enough heat.

This was a great recipe! I did tweak it a little because I don't like wing meat - I used chicken tender strips instead. I also added more vinegar and Frank's Hot Sauce and used much less oil - sauteed them in a skillet. Great flavor but as others said the sauce was a little thin. I will try adding flour to thicken it a bit more and will let it marinade longer next time for more flavor. They were great the next day!

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl party and EVERYONE loved it. I used more seasoning tho, I seasoned the wings before I fried them with seasoned salt and pepper.  I also Used more seasoning in the sauce, seasoned salt pepper, cumin, chilli powder garlic powder, ect.  Recipe was simple and turned out great!

I made these for a Superbowl party and the sauce was so thin, it ran right off the chicken.  If you dipped the chicken in the sauce, it was a wonderful taste!  I will make this again, but need to figure out how to make the sauce stick without breading the chicken.

This receipe is really good...and I am a wing lover, so I have had wings from many different restaurants.  I followed the recipe to a "T", using whole wings from the meat dept that I cut apart.  They were never frozen; I'm not sure it that made a difference.  The sauce was excellent, not quite spicy enough for me, but just enough so that the wings weren't "swimming."  The next time I make them, I will find a way to spice them up a bit more.  I used Texas Pete sauce this time.  I also let the wings simmer in the sauce for a while.  Very good, moist and delicious! I had company over and everyone agreed!

Awesome recipe.  I've made it several times, and my recommendation is Crystal brand hot sauce ... just seems to have a perfect "not-too-hot, not-too-mild" flavor.  Quick and easy.

Mmm, mmm, mmm! This was the first fried chicken recipe I've made and they are a great way to start off! I used chicken drumsticks instead of wings and the sauce/coating was great! They were also delicious cold the next day. Wonderful recipe!

Wow!  Simple and tasty!  My tips for a spicy, spciy wing sauce...simmer in sauce pan while oil is heating: 1/4 cup lite margarine, 1/3 cup Frank's Red Hot Sauce, 1 tbsp Tabasco, 1.5 tsp garlic powder, 1.5 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp black pepper.  I deep-fried the wings (I used a dozen) for about 12 minutes (nice and crispy), then tossed in sauce.  Yum, yum, yum.  Thanks for the recipe!  No more store-bought sauces at our house!

These were a hit. I was really scared about adding 5 tbs. of hot sauce (were not really keen on too spicy) but these were great. Just enough spice. I took another reviewers suggestion and made sure I bought "Franks" hot sauce. Really good!

This was the BEST wings I have ever had! I baked my wings like someone else said, and then I broiled them with the hot sause to make them more crispy. Next time I might add more hot sause. I like them REALLY hot. But they were GREAT!!

This got rave reviews at our Superbowl party although I doubled the recipe and then doubled the butter on top of that--if not, it would've been just too hot!  (could've been my hot sauce and not the recipe itself).  We 'Fry Daddied' the wings first and they were nice and crispy.

The sauce is what makes this recipe great!  I didn't fry the chicken wings, but skinned and baked them then tossed them in the sauce and served them with bleu cheese.  They were fantastic!  And so easy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is great recipe and as close as you're going to get 
to the taste of real buffalo chicken wings.  I grew
up outside of Buffalo and living in CA now I don't
get to eat real Buffalo wings often.  So i use this
recipe to make my own.  Instead of frying the wings
I make them on the grill.  They taste  great!

This was a hit at a cookout last night!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and deep fried them only 7 minutes.  Then threw them in a crockpot for a couple of hours.  Much easier to eat and they didn't last long!  You can also use a bottle of ready made Buffalo Chicken Sauce if your store carries it, and it still works great.

This is by far the best recipe I have found for wings. My family and friends can't get enough! I only made one change - I did not simmer wings in sauce after they were fried - toss the wings in the sauce. If you let them simmer, they become soggy. Who likes soggy wings! Without the simmering in the sauce, these wings have great flavor and are nice and crispy! I will be making these for the big game today! GO PATS!

Very much like the real Buffalo wings found in restaurants throughout the upstate NY area. Crispy and delicious!  Serve with chunky blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, of course!

This buffalo wings recipe was great!! The sauce was spot on for a spicy, flavorable wing sauce. I would suggest the frying time to be more like 15 minutes for a crispier wing.

I've been making these for years both at home and in restaurants. This is a great recipe as close to original as you can get. Here are a couple things that I change in mine. First never use butter always margin. Butter will separate into heavy fats and light. and you can always add more hot sauce go easy at first and preferred is Franks red hot. Know your hot sauce! 3rd drain your wings out of the fryer on  cookie sheet lined with parchment and  cake cooling rack ( think reheating). Season to personal tastes I add a pinch of granulated garlic and a dash or two of Worcestershire.

I made these just as the recipe called for and there wasn't a wing left, for they were all ate. The heat was just right for me but my husband added more hot sauce to his. I will keep this recipe.

Born and raised in Buffalo but moved away. This cured the craving, but we like them very very crispy so I cook them at 400 degrees for a few minutes longer. Also didnt use vinegar in the sauce, and tossed the wings and sauce in a bowl so they didn't get soggy.

I'm from Buffalo NY ... we don't simmer the wings in the sauce, we put the sauce in a huge stainless steal mixing bowl and we toss the wings until coated. You HAVE to use Franks Hot Sauce ... that's how we do it in Bflo ... NO OTHER SUBSTITUTE ...

I loveeeeee this recipe! I have a deep fryer and followed the recipe just as it says, but I did cook them for 15mins instead of 10 and I didn't add any salt. I also made some sweet potato fries to accompany them. I love how easy this recipe is and it's so quick to prepare. Especially when you have hungry kids lol

This sauce is excellent though I prefer more sauce and spicier. I simmered for 30 minutes. Next time I will double the sauce and either simmer for 45 or possibly add more Texas Pete's.

Made these last night for my husbands birthday and they came out so good. The recipe is so simple to follow and such few ingredients but such a great result. My husbands only criticism was they they weren't spicy enough, I used Franks Red Hot sauce for wings but next time I will try the regular Franks hot sauce.

Super good and super easy. I deep fried my wings from frozen for 15 mins at 375. Kept the batches warm in a 200 degree oven, then tossed them in the sauce, to which I added a touch of honey, because I love me some sweet n hot wings!

Great Sauce, not enough for 24 wings so next time, I will make a little more. It tasted very well when I seasoned chicken and baked them for 15-20min and then coated them with sauce, then baked them for another  15-20min. Wish I had another batch of sauce to make them even more spicy but was still very yummy !

This recipe is fantastic.  I've made it several times.  The only changes I've made are adding a dash of Tabasco and a tablespoon of flour to the sauce.    The flour thickens the sauce nicely and makes it take on this exciting red/orange color.  I've also experimented with different herbs and spices.  I use Frank's Red Hot for the main hot sauce.

These were quite possibly the best buffalo wings I ever had. I can hardly believe I myself made them. And it was so quick and easy too. Only difference I made in the recipe is I brined the chicken wings in salt and pepper water for an hour and then I cooked following the directions. These were so good my son and I are probably going to finish all 24 pieces today. Easiest recipe in the world. Now to find a good blue cheese dip recipe.

Very tasty and simple to make,  I marinated the wings in the hot sauce for 2-3 hours before deep frying.  Also, I found out as suggested the longer you let them soak in sauce the saucier they get.

We had last minute guests over visiting from Asia and Europe so we wanted a very quick and American appetizer and took our chance on this. They were an absolute hit.  They were easy, fast, and very tasty. Better than restaurants! Thanks for saving our night!

I did this for a Thanksgiving afternoon snack. It taste ok, but it does not look as good as I ordered from the pizzria .My friends and I think the sauce needed  to be a little bit thicker than it was.

Very good, basic Buffalo wings recipe.  I probably didn't let the wings simmer for long enough, but what can I say?  I was hungry and they looked so good.  The wings weren't as hot as I like, but I'd rather have them turn out too mild than too hot.  I deep fat fried the wings, which didn't take long--maybe 4 to 5 minutes per batch.  My son and his buddy Carl thought they were excellent.  My son rated them an "8" on a 1 to 10 scale.  Not really a "3" and not really a "4," so I'm rating this recipe a "4," because it's a great base to work from.

I used frozen wings so it took a little longer to cook. After my chicken was cooking, I realized I was out of butter and margarine, so I used olive oil in place of butter. I mixed it in with the hot sauce and I couldn't tell any difference.

This recipe was really good.  The wings had a good flavor, and you can get them as hot or as mild as you like.  I did use more sauce than the recipe called for.  I wanted to make sure the wings were thoroughly coated.

Excellent! We are true wing fanatics and like ours a bit hotter, so we add fire, but this is a FAB recipe to get you started. This is a perfect recipe for beginning wing eaters or, as my 13 year old says, "sissies". LOL. I wouldn't change a thing except to kick it up a notch! I just bought more wings today to make this again!

I probably should've simmered my chicken longer.  This didn't have a whole lot of heat to it.  I also didn't use wings.  I was making chicken breast sandwiches for dinner, and decided to try to spice things up using this sauce.  I will probably try it again making sure to let the chicken simmer in the sauce longer.  Also, I felt the vinegar was a little strong in this, but that could've been the hot sauce I used, too.

Made these for New Year's Eve and they are the real deal!  I controlled the heat for the kids and added extra tabasco for the adults!  THANKS!

This recipe is excellent.  I used a whole bottle of Franks Original Hot Sauce for 5lbs of weeks for New Years eve Party.  Everyone loved them!  I did fry mine in the 2 quarts of oil instead of baking.  Excellent for anyone on the low carb diet!
