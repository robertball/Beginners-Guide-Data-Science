After the yogurt process is finished in the IP,  I pour into one of those yogurt strainers and leave for 3-4 hours in the refrigerator, and before  ladling  into jars. I pour the strained yogurt  into a bowl, add  vanilla and honey then  and beat with hand mixer until smooth (this does not take long) and ladle into jars. It is terrific!

I used 1/4 cup of plain Fage 2% Greek yogurt as my starter and ommitted the vanilla so I could use this in savory recipes as well.  Method was great, spoon stood up in the Instant Pot after it was finished.

If you have an instant pot and like yogurt, try this! I poured boiling water in the pot and let it sit for a minute before starting recipe and will be sure to do this next time. 
I whisked yogurt before and after process, it came out very smooth. Also, I used 1/2 gallon of milk, and Trader Joeâ€™s plain Greek yogurt as starter.
