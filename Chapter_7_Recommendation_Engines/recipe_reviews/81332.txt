This was a fantastic quick dinner. My husband is a picky eater and he enjoyed it as well. Nice change from a plain tuna sandwich but just as easy!

Oh my gosh!  This was wonderful!  We have eaten it a few times and it is one of my husband's favorite meals.  I only had Peach and Mango salsa from Costco in my fridge and that is what I used.   Super.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would!

I thought this recipe was great. I just got done eating it. But instead of using wraps, I used pita bread and it was delicious! I love tuna, and for any tuna lovers out there like me, I recommend this recipe.

These were great. They made a quick, healthy dinner. The leftover tuna mixture was great on carrot sticks.

This is a good base, but this really needs some spices or something to jazz it up. Maybe some hot sauce or lime juice would do the trick....cilantro even...?

Not bad, but not great either.  At first, I thought "These are really pretty good", but the more I ate the more it just tasted like tuna in a can.  I would use sour cream instead of mayyonaise I think. If you love tuna, you may love these, but I am not a tuna "lover".

We actually do NOT like tuna around here, but this was great!! I got the recipe about three days ago and have made it twice! I put some chopped celery in it and it was great! Inexpensive and quick dinner to make on the spot for a starving husband. Thanks so much!
