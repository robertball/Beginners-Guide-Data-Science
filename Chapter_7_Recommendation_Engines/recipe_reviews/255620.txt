Very tasty and cute when stuffed into hollowed out new potatoes. Popular with men and women. Info for the poster who left the ugly remark about the recipe's poster: prepared spinach and artichoke dip is available in most grocery store deli sections. I made my own, but in a pinch would use pre-made. Let's be nice to each other.

Serious comfort food that delivers all the warm, gooey, cheesy, savory goodness you could possibly handle. I want to eat another one right now.

I made this with fingerling potatoes and people loved em! You can also microwave the potatoes first to speed up the process. I may add jalape√±os or green onions in the mix next time.

These are incredible! I want to eat them every day. I'm thinking about experimenting with the cheese, maybe adding goat cheese into the mix!

If you're looking for a decadent treat, this is it!  A delicious mashup of twice baked potatoes and spinach artichoke dip.  it hits all the right notes for an appetizer.  Though you could eat a whole half on your own, I don't recommend it (too rich).

So easy to bake potatoes while you're doing another chore, then assemble the spinach dip with the carved out potato pulp. Sprinkle cheese on top & pop them back in the oven. Can keep in refrigerator and serve on later days in the week. Delicioso!

I used Tostitos Creamy Spinach dip instead of Spinach-Artichoke dip and it was so easy to make and tasted great.

At 350 degrees it took a lot more time to bake. IWe loved the flavor and will definitely make again but use higher temperature.

I will definitely make this again.  We reheated some the next day and it was just as good.

OMG!! Thank you so much for sharing this super easy, super delicious recipe.  Someone wanted to know where to buy the ready-made Spinach-Artichoke dip.  COSTCO.  Or most grocery stores in their deli department where the hummus is kept.  The only difference in my making this dish is that I didn't have the Keri Gold Irish Cheddar but used Pepper Jack.  Came out just as delish and a bit spicier.  This will be an appetizer dish for my Thanksgiving and Christmas Dinner and any other time I want to make a big impression.  There is absolutely no way you can mess this recipe -- it's that easy.  Again, THANK YOU LESLIE.
