I made this for my family and we enjoyed it as a main dish. My toddler loved it, as did everyone! It's a yummy way to enjoy a big plateful of veggies as a main dish, and a great way to get kids to eat their veg. The crumble topping was especially delicious. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Pretty good. I would probably increase milk to 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups. I would make again. I used panko for the breadcrumbs. Liked the 5 spice in the topping.
