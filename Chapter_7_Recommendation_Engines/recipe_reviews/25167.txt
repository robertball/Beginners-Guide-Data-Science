I added LaChoy rice noodles spinkled over the top for some extra crunch and also diced in some orange (or red) sweet peppers.  They added to the color and I liked their sweetness.

kind of bland. Next time I'll double the vinegar and apricot jam. I used mandarin oranges instead of apricots and added some almonds.

I thought this was bland.  Adding salt helped, but it was still lacking

Hubby really like this, it was a bit too sweet for me - but that is just me, everyone else really enjoyed it.  I had to use dried apricots, fresh were not available and when they are, they aren't so good.  This was a good substitution.  I served it on lettuce as suggested but this would be good in a wrap.  Chopped toasted pecans would be a wonderful addition.
