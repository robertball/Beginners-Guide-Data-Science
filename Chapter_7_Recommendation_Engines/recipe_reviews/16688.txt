I tried this recipe because I am just learning how to cook. It was easy but came out bland. The packaged vegetables do not mix well with the flavor of the Italian spiced tomatoes.

This was an excellent change from what we normally do with chicken.  I used unflavored diced tomatoes instead of the italian diced tomatoes.  I flavord it with a bit of italian seasoning.  I also only used corn instead of mixed veggies.  My picky son, daughter and husband ate it right up.

Spiced it up a bit as others did with onions and garlic. Added chicken broth, stewed tomatoes, mixed veg. and seasonings. Simmered and shredded chicken. I thickened the sauce with flour. Served over rice. Hubby loved it. Will make again.

I changed the recipe a bit, I let it simmer with the lid on the skillet, as well as added some roasted garlic tomato sauce.  the tomato sauce made it too soupy but, it was still pretty good.  My husband loved it so I will probably make it again for him.
