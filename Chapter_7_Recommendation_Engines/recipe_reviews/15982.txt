Very good recipe! I used puff pastry. I did not have ricotta and used feta instead and the result was delicious!

YUM, this is definitely a keeper.
I used just a single pie crust and it was plenty of crust.  I used feta instead of ricotta and threw in some extra parmesan, plus a splash of milk to make it creamier... I also didn't have onions, but I added some onion salt as well as diced tomatoes, olives, and garlic.  It turned out very tasty and flavorful!

This was a hit! Thanks I don't know why but I put in two eggs instead of one, and it was great with feta! Great as a left over too!

The first time I made a pie, and a party of three loved it.
What did I learn about pie making?
1. "recipe pastry" just means the pastry you need for that receipe .
2.  You need to roll out the pastry sheet, so do that early in the process.
3 You should oil the pastry tray first.
4  750g of cheese sounds like a lot - three tubs - but it was needed and two bunches of spinach is enormous in Australia - I just used one and that was like a mountain in the fry pan.

Good lessons, great pie, more than half left over.

Eh...I made a crustless version. It was quick & easy, but not very flavourful. I sauteed 2 minced garlic cloves and added italian seasoning, cumin and pepper flakes to the cheese mixture. And still, it was just cheesy spinach.  Not even quiche like (which was kind of what I was hoping for).  Sorry, but not a keeper.

I make a lot of changes to attempt to lighten this recipe.  I used 10 sheets of phyllo dough rather than pie crust.  I simply sprayed with butter cooking spray and layering 5 sheets each for the top and bottom.  I then decreasedt he opin and added 3 oz of reduced fat feta.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.  Our 4 yo wouldn't touch it.

Here is the problem with spinach you eat it and you want it all.  I just added red pepper flakes to make it spicy.

We were pleasantly surprise by this recipe, we really enjoyed it! I used a 300 g package of frozen spinach that I squeezed dry.  A 454 g tub of ricotta. For the pastry Buttery Flaky Pie Crust from Allrecipes. For seasoning I used Greek seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and Mrs. Dash, I omitted the salt and I am glad I did the Parmesan made it quite salty.

I added 3/4 c of feta cheese to this and it was fantastic.  My husband loved it.
