Aside from the draining time, this is a quick and flavorful recipe. Simple ingredients that I always have on hand. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare tofu, so thank you for the new idea!

Sometimes the best things donâ€™t have to be complicated! I followed the recipe exactly, and served it with a veggie stir fry and rice. Everyone enjoyed their dinner, including my two toddlers. I will definitely be keeping this in my arsenal. I used a cast iron skillet and timed 3 min per side.
