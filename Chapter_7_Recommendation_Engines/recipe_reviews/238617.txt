This is a really nice light tasting dish that just feels fresh when you are eating it.   I can't explain that, it just does.   I can definitely see me making this again.  Thank you BW!

This made for an easy, fresh, and flavorful dinner! I simmered the cauliflower in the sauce  about 20 minutes. I decided not to broil  the cheese this time because it smelled so delicious I couldn't wait any longer. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is a quick and easy side dish I came up with to utilize a jar of tomato sauce and not wanting pasta. Its great for those on a low-carb diet or can be eaten with a main dish. I tried to keep it simple and the flavors fresh. I hope you enjoy!

This was great!  A new way to cook cauliflower is always appreciated.  I followed recipe except I used an Italian blend of cheese.  Can't wait to share with my low carb eating friends.

Both my husband and I liked the taste of this sauce but I found it to be a little runny to be an attractive side dish.  I elected to serve it over linguine instead and it made a different but tasty meatless main course.  The gooey broiled cheeses really added to this dish and I would not omit them as other have.  I will make this again but next time, if I want to use it as a side dish, I will simmer the sauce a bit longer before adding the cauliflower.

This is lovely way to use cauliflower! The sauce gets a bit runny but I just soaked it all up with some fresh Italian bread. Great flavor, easy to put together, and a new way to eat cauliflower (I'm always looking for new ways to incorporate it in meals). Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The best thing about cauliflower is its versatility- I did something similar to this dish but put my own twist on it! 

I first baked the cauliflower florets (an entire head because it shrinks) with diced onion, diced tomato, and chopped uncooked bacon with a light spray of EVOO and a dash of seasoning salt. I put it on a baking tray and let it roast at 425° for about 15 minutes until dark golden brown and crispy. I then took a round baking dish and  first put a spoon full of sauce, then the cauliflower mix, Portuguese sausage, parmesan cheese, fresh chopped basil, then Prego Roasted Garlic sauce (it was what I had in my pantry, but chicken and white sauce would be good too!), and repeated until all the fixins were in the dish. I then took some home made bread crumbs and left over cheese to cover the top and baked again at 425° for about 15 minutes until the cheese was browned. It turned out great and hubby loved it (he's my guinea pig for new recipes). It went well with Hahn wine too! It was a great "baked pasta" dish but fewer carbs. 

Cauliflower can be used in lieu of or in conjunction with breads, pizza crust, pasta, mac n' cheese, or any carb- heavy dish. 

Hope you will try and enjoy!
