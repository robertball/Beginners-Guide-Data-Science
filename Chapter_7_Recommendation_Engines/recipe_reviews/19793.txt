I made this with 6 ounces of semisweet chocolate, reduced the water to 3 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of butter to it. Very yummy.

This is the best hot fudge sauce I have ever made!  I didn't need to add the water.  I have made it with both unsweetened and semi-sweet chocolate.  Slightly different flavors--both excellent!

This recipe tastes more like chocolate pudding than Fudge sauce.  Water can be eliminated for a thicker sauce.  Good recipe for kids, not for hot fudge sundaes.

A great quick and easy fudge recipe with minimal ingredients. I use 4 oz unsweetened because, well... why not!  I like to add coffee instead of the water for a great mocha taste. I also let is cool completely before storing in the fridge. It helps it from getting a grainy texture when reheating.

I Made with no water and it was thick, creamy and everyone at my party was astonished it was homemade.  The hot fudge brownie sundaes were a hit!

I used more chocolate and kept it over the d.boiler longer for a thicker sauce and left out the water.  

This was awesome!  Made Sunday's for T.G., it was a hit and gone quickly.  Thank you so much for the great recipe.  Now I known what to do with those cans of s.c. milk :)  Yummy!!!!!!!

Great sauce! Not as fudgy as some, but still excellent and easy to make.  I don't have a double boiler, so I just rested one pan inside of the other, sort of crooked.  Worked just fine.  I added only a very little bit of water to mine and it came out the perfect consistency.

I was disappointed in this hot fudge sauce. It was very runny and not very fudgy tasting. I probably wouldn't make it again.

I thought this was very good and easy to make.  I have made it twice.  First with the original recipe and the second time with low fat sweetened condensed milk to "lighten" it up a bit.  The lighter version tasted just as good.

I found this sauce to be okay, but it could have been much better. It tastes more like brownie batter, rather than hot fudge from an ice cream shop. It could be darker and richer.

How easy! No need to cook! Empty the can of sweetened condensed milk in a bowl, spoon in 9 T. cocoa powder plus 3 T. oil (that is the equivalent of 3 sq. of unsweetened chocolate - I used this amount because of reviewer's comments that 2 sq. were not enough chocolate). Add the salt and vanilla.  Do not add water.  Stir well and you are done! Absolutely fabulous!

This is the Best hot fudge you will ever have!  I make this for my kids, and they never want the fake and expensive stuff from the store anymore, I don't add any water.  It may also be done on the stove top on low heat, stirring constantly.

It's important to use 2 total ounces of unsweetened chocolate.  For the Ghirardelli 100% cacao bar that I used, that was 4 squares, not 2.  This yielded rich, thick chocolate results.  I did add some water, not the full 1/2 cup though.  I put some of the sauce in another container and added some Grand Marnier instead of water for the adults - heavenly!!!

I have tried many fudge sauce recipes and this is the best.  Very easy to make.  If cooked for the full 10 minutes, it thickens up very nicely.  I ended up using almost all the water it called for and it was still pretty thick.  I will definitely make this again.

I had half a can of condensed milk I needed to use up and was thrilled when I stumbled upon this recipe.  Made half recipe as directed (except only used about 3T of water) and I felt it was simply wonderful.  Mine only took about 5 minutes from start to finish.  Thanks so much!

Made this tonight for hot fudge sundaes and it is great!  I don't have a double boiler, so I used another reviewer's suggestion and used a small saucepan on direct heat and stirred it constantly while cooking.  I increased the chocolate to 3 squares and only used about 1/4 cup of water.  Delicious!  Thank you for a great, easy recipe!

I have this same basic recipie, but mine does not call for water, salt or vanilla, only the sweetened condensed milk and 2 chocolate squares. Everytime I make it, everyone thinks it is wonderful. I will usually thin it a little with either half and half or heavy cream.

First time making Fudge Sauce and this was the perfect recipe.  I only added some of the water and it was great on our ice cream.  No need to go to Baskin Robbins anymore.

Would have given this 5 stars, but I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used 3 oz. semi sweet bakers chocolate, added 1/4 cup butter, and omitted the water. Added all ingredients to the double boiler and stirred with a spatula until melted. Once the chocolate completely melted, I used a whisk to make sure the chocolate was velvety smooth. Once it cooled, it was very thick and creamy! I remember having hot fudge sauce like this when I was a kid, and have never been able to find anything as good since...until now! Sooooooo good if you like really thick and creamy fudge sauce!

Of all the hot fudge sauces I have made over the years, this is the easiest and "fudge-like" I have ever tried.  I would recommend a high quality chocolate to begin with.  It makes all the difference.  Add a couple drops of peppermint flavor if you want something a

I can't understand some of the bad reviews. This is a "quick" recipe and I found the results wonderful. A lot of quick chocolate sauce recipes contain corn syrup which I don't like to use. I think this was rich and chocolately. I used just little liquid and used half & half. Delicious!

Great recipe!  I only used about 1/4 cup of water, as I like the sauce on the thick side.  The kids were thrilled to help me make it!  Thanks!

It is hot fudge!  This is a creamier recipe.  I would compare the consistency with "Mrs. Richardson's" hot fudge.  Some of the others I've used with white sugar have been good but then have a grainy consistency when cold.  I would compare those with "Hershey's" hot fudge.  I'm a sweet tooth and this is pretty sweet.  I did use 3 ounces of unsweetened baking chocolate and then for the heck of it, added in 1 tbsp. of unsweetened baking cocoa.

Great, easy, fast recipe! If you do not have a double boiler, you can place a stainless steel bowl on top of a 2 quart sauce pan with simmering water and it works great! Make sure the steel bowl is large enough that it does not fit in the pan! That way you do not need to worry about the water leaking into the pan. I was needing something chocolately and it was great to pull something together from my cupboard!  Thanks so much!

Made as directed; less water. Tasted pretty good hot. Jarred and then micro reheated a day later, got very grainy. I'll go back to my fail proof  AR Hot Fudge II

I was craving a hot fudge sundae and had everything in the house except for the fudge. Allrecipes.com to the rescue. Yay, my sweet tooth was satisfied and I'll make this the next time I need hot fudge.

Used dark bitter chocolate and more like 6 squares.  Next time id use 70% cocoa chocolate and 8 squares.  No water.  Added almond extract.  Was delicious.

I think this sauce is great!! For the people who said it was too thin maybe they made the same mistake I did the first time I tried it. I put the water in at the start and not just a little at a time like the recipe says to do. My whole family loves this recipe and we use it to make Hot Fudge Brownie delights. Yummy!

This is AMAZING!!! My boys were (unknown to me) scooping it out of the jar with a spoon in a shoveling it into their mouths!!! I didn't add the water cause I like mine thick. I loved how easy it was to make. Delicious!!!

I read some of the other reviews and modified the recipe a bit and it turned out great - just a little thick.  My family loved its richness and fudginess.  Instead of just two squares, I used four ounces of unsweetened chocolate and didn't bother chopping it.  I melted that in a small pot - I don't have a double boiler and it worked fine with a lot of stirring - with the s.c. milk, salt, and a tablespoon of butter.  It was plenty thick but I liked the consistency so I left out the water and added the vanilla after it cooled some.  I had to reheat it for dessert, and it thickened so that instead of pouring or drizzling, it glopped, so it didn't make for an especially attractive sundae sauce, but it sure tasted great!
