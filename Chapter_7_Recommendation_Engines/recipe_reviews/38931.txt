This is an excellent apple cake - and I've tried many along the years, since we have 5 apple trees in our yard. Delicate taste and wonderful texture. *****

Wonderful flavor and texture! Instead of sprinkling with powdered sugar, I frosted with the Allspice Cream Cheese frosting from this site. My bunco ladies loved it!

THIS RECIPE CAME OUT EXACTLY HOW I WANTED IT TO..VERY MOIST W/OUT IT BEING GREASY (I WANTED A RECIPE W/OUT VEG. OIL).  I USED WHOLE EVAPORATED MILK INSTEAD OF LOWFAT, USED 1 1/2 TS OF CINN. AND USED A TOPPING OF CHOPPED PECANS AND 1/4 CUP EACH OF BROWN AND WHITE SUGARS. CAME OUT DELISH..NO LEFTOVERS AT THE OFFICE!!! DEFINITELY WILL MAKE AGAIN.

Yummy, topped with a bit of ice cream! :) It was slight on the too-moist side, though..
