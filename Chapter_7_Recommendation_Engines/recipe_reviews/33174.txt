I used this recipe as a base and it worked perfectly.  I made 4 key changes:  1. I used challah instead of white bread (amazingly fluffy).  2. I used spinach instead of ham. 3. I mixed the onions and mushrooms together. 4. I added gruyere to the cheddar (also I used Cheddar from Borough Market/Neal's Dairy Yard) and it was DELICIOUS.  This was an amazing recipe. I studied many others that called for half and half and in all seriousness didn't feel like I missed a thing without it. I served this with Whole Foods 365 Maple Sausage Links and Smoked Salmon Nova and everyone seemed pleased.  Rather than put the meat in the strata.

I made this for a non-profit board meeting and while I would give it 5 stars for ease of putting together, the flavor is non-existent.  That being said, some folks did go back for "seconds" but next time I make it, I will probably doctor it up with some herbs/spices.

This recipe was just so-so to my crowd. The texture of the bread was kind of mushy, even though I used an oven thermometer and baked it the full time. Several guests said that it was "okay" as long as it was piping hot, but when it cooled off/got cold, it wasn't very good at all. I had some guests even leave half of it on their plate.

I made this recipe for breakfast for my family and while it was extremely easy to make the flavor was bland. I was going to take this for Easter brunch and am glad I tried it first. I did my own version which turned out much better. Instead of using bread I used 1 1/2 boxes of garlic and herb croutons. I also used swiss cheese instead of cheddar and 1/2 heavy cream, 1/2 milk. This made it much richer. It is a good recipe just needed some spicing up! :)

This recipe was certainly tasty.  I think ham should be put in the middle as well as on top and it could also benefit from more cheese and some salt with paprika dashed on top.  I cut the recipe in half and baked in a round cassarole dish.  I think my dish was a tad too deep because it did come out a little sloppy.  Next time I'll bake it in a larger dish and not make each layer as deep.

Cooking time was not long enough. When I first took off the aluminum foil, the cheese in the center wasn't even melted. I ended up turning the oven up to 375 and leaving it in another 15-20 minutes longer that in the recipe. But it was a big hit at our Christmas breakfast!

This dish turned out very nicely. I have made other variations of it before and have found that letting the bread sit out for a day (so it won't be too soft or mushy) before tearing the pieces up in preparation. I added a little garlic powder and onion powder to the recipe and also added (canned) mild green chili slices in between the first cheese layer and under the cheese in the last layer. Turned out nice and souffle' like. Yum.

A variation of this recipe has been a tradition in my family for 25 years.  I make is early Christmas Eve and put it in the refrigerator.  On Christmas morning) we get up (really early!) and I put it in the oven @ 350 for 70 minutes.  By the time presents are opened and the mess  is cleaned up it's time to eat!

My recipe uses toasted bread and we like lots of blotted, crumbled bacon  I add previously-cooked hashbrowns (nice and golden brown!)in the morning before it goes in the oven.

My grandkids now look forward to Christmas morning just like their Mom or Dad did a generation ago!

It's a great family tradition!

I used this recipe because I lost my mother-in-law's recipe, but the result was even better!  I got many raves for this one.  Perfection!  P.S. Don't tell the mother-in-law.  :-)

This was fabulous! I did use sourdough bread, substituted lean hot turkey sausages instead of the ham and used 1/2 cheedar cheese mixed with 1/2 swiss instead od straight cheddar. It was so good. Everyone in the house loved this. I will make this, again!

We were looking for a breakfast dish using the leftover ham from yesterday and Voila!  Prepared & put in frig last night and baked this morning!  Very, very good.  I was hesitant about a "soggy bread" dish, but WOW!  Added a little extra ham & cheese and cooked for about 5 minutes longer and increased temp to 375 for the uncovered baking.

I have had many versions of this before and was comfortable substituting ingredients.  Iused medium spicy sausage, precooked instead of ham.  I only used 3 pieces of bread, 7 eggs, and 1 1/4 cup of milk.  I only used about 2/3 cups of shredded cheese.  I also added in some fresh chopped spinach, 1/4 cup, for color.  I used 1 tsp hot sauce and and one tbsp prepared mustard and no mushrooms or green pepper or onion.  Yummy!

This is a great recipe.  You can vary the ingredients easily:  sausage, spinach, etc.  When I make this, it disappears!  It's a good brunch recipe plus a great way to utilize stale bread.  It works as a supper dish, too, with no complaints.

I've made this many times. I double the onion and diced it very fine and chop up my fresh mushrooms and fry together in one T. butter until onion is just limp. I top this casserole with fresh tomotoes and sprinkle on Tabasco sauce.  Yum....

So good!  I did have to make some changes.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I added zucchini, sauted them along w/ the onions (my husband hates raw onions) and threw in some tomatos.  Read the instructions before hand!  Oh...we also topped it w/ salsa after it was cooked....GOOD STUFF!

I made this with sausage instead of the ham.  I omitted the green pepper.  It was good.  When I told my sister what I was making, she turned up her nose.  She ended up having seconds!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used mushrooms, asparagus, sharp cheddar, smoked Gouda and left out the ham.  Everyone loved it.  It's a keeper!

The flavor was great, but the cook time was not long enough. In the recommended time, it came out mushy and runny. I had to put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes to fully cook the eggs.

I can describe this dish in 2 words; delicious and EASY!!!  I made this on Christmas eve so that I wouldn't have to wake up and cook on Christmas morning.  It was so easy to prepare and very delicious.  I did however. only use 8 oz. of cheese instead of 16 oz. and that was plenty of cheese.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  I would definately make this again.  For a little kick you might want to use Pepper Jack cheese.

I really liked this, and so did my guests. The preparation was easy the night before, and it baked in the time suggested..I served it in the morning with a little mixed fresh fruit. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit with our family. It was very  tasty, but for me it lacked a little something... maybe some chives or something? It's a keeper tho and I plan on fixing it again during the holidays when family is here.

I've made similar breakfast dishes but this is the best ever.  I did add some seasoning since others called it bland.  Salt, pepper and a little seasoning salt was all it took.   Made it the night before and just popped it in the over.  Perfect!!

My mother has had this (little different variation) for Christmas brunch for probably 20 years. We just love, love it. She never tore the bread, just buttered slices, then cut it into squares to serve. I will say that in my experience the cooking time is too short. I take it out of the refrigerator first thing in the morning and sit it on the counter till almost room temperature. That cuts down on the cooking time. And don't rush to serve it. It stays VERY hot if you make it with cheese.

Pretty good! Sauteed the veggies first, which prolonged the prep. Added garlic salt. Halved the recipe (eggs, bread, milk - kept veggies the same) and baked in 8x8 dish. Mine looked gorgeously puffy when it came out of the oven, but then "fell" 5 minutes later. Any tips for how to avoid this?

This was very good and so easy to make.  I was only able to refrigerate it for about 4 hrs. and it came out fine.  I also added 1 chopped up jalapeño pepper, with seeds, to spice it up a little.  The adults liked this, the kids did not give it a fair shake.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 for a family of 4 and baked in a 7 x 11 pan.

I used 1 lb french bread slices (toasted for the base) and cubes for the top layer. I did not have mushrooms or peppers so I did without. I did add 1 tsp mustard and 1 tsp garlic powder and about 1/2 tsp seasoned salt to the egg milk mixture. With that much bread it cooked faster than I expected. It was beautiful toasty brown with I took the foil off after 35 min. I know I changed the recipe a lot but it is a great inspiration to start with.

This is a great recipe except I added 2 tsp. dry mustard, 1 tsp. salt
and 1 tsp. pepper--it feeds 5 or 6--everyone loved it!!!!!!!!!
It really needs the spices--my kids loved it-but they added 1/2 tsp
of cayenne--or just top with a couple spoons of salsa---Thanks this
is great!

I wanted something easy for Sunday brunch and decided to try this recipe even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I didn't have mushrooms and thought I had a pepper but didn't so I ended up substituting brocolli. Some suggested the onions need to be pre-sauteed but I think they cooked up fine in the mixture.  My only issue was the texture of the bread in the center of the pan.  It was a little too moist for my tastes. I think I am going to try reducing the milk and/or using less fresh bread or maybe some french bread that has been cubed and left to dry for a little while before assembling the ingredients.  I did add salt, pepper and a couple cloves of smashed roasted garlic to the egg mixture. When I took the foil off at the 30 minute mark the cheese hadn't melted and everything still looked quite wet so I turned the heat up to 375 and left it in the oven for 25 minutes instead of the stated 15. It looked and smelled so nice when it came out of the oven.  The flavor was great! I'm glad the recipe called for milk as I think cream (some reviewers switched to cream) would have made it too rich for us. The recipe sounds delicious as written and it was great with the changes I made.  It's a great base for you to add the things that you like and so easy to switch things up for variety. Now that I've said all this I truly do agree with Nicki and Gus, it's not fair to change everything about the recipe and then complain and give a low rating when it doesn't turn out

Delicious!  I used sharp white Cheddar, left out the ham and green pepper, and added spinach and artichoke hearts.  Also added a touch of garlic salt and white pepper. I did find it needed to cook about 20 minutes more than the recipe stated (but our oven tends to require more time as a rule). I'll definitely be making this for breakfast again during the holidays!

I follow a very similar recipe however, instead of tearing up the bread, I trim the crusts off, spread thin layer of dijon mustard on one side, and cut slices on diagonal. First layer is mustard side up bread in botton of greased pan, add veggies/meat/cheese, and repeat layers again.  I prefer to use shaved black forest ham torn into pieces, and I season the egg/milk mixture with salt, pepper and tobasco/hot sauce.  Bake at 375F for 40 minutes, and remove foil and bake 15-20 mins more.  Yumm!

Made this for a family Sunday brunch, along with two other recipes found at this site (Blueberry Buckle and Fresh Fruit Salad), and got rave reviews!  An easy-to-make-ahead all-in-one dish.

Made this as written and it was very good. My kids do not like mushrooms so I only put them on half. It worked nice with leftover french bread and hamburger buns for the bread. Thanks!

I was so glad to see this recipe again.  I use it, but I'd gotten carried away on the ingredients.  A few tips for variations:  saute the onions and green peppers if you have people sensitive to those at your house.  Use chorizo sausage, sharp cheddar, and canned green chilis (mild) for a Mexican flavor.  A remarkably flexible recipe.

I tried this because I knew it would be easier and quicker than making individual omlets as I had planned.  Everyone voted on taking the time for individual omlets from now on.  Just wasn't for us.

I used leftover croissants and hot dog buns. leftover cooked bacon instead of ham and spinach instead of peppers. I seasoned with garlic salt, cayenne, and fresh cracked pepper. I didn't make this ahead of time but I did have to bake longer. Not sure if that had something to do with the bake time. If you have extra croissants. Use them for this. They added amazing flavor! Next time Id like to use spicy sausage and make the night before as the recipe instructs. Still turned out well, though.

This was very good, I like the basic recipe....you can use anything you want in it; I used what I had in the house; cook sausage, asparagus, cheddar and italian cheese. .....everyone also likes the corners, so next time I will make it in muffin pans, so everyone gets a corner!

I haven't made this exact recipe, but similiar.  I would omit the green pepper, and add a can of dieced green chilies.  That spices it up just enough.

Quite easy and tasty. It's a little too rich and creamy for my taste though. Maybe I should've added more onions or peppers.

This is an excellent recipe for next day guests.  I add a few hot sauce drops and also buttered one side of the bread and spread with a little Dijon Mustard.  We liked the extra zing!  :)  Thanks Amy, I had lost the recipe.    Joni

Really good! I added sautéed onion, green pepper, garlic and mushrooms plus a drained can of diced tomatoes. I used 10 eggs in addition to the 2 cups whole milk. To the egg/milk mixture I added 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon each garlic powder,onion powder,seasoned salt,black pepper. A 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and a large dash of red pepper flakes. I doubled the meat, cheese and bread and baked an hour covered at 350*. I think it’s a good basic recipe that you could add almost anything to!

This recipe met so-so reviews with my family. I made the recipe as written and agree with other reviewers that it needs additional bake time as well as possibly higher oven temperature. Next time I would sauté the onion and pepper before adding to the strata.  I would also pour half the egg/milk mixture at the middle of layering and add remainder at the end.  It needs some spice.  I think some thyme leaves or maybe some cayenne pepper to boost the flavor.

This was a big hit with my family for Christmas breakfast. I made it with smoked Gouda and cheddar cheese.  And used French rolls for the bread.  It had plenty flavor and good texture.  Will make this one again.

I have made something similar, and you can throw in spinach and shredded zucchini.  You can also dump the bread and sub in tator tots.  OR you can grate potatoes on top of the bread and then layer on vegetables, cheese and such.  Also, add just a pinch of dry mustard and a couple of shakes of nutmeg into the mix.  You can try other spices.  But make sure whatever bread you use is a bit dry . . . or mush is what you will get.

Wow, what a delish treat on Christmas morning. Very flavorful and not too "eggy" - delicate cross between quiche and baked eggs. Used turkey sausage, low fat milk, cheddar/jack cheese and rye bread; added chopped spinach and garlic powder. Next time will try bacon and asparagus. Perfect for winter dinners also.

It was delicious.  Since it was for a family brunch I served it with salsa--some used it some did not.  I'm glad that I read the reviews as it needed almost twice the cooking time stated in the instructions.  I used challah bread and it was so good I'll probably always make it that way.

Very good basic and easy recipe. I made this for Christmas brunch and it was gone within a few minutes. Only thing I would change is add less milk as mine was a bit more runny that I preferred.

I made this for a work potluck and decided the ingredients were missing a few things, so, I used Ham, Bacon, Mushrooms, Red Bell Pepper, Onion, Green Onion, Cheddar,  and Colby Jack.  I cooked the bacon first,  also gave the onion Bell Pepper and Mushrooms a quick saute' just to get a little flavor from them and soften them.  I made it as stated with eggs and milk  and bread and let it all sit over night, cooked it in the morning and took it to work 40 minutes away, it was still warm when I got to work and the potluck  was still an hour away.  No problem, this dish was gone way faster than I expected, the only change I would make next time is cutting the milk down 1/4 to 1/2 cup, it wound up a little runny but awesome recipe and I'll be making it again for sure, thank you for sharing!!!!

I've made this recipe as is, and it's delicious! I've also used Italian cold cuts (hot capicola, prosciutto, mortadella), with Italian cheeses and Italian spices. Fresh basil makes a nice touch. It's a hit wth my Italian in-laws and my hubby is always requesting it! I do use organic 1/2 and 1/2 for the liquid).  For the bread, I use Italian bread or rolls that are too crusty to use! It's a great way to use your leftovers. Get creative!!!

WOW! My entire family raved about this dish. In between mouthfuls, all I heard was "DELICIOUS!". The only change I made was substituting the green peppers for red peppers. Also, I had ham that was already sliced. So, I rolled up a few slices at a time and cut them up into small round. To me, it didn't make a difference and they had no idea the ham was supposed to be diced. I loved seeing their faces when I told them it was made with almond milk! . I'll definitely make this again - and again, and again, and again...

A favorite recipe because it is layered.  So if someone doesn't like peppers then just put it on one side. Same with onions, mushrooms or ham.

This is my go-to recipe, and it's amazing every time. The only thing change is not adding the peppers, as I did them overwhelming. Sharp white cheddar gives it tons of flavored. Thank you sharing!

I did use this as a base recipe, but made lots of changes.  I recommend making the custard how you like your French Toast.  For me that means with a splash of vanilla a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon.  
Instead of just ham, I use ham, bacon and breakfast sausage.  I don't skimp on the meat.
While the casserole is in the oven I brown hash browns, you can use frozen, but if you go with fresh, be sure to wring the raw potatoes in a dish towel to get most of the water out.  Make enough potatoes to cover the entire dish 1/4 inch thick and season the hash browns with salt and pepper.  5 minutes before the casserole is done, spread the potatoes over the dish and sprinkle some more cheddar cheese.  Return to oven for 5 minutes.

No one will go away hungry!!!

I saw this recipe and it is almost identical to my favorite breakfast strata, only difference...I also add spinach and 1 cup of cream. I noticed a lot of people said it was bland. I don't agree. Salt and (freshly coarse ground pepper) in the right amounts should do the trick. Also, for those who like spicy... I always have a bottle of (La Victoria's Salsa Brava) Hot Sauce, on the table, for those who like it spicy...and that's most of us.  This is an excellent recipe!
