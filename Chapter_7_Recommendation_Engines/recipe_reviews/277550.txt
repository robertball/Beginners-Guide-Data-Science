So easy to make. Very cakey-like with the cream cheese flavor as the star. I used a Duncan Hines Butter Recipe cake mix and wound up with 48 cookies using a small cookie scoop. They were not the most attractive looking cookies so on my second cookie sheet I flatten them down and sprinkled them with red sanding sugar. Next time I will bake an extra 2 minutes or so for a not-so-soft cookie. Thanks for the recipe.
