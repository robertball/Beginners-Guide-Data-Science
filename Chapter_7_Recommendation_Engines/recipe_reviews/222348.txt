I modified for BBQ. 4 C mayo, 2 C sour cream, 4 teas curry blend and put in fridge. 2 small apples, juice from 1 lemon, 8 C cooked chicken breasts cubed, 2 C finely chopped celery, 2 C grapes, 1.5 C pecans, 1# precooked firm pasta. Basically prepared as recipe as instructed. Made just over 18 cups salad. Loved the curry. Did not use pineapple.       This is a keeper :)

This recipe provided us with a great summer night's meal!  It lends itself well to adding any ingredients you'd care to, and it's a great way to use up leftover chicken from another meal.  Thanks!  We really enjoyed it!

Excellent chicken salad! I made it substantially like the recipe, really liked the additional flavor of the curry powder. But I did change a few things, just based on what I had on hand: light mayo and sour cream, a whole cup of pecans which I toasted, and I used a whole 15-oz can of crushed pineapple in juice. I also added a couple of peeled, seeded, and diced cucumbers from my garden since they needed to get used.  Absolutely delicious! I served it with rich whole-wheat rolls at our church Game Night and it was a big hit!

A local tea room served a chicken salad that I loved, so I experimented until I made one very similar to it.  This recipe is almost exactly the one I came up with. I did not use apples; I did use whatever I had..raisins, sliced strawberries, grapes, etc.  I did not use sour cream; I also added lemon juice and a touch of sugar; and instead of pecans the tea room used salted peanuts (I have also made it with pecans) but I will try the new ideas..sour cream, etc. this recipe uses.  I've learned this is a great "make ahead"...it's better if kept refrigerated overnight.  The recipe has been requested every time I've served it to guests!

I have been making this for 15 years and it is a favourite stand-by.    I have never tried it with pineapple, but will next time .   I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream and add 1tbs mango chutney to the dressing.  This complements the curry powder and adds a sweet touch.    Raisins and/or dried cranberries are great if you have no grapes on hand.  Final party tip: serve it in cantaloupe melon cups or quarters.

I made this recipe tonight at our cottage but changed it because I did not have the exact ingredients. I used plain yoghurt instead of sour cream, walnuts instead of pecans and red grapes instead of green ones. I also halved the dressing and even had some left over and the salad was still moist and good. The curry is the essential ingredient. I have other chicken salad recipes similar to this but not with curry. Both my husband loved it and I will make it again.

This is such a easy recipe to change and use available ingredients.  I often use mandarin oranges instead of pineapple. I use all chicken meat because of the great flavor of dark meat. I have also used rotisserie chicken and canned chicken.

Made it just as the recipe says. It's soooooooo delicious!  A hit at my party. Now I eat itby the spoonful lol. Can't imagine deviating one bit. The curry is splendid and the green grapes turned out to be the perfect sweet contrast. Will definitely make again!

I was a little leery about the combination of flavors in this dish, but it was delicious.  Served it on a couple leaves of romaine lettuce for a nice light summertime meal.

I have made a similar recipe for years so I am sure this is wonderful.  I did not try it because I reduce the mayo and sour cream and add some yogurt to make it less guilty and healthful. In addition, I add mandarin oranges and half a jar of chutney cut up.  The chutney really makes a unique and interesting flavor note and you won't miss some of the fat you left out.

This is SO good!  The different flavors meld together beautifully.  I used mandarin oranges instead of the pineapple as another reviewer mentioned.  Next time I will try more curry for a bit stronger taste. Yum!

I took another reviewers (brilliant) advice & made this as a cold pasta salad although I'm sure it is delicous as is for a sandwich or crossaint.. I used 1/2 pound of cooked bowtie pasta, 3 boiled & shredded chicken breast, 2 cups mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 2 teaspoons curry, 1 1/2 cups celery, 1 1/2 cups red grapes (what I had), 1 pink lady apple,  everything about this was perfect! Moist, crunchy, & delicious!  I omitted the pecans & pineapple because I didn't have them on hand, I may add the pineapple to see how it flavors it next time but there is plenty of crunch without the pecans! Thank you!

This was just what I was looking for.
My bridge club was coming for lunch and I wanted something 
different to serve. 
I served it on a lettuce leaf with a fresh croisant.

I will only review a recipe if I made it exactly according to the RECIPE. It’s an unusual  combination of ingredients, but it is really,really good!i loved the sweetness of the pineapple. Would never have thought of adding pineapple to chicken salad, but along with the crunchy ness of the apple, celery and pecans it’s was awesome! Will keep this recipe and make again.

So disappointed!!!  Essentially, this is a crunchy grape salad with mayo & sour cream dressing...and some other stuff.

It was bland, boring - almost tasteless - with too much dressing. We served it to guests, based on ratings :(. The tastes which predominated were grape & the dressing (but with no influence from the curry powder, which I bought specifically to make this salad [Morton & Bassett brand, best by June 2021]). Celery, apple, and pecans added crunch, which was crucial, but no taste. Followed the recipe exactly (using fresh pineapple with its juice, which should only have improved it). 

If you like very mild flavors plus grapes - not challenging to the palate - this is a good option. Or if you eat a lot of chicken salad & want something different, try it, but only if you have the ingredients on hand & don't spend extra money. I have a similar, generations-old recipe from my husband's great-aunt, and will be returning to that one.

I made this as close to the original as possible, using what I had on hand. So delicious! It can be tweaked to suite your tastes/dietary needs and what you have on hand. It's a keeper!

I like this fruity chicken salad. I was out of celery and grapes, but added some mandarin oranges. I really like the dressing with the curry powder.

I’ve made this recipe twice now and the three of us really liked it.  I added a cup and a half (uncooked) of small pasta to make it a one-dish meal.  Next time I make it I think I will try draining the pineapple at least partly.  The juice helps flavor the dish but I don’t like the puddle in the bottom of the serving bowl.

OUTSTANDING!! This recipe is very forgiving if you have extra cooked chicken (I had half of an eight pound roasting chicken to dispose of, so I probably had close to six cups of chicken). I'm not sure I would chill this (I didn't) because serving it at a little under room temperature, due to the chill of the mayonnaise and the sour cream, really lets you appreciate all the wonderful flavors.

I did not like it.  Too much mayonnaise.

Has anyone tried this using miracle whip? It appears that it might enhance the sweetness.
