So Good!! The bake time, however should be lowered to about 9 minutes to avoid a dry cake.  Overall, this recipe was just what i was looking for (and the batter was delicious).

These turned our rather well and were especially tasty warm.  Yes, they have a darker chocolate flavor (cocoa) and less sugar but I like a less sweet product.  The powdered sugar on top added a little more sweetness.

I was a little concerned when I added the eggs to the butter and sugar as the mixture started to separate and looked more like cottage cheese than creamed butter, eggs and sugar.  I tried to fold in the flour and cocoa as is advised in so many Madeleine recipes but it took quite a bit of stirring to get the mixture blended.  I thought the batter looked like it needed more flour but as you will see, it did not.  

I did as the recipe instructed and placed rounded teaspoons of batter in the Madeleine pans (I used Bakers Joy - two short bursts per mold and blotted any huge globs with a paper towel or brush) and it was exactly the right amount of batter.

I preheated my oven and checked the temperature with an oven thermometer.  I baked the Madeleines for exactly 12 minutes.  I turned the pan over and they popped right out on the rack with a little whack.

I wish these were low fat because these are a tasty way to get your daily allotment of heart healty cocoa!

I made a small batch of these today just to try them.  They were very yummy, not too sweet or too chocolately.  I expected them to be a light crunchy cookie, but they were actually quite spongy.  Hard to describe, but good.

I made these for my French manfriend and he absolutely loves them. He's constantly asking me for them now. These have a dark chocolate flavor - not milk chocolate, so it's true that they are not too sweet. They are best on their own coming right out of the oven. A day or two later, they taste great dunked in coffee. These have become an instant staple in my house. Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Very nice petite cakes! My girlfriend and I love these and i decided to try this recipe for my first attempt. However, I think I added too much batter to the molds because the baked over the edges. They taste awesome, but i think i need to restrain more when filling the molds. Ooops...

These came out so cute and shiny.  They looked great with a bunch of different flavors to make "day at the beach" madeleines. =)

I don't know if my madeleine tray is smaller that those used in the US, but I actually got 30 out of the mix and had to throw a bit of the batter away!!!

I also found them to be a little on the bittersweet side which is fine by me, but some people do prefer their chocolate goodies to be sweet rather than bitter.

Mine turned out a little bit too much like mini muffins as well.  I'm not sure whether that's because I over mixed the ingredients, although I did fold the dry ingredients in and only just until they were all blended.

An easy and fast recipe to follow. Unless you like a bittersweet chocolate taste, it was OK (rate by my friends who tasted them). A little on the drier side and it could be sweeter in taste.

I made madeleines for the first time today using this recipe. I was so excited but just wasn't impressed at all. They were kind of dry and cakey and not dense and buttery like I was hoping for. They also aren't very sweet at all, so if you make these, I highly recommend you dip them in white chocolate or dust with a lot of powdered sugar. Hate to give a recipe 2 stars, but just wasn't impressed :(

Very good! I also thought it might need more flour...but no.  Agree about the shorter cooking time. Nine minutes max!

Great recipe - I added orange essence - worked well. A note about the baking time - its too long - make it 10 minutes and they are just right.

I love this recipe for chocolate madeleines.  They are a real crowd pleaser and very easy to make.  The real key is to ensure all ingredients are at room temperature.  I am making this recipe for the 5th time since I initially tried it last year.

I made these because I had leftover egg yolks from making a chocolate angelfood cake (delicious and recipe also found on allrecipes!) The batter is easy to mix up. I followed the recipe step by step. I learned that I had to spred the batter into the madeliene forms or they came out like a drop cookie. 12 minutes was too long for baking and caused a dry cookie. I cut the time to 9 min. and think next time I'd go even less, like 7-8. These cookies have more of a cake like texture. I tripled the recipe and got 36 madeleines.

Very chocolaty, it was like biting into a brownie. Very thick, I would only eat 1 with a cup of coffee. Good tho.

These are delicious (taste like brownies). I used 1/3 cup of sugar because everyone said they weren't sweet enough. The problem is that they aren't madeleines. They are more like cupcakes. The consistency is just so wrong. Taste is a 5, but madeleines it's a 1.

It was not shabby. Maybe you should add more sugar if you want to bring out the sweetness. I, however, lowered the sugar a tad to bring out the dark chocolate taste.
