Try this small change and you will definitely have authentic baingan ka bharta. After peeling off the eggplant skin, mash the pulp coarely. Use the mashed eggplant for the last steps when you return this to the pan with onions etc. Cook this well, add 2 tsp of cumin powder, 1 tsp red chilli powder and 1 tsp garam masala (you will get this at any indian store. Happy cooking !

My Bangan ka Bhurta did not look like the image posted, and did not taste like Indian Bangan ka Bhurta I've ever had in Indian restaurants. I've had it often since it is one of my favorite Indian dishes.  I doubled up on the spices and it still didn't change much... Not sure what I could have done to fix it.  I must add though, that it was delicious, served cold the next day with left over naan!  Didn't taste like it should, but was still flavorfull!  I won't make this again, I will try to find another recipe.

After eating something similar to this in a Mediterranean Restaurant I have been searching high and low for a recipe. This is it! This recipe is very tasty and easy to make. I left out the cilantro and the next time I make it I will omit or cut out the cayenne pepper. It was just a little too hot for me but a great eggplant side dish! Good and healthy!

I've never eaten this before, so I have nothing to compare it to. We had white rice and lentils along with sausage as the sides. Great combo~ We liked the eggplant roasted on top of the open flame as others suggested.

needs more spices.  there is another eggplant recipe on here which is much better.  the texture was good though, but too more work using the microwave and oven, instead of just broiling the eggplant whole in tthe oven for 30 min.

I roasted the eggplant on an open flame gas stove burner - like the footnote says. I've had this many times before because it is somewhat of a traditional or everyday type of dish here in Trinidad. If you do have a gas stove roast the eggplant on it. The open flame imparts a smoky flavour which gives this dish it's signature flavour. I also roasted garlic to add in, omitted the cayenne and used fresh chopped up scotch bonnet pepper for the heat in this dish. If you can't handle much heat, don't omit the pepper at all - it really adds to this dish. I served with Buss-up-Shut (Paratha Roti) which is a different type of naan. Good base recipe for anyone wanting to try some Indian food. Thanks for posting!

It seemed like a bit of work so we just simmered the ingredients together on the stove til cooked. We increased the cayenne to our taste and added garam masala per another review. I don't know what the real recipe was supposed to taste like never having had it before, but ours was pretty tasty. My husband devoured it.

This was excellent!!!  As well as others I cooked mine over my gas burner and added some chopped garlic to the onions as they were cooking.  Also added some extra s&p and a little bit of cumin as well.  I tried to get this as "mushy as possible!  I served mine with some homemade naan and it was soooo good. Great recipe!!!

I give this a five because it was simple. I added some fresh ginger because it was a bit bland. I'm glad I did because it turned out great!

I followed Roxanne's suggestion and roasted the eggplant over a gas burner. I also added garlic because it justed seemed to need it.  I did use cayenne, but added more (about 1 tsp)a bit at a time, tasting as I added.  Because I had unexpected guests I needed to stretch the meal so I added a few potatoes that I had partially cooked in the microwave.  I served this with Roomli Roti from this site and we all enjoyed it.  Thanks, Cartha and thanks to the person who nominated this for our healthy meal group.

Took Archana's advice (from 1.16.08) and ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!! Served it to two friends who are not the biggest fans of Indian Food and they loved it and asked for more!!!  Served this with a baked chicken breast covered with saag paneer and steamed quinoa. DELISH!!

I combined the seering and baking steps by placing the entire eggplant on the barbeque and letting it bake over the flame for 5 minutes. It turned out excellant, my family says it's a keeper!

I thought this was an eggplant curry and it really is not a curry.  It still is a relatively good way to eat eggplant, but I think I would get sick of the taste quickly if I ate it repeatedly.

I had never heard of this dish, but loving spicy food and eggplant I tried it. OMG!  It is an awesome dish.  I took the advice from others and added cumin, chile powder and garam marsala.  Amazing. . . Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This could be user error, but mine did not turn out well. It was extremely mushy and somewhat bland. I still enjoyed it, maybe it just needed some more spice!

I made this just the way it was in the recipe and it was a sucess my partner loved it !! my kids didn't like it though it is pretty spicy although by the time I was done with broiling it it didn not need to be microwaved it was already tender but that only made it quicker to make.

Have to use up those eggplants!  So I tried this.  We loved it.  We enjoyed it warm and found that we loved the leftovers cold. I liked the heat that the cayenne pepper added.  Thanks submitter.

We LOVED this recipe!  I had an eggplant that needed to be used up and this  recipe fit the bill.  I had 2 tomatoes (not Romas) but it didn't matter.  This is a very nice recipe as is.
Thanks for the recipe!

I was trying to match the stuff you get in the restaurants, and while this isn't an exact match it is pretty yummy. I skipped the microwave, roasted the eggplant about 20 minutes in the oven, added 1/2 tsp of marsala, and roasted garlic in the oven and added it with the eggplant.
