Really delicious and easy.  Two changes:
1. I added 1/3 cup chopped pecans to the cake/butter mixture
2.  I added about 1/4 cup of a sugar cinnamon mixture to the cake/butter mixture
Both additions were to kick up the crumble a notch.

I loved this simple dessert. So easy to make and no real cleanup. I follow instructions as printed & I got exactly what was expected. Maybe next time, I will try blueberry.

My mom used to make this all the time when last minute company would be coming over.  Quick, easy and delicious served warm with ice cream!  A great childhood memory rediscovered!!!

It's not as crunchy as I wish it were. My mum has a similar recipe and her recipe calls for chopped pecans.
