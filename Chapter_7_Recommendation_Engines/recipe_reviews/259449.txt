This was very tasty but for some reason it formed a gummy crust, which we did not care for. We wound up scooping the pudding and cake part away from the 'crust'. Much better without  it.

I felt like the salt amt was too much as the cake had a salty flavor in the background. Overall the cake was moist and it was more like a flan or mousse style cake. The texture was ok but not my favorite. We put it in the fridge and the texture was more firm, like a light brownie. My family loved it on the other hand, both at room temp and cold.

added whole egg, instead of water used coffee, baked at 250. for 2 hrs;  richest chocolate cake i'd ever made---pudding is not like American concept of soft pudding---its very rich, softer but thick layer

wow I was hoping everyone would like it and sure enough another hit recipe people were still talking about 2 weeks later the coffee was not  to strong I thought it might be overpowering and maybe to moist but it was just right.

I came across this recipe when looking for a pudding pie that didn't need whipping cream. This recipe filled 2 ready made cookie crumb pie crust and took 50min to cook. I didn't use the coffee but I feel it would taste great with it if I had used it. It's NOT too salty as others have claimed. I topped it with a strawberry reduction and the top absorbed it perfectly. My advice, use this recipe as a pie instead of a cake :)

It baked perfectly and looked wonderful but...... it was so strong tasting. I did not care for it and neither did most of my family members. But I did substitute the expresso powder for this strong instant Turkish coffee mix which could have been the problem. Overall I’m not sure I’ll make this again.

This is amazing! I made it for my mom's birthday dinner. Everyone loved it! I would say it is part souffle and part pudding cake.

I was intrigued by the idea of the layers in this cake, but neither my husband or I cared for it. I won't be making it again.

I've made the regular magic cake several times and it's become a fav. This one however was horrible. I'm not sure what happened. :(

made it and tastes good. i added more choco powder and glad it turned well. but 60 mins bake (for me and my oven) is a bit too long because i found out that the second layer appeared more like a pudding custard?

Followed the recipe exactly - always do that the first time.  I just found that like another reviewer, the bottom layer was like a skin you would find on top of a custard which is not properly covered.  Did not care for that particularly.  The rest was o.k. but not something I would  rush out to make again.  There was not much cake part either.
