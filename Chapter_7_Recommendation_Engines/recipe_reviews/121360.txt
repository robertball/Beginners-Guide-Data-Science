These were really great! I usually don't like tweaking recipes, but I did a little for this one. For the frosting, I did butter instead of shortening. I also halved the frosting recipe, like a previous review suggested. I am really happy that I did!!! Also, make sure you refrigerate them!! They become super moist and delightful!!!

They were pretty good! The frosting was certainly my favourite part!! I also added a bit more peanut butter than the recipie called for because I love peanut butter.

as others suggested, 1/2 the frosting is perfect.  i have had these bars requested for family functions like graduations all the time!  the frosting is the best peanut butter frosting i have ever had.  it is not over powering and is just like a butter cream!  you and your friends/family/coworkers will be delighted with these bars for certain!  it is now a staple dessert for us!  ENOJY!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I guess my main complaint was the bars or the frosting were not peanut buttery enough, and it made WAY WAY too much frosting.  I strongly recommend halving it.  We scraped a lot of frosting off (and I didn't even put near the whole amount on there), and ate them anyway, but won't make again.  Thanks anyway.

The bars were ok.  They seem too thin for me.  I did NOT like the frosting.  It tasted like shortening.  Maybe replacing the shortening with butter would help.    Replacing the shortening and perhaps using a smaller pan would fix a lot for me.

My husband's favorite childhood treat are peanut butter bars.  I've been searching for a recipe that passes his test.  Most have failed, but these, these he said were PERFECT.  I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

So delicious!!! My family loved these. I made one change though. Instead of using semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used milk chocolate ones. And that's only because I prefer the milk chocolate over the semi-sweet. They turned out great!

Yummy, moist and delicious.  I prefer my frosting with butter, but this recipe called for shortening, so I used half butter, half shortening.  Otherwise, followed it exactly.

These were pretty tasty. I was looking for more of a cakey texture, so I will admit I had a predetermined expectation going in that they just didn't fulfill. Also, I used chocolate frosting instead of the peanut butter because that's my preference. My husband and 8 y/o son thought they were delicious, so they were a hit with them. I'll be continuing my search for the "perfect" peanut butter bar.

My daughter made these as a suprise dessert the other night....although the bar was very good...we thought the frosting was a bit too sweet for us. She also used butter instead of shortning. May try again and try to change the amount of confectioners sugar to make it less sweet....thanks!
