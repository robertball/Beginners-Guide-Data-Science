This was good. I would cut back on the salt next time. I added a little more mayo and Dijon than called for. I used some leftover shredded chicken that I had (since Marianne's review said the boiling method didn't really add flavor). It was a nice change of pace from the fruity chicken salads I usually make, and I liked the yogurt more than I thought I would.

In Cook's Notes it says it's OK to use chicken breast, so I did and cubed it rather than shredded it.  I also did not use the kelp.  It has been a long time since I used the boiling method of cooking chicken, so I thought I'd better try it---especially since it included wine and chicken broth!  I don't think it produces a very flavorful chicken, so I'll go back to using the breasts with skin and bones, baking them with salt and pepper and maybe a little of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute before removing just the chicken itself.  It's a lot more flavorful, and I much prefer the texture.  But the rest of the recipe produced a very nice result.  I will make this again, being sure to use a mix of red onion as well as scallions.  Thank you, DeanandBettieVintage!

Loved this!! Usually I'm not the biggest chicken salad fan, but this recipe is delicious and refreshing. I stuck with the boiled chicken method called out in the recipe, based on other reviews I was a little worried that the chicken would be bland so I added a bay leaf and half an onion as well as mixed in some sherry and marsala wines with my white wine. Not sure if that made any difference, will try recipe again without these adjustments to compare. Great recipe overall!  Thanks for sharing!
