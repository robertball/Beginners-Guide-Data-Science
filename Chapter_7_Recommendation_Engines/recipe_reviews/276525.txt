Easy and very tasty. This was my introduction to farro, and its going to be a keeper. My wife is a mushroom-hater, so I substituted zucchini, which worked fine. I did cut back 1/4 cup on the farro so that there was a bit of broth left in the skillet to moisten the chicken. The chicken was a bit overcooked, so I suggest delaying adding it to the farro for 15-20 minutes.

Great recipe, especially if you are trying to incorporate different grains into your diet. Except for the mushrooms I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My husband hates mushrooms and refuses to eat anything with them (heâ€™s my picky eater) so instead of mushrooms I added a can of diced tomatoes (oregano, basil & garlic flavor). It was delicious topped with the parmigiana cheese. I served the entire meal with a side salad and butter bread. Delicious, will definitely make this again.
