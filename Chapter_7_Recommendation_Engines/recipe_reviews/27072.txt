Finally I've found the recipe for basic, restaurant style Mexican rice.  The key to this recipe is the seasonings you use.  I tried it as written, just with the cumin, and it was not nearly as good as it was when I did it a second time using Taco Seasoning I (from this site).  I just sprinkled in what looked like enough, about 1-1/2 tsp.  This mixture includes cumin and many other spices which are perfect for this recipe.  I also cooked my onion in the oil BEFORE adding the rice to get it nice and soft.  Other than that, I followed exactly as written and it was perfect!

For the reviewers having trouble with browning and puffing the rice: My rice browned, but didn't puff. When I added the soup stock and tomato sauce, I was concerned (I had company over and this was the first try) but the rice came out beautifully, and puffed out. Don't let the other reviews prevent you from trying this simple and delicious dish. It made a great side dish for the quisadillas I made. This is also a good guy-proof recipe, considering I didn't mess it up. I'm definitely making this one again. I have a rice cooker, but I decided to take a chance and make it in a medium sauce pan, and I was glad. My rice cooker tends to singe the outer layer of rice. Cook hard!

If you're looking for a Mexican Rice recipe that will be "the star of the show," this is not the recipe. If, however, you're looking for a pleasantly and subtley flavored Mexican-style rice to accompany a spicier main dish, this fits the bill perfectly. I chose to saute the rice in butter rather than oil, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.  Don't worry about "puffing" the rice-just saute it till golden brown, then add the chopped onion and spices, saute another minute or two, then add liquids. Cover and simmer till liquid is almost absorbed and rice is tender. Nice, basic rice recipe.

This is a great basic rice recipe that is easy to prepare.  The only difference between my preparation and the recipe's is that I sauteed the onion before cooking the rice, added fresh minced garlic, and used chicken stock versus broth.  Thanks for submitting it.

This has become our families favorite Mexican rice.  I made several alterations though:  used sea salt (to taste) instead of garlic salt and added 2-3 cloves of garlic (crushed), omitted the cumin, and added 1 packet of "Sazon Goya-Con Cilantro y Tomate."  It really adds to that authentic flavor you get in the best Mexican restaurants.  The cook time is accurate, but I find that the last 5 min, I need to add a dash of broth to keep it from being too dry.

A strong chicken broth is needed to make this good. KAET: I've never been able to get my rice to brown and/or puff in a skillet either, so I always use my rice cooker instead. I saute the onions, minced garlic and cumin in a skillet, then throw it into the rice cooker along with the 1 c. rice, 1-1/2 c. chicken broth and all the other ingredients, omitting the garlic salt. The cooker shuts off when the rice is done. Easy and very good too.

Don't let the name intimidate you.  I am a chef at heart not by trade.  I am of Mexican heritage and was the only one of 5 girls to learn to cook like Mama.  This recipe is very close to what I learned to make from my mother.  Slight differences are that we add a little less onion about 1/8 of a cup and we add about the same amount of chopped bell pepper that is added with the onions about half way through the sauteeing of the rice.  Instead of garlic salt we use granulated garlic or fresh garlic which will add a little more flavor.  We also add a dash of black pepper.  If you don't have fresh chicken broth that is already salted, we use 2 cups water and about 1 1/2  Tblsp powdered chicken boullion by Knorr Suiza found on the Hispanic aisle which has lots of salt in it, no need for extra salt. I'm not sure about adding taco seasoning as other reviewers have suggested, this makes me think of Fast Food Bell rice.  Homemade Mexican rice is not supposed to be over flavored, the main dish should have the flavor and or the salsa that you serve should be as spicy as you desire.  These flavors should not be expected to be in the rice.  I'd say this is a darn good recipe for anyone wanting to make homemade Mexican rice!  My chef hat off to Mommyto2!

This rice was so well-liked by my friends that we all agreed that it was the best mexican rice we'd ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time that I'd made this, but the second time I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I still used the same amount of water and it worked out perfectly.  Very yummy!!

I know this is a wonderful recipe.  I have been making this for years.  I used to go visit my friend and then go watch her mother-in-law cook,  This is al most exactly her recipe.  The only changes she would make and I still do are use 1/2 tsp cumin seed instead of the graound coumin and also she would use a couple pieces of fresh garlic minced and browned with the onions.  The rest is exactly as she made it and MMMMMMMM so good!

I was kind of nervous making this rice because I was craving the rice from my favourite Mexican restaurant, but this turned out great! I omitted the salt and just used fresh minced garlic instead and added some green onions along with the regular onions. I also used olive oil instead and did the 1.5 cups of broth to 0.5 cup tomato sauce and it turned out perfectly! Now I will make this rice when I can't get out to my favourite Mexican restaurant!

Excellent recipe and pretty foolproof. I can rarely even make good plain rice. I followed the recipe to the T with white basmati rice and it came out perfect, just like you'd get in a mexican resturant.

I don't think I did anything special but I had NO problems "puffing" the rice.  (I guess I got lucky) BUT when I added the tomato sauce, I did add 2 TBLS of picante sauce to bring out the mexican flavor a little better and cut that garlic salt by half! I wasn't crazy about the rice alone by itself BUT we put it in our chicken fajitas and we really liked it alot! (Reminded me of the Chipolte fajitas you can get w/ the rice already inside).  I'll make again next time we make burritos/fajitas and use this as a topper.  Thanks!

This is an incredibly easy, delicious recipe.  I can't think of anything to give it other than 5 stars.  I did add 1 tsp minced garlic and since I did not have garlic salt, I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a dash of salt with delicious results.  I do recommend the rice cooker for rice dishes. If you have one, try it.  I love the rice cooker because its easy and fool proof.  Sometimes rice can be a pain, so if you are looking to impress, take no chances...just don't eat the thin, scorched layer on the bottom! If you do prefer the stove, here are some tips. 1. Your rice is NOT going to "puff" while being sauteed.  I don't know why it said that.  Rice will puff, or cook rather, when its completely submerged in liquid. Instead, the first step is meant to give it a more golden color in the end. 2. If you find your rice more "wet" than you'd like, leave on simmer but take off the cover.  It will evaporate the extra liquid. 3. To make rice soft: Don't take off the cover while cooking, let your rice stand for about 10 minutes after cooking, then fluff with a wooden spoon, and let stand again for 5 more minutes. 4. If its still not soft enough to eat after cooking, re-cover and cook another 5-10 minutes and refer back to #3.  Hope this helps!

Hey...this is my Mom's recipe :) This is exactly how my mom cooker her rice with only one change. She added minced garlic (instead of garlic salt)at the same time she added the onion. Readers, you will be able to tell the delicious difference fresh garlic will add to this dish! This is a totally authentic mexican rice recipe...TWO THUMBS UP!

Very good base recipe. Mine turned out nice and fluffy. I made sure to brown the rice pretty well (Medium heat is key) before adding the liquid. Don't be scared if it smokes a little in the beginning. Just keep stirring and of course, lower the heat when you feel the need. Once the rice is browned, i make sure the skillet is hot enough so that when i pour in the broth (carefully pls), it will make a bit of that hissing sound of water meeting heat. Very mild compliment to any tasty/spicy Mexican dish. Keeping this and will make again n again. Thanks Mommyto2!

I made this last night and served Take Out-Fake Out Pollo con Crema over it. By itself, the rice is absolutely fantastic--the flavor is not too heavy, not too light. It's perfect. I substituted V8 (5.5 oz.) for the tomato sauce so I wouldn't have leftover tomato sauce to deal with, and otherwise kept the recipe exactly the same. Fabulous, will make again and again.

Good recipe. Easy, and I like easy in a pinch. However I get far more chicken flavor than Mexican flavors. I had to spice mine up with more cumin and some chili powder. I'll probably use this as a base and experiment more with spices.

Nice basic recipe that is easy to use as a base for something with a little more flair. 

I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt. I added the onions and garlic in with the rice to brown. I also added a seeded chopped jalapeno in this step. Used tomato sauce and half a pint of my own canned tomatoes in with the broth. Also added several generous dashes of dried oregano.

Yay to the AR Exchange for recommending this to me!  This is just what I was looking for and I'll be making it again :-).  The only changes I made didn't change any ingredients or measurements.  Since I don't buy garlic salt, I used fresh garlic and 1/2 tsp of sea salt. I did wash the rice, but then I always wash white rice, and I added the tomato sauce a couple minutes before adding the broth just to cook the tomato flavor a bit, but the measurements are great, as is the flavor!  Thank you so much for the recipe. UPDATE 2/28/09:  Just made this a second time and had to go by memory since my computer was down that day...STILL AMAZING!  The only thing I do differently, is to let it sit, covered, off the heat about 20 minutes after cooking has finished.  This time, before letting it sit, I added a cup of partially thawed, frozen sweet peas and carrots on the top and quickly put the lid back on, then fluffed and stirred to mix upon serving.  I liked the added flavors and texture.  I swear I'm addicted to this rice.

You might like this rice if you are unfamiliar with true, authentic mexican rice; however, if you are familiar with real mexican rice, you will NOT like this at all. This recipe is so bland-- so bland.

This rice was EXCELLENT!  I used brown rice and increased chicken broth to 2 1/2 cups.  I also replaced tomato sauce with salsa and added 1/2 teaspoon of chile powder.  My family loved it!

This is the best Mexican rice recipe!  We all love it. The only thing I do different is add 2 minced garlic cloves. Also, if I have them, I add 1/4 lb. of roma tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  To do that, I put the tomatoes and garlic in the blender instead of having to chop either of them.

I tried this recipe for a mexican dinner I made for a family gathering.  It was well recieved.  I had no problem getting the rice to brown and puff.  i think the ones who did were maybe expecting it to be more brown and puffier than it was.  i did add some chopped green bell pepper and fresh garlic. I have added this recipe to my personal cookbook and will definately make it again.  It is very quick and tasty.

I made this exactly as is. It was good and made a nice side to the enchiladas I made. But, it was just a little too much tomatoey flavor.  Like other reviewers my rice did not puff, but I did cook until a golden color.  If I use this recipe again I will experiment a little, use less tomato, and see what I can come up with.

Great rice recipe. I substituted salsa for the tomato sauce and added frozen corn at the very end.

This rice was excellent!! The only thing I did different was reduce to  1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup tomato sauce (about half an 8 ounce can). I also added 1 chopped roma tomato. The liquid should not exceed twice the rice amount or the rice will be too mushy and liquid will not be properly absorbed. Instead of broth one can use water and 2 bouillon cubes. The rice came out perfect with those modification and feel free to view the photo. Thank you for the recipe!!

Awsome.  Very light and fluffy.  I thought my rice wasn't puffy enough, and I thought it was ruined, but I finished it anyway.  It turned out perfect.   I am going to use some chilie powder next time to make it spicy.  I also will use Jasmine Rice next time.  Jasmine is a very good rice.  It is so light and fluffy.  Perfect for making this dish.  I like to serve it with my chicken enchiladas recipe that I got off this webdsite.  I also will serve it with tacos, and burritos.  Thank you for this recipe.  It is a family favorite.

Thank goodness someone finally saved me from boxed Mexican rice. This was delicious and easy to make.  The only change I made was to add fresh garlic. I will be serving this with all my Mexican food from now on!

This recipe is pretty close to my recipe except that I brown the rice first and then I add 2 cups of chicken broth,cumin,garlic salt, black pepper, and then about 1/8 of a cup of tomato sauce. You don't want the tomato sauce to overpower the whole dish. I am of hispanic decent and this is the way my mother and her mother always made it.

This is the same recipe that I've used for years, but with two additions: 1. I saute onion or chopped shallot in the oil, and then add the rice, which allows the onion/shallot to brown as the rice browns, and 2. I add 1/2 chopped cilantro to the cooked rice, just before serving. The recipe is quite good as written, though- and sometimes, you just want a good, basic version, so as not to "out-do" the rest of your meal. This is a can't-fail dish! :o)

I've been making this rice for several years now. I love it. I usually make a few changes, but since I've made it so much and have followed the recipe exactly I feel confident enough to rate the original recipe as well as giving my spin. I omit the tomato sauce and add "Rotel" in its place. I also use fresh chopped garlic along with the garlic salt. Another tip (of course you already know this...) don't lift the lid while it's cooking!! Let the steam do it's thing and you'll have great rice.

I don't know what happened but I followed the cooking instructions in this recipe exactly. After 25 minutes, the liquid hadn't been absorbed and the rice was still hard and uncooked. I let it simmer for another 25 minutes and it STILL wasn't cooked. Also, I didn't particularly like the cumin flavor in the rice. I have already thrown this recipe away and will look for another one.

I used mild salsa instead of tomato sauce, added a little more cumin, and served it with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  A great side dish for enchiladas or taco night!  Thanks for the great (and easy!) recipe!

Easy to make with a mild, but good flavor. I ended up burning the bottom layer of rice because the burner was up too high, but mixed in it tasted really good!

This was pretty good. I would have liked more seasoning, like coriander, or just taco seasoning. It was also a tad mushy, I think it could do with a bit less chicken broth. The only change I made to the recipe was to use olive oil instead of veg oil, and a little less of it. Update: I actually liked this a little more the next day, when I ate some leftovers. Some of the mushiness dried up in the fridge overnight and it had nice flavour, though still not very Mexican-y.

This turned out delicious, even though I goofed and used water instead of chicken broth!  I'll be sure to do it "right" the next time LOL!  Also, I used jasmine rice instead of long-grain.  Jasmine and basmati rice tend to stay fluffier and not as sticky when they're cooked.

Very tasty rice.  One suggestion:  When cooking the rice in oil, cook it by itself until you get it golden brown and puffed.  THEN add the cumin and garlic salt.  If you add the cumin too early, it darkens the rice and you can't tell when it's done.

My husband liked this recipe well enough, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I prefer more of a dry rice, so if I cook this again, I will use less liquid.  This was good to add to tacos.

This was excellent!  I am NO cook, and have never impressed my husband, UNTIL NOW!!  We eat Mexican every Friday night, and this tastes just like the retaurants!!  I will make a gain, next time with less garlic salt.  It was a tad salty.  But other than that, GREAT

I made this as core recipe for making twenty five servings of Spanish rice for our Silver Anniversary dinner. This rice was first to vanish. I also used taco seasoning from this site too as many others. Cumin is not enough. Also I had on hand and used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I added green onion, green sweet peppers, and jalapeños at the end. I had 2 cups of left over Mark’s Chili con carne I also added. The hot peppered chili made this rice have a hot bite! This is a great start recipe.

The last time we had tacos for dinner my husband insisted we have Mexican rice with it.  So in a pinch I went out and bought the packaged stuff.  It was so gross that I vowed that I would NEVER again buy that stuff!  I am still having bad dreams about it ;)
So, I set out to find a quick and easy recipe and came across this one.  I made a few subs: chopped some fresh garlic and added it with the onion.  Used about 2 tsp. taco seasoning instead of the cumin and salt, and subbed veggie broth since we are vegan.  It was really good!  Hubs kept commenting on how good the rice was.  I even got my little ones to try(which is a huge feat!)  This one's a keeper for sure!

This is the best I've tried so far. After trying it as written, which was really good, I've made a few changes. Instead of tomato sauce I use enchilada sauce and I also add 1/2 tsp of chili powder and a pinch or two of red pepper or flakes. And my family don't like onions so I just use powder in place of it. On occasion I have sub chicken broth for beef. Its so good either way and the original way. U can't go wrong with this recipe in my opinion. I've made it over 30 times soooo good!!

Was my first time cooking my own mexican rice and it certainly wont be the last !! i have followed this recipe exactly as it was, the only change i made was that i used brown rice, but you wont be able to notice the difference i promise.  It  tasted flavourful yet subtle i served it with the slow cooker pepper steak recipe and the combination was divine 1

This is a good basic recipe for Mexican rice.  We used it as a side dish and a topping for the Weeknight Skillet Fajitas recipe from this site.  The only changes I made to the rice were to cook the onions (with minced garlic and cumin) first (omitting the garlic salt) and added a small amount of diced jalapeños.  Unfortunately, the jalapeños made it extremely hot, so next time I will use diced mild green chili peppers.

I've made this rice dish twice so far and everyone agrees that it was great. The first time was for our Mother's Day fajita/burrito family lunch. I made it a second time as a siding to a vegetable main dish, and I added a can of peas to add some bulk to the rice. For both times, I added 1 tsp of cumin instead of just 1/2 tsp, plus 1 tsp of chili and 1/2 tsp spanish paprika. Love this dish :-)

this is it! this is a keeper! i cooked it exactly as written and it came out perfectly.  the second time i made this i added 1 clove of fresh garlic with the onion and 1 teaspoon of salt (instead of garlic salt) and it came out wonderful.
i am super picky with my Mexican rice because i am mexican but this is it! make this for you Hispanic friends and they will be impressed..trust me!!! you won't be sorry. give it a try.

We liked this.  There is nothing overwhelming about the flavor, which meant that all my kids enjoyed it equally.  I'll definitely make it again.

I'm going to give this 5 stars. It is a basic Mexican rice dish as written. I added chile powder to give it more flavor, after adding a lot more cumin and not getting the taste I wanted. I also used more onion. Really good basic recipe open to making it your own, depending on your families taste. 
Thanks for sharing.

A very good basic recipe.  Easy, fool-proof.  My rice didn't puff either, but it did not affect the overall texture or flavor.  I like a basic Mexican rice, so this was very pleasing to me.  I will use this recipe again.

For a dish with only 7 ingredients, this is simple AND tasty!!!  My husband and I both agreed that this tastes like the mexican rice served as a side component at our favorite local Mexican eatery!!!  I used the EXACT ingredients and cooked the rice in the oil with the onion until the rice was beginning to turn brown... but NOT burn!  More like "toasted" was how long I browned it.  I then added the spices followed by the broth and the tomato sauce.  Truly wonderful!!  My search for a simple mexican rice to accompany great Mexican main dishes has ended!!  Bravo!!!

I've been looking for a great Mexican rice recipe for a long time.  Didn't change a thing - this was excellent!  I served it with marinated lime-cilantro flank steak.  Mmm!

UPDATE: I made this again but used 2 T. of oil instead of 3 for a healthier option and it was still just as good!

Recipe as absolutely delish from what my kiddos said, each came back for helpings. The recipe was very simple and yet easy to do, I doubled the recipe and still had a nice bit left over. There wasn't any complaints, the seasonings were very good from what I sampled. I love cumin!! I can say I normally do spanish rice, but this was 10x easier and quicker to do and better then a 99 cent pouch version anyday!! Will be making again. But to the exception, I think I'll be adding 1/2 cup of diced green bell peppers just for added contrast. Thanks again. The family approves.

This is my go to recipe every time I make Mexican rice. Being Puertorrican, I instinctively make rice 'our' way' which uses a slightly different technique and will render a rice that is not the traditional Mexican texture. It will taste right, but will not have the right consistency. My problem was solved by following this recipe!

This rice is very good!  I made a double batch to go with Simple Carnitas from this site.  And I'm sure that the way I made the rice was even more spectacular because I used the broth from the carnitas recipe for half of the chicken broth.  Next time I will use the carnitas broth for all of it--it was just that good.

If you're looking for a perfect mexican rice recipe, look no farther!!  I have been looking for a recipe that would be close to what we get at our favorite mexican restaurant in AZ (Popo's in Glendale) and thought I'd give this a try.  I made this last night for my weekly "Fiesta Friday" dinner and it was incredible!  Everyone raved about how great it was!  I doubled my recipe and added garlic and a little bit more cumin, but one major change I made was to use BEEF BROTH instead of chicken...it was perfect!  Oh I also put the onions in with the rice while browning it to make sure they were nice and soft.  Make sure you take the time to brown your rice -- it made all the difference!!  It was fluffy, flavorful and muy delicioso!  With the change to beef broth, this was VERY close to Popo's rice.  Thanks to Mommyto2 from this mommyto4!!  Absolutely fantastic!  This will be a regular dish at our Fiesta Fridays!

This rice was fantastic! I make this all the time and it works with long grain white rice, basmati rice, chicken broth or I've used a bouillion cube and a cup of water. I've done this with 3 T dried minced onion or with fresh minced, it is still good no matter how you fix it. I cut this in half for just 3 of us and it worked out great. Thanks, this was one of the best dishes of mexican rice I've eaten anywhere.

I prepared this recipe as-is. No substitutions or additions added. Upon completion of this recipe, I have found this recipe unsatisfactory. Tweaking is very much needed in this recipe adding salsa, peppers,and garlic will definitely improve the taste. 3-stars for effort.

This is my favorite Mexican rice recipe. I add 1 Tsp. of cumin (I love cumin) and 1 Tsp. of chili powder to give it more flavor and a whole medium onion because it gives it more texture. It's great to serve as a side with enchiladas!

Very good and easy to prepare. I made this to put into layered burritos, but I think if I were to serve it as a side dish, I would probably added some mexican stewed tomatoes or something to it to give it even more flavor. P.S. For those of you getting brown colored rice instead of orange, this may be because the cumin is burnt; try adding the spices along with the broth and tomato sauce, instead of while the rice is browning.

This was a great recipe.  I had my 13 year old daughter make this while I was preparing the rest of the dinner and she had no problems with it.  We did cut back on the onion, since we're not big onion fans, and we added some diced green pepper.  She also let it simmer a few minutes longer than the recipe called for since we like our rice on the dry side.

Although this tasted basically like a rather bland Mexican rice, I had a few problems with it.  First, my rice wouldn't brown (we won't even talk about the puffy aspect), although I followed the directions to the letter.  Secondly, the rice wouldn't absorb all of the water and tomato sauce, even though I used a little extra rice and cooked it an extra ten minutes.  My toddler inhales Mexican rice in a restaurant. He demanded we remove this from his plate.  Please tell me what I'm doing wrong!!!

My first reveiew :-) I have to say I've used this receipe for years now. It's just great. Easy, delicious and like the restaurant rice. The only thing I changed was using the chicken broth with tomato in it from the Mexican market. Fabulous. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made two pans of this today. One was with Chicken Stock the other with Chicken Broth (I ran out of stock), personally I like the flavor of the Chicken Broth one better. Both turned out amazing! Other reviewers were right about not worrying if it does not fluff when you are sauteing the rice, it still turns out fluffy; taste and texture is just like my favorite Mexican Restaurant's :)

Love this rice! Made it several times since stumbling upon it 2 weeks ago. I will say I don't get the rice browned (I think it makes it crispy) I wait until it's 'clear' colored. Usually about 1-2 minutes of frying. I also saute the onions before also. We don't like Cumin so we add our own seasonings. I love how the chicken broth and tomato sauce compliment each other. I love the way this recipe turns out and so does my family and friends that have tried it!

This mexican rice is authentic! I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, add poblano peppers- chopped- to the rice when it's cooking, and add a 1/2 tsp or so of chili powder, and this is awesome! I also just use a whole 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, use chicken boillioun instead of chicken broth and cook it a few minutes more- it is SO good!

This mexican rice recipe is the best and is insanely easy and fun to make!  My teenaged son made it (with a little guidance from me).
Allow me to pass along one suggestion that I followed from another reviewer - use the homemade 'Taco Seasoning I' from this site as your spice. I used about 1 1/2 t. instead of the garlic salt and cumin. So good!

We had to keep adding rice and cooked it at least twice as long, but it was delicious!  Even the texture was just like our favorite Mexican restaurant (Chapallas Family Restaurant).  

Next time we'll cut the dry rice in half because it was huge and this will take care of the dryness factor.  Definitely a keeper!

If you read the other reviews you'll know that the rice doesn't puff at all. I've made this twice and both times I had to add more stock to the pot to get the rice cooked. I think I'll find a new recipe.

omg this was SO delicious!  i took Valerie's Kitchen's advice about using Taco Seasoning I from here in place of the garlic salt and cumin.  bf said it was just as good if not better than his ex's mom's mexican rice and that's saying a lot bc she's from mexico and is an awesome cook according to him.. ty so much for the recipe! ~~UPDATE: making this again 2.5 years later i thought to myself this seems like a lot of oil and maybe i should reduce it.. but i kept the amount the same.. the broth made me worry that it was going to be too salty.. even though i didn't complain about it in my first review..  i did half water half broth.. i should have trusted myself from the first time and did everything exactly as i had done it before.. it needed salt.. which was easily remedied by sprinkling some garlic salt over it but next time i'll be sure to make it the way i did the first time.. i'm sorry for doubting the submitter and myself!

Very good, simple, unassuming side dish.  Perfect complement to a strongly flavored main course.  I added a little green pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Easy and delicious -- the only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that I think it's a little oily. I doubled the recipe and fortunately did not use the website adjustment because it said to use 1/4 cup + 2 T oil. When I made it, I used 1/4 cup oil. I think next time I make this I'll use about half the amount of oil + a pat of butter.  Also, smells wonderful while it's cooking.

Made this last night and my husband said it was identical to restaurant version! Only thing I did differently was omitting chopped onion and just used dried minced. I figured they would have time to soften and they did. Good recipe!

This is a keeper, my rice came out perfectly! I made only three changes: I added green and red bell peppers, I used canned diced tomatoes because I did not have tomato sauce, and I used jasmine rice. It cooked quickly, and was delicious!

Made this over the weekend with enchiladas and my friend and I absolutely loved it. I will definitely be making this again. Couldn't ask for a better-tasting recipe that is fairly cheap and simple to make. Thanks for posting!

I make this rice all the time and what I do differently is use 1 can (14.5 oz.) diced tomatoes (do not strain away liquid, use that too) and garlic powder instead of garlic salt and use regular salt to taste.  I do not use chicken broth just plain water (1 1/2 cups).  When browning the rice, it will not puff in the pan.  It expands once it simmering in the pot.  I grew up eating this rice all the time and I decided to change from tomato sauce because that was all I could taste and using diced tomatoes gives it a nice light flavor/color and you can taste the rice as it all blends very nicely.  Try it, you'll like it!

I loved this side dish and it tastes like my local restaurant's version too. 

After reading a lot of the reviews, I added my normal taco seasonings at the same time as the salt (I used fine ground sea salt) and cumin: 1/4 tsp of paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, Mexican oregano, and a dash of cayenne pepper. 

I also bought the tomato sauce they sell on the Mexican food aisle of the grocery store, which only says tomato sauce on the container but seems a bit "amped" compared to the ones on the canned tomato aisle.
This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a little bland for my taste but good. I added some diced green pepper with the onion and one small diced jalapeno. The biggest change I made was to use brown instant rice and it worked surprisingly well. I altered the cook time and total liquid based on that so it wouldn't be wet or mushy. Simple side and I'll make it again but with a little more flavor added.

This was so good!  I made a few of my own additions, but basically stayed true to the recipe.  What I did to make this recipe my own was I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I feel like it just gives the dish a better taste.  I increased the amout of chopped onion and used 1 can of Rotel in place of the tomato sauce.  The end result was incredible.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  I made it for company tonight and they wanted a "doggy bag" to take home with them!  That is a very good sign that the meal was a success!

I have always sucked at making any sort or Mexican rice. To the point I just resorted to the yucky box stuff. This recipe changed my rice making life! I think the key is to take your time browning the rice. I cooked it on a medium type heat for several minutes, stirring it frequently. Do not leave the stove unattended. Was just great. I did take others advice and used taco seasoning (and the cumin), and used salsa instead of tomato sauce. Either way, I don't think you can go wrong. My husband could not stop talking about it. Making it again tonight, gonna try the tomato sauce this time.

Rave reviews at our dinner table, just the right blend of spices and flavors. This recipes tastes exactly like our favorite restaurant's version.  The directions are super easy to follow, could probably cut back on oil if desired, but we thought it was delicious just as it is written.

Amazingly good, my Mexican father-in-law said this is just exactly what he grew up with. I used vegetable buillion instead of chicken broth, fresh garlic and salt instead of garlic salt but I'm sure the results would have been just as good.

This is an excellent side dish for the Mexican Chicken recipe on this site.  The first time I made this exactly as written.  The second time I made it I did not intend to change anything but after the rice was in the pan, I realized I was all out of cumin so I substitued 1/4 tsp. chili powder and 1/4 tsp. of paprika.  Cumin is better but this worked well also.  Next time I'll try adding green peppers and red kidneys.

I've been looking for an easy recipe for Mexican rice that I could make at home.  I was excited to find this one as I had most of the ingredients on-hand to make it at the last minute.  I cooked the onions in oil first, and then added the rice.  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used the same measurement of diced tomatoes (included the juice and the tomatoes) and it still came out great.  I will definitely make again!  Thanks!

There is a reason that there are so many reviews, too...this dish is FANTASTIC! I change up just a few small things, not enough to classify as a new recipe, though. I don't have garlic salt available, so I add in 2 minced cloves and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder along with a teaspoon of sea salt. I've made this recipe so many times and I always go back to it. I featured it in my blog http://lifeinanarv.blogspot.com I have to say that this recipe is spot-on as far as what they serve as a side dish in a Mexican restaurant, if you try it, I promise that you won't be disappointed. Thanks for a GREAT recipe! If I could rate more than 5 stars, I would...

Good base recipe.  I added about 2 tsp chili powder, 2 tsp garlic powder, and one 10 oz. can drained, no salt added, corn and it was perfect!  I also grated my onion (1/2 medium yellow onion) into the pot since I don't care for the texture of chopped onion.

Hubby liked it a lot.  I thought it was good, but kind of bland.  I added a small squirt of fresh lime juice and some chopped fresh cilantro which helped a bit.  Maybe next time I'll add a few more spices, perhaps some chili powder or a couple pinches of taco seasoning.  All in all, a good basic recipe you can build on to suit your tastes.

this is definitely my go to recipe for mexican rice.  after making it several times, I have it just the way we like it at my house!
first, I saute the chopped onion in the oil till carmelized, and I use extra virgin olive oil.  once the onion is carmelized, I add the rice and toast it for a couple of minutes, before adding the rest of the ingredients.  in addition to the ingredients listed, I also sprinkle in some smoked paprika, gives it THE BEST flavor!!
lastly, after the rice is cooked, I drain and rinse a can of black beans, and add it to the rice till heated through
PERFECT beans and rice to serve with any mexican dish!

This recipe was not to my liking. It was not an  authentic and hearty dish like a real Mexican mama would make. :( Waste of good ingredients. I also used the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this website. That was a great mix and I recommend that for adding flavor to stuff.

This rice is fantastic!!  I worked in a Mexican Restaurant when I was younger and always loved the rice.  I tried to make it at home, but could never even come close.  THIS RICE IS IT!!!  Restaurant quality rice - and so simple!! 

Great recipe that I've been sharing with everyone who asks me about my yummy rice dish!

Good basic recipe; I didn't have tomato sauce, but used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes (juice and all) and only 1 cup of chicken broth- turned out great! Rice did not puff but I did brown until golden. 25 minutes was the perfect cook time.

This is a nice, basic side to serve with Mexican entrees. My hubs and I frequent a local Mexican restaurant that serves excellent rice with all of their entrees. Although not as good, this sure gives theirs a run for the money! Upon reading several reviews on here, it seems that many are having issue with browning / puffing the rice. If you follow Mommyto2's directions carefully, you shouldn't have any problem at all. I'm not sure my rice "puffed" up, but it did turn a nice golden brown color (which I think is key). After your rice is golden, sprinkle with the spices, stir quickly to incorporate and then add your onion. It should only take a minute or so for the onion to soften at which point you can add your liquids, cover, reduce the heat and start timing. Other than being slightly moister than the local restaurant's version, this is a dead on copycat. Thanks so much for sharing, Mommyto2. :-) this will be added to my regular rotation for sure!

This recipe has become a staple in my house! I was skeptical at first because the recipe I used to use for Mexican rice was so much more complicated, but this has given me consistently wonderful results time and time again. The texture is perfect, the taste is beautiful. The only thing I can say is that as written, it is a little bland. When stirring in the cumin, I also ad about a half a teaspoon each of chili powder and dried oregano, sometimes other things depending what I have on hand. Overall a fantastic recipe! Thanks, Mommyto2!

Tasty! Nothing fabulous and mind-blowing, but like another reviewer said, this rice compliments other dishes. As a request from my mom, I put this rice under the enchiladas I made and baked them together. She thought I pansied out and got a box recipe and was surprised I could cook something this good. Great combination!

SO YUMMY!! I took other reviewers' advice and sauteed onions with the rice, used salsa instead of tomato sauce and added a bit more liquid (broth) than written. It was really good. Also, use garlic powder instead of the garlic salt as the broth adds enough saltiness to the dish.

This turned out tasty, but just a couple of problems:  1.  After years of making risotto, I know that rice does not "puff" due to frying--liquid is required to make rice puff.  So your rice is not going to puff in step 1.  2.  This required as much as 2x as much liquid as specified in order to get the rice cooked past "al dente".  I was trying to make it for a dinner party and had to keep adding liquid.  Kinda stressful.  Everybody liked it, though.

So, I made this for the first time while hosting a party.  Using a long grain brown rice, I scaled the recipe 3-fold and substituted McCormick's Taco seasoning which I buy in a large container from Costco.  I also used a can of tomato paste since I didn't have tomato sauce and adjusted with some water.  I also made it ahead in my dutch oven, then reheated about 1/2 hour before serving, again checking that there was enough moisture in the pot so it wouldn't dry out.  Everything else, I followed the same, and it turned out great!  The fact that my 11 and 8 year olds liked it was an additional benefit.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Heavenly! I added 1 teaspoon of cumin instead of 1/2. I didn't have garlic salt, so I added 3 parts salt, 1 part garlic powder (still used 1 tsp). Perfect! I didn't see the browning and puffing of the rice though, but it was still perfect.

Didn't wait until the rice puffed, lightly browned was good enough.  Got the feeling, any longer would have burned the rice before puffing it.  Was pretty good, I'd make again but use a better pasta sauce to have a fuller flavour.

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for.  I made a few very small changes:  just a dash of olive oil in the pan to "brown" the rice, then added seasonings, chicken broth and tomato puree (not sauce, just because that is what I had) and dry minced onion.  After it was done I added some red pepper flakes and garlic powder.  I will be making this repeatedly.

THANK YOU SO MUCH! I've never been able to get rice quite right, and this really was "dummy proof"! Simple as can be, and taste great!!!!!!!! To those who "changed it up a bit" and didnt like the taste, the recipe is written to perfection!!!

I just love this simple Mexican rice recipe.  I know for those of you who make rice a lot, this recipe may not make a whole lot of sense (the ratio between rice and liquid).  I assure you it will turn out great.  Follow the directions EXACTLY and the rice will turn out perfect!  It is a wonderful side dish to any Mexican meal.  I actually could be happy just eating this by itself - it tastes so good!  : )

Not great:(  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have any tomato sauce, so I substituted salsa.  Not exactly the flavor I was going for and was quite salty.  I may try again & omit the garlic salt & use fresh garlic instead.

This was fantastic and easy to make.  I used fresh garlic and chopped red and green chilies (both hot and mild) and a bit of chopped tomatoes as well.  Tasted great!

I gave it 4 stars only because it was just a tad bland for us and that was even after doctoring it up by using 1/2 cup of medium salsa (next time I'll use hot), substituting 1/2 tsp of garlic powder for the garlic salt and upping the onion to a medium diced onion.  Simple to make, however, and we'll make it again with the changes.

I gave three stars because this is how I start out my mexican rice but I do some things differently.  I think mexican rice should be mildly flavored so it isn't necessary to add alot of extra seasoning as some reviewers added.  I have experimented many times with how much oil to use and 2 tablespoons is just right for cooking one cup of rice.  It important to saute your onions and garlic before adding the rice, otherwise by the time the onions are translucent the rice will be burned. Do not take the lid off as that interferes with the moisture and heat.  I have glass lids for my pan so I can see what's going on.  Towards the end I just shake the pan to prevent the rice from sticking.  Turns out perfectly every time.

Let me preface this review with this: I normally buy the Knorr/Lipton taco rice for taco night or when I make other Mexican-style food. However, in efforts to save money, I decided to give making my own rice a shot. While preparing my taco meat, I typed Mexican rice into the search engine and VOILA, up came this one. With so many reviews & high star rating, I knew it couldn't be bad. I was VERY pleased with the outcome.  The rice browned nicely in the oil, although I may try olive oil next time since it's a bit more healthy. I only had tomato paste, so I added some water to make it saucy. No chicken broth, so I dissolved 2 bouillon cubes... along with the cumin, I threw in a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Instead of garlic salt I added liberal amounts of garlic powder (probably 1/2-1 tablespoon). I followed everything else as written - delicious! Quick & easy and the best part is: I know exactly what's in it. No high sodium, no preservatives. I will never buy ready-made again. Thank you!! :)

sooo good! love it!    I made this rice and served it with"refried beans without the refry" -another recipe on this website.  They were both perfect together  a good tip someone gave me is to let the rice brown until it looks like the golden color of your ring (if you have a yellow gold ring)  that helped alot when making this.  I think with previous attempts making Spanish rice, I didn't let it brown enough.  This time, it was perfect!

This was a big hit.  Instead of the tomato sauce, I added 3/4 cup RoTel brand diced tomatoes with green chilies.  My husband said it tasted better than our favorite Mexican restaurant's Mexican rice.

This is a great authentic Mexican Rice recipe! A Mexican friend told me how her mother makes Mexican Rice, and this recipe is almost exactly the same, except for the chicken broth. Some use water or half broth and water, but that is just personal preference. I like it with broth, since it gives a fuller flavor. But either way, this is a really tasty rice!

Very good, I used brown rice instead of regular white rice, added 1/2 an onion, 1/2 a red pepper and 1/2 a green pepper finely diced, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian, a big hit!

The rice came out wonderful. I added a couple of tsps of "Mexican seasoning" which had garlic, cumin and many other spices and that gave it a wonderful flavour.  I also used fresh tomato pureed in the food processor instead of the paste.  Would recommend checking for dryness after 15-20 mins and add a bit more water if required. Mine needed a bit.  Thanks a lot for sharing this absolutely awesome and simple recipe.

Not great, not horrible either. Non-descript. This was a great side dish for the enichiladas that I made because it didn't compete for the best flavor. It was easy to make but came out lacking moisture and flavor to reach a keeper for our family.

This was excellent!  I followed the instructions exactly, but added a little bit of Tastefully Simple Fiesta Party Dip Mix to spice it up.  After it was done on the stove top.  I needed to keep it warm, so I put it in the oven covered and it did not dry it out at all.  Even the next day microwaved for leftovers, it was excellent.

Another quick and tasty trick is to use a jar of salsa instead of the tomato sauce, onion, etc. Puree the salsa and broth( or water) in a blender and then add the mixture to the browned rice to cook. It gives great flavor and requires no chopping!

Really good!  Of course I used 1.5 tsp of my trusty Emeril's Southwestern Essence for the spices.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Be sure to watch your heat so the rice doesn't dry out (every stove is different). After fluffing the rice, put the lid right back on it to let it wet steam a bit more because there may be some crunchies at the bottom.  This is such a simple, tasty recipe that I'll never go back to the boxed stuff again!!  Will go great with the "Refried Beans Without The Refry" recipe also on this site.

I modified this as well. It is an excellent base and as close to authentic Mexican rice as one can get.  I personally took out the cumin and garlic salt and replaced the tomato sauce w/ diced tomatoes. My rice did not "puff" during the browning process.  First I browned the rice, added onion, added chopped garlic cloves. Next I added the tomatoes stirred and cooked for a min then added liquids (water and chicken broth), then added salt for taste.  I prefer salt and garlic cloves instead of garlic salt, but if I didn't have cloves I would have added the garlic salt.  Family and friends love this and ask me to make it all the time.

Also hint...once you add everything and stir let it sit, maybe stir once to prevent buring right after you turn the burner off, but leave rice alone it needs to rest.

Instead of using the skillet, I just threw all the ingredients in my rice cooker and it turned out wonderful (and only took 3-4 minutes to prep). Very easy, very yummy.

This is a wonderful recipe ... perfect as it stands ... or easy enough to add ingredients to fit ones perferred taste.  I prepared exactly as described ... and though there was little browning or popping of my rice either, it didn't matter.  I just proceded after a few minutes of tossing around in the skillet and then softening the onion.  I also served this with the Chicken Enchiladas I recipe,the Red Enchilada Sauce and the Canned Corn Casserole found on this site. All combined for a very complimary and tasty mexican dinner, which ALL enjoyed.  ONE NOTE: if you choose to do all the recipes mentioned, and you boil your chicken for the enchiladas in water seasoning with chicken bouillon, you can simply use that broth for all the remaining preparations for these recipes where water is called for, but replaced with chicken broth/stock.  I highly recommend doing so for added flavor.  :O)

I really liked this recipe and so did my husband.  I tried it with different kinds of rice and my favorite was brown rice. Really easy.

My friend who is from Mexico, uses one whole dried Anaheim pepper, a cube of Spanish tomato bullion and chicken stock. Has more flavor and you just remove the stem from the pepper before serving.

I like to throw in about 1/4 C frozen corn when the broth is added.  Reminds me of the rice you get in the taco shops here in San Diego.  Of course this wouldn't be complete without a side of refried beans topped with a bit of cheese.

Wow I can't believe how easy it was to make this. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! It was a great base recipe. The next time I tried it and added in the Taco Seasoning I(from this website 
    *  1 tablespoon chili powder
    * 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
    * 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
    * 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper  
      flakes
    * 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
    * 1/2 teaspoon paprika
    * 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
    * 1 teaspoon sea salt
    * 1 teaspoon black pepper
Adjust how you like. I just eyed the seasonings. This time it turned out delicious!

This is the best Mexican rice I've ever had! Instead of tomato sauce I used Rotel tomatoes and chicken broth to equal the amount of liquid needed for the rice and I added some chopped Poblano chilis and a can of chopped green chilis. My family will never eat packaged Spanish rice mix again. Everyone even commented on how pretty it looked.

This turned out good. I did have to add more water for the rice to soften up. Besides that everyone at my dinner table enjoyed it w/ some chicken enchiladas.

My husband said this is even better than what his mother use to make. The only change I made was to use fresh garlic in place of garlic salt.

This was great... I didn't have any onion, so I used salsa instead of tomato sauce, and then did 1/2 tsp. garlic powder instead of garlic salt, since the salsa has enough salt and a bit of garlic. I also used veggie broth, since it's what I had. Easy and great with refried beans and cheese inside tortillas.

I made this recipe with the Crisco Chicken Enchiladas when we had guests over a couple of weeks ago, and they both helped themselves to seconds! That's when you know it's good! The only changes I made were reducing the oil to 1T. and adding 2-3 T. of salsa with the tomato sauce. This really pumps up the flavor.

Muy bien!  I used 1 Tbsp. of oil & didn't have a problem at all with the rice.  I really liked this recipe due to the fact that it was easy on sensitive tounges, my 18 mo. old LOVED it & ate an adult helping!  If I were making it for the adults only, I would add an 8 oz. can of Rold Gold sauce with the jalepenos in it & some fresh chopped cilantro, YUM.  Thanks for the great recipe Sylvia!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I used dried minced onions for the real minced onions and I used 2 oz of tomato paste for the tomato sauce, because I didn't have them.  It still turned out great.  This is a good recipe to prepare with the "chicken enchiladas II" recipe.

Cooked the rice in oil then added a large minced shallot to soften, plus 1/2 tsp salt. Bloomed the cumin and 1/2 tsp garlic powder in the rice mixture before adding 1/2 cup of red enchilada sauce (since I was making chicken enchiladas). Used chicken stock instead of water and reduced the amount to 1.5 cups (2 cups made this rice too mushy). The garlicky shallot + enchilada sauce in place of tomato sauce really kicked up the flavors of this tasty side dish. Delish!

Just made this recipe--as in it is still on the stove waiting to be eaten! It smells SO GOOD and tastes even better. We did substitute a can of Rotel tomatoes for the tomato sauce it gave it a bit of a kick. Can't wait to have it for dinner!

I also wasn't able to get my rice to puff up in the oil.  That happened when I added the tomato sauce and chicken broth.  This was my first time making Spanish rice and I was pleased with the result.  I used a tsp of taco seasoning instead of cumin (that's what the chicken recipe I made called for) and it was very good.  I'll make this again!

I rate this a 5 stars. I loved this rice dish. I made a couple slight changes. I used 1/4 cup of pineapple chipotle salsa and used only a 1/4 cup of tomato sauce... I also diced a medium tomato and added it to the sauce right after I added the stock to the rice. Everyone loved it. Served it as a side dish with Chili Releno casserole from All recipes. Together they were Scrumptious~~~

Oh my goodness!  This is a GREAT recipe!  I tried it once without changing anything and it was alright, tasted... tomatoey.   The next time I made it I added 1/2 a teaspoon of tumeric and instead of plain tomato sauce, I used a small can of El Pato, which a friend suggested.  After that, it was amazing!  Better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant!

I prefer using butter instead of oil, the oil makes it very greasy.  Also I found it better with onion powder, and adding paprika.

Very good basic recipe and had all ingredients on hand.  This will be a family staple on Mexican food nights.  I may tweak in the future to add a bit more spice and heat, but this truly was great as is.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a pretty good basic Mexican rice recipe. I have tried many and haven't found any that were right or that my kids would eat but we all enjoyed this rice. I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe is perfect!! I didn't have garlic salt so I used about 1/2 tea regular salt and about 1/2 tea garlic powder… Came out great. It tasted exactly how it does at my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant!

I used half veg oil and half butter to sautee onion first then added rice to get that toasted rice flavor. I then followed other reviewer suggestion of using Taco Seasoning recipe from this site and added about a T and a half, then added 2 C of beef broth only because that's what I had opened already. Instead of tomato sauce I used diced tomatoes flavored with green chilis. It came out scrumptious but then again I kinda freestyle the whole recipe lol

Delicious!  I made according to directions adding 1/2 salsa instead of tomato sauce plus a liberal sprinkle of taco seasoning.  I  served this as a side dish to the Salsa Chicken found on this site.  My hubby thought he was in heaven!  Thank you.

I found this recipe after becoming bored with the per packaged versions of Mexican rice or Spanish rice. Plus I always seem to have these ingredients on hand. I love this recipe because it easy, fast and always delicious. I halved the recipe to make just enough for two gigantic pillow beef burrito for my bf and I. Thank you for the recipe

A good start, but this needs more spices. Follow this recipe, but let your imagination go, garlic, more chili powder, cayenne, enchilada sauce etc.

I made this today with two adjustments. First, I used 1 1/3 cups rice as I was concerned there would be a soupy tomato sauce consistency and used a full tsp. of cumin. It turned out just perfect. We all loved the texture and flavor. Will make again.

The texture was great. But the flavor was only so-so. Not bad, but not what I get at a local Mexican Restaurant. It was a little too salty and tasted too much like a taco seasoning packet. I may try again with less cumin and maybe fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.

I love this Mexican rice recipe. And with just a few minor additions I would give it five stars. The first time I made it I liked it quite a bit but I felt it needed more texture. So I increased the onion to slightly more than 1/3 of a cup, and I add one rib of small-diced celery at the same time as the onion. (I also use just less than 1/4 t. of cumin, but that's because of personal taste). And with five minutes to go, I add tomatos (2 Roma tomatoes, cored and diced). Adding the celery and the tomato gives it more visual appeal and also a little more texture, but doesn't really change the taste. I think this is such a great base recipe that can be altered to accommodate anyone's personal tastes. I love that the end product looks restaurant-quality, but it doesn't much effort to achieve it!

This is the best recipe I've found on this site! I make it at least 2 times a week with dinner. My husband is from Mexico and he always asks me to make this side dish! I made it for my sister and her inlaws as well and she was calling me days later asking how to make this rice. Just make sure when you're cooking the rice you don't lift the lid to check on it while it's cooking! Or else it will come out mushy :( let it cook on low covered for 25 min and it will be perfect! Thank you so much for this recipe :)

I followed this recipe from start to finish and did not care for it at all. It was all wrong the flavor was over the top very overwhelming and the rice itself was a gritty mush. :(

Y'ALL. I didn't even have all of the required ingredients, and this was PERFECT!

I live in Texas and I LOVE LOVE LOVE refried beans and rice that you get at (Tex)Mexican restaurants. I had resigned myself to believing that you just can't make that kind of rice at home. WRONG!

This was delicious. I will definitely make it again. Just like the restaurants.

Here's my adjustments:
Omitted onion (too lazy to chop right now...)
Used a squirt of ketchup instead of tomato sauce (weird right? it totally worked! I would reduce amount of tomato sauce in original recipe)
used rice from a boil in a bag pouch that I cut open.
added chili powder and paprika.

BOOM!

Thanks!!

Best Fried Rice I have ever had. I use 2-3 minced garlic cloves & regular salt because I don't have garlic salt. After I stir in tomato sauce; I transfer the mixture into a rice cooker add a cup of mixed frozen vegetables and chicken broth, stir and walk away. This makes it even easier. This is a popular re-occurring dish in my house. It's great to take to a pot-lock as my friends always ask me to bring it. They love it!

Made this rice today for the first time. I didn't stir as "constantly" as I should have and I think the cumin got a bit too toasty. My family thought it was great. I did double the recipe. Next time I will decrease the oil- maybe using coconut oil.  I might use a little more chicken broth.  The recipe is fine as written- just some thoughts.

I wish I could give this six stars--this is why:  There's a Mexican joint around where I grew up that has rice EXACTLY like this.  Now older and in the military, I rarely get to eat that delicious side dish.  This recipe is 99% dead on.  I make it any time my family has Mexican food.  Now if I could only reproduce their salsa...

Family friendly flavor as is. Great foundation recipe. Recipe will withstand many additions, garlic, green pepper, tomatoes, jalapeños, corn, cilantro. Top with sour cream, cheese, or hot sauce...The possibilities are endless!

I cooked this tonight for our Lifegroup and while it was pretty tasty it also turned out kind of mushy. I make a serving for 12.

I had hoped this recipe would be like my favorite Mexican restaurant's rice - and I was not disappointed!! This was my first time attempting mexican rice, and the recipe was very simple. My mexican restaurant does not put onions in their rice, so that was the only change I made. I think the garlic salt should be 'to taste' because I had to add a bit more than it called for - some may prefer less. PERFECT MEXICAN RICE is right here. And to the people saying it's bland - Mexican rice isn't supposed to be a show-stopper. It is a simple side, not meant to have a ton of things added to it, like bell peppers - that's SPANISH rice! Just my two cents. :) MAKE IT!

This was good & easy. My only complaint was that the liquid kept absorbing and the rice still wasn't done, had to keep adding liquid until the rice finally cooked through.

I've been using this recipe for years and realized I forgot to leave a rating!  It's perfectly delicious, a great addition to homemade Mexican dinner night. I just made it last night actually, and I was in a hurry and used a half teaspoon of granulated onion instead of chopping an onion and my hubby said he liked it better this way!  I also always use a half teaspoon salt and a half teaspoon granulated garlic instead of the full teaspoon garlic salt.

Tastes just like the side dish you would get in any mexican restaurant. Won't knock your socks off, but is exactly what you would expect and want. Followed directions exactly and it turned out perfect.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It was so easy to make and tasted even better than what I've had at Mexican restaurants. I added about a Tbsp of minced jalapeno pepper for a little kick.

First time making Mexican rice. This was a wonderful recipe. It was served as side dish to compliment enchiladas. I added 1/2 can of corn niblets for color and texture. YUM! Thanks, Mommyto2!

Exactly what I was looking for!  I wanted a simple side dish of Mexican rice, this was perfect.  As other reviewers suggested, I put the (finely diced) onion in first, used a diced clove garlic instead of the garlic salt, and only 1 TBS of tomato *paste* as I don't like it too tomato-ey. I used 2 tsp of Knorr's Caldo de Tomate, tomato bouillon w/ chicken flavor.  I couldn't stop eating the rice!  Paired with Buffy's Refried Beans from this site and I was in heaven.

Loved this recipe. Easy to follow and contained ingredients that I keep around the house. My only issue was that the rice started to dry out a bit early and needed a bit more liquid. I had to add more chicken broth after cooking for about 18 minutes. I am cooking at high altitude, so perhaps add more liquid if you are too.

I love this recipe!  I have fixed probably 10 times and it is always fantastic.  I add extra cumin because I love the flavor.  Very easy to make.  I have made it with extra tomato sauce but like it better with the recommended amount.  Going to fix today!!!

I made this recipe in the Rice Cooker, just dumped all of the ingredients into the slow cooker adjusting the Chicken Broth to be 1.5 cups.  I omitted the vegetable oil, save myself a few calories.  I thought it was pretty good.  I would definitely make this again, adding in a bit more onion I think, personal taste and maybe some minced garlic.  There is room to play around.

4.5 stars. Great.  I didn't have garlic salt so I added 1/2 tsp of salt and 2 cloves of garlic, minced.  I added 1/2 tsp of chili powder as a reviewer suggested.  I had it with ground meat, crushed up tortillas chips, lettuce, onion, salsa, and cheese.  Great dinner!

Thanks for this most perfect recipe. Now everyone can enjoy the secret. I prefer to use only 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce but either way works. Two things that make this turn out perfect is 1. (with practice) you'll know it is time to add the onion when the aroma of 'toasted' rice is just right. 2. after putting on the lid, do not stir or peek until the rice is done.

I loved this reciepe!!!  I followed the instructions and added some taco seasoning to the receipe.  I eyeballed the amount, but it was probably about a Tablespoon or so of taco seasoning.  The only thing I changed was I didn't use rice, I used quinoa!!!  A healthier option and it tasted AMAZING!

Since I found this recipe, I seriously make it about once a week. It's great. I usually add salsa instead of the tomato sauce because I have it on hand. Also, If you prefer dry rice it helps to put it in the oven on about 350 for a few minutes after it's done. That just gets rid of the excess moisture.

This rice is a perfect foil for a spicier topping/main dish. If you're looking for something that won't overpower a main dish, this is it. Otherwise I think it is a bit bland on its own, and needs "something" to zip it up.

This was my first time making mexican rice.  I added fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, used vegetable broth, a little chili powder, and jasmine rice.  I was worried about it tasting to tomatoy, but it had good flavor.  My friend helped me make it, and while I was dicing the onion and garlic she was browning the rice.  She starting freaking out when it started to puff.  It was really funny and we enjoyed making it.

This just might be my new recipe for mexican rice.  It has a fantastic flavor.  I made it exactly as written, except I added a little bit of chopped green pepper.  I think maybe that 2 cups of chicken broth is a little too much as my rice was a little softer than I prefer.  But, that is just my preference.  Will definitely make again using a little less broth.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very authentic. My husband loved it! And he is my authority on authenticity :) His sister has a version that involves making your own tomato sauce, but as I am pressed for time most nights, this recipe works out great. Definitely a keeper.

What serendipity! I was looking for the perfect side dish to my pollo fajitas when I stumbled across this recipe. It's' so simple! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I substituted with a roma tomato and ketchup (blended). I threw all the ingredients into my rice cooker. When it was done, I gave it a stir and let it cool while I worked on my main dish. Then, I fried it in my wok. My family loved it!

I never could get the rice to puff up... one or two pieces did puff up almost like popcorn, but that was it.  I was really worried that it wouldn't turn out right.  Be very careful with your heat, because the rice can burn very easily.  I learned that the hard way with my first batch and had to start all over from scratch.  Don't worry if your rice doesn't puff up.  Mine didn't but it still turned out just like mexican restaurant rice.

This was my second time trying this recipe. Unfortunately it still didn't turn out. The rice is way too hard; the pieces that actually cooked are mushy. No flavor whatsoever. I really wanted to find a recipe for rice that tastes restaurant-worthy. This isn't a good recipe. I'm amazed it has such a high rating overall.

Easy to make, and turned out great.  I used a bit more than 1/4 cup of onion, and I also added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped green peppers.  I'll definitely be making this whenever I cook Mexican food.

Made it for my 1st time for my co-workers and we all enjoyed it. The only thing is it was kind of bland and needed more flavor. So next time, I would add a little more salt than the recipe calls for and much more cumin.

Wow I finally made mexican rice!  I 'browned and fluffed' it on the stove, then put it along with the liquid into a rice cooker.  The texture was like real mexican rice!  Something I've never been able to do!!  I don't think I added enough salt but I'm a salt-a-holic - that's what I get for eyeballing the spices!  I also cooked the onion in the oil before adding the rice and used fresh garlic.  SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS RECIPE!!  Thank you!!!!!

Browning of the rice in oil took quite a while! Didn't time. Texture of rice was absolutely awesome. However, not as flavorful as I'd like. In the future, I'll try using a scratch chx broth (vs. bouillon cubes), maybe a can of green chilies or something else. Great base, but I tihnk it needs a little more oomph.

Love this recipe!! I make it almost exactly as written, with just a few changes to my liking ( I have made it as written too, just as good). The only things I do differently are: 1) instead of tomato sauce, I puree a can of mexican stewed tomatoes and use a full cup of that and 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, 2) After the rice is done cooking in the pot, I will throw it in a skillet pan and toast it up a bit. So delicious!

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't my favorite rice. Of course, I am biased towards the mexican restaurant in town and anything that doesn't taste close to that isn't that great to me. That being said, this rice isn't that bad.

A pretty good dish.  It need some diced peppers in it though.  I'll make it again using taco or fajita seasonings.

Very good.  I have made it several times, always with success.  It is especially good if you add shrimp.  Also, I add on fresh, finely chopped cayenne pepper.  It gives it an extra kick.  If you don't like things too spicy (like me) only add half a pepper. Pop the pepper in when you put in the salt and cumin.

Very good recipe! I did modify it a bit due to not having Chicken Broth and tomato sauce though. I used Jasmine rice, a can of regular Rotel (drained) and "Better than Bouillon" Chicken Broth mix. This gave it a slightly saltier (just a little) and spicier (jalapeno's in the Rotel) taste. Next time I may go with mild Rotel, but either way it was delicious. Like other reviews, if the rice doesn't puff much when cooking in the veg. oil, the broth will certainly puff it up and make it perfect.

Really good recipe! I tried this for our "build your own burrito" night. Everyone was really impressed by how authentic the rice tasted. And as leftovers, when people smelled the rice they asked which restaurant I got it from.

Really good.  Next time I will only use 1 1/2 T of oil and 1-1/2 tsp of chili powder in addition to the cumin. I used water and bullion and it was a little salty, next time I will do garlic powder and bullion. Worth a try!

Tried other mexican rice recipes on this site. They were good, but more time consuming and not AS GOOD as this one. Thank you for posting this recipe! A family fav!

This was great! I added 1 tsp of taco seasoning with the other spices, then added chopped cilantro after it was done. Delicious!

As is, this recipe gets a three. It's not bad but it was a bit bland for my tastes. But the 2nd time I made it I used butter instead of veggie oil, a cup of canned diced tomatoes (with sauce), and used a packet of taco seasoning to season it. Oh, and since I increased the flavor with the seasonings I cut back on the chicken broth and replaced about half of if with water to prevent it from being too salty.  Now that was 5 stars!

Awesome recipe! I will never buy boxed mexican rice again. The only thing I changed from the recipe was using a can of rotel instead of just the tomato sauce.

This tastes like a true Mexican rice.  I personally prefer something with a little more flavor - but, my husband really liked it.  If you are looking for a rice that tastes like your local Mexican restaurant as a good side dish to the star of the meal - this fits the bill.

The liquid turned out to be way too much, for me. I think the tomato paste adds water. I would cut it back to a cup and a half.

Very good, and will defiantly use again with a few improvisions. I doubled recipe, and added 1 tsp of taco teasoning, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt. I think I will add more taco seasoning next time. Otherwise, great recipe!

Maybe this would have come out better if it had been make in a rice cooker. Me nor my husband cared for it. Too mushy and did not taste authentic at all. On a positive note, my two year old gobbled it up

This tasted great!  A lot better than the store-bought kind that has a ton of sodium.  I took one star off because it was just too sticky.  I think I might wash the rice before cooking it next time.

This is a simple yet delicious Mexican rice. I made a few changes, including using 3/4 of the amount of garlic powder instead of garlic salt and adding some onion powder and a little extra cumin. I kept the overall amount of liquid the same but changed the ratio of chicken broth and tomato sauce (a little less broth, a little more tomato sauce) and the flavor came out really nice. Also, the recipe says it makes 4 servings, but it's more like 5-6 hearty portions.

I've never had authentic Mexican rice. The recipe itself was good, but not spectacular. I didn't have any problem with the rice puffing, and cooking time and liquids amount were accurate.

I didn't really care for this.  To me it was way too "tomatoey", and didn't taste like the rice they serve at Mexican restaurants.

Teenage son's favorite food in the world. He was motivated enough to learn how to cook it, even. Any leftovers from large batch are eaten 100% of the time by the next evening. For seasoning, we use 2 T Penzey's Arizona dreaming, some garlic salt, and 3 t Penzey's dried bell peppers. Son likes to add Penzey's dried jalapenos also, about 1 t.

Love!  I tried doing it with salsa instead of tomato sauce and it was even better.  I didn't have any garlic salt, so I used garlic powder.

My family really liked this.  It fluffed up much more than other Mexican Rice recipes that I have tried.  It makes a good backdrop to a flavorful meal.  I would like it to be more flavorful itself, but that is easily done with more spices. Instead of using chopped onion, I pureed the onion with a clove of garlic(I did not have the garlic salt and used regular salt) in a bit of the chicken broth.  I added it at the time suggested and let cook for a minute before adding the rest of the broth and tomato sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy, I made this tonight to go with some marinated grilled chicken.  I only gave it four stars because I used fresh garlic, which I added with some cumin seed after the onions were soft already, and the other thing was I used a little extra water and gave it a couple of careful stirs to prevent sticking.  Oh I also threw in some extra salt to cover for the added water.

I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used 1/4 cup of chipotle sauce and 1/4 cup pasta sauce.  And to make it truly vegetarian, I used vegetable boullion cubes (2) with 2 cups of water.  Turned out delicious!  The cumin and chipotle were the perfect blend of spice.

This is tasty and simple.  I must agree that the second time I made it I added a few teaspoons of Taco seasoning instead of the Cumin.  And a couple of pickled Jalapeno pepper slices to give it a little kick.

I cook the onion for about 5 min first. Also added in garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, and a dash of cayenne pepper. This is definitely a great recipe with those additions!

This is an excellent recipe for mexican rice. My father raved about it and he is a harsh reviewer. I cooked the onion with the oil and a little bit of butter before adding the rice. Other than that... DELICIOUS as is.

I love this recipe! It is the perfect mexican rice to accompany any dish. For the people saying that it is not spicy enough, substitute mexican tomato sauce like "el pato" for normal tomato sauce, it definately gives it a kick.

Love this.  I improvised a little.  Started with oil and little butter in pan sautéed the onion w/ little garlic till fragrant then add rice and seasoning. 2 mins later add the tomato paste and chicken stock to deglaze.  Simmer, stir occasionally.

it's amazing. i'm sure it could be made with half the oil, with the same results. I'll give that a go next time, which i'm sure will be soon. This stuff is amazing.

A very nice, low-maintenance rice dish.  I did not use garlic salt, but rather finely chopped fresh garlic and sea salt.  This is not a dish to be showcased in a meal but a tasty side.  I'll use it again when necessary.   Addendum:  First batch was a touch mushy and salty so I backed off on the salt and broth second time around.  MUCH BETTER...fluffier and not as salty.

I've made this one several times, as posted, and just made it again, using beef broth, as I was out of chicken.  It was FANTASTIC!  It's a favorite of ours, when we're having fajitas.  It's just like they make at the restaurants.  :)

I just made this today and I have to say, this was pretty good. I had to substitute some things though. Instead of garlic salt, I just added a finely chopped garlic clove and a pinch of salt. And instead of regular tomato sauce, I used "El Pato" tomato sauce. It has a blend of spices and chilies that gave this rice a nice edge. And since I didn't have any chicken broth, I made my own using a chicken bullion cube and boiling it in in 3 cups water. I decided to use a bit more water when I read other reviews about the rice not being fully cooked.

Delicious!  I followed the advice of someone else and added my own homemade taco seasoning instead of just cumin and garlic salt.  Came out perfect.  I added leftover corn and black bean salsa to 1/2 of the rice for the adults.  I served it with grilled beer and lime chicken and ice cold Corona's.  Perfect summer time meal!

Absolutely wonderful! I make as directed, but one change. I made the rice as directed on the rice box (boil and simmer). Then added cooked rice with other ingredients, bringing to a simmer. It turns out much better this way. We love to eat this rice in a flour tortilla with seasoned pork loin, shredded cheese, salsa and sour cream. It's a top 5 favorite for dinner! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is VERY simple. I've been trying to make Mexican rice for a many years and can not seem to get it right. I made this lastnight and my 7 year old son loved it and my husband said it was "okay". I will for sure make this dish again but add more spices.

We weren't all that fired up over this rice.  Not something my family really enjoyed and we did not eat the leftovers.  Sorry, but I will probably not make again.

Tasted great- only thing I changed- was subbed Ketchup (I know it sounds gross) instead of tomato sauce.  And you know what- it was REALLY good! :)

Good simple recipe.  I used brown rice instead so it took a bit longer.  Also, mine did not "fluff."  I don't think it was anything wrong with the recipe.  I had to add more liquid to cook the brown rice longer.  Would definitely make this again.

This was great. I have made it twice. 1) Followed recipe to a T, pretty good. 2) Improvised & customised: I had a spare packet of taco sauce & taco seasoning from a taco kit, so I used the taco sauce in place of tomato sauce and half a packet of taco seasoning in place of cumin. I also added red & green bell peppers, corn, a rasher of bacon minced and 1/2 lime juiced. Needless to say I got RAVE reviews! My friends said it was restaurant quality, I aim to please :)

I found this recipe about a year ago, and I have never even tried to look for another.  It captures exactly what I was looking for from my Grandmothers kitchen.  The kids even loved it and always ask for it.  Easy to make and the perfect compliment to any dish.

Good, solid recipe.  I used the taco seasoning recipe  from allrecipes instead of cumin, as suggested by another reviewer.  It had lots of kick and came out very nicely.  I'm using this rice for making burritos to freeze.

Yum.... I used the Mexican rice to make burritos and it was delicious! As always, I made adjustments. I only used 1 cup of broth, and instead of tomato sauce I used one tomato. Green peppers were also added.

This was a very nice side dish for my chicken enchiladas and was also good in tacos.  I used brown rice and eyeballed the seasonings.  I may try it again with white rice, my brown rice always comes out a bit mushy.  I also used chopped tomatoes with green chiles (no tomato sauce) that I pureed in the blender with one chipotle in adobo sauce.  I will definately make this again.

This rice was so good I couldn't stop eating it!!!  I didn't have any garlic powder, but added fresh garlic.  I served it with the mexican fish recipe from this site with fresh lime and it was a really good easy weeknight meal.  I will make this again and again!

excellent recipe!   switched it up a bit -- used brown rice sauteed, added 2 cloves roasted garlic, doubled cumin, and added dried chopped onion, chili powder, adobo seasoning and smoky paprika...(TBSP of each)  also a pinch of cayenne pepper.    everyone loved it --made to go w/ taco pie!

Fabulous! This is just like the kind at my favorite restaurant, only better!  I used 2 crushed garlic cloves and kosher salt instead of garlic powder.  It was perfect!

This rice was very good! I'm giving it 4 stars, I did think that 3 Tablespoons was too much oil. I used all three but I will try two next time, as the rice was very oily. I was out of tomato sauce so I used 1/2 cup of medium salsa instead and it actually added great flavor! I think I will always use salsa in it from now on. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is really good for a quick side dish - better than Lipton or Rice-a-Roni, not as good as restaurant rice. It's easy to make and low on ingredients, which I like. I did use more diced onion than called for and chicken stock instead of broth because that's what I had on hand. For cooking time, instructions should be on your rice box. I used extra long grain brown, so I had to cook for 40 minutes.

Yum. Nice side dish with Mexican meals, I mix it with Mexican seasoned beef or chicken and top a Taco Salad.

Read review- re too much liquid so was concerned but followed as directed and no problem at all.  Very easy to make.  Overall quite good will make again. In the future would cut back the oil by 25%and maybe add finely chopped green pepper and add some heat.  PS use low sodium broth or too salty.

This is the best recipe i have to say i have been looking for a mexican rice recipe that is just like the restauants and this is it.  i didnt have to add any salt which is great i dont like adding salt to foods. in my opinion this is better then restaurant rice.i will try using sodium free or  sodium  Chicken broth to cut down even more on the salt. but over all awesome recipe.. thank s for sharing.

it didnt work at all! next time i think ill cook the rice before hand, the rice never softened up, i think because of cooking it in the oil first sort of 'fried' the rice hard. i dont consider myself an expert cook but i am a pretty good one and made this for some soldiers tonight to go along w/ chili colorado and i wasnt able to serve it. they all ate it anyways and agreed, it wasnt good. soldiers will eat anything... MRE's are better!

First of all I must admit that I'm a rice addict. I love ALL rice.  This rice was good and went well with our mexican dinner.  The next day with the left overs, I added chorizo sausage, green onions, red & green peppers and minced garlic.warmed it all up and added mexican cheese on top.   Two different meals.  Thanks

Good, but I thought it could have used some more spices. I may add a little taco seasoning or some more cumin next time, but I will definitely make it again.

So good and exactly like you get in an authentic restaurant! Cumin could be dialed down a bit if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, but otherwise delicious.

This recipe just didn't work for us, sorry. I had to omit the onions for health reasons, but followed the recipe otherwise. The tomato flavor was a little overwhelming, and I couldn't taste the garlic or cumin at all. But, it was worth a try with so many great reviews.

Excellent recipe. I doubled the batch and followed to a tee. This rice had the texture of a cloud and the subtle flavors that accompany a Tex/Mexican meal perfectly. Served with homemade tortillas, left over pork roast cooked in sofrito,  frijoles refritos and fresh farm cheese.

This is the only thing I will make on Taco night now.  Hubby & daughter love it.  The only thing I change is subbing a can of Rotel tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  I puree them a bit in my small food processor before adding them.  Absolutely delicious.  Garnish with chopped green onions and shredded cheese.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

GET YOUR FRANK'S OUT & GET READY TO SMILE.....THIS WAS SOOOOOOOO TOTALLY DELICIOUS, YET SO EASY! I NEVER CHANGE A RECIPE THE FIRST TIME, BUT I WAS OUT OF TOMATO SAUCE SO I SUBSTITUTED A CHOPPED FRESH TOMATO & IT WAS NIRVANA! WE ENJOYED THIS WITH FAYE'S "SALSA CHICKEN" & ALONG WITH THE HOT SAUCE WE HAD SOUR CREAM ON THE SIDE. WE DIDN'T SPEAK WHILE EATING IT WAS SO GOOD! THANKS AGAIN MOMMYTO2!

Just like the restaurant!  I recalculated it for 16 servings (Christmas dinner side).  Don't worry about it 'puffing' just toast the rice a little in the oil and continue on with the recipie-- it WILL turn out.  Very mild and basic, just authentic Mexican restaurants serve.  If you want to spice it up, knock yourself out and put whatever you want in it, but Mexican rice is usually very mild to balance the heat from the main dish.  This is a very good recipe and I know it will be devoured by all at Christmas dinner.  Mi gusta!

I made this again and I'm glad I did because it came out much better this time.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because that's all I had at the time and it still tatsed good.

Excellent recipe.  This taste just like rice at a Mexican restaurant.  Between this recipe and "Refried Beans without the Refry" here on this site, I can make authentic side dishes for a Mexican feast.  Wonderful recipe! Thank you!  I may try reducing oil to 2 tablespoons next time I make though. Fat adds flavor so I can't be too stingy.

My boyfriend loved this rice, but I wasn't too thrilled by it.  It seemed to be missing something.  I'll probably keep this as a base and then tweak with it a little bit more. Also, I cooked it in the rice cooker as suggested by another user... it came out way better than any rice i've made in a skillet, will definitely do again.

This was very simple and tasty.  Like others have stated, its flavors are very mild and meant to accompany a main entree rather than compete with it.  It complimented our spicy chicken very well.  I was worried about browning and puffing but it turned out just fine.  I'll definitely reuse this over and over.  Thanks for the recipe!

Simple and makes for a good side or an addition to a burrito.  Don't worry about the rice puffing up in the first step, it'll soak up plenty of liquid after the broth is added.  In fact don't be afraid to add some more water or broth during the simmer if you find it's all been absorbed and the rice is still a bit chewy.

The recipe as is is alright, I prefer something a little more flavorful.  So, I tweaked it. I added more chicken bouillion and that did the trick and I couldn't my fork down. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and cooked it in my rice cooker and it came out great!

GREAT MEXICAN RICE!!!!  I have tried so many horrible recipes and now I have finally tried the one I will stick with!  My only suggestion would be to add the garlic salt and cumin to the rice right before it is browned because otherwise it gets kinda burnt tasting.  Also one of my favorite local mexican restaurants adds corn, carrots and peas to theirs and I really like that so I will be throwing those into this recipe as well.  Thank you so much for the fabulous recipe!  Also this goes great with the South Texas Carne Guisada recipe posted on this site - super yummy!

Very good.  Restaurant quality.  I used medium grain rice, otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Update:  We ate out at a mexican restaraunt a few weeks ago, and then I made this rice again shortly after.  After comparing it to the rice at Don Pablo's, it was so much better that my husband said we needed to up the rating to a 5 star!  :)

I actually made this recipe to feed 200 people.  Four batches of 50 servings each cooked nicely in a 20 qt stock pot.  Many people wanted to know which area Mexican restaurant had made the rice:)

This is my new favorite Mexican rice recipe, with a few alterations. I only use 1.5 cups of broth, so that the total amount of liquid is 2 cups, and I cut the cumin down to 1/4 tsp. I've even cut the oil down to 2 Tbsp, and it still comes out well! As for cooking the rice in the oil: cook it until it's opaque, and slightly golden. Don't worry about whether it puffs up or not; I think that part of the recipe is misleading. Other than that, great recipe, and I make it about once a week! Thanks!

It didn't taste bad, but it didn't have much taste either.  Maybe if you up the spices it would give it a bit more kick.

I made this tonight for my father, mom, and husband.  They absolutely loved it!  The only change I made to it was I added half a can of green chiles because I knew my dad would like them. It was a very easy recipe to follow and the results were excellent.  I didn't really know what it meant to  have the rice ruff and turn golden.  But whatever I did still turned out great.

I have tried and tried to find a recipe for mexican rice that tastes like authentic mexican cooking - none have come close...until now.  This recipe was so simple, and I was a little apprehensive about that.  The only thing I tweeked was that I added maybe 1/2 can of rotel (tomatoes, green chilies, cilantro, lime) which definitely added a kick as well as some fresh minced garlic.  My 21 month old loved this recipe!  I have made this several times!

Great.  I forgot to add the salt but just sprinkled it on afterwards and stirred really well.  Turned out great.  Will keep for all my mexican nights.  (which are very often my husband loves mexican).  Never buy premade rice again.

This recipe was easy and understated.  It went well with the beans I had made.  I also subbed the tomatoe sauce with some medium picante sauce.  This spiced up the recipe just right.  This rice is a lot more convenient than the mexican rice III recipe for when you just want to get some good food on the table fast.

I had been looking for a recipe with this taste for a long time.  Very close to what I consider "restaraunt style".  I have substituted dehydrated minced onion and chicken base for the onion and chicken broth without much difference in the outcome.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is the best mexican rice!!! I did make a few modifications based on past reviews: I used 3 garlic cloves instead of garlic salt and added while browning the rice. I also used about 1 tsp of chile powder and added it and the cumin after the liquid. Instead of tomato sauce I used enchilada sauce, to give it a little kick. I only used 14oz of chicken broth instead of 16oz. It cooked for 25 minutes and was perfect, fluffy rice and great flavor. Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Good recipe- I added some chili powder and about half of a chopped green pepper.  Used fresh garlic (two cloves) instead of the garlic salt.  I did it with brown rice and it worked very well.  Just cooked for about 40 minutes instead.  Next time I would add just a bit (a tablespoon or two) of extra broth just because my rice could have used more liquid- probably because I used brown though.  This rice looked beautiful and tasted good too.

this recipe made me (a transplanted texan in russia) feel like I was home again!  i browned the onions first, then added the rice- stir fry till fragrant (it will lose its transparent look... i think the "puffy" phrase is misleading.)  i only used 2 cups of liquid (1:2 ratio is a must in rice cooking!!)  i used a combo of chicken broth and reconstituted sun-dried tomato water and tomato juice. with a 1/2tsp of chili powder- this was perfect!

This didn't work for me.  The rice was still crunchy so I added more broth and let it cook longer.  When it was finally ready it just didn't have much flavor.

This is without a doubt the BEST Mexican rice recipe ever. I made it as a side for fajitas and I just wanted to the eat the rice instead! I used a half of a cup salsa instead of tomato sauce for added flavor. After reading the reviews of people who said it was dry, undercooked, etc., maybe that has something to do with their cooking and not the recipe. It's pretty hard to mess this recipe up. Even better than restaurants. Thanks!

I always make this rice as a side for our Mexican dinners.  I add a 1/4 cup frozen corn, 1 can rinsed, black beans, and a handful of green onions in the last 5 min of cooking.  It adds some color as well as flavor!  Excellant!

Fabulous! The closest I've come to duplicating my favorite Mexican restaurant's rice at home. I use about 2 tbsp. of olive oil and 1 tsp. minced garlic instead of onion. Sometimes I also add just a few green chilis and diced tomatoes. This recipe is a keeper, I make it at least once a week and can eat it as a meal all by itself! Yum.

Very Good - full of flavor.  I only used about half the oil (olive instead of vegetable).  I also used garlic powder instad of garlic salt then added just a little salt.  And I added a little chili powder (1/2 t).  I will make this again.

Really quick and easy rice. Too salty, will decrease garlic salt next time, otherwise tasted great.

I made this for lunch today.  The texture was a bit mushy, but, the overall taste was good.  I added a can of black eyed peas sans the juice.

This was great! I had no problem with the browning and puffing! I added a can of chiles which added some good colour, but not enough spice for my taste... next time, jalapenos!

Easy, quick and good!  I did use about half the oil called for, however, as the first 
time I made this I found it a bit greasy for my taste.  I had no trouble getting the rice 
nice and toasty-- it actually doesn't puff much at all, though it does go opaque (turns 
very white) then gets a bit brownish... I used jasmine rice for this and when toasts up 
it smells divine!  It's also good leftover.  Try this, you won't be sorry!

I already had enchiladas baking when I realized I had forgtotten to make rice.  I found this recipe and made it based on the ease of preparation.  I was quite pleasantly surprised!  What a very good recipe for Mexican rice - and a very quick and easy recipe to boot.  I will make recipe regularly when preparing Mexican meals from now on.  Delicious!

My family enjoyed this recipe. It is quick to make and is not too spicy. I think next time I will make it with water rather than chicken broth. I served it with Beef Enchiladas which made for a nice quick dinner.

This is exactly the way the Mexican ladies that I worked with made their rice. It is not supposed to be “spicy”. They commented that  white people thought all Mexican food was spicy and had cheese on it. If your rice was still hard your heat was not high enough for your rice to cook. The rice is always first cooked in a little oil because it keeps the grains of rice from sticking together. Hope these comments help. This is really a fool proof recipe.

I loved this recipe! I took the advice of some of the reviews and cooked the onions along with some bell peppers before I cooked the rice. I also added taco seasoning with the other spices called for, and added a can of black beans at the end. I put this mixture in tortilla shells with the fix'ns and it was delicious.

So good!!  My husband said that it's the only mexican rice he wants from now on, and all three of my picky kiddos ate it.  That's definitely a 5 star for us ;).  Instead of the tomato sauce, we used our favorite salsa.  It substituted nicely, and is something we always have on hand.

I make this all the time and everyone loves it!  The only change I have made is that sometimes, if I have enchilada sauce left over from the enchiladas, I use it in place of the tomato sauce.  Either way, it is delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe for mexi rice! I did take other reviewers suggestions and used butter in place of the oil. I also carmelized finely diced onion before adding the rice. It also doubles beautifully!

Yummy!! I only eat the powdered versions of veggies because I'm picky, so I did 1tsp onion/garlic powder, dash of kosher salt, and dash of ginger-the ground cumin stayed the same. I used 2 boullion chicken flavor cubes with 2C water and 8oz (can says 1/4C) tomato sauce. I used Jasmine rice. I wish I didn't make it so early in the day. It's going to be difficult not to eat it before dinner!!

This rice is AWESOME! So yummy even cold! I made it exactly as the recipe says - but I did use a can of diced tomatoes with chilies to substitute for some of the tomato sauce. I adjusted to be for 12 servings - but it made so much- it seemed more like it could have served 20+.

This is good and very simple to make.  After making as written the first time, the only change I've made is fresh garlic and sea salt instead of the garlic salt.  
If I don't have tomato sauce I use any kind of tomato I have in the cupboard.  Try it with Rotel tomatoes and chilies, really very good.

Mexican Rice isn't meant to be the "Star" of the show.  It's quite simply an accompaniment to the other dishes on the plate and to that end, this is a perfect recipe.  Our stove went on the blink so we had to cook the onion in the microwave and then put everything in the rice cooker.  Came out perfectly.  I will use this recipe again.

This has the potential to be good. However I made it completely as the recipe says and it is way to salty. It also feels like it is missing something but I'm not sure what.

Excellent- Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Had leftovers and they were good too. Next time, I will add cilantro at the end while it is simmering! I wanted to make it exactly the way it was described first.

This is as close as I've gotten to the food bus in our neighborhood that served authentic Mexican food.  Had to tweak it a little since I didn't have all ingredients on hand (tomato paste, reconstituted and garlic salt ingredients).  Turned out really well. :)

very bland flavor. The base is there just needs more flavor, I would use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and more of other seasonings.

The only way I will make rice now.  Everyone in my family loves it.  The only change I make is adding a bit of homeade taco seasoning to it. It's easy to make and tastes great!

Followed exactly. Fyi: Rice Browns but does not puff.  Comes out perfect every single time. Have not had a bad batch yet and have been making for a year now following the recipe as written.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I wasn't leaning to a more "traditional" spanish rice sort of side dish and this hit the nail on the head! This would be great to put inside of a burrito!

This rice was the closest I've found to what you get in most restaurants.  We loved it as is - although as another reviewer suggested, I added the onion in with the rice to get them cooked down - yum!

I give this 5 stars because we enjoyed the taste and easy preparation.  The only thing was the electric range that I cook on didn't quite absorb the liquid completely after 25 min, so I had to adjust the time a little longer.  Other than that, I love this Mexican Rice recipe.  Thank you for posting it!

This is the closest recipe I've gotten to the Mexican rice I get in California. It needs something, but I can't place my finger on it... either way, better than a lot of these "Mexican" places I've had on the E. Coast.

LOVE this recipe!!! I like to substitute 1 tablespoon of minced garlic in lieu of the garlic salt (and add salt to taste). I also add more onion, chop in some cilantro and, depending on my mood, will add some corn and/or black beans. YUM!!!! :)

I like that this recipe keeps it uncomplicated.  I used butter rather than oil, and I used a red onion since that's what I had on hand.  If I use this recipe again I'll stick with the oil and use a yellow onion.  I'd also omit the cumin, and use minced garlic rather than garlic salt. I think that would keep it a bit lighter, like I prefer for rice.

Delicious, flavorful rice. I cooked onions, rice and garlic together, then added spices, tomato sauce and chicken broth and set heat at lowest setting for 25 minutes. I let it cool for 15 minutes before fluffing with a spoon. They came out perfect.

Very good recipe!  I will use it again.  Hubby thought it was great.  I used onion powder instead of onions.  I added about another ounce of tomato sauce to it after it was done cooking to make it a tad juicer.

I really liked this recipe and it was really easy to make, however I also thought it was a bit bland.  I tossed in some taco seasoning based on another review and that fixed it right up.  I think though, that some dishes would be better with a more subtle rice in which case I would say leave it as is.  Anyways, everyone ate it right up and I will be making it again!

Very good recipe.  I'm on my 2nd bowl while writing this review.  I used all the ingredients listed in the recipe, but made it my own with the following additions:  
I added a generous pinch of taco seasoning, a few threads of saffron, 1 sliced green onion, and a small handful of sun-dried tomatoes. I made a meal of it by adding 1 lb. of extra lean ground beef and a half cup or so of small red kidney beans.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow with a green side salad.  Very tasty!

Easy Mexican restaurant style rice.  Made it twice: once as directed, once I used black bean and corn salsa in place of tomato sauce.  Easy to scale up.

I just made this rice today and it turned out great!  The recipe is pretty spot on.  The only things I did different were I added the onion to the skillet first and sautéed just until they were opaque, then added the rice.  Rice will not "puff up" without liquid so you can only sauté it till it's golden.  I added a little more tomato sauce since I just added the whole can (it was a small can), so it was probably about 3/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup that the recipe calls for and I added a whole tsp. of Cumin.  I cooked it for 25min with the lid on and the removed it from the heat and took the lid off - but did not touch it yet.  You have to let rice stand for a little bit so the moisture can escape - about 10min.  Then I fluffed it with a fork and then let it sit a little longer so it could completely dry, that way you don't have wet sticky rice.  The rice went great with my beans and enchiladas :)

Delicioso! This will be my new "go to" side dish for our weekly Mexican night. We used to love the taco rice made my Knorrs but its no longer sold where I grocery shop, so this is great! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Wonderful restaurant-style spanish rice! We didn't have garlic salt, so we substituted 1/8 tsp garlic powder & a sprinkle of salt (we had doubled the recipe).

This is a great recipe.  We are NPC bodybuilder/bikini competitors and rice (brown and white) are staples in our diet.  I was looking for a yummy off-season rice that would go great with our chicken, steak, and veggies. (found it works well with fish too).  Saute the chopped onions, with the prechopped garlic for a few mins then add the rice.  I sprinkle the rice with taco seasoning while I'm sauteing it along with the onions and garlic.  Add chicken broth, SALSA, bring to a boil and cover it.  The first time I made it I had to keep adding salsa &/or broth because it cooked down very quickly even on low.  Really good.  We add chipotle shake spice and cayenne to taste.  Made with the pollo fajitas recipe from this site.

We found the recipe as written is just ok.  It was a little too bland for our taste and overall just tasted like ketchup. However, once we changed the ketchup to chili sauce and reduced the amount from 1/2 to 1/4 cup and added a few dashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce, it became a great mexican rice recipe.  We now make it, with those changes, at least once a month!

I didn't have garlic salt on hand so I googled and found a recipe for making your own garlic salt with 3 parts salt and 1 part garlic powder. So I did just that-- 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. In short, I think that was too much salt as the rice came out slightly salty. Had I used off the shelf garlic salt, the rice would have come out perfect. 
So if you don't have garlic salt handy, I suggest you use a little less than 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder.

This is my go-to recipe for Mexican Rice.  Sometimes I use salsa in place of the tomato sauce if I'm out.  Today I made the Simple Carnitas and used the leftover pork broth in place of the chicken broth and it was excellent too!

A friend of mine's mom (who was born in raised in Mexico) makes the best mexican food you'll ever have.  This recipe is how she makes her mexican rice.  I've read some of the reviews and yes, this is a side dish not a main dish but is great even eaten by itself!

My husband and I like spicy food, so I made just a couple of changes. I used Mexican hot tomato sauce instead of regular tomato sauce. This has chiles and garlic in it. I also decreased the cumin slightly, since it can be an overpowering flavor. Otherwise, I left everything else the same. Everyone loved the rice. It was very tasty with a kick of spice. This recipe is a keeper!

I really liked this recipe, it had minimal ingredients and was very simple to make. This tasted just like the kind of rice you get at your local Mexican eatery.
I will make this quite a bit I am sure.

I was so surprised to see this recipe. this is exactly as my mom would make it. When I was a kid  mom used cloves of garlic, seed cumin, peppercorn. she would use a Molcajete to  grind all the spices. add fresh tomatoes and stired the broth in an added it to the rice.  i do not know if this makes sense but it was the best..  thanks for putting in the easier version. now my granddaughters can try it.

This was pretty good! It wasn't exactly like the restaurant kind; it might need a bit more spices and flavors. But it's a fantastic base recipe and I will definitely use it again!

I've made this several times and will continue.  I had long searched for a good Mexican rice recipe, and I think this one has just the right seasonings, while being super simple and requiring ingredients I always have on-hand.  I've made it for company and they always ask me to share how I make my rice!

Love this rice. I make this all the time. I turn into a meal though. While the rice cooks, I tend to fry up some ground beef, pork or chicken with taco seasonings or whatever seasonings I have around. I also make my own beans at home so I'll throw some pinto beans or black beans into a sauce pan to heat. When the rice is done, I'll throw the drained , cooked ground meat and the cooked, drained beans and corn into the rice and mix it all up. We eat it with tortilla chips or homemade tortillas.

Easy, excellent and exactly like the mexican restaurants!  This one is a keeper!  I have tried many different recipes that sound easy enough and flavorful enough and none have come close to this.  Personally, I love the rice I get at the restaurant, and this one is identical!  Thank you for sharing!

I have been searching for a great mexican rice and I have found it! The best by far! I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and also add green and red pepper flakes and a little cayenne powder. Great!

Easy and delightful. Uses ingredients on hand. I've wrecked so many attempts at Mexican rice that I was amazed when this turned out tender, fluffy, savory, flavorful, but not spicy. Did make some substitutions -- butter instead of oil to give more savory flavor; 1 full tsp taco seasoning instead of cumin which I didn't have (but cumin was 1st ingredient in the taco seasoning packet from Trader Joe)....otherwise followed recipe to the letter. BTW, I didn't think the rice "puffed" as stated in the recipe, but it did turn a deep golden -- which gave it a LOT of flavor.

Very good.  I modified by adding two cloves of garlic, additional cumin, some paprika and chili powder.  I also doubled the onion.  I prepared according to the instructions.  Texture was fluffy and perfect.  Next time I will probably added some diced tomatoes or maybe Rotel for additional tomato flavor, but as I prepared it tonight it was great.

Great Basic recipe.  I used 2 cups instant rice, 3 cups of warm water with 3 teaspoons herbox chicken flavoring instead of broth (more flavor) and 1 10 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juice, also used 1/2 a pack of taco seasoning and fried the rice with green pepper and onion.  Cooked in about 10 minutes.    Thanks

Perfect! Followed the advice to use Taco Seasoning 1.  I use that recipe often and to add it to the rice itself is awesome! Thanks for the tip.

My very picky family loved this! I browned the rice with chopped onion and garlic then put it in a rice cooker with the liquids.  I also added a little fresh cilantro.  It worked great in the rice cooker.

The ingredients for this recipe are bacially ok, but I just use a dask of cumin, cumin is a spice that can be over powering. I use a teaspoon of dried oregao, no garlic salt, and regular ground garlic powder, I also use finely chopped onion, dried parsley, and instead of so much tomato sauce, I like to take diced tomatoes that you put through a blender, or use a molcaquete(stone motar), if you have one. and the juice..it makes for a much better taste, than if you use so much tomato sauce. then when it begins to simmer, drop in a very fine chopped piece of carrot and a few frozen peas for a final touch..This is Spanish rice as it is made by mexican cooks.

I hadn't made Mexican rice before (always grabbed a box at the store), so I was a little nervous putting the bowl down in front of the family.  Both hubby and kid liked it way better than the pre-seasoned rice I had been buying!  Only change I made was replacing the tomato sauce with enchilada sauce, since I was had a can open anyway.

So, I was born in southern california and lived a good portion of my childhood in Tucson, AZ...right next to the mexican border.  It basically goes without saying that I absolutely LOVE authentic mexican food!!  When I even see a Taco Bell commercial I instantly feel slight anger and a twinge of indigestion within.  ANYHOW, all of that to say that I made this recipe for the first time tonight and loved, loved, loved it!  I have made mexican rice many times before, but never using this method. I'm very pleased with the ease and taste of it!  Even my husband, who doesn't care for rice, raved about it!  :)

My only deviations were that I used 3/4 t sea salt and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt AND because we are vegetarian I used "Not Chick'n Broth" to make 2 cups as the recipe calls for.  It was delicious with my family recipe enchiladas!

I really love this rice.  It goes great with tacos.  I made it the other night for a taco dinner with our extended family coming over and I got several comments on how good it was and people asking for the recipe.

There are many different styles of Mexican rice. This one is similar to one that a Mexican relative of mine makes. I like it because isn't dry. The tomato flavor really comes through, but it isn't overpowering.

Yup, that's the stuff! I sautéed the onions for a minute then added the rice and sautéed for another five minutes. I used cumin, added 1tsp of taco seasoning, and left out the garlic salt (I feared it'd be too salty). I worried there's be too much liquid with the 1/2C sauce, but it turned out perfectly.

This was delicious. I made a vegan version using veggie broth. I used half ground cumin, half cumin seed.

I loved this recipe! I threw in a chopped green pepper and some leftover canned green chiles because I wanted to use them up. I also substituted brown rice for white & vegetable broth for chicken (since we're vegetarians). Spectacular, I could eat this dish at every meal!

Finally I found a rice recipe that tastes like real mexican rice! Tastes great and I'm just so glad my search has ended for the perfect rice.  Ground cumin is key in this recipe!

It makes a big difference in the brand of rice. I know.  I use Mathatma long grain rice, sometimes I place a whole jalapeño when adding liquid. Sometimes I use Pace Picante salsa. Use your imagination.

Very good. Very easy. I added a little more in the way of seasoning. I also prefer tomato paste to sauce (I only used 2-3 tablespoons). Finally, I diced a yellow and a red bell pepper as well as an onion. I also made it with brown rice (because that's what I keep on hand.) I thought it was delicious. So did he!!

This is the first time I have ever made anything like this.  I have, however, eaten rice like this before.  All I can say is fantastic.  It was as close or better than anything I have ever ordered in a restaurant before.

Awesome.  I use Taco Seasoning instead of just cumin and I use Olive oil instead of vegetable.  I also use rotel or similar instead of tomato sauce.  But this is a good base recipe, I feel.

Just what I wanted! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used 1/4 cup pizza sauce and it was perfect! I also added 1/2 tsp chili powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper. YUM!

This was fantastic - with my modifications. I added about a half tsp. of fresh garlic, a quarter tsp. each of cayenne pepper and chili powder and 1 tsp. of paprika. I also added about 1 tbsp. of fresh parsley, half a sliced yellow pepper and half a sliced green pepper. As the rice came to boil I added about a half can of diced tomatoes (minus the juice). I served it with homemade enchiladas, sour cream, refried beans and mashed avocado and it was divine!!!

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I found it a couple of years ago and it's a staple when we have Mexican food for dinner. I agree with those who say don't worry about the puffing. I have never been able to make that happen. I don't add anything to it--we love it as is!

Excellent.  I did not change a thing, it is just like the Mexican rice in the restaurant, which I love.  Had with carne asada and refried beans, Yum. Thank you for sharing, this is a real keeper.

LOVE this recipe!! I added a tiny bit of bacon bits for some added flavor (just a personal preference, it didn't need it) but otherwise I followed the instructions exactly. It was better than a lot of restaurants' rice I've hadd.

I thought this was awesome!  I used long whole grain rice.  It puffed beautifully and was so light and fluffy.  Next time I'm going to try another user's suggestion and use taco seasoning mix instead of cumin, because my husband thought there was something missing.  Other than that it was great.

SO, SO, SO DELICIOUS. I make this all the time because my husband asks for it all the time! He's hispanic too! And yes, a strong chicken broth is a MUST. I actually added barely a teaspoon of chicken flavoring and a squeeze of lime juice. PERFECTION.

Great recipe! 
Changed it up a lil bit. Rather than reg tomato sauce i used El Pato sauce to give it spice. Cut out the chicken broth used water and a seasoning to taste. Came out deliscious.

I have been looking for YEARS to find a Mexican rice that tastes like those at the best Mexican restaurants.  This recipe has the same elusive taste I have been searching for.  Excellent!

11-5-11:  This is close to a 'five'; the sauteed rice has a really good texture while the taste would be open to improvement with additional spices.

Great, basic recipe for mexican rice.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly, but I never do any mexican cooking without a generous amount of both cumin and chili powder.  With a bit more spice, this dish is something everyone at my table gobbles up.

I needed to add way more seasonings to make this taste like anything. If you like bland food, it's fine. But not a show-stopper.

Great recipe!  The family all ate it and most asked for seconds...and I have some picky toddlers!
I even had to make a substitution because I didn't have tomato sauce...used ketchup instead and it was still yummy.  Obviously think it will be even better with tomato sauce.  Love the simple ingredients and consistency of this rice.

Excellent!  I didn't change a thing!  I did use an authentic Mexican tomato sauce (from Walmart, small carton for like 40 cents).   Being married to a Mexican, I'm always trying to make him things along this line that he'll love, but until now my rice has always been 'meh'.  Thank you for giving me the rice recipe I've been searching for!  Now to figure out what I'm doing wrong with my refried beans! ;)

Had much more flavor after I added extra seasonings (chili powder, cumin, ground oregano, garlic powder, pepper), one jalapeno, and half a chopped green bell pepper. I also liked brown rice better (healthier and better texture).

This is really good mexican rice and very easy. I used basmati rice (because it was what I had), some fresh garlic and a little less oil and it turned out great. I will make it again.

Absolutely wonderful! I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (we're vegetarian), and it works great. Also, I use 2 tablespoons of oil instead of one. Thank you for a great recipe!

LOVE this recipe! Super easy and very authentic. Most people will have the ingredients in their pantry already too- add fresh squeezed lemon juice, gives it a nice perky flavor- My husband loves it too.

YUM!  I've been looking for a good Mexican Rice recipe that would taste like the kind you get in a Mexican Restaurant and this is pretty close!  It is slightly dry (in a good way) and lightly flavored so as not to overpower whatever dish it is being served with.  
I followed the recipe exactly except for using medium grain rice cuz that is what I had in my pantry and it turned out fine.  I will definitely make this my go to recipe for Mexican night in my house!

This is my go-to mexican rice recipie using a few alterations after reading the reviews! 

I sautee about 2 cloves garlice with 1/4 chopped red onion, 1tbs olive oil and the cumin for a few minutes. Meanwhile, I add 1.5 cups chicken broth, 1 cup brown rice and a can of rotel to my rice cooker. Then I add the onion/garlic/cumin to the rice cooker and let it do it's thing! My husband loves this :)

This is the second time i've made this recipe and I absolutely love it.  I use it as my base in a Chicken Cheese and Rice recipe i'm copying from my favorite restaurant.  After reading the reviews I added the onions first and I use half a large onion as opposed to just 1/4 cup.  I also use Swanson's Organic Chicken Broth, and add like a 1/2 a cup plus one heaping tablespoon of hunts tomato sauce.  And it comes out perfect very moist and delicious.  For those who are concerned there rice isn't browning or puffing.  It won't be significant in a long grain rice.  Unlike an arborio rice.  It will just look slightly plump and will have a pink opaque color.  You just don't want to burn the rice :)  And On my stove on simmer 23 minutes is perfect :)  Ok, lol now that i've given you all this silly information I hope you love this recipe like I have :)  Also if you are looking for a good store bought white queso instead of making it yourself Gordo's White Queso is perfect and theres a dollar off coupon on their website.

This is a very good basic recipe in which you can modify to your preferences if you so choose. Like other reviews I took some good tips: saute onions prior to adding rice, and add fresh garlic tword the end of the rice browning process. I also increased the liquid, but only because I live at a high altitude. It came out very nice! maybe next time I will add ore onions and garlic :)

I make this recipe at least twice a month and crave it more than that!  The only change I have made is that I add more tomato sauce..more like a cup because I like the extra tomato flavor.  I higly recommend this recipe!

This is a really easy dish to make.  I only made a couple changes.  I left out the onions and added stewed sliced tomatoes and instead of garlic and cumin, I used "hot and Spicy" taco seasoning.  I came out wonderfully and I will be using this for now on when I make enchiladas!

I have been trying to make Mexican rice for years and finally this recipe was the one! The rice does not fluff in the browning in oil process, but not to worry - it does fluff in the steaming process. Also, I would recommend adding the garlic and cumin after the onions because they tend to brown too quickly. Otherwise, a perfect recipe for Mexican rice!

So good and easy!  I've never sautéed rice prior to cooking before, and I'm glad I tried this.  I thought I had tomato sauce before I started cooking but had to substitute at the last minute.  I tried a salsa/ketchup blend as it's all I had--it's still really good.  The ketchup makes it a bit sweet.  I also added some chili flakes with the cumin and garlic salt and the flavour is wonderful.  Over all this is a fantastic recipe and method for cooking rice.

Very good! Tastes just like the restaurant rice, thank you for posting!! I did make a few adjustments in the hopes of making it slightly healthier. I did not cook the rice in oil- I just put the uncooked rice in the tomato sauce, chicken broth, minced garlic, chopped onion, and spices together. The rice soaked up the liquids very nicely. Once the rice was pretty much done, I added chopped green bell pepper, and let it sit in the steaming rice to cook a bit. Fantastic!

Do you know how annoying it is to find a recipe that is not only better than one your created, but also quicker and easier???? Seriously, this one rocks.  Made exactly as directed with the exception of sauting the onion with some diced bell pepper.  Then proceeded with rice, etc.  Fantastis.

I love spanish rice and this one is a good basic mexican rice recipe. I used the rice cooker to make the rice after I browned the garlic,added a dash of cumin, diced white onions and stirred with rice and salt in a small pot. Then I put it all in one rice cooker, added chicken broth, tomato sauce, a little salt and one stem of cilantro for flavoring and let it cook.

The best mexican rice I have made. Since I'm a vegetarian, I did use "no chicken broth" and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe. I plan on making it tomorrow with some refried beans, yum!

This was really good rice. The only thing I changed was for the tomato sauce I added half tomato sauce and half Mexican tomato sauce. The Mexican tomato sauce gave it a little bit of spice, but not too much. My husband said it was the best Mexican rice he has ever had.

This was good...but not great.  Even after substituting salsa for the tomato sauce and adding chili powder....it was still lacking something.  Maybe next time I'll try using taco seasoning as others have suggested.

This tasted pretty good, however, I will use less vegetable oil next time as I thought it was just too much.  Maybe 2 tablespoons or even less.  I also used tomato sauce with no salt because I was worried it was going to be too salty.  And it was just perfect.  I will be making this again.

So I always mess up rice and pasta -- even packaged stuff.  This came out prepared exactly per the recipe as light, fluffy.  Yay!
Flavor not withstanding, I will make again -- I like rice with more flavor myself so will adjust accordingly!

I would've given this a 5 star review if it weren't for the directions.  I made this two times, once following the directions to the tee, and the other doing it my way.  I found the rice to be extremely sticky and absorbed too much water when I did it according to directions.  The second time I did it, I just threw everything in at the beginning and cooked the rice like I regularly do, which is to allow the water to boil, add the rice, and simmer until the water is absorbed.  Cover, and cook until done.  The rice tasted wonderful though.  I will make this again!

Excellent rice. Just the right flavor and you can kick it up any way you see fit. I had a student's mother make me some rice and it was delicious but I have to say that this rice is 10x's better then hers!!!

This was good, but a little bland for my liking. I used fresh garlic, some green pepper and a dach of tabasco. I wasn't sure about cooking the rice before adding the liquid, but it turned out well.

So good!  Reminds me of the rice I get at really good Mexican restaurants.  I've made this a few times now and haven't felt the need to modify it at all.  I will say that I didn't have chicken broth on hand once and used beef broth instead and it just wasn't the same (definitely not as good). It's quick and easy and I will continue to make it on enchilada night!

This was great, I omitted the garlic salt and added garlic powder. I also sauted a whole jalapeno with the rice and kept it in the entire time (it doesn't make it spicy, just a little flavor). I also added a little extra tomato sauce.

I added taco seasoning and used water (because I was out of broth).  It could have used more flavor but was a wonderful lightly flavored rice.  Would be better with stock and 1 tsp of taco seasoning or more.  I didn't measure, just sprinkled.

I changed the recipe a bit.  I made 1 1/2 cups of rice and then increased all the rest of the ingredients by half.  I also added a cup of leftover chicken and about a cup of frozen peas.  Next time I wouldn't add the garlic salt into the rice until I added the liquid and I would use just the 1 tsp and not increase it.  It was really great and will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe

This was good, but I also had trouble getting the rice to puff.  Be careful not to burn it.

I made a few changes to add a little flavor &  because I'm picky.    I changed the following:    Added fresh chopped garlic to the oil before adding the rice.   Subbed 1 can of Rotel for the tomato sauce. I might try the spicy Rotel next time for an extra kick. (I used the immersion blender.I don't like chunks.)  Instead of chicken I used veggie broth.   I also used just 1 cup of broth since I used the whole can of Rotel. 10 oz can   I seasoned the rice before adding the liquids with; taco seasoning, chili con carne seasoning, pepper & cumin. I left out the garlic salt since I added fresh garlic.

I have been trying to find a good mexican rice recipe for a veryyyy long time. Most recipes I tried came out mushy, but I gave this recipe a try and it turned out PERFECT! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was nice and fluffy, just like you would get at a good mexican food restaurant. I'm happy that I finally found my go to recipe!

Constant staple of every Mexican night at our house. Wife uses brown rice just has to cook it longer to make the rice tender. Best out of all the ones we have tried. Thanks!

I cannot cook rice to save my life. I didn't expect this trail to be much different and I was not let down. When the 25 min was up my rice was soggy and there was too much water left. I had to crank up the temp to evaporate the rest of the water. The rice was OK at best. Edible? Yes. Would I make it again? maybe, maybe not.
Ok, so I tried it again. This time I turned up the heat while it was simmering and it came out perfect. I think I have made this 3 times now. Just took a little tweaking On my part.

I was happy with this recipe. I made the mistake of making Spanish rice and expecting Mexican Rice so i was happy to find a recipe. I threw a half of cup of frozen corn, but i should have thawed it a bit first. Next time ill brown the rice a bit more but it was still good!

This rice is just as good as our favorite Mexican restaurant!  If you live at a higher altitude, remember that you will have to cook longer.  We are at 7,000 foot, so the rice had to simmer for 50 minutes.  Excellent recipe!

This is by far the best mexican rice I have ever had even better than at any restaurant I've ever been to. I followed the instructions but I also took the advice of some of the reviews and added some home tac seasoning(which on took 2 minutes to make) and I also added a pack of sazon. I also always make my own chicken broth out of hot water and chicken base(not cubes) whenever a recipe calls for broth. I add about one teaspoon of base per cup of hot water. I find already prepared broth is very flavorless. Next time I make this rice I will also add gondules bean(pigeon peas) they are wonderful in rice.

I'm mexican/puerto rican and this is just how my mom and dad make it, minus the chicken broth and ground cumin. Usually my parents just use water and fresh cloves of garlic, onion and tomato sauce.   I found this recipe to be a bit too salty though for my taste. Way more salty than what Ive come across in Mexican restaurants as well.   I like the addition of broth, it definitely adds more flavor. I wouldn't change anything in this recipe except maybe using fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and salting to taste if needed.    Thanks!

Good mexican base rice.  If you have other mexican strong dishes, like enchiladas or mole, then this is a good side dish.  I really preffer to add chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, bc the sauce becomes too overpowering and I fry some achiote seed in oil to give the red/orange color (I remove the achiote seeds after the color has been released).  I add this oil as needed.

This rice is better than restaurants!! I took the advice from another review and instead of adding the seasoning, I used 1 1/2 tsp of taco seasoning. Everything else I followed as listed. Everyone in my family loved it!!

This recipe is fantastic!  It is just like the rice you get in most mexican restaurants.  It's not super strong in flavor, but mexican rice isn't supposed to be, judging from what I've had in 100's of restaurants.  I make it as is and it turns out great everytime!

We found this rice just ok.  I felt like it needed a little more spice and a little less salt.  We will give it a second chance but next time I will use fresh garlic rather than garlic salt and I will increase the cumin a little.  It's a pretty good base recipe to start from though.

This is just like typical mexican restaurant rice. I've been searching for a recipe like it for years! Thank you!! It's definitely not a main dish or show stopper, but a great side to some spicy chili rellenoes or enciladas.

I used crushed tomatoes as I was out of tomato sauce but I don't think that made a difference in taste other than a few chunks of tomato.   After it was cooked, I put it in a small casserole, topped it with shredded cheddar and put it in the oven until the cheese was melted.   I don't eat it but my husband said it tasted really good, just like the rice at the local Mexican restaurant.  I would definitely make it again.  Edit:  I just made it again and use Rotel diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and it was even better!

I will admit that I messed up my batch by adding chicken bouillion to water instead of using fresh chicken broth.  But i also modified the recipe to include only 1.5 c of water, which was perfect amount of liquid with the tomato sauce.  Besides over salting, I think this produced a texture that was a little mushier than I'm used to in rice.  Perhaps this is just how Mexican rice is supposed to be.  In the future, I will be trying 1.25 c of water in addition to the tomato sauce instead.  All aside, this is almost exactly like a deconstructed rice-a-roni mix.  Excellent recipe with modifications.

I made this with some additions and it will now be my go-to Mexican Meal side-dish.  I added corn, cilantro and some grated Colby cheese, which gave it just the right kick for our family.

Perfect, tastes just like the rice at my favorite Mexican restaurant! I added half of a diced jalapeno in with the onions for some extra color and kick.

Just made this rice.  It was good, not great but good.  Only modifications I made was that I added bell pepper and minced garlic when I added the onion.  And I also unsed chicken stock from the chicken I boiled for chicken tacos, instead of canned chicken broth.  Other than that I followed it exactly.  And I have no complaints.  I will make it again unless I find a better recipe.

This is just like the rice in my local authentic Mexican restaurant.  I did change a couple little items in the recipe.  I added abundant ground pepper with the other spices, and approximately double the amount of onions.  Also, instead of finishing this on the stove, I let it come to a boil then covered it and stuck it in the oven for 1/2 hour at 350*.  It comes out perfect this way, and no need to worry about it scorching on the stove.  I served with canned refried black beans simmered down with some chicken stock (I had extra) and blue corn chips.  Sabroso!!!

This really was delicious very reminiscent of what the Mexican women of my church used to make. I think I may try using a lot of sauteed fresh garlic (that is what I remember them using more than onion). Definitely a keeper and will make again!

My family eats alot of rice; this was certainly one of the best rice recipes I have come across.  The rice had amazing flavour and the texture was great; not sticky or starchy.  I added a bit of fresh cilantro at the end.  Definelty one of our favourites now.

An excellent start for those of us who had no idea how to make mexican rice. Only difference I did was use enchilada seasoning as I didn't have any cumin. It was yummy and would make a good side dish to something more robust or as insides to burritos.

Simple and yummy. I used brown rice because I had it on hand, and fresh garlic rather than the salt. I served it with hot sauce, grated cheese, and sour cream to go along with fish tacos. Will make again!

I boiled a whole tomato w/ 1/4 cup water, and blended it w/ enchalada sauce I had left over, to make 1 cup. than reduced the chkn stock down to 1 cup. I also used Minute Rice instead of Long grain, I was really pressed for time and it was kinda an afterthought to make rice. It turned out great!

I just made this tonight, and man is it good! Thanks so much no more boxed rice for me! I did add some coriander, a pinch of mexican oregano, and a couple cloves of garlic.  Delicious!  Oh, and I didn't have chicken stock but I was boiling some chicken breasts for enchiladas in water with a bit of chicken bouillon.  I used that broth instead and it worked perfectly.

Wonderful! I have never made mexican rice and was afraid it would not come out right, but to my surprise it tasted just like rice from a mexican restaurant. I left out onion because I didn't have any on hand and it still was delicious! Very easy & quick! Thank you

Just what I wanted! I tripled the recipe, prepared it in a large stock pot. The suggestion for using aluminum foil as an extra cover under the lid worked great. I used tomato sauce from the Mexican section at the grocer which had a wonderul spicy "kick". I also added about a 1/2 cup of very finely chopped green pepper and 3 cloves minced garlic to my tripled recipe. I sauteed the onion in oil for a min. before adding the rice, garlic, & green pepper. I sauteed all these together while browning the rice. SO GOOD!

I loved it, family loved it! It was even better the next day when reheat in the skillet with some butter & it made it a little crunchy and flavors came out even more! I ended up adding a whole cup tomato sauce didn't want to waste the other half from the 8 oz can I had. Tasted great!

This rice was good, but to me, it needed more flavor.  I am going to have to experiment with it to get it right.  First of all, putting this in a rice cooker was a disaster.  The bottom layer burned.  When I did it again stovetop, it turned out just fine.  I just had to watch carefully for all the water to be absorbed, because it didn't take the full amount of time, and I would have had more burned rice.  It was wonderful with Burrito Pie from this site for Cinco De Mayo, but I won't make it again as is.  For me, it just needs some more flavor.

This was exactly the kind of rice I was looking for to serve with Chile Verde in tortillas with black beans.  It's not too flavorful on its own, but with another spicy Mexican dish it can be perfect.  I did make a few slight modifications: I used a clove of garlic (minced) instead of garlic salt; I only used 2 Tablespoons tomato sauce, I added a dash of oregano and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to cook the rice in.  I wouldn't change a thing next time I make it.  But again, this isn't the type of rice you make when you want it to stand alone as a real spicy side dish.  If that's what you're looking for, then I would suggest adding some of the taco seasoning to it like another person suggested.

Ummmmmmm delicious!!!!!! I did add a few more spices after I made it exactly like the recipe says. I just like a little more flavor and spice. A little more cumin, some chili and cayenne pepper to taste.

I made this recipe as specified except I sauteed the onions before adding the rice. I added homemade taco seasoning as another user suggested. It came out alright, it was good as a side dish, but couldn't stand on its own. Perhaps I'd make it again.

I thought this was delicious.  I took the advice of "Chefglo" (4-26-2010) and used a mixture of onion and red bell peppers in place of all onion.  I also used fresh garlic and added salt to taste.  So basically I followed the recipe.  The only thing I did that was really different from the original recipe was to add a few hot pepper flakes.  Thanks to Mommyto2 for a fantastic Mexican Rice!

good side dish, i made this with some cajun fish it was good.  I used salsa instead of tomato sauce since I didnt have any and it turned out okay. I used extra chopped garlic since I like things extra savory! I think it would have been nice with some extra chopped red peppers. I served with green onions on the top with cheese. will make again! very quick side dish!

This was a very good mexican rice, but I grew up in a town with wonderful mexican food and the best mexican rice so I'm tough.  This is the best recipe I've found so far and will make again until I find a 5 star rice.

I love this recipe, it is almost the exact one my Nana used to make when I was kid. I do like to add a cube of chicken bouillon to this dish even though it already uses chicken broth for a more intense flavor.

This mexican rice recipe was great and much more flavorful than I expected.  I added a bit of chili powder, but followed the recipe as is and it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make this again!

This was ok. The rice puffed up and browned beautifully. The flavor was didn't quite "pop" for me. Very easy recipe for people knew to rice not from a box, though.

Great! Very simple. I used taco seasoning instead of cumin and garlic salt. My rice just got brown before I added the chicken broth and tomato sauce but it still came out fine.

This was the recipe I've been searching for. The rice was just like you get in a restaurant. I had to do one thing different then as called. I did not have cumin and read in my betty crocker cook book you can substitute it with chili powder. I would never recamend doing this.

You cannot mess this recipe up.  So easy and good!  I didn’t measure a thing (except the rice).  I put 1 whole chopped onion and 3 minced garlic cloves in a skillet with about 2 tbsp of butter on medium.  Then I added the rice and cumin about 5 minutes later. After that browned up, I added a small can of tomato sauce, which is actually double what the recipe calls for (I didn’t do this on purpose. I had one too many beers, I guess).  Then I added just 1 can of chicken broth (which I knew was going to be a bit too little).  When all the chicken broth was evaporated, I added about a ¼ cup of water (cuz you know I wasn’t gonna open another can of broth for only 2 ounces!!)  And, after everything…the rice was delicious!  I liked having the extra onion in there and doubling the tomato sauce turned out fine!!!  I’ll use this again for sure since it’s so easy and fool/drunk-proof.

I came across this recipe and was very pleased with the results.  It is an easy recipe to follow and requires only ingredients that I normally have at the house anyway.  I cook as directed but use water and chicken bullion instead of the chicken broth.  Also, I find that the rice is a bit soggy when it is first done cooking, but if you puff with a fork as directed and let it set for a few minutes after, it will thicken up and taste delicious.  I use it to accompany all of my Mexican dishes including tacos, enchiladas, etc.

Pretty tasty!   My rice was too soft for my taste after the recommended time.  Next time, I'll try cooking it for a little less time.

I wasn't looking for a show-stealer: just something to go along with chicken fajitas - and it did the job wonderfully! I used basmati rice and chicken consomme instead of broth. I find cumin an odd spice for a "Mexican" dish and the flavor did seem a little out of place. The use of taco seasoning, as mentioned by others, would be a more appropriate fit and I'll try that next time. Oh, and my rice didn't fluff in the first stage of cooking - it just browned and still came out great.

This is pretty good.  Not the best I've ever had, but by far the best I've ever made at home!  I made no changes to the directions, and it really doesn't need any.

I've never had mexican rice before so I was not sure what I was expecting. My children didn't like it- and my husband didnt like it- and I know what it was, it was the CUMIN! they just dont like the taste of it- its ok becuase I did like it. This was pretty easy to make but I'm not sure if I'l make this again.

Only rice I had was medium grain but it worked very well. I liked this rice better than the rice I get at mexican restaurants. It was definitely more flavorful without taking away from the rest of the dish.

Just what I have been looking for in a mexican rice recipe. I took another user's advice and added 2T taco seasoning for more flavor. Definitely tasty. A little salty, but I think that's because I added salt before tasting!

This recipe was a great side dish for our dinner. It my husband who has no problem letting me know when he doen't like something even enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe to the tee and the rice came out great.  Like other reviewers mentioned the rice may not puff up but that is okay because the rice will still come out great.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used salsa and then mixed in some fresh tomato.  Knock your socks off good.  And super easy to make.

AWESOME!! This is going to be served in my house all the time now! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the chopped onion. I forgot I used up my onion so I subbed 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder! I ws HIGHLY impressed with how good this way. It tastes like authenic mexican restaurants I've been to. My hubs couldn't quit telling me how it was the best mexican rice he had ever had! SCORE for me! This was much cheaper and better than the box or package mexican/spanish rice from the grocery store!

LOVED this! I added frozen vegetables into the saucepan first and made sure they cooked a little before adding the rice, which added some great color and additional flavors. I also added a little Adobo seasoning to the garlic salt and cumin. Also, when I put in tomato sauce, I put in some salsa. You could definitely taste the difference the salsa made and it was DELICIOUS. I'm never buying preseasoned mexican rice again!

this was a good basic recipe. it tasted pretty much the same as you can find in mexican restaurants around here. and my husband was happy as he said "it actually tastes like mexican rice" and was pretty impressed. i thought it was a little too wet still. but thats okay. iwould just reduce the broth a tiny bit next time.

This is good rice, but it's missing something.  I'm from Texas, and down here, no Mexican dish is complete without cilantro!  This is a very important ingredient.  It adds a much needed kick to everything.  You don't need a bunch of it, just about 1/4 cup will be plenty.  If you're not familiar with it, just use a little until you get your taste figured out.  Just add it in when you add in the liquids.  It's great.

Great recipe!  Perfect mild side dish to accompany my main dish of spicy chicken enchiladas.  I do not use garlic salt so used 3/4 tsp garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp salt and only used 2 TBS oil.  This rice was as good (and even better) as some of the rice at my local Mexican restaurants!

I'm originally from Texas and I've eaten a lot of Mexican rice over the years. I made this last Sunday along with some very tasty chicken enchiladas.  It turned out great!  Some of the best Mexican rice I've ever had.

Good rice, served accompanied by Angela's Awesome Enchiladas (which were very good). We eliminated cumin, substituted with fajita seasoning. Previous posters were correct, the rice didn't puff until after adding water and cooking it all off. Recommended.

I think you need to use minute rice...? My rice was still quite hard after even 40 minutes. Additionally, we did not care for the flavor. It tasted very plain- basically crunchy rice in tomato sauce. Sorry, but I advise that you keep searching!

I've never made Mexican rice before but I have to say this came out perfectly, and although it does have good flavor I think it was missing something, just not sure what.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could but since I can't I'm rating up and giving it 5 because of the ease of the recipe, that it came out great, and will just add some additional spices next time around.  Great recipe!

I really wanted this to be PERFECT.  And it wasn't bad....it was just ok.  Maybe some taco seasoning instead of just cumin?  The consistency wasn't quite there either, and I made it exactly as written (except for the use of veggie broth instead of chicken, I don't eat meat.)  Like I said, not bad, but I think I'll keep looking.

I added a little bit of the Taco Seasoning from this site and about a Tbs. of Lime Juice to this to really punch it up. Amazing!

Perfect 'as is.' What I also love about it is its versatility, in that you can add green peppers or a little more spice if that's your taste, and it turns out great. The only thing I do differently is saute my chopped onions at the same time as the rice to bring out their flavor. I've never had a problem with my rice browning and puffing; the only time I did was when I was forced to substitute parboiled or minute rice. For anyone complaining that it's too bland, rice is supposed to serve as a fire extinguisher for the other spicy/jalapeno/chile pepper items on your plate. This is the recipe I use all the time. Everyone loves it.

I had never made Mexican rice before, I guess I was intimidated by the dish, even though I grew up in Mexico. But this was phenomenal! The only changes I made were adding green onions and a whole garlic and instead of 2 cups of broth, I used two cups of water a 1 chicken bouillon cube. Delicious! Can't wait for dinner to eat with taquitos.

This is the closest to Mexican restaurant rice I have tried, and I have tried for years to find it.  This is a side dish, not an entree, and that is exactly what I wanted.  It turned out fluffy and not wet - which I usually have a problem with.  Finally, I have Mexican rice to serve with my Mexican entrees.  I cook for 8 picky eaters, and every single one of them loved it and ate a lot of it.

We had Mexican night Saturday and this was one of our recipes.  Even though I had to make a few minor changes, it came out just like our favorite Mexican restaurant.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added half a cup of diced green pepper I needed to use up.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a can of diced tomatoes and all the juice.  We all enjoyed it.

Just made this today with quesadillas for lunch and my family liked it so much that they requested that I make it every day.  I have often bought the little packets of convenience mexican & taco rice because I hadn't found a good recipe to make from scratch.... my family all agreed that this rice was better than any of the others.  (My kids actually said they would rate it higher than 5 star if they could)

Terrific! I did not have garlic salt, so I used 1 tsp salt and 2 crushed cloves of garlic. Not overly spicy, it was a great compliment to our soft taco bar. Even the kids loved it!

AMAZING and SO flavorful. I ended up just cooking the rice as normal (not in oil) to make it a bit healthier. The flavor is perfect, not too spicy. I made a massive batch to freeze and add to enchiladas but I just keep defrosting it and eating it as a side. My husband can't get enough of it!

I followed the recipe exactly, and lifted the lid off the pan after it was supposed to be ready to fluff with a fork... and none of the liquid had absorbed, so I set the timer for 20 more minutes... then it was less liquidy, but the rice was still hard!  So I set the timer for another 20 minutes and added water... still crunchy, very mad at this point, but not willing to give up, so I added more water and let cook for 30 minutes more... "most" of the rice was not crunchy after all that, but some still was, and what was edible was not good... don't waste your time!

Super good and easy!  I did change it some so I could use some of the tomatoes/produce from my garden and I loved it even more.  Changes I made were 1.) Rinse the rice in a colander for several minutes under cold water - to remove some of the gluten - then drain.  2.) Take about 3/4 c fresh tomato, cut into quarters, and about a 1/4 of a medium onion, sliced lengthwise - place on a cookie sheet, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper and place in a 450 oven until soft and roasted.  Set aside to cool, then chop. 3.) Saute the rice in olive oil and added a big clove of minced garlic and the cumin near the end of the browning process.  4.) Then added the chicken broth with 1 T. green chilies and 1 T. tomato paste.  5.) Add tomato/onion mixture to the rice near the end of the cooktime.  6.) and add a little cilantro and a squirt of lime when finished.  So good and I can taste all the freshness from my garden too.  Love it!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt after reading reviews about the dish being salty.  This was a good move as there was exactly the right amount of salt for us from the broth.  The rice cooked up perfectly in about 40 minutes and had a beautiful texture.  The flavor was VERY bland.  If I make this again, I will definitely jazz it up with more cumin, some fresh garlic, some hot sauce and some minced peppers.  My kids really liked the bland flavor but the only thing I liked about it was the texture.

This rice was delicious.  I had basmati rice on hand, so that's what I used.  I made a little mistake and added the tomato sauce while the pan was too hot.  I got splashed but it still turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good basic recipe. Rice took atleast 45 minutes on low to cook completely. I also thought it was a little bland, added some taco seasoning to taste.

I love Mexican flavours and this was great. I sautéed onions and garlic first before adding the rice. I also add a tex-mex seasoning. On the final product, MUST put some sour cream on top - it completes the dish. I had this with salsa chicken on this site - great pair!

My rice did not puff either.  This recipe had much less taste than I thought all the work and ingredients would have put in to it.  I was trying to make a nice side dish for tacos, but this was not it.  It's not bad, but it's not that tasty.  It's pretty bland.  I'll try another mexican rice recipe next time!

I decided to try this recipe since it had cumin in it--and I like cumin.  My rice did not puff either, but I just kept going with the recipe, and the rice did cook perfectly.  However, I couldn't taste the cumin and found the dish rather bland.  My husband's remedy for any dish not reaching par is to add a big tablespoon of butter.  This I did and it helped.

This rice tasted great, hence the 4 star review, but mine came out super sticky. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I sauted onion and garlic first and then skipped the garlic salt, and used chicken broth instead of water. Like I said, the flavor was great, but I think having to bring the liquid to a boil with the rice, instead of adding the rice to boiling water, made the rice very sticky. I made it for company and everyone had seconds, so it wasn't a big deal, it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I would make it again though, especially if I could figure out a way to change the consistency.

I was surprised how really good this was; being so quick and simple to make. My 14 yr old picky eater made it by herself exactly per the recipe. She isn't known to be a rice eater at all. She doesn't cook normally either but got grounded by mom and favored me that evening. She ate 3 helpings. This will be a staple for mexican meals at our house.

The seasoning is perfect in this recipe.  I changed it a bit to make it veggie and lower in salt.  I omitted the chicken broth and tomato sauce and replaced them with canned tomatoes in juice.  I know a big change, but the seasoning is perfect and really makes the rice.

This was very easy. I did use fresh minced garlic and sea salt plus I used my own homemade stock. I didn't have any but the family inhaled it.

Delicious!  I use brown rice instead of white and add an extra 1\2 cup of water as brown rice requires more water to cook.  It also takes about 20 minutes longer.  Well worth it for the health benefits.  Enjoy !

I love this very authentic Mexican rice recipe.  I double the recipe and make it whenever I serve up Mexican food for parties etc.  I always get a lot of compliments for it.  I boil the tomatoes till they are soft and then puree them so I have fresh tomato sauce instead of canned for this recipe. Delicious!

Using the suggested fresh garlic, and 1-1/2 c broth with 1/2 c tomato sauce, and cooking in the rice cooker yielded a Mexican rice my son loved! I used some taco seasoning, too.  I did not brown the rice first, so I could omit the oil as well.  The rice cooked up to just the right tenderness.

This was awesome! I didn't have tomatoe sauce, so I did some fresh tomatoes in the food processor. I also used 1 tomatoe bouillon cube made with chicken flavor along with 1/3 cup chicken broth, like one of the others did. I sauteed bellpepper, onion and minced garlic with the rice. I also added a little red pepper.

I've made this one twice this week.  I used the rice cooker.  It's a little moist but I remove the lid after the "ding" and let is evaporate for a couple of minutes and it's perfect!

This turned out really well. I have never fried rice before cooking it but the flavors really came out nicely! I added onions and garlic to the rice while it was browning and used some taco seasoning instead of the other spices just because I was wanting to use it up. So good! I will probably use a little less chicken stock next time because it was a little wet but rice is so finicky I couldn't blame it on the recipe

This is definetly my new rice recipe!  I have made it with salsa in place of the tomato sauce when I was out of tomato sauce and it comes out great either way.  I do add extra cumin, but that's just my preference.  I think this would be nice with a little chopped cilantro tossed in after cooking, too.  Also, ths freezes great and reheats well in a skillet sprayed with a little non-stick spray.

My family loved this rice!  My kids and hubby devoured it.  It tastes exactly like the rice you get at a Mexican Restaurant.  It has a nice mild tomato flavor and is super easy to make.  I served this with the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas from this site.  It really helped to round out the spiciness of the enchiladas.  I will be making this again.

I made this in the rice cooker.  Sauteed the onions before putting them in with the rest of the ingredients and hit "start" - 40 mins later delicious mexican rice.  I only had medium grain rice on hand and that worked out fine - a bit softer than with long grain but still tasty.

This rice was so good I could eat it by itself. However, I made a couple of changes: sauted the onions first with olive oil and used basmati brown rice intead of white rice.

I did not like this recipe, but I read the recipe wrong and added a whole 8 0z can of tomatoe sauce. My rice was somewhat dry and needed to cook longer so I added more water. My husband thought it was very good.

if you are making with brown rice, add a little more water. i used my rice cooker for this. would be good with some sauteed diced peppers, jalapenos or even corn stuck in it. flavor was good. i usesd homemade chix stock and found it worked great...my rice did not puff either, but was not worried from what other reviewers said...

I made this rice for a 9 year olds birthday party lunch, so I wasn't looking for it to be too spicy.  Instead of browning the rice in vegetable oil, I used Nucoa margarine (it's the only margarine that I've ever used that is impossible to burn).  The rice puffed up nicely.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as I felt the chicken broth had enough salt in it.  After it was done, it still needed something so I added a 4 oz can of diced green chilies (this was for a double recipe of the rice).  The green chilies seemed to add just enough flavor to the rice, without it being too spicy for kids.  When I make this again, I plan on adding a 4 oz can of diced jalapeno peppers along with the 4 oz can of green chilies.  I'll update this review once I try the recipe again!

This was a really good Mexican rice recipe.  I was really short on time so I did make a few adjustments.  I used the Success family size boil in the bag rice and boiled the rice in a mixture of water,chicken broth tomato sauce and the spices listed in the recipe.  After I took the rice bag out of the liquid, I added a little more tomato sauce and salt directly to the rice.  It was really great, and ready in about 10 minutes!

The first time I made this rice, I followed the directions exactly. It was good but not great. The next time I made it I cooked the onions in the oil first, then added the rice. After about 5 minutes, I added 1 tbsp of taco seasoning (from this site) and 1 clove of fresh minced garlic. Instead of tomato sauce, I used 1/2 of a small can of tomato paste and half of a chopped tomato. Really great with my alterations. The only thing I would do the next time is cut the oil down by 1 tbsp.

I substituted canned enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce to "kick it up" a bit.  Also, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and it tasted just fine.  This is an easy, delicious recipe.

I have made this recipe as is and with tomato juice instead of sauce and with onion powder.  Both ways are great!  The sauce makes it more thick, moist, and tomatoey.  The juice makes it more like the mexican restaurants do.  Oh, and I always add hot chili powder.  I have made this for 2 and 100.  Everyone loves it!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  Next time I will try to use a bit less oil to see if I can make it a little healthier.

Really good...yum yum.  I made this as a side dish with some enchiladas...mmmmm... I did make a few changes though.  The rice wasn't browning and puffing up at first, so after about 15 minutes I just added in the broth and it puffed up fine.  Also, instead of tomatoe sauce, I used salsa.

I sauteed the onion before adding the rice, and used taco seasoning (made with the Taco Seasoning I recipe), and it was delicious.  Better than a box, for sure, and no weird additives.

Tastes great!  Trust what everyone says about the rice not puffing. I ended up microwaving for 10 mins. after it being on the stove top for 40 mins.  If I did it again, I would make the rice first and then mix into the rest of the ingredients.  Very good though!

I really like this rice and my husband especially loves this rice. I have made this several times it has turned out great every time. I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp salt because i didn't have garlic salt but it turns out well that way so i won't even try the garlic salt. Also, I think it only needs 2 Tbs of oil, sometimes it seems too oily with three. I don't think my rice puffs before adding the broth and tomato sauce, but it does brown. I add the onions at the same time as the rice because they have to be completely soft for my husband to eat them and they are done at the same time the rice is if you don't cook it at too high of a temp. Thanks for this great recipe, I wont go back to the boxed kind.

The flavor on this was nice and it made for a nice change from plain rice.  I might be tempted to throw in some other seasoning or some Chilpolte peppers to add a bit more flavor next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe - exactly what I was craving.  I used my rice cooker and although the bottom layer burnt a little, the rest of the rice was fluffy and perfect.  I used 1 c. rice, 1 1/2 c. chicken broth, 1/2 c. tomato sauce, 1/4 c. onions I had sauteed first, and about 1 Tbsp. taco seasoning.  Next time I will probably add some diced tomatoes.

Over the years, I have become well-known for "my" Mexican Rice -- this recipe! I use 2 teaspoons of cumin and salsa instead of tomato sauce, but otherwise keep the recipe the same. It is so versatile and delicious. Not only is salsa a great substitute for the tomato sauce, but you can also use V8, green salsa, tomato juice, tomato soup and it still turns out awesome! This is a keeper!

Wow!  Super easy and really good!  I will put this in my regular rotation for when I make Mexican food.  I didn't have garlice powder so I used 2 whole, crushed garlic cloves.  And didn't have chicken broh so I used 1 large chicken bullion cube and 4 cups of water.  Couldn't have been easier.  I was really scared of trying my hand at rice, but really, this was just too easy.  I can't wait til I can make it again.  My 10 year old ate 2 heaping plates full because it was so good!  "Better than the restuarant" was her direct quote!

I've been looking for a good mexican rice recipe and I have found it!  Per someone else's suggestion, I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this sight and it turned out great!  Left overs were just as good the next day!

I used Mexican hot tomato sauce and more cumin than the recipe calls for.  Make sure while browning your rice you stir constantly or it will burn.  Also don't give up too early, let each grain of rice toast...that's what gives Mexican rice it's distinct flavor.

I am going to have to say that this wasn't very good, in my opinion. I thought the rice came out mushy, and didn't have much taste. On the plus side I would say that it was easy to make, and should be easy to touch up. I will try a bit more cumin next time, with a clove or so of fresh garlic, and cut back on the broth to firm it up a little.

This recipe is easy and delicious. Instead of 1/2 cup tomato sauce, I added 1 small can of Rotel tomatoes (we like hot). Rice is moist and does not stick together. Don't worry about "puffing " rice, just slightly cook in oil.

Great flavor!! I made this a few times already to serve with Taco's.  My family loved it.  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt it could use a few modifications to add flavor.  I will add to it next time I make this.

I make this rice at least once a week to go with tacos/quesadillas/burritos. So yummy, and SO easy to make with my rice cooker. Just chunk it all in and flip the switch! My only adjustments are using mild salsa in place of tomato sauce, and my husband likes a little more cumin thrown in for flavor. Oh -- and since I am a vegetarian, I use vegetable broth. I made it one time with chicken broth, and to me there's virtually no difference. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

Texture was perfect but flavor wasn't. Needs a little spice or something added to make a more flavorful rice. Good inside tacos/burritos or with a sauce but not good as a side dish. Will try again with some added ingredients.

this rice was awesome! i followed the advice of another reviewer and used taco seasoning instead of the cumin. i enjoy really flavorful food so i added 1 tbsp of the taco seasoning instead of 1.5 teaspoons. i don't usually use chicken broth (it's expensive!) so i just put in 2 heaping teaspoons of chicken stock powder in its place along with 2 cups of water and omitted the salt. i used fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt, used an entire onion, and also added a chopped up red bell pepper. it was soooo good. i will definitely make this again. i served this with "chicken enchiladas II" from this website and my boyfriend raved.

Wow!!! This rice does taste like the one from the Mexican restaurant. Maybe, even better... It's my favorite recipe now! Next time I will probably use 1.5 cups of rice (so it's more "dry" at the end) and only 1/2 tsp of salt (it was little too salty for me). Other than that, it's just perfect!

Wow!  Fixed this with Grilled Chicken Breast with Pablano Pepper Sauce, what a GREAT compliment.  Followed the recipe exactly, so simple, yet so very tasty.  The only change that I made was to add a couple of cloves of fresh chopped garlic with the onions.  This was delish and I'll definitely make it again!

Very good! Not overly powered by the tomato taste. I actually used a can of drained chopped tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. I also substituted basmati brown rice for the rice. It was very tasty. I served it with "Black Bean and Corn Quesadillas" from this site - the flavors and cuisine really compliment each other!

This is the way I was taught to make my rice by my mom and grandmom but, throughout the years I've changed the way I make my rice--for example:  When my kids were young they didn't like to see anything in the rice but rice (bits of onion, tomato etc) so, I used powder onion,cumin,garlic etc and as they grew I would add mixed veg.for added nutrition, and other times I omitted the tomato sause,cook  rice as directed but at the end of the 20 min. of cooking I would add the cheese of my liking and let sit in the coveded pot for 5-10 min. and gently mix all together.  The things you can add to this rice is endless.  Just adjust the liquid accordingly.  Sometines I add a few spoonfuls extra of liquid for a moister rice specially if adding a veggie that absorbs more liquid.
Instead of tomato sauce you can add your favorite salsa for an added kick.  Try different things just keep with the rice/liquid ratio 1 part rice 2 parts liquid.  ENJOY

We're getting there slowly.  I'm on the quest of finding the perfect, fluffy mexican rice for my DH who is Mexican-American.  His grandmother made the "best rice he's ever had" (of course!) and I'm trying to find something similar.  This one was fluffier than others and had great flavor (which from what I understand is supposed to be on the mild side, not strongly flavored).  I had no problem getting my rice to brown and puff.  I think some people are expecting it to puff like popcorn, and that's not the case.  What it does is swell slightly and go from being kind of clear-ish looking to being kind of pearly looking.  Good recipe and hubby is getting happier!

I made this twice in one week! My husband and I agree it taste just like his mom used to make it except she put in corn. So the second time I made this I put about a half cup of corn (that I took off the cob) It was tasty both ways but I prefer to add the corn to it for extra flavor. Also I used a white onion... Thanks for the great recipe!!

I happened to have all the items on hand for this recipe and decided to try it.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This is even better (more flavorful) than many mexican restaurants here in Texas.  Very savory, not too spicy.  Also quick and easy!

I thought this was rather bland- it needs more flavor or spice (and I don't even like spicy food).

Easy to Remember. Easy to Prepare. Extremely Delicious. Now reading those three phrases you might wonder why one would give a dish they speak so highly of only four stars. Well to be frank, I have tasted/prepared much better Mexican Rice but that isn't where the genius of this recipe lies. The brilliance of it resides in its straight forward nature which makes it perfect for someone who doesn't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen. The reason for this is the fact that the recipe maker delivered exactly what they promised and that was Mexican Rice. I found that the ingredient amounts were spot on which really made for a very cohesive/well balanced dish although I did find myself adding a little crushed red pepper just to spice it up a tad but that was purely a personal decision. To sum this all up it may not be the best Mexican Rice dish I’ve ever tasted but it is Mexican Rice in its purest form: Rice, Garlic, Broth, Onions, and Tomato Sauce. Thank you for sharing Mommyto2!

The rice turned out pretty good, but really mushy. I think next time I will omit the tomato sauce. I did add diced carrots, Goya Tomato and Cilantro seasoning (which makes the rice really orange by itself), and a small amount of Rotel (no juice) which really made the flavors pop! I will definitely make this again but tweak the recipe a little more. I gave this 3 stars because of the ingredents that I had to add, along with the fact that it was pretty mushy.

Pretty good rice. I used vegetable broth as I was out of chicken and added aprox 1/2 tsp each of chili and garlic powder. I also used a can of rotel in place of the tomato sauce, and added a handful of frozen corn at the end for color. A good side dish to serve with mexican fare.

this turned out really well, i even prefer this method to the usual boiling water method even though it requires more attention. i had no problem browning/puffing the rice.

Nice rice dish for a Mexican style meal. It is very flavorful, yet it doesn’t overpower the main dish. Added at a later date: I have to admit that this is the best Mexican Rice ever!!! I actually make enchiladas, just so that I can make and eat this rice!!

This was really good, nice and flavorful. I used homemade chicken broth. It reminded me of the rice from my favorite Mexican restaurant. I had tried to duplicate it before but I had not tried adding cumin before, I think that made the difference.

Finally I found an awesome Mexican Rice recipe that my entire family will eat. This was easy to make and yummy. I did subsitute the cumin with taco seasoning from the recommendation of a previous review. It gave it enough "kick". Next time I will add some corn to it. This is defiantly a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Easy to prepare, and I think it's much better than the prepared rice mixes out there. I used a can of diced tomatoes, and it turned out perfectly.

This is my favorite Mexican Rice recipe.  It is easy to make, and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  I make this with vegetarian tacos, and it makes for a really nice and filling meal.  I also used this rice as the basis for a taco casserole, and it came out excellent!

This recipe could use a little less oil.  I used canola oil to make it healthier.  My family likes spicy food, so next time I may put a can of chilies in or diced up a jalapeno.  Otherwise, if you don't care for spicy food, this is great!

I added some dried seasonings to this including dried cilantro.  Although my husband LOVED it, my kids and I didn't think it was great.  I may tried fresh herbs next time.

I've prepared another mexican rice recipe from this site and thought it was good, then it seemed dry the second time so tonightv went with this.  SOOOOOOO  good!!!!!  I'll never go back!  I used minced garlic with the rice rather than using garlic salt.

This recipe for Mexican Rice is GREAT! I used regular salt instead of garlic salt, Japanese short grain rice instead of long grain, and chopped tomato instead of tomato sauce. It truly was as good as other people had said. I made it for my family and everyone loved it!  I will for sure make this again, and as an added plus,it is super easy to make!

This was the best Mexican rice we had ever tasted, even compared to the rice we eat at Mexican restaurants! We followed the recipe exactly, except instead of garlic salt we added a teaspoon of salt and about a teaspoon of minced garlic. It was absolutely amazing - went excellent with some black beans and cilantro, pico de gallo and avocado. Highly recommended!

I like this recipe as I think it comes closest to the rice that Mexican restaurants serve. It's very easy and I can add a few more ingrediants to it like cooked ground beef and make it a main course.

I made this tonight, my hubby and I both enjoyed it.  I didn't have garlic salt, so I went with salt and some minced garlic with the onion.  Like others, I toasted the rice in a frying pan and added the onion/garlic there.  Once the onion was ready, I tossed it in my rice cooker with 1/2 c. salsa instead of tomato sauce, and only 1 1/2 c. chicken broth (per my rice cooker) along with 1/2 c. frozen corn.  I also added a little chili powder to the cumin.  I think next time I'll have to add at least one jalapeno for my hubby who likes his food spicy.  Thanks for the recipe!

My INCREDIBLY picky 2-year-old asked for more of this rice 3 TIMES! That, in my house, means a winner! Very flavorful rice, and incredibly easy to make. I followed the recipe to a T, except that I didn't have garlic salt, so I added a little less than a teaspoon of regular salt and a sprinkle of garlic powder. This is an AWESOME recipe! Thank you!

YUMMY! This recipe is SO good. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and substituted the tomato sauce for a drained can of tomatoes w/ green chilies. I also left out the garlic salt and replaced it with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1 minced clove of garlic. Once everything was mixed together in the skillet, I threw it into my rice cooker and it came out perfect! Tasty, tasty!

This was pretty good - all I had were pickled jalapenos so I minced some of those and put them in the rice...it was really spicy! I didn't have a problem with my rice "puffing" like some reviewers. As this was my first time having mexican rice I really don't have anything to compare it to.

very good for how easy it is.  I lived in Mexico for 18 months and have been looking for a rice recipe that is comparable in taste, but not in effort and so far this is the best one I've found.

This is easy to make, and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  It doesn't have as authentic of a Mexican Rice flavor as I'd like, and I'll continue to look for a recipe that fits our tastes better.

Pretty good.  Tastes authentic enough for me!  It was good with my tacos and my son really liked it, which is a miracle!

Very good!  Instead of tomato sauce, I used salsa and that gave it a nice kick.  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe scaled up to 15 servings for a Mexican themed luncheon. Everyone loved it!  I did use brown rice which increased the simmering time to about 1 hour, and needed about 1/2-3/4 cup extra water. Will make again!

This was so awesome.  My husband and I both loved it!  I will be making this again.  I used jasmine rice (rinsed it 3 times in cold water), omitted the onions, added onion powder and chili powder.  Thank you for sharing!

Mine cooked up oily, and I used brown rice which may have been a mistake.  The flavor was good though, I'll be trying this with standard white rice again:)

It was not bad!  I made it in the rice cooker after I sauteed the rice, spices & onion.  I then put the rice mixture in the rice cooker & added chicken broth.  Yum!

This is the easiest, most delicious mexican rice.  It is worth the little extra effort to have it fresh rather than from a box.

This rice turned out mushy and crunchy at the same time. I even rinsed and soaked my rice as another suggested. I thought the flavor was good, but I guess something just went wrong this time.

easy and delicious. I used the can of diced tomatoes like other recommendations and was a little worried that the rice wouldn't absorb all the liquid, but it did after simmering for 30 minutes.

We really liked this recipe. Didn't change anything, but we did add some carrots and peas. First time we've made good mexican rice. In the past we have tried the boxed store brands and they really never tasted good. This recipe had a good, mild taste that everyone enjoyed. Thanks!

Thi recipe is just great. I like using white basmati rice for it and to make things easy I just use a whole 8oz can of tomato sauce. I also omit the chopped onion. I think toasting the rice makes all the difference just be careful not to burn your spices. This recipe is so easy to adjust to your tastes and comes out perfect everytime I make it. Thanks so much! it was just what I was looking for.

Very similar to the rice my Mexican neighbor makes.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce.  Since the enchilada sauce has seasoning in it, I cut back on the cumin.  If you like traditional mexican rice, you won't be disappointed with this recipe.

This was very good although i made a few additions.  I added 1 can of drained green chiles at the same time as the onions and when the rice was done cooking i added a can of drained sliced black olives. I also served with some shredded cheese which melted on top.

I have made this twice both times using veg. broth.  the first time I followed the directions exactly but then let it simmer way too long but everyone still loved it and my neighbor wants the recipe.  The 2nd time I used brown rice and I didnt have tom sauce so I used 1/2 cup diced tomatoes (canned).  They still turned out really good.

I started with some left over brown rice that I had, and added some green peppers, real garlic, and canned tomatoes.  My Husband took it to work with him, and on of the women he works with said it reminded her of rice her mother use to make in Mexico.

This is an excellent, simple and delicious recipe. Tastes great AND like real mexican rice. I added a jalapeno for color but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I love it, i'm making it again tonight (2nd time in 4 days)!! I eat it with some pinto beans and a bit of sour cream.

This recipe can be improved very much by using bacon grease instead of oil and sauteing the onion with the rice.  I use some oregano and parsley along with cumin. I add a 3" piece of celery that has been sliced on the diagonal, and a sliced carrot before adding the broth.  In the summer I use fresh chopped tomato instead of tomato sauce. I omit the garlic salt all together and add plain salt.

Although I have not tried this recipe, it is very similar to my own with the following differences. I don't use garlic salt. I never use garlic salt in any of my recipes. I like to control the salt a garlic flavors. Instead, I use 1 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I also add 1/4 tsp of pepper. I only use cumin if my wife is not in the kitchen. When she makes the rice, she doesn't add cumin. I believe cumin does make this recipe taste better. I also use one 8oz can of tomatoe sauce which is 1 cup instead of the 1/2 cup mentioned in this recipe. 1/4 cup onions...well I probably use more maybe 1/2 cup. I usually use one small onion or 1/2 of a large onion.
Cooking time is about right.

This recipe is great, and super easy. I believe it could use finely diced carrots and peppers to be spectacular, which is why I am only giving four stars. I also recommend a non-stick pan, otherwise the rice is difficult to stir.

Very good with a few changes. I use minced garlic instead of garlic salt and add a little chile powder to spice it up.

I LOVE this rice! It's so moist and full of flavor. I think it tastes so much better then the restaurants. I think it makes a difference by subbing chicken broth with the water.

Not a favorite in our home. I thought the rice was a bit bland and could use something more. I will look for a different mexican rice recipe.

Perfect rice.  Just like my mom used to make.  The trick is to not stir or even lift the lid while in simmering stage.  Tastes just like the rice in a mexican restaurant.

I have looked all over for a recipe like this. It has a great flavor with the cumin, and there are no "chunks" for my kids to whine about and try to pick out. It complements other Mexican dishes well as the flavor is great and not too strong and overpowering, but not bland. The only change I make is to balance the amount of rice and liquid. It should be 1:2 (1 cup rice and 2 cups liquid; I use 1 1/2 cups broth and 1/2 cup tomato sauce) This allows the rice to cook properly and have the right consistency.

Great basic recipe.  I added half a can of chopped tomatoes, some corn, and chopped green bell pepper. Upped the Cumin measurement to 1 tablespoon and used fresh garlic! Tasty!

I made this with cheese enchiladas and the Apple Enchilada recipe.  It got rave reviews from my dinner partner!  I thought it was good as well.  I might try some more add ins next time though such as some green pepper or diced tomato!

I have been searching for a recipe for a Mexican rice dish for ages. This is the #1. I listened to other reviewers & added 1 T chili powder. I also added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes w/green chilis,in place of some of the tomato sauce & some of the chicken broth, as I make a double batch-I use the rotel in place of one can of chicken broth It added the spicy touch we love!Thanks, Sylvia for a super rice recipe!

This was just O.K. for us.  It was somewhat bland, needed quite a bit more flavor to win the hearts of this family.  As with other reviewers, ours never got past the "slightly underdone" texture either.

I've made this many times and I always get requests for the recipe.  If time permits, make this rice a few hrs ahead of serving.  The rice isn't as mushy if you let it sit for a while.  This is really great if you have to make it the night before and heat it up.  Also, once I used beef boullion instead of chicken broth and I think it was even better that way.

I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used enchilada sauce.  Very good and really easy to make.  I made this to go with Restaurant-Style Tequila Lime Chicken from this site.  With the leftovers, I sliced the chicken, added some of the mexi-ranch dressing from the chicken along with this rice and cheese then rolled everything in a tortilla - great leftovers!

This rice is amazing.  I used Jasmine rice for this recipe.  I had no problems getting the rice to puff but I didn't wait for it to turn golden.  The only other addition I did was to add about a tablespoon of taco sauce.  It gave it a nice flavour change.  This would be great in fajitas.

This is just about how my Mexican mother in law makes her rice ~ and now, my husband makes it too. We don't add onions, though. Not all the time do we use chicken broth either. Water works just as good.

Great recipe! I needed a side to go with the chicken enchiladas I was making, so I decided to try this. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used canned tomato puree instead and it came out delicious.I also didn't have garlic salt, so I added garlic powder and kosher salt. Even my picky-about-his-rice husband liked it. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe isn't as great as I thought it was gonna be.  I think there was a little too much garlic salt for my taste and it looked more brown than the traditional orange-ish mexican rice.  Next time, I'll add 1/4 cup more rice and see if that helps.

Where has this recipie been all my life! It is better than my favorite Mexican restaurant's rice! Just a tip if you are going to use dehydrated onions (I do because I hate chopping them), don't add them until after you add the chicken broth because they will burn fast!
Thank you Sylvia!

This rice is definitely full of flavor!  I added a little bit of mild salsa, which added to the already existing flavor!  I served with "Salsa Chicken" and corn.  This meal is a keeper in my household!

This was restaurant quality rice. I would have preferred it a bit hotter and will make adjustments for next time. I served it along side of the salsa chicken with mexican corn. Perfect!

My family enjoyed this rice. I needed much more rice than this recipe made-and it doubled beautifully. It went well with a chicken recipe from this site(Chicken encebellado) Will definitely make this again-now that I know how! Thank you sylvia :)

I was hesitant to try this recipe, but I'm glad I did, my husband (not a rice eater) and I both enjoyed it, I made it with the Beef and Bean Chimichangas from this site, it made for a great dinner.  Thank you for this recipe.

I used jasmine rice.  The rice was done and all liquid gone in the time stated in the recipe.  My husband and I both liked this recipe more than the boxed rices.  I'll certainly be making it again.  Next time I will probably put some corn in it.

I found this rice to be rather bland and the texture of it wasn't quite right when it was done. I cooked it much longer than called for and it still turned out a little on the crunchy side. I'm not sure what I did wrong but something was definitely off.

This recipe was easy to make and complimented my mexican meal fairly well. I found it took ages to soak up all the liquid, and in the end I just took the lid off and let it evaporate. The recipe is great for a basic mexican rice. I would have liked a bit more texture - next time I will add either diced tomatoes and/or chopped chilies like other people have suggested.

I would not make this recipe again although it tasted good.  The rice wasn't cooked when the time was up and the water was gone.  I had to add water to it to get the rice to finish cooking. Somthing was awry, but I don't know what it was.  I can generally cook rice with no problem.

Personally, I enjoyed this rice very much. A great change from the boiled or steamed standard. My husband, on the other hand, did not at all. I think next time I will add a little less tomato, and prolong the cooking time, since I believe it needs a bit longer than the original recipe cites.

I made this dish to go along with the cheese enchiladas my 11 year old daughter made.  It was very easy and tasted great.  My husband claimed it's even better than the rice at his favorite Mexican restaurant.

I really appreciated this rice!  I'm vegetarian, so used a couple of teaspoons of McKay's chicken style seasoning to make the broth.  I also added 5 tablespoons of chopped green chilis.  It did require a little extra water to make it nice and soft, but wow, the rice tasted wonderful!  Nice and soft texture.  Topped it with reduced fat sour cream and some mild Taco Bell sauce (our favorite!) and it beat any restaurant rice, hands down! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is just like rice you would get in a Mexican restaurant. It takes more work than I would normally like, but it really compliments a Mexican meal, and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed. The flavor was good?, but it came out way too mushy I would suggest using a lower liquid to rice ratio.?

This is so incredibly close to how my mother made it growing up. 
I didn't have any garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and a pinch of salt. I also used onion powder instead of a onion.
It was delicious!

It was good, fast and simple to prepare. I didn’t have any tomato sauce so I used a can of Rotel and puréed it in the blender. Also added Smoked paprika and chilli powder for a bit more zing. A nice accompaniment to shrimp and chicken tacos.

I make this all the time to serve with tacos.  It is better than you will get at most restaurants.  Turns out very moist. I like to use a high quality Jasmine rice and I will turn off the heat and cover before it is completely finished and just let it sit for about 10 minutes.

This turned out pretty good for a basic Mexican rice. I used salt separately from garlic powder and minced garlic plus added pepper. The rice does not "fluff" when you cook it in the oil it just browns some, the fluffing comes after you add the broth and simmer it. Good side for a spicier more flavorful main dish.

I love this recipe! But of course I’ve made a few changes.. because that’s us..  I use El Pato tomato sauce instead of regular .. and instead of garlic salt I use fresh minced garlic.. and I also add chopped jalapeños or serranos whatever is fresh in the garden..  when I sautéed the onions.. Sautée the garlic with the onions and jalapeños..

My favorite Mexican rice recipe. Instead of plain tomato sauce I use Sofrito from the ethnic aisle. It gives it just that little extra. I’ve found the frozen Sofrito by Goya is even better!

Yum!  I like the process of frying the rice first.  This kept the grains of rice more separate which I liked.  I had to use tomato paste instead of sauce because I was out of sauce.  I did add a few extra spices.  The 5 stars is because it is an easy versatile recipe that produces great results.  Finally I can make good Mexican rice.

This did not turn out as expected.  I followed the directions exactly.  The rice took about 30 min to soak up all the liquid and was still a bit crunchy.  The flavor was ok.  I may try it again to see if it was a fluke & will update the review if it turns out better.

Thank you for sharing your recipe!  Like others I altered it a bit. I used “Pato Hot Tomato Sauce” in place of plain tomato sauce and swapped the cumin out for TB taco seasoning. Stirred in 1C thawed frozen peas&carrots just before putting the lid on. The rice came out perfect. I’m putting this in my favorites for sure.

This is a really good base for rice. I doubled the recipe. I also added a can of chopped jalapenos, a can of diced green chillies, and a can of pinto beans. Very good. Use this as a jumping off point. Get creative.

I ran out of cumin so I used chili powder. Also I’m reducing my sodium intake so I used garlic powder. I added black pepper.

I made it just like the recipe.  Turned out great.  Next time, I think I might use 1 tsp chili powder instead of the cumin, just to try to kick up the flavor a bit, but I was quite happy with the recipe just as it is.  I will make this again, for sure.

I decided to reduce the amount of onion by half, and I added the same amount of chopped sweet red pepper. Also added some cracked pepper while it was simmering. I omitted the salt since my chicken stalk is salty enough. Delicious! The whole family loved it for our taco family dinner night. It’s the only way my 17mth old will eat rice lol.

I was looking for a healthy side dish to go with the Mexican meal I was cooking.  Instead of using rice, I used cauliflower rice, which I cooked, first, in the microwave for 9 minutes.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and then followed the recipe as directed. I figured that substituting the rice, works in my risotto recipe, why not Mexican rice...It was very good; nice flavor. My husband and our guests really liked it. Will do this one again.

Made mostly as directed. I only had a bag of a frozen blend: 3 peppers and onions, so I used that in place of the onion. This turned out amazing!! Only thing I will do different next time is add the onion/pepper mixture before the rice so I can brown them a bit. This recipe went astoundingly well with an "Easy Beef Enchilada" recipe I found from Pillsbury.

Update: This is my second time making them and I forgot to add the onion/peppers early. Lol but this time I added a can of rinsed black beans and made this my main course. Made a great lunch!

I've been making this rice for years.  The last time I made it, I forgot the tomato sauce.  I think it tasted better.  Otherwise, the only thing different I do, is add green pepper and fresh garlic with the onion.

I dont know how this has such good reviews. This was the worst. First of all, I doubled the batch to make 8 servings and cooked it for an hour and it STILL had pretty firm and chewy rice, not soft - and I could not even serve it to my family with the rest of the food. I kept adding chicken broth and tomato sauce and seasonings and cooking it longer and it just never cooked to softness after 1 hr.. and my family was too hungry so this went in the trash.  Do not recommend at all. Also, the flavor was pretty bland even when I doubled all the seasonings, and added more as I had to add broth and tomato sauce. Try another recipe.

This was a great guide. My hubby is Mexican and he thought it was his moms recipe. The only thing I did differently was to follow the suggestion of another comment on this recipe and use the taco seasoning 1 (found on the app) and put a tsp in the rice instead of the spices suggested in the recipe. I also used butter, not oil. But it’s now become a staple on me weekly meal plan.

This same recipe has been my go-to for years. It's impossible to find a box of Spanish rice in the store that isn't filled with MSG and unidentifiable ingredients. This is a simple recipe with basic ingredients that comes out better than anything Rice-a-Roni can produce. Takes about 5 minutes to prepare and 30 minutes to cook. Recipe is perfect the way it is!

I’m always super skeptical of Mexican rice recipes as I am from Texas and I am very particular about my rice. This one hit the nail on the head!! My husband and I absolutely loved it!! I actually printed this recipe out to add to my personal cookbook. 

I will say unless you’re an onion fiend, you don’t need a full 1/4 cup of them unless you’re using more rice. I also recommend adding corn if you want an extra boost.

Add a little bit of knorr chicken bouillon to your chicken broth to give it a bit stronger taste if you want. otherwise this is a great recipe. Also el sembrador rice is what I use for the best texture

I'm on a salt restricted diet, so left out the chicken broth and added minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Browned the onions ahead of time, like others have..  Also, I made it in a InstaPot.  Came out slightly sweet from the tomato sauce, but very good.

Extremely easy to make , but I was not a fan of the flavor of this dish when it was fresh.  It was better reheated the next day, so maybe the flavors take a little while to meld together.  My family liked it though, which is why I rated it a 3.  I personally won't make it again unless requested.

Sooo good! This was better than rice at our local Mexican restaurant. The only changes I encourage are saute the onion first until slightly golden and then add the rice. I toasted rice in the oil until it was a nice golden color. Then along with the cumin and garlic salt I added a 1/2 tsp of chili powder to the rice for nice color and flavor. Other than that I followed the directions to a tee. Great go-to recipe!

The only change I made to this recipe was cooking the onion before adding the rice as other reviews suggested.  I was totally surprised by the amount of flavor this rice has with so few ingredients!  Going to be honest, I had my doubts because there didn't seem much to this dish, but this recipe proves that less can be more.   My family loved it!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was very good and easy to make. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I added some chopped bell pepper for color and made enough for 6 people. The flavor was very good, but I did add a small amount of home taco spice (found on this site) along with the spices in the recipe. I didn’t have any garlic salt, so subbed garlic powder, intending to add salt, but I forgot to add it. That made the dish a little bland, but with the addition of salt, it was very good. I will make again. Everyone enjoyed this with our tacos, so I’m a happy cook.

Just meh. If you like GREAT Mexican rice you should pass this by. Needs some real punch ups for brightness and savor. Just a calorie filler as far as I am concerned. Booooortrrrrinnnnnggg.

Just made this tonight (with a few tweaks with what I had in the pantry), and all of us loved this! 
First, I sauteed the onions in the oil, then added the rice (only had regular white rice, but it still was delicious). Then I added a can of chicken broth, a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies not drained, a 7.5 oz container of tomato sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, a bit of cumin, and some chili powder.
Topped with shredded cheese and sour cream. It went PERFECTLY with our tamales and beans. Will be making this one again soon!

This was probably the best Mexican rice I’ve ever had. It was delicious, easy and the perfect side to any Mexican meal. The only thing I did different was adding some extra water near the end and too much cooked off.

I used this basic recipe and added more spice and heat.  After toasting the rice and sauteeing the onions, I substituted a can of peeled and chopped tomatoes with green chilies for the tomato sauce.  I also added a teaspoon of chipotle chili sauce to the simmer liquid.  Delicious.

Very good. I will definitely make it again. I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so I used some salsa that was in the fridge. I browned the rice and onions in a non-stick skillet, then moved it into a medium size saucepan to cook the rest of the way. (I needed the skillet for the tamales!)

I tried to follow it as written, but should have sautéed the onions first, as the rice got too brown while the onions were cooking.  The next thing, and may be I bought some old rice or something, but it has beeen simmering for 1.5 hours and some of the rice is still crunchy.  I was thinking that may have to do with frying it in oil first, which I know is the traditional Mexican way, but theirs is never crunchy.  Thinking about starting over before my company gets her in two hours.

I didn't have tomato sauce, but I did have a can of diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro. It was very good that way, but i think it would be better if I had made the trip to the store for tomato sauce.

I used lard instead of oil and added a little bit more onions than called for.  Very yummy recipe.  I used to have a recipe similar to this one years ago, but it didn't survive a couple of moves.  So glad to find it on allrecipes.com

Perfect, the whole family loved it. I didn't have garlic salt so just added some fresh garlic with the onion.

Easy and flavorful.  We like spicy so I added a teaspoon of red chile powder from Chiimayo, New Mexico.  It was perfect level of smoky and fruity heat.  Yum!

This tastes most like restaurant Mex rice!! I've made this many times and I have substituted salsa for the tomato sauce and it definitely brings the heat! :)  (however much you want, mild, medium, hot). I've also used rotel-type Tomatoes and chiles...oh, so good!  The key step is to do the oil and rice in the beginning, that will open up the rice grains to absorb the flavor....Cumin is my new secret ingredient ;)

* I used instant Brown Rice and tripled the recipe for a family dinner side - 10 adults and a few littles. I had a little left over. So so good and moist. Took abut 45 min due to instant BROWN RICE. fyi.

I've made this several times.  The only thing I added was to sprinkle the rice with chili powder alongside with the cumin and garlic salt.  Perfect rice every time!  If you haven the tried this recipe, you are missing out.

Wonderful easy recipe.  My family loved the flavor.  Reheats perfectly.   I did have to change the tomato sauce because I only had tomato paste.  I used 1 tbsp paste.   I hate to leave reviews on anything if I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but my change wasn't really anything important.  So if you are in a pinch, 1 tbsp of tomato paste works, too.   Just make sure to whisk it with some of the water from the recipe first.

My guests at the hotel I worked at scraped their plates when I made this with taco boats for a special. Instead of using tomato sauce (because I didn't have any at the job) I used salsa that I watered down a little. All the other ingredients I kept the same. It tasted wonderful. 
Look at my books on Amazon!

Don't substitute a generic long grain white rice for Uncle Ben's.  Big mistake.  The cheap rice dissolved into mush.  The mush was tasty.    Use Uncle Ben's or don't bother to make  this recipe.

I made it per the instructions, was kind of bland. I will make it again but will add more spice, perhaps some cilantro and cayenne.

I added up green bell pepper just like what others did. 
I'd like to try to use brown rice for a healthier version next time.
Absolutely delicious. Thanks for this recipe!

Very flavorful. I loved it so much I ate it by itself and used leftovers to make breakfast burritos the following morning. I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce since that's what I had, so there were chunks of tomatoes throughout. Will definitely be part of the normal rotation.

This is a good basic recipe. But I needed a bit more spice so I added jalepenos from the jar with a shot from the jar's liquid. I also added cilantro. Fantastic

I made it and it was good, but I ended up changing the recipe by making adding salsa or fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  It gave it an extra zing!

I didn’t have tomato sauce but had medium chuncky salsa on hand so I substituted it. I think that elevated this recipe to the next level because it added a kick of spice and also the veggies from the salsa.

I added portabella mushrooms and fresh spinach to the other veggies and sauteed all before adding the rice. Threw some steak strips I'd marinated overnight (oil, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger) into a skillet when the rice was almost done and serves this on a four tortilla. On a whim, I added lemon slices to the plates, and when the lemon juice hit the rice--pure perfection! With all the veggies this made a generous amount of rice, but...not one grain left.  My family loved this dish.

This rice is perfect! I’ve made it 4-5 times and it is always perfect. The only addition I make is jalapeños ; I add 3-4 whole freshly washed peppers  at the same time I add the broth and tomato sauce. Their delicious flavor gives it just the perfect flavor and kick.

Made this for Cinco Dr Mayo and it was a hit. I used real garlic and salt instead of garlic salt. I also used my rice cooker and out came out perfect. (Cooked the onions first, added the rice and browned a little. Added the garlic, salt and cumin and cooked another minute or so...then put it all in the rice cooker with the chicken broth and tomato sauce and turned the pot on. Perfection!)

We loved this.  Because I was using up food on hand, I made several changes:
 - Substituted chopped fresh garlic for the garlic powder 
 - Substituted 12 oz. can chopped tomatoes for the tomato sauce
 - Added a small can of chopped mild green chilies
Like previous reviewers, I first browned the chopped onion, then added the fresh garlic and rice.
I'll definitely be making this again.  It was excellent.

Having a party so multiplied it x6 and added some Taco seasoning and bell pepper as another reviewer suggested. . Mild flavored - should be good as a side dish or in burritos.  Seemed too moist (used a cup of oil as I had multiplied everything by 6) so will use much much less oil if I make a big batch again....just enough to coat the rice and sauté onions.

I have been using this recipe for over a decade now anytime I make a Mexican meal.  The only changes I had made is with the amount of water.  I use 1 and 1/2 cups instead because I use Jasmine rice.

Easy receipe.  I doubled the receipe except for the oil.  I might reduce the oil to  2 tbsp if making one cup.  I also added 1 tablespoon of mild chili powder from Savory Spice.   Came out perfect, not mushy or undercooked.  I browned the rice really well.  It is important to use good quality rice.

I added diced green chili pepper and tomato. Cooked rice in oil and broth. Added pepper, tomato (diced), onion, Cheyenne pepper, and tomato sauce about and 2/3 way cooking. Went great tequila lime chicken. Thank you for the recipe!

Honestly it ended up mushy and gross. I usually love Mexican rice, and this was just a big no.

My husband loved this, so it's a keeper. The modifications I made were I used sushi rice instead of long grain as it is what my hubby prefers, because of this, I will need to reduce the amount of oil for next time. I also used salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt , as it is always too salty. It cooked up beautifully and was a welcome side to the huevos rancheros we had.

This is a go-to recipe for us. I always add more onions and cumin.  I occasionally add ingredients depending upon what I serve it with. I've added a half can of Rotel, drained and also have added homemade enchilada sauce. You can do a lot with this recipe.

if you sauté some fresh garlic 2-3 cloves  an onion and a  green pepper  to this dish and then add 1 teaspoon chili powder to the rice  it would taste much better

My husband has never liked my Mexican rice.  I tried this recipe and he said this time I nailed it.  I did have to add a little water at the end and cook about five minutes longer.  It was effect.

I cut grains out of my diet 4 years ago, so I'd forgotten how to make Mexican rice, but needed a recipe to serve it to guests. This recipe is just like the one I had previously memorized but forgotten. If I'd had them, I would add some kind of pepper or green chile for a little color and/or additional spice, but the recipe stands alone without them.

I made this to go with my black bean flautas. Ignore the word "puffed" when initially cooking in oil. When the rice is brown then you are good to with the rest of the recipe. Also, I paid attention to other reviews and sautéed the onion and a few cloves of garlic in the oil before adding the rice,  just a small can of tomato sauce, and water instead of chicken broth. This turned out GREAT!

This is going to sound kind of funny, but I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so I used about 4 Tbs of ketchup and sprinkled a little more of the cumin to compensate.  Turned out great!

I used really liked the base of this.  I  I doubled the recipe .  Tip and time saver is to blend the onion, tomatoe  sauce and a few garlic cloves in the blender with the stock.   Add extra chicken powder to the blended mixture  for real flavor and pour into the sautéed  rice  and cook as directed.  I omitted the cumin as my other dish had  a fair amount in it.   This base  is easy and delicious!

This turned out awesome but it looked like it was going to be a flop while I was making it. I used chili powder because I didn’t have cumin (which is in chili powder) and I browned the onions before adding the rice. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly.

I made this according to the instructions. It's super salty! The tomato sauce and especially the chicken broth add plenty of salt on their own. Using garlic salt took it over the top.  The only 2 flavors that came through in this dish were salt and tomato sauce. I was taught by a Mexican grandmother to use cumin, garlic powder, a tiny tiny amount of oregano and about a teaspoon of Gebhart's chili powder.  We couldn't eat this.

This is a great basic Mexican rice recipe. The  adjustments I made: I doubled the recipe, omitted garlic salt, added 4 crushed garlics and a dash of salt. My kids and I loved it. I will be making this again :) Thank you for submitting it!

This is a simple, very tasty Mexican rice dish. It compliments my (typically very spicy) Mexican dishes well!  I followed the recipe exactly except adding about a teaspoon of fresh garlic along with the garlic salt & cumin. 
Two thumbs up!

This recipe is insane! It's legit, real mexican restaurant rice, and it's so simple! I resisted the urge to modify and I'm glad I did, honestly, it's perfect, just follow the instructions and you'll be glad you did.  It's hard to not eat all 4 servings by myself!!

I just love this recipe.  I substitute 1/4 cup El Pato sauce mixed with 1/4 cup water for the tomato sauce called for in the recipe.  The El Pato adds just the right amount of kick to make each bite flavorful and authentic.

This is SUCH a great and easy recipe! I doubled it and the only thing that was different for me anyway, was that it took a bit longer to come together. I probably cooked it for about 30 minutes or so. I was worried because it was still so full of liquid after about 24 minutes, but I stirred it and let it keep cooking and it came together just fine. LOVED the flavor and texture. SOOOO good!

I love this recipe so much. I found it on this site about 7 years ago and have used it every time I make enchiladas or fajitas. I have gotten so many compliments on it. The only thing I do differently is use salsa in place of the tomato sauce.

I made this dish according to the directions. My rice did not puff. The tomato sauce turned it into a giant gloopy mess! I don't know what went wrong, but I won't make this again.

I decrease the Liquid by 1/4 cup, and exchange 1/2 cup of the chicken broth with seasoned bean juice (as I always make seasoned refried beans when I make this rice) otherwise I follow the recipe. Turns out great every time and we love it!

I substituted a few things. I once lived in Mexico and I saw the ladies make the rice before. So therefore I made it with real tomatoes blended up in the blender 2-3 tomatoes with two cloves of garlic minced up.  I shred  the garlic on a very thin cheese slicer. It blends better and has less chunks. I Added some salt and pepper  it was fantastic.

I made this as written once, and it was good. Then I made it multiple times with one minor adjustment: instead of using garlic salt, I used 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 1/2 tsp pink Himalayan salt.  I increased the salt only because I used unsalted chicken broth and unsalted tomato paste.   This is an excellent recipe, but I think it was bland the first time due to my unsalted ingredients.

I've made this probably 20 times and every time it turns out amazing. This time I used salsa for tomato sauce and bone broth for chicken broth. Better than restaurant quality.

Rinse the rice first to get it fluffy! This is a mild Mexican rice. Strong on chicken broth, tomato flavor. Just enough spice for my kids.

Totally easy to make, very easy to adapt to personal tastes.  I make a bunch and freeze, along with homemade Pinto Beans for quick Mexican Bowls with Chicken, corn , cheese and Salsa.  So far, my favorite recipe for Mexican Rice!  I did leave out the cumin and added Garlic, with a dab of Tapatio.

So I've made this twice...the first time I made it to the letter of the recipe and it wasn't so great. The second time I wasn't paying close attention and it was a BIG HIT in the household! What did I do wrong? Well I guess that's a matter of perspective because it is definitely the way I will be making this recipe in the future. I STARTED WITH ALREADY COOKED WHITE RICE. Then I reduced the amount of chicken broth in half and cooked it on a little higher temp until it cooked down. It turned out so much better the kids even liked it! Great for Taco Tuesday!

As a very proud Mexican, I have cooked all kinds of Mexican dishes with ease but could never master making really good arroz. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. This is honestly the only fool proof recipe I have found and I have made it 5 plus times and it always comes out perfect. Always a hit and everyone loves it.

Minor alterations... I use fresh minced garlic a little extra tomato sauce and additional onions. But this is more for personal taste. 

Amazing!!!

I followed the recipe. I would suggest dry toasting the rice.  I used oil, but the toasty taste of the rice was missing.

This is our favorite Mexican rice recipe. We often use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. We also often use dried onion and it still turns out great. We also use less oil than it calls for.

I used fresh garlic and  fresh chillies. Passata for the tomato sauce. I added red kidney beans also. It was fine. You could add more chillies for extra bite.

I agree that this is a good basic recipe for rice.  I made a few changes and would give it 4 stars with those.  Instead of the garlic salt/cumin I used a tablespoon of homemade fajita seasoning (I was making this with fajitas).  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used 4T tomato paste with 1/4 cup of extra chicken broth.  I sauted the onion with some jalapeno and garlic then added the rice and toasted it.  I sprinkled that with the fajita seasoning and cooked for about 30 secs.  Then I added the rest and let it cook for 25 minutes.  The rice was still a little crunchy - so next time I might add 1/4 cup additional broth.  Overall it is an easy recipe and something you can adjust to fit what you have on hand.  Thanks!

This was very very mild.  I would like to see some green pepper and onion pieces- maybe a chunk of tomato.  Nice basic recipe that could be used as a good start.

Easy and delicious side dish! Served it with the black bean and corn quesadillas (also from this site) to make a complete (veggie) meal. Used the Taco Seasoning I recipe. 2nd time making the taco seasoning I reduced the chili powder from 1 tbsp to not even 1/4 and I omitted the red pepper flakes so that my 7 y.o could eat it.

|Excellent and easy recipe. Next time, I am going to try to add in the taco seasoning in place of the cumin. It just needs a little something extra. This is a fool proof recipe and easy enough to memorize. Will continue to make for some time to come!

This was quick, easy and tasty.  The only change I made was I  used the taco sauce package that comes in a taco kit (the  thin one no one eats!) in place of tomato sauce.

We use this recipe everytime we have mexican food (which is ALOT) It is the best spanich rice we've had and I have a mexican brother in law! The only thing done different for us  and that is only to suit our taste is to add  coriander cilantro  and petite diced tomatoes because you just can't have enough cilantro or tomato flavoring in mexican food! Excellent!

There were a few things I didn't like about this recipe, but feel like it could be good with some adjustments. 1 tsp of garlic salt makes this recipe entirely too salty.  I'll make this again but next time I'll use garlic powder instead and just salt to taste. Also, 3 tablespoons of oil is just not necessary, I was skimming oil out of the pan when the rice was cooking because I realized it was too much. 1 tablespoon is probably plenty.

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I took a reviewers advice and added some bell pepper to the recipe. I am watching my sodium so I used no salt added tomato sauce, and fresh garlic, did not add any salt. My family thought it was seasoned perfect and said it didn't need any additional salt. The recipe also doubled well.

I have made this rice many times and it comes out perfect every time.  My only change is to use El Pato hot tomato sauce and it gives it just the right kick.  Not too spicy at all.  I make a full recipe and then freeze in freezer bags in individual servings for whenever I have a mexican meal. YUMMY!

Was weary of making this recipe for a large group of people without testing it before, but it turned out great. Was very moist, easy to make, and tasted just like the restaurant's. Will definitely make again in the future! *The only thing I changed was that I did not add any onions*

Great rice. My only change was to brown the rice in butter instead of oil and add in the minced onions right after the rice. Good flavor but will not over power what you will be serving it with. I will definitely double the recipe next time.

Used mild salsa instead of the tomato sauce and onions, but the quantities were great. Rice is always a disaster for me but this turned out really well! Will definitely make again.

Perfect recipe for taco night, or any Mexican themed food night. Super simple and tastes amazing. Every boxed Mexican-style rice that I picked up had at least 1 preservative-- it's great to find a home cooked recipe that's easy AND tastes better than the box. Thank you!

Ok, I'm guilty of editing this recipe. However, I did make it as written the first time. And I knew it was a good base recipe. I followed son suggestions here on other reviews and mad a few of my own changes. What you end up with is way tastier.

We didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used taco sauce instead which gave it a much more spicy, Mexican flavor.  The red onions in it were great!

I used minute rice instead of reg. rice due to living at a high altitude minute rice works better for me...I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used 3/4 can of diced tomatoes/juice.  I also used dried cilantro because that's what I had. Didn't use the chicken bullion because I use Tones Chicken stock base which is very rich depending on how much you use. Overall it's been the best Mexican rice I've found, just waiting for the hub's 2 cents ;) I would suggest the original poster explain about cooking the "raw" rice in the skillet and not pre-cook it.

I think this is a great recipe. I was looking for a simple recipe to go along with some Mexican dishes and this was a hit. I don't typically change anything at least the first time I make something but I did NOT want to stand over the stove and cook rice. I only cook rice in my rice cooker so in order to do that here I sautéed the onion in some butter on the stove and pretty much did everything else the same but added it all to my rice cooker and the machine did the rest. It turned out so great I'm making it again to go with some tacos tonight.

Great simple recipe for Mexican rice. I add a few more onions and caramelize  before adding rice. Depending on who I'm making it for I will sometimes add some chili powder for heat.

Loved this recipe ! First time I made it I followed the recipe and found that for my taste it had to much cumin. Now I make it at least once a week.

This has become a go-to recipe as a side dish for enchiladas.  I usually add some corn and diced tomatoes to give it a little more color/body.  Good flavor but not overpowering if the main dish!

I followed the recipe except just like the first reviewer I used 1 1/2 tsp of taco seasoning instead of the cumin and garlic salt. I sprinkled a little bit of garlic. I also used chicken bouillon instead of the broth. I am Mexican and I can tell you that this is how my Mom made rice. Delicious simple and not at all greasy. Thank you !!

This was average at best. Would have rated it 2 star, but my 4yo had 3 helpings so at least someone seemed to really like it. I did add quite a few different spices to give it some flavour and served it alongside salsa chicken and with a bit of sour cream on top. The chicken definitely went down better than the rice.

Added a can of (4 oz.) green chilies.  Used 1 (14 oz) can stewed tomatoes & 1 (141/2 oz.) chicken broth.  Have only tasted it but it tasted great!

I did not care for this recipe. Followed recipe to the tee. 
Used just plain white long grain rice, nothing fancy. 

The rice took nearly triple the time to cook. I had to triple the amount of stock.

This was my first attempt at Mexican rice and it was good. It was a little too tomatoey  so next time I might try the rotel tomatoes and use fresh garlic.  It wasn't as fluffy as I expected so I'll try letting it sit for 20 minutes after cooking.  I will definitely make this again!

Made it exactly as written and we loved it! Subtle flavor, tender rice. Excellent side dish for our fajitas (along with spicy cheesy refried beans from this site). Next time I think I'll put the rice in a serving bowl, sprinkle with a little cheddar cheese and garnish with green onions, keep it covered so cheese melts. I won't be buying boxes or envelopes of mexican rice from the store ever again!

Great recipe and so easy to make. I doubled the recipe, using brown long grain rice. For the tomato sauce, I used El Pato Salsa de Chile Fresco, and I also added 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes. I cooked this along with the slow cooker refried beans (on this site).  My husband and son both said they taste better that what you get at a restaurant.

This is a delicious recipe. no fail . I used a combination of basmati and sticky rice (that's what I had). Used 2 tsp fresh garlic. Doubled the cumin. Add 1 tsp kosher salt. use butter & olive oil to saute. Saute onions first with cumin. (this brings out the flavor of the cumin) add rice and garlic. You Could add green chilies  if you like! then chicken broth. If you are using bouillon, decrease the kosher salt. I liked it better than my favorite Mexican restaurant rice!

omg, this was amazing. We were looking for a simple dish that was tasty but didn't have a whole lot going on in it. I actually added an extra teaspoon of garlic salt and an extra teaspoon of cumin.  I think I might have to make two cups of rice next time. There were no left overs!

Followed the recipe almost exactly, but substituted Vegetable Broth to make it vegetarian friendly.  Very easy to make and pretty close to an authentic Tex-Mex restaurant flavor.

This was my first time ever making Mexican Rice.  I made a few changes. I increased the ground cumin from 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp, I increased the diced onions from 1/4 c to 1/2 c and I added one small fresh diced tomato. This dish was real simple to make and I will probably make it again.

Made it as a side dish for our burritos.  I didn't have garlic salt or onions.  I added regular salt and pepper and substituted green pepper for the onion.  It was easy and fabulous!  The recipe doesn't look like it will make much but it served six with leftovers!

We were very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. We unintentionally didn't follow the recipe to a T. We accidentally put in 1 cup of tomato sauce instead of 1/2 like was called for in the recipe. We also had to use beef broth because we were out of chicken broth and I didn't realize until we were already making the rice. However, the dish was still great. Next time we will make it according to the recipe, and I'm confident it will still be great!

This was yum-ilicious! My husband and kids loved it and said, "Encore, encore"!

I doubled the servings to 8. I added a can of Mild Green Chilies and ¼ cup of fresh chopped Cilantro. I think I'll add maybe a ½ can of diced tomatoes next time for a bit more flavor & moistness.

Delicious.  I didn't have tomato sauce but used a half a can of diced tomatoes and lowered the amount of water in the chicken stock to account for the extra liquid in the canned tomatoes.  
The second time I made it during peak tomato season so I chopped up two fresh tomatoes and used two tsp of chicken stock mix with one cup of water.  
My toddler goes nuts for this rice, he has fits while its cooking because it doesn't cook fast enough.  It has become a weekly staple with our Taco Tuesday night.

I love this rice. It's so easy and tasty, my whole picky family loves it. I usually skip the garlic salt and just add some diced garlic, but I don't really consider that a modification, just personal preference. So yummy!

LOVE.THIS.RICE.  Sooooo great.  Don't let the simplicity of the ingredients fool you....this has TONS of flavor if you do it right!  DO NOT use a rice cooker, either!  You must remember to sautee the spices as you brown/toast the rice so the flavors absorb into the rice. So important!  Add some fresh garlic, too!  The toasting of the rice gives it a nutty depth.  Once I forgot to add the spices in this step & added later....didn't taste the same.  Use a good quality chicken broth or cooking stock, as well.  The garlic salt is important, otherwise it'll be too bland.  I also sometimes use El Patio spicy Mexican tomato sauce.  Small yellow can in the Hispanic aisle of your grocery store.  Gives it quite a bit of "punch".  Serve this with grilled fajitas, tamales, enchiladas or tacos for an outstanding side dish.  I like to garnish with fresh lime wedges & chopped cilantro and occasionally add grilled corn kernels.  So amazingly yummy!

This is a great starter recipe. After the first time making this I made the following changes. I like the rice sautéd in butter, added fresh minced garlic and the chopped onions once the rice start turning brown.  Put unsalted chicken stock in a large bowl, added petite diced tomatoes, cumin, fresh or dried cilantro, salt and pepper. Stir to mix all the ingredients then add to the rice, let simmer 20/25 minutes.

I made this rice last night for our Taco Tuesday dinner. We all liked it. I left out the vegetable oil, put all other ingredients in my rice cooker and 20 minutes later we had a great side dish. I did have to add a little more broth to the rice than the recipe called but I'm sure that is because I put it in the rice cooker instead of cooking the way the recipe called for.

Excellent recipe as written. I made a few subtle changes due to personal taste.  I used Knorr chicken bouillon dissolved into 2 cups water vs chicken broth, garlic powder to taste vs garlic salt and I cut the onion down to 1/8 cup.  Excellent! I found that cooking it the full 25 minutes was perfect. The rice was not dry at all. This is becoming a staple dish in my home and it has just the right hint of flavor without taking away from the main dish. Perfect.

I was just browsing when I saw this recipe. I made it with fajitas, and my family loved it! I don't use garlic salt in my kitchen so in place of it I just added a tsp. Salt and a tsp. Minced garlic. Seriously so good!

So I guess I changed the recipe quite a bit. instead of garlic salt I used 2 cloves of garlic and instead of cumin I used about 2 tbsp of taco seasoning. I also cooked my onion first then my rice and added a can of mixed vegetables and topped the whole thing with cheddar cheese. but it was amazing. it tasted just like rice from the restaurant and there was none left. will definitely be making this a lot.

This is a very authentic take on Spanish/Mexican rice which I have made many times before seeing the recipe! I learned it from my ex wife's family who are Mexican and love to cook. This recipe usually turns out better rice  than most Mex restaurants I have tried.
Well done !! The other recipes here look good and probably are easier and quicker to make…but the cumin is an important flavor that makes the dish sing !! Keep Cooking ! Chris "jazz cook"  Ho

I've tried so many Mexican rice recipes that have failed me--ones that call for crazy rice varieties or expensive herbs that I'll never use again (that's you saffron!). Never mind that nonsense! I've found the best recipe...and it's quick and cheap! This recipe is just perfect and is very similar to what I love at my local Mexican restaurant. Thanks for posting!

I followed this exactly as written and was very pleased with the results.  I doubled recipe including the garlic salt and it was a little too salty for my taste so if I double the recipe again I will cut down a little on the salt.

This recipe was good. Pretty basic. Real easy. Just like the rice at restaurants. I do have another favorite on here that is much more labor intensive, but for quick authentic taste this is great.

I used garlic and onion powder instead of garlic salt. If you are from San Diego and miss the taco shop rice, 1/2 a cup of tomato sauce is too much and the rice turns out too red. use a little less and it will turn out awesome!

such a great recipe!! Tastes exactly like the rice I love from the mexican restaurant. I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth to make it vegan, and it turned out wonderfully.

Excellent recipe! Just like the rice my Mom makes. I've added diced jalapeños on occasion. I also use 3/4 cup tomato sauce (small can). Great flavor!

Love this recipe, I used a medium salsa instead of tomato sauce and skipped the onion since it's in the salsa.  So much flavor, perfect every time!

Excellent and authentic.  I live in New Mexico, so I couldn't help but add 1/3 c. chopped, roasted green chile with the onions.  Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly.  This is the Mexican rice  we will eat from now on.  Better than take out from our favorite local restaurant!

My husband couldn't stop talking about rice after I made it with my normal beef fajita meal. I followed the recipe but I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a half a can diced tomatoes that were roasted garlic so I didn't put in the garlic salt and added normal salt. So good and of all the recipes I searched, this was so easy.

This is GREAT.  Hands down what you get in mexican restaurants in the midwest.  I use basmati rice (it's more forgiving with it's cook time and moisture content).  Thank you!

I tried this recipe because it called for ingredients I had on hand & it is a winner! Every time I make it, it turns out fluffy & wonderful. I use a spicy tomato sauce to give it a little more kick - yummmmm!

After trying many Mexican rice recipes on this site and others, this came closest to the "comfort food" Mexican rice that my grandmother in El Paso used to make for me growing up. I add the onions in with the rice and let them soften while the rice is browning, and I also add some finely diced green peppers and a bit of minced garlic. This is frequently requested in my kitchen!

This was a VERY easy rice dish.  It is truly authentic.  Its very close to my Aunt Maria's recipe.  This has great mild flavor that doesn't overpower the dish.  A MUST try.  You will make it again and again!  YUMMO

This had become my staple spanish rice recipe. It is very good. It's really delicious made with basmati rice!! Sometimes I throw in a handful of corn and/or black beans depending whats on hand or what we are in the mood for! Great with a side of refried beans.

This was really delicious!  You can use the suggested spices or use your own.  I followed the recipe and used Taco Seasoning.  The 2nd time I made it, I added double the cumin and added Chipotle Chili Powder.  Both times were good.  I also doubled the recipe.

My son loved it!  Great mixed with chicken and cheese (again, for child).  But, too salty and too wet.  Reduce broth a bit and reduce salt.  I used real garlic.

Easy to make and don't worry, the rice puffs up when you add the sauce/broth and steam.  I added the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site instead of the cumin.  I added 1.5 tsp of the seasoning.  I also added some chicken bouillon granules to boost the favor.

I followed this recipe exactly and it lacked flavor.  Maybe  like some other reviewers mentioned that using stock instead of broth and fresh garlic may help increase the flavor.

I made this for an extended family dinner of 11 and every single person loved it. I followed the recipe as written (doubled it) and now expect this to be a staple for Mexican night.

This was wonderful. It was fast and easy and tasted so much better than I expected. Usually I end up tweaking a recipe along the way but this I made as instructed and it came out perfect. When I tested the rice after cooking I was disappointed but after it was mixed up (some of the tomato sauce had settled on the edges and needed to be stirred back in) and sat for a minute or two it was delicious. It was a big hit with the family and by the time dinner was over they were demanding I make it again in the future.

We liked this but thought it might work better for us as a main dish with added chicken or beef.  The flavor is good but strong...we thought it overpowered our chicken enchilada dish.

While this recipe was very easy to make it was just okay.  I didn't dlslike it but it wasn't really great either.  I may make it again, but will most likely look for another recipe that is a bit more tasty.  It was much better the second day.

Other than letting the rice boil a little too long, which made it puff up too much, this was a great side dish.  I took the advice of someone else's review and added a little chili poweder and garlic salt which added more great flavor to the rice.

This was my first time making Mexican rice, so I was nervous it wouldn't turn out. I only had Basmati rice on hand and it still turned out to be delicious! It was not too greasy like some Mexican rice can be.

I ended up trying this recipe using sushi rice because I didn't have any long-grain, and it turned out great!  Probably a bit more wet (soggy) than it would have using regular rice, but it still tasted great.  If you like your rice more on the moist-side, this turns out great.    I just cooked it until the liquid was mostly gone, so it may have been longer than the suggest time.

Yummy! This rice had perfect texture! The taste was really good but I felt like it wasn't quite enough flavor. Next time I make this recipe I will alter it slightly by using 1 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp ground cumin, and 3/4 cup of tomato sauce. Enjoy! XoXo

Great Rice.  My wife usually makes the mexican rice and i finally made one that she likes better than her own.  I used 1 cup of fresh chicken stock and 1 cup water as the stock was rich.

We really enjoyed this rice! The recipe is great as written, it is mild and versatile. For a bit of extra spice and flavour, add some taco seasoning mix (from this site). I also like to use freshly blended tomatoes in place of the tomato puree.

Made this rice yesterday for the first and it was delicious. I followed all the steps except that I used garlic powder and salt instead of garlic salt. Will def make this again.

I’m an “authentic” Tex-Mexican from south Texas and in my opinion this recipe is 100% authentic. I alter my recipe a bit depending on my audience’s taste preferences. For example, I might use 1/4c bell pepper or 2 tomatoes, or ½ c tomato sauce if I don’t have fresh tomatoes, or even ½ tsp garlic salt if I don’t have fresh garlic.  Sometimes, I even omit the jalapenos or chicken bouillon. I recommend following the exact recipe and then altering to your taste preferences or dietary needs/restrictions.

I usually hate Mexican rice. I have tried a million different types and have disliked them all, but I needed a side dish for company one night and for what I was making I thought this would be the best possible choice. To my surprise, when I tasted it I LOVED it! I actually went back for seconds. This just became a new staple in our house whenever we have enchiladas! It's a delicious and super easy recipe!

A great easy and quick basic mexican rice. My kids enjoyed it.    
When having company over, ill be reaching for my more authentic recipe with more ingredients and a few more steps.  But for a good side dish quick this was good

I thought this was a solid side dish, but it doesn't really stand out in the taste department for me.  I eat Mexican occasionally, and just came back from a trip there, and whatever it is that they do to the rice makes it more flavorful.

Should either substitute canned diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce or use keep the tomato sauce and add in chopped fresh.

I used frozen rice from Trader Joe's and blended it with all the suggested ingredients. It was perfect and took 5 minutes. I also used spicy salsa instead of tomato sauce and everyone loved it as a side.

I usually turn rice into mashed potatoes, but this recipe was super easy. I took the advice of other reviewers. I made it in a medium sauce pan, sauteed the onion first. Used the Taco Seasoning recipe. Also I used concentrated stock and a little less water.

Very simple recipe that tastes fantastic. I let the rice sit off the heat for ten minutes after cooking for twenty to fluff and absorb the remaining liquid. Thanks for three great recipe. I don't often repeat recipes, but this one is going to be a regular!

Best Mexican rice I have ever made or eaten! Tastes like the rice I get from my favorite Mexican restaurant. I did use butter instead of oil to saute the rice though.

Very good.  Following your recipe allowed me my first rice victory. I always seem to over or under cook rice; however, not this time. BTW, I didn't have garlic salt, so I ended up adding a clove of garlic. Great taste.  Thank you.

The flavor of this was amazing.  But, I messed up something and the rice wasn't cooked enough.  Maybe didn't to enough of a boil, or didn't cook in the oil long enough (although it was a nice golden color) or my simmer was too low.  The rice was a bit crunchy.  But I ate it anyway, because it tasted so good.  Will try again another time.

I doubled the batch and added 1/4 cup of Penzey's Taco Mix (equivalent of one packet).  Because of this, I omitted the salt.  The rice was a bit mushy but my daughter loved it.  It did need a little more salt but that was my fault.

This is my go to recipe for Mexican Rice. I use Mexican Tomato Sauce (El Pato brand) which adds a little bit of spice to it.  I like it best that way. Mmmm.  So good.

Excellent! I used one clove minced garlic in place of garlic salt. Perfect side dish to a spicy mexican dinner! I think the other reviews are confusing mexican and spanish rice-two totally different tastes.

I used Sazon and a little cumin and I though it had good flavor. Good basic recipe for you to make your own.....

DELICIOUS! I only had Jasmin rice on hand. Not sure if it's the same as "Long Grain" or not, but it worked out better in this recipe than the directions on the back! Haha! Every time we cook this rice there are still hard bits in it. No matter what we do. This recipe worked out great though! No hard bits at all! I think it has to do with the browning the rice in the oil first. Anyway, this rice is wonderful! I left out the onion because I started without prepping first, and during the browning you REALLY have to stir constantly or the rice will stick and burn, so I was too preoccupied with the 1st step to cut up the onion. I managed to get everything else in without any disasters. This is diffidently a recipe you want to have all prepared and near by. It was delicious without the onion though! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I used bouillon for the chicken broth because I was out.  It made the rice salty.  That was totally my fault.  I will be more careful next time.

This is the recipe that I have been searching for what seems like forever! This makes Mexican rice just like what you will find in a restaurant. Easily customizable to add a few green chiles or whatever else you want to put in it.

great recipe, thanks! The first time I made this I only had brown rice and it was ok, but the flavor and texture of the rice was just too present. Tried again last night with regular ol' mahatma long grain, and it was perfect! light and fluffy, so easy, and delicious!

I really enjoyed this rice.  It was surprisingly easy, and I've never cooked rice before, but this turned out great.  I didn't use long grain rice, but a Japanese medium grain, but it worked well.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added some minced garlic before I put the rice in.  I also used half of a a chopped white onion, a whole tomato(diced), and a jalapeno(also diced).  Instead of tomato sauce, I used a small can of tomato paste.  I also added fresh cilantro at the end.

Very good! I have made this twice already. The first time I messed up the recipe and cooked the rice instead of letting it puff with the garlic but it still turned out really good. I just drained the water before the rice was cooked all the way and only used half the broth for the remaining cooking time when everything was mixed in. The second time I followed the recipe except I used salsa instead of the tomato paste which already comes with onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc. and that was really good also.

Best Mexican Rice recipe ever! I modify it by using about 3/4 cup mild salsa instead of onion+tomato sauce and it comes out perfect!

I quite like this.  I generally use brown rice instead of white rice and adjust the timing of it a little.  Works like a charm!

This is really great. I've started using a can of rotel instead of the tomato sauce and only 1 cup of chicken broth. Makes it spicy and really flavorful. Making it tonight with pork carnitas. Yum!

I'm a little more traditional, lived in So Calif, growing up, worked in San Francisco,and when I tretired in 89 move to Mexico, 12 years, San miguel de Allende, as I love cumin, in many Mexican recipes, but nmot Mexican Rice, actually have not seen a Mexican family or Mexican restaurant, (in Mexico) use cumin in Mex. rice.also the redness looks like Spanish rice, I use ripe tomato, or good canned tomato, and only add enough to make rice a little pink not red. But now I'm in North west Montana, Mex food is very basic, most Montana people like a very mild version. So if I delete the cumin it is a good recipe.

I gave this 5 stars because it truly does taste like the Mexican rice you get in restaurants, and that is what I was looking for. I was afraid I'd mess up and it wouldn't turn out right, but it was really easy. My rice did not puff up during the first step, but I went by all the reviews that said not to worry about that and it turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good and easy! I made this with Jasmine rice, and I added 1tsp chili powder. As other reviewers have said, the rice doesn't puff but does brown. I will try this next time with brown rice (I am currently on a health food kick!)

This was pretty good.  the first time I made it I used brown rice and it didn't turn out right, the rice was hard even after cooking it for 50 minutes.  
Second time i made it I used white rice and it turned out fine.  I thought it was way too salty though.

I had been trying to make this for so long and could not get it right until this recipe. I follow it exactly and it is the best rice ever....I have made it for several parties and everyone raves over it. I had the compliment  it is better than Pappasitos....I do not like their rice but I still took it as a compliment.

Excellent! Yes, it does taste just like Mexican restaurant rice. Great served alongside refried beans and tacos. I also tried sprinkling with shredded Mexican cheese blend and heated it til it melted. YUM!

I made this for my in-laws on Mother's Day and it was a big hit.  Even my hubby, who is very picky when it comes to Mexican, loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.  I used the advice Valerie's Kitchen gave about the Taco Seasoning.  Excellent suggestion!  Yummy!

I've never browned or puffed rice, and it really worked!!  I used Uncle Ben's Whole Grain Fast and Natural Rice (whole grain parboiled brown rice is the only ingredient) and olive oil on medium low heat in a sauce pan (no lid to cover for my skillet).  It took a little while, kind of like popcorn, but it was obvious when the rice "puffed".  After adding the other ingredients and bringing to a boil, cook time was only about 10 more minutes.  Watch it, because it will stick to the bottom of the pan otherwise.  Yummy!  It's on my make again list!!  Thank you!

I was hoping this recipe would be as good as the mexican rice I can get back home in Texas, but no such luck. Not only did my rice not "fluff" (it did however golden), at the end of the suggested 20-25 minute cook time it was still completely hard. I also had to add extra water to it just to get the rice a little more tender. After letting is simmer for an extra 20 minutes, I will now eat my crunchy mexican rice and wish I was back in Texas.

Very easy to make compared to so many recipes that I have tried. Very good as well. Wash the rice for at least 2 min, this makes it more fluffy.

THis came together really quick and yielded great results. Next time I may increase the onions, increase the salt just a little, and try adding some sauteed bell peppers. But the recipe is great as is.

The spice tastes right. I used V8 instead of tomato sauce for some extra zing. The amount of oil listed is way too much. I will try 1/2 the amount next time I make this.

This recipe is so yummy! My husband says it's the best mexican rice he's ever had and he loves mexican food. I used sea salt instead of garlic salt and added 2-3 minced garlic cloves with the tomato sauce. This is a keeper for sure!

Amazing! We have made this recipe countless times and it never fails to be delicious. I follow the recipe to the T, except cutting back on the cumin for my 'cumin sensitive' husband. If we're cooking Mexican food, we're making Mexican Rice II. Thanks for sharing!

Terrific recipe. I made it exactly as written (with brown rice), and while it took longer than 20 minutes (likely because brown rice takes longer to cook) it was fantastic!

My family loves it and it was easy, so this is a definite recipe that will be added to our repertoire.

I LOVE this recipe! The only change I make is that I add about half a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies to make it a little big spicier.

This was very good, I really enjoyed the flavor of the rice and it was super easy to make.  The only addition I made was I added some diced red & green pepper and added with the onion.  The cooking time is longer than 20-25 minutes though, it was more like 40-45.

This rice was good and easy to make. I also sauteed the onions a bit in the oil before adding the rice, and I definitely think that helped for people who don't like biting into onions. I followed the recipe except for adding a little chili pepper to add a little more spice. It is a good basic recipe. Next time I will use a bit less oil as it seemed a little greasy and I will throw in some hot sauce to spice it up again, but this was a good base for sure.

It's a very basic recipe that's easy to prepare. So for that it's a 4 star. But I'll give only 3 stars for the end results. It's quite plain, even after I added some taco seasoning as suggested in a review.

This recipe is so great and SIMPLE! I guess I thought it would be more complicated to make really good Mexican rice, but I had all the ingredients on hand and I had amazing rice in no time flat! A new staple at my house!

I made this for my girlfriends on a girl's night with chicken tacos, salsa, and guacamole. It was perfect! I added some chopped tomatoes and most of a can of green chilles too which made it taste just like it came from a mexican restaurant. It reheated really well too. I will definitely make it again!

Very good base recipe. Good thing about it, is you can add your own elements. Green pepper and onion are a must next time.

This rice has a fantastic flavor. I used brown long-grain rice, and 25 minutes wasn't nearly long enough to cook it, I think you'd need a good hour to simmer it to be soft enough. I will definitely be making this regularly, it's a perfect side dish to enchiladas or any Mexican main course!  Thanks!

I tried this recipe tonight with some friends.  The only change I made was I used Olive oil instead of Veg oil.  & Also add in fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Added 1/2 cup of diced tomato's & 1/2 cup of kernel corn after I added the chicken broth.  It was so Good!  We served it with Enchilada's DELICIOUS!  Thanks so much!

This recipe is great!! Wanted a simple recipe that did not have a need for a lot of veggie chopping prep. I did lower the amount of stock to get a drier rice. all my friends love it on taco night.

Left out the onions because of my young kids and this was GOOD & EASY!  Thanks!  Made it for a birthday party and 10 relatives agreed (believe that?) that this recipe was much better than box or bag mixes (and much better for you).

My family and guests loved this. I made a few changes though... I first sweated the onions in grape seed oil and then added the rice. I cooked it until browned and then added 1 diced tomato, about 3/4 cup of tomato sauce and 1 can of chicken broth (instead of the 2 cups--it's easier to add one can than to open another can for an ounce and a half) I then cooked it as directed and it turned out so good. Loved having the pieces of chopped tomato in there!

I really liked this rice, it's not too spicy but tasted just like the restaurant style that I was looking for! The only thing I did different was use about half of a packet of taco seasoning and add a bit more salt because the tomato sauce can be a tad over powering. Otherwise great recipe!!

The flavor of this good, with a few extra shakes of taco seasoning. I always opt for brown rice, and browning the rice makes for an interesting texture. Kind of chewy. Not bad, just different. I will try without browning next time and share my verdict on which is preferable.

Finally an authentic Mexican rice recipe. If you want  more heat add jalapenos. Can also use fresh tomatoes.This is the basic recipe my mother-in law in Mexico used ( without the cumin and jalapenos)

This simple yet flavorful recipe has become my family's favorite side dish with fajitas or tacos. I add just a pinch of saffron at the end for another wonderful layer of flavor.  I just love the texture of this fluffy and authentic rendition of a Mexican restaurant staple.  I have tried many recipes on this site, and this is my favorite!

I made this the other night with quesadillas and it was so good! I took others advice and sautéed the onions before cooking the rice and used the taco seasoning mix from this website. We really enjoyed this. The only problem I had was walking off and forgetting to check the rice so I overcooked it a little so it got slightly mushy but it still had great flavor!

This was a great recipe.  I read other reviews and cooked my onions a little before i added the rice.  I also used the taco seasoning 1 mxture instead of the cumin and garlic salt.  My whole family loved it and I know we wil make it again soon.  Thanks.

We used tomato sauce and it was AWFUL!  I've made mexican rice a thousand times using real tomatoes or salsa in place of the canned tomato sauce with significantly better results.  Won't be making this one again :(

I have made this several times and it turns out great every time. I add hamburger, canned corn, and diced tomatoes to mine to make a one-pot dinner. I first made it as is for a side dish and it's super that way too.

yumm, yumm yumm. It's so simple and so delish.  It was my first time making it.  I added extra garlic and fresh farmers market tomatoes to make it extra good.  It's easy and my one year old couldn't' get enough.  I will make this again and again.

This was a good basic rice recipe.  I felt it was lacking something though, so after cooking i added some more tomato sauce, a few chopped green onions, some chopped green chilies (I made this as a side to the southwest stuffed chicken on this site so I had leftover chilies) and most of a can of corn. Tasted great! Next time I think I'll make this with a can of diced tomatoes. I didn't have garlic salt so I used 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and salt.

This may be the best Mexican Rice I've ever had. I saute the onions a little bit first, then add in the rice and spices and stir a couple minutes, then follow the directions for the rest. It turns out perfectly every time and it is our go-to rice recipe for a Mexican side, along with Best Black Beans, also from this site. Yummy!

This recipe was very good but instead of the oil, I used margarine, just a bit more healthy, and I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste balanced out with water seasoned with a tsp. of oregano garlic powder and parsley , also i used minced onion instead of fresh because I find them to be more flavorful! and the rice came out excellent!

Love this rice.  I make this quite often as a side dish to our mexican dishes.  I skip the first step and just bring the liquids to a boil and then add the rice.  I do not add the oil or the onion (kids don't like onions).  It cooks up nice a creamy with just the right amount of spice.  Will continue to make often.

I had never cooked "real" rice before, but it definitely takes longer than 20-25 minutes. It took over an hour for the rice to cook. It missed dinner, but everyone tasted it when it was done and loved it. The recipe is very good. I doubled the recipe and added tomato boullion in place of tomato sauce and it was really good. We'll definitely be keeping it with our enchiladas!

I would give this 4 1/2 stars.  It was easy, didn't take too much effort, used ingredients that I already had on hand and had a good flavor.  I read the other reviews and did make a few minor changes based on reviewer suggestions.  In place of the garlic salt and cumin I used 1-1/2 tsp taco seasoning, added half an onion and half a red bell pepper and used 1 cup chicken broth, 1 cup water.  I will definitely make this again.  I found it to be a little saucy, not runny, but more saucy than the Mexican rice I order in restaurants, so if you want it less saucy you may want to add a bit more rice, or less liquid.

We did not like this the first time I made it - WAY too salty! - but I gave it another try.  The second time around I used garlic powder, a smidge of salt and I replaced about 1/2 c. of the tomato sauce with picante sauce.  FANtastic!

A good basic recipe, but it definitely needed some extra oomph. I added more cumin, smoked chipotle, and extra salt.

Very good as a simple side.  My husband seasoned up some black beans, and they were very good together.  I do have to admit that I made one change though.  I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used diced tomatoes with pepper & onion.  I think I would have preferred it with tomato sauce as written, but I was pleased regardless.

* I've made it multiple times now, and though I may prefer it as written, diced tomatoes are almost as good.  I switch based on what I have and if I want little chunks of tomato or not.  I've also been known to make a 4x batch and use some of each.  I love to have this frozen for a quick side for a Mexican dinner.  Tonight it was baked chicken breasts with salsa and a little cheese, some black beans, and this rice.

This is the best _actual_ Mexican Rice recipe here. The other two highly rated ones are not Mexican rice at all. Use this if you're looking for authenticity.

I thought this was very good.  Instead of adding the onion later, I browned them up with the rice and also added some bellpepper.  My family loved it!  We added it to our taco salad and it was so tasty!  The rice did take longer to cook than it calls for.

Fantastic every time I have made this at least five times. However I add minced olives, green peppers, minced garlic, kidney beans, and chicken...great way to spice up and to turn from side dish to main dish.

The spices were a bit off, and the finished product was kind of oily.  It's a good starting point.  I will make again, just with a few modifications.

My family loves the taste of this rice, though I learned the hard way to use garlic powder or minced garlic rather than garlic salt.  With garlic salt and broth made from chicken bullion cubes it's WAY too salty.  I've made this twice now, though, and, I simply cannot get the rice to cook.  I guess next time, I'll cook it ahead of time.

This rice was way better than I expected! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and served it with black beans and enchiladas. I don't think I would prefer it on its own but with the meal it was perfect.

I love this recipe. I love mexican rice and beans. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used condensed tomato soup. My husband and kids loved it so I might have to go get some more tomato soup instead of using the sauce I just bought. GREAT RECIPE!!!

This was the best mexican rice I have made.  I have made another from this website but it wasn't as good as this.  I served this with Restraunt Style Chicken Nachos from this site and it went well with it.  This rice tastes just like the rice I get from my favorite mexican restaurant.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

My family loves this rice.  I always make it exactly as written and it always comes out perfectly.  It has a nice flavor that truly compliments the Mexican food that we pair it with.  My search for a great Mexican rice ended when I found this recipe!

Excellent rice for a side dish with enchiladas!  Very simple, but oh so good.  I didn't have any garlic salt so I used granulated garlic and added salt.  I also sprinkled on a little taco seasoning.  I'm sure it would have been good enough without, but I thought, what the heck!  Mild enough for kids.

This was perfect...simple and delicious.  I added some corn and black beans for a bit of a tex-mex flare and it came out wonderful!! I also put in the leftover juices of from the beef cubes and taco seasoning I used to fill my enchiladas and I tasted the difference.  The recipe is a basic start that only needs any specific taste additions but it is great just the way it is. Thank you Mommyto2, you took me from a "yeah mom it's good" to a "Wow Mom, this is 'bangin'".  Apparently that means really, really, really good.  Thanks and Enjoy everyone!

Even though I (accidentally) didn't follow the cooking directions, this one was really good!  I used brown rice, added seasoned hamburger and topped it with sour cream and cheese.  Could be made with chicken and wrapped up in a tortilla.  It's just good!

I used this recipe has written except I added a can of RO TEL diced tomatoes with green chilies, drained and added just before covering rice to set for 25 minutes and it sure gave it a wonderful flavor with a little bit of a kick.  Everyone loved it!!!

I LOVE this recipe!  Made it for the first time for Cinco de Mayo, and the minute everyone took one bite they were raving about it.  I doubled the recipe but left the oil as is, as I was trying to make it a little bit healthier.  I used plain garlic powder for the garlic salt and just put a few grinds of sea salt in, and I used 1 T of dried minced onion in place of the chopped onion.  Very very very good.

This was just ok.  Found it a little too salty.  I would suggest lowering the amount of salt, or lowering the amount of broth and substitute with water.  Not sure if I would make this again.

I have never made Mexican rice before and made it for a work function.  It turned out really good.  I did take some advice from previous reviews and used taco seasoning instead of cumin and garlic salt.  I used about 3 teaspoons to taste and garlic powder instead of salt.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  It tastes so close to the rice dish at out local mexican restaurant.  I need to spice it up just a little bit in order to make it perfect, but I haven't figured out how I will do that just yet.

Just what I was looking for, a recipe similar to mine that makes a smaller batch. This recipe yielded tender fluffy rice, better than my other recipe. I omitted the garlic salt and used 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and added sea salt. I also added in black pepper, a pinch of sugar, frozen peas & carrots, and fresh chopped cilantro. I agree with the reviewer who said that Mexican rice is a side dish meant to accompany the spicier entree and it is supposed to be a little blander, this was what Mexican rice is supposed to be! Thanks for the keeper recipe. I am making it from now on and it is easier than my old recipe too!

I am a super-lightweight when it comes to spicy food, and this was very bland for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, but will use taco seasoning next time.  However,aside from being bland, the flavor was still good.  Just needs a little zing.  It was easy to make and I'll be making it more.

Great base to make mexican rice; it only gets four stars because you need more spices for that real authentic kick. As recommended by others, I used Taco Seasoning I to really get great taste.

This was ok. I cooked as stated on the recipe but it took forever for the rice to cook all the way through. I grew up eating Mexican rice and I can never find a recipe the way my mother made it. I'll try to make this again but until then i'll continue my search.

I've made this several times following the recipe exactly, and it is delicious exactly as written.  I've also made it using brown rice, and that is good too but not quite as good or authentic as the original recipe.  Last night I tried to use a shortcut by using brown rice and throwing everything in the rice cooker.  That didn't work - the texture was all wrong, and the rice didn't seem to absorb the seasoning as well.  It was edible, but not nearly as good as doing it the old fashioned way.  I'll stick to the recipe from now on.

This rice was very good... I did make some changes though... first I made my rice in a rice cooker and then transfered it to the stove top to simmer with the chicken broth, tomato sauce and spices. I also added a can of Rotel tomatos w/chilis (drained), a little fresh lime juice and cilantro. It was fantastic. Next time I would probably add even more cilantro and lime just for some extra flavor but overall this recipe was a great starting point.

An excellent Mexican rice recipe. I add 1/2 cup of frozen peas and carrots before covering. Many Mexican restaurants here in Texas do that and it is so good. Otherwise, I make it exactly as written.

I  made his rice exactly as the recipe says to, and it came out very very bland. It didn't taste like anything. I think next time I'd be better off making white rice with some salsa added to it, it would have more flavor than this!

this rice is our families favorite because it is the closest to our favorite authentic mexican restaurant's rice.  yumm-0!  the only change i make is sometimes adding salsa in place of the tomato sauce because i always have salsa on hand & open in the fridge, as opposed to a can of sauce (which tends to go bad in the fridge when opened & not used up quickly).  this flavors it up a bit more, it's milder with plain tomato sauce of course.

SO GREAT! Thank you! I made this in my cast iron skillet that has a cover. Not sure if that had anything to do with it! Followed the recipe to a T, but used garlic powder instead of salt, and did a dash of 'gray salt' and fresh ground pepper. My boyz loved this, thank you!

Wow, this was so easy and tastes like the side of rice served at authentic Mexican taquerias or restaurants.  Be patient and toast your rice, but be careful not to burn it.  After adding the broth, I added 1 cup of the frozen(canned could be used too) mix containing diced carrots, peas, and corn for fun.  Great side to any Mexican-inspired entree.

My family really liked this recipe, even my picky daughter!  Fairly simple to prepare, however, I will add less broth next time, as it was very soupy still after cooking for 25 minutes as directed.

As Mexican rice goes, this was pretty good. My guests at a Mexican-themed dinner party loved it. I made it with vegetable stock for the vegetarian in the party and it still had plenty of flavor.

It was way too oily. The flavor was good, but it was way overshadowed by the oil.  It's no wonder that a serving is 7 weight watchers points.  Weight Watchers has a much more flavorful mexican rice recipe that's only 2 points per serving.

Looked and tasted like Mexican rice. Was a little greasy to start with -- could probably reduce the oil if you wanted to. Used 1/2 cup red enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauch (probably would have been bland without it). Added a shake of frozen peas and frozen corn, too, which made it look prettier. Used in enchiladas and as a side dish. Will make again for sure.

I didn't think this was very good at all. Followed the recipe as it said, and found it to be very bland, yet extremely salty. I don't think I did anything wrong in making the recipe. Definitely will not be making again.

Yummy! But made a few alterations... Instead of using vegetable oil I used olive oil... and I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I used ketchup instead. I'm sure it would have tasted better with the tomato sauce, but oh well!!! Thanks for feeding me, allrecipes.com. =)

We've made this recipe several times, and love the Taco Seasoning suggestion - I add about 2 tsp of that. I also reduce the oil, else the rice is a bit greasy. Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  Everyone in my household loved it!  The only change I made was I used 2 chicken boullion cubes plus 2 cups of water for the chicken broth only b/c I did not have any chicken broth in my pantry and didn't feel like going to the grocery store. It was still delicious. I'm making it for the second time tonight.

I added freshly minced garlic, extra cumin, cayenne pepper and garlic powder for some extra flavor.  I also took the suggestion to saute the onions at the beginning. I also doubled the tomato sauce as my rice seemed to absorb all the liquid after 14 minutes.  I really enjoyed this finished product.

This is the best recipe for Mexican Rice that I have tried.  It tastes like what you get in a Mexican restaurant.  It's simple to make and we love it with any Mexican dish.  I usually add a can of black beans to the rice after it's cooked.

This rice was soooooo good and easy!! I made it even more simple by throwing it all in the rice cooker after sauting/browning the rice.  Came out perfect! The ONLY reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I thought it had way to much oil. I doubled the recipe and still only used 3 tablespoons and could still taste it the oily-ness, as could one of my guests.  Next time, i'll halve it again. We eat very clean in our house, maybe thats why. Anyway, this recipe will be the only one i use for mexican rice. very flavorful and super easy!!

Basic, but good.  Saute some fresh garlic w/the onion first, then add rice to brown.  Use the El Pato tomato sauce in the small yellow can for more of a kick.  When rice was done, I added cream of chicken soup, sour cream, a can of corn and about 3/4c of a shredded taco cheese blend, transfer to greased casserole, sprinkle small amount of shredded cheese on top and bake about 25-30 min's at 350.  YUM!!  Very nice starter rice, great for tweaking!

I made my own version of Mexican Rice using this recipe as a guide. I had half a can of Rotel left from my dip so I made 2 servings and replaced the tomato sauce with Rotel. Served with fajitas using "Marinated Flank Steaks," "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce," Rotel with Velvetta Dip, and "Lola's Horchata."

Great recipe! I added a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning to it and changed the tomato sauce and chicken broth to 1 cup. DH found it a little bland and added some hot sauce to his which did improve it. I added chicken and sausage to the leftovers for lunch the next day and it was very good.

This was delish! I made a few changes but nothing major. Instead of using ground cumin I used Chili Powder, and a tiny bit more garlic salt. As well as red onions! First time I've ever made Mexican Rice. ^___^

This rice turned out pretty good considering the fact that I am a terrible cook. W/ some tinkering I think it will be a 5 star. For one, my rice came out a tad bit too wet but I think if I reduce the broth by 1/2 cup since you are adding 1/2 cup tomato sauce it will turn out better. Also, I didn't have time to puff the rice or whatever, I just threw it all in a pot and used dehydrated onions. Still super yummy! I used it as the base to a "naked" burrito bowl. And, don't forget if you are out of garlic salt, substitute 3 parts salt to 1 part garlic powder.

Super Easy and great taste.  The rice doesn't actually puff during the saute stage.  Just be sure and take your time browning the rice.

This rice is sooooo good!! My husband always has two (or three) servings, and my 2 year old loves it too.   I never have garlic salt so I use a combination of garlic powder and salt.  Always turns out great!

this is a great base recipe! I did as another reviewer suggested and made it using taco seasoning I instead of the cumin and garlic salt...OMG that was good. I highly recommend it. as others said - don't worry about the rice puffing up... just fry it in the oil for a bit and then simmer it down in the chicken broth - it will fluff up then.

Grew up in SoCal, going to Sombrero's and eating shrimp burritos.  Live on the East Coast where they don't know what Mexican is.  This recipe makes a proper shrimp burrito.   It's a real taste of home.

This is very good.  I usually make packaged Mexican Rice, but this is so much better.  I used Taco Seasoning I instead of the cumin and salt.  I served this with Salsa Chicken from this site and it made a fantastic meal.

Easy to make.  Next time I will add some more seasoning, just a little too bland for Mexican!

This is as good as is found in most restaurants; however, there is still something missing.  Instead of the salt and cumin, I substituted an equal amount of Taco Seasoning I from this site.   In the end I needed more salt and black pepper.  This is definitely a keeper, but I'm not finished tinkering.

Just a nice simple tasty rice dish which replicates those you find in the restaurants. I have no relevant heritage to draw on, but I really enjoy this as an accompaniment to my Mexican styled meals and in my burritos! Highly recommended. PS. I've been pretty lazy and skipped the onion inclusion - still really tasty and that much simpler:)

It's a bit salty.  I cooked 1.5 cups of rice and used the 1 tsp garlic salt that was part of the original recipe for 1 cup of rice.  It was still a little salty

Excellent rice dish!  I followed the instructions and it came out delicious!  I did add a bit more cumin than instructed since I love the taste of it.  I served this dish with the 'oven fried chicken III', a side-dish of yellow, orange and red peppers marinated in an Asian sauce and with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc as suggested!  It turned out to be a great meal.

I love this dish because of its easiness. I made a few minor changes based on the reviews. (1) I was worried about the onions not being cooked enough and I was worried about burning the rice so I partially cooked the onions first then added the rice. I also added a bit more onions. (2) I used onion and garlic flavored tomato sauce for added flavor (3) Along with the cumin, I added onion powder, accent, adobo, cayenne pepper, and season all. It ended up being a great side dish and would probably be amazing for burritos.

UPDATE: I realized the first time I made this I accidentally used Swanson's low sodium chicken stock instead of the broth. The 2nd time I used the broth, but I liked the stock better. Also I've added this rice to the Delicious Black Bean Burritos recipe on this site and it was A+!

Good rice that I'd make again.  I substituted the seasoning for Taco Seasoning I on this site and it came out better that way than the original seasoning blend.  Subtle difference but enough to take the rice from ok and good.

I was so happy to find this recipe! I LOVED how it turned out and my boyfriend enjoyed it as well.  I've made it a couple time and never make it quite the same each time.  I always add 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne pepper because we like things spicy and helps to give a bit more flavor to the rice.  I also add some fresh minced garlic, a little black pepper as well and double the cumin.  I've also added diced green peppers and added some cubed chicken at the end to make this its own meal rather than a side dish.

Love it, followed it exactly and it's mild and tender, I did saute sliced onion and also green pepper first then added the rice.  Next time I'll try using taco seasoning in place of the garlic salt.

This is the recipe I go to all the time now for Mexican rice. I do use the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe for the spices and add a little more just to spice it up. I also add diced onions.

I don't necessarily want to give this recipe only 2 stars because I have a feeling I did something wrong... but the recipe did not turn out great. The rice was not cooked well and I followed the directions exactly, no substitutions or anything. I will try it again sometime and hopefully it will turn out better.

This recipe was so simple and good. I have always wanted to know how they make the rice served in restaurants....well this is just like it. The only difference I did was reduce the oil to 2 tbspns to save a few calories. I don't need to ever buy another box of packaged mexican rice again!

This was so good! Exactly what I was looking for.  Instead of garlic salt, I used 1/2 tsp salt and two cloves fresh garlic (pressed). I also added 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp paprika. But I'm sure it still would've tasted great without my changes since I really didn't change much. I will definitely make this again! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I thought it was great and I'd definitely make it again!  I never made Mexican Rice before and didn't realize how easy it was, and I liked that it wasn't salty, as so many packaged rice mixes are.  I served it with some chipotle chicken enchilladas.

It is hard to rate a recipe when you end up changing it.  I was concerned about the comments that it needed more flavor so I souped it up.  when I was sauteing the onions, I also sauteed a 1/2 a cup of dived yellow peppers.  Once they were soft I added one TBS of tomato paste.  I used 1 tsp of cumin, 1/2 of chili powder and 1 tsp of taco seasoning (I make my own).  Then added the rice to cover it.  I used vegetable broth instead of water.  I needed more then 1 1/2 c broth, I used 2 1/2 cups.  I also added a third of a cup of chopped tomatoes with their juice instead of the 3 oz chopped tomatoes.  We all loved it.  I will make it this way again.  I may add some peas or black beans at the end next time.

this recipe is fool proof, i didnt have any chicken broth or boullion, nor did i have tomato sauce. so i used water, added one ramon beef broth packet and chopped up some tomatoes from my garden- i also added a diced green bell pepper. even with only half of the ingredients this turned out amazing. I did end up adding some taco seasoning and  a lot of garlic salt since i didn't have the salt from the chicken broth. I have already ate a plate ful even though i made it for dinner in about 2 hours

This was the first time I have successfully cooked rice on the stove (i have a rice cooker!). I followed the cooking directions, I used medium high heat to puff the rice. I used olive oil. I also threw in a clove of minced garlic with the onion. Instead of garlic salt, I used a 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili powder, and  1/2 tsp of paprika. It tastes great!!! Will definitely make again.

Great recipe with a couple of changes.  I used homemade taco seasoning in place of the spices. Used butter instead of oil. I also highly recommend after the saute step that you put the rice and all the other things in a rice cooker...I didn't do this and mine burned on the bottom...next time I will definitely make in the rice cooker!

My hubby from Texas thinks this is as good as his mom's - she is from Mexico.  Easy to prepare, and very very good.  Portion is large but should not go to waste! I find if I have too much tomato sauce leftover, freezing it for the next time I make this rice works well. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Simple and delicious. I used Mexican-style hot tomato sauce for a little more kick and skipped the onions. Very tasty. Thank you :)

Like out of a good Mexican restaurant.  This is easy and makes a great accompaniment to just about any main dish.  I like to serve it with Cilantro-Lime Chicken.

I make this often. There's a lot of flavor and the rice comes out perfect each time.  Try it with the One Pot Pinto Beans on this site.

This was excellent- my family raved about it! I usually use a packet of rice with seasoning mix- but I am trying really hard to cut out the 'prepared' foods in our life. So I made this. Definitely a keeper!!

I added a little Taco seasoning to it (another recipe that some suggested) & some Jane's krazy mixed-up salt.  I also sauteed the onions first.

Awesone texture, could use a little more flavor, though I did not add any tomato sauce mabey that was what would have made the difference.

This was very easy to make!  I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and sauteed the rice until golden and added the onion and spices instead of worrying about whether the rice was puffed or not.  The liquid evaporated much quicker than I anticipated, so I added extra liquid.  It all does work out in the end!

This was super easy and delicious.  I didn't have long grain rice on hand, so I used the Bulk Short Grain rice we have.  I cooked it in our rice cooker and then threw in the tomato sauce (used left over spaghetti sauce), taco seasoning (we didn't have just cumin), only 1/4 c. broth and the cooked rice together in a skillet; it was delicious!  This will be a favorite pick for fast, easy and delicious recipes at our household.

We really loved this dish! I didn't have any cumin on hand, so I just used taco seasoning, as suggested by another reviewer. I used 1 1/2 tsp., but I think next time I'll use a little more. I omitted the garlic salt and just used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and no salt b/c of the taco seasoning. I made this to go with tacos, but I think it would be great w/ chicken as well. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

Wow! This rice was absolutely delicious! I made it to go into some burritos, and I ended up just eating it by itself in the end. I sauteed the uncooked rice, onions, and spices in the pan until the onions were tender. Then, I threw everything into my rice cooker along with the tomato sauce and chicken stock. I only used 1 3/4 cups of stock and thought it was the perfect amount. The rice came out very tender but not mushy. Thanks so much for this recipe!

The recipe calls for to much liquid and should be revised to 2 cups total including the broth and tomato sauce.. When I followed the directions it came out extremely mushy. The basic flavor was great though.

I sauted my onions first, then added the rice, constanly stirring.  I added fresh chopped garlic after that for less than a minute to let the aroma come out.  From there I continued with the recipe, using sea salt instead of garlic salt to taste.  It turned out quite well.  I have another rice recipe that I prefer that uses salsa, but this was a good backup.  I will turn to it again when I'm out of salsa but have tomato sauce on hand.

Mmm! So good! I even messed up the recipe -- I used half of the oil with the intention to make half of the recipe but ended up using the whole cup of rice...so I continued with what I had and it was still very great! I will use this recipe again.

My kids liked the rice but my husband and I found it a little plain.  My husband complained that it tasted salty (I used reduced sodium chicken broth).

i made this exactly like the recipe said. i served this with the chicken enchilada casserole. the casserole is awesome! the rice flavor was boring and bland. my customers were not to happy at all. i will always try the recipes at home first, before i try them at my restaurant for now on! thank you anyways.

This is a fantastic recipe! I use whenever I make any Mexican food. It is the best recipe I've found for rice that is like the kind we know and love in the Mexican restaurants. Even picky eaters love it!!!!

This was absolutely perfect mexican rice.  It is not supposed to be spicey but you can add some heat if that is what you desire.  I served this with the Pablano Chile Enchiladas a la Gringa from this site.  Great meal. ****  1/12/15, I've made this about 20 times now and it's still the most authentic mexican rice I've ever made.  We love it.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This was a really good recipe.  I bought taco seasoning beforehand b/c some reviewers suggested it.  Then, I totally forgot to add it and I didn't have any cumin and somehow this recipe was still good.  It gets 5 stars alone for being fail-proof.  With many reviews saying this recipe is a little bland, I was quite satisfied and I am all about seasonings.  I can't wait to make it again and use the taco seasoning.  I also ended up with it kind of soupy but, I'm sure that was something I did.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I read reviews that this could be bland, but this rice is great! I'm obsessed with strong flavors and this met the requirement. When I think about the rice I get at Mexican restaurants, it's actually pretty plain, but I mix it with beans and it's perfect. Well this rice is good enough on it's own, and wonderfully simple. Before the entire pot came to a boil, I tossed in a few shakes of oregano and cayenne. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I highly recommend this. Also, just a note, I understand we're supposed to rate on the actual recipe, but there's no excuse for bland food when it comes from your own kitchen. Ya gotta love seasonings! :) Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is excellent for standard restaurant-style Mexican rice. I come from Southern California and recently moved to the Pacific NW and have had trouble finding rice the way I'm used to it.  This recipe was just the ticket! The only changes I made are I sauteed the onions with the rice and I used butter instead of oil (one stick for 2 cups of rice).

great recipe-tastes just like mexican restaurant. dont worry about the rice puffing, brown it and throughout the cooking process, it all works out.  one suggestion--- use a little less water- it's hard to dry it out to get it fluffy with the amount of water the recipe calls for. try it!

My family really liked this! I've been searching for a recipe that is close to the Mexican rice we order at our local Mexican restaurant and this is the best I've found. I did need to add a little salt. Great side dish!

Great standby recipe to get away from buying the convenience packaged option.    Had everything on had to make.  Next time I will reduce the garlic salt as this was very salty.

YAY!! I have finally found the recipe I've been looking for.  No more Mexican flavored Rice-A-Roni (sorry kido).  This was so easy, cheap, and DELICIOUS!  I added more cumin, i cant get enough of that spice, and used chicken bullion instead of broth (cheaper).  Its a tad too salty so next time i will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I doubled it and Im so glad i did.  This is going to make an excellent burrito filler for later this week.

This is really good!  I've made it twice, and the second time I added minced garlic, paprika, onion powder, chives, parsley, a little extra cumin- and I'm probably leaving some others out!  Basically- anything that sounded good!  The reason for four stars is that we felt it needed more seasoning!  But- this is a WONDERFUL recipe to build from- love it!

I had to keep adding for this to taste good.  It was just too bland.  I added garlic powder, taco seasoning, cilantro and lemon juice. Will try other recipes in the future.

The BEST! I have tried many home recipes for mexican rice and this is by far the best! It's a little dry just like the Mexican Restaurant. I made it with no changes to the recipe.

This is a delicious rice recipe.   Something different than the usual fried rice type of side dish.   It is also very versatile as I used a seasoned pizza sauce in place of the tomato sauce and it was still great!

I adjusted the ingredients to make the recipe for 10 people for an "Ocho de Mayo" party we had (the 5th was on a Tuesday!).  Everyone LOVED the rice.  The only change I made was used half white rice, half brown rice.  The only reason I did that was becuase it's all I had on hand.  Turned out awesome.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

I used taco seasoning instead of cumin, 1/3 less oil and cooked onions in oil before adding rice! Much better and flavorful the next day! Yummy! My 3 year old son wanted just the rice the next dy for lunch! Thanks!

Thanks so much for this recipe,,,, Cinco de mayo wouldn't have been the same without it!!  All I added was some chiles, habaneros, and Jalepenos for a bit more kick and it was the hit of the party!!

Tasty...reminds me of the rice in Mexican restaurants. In the past I'd added a can of diced mexican style tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, minced garlic, minced onion or onion powder, chicken broth for the rest of the liquid and put it in the microwave for about 10 minutes. Think I'll mix it up...sometimes authentic, sometimes my old standby. It's nice to have an authentic recipe to use...thank you! :)

This was really good. Served it as a side dish with enchiladas. I threw in about a half a cup of frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, limas and green beans) toward the end of cooking.

I loved this rice!!!  I gotta tell ya that we had some left over and I liked it even better the next day.  It seemed like the flavor was more absorbed in the rice or something.  Anyway, it was quite tasty!

Pretty delicious! I just needed more of all the spices, though. I also added a can of El Pato instead of some of the (veggie) broth and even some Tapatio just to spice it up. Maybe some cilantro next time at the end would do it justice as well. My boyfriend thought I made it from a box, which seems like a compliment!

Overall, this is a very good recipe. I think the cumin flavor was a little strong for me, so next time I will maybe cut back on it or omit it all together. Thanks!

This tasted fine (like other reviewers said, it won't knock your socks off).  I prefer my Mexican rice a bit drier, I might modify this with tomato paste next time, and add some jalapeno peppers.

This is awesome authentic tasting mexican rice.  The only changes I made:  used 1 cup of canned chicken broth and 1 cup broth from chicken breasts that I boiled for "Poblano Chile Enchiladas a la Gringa" from this site. (awesome by the way!).  Then instead of just throwing in salt and cumin, I used "Taco Seasoning I" from this site as well. My Mexican friends snarfed this stuff up! Yummy!!

Great recipe!  I followed it exactly as written except that I made 1 1/2 cups of rice and increased all measurements by 50%.  I would definitely make this rice again.  The whole family loved it.  I may cut back on the garlic salt a bit as it was a touch too salty for me (I made the broth with a bouillon cube, which may have contributed to the saltiness).  I think I will try it with half the amount of garlic salt but add in a touch of garlic powder to compensate for the loss of the garlic.

I thought it was okay. If there is less oil then I think it could be better. My husband loved this considering he does not like Spanish/Mexican rice. He said it was fresh tasting because it was moist and not dried out.

This is pretty good, but it seems like it's missing a little kick. I did as one reviewer suggested and added some taco seasoning, but I think maybe it would benefit from some green chiles.

This rice is perfect.  Goes great with any Mexican meal, and has just the right amount of flavor.  I think it is pretty fool-proof because I've never understood the browning and puffing and it always turns out awesome.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Excellent.  I did not have an onion or tomato sauce so I substituted 1/2 cup of salsa.  I also used 1 can of low sodium chicken broth (14.5 oz) which is just under the recommended 2 cups, but it came out perfect. It was a little bit salty so I will probably cut back on the garlic salt next time.  Cooked on low for 25 minutes without lifting the top and it was cooked perfectly.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe it was good but not as great as I was expecting from the amount of reviews. I didn't like the method for cooking the rice, to me it seemed like a waste of time but I did it anyways and as I thought it was. The flavour was good but not as strong as I would have liked.

Good rice!  Used 4 tablespoons veg oil and 2 cups uncooked rice.  Added 2 cups of chicken stock, 1 cup enchilada sauce (Trader Joe's is awesome!), 1 teaspoon cumin, and 2 tsp. crushed garlic.

Very good. Did not have tomato sauce on hand so added canned diced tomatoes. Also added cilantro and minced garlic to liven it up a bit. Very tasty.

The rice was good, but not great. I guess I was wanting something more flavorful. But as a side, or put in a mexi dish this rice would work. It was easy to make. My boyfriend liked it, but being from California I love authentic mexican rice.

I loved this rice. I made it a lot more simpler though. I add all the ingredient in a large pot (except the rice). I heated that up to cook the onions a little. Then i brought it to a boil and then add 2 1/2 cups minute rice. With minute rice it turns out faster and great every time. :)

We love this recipe in our house-it tastes just like our favorite local Mexican restaurant. I do use  brown rice to make it healthier so it takes almost twice as long to cook-but it is still really yummy! I also usually double the recipe and have some leftover.

Since I didn't have the cumin, I used 2 garlic cloves. The end result was that the rice was overpowering. I think it would be best to use either 1 garlic clove or perhaps just the cumin. This recipe has potential, and I will be using it again tonight. Hopefully it turns out...well, not as overpowering.

WOW!  I have looked all over the place for a good mexican rice recipe and this is it.  My daughter got seconds.  I put the oil in the bottom of a pot and sauteed the onion and a little bit of green pepper.  I then added the rice and browned and then added the spices.  This was absolutely delicious and mine came out perfect.  I must say that I normally have trouble with a few pieces being hard, but there were no hard pieces.  I let the ingredients all boil for about three minutes and then put the lid on.  I stirred it with nine minutes left of cooking.  FAB!!

Okay.  I'm trying with brown rice tonight.  I'll let you know!

Very delicious recipe!! I would add just a tad more liquid as it turned out on the dry side. But other than that, great recipe!

This was a GREAT recipe. Reminded me of growing up, though I definitely added more garlic.

i thought this was delicious. i used salsa in place of the tomato sauce because that's what i had. i might add some chopped mild green chiles next time. much better than the boxed mixes.

This is the easiest and best mexican rice recipe I've found.  I don't like onions so I did leave those out.  I made this rice for using in enchiladas that I recently made and my family loved it, plus the leftovers are great too.  Tastes just like the rice from our favorite mexican restaurant.

Tasty, but it came out too wet. used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. used veggie stock instead of chicken. skipped the garlic salt.

Great Mexican rice recipe. I used jalapeno salsa intead of tomato sauce for some added kick and sauteed my onions before adding to the chicken mixture. Really good!

It was really good, instead of regular tomato sauce I used one from the Mexican section called El Pato (Mexican hot style)and it was spicy and delicious, I just used the whole can 7 3/4 ounces, I thought it was 4 ounces, guess I should have worn my reading glasses but it was still really good. It was definately spicy which I like but if your family doesn't just use regular tomato sauce. I will make this again especially with a great soup I recently had in Dallas. Put rice in a bowl, add shredded chicken some tortilla chips, pico de gallo, Monterey Jack cheese, a few slices of avacado and top off with peppery chicken broth and some cilantro, yummmm, this rice is perfect for this.

Perfect, simple and delicious!  I didn't have to make one modification (and usually I tweak recipes slightly).  I served this with delicious chicken enchiladas.  This is so easy to make and has wonderful results.

very goood,  folled the recipie except for the tomato sauce,  Had a jar of chunky Ragu, the garden one in the fridge and used that instead.  Not enough cumin for my families spicy taste, but with some adjustment will use this base recipie again.

Very fast prep and effortless to cook. I made the lime fish tacos with it, and the combo was great and coordinated well with the prep of the ingredients. I added a little extra onion and hot sauce to give a little extra zing. A crowd pleaser for kids too!

Just what I wanted! Served with enchiladas and refried beans to a group of 20, and everyone thought it was great.  I did add a some cayenne pepper just to give it a little kick.

This was really bland and not so good.  I added extra garlic, onion, salt and pepper, and cumin after the original recipe - it was a very "wet" rice and like the mexican rice at gross mexican restaurants - not a fan!  But then again, I feel half mexican!

Fantastic! I made this rice to go with a mexican feast of enchiladas and tacos, which were superb, but this was MY favorite part of the meal! It tastes JUST like the rice they serve at my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant. Delicious. My search for the perfect Mexican rice is over.

Excellent recipe.  Today I prepared this recipe for the second time.  The rice was tasty and airy.  I use the pressure cooker to make rice with excellent results.  Total cooking time in the pressure cooker is about five minutes from the moment the rocker starts rocking. The pressure cooker saves me time and preserves many food nutrients.

I didn't care for this rice really. My husband wasn't a fan of it either. I used minute rice out of the bag. The rice was not cooking so I messed up by adding water. Perhaps that's what made it taste bland. Either way I think I'll just leave the rice to the restaurants or opt for a box mix.

Fantastic.  I thought that I was eating from a restaurant.  I did alter a bit.  I sauteed the onions and bell pepers in the oil and then remove them once they were tender.  I then put in the rice and continued the recipie as usual except that I did not have cumin so I used a jerk seasoning which had cumin in there.

This was just ok for us.  It's a simple recipe with common ingredients I always have on hand.  I think it might be better with some dice green chiles added to it.  I'll probably try it again sometime, but with some modifications.

Even my picky-eater kids loved this one!  I should have doubled the recipe!  The only substitution I made was using blending a can of Mexican-style canned tomatoes in leiu of the tomatoe sauce.  I measured out the amount called for the in the recipe.  It turned out great!  I will definitely keep this one!

This was rather bland.  I expected stronger flavours.  I added some chili powder and that helped a little.  The saving grace was spooning sauce from our Mexican Chicken recipe over it.

My rice never puffed during the browning phase but it ended up great.  My husband, who loves Rice-a-Roni's Spanish rice said this was better.  I thought it was just as easy as making Rice-a-Roni, and probably has a lot less sodium.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I magic bulleted a can of whole tomatoes, it worked great,  I'm sure salsa could also be used.  This rice looked, smelt, and tasted great.  I will make it often.

I used brown rice with this - personal preference - so it took about 30 minutes longer for the rice to cook.  Delicious.

I made this exactly as written and in my opinion it is too salty and greasy.  It has potential though because the flavor is good, so I will probably try to make it again with half the oil and garlic salt next time.

This is a pretty traditional Mexican rice recipe, except for the cumin, having grown up in Mexico, I never knew anyone or any place that would add cumin to rice or nearly to any real Mexican dish, this is a Tex-Mex flavor. Real garlic is also used instead of the garlic salt or powdered one.

With a couple of changes, this is the rice recipe we always use when having Mexican. Instead of using a fresh tomato, I use a can of tomatoes with green chilis, drained. I like the extra flavor from the chilis. Instead of the bouillon cube, I use a teaspoon of chicken soup base. All in all, very tasty.

This was a good rice. I did use taco seasoning as many did and next time I think I will try as the recipe reflected with the cumin and garlic salt, lacked a little flavor. I also only had medium grain rice so I used a 1/4 cup less water.

This is so easy and so delicous.  I also made the recipe called Tortilla Chicken Vegetable Soup (omitted the white rice in the soup recipe) and added this Mexican Rice II to the soup as we ate it.  I served it on the side with some cheese quesedillas.  What a feast!  Thank you for sharing!

This was soooo good, I'm going to be using it for Thanksgiving!  (No turkey, red meat only for this Latin family).  I used "Taco seasoning I" from this website as someone else suggested *THANK U SOO MUCH** in place of the Cumin and garlic salt, and it was deeeelicious!

Ok. this was the first thing ive made from this site. I followed the recipe perfectly. im not an idiot in the kitchen and it didnt come out at all. it had little to no flavor. some of my rice was crunchy and some wasnt. it was really odd. it wasnt HORRIBLE but i wouldnt make it again. it was probably just something i did wrong. :)

I really liked this. It reminds me of the rice my grams made for me when I was little. Mine did come out a little mushy, but I think I just cover cooked it a little. I halved the receipe, but I followed it exactly. Loved it. This is a keeper in my recipe box!!!

Beautiful and easy.  Like others my rice didn't plump until it was ready to eat.  Added frozen peas for colour and flavour.  Made 4 x original quantity in 2 batches to feed 15, nearly all of it went!

I have to say that this is the closest to Mexican rice as I have come. I have been trying for the last six months to find a recipes that even comes close and this one is it! I didn't use as much broth though, 3 cups instead of 4

This recipe was good. I did take the advice from others and saute the onions before adding the rice. I didn't wait for my rice to puff. I also made the Taco SeasoningI recipe and seasoned with that.  Great flavor!!  We loved it.  I served with Trader Joe's Chicken Enchiladas and their Cuban black beans.  Awesome and cheap dinner!!  Thanks.

This was fantastic.  I made it with brown rice and it was wonderful.  It did take longer to cook than I expected, but the flavor was amazing.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Yes, this is authentic.  I've been making spanish rice for more than 20 years and this is how it is done.  I would only suggest that you cut the liquid down to 1 3/4 cup if you are using tomato sauce.  
Also, for a once skillet dinner, you can arrange chicken pieces, or diced pork chops over rice after you add the liquid.  Do not open the pan until 20 minutes have passed.  Serve with fresh or refried beans and hot tortillas.  mmmmmm.....

This turned out excellent! I didn't measure anything (I rarely do) and I used mexican hot tomato sauce instead of regular. Everyone loved it! I've made this several times and will continue to make.

This came out much like the rice one would get at a Mexican restaurant.  I used chopped tomatoes and a dash of ketchup as I did not have tomato sauce.

Really wonderful. I used diced tomatoes, made my rice in the rice cooker (with just one of the chicken broths), and added peas for some fun color. LOVE it. So easy and will make it again.

This was definatley the best spanish rice i have made. I have been taught many times and the consistancy never comes out right, because im never taught in measurments but what looks about right. So sometimes theres too much sauce or not enough. Just make sure you golden all the rice like the directions say, it should take a good five minutes, dont skip this step. I will definatley make this one again. I cant say enough about how yum this rice is!!

Wow, what a perfect recipe! I love mexican/spanish rice and living in Southern California I am spoiled by eating good rice. I attempted to make this once or twice before and it always came out tasting horrible. I decided to try one more time and the pictures submitted made it this recipe look so delicious and it is! My husband used my onion up yesterday, so I had to settle for onion and garlic powder, otherwise I followed the recipe completely.

This is really good rice. The first time I tried to make this, I used a suggestion from another viewer and used the taco seasoning from this site. I did not like it--hubby did. 
Tonight, I made as written and threw in some diced green chilies I needed to use up and I liked this sooooooo much better! Thanks for a really good, easy Mexican rice recipe. I will use this often since we do Mexican usually once a week.

Love this recipe.  I add a little more garlic and 1/2 tomato sauce, 1/2 El Pato(which is a spicier tomato sauce)  It gives it a little kick.

I was looking for something to serve with tortillas with a mashed bean filling, and this was just perfect.  It has just enough flavor and not too much.  I didn't have onions or garlic salt, so I put half a teaspoon of regular salt and 1 clove of garlic, chopped into tiny bits.  I also added a few shots of tabasco sauce - my secret ingredient in all Mexican foods.  It gave just a bit of zing and everyone loved this rice.  Next time I'll have fun fooling around with it - I'd love to try it with curry for a more Indian flavor.  Thanks!

This is a great, easy and cheap recipe for Mexican rice.  My kids were surprised to find that they liked it even better than the rice at our favorite Mexican restaurant!

Simple and yummy!  My 4 yo grandson still thinks I'm teasing when I told him Grammy cooked this rice.  He thinks I bought it at our favorite mexican restaurant, brought it home and put it in a pan to make everyone think I cooked it!  I'll take that as a compliment.  :-)

This was a great recipe.  I added a little chili powder and red pepper which gave it a really nice taste.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Next time I think I will try adding some freshly minced garlic.  Overall this is the best Mexican rice recipe I've tried.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. I skip the onions, and just before I put the lid on it to simmer, I toss in about 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots (just like my Mexican Father in law does). It's wonderful!

This was really easy, mine browned fine. Needed maybe one other spice, not sure what, but it was good as is. Fresh chopped tom. and shredded lettuce made it excellent.

This is the Mexican rice recipe I had been looking for :) My friends mother used to make almost the exact same rice. I used to love the smell of the rice sauteing in the oil.
I use minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt, and a lil' extra sweet onions, and a lil' extra ground cumin. I usually use only 1/4 c. tomato sauce, also.
My kids love this rice and it is so easy and goes well with all Mexican dishes.
Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to way to make rice. I used the Taco Seasoning mix from these site instead of the other seasonings and used a can of diced tomatoes with juice since I was out of tomatoe sauce.  Family liked it. Update...made again and this time used Knorr Caldo de Tomatte con Sabor de Pollo instead of tomato sauce and chicken stock. Left out the salt and added minced garlic....delicious!

I love this rice! Where we live there are so many Mexican restraurants-so I've had a lot of different rice.I usually brown the onion with the rice-then transfer to a rice cooker.I use spicy, Mexican tomatoe sauce; extra cumin & 
good quaility chicken broth paste.

I couldn't find my can opener, so I used salsa instead of tomato sauce.  It was a lot better than it was when I made it with tomato sauce.  Delicious!

Super yummy when served w/ Southwestern Eggrolls.  Also had issues with "puffing" but it didn't affect the outcome of the taste.  Highly recommend.

Didn't turn out well for me.  The rice never puffed and the end result was mushy rice.  Probably becuase I cooked it to long waiting for it to puff.  I ate some, husband took 1 bite and threw the rest out.

This is a great, EASY recipe! It's become a weekly staple at our house and everyone LOVES it! Whenever we have guests over and we make this, they all rave that it's the best rice they've ever had. I've made this so many times that I've got the recipe memorized. Don't worry too much about the "browning and puffing" of the rice. Mine mainly browns and it comes out great every time!

I followed the recipe as is the first time.  I had no problem getting my rice to puff or brown.  The texture was great but needs a little more flavor.  The next time I will double the spices. I did use garlic powder since I am on a low salt diet.

Tried this last night with our pork fajitas!  It was great.  My husband lived in Chile and Venezula for 6 years and has been craving spanish/mexican rice!  He was hesitant at first when he saw the recipe but after it was finished he wanted to make more again today!  The only change we made was using Chuncky salsa instead of tomato sauce because that's all we had on hand.  Next time we will probably put in a little cilantro.

This recipe is perfect and so close to the restaurant style! I didn't have garlic salt so I added a large clove of minced garlic along with the onion. Otherwise followed exactly. I also doubled the recipe and used a large skillet to cook in and it was excellent! Thank you! This will be a keeper!

I didn't brown anything. I just threw it all into the rice cooker and it tasted great. So far I've made it twice and decided to add 1/2 cup extra liquid to make it perfect. Thanks.

This rice was so yummy, Thought I had Cumin but I was all out and had no time to run to the store, Then read a review on here about how someones taco seasoning had cumin in it, I didn't have taco seasoning but i did have Chili seasoning, i put just as much as the cumin called for and it turned out great! My kids and Husband loved it, and my daughter is one picky eater, but she was was asking for seconds!

We liked this rice much more than any of that store bought stuff.  We have not been able to find anything that tastes halfway decent.  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is that my liquid did not completely evaporate and it left the rice kinda mushy...I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added some garlic as I was browning the rice.  Next time I will add less  broth. Served in Tacos made w/ the Taco Seasoning I as suggested by another reviewer.  Tasted fantastic together. 

I have since made this again to use in burritos and I reduced the amount of liquid, took off the lid once the rice was no longer hard and let the rest of the liquid evaporate.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (we liked this much better) and upped the broth  to about 3/4 of a cup.  The rice was great and it tasted even better the second day.But, since I had to make the changes I still can only give it 4 stars....It really tastes authentic w/ the changes and I have made this about once a week.  Used to live in Los Angeles and moved to Colorado...have not been able to find anything, even in restaurants that tastes half as good.  Our rule is "Never Mexican restaurants while in Colorado"

I have looked forever for a recipe that produces restaurant style rice and now I've found it!  This recipe is delicious.  I used the recipe calculator and changed it to serve 12 people and it came out perfect.  I understand the importance of letting the rice get puffy!  Looking for the perfect rice recipe?  You just found it!!

This rice turned out great.  It tasted just like our local Mexican restaurant!  I will definitely be making this again.  I didn’t realise that I would need to stir the rice even after the liquid had been added and I had a bit of it stick to the pan so next time I will stay and stir it constantly!

This is great rice.  We usually add a little garlic and I always add the rice and cumin toward the end. I think the rice is a little bland without more salt and cumin.

This is great and so easy to make!! SO, now I know why the rice in Mexican restaurants has a certain kind of texture.. it's the puffing prior to boiling it... so don't miss this step!.. I paired it with Chicken Enchiladas II also found in this site... a big Ole!!!

I liked this. I had to use tomato paste because I had no tomato sauce and it still came out pretty good. I used it in my bean burritos! The next day after zapping them in the microwave, they tasted even better!

Soooooo good!
I didnt have tomato sauce or white onions, so used 3/4 c. crushed tomatoes and 5 sliced green onions - and I threw in a half of a leftover tomato, diced. It was amazingly easy to make, and a nice change from plain white rice...

yummmm!!! i followed the recipe exactly except for decreasing the chicken broth by 1\2 cup and cooking it in a rice cooker.  this is addictive!  next time i will add some green bell peppers for extra flavor.

This is my family's favorite Mexican Rice.  I accidentally burned the rice once while I was browning it...that gave it such a wonderful smoky flavor that I intentionally do it now (though it does make a bit of mess on the pan).  The quality of chicken broth affects the flavor.  I sometimes toss in a handful of frozen corn at the end.  Wonderful recipe!!

It tasted similiar to what we have had in Mexican resturaunts, but was not as light and fluffy.  It was "heavy" and stuck to the spoon.  This happens alot to my rice dishes.  Any suggestions?  Thanks for the recipe.  I will give it another try.

used thai red rice instead of the long grain -- therefore was a little crunchier but had lots of flavor and healthier too!

I made this tonight.  The only thing I changed was to add a little bit of mixed vegetables because that is how they serve it my favorite Mexican restaurants.  This is excellent!  I've finally found a GOOD recipe for rice!  I actually quadrupled the recipe so I'll always have some around (I froze it).  I serve it with a little Monterey Jack cheese and it is great!

I am not even a fan of this rice when we go out, but I needed a quick side.  I took the advice of others and used the rice cooker after browning.  It turned out delicious, and it was a no-brainer. Got rave reviews from all. Thanks

Like some viewers I couldn't get my rice done. Even when I cooked it longer, it was still chewy.  A little on the salty side for me and I love salt.  I thought it was a very easy recipe to follow, it just didn't work out for me.  It was probably my fault.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good but I wouldn't say it was a favorite of mine. I also think instead of garlic salt I would use garlic powder as I found it pretty salty. Overall it was good and I would make it again with a few changes next time.

A good start. I replaced the tomato sauce with mild salsa, and thought that gave it the slightly spicy taste I was looking for.  With this modification, I'd definitely make it again.

I don't know what I did right but this came out PERFECT and I can never get rice to cook up fluffy and PERFECT. I used medium heat I didn't let the rice get to brown stirred it often and poured all the stuff in crossed my fingers and PERFECT rice happened, THANK YOU for this great recipe.

Wonderful....We really liked this.  I did change a few things since I did not have all the ingredients.  I used brown rice...which took much longer to cook.  I used canola oil...and added a clove of garlic to the browning rice step.

This smells great and is very tasty. Visually it could be more appealing but that's just a personal preference.  I think next time I'll add in 1/4c corn and a little bit of diced jalapeno for some added kick.  Still awesome as is though.

I had to give this recipe 3 stars because of the instructions. I tried to 'puff' the rice as described, and it was a mistake (I should have listened to the other reviews that said not to). The rice didn't puff, and my attempt must have ruined it, because after 45 minutes of cooking, the liquid was still not completely absorbed, and the rice was crunchy and mealy in texture. I will try this recipe again, but without trying to puff the rice. It smelled good - hope it works next time... had to throw it all out ;-(

I'm really pleased with this recipe. I LOVE mexican rice and order it whenever we go out...I couldnt be happier to have found a recipe where I can make my own at home. It was way easier than I thought it would be and my whole house smelled so good. Instead of the can of tomato sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and also added about 1/4 cup of salsa. I've made this recipe twice now and the ssecond time I realized I was out of canned chicken broth once I had started but I substituted with most of a chicken Ramen seasoning packet and one cup of water. I will definelty be making this regularly.

Pretty good stuff- realized after I'd started cooking it that I was out of canned chicken broth, so I substituted a Ramen packet and a couple of bullion cubes, which gave it a pretty good flavor.

This was pretty good, tastes very similar to my Mexican mother in law's rice, I used chicken broth and water because I didn't have enough chicken broth, next time I will use all broth.

Wow!!! Made this last night and followed recipe as is.  This was fantastic.  If you like your mexican rice spicy, this may not be for yoy.  This had great flavor for adults (and would accompany/balance out a spicier dish) yet was great for the kids who don't like any "kick" to their food at all.  Reminded me of a restaurant spanish rice.  Best of all, no "box" spanish rice flavor!!!  Will now make every time!!! Thank You for this great recipe!  I'm now 6 for 6 on allrecipe.com!

A really tasty recipe. I use low sodium chicken broth, and fresh garlic to make a very savory recipe that even my picky 10 year old eats. I serve it with chicken nachos using Taco Seasoning II from this site.

I increased this recipe to 12 servings for a party. That was way too much, 8 would have been plenty but no complaints because I have leftovers! I actually asked my husband and brother to make this recipe for me because I was busy getting things ready, anyway, they used brown rice instead of white, Ahh! But it still turned out delicious, it just had to simmer for 45 minutes instead of 20.

I never tried to make Mexican rice before...and I am glad I did. I had to make some modifications based on what I had on hand...I usually keep steamed rice in the frig. so I warmed up the oil then added 2 cups of cooked rice, after it warmed up and separated I sprinkled taco seasoning over the rice and added about a 1/2 cup of salsa and a smidge of red taco sauce...all to taste. that was it! And my husband said my home-cooked Mexican food really improved with this recipe.

Omigosh!!!  This is incredible!  I followed one reviewer's advice and used 1 pint of homecanned tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce...added 1/2 jalapeno (cause we like it spicy) and this has to be the best rice we've ever had!  What flavor!!!

I wasn't sure how long to cook the rice,so I let it cook in the preheated oil while I chopped the onion. By then,the rice started to turn a golden color. It took another 5 minutes to cook the onions until tender. The result was perfection! Never tasted better Mexican rice anywhere!

the taste was great. My one mistake, I didn't let the rice puff/brown enough as a result the rice didn't soften as well as it might. I would make it again, but I would definitely take more care at the start of the recipe. Great flavor.

I make this almost every time we have Mexican cuisine.  My family loves it. The only thing I altered is that I also use about 3/4 can of drained Rotel or tomatoes and green chilies, and a drained can of corn.  yum!

This was a great base recipe to alter. I threw everything into my rice cooker along with a small can of olives (requiring me to reduce the amount of salt). Very tasty!

It was easy to follow and it had good flavor but no the "REAL Mexican Flavor"

This was pretty good.  I only had jasmine rice, which I wouldn't recommend, because it added a sweetness that countered the dish a bit.  But it was still OK.  Also, I didn't have tomato sauce and I wanted to add green chilies, so I substituted a can of rotel in.  I used chicken bouillon to make the stock and it came out nicely.  Because I boiled the water to dissolved the bouillon, the boiling time for the rice was much less and it was done much faster than the recipe stated.  I'll make this again, but with regular long grain rice.

We absolutely loved this.  I will try to reduce the saltiness next time, but otherwise it was perfect.  I'll definitely be making with our Mexican meals.

I love this rice. It tastes just like the rice my mom use to make.  I add frozen peas to it and it comes out great!! My kids really love it too.

This was great. The only change I made was to use picante sauce instead of tomato sauce only because thats what I had. The rice came out perfect and had the exact texture I look for in mexican rice. My search is now over. Thanks!

This is fantastic!  Didn't have tomato sauce so I used diced tomatos as someone suggested.  Awesome flavor.  Not spicy hot so it's great for my kids.  Can't wait to serve this to friends on Mexican night.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent!!  I wasn't sure that it would have enough flavor to it, but it turned out so good.  I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and salt (just sprinkled some in).  I will make this every time I make a Mexican dish as a side now.  Thanks for the recipe!!

For those people who are worried about the rice not "puffing", don't worry about it.  It won't change the outcome of the rice at all.  Just saute it until the grains are nice and golden.  I made this to go with dinner tonight and it was pretty good!  Nice and flavorful.  I only used 1 1/2 cups broth, I think it would have been quite wet if I had used the full amount.  I also sauted the onions a little and then added the rice.  I'm having a difficult time finding a recipe that's just like mexican rice at restaurants, but this is the closest yet!  Next time I'm going to try 1/4 cup tomato sauce (and add 1/4 cup more water, always keeping the liquid at 2 C) and less salt as we found it rather salty.  Thank you for the recipe!

LOVE this rice! My son loved it so much I had to make it the next day. The do use 1/2 the oil though. 3 Tbsp made it too greasy. I also use some adobe seasoning along with the garlic salt and cumin. It's great!!!!

Really great... Thanks for the authentic recipe.  I threw a serrano chile in, which I removed when I fluffed the rice, and I also added a small can of peas and carrots.

Could taste a bit bland but for a side dish it is very tasty and satisfactory. Easy to make and all the ingredients will usually be at hand in the cupboard.

I gave this a lower rating simply because the flavors weren't there, family thought it was a bit bland, maybe it is supposed to be like that not sure.  I will make this again simply because it does not come out of a box... maybe that is what we are used to, but I might try to spice it up a bit the next time I make it.

My wife and kids love rice.  This recipe made the grade.  They asked for it the next night.  This one will be sure to make the table on a regular basis.  I only made one change, I add El Pato Salsa Brand tomato sauce.  It kicks it up a notch.  Everyone loves it with spicier tomato sauce.

very good as advice i would rinse the rice 5 times, and then let it soak in water for 20 min.This makes it less sticky.

We love this recipe! As written, it was a nice recipe, not too spicy or bland.  After making it several times, I've increased the cumin to 1 tsp.  If I have fresh garlic, I use that & add a little kosher salt.

Very good.  I followed the recipe to a tee, except for adding some fresh minced garlic with the onion.  Had a good flavor. It's a keeper. :-)

I followed the recipe exactly and we were thrilled with the results.  Tastes just like the rice we get at all of our favorite Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix.

I'm getting to the point that I must just not care for mexican rice, guess I'm a spanish rice guy.
This is the third or fourth mexican recipe I have tried over the years. 4 stars because my partner liked it.......

Lovey recipe for Mexican rice.  For fluffy rice, I used only 1.5 cups chicken broth and used some pureed rotel for the tomatoe sauce.  So fluffy, tasty, great!

I cooked this according to the exact ingredients and directions and it came out very good.  My boyfriend told me it tasted great just like the mexican rice we often get when eating out at mexican restaurants.  I thought it was pretty good also.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

All I can say is YUM!!! I have Mexican rice in restaurants and it has always been just OK; an OK side to the meal. And I have tried the boxed Mexican rice from the store and that was boring. So we tried this and it was great! My 3 year old loved it and he has to be the pickiest eater on the planet!!! Followed the recipe exactly, except I had jasmine rice, so I used that. It never fluffed up, but still amazing.

I gave this recipe a 4 simply because I felt it was too salty.  I also cut way down on the oil and used olive instead of vegetable.  I did not really fry the rice.  I just toasted it a little bit in the oil.  I also omitted the onion since my husband will not eat anything with onion in it.  I did add some onion powder.  Other than being too salty, it was a very good recipe.  Both my boys ate it up.  I will definitely make this again.  I served it with the Lime Chicken Soft Tacos and Fat Free Refried Beans from this site.

I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 t. chili powder.  This was good,  but I wasn't thrilled with the smoky flavor the cumin imparted.  Maybe just me, but I am not used to that flavor in my Mexican rice.  I may try it without the cumin next time.

This was a great recipe.  I am not a good cook and was able to make this without any trouble at all.  I added a little more cumin than called for, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I'll never buy the packaged stuff again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty tasty Mexican rice. I used 2 tbsp of olive oil instead of 3 tbsp. to cut some fat. I also used garlic powder as opposed to garlic salt at the advice of other reviewers but now wished I had used salt, we felt it needed more salt. We ate this with black beans, corn and tomatoes over it. Very yummy. My 14 month old ate it right up.

We liked this, after checking the reviews I did add salsa, omitted the garlic salt for garlic powder and used a small dash of hot sauce.  Thanks for the post.  Very good.

this was great! i read others' reviews, which were really helpful. i added half a pound of fresh chopped mushrooms, and used green onion instead of white. enchilada sauce instead of the tomato REALLY made a difference. good stuff!

My family and I thought this was really good.  Although I had alittle problem with the rice absorbing the liquid.  I think the cooking time should be doubled.  But other than that, awesome.  Will be making again.

Great, but a little too oily.  You might want to just do 2 TBSP of oil.  I used salsa.  Thanks and God bless!

The flavor was ok - although it certainly benefitted from some garlic powder - but I needed to add way more liquid to stop the rice from drying out, and it also took closer to 50 mins to cook completely.

It was okay.  I followed it exactly, but next time I will add some chili peppers and more garlic.  Still tasty as is, especially as a bed for the Salsa Chicken!

This is the best Mexican Rice recipe I've tried.  I think the key is the cumin and tomato sauce.  This is a keeper.

I thought it tasted just like what you would get at an authentic Mexican restaurant!  I wasn't sure about how it would turn out but it was great!  I used 1 1/2 cups broth and 1/2 cup sauce.  I will be making this again!

Fantastic!  I like to mince 2-3 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and add it to the tomato sauce before adding it to the rice.  Adds some heat and a nice smoky flavor.  I also like to add 1/2 diced green bell pepper and some drained canned corn.  Excellent recipe.

I ALWAYS have had a problem making Mexican rice.  It always came out hard and undercooked.  This recipe was PERFECT!!  Not too much tomatoe taste.  It came out nice and fluffy with just the right amount of mexican flair!

This rice was okay. I'd make it again because it's really easy and complements a more spicy food, but to be honest it tasted like a rice mixture I could've bought in a box (not hot enough) although it's still all right.

I've tried and tried to make Mexican rice for years.  Never found a recipe I cared for.  This one is the best I've tasted!  My family loves this!  Super easy. Some variations I've tried that have been really good:  I used about half a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (drained) and also some green onions in place of the regular onions.  Good flavor and nice color too.

Absolutely PERFECT!!  I was born and raised in Southern Arizona and we eat Mexican food AT LEAST once a week and have been looking for an authentic recipe for some time.  I was beyond impressed with this recipe (as were my friends)!!  I am thrilled to be able to make my own rice for when we have fiestas!  I chopped the onions very fine and added 1/2 tsp chili powder.  Love it, love it, LOVE IT!  Thank you so much!

This is great, and similar to what you'd get at a lot of Tex-Mex restaurants.  I like to add a little bell pepper and jalapeno, leftover from whatever Mexican dish I'm making this with.

Wonderful side dish to a mexican meal!  The only change I made was to use green onions instead of regular onion (they're what I had on hand).  Quick and easy to make, and tastes great.

Easy and flavorful-great starter recipe. I made a few changes to suit our personal tastes. I took out the onion. Added 1/2 tsp more cumin.  Also added some chopped jalepenos and green chilie peppers.  Sauteed in some fresh chopped cilantro with the peppers during the oil cooking stage.  Added a little taco sauce at the end when fluffing.  Came out so yummy that even tho we had it 2 nights ago with a mexican dinner-I'm making it again tonight with steaks!

Great recipe. I added some red pepper flakes and a dash of Tabasco to add a little heat. Tasted very similar to our favorite mexican restaurant.

Perfectly fluffy, and perfect seasoning. I don't like Mexican Rice with whole tomatoes so this was wonderful. My husband hates 90% of Mexican Rice, but had 3rds!! Thanks!

We loved this rice, although it needed more broth than the recipe called for. I stirred in a can of Mexicorn after the rice had cooked and it was delicious.

This is an excellent base for Mexican Rice. I have been making it every time we have mexican food these days and I change it up a little every time. It's very tasty to add half a can of Rotel to it.

I thought this was very good.  Neither my husband or I like plain rice, so this was a great alternative.  I used 5 minute rice and decreased the amount of water to make up for the tomatoe sauce.

This was an excellent side dish served along with refried beans and chicken enchiladas. I added a few frozen peas to add some nutritional value and color. (Our local Mexican restaurant adds peas, that's where I got the idea.)

This rice has great flavor!  My rice came out a little crunchy but that was my fault because I used brown rice (although I did increase the cooking time accordingly) and I think I needed a little more liquid.  I added more cumin and chilli powder, onion as others had suggested.  It was a little too salty for my taste so I think next time I will use low sodium chicken broth or maybe use half garlic salt/ half garlic powder.

This is a great side dish! I needed something mellow to compliment my spicier mexican fare and this was it! I didn't have any problem with the amount of liquid added; the rice absorbed every bit of it. I added a bit more chopped onion and also stirred in some cubed cooked chicken (I had extra that needed using up).

This wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either.  I gave it four stars for the ease of making the dish.  The only changes that I made were that I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since I used chicken broth from the store and a few large pinches of dehydrated onion.  The flavor was bland so next time I'd up the garlic, salt, cumin, use real onion and maybe a handful or two of mixed veggies.  My mom who likes everything said that it was "interesting" and my fiance who doesn't like anything (especially onions and tomatoes, he's a freak!)liked it.  So who know's it's worth a try again.

Needed a side to go with enchiladas (on this site - by Vanessa Robbins).  I am NOT a spanish rice fan, but this recipe is awesome!  The only change I made was to substitute enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce.  This made it a little spicy, but perfect.  I did have to cook a little longer than stated to get the right consistency, but nothing major.  Yummy!  Thanks Sylvia!

This was pretty good. One suggestion: cut down on the rice just a little so that you only have to open one can of chicken broth (if you don't make your own). I think it would be even better because then there would be less rice and more seasonings. Overall a good recipe and I will keep working with it.

This was good and pretty easy to prepare.  I did find it a little bland, mushy and lacking texture.  It needs more garlic salt and cumin.  I also added a can of corn at the end that worked very well.  Goes well with Salsa Chicken.

I used brown rice which took forever to cook, plus I thought I had garlic salt but didn't so I just used salt...big mistake! It turned out way too salty, but overall it had a wonderful authentic flavor.  I would make this again, but correctly next time!

If you want to save all that money you've been spending at Mexican restaurants, this is THE recipe for Mexican Rice!  I tried for two years to make "Arroz Rojo". I couldn't even learn it when we lived in Mexico for a year. You can't go wrong with this one.  Thanks!
