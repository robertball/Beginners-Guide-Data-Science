IF you do this, make sure to either use it right away, or within a week if you choose to refrigerate, othetwise you are at risk of contracting botulism. Read up on this subject thoroughly.

I give 1 star simply because the poster doesnt seem to be aware of the risk.

Agree that this is the #1 way people in America get botulism.  I now simmer the garlic and it lasts longer and I'm not afraid of poisoning my friends and family.

Very simple yet delicious. I would make it again. I did change from fresh garlic to dried garlic and I used half a cup to 1 and a half cups of olive oil.

So simple and so versatile! A great way to add flavor when sauteeing meat without having to worry about burning the garlic. Makes a great salad dressing too, or add herbs to make a dipping oil. A keeper! Will definitely keep a bottle of this in my fridge at all times.

Great recipe! Love the convenience of garlic in oil!  Frankly, I don’t even measure. In a small jar I just keep adding oil and garlic as I go. I’ve recently used the garlic for pasta, shrimp scampi, cast iron grilled potatoes, and oven baked vegetables. Oil works well spread or sprayed on steaks, chicken and vegetables on the grill or in the oven. Onion and chopped garlic in medium-high oil is always the start of a great meal! To make it even more simple, I use peeled garlic
