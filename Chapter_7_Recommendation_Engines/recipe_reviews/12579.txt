This was a great pie, I used Anjou pears and substitute brown sugar for the white. Great way to use up some extras pears as well as a excellent change from apple pie.

I loved this reciepe.  As suggested in the other two reviews, I used bown sugar instead of white.  I also tossed in a handfull of raisins, the result was a pie that my whole family loved.  I will be making this pie again!

This recipe is good, very much like apple pie. To make it a bit more exciting, however, I made a crumb topping out of 1/2 c. oats, 3 TBS brown sugar, 2 TBS melted butter and a dash of salt, instead of a top layer of pie crust. It came out very good! I would make it again.

Who knew that pears would make such a lovely pie? I had ripe pears that were almost too ripe to eat and seached for a recipe so I didn't have to toss them out. I was so surprised at how tasty the pie was. The pears lend a delicate, but distinct flavor. Almost apple like, but better. Sweet, but not overpowering. This is a very nice recipe. I did add a couple tablespoons of Frangelico liqueur on top of the pears before baking. It gave the pie a slighty nutty tone. Wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe to a T and it ended up good looking and tasty. However, spices may be, in my opinion, at least doubled (1/2 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 cinnamon). I may also try to use brown sugar instead of white one. Otherwise great pie.

Delicious!  I use brown sugar instead of white and for a yummy add-on, i sprinkle grated Gruyere, Swiss or Edam cheese on top crust.  When the pie is warm, it's like heaven!

I have made this pie so much by request of friends and family that I know it by heart! It has been a taste sensation where ever I take it.  The flavor is delicate at first, with a slight tang and everyone thinks it's apple at first until they take a second or third bite, then they arn't sure.  Sooner or later they are guessing everything under the sun except pears.  Then they want the recipe.

I made this pie just the other day. I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out just okay. It seemed like it was just a weak apple pie. I would rather have the real thing. Not enough of a flavor punch. Thanks for the recipe, though. Always nice to try new things.

Delicious! But I think it needs at least 10 min at 425 to brown the crust. Like others, I used brown sugar and doubled the spices. Also used raw sugar on the crust. This site is currently showing a pie with a crumb topping-someone should fix that to sow a true top crust.

If I could rate this higher I would. This was so good! I think I ate most of it myself and only shared a little with the family! If you like apple pie but want to try something different-this is for you! The pears make it so much smoother than apple pie.Yum! Yum! Yum!

I made two of these today for a potluck tomorrow, but 6yod snitched part of the crust off one, so we got to eat it ourselves. :-)  My husband proclaimed it his absolute favorite pie ever.  Fabulous recipe!

This recipe is superb!  I was surprised that my picky husband, and unofficial apple pie critic, enjoyed this so much.  It was gone the next day.  The lemon adds a most wonderful flavor--I even added some zest for extra zip.  Yum!  Why people are so nuts about apple pie is beyond my comprehension, for we now feel that pear pie is superior in every way!  Thanks for the recipe!!

AMAZING!  This was fantastic!  
Only had 7 little pears and it did not make a very big pie but it was the best pie I have tried in a long time!

The idea of a pear pie is aswesome! Tried this for Thanksgiving and after all the talk my family was excited to try. Unfortunately, the lemon juice was TOO tart to enjoy the pie.  Great consistancy but the taste needed something to cut it.  Also, the topping came out like paste. I had to doctor it up with bread crumbs, butter and pecans to get a sprinkle effect  :O(

Very delicate taste.  Followed directions to a "T".  Never had pear pie before and it was good but I think I prefer apple pie better.  Thanks for letting me try.

I left out the lemon juice, and the pie turned out extremely dry.  Next time I will add the lemon juice, and hopefully it will make a difference.  Otherwise, it had a nice light taste, and was great warm with vanilla ice cream (which helped counter the dryness).

I made it at Christmas and it was a pie that tasted okay.  I am making it now and put a little more spice in it this time to see if I can give it a little more flavor.  Wasn't bad before, just trying to personalize it a bit.

I used 1/2 t. Cinnamon but still seemed like it was missing something.  Think it needs about 1/2 c. Brown sugar. Overall good pie and will probably make again. Maybe with a crumb topping.

I liked this, and made it exactly as written, using Bartlett pears, except that the amount of filling seemed too much, so I only put at most 6 pears' worth of the mixture in the pie. In retrospect, it "cooked down" a bit, so I was probably too conservative.
This was also, I think, the first time I'd ever tried a double-crust pie. I used store-bought refrigerated pie crusts, and technically my double-crust technique was a mess - I have a lot to learn.
This was nice, but I've made another single-crust pear pie recipe from this site a couple of times, and I think I liked that one better. I did, however, share this with several friends, and they liked it a lot.

I made 2 of these when we had some friends and family over, and everyone gave rave reviews, even though the fam is pretty critical. I made one with a lattice top crust, and one with a crumble top. Preferred the lattice top; crumble was a little too sweet. Doubled the spices and am glad I did. I used the brown sugar as so many suggested, but I thought it made things a little sticky and gooey and not as light as the white probably would have been.

I consider myself a pretty good cook, but not a very good baker.  Also, I don't like anything too sweet.  May that's why I liked this so much.  It was easy and delicious, and my husband, who DOES like sweets, loved it too.
