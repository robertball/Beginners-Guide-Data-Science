Wow...what a delicious marinade for chicken. I used chicken breasts, just because that's what we prefer, and marinated it only for two hours because I ran out of time and the flavors still came through beautifully.  I loved the sweet chili sauce and the spicy chili sauce all rolled into one.  I made this with Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (one of our lovely Buzz lady's personal recipe) and it made a perfect meal.  This will be a definite repeat meal in my house!

This is a pretty good recipe. I thought it would have been a little spicer but maybe it was because I didn't use the chili-galic sauce (I looked in 4 different stores and couldn't find it anywhere!) Overall, the recipe was great and easy to prepare. Thanks!

I used more of everything spicy in this, and also added a bit of honey to balance it out.  I baked the thighs at 350 for 40 minutes, then broiled.  They came out sweetly spicy, and sticky red-brown, very attractive.  Thanks for a perfect jumping off point to what turned out to be great chicken!

Oh...YUM...what a great marinade for chicken. I didn't have curry so left that out. I used fresh lime and orange juice. I did a taste test before pouring the marinade into my chicken breast bag and felt it needed a tad more sweetness, so added a tablespoon of honey and that did the trick. I also like to add a teaspoon of cornstarch to marinade that I'm going to be reheating on the stove top to use for basting. The sauce will thicken just a bit and sticks better to the meat. Any leftover makes a great dipping sauce. Thanks LoreleiLee for your submission...going on my rotation for grilling sauces.

I saw this recommended on the Buzz and decided to try it.  Very good!  I made just a couple of small changes.  I left out the curry powder and added 1 T. of honey as mentioned by another reviewer.  I used half as a marinade and thickened the other half with a cornstarch/water slurry.  Hubs used part of that to baste on while grilling, and we used the rest as a dipping sauce.  The result was a beautifully grilled chicken breast with a wonderful sheen from the basting sauce.  Very yummy!  This is a definite do again!

Most excellent!! I had to substitute white sugar and molasses for the brown sugar and orange peel for the juice, marinaded over 24 hours, good eats!

7/12/17 update, just made again.  Still excellent! Subbed a TBL of lemon juice for the orange juice and only used sriracha  because I had no  chili paste.  At least overnight marinade is really important.

This a keeper!  Easy and really mouth wateringly good.  Boneless thighs grill really fast - don't over cook them.  While they rested I tossed together some fried rice.  This was a perfect summer time meal.  Thanks!

I wasn't too thrilled with the flavor. Probably would have been better with some honey or more sweetness. Good heat though. Will try again with more sweetness.

I actually made the recipe last night for my boyfriend as kind of a dinner date and I have to say he and I thought it was fantastic. Instead of grilling mine, I pan-fried them and instead of a plastic bag, I used a container to marinate it. So for anyone who's say a college student and using the recipe, pan-frying is a safe way to go. Plus, by pan-frying this recipe, instead of basting the marinade onto the chicken, you can just add the marinade into the pan and let the sugars in the marinade caramelize to create a nice glaze. It goes great over a warm bed of rice. Overall, this recipe is absolutely fantastic and I will definitely end up making this for the future!

I thought this was excellent.  I used bone-in, skinless chicken thighs.  I baked them in the oven at 350 F for 45 minutes.  Great flavor and cannot wait to try these on the grill once the snow is gone.

Terrific BBQ sauce and marinade. I don't say that lightly. We eat a lot of Asian/Island grilled stuff and it takes a special sauce to get our attention. Confession - I had no OJ so subbed lemon juice instead. I was worried that it would be too tart, but it wasn't. This sauce was like Baby Bear - it's just right. It brings just enough Asian soy, just enough island citrus, just enough of everything in it. Even the heat is just right. I wouldn't change a thing. We used a boneless chicken breast, served with stir fry veggies and rice. After basting the chicken there was a little sauce left.  We poured it over the rice to bring it all together. This is a keeper that has earned it's place in our monthly rotation.

We don't like spicy things so I completely left out both chili sauces and the curry. Instead of curry, I used 1/2 tsp ground ginger. You could use fresh if you had it.

Yummy! Super easy to make. I've tried it baked and grilled- both are great. Marinade is easy to make and easy to convert into Low-Sodium variation.  Thanks for posting! :)

Simple and flavorful!  Skin on thighs were juicy and tender after baking at 350 for approx. 50 minutes.  Turned and basted till they came out beautiful and brown.

This recipe is quick and easy to make! I have tried it twice (once using bone-in chicken breast and once using boneless), and both times is was great.  Like others, I found that the recipe needed a bit more sweetness.  I added 3.5 tablespoons of orange juice (instead of 2) and added 1.5 tablespoons of honey and that really balanced out the marinade.  I also added another glove of garlic and used 1.5 teaspoons of Sambal Oelek (a chili paste) instead of the Sriracha noted in the recipe.  With these changes, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was delicious!  I marinated for two days because our plans changed.  Used chicken bone-in thighs for the family, while I had a boneless/skinless breast. Both were wonderful.  The breast was not dry at all likely due to the marinating.  I did not add the curry because I am not a fan.  I decided to zest the lime and orange (used fresh juice).  This was so good!  Try it!  Served with rice that was cooked with pineapple juice/water combo and then added diced pineapple.  So good.  Boiled the marinade and serve as a sauce for the chicken and rice!

WOW!  I'm so excited!  I made the sauce as directed, except for adding a tad more brown sugar.  I wanted to use the meat for a stir fry, so I thinly sliced chicken breast and marinated for about 6 hours.  I cooked up half the batch for dinner and it was pretty good.  Not restaurant quality, but tasty.  Then I let the other meat marinate another day.  I looked online for some tips to make my meat more tender and juicy and I finally found it (I've been searching for YEARS).  The key is to cook the chicken on high heat in very small batches so the meat sears and caramelizes instead of boiling in the juices.  The first time I cooked all the meat at one time.  The second time I cooked in small batches and it was AMAZING!!!  Absolutely restaurant quality and this marinade makes it so delicious.  I will use this again and again...thank you!!

Great recipe. Could not find Thai sweet chilli sauce anywhere, so just used chilli sauce instead, and only marinated for 2 hours. My husband loves spicy food so this was a winner! I served with vegetable fried rice.

Didn't have oj so I used apple juice. Didn't have sweet thai sauce so I used chili garlic sauce. Didn't have lime juice so I used lemon. It'll definitely be different but a good different, I think. Had everything else on hand so we'll see how it turns out tomorrow on the grill! It was easy to put together.

Yummy! This is a fantastic recipe. I used chicken breast and low sodium soy sauce. We eat chicken breast at least 4 times a week so this is on the menu often.

The most delicious skinless, boneless grilled chicken ever.  Moist, bronzed, yummy to even the most timid tasters.

I made this recipe for a family BBQ and used chicken breasts and tenderloins. I marinated them for about 4 hours and while the flavor was delicious-especially on the tenderloins, I would recommend marinating overnight. Very versatile marinade recipe-I had everything on hand too! Will add this to my BBQ repertoire!

This was fabulous! I did not have the sweet sauce and did not miss it. I added a bit more of the Sriracha for a nice extra kick.

This is a very good recipe. I made this for my family and after reading many of the reviews that recommended adding a bit of honey, I did, too.  This was excellent!  Just the right amount of, heat & sweet to it.  If you like it spicier I would say leave the honey out and possibly add a little more siracha-but honestly, it is great just the way it is with a little honey (about a TBSP).  I used chicken breasts because that's what we like to grill and they were so tender and juicy.  I doubled the recipe and had a lot of marinade left over.  I added it to a sauce pan and boiled it for a few minutes on the stove.  It thickened slightly, and I used it to continue basting the chicken as we grilled it.  It gave it extra flavor.  As I try recipes, my family lets me know if its a, "keeper" and this one definitely is a keeper!

This is insanely good! I added a tbl of honey to marinade. I marinated chicken breasts 6 hours, reserved the marinade, boiled for 3 min to sterilize, brushed it on chicken as the filleted boneless skinless chicken breasts were grilling, and it was insane. I cooked my chicken 4 min each side at 400 grill temp that was plenty. I used the remaining sauce for dipping and over rice and vegetables. I will make it again and again!

I am always looking for new ways to serve chicken breast and have to say this marinade is killer fantastic! The  ingredients come together to create a wonderful flavour. First time I have not tweaked a recipe, it's just that good.  Since discovering this recipe, have served it to all of our guests at least once and it's a hit every time. I tried the chicken on top of Caesar Salad for lunch and it was excellent. Thank you LoreleiLee for sharing this recipe on AR.

This is a great recipe. I added alot more sweet chilli sauce and omitted sugar so i could make a sauce to saute chicken breast in. I served with jasmine rice. Really great dinner.

loved this recipe! I have made it multiple times now and plan on doing it again this evening... serving it on the bed of asparagus is so tasty.. I may add a bit of the spicy thai chili sauce to warm it up a little ... With chow mein noodles instead of potatoes and some roasted red peppers ...! omgoodness, I'm so hungry!

I thought the brown sugar and orange juice would make it really sweet, but the spiciness and acidity balanced it out perfectly. In the future I might add a teaspoon more or so of Sriracha just because I love the stuff, but it's moist and delicious as written.

I love this recipe; now in our regular rotation. Simple and delicious, flexible too as I've made it without the sweet Thai chili sauce or had to sub different combinations of citrus juices. I'm sure it would work well with breasts too but definitely try thighs - so much more moist and flavorful. Thanks!

Absoloutely loved this chicken. Second time I'm making it in 7 days. I let it marinate for 4 hours and baked it at 350 deg. for 40 minutes and then put the broiler on till the skin got nice and crispy.  Loved the taste of all the spices....garlic, lime, and the chili spices....can't say enough of about this.  Was even fantastic left over. Used the left over juice from the oven and put it on brown rice....SO good.

I followed the recipe as written and this chicken was awesome.  We marinated chicken breasts for about an hour and cooked as directed. Tender and delicious.  Hubby and grandkids loved them. Thanks so much LoreleiLee for sharing this recipe.

These are delicious.  I marinated mine all day long and went exactly by the recipe.  I could have used a little more heat but otherwise, very good.  I cooked my marinade down to about half and brushed it on the grilling chicken.  It came out kinda sticky and delicious. Will definitely make again.

Another amazing recipe from allrecipes!  Everyone loved it!  I didn't have curry, so I omitted it.  I also added 1/4 - 1/3  cup honey into the marinade.  
Then after pulling the chicken out to grill, I added another 1/4 cup honey into the marinade, while I was boiling it and making the sauce out of it. 
 It was delicious!  I wish I had doubled the marinade recipe, so that I would have had more sauce.  But I will next time!  AWESOME!

Excellent!  For those who don't care for curry flavor; don't worry - you really can't taste it in this recipe.  Just makes it a little spicy.

Marinated from the morning; grilled at night.  did not have Thai style sweet chili sauce...looked at other AR recipes for this and just added some fresh ginger to the marinade.  The Sriracha gave it wonderful flavor. Changed nothing else.  Definitely will make again.

I have had this in my RB since Feb. 2012. I Wish I had tried it the first day I added it! I didn't measure, eye balled the whole thing. I used Chinese 5 Spice powder in place of the curry. I grilled the boobs and slathered the extra sauce over them. Served it with mac n cheese. I will not soon forget this recipe! Thank you Lorelei Lee. Sorry it took me so long to make this;)

I did use sambal oelek instead of siracha and I used hoisin sauce instead of the sweet chili sauce. I also added about 4 drops of pure sesame oil just because I love the flavor.Otherwise, I am so thankful to have found this recipe because I was at a loss for what to do with my split chicken breasts  that I was able to purchase for $.99 a lb

My family liked this, and my husband complimented me on it, but I didn't think it was the "wow!" others did. It is easy to put together. I followed the recipe except I used breasts instead of thighs, and added a cornstarch / water mixture to the sauce to thicken it. An easy weeknight meal, will probably make again for that reason.

I made the marinade so as to use the overnight technique. The only exception is I substituted ground ginger for the ground curry. I then grilled them on indirect heat on my Webber Kettle grill covered. Basting as the recipe suggested. 25 minutes was perfect. May be the best chicken breast recipe I have ever tried. Added to me recipe box for a monthly staple. Grilled asparagus and baked potato were perfect partners but next time I will whip up fried rice to go Asian.

My husband n I really enjoyed the flavor. The only thing is that I baked the chicken.  At 400 degree for 1 hr, which mildly dried it. I will definitely try this recipe again soon with less time! :)

This was delicious.  Used whatever kind of chili paste I had in the fridge and more chicken thighs, but the rest was the same as written.  This is definately a keeper, and I don't keep too many.

This was a good, different and easy recipe. Not spicy, my 2 and 3 year old ate this and my husband loved it. Next time I will thicken the sauce before basting on the BBQ like another reviewer suggested. Served with a simple fried rice and it was perfect. Thanks!

We are very particular eaters in this household; and rarely find a recipe worth making twice.  However; this recipe was a unanimous hit even with with my 17 year old son who had two servings.  I followed the recipe using thin sliced breasts and adding a squirt of honey.  I made a separate batch to baste with and cooked it down to thicken it.  Top notch.

This is a great and flavourful marinade - just making this a second time as a request from my husband. I substituted Sukrin Gold (Brown Sugar Substitute) for the Brown Sugar in keeping with my Keto lifestyle.

I made it twice.  Once with boneless skinless chicken thighs and once with boneless skinless chicken breasts. Both were prepared on the BBQ grill.  The only change I made was to add a little corn starch to the marinade to thicken when boiling it to sterilize it for basting. It stayed on the chicken better and charred very nicely.  Loved it. Cut up leftovers and put on Asian salad for lunch next day.  Great recipe!

I use this as a marinade for grilled chicken thighs, and then, as some others mentioned, boil down a little and baste the chicken.  So good and definitely one of our favorites!

Delicious asian chicken! We made it in the broiler for about 18-20 minutes, but otherwise did not change the recipe. Boiling and saving the marinade was awesome!

We loved this recipe. Omitted the sweet chili sauce I didn't have. Everything else I had. I added a drizzle of sesame oil in the marinade. Let it set all day in fridge. Served with ALL Recipes coconut rice recipe and oven roasted green beans.

This had a nice citrus flavor.   I couldn't find any Thai sweet chili sauce, so I increased the chili garlic sauce and added a Tbsp of honey for sweetness.  I'm allergic to curry, so I left that out.  I used split skinless breasts and sautéed them on the stove.  They were very moist and flavorful.  We will definitely have these again.

I added 1 tablespoon of honey and omitted the curry powder, as suggested by some reviewers. Also, I didn't have any sweet chili sauce, so I substituted Vietnamese dipping sauce. I had rave reviews! Tomorrow night,  I'm trying the leftover glaze on salmon.

Great recipe!  Found it a little late in the day, so only marinated bone -in , skin on thighs for 2 hours before bbqing.  Added a little honey to sauce as some had suggested and cooked marinade into a saucce to serve with chicken and rice. Delicious!

Gathering all the ingredients was a lot - not things we had on hand.  It was okay - I didn't reduce the sauce enough so it was runny and didn't provide the desired glaze effect.

Will probably try it again.

Wow. I found this recipe Tuesday evening and printed it out. We had company today for lunch and i planned on doing two chickens on the rotisserie. I had planned on doing a different new recipe but got a phone call that my new Grandson was on his way, three weeks early. I was in the process of making up a new Chef John marinade so I could start the chicken Wed. night. I must have made a mistake. The marinade was far to thick and spicy. Maybe the wrong sort of barbecue sauce in the marinade. Who knows. So this morning I made up the Asian Grilled Chicken marinade. I only had 2 1/2 hours to let the two chickens soak, but we cooked the chicken, thickened the marinade on the stove for basting, and the whole thing was a success. We will be repeating this recipe again, with longer marinating time. Served chicken with potato salad, Molasses broccoli salad, and Spring Salad with Fennel and Orange ( from this site ). I had to give all my company the recipe for both the chicken and the Fennel Salad. Wonderful

So delicious!  Perfect over veggie-filled fried rice!  We just added a little honey as others suggested. Definitely going to make it again. :)

Loved this recipe!  I only omitted the curry powder (because I'm not a fan) and it was fabulous.

I skipped the thai sauce and chili hot sauce (added chili pepper seasoning and a bit of coconut oil instead), and still got rave reviews from hubby and kids, tough critics too! Great flavor with the grill!

My wife's favorite chicken recipe!  She asks for it at least a couple times a month!  I make double the marinade so we can heat it up and baste with it, plus have enough to put over rice.

Reminded my of Malaysian chicken (and rice). So good. I can't wait to make this again. Chicken thighs hold these flavors so well. Moist and juicy.

Very easy, versatile marinade. If baking, I highly recommend finishing last ten minutes under the broiler to caramelize the sauce. Savory, sweet, and spicy.

GREAT MARINADE FAST TASTY I put chicken thighs in ziplock and this marinade. Froze. Easy to bring out and grill or slow cooker with cornstarch at end to thicken sauce. Great in slow cooker. Of all the soy sauce brown sugar type marinades, this is my favorite. The siriacha,  chili, and others give it great flavor.

Only difference from recipe was that I used  ( some) skin on- bone in  thighs.  I certainly  liked the marinade since it is so different from the usual ones.  The lime, orange, curry powder and the thai sauces made it really special.  Will keep this as my "go to" marinade for chicken and maybe try on beef.

I made this for some good friends and they all went home with the recipe!   Mr girlfriends husband said it was the best chicken he had all summer and their kids loved it too.  I made no changes to the recipe (for once) because it is delicious the way it is!  Perfect for a summer bbq!

Great marinade!  It's practically against my religion to not tinker, but this was spot-on!  Thai sweet chili sauce has become a staple in my kitchen, so it was easy to throw together for marinating B/S chicken thighs.  Spent about 5 hours in the fridge in marinade, then onto the grill with the summer garden veggies and Italian bread slices.  Boiled off the marinade for a drizzle on the plates, it was yummy.  No ovens in the 100+ weather!  Will try on steaks, shrimp and pork, too.

I made some changes but only because I didn't have the specific ingredients in my pantry.  I switched thai-style chili sauce for kikoman teriyaki marinade and chile-garlic sauce for Cholula hot sauce.  I also added pepper and 2 scallions including the stems.  

this is an all around great marinade. we did a chicken shish kabob. we will use it as our go-to  Asian marinade from now on

Loved this marinade!  It's a great base recipe to play with .  I made a few adjustments to fit my tastes and what I had on had, used teriyaki sauce instead of soy, a little less brown sugar, and upped the oj and curry powder, love the stuff.  I marinated overnight.  A do- over and a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this yummy grilling recipe.

I made this just as the recipe suggested. I marinated for about 6 hours. I gave it a 4 star only because when I cut it open none if the marinate was soaked in.  The chicken was great but bland in the middle. Soft and juicy. The wife loved it, but says I'm my own worst critic.  I will make it again, might try  injecting or cutting get it soaked in.

This receive is amazing. You can Taylor it to your taste, as is its a little sweet to me so I halved the brown Sugar and doubled the Chile Sauce for my taste. I also love this receipt on chicken thighs and BBQ'd low and slow.

On the advice of previous reviews Iadded 1/2 cup of honey to add some sweetness. It was a good call.  I made this for a gal in our third date. It was so good it blew my date clothes off into a corner of my room. Thumbs up.

Like others, I thought it was a bit mild so I added about a teaspoon of sriracha and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch slurry prior to basting.  Very tasty and the chicken really looked beautiful coming off the grill!  Definitely a keeper for me!

Mine did not turn out like the photo! I marinated it overnight & followed the recipe exactly. I didn't feel like it really sunk in the chicken & seemed to be missing something. I used an indoor T-fal grill, which may have changed things?

this came out a lot better than i expected.. i did deviate quite a bit based on what i know me and bf prefer.. left out the brown sugar.. subbed rice wine vinegar for the orange juice.. garlic chili paste for the sweet chili sauce.. and 1/2 tsp garlic powder for the fresh.. added 1/4 tsp each of ground ginger and onion powder.. i marinated three 5 oz chicken strips and one 7 oz bone in pork chop (i read online that as long as you bring them up to proper temperature it's safe to marinate them together).. the pork took to the marinade a lot better but the chicken was still tasty.. i could see how this recipe could lend itself to more of a sweet profile.. but that's just not our style.. ty for the recipe

A solid Asian marinade.  Thighs won't dry out as much as breasts with this marinade.  It burns easily so you'll either have to raise the grill away from the heat or supervise VERY closely.  I cheated and used foil.  Reduced the marinade by half and served as a sauce.  A green salad with mandarin oranges, sliced almonds, and Asian dressing was a great side.

I have been disappointed so many times making highly rated/reviewed recipes from this site and finding them lacking, but not this time!   The chicken practically danced off the plate with flavor!  Because of unforeseen circumstances,  the chicken marinated for a day and a half before being grilled. I used breasts, and added the juices/zests  of  a large orange and lime to the marinade.  Wonderful WONDERFUl flavor! Served with Thai Pineapple Rice, and slices of fresh tomato and cucumber.  WOW!!!

This wasn't bad, by any means ... but it didn't wow us, either.  Made as directed, marinading chicken for a good 9 hrs.  Just 'eh'. Many thanks for recipe anyway.

It's deliciously simple. Few ingredients but a couple were a little hard to find. Well worth the effort. I like food more spicier. It was a little on the mild side.

I love ANYTHING 'Oriental' so tried this recipe, but used orange marmalade (another favorite of mine) instead of orange juice (which I find bitter), and also used some Sambol Oelek. Also, I can't stand chicken thighs, so used wings instead. The result was really good.

Made this using a couple of additions from other reviews (honey & cornstarch as a thickener)  Otherwise followed recipe with ingredients as stated.  The chix marinated overnight.  We used 1/2 of the sauce to baste during grilling with remainder for dipping sauce.  The sauce is terrific, but as far as any flavors from marinating the chix, none of those flavours came through....all flavors were in the sauce.  Almost forgot.....I added some lime and orange zest.  The addition of the zest really enhanced the flavours of the sauce.  There is not enough curry in this recipe to concern non-curry lovers...just a hint of the spice when combined with the other ingredients.  I would also double the sauce next time to make sure there is enough for serving.  We loved the "hint" of heat in this recipe.

The marinade is first rate and can be used on any chicken parts for grilling. I had excellent results with boneless/skinless chicken breasts with 5+ hours in the bag. Also, not being a curry-fan, I substituted it for ground ginger. The family loved it, and one of the best grilled chicken I've had in some time. (Sweet chili sauce? I used hoisin sauce, really good!)

Awesome. I doubled the chili sauce.  It makes it little more spicy but not too spicy.   Also, I used chicken breasts and marinated it for 5 hours.  It's added to my favorites.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I didn't have sweet chili sauce, and read other reviews where they thought the sweetness needed a boost so I used leftover duck sauce packets from Chinese takeout, (hate to waste anything) and a little honey for added sweetness, and upped the amount of Sriracha.  I also added some sesame oil (just a little; goes a long way) and some sesame seeds.  Was terrific... served it with Jasmati rice and grilled okra (I know sounds weird but whole grilled okra is the bomb in the summertime.. and a salad with some mandarin oranges, fresh cucumbers and toasted almond slices.

This was great and will be a regular in my house!  Some small changes.... We use low sodium soy sauce.  It was raining so no grill.  we baked for 40 minutes at 350 and then cooked uncovered in the broiler for 5 minutes.  I heated the leftover marinade and used it to baste the chicken and sides. Served with brown rice and asparagus

What a fantastic recipe!  I made it the other day for my family and they loved it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added a tbsp of honey (for a little more sweetness)and a tsp of cornstarch (to thicken the sauce when cooked).  Next time, I'll double the recipe so there's more left for dipping.  Thanks for sharing.
