I had to do my a bit different since I didn't have any broccoli cheese soup, or any other cream soup that I could use. I first peeled and cut the potatoes and put them on to cook. Then I made my own THIN cream/white sauce to which I added a chicken boullion cube, fresh ground pepper, curry powder and about 1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  It was almost as easy as opening a can of soup.  I cubed my leftover chicken breasts.  I also cut the broccoli up into flowerettes, put them in a microwave safe dish and nuked them in the microwave for 2 minutes until crisp tender. I then added this and the cubed chicken to the sauce and heated it through. I spooned this over the mashed potatoes.  Total cook time, 20-25 min.  It turned out AWESOME!!!

This was very good, but it did need more flavor.  I used one can of cream of broccoli soup and one can of cheddar cheese soup.  I doubled the amount of milk.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!!), I will add some shredded cheddar to the sauce and some salt.  Overall, delicous!

Very delicious dish! My family just loved it! I did do a few steps differently. I cut the chicken in strips, dredged them in flour, and sauteed them in a skillet. Then in a separate sauce pan, I mixed: broccoli cheddar soup, 1 cup of cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of milk, a few slices of coby cheese, and 1 cup of frozen chopped broccoli. I let that cook until everything melted together and was slightly bubbly. After the chicken was done (and so was the cheese sauce) I poured the sauce in with the chicken. Set the stove to low heat and covered it. Cooked it for 30. Came out excellent! We did try it with some sour cream mash potatoes; just melts in your mouth! I will for sure make this again!!

My veggie-phobic boyfriend gobbled it up, even with fresh broccoli, carrots, and low fat broccoli cheese soup!  I used rice instead of potatoes, so it comes out tasting a lot like rice-a-roni but with fresh ingredients, and a lot healthier.  Oh, I cooked the rice in chicken broth to add extra flavor, and mixed about half a cup of shredded cheese in to the chicken mixture before serving.

EDIT: Made it again with potatoes but stirred them into the mixture, ends up like a thick potato cheese soup, give it a try!

This is really turn so good! So creamy and yummy!  I'm not follow every single ingredients.. Ok, so here we go:  For chicken itself, I cut into bit size, I saw reviews that people can't taste the chicken breast, that is because chicken breast has solid flesh, so white, and kinda hard.. If you put thighs, it's probably fine, but if breast, cut it up to bite size, after you browned them, drain all the oil with paper towel/plates, and give little dash of salt! Set aside..   After I browned them, I saute 1 clove of garlic, my husband and I love garlic, so it's not problem to put garlic a lil bit, it smells good and taste of garlic make food more tasty!  For broccoli, since I just have  1 cup of broccoli, I mix it with 1 up of spinach, chopped it roughly! And it taste unique and wonderful..  For broccoli soup, I didn't have it, so I change with Chicken Soup, it works!  Last not the least, the part of "cover for 5 minutes" put 1 cup of cheddar cheese and wait for 5 minutes, and stir it.. Yummy!! Tasty!!   My husband doesn't like veggies AT ALL. but his plate was clean!! with all spinach and broccoli :p   Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very pleasing.  When you make it, it doesn't really look like it's enough to feed your family, but with the mashed potatoes, those really fill you up and the amount is perfect! I too added a bit more milk to make a little more sauce.

We actually thought this did not taste good and had little flavor. I even added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the chicken before I browned it. It did not help. I would not make this again.

quick and easy AND DELICIOUS! That's my kinda meal! Made this for dinner for the bf and I. Used instant (gasp) mashed potatoes and added chopped onion and shredded cheddar cheese plus salt and pepper. Since I used fresh broccoli, I cooked the whole mix for 5 extra minutes. Excellent dish.

This was five stars the way that I did it, but I'm unconvinced that the canned soup would make it better...  I cooked pieces of chicken tenderloins in some olive oil in one pot while cooking the cheese sauce in the other.  For that, I melted butter and added some flour (gluten-free) to start a roux.  Then I added cream and a little milk, some parmesan cheese and some shredded "mexican" cheese", as well as dijon mustard and paprika.  I kept adding cream, milk, and cheese until I got the right quantity.  added fresh broccoli and baby carrots and allowed to cook.  Add the chicken after it was browned and simmered together until potatoes were done.  used garlic mashed potatoes rather than regular.  delicious!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!  I changed it up a bit though, added a little sour cream & a can of Cream of mushroom soup.  I also made it into a casserole dish.  I lined the bottom with the mashed potatoes and mixed everything else together and filled the dish up. For the topping, I layered shredded cheddar cheese then I crunched up ritz crackers and poured a little butter over them, threw it in the over for about 15-20 minutes and YUM!!!  Everyone LOVED it!

I didn't have cheese soup so I just used cream of chicken and added shredded cheese. Also I used Yukon Gold potatoes. This stuff was great. My family instantly wanted to know when we could have this again.

My husband and I both loved it!  I did make a few changes: Cut chicken breast into bite size pieces and then coated in flour then egg and then panko bread crumbs. Served over potatoes and then poured sauce over so that the chicken stayed crispy until eating. Also added twice as much milk as well as shredded cheddar to the sauce.

I thought this was a very good, quick meal.  I made mine with the thin chicken breasts and between the husband and son there were no leftovers. Also, I used frozen broccoli and wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook it or not before adding.  I microwaved it for about two minutes, squeezed the water out of it and then added to the skillet, tasted much like fresh.

I followed some of the suggestions and diced my chicken. I did this especially since I was feeding the meal to children and they cant cut their meat yet! I also used cream of chicken soup. The meal turned out delicious. Very easy weekday meal.

Great dinner for those nights that I don't feel like cooking or when I get home late. I didn't have the broccoli soup so I put in a can of Cream of Chicken Soup. I also had some carrots that needed to be used so I threw them in too (2 carrot sticks).
Served it over rice for a more healthy alternative.
YUMMY

I had read plenty of reviews that the recipe was rather bland, so I chose to add McCormick’s Salad Supreme seasoning and some salt and pepper (to taste) to the final product as well as sprinkled some fiesta blend cheese on top. I didn’t eat this with mashed potatoes either. It was good to me, but I doubt I’ll make it again.

Decent and quick. I added a can of cream of chicken and double the milk to make it more gravy like over the potatoes. My kids ate it over rice as they don't care for mashed potatoes and most of it was gone from their plate. I did cut the chicken into bite size pieces just to speed the cooking of the chicken but I really think that just works better with this recipe anyway.

I've made this several times..and have changed it up a bit. I used a can of cheddar soup and a can of broccoli cheese soup. I also made this with chicken leg quarters that I had browned and cooked in a pan.  Then I shredded the chicken and put it in casserole dish.  I put the soups in a sauce pan to heat it up to mix with the milk.  Next I put th cheese sauce the dish. I added more broccoli than the recipe calls for because, well, we love broccol! I also added some shredded cheddar and colby jack to the dish, putting some on top. I cooked it till the cheese was browned. Served it over mashed potatoes.  I call it chicken with broccoli cheese gravy (because I have to explain to the litte one what I making)! This does make the prep and cooking time much longer, but worth it if you can spare it. Thank you for this to work off of, gives a lot of possibilities. The dish does seem to get all eaten in the first night, no matter how much I make or how I make it!

This is a great recipe that can also be done in the crockpot.  I think there is even another recipe on this site called "Cheesy Chicken."  You just add the broccoli at the end.  Throw everything in the crockpot and cook for 6-7 hours, used prepared mashed potatoes and frozen broccoli and you can have dinner on table in about 10 minuts top after work.

Wow.  This is delicious!  And so incredibly easy!  The only thing i did differently than the recipe is I doubled the milk and put in 2 cans of soup.  It was sooooo good!  I also sprinkled some shredded cheese on just before serving(more cheese is always a good thing:P)  My boyfriend and I loved it!  I'm definitely saving this recipe.  :)

Well I really wanted to make this for dinner because it sounded yummy.  However, I had none of the soups so I had to make my own cheese sauce.  I used frozen broccoli and instant mashed potatoes.  Once I cooked the chicken cutlets in olive oil, garlic and onion powder I removed the cooked chicken and cubed it and set it aside.  I then cooked extra broccoli in the microwave for about 7 minutes while I was cooking the chicken.  I then added the broccoli to the pan with the drippings from the chicken added the 1/4 cup of milk and about 10 slices of american cheese to the pan and stirred it up until it looked a creamy soup.  Keep making sure it does not burn, I added the cubed chicken and kept stirring.  Poured a portion over a serving of mashed potatoes, added lots of black pepper and salt to taste and it was very very good!  Will make again and often.....

This was fantastic, probably one of my favorite casserole type meals.  I did cook it a bit differently as I cooked the chicken (cut into cubes) and broccoli on the stove and then transferred everything into a cassarole dish and baked at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes.  I used 2 cans of soup because I made a bit more than the recipe called for.  I also topped with french fried onions to add extra flavor.  It was fantastic!

This was a GREAT idea!  I used the "SONGDANCER"s help as I didn't have any soup. Its a little salty, but so filling.  Leftovers were even better!  Thanks for the idea and sharing.

This was so easy- made it on a whim and it only took a few minutes.  Very cheap and very filling... which is exactly what this Air Force dorm kid needs!  I did add another 1/3 cup of milk, because it looked a little thick.

will make again i added chopped broccoli stems to the pan when chicken was almost done cooking-they have more flavor. i used a can of cream of cheddar soup and chopped the chicken smaller. i definitively want to try this with rice.

Loved this recipe. My only complaint is the chicken didn't soak up enough of the flavor but it was still flavorful enough to get a 5.  I didn't use mashed potatoes I used rice instead and it went very well together.

I changed directions - might be it's own new recipe.  I about doubled everything and added a can of cream of chicken soup to the 2 cans of broccoli cheese soup.  I mixed the 3 soups with 1 -2 c. broccoli and 3/4  c. milk and about 2 cups of cooked diced chicken.  I pour the mix into a lightly greased 9x13 pyrex dish, then spread dollops of about 7 or 8 cups mashed potatoes (mine were left-over garlic mashed potatoes I had to use up).  Then I sprinkled a little garlic salt and lots of shredded cheese and some bread crumbs on top, baked covered (tented the foil) at 350 for about 1 hour, then uncovered for about 15 minutes.  It's basically a variation of shepherd's pie - and since I had the cubed chicken left over from a rotisserie chicken and all the taters, it was a good use of left-overs.  My kids (ages 8, 6, 3 and 1) all loved it, which surprised me.  It was very tasty.

This is a fabulous recipe!  It is so simple and tastes awesome. I have a very picky 5 yr old and a 15 month old and they both cleaned thier plateand husband had 2nds! The only things I changed were to cut up the chicken because I only had 2 full sized and 2 thin fillets so to feed 4 people I cut them up in pretty good sized pieces to make it go farther. Added half a boiler onion to chicken and oil in pan sauteed togerther w some salt and pepper cooked till done on outside, here's what I reccommend don't do that maybe cook it a little bit just to get it going then add all your other ingredients your chicken will be much more flavorfull! I only put about a 1/2c milk and probably about 1 1/2c maybe 2c of shredded cheese and served over white rice( I didn't want to peel potatos) but next time am going to definately use the potatos I can tell it'll be fab! Thanks for a great simple and fast recipe!

Very easy, the only difference was that I preferred the chicken cubed, and I think next time I'll add an additional half can to make a bit more sauce.. but this was a wonderful base and truly quick!

This was a good base. I also topped it with cheddar and cubed the chicken, and put it over rice instead. Next time I would also add mushrooms.

This was easy, but a little bland. So, I added some salt and everyone ate it. Good for a quick meal.

This was just ok for me.  I ended up doubling the soup and the milk since we prefer a lot of sauce.  I also grilled the chicken separately, then combined it with the soup and broccoli at the end.  I think it was the flavor of the soup that just made this seem a bit "off" to me.  Next time I might do as someone else suggested and make my own cheese sauce instead of the soup.  My husband really liked it, though, so maybe it is just me.

Love this stuff! It is so good and so easy. We like to cut our chicken into chunks and serve it with the broccoli-cheese over the mashed potatoes like gravy. Leftovers are also good with brown rice if you run out potatoes. This has quickly become one of my favorite meals and undoubtedly will be on the rotation for a long, long time to come.

I only made three small changes. I added some salt and pepper to the chicken, I used chicken stock instead of oil (or I would've cooked it without either if I didn't have stock - no need for the oil), and I cut the chicken into cubes before cooking. Very good!

I am rating this a 4 star because I thought this dish was plain, but everyone who ate it loved it. I made garlic mashed potatoes, which added a little extra flavor. just add in garlic cloves while you are boiling the potatoes for delicious garlic mashed potatoes!

This recipe is so yummy!  I couldn't find broccoli cheese soup, so I bought one can of cream of broccoli, and one can of cheese soup and mixed them together.  That actually worked well because you can customize how much of the cheese you want.  I served this recipe over four-cheese mashed potatoes (a mix).  My family loved it, including my two-year-old!

This just doesn't have much flavor.  It would be much better with real mashed potatoes.

I made this for dinner the other night when I was searching for something fairly quick and easy. I cut up the chicken and I used cream of cheddar cheese soup and cream of chicken. I used frozen broccoli but next time I will use more. This was pretty good for a quick 2 pan dinner.
