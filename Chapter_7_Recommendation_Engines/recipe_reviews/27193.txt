We loved it!  I used the reduce fat Bisquick baking mix. I cut the oil back to 1/3 cup.  I also added two large garlic cloves, finely chopped.  This is a great recipe to take as pot-luck dish.  When I made this a second time I split the batter up and put bacon in half, and lighly sauted mushrooms in the other - but I baked it in the same dish (1/2 and 1/2).  This is a no fail recipe.  I tried to cut the oil back to 1/4 cup, but it turned out to be too dry - the 1/3 cup is best.

I would also add a 1/2 tsp. of dried basil or oregano, for variation.

This is a winner.

I made this and it was great.  The second time I made it; I grated the zucchini and it came out much better - easier to slice.

This recipe is very similar to one that my mother-in-law passed down to us. The only difference is that we use 1/2 cup parmesan instead of the cheddar cheese. 

I like to use egg substitute, and I always peel and shred the zucchini. I also cut the oil in half, and my family actually prefers the lighter version.

To me a 4.5 star recipe is one that needs almost no tweaking to be divine and that is just not the case here.  I made it as suggested and it was just bland.  I have no idea how this dish would be cut into "bite sized appetizers" or made to look like the pretty photo included.  Perhaps if you took all of the changes that other reviewers suggest it would be memorable but then it would be an entirely different recipe.  It is a good base concept and a new way to use zucchini so I liked that.  I may try it again with lots of changes. Sorry!

I added a 1/2 tsp dry mustard, a 1/4 tsp curry powder, about 1/2 cup Italian seasoned tomatoes that were left over from another dinner, then added a handful of fresh herbs from my garden.....some Italian parsely, dill, oregano.  I added a bit more garlic. I also used green onion instead of regular onion, then threw in about two TBSP more of the baking mix so it wouldn't be too mushy.  The end result was very pleasing, and the dinner party guests all raved about the appetizer. Personally, the jury is still out, but I am going to freeze the leftovers, and serve it at my next party in a few weeks.Can't argue with the masses.

I took note of what some of the other reviewers said and made the following changes.  I think it came out really well and will definitely make it again.  This could be served warm or cold too. I shredded the zucchini and thinly thinly sliced a small onion and sauteed it until it was caramelized.  I also added some much needed seasoning -- things like pepper (why isn't it in the recipe?) and a good pinch of herbs de Provence.  I think just about any herbs you like with zucchini or eggs would work.  I also think how you mix the ingredients could make the difference in appearances.  I mixed all the veggies and seasonings first.  I then stirred in the baking mix making sure to evenly coat all ingredients.  Then, the cheese was mixed in.  In a separate bowl I whisked the eggs and oil together and then finally stirred it all in.  I took a bit of extra grated cheese and put it on top before placing it all in the oven. I think you could take some extra liberties with the recipe such as mixing in some red pepper or putting thin tomatoes slices on top before baking the whole thing.  I think it came out well and all it needed was the right mixing and seasoning.

The whole family loved it!! Made it in the morning and by lunch time it was gone.  I added about 2 tsp. of chopped jalapenos to it, as we like our food with a bite! Great for an appetizer or anytime snack.

I made these for a party as an hors'deouvres and they were SO bland. All you could taste was egg and zucchini.  Maybe for brunch these would be okay, but not as an appetizer at a cocktail party.

This is sooooo good.  I made it once to take to a Baby Shower and I have made it 6 times since and everyone asked for the recipe.  Everyone is very good at keeping me supplied with the zucchini.

I'm glad it wasn't just me!  As an appetizer it was way too bland.  I added 1 cup of cheese and will add more salt, Tabasco and "spice it up". I also baked it 35-40 minutes.  The concept was good and I'll do it again.  Thanks.

Tried it and liked it. Made some adjustments that my family likes. We even serve this as the Main course. I decreased the oil to 1/4 of a cup. And I added 2 heaping tablespoons of Feta cheese! Very yummy!

Great appetizer recipe! I put the batter in my mini cupcakes pan (instead of the square cuts U get from a pan). I did grate the zucchini & drained on paper towel. I added lots of habenero's for extra hot flavor and sprinled parmesan cheese on top when just about cooked! I brought to a family party and were gone in no time...Everyone loved them!

These are so good.  I halved the recipe and put in 9x9 pan.  It took  about  35  minutes to brown.

Very good and easy to make, but 4 eggs were definitely too much: the dish had a heavy taste of egg in it. I baked for 40 minutes, which was just perfect.

This was not what I expected.  I would have enjoyed enjoyed it if it were more eggy, or more bready, but somehow this was somewhere in betweeen.

Pretty much followed recipe as stated. My husband and I absolutely loved this light side dish.  Came out more like a quiche, tho...I used the lo-fat Bisquick. Loved the taste...easy to make...would be a family favorite at a get together.  Can't figure out how it would be cut into "bite-sized pieces" for an appetizer...but doesn't matter...this is a very good recipe!! Thx!

I did not have the crushed garlic, so I sprinkled Garlic Powder on top. It was enjoyed, but I think it would be better to fry the onions first to cut down on how strong the onions taste.
Small pieces of tomato could also be added for a difference, if liked. Very easy to make, and well-liked too!

I must say, I was quite hesitant to try this, but it was delicious.   I used my own homemade baking mix, and halved the recipe.   The cooking time was more like 40 mins.
I also shredded my zucchini and added parmesan cheese.

This is the easiest receipe to make and the appetizer was a hit at my BBQ party. After removing it from the oven, let it cool down so you can cut clean squares for bite size pieces.

The flavor was delicious and my 17 month daughter loved it!  But, I was disappointed with the consistancy of this recipe.  I took it out after 25 minutes and the middle squares were a bit runny.  Next time I will bake it longer than 25 minutes.

Definitely had a great taste - I received a lot of compliments. However, I don't know how we're expected to cut this into "bites". I cut it into squares and served more as a side dish or a casserole. Bake time is definitely longer than posted - about 15 minutes longer.

Great use for surplus zucchini!  I always look for new interesting ways to use my garden bounty.  I used a wheat and gluten-free baking mix because of allergy.  GF Baking requires a bit more liquid so I added half a cup of low-fat milk.  Did reduce oil to 1/3 c.  It was delicious.  For a maindish the next time I added half a pound of browned ground turkey and a pinch of Italian seasoning.  This is a keeper.  I put a bottle of hot sauce on the table so everyone could spice it up or not.

This was an easy and tasty way to use up some zucchini from my garden.  I cut it into "fingers" and served with a red pepper dipping sauce.

I felt that this recipe was too much like quiche for an appetizer.  It would be wonderful for brunch, but didn't go over very well at dinner. It had a great flavor, just not what I was expecting.

This worked much better as a casserole than a bite size item for me. I used a smaller baking dish and it was excellent!

I cut down on the baking mix quantity and shredded the zuccini as reccommended in previous reviews.  I will add just a bit more baking mix next time, but probably not the entire amount in the recipe.  Every one loved it.

This was very delicous, and I was surprised at how much it made! I would note to possibly add less baking mix, because if you use too much it turns out almost like zucchini bread.  Even if it does turn out like bread though, the flavor is still very good!  Its not greasy, the baking mix really absorbs all the oils from the cheese and it has a very nice texture.  I would definitely plan ahead though, this took about 40 min. in my oven to cook.  Also, it was hard to cut into bite size pieces, due to texture and casserole shape.  So, I served hearty biscuit sized pieces.  They were eaten up!  I would make it again, but next time I will try less baking mix.

First off let me apologize for this review. I did not make this recipe as submitted. I needed to get rid of some of my peter pan summer squash and decided to tweak this for a veggie side dish for dinner. How it turned out it could very well be used as an appetizer. But with my modifications, it turned out fantastic. Even my non-veggie eaters devoured this before anything else on their dinner plate. First off, the 36 servings makes a small side dish so don't be afraid to do that amount. It seemed like too much at first so I cut it down to 18 but ended up adding back in to get the 36 servings. I shredded 3 large peter pan squash (also known as summer squash)to get 3 cups squash. Used only 1/3 cup oil as others suggested. Used green chives (both the white and green parts) instead of white. Used parmesan cheese instead of the cheddar. And here's what I think made the dish. I used two 4 ounce cans of diced green chili peppers. I also added thinly sliced green bell peppers in the batter and layed on top for a nice presentation. I also sprinkled the top with parmesan cheese and paprika. And we served it with Franks hot sauce for dipping. Those are the keys to this being fantastic. The diced chili peppers added huge flavor to this dish. And the dipping sauce sealed the deal. This did turn out like a quiche dish so cut the eggs down to two if you want a more decadent dish.

This was good but bland.  If I make it again I will add some spices.  I changed the receipe slightly by adding shedded cheese and panko bread crumbs on top.

I halved this recipe to make it a side dish--I think it's more appropriate as a side rather than an appetizer. This is a good "concept" recipe that needed some help. Just a little bit of italian seasoning made all the difference to the taste, though it came out a bit dry. Maybe adding a little liquid (milk?) to the batter would have helped. I sliced my zucchini thin, but I agree with others it would be better shredded.

This recipe is incredible.  A great healthy way to use up all the zucchini I have on hand this time of year.  Once cooled and cut they store well and last for a week, if you can get people to let them last that long.  I will make this recipe again and again.  I highly recommend it.  The picture having melted cheese on top is a bit misleading but an easy fix for any one with a lick of cooking sense.  Cindy

This recipe is less of an appetizer and more of a dish to serve your family when no company is over. It doesn't look appealing after baking, and I had to add incredible amounts of garlic and spices to make it flavorful. I won't be making this again.

This can come out a bit mushy, so perhaps decreasing the amount of oil or adding more baking mix would be in order next time.  This can be kind of bland, so a little extra salt is in order.  I made this for a pot luck at work and it went over well.

Although this tasted good, it was definitely more of a quiche than a finger food like the pic shows.  Unfortunately I procrastinated on getting ready for my party, saw the picture, bought the ingredients and it turned out nothing like I had hoped.  I will be sure to read reviews first next time!

Good basic recipe. I found it to be a little bland, so I shredded the zucchini, added bacon bits, and some pepper. Everyone loved it, even the ones who didn't like zucchini (myself included).

Good but very fattening. I would cut back on the oil and maybe add a little spice.

I liked this recipe with the changes some of you proposed. I used a whole onion, with an additional 1/4 cup green onion. I used 1 cup of shredded mexican cheese, the stuff with the jalapenos in it. I omited the garlic cloves and just put in garlic powder, because that's all I had. Ha, and finally added some black pepper. Pretty good.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it.  They thought it was a dip or quiche but they loved it.  I shredded the zucchinni and used extra cheese.

This dish is great as an appy for all occasions.  Did however shred the zucchini, reduce oil to 1/3 cup, used 2 garlic cloves and threw in herbs in the mix.  Instead of cheddar, used shredded Tex-Mex as it is my favorite go-to.  Topped lightly with the same cheese and chopped parsley for color.  Will make again!

Read the reviews since was taking to a picnic of beer drinkers knew I had to amp up flavors, had plenty of Zukes n garden.
Added  1/4 tsp Italian seasoning, Used a 5 Italian cheese mix, 2 cloves of garlic, since zukes were pick this morning used 1/3 oil instead of half. Everyone liked will make again.

I have made a variation of this for years.  My recipe calls for 6 cups of sliced zucchini, and no garlic (although I always added some garlic chips since I love garlic)  I never added salt because I think the two cups of shredded cheddar adds enough.  It's easy to make and tastes great

This is a good base recipe other than it needs a lot more seasoning. I cut down on the squash and added some asparagus that needed used. Many different veggies would go well with this recipe: mushrooms, peppers, cooked diced potato, a handful of leftover green beans... use your imagination.

Have thrown in all kinds of other veggies into this and it turns out great - also subbed parm for cheese per other reviewers.  Big hit at potluck!
