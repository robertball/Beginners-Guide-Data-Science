These were quite delicious. They are practically a meal in themselves. They do actually taste like a brownie. The only issue for me was using a baking sheet to spread them out, which was difficult. Then icing them was not smooth. I tried and abandoned the idea. I ended up rolling them into balls, warming the icing, then drizzling it over them.  This way was prettier and easing to serve to guests. I topped them with some fresh grated coconut.
