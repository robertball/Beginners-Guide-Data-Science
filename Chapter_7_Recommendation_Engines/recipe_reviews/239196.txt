it turned out much better than I was expecting. It was a little too sweet.

Fantastic!  Super easy, fantastic lemon flavour.  I sent a dozen to my sons preschool and everyone loved them, my son asked if we could make them the next day. I am not a decorator at all, hence why my icing and decorating leaves something to be desired lol, but I did follow this recipe exactly for both the cupcake and the frosting and both are awesome.  Perhaps more lemon flavour (Im a lemonaholic) and I may try using coconut extract in the frosting next time too.

I am new to baking. I loved this recipe...it was a lot simpler then a lot I was finding. It seems a little dense...trying to figure out how to fix that next time...I did not find them too sweet, They may need a little less flour..or just more milk..it is a good recipe to use as a base for other flavors too, it seems. I did not use lemon extract. I used concentrated lemon juice...(it gave it a lighter lemon flavor...)..for a strong lemon flavor I would suggest using actual fresh lemons. I did not use the frosting recipe...I wanted cream cheese frosting...I find a very easy recipe on foodnetwork.com.

I think I will start using this recipe for cupcakes.
I did add a little more sugar, not a lot more.

I will see if my fiance likes it. I filled the cupcake liners almost all the way..maybe 3/4 full and they did round up pretty nice. 
The batter was a bit thicker too, the last ones I made had a very watery batter...which is why I think these may have needed a little more milk..

Delicious lemon cupcake with just the right amount of flavour and sweetness, with an AMAZING lemon frosting! I added some extra lemon extract to the frosting and everything turned out absolutely perfect! For a finishing touch, I also added some lemon pieces sticking straight out of the frosting; they looked GREAT!! These cupcakes were GREAT and I would definitely recommend!!!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Lemon flavor is a pleasant change from vanilla and chocolate.

The dough turned out great. I love that u can smell the lemon as well as taste it, I gave half of the sugar they put here and it was still way too sweet for me (so you can imagine putting the actual sugar listed in the recipe). I would recommend putting a lot less sugar, like half less then listed here.  Also, frosting wasn't that great, too sweet and the texture turned out weird. Look for different frosting or icing to put on top, this one was over the top sweet.

This recipe/dish was fantastic and went very quickly!!!  Everyone (family and/or friends) enjoyed this dessert meal – the only complaint was that no one could get seconds.   I allow for seconds after I have cooked the dish for a first time.  That being said there will definitely be a next time as this dessert dish is going into the family’s meal rotation.

The cupcake itself is a five, the frosting is a three.

These turned out really good but quite dense so more like breakfast muffins than a nice dessert cupcake. I followed the recipe exact but then added fresh cranberries and omitted the icing.
