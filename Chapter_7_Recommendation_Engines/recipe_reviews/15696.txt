The recipe has one error, I believe...since the sugar is divided in the ingredients list, I think the first addition of sugar is supposed to be 1 1/2 cups, with the extra 1/4 cup to be added in later for rolling the balls in.  Mine worked out fine this way.  I also had my doubts about the accuracy of the recipe when it called to cream only a tbsp of butter with all that sugar, but it turned out fine.  The dough was quite sticky for rolling balls...I found that refrigerating it between batches and spraying nonstick spray on my hands ( ! ) worked best to keep it from sticking to me.  My yield was 64 cookies, made from approx 1 inch balls.  Parchment paper also was great for these...

These weren't that bad for a nearly non-fat recipe, with some given modifications.  I used about 1/2 cup less white sugar>, and added about 2 teaspoons vanilla. They weren't spicy enough for me--I'd definitely add a few dashes more of each spice, maybe even doubling it (especially with that lack of fat).  I wanted to make these crisp (or rather, crunchy) instead of soft and chewy, but I think unless the gingersnaps were 1.5" in diameter (which isn't a bad idea at all), they won't be too crisp, especially in the center, with the directed baking time.  I don't see how you can make chewy cookies.  I didn't try it, but judging from the soft center of my crunchy cookies, the texture would be more like a tough bread than a soft, chewy cookie with such a low fat content.  All in all, a hopefully flavorful recipe for those who are looking for low-fat (It'd be ** or *** stars otherwise).

These cookies are a pretty good alternative to the full fat version, but they did not turn out thin & crispy like we prefer our gingersnaps. If you like soft, puffy, & chewy gingersnaps, then this is the recipe for you. :) We did like the flavor, however (I added much more ground ginger & cinnamon to the mix). I agree with others that they are a little on the sweet side even with unsweetened applesauce, so the sugar can definitely be reduced.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  My hips & thighs thank you!  :)

these are delicious, but even more so considering how much healthier they are than 95% of desserts! i took some of the suggestions to increase the spices, and also tossed in a little vanilla. the cooking spray on the fingers tip definitely helped stop the sticking. with these minor changes, this recipe is worthy of all 5 stars. i will DEFINITELY be making these again!

I thought the dough was too sticky to roll into the sugar, so I just put a heaping teaspoons onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets.  They came out beautiful.  They are very good for a low fat cookie.

Really amazing, especially for a low fat recipe! I used light butter and extra spices and molasses. Cooked them for 7 minutes, perfectly soft and chewy. Excellent with lemon curd spread on top!

This cookie is way to sweet.  I used only 1 1/4 cups of sugar as one review suggested and it was still to sweet.
I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.  this is soft cookie.  The dough was sticky but I was warned from other reviews.   I took out all my cookie sheets and balled all the cookie dough at the same time.  Then I baked the cookies.   I think if you reduce the sugar this would be a 4 or 5 star recipe.

I love spice cookies and cakes, and I decided that I just had to try this recipe. Not a dissapointment! Delicious, spicy, sweet cookies. They were gone by the day after I made them, so apparently they are pretty popular with the rest of my family as well. We like cookies chewy, and they were just perfect at six minutes. Very rarely has it happened that the given time in a recipe is actually how long I cooked it (our oven tends to run a little hot).

 I did find the dough to be a bit on the sticky side. It was pretty simple to deal with though. After every four or five cookies, I rinsed my hands off in cold water and dried them. Piece of cake, and worked like a charm. This recipe will be fun to play around with. I might try using honey instead of molasses, and substituting spices, just to see what I come up with.

Pretty good for low-fat cookies, and I figured out that each 1 TBS-sized dough worth of cookie is equal to 1 Weight Watcher point, which is the diet I am on.  I baked them on parchment paper to keep them from sticking.  I also used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of clove in place of the Allspice since I didn't have any.  I chilled the dough for 30 minutes after making it, before trying to make them into balls, to cut down on the stickiness that others complained about.  With these adjustments, it worked out really well.

UPDATE:  After seeing how the first batch turned out, they don't spread at all and remain kind of thick if that's how you placed them.  On the second batch, I smashed each cookie's dough in my hand until it was pretty thin, like a pancake height, so that it would 'crip' more on this next batch.

FINALLY, PERFECTION:  To add a little dash of extra sweetness without increasing the calories much, I melted 3 TBS of butterscotch chips and used a pastry brush to brush each baked cookie with a little melted butterscotch.  Now they are PERFECT!  I'd give it a 4.5 star now.

Great low-fat cookie!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour, then followed other reviewers and added more spices. Delicious with some warm peaches and whipped cream!

I thought this recipe was great! I made sure to read all the comments left before i started making them. I thought that it may cause trouble but for 0.3g fat per biscuit, i couldn't refuse! So i started making them and put less sugar in than stated. After i'd added everything i was very surprised becuase i was expected a gooey mixture that would need refridgerating. But my mixture came our perfect for biscuits, i was a little worried it wasn't gooey enough! But i baked them and they came out delicious! So i think everyone should half the recipe first to make sure it works for them, and then once they've cracked it, make more! Great recipe :) thanks!

My husband loves ginger snap cookies! I tried this recipe last night and they turned out wonderful! I did add about 2 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp or more of cinnamon as well as more ginger so they tasted the way I wanted them to taste. I also followed another comment about the sugar and skimmed it down to 3/4 cups of sugar. Also washing your hands inbetween cookies was another helpful comment-this is really sticky dough. I cooked the cookies no more than 7.5 minutes because I wanted them soft and chewy. Excellent recipe even if followed to the 't'! Thanks again allrecipe community!

I used whole wheat flour and also doubled the spices, and added 1tsp cinnamon. Next time I will use maybe 1tsp vanilla as well, and brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar in this recipe, seems to be lacking just a little something. But this is a great and easy recipe.

I have made these very sweet treats twice and found them easy to make and eat but would make tiny adjustments next time.  I would substitute 1 teaspoon cinammon, 1 teaspoon ginger and cut way back on the allspice, or omit and use 1/4 teaspoon of cloves instead , and cut back on the sugar. Also, 2 tablespoons of margarine or butter could improve the taste subtley. A few grains of salt could also smooth out the taste. For calorie-reduced recipes, taste has to be spot on to satisfy or else our diets are at risk. The recipe made no reference to unsweetened applesauce which would also reduce the sweetness and calories.

These cookies are so yummy! I always bake them so they are chewy - around 8 minutes. They're soft and sweet and spicy. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very difficult to make. The dough is very stiff and crumbly. I ended up adding 1/8 cup of vegetable oil to bind everything together. The taste is ok. I originally made the Grandmother's Gingersnaps recipe and those came out PERFECT. Of course, not as healthy!

I reduced the sugar significantly and increased the ginger, added cinnnamon and cloves, as others did, and squashed the dough down.  I appreciate that these are "virtuous" cookies, but they are heavier and less crispy than I prefer, although the taste is good.

Yes, for a low fat cookie these are a tasty bite. The dough was really sticky so I had to wet my fingers every two or three balls. But other than that they're yummy.

As an 8 mo pregnant person with Gallstones (can't have surgery until after the baby and controlling it with an ultra low-fat diet), I'm always on the look-out for non-fat or very low-fat recipes that will satisfy pregnancy cravings.  I tried a ginger "snap" recipe several months ago and they came out very cakey.  I ran across this recipe today and decided to try it.

First of all, I forgot to cream the sugar into the margarine so I added an additional 1/8 cup of sugar and kind-of creamed the sugar into that.  I also added cloves, mace and cinnamon to the recipe (I really like spicy cookies).  

To those who complain about the stickiness of the dough here's a tip.  Drop blobs into the reserved sugar from a spoon.  You can use the sugar to help roll the balls and it really doesn't stick to your hand very badly.

I cooked them on a Silpat for 15 minutes and they actually turned out crunchy.  Yeah!  The first pan I didn't press down and they started to rise too much for me, so while they were in the oven I pressed them with a spatula.  Seemed to work.  The next pans I pressed down before baking.  

I'm not sure why people say they are too sweet.  For me, there is no such thing as a "too sweet" cookie!  It's the sugar content that helps them crisp up in the absence of the fat.

These cookies tasted great but I had a hard time trying to work with the dough. First of all, I think using less applesauce would help--because the dough is very moist, and impossible to roll into balls. I ended up just plopping spoonfulls of it on a cookie sheet. It might also help to refrigerate the dough as well. Second of all, I wanted chewy cookies so I baked them for less time--this left me with cookies that fell apart when I tried to remove them. I decied to put them in for longer and make crisper cookies--but this proved to be even more of a challenge. I couldn't even the the things off the cookie sheet they stuck so well. They're reallly tasty--but I'm not sure if it's worth all the effort.

I was disappointed in these cookies. The dough was very sticky and even though I used non-stick cookie sheets, the cookies still stuck to the sheets. However, they're not bad for lower fat cookies.

These turned out okay, but they were awfully sugary, or at least the one I tried five minutes out of the oven. Maybe it was my mistake but i could have sworn I measured correctly. I didn't even roll them ni the sugar. My father (junk food addict) just declared them, "mmm, pretty good!"

Very good cookie indeed-particularily like the fact that there is barely any fat in the recipe.  Next time i will add cinnamon and clove instead of allspice-just to vary the recipe.
