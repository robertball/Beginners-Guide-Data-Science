This is very good, but something is missing with the directions. The oven temperature should be adjusted to about 350° maximum of 375° after the eggplant has cooked the first time. Also, if it's meant to be in the oven for an hour at least cover it with foil so the cheese doesn't burn.

I agree with the other posters, the temp needed to be adjusted and I foil it for the first 40 min. then uncover the remainder.

Came out great, healthier than frying eggplant for eggplant parm and easily as tasty. I followed the temperature modifications as noted. Thanks for the tip and the recipe.
