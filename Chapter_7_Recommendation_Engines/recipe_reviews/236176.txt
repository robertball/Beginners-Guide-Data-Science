I have been craving Italian sausage lately, and had a can of garbanzo beans that I hadn't been able to figure out what to do with. Allrecipes app to the rescue. This. Was. FABULOUS!!  I did make a some changes to the recipe, though, using what I had on hand: I used Italian seasoning (generously) instead of sage. I used fat free chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. My sausage was mild Italian pork sausage instead of turkey, and I didn't have parsley. I also added some orzo, to give it a little more "fill". It smelled and tasted like the sausage lentil soup from Carrabbas restaurant which is a family favorite. It was a big hit with my teenage boys. Definitely making it again.

Pretty good.... I used pork Italian sausage, 3 carrots, 3 stalks of celery, 1 large onion, NO mushrooms, extra garlic, and dry garbanzo beans.  Added about 6 cups of water plus a few beef bouillon cubes and cooked in my Instant Pot for about 35 minutes (I added the extra water to compensate for the dry beans).  Kept with the original seasoning but at the end decided to add some Italian seasoning at the end to top it off.  It was yummy, but I needed a bit more texture to it, so I added some ditalini pasta... So the recipe is great starting point and very forgiving if you need to just use what you have on hand!

Very good and easy. I sauteed onions then added sausage. When sausage brown I scraped fond clear with 2 TBSP of Marsala wine,  then  added carrots, garlic, beans my husband had soaked in water plus one can of Garbanzo beans, 3 chopped Fingerling potatoes, about a cup of beef broth  and a bay leaf. Couldn't find my sage so used 21 Gun Seasoning from TJ. I let it simmer and added fresh Dill and the parsley plus 4 oz Heavy Whipping cream. Wow so good! In high rotation here! I know, a lot of tweaking but this is a very adaptable recipe. Hats off to the submitter!

I made this last minute so I used regular Jimmy Dean sausage instead of turkey sausage and rosemary instead of sage. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. I used a quart of beef broth in place of bouillon cubes. I also added a bit of spinach (soup is where I can get the kids to eat vegetables). Everyone in the family LOVED this soup and requested that it be a family regular.

This was super tasty! I had a package of froze Italian veggies on hand so I used those with onion and white beans but kept everything else pretty much the same. The seasonings work really well together. Will make again! Oh I did also add just like 5 oz of low carb rotini pasta, otherwise my bf would turn his nose up at it. It made a good addition!

This was excellent! I was missing some ingredients to make my usual sausage soup recipe so tried this one instead, and it's a keeper! I made a few minor adjustments: added one more cup of water, added about 1.5tbsp tomato paste, and used cannellini beans instead of garbanzos. Also I used pork sausage since that's what I had on hand, and baby portabello mushrooms. We didn't have a drop left! Will definitely make it again.

I have made this several times and everyone loves it.  I always use hot sausage for a kick.  We really love this!  I double the batch so I have some to freeze!

I've made this soup twice this month & am prepping my grocery list for a third, it's that good. I took cues from other reviewers & subbed Italian seasoning for the sage, chicken broth (made from skin & bones of oven-roasted chicken) instead of water, omitted beef bouillon. Wonderful stuff!

Perfect lunch for a snow day. Just happened to have a bundle of parsley I didn't want to waste when I came across this recipe.

Delicious!   Husband loved it. I added a soup bowl of kale for nutrition and color.
