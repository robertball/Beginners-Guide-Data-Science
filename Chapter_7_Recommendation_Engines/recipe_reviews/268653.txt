These are excellent and perfect as written. This comes as no surprise to me though. This makes the 7th recipe I've made from this recipe submitter and they have all been 5 stars. I haven't always loved my air fryer but thanks to Bren and her recipes, I do now. These potatoes cooked perfectly and were super simple to make. I highly recommend you try these.

Very good. BUT....I only had to roast them in my air fryer for 8 minutes! I would just say they all vary, be sure to take the basket out and shake them up and put them back in at 4-5 minute increments. I’m glad I did, otherwise they would have come out hard as a rock! But I do love the flavor and crispness these had! Thanks for sharing!

Simple recipe that came out just right- tasty, moist and slightly crunchy on the outside (but you must take out the potatoes right away without letting them sit inside the air fryer). I have a 6-quart air fryer so I made 1.5lbs of mini Yukon potatoes at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and I didn’t even have to turn them. This is the easiest and best roast potatoes I’ve ever made!

Easy and delicious. I used the multicolored small potatoes and cut them in half, not quarter. Will make often - having them tonight in fact!

Love it.  My family loved it.  They came out browned and crispy.  The only change that I made was,  I used olive oil instead of avocado oil. Tasted great.  Will you  make often.

Maybe I didn't use the right potatoes - the insides weren't fluffy and the outside was a little chewy. What type of "baby potatoes" are best to use? I used little multi colored ones.

These were delicious. I used small golden potatoes cut in 4ths. My air fryer cooked them in about 16 minutes. It took no time to prepare. This is my new go-to for a breakfast and dinner side.

They tasted very good, but a little dry.  I think I could have cooked them for a few minutes less.  Overall, my first time using my air fryer and I love it.

Great potatoes!  Pretty perfect.  Suggestions: add a little more oil for a little more crunch,  thyme and or chopped green onion.
