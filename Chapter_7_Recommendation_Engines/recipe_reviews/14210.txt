Just average.  It would be better to use mini tortellini (my guests were cutting their tortellini's in half before eating them).  I added 1 minced garlic clove and 1 tsp. oregano due to previous comments that the recipe was bland, and I did increase the amount of the dressing.  O.k., but I won't make it again.

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl party.  Everyone loved it and I plan on making it again.  I used a flavored feta cheese from the supermarket which gave the salad a little extra flavor.  I am adding this recipe to my collection.  Thanks!

This was a very tasty pasta salad---great for a warm summer day! I doubled the chicken for my husband's sake and marinated it first in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and fresh chopped oregano before baking it. Because I don't love olives, I used a small can (2.25 oz), which seemed to be plenty. Also, I substituted a yellow bell pepper for a green one; they seem less bitter to me. Don't forget to add salt and pepper to the marinade!

Great recipe!  Have been making it for a couple of years.  I too, have used "spiced" feta and doubled the dressing.  Also added more walnuts (love the walnuts!).  Also added chick peas for a change. I have made this for company, baby showers and new Moms - it's always a request.  Yummy!

This was easy and relatively quick, but bland.  I was longing for other spices- maybe some ginger, garlic, cilantro, etc.

Added note...I made this again and I left out the oil, used a bit more honey, added rice wine vinegar and hot pepper flakes; it was much improved.  The lemon and honey complemented each other and weren't overwhelmed by the oil.  Better for you too!

My mother in law and I personally really liked this salad but my picky husband and father in law didn't even try it.  The cold pasta was wonderful-dont over cook it!  I needed to chop the veggies a bit smaller, but they were fine.  I will make this again for parties and family gatherings, but I cant make it at home for my husband wont touch it.  I added more lemon juice and the honey was a great addition.  Didn't have walnuts- thats okay though- dont really like nuts.  Overall a nice cool summer recipe.

Not bad but nothing special, either.  Perhaps my having left walnuts out caused the recipe to be blander than it should have been.

I loved the light flavor of the dressing for this salad!  The lemon, walnut and honey combination is flavorful.  I used orange/yellow peppers, left out olives (personal preference) and forgot to add the feta before the picture!  I used leftover grilled chicken in recipe.

Awesome! This is a huge favorite with my family. I make it either as a main dish or omit the chicken to make a side dish. The lemon favor is very unusual, and makes for a great summery pasta salad.

Yummmm.  Wonderful treat.  Worked well to take to work.  I actually looked forward to my lunch.  Of course I added sea salt, white pepper and a little punch of turkish pepper and tabasco!

I was skeptical of this recipe, but pleasantly surprised with the outcome! I made a few changes: added lettuce and toasted the walnuts (seems to take the bitterness away). The dressing was very good and we really enjoyed this meal!

Yum!  I substituted some things that were unavailable and it still came out great.  I would serve it as a main dish, not a salad because of the time needed to chop and me being lazy.

This recipe was good but a little too 'gourmet' for our tastes. The lemon is a wonderful compliment to the tortelli but it also overpowers the other foods a bit. If you like tart, try it! ;)

I really loved this salad:  it was quick, easy and different.  The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce recipe and thought it was much improved.  I also used canned chicken which, although it's not as good as chicken breast, made it much quicker.

I am a huge pasta salad fan, but this seemed to be missing something.  I thought the taste was rather bland and dry.  I don't know if doubling up on the dressing would make a difference.  I served this to company and they didn't seem too impressed.  I may try this again but add more ingredients to give it a little more "zing"

Not great, not bad either.  This is a very different pasta salad.  The lemon dressing was a little overwhelming for me, as was the onion.  I served the feta cheese on the side because I don't like it and my husband does.  There is a lot of chopping and the recipe is more time consuming than it is worth.

I have made this a couple of times. Hubby really likes this, but not most other Mediterranean foods. Made more "dressing" and added more chicken. Hint, be sure to fully cook the tortellini, otherwise it becomes a little hard and chewy once chilled.  Good leftover.

Wow!  What a great meal.  I was looking for a cool, main dish, and filling salad for our hot summer nights, and this is the one!!  I was very skeptical that my picky husband wouldn't like it.  So I cut down the walnuts, didn't have green bell peppers, so I used celery, didn't have honey, so I used maple syrup.  And he (and I) had two helpings each!  Very filling, very delicious!  Can't wait to make it for a pot luck type of outing, just to hear the rave reviews!

This is great, made it a few times always replacing ingredients with wathever I have available.. first time I tried it as it is and it was great! Second time I used tuna instead of chicken breast which was also good. Third time I used gammon and was also OK but prefer it with chicken. Also I prefer pine nuts than walnuts but that's just my opinion. Gonna do it again tonight.. and I've recommended it to friends.. yummy!!

Yes a very tasty recipe indeed!!! Def. double the amount of dressing and add more walnuts. The walnuts really gave a nice texture as well as taste. I added the chick peas as someone below suggested and found them to be a great addition. You can't go wrong with this dish! Yummy summer dish :)

This was a wonderful salad. I also added a garlic clove as well as some fresh basil for more flavor.

Have made this countless times because I'm a freak about lemony flavored things and because it is such a unique twist on pasta salad.  Far superior to the typical rotini/italian dressing staple.  The bowl is always empty or close to empty when I take it to potlucks.  That being said, after making several times, I've learned to scale back on the amount of peppers and onion because otherwise, they can overrun the salad.  You really want the honey/lemon/walnuts to be the star.  Also, I've learned to almost double the amount of dressing, since that is what makes the salad.  This salad is quite a bit of work though, so only make for those you really like.

This recipe was easy to make and everyone loved it!  I used a couple cans of canned tomatoes to save time, and it still came out great.  Will definitely make it again.

I find that the peppers clash too much with the honey dressing.  After making it once, I made my own version.  
I removed peppers, added chunked artichoke hearts, kept the seasoned feta as others suggested, kalamata olives instead of black, and used 3 small cans of tuna in water instead of chicken.  I wanted the tuna salad, hehe.  It came out delicious and made a wonderful warm day's dinner.

Love it! I used ravioli instead of tortellini. Next time I will use less olive oil... I thought it was too oily. Also added cherry tomatoes.

Tasty and light. I slivered the peppers into half-matchstick size cuts to help distribute the flavor throughout.  Would make again.

A good recipe.  The dressing was good. You should definitely alter the veggies to your preferences.  I added tomatoes and left out the onion.  I realized I'm not really a fan of green bell pepper, so next time will just use one red bell pepper.  Next time, I'll also add more walnuts, and just crush them myself instead of processing them, so the pieces are bigger.  My husband thought it needed more Feta (I used half a package).  We don't eat meat so made it without the chicken.

I love this recipe!  It's a great summer dish, very light.  I usually add a dash of basalmic vinegar.  I just like the taste and it's a good complement to the lemon. And I leave out the chicken when I want it to be just a pasta dish.  This is my husband's favorite pasta salad.

This was a great summer lunch idea.  Served with sweet pita flat bread and black bean and corn salsa and chips on the side.  Amazing flavor and colors.  The lemon zest really came through.  We used miniature sweet peppers cross cut to form small pinwheels...great colors.

My husband and I thought that this was great. The kids weren't liking the lemon flavor. I think that next time , I will reduce the amount of lemon juice. I also used karo syrup and did not use the red onions.

I thought this recipe was fantastic-I wish there was a 4 1/2 star rating I could give.  Very full of flavor-excellent combination of ingredients.  I will definitely make this again (and this time wait until my girlfriend isn't pregnant, making it so she can't eat it because of the feta cheese!)

This is a great summer dinner salad.  It was a bit bland though so I added some red pepper flakes. I also added a can of drained artichoke hearts, to add to the vegetable quotient.

This is a real tasty recipe. I also added some chopped walnuts in the salad which gave it an extra crunch and sweetness. I also had to substitute yellow onion, (only onion on hand) and it wasnt too strong. Great weeknight dinner!

Thank you! Super easy go-to meal for when we have visitors. They loved it as the main course for lunch! I especially loved the crisp, raw veggies during summer time. I also love that the dressing is simple, healthier, and more delicious than any bottled dressing.

After reading the reviews, I made a couple of changes.  I didn't have any Feta Cheese on hand, so I used crumbled-up Bleu Cheese - since we like it.  Also, l substituted chopped (roasted & salted) Pistachios, because that's what I had on hand.  I noticed that several reviewers mentioned that the recipe was a bit 'bland', so I added in some of my favorite (go to) seasoning....'Salad Supreme' by "McCormick".  I was very happy with the final result, and we all enjoyed it.  I plan to make a much larger amount for our upcoming "Labor Day" cookout.

This was delish, w/a few tweaks; doubled the lemon juice/zest & olive oil mixture & added a minced garlic clove (will add two next time) I baked two small chicken breast seasoned w/lemon pepper. Tossed everything together & let it dance (marinate) together in the fridge before serving. I halfed the peppers & onions (too much for my liking)& I used mixed cheese tortellini.

I followed this recipe to the letter. It's so delicious and since we had leftovers it was enjoyed for lunch also. I'm not sure that the chicken added much in the way of flavor, but if the recipe is used for a main meal the added protein is important. The lemon-honey dressing is outstanding. I plan on making this again throughout this summer and many more to come. Thanks!

This was simply delicious!!  It was time consuming to put together, but was well worth it.  Me and my family ate leftovers of this for 2 days and it just kept getting better.  Since I hate vinegar, there are not many pasta salads that have ingredients that sound good to me.  I will be making this again!!

I'm sorry about this review, but we didn't like this at all.  There were more peppers and onions than anything, that's all I could taste.  The lemon sauce was good, but you couldn't taste it in the salad.  It was more like a red/orange pepper and onion salad instead of torellini.  I really wanted to like this and hoped it would taste great, but I made it, no one really liked it.  I'm sorry, I feel bad giving it such a poor review, but it's my honest opinion and I will not make it again. :(

I halved this recipe to make enough for 2, but ended up with plenty of leftovers for the next day.  I used fresh lemon juice so it definitely has a strong citrus flavor.  I used Roast Sticky Chicken from this site for the chicken.  I thought it tasted great and was perfect for a summer Fri night dinner.

AWESOME. This has become a standard request when I attend pot lucks, barbeques, graduations and the like.  My kids love this salad too!
