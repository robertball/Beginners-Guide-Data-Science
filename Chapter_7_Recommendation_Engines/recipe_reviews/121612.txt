I made this for our family's Chistmas brunch - what a big hit!  I even had to eliminate the bacon, for dietary reasons, so I added more peppers and it was still tasty!

Great. The cerial adds a sweetness to this. I did not have any swiss cheese on hand so I substituted Montery Jack. Still came out good. Will make again.

I have made this recipe 3 different times now.  I pretty much make it as written, but with "more"... I use a whole medium red onion, about a half cup each of the red and green peppers, about 1/2 tsp of the white pepper and a whole pound of cooked bacon crumbled on top.  I also used Monterey Jack cheese instead of the swiss and cheddar (probably about 1 1/2 cups total) and I used garlic salt instead of plain.  I did not add the bacon to the egg mix, but rather crumbled it on afterwards as a topping.  It is pretty, but I think next time I will not put it on top until about the last 15 minutes of baking time, as the bacon got a little too hard.   We LOVE this recipe and sometimes I just get to thinking about it...then I have to make it..haha.  I think all the colors look nice together and the tastes are mild and complementary of each other!

My husband said this is the worst thing I've ever made.....I was so intrigued by the Wheat Chex- but I think that's why it was so bad.  We threw it away.  Sorry!

I should give this a 5 because we ate the WHOLE thing! My only problem with it is the "soggy cereal" consistency. I didn't tell anyone else that it was cereal instead of bread and they all loved it. Next time,I'll try it with a little less of the cereal, perhaps 2 cups is too much. Taste was a 5 though!

Excellent.  I crunched up the Chex mix in my hands before adding it to the mixture.  This helped with an even distribution.  I would add some Pablano peppers next time to give it a Mexican flare.  We all loved it a lot
