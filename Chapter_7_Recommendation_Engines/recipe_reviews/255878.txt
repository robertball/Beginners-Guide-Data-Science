This is perfect.  I am the only oatmeal eater in this house so I used the single serving and it was perfect.  I did not use the nuts as I did not have any but, I will in the future.  Perfect bowl of oatmeal.

My son loves this oatmeal.  It is a quick healthy breakfast that can be changed up, depending what you have on hand, very easily.  I will be making this very often for breakfast.

So simple and tasty.  I usually have all ingredients on hand so that is an extra bonus.  My husband and I both love this!

This came out great! I toasted (double) the pecans with butter in the saucepan first. Removed the pecans, then added the milk and spices. Didn't really worry about the cooking times listed in the directions - just cook the oats until you have your desired consistency. Keep an eye on it and keep stirring, otherwise it will likely bubble over onto your stove top.

This recipe is awesome.  The toasted pecans make it so.  I toasted them on the stove w/butter.  I use real oat meal; not "quick oats" .  If you can't wait 5 minutes for quality, go eat at McD or BK.  This is healthy AND good.
