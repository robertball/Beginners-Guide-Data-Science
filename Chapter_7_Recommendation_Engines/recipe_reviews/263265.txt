Could not give it a top rating. A good marinade but it is missing something to give a wow factor. The sauce was strange with the rice vinegar.   I will make it again and try tweaking the ingredients.

We live in Alaska and eat a lot of salmon this recipe is fantastic and one of my new favorites. This amount of marinade is easily enough for 1 - 1.5 lbs of salmon especially if you use a ziplock bag. The recipe sauce amount is about right for one 8 oz fillet. I made per the recipe using fillets of King salmon except I cooked on the grill skin side down without flipping. The skin should stick to the grill and you can slide a spatula between the skin and the flesh once finished to yield a perfect skinless fillet. Be sure to not over cook and dry out the salmon. This is not terribly spicy so consider doubling the sriracha if you like a little heat. I served over rice per previous reviewer s suggestion. I will definitely make this again.

This was great! I will certainly make this again we have salmon a lot and this was a great deviation from our normal recipe.
