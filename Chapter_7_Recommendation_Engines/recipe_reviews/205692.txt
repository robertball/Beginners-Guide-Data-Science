I do apologize for the recipe being runny. I am going to try to edit it if they'll let me because I forgot to add in the directions that if the sauce turns out runny, add about a Tbs of cornstarch in about 4 oz of milk or cream and stir until completely dissolved and add the cream mixture on stove. Bring to a boil and immediately turn heat on low or off. sauce will thicken after a minute or so. Thank you all for your reviews. :-)

Nice recipe but 3 minutes per side for scallops is way too long! Scallops will cook in half that time or less.

This was a very good sauce! I made a vegetarian version of it using veg stock...substituted fresh basil for parsley and added a little parmesan to thicken it (since I only had milk). I whisked in a tbsn of butter at the end to finish the sauce and served it over artichoke ravioli...complete with sauteed asparagus and artichokes! Seriously by far the best way I've ever roasted garlic...turned out perfect! Thank you for the recipe.:)

I thought this was definitly a keeper! Only changed one thing. The sauce did have to be thickened, and I did so with butter and flour. Did it separatly then added it to the Garlic Cream Sauce.

Pretty good. The cream ended up quite liquid and not quite thick enough. Otherwise tasty and easy.

This recipe was sooo delicious! I doubled it and even added in the 4oz of cream with the cornstarch but I still had to simmer for quite a while to get it to thicken. No problem though - just will remember it for next time.:o) Other than that it was fab and tasty!

Love this recipe. By mistake I had added the cream to the broth before reducing. The second time I followed the directions but liked the sharper taste from the mistake. Have since continued that way and been adding enough white sauce to extend and thicken. Any recommendations on which kind of garlic works best here?

Great recipe! I did make some changes tho. I wrapped the scallops in prosciutto. Then I combined olive oil lemon zest salt pepper and a bit of lemon juice. Brushed that on the scallops (both sides) just before broiling them. I made sauce as written and I added spinach. I will definitely be making this again:) Thank you for sharing!

Perfect as is - do not add mushrooms. Used it on scallops. Nice light and fresh.

I love the cooking style for the scallops and the sauce is quite good. Unfortunately I haven't quite mastered the sauce yet after 2 attempts (my fault for not following the directions!) although I am close! The first time I used an elephant garlic bulb which didn't roast up to the needed paste-like consistency. It yielded a good flavor but was very stringy and I had to strain most of it from the sauce. The taste was still good but I ended up making more work for myself! Tonight I used a regular garlic bulb which roasted perfectly but I used half and half instead of heavy cream. Even after adding corn starch and flour it still didn't thicken to where i wanted it so I was a bit bummed but the flavor was still good. We'd also cooked some halibut and the sauce went nicely with that as well. I even saw one of my guests soaking up the last bits with her bread:). Next time I'm following the recipe as written and I'm sure it will be outstanding. Thanks for sharing:)

Could have used a little more garlic especially since it was roasted. Overall a great recipe!

It needs a thickening agent the sauce is too runny. Maybe some flour or cream of tartar.

The sauce is definitely what makes this dish! The scallops are not really the star of the dish as it's just simple in flavors. The cream sauce is drinkable! If I was having bread I would love to have a baguette to dip the remainder in. If you have any of the sauce left over I would recommend pouring over some steamed clams or mussels.

The sauce was runny but that's easily fixed. I also like the fact that with this recipe you can get creative and add additional things like risotto lots more of yummy veggies like spinach cabbage chopped zucchini and capers ripe olives. Mmmm Yummy! Get in my belly!:)
