Very good, cheap & easy! I play softball on the weeknights so I need something I can whip up fast after work...this works! I boil my chicken in my yummy spices & then shred it. Instead of cooking the salsa/beans in the microwave, I bring them to a boil in a pot & then throw in the chicken & let it all simmer together - more flavor gets into the chicken & blends better, I think. Like another reviewer, I did add more salsa (almost double) but thats just my taste preference...also I throw in a little cayenne for an extra kick! Very good & very easy!

This was so good. My husband loved it and he is a VERY picky eater. But I altered the recipe. Here's what I did. First, I put the rice in my rice cooker. Added a table spoon of butter, salt, water until it covers the top of the rice, closed the lid then turned it on (when the rice cooker clicks, that means it's done cooking. It's so much nicer than cooking rice on the stove. You just turn it on then leave it alone.) I then cut 3 chicken breasts into chunks, put 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a skillet and put the chicken in it once it's hot. While the chicken was cooking I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, parsley and cayenne pepper. Then I stirred in a can of pinto beans (I didn't have black beans. Pinto beans work just fine.) I let the chicken and beans cook for a little longer. Then added a cup of jalapeño juice from a jalapeño jar, double the salsa (I use on the border salsa), mixed in 2 American cheese slices (stir until melted), put mixture on top of rice then sprinkle grated cheese on top with cilantro (my husband likes everything cheesy). It was awesome. The jalapeño juice, extra salsa and tons of cheese gave it lots if flavor. I omitted the sour cream. We aren't fans of sour cream.

Excellent recipe. I did up the salsa to 1 full cup to give it a little more zing. It was a big hit and I had requests for the recipe!

I added vegetable recipe mix, a yellow sweet pepper and some chicken broth, then added the the salsa and chicken and cooked that all together. Didn't have cheddar, used 3 velveta slices in the mixture and broke up a slice of white American per bowl. Turned out amazing!  Woulda been even better in a tort or with tortilla chips!!

Wonderfully quick, nutritious meal for the family. I added some frozen veggies and used brown rice instead of white rice. Very well received by the mob in my house!!

We loved this recipe.....I served corn tortillas with it and it was outstanding. I added half a cup of salsa instead of the 1/4 cup.

I used pollock (imitation crab meat) instead of chicken as I had some lo in fridge, so left out cheese.  Increased salsa to 1/2 cup and more cilantro - I love it.  Excellent mix of flavours. Very quick to make and much enjoyed by husband! He's not normally one for changes so I felt this a double plus, especially as he went around friends describing the meal as if he'd created it!!!!!

This was perfect because my husband is very picky. I did take out salsa, shred the chicken with a hand mixer, and I used mozzarella instead of cheddar because I had extra of it. It tasted great!

I made some alterations to this as others did and it was a big hit. I used Goya rice and 12 minutes in the instant pot. My people are picky and don’t like chunky salsa so I used members mark salsa and mixed it with the beans to warm on the stove. Cooked and cubed the chicken with olive oil and kicken chicken seasoning and mixed it with the beans and a little cheese. They loved it. No complaints which is an accomplishment all in itself!! Go to meal now!

Very good and easy. I had leftover rice and shredded chicken. I just added the chicken to the beans and salsa in the microwave to reheat, and added to the warmed rice.

Quick and easy dinner that is hearty enough to please my husband and teenaged son! I have made this several times and prefer making it on the stovetop. I boil the chicken ahead of time with spices and then shred it before adding. Tasty!

Very Good!! I used 90 second chicken flavored rice. I used a small jar of Spicy  Salsa and I cut up the chicken and cooked it on the stove with 2 tablespoons of butter. I also crunched up Tostito chips on the top.

Was really fast and easy! I changed a few things: I boiled one chicken breast (it was just for me and my husband) in chicken broth with a little salt, three peppercorns, and a bay leaf until the chicken was done. I put a half a can of Rotel in the rice (again only makes two servings). I only slightly drained the beans and added taco seasoning to taste.
