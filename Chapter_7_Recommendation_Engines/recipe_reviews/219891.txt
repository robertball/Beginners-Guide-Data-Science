Made this for an office party and it disappeared so fast I wish I had made a double batch.  I did make a couple of small changes.  First, I used roasted garlic hummus since I prefer that flavor.  Also I seeded the cucumber and tomatoes before chopping to keep the mixture from being too watery.  Finally I used greek seasoning and a pinch of salt instead of just oregano.  I find that the mint and other spices in the greek mix just had a better flavor.  Layered in a 9" pie plate and served with pita chips, carrots, and celery.  Huge hit!!!

This is a great start for a really fun appetizer.  It's even better when you add in a few more layers.  I start with lemon hummus instead of the red pepper - it's bright and tangy and we like that taste with the other ingredients.  Then we use a thin layer of tzatziki, then the layer of kalamata olives, then add in a layer of artichoke hearts, then the feta, and then the cucumber, the tomato, and we top it with a good sprinkling of short sliced red onion.  We don't use the oil or oregano - just let the flavors of the dip stand on their own.  I also place a small dish of pepperocinis on the side for those who like that extra little bite with the dip.  Serve with some good sea salt pita chips and you are good to go.  Add wine or a cocktail and it's a great girl's night meal.

Flavor packed dip using fresh garden tomatoes and cucumbers.  I've recently acquired a taste for hummus, and this was a delicious dip using it.  I made this in a pie pan, omitting the olives, due to personal taste.  Served this with pita chips, tortilla chips and crackers.  Everyone wanted a different "dipper" for the dip.  Very good, and I will make again.  Thanks k8e204 for sharing.

This is quite good. I'm trying to eat more veggies so doubled the tomato and cucumber, but omitted the oil(I reduce or omit it whenever I can). Otherwise, I made half as written and half adding 4 oz greek yogurt and some diced red onion and greek peppers. It was good both ways but I definitely like what the yogurt added to it.I used a 9x9 dish and thought it still worked well with the added ingredients. Leftovers made nice pita sandwiches. I really enjoy greek salads and never thought of a dip, thanks for the great idea.

Took this to a get together and it was a big hit.  Everyone enjoyed the dish even the picky teenagers, as a matter of fact, one of the teens grabbed it from the table where the adults were congregating and wisked it off.

My family absolutely loved this dip! It has many flavors that truly add to making this so wonderful! I used red pepper and garlic hummus, but other than that, I followed the recipe. We used pita chips, triscuits, celery, carrots, peppers to dip with. This will be a favorite in our home! Thanks so much for sharing as I feel that this is fairly healthy to snack on.

Okay, so I did add another layer to this. I only did it because I had to use up an artichoke/asiago dip...so I layered that on top of the hummus. I also added a bit of red onions. My or my this tasted amazing. AND it will hold up if you seed the tomatoes and cucumbers. Love love love this as an alternative to plain ol' hummus and what I typically do: a Mexican dip. Thanks so much for this!

yum oh. I’d had this before & forgot how good it is. I did slice tomatoes & let them sit in a mesh strainer with a bit of salt  ~15 min or so, just like the taste better. Used plain hummus & lemon flowered olive with a bit of dill, &  oregano.

I needed something new to serve the family and this was perfect. Everyone loved it. It is a little messy though with all that olive oil dripping from the cracker or chip. I will reduce it next time and see if anyone notices.

Made this for our family Christmas party and I am just glad that we doubled the recipe. It's an easy recipe to customize to your liking. We added a layer of tzatziki and used roasted garlic hummus.

Made my own red pepper hummus from Bush's humous packs. Gave it even more flavor but not a lot of work.

Very simple and tasty.  I would recommend removing seeds from cucumber to keep it from getting soupy.

This dip is absolutely incredible!  Took this to a baby shower and it was the hit of the food table!  I changed absolutely nothing except maybe put about 25% more chopped olives than it called for.  All other proportions were the same and I DID add the olive oil over the top which blends the flavors.  I made this about 10pm the night before the shower, covered and refrigerated it and served at 1pm the next day.  That is one of the keys to success---refrigerating overnight.  Served it with baked pita chips.  My absolutely new go-to party dip!

I've been waiting to try this one for a while and it was so worth the wait! I made it as an app for Christmas. It's ridiculously easy to make, and it's a nice, bright contrast to the heavy meats and cheeses that come with the holidays. I mostly stuck to the recipe with a few small changes. I didn't measure out anything (besides the pre measured hummus). I just used as much as I thought would taste good. I also added just a bit of red onion. I seeded the cucumber and tossed it in dill, parsley and oregano. Served with Stacey's "simply naked" pita chips. It was gone in minutes.

Served to guests and got rave reviews. I did chop all the vegetables very small which made it earlier to scoop.

I used Cherry tomatoes and plain hummus because I didn't know if everyone at the picnic liked hummus. A chef there put it on his hotdog and some of the other guest followed. They said it was amazing.

Made this exactly as recipe is written.  Very delicious as is, but next time I might add other ingredients such as chopped green onion or chopped mushroom just to experiment.  I had it with baked whole wheat pita chips from a recipe on here.  The two go perfectly together!

I made this for a family get together and everyone raved about it! Refreshing change from a tex-mex dip (refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, etc.) that our family also loves. Can be made in 10 minutes.

YUM!  I made this recipe for a girls night and it was a huge hit.  I forgot to drizzle on the olive oil and skipped the oregano and I don't think it was missed at all.  I served it with Town House pita crackers.

My family and I are having international dinners and I made this for it. We loved it. I followed the tip of another reader and took the seeds out of the cucumber and tomatoes. I also used one container each of roasted red pepper hummus and roasted garlic hummus. I will be making it for parties.

I have made this twice for gatherings, everyone always raves about it and asks for the recipe, I am shocked more people haven't tried it or reviewed it.  It is so good, so easy and so healthy.  I serve it with Pita chips, but Pita bread cut up would be good too.  Thank You K8e.
