This was perfect! Except I probably did something Chef John would gasp at horror at. Instead of gently letting cool water into the pot, after the cooking time was up I took the eggs out of the boiling water and immediately put them in ice water. Gently stirring until they were cool. It's how my Grandmother did it, it's how my Mom does it and frankly they turned out perfectly. I put a little water in a mason jar, added one egg at a time, shook vigorously and then I was able to peel the shell off in one continuous piece.

I tried this steaming method and cooked the eggs for  7 minutes because I prefer a softer yolk.  Fantastic!  The yolk was still a little runny and the egg was cooked perfectly.  Also used Chef John's suggestion for easy peeling - worked great.  This is now the only way I will make boiled eggs.  Love Chef John!

I use a small strainer to "slowly" lower the eggs into the hot water to avoid them cracking/breaking.

I have become the deviled egg person for church memorial suppers. I never know when I am going to have to make a batch of eggs. Any suggestions for getting eggs to peel when one does not have the luxury of time to let them age a week in the fridge?

I made it exactly as written except for steaming the eggs an extra thirty seconds or so. My eggs come from the neighbor's hens and are super extra jumbo large. They peeled beautifully, and no ugly green ring! I used half the eggs for the colored deviled egg recipe on this site, and the other half for the fried hard-boiled eggs recipe on this site, and they were great.

This is the best way to cook eggs. I love how the eggs peal and how the yoke is always perfect.

That was pretty darn neat!  I also like the way you cracked them under the cold water, so there  is no eggshell fighting. It looks like I'm snacking on a couple eggs tonight! Cool info. Thanx!!!

My yolks were a bit more set than I would have liked but I believe it was because I may have used smaller eggs. As the author says I think I just need to experiment with timings. Great straightforward recipe for someone who didn't have a clue though! Now I know where to start...thank you!

I personally love hard and a bit soft cooked eggs in the oven only. They taste so much better! I will never boil an egg again! Great idea, though!

Awesome, I've been meaning to make a 6 minute egg for the Shoyu Pork recipe on AR. This recipe calls for 9.5 minutes, so I experimented as the author suggested ......... perfect, ran cold water for 5 minutes, cracked the eggs as I began the rinse and the peel was that simple as stated .......wow thanks a bunch!

Chef John, perfect, excellent, you just nailed it.... I use a lot of your ideas and follow your receipts.  I never review as I just use receipts as A guide.  Thank you chef
