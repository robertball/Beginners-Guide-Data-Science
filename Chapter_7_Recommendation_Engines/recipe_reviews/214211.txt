You can't deny the healthy aspects of this recipe.  The only thing I might note is that flax seed needs to be cracked before eating.  If you don't, it passes through the body without releasing any of it's wonderful omega's.  I use an ordinary small coffee grinder that I keep exclusively for spices.  At any rate, this is a very versatile recipe.  The prunes and raisins can be replaced with your favorite fruit or nuts almost in infinite combinations.  I was thinking this is a great take to work recipe.  Just add hot water from the tap at the coffee machine and microwave for a minute or two.

Reading over the recipe I realized that I did not specific the need to grind the flax seed first. Sorry! I use about a tbs of GROUND flax seed or flax seed meal. Thanks for clarifying that Brenda:)

I like this recipe, it's a great quick porridge for some variety other than standard oatmeal.  I didn't expect the ingredients to make a thick porridge, but it's great.  I heat the water & fruit in the microwave for one minute and stir in the dry stuff.  I skip the honey and I top mine with non-dairy creamer for a delicious sweetness.

It is always best to grind the flax seed so that your stomach can digest the wonderful fibre that it has.

Great recipe!  Very simple to prepare and it tastes good.  We are having it about 3 mornings a week.  Thanks for sharing, I'll do the same.

An excellent quick and very nutrient dense breakfast.  I made it exactly as the recipe recommended, except I also ground the flax seeds.  It is a very "comforting" morning meal.  Thanks!

Full of fiber and a very filling breakfast, although I have to admit that I fixed this for dinner one night while the family ordered pizza.  I didn't want to blow my healthy eating routine and am glad I fixed this delicious dish.  I added 3 prunes and no raisins, but I can see that anything can be put into this recipe-dried cranberries, etc.

I made this for breakfast using what I had on handâ€¦.ground flax seed, oat bran, raisins, dried apricots, and oatmeal.  I liked it with a lot of milk and my grown son liked his with a generous amount of honey.  The recipe adds variety to my morning menu and it is quick and easy to prepare. I will make again including the other ingredients in the recipe.

This wasn't bad, but I won't make it again.
