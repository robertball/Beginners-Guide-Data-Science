This is a regular in our house! I use cream of mushroom soup and chicken broth to give the sauce some oomph and to make extra. You can also add green or white sauteed onions if you desire.  Adding some dry italian salad dressing mix to your flour will really help kick the flavor up a notch.  Don't forget to add cold water to your cornstarch!  The perfect partner for this is egg noodles.  A great recipe for weeknight or for company. Always a winner.

Super simple yet delicious!  No leftovers!  Served on top of white rice...makes a very nice looking dish.  Mix the cornstarch in some cold water before adding it to the hot pan, otherwise it will clump up.

I made  this into a serving size for 6 and used 1cup of wine plus 2 cups water for the 3 cups water.  I also added onions with the mushrooms when I sauted them.   I didn't pound the chicken just browned it then put them with the sauce over top in an oven at 350 for an hour.  It was so very, very good and easy.  My husband said it was as good as Olive Garden!

Thsi was fabulous. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of the water and used butter flavour spray and a little bit of olive oil. I forgot to pound the chicken thin so I had to cook it longer but it came out wonderful. I had to add a little more cornstarch and I used Mrs. Dash gralic and herbs seasoning in the flour mixture as well as with the chicken broth. I also steamed some broccoli and tossed that into the pan with the chicken and the mushrooms. Served over linguine and it was delicious and elegant. I will definitely make this again!!!

Many people made the comment that this recipe was a good base recipe- so I made a few changes and it was just yummy! The only changes I made were: I seasoned the flour with garlic powder, pepper & seasoning salt first and I sauted a chopped onion with the mushrooms. For ease I used chicken stock. I also added 1/4c fat free sour cream & a ton of pepper right before serving the dish. My family is full of picky eaters & they gobbled this up (after making sure there were no mushrooms visable on their plate!) The chicken was delicious & this recipe is a keeper!

This made for a nice, simple lunch!! I too used low-sodium chicken broth in place of the water, and fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned.  I also added a jar of diced pimentos to the gravy for color as well as some chopped onion, & a pinch of crushed rosemary. Served over Uncle Ben's Chicken & Wild Rice Pilaf and we really enjoyed this tasty dish! Will make it again - next time, I'll have to double this for dinner!!

So yummy and easy to make! I used light olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and omitted the butter. Substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillon granules & used 12 oz. fresh mushrooms, sliced, instead of canned. Tossed with spiral pasta. Delicious!

This recipe was great. The only changes I made were substituting the chicken broth for the water and chicken granules as others had suggested. Also, I added a packet of lipton onion soup to the sauce to add more flavor. Also used fresh mushrooms and it was amazing.

Great recipe!  It was fast and easy to make, and very tasty.  I would use more mushrooms and I only needed about half the flour.  One thing that I tried, and liked, after I removed the chicken and mushroomswas: add a little chardonnay and a little water to the pan, heat it up to get all the baked on stuff to mix together, let it reduce slightly, then pour it over the chicken and rice.  It added a faboulous flavor and my husband kept telling me how much he liked it.  If it gets too thick, mix a little conrstarch and hot water together and add it to the sauce.

This is a nice straightforward chicken dish. I made the following modifications: (1) instead of using water and bullion cubes, I used chicken stock and I only used about 3/4 cup; (2) I omitted the cornstarch because I didn't really need it; (3) Instead of canned mushrooms, I used fresh chopped crimini and white mushrooms; (4) Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil; (5) I used fresh parsley instead of dried parsley; (6) Instead of just a flour mixture, I dipped the chicken in a mix of a little flour, poultry seasoning, pepper, salt, and garlic powder.  It was nice, pretty easy.  Not amazing but good.

I took several people's tips and combined them. This is definitley a good base recipe that you can get creative with. I added garlic powder, rosemary, a little salt and alot of pepper to the flour. Cooked the chicken as stated. For the sauce, I added onion to the mushroom saute. I took a couple of users advice and mixed the cornstarch with about 3 Tbsp of water. I added the little bit of chicken broth I had on hand(about 1/4 cup), the cornstarch/water mixture, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 3 Tbsp milk, 1 Tbsp garlic powder, 1 tsp dried parsley (measurements are estimates). The sauce came out amazing! Served over egg noodles. Yum!

I loved it! I carmelized one large onion in olive oil with some minced garlic, then added the chicken (skinned split chicken breasts). I did not dredge the chicken in flour (unwanted extra calories). I then added fresh mushrooms and chicken broth instead of water. I doubled the amount of broth and added some pepper flakes for a little kick. I added a cup of rice to cook in the broth with the chicken and let the whole thing simmer for about 20 minutes.  Mmmmm...Okay, so I guess I've changed the recipe a lot...but it is a great base to start from!

The changes I made were leaving out the oil, butter, and flour. I used cooking spray and flour always makes the meat slimey. I also added about two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.

This recipe was very good, but I didn't like the taste of the canned mushrooms, so I used fresh, chopped alittle thick and added 1/4 cup of sherry to the sautee and it was awesome. My husband as well as my 4year old loved it.

Really flavorful! I added some red wine to the mushrooms (I always love the flavor I get from adding wine). The chicken was still moist in the inside. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe was very good.  Instead of the boullion, water and garlic powder, I used a roasted garlic flavored chicken broth.  It worked great.  I also used fresh mushrooms and they were wonderful in the sauce.  I served it over buttermilk biscuits. Mmmmmmmm!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but added some fresh chopped tarragon and a little cream to the sauce at the end. I served it with brown rice, green beans and butternut squash. I'll make it again.

Pretty good - but a little bit bland. Added onion powder and helped a little bit. Next time i plan to add saute'd onions. I didn't have any cornstarch in the house, so i mixed flour-cold water combo to thicken the sauce. That worked will. NOTE: If you use flour and water to thicking something, make sure the water is very cold otherwise the mixture is lumpy. Froze well too.

My husbands favorite chicken recipe, instead of the butter I use buttery pam spray, also use olive oil, fresh mushrooms and onion soup mix, and I use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  I would give more stars if I could.  Big hit in our house.

**Edit- I made it with mashed potatoes, it's a whole new dish! YUM!!**Good basic recipe. I too added chopped onions with the mushrooms, and added some seasoned salt to the flour, and then some to the sauce. I also used chicken broth instead of water. I'll definitely make it again, next time I'll serve it over mashed potatoes. My boyfriend said he's already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

...Super quick AND takes very little effort.  The only advice I have is to be sure to pound the chicken rather thin, use a heavy hand when seasoning the flour and use fresh mushrooms...I doubled the recipe and we were scraping the pan to get the last of the gravy. I served over brown rice and had a spinach and tomato salad to go with. Thanks Angela..will make this again!

I've made this a couple of times, and it seems to come out better with chicken broth (instead of boullion), extra cornstarch, fresh mushrooms and no onions.  Tasty and light.

Use fresh mushrooms and chicken broth- it makes a huge difference.  I also let it simmer for a bit longer than suggested and served it with rice...really easy and efficient recipe!  If you cut out the oil to save some cals it works well too.  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome.  I'm not a big mushroom lover, but I found myself going back for seconds.  I used fresh mushrooms and I think that made all the difference in the world.  I will defenitly make this again--and soon!

What a great looking dish! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned & didn't have chicken bouillon granules so I just used chicken broth to replace that & the water. The sauce didn't get as creamy as I expected but it turned out great!

Definitely a new favorite in my house. My fiancee couldn't stop going back and stealing mushrooms from the pan! A definite keep for my repertoire. Thank you for supplying this recipe.

Pretty darn good. I used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also used garlic cloves instead of the garlic powder. Ooo and chicken broth instead of the chicken bouillon granules. My whole family liked it.

This was really good and easy. I used fresh mushrooms and added a little white wine. This will be a regular for us from now on. I served it with fried polenta.

This was absolutely delicious. I tweaked it in so many different ways and I used chicken chops instead. In addition to what is called  for in recipe I used chicken bouillon cubes, chicken broth, onion powder, olive oil, vegetable oil and butter, salt-free seasoning, even half a teaspoon of raw sugar! No water though.

Quick & easy. Recipe would allow for added vegetables (I had some zucchini & carrot from my garden.) I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned and it turned out great!

I didnt know how much a packet of granules was....so i used 3 tsps.  I used fresh portobella mushrooms which were amazing in  this.  I didnt have any spare sauce to put over anything.  I did use 4 breast though without doubling the sauce.  it was still great.

I used fresh mushrooms and served over angel hair pasta. Other than that, I made it according to the recipe as listed. This wasn't a good recipe or a bad recipe. I'll probably try making this again, maybe add some onions, use white wine instead of water and serve with potatoes & a green vegetable instead of over rice or noodles.

Made this tonight, the first bite my husband went nuts and told me how good it was. The only things I did differently were season my chicken how I do usually before adding it to the flour. I added some finely chopped onion to the fresh mushroom saute, and added about a tbsp of flour mixed with the gravy to thicken it up to pour over mashed potatoes..very very good!

WOW! Delicious.  I pounded the chicken very thin so it won't take forever to cook.  I also seasoned the chicken before i added it to flour, it makes a big difference.  I used fresh mushrooms,and chicken broth instead of the bouillon.  Another thing don't add the cornstarch straight into the pan. In a seperate bowl mix it well with a little chicken broth or water and then add to pan. This prevents lumps. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very nice!  I omit bullion and use chicken stock instead of bullion and season the chicken before coating in flour.  I also add minced onion and garlic as I add the mushies.  YUM!

Very good recipe--I breaded and baked the chicken (and used tenders) to save on fat--it worked well.  The sauce is easy and great--I used chicken broth also, because I'm lazy--perfect.  I also added a splash of white wine.  Really solid recipe--will definitely make this again.

This is a great dish and easy to prepare.  I used a small containor of fresh mushrooms I sauteed with about six garlic cloves (instead of the can & dry), then removed the mushroom/garlic and put the chicken in the pan to fry up.  I didn't pound the chicken and so it took about 8-10 minutes each side; next time I think I will wet the chicken first so a little more flower mixture (I used Old Bay, Kosher salt, fresh pepper, and a little Cayenne in the flour for flavor) sticks to the chicken.  I also used 1/2 cup of stock and 1/2 cup white wine instead of the water & bouillon.  Ok, so I made a lot of changes, but my fiancee absolutely loved it and thought it was so flavorful.  I served it with Basmati rice and asparagus steamed with a couple teaspoons of white wine and a bit of butter.  Dinner took about 45 minutes to make this way (but I cleaned as I went so that includes cleaning of the kitchen too).

This was so easy to make and so tasty, I used Chicken broth instead of granules and also threw in an onion with the mushrooms.  I also used fresh mushrooms. I served over egg noodles.  Not a drop left!  The family loved it.

I really liked this recipe, and I pretty much made it as is....except for I didn't pound the breasts thin...and also, I let the breasts simmer in the sauce for a good ten minutes...I think that really added....I served it over a brown rice medley and with asparagas on the side...excellent...

This was a very quick and easy-to-prepare meal. I would strongly suggest using fresh mushrooms and chicken broth. I added some minced garlic for flavor but it still wasn't savory enough to satisfy us.

It's a "keeper" for sure.  Husband and I both enjoyed this.... doubled recipe so we'd have more for tomorrow.  I followed some of the suggestions and substituted low fat chicken broth - used fresh garlic - added onions & served over spiral pasta.  Enjoy!

This was a very basic--yet yummy--chicken dish.  A definte keeper.  It makes a pretty presentation with parsley sprinkled on top.  I served it will white rice--extra sauce was great on the rice.

My husband and I enjoyed this a lot.  The chicken was flavorful and very moist.  I made some changes to the recipe. I used fresh mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I also used Knorr's chicken stock base instead of boullion.  I had to use a touch extra oil when I sauteed the mushrooms and garlic. Overall, it was delicious and we'll be having this again.

This was fantastic, I did make a few changes, used an iron skillet, preheated oven to 350 browned chicken remove from pan then sautéed fresh mushrooms and onions, added chicken broth, a little garlic powder, put chicken breasts back in and put in oven, I covered it and baked 40 min, removed from oven and brought to boil on stove thickened with 1/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons cornstarch. It was great...

I was looking for a way to get rid of some mushrooms, and this was a pretty good choice. Before adding the mushrooms, I added freshly chopped garlic and red pepper flakes to the oil and cooked until fragrant. I also used freshly chopped parsley, dried oregano, and a bit of dried cilantro to add more flavor. I served it over basmati rice and drizzled the rest of the sauce over it.

Next time I'll use white wine to replace half of the water. Also the recipe called for canned mushrooms, but I used fresh ones instead.

We had this for dinner tonight and the only change I made was fresh mushrooms, not canned, and I multiplied it for 6 from the 2 originally.  In the future, I will not put the chicken back in the pan with the mushrooms, the breading got soggy and fell off when it got wet.

This is amazing! The written recipe is really good, but with a few tweaks you can make this 6 stars! I never ever use canned mushrooms (do people really use those?). I use a mixture of crimini mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms and instead of garlic powder, I add fresh garlic as I saute the mushrooms. I also usually add a little minced onion to the mushrooms and garlic. The sauce never makes enough for my hubby and I so I always double it, too. I don't always bread the chicken and will sometimes just put on salt and pepper and cook it that way. This is a regular meal in our house!

I used some of the recommendations from other reviewers (like fresh garlic), and my husband and I really liked this dish. It was a little salty for me. So, I think next time I will use chicken broth in lieu of the bouillon cube. I think I'll also serve it with rice next time to eat with that delicious gravy! Oh, and fresh mushrooms are the way to go instead of canned! I put a whole pint in mine :)

Definitely a keeper! Fresh mushrooms are so much better than canned. I added extra salt because of the few people who commented that there wasn't enough flavor, but it didn't need it. We also served it over rice, which was excellent.

Simple, yet good. I thought it was maybe 3.5 stars, but since I can't dredge using flour due to dietary reasons, I bumped it to a five star to make up for not following directions to a "T".

I didn't pound the chicken breasts.  Didn't brown them in anything, just browned them by themselves.  Needed to add extra cornstarch for a gravy-like consistency.  My husband could tell they were canned mushrooms.  When I make it again, I will have to buy the real thing.  A good recipe to have around.  Nice and easy.

Great recipe! The chicken tastes really great. 
I don´t use canned mushrooms so I used fresh. Also added little bit of milk to the sauce before I returned the chicken to the skillet.

Good easy dish. Used fresh mushrooms, garlic and bit of cream to the sauce. Lots of possibilities with this one. My 9 year old loves it and said he could eat every day. Will definately make again.

Make sure you prep everything (including step 2) before you begin because once you start cooking it goes pretty fast.  Next time I'll use fresh mushrooms and add more seasoning.  Pretty bland but a very good start.

Great & Simple.  Served with smashed potatoes, and mixed frozen veg.  Not Haute Cuisine, but better than a dial-a-dinner. :)  Boys (Age 2 & 5) devoured.  Even the Mrs. liked it. :)  I used fresh mushrooms.  Next time, I will add more water / broth / starch  to create more gravy for the potatoes.

It's a good base recipe, but seems like it needs something for a little more flavor.  My family ate it and it was good, but not outstanding.  I used chicken stock and added onions.  The dish made a beautiful presentation over white rice.

Delicious!  I made with tenderloins so they would cook quicker, worked out great.  I also added diced onion and some minced garlic to the sauteed mushrooms (i used fresh instead of canned).  We had with mashed potatoes; the sauce makes great gravy!  I will definitely make this again!  This one's a keeper!

The good part about meal was the taste of chicken. The sauce, however, was bland. Used fresh mushrooms instead. Found cornstarch was not enough so added a bit more.  Even added a tsp. of salt found it still bland.

A family favorite! Even my son, who won't eat sauces, thought the chicken without sauce was delicious! We replaced half of the water with skim milk. Sooo quick, easy and perfectly scrumptious!

This was pretty good. I thought it felt like comfort food and would have been good with some mashed potatoes. Mine turned out a little bit salty. I think this was because I used concentrated chicken base. Came together very easy. Used fresh button mushrooms and pounded the breasts very thin.

I used chicken broth and fresh mushrooms like others suggested.  The chicken turned out to be very moist and the flavor was good.  I had to cook the sauce a lot longer and wish I had doubled it.  If it weren't so bland, I would have given this a rating of 5.

This was really good.  The only thing I had was large chicken breasts from the farm so I cut them into strips.  After it was done I thought it needed something extra so I added lemon juice from one lemon wow did that make it good really really good.

Absolutely wonderful!  Very quick and easy and very flavorful - my husband and I both loved it.  I used canned chicken broth instead of the water and bullion (that's what I had on hand), and, since I was out of parsley, I put a little rosemary in the sauce.  Delicious!  I will definitely be making this a regular at our house.

unfortunately i found this recipe to be quite bland.  i'm glad i used fresh mushrooms, garlic and chicken broth in lieu of water because it gave this recipe some flavor and a 2 star rating for moisture.

This is a great dish with a little tweaking.  Canned mushrooms do NOT give this recipe justice- you should use fresh ones and it's much tastier if you're a 'schroom lover.  I also used the  buillion in the jar since I had it on hand.  Also, just before serving, I put a slice of swiss or provolone cheese on top and it all just melts together and it's heavenly!  Great base recipe and so yummy- Thanks!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he loved it. I did make a few changes though, like many others I used fresh garlic and mushrooms. I also did not dredge the chicken in flour. Though the thing that stuck out the most was I used half of the water that was called for and substituted cream for the other half. Next time I will omit the water all together and use all cream (or milk). Yum! Yum! Very tasty. I served this over mashed potatoes. Great combo!

This was just okay.  There is a much better recipe for chicken with mushrooms on this site.  It's a picatta recipe so it has lemon and that's what I think was missing from this.  It's called Chicken Picatta II.

i make this when we have friends over and have gotten so many compliment.  i half the butter and oil and double the mushrooms and all the incredients for the sauce (bc everyone always requests more sauce).  Also, you may want to add a bit more cornstarch to make the sauce a bit thicker. I cook the sauce much longer than the recipe says, as well.

Wow, this is amazingly good!  I am so impressed.  Super easy, delicious flavor, and you'd never guess it's low-fat... I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed with fresh garlic, and chicken broth in place of the water and granules.  Other than that, made recipe as is, and it was fabulous.  Thanks, this recipe is perfect!

I can't believe how good this is!  It is so simple and tasty.  I used 8oz fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the canned and added a little extra cornstarch to make the sauce nice and thick and rather then put the chicken back in the sauce I just kept the chicken warm in the oven then poured the sauce over the chicken before serving for a great presentation.

Delicious! I was just cooking for myself, so I played with the amounts. I made the sauce a bit thicker than intended, but it tasted fabulous. Every ingredient is something that I keep a fresh stock of in my pantry, so I will be sure to make this again and again.

Simple, but good.  As suggested, I used a can of chicken broth and fresh, sliced mushrooms.  I also cut the chicken in bite size pieces to speed up cooking.

If I could give a minus(-) for this, I would.  I love chicken, and I love mushrooms, and I had high hopes for this recipe.  Unfortunately, neither I nor my husband could eat this dish.  It was very bland, and even looked unappealing.  I followed the recipe exactly, too.  At least I gave it a try!!

This was really good. The whole family loved the chicken and the gravy. I served it with rice and green beans. This is definately close to restaraunt quality. Next time I'll buy fresh mushroom just for this recipe. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this recipe.The sauce was very tasty and delicious. The only change I made was to use Morton's Seasoning Blend in place of salt and pepper in the flour! We had it with rice and green peas. It was a great Sunday dinner.

This is such a great recipe to make when time is short.  I've been able to prepare this using canned chicken broth and have on the table in less than 30 minutes.  And the best part is that everyone loves it.

I am so glad someone mentioned Old Bay seasoning, I tried it with this and fresh mushrooms, and it was just outa this world!  Fantastic easy recipe, will use it a lot.  The mushroom sauce is one I can carry into many recipes. Thanks much!

This recipe is very quick and simple to make, although I used fresh mushrooms and added a little milk to the sauce for a creamier consistency.

This was delicious. I’m incapable of making a recipe as stated, so I did make a few tweaks. Used homemade chicken broth mixed with cornstarch, sautéed onions and garlic with fresh portabella mushrooms, added dried Italian herbs to the flour.  Finished the dish with a splash of good white wine after the chicken was removed, scraping up the browned bits. Served with mushroom ravioli and broccoli. My husband and I both loved it.

I made this but made a bit healthier and more fresh. No vegetable oil, sub avocado oil, used fresh mushrooms not canned (GROSS!), fresh garlic not powdered and added onion powder to the flour dredge. Turned out great!

Delicious!! I seasoned (salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder) and pan seared the chicken with olive oil instead of using the flour. I then made the sauce but had to add a some more water because it was a bit salty. Fiancé loved it, and he usually not a fan of chicken and mushrooms. Will be making it again soon!!

Absolutely loved it! My whole family enjoyed it! I used chicken Broth with a tiny bit of bullion, and added garlic and onion to sauté with the mushrooms. Served it over/with bowtie noodles and garlicky green beans. This is definitely a keeper!!!

This was unexpectedly delicious but I did make some changes, hence -1 star. I used fresh mushrooms and chicken broth, instead of canned mushrooms and bullion, respectively.  Also, I turned the heat off after I stirred in the chicken and covered with a tight fitting lid for about 10 min to keep the chicken tender and juicy (instead of stirring to heat through).  Even my picky 2-year old enjoyed it...will be making it again soon!

My husband loved this.  The only changes I made were adding  a dollop of low fat sour cream and 1/4 cup of red wine to the gravy.  Also, I halved the recipe and served it on a bed of brown rice.  I will make this again.  This is about as close as I'll ever come to making fried chicken!

Instead of the water, I used the water from the mushrooms and apple cider vinegar.  I also added a garlic and herb blend seasoning instead of just the garlic powder.  I really enjoyed it!

My picky husband even liked this dish.  I changed this recipe a little bit.  I only had chicken granules not packets, so I guessed and used 1 tbsp.  I also used fresh baby bella mushrooms, thus cooking them longer.  I topped my dish with chopped green onions and tomatoes.

This was excellent. I added onions like some of the other reviews suggested. Also I used fresh mushrooms.  Finally I made quite a bit for a dinner party so I could not get all thieves back in the pan after sautéing. So I  put all the pieces in a dish, covered with the sauce and put it in the oven at 350 for 12 minutes and came out perfect.

Pretty good recipe.  I made it the first time as written then the second time with my changes.  I used chicken broth instead of the boullion/water mix and I used fresh minced garlic (about 4 cloves) and fresh mushrooms.  Both times I served with mashed potatoes.  I will make it again.

I prepared this dish following the original recipe last night, and my husband and I both agreed that it lacked a lot of flavor.  One of our favorite recipes is chicken marsala, which is similar, but the mushroom sauce is made with white wine and lemon juice.  This marsala has MUCH more flavor, and so I think we were disappointed in the outcome of this recipe.  I'm sure you can doctor up the sauce in many different ways, but I would just prefer to make Chicken Marsala instead!

hummm...i don't get it, this was bland and boring. i want to say something good about it, but....
i pounded the chicken to make sure it was tender...and it was. i did not have parsley, but would really make it that much better? it was just a bland sauce with mushrooms...mixed with chicken.

I was a doubter, but I tried it and was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoy my hot/spicy foods so this was a far cry from any of that.  It had a nice subtle flavor and a good consistency in the sauce. I did not coat the chicken in flour in an attempt to save a few calories but it still was good.  I will keep this one in my recipe file.

Very good!  Make sure you salt and season the chicken and flour.  Used sliced mushrooms, don't like canned or jarred.  Also, took longer to cook the chicken than suggested.

I thought this was an excellent (and easy recipe). I followed other's suggestions and used chicken broth for the water/granules. I also seasoned my chicken before the flour and added a chopped onion. I also doubled the sauce because we like a lot of sauce.

This chicken is really fast and easy. I'm not usually a fan of the pan-fried taste or texture, but this recipe makes a FABULOUS mushroom gravy. Yum, and really easy!

I doubled this for my family of six and made a couple of changes. I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed an onion with them. I also used chicken stock instead of the water/bouillon mix. This was yummy and easy. Even my kids liked it!

Excellent! As other reviewers suggested, I substituted the water and chicken boullion & for Chicken Broth, and added a little salt & garlic. I also added a little flour to thicken the mixture. Will def. make again...Thank you!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I did use fresh mushrooms and chicken stock.  Also I sauted some chopped finely chopped onions and minced garlic with the chicken breasts.  YUM!  I will be making this recipe again.

The chicken is super moist and tender with this recipe.  The only problem I had was thickening the sauce.  I made it as directed the first time (except for adding fresh mushrooms instead of canned) and it never thickened.  I threw it out and tried again with milk instead of water, which worked a little better, but not the "gravy" consistency I was looking for.  But it still tasted excellent and we ate it all!  Served it over fettucini we had left over in the fridge.

Delicious.... I'm a new mushroom lover, after years of shunning mushrooms, I'm breaking out of my shell.  This is the first recipe I've tried and it is wonderful.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and added added a little more oil and butter. Other than that I followed everything exactly and it turned out wonderful.

My husband and sons (ages 8 and 5)never usually rave about a meal but this was a hit.  I used shitake mushrooms and served over brown rice.  The sauce never did really thicken up but no one noticed and it tasted delicious.

This recipe gave me a great new way to cook chicken breast, while leaving it very moist.  I found the flavour a little bland and will probably add a touch of cream next time.

This was ok but a bit lacking in flavour.  Maybe next time I'll put in a bit of white wine like another reviewer suggested.  Quick and easy weeknight meal, though.

Great dinner!  I took a few suggestions from other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water plus I used fresh mushrooms (and more of them).  I also needed to add more cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce at the end.  But it was absolutely delicious!  NOTE:  I made the mistake of serving over egg noodles that didn't absorb the sauce...would be much better on rice like everyone else reviewing seemed to do!

This is good!  I added 1/4 cup white wine and so I had to double the corn starch to compensate.  Also, not sure how much a "packet" of chicken bouillon is, but I ended up using 2 tsps.  This dish reminded me of an entree I get at The Olive Garden - Chicken Vino Bianco.  It would be great served over pasta with a side salad.

This was a delicious recipe.  I sauteed the mushrooms with some minced garlic. I think that added to the flavor a lot.  I will definately be making this again.

I made this for my boyfriend and I last night and it was pretty tasty, although it was not as garlicy as I would have liked. My sauce also did not thicken despite extra cornstarch, perhaps I shouldn't have dumped in the whole can of chicken broth...still tasted great though and the brown rice soaked it all up and was great. I served it with cheesy mashed potatoes. Would probably make again :)

This was very good.  I served it over angel hair.  I think it would be even better with some white wine added.  The sauce was a little bland, but the chicken was very moist.

Wonderful recipe! I used fresh mushrooms and added chopped onion, and it was out of this world. It tastes like a gourmet dish, but it's so quick and simple! This will become a regular in our house.

We thought this was very good! Used fesh mushrooms and garlic. Added about a 1/4 cup white wine to the broth. Added a little extra cornstarch too. Was easy to prepare. Will make again. Thanks

Absolutely delicious!!  Even my 3 yo who usually will only eat hot dogs gobbled this down.  I also used canned chicken broth (about 3/4 and fresh mushrooms.  I also seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, house salt and garlic powder to give the chicken a little more flavor.  The gravy was scrumptious and went well with the brown rice and asparagus!  Thanks Angela, I will definitely make this again!!

Fabulous!  I sauteed LOTS of fresh garlic & mushrooms before adding the broth (canned), etc., and made extra sauce because my family loves sauce/gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes - YUM!  This is a keeper!

This recipe was simply extraordinary. It was easy to make, requires only simple ingredients that I keep around the house, took about half an hour to do from start to finish, looked gorgeous, and tasted terrific! It truly is a 5-star recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used 1 clove fresh crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder. Also, next time I might cut back on the mushrooms - I thought there were a lot (although I really like mushrooms). Not a bad thing - just a thought. Enjoy!

I didn't have a lot of faith in this one, but my husband loves mushrooms, so I tried it.  Wow.  My 5 yo literally licked her plate and everyone raved about it.  Only thing I did differently was to use just one can of mushrooms since I don't like them and I subbed a can of chicken broth for the water and bouillon.  Thank you, Angela, for making my family very happy tonight!

I left the chicken breasts as they were, I didn't pound them thin and they were really juicy.  I used fresh mushrooms (I always do I never use canned), and the sauce was very tasty.

The flavour of this recipe was very good - but I think I may have done something wrong as there was not very much sauce at all.  I used a frying pan which was too big for the two chicken breasts I was cooking, and I used more (fresh) mushrooms which may have absorbed more of the liquid.  I will try this recipe again using a smaller frying pan and less mushrooms.
