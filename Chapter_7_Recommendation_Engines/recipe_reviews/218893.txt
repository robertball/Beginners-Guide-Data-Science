I cut the recipe in half and I got exactly 18 cookies. It was spot on. I didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted and it was great anyways. I will make these again and try with unsalted to see which way I prefer them. These are buttery, crumbly, not too sweet, easy to make, beautiful to look at... a winner!

I kept this as it is a little different from the walnut wedding cakes but still prefer the walnuts to poppy seeds but if you are looking for a change to add to your cookie tray, it is a nice one.

Made these exactly as directed. So easy and delicious. The real problem is stopping yourself from eating them all in one sitting.

Good: One bowl recipe! Everything was in my pantry

I halved the recipe and produced exactly 8 one inch balls.
 
Less Good: kind of bland. I did a mixture of vanilla and lemon extract and still wasn't dying to taste one when they came out of the oven. Also, they don't look very pretty...if you're going to make a shortbread balls, might as well take the extra step and make it into an appealing shape. I'm thinking about putting in some natural coloring next time.

Overall: These are hard to mess up, and super fast to whip up--just make sure your butter is at the perfect consistency.

I had planned on making poppy seed bread, but found this recipe instead and it looked super easy and tasty!.  It has a lovely delicate flavor, but bland and dry be comparison to what I was expecting.  Not sure if I was using salted, or unsalted butter, that may have made a difference.  Additionally I added 1 tsp of almond extract, but still felt bland.  I think I over cooked them as well, as cooking time always takes longer on stoneware.  Enjoyed this recipe a lot, and will be making again!

These turned out really well and were easy to make. The poppy seeds add a lovely crunch. I rolled some of mine in poppy seeds rather than the sugar just to try it out and they were also nice, not as sweet. Quite a dense tea cake perfect with a cup of tea. Husband loves them, will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I must have made my first batch of cookies too big; they took about 14 minutes to cook, and I ended up with only 2 dozen cookies.  That's OK; they were delicious, and friends asked for the recipe.

Very simple to make. All the ingredients were in my kitchen for a change. This was a hit at my house and an added cookie to my christmas cookie trays.
