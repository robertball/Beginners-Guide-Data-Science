I thought this was a tasty drink.  I did use Hawiaan PUnch instead of cranberry juice.  Give this a try-- you will like it.

What a great recipe.  We are sitting here in sunny CA watching the Super Bowl.  Made a bowl of this as suggested and it is disappearing fast.  Cranberry juice is a must.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I used all coconut rum in place of the other but otherwise followed the recipe. It sneaks up on you because the flavor meshes to where you do not taste alcohol. I needed this! Thanks!
