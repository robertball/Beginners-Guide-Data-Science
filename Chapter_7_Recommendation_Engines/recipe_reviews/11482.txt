My dogs loved these.  I omitted the jelly, sugar and corn syrup, added an egg and doubled the amount of flour and oats.  My dogs said WOOF!!!  Also, I made peanut butter ones with about a tablespoon of peanut butter and a teaspoon of honey, (minus the sugar jelly and corn syrup)

My Yorky LOVED this treat.  I added some peanut butter as suggested.  I plan to bake up a larger batch for some friend's dogs too!

My 8year old wanted to make puppy treats this morning and he picked out this recipe. I made lots of changes, the main one being that I realized I was out of oatmeal and so I chopped up some hotdogs and added them to the dough. Also, I think the liquid is off in this recipe...I ended up adding a little milk to make the dough come together. Didn't add the sugar on top as our dogs are kind of chunky and don't need the extra calories, LOL!

Actually - I just used part of this recipe - the cheese/water/oats/flour.  I got rid of all the sugar - graham crackers/jelly/corn syrup - because my older dog has liver problems and sugar should be avoided.  But she loved the modified version of these!!

My Boston Terrier, who usually eats ANYTHING, and everything, would not get anywhere near these.  I'm hoping th dog across the street will like them so that all is not lost.

I helped my 4 yr old make this for our friends dogs.  We rolled it out and cut with cookie cutters.  My son loved making it and our friends all asked for the recipe saying their dogs loved the treats!

This recipe was ok, my dog liked it well enough but wasn't crazy about them.  Of course, she is a very picky eater so it might just be her.  I also wanted to suggest not to use RASINS as another reviewer suggested.  Grapes and raisins are toxic to your beloved dog.

My Beagles loved them and my 3 year old LOVED making them! We used cheese singles, and chicken bullion cubes. Also loved the garlic and parsley add-ins!

I made these yesterday for my Bichon Beau and for the furkids of friends and made the following changes: 1 c rolled oats, 1/3 c. butter, 1 c boiling beef stock, 3/4 c cornmeal, 1 T. Splenda,  1/2 c milk 1 1/2 c cheddar cheese, 1/3 c gr. parmesan cheese, 1 egg and 2 1/2 c of all purpose flour.  My "Bubba" went nuts for them! He is somewhat finicky, also a diabetic receiving insulin twice a day, which is why I used the Splenda...but he loves them, and today has taken to "talking" to them before he eats them...no idea what that is about!

Needless to say, my dog absolutely loved these. 
I didn't have rolled oats so I just used some raisin & spice oatmeal and I also used grape jelly instead of apple. No complaints from puppy though, every single crumb has been cleaned up. Your recipe sure made me the hero today!

YIKES!!! TOO MUCH SUGAR!!! Dogs who get this treat often are likely to develop diabetes. Be careful folks.
