Outstanding, simply outstanding! This recipe is the reason that Chef John is the first person I've added to my "chefs I follow". I've made it 4 times now in less than 3 weeks. I'm not a dessert person, but I like mousse, trifles, pudding etc. I received a couple good quality chocolate bars (Lindt) for xmas. The first time I made this I used the dark chocolate one. I did use less chili because I'm sensitive to hot spice, but it didn't bother me. It was killer good. The second time I used the milk chocolate bar because it was all I had. Equally good in a different way... softer, fluffier, more subtle. I used the full amount of chili powder. 2 more times with the dark chocolate. Every time is excellent. I'm now going to look for good quality sugar free chocolate so I can experiment with a diabetic friendly version for my husband. This recipe rivals chocolate mousse that I have eaten in any high quality restaurant. Thank you Chef John!

I looked and looked at recipes because I wanted to make something for National Chocolate Mousse Day (April 3) and decided on this one and WOW, it did not disappoint. I added the pepper but only had cayenne and I added strong coffee to the chocolate instead of water. It made for a hint of coffee that did not overpower the chocolate. This recipe is a winner!

Delicious! And OH, SO EASY! Very elegant and romantic dessert. I'd make it again. Used a dark chocolate candy bar with 77 Percent Cocoa. Also, added a couple of teaspoons of powdered sugar to stabilize the whipped cream and to balance the bitterness of the chocolate. Very happy with the results. Another great recipe from Chef John!

This recipe is super easy!! Since I did not have whipped cream, I saved the egg whites and whipped those. But I doubled the portion of egg whites.  Ex: I used 2 egg yolks for the chocolate mixture and whipped 4 egg whites. This recipe is superb for a Valentines day treat!

This is the best recipe for chocolate Mousse I have found! It so rich, and simple to make. I did not add as much pepper as it said though. Would rate it ten stars if I could! :) Thumbs up for Chef John!

Made this for my chocoholic daughter's birthday.  I used a warm brownie cup, put in the frozen good ice cream with mousse on the top, then covered with meringue, in broiler for a minute and it was to die for.

Very good and pretty easy to make. I did think the amount/portions were a bit off. I doubled it and if I did really want to serve 8 people, I don't think there would have been quite enough mousse. You definitely don't need a big portion of this though.

Love it! I'm a huge fan of dark chocolate and this recipe is fantastic. This was my first attempt at making mousse and I found the video and instructions easy to follow. The mousse held up well to me piping it into individual dessert cups. My fianc√© found it to not be sweet enough so maybe next time I'll add sugar to my heavy cream before whipping it. I on the other hand thought it was just right. I used Lindt 70% cocoa, smooth dark chocolate.

I will make it again.  The 6 oz dishes really only make enough for 3.  So-fill them less !!  I also would use coffee in the first addition of water and that might make it a little more interesting 
Otherwise, really did like !

This recipe is delicious and very easy. My husband loves mint so I used half dark chocolate and half mint dark chocolate. Turned out really nice. Will certainly do this one again.

Doubled recipe, used 2, 3.5oz Lindy Chili chocolate bars.  Was very smooth and not too sweet.  Piped it into mini-chocolate shells, and topped w/ raspberry.

I needed to add at least a quarter cup more water to get it to smooth out.  I also added two more tablespoons of sugar and one more tablespoon of butter. It took that much more stuff before  it looked like it did in the video. The flavor was excellent.

I liked it, had other people eating it tell me it was  good, but needed to be a little sweeter (used an organic dark chocolate chocolate bar). I had some difficulties with the chocolate cooling down too much in the ice and getting some almost fudge like chocolate in the mousse. I might sweeten the whipping cream before adding it to the chocolate mixture, other than that I really enjoyed it.

This was my first time making mousse, i never though it was that easy! I liked this recipe so much, i have made it twice this week. The hardest part is waiting for the mousse to set in the refrigerator ! Topped it with whipped cream and fresh berries! So good!

Made this for a potluck dinner--I quadrupled the recipe and served it in a large casserole dish. The dish was practically licked clean by the end of the evening. It was easy to make, and everyone loved it. Even the gluten free folks could enjoy it.

I made this for Valentine's day exactly as stated and it was delicious. It was very easy to make which is even better. I did make it again and whipped up 3/4 cup whipping cream instead of what was called for. It made the dessert just a tad bit lighter and we liked it even better.  Only thing I found was that, like others, I wouldn't say this would serve 4 people - they would be very small servings. I got 3 decent size servings from it.

I added a dash of pure vanilla extract to the whipped cream topping, amazing result! I will definitely be making this again. Not overly sweet, just perfect!

This was a bit of work but not too bad. The key is to read the recipe a few times before starting and have everything ready to go so you can work quickly.  Mine wound up with some chunks in it. I didn't want to over fold and knock all the air out and so I ended up not really combining things well enough.  But still yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly, which is rare for me. It was scrumptious. It takes a little bit of skill to make, but it's not hard and it doesn't take a lot of time. Everyone in my family loved it! My son-in-law said he'll be requesting this for his birthday every year.

This recipe was awesome.  It was every easy to make and several of my my guests thought it was "the best mousse I've ever had."  I simply loved it... It was rich, smooth and that touch of Cayenne gave it that perfect pinch of heat.
Thank you!!

While this was delicious, the making of it was over my experience level. About wore my arm off with the whipping and took longer than the time I had allotted for.

I followed the recipe and very much enjoyed it. However, I did not add any pepper to my mousse. I also added a tablespoon of powder sugar, as per the recommendation of some commenters. This caused the consistency of the cream to become dry and stiff, so I had to add more heavy cream. However, ended up tasting great!

OMG . . . this stuff is GOOD! The only adjustment that I made was to use a bit of espresso in place of the water. I had some espresso chocolate chips that I melted and piped into shapes of hearts, the word "Love" and "XOXO" to place on top of the whipped cream to give it a Valentine's Day theme. They turned out so elegant, and the flavor is pure decadence! Perfect for a special occasion.

I‚Äôm not a fan of chipotle pepper so I left that out. As just a chocolate mousse on its own, it is scrumptious. I topped mine with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. Easy to follow recipe. Great results.

I used Bakers Chocolate and it didn't turn out creamy like the video showed but I added some straight cream to thin out the final product and that seems to worked out. I am wondering if I should have used a 3/12 ounces of chocolate chips or a regular chocolate bar meant for consumption rather than the Bakers. I went a little light on the pepper. I may try it again.

Very rich. Smaller portion than I expected. Chipotle was only okay, may omit next time. Easier recipe than it initially seemed like it would be.

Made this recipe today - I did not have Chipotle pepper/spice but even without it,  the mousse tastes divine! Any substitute for egg yolk in this recipe would be a great help as my parents are pure vegetarian and I really want them to have this recipe. :-)

Made it just as the recipe said, except I doubled the servings. Very rich. Nobody even tasted the chipotle pepper. I would make again for a special occasion.

My hubby was travelling home after 3 weeks and I wanted to make something romantic and special. I had seen how to make chocolate edible cups, wanted a great M recipe for filling, When I saw one from chef John.. I looked no further. I got great reviews from my worst critic chocoholic friend. Waiting for hubby to land tonight and will enjoy dessert together.
I have tried many of your recipes in past. Every recipe of your's is fool proof. Thank you

I am a big fan of chocolate mousse and did not like this.  I followed this recipe exactly and used Lindt 70% Cocoa bar.  I did not find it sweet enough.  Also, I was not a fan of the chipotle pepper.

This was a lot easier to make than I had assumed.  I also found that if I set the fully mixed mousse in the same ice bath I had whipped the cream and cooled the chocolate mix, it set up much more quickly than 4 hours.

I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect!  The video was very helpful!  My family was worried, at first, that they wouldn't have enough dessert, but the mousse is so rich, everyone was very satisfied with the amount.  We topped ours with whipping cream with a couple of tablespoons of powdered sugar mixed in.  We will definitely have this again.

The chocolate Mousse was to rich but melted in your mouth at every bite. My family and I loved the dessert and will fix it again. The only thing that was weird was i didn't whip the cream to a peak, because it was taking to much time but it turned out very well anyway.
