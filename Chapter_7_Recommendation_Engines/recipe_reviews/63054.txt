These sandwiches are so good!  I decided to leave out the pine nuts (just a little too pricey) and they still turned out great!

These were a big hit at a Christmas tea I attended yesterday.  There were none left on the plate by the end of our meal and there were only 6 of us.  Everyone asked for the recipe and oohed & ahhed!  The only thing I might do diffrently is use a more substantial bread, as the cream cheese was difficult to spread on the white bread, even at room temperature. I think a nice multi-grain or wheat bread would do just fine.  Don't leave out the pine nuts:  they really make the sandwich stand out and add texture. I will definitely be making these pretty, & tasty morsels again!!

Made these exactly as written, and they were great. Disappeared first, and I only got one. I'm making more as soon as my house is clean! ADDED 1/1/08 I have made these several times and they are always a popular item. What I do now to save time and effort is mix the cream cheese in with everything else and just spread it all together. Saves a step and is just as good.

I made these tea sandwiches for a baby shower. They were a huge hit! Now I'm making it for a quick dinner. I make up a batch on the weekend, and nibble off of it during the week. I use nonfat or lowfat cream cheese,and cucumber slices instead of bread, so I don't bust the diet. Wonderful!

This is really a very tasty little recipe!  I used regular mayo, regular onion instead of green onion, dried basil instead of fresh, no pine nuts, and instead of spreading the cream cheese on the bread separately, I mixed it right in with the olive mixture - it turned out great!

Very tasty. I added 1/4 c. prepared alfredo sauce instead of the mayo and skipped the cream cheese. Great on Italian bread that has been toasted!

I made 4 types of tea sandwiches for a function and these were gone in minutes. HUGE hit! I had no pine nuts so I added some crushed, roasted almonds instead and still tasted wonderful.

Great!!!! I didn't have basil or pine nuts but I did wanted a seasoned taste so I sprinkled some salad seasoning in the mixture and it was excellent!!! Next time I will include the cream cheese into the mix instead of spreading it on the bread.

This is a really yummy sandwich spread...and I don't usually like sandwich spreads, but this rocks! I  upped the amount of leeks and sundried tomatoes b/c I like both of those flavors! I made it for my Christmas Tea and for New Years and few times and it has always been a hit!

Sooo good, and so fast - Try making it in a food processor (I use the Magic Bullet). Combine all ingredients except the cream cheese, then mix together and spread. This was a HUGE hit at a tea-party themed bridal shower I threw.

NO ONE liked these.  They were expensive and there were tons left on the tray.  I will not be trying these again.

We loved these!  I did not put as much of the mixture on each sandwich and I made about 10 instead of 6, I think that kept them from being overwhelming.  I also put cream cheese on both slices of bread instead of just one.  Great recipe!

Made this for a tea party/Christmas cookie exchange.  Everyone liked them and they were my fave out of the 3 new recipes I tried.

I made these for my annual Christmas tea a couple of weeks ago. These dainty sandwiches were a huge hit. I used Pepperidge Farm Extra Thin white bread. I didn't have time to play with the recipe, but seems like there could have been a little something extra for flavor. I plan to experiment next time. But again, very delicious!!!

I made these tea sandwiches for a ladies tea and everyone loved them. They're very easy to make. I forgot to put in the tomatoes, but they were still delicious. I omitted the pine nuts.

What a fantastic addition to an afternoon tea!  The flavor is full and original, and the sandwiches are quite pretty.  A nice change from what you normally find!

We made these for a tea party baby shower and everyone raved about them. They also look nice when arranged on a platter. The mother to be loved them so much her sister asked for the recipe for her shower in her home state. Easy to make too.

WONDERFUL!!  I couldn't find the olive brand, but the store brand of chopped olives worked just fine.  I also didn't add the pine nuts, but I don't think it detracted from the taste.  The sundried tomatoes really enhances the flavor.

I made this for a ladies coffee, and it was absolutely delicious!!! Many compliments were given! Great flavor and works on bread or crackers. Couldn't find pine nuts, but still wonderful!
