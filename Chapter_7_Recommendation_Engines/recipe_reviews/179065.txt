This was very good!  Very flavorful sauce and definitely great to make with a cheaper beef cut!  I put over brown rice and made more sauce than it called for.  I also used regular mushrooms instead of portobello.  Next time I would take the beef out while veggies are cooking and add later, just to keep beef more tender.  I will definitely make again!

Americanized version of stir fry but very tasty.  We used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt and 1/8th lb Shitake Mushrooms.

My husband loves this dish - he will even eat it without the meat and over brown rice for a healthier alternative. I use sliced cremini mushrooms and also add snap peas to the mix. The sauce is great, I add a bit of Worchestershire to the broth, which gives it an added kick. It's sooo easy and has so much flavor!! Love this recipe.

I thought this tasted pretty good. The only downside is it does dirty quite a few dishes and it only makes about 3 servings. It isn't traditional, in that it is more broth than oil in the sauce, but I was fine with that. I used a sharp pair of scissors to cut the sirloin into stir-fry thin pieces. I used a pan with 3" sides to fit all of the vegetables. I put about 1 Tblsp. of veg. oil in the pan and heated it on medium high before adding the beef. I also drained any liquid as it cooked. Once I added the vegetables, I put the lid on and, I let them steam about 5-10 minutes before adding the broth. For the broth I made some up, using the 1 3/4 cup of water and only 1 beef bouillion cube, so it wasn't too salty. To save time I also used minced garlic and peppers from a jar. I served it with a flavored rice recipe from this site. TY

This was very good. I used 7oz of roasted peppers and added a little Worcestshire Sauce to it. I also served it over spaghetti because it was the only noodle I had on hand. It was still awesome. My family really enjoyed it.

I used fresh garlic and added a little oyster sauce with the soy sauce.   I used regular mushrooms because they were on sale.   Very good!

I made this the other night with Deer loin. It was wonderful. Next time I want to add water chesnuts and bamboo shoots. Will make it again soon. Going to try chicken and use chicken broth.

Really enjoyed this quick, easy recipe.  I browned the beef in chili oil for an added kick but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!
