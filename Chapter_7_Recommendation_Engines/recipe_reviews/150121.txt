I liked it and would make it again but I would only put in 1 T peanut butter probably because the peanut butter flavor overwhelmed it. I love peanut butter but in this I think I would prefer a banana or strawberry flavor coming out. I couldn't taste the strawberries at all so  I maybe would add a few more of those also. It's definitely worth trying though.

Sorry! You should put 1-2 T peanut butter and 4-5 strawberries per taste, depending on size.  You want to fill the bottom of the blender with strawberries, however many that takes.  If you use frozen strawberries, you will need to thin out the smoothie with a little bit of milk or soy milk.  Hope this helps!

I used frozen strawberries and a frozen
banana, which eliminated the need for ice cubes. My kids gulped this down this morning. Loved it. I'll make it again for sure.

I have been playing with smoothie recipes to see which one I like, and this one is the BEST that I have found so far!  Gonna make this more and more!  I did add a splash of milk because I used frozen strawberries. But awesome! Thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us!

Definitely a refreshing smoothie to make after a long day's worth of work. I liked the strawberry and peanut butter combination, but the banana kind of got lost on me. Maybe I'll add more banana next time. One thing that I am eager to experiment with is maybe to try adding some Nutella in instead of the peanut butter, just to see whether chocolate or peanut butter is the better supplement to this excellent smoothie.

Loved it!! I'm 9 months pregnant and a little tired of eating the same things.  I' not too strict with my measurements, so I probably added a little "extra" of each ingredient.  Plus, I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used "mixed berry" instead.  Wow!  I'm definitely going to be making this again.  Very soon!

Yum!  My non fruit eating 3.5 year old son LOVED it.  He doesn't even eat yogurt and he literally drank the entire cup in not time flat!  I substituted the plain yogurt for Stoneyfield Non-fat Strawberry yogurt.  I think it gave it the extra sweetness we all love!  Thanks for sharing!

Actually a fantastic recipe!  I don't care for smoothies because they taste way to sweet to me but this one was great!  The combo of the peanut butter and unsweetened yogurt was spot on.  I admit, I did use sweetened frozen strawberries though. My boyfriend picked them up by accident and this was my solution to get rid of them.  He hated it, said there were too many different tastes.  It is not overwhelmingly peanut-buttery at all. It's just the salty that cuts the sweet!

Fantastic!  Have had a hard time finding a PB smoothie recipe I like.  Used greek yogurt because that is what I had on hand.  Ended up using 2 T of PB.  Did also add about a 1/2 cup milk to thin it out enough for it to blend.

I used Almond Butter instead of Peanut Butter and strawberry/banana plain yogurt.  This was very filling and tasted great.  The Almond butter did not overpower the strawberry/banana flavor.

This was truly excellent.  Of course we're peanut-butter-aholics, so I added a good bit more peanut butter and less ice.  I also didn't have fresh strawberries in the house, but I did have some homemade strawberry syrup I'd canned, so I used that.  :-)

This smoothie was really not good at all.  I only gave it a 2 because my daughter finished hers and said it was edible.  The peanut butter after taste was strong and the strawberry flavor was masked.  The only thing that I liked about the smoothie was the texture.

Surprisingly delicious! My only changes were that I used low-fat strawberry yogurt and a pre-packaged cup of berries that came packed with juice.  I think that gave it the extra sweetness some people were hoping for. Overall a delicious way to do breakfast or even dessert, especially in the hot summer months!

So so so good! I only had strawberry-banana yogurt so I used half of a frozen banana, 3-4 strawberries and about 5-7 ice cubes. My daughter said 2 T of peanut butter was too much so I suggest one. Great smoothie!

This recipe is simple, but SO SO delicious.  I rarely have fresh fruit in the house, so after the first try as written (which was great), I've been making this with: 120g frozen strawberries 175g nonfat plain yogurt 2 tbsp peanut butter  I've also added 1/4 cup uncooked plain oats to help absorb some of the acidity, and that turned out fantastic.  LOVE this recipe!

This isn't a true rating of this recipe since I subbed a couple of things.  I used Greek non-fat yogurt because it's what I had. I also used almond butter because I am trying to finish off a jar.  It did not overwhelm the smoothie like some people said about the p.b.  I actually had more of the Greek yogurt flavor/texture going.  My whole family loved this!

I can't believe the rave reviews on this.  I love peanut butter.  I love strawberries.  Bananas are ok, too.  Mixed together?  This was horrific to me.    I followed it to the tee even using the NON-FAT PLAIN yogurt.  And maybe that was part of the problem. I had to add milk before it would even move through the blender...it was THAT thick. At first try, there was an overwhelming "bitter" taste of banana (obviously the yogurt and banana).  I nailed the sucker with DOUBLE the strawberries.  Even THAT couldn't kill the bitterness.  Well, I had to resort to sugar.  I used to tablespoons (umm..YEA)..and it was just....it killed the bitter taste a bit...made the banana taste worse...and the whole thing was just a disaster.  I douched it with more milk so I could at least swallow some of it down to give it a chance...but even that didn't mix it well.  I won't make it again, but if this is something someone else is giving a shot, do yourself a favor....less banana....more strawberries...and by ALL means..NO NON-FAT PLAIN YOGURT!!  Do some fatty stuff with VANILLA or something:)  Defeats the purpose of "healthy", but at least you *may* be able to drink it down:)  My two cents.   Sorry submitter!!!

I used Strawberry/Kiwi yogurt (its what i had on hand) which brings out the strawberry flavor. I used more like 5-6 strawberries and a little more peanut butter than required. Next time, i will use less peanut butter because it overwhelms the fruit flavor. I even added a little hot fudge sauce to the left over part of the smoothie and it masks some of the peanut butter and makes it somewhat sweeter. Overall it is a fanatastic recipe-very refreshing!! NOTE: it makes a HEAPING one serving. It took a glass and a half to hold it all. (Might be becuase i added more than 10 ice cubes because mine were smaller than the "usual" kind)

So thick and creamy! Used 4 tablespoons on Skyr yogurt instead of natural, and added around 150ml of almond milk. It's got the taste of the banana and the peanut butter then the sweetness of the strawberries hits you in the end!

Good-tasting, filling smoothie. The strawberry/peanut butter combo is a good one. I don't really taste the banana, but I think the banana is just to add sweetness and bulk, and it works for that. I added flaxseed meal to mine to make it healthier, and I used 1/4 cup each of nonfat strawberry yogurt and nonfat plain yogurt.

Wonderful! Used low-fat vanilla yogurt for more flavor, with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and fresh fruit, had no trouble with consistency! Excellent recipe.

This was so good! I changed a few things..I used a six ounce strawberry yogurt. Instead of ice, I used a frozen banana. All I had was crunchy peanut butter, but that worked just fine. Yummy!

I was not to sure when i saw the mix of strawberry banana and peanut butter but it was not too back we added chocolat sirup to it since the strawberry flavor was over powering the banana and the peanut butter when the chocolate was added there was more of a balance in the recipe other wise pretty good

Pretty yummy, kind of reminds me of the Chunky Strawberry breakfast smoothie from Jamba Juice minus the granola.  I only used 1 tablespoon of peanut butter as to not be overwhelmed by the taste.

When I say I hate peanut butter plain I mean it ever since I was a kid i’ve never liked peanut butter and I’ve been trying to gain weight and have seen all these strawberry banana protein shakes so I prayed that I would like it with peanut butter and what do you know it actually tastes really good and the peanut butter makes the texture so nice and gives it such a unique flavor. So happy I tried this

I prefer smoothies (vitaminas in Brasil) with more substance. I might make it again, but I'll have to find a compatible juice to reduce the amount of water (ice).

I loved it! I modified it a little. Used 6 frozen strawberries, non-fat vanilla yogurt(no need to sweeten), 1 banana, 4 iced cubes, 2 tbsp of peanut butter.  This is comparable to smoothie king, the amount of peanut butter was just right. Idk what other people are talking about. Maybe just make a strawberry banana smoothie if the peanut butter is  overwhelming, I mean it is a Strawberry banana PEANUT BUTTER smoothie.

Really liked this but my Vitamix had a hard time blending it together. I don't know if that's because both my strawberries and banana were frozen. Had to add a splash of milk, blended beautifully after that.

This smoothie is really good and, with my moderations, really filling. I normally make strawberry banana smoothies but I didn't think to add peanut butter. It was a good addition. I see that a few thought it was too much peanut butter but on the contrary I think it could use a little more. I'm a peanut butter freak lol. I didn't add any sugar, the smoothie truly doesn't need any if your fruit is sweet but if you have bitter strawberries I would add a pack of stevia or something. The moderations. So, I'm vegan and do not eat yogurt so I decided to use vanilla almond milk which is delicious. I still added just one banana but I used about twelve strawberries. I then added a teaspoon of maca powder. Another trick is to nix the ice and freeze the fruit. Frozen fruit gives a nice milkshake texture and also doesn't water it down. I always use 1 1/2 cups of milk because it fills my 24oz glass mason cup and it's normally a meal replacement in the morning, sometimes for lunch as well. The recipe, as is, is a 5 and it's even better for me personally with my alterations. My take on this recipe:

1 1/2 cup almond milk
10-12 frozen strawberries
1 frozen banana
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tsp maca powder

I agree with the other user that, personally, the peanut butter flavor over-powered the strawberry and banana. So next time I may add extra strawberries, or a second banana(I love bananas, and big smoothies). I used almond milk instead of yogurt, and since my strawberries were frozen, I added a little more than a half cup, to blend it better. I added about a tablespoon of chia seeds. Also, I used JIF natural Honey peanut butter, so it gave it a little added sweetness.  Definitely will try again.

This was delicious! 10 ice cubes made it a bit "icy" so I cut this in half. I also used organic strawberry yogurt this second time.

This is really really yummy. The husband and I made this last night for desert and it was delicious. We had used all of our ice when steaming broccoli for dinner, but luckily all of my strawberries and bananas were frozen, and it came out a really good consistency. Also, we only had crunchy peanut butter, but it didn't seem to make a difference - the peanuts blended up well, but I had to use a bit more pb to get the taste right (I like really peanut buttery smoothies though). Just made it again for breakfast this morning and threw in some granola - super yummy.

This was AMAZING. One of the best smoothies I've ever had! It tasted perfectly peanut butter with the strawberry and banana flavor complementing it nicely. My only alteration was that I used four frozen strawberries and took out the ice cubes.

Yummmmy! 
Taste like a PB&J Sandwich! 
Instead of 2 tbs of peanut butter I used, 1 level tbs. I put in 5 strawberries and and 1/2 banana. Everything else I kept the same. Threw in some milk at the bottom to get it going, and it turned out delicious!

Quick, easy and delicious! I used fat free vanilla yogurt instead of plain, which added a little sweetness. There was plenty for me and my finance to both have a breakfast shake! Very filling without being too heavy - will be making this for breakfast often.

Yum - I love to make this with 1/2 cup of chocolate soy milk instead of the yogurt.  Chocolate peanut butter bliss.
