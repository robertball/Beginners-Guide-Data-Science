Very tasty, I used soba buckwheat soba noodles instead which are easier to find and it was very very tasty.  Good as a side or main!

This was wonderful! I used fresh zucchini, yellow squash, carrots and bellpeppers from my garden. I also made extra sauce to use as a marinade for a chicken breast. I sliced the chicken and sauteed it in the marinade to top the noodles with for a main dish. It was a wonderfully light, yet still filling dinner for one of the hottest days of the year. Thanks!

Surprisingly good! While I was making the sauce I felt like I all I was smelling was the tart lime and sesame oil flavours over everything else which was turning me off slightly but I kept on going with the recipe. I always use half the amount of soy sauce in these types of recipe (because of sodium content) and always replace the other half with water which works out great. I didn't have whole wheat noodles so I used the regular kind and I didn't have zucchini so I sauteed some christophene instead (cause I felt it would replace the zucchini nicely and I dunno if christophene is eaten raw, I always stir-fry it) It turned out great like that, loved the different texture of crunchiness in the veggies. Back to the issue of the sauce flavour, after I tossed it all together I felt like I was still smelling the lime and sesame oil predominately but lo and behold, after it sat and got time to marry the flavours the strong smells were gone and it tasted great too! I was pleasantly surprised and I added extra pepper to mine. It was delish. Thanks for sharing.

I made it exactly as written the first time other than the kosher salt, and it was delicious. Since then, I've made a few alterations per mine and my family's preferences. I don't care for raw bell pepper or zucchini so I dropped the matchstick veggies into the pasta water for about 30 seconds just to soften them slightly. I added peanuts to the salad after it was plated. So yummy. I think I'm going to make cucumber matchsticks this time in addition to the other vegs since I like a little crunch and took that out by cooking the other vegs. Maybe some won ton skin cut into strips and quick-fried to sprinkle on top! Obviously you can customize however you wish but it is delicious as written, as well. Thank you, tyansia! edit: I forgot to mention that I couldn't find the chinese noodles, and used whole wheat spaghetti, broken into thirds, before cooking.

I really loved this recipe but made a few adjustments so didn't feel i could give it a 5...  I used spaghetti noodles and used lemon instead of lime juice.  I also added some chili oil as we like things with a little kick.  Also didn't add the Kosher salt, just used a dash of regular salt. Added some grilled teriyaki chicken and made it a meal in one.  I was pleasantly surprised when EVERYONE loved it :)

REALLY good!  Even better the next day, thus  perfect for sack lunches throughout the week.  I appreciate the fact that you can get such wonderful flavor from easy-to-find ingredients.  I used regular ole' spaghetti because our small town grocery doesn't have Asian-style noodles; worked great!  A definite make-again!

Made this with whole wheat spaghetti noodles since it was all I had and it was even better the next day for lunch.  I could handle a little more heat.

The sesame flavor really flows throughout this dish.  Next time I will use the suggestion of chile paste instead of red peppers so it has a more even spice.

This was really tasty.  I used 8 oz of linguine since that's what I had, and it was the perfect amount of noodles to sauce.  I julienned 1/2 a zucchini, and a 1/4 each of red and yellow peppers.  Then I shredded 1 carrot and added 1/2 a bag of shredded cabbage.  I wanted a little bit more of a sweet and spicy sauce vs a strong soy tasting sauce, so I added another teaspoon of brown sugar.  I used low sodium soy sauce and key lime juice which was all I had.  Very tasty, very healthy, will make again for sure.

This was really tasty- my 5 year old son had seconds!  I halved the recipe, but made all of the dressing and marinated some chicken thighs in the sauce then grilled them.  Very good.  I will make this again.

This was insanely good.  I didn't have ketchup, but used bloody mary mix and crushed tomato slices. Served over fried tofu, it made an excellent meal that is light and cool for the summer!

This was ok/good.  I should have doubled the sauce.  I think if I make it again I will medium dice the red pepper & zucchini instead of matchstick.  One suggestion I will make is to taste the sauce before adding any salt.

Tasty and quick Asian noodle salad. Took it to a barbeque this afternoon and it was gobbled up in less than 15 mins. That says it all! Two slight changes. I didn't have access to fresh Chinese noodles so I used dry udon noodles and they worked out fine. I also changed out the catsup for Thai sweet garlic pepper sauce. Excellent! I will be making it again this week for a "Girls Only Luncheon", topping it with grilled sliced chicken breast. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was delicious! I had some leftover spaghetti on hand, so I cut the recipe down and used that instead of the noodles called for. I loved the addition of all of the veggies (I added more than called for) and the sauce was really good! I think that I would make extra sauce mext time. I also added in some black sesame seeds. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was DELICIOUS! I added some cabbage for some extra crunch and it was perfect. We ate this as a side dish with chicken kabobs and it made a great meal. Will definitely make again.

Restaurant quality dish.  I used udon noodles b/c it was what they had at the store.  I also used 1/4 tsp of Sriracha sauce instead of the chili flakes.  I took this to a BBQ, and it was the first dish to go.  People wanted seconds, and it was already gone.  Next time I'll double the recipe.

Best thing about this recipe is that the ingredients are nice and simple compared to most asian recipes and the taste is very good.  Not heavy or overly salty.  I added some sauteed chinese cabbage as well as about a half teaspoon of powdered ginger (didn't have the fresh stuff).  The ginger helps to add some good spice that some of the other reviewers seemed to be missing.  Thanks!  This is a keeper.

Really good! Used linguine as that's what I had. Only added 1 teaspoon of the salt(that was plenty). Next time I will add more veggies, cut them bigger and add cilantro.

i used spaghetti noodles, omited the salt, and increased sauce to 1 1/2, because some said there wasnt enough sauce. i didnt have green onions or bell peppers. i ate it without chilling, because it looked delicious and i didnt want to wait.  even though i omitted the salt, it was plenty salty. 1 + 1/2 is a little too much sauce. it was a little too sweet for my taste. 

update: after chilling in the fridge for a couple of hours, it taste alot better. it was alot less salty and the sweetness also lessened. this is a recipe that you MUST chill for a couple hours before serving so that the flavors get absorbed.

I really enjoyed this and it went over well at my labor day picnic. I had to use Soba buckwheat noodles though b/c I couldn't find the ones listed in the ingredients here. It made a ton though! I also added cucumber matchsticks. I think next time I might add some peanuts.

I made some homemade fettucine noodles instead of using the Chinese noodles.  I had no peanuts on hand, but think that would make a good topping for this.  Next time, I will add some grilled chicken to the salad  for my carnivorous husband.  Good flavor, easy to prepare.

This was okay for us.  The flavors seemed to clash a bit for us.  I used wheat liguine, half the sesame oil and I tasted and thought it needed a little more sugar.  It was a unique noodle salad but we probably won't be having again.  I was really hoping to like it with all the yummy veggies in it and the unique sauce.  I can't put my finger on what it was that we didn't like to try to change.  Thanks for the recipe idea tho!  I enjoyed making it!

"Good first try" said my Chinese husband! Noodles too soft-I overcooked them. Next time, omit salt, since soy sauce has plenty.

I really enjoyed this salad. Who knew courgettes (zucchini) were good both cooked *and* raw? 

It needed more sauce than the recipe calls for, but other than that, it was a hit. Many thanks, Tyansia!

This was great.Only changes were to Udon noodles and add sriracha sauce. Oh I also grilled some pork chops and threw them in and julienned the veggies instead of matchstick.

I brought this to a work BBQ.  Everyone enjoyed it and asked how to make it,  I thought it was very, very good...just not great.  Will be making again.

Went over well with my hubby.  First made enough sauce to marinate chicken tenders and thought it was too salty even with low sodium soy sauce so I skipped the kosher salt altogether when I made the sauce for the noodles.  Let the chicken marinate for several hours then grilled.  Served the chicken  hot with the cold noodles...great with all the fresh veggies.  Will make again but with more sauce since it was a little dry for our taste.  Will also likely use the sauce as a marinade again, the chicken was really yummy!

Love this recipe! I omit the 2 tsp. Kosher salt, as the soy sauce adds enough saltiness. I also love that this is VEGAN without even trying to be!

This salad is very good.  I doubled the sauce recipe.    I omitted the salt since salt in addition to soy sauce seemed excessive.  I subbed sriracha sauce for crushed  red pepper.  Will make again.  Thanks tyansia :)

would have been amazing if there wasn't so much salt. I even halved the salt and it was still too much. Next time I will make it without any additional salt. Very tasty otherwise!

need to double the sauce and use some to marinate chicken for a few hours. I also used sweet chili sauce instead of ketchup and just a little bit of garlic chili sauce. Maybe use a bit less oil, too. I like to lightly fry the zucchini ina  touch of sesame oil. Delicious!

This was ok. Used linguine noodles because that's what I had. Doubled the sauce per other reviews. I don't like zucchini so I did a red and green bell pepper, carrots and peas. I wish I had cut the peppers differently. Diced rather than just in strips.  ***EDIT*** I've upped this to three stars. I made this for my lunches for the week on Sunday night. I wrote this review on Monday, but I have to say that each day it got a little better. So much so that by Thursday I was contemplating making it again.

At last!  After trying innumerable noodle salad recipes I finally found one that's a keeper.. It's all in the sauce of course, and this sauce is just right.  I think it's the ketchup and lime juice that makes the difference.  Wonderful base recipe. Thank you!

I love this salad. It satisfies my Asian craving. I  put only 1 tsp of salt and substituted the veggies ( except red pepper) with a broccoli slaw. 2nd time making it I increased the noodle amount as I found the dressing too much for such a small amount.

We loved this. Used linguini noodles and a little less than half of what the recipe calls for. Left out the sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes. Also used light soy. Ty so much for the recipe.

Excellent.  Really enjoyed this recipe tonight.  I didn't have a few things I needed so I substituted the Chinese Noodles for Whole Wheat Fettuccine and Kosher Salt for 1/2 tsp of reg salt, and I cut back a bit on the Crushed Red Pepper flakes as well.  Still quite nice with a summer meal.

Loved this tasty cold noodle salad, perfect for summer BBQ's.  I used whole wheat spaghetti.  I did double the sauce, and skipped the added salt.  Unlike most noodle salads I make, I felt this tasted best freshly dressed, I served the next day too, and but could barely taste the dressing.  Love all of the colorful veggies in this.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, tyansia.

Excellent salad, only change I made was to use sriracha sauce rather than red pepper flakes (I like it really spicy). I don't think I'll add the salt next time, the soy sauce has enough for me. this is really good either warm or cold. Thanks for sharing!

I used leftover spaghetti pasta for the noodles in this recipe.  I liked the taste of the ketchup, sesame oil, soy sauce, brown sugar and lime juice.  The salad does have kick due to the red pepper flakes and it was spicier the second day.  This was good and I wouldn't hestitate to make again with extra pasta.  Thanks tyansia for sharing.

Good base salad!  I would cut the veggies bigger, matchsticks are too small. I added broccoli too for some crunch, my hubby added grilled chicken. I’ll definitely make again. Maybe l try half the sesame oil next time to see if it has a different flavor profile.

This was a very unusual salad that my family wants me to make again and agin.  The change I made was using Soba noodles instead of Chinese wheat (our store did not have the wheat noodles).  Everything else I kept the same. Tons of flavor.  
Tip: Having never used soba noodles before I did not realize how much starch they produced.  We rinsed them 3 times to get the starch out (not sure if you are suppose to do that but it was way too much starch for us).  Also, we made this a day ahead and then let it come up to room temperature to allow the flavor to really come thru

This was a nice change of pace, but I cooked wide Chinese noodles and realized hubs would not enjoy fighting with the long noodles.  So I took the time to cut them into shorter lengths.  I would break them before cooking next time.  They also aren't the volume per pound as other noodles reviewers used, so in following many suggestions to double the sauce the amount as indicated in the recipe would have been perfect.  I will try to use the excess in another recipe the next day or two. I also decided to chop the zucchini and peppers into shorter, rather than julienne strips.  Made this much easier to eat.  This was ok but it will be awhile before I make again.

Very tasty, but much more depth & complexity to the sauce if you add some dark soy sauce (with a deep molasses flavor note), toasted sesame oil & grated fresh ginger. Yum!

Very easy and tasty. I used buckwheat noodles to make it gluten free for a party. I received many compliments on it.

Love this recipe! My son requests it regularly. I follow the recipe but add chicken for a light protein source. I haven't added nuts but I bet cashews would be awesome in this!

I used fettuccine noodles broken in half  cooked in salted water. I do not rinse my pasta and so put it directly in the sauce , tossed and allowed to cool. I then tossed in the veggies and let sit a day in fridge. Sesame oil can be strong and is different depending on who you buy,so for a crowd, I cut it in half and used sunflower oil the second time around.

Holy Moly this is good! I read the recipe and instantly craved it. I didn't have the noodles it called for so I -well, I cheated and used extra wide egg noodles as that is all I had in the house. I didn't have, because I don't like zucchini so instead I lightly browned some asparagus in butter (still crunchy, a bit) and added that. Other than that I made as written and we loved it! I can't wait to try it with the noodles it calls for - but I'll never add the zucchini again, don't like it. Plan to bring this to Easter dinner this year - I know it will go well.  You gotta make this! Oh, one other thing, I didn't add ANY of the salt; there was enough saltiness from the soy sauce. So, taste before you add it. -we didn't miss it at all!

Really tastey, I appreciate how easy it is to assemble and the ingredient list is easy on the pocketbook.  I omitted the salt and added a teaspoon of fish sauce to the dressing, and used chili garlic sauce in place of red pepper flakes, and added some bagged coleslaw mix for extra crunch.  Will definitely make this again thank you for sharing!

We loved this salad. I used udon noodles, pan-seared them in oil to give them crunch and added whatever veggies I had extra from my garden. Simply delicious.

I used spaghetti pasta (not angel hair). Plus I added chopped cilantro, jalapeño,  red and yellow peppers (not a fan of green) and did not use a zucchini. I put in some grilled chicken and served with jalapeño focaccia. I shared with my neighbor and we all loved it! I did put peanuts on top as per someone else's recommendation.

Really easy to make and tasty. My daughter's love them. The only thing I changed were I only sprinkle brown sugar  and didn't use salt at all and it was still delicious. I used cilantro instead of green onion. Smelled nice too. I was a little short on sauce so I add a little more ketchup and it was fine.

Very good.  Only slightly modified - used honey in place of brown sugar, chili paste in place of red pepper flakes and added bean sprouts.  Excellent recipe.

I made this recipe last night, and totally loved it.  I used linguine noodles because I like the texture and heft of them, and they worked well with the flavors and textures of the sauce and vegetables.  This one's definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

Really good. I think next time I would leave out the ketchup and just use a couple teaspoons of rice wine vinegar.

I make it with Thai rice noodles and tamari so it's gluten-free. Also, I add chicken on occasion for a wonderful summer main dish. Like others, I use chili paste rather than red pepper flakes.  A favorite!

Just finished making this and it's wonderful.  I doubled the sauce part and couldn't imagine it being made with less.  Also, I used spaghetti instead of the noodles because that's what I had on hand.  Try it; it's addicting.

I love toasted sesame oil, but this seemed like way too much.  So I added a bit at a time until it was just the way I like it.    I added an extra squirt of lime juice cause it was just a little too sweet for me.
