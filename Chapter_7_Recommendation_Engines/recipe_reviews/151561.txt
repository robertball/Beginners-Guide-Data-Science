DELICIOUS!!!!

I made more than required peanut butter/honey combo, and loved the extra PB to chocolate proportion!

I didn't have enough honey, so used pancake syrup, and had no chocolate chips, so used white chocolate chips and they were great! Will definately make again and use same ingrediants.
