FANTASTIC!!  You have to be fond of feta cheese and greek flavorings, however.  I used kalamata olives instead.  I made this then spread it on whole wheat tortillas, laid roasted red peppers in a strip down the middle and rolled them up.  Then I cut them (carefully) into pinwheels. Everyone RAVED about them!  The spread is awesome. Thanks for a great recipe!

The whole party loved it! Will make again and everyone asked for the recipe.

Could be my food processor, but pulse didn't work for me. The mixture was too thick.

i highly recommend blending the sun-dried tomatoes in at the end with the black olives, to avoid the appearance of canned cat food!  everyone that tried it absolutely loved it.

We serve this every year on New Years Eve.  What a great party dip!  Remember to let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, and the intense saltiness of the feta will fade and the flavors will meld.

WOW!!  I don't give many recipes 5 stars, but this was excellent!  I put the olives in the processor (I used kalamata).  I then garnished with some sun dried tomatoes, olives and basil.  I think you could add some fresh basil for a more complex flavor.  I will make this again it was yummy.

I am Greek and this spread is a party in my mouth!  I made it for a friend and we ate the entire thing in one sitting.  The strong flavors make this especially different and a cut above the rest.

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make!  The only thing I changed was that I used kalamata olives instead of plain black olives - and it was so wonderful!  I served it with sliced baguette.  I couldn't believe how much flavor was packed into each mouthful!  It was a hit at the party I brought it to.  I will definitely make this one again.  It's a nice orangish-red color, so I served it in a a green shallow dish with a sprig of fresh thyme on top.  Beautiful and delicious!

This was really good lots of good feta/greek flavour(which I love)!
My consistancy was quite dry/crumbly, so I added more oil. Will definately make again :)

Lovely. Strong. Feta.  I chopped half of the sun dried tomatoes. I soaked these with the rest of the sun. toms. in hot water for a few minutes to soften. I added the whole pieces into the processor when I made the dip and then stirred the chopped pieces in with the chopped olives. I feel this gave the toms a better presence so my guests knew what they were eating. This is great on pita, celery and carrots. It is stiff so you can't dip you need to spread.

I found the salty taste did not diminish with time, and it definitely isn't appetizing to look at, buuuuut everyone loved it, as did I. Once you have a taste, you just keep going back for more. It grows on you. To make it look better, I garnishd with a drizzle of olive oil, a few whole kalamatas, some of the chopped sundried tomatoes, and a sprinkle of the crumbled feta.

I read all reviews and combined with another recipe very similar...It was so wonderful and people will want the recipe! Here is what I did:  I combined sour cream, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and feta cheese...approx. 8 oz. of each and added some olive oil, lemon juice, green onions, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, oregano.  After blending those, I folded in Kalamata olives and a few more chopped sundried tomatoes!!!!  Served with toasted french baguette slices and whole grain toasted pita chips....Wonderlicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is delicious! I was buying a spread that was just like this ...& it wasn't cheap. I looked at the ingredients, then saw your recipe..it's almost the same so I've adopted your recipe instead of buying the other one. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I use kalamata olives instead of black olves.  I also serve is on toasted baguette slices.  It is always a hit.

This would be a five star but the calories are calculated for one serving of 2 tbs.  This is SO yummy, there's no way that is a serving.  
I didn't closely measure the ingredients, as I was using up things in my frig.  I soaked dried sun-dried tomatoes in hot water for 20 min. I threw all of the ingredients into my food processor at one time. 
So good!

Great recipe!  Excellent flavors, and those I served it to were asking for the recipe all night long!  Yes, it's a bit salty, but I don't mind that.  It definitely is stiff (especially if you refrigerate it beforehand), so be aware of that.  The presentation/look of the dish is just so-so, and it is critical for this reason that you not process the olives.  Good food!

This recipe has everything that is good and perfect in Mediterranean cuisine! I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and kalamata olives (go for the Kalamata!). I also had to add a bit more olive oil - I think it will vary depending on the moisture content of your feta cheese (mine was pre-crumbled so I think it was a bit drier than a whole block of feta). Also paired it with Lavash cracker bread from this site and it paired well.

This spread is sooo good and easy, easy, easy.  I always add more garlic to taste and eyeball the amount of olive oil to make a softer "paste".  Serve it with toasted baguette.  One of the most requested recipes I have.

Great dip! Made it for Thanksgiving - it was gone in 20 minutes. I made it the night before and added a little oil to moisten it up right before serving - also garnished with whole olives on the side.

I was looking for a spread that was "different & delicious" and I found it here! Everyone loves it and I have been asked for the recipe many times. It has a VERY strong feta cheese flavor. It's not mild at all. But if you really like feta cheese this is a great spread!

I couldn't believe how so much flavor resulted with a simple recipe! I used this as a tapenade on a veggie sandwich which improved the normal sandwich considerably. The remainder will be used as a spread for crackers or tortilla chips. Wonderful!

Excellent! My co-workers raved about this, and I couldn't stop eating it! It is VERY good! I did add a little extra lemon juice to thin it out slightly, but it was still better to spread than dip. I will definitely make this again.

I love all of the ingredients in this dish but not this recipe unfortunately.  Much too salty and not enough ingredients.  The feta should not be the main ingredient b/c it makes it too salty.  Maybe making a base of sour cream would tone down the saltiness.

I used kalamata olives also, and as the mixture was thick, I added a drizzle of olive oil and a little more lemon juice. Yum! this is a winner

Absolutely excellent!  I used kalamata olives and made it the night before I served it.  The saltiness that is there when you first put it together goes away if you let it chill for a while.  Everyone who tried it went crazy over it.  I will definitely be making this one again and again!!!

Great Recipe!! added the olives in with the lot to make a paste, and didn't add the oil ( not a fan of 'oils') and was GREAT!! has plenty of flavour to go with water crackers, will definately do again for my next party :). i'm sure if you followed recipes as it would taste just as great :D

Absolutely delicious!  I used fat-free feta and it was marvelous!  I read these reviews beforehand and took the advice to mix in the sun-dried tomatoes with the olives and it came out very pretty!  Great dip for veggies or pitas and a huge hit with my friends!

The spread was a nice consistency, but had a very strong taste.  It didn't appear to be very popular at the party that I brought it too.

This was pretty good, although a little strong with the sundried tomatoes.  But all in all, I would make again.  Tastes good with Kalmata olives.

I must have done something wrong on this because it was a very strong feta flavor.  Make sure you fold in the olives instead of putting them in the food processor to prevent your dish from looking like cat food- like mine did. Some guests like this but I won't make it again.

Everyone loved this!!  It was very easy to make, i just put everything in the food proccessor, toasted some buttered french bread in the oven and it was gone very quickly.  It is good cold, and better after it sits a day, but i also tried it hot on a piece of toast and the sun dried tomatos really stood out, almost like pizza!  A keeper in our recipe collection!

I love this dip/spread. The Mediterranian Market where I live makes a very similar dip using sliced green and black olives instead of chopped black olives and they add a bit of hot pepper flakes. Anyway you want to do it, it's spectacular.

The feta cheese was very strong in this recipe.  It may have been only the cheese that I used.  However, after sitting in the fridge over night, I was afraid of serving the potent flavors, and blended in some softened cream cheese in order to try to balance the flavors.  As a dip (with toasted pita crisps and veggies), it didn't receive top raves.  But, (per another review) I spread some on whole wheat flour tortillas, added roasted pepper strips and sliced (after chilling) into pinwheels.  Those were gobbled up.  I guess I just had to present the recipe correctly for my guests.  :)

This recipe is fantastic. I have made it twice in the last week after discovering it, and my boyfriend and I devoured it with a spoon both times. It is so good! I used kalamata olives, and used the sun dried tomato oil instead of the olive oil the recipe called for. Absolutely delicious.

This was a huge hit and so easy to make. Just a few changes- replaced oregano with basil, bit more olive oil and Athena brand Mediterranean Herb feta. Yummy!
