This was awesum! Since the corn and kale had to cooked- i made it a warm dish- simmered onion, garlic, and red pepper while kale cooked. Added oj, homemade salsa, and frozen corn. Simmered few minutes and added the kale. Salted to taste and it was a hit!

This was very good.  Didn't have any pineapple juice, OJ worked just fine.  My husband (who doesn't like Kale) even enjoyed it.  Thanks!

I halved the veggie portion and kept the dressing portion the same (in case more was needed) for my husband and me.  I thought it was quite good, my husband loves this!  He just got done saying his fourth "godDANG!" since he started eating dinner.  Will make again.  Oops, also added a wee bit of red onion and minced jalape√±o.

I was super happy w/ the recipe.  I put the kale in an ice bath so it was served as a cold salad.  I think I've found my new dip for vegetables, the dressing is sper yummy.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

I have never used Kale before and decided to try something different. I also substituted the pineapple juice for orange juice and used frozen corn to save on time and it worked out great! My family loved it and I will definitely make this again.

The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the peppers.  The flavors are good and will definitely make it again!

Hubby and I thought it was okay, but we didn't love it. Our babysitter really liked it, though. I did substitute OJ for pineapple juice and used a little fresh onion since I was out of onion powder. If I make it again (doubtful), I'll try doing it as a warm dish like whole planet mom suggested.
