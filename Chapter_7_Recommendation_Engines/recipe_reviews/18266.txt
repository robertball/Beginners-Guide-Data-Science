I've been making this recipe for years and my tip for this recipe is to add the parmesan to the mustard/mayo mixture before you spread it on the cauliflower.  Less waste!

Some REALLY good advice... Steam for 10 minutes and check to see if it's done enough. I steamed for 30 minutes like the directions say, and it turned into mush. The next time I made this, I tried 10 minutes and it was perfect! I was out of Parmesan cheese so I covered with chedder cheese. When steamed properly, this is definately a very good veggy.

This is a good recipe to use up things you have on hand. In my case it was a head of cauliflower! ;)  I agree with other reviewers that 30 minutes is too long to steam the cauliflower. I steamed mine in an electric steamer for 15 minutes and let it drain well. The sauce is great but you will need to adjust it to your own personal tastes -- are you a mayonaise or mustard person. If you have a preference you might want to increase your favorite. In our case we used 2 T mayo to 1 T mustard. I also added a sprinkle of grated cheddar cheese to the top because I was afraid it would dry out too much. Next time I will make a lot more sauce. My family liked it and wanted to taste more of it on the cauliflower. I am going to also try to thicken the sauce some so it will stick to the cauliflower instead of have to be drizzled over the top. Good "different" recipe.

I used much less butter, and added crushed fresh garlic into the mayo mixture, added plenty of pepper. Steamed for only 10 minutes then put the mayo mixture on, then topped it with 1/4 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese and broiled it until the cheese was brown and bubbly. I have used American cheese slices as well. SO GOOD. If you add the cheese you dont really need the butter.

OH WOW!!! This is really good! Both my husband and myself loved it. Hubby asked me to make again this way next time we have cauliflower. It is a beautiful change from cheesy sauce. I took others advice and only cooked veggie 10 mins and I doubled the mayo but not the mustard and the sauce was just right. I will make this again and agian.

This was really good!   I made minor changes.  I only steamed the cauliflower for 10-15 mins. I also increased both the mayo & mustard to 1 tablespoon and mixed the parmesan cheese with them.  After spreading the mixture on the cauliflower and dotting with butter I placed it in my toaster oven for 30 minutes. Yum!

not bad.  steamed in microwave for 5:30 minutes.  used no mustard at all, used no butter at all, and used 1 heaping tablespoon mayo and premixed with parmesan, paprika, pinch of garlic powder.  added shredded cheese.  next time:  cut up cauliflower (easier to coat in mixture this way), use a thinner coat of sauce (water it down? maybe don't premix with parmesan?), do not add shredded cheese, bake at a higher temp for crispier results?

This is the best cauliflower recipe ever!  I used Apricot Mustard because I had it on hand and it was delicious. If I am in a hurry I microwave the cauliflower as florets then add the toppings and grill until brown.  My family can eat a whole cauliflower for dinner now.  Guests give me skeptical looks when I say I've made them Baked Cauliflower, but there is NEVER any left!  Thanks so much, from Sydney Australia.

I made a half recipe of this but I only halved the cauliflower, if that makes sense. To give it a little more flavor, I added onion/garlic powder and Frank's Hot Sauce. We all loved this, though I think the butter could be cut back.

I don't believe in down grading a recipe that I've changed. I would have graded this a 4 star based on reviews had I not modified a few things.  First, I steamed florets for 10 minutes.  I used 2t mayo and 2t dijon.  I used a pastry brush to brush on, as evenly as I could, the sauce.  I sprinkled a little parm on it.  I get overwhelmed easily by parm.  I then grated a little mild cheddar over the top.  I omitted the dotting with butter part completely and instead I sauted 1/2 cup of plain breadcrumbs in a little bit of olive oil until golden.  I added a pinch of salt to the breadcrumbs but should have added more.  I covered dish with crumbs then baked.  All I can say is my husband ate cauliflower for the first time in his life and went back for seconds.  Amazing!  I will be adding this recipe to my reportoire for sure!

I would suggest steaming for only 20 minutes and not the entire 30 minutes as it was a little overdone and a little too soggy by the time it made it in the oven.

Great taste!  The more cheese the better!

Very good, easy.  be sure to towel dry the cauliflower after steaming, otherwise the dish is watery.

I followed another reviewer's advice and steamed the cauliflower for only 10-12 minutes so that it would have a firmer texture.  I used dijon mustard and spread the mixture on with a pastry brush, which worked well.  It made a nice presentation for an intimate Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this with frozen cauliflower, no steaming, just popped it in with the ingredients and 30 min cooking time. It was great! Easy and delicious!

This is my new favorite way to cook cauliflower!  I just knew the small amount of mayonnaise and mustard couldn't possibly cover all that cauliflower, but it did.  I spread it on with a pastry brush. I cut the butter down to 2 T. and added salt, and it was perfect.  I do think, though, that the steam time could be about 10-15 minutes.

Pretty good for Cauliflower.  I took the advice of other reviewers and adjusted the mustard/mayo blend.  
I'll be making this again - next time cauliflower is on sale at the store!

Wow.... yummy!  I broke up the cauliflower into random size pieces and then boiled for 10 min.  I used fresh grated parmesan and about 1/4 cup grated cheddar.  It had just the right amount of cheesiness. (I dont like it smothered)Make sure to drain the cauliflower well as it was a little watery after baking.  My boyfriend doesnt like veggies but he had 2 helpings!  So easy, its definitely going into my recipe book!

When I first tasted the cauliflower I thought it was good, my boyfriend thought it was great! At first I didn't realize that the longer you cook it the better it is. THe brown-ness on the cauliflower is actually the best part. I made this recipe again and I was very sad because I didn't have parmesan cheese, but I tried it with cheddar cheese, it still turned out great but doesn't brown as nice as the parmesan. Make sure to cook for the the full 30 minutes to get the brown effect, it makes the recipe. Also, only steam for 10-15 min depending on how big your cauliflower head is.

Very good recipe.  I'd had one similar years ago but had lost.  I'm glad I found it again.  I steamed for about 15 min. then baked it for 15 minutes.  Any more and it would have fallen apart too much.  I also didn't use the butter but I doubled the sauce and used cheddar cheese.

VERY TASTY!  STEAM FOR NO LONGER THAN 15 MINUTES AS OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGESTED.  I HAD A LARGE HEAD OF CAULIFLOWER AND DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF MAYO/MUSTARD MIXTURE - EVEN MORE WOULD NOT HURT - IT WAS THAT TASTY - ENJOY.

This stuff was really really good!! I doubled up on the mayo mixture cause it just didnt seem like enough. I also added some sharp white cheddar to the mix. My hubby really liked it and hes not much of a cauliflower fan.

I steamed for 15 and baked for 20-25. Probably depends on the oven. I also used twice the mayo (light olive oil mayo) and mixed everything, including the butter in a bowl before I spread it. It looked pretty ugly when it came out of the oven, but once you chop/mix it up in a bowl, it's fabulous!!!

Another great addition to the not-so-usual dinner portfolio.  This is an excellent side dish and easy to make.

I did however tweak things a wee bit... but only in the presentation.  I trimmed up a head of cauliflower, "steamed" it in the microwave wieht about a half cup of water, leaving the entire head intact to cook until it was just about "al dente".  

Then I continued with the above recipe but increased the amount of mayonnaise to 3 tablespoons and the prepared mustard to 2 teaspoons.  Then folded in grated Parmesan (half cup).  This mixture I spread over the par-cooked head of cauliflower then proceeded to bake as directed.

The result was a nice golden brown presentation of cauliflower that we simply sliced to serve.  Not the usual veggie side dish!

The whole family really enjoyed this dish!  Cut into smaller pieces and steamed for 15 minutes.  Upped the mayo and mustard to a Tbsp, added about a tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 C shredded cheddar.  Combined the mayo, mustard, butter, cheeses, and garlic powder and tossed with pieces of steamed cauliflower prior to baking.

I had a beautiful head of cauliflower and decided on this recipe..a WINNER!  It was so good!!  Very simple to put together and delightful to the taste buds. I never make cauliflower, hardly ever, but this will be made often.

I used half a head of cauliflower and nuked it whole in a covered dish for 4 mins. Then broke it down into florets with a knife. I greased a smallish casserole dish, placed the cauliflower in it, then mixed the mayo, mustard, and parm and sprinkled it over the top with my fingers, then dotted the top with the cut up butter. Yum. Served with Roasted Potatoes and Greens and Golden Baked Chicken, also from this site.

This recipe did not impress me at all. There was just not enough  flavor. I agree with others you only need to steam this about 10 to 15 minutes. I did double up on the mayo and mustard and still wasn't enough flavor .

Dinner party SAFE!  This was great for kids and adults.  I used a pastry brush and brushed on the mayo-deli mustard mixture on each cooled cauliflower head.  I add the parm on a layer than worked my way up.  I am making this tonignt for my boyfriend and I.  It's carb diet friendly!

I LOVE this recipe. I will never eat plain steamed cauliflower again. I did make some changes according to others' reviews. I cut the florets pretty small, and only steamed them for appx 10 min. I mixed a heaping T of mayo and mustard, added 1/2 cup of parm. cheese and mixed it well, then dumped the steamed cauliflower on top of it, mixed it all up -spread it out in a dish and baked for 30 min. I also completely omitted the butter. I will make this again, often.

my family loved this. I used 2T mayo, 1T country dijon mustard, 1T apricot preserves, 1/2tsp. garlic salt, and 1/2tsp onion powder and mixed those together. I also steamed for less time-approx 10-15 min. I substituted white cheddar. I did use the butter called for. This is a great basic recipe to be creative with. My family will definitely eat cauliflower now.

I absolutely love this recipe! I love cauliflower but my husband isn't a fan, but he likes this dish. We sometimes add blue cheese and gorgonzola crumbs to add a little more cheese flavor.

For those who don't like cauliflower, this is the recipe. The flavoring combo of mayo & mustard is fantastic, but mix a little extra. Instead of dabbing with margarine/butter, you can also use butter spray over the top before baking (it's much more even than dabs).

I had this recipe years ago and somehow misplaced it.  I was glad to find it again.  I didn't use a whole cauliflower as there are only 2 of us - just cut up flowerets and steamed them in the microwave for 5 min, then put the toppings on and baked for about 1/2 hr.  Hubby loved it!!  He said it was the best way he had ever had cauliflower.  Good recipe that I will be making again.

I'm not a huge cauliflower fan, but I LOVED this! It is fattening, yes, but it went together perfectly with the Christmas ham. Don't change the recipe at all. I did cut the cauliflower head into pieces, though, because I wasn't sure if I could bake it as was. But it was harder to put the topping on lots of pieces instead of one head.

I really enjoyed this one.  I was very skeptical about using mayo and especially mustard on my cauliflower but thought what the heck.  I used more than the amount of mayo b/c it just didn't seem like the original would even come close to coating it.  kept the mustard the same as it's strong and also added all the cheese in with the mixture.  I cut mine into florets first then steamed for 12 minutes and then mixed the mixture all over the florets, i though it would get coated on every piece that way and it did.  then i grated just a bit more Ramano (my cheese of choice) on top, added a sliced garlic or two and threw in the oven.  So yummy, husband liked too but 8 yr old did not, he couldn't get past the mustard thing.  it kind of got puffy after baking and just a little brown on top from the cheese!

I thought this was excellent!  I followed the previous reviewers suggestions of doubling the mayo/mustard mix, but I ended up using 2 T. of mayo and only 2 t. of mustard, as my husband is not a huge mustard fan.  I used dijon mustard.  I also steamed the florets for only 10 minutes, as suggested in previous reviews, as we like our cauliflower only lightly cooked.  I'll be passing this recipe on to friends!

This is one of our favorite vegetables to serve with dinner.  But I like to sprinkle a little paprika and garlic powder after the mayonnaise and mustard mixture is spread.  It gives it just a little more flavor.  I also steam the cauliflower in the microwave since that only takes about 6 minutes.  I don’t really measure the ingredient anymore, I just portion them the way that I like.

I don't have a steamer so I broke half a cauli into large florets, and boiled them for 10 mins 'til tender. Even though I made enough cheesy topping for one whole head (I used half Parmesan, half extra-sharp Cheddar), there wasn't enough! This was such a shame as it was SO tasty! I will definitely make it again but make enough topping so that all the cauli is smothered!! Thanks, Bea!

If you use frozen cauliflower, don't even thaw it.  Just start at Direction #2.  Good variation for a veggie.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish, impressive enough for company and simple enough for every day. I substituted asiago cheese and only boiled my cauliflower for about 10-12 min and that made it aldente and easier to cut into wedges once out of the oven.Thanx.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I upped the mayo/mustard ratio 2T mayo/1T mustard.  I used cheddar b/c that's what I had.  I sliced the cauliflower into 1/2" "steaks", steamed them in the microwave for about 4 minutes then laid them on paper towels to drain.  I arranged them in a baking dish and finished them as per the instructions.  My husband was in heaven-I promised to make them again this weekend.  This is an easy recipe to adjust.  Add a bit of garlic or thyme, mustard powder, or red pepper flakes.  Play around with it!

Yummy this was very good.  My husband and son loved it too.  I did increase the mayo and mustard to my taste.  I also used frozen cauliflower and cooked it in the microwave as the package directs before putting it in a casserole dish. Lots of cheese!  It is now a regular side dish at my table.

I really enjoyed it.  I cut up the cauliflower and steamed it that way.  I also doubled the mixture that went on top.  Good flavor.

I thought it was great! I took others' advice about a short steam for cauliflower, but also added brocolli florets. Then I increased the mayonaise (2 tbs) and mustard (1 tbs), added minced garlic and pepper, and mixed all that together with half of the shredded cheddar. The rest of the cheese I sprinkled over the top. The one thing I wish I hadn't done differently was using dijon mustard, it was a bit overpowering.

This had excellent flavor but I didn't cook it long enough.  I mistakenly thought if I just put water in the bottom of the casserole dish and cooked it longer that it would turn out okay.... not so much.  My husband wouldn't touch it because it was crunchy but I ate it and it had a good flavor... I will try it again as it says in the recipe :)

I cut my cauliflower up in big pieces and steamed it for about 7 minutes in about an inch of water.  Drained, put in pie plate and spread on mayo/mustard with pastry brush.  I omitted the butter and drizzled the steamed cauliflower with a bit of olive oil, sprinkled on Parmesan cheese. Baked as directed.  This was delicious.

Only needed to steam for 10 minutes...  I also added a little sprinkle of mild cheddar on top during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  This is a good way to get kids to eat their cauliflower if they are resistant to it "plain".  Even my hubby said I should cook it this way more often!

I made this for a crowd and it was a huge hit.  Even those at the table who weren't big cauliflower fans wolfed theirs down.  I added a little extra Parmesan cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I'll start by saying that I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and that my kids and I never liked either vegis before. This is how I steamed my broccoli: I placed about 1 lb of flowerets in a gallon-sized freezer ziploc with 3 Tbsp chicken broth and sealed all except an inch and set it in my microwave for 3 minutes. When it was ready, I spooned the sauce over the broccoli and placed it back in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Took it out and stirred. It was marvelous! Oh... and I also used I can't believe it's not butter! light, and best foods reduced fat mayo as substitute

YUMMY!!! only changes were out of necessity... I didn't have any mayo on hand so I substituted with miracle whip and used spicy brown mustard. Also used a generous tablespoon of each instead of tsp. Hubby and I at the entire head without blinking. Also, I microwave steamed the cauliflower for about 7 minutes on the raw vegetable setting. New favorite way to eat cauliflower.

I had to modify it because I did not have mayo.  I used ranch dressing instead and added garlic salt and black pepper.  I steamed it for only 10 minutes based on prior suggestions.  Very, very good!  Perfect consistency and I think the ranch substitution added some flavor.

I like this recipe. I separate the head of cauliflower and steam for 10-15 minutes. I haven't increased the amount of mustard or mayo, but I do use a brush to put it on. It is still good if you use less butter/oleo.

I made this but was not impressed at all! Such a small amount of mustard and mayo that it didn't do much for the taste. It was pretty but not very tasty. Will try others from this site next time and take this one out of my recipe box.

This was definitely a good recipe for cauliflower, and different, so it caught my eye!  Per other reviews, I steamed for only 12 mins and also mixed the fresh parm with the mustard/mayo to spread.  I upped the amounts of mustard and mayo to 2 tsps of each, but I still didn't find there was much to spread in order to cover all of it.  Anyway, good flavour and cooked nicely with cutting down the steam time.  I will still say my fav cauliflower recipe is the Roasted Garlic one from this site.  Thanks for the post!

Very good recipe and easy....only I think 30 minutes is too long to steam the cauliflower....mine came out very mushy, still good, but I would cook it less next time.

I've made this before and it was great, but I made some changes this last time that were amazing.  Instead of the mayo and mustard, I purchased a jar of "Thai Mayonnaise" which I spread on the cauliflower, then covered it in Swiss cheese before baking til golden brown.  It was spicy, but the flavors were unbelievable together.

Cauliflower is a hard sell at my house, but everyone enjoyed this. I steamed for only 5 minutes in the microwave in my pampered chef micro cooker. Very good!

Very tasty.  I took advice of others and doubled sauce mixture - the amount was perfect.  I also added cheddar cheese on the top.  I will mix cheddar throughout next time.  All in all, a very good recipe.

Excellent. I used frozen cauliflower and Dijon mustard because that is what I had on hand. Even my husband who does not like cauliflower liked it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and it's the only way I will make cauliflower from now on.  I mix a generous portion of mayo (about 1/2 cup), a squirt of mustard and about 1/4 cup of parmesan together and coat the cauliflower before dotting it with butter.  It only takes about 15-20 minutes to brown in a 350 degree oven.  It is delicious!

Tried this out at Thanksgiving a few years ago and it became the new favorite way to have cauliflower. I make more of the mustard sauce, usually 2-3 times what's called for so all parts can be covered. Very tasty and so simple to make!

Superb and much better than the traditional "steam it and pour some cheese sauce on it".
Liking our cauliflower fairly firm, I only steamed for 10 minutes. The result was firm but not crunchy. I think steaming it for as long as listed is much too long.

I thought this was delicious. My 1 year old loved it, too! It was a refreshing change to the cheddar cheesy kind of cauliflower. I added paprika and put in extra mayonnaise and a garlic clove. I steamed it for 20 minutes instead of 30. My husband does not like cauliflower and didn't care for this, but it wasn't the recipe. It was the cauliflower! thanks for a great recipe.

This was good.  It was a new way for me to cook cauliflower.  I usually cut it up.  I liked the fact that it browned in the oven.  My husband said he'd like to try it with cheddar cheese next time.

This was okay, nothing special. I probably would just perfer buttered steamed cauliflower. On the other hand my mom absolutely loved this, but she loves cauliflower. It probably all depends on your taste buds.

I got a similar recipe from my stepmom a few years ago and it's FANTASTIC! The only difference is I steam my cauliflower in the microwave and use cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. I hated cauliflower before I tried this recipe, and I've tried it with broccoli too - it's pretty good, but not nearly as yummy as it is with the cauliflower!

I've been doing one like this for years, differences being: after covering with mayo/mustard combo, top with grated cheddar and a little parmesan, then microwave for 1-2 minutes to melt the cheeses.  Much easier, and we prefer the cauliflower not to be browned.

We just didn't like this. Nothing wrong with it really, it just didn't suit our taste. Personally, I thought the tangy flavor from the mustard just didn't go together well at all with the flavor of the cauliflower. No one really touched this.

Steamed cauliflower in microwave for only 5 minutes - that was sufficient.
added 1 heaping tablespoon mayo, 1T mustard, sprinkle of cayenne, 1 clove garlic crushed. yummy!
Will add a little more cayenne or spicy paprika and a little salt to taste - maybe 1/2 teaspoon -  next time.

Instead of a head of cauliflower, I use frozen bagged florets.  I microwave them first, then put in bowl.  Mix the butter, mayo and mustard, then mix with the cauliflower.  I usually make double the mixture for a family size bag of cauliflower.  Put in baking dish and sprinkle the Parmesan over the top.  I have also added a little pepper and cubed grilled chicken.

This is my new favorite side dish.  I have made it 4 times now and I finally have the combination I like down pat.  I mix mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Parm or mozzarella, basil infused extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, pepper.  It turns out delicious every time.

One of the best cauliflower recipes I've made.  I double the mayo and mustard, mix some cheese into the mixture and then sprinkle some on top as well. No salt is needed but I add a bit of black pepper.

very yummy!   like everyone else said, I steamed it for 15 minutes, 30 minutes would be way too long.   i used  a tablespoon of mayo and a tablespoon of mustard, and instead of dotting the butter on top, I melted it and sautéed some onions and garlic in the butter, then  poured it over the top, then topped with cheese.   I think next time I would use less butter, because between the butter and mayo  it was pretty slippery...but delicious!!!

I added some milk to the mustard and mayo, drizzled it over the cali. I also melted butter and drizzled that over. I added some panko bread crumbs to it and also the fresh pepper along with some smoked paprika.  I thought of cajun spice or cayenne pepper but first time I limit my experimentation. I sprayed the dish with some pam.  This is one of those veggies you can alter with salt to heavy spice and it should taste great.

So much tastier then I expected. I read other review saying to only steam the broccoli for 10-15 minutes. I steamed mine for 12. I also left them in the oven for 35 minutes instead of 30.

This was okay. The cauli doesn't take that long to steam... 15 mins was plenty. I cut down the amount of butter as it was unnecessary. It makes for a change from really milky cheese sauce.

I used more mayo & mustard than the recipe called for. I also used dijon mustard since no type was specified. It was delicious!! We have it with cajun spiced pork chops. Paired nicely together!

I steamed and baked the whole head as a whole head, and it turned out beautifully. Also, I didn't have any Parmesan, but cheddar turned out to be a nice substitute.

awesome! rubbed mine with cut garlic before adding mayo mixture which I added 1/2 of the butter melted and a dash of smoked paprika. I also steamed for only 10-15 minutes and finished in the oven for 30 mins on 375.

This was a better alternative than just boiling cauliflower. Steamed in the microwave for 5 minutes, as others suggested, and I upped the mayo & mustard to 1 Tbspn each. I sprinkled some shredded cheddar on top before serving and skipped the butter. 2nd Note: put non-stick spray on the baking dish.

I really liked this, but I used 2 tbs sour cream and 2 tbs mustard and I heated it up on the stove instead of in the oven.  I think otherwise it would have been too dry and flavorless.

Everyone loves this recipe when I make it as a side dish for when my husband barbecues. I agree with the other reviews that you should only steam until about half done- it will keep going in the oven. I like to add a healthy pinch of black pepper as well as some red pepper flakes for a little extra kick. Great recipe to alter and add to depending on your mood.

I made this recipe the first time 'as is' and it was good.  The second time I followed the suggestions of 1 tablespoon mayo & 1 tablespoon mustard and used  half as much butter by cutting it in small cubes to distribute.  The family LOVES it, and we're not big fans of cauliflower, so that says a lot.  Next time I think I'll try steaming it less as it's still just a bit mushier than I like.  This is a 5 star with the changes.

SUPER EASY. This is great with broccoli too. I gave it 4 stars because it needed more of the mayo/mustard mixture, and I sprinkled the parm after I smothered the mayo/mustard on them. This gave for a more even coating

I came across this recipe last night after wracking my brain for something different to go with Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches...it was really good! My husband and I ate the whole head in one sitting. The only thing I changed was to use Dijon mustard, and the only thing I would change next time would be to steam the cauliflower for 15 minutes instead of 30. Yum!

I have to say I wasn't crazy about this dish, but in all fairness, I adjusted the recipe per some of the member reviews.   The little next girl thought it was the best, so I'll have to try it again without changing anything and see how it goes.

I was a little unsure about this recipe, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I used a silicone brush and brushed the mayo/mustard mixture to spread it more evenly.  I steamed the cauliflower less time, my family prefers a 'crispier' veg.  All in all I really enjoyed it.  I would certainly make it again! Thanks for the recipe.

This was a wonderful way to prepare cauliflower. I used what I had on hand... a sweet hot mustard and adjusted the amounts of mayo and mustard. I also used a packaged blend of parmesian, romano, asiago cheese. Steamed cauliflower 10 min. and baked 15 minutes... Delicious!

I made the sauce by tablespoons w/more mustard. Added a little curry powder and olive oil. What a hit! Taste just like mac n' cheese.

I used half a head of cauliflower and half a head of broccoli, both broken down into small pieces.  I steamed for around 10 minutes, just until tender.  I used a tbsp. each of mustard and mayo, and tossed it in a mixing bowl with the broccoli and cauliflower to coat it before putting it in a pan.  I baked it for 15 minutes, then put some shredded cheese on top for 5 minutes.  (I had no parmesan).  This turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

I took the advice of the others and stemaed the cauliflower for only 10 minutes.  I used a little more cheese.  This is a very yummy low carb veggie!

This was decent-I am always looking for new ways to make cauliflower since I will only eat it cooked. I made much more of the mayo/mustard sauce than the recipe called for-I didn't measure but maybe 1/2-1 C total. I did use dijon mustard. Overall it was pretty good, but we really like the Nany's Cheesy Cauliflower Casserole from this site. But this recipe was pretty decent and everyone ate it.

This was fantastic!  I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave. Also used less butter (only 1 T.) which I melted, then I mixed everything together instead of sprinkling the cheese over the cauliflower.  I'll definitely make this again!!

This was just okay for me.  I may have done something wrong, but it didn't blow me out of the water.  I will make it again though, and the next time I will try to season it better.  It was just missing something to me.  I do like really seasoned dishes, so maybe that was it.  It's not bad, but it's not my favorite.  I'm sorry!!!

I'm not a cauliflower person, but I liked this recipe. I changed olive oil for the butter.  Mixed it with honey mustard, low fat mayo, two cloves garlic and a sprinkle of less salt season all. Brushed this on to my 10 min. steamed cauliflower and grated fresh parmesan on top.  Loved it and had the left overs in my salad next day.

This is a great way to serve cauliflower! I added a little more mayo than mustard (I used a 2:1 ratio), mixed the parma into the mixture, and sprinkled a little extra cheese on top just to make it a little more cheese-a-licious. I had a small head of cauliflower and only steamed it for about 10 minutes, and baked for maybe 20. I had orange cauliflower so it was a little too orange/yellow looking for me. Purple would have really made it rock, or green. I will most certainly be making this again with Broccoli or whatever other cauli I pick up. Great Recipe!

LOVED this recipe.  i didn't leave the head whole, but cut up.  other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  i was getting bored with plain ole cauliflower and this hit the spot.  however, my son who loves cauliflower, didn't care for it and prefers it plain with cheese.

Amazing! Definitely cut the cauliflower steam time and increase the cheese. I replaced butter with olive oil and cut down on the mustard.  I also added garlic and shallots.  Despite our Thanksgiving feast there was virtually no cauliflower left. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this!  I suggest at least doubling the mayo.  It coated much better.  I also used spray butter and light mayo to make it healthier.  It was a nice change from the same old steamed cauliflower with Velveeta cheese.  We will definitely make this again!

I was skeptical about the mustard, but I prepared it as written. We loved it. Only the second time I prepared it a mixed the soft butter, mayo and mustard together and spread on top of the steamed cauliflower. Then added the cheese to bake. It was just as good. We will have it again for sure!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was given - I found it to be too mustardy (but that's MY taste - not a slam on the recipe).  I will do this again but with less mustard and maybe a parmeson/cheddar combo like one of the reviewers suggested.  My family liked it and said it was a good change from plain steamed cauliflower like we usually have.

I found this dish to be pretty good.  Definitely a more imaginative way to serve cauliflower.  My toddler gobbled it up (which is hard to do with this veggie).

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  Since the first time I added it to my recipe box in AllRecipes.com I've made it numerous times.  We all love this recipe...and a little extra cheese is always a plus!

This recipe was really nice and the whole family were asking for more! We used 1 tablespoon of mustard and mayonnaise to make a bit more sauce and it was great. We will definately be making it again!

This was very good.  I did use brocolli and cauliflower both.  I also made additional cheese sauce as was recommended by other cooks.  My husband who prefers meat to veggies, had an extra serving of these!  High praise indeed!! Thank you Bea for a recipe that will surely be a favorite in our house.

This recipe is wonderful for low carb.  I did as others suggested and added cheddar cheese.  Came out wonderful!  I have made this recipe many times.

Pretty good for something different and fairly low-calorie.  I used light mayo but had to use 1 TBSP as other reviewers had also stated.  I used frozen cauliflower with no problems!

We tried this last night and loved it. My husband didn't even notice there was mustard in it; which is great since he hates it!! I used 1 tablespoon mayo but kept everything else the same. Thank you for a great low carb recipe.

Delicious. Cut down cooking time and used about 1/3 of the butter. Very easy and very good.

I did what Mrs. Mandi did & we really loved it! Of course, I did use pricey Parmagiano Reggiano which makes anything taste fabulous! Lots of fiber & low carb. Thanks for submitting!

This just wasn't our taste.  I will use this recipe as a base and make my own cheese sauce adding garlic salt and cayenne to it.
