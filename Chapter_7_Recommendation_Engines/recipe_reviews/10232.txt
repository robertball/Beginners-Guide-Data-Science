These ROCK!! The only changes I made to the ingredients were to add 1 TBL. lemon juice to the filling, and 1 TBL. vanilla to the crust/topping. I have NO idea how this is supposed to fit in to a 13 by 9; I sure didn't have enough stuff, so I stuck it in an 8 by 8 pan and they came out SO yummy! I will ABSOLUTELY make these again.

Pretty good. I'd recommend using pineapple juice or some kind of citrus juice instead of 1 cup of water. I also added cinnamon and used margarine instead of shortening.

I read the reviews before i made this dessert. I used fresh pineapple(about 2 Cups). i used my chopper to chop my pineapple, and used all the juice from that (4-6 oz). I also added lemon extract to filling and vanilla extract to crumb. I say crumb, but it came out more like a cookie topping (maybe because i used more oats and also used marg instead of shortening) Oh, i omitted the salt and water all together. They came out amazing! My daughter and grndkids LOVED them!

I tried this, looking for something without nuts.  I found the topping was a little much, and will cut it back to about one third, rather than one half of the crumb mixture.  I also substituted one cup pineapple juice for the water in the filling and added a sprinkle of ground ginger.  Although I was a little disappointed (it would make a great pineapple crisp), the filling was so good that I will give this another try and see if it's just me or the recipe.

This turned out pretty good.  My topping was a little too dry for my taste so I may use butter instead of shortening next time.  I also used pineapple juice instead of the cup of water. I also added freshly ground nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping and filling.

4.5 really... My husband loved them & ate pretty much the entire pan. They have amazing flavor but I had an issue with the consistency. Something I'll just work on the next time I make them... Thanks for sharing the recipe!

True "from scratch" taste. Very good. Takes some effort - and plenty of ingredients - but worth it if you want a taste that doesn't seem like it came from a mix. I would be proud to serve this. The crust was almost cake-like and you could taste the oatmeal, which I enjoyed.

I thought this was very good. After reading other reviews, I used an 8x8 pan, but I think after using it, a 9x13 pan would have been fine. The only change I made was to use a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple as that was all I had on hand.

I added another can of chuck pineapple 8 oz to the mixture after it was cooked and a cup of chopped pecan over the pineapple mixture. It is great warm right from the oven with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it warm or cold.

I've made this twice and everybody loved the first batch but said they couldn't really taste the pineapple so the second time I used 16oz can of crushed pineapple and no water came out great! I do have to agree with previous reviews that this is more like a crisp instead of a bar. Just add one scoop of vanilla ice cream and it is delicious!

These were just OK. Tasted fine. Reminded me more of a crisp than a bar cookie though, with the oatmeal in it.  The pineapple taste seemed to be a bit subtle for the recipe. I used butter instead of shortening and should have reduced the salt to compensate... but it still tasted fine.

This was very rich, I made it like the directions said only when I tried to take it out of the pan while it was hot, it ran. It turned out like a crisp insead of bar cookies,maybe I didn't get the filling thick enough. It was still very good,we kept saying, we need a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of this. lol

I will try this again, my husband loved it.

This was loved by all!  I did use pineapple juice in place of the water, as I had some to use up.  The only other change I made was to sprinkle flaked coconut over the crust layer before poring the pineapple mixture on it.  VERY GOOD!

I've made these twice and they didn't come out like bars, more runny. BUT, they were really good and my husband loved them. So I will keep trying to make them right. Like others, I added vanilla and cinnamon to crumb mixture and lemon juice to the filling.

These turned out great! For the person who did not think there was enough crust/base..do not over mix! it is supposed to be crumbly. I also added 1 tbs lemon to pineapple, and 1 tsp vanilla to crumb mixture. I use wax paper to press into pan so no sticky fingers :)

Followed this to the T.  It is not very good.  The pineapple is barely even noticable.  I will not make again.  It would be good I bet with a "louder" fruit.  We were very disapointed.

My husband & I loved it, but my 4 & 6 year olds who had helped cook it said "Yuck!".  The crust/topping was fun for the kids to make, but stirring the pineapple filling quickly paled.  We added coconut to the top crust.

I used fresh pineapple and cut back on the sugar for the filling. Next time I will add some cinnamon to the crumble as we thought it lacked. I may also use butter versus the shortening to add better flavor to the crumble. But we love pineapple so it was still a hit with us!

This was so good! I took the advice of other reviewers and added vanilla to the batter and oj in place of the water (half and half). I also added a splash of lemon juice. I did 1 and 1/2 times the recipe and it fit fine in a 13x9 pan. Oh, and I used fresh pineapple instead of canned. Everyone loved it. I will definately make again and may try using different fruits as well.

Sounded so good, but didn't come out as well as I had expected.  The crust/topping was not as flavorful as I expected.

No changes. Wait until cool to serve as the filling may be runny otherwise.

I did make a change based on other reviews, I substituted butter for shortening.  I had some shredded coconut, so added that to the pineapple filling making it a pina colada bar.  .  It was really good

Crumbly mess... Almost like a fruit crisp but with a dry floury topping. Also I only used half the sugar required in the pineapple filling and it was still over sweetened. I couldn’t taste the pineapple at all, just sugar. I won’t be making this again.

This is delicious.  The reason I did not rate as 5 is it is overly sweet for my taste.  I think the sugar content may be too much.  However, I used of fresh, sweet pineapple, and added a cherry medley (re-hydrated from dried cherries.)  I added vanilla and almond extract to the filling and a bit of lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer.   I used butter,  not shortening.  I think that is critical :)

The next time I will increase the oatmeal and  add cinnamon, macadamia nuts,  and possibly undessicated coconut and dried cherries for the topping.

Had family stopping over, went to make a favorite pineapple recipe, but didn't have one main ingredient.  So I looked for pineapple ideas...found this, and everyone (even picky husband) loved it!  Will make again, may try some of the reviewers ideas.   A keeper!

was expecting and wanting a granola  bar consistency that you can cut in squares and pick up. But this is way too crumbly. Taste is ok but a bit too dry and powdery. I ended up scraping the topping off and mixing it with corn syrup and spreading it back on. That made it stick together better!

I made this yesterday and loved the filling but was not really happy with the crust.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but the crust didn't solidify very much and the taste was rather bland even though I added cinnamon and nutmeg as others suggested.  I think it might taste better with some kind of brown sugar topping instead.  My husband did like it very much.

Amazing recipe and followed someone elses tip to add cinnamon to the crumble and vanilla to the filling, turned out great.

Being diabetic though, would like to know the nutrition breakdown of the bars if anyone has it,thanks.
