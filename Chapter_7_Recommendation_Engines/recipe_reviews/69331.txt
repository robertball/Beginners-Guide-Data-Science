Fruit soup- the name alone puts people off, but it is SO good (I have converted everyone who enters my home around the holidays to eating fruit soup and loving it!), and makes the house smell wonderful! It's ok this way, but my grandmother off-the-boat-Swedish made this every winter with a few more ingredients. We use only cinnamon sticks (2-3 in a large crock pot or dutch oven). Use currants instead of raisins and reduce to 1 c. I use 1 whole package of dried apricots (best you can get), 2 granny smith apples (or other firm, tart apple) pared, cored and sliced thick, one small orange or tangerine seeded, sliced (peel-on) instead of the lemon juice. I cook this to a slow boil on the stove and transfer to a large crockpot on low and cook it until I feel like turning it off! We serve with a dollop of whipped cream on top in a large mug or bowl. It's also EXCELLENT as a "glug"- throw in some vodka, some port, some rum- whatever you fancy. It is great hot (especially with company over- the entire HOUSE smells wonderful!) but it's also great cold (the tapioca makes it gel up- it's thick when cool) on it's own, or served over oatmeal for breakfast. I like to serve it with shortbread cookies on the side. With the pitted prunes it's not the prettiest soup to serve- it's rather brownish and chunky, but if you can get past the look to the taste, you'll be hooked. Plus, it's good for you!!

My mom use to make something very similar.  I would use less sugar next time.  Plus I like it warm with a little cream drizzled on it.
