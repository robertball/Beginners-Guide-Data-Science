Oh my goodness! These were fantastic! Chewy, moist, peanut buttery, chocolaty! I added a tsp. of vanilla, used crunchy peanut butter, and 1 tbsp. of butter to the topping to make it easier to cut after refrigerating...but there was no need to...these went too fast to chill in the fridge! If you like PB, chocolate and oatmeal, you will love this one, and if you don't, I'll eat it for you! Thanks Sara!

These are sinful!!! So delicious, so addictive!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated and they were a bit too sweet for me, so I changed it the second time around....less sugar (1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 cup white), less butter (3/4 c) and less choco chips (1 cup) with less pb (1/3 c).  They were out of this world good!! I did bake them for 30 mins instead of 20.  SENSATIONAL!!!  Thanks!

I left my 8yr old daughter make this.  It was very good.  We added 1 tsp. vanilla as someone suggested and baked for 30 minutes as someone else suggested.  We ended up cutting the bars much smaller.  They are very thick so next time we will try making these in a bigger pan.  We also cut down on the chocolate.  In a bigger pan thinner bar cookies will result and following the chocolate recipe as listed will give plenty of chocolate covering.

Will definately make these again.

These were fantastic!  I'm not sure what they reminded me of...kind of a cross between a Reese's Cup and a Butterfinger candy bar.  The edges got crispy but the middle stayed soft.  I eneded up baking for 30 minutes until the center was set.  I let these cool overnight before cutting.  Tip:  don't try to cut them right out of the refrigerator.  The topping will be rock hard!

These were good, but I feel that the butter content was too high and the PB content too low.  In the future I would probably reduce butter to 1/2 cup and increase the PB to 1 1/4 cup.  The flavor of the bars as written were good, but more buttery than peanut buttery. Also, I found 15-20 minutes of baking to be way too short.  My bars were not cooked until after 35 min.  Not sure why.

This recipe was very good! But I found it to be too much to fit into a 9x13 pan.  I would cut this recipe in half, because the bars were too thick.  Also, make sure you cool the pan in the fridge (I would say overnight) to make sure that they cut nicely, otherwise, it ends up a big mess.  I had to make this twice, to fix my mistakes of the first time! But otherwise very tasty, taking them to a baby shower today, and I'm sure they will be a big hit!

I made these and they were awesome!! I loved that it has healthy ingredients inside (I used whole wheat pastry flour)! The amount of chocolate on top was a bit surprising.... I may make a little less next time but that's the only thing I'd do different! Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make it again!

I made these to bring to work..  Everyone loved them!! Like the others I thought the 13x9 pan wasnt large enough. I had to bake it longer as well. Though agreed its best to half the recipe for the bottom layer.. I cut them into bite size pieces because they were so rich..

Good. But tasted more like an oatmeal cookie with chocolate on top than a peanut butter cup.

I'm a bit mixed on these.  Not what I was expecting.  Much drier than I anticipated - I cooked them for 20 mins.  The sides puffed up and the middle sort of fell.  Would cook for only 15 min next time.  I'd also use smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy and maybe reduce the oats?  The peanut flavour was very subtle and they aren't as sweet as I expected though I think I like them better for that.  I'll keep eating them and see how I feel when they are gone.

This is a tasty recipe! I liked the heartiness of the bar. The oatmeal and the peanut butter made a great combination. I also found them to be too thick. I had to cook them about 40 min. Next time I will bake it in a jelly roll so that it will not be too thick. Delicious!

You know, this wasn't great.  It was very dry.  I think you need to add another egg or not put in as much oatmeal. It's too much oatmeal.  I could hardly taste the peanut butter.  I'm bummed because it sounded awesome, just didn't taste that way.

timing seems to be off on this recipe. I checked at 18 minutes and it was no where near done. had to bake another 15 minutes to get center done. It sinks when cooled and I couldn't think of any reason to wait util cooled to pour melted chocolate/pb mix over, so I didn't wait. Family says its a 4-1/2 but I thought crust was too sweet, but loved the topping of mixing PB & (I used bittersweet)chocolate. Probably will make again. But, will just plan on baking longer and try using less sugars.

I took these to work today & everyone loved them! I had to cook the bottom layer much longer than recipe states. I also only had milk choco chips & a little bit less peanut butter. It still worked out wonderfully! Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly, didn't change a thing.  My husband liked it so much he tried to tell me I wouldn't like it so he could keep the whole dish to himself.  By the time I got to it, half the pan was gone.  Excellent recipe!

Yummy! The best way I can describe this is it's like a chewy peanut butter cookie with a yummy sweet chocolate/peanut butter topping. It was delicious as written, but if you really love peanut butter, you might want to add a little more to the topping part.

These are very sweet but so tasty. The middle sinks in, so I found the chocolate layer a little thick in the middle. Other reviewers have said that they had to bake a lot longer, but I used a 9x13 pan and they were done in 20 minutes. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty squares, but definitely should be in a larger pan. I had to increase the baking time to about 30 minutes with the 9x13 pan. Will make again, but either half the recipe or use a larger pan. Thanks!

I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 9" x 13" pan.  The squares turned out perfectly!  They were just the right thickness.  While I did freeze them to get them to set quickly (I was in a rush), they were best eaten at room temperature.  A number of people commented that they were so tasty because they weren't too sweet.  I suspect it's because this recipe calls for oats (rather than graham crackers) and I used unsweetened peanut butter (100% peanuts).

I loved this recipe!!  I made it for my hubby and did everything according to the recipe for the cookie part.  The chocolate topping, I subbed some peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips as I had them to get rid of.  I did have to bake for about 35 minutes.  I think this would be great cut into 1x1 pieces like fudge for Christmas cookies as well.

Pretty darn yummy!! I agree that they are a little thick, so next time I will make these in a 11x17 pan. I too had to cook them about 15 minutes longer than suggested. I suggest using more peanut butter with the chocolate because I couldn't really taste it. Also I didn't have enough chocolate chips, so I broke up some Hershey's milk chocolate bars and it worked! I will certainly make these again!

Love peanut butter and chocolate! I did halve the crust ingredients because of a  previous reviewer's comment about the thickness of the crust.  Also used just a whole package of semisweet chips with the peanut butter for the topping; plenty of chocolate.   Yummy, yummy - my co-workers will love them tommorrow when I take them in to work! Thanks, Sal.

It pains me to say it, but this wasn't the slice of Heaven I had hoped for. I should've heeded other reviewers' suggestions to cut the cookie base ingredients in half--as written, the base winds up about 3 inches thick! Be prepared to add AT LEAST 10 minutes extra to cooking time. There are some other peanutty recipes I'm looking forward to trying from this site- I won't be making this again.

All I have to say is yummm! I substituted wheat flour for white  (1 1/2 instead of 2) to make them healthier.. and increased the bake time( about 40 min)... excellent!!

Everybody loved it and has been asking for it again this holiday.  If you're new to candy making this is the perfect place to start.  I followed the recipe last year.

what could be easier than melting chocolate chips on top of this delicious peanut butter brownie.  I also added mini chips in the batter.

This turned out much better than expected. I wanted it to be in a round dish for a pie look and didn't realize it would rise. It took up the entire 9" dish to the top after 20 minutes; I took it out, scooped out the center down about 1 inch, leaving 1/2 inch edges for a crust. Then baked it for another 10 min since it was still doughy because it is thicker. I wish I would have taken a picture; it was pretty after adding the chocolate layer. Everyone loved it; the taste and texture of the peanut butter cookie crust was perfect. I used Dove dark chocolate and natural peanut butter with 2 tsps of butter to make cutting easier.

These bars were ok.  They didn't have the peanut butter "punch" I was looking for.  In my opinion, they weren't worth the calories, and I love peanut butter and chocolate together.

The recipe was okay. They were good but certainly not the best dessert I have made. They seemed kind of dense almost too hearty for a dessert.

Delicious! The only recommendation I have is make sure it sets for a while before serving. I made mine fresh after work when having company over and it didn't taste as good fresh out of the oven. After it sat overnight though, it was delish! I ended up eating almost a 1/4 of it by myself!! I'm a big fan of PB and chocolate, so it was great!

Being a lover of PB & Chocolate, maybe I just had higher expectations.  I followed KMCL1994's modifications (and used RF PB).  I let them 'set' in the fridge, and when I cut them, they were really on the dry side... Bringin' them back to room temp, they were a lot better, but still not what I thought they were gonna be. I'll keep looking.

Mixed opinions on this one. Some of the family said it was good others said no. I guess it just depends on your taste. I made it just as it is, but probably won't make it again. Thanks for the post anyway.

took longer to cook than suggested but I can't wait to eat it! I have it setting in the freezer and my husband has already stolen a square even though its all melty gooey chocolate on top and says how good it is. He has the biggest smile and when I tasted his I was surprised at how good it tastes! so moist, chewy and chocolatey all in one!! I'm definitely passing this along AND baking it again. (now i see my 2 1/2 yr old into Daddy's desert going for more and more) 2mins after posting this i couldnt wait anymore. i had to have it while warm.. oh my goodness I'm in heaven.. its soooo goood!!!

Totally yummy!  Easy to make, although like others I had to leave in the oven for about 25 min, I would make this again.

This recipe has been a hit with all of my friends... my family doesn't like peanut butter.. 

I added another egg to the recipe, because it came out dry the first time I made it, and that made the difference apparently.

These were ok.  I didn't think they really tasted like any kind of candy bar, but they were ok. They were much thicker than expected from looking at the photos. I'd say they need to be in a much larger pan, like people have suggested, or else cut the recipe in half and keep the same size pan. I thought the texture was much like a cake-like brownie.  Guess I could try again. Just not what I was expecting.

These are so good.  Easy to make too.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and natural peanut butter.  Reduced the sugar a little too.  Everyone loved these.
