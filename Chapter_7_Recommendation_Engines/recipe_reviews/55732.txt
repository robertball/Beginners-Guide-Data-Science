This was really tasty. I made a couple of changes. I used non fat refried regular beans, rather than black and I used a low carb garlic tortialla instead of flour. I think a bit of spice on the shrimp itself might be good next time. This was a very easy and tasty dinner.

Nothing difficult here.  But they sure do look impressive.  I felt like I was dining on a tropical island!

I really like this.  I bought precooked shelled shrimp to make it easier and never can find black beans, but regular refried beans work.  I think it would be better with the black beans.

This was really delicious!  I will definitely add it to our rotation.  I marinated the shrimp in the lime juice before cooking them to get a good flavor out of them since I used frozen shrimp.  But we were big fans, thank you!!!
