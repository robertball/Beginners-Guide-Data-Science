Superb Coconut Rice!  I made the recipe as shown with only two additions.  I added 2 to 3 Tablespoons of  shredded coconut, in order to increase the coconut flavor as well as add a bit of sweetness. I also added about 1/4 cup of frozen baby peas. Then I cooked as instructed.  I did not add the coconut as garnish since it had already been stirred into the rice itself.  This turned out better than any coconut rice I have had in the past.  Yum!

I had coconut rice in Jamaica more than a decade ago. I have been longing for the taste of it again. This recipe was perfect. I did sub the turmeric for Jamaican curry powder. I also added a lemongrass stalk. Amazing!

I couldn't taste a bit of coconut in this rice. That said, I still think it's delicious! Like an easy version of saffron rice. My tumeric turned the rice bright yellow. The coconut milk made it super creamy and delicious. I was really worried about not stirring or checking the rice, per Chef John's advice, because my stove tends to run really hot, but I followed the directions and it came out perfect.

Love this side dish. I wanted it to be more savory than sweet so increased the turmeric and pepper flakes a bit. Also added a handful of chopped green onions before cooking. I will definitely make again.

A little bland for my taste. Added pinch turmeric, then curry powder, then cumin - nothing seemed to help. Did cook in indicated time, though; no burning. I cut the salt by about 1/8 or 1/4 teaspoon - I find many recipes benefit from less salt. Could that have been the problem?
What about using more coconut milk, rather than the 1 C of water? Would mixture be too thick, and more prone to burning? Would a tiny bit of sugar, maybe 1/2 tsp, help.
I think this has possibilities but I'm going to tweak it. I was hoping to serve it with very spicy shrimp or chicken.

I just made it forgot the salt? It tasted bland. I guess I'll try it with the salt? Although I can't imagine not putting salt would make this taste bland. A little disappointed. It looks very pretty with the spices added as well.

I had basmati rice to use up, so I used 1.5 cups of it, in the proportions given on the package. To the coconut milk and water blend I added finely chopped onions and granulated garlic, around 1/3 cup of Bob’s Red Mill unsweetened dried coconut chips, and approximately 1/2 tsp cumin. I omitted all salt, I’m on a very restricted-sodium diet, and we’re used to it. 

It was great that day with chicken, and another day with pork chops. The coconut flakes were an interesting taste and texture, my husband loved this rice dish.

Incredible. I added about 1/4 basamati to the total ratio of jasmine. I also added a tiny bit more liquid and chicken stock in place of water. Turned out perfect. I served it with shrimp. I will be making this again.

I am not a rice fan and almost never cook rice at home. This recipe might change that. This rice is awesome, and my entire family loved it.  I had to make substitutions because I didn’t have fresh ginger or chili flakes in the cupboard.  I used ground ginger and chili powder instead.  It was still delicious, and I’m going to make it again with the proper ingredients to see if we love it just as much.

Wonderful as is but I would add a little less coconut milk to keep it more fluffy.

This is not my first Chef John recipe and I’m coming to trust his culinary judgement. Everything I’ve made of his has been excellent! This was no exception. I had to substitute thyme for bay leaves just out of necessity. And I used a rice cooker because it’s easy. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was AWESOME.

I was looking for a unique rice recipe to serve as a,side dish.  This was just what I was looking for.  It had an excellent flavor and went well with a grilled steak and some seasoned roasted broccoli. I followed the recipe exactly and the rice was a perfect texture.  I made a little extra toasted coconut which accents this dish nicely

This was pretty yummy. I love jasmine rice and I love coconut so this was a no brained for me. I would like it a little more saucy, but the flavor is good and I even toasted some shredded coconut for the topping. Definitely a keeper!

I'm giving this a three because the cooking time didn't work for me. He specifically said not to open the pot and to let it cook for 18minutes then cool for 5. I did that only to find water  at the bottom of the pot which I didn't discover until I started to fork it. The rice was not cooked and consequently crunchy.The flavor is good. I added more time but due to the before mention-- it became mushy and crunchy. I ws very disappointed because I was looking forward to pairing this with a new fish and chicken recipe. I may try it again but would increase the  cooking time and I would ensure it was fully cooked by peaking.

My family loves Thai and Indian food, so I thought this recipe, which has elements of both, would be good. I was so wrong. The coconut was overbearing and extremely greasy, and the rice was just mush. I'm an experienced cook and executed the recipe precisely. It was just disgusting. I was glad I thought to have everyone try it before I served it because everyone hated it and I had to get some Jasmine rice in the rice cooker, stat. My family loves coconuts, coconut milk, and dishes made with coconut, but now we all have PTSD from this horrible rice. All throughout our meal, we were still tasting the awful flavor. This is the third or fourth recipe by "Chef John" that has just been horrific. I've learned my lesson. Allrecipes - PLEASE find another chef to feature; this guy does not know how to cook!

Absolutely delicious.  Instructions were perfect.  I used 1 cup of Jasmine rice and 1/2 cup basmati rice.  It was fabulous as is but when it was done I added in 1/4 cup each of chopped green onions, toasted slivered almonds and toasted shredded coconut.  Added some depth of flavour and some added texture and colour.  I can't wait to make again.

Very Good.  I have made this 3 times now and will make again . 
 Paired it with Crab-stuffed sole from this site. Used cayenne in place if chili flakes and a little extra water.  Thanks Chef John, another winner.

Our family did not care for this at all.  Very bland and had an almost chalky taste.  This is the first time I have cooked with coconut milk, and that could be it.

Did this with brown rice (used 1c rice, and more like 1.5c water), and still was delicious! Unique for me, and hubby liked it too. Will definitely make again.
