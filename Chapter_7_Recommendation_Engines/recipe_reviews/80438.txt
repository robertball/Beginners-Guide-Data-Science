I've made this dip several times and EVERYWHERE I take it, I get begged for the recipe!  I take it pot-lucks and parties, and it is ALWAYS the only dish that never has any leftovers!  I've made it with ham, and also with sliced deli turkey and have had rave reviews both ways.   The only change I've made is to add about 1 cup of sour cream and different kinds, and bigger amounts, of shredded cheeses, about 4 cups.  Monterey Jack/Colby mix works really well with the turkey.  I'm making it again this weekend, and I'm going to try shaved roast beef this time with Mozzarella cheese.  Two BIG thumbs up to Anne for making me look like a genius!!

I made this recipe with an Aussie twist.  Instead of serving it on rye bread, I gutted the inside of a damper,(Like Cobb bread)and baked this in the oven on a low temp,with the filling, until the damper & filling were crusty and hot.  Absolutely delicious!

I made this for a church potluck and it was the star of the show! I combined all the ingredients in a saucepan first so they were warm and then put it in my little crockpot. It kept it warm all day. I served it with french bread. It is definitely a keeper. I might try it over potatoes or chicken breasts next time!

I made this for a couple of friends and didn't seem to go over well.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it, I think it was the soups that over powered the dip.  I had leftovers so I used the dip as a topping for boneless, skinless chicken breast.  My family really liked this combo instead.  I liked the concept, just not a dip.

This was a hit at my work pot luck.  It was gone almost immediately and everyone asked for the recipe.  I did a few extras from the recipe.  Instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of chicken with herbs.  I also added a little garlic powder and 5 slices of muenster cheese.  Served with rye and butter crackers.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  The only thing I did different was use a little garlic powder and some dry mustard.  Will make again!

I made this for the super bowl party and everybody loved it!  I did use the low sodium soups, and next time I'll try to find some low sodium ham, but it was very good, and so easy to prepare!  My husband could even fix it!

This was very good, very tasty and good for something different than normal.  I took this to a party and almost all of it is gone.  It is SALTY though because of all the ham, but next time I will try to buy low sodium soup and see if I can't find something to cut the salt taste.  But, all in all, definitely a winner!  We will make this again, even if it's just for our family.

We doubled the batch and used 2 1/2 lbs. sliced swiss cheese.  It was probably a bit rich from the excess cheese, but this one is in our recipe box.  In a slow cooker on high it was done in an hour even with the extra cheese and a double batch.  Very Good!

This stuff is ridiculously good.  It is easy, fun, and a good conversation piece...if someone brings a dip based on my favorite sandwich, I'm gonna try it!  It is pretty rich, but its a dip, its not supposed to be low cal.  I guess you could easily substitute fat-free or reduced-fat products though, if you wanted.

I used Virginia Ham which had perfect smokiness to compliment the swiss.  The taste was good, but it was almost too creamy and soupy for my liking.

Came out really soupy.  The flavors were right, but was more like a cheddar ham soup than a dip.

I've made this recipe about 4 times and get RAVE reviews every time I make it- it's great  for parties, and is so simple to put together.  I use sourdough bread instead of rye, and it works out much better for my taste.  The consistency gets a little different if you overcook it, but it still tastes great!

This was pretty good.  It was very rich and creamy.  It definitely reminded me of a ham and swiss sandwich, so if you like them you will like this dip.  It was not my families favorite, but good for a change of pace.  Thanks!

This was ok if you really like swiss cheese.  I thought I did until I had this dip.  Next time I think I will try cheddar cheese.

This dip was really good.  Everyone commented on it.  The only changes I made which were really slight, was to use a can of roasted garlic mushroom soup and used french bread for dipping instead of cocktail rye bread.  Will make again.  One note - I did not think this dish was too salty and I am not a salt user.

Made as written (I used full fat, name brand versions of the soups) but found it to be lacking some depth.  I added several dashes of italian season and it helped quite a bit.  However, I probably wouldn't make this dish again -- somewhat expensive for the lack of wow factor.

Hmmmm...I made this yesterday for a pool party. I came home with the entire batch. It was extremely soupy, not dip like at all. It reminded me of chipped beef gravy. I am not sure what I did wrong but I was very dissappointed. I was so looking forward to a new appetizer to put in my recipe box. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the flavor is really good, however not as a dip. As the other reviews said; this would be good over chicken.

It was a fairly decent recipe....although, I agree with others, not really a dip.  It was really good over mashed potatoes and ok with rye triscuts.

It was tasty!  Definitely make sure one uses low sodium soup.  Everything regular combined with the saltiness of the ham is just a bit much.
