I havne't tries this actual recipe yet, but I thought I'd inject a warning!  It says this isn't hot without adding more peppers, but my experience with poblanos is that sometimes they are very mild, and sometimes I've had them and I can't eat them because they are so hot!  So, be careful!  Also, removing the seeds and membranes reduces the heat.  But, as I said, these peppers are unpredictable!

Easy to put together and the sauce was absolutely excellent.  Overall, it was good, but I think the potatoes gave it a bit more of an Italian-type stuffed peppers taste, though I did use poblanos.

The flavor of this dish was amazing - my husband just loved it.  But, as the other reviewer said - some poblanos are very hot, as mine were.  Also, it wasn't clear in the directions, the peppers can be microwaved uncovered.

I was skeptical of what the sauce would taste like, but based on another positive review, I decided to try it anyway.  It wasn't terrible, but it was definitely not something I'll ever repeat--very lacking in flavor (just imagine what pureed tomatoes and peanut butter would taste like....blah, the additional seasonings help but can't rescue it entirely).We ended up using some salsa instead.  I'll have to figure out something else I can mix the sauce into--like enchiladas or something.

This was ok but it needs...something. I was afraid of making this because the sauce just sounded weird with the peanut butter, but it wasn't bad, just bland. My husband had it with salsa and thought that was good. I would try again and spice up the sauce a little more. Maybe add some mushrooms or other veggies to the potato stuffing. It's an ok, healthy recipe that could be great with some tweaking.

UPDATE - eating the leftovers today and they are SOOO spicy -- borderline uncomfortably spicy.  I have never found poblanos to be hot so I'm quite surprised.  just a warning that you may want to consider removing the seeds if you aren't a fan of heat.
