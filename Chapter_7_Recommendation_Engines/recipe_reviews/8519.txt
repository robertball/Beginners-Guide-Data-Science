The sauce is amazing!  I added sliced potatoes and carrots to the dish and covered all with the sauce and baked for the hour suggested and the meal was complete and delish!

SALTY SALTY SALTY..forgot to heed the advice of other reviewers. The onion mix, high sodium of canned mushroom soup, and salt seasoning is too much.  Next time, I'll skip the salt, halve the onion mix, and use low sodium mushroom soup if it exists.  My neighbor made a similar dish for me once, and I was trying to find it on my own.  Her chicken was extremely tender and not salty...looks like I just need to get the recipe from her directly.  Sorry...has potential, just too darn salty.

This a very good, quick recipe. I've made this many times before, but I have never used sour cream or dry onion soup mix. What I did was to forget the browning, just added the chicken directly to pan,put in the oven,cook till slightly browned,drain the fat,add sour cream mixture,do not add salt,the soup mix has enough.return to oven,  I added garlic powder and touch more black pepper. Then I added milk to thin the sauce and served over fluffy white basamati rice, just add a side of green beans,or broccoli a tossed salad, and you have dinner in no time at all.

I made this recipe, but tried to cut the fat and calories. I used cooking spray instead of the oil, I used fat free sour cream, fat free condensed mushroom soup and boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I served this dish over rice... oh my goodness. How delicious! This is a fantastic recipe. The dill & lemon juice just give the recipe a great tangy kick. This recipe was a huge success & is a new family favourite. Thanks!

The sauce is quite rich, but very yummy. And it was easy! I also used boneless skinless chicken breast- I cooked them 3 min per side in the pan and then baked for 45 min & it was perfect.  I will make this occasionally for dinner parties.

Love it! I did add some milk to thin out the sauce and used chicken breasts instead. I would not add any salt as the soup mix is salty enough. Served over homemade mashed potatoes and w/your favorite green veggie and you've got dinner!

This is rich and satisfying, albeit slightly salty. Using a little less onion soup mix and subsituting onion power may make it better. This would go great with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.

My husband and I don't add much (if any) salt to our food, so the salty quotient of this dish nearly shot our heads off. If I make this again, I would cut the soup mix in half and in agreement with a previous poster, add milk to what seemed like a rather thick sauce/gravy.

This tastes awesome, but omit the salt!! The onion soup mix has plenty of salt in it already.  Serve over unsalted egg noodles.

This recipe makes a fabulous sour cream chicken. The chicken is extremely flavorful and tender, and it easy too! I wouldn't change a thing.

Looking for something to make with boneless,skinless chicken thighs, I decided to try this recipe. I placed a few sliced potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the 9x13 greased baking dish as suggested by "SYDLY", and sprinkled with pepper and garlic powder. I browned the boneless-skinless thighs on both sides in a hot nonstick pan (no need for any oil), until they were nice and golden and placed these on top of the vegetables in the pan. I put the sauce ingredients in the same nonstick pan (to stir up any juices and brown bits left from the chicken) over medium heat along with at least 1/2 cup. of 1% milk and stirred well to combine. I left out the salt and lemon juice since I didn't have any, and only used 1/2 of the dry onion soup as others have suggested. Poured the sauce covering everything in the baking dish and baked as directed. This turned out delicious. I was surprised since I do not like sour cream. It had wonderful flavor which was not overpowered by any one ingredient. The wonderful taste makes up for what this dish might lack in eye appeal. Next time I would like to try using fat free sour cream. Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the suggestions of others.

I very much enjoy this dish!  I, like alot of others do not add any salt, Onion soup mix has plenty.  I brown my thighs in butter, then deglaze the pan with a little white wine and add that to the mushroom/sour cream mix.  Place in some carrots and potato's to the  dish pour mix over all of it....complete meal!

5 stars with modifications! We didn't have dill, so we added 1 Tbsp fresh minced parsley. We also didn't have onion soup mix so we used 1 Tbsp chopped onion with ~1/2 cup chicken broth. It was amazing. With 5 thighs (instead of 8) we ran out of sauce - so adjust accordingly! One more thing...add a whole yellow onion, cut in wedges, around the chicken while it bakes. Just great. We licked the plate.

I needed a make-ahead dish, and this was perfect! I didn't even brown the boneless-skinless thighs. They went right into a glass baking dish, with carrots and sliced red potatoes. For the sauce, I didn't have lemon juice, but about 1/3 C. of good-quality dry sherry, mixed with the sour cream mixture, made this dish over-the-top delish. I used a whole pkg. of the onion soup mix, but didn't add any salt, as others suggested. The chicken was so tender, and everyone raved. As a side note, though, the vegetables were not done, even after baking well over an hour, covered with foil. Next time I'll cook those on the side, bake the chicken for one hour, and serve over rice.

Although this wasn't the prettiest dish I've ever made, it was super easy & quite tasty.  Added sliced potatoes in with the chicken for a complete meal. Will definitely be making this again.

This was great.  Even my picky 7yo liked the chicken!  The sauce was creamy and tangy without being overwhelming.  The dill gave it a special taste.  I made it exactly as written, except I didn't add any extra salt to the chicken (the onion soup mix and condensed soup have enough).  I used the whole packet of onion soup mix and didn't think the dish was too salty.  And I added thinly sliced red potatoes to the dish for the entire baking time.  I used cream of celery soup, but I think any soup would work.

Awesome!!! I was looking for something different for chicken thighs. I changed 2 things, I browned my chicken in a little butter and didn't add the salt. Very Good!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I'm sorry, but I made this exactly as written without the salt.  My family wouldn't eat it.  Husband tried but couldn't do it.  He thought it was the dill that ruined this recipe, my daughter thought it was the onion soup mix.  Took out hubby's mean comment even tho he did say it...

Loved it. I didn't have sour cream, so I used heavy cream. I am not sure what I missed because of the substitution, but it was delish!

A great easy base for endless variations! That is why, as stingy as I am, I bumped it up to 4 stars. My only changes (because of what I had on hand): used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, added a can of cut asparagus, and after frying cut chicken breast, I deglazed the pan with approx. 1/8th cup asparagus liqiud and added to sauce. Of course fresh asparagus would probably be better and add more texture, the canned is what I had, cheaper, and stayed with the spirit of easy, like the rest of this dish. Will definitely make again, and continue to tweak it.

Fantastic!!!  I omitted the salt, halved the onion soup mix and subbed some dried onions and everything was awesome!  Great over rice or mashed potatoes.  Thanks for a great addition to our menu!

made it with a few changes - because there were ingredients i didnt have - they were minor - cream of chicken and beefy onion soup and i didn't fry before baking.  otherwise great recipe....it's a keeper and my picky boyfriend even said so!!!!  i made with white rice and used the extra sauce with that...great recipe
And after making this many times I halve the soup mix and do not salt otherwise.  Still love it after all these years.  My picky boyfriend is now my picky husband.

Incredibly tender.  Served over extra fine egg noodles.  Followed to a tee except used 10 thighs (they all fit in the pan). Great.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow, this was really easy (ingredients you likely already have on hand) and very tasty! I substituted 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cut in half. Didn't even bother browning. Just put the chicken in a lightly oil sprayed dish, sprinkled pepper and paprika on them, and pour the soup/cream/juice mixture on top. I omitted the dill weed and added a little more light sour cream to the mixture since I had read the reviews about it being a little salty. Cooked for about 1hr 15 minutes. Easy and delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was alright, I didn't think the chicken was very tender.  I can't see myself making it again.

When you cook the sour cream it totally curdles.  The tast is good, but the texture of the sour cream is unappealing.

LOVED THIS. It was a quick and easy meal. I've seen other recipies similar to this but I really like how this one adds a bit of dill. The recipes makes a LOT of sauce so I removed a bit of it and mixed it in a seperate caserole with sliced potatoes toped with a little olive oil. It was an equally delicious side dish.

My husband and I loved this meal!  I made it last night.  I used 4 thighs, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  I didn't brown the thighs.  I used cream of chicken (that's what I had available).  I omitted the soup mix (too much sodium) and used 3 tbsp of dried onion instead.  I added a pack of frozen broccoli florets and a splash of milk.  I also added about a teaspoon of paprika instead of a pinch.  Dont' leave out the lemon and dill, it makes the dish!  Served it with mashed potatoes....next time I will add a little bit more milk to make the sauce more of a gravy...it was a bit thick.  Thanks Lucille for posting this recipe! Happy Holidays to everyone!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few adjustments as we like lots of gravy.  I subbed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup in place of the 1 can of cream of mushroom (husband is allergic to mushrooms) and added a little milk to thin the gravy out some.  The dill and lemon juice added just enough bite to make it a very pleasant treat.

This is good, but I did do a little to it. I doubled the sauce so there was plenty for egg noodles and I used chicken breast. I omitted the lemon  and dill after the first time because I didn't like what the lemon and stuff did to it. It's great with 1 cup of milk, 2 cups of sour cream, 2 liptons, 2 soups, 2 cans of mushrooms, and pepper. I use the low fat versions of the soups and reduced fat sour cream.  Very tasty and easy.

This was really S U P E R good!  It lived up to all of the remarks in the recipe. 

I would like to thank Brad Moore for sharing the link with us!

We also cooked a few noodles and placed some of the sauce over them along with the chicken.

This recipe will be added to our Favorite Recipe book.

Thank you very much!

The 'convenience' of packaged soups ruined this dish. Even when I doubled the amount of chicken it called for, it was too, too salty. Making my own quick mushroom sauce and half a packet of the onion soup makes the dish at least edible. I've never said this here before, but I won't use this recipe again.

This was pretty good. I had 8 bone-in/skin on chicken thighs that I got for only $3.50 and was wondering what to do with them... here we are. I took the skin off the chicken but kept the bone in. I didn't add any salt because of other reviews that said it was salty. I agree, skipping the added salt was a good idea. I used low fat soup and fat free sour cream and added about 1/2 a cup of 1% milk to the sauce because it was very thick. Decided to just serve it over some veggies. Low carb meal that everyone enjoyed! :)

Fantastic! I used skinless/boneless chicken breast and skipped the lemon juice and dill weed because I didn't have any.  I took another reviewer's advice and used onion powder instead of the soup mix.  I added a little garlic powder as well and it turned out great! The chicken was extremely tender and juicy and the sauce was incredibly flavorful.  Boyfriend requested this be made again so it gets five stars!

No wonder nearly 5,000 cooks have saved this recipe! The sauce is great. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and had no soup mix. So I browned about 1/4 cup of chopped onions with the chicken and added more than a pinch of the   seasonings. I sprinkled the top with more paprika just  for 'pretty'.My picky husband  loved it! This was the first time to use sour cream over chicken this way. I will again. Thanks.

Very easy to make but needed a little tweaking due to the thickens. I added 1/2 cup of milk to gravy since it was too thick. Lemon and thyme make this recipe so be sure to use it! I didn't use salt as the onion soup mix gave the recipe just enough. I used chicken breasts instead since thats what I had in the fridge, so I baked at 425 for 30 min instead of 350 for an hr (we were hungry and didn't want to wait) good flavor will make more gravy next time since we like it over rice. Thanks for sharing!

First of all, the sauce was too thick.  I added some half and half to thin it out.  When I took it out of the oven, it did not even look good.  Yucky color of brown.  The taste was good though.  I would not make it again.

Wow - I signed up just to give a review of this recipe!  It was so tender and flavorful we are a family of 6 and everyone loved it.  Great bang for your buck with this meal.  I did double the mushroom soup to 2 cans as we had about 10 thighs and I am so glad I did lots of sauce..not too salty at all for us (prehaps because of the extra soup added)...simply delicious....recommended.

I love this recipe!  I skip the browning of the meat part to make it quicker.  To make it healthier I use 98% fat free mushroom soup and light sour cream (to reduce fat) and only half the packet of onion soup mix (to reduce sodium).  Doesn't diminish the flavor at all!  The dill adds such a great flavor and goes so well with the sour cream.  You can also add a little white wine to the sauce.  This is great served over white rice.  In my photo I served it with "Italian Veggie Bake" from the Kraft website.

Wow! What a pleasant surprise! I normally don't like dill weed, but this was quite good. My husband liked it a lot too. I'm not a fan of chicken thighs, so I will be making this again but with chicken breasts. It was so quick and easy and I wouldn't change a thing! Loved it!

I thought this was super!  I used boneless chicken thighs and skipped the browning step.  I sprinkled old bay seasoning over the chicken and that really added to the flavor.  I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1/2 the onion mix and still thought it was a little strong.  Maybe next time I will try Knorrs veggie mix instead.  Still a great easy dinner.

A great way to use up stuff in your kitchen.  I used a package of drumsticks (6 of them). The sauce is great on mashed potatoes.  Even better the next day.

Used chicken breasts instead of thighs, omitted the salt & replaced 1 c. sour cream with 1 c. plain yogurt.  Browned the chicken in an oven-safe skillet and added sauce to pan before baking in the over. Served the chicken with sauce over whole wheat spaghetti.  Delish!

No need for onion soup mix. Low sodium cream of mushroom was plenty salty! Per previous reviews, added garlic powder. Also, poured oil from pan, then deglazed pan with white wine and a dab of butter, added that to the sour cream mix. Excellent! Next time, I will try just baking, no browning, for quicker prep time (as another reviewer did).

I was looking for an easy alternative to the usual breaded chicken, and this definitely lived up to my expectations.  Its not a fixture on my menu.

My husband thought the chicken tasted good, my kids did not like it at all. There was a layer of greasy fat on top of the dish that made it not very attractive, and made the dish just greasy in general. Using chicken breast would be a better option.

Excellent!  I basically followed the directions but used cream of chicken and roasted garlic soup and added broccoli florets before baking.  Next time I will use fat free cream of chicken soup and sour cream.  I think it will also be just as good and a bit healthier with boneless/skinless chicken breasts.

Great recipe and easy to put together.  I used fat free sour cream and soup to cut the fat and 2 T dehydrated onions in place of the soup mix to lower the sodium.  Definitely a keeper.

This was very yummy.  I used only half of the onion soup mix, no extra salt, and added more sour cream, dill, lemon juice, some paprika and garlic powder, and added fresh mushrooms.

Though this dish was flavorful and pretty, it was much too salty--and that was WITHOUT salting the chicken pieces as suggested! To fix the problem, I'd reduce the dry onion soup mix by half. Otherwise, it was great served over rice. I will definitely give it another try--perhaps adding a splash of white wine to the sauce!

This was fabulous! I usually ruin chicken, but this recipe came out so tender and the sauce is amazing. VERY easy to make.
As others suggested, I used only 1/2 of the onion soup mix and omitted the pinch of salt.  I doubled the sauce using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken (all I had) and used chicken legs and thighs.  Very good...family LOVED it!

What a *great*, and easy, recipe! 

I made this for supper last night along with "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes". The only thing I noticed is that this recipe is so rich and flavorful, that it over powered the taste of the mashed potatoes (which were very good though!). The best thing is this was made with ingredients that I have on hand all the time.  

I used only 1/4th of the onion soup mix since my husband (and therefore *me* ) have to watch the salt intake.  It was still very flavorful and I believe could be made without the onion soup mix all together if you bumped up the other spices.
 
I browned the chicken in a deep cast iron casserole pan so all I had to do was toss the whole thing in the oven when the time came.  One dish clean up! 

I will make this one again, my family really liked it!

This looked like a really good recipe as my whole family likes recipes with sour cream.  However, none of us like this dish and I wound up throwing most of it away. It was way too salty and the onion soup mix was overpowering.  I won't make this again.

I liked this chicken because it was easy. I didn't add the dill or lemon but put in cilantro and garlic. It was a very rich and filling sauce. Next time I make this I will make white rice or mashed potatoes to go with the sauce. Very good!

This recipe is so good that my husband declared it impressive enough for company!  I took the advice given in other reviews and reduced the onion soup by half, added no other salt and a bit of milk.  I also added just a touch of garlic powder. If you didn't make extra sauce, you'll wish you had....

LOVED it! So easy to make and yummy to eat. I followed the recipe to a tee and agree that it is a bit salty and Im a salt freak! Next time will leave out salt. I did add a can of mushrooms and served over eggnoodles. Had some of the left over gravy on some garlic mashed potato's the next day and loved it that way as well!

This recipe was awesome.  The gravy mixture did seem a little thick, like some of the others have said.  Instead of milk, though, I added about 1/4 cup of white wine to the soup mixture. WOW!!!  I didn't add the lemon juice or dill or salt.  I just mixed the soup mix, soup, sour cream and wine up and poured it over the chicken and stuck it in the oven.

This chix recipe was good.  The next time I make it I will double the sauce mix to make more gravy.  I added minced garlic to the sauce, but I did forget to pepper and add paprika to the chicken.  I think it was good without it.    Very tasty.

This is easy & forgiving! At the last minute first time making it I realized I had no onion soup mix....substituting Mrs. Dash with garlic & onion powder with some extra paprika worked great. 
This is an easy to prepare winner over rice with veg, all of which you can make on the stove while the chicken is cooking in the oven!
Tip: deglaze the pan you cook the chicken in with a few ounces of beer or white wine & add to the sauce you pour over the chicken to get ALL the flavor from the pan!
This OS a fantastic,  tasty recipe that is great as is or with tweaks.

I thought this was very good and quite easy. I’m not sure it was necessary to precook the chicken. Without that step it would be super easy and less cleanup. I normally follow recipes as written but unfortunately I didn’t have any onion soup mix but based on other reviews the soup mix made it very salty. As a substitute I added a handful of dried minced onion and a teaspoon of dried beef bouillon. It wasn’t salty at all in fact I would up the beef bouillon to a tbsp for next time but will use onion soup mix instead.  The addition of dill was what drew me to this recipe. I love dill and this was delicious because of it. As someone else suggested throw in some cut up potatoes and baby carrots for a full meal in one pot. Cut the potatoes small enough so they will cook through when the chicken is cooked. I cooked the whole dish for 1 1/2 hours as my potatoes weren’t cooked enough but the chicken was done.

Too salty. I cut back on onion soup mix but it was still way too salty. My husband loved it though. Next time I'll add minced onion flakes and see if it helps.

Didn't have any onion soup, so I decided to improvise a bit.

Eliminated onion soup altogether and substituted  onion powder (about 1 teaspoon, but you may want more),  I sprinkled pepper on the thighs while browning.  Did NOT
add any salt at all as we don't use it a lot in our house.   

My husband liked it as well as my 11 year old daughter.  All agreed it deserves 4.5 starts.!  It will fit nicely into a rotation to mix things up a bit.   Definitely worth making.

You definitely don't need to use salt. I used Golden Mushroom because I like the bolder taste over regular cream of mushroom. I also love dill, so I knew I'd like this recipe. I added some extra pepper and a little garlic powder into the mix and a little milk (maybe a quarter cup at most) like the others to thin a very thick sauce, and threw in a few baby carrots into the dish (which absorbed the dill flavor). Spooned the sauce over rice, made some broccoli and a hearty salad. The family really enjoyed it. Another recipe saved in favorites.

We do like salty things - and really enjoyed the flavor of it.  I served it on egg noodles, with broccoli and cauliflower.  It is not a pretty recipe if you pour the sauce over.  Next time, I will set the chicken on top and cover it for most of the cooking time.  Then I will toss the noodles in the sauce and serve the ckicken on top of it.

Really good and really easy but way too salty - I ignored other reviews because I LOVE salt so figured it'd be fine for me but it was too much even for me!   I will most definitely make this again but I will use 1/2 of the onion soup mix.  (It's worth noting that I did not have onion soup mix so I used a recipe I found online for it - but I found the same recipe both here on this site and many other sites so I'm reasonably sure it's a good sub for the packet!)  There are very similar recipes for the crock pot so I'll probably try one of those next time.  (No browning the chicken - I'm lazy!) This would be AMAZING over rice!  (I didn't have any - that probably would have helped cut the salty taste, too.)  Really nice, easy recipe!

Wow this was awesome! I made some adjustments.  Not only did I use sour cream, but also used plain yogurt.  I didn't have the onion soup mix so instead I cut green scallions and dice onions into the mix. I also used kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.

Excellent. Did not add any additional salt. Used plain yogurt in place of sour cream (what I had). Added a little milk to thin it out. Cooked 7 minutes in pressure cooker. Served over brown rice drizzled with the yummy sauce. Thanks for a new recipe to add to our rotation!

I made this for dinner tonight as well as Algerian Carrots, also from this site.  I used boneless, skinless thighs.  I followed the recipe except I did not add the salt that was called for and I forgot the dill (I would have used it had I not forgotten).  I also added a little milk to the sauce because it was very thick!  I did not brown my chicken, but would have if it had been skin on.  My entire family loved this and we will make it again!  I almost forgot...I used up about 12 fresh mushrooms but tossing them on top while baking.

So GOOD! This was actually one of my favorite things I've ever made! I had 10 thighs bone-in so I doubled the sauce- great idea! The sauce is out of this world fantastic! The sauce would be great for beef stroganoff! I didn't have dill so I left that out and I only had 1/2 the sour cream so next time I want to try it will all the sour cream. I also browned the chicken in tons of margarine and then retained a small amount to mix with everything else. SO fantastic! I put on top of egg noddles.

I have made this recipe 3x's still working on it, but I have used others advice and made my own onion soup mix w/ beef bullion, garlic powder, and onion powder...the first time I made it the salt content was ridiculous and ...I could eat salt as a main course. I also added milk to thin it out and threw in a potato..., but we still love it

I did not care for this recipe. The dill, along with the lemon juice mixed with the hot sour cream and mushroom soup and onion soup mix was unappealing to our palates. Do not add any salt to this. The onion soup mix adds enough if not too much.

This was ok, although if I make it again I will use just 1/2 of the package of the dry onion soup mix. After browning the chicken I only baked for about 45 minutes at the most. The chicken was very moist and we served with white rice.

Given the ingredients, I really don't know why I expected this to taste like anything other than "Chicken in Onion Dip," but that's what it was to us.  Other than using chicken breast instead of thighs, omitting the salt, and adding some mushrooms, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The sauce was much too thick, and the meal was extremely heavy. No one really wants me to make this recipe again.  One of the few times I've struck out with an allrecipes entry.

I love this recipe.  It is tangy, but also rich.  I've actually had people tell me that after eating this, they crave it and beg me to make it again.  Nice and easy to make too...so a great meal on a budget and in a crunch.  I like it was chicken rice-a-roni and a veggie as my quickie meal.

I love this recipe!  I double the sauce ingredients and serve it over egg noodles.  I am always looking for new recipes for chicken thighs because I can sometimes get the thighs for 99 cents a pound on sale.  Thank you so much, this recipe is a keeper for life.

Just fixed this tonight, using 3 skinless chicken thighs, and DH says it's a keeper.  Made a few changes... I don't use onion soup mix, so I substituted 2 TB dehydrated minced onion.  After browning the chicken in a hot skillet, using cooking spray and a small pat of butter, I blotted the rendered fat out of the skillet then deglazed the pan with 2 TB sherry and 2 TB chicken broth.  I stirred 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 can mushroom soup and the lemon juice, pepper, paprika and dill together, and added the liquid from the skillet.  I also added about 5 sliced fresh mushrooms before pouring the sauce over the chicken in the baking dish.

I did not have the problem of the sauce being too thick - probably because of the extra 1/4 cup of liquid from the sherry and chicken broth.  Nor was it too salty, since I didn't use the soup mix.  

I did find the sour cream had curdled and turned grainy, as is all too common with hot sour cream sauces.  This is why it only gets 4 stars from me.  I want to use creme fraiche next time in place of the sour cream and see how that does.

This was wonderful! Not only did my husband love so did my 18 month old son!! I used chicken breast and I added a can on mushrooms. I did have to thin it out with half and half after it was done(that why 4 out of 5). I will make it again and again!!

I cut back on the salt by making a salt-free substitute for onion soup mix. Nevertheless, the final result was not enjoyable. Chicken is my favorite meal and I have a ton of recipes, but this did not taste good.

WONDERFUL! Very flavorful and super super easy to make. I read that others felt it was too salty so I too omitted the salt, and instead of onion soup mix i diced up a small onion and added a dash of seasoned salt. Still tasted great, and gave us all less sodium.

It was ok - wont make it again - I browned the chicken in the pan i was cooking bacon in and threw in some dried onions since I knew I would only use half of the onion soup mix.  So it wasnt at all too salty (I also kind of took all of the dried onions and stuff from the soup mix and left at least half of the powder, so I think that helped cut down on the salt)  I used boneless breasts and they came out very dry, so I shredded them and mixed it with the gravy for more of a stew like casserole which probably would have been pretty good over rice or noodles.

Salty indeed.  I added half the onion soup mixture, and threw in some broccoli.  It was tasty with rice and smashed cauliflower.  Next time, I'll use reduced sodium soup.

The foundation of the recipe is pretty good to work with.  We love the blend of cream soups and sour cream.  I used 98% sodium free cream of mushroom soup instead.  I also did not add any additional salt.  I did add dry onion flakes on top and covered it in foil for the first 30 minutes..  I also added 1/3 cup 2% milk to thin up the sauce. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

It's comfort food, but way too salty. I took the advice of one of the viewers and did not sprinkle chicken with salt while browning them. They are still way too salty.

I modified the recipe a bit based upon the other reviews of it being too salty and trying to make it healthier.  I used dried onion flakes (3 tbsp) instead of the onion soup mix.  I did not use salt to season the chicken either.  I used fat free soup and low fat sour cream.  It was delicious!  I served it over rice with steamed brocolli.  Both husband and picky kids ate it and liked it.  I would add a good 1/2-3/4 cup milk next time to thin the sauce even more.  Will be making it again!

Made this last night, and I have to agree with most reviewer regarding too much salt.  I didn't add salt, and still found it to be too salty from the onion soup mix.  Next time I will use only 1/2 packet of soup mix or up the sour cream content.

SALTY!!!!!!!! I didnt add the additional salt as others said it was too salty but even without the added, still too salty for me. I ended up adding plain steamed carrots and steamed rice which helped balance the salt taste, probably wont make it again. My husband said it was okay but he usually salts his food (he didnt with this meal which says alot)

I must be missing something, but I followed the recipe to a T and it just didn't do anything for me. I like salty food, so the salt content didn't bother me much, but I thought that the recipe tasted too much like the onion soup and it just didn't spread much for the gravy. Just blah.  My daughter didn't care for the chicken much either.

This is a really fantastic dish that is super easy.  I omitted the extra salt as well and used low-sodium mushroom soup, but I kept the full amount of onion soup mix.  I used lime juice instead of lemon (all I had) and fresh dill and both worked really well with the dish.  My boyfriend deemed it as "company worthy" so it must have been delicious!

This dish is superb...with a couple of modifications.  Do not add salt and rather than use the full amount of onion soup mix, I halved it.  Also, I served it over couscous, which was excellent and gave it very interesting texture and flavor.  Next time, I am going to try adding mushrooms!

This was good but too salty. I think if I used 1/2 the packet of onion soup mix and used my own cream of mushroom, then I would like it alot more.

So...I did make a substitution, but this was a tasty dish!  I didn't have any onion soup, so I threw in a handful of french's onions and about a 1/2 tsp of chicken builion.  Other than that, I used all the other ingredients, and followed the instructions.  It was really tasty, and the dill made it something different from the typical "cream of whatever and meat" dish.  I'm looking forward to trying it with the onion soup.  Another good way might be with c/o chicken, minus the onions...for a straight up creamy dill chicken...I love this website!

Needed a quick recipe and found this one.  Very tender and easy to make.  A bit bland so I will tinker with some of my own spices next time.  I will make this one again.

Wow, my husband was totally impressed w/ this recipe. He immediately said it gets 5 stars! I was a bit scared of the saltiness mentioned by some, so I put no salt in and only 1/2 pkg. onion soup mix, but it was a bit bland still when I tasted it b4 putting it together, so I added the whole pkg. I think the reason it wasn't too salty for us is the fact that I put potato chunks and fresh baby carrots in the bottom of a glass pan and microwaved it about 6 minutes to get a head start while frying the chicken w/sliced onions. I would highly recommend draining the chicken b4 putting it in the pan on top of the potatoes and carrots. I added about 1/2 cup milk and a tad more sour cream to the soup mixture and poured over top and baked about 1 1/2 hr at 350. It was heavenly w/ just the right amount of fresh lemon and dill. Try it, but make sure you taste the sauce b4 dumping it in. I do not think people who use chicken breasts can give a very accurate rating. That is a whole different dish. There is nothing like thighs in my opinion!!!!

I used four bonelesss skinless chicken breasts and added a small bag of frozen vegetables (sugar snap peas, carrots, and baby corn). I used 1/2 light sour cream and 1/2 regular because that is what I had on hand. I did not cook the chicken breasts ahead of time. Instead, I covered the casserole for the first 40 minutes, and then uncovered it for another 30 minutes to let it brown. I served it over egg noodles as another reviewer had suggested. My husband couldn't stop raving about it and ate half the casserole!

Good comfort food on a chilly night. I thought the lemon and dill gave an nice flavor to the sauce. Since I didn't have onion soup mix, I made my own with low sodium beef bouillion and onion powder (this might solve the salt problems some were having).  I sauteed an onion before browning the chicken and added canned mushrooms to the sauce.  Served over brown rice.

This was wonderful... I used boneless thighs, cream of mushroom soup with garlic (thats all I had on hand), and dried herb flavored soup mix (again all I had on hand) instead of the onion soup mix.  I also didnt use the salt or brown the chicken before I put it in the oven.  This will be a regular at our house.  Thank you

This recipe was delicious!  I used chicken breasts instead, preheated the oven to 425 & cooked them for 20 min.  I also only used a dollop of the sour cream mixture on each piece of chicken before baking, and heated the rest on the stove with a 1/2 cup heavy cream to use as a creamy sauce for a side dish of egg noodles.  Yum!

Yummy! This chicken was great! I only had 4 chicken thighs, and I eye-balled most of the ingredients. I didn't have dill weed, but added some garlic. I also seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt and pepper. I wish I had had some rice, because the "gravy" made by baking was yummy.

Turned out great. I did cut the onion soup mix in 1/2, so glad I did. I also added some milk and some slivered garlic and dried minced onion. Great dish to throw together with what you have on hand. I served it with sweet potatoe fries and stir fried veggies.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!  The only modfications I made were I took another user's review's suggestion and added sliced potatos.  Also, I didn't have any onion soup mix on hand so I made a homemade version by combining minced half onion, one cube vegetable bouillon  and teaspoon crushed celery seeds.  Then added that to the sauce. My family just raved about the meal and the potatos were very tender and delicious cooked in the sauce.  We're defintiely adding this into our meal rotation.

We all loved this easy recipe followed to a tee except for the amount of chicken (I used 12).  I used a whole sachet of onion soup which contains more than an ounce I am sure.  I did not add salt because I know the soup mix is rather salty.  I served this on whole wheat bow tie pasta with a side of steamed broccoli and a salad.  Delicious supper.

Wow! A great recipe the whole family will love. I used the recipe almost as written, except I did not brown the chicken first and I used a whole cut up chicken instead of 8 thighs. It was ridiculously easy to prepare and delicious. I served brown rice alongside it drizzled with the flavorful sauce from the pan.

What a versatile recipe!!! Feel free to play with it, clearly (as others have shown) it works!
I didn't brown the chicken first, or use salt, pepper or dill. I cut up and tossed in a potato and a carrot, cooked the chicken frozen so it took about an hour and twenty minutes to cook through but it was perfect!
Could be served over rice, mashed taters or pasta. I had none (having used the one tato in the house already and thought mashed would be a little too much) and served it over bread, worked fine. 
Lemon juice, sour cream, cream of mushroom soup and the Onion soup combo was perfect, not too salty at all. Really, ideal. 
Used the recipe with pot roast today and it was absolutely wonderful!!! Worthy 10 stars!

Good recipe! Instead of chicken thighs, I used sliced chicken breasts. To make the dish a bit creamier, I added 1/4 cup of sour cream.

This was amazing and simple! Didn't have onion soup mix, so I used the dry onion gravy mix that I had handy...maybe that helped lessen the over powering onion taste other reviewers had.  Added 1/2  onion sliced and a long spash of dry white wine and it was the perfect touch! Served with mashed potatoes and used sauce as the gravy. Will make again this weekend!

This was a GREAT recipe.  The lemon juice and dill add great flavour.  I used skinless chicken drumsticks, and I didn't brown them first.  It tasted great without browning, which makes it just that much easier to make.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definately put this as one of my favorite chicken recipes.

The lemon juice is the key.  It changes it from a "soup tasting" dish to something colorful.  The lemon goes well with a fresh green vege too.  I'm having asparagus.  I made this dish pretty much to the recipe and thought it was missing something.  I checked and realized I missed the lemon juice.  I added it and loved the dimension it added.  Don't be afraid to add too much to your taste.

Way too much sauce and I'm not sure if it is because I used non fat sour cream or if it was the lemon juice but this was so sour.  My family hated this.

My family LOVED this recipe.  Even my kids who are critical of sauces said it was yummy.
I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, with the exception of adding a 3 onion dip mix instead of the onion soup, seasoned salt instead of the s & p and paprika, and Pampered Chef all purpose dill mix instead of plain dill weed.  I chose to brown the chicken.  I used 12 thighs but I kept the sauce proportions the same (and there was plenty!)
Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe turned out to be SOOOOOOO good!! I too added only half of the onion soup mix, and the saltiness was just right. I think it would be even better on chicken breast or chicken tenders. This is a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good. I used boneless breasts that I diced and sauteed with garlic, then added the sauce and simmered until done. I did not bake in the oven. I used lowfat sour cream and healthy request soup. I also added some diced mushrooms. the lemon juice and dill really add to it. I would make this again.

Spectacular!   I used 4 boneless chicken breasts and skipped the browning step.  Raves at our house, no leftovers!   I think the lemon and dill additions are the key to this recipe.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I thought it was pretty good, and wished I had doubled the sauce.  I only used half of an onion soup mix package and found the saltiness to be just right, so I was glad I didn't use the whole thing.

Very good!  I didn't have dry soup mix, so I crushed two chicken bouillion cubes and chopped a small onion very finely.  Added a little milk to the mixture b/c the onion really thickened it.  The sauce was wonderful!!  Thanks so much, we will definitely have this again!

I made this dish tonight.  Since I have mushroom-haters in the house, I used cream of broccoli soup instead. I did add about a half a can of milk and omitted the extra salt.  
We liked this quite a bit, but will tweak it for next time by using reduced sodium soups and a full can of milk. Otherwise, it was really good and really different.

This was sooo good!  I served it with mashed potatoes and everyone had seconds.  I did only put half of the dry onion soup mix in and my hubby said it was still salty.  I love salt so I didn't notice.  I used boneless chicken breasts and cream of chicken soup and I never cook without garlic so I sprinkled some granulated on it before browning.  It's definitely one of those comfort foods that you don't want to eat everyday but worth it once in a while.

My husband got an unsure look on his face when I told him we were having sour cream chicken for supper but he ate every last bit of it!  Easy to prepare and very tasty.  Followed the recipe to a tee.  A nice change.

This was ok.  I added white wine, omitted the salt, and only put in half the onion soup mix package (as past reviews said it was too salty with the whole package), but I found it to be a bit bland.  It needs something else to jazz it up a bit...

This recipe turned out great!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used half a package of onion soup mix, so the end product wasn't too salty.  I used boneless breast strips, skipped the browning step, and cut the baking time down to 35 minutes.  Very easy and delicious.  I've made this dish a few times and it's already a family favorite.  Great with mashed potatoes.  Thanks!

This was delicious, I used six boneless skinless
chicken breasts and doubled the sauce ingrediants
and served with egg noodles to put sauce on. This
was very good but it is salty, next time I will try to eliminate extra salt.

This was Great!  The entire family loved it.  I had to make it a little differnt because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand....I used the soup, about 3/4 cup sour cream, milk, onion pwdr and garlic pwdr. I also only had 98% fat free soup and was worried it would alter the taste...but it was GREAT!  I will definetly make again.

This was great!  Both my husband I loved it.  I added a full can of milk so it was nice and juicy.  I omitted the salt because the soup has plenty.  So glad I made enough for leftovers tonight.  I would certainly serve this for company.

This was easy and quick to make - and only got two pans dirty.  We used chicken breasts instead of thighs, and I left out the dill because I didn't have any on hand.  The sauce makes a good "gravy" for mashed potatoes, too.  I'll definitely be making this again.

My husband made this one...it was really easy with ingredients we normally have on hand. He used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. It was very tender and tasty. YUM!

My husband and I both love this yummy dish. The sauce tastes like the Lipton onion soup dip from the 60's. I removed most of the skin, used half fat-free sour cream and thinned the sauce a bit with fat-free half and half near the end. Wonderful!

Yum! This recipe was excellent! I normally don't like things made with onion or mushrooms, but I really enjoyed this. And it couldn't be easier to make. Simply dump and stir. I may, however, make it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts next time, as I am trying to watch my cholesterol.

I found this recipie to be great!  I didn't brown the chicken (I forgot),and put in the pan 12 instead of the 8-9 thighs the recipie called for, but popped it in the oven anyways.  I left it in for an hour and a half instead, but it turned out just fine.  It was tasty, I could forget about it, and I wasn't slaving over a stove cooking for guests!  I could socialize... it was yummy, and we used the sause for flavor for the rice, and veggies, and we sopped up the leftover sause with bread.  There was nothing left of it!
Definetly a Keeper!

Very yummy. I did a few of the suggestions from these reviews: added a sliced onion, adding less of the onion soup mix (about 1/4 of the packet), splash of milk to thin the sauce, putting everything on a bed of thinly sliced potato, NOT adding more salt. Turned out great! Very stroganoff tasting. I think it would be an awesome sauce On top of steak! I loved the tang of the lemon and dill.

Oh my!! This is so delicious! 
I followed the recipe pretty much as written except used chicken thighs  with back attached. Due to the bigger pieces, I baked a bit longer and covered it with thin foil for half the time.  I also added a few more seasonings to the chicken but omitted the salt due to the onion soup mix being salty already.  
The flavor of the sauce is amazing! 
Thank you so very much for sharing your recipe. It's a keeper.

I did add some garlic powder and onion powder.    Also did cubed potatoes in a roasting bag with the extra sauce.    Only had 4 thighs.  Very yummy!   Hubs and I thought sauce would also make a great dip.  Tasted like french onion to us just better!   Love your recipes!

This is a 10. The only thing I did differently was I wanted a one pan meal so I added 1 can of chicken broth and a cup of uncooked instant rice after I browned the chicken. Boneless/skinless chicken  only took 40 minutes. Great recipes!

Good basic recipe.  4 stars because it is too much sodium as is. I followed the basic recipe with the chicken (used skinless/boneless breast), with lite sour cream and low salt cream of mushroom soup baking 1 hour at 350 F.   I marinated the chicken in those two ingredients for 1.5 hours, with dill, paprika, pepper, and 1 big sautéed onion and 3 sticks diced celery in the marinade (to make up for the onion soup mix not added). To the casserole dish I added 1.5 cups thinly sliced carrots and a pint sautéed mushrooms. I did not brown the marinated chicken, I just assembled the chicken and marinade with veggies to the baking dish for an hour.  Very nice results!  I did not miss the salt or  onion mix, lots of flavor.

This recipe has good 'bones', but like other cooks, I made a few changes.  I used chicken breasts and cut them into thick slices (2-3 per breast).  That reduced baking time significantly (I wasn't interested in a browned sauce).  While browning the chicken, I sprinkled the pieces with garlic powder and paprika (more than called for in the recipe).  I omitted the salt and pepper.  After removing the chicken from the pan I deglazed the pan with a couple of splashes of white wine I had handy.  I reduced the dry onion soup mix to only approx. 1/2 Tablespoon and added 1 Tablespoon dried chopped onions (always in the pantry).  I also reduced the amount of sour cream slightly.  The result was fantastic - I served it on pasta.

Very easy to make and very good. I took a can of peas and rinsed throughly w water then sauteed onions in olive oil and added peas. Threw in some garlic, and half tsp of sugar.  They came out great. Then added the peas regular rice and served chicken over it. Was a great hit & will make again.

I loved the recipe...I did make a couple changes, I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken soup instead....I didn't have onion soup mix so I added onion powder and a bunch of other spices to substitute. The flavor was delicious and the combination of the soup and sour cream made the chicken so tender and moist. I would definitely make this dish again. I served it with Stove Top stuffing and peas.

My husband and I both loved this! I used two cans of soup and slightly more than a cup of sour cream because we like lots of gravy. I added 2% milk to thin sauce. I didn’t add extra salt. Used boneless skinless thighs and cooked it for 45 minutes in oven after browning in skillet.

I thought I'd try this because of all the good reviews. I followed the recipe but didn't add extra salt per the recommendations here. I really didn't care for it, my husband and son said it was okay but if I never made it again that was okay too. The sauce tasted too much like onion dip. While I like onion dip on my chips, not so much on my chicken. Eh...try, try again....

This is a great dish but way too salty! I made the recipe exactly as illustrated and in the future I would absolutely cut the onion soup mix in half at a minimum. I think the recipe would be excellent if it wasn’t so salty. Just changing the amount of onion soup mix I think it would be 4-5 stars for sure!

I was one thigh short and missing lemon juice and dill weed, but it was still a hit. Served it with jasmine rice and asparagus. May have used too much sauce because it was  bit of a pain to clean the pan afterwards.

I found it too salty with the onion soup mix. I salted the chicken lightly first and wished I hadn't.  It was okay but felt like 1970s easy meal option - wouldn't make again.

We made this in our Instant Pot and it turned out delicious!  I think this is the first dish that my daughter loved and asked for seconds.  My husband liked it a lot but thought the onion was a little strong.

This is going to be a staple around our house. We had twin boys 18 months ago and I'm trying to get some recipes that the boys will eat. Most of the stuff I cook for me and my wife are spicier than I'd want to feed them so I've been experimenting with non-spicy recipes. Those two boys ate as much as me---each! The only thing I did different than the recipe (simply because I was hurrying to get back to the boys) was I forgot to add the onion soup mix into the sour cream mixture. So I just added the soup to a 1/4 cup water and pour/spooned it over the dish. The onions in the soup crisped up and added a nice crunch to the dish. Highly recommend this. Easy and delicious!

I made as written, but I did follow the recommendation of adding some carrots and potatoes to the dish, and it came out wonderfully.  Because of the veggies, I cooked an extra half hour over the recommended time.  If you decide to go that route, I recommend covering the dish in foil for the entire hour so that everything gets cooked and the sauce doesn't dry or over brown on the chicken.  I will definitely make again.  

And let me just say, that sauce is amazing!  I'm already plotting what veggies I'm going to put in on another time!

I did not brown the chicken first.  I only used 1/2 of the onion soup packet, and I sprinkled garlic powder on my chicken. We ate it over rice and there was plenty of gravy.

I will make this again, but follow the advice of the other reviewers and omit the salt completely! Also I think buying a sodium free mushroom soup would help! I did add fresh mushrooms and some caramelized onions to the sauce, and the next time I will use chicken breast!!!

This was so good! I usually read reviews before making but forgot this time and it was almost too salty. Next time I make it, I will not include the salt and will look for low sodium soup. Just to lower the calories, I used 1/2 cup sour cream & 1/2 cup 0 fat Greek Yogurt. We couldn't wait to have the left overs the next day.  UPDATE: I've made this several times now and have tried different variations. I  feel it turned out best when I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 yogurt (vs. all sour cream), I did not salt the chicken thighs, and I covered the casserole dish with foil for 45 min, then removed for last 15 min because it was burnt on the edges the first few times. I get rave reviews every time I make it.

Easy and delicious! Don't use salt but sprinkled liberally with garlic sriracha ( sam's club) powder.  Added mushrooms as well since the soup had them in it.. Served with quinoa and rice blend  and steamed broccoli.

the only change I made was not adding any salt.  With the onion soup mix and the can of mushroom soup, it really didn't need any.  Very good recipe.   Everyone loved it.

I agree with other reviews - too salty. I made it as written as I like to try recipes first before modifying. But next time I'll skip salting the meat & buy low sodium soup mix.

Thank you for this easy recipe.  I used 4 bone in thighs and---. I know how much other folks dislike the BUT part to the review.  But, I did add one can of mushrooms, about 6 oz. of white wine and a sliced up onion. I discovered, too late to run to the grocery, that I did not have egg noodles so I served with angel hair instead and a nice salad. Everything else was as directed in the recipe.  Bottom line, Husband was happy, I liked it and the leftovers will be great. Thanks again.

This was awesome!  I did leave out the regular salt, figuring the soup and dry soup mix would make up for it.  I only had 4 boneless thighs, so I ended up chunking some potatoes and tossing them in with the chicken.  It was a great and easy meal with a canned veggie on the side.  I'm going to try it on pork soon, too, and see how that tastes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I didn't have any sour cream the second time i made this, so I threw in some mayonnaise instead.  Absolutely one of the best flavoured meals I've had.  I also only used half of an envelope of instant onion soup mix.  Everyone at my table enjoyed it.

This was amazing!  My family loved it!!!!  I completely forgot to buy lemon juice but it was amazing without it!!!  The thing is, I made the 8 chicken thighs as directed which is normally fine and we have leftovers.  But it was SO GOOD everyone came back for more, I ran out FAST!  So I have to make extra next time!  :)

It was good. I made a few changes, but nothing of significance. I used boneless chicken thighs, olive oil, added a can of mushrooms and used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I made it with instant mashed potatoes and canned green beans and it was a quick easy meal. The family liked it. I'll make it again.

Very good my wife and I loved it. We added milk (1 cup) to thin the sauce and layered the bottom with carrots, potatoes and celery as others had mentioned. Added garlic (minced) when browning. Next time might dust with poultry seasoning as well. Was very, very salty, but served over white rice which helped.

This turned out really good; will definitely make it again. One little change...I'm not big on mushrooms so I used cream of celery soup.  Also, will make pasta or mashed potatoes with it next time as it made quite a bit of "gravy."

Love this meal, its great!  Ive done it in a crockpot, in the over, with boneless chicken breasts, and with thighs.  Its all turned out great every time.  Sauce is amazing.  As others have said, dont bother adding the extra salt.

I left out the salt as suggested but used 1/4c sherry and 1/4c chicken stock instead of lemon juice to make the sauce more liquid. I used three chicken breast and added a can of mushrooms and garlic powder.  I used a meat thermometer to 165*. The potatoes were not quite done; so will par cook them next time.  I would make again.

This was so easy and has a rich taste, My 93 yo Mom-n-law has stopped eating but the sauce which reminds me of a hollandaise sauce, stimulated her palate again.  I did switch up to Cream of Broccoli  Soup (only cause of not a fan of the mushroom) , no Dill, a dash of celery salt, and took advice of another and added the French Fried Onions just a 1/2 c. could have used more personally.  But instead of the others suggested potatoes and carrots, I added steamed Brussel Sprouts after cooking the chicken, just  tossed them into the sauce....not a pretty dish but very flavorful  Definitely a great quick meal, inexpensive in the big picture

Simple and delicious! Based on other reviews, I did omit the salt and used low sodium soup. Served with steamed green beans. Kiddos loved it and it has already been requested again. A keeper!

Yummy! This is a very satisfying dish - easy to make. I made brown rice and steamed veggies to go with it.  The Onion Soup Mix has plenty of salt so I recommend skipping the salt on anything else you make to go along with the dish, otherwise it may be too salty. Can't wait to make this again!

I halved the dill and 1/2 way through the cooking, I notice the sauce looked goopy. So I whisked 1 c. milk into the sauce.   I served with salad, cheesy smashed potatoes from Kraft website and steamed carrots and steamed cauliflower. I served with homemade bread.Cooked 1 1/2 hours. I do not think I will make it again. Kids did not eat.

delicious and easy.  I read the comments on the recipe and noted that others had said it was salty, so I did not add more salt during cooking.  It certainly didn't need any...the soup mix is pretty salty.  I served it with some egg noodles on the side, and the sauce was great on those.  I'll make this again!

This was totally delicious!!!!  Only two changes.   Did NOT add lemon juice, and added 1/2 cup of milk to sauce.  OOPS, also salt pepper and paprika BEFORE I browned the chicken.  My husband is a chef, and he LOVED it!!! :-)

I discovered this recipe back in college and it's been comfort food ever since.  I use boneless chicken breasts, skip the browning stage and just combine everything together,  pour over chicken  and bake.   I also have started replacing 1/2 the sour cream with fat free plain yogurt and added mushrooms to the sauce.  We love it best served over egg noodles.

This was so easy and delish.  At first I wasn't sure about the dill but all the seasonings worked well together and it ended up perfect.  There was only 1 change and that was just that I left out the extra salt.  I'm telling you, you won't miss it.

This is absolutely delicious the way it's written. I did add a small head of fresh broccoli and covered it before it went into the oven. Made rice on the side and had an awesome meal for two days.

Make This Recipe!  Moist and tender chicken, a little tangy and altogether tasty!  I substituted cream of chicken soup, as I dislike the flavor of mushrooms.  You MUST try this!

Rave reviews from adults,  kids reluctantly tried but liked.   Followed some reviewers suggestions and skipped the extra salt and added some milk to thin the sauce.   Also added baby carrots and sliced potatoes on the bottom.   Will put in regular rotation!

Too salty and too strong an onion flavor for my taste...and my husbands. We ate it, but wouldn't make again. Maybe only using half the onion soup packet would be better.

I doubled the recipe but used only one envelope of onion soup & added a sliced onion   Used 1 can of cream of chicken & mushroom. I skipped the added salt but added baby potatoes & fresh sliced carrots. I would recommend pare boiling potatoes & carrots.   This is a great recipe for a chicken pie.

We liked this recipe a lot, but I tweaked it a bit. I didn't have Cream of Mushroom soup (which I usually do!), so when I went to make this I had to use what I had which was Cream of Chicken.  I browned the thighs in butter and sprinkled only Paprika on them.  I wanted a lot of sauce so I used two cans of Cream of Chicken soup, probably over two cups of sour cream (which I think helps cut the problem of saltiness)and the rest of the recipe ingredients plus a bit of heavy cream to thin it a bit.  I deglazed the pan with white wine, added whole mushrooms and cooked a bit. Poured the sauce over the chicken along with the mushrooms and baked.  It was easy to make and delicious, the chicken was very tender. I served it with rice and green beans.

Made recipe tonight for a fast dinner. It was delicious and enjoyed by all except I felt by not covering the pan that there was not enough sauce (sauce by the way was wonderful).  The chicken was very tender and I added potatoes and carrots which were very good.  I used less dry onion soup mix, did not salt the chicken, added a small amount of milk and it was just right not too salty.  I will try again but will cover loosely with foil and add more liquid next time to avoid not having enough of that wonderful sauce.

I've fixed this several times. My family loves it. I use pork chops in place of chicken occassionally. Also, I thin the sauce down with milk. Makes enough gravy to use over either noodles or rice. Yum!

This was fantastic - easy, inexpensive and everyone loved it.  I used low fat greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I added about 6 sliced carrots to the casserole. It was so good. Easy to reheat for lunch the next day.

I seasoned the chicken with an assortment of spices but I added no salt like other users recommended. I also used drum sticks instead of thighs. I didn't have the onion mix so I just used the mushroom mix with the seasoning. It came out wonderful! I would definetly make again but I would use milk to thin out the sauce because it was a little too thick.

Super easy! Changed a few things to our own taste preferences. First, I sauté onions, mushrooms and thinly sliced carrots and omit salt as the soup and onion mix has plenty. Season the chicken w pepper and paprika and yum yum yum

I made this tonight,  I agree a little salty. But not horrible.  I added garlic powder to the mix. I wouldn't salt the chicken before or after cooking. I would brine it first.  1 half cup salt. 1 half cup sugar  and 6 cups water,  soak overnight. Then cook as directed with no additional salt... YUMMY!!!!!!!!  Serve with mashed garlic and parsley potatoes and a fresh chopped salad..    NOTE... I believe bone in thighs are best  for a more moist chicken and better mouth feel .

Turned out pretty well. The sauce looked unappealingl - at least it did for me, tasted amazing though thankfully! Didn't add salt & pleased as it was definitely salty enough on it's own.

When I read the ingredients, I thought this recipe would be rather mundane.  How many times have I dumped mushroom soup over chicken in my lifetime?  The final result was anything but!  The only changes I made were using regular Progresso Mushroom Soup because I'm gluten intolerant, and I didn't add any extra salt.  My personal opinion is that the lemon juice and the dill weed are what make this recipe so good.  The best part is that hubby loved it as well.  Thanks for sharing.

We made this with herb-ed cream of chicken and doubled the lemon and halved the onion soup, we really enjoyed this. Also added some sliced onion and two small potatoes sliced like medallions to the sauce as we cooked it all in a ceramic dutch oven on top of the stove. Was great on rice.

My family loved this recipe! The only thing I added was mushrooms in the sauce and I placed potatoes around the chicken. The sauce covered everything and it was very tasty!

I didn't add the dry onion soup mix (because I didn't have). The sauce was a little bit thick but, it still turned out pretty good, my husband and friends liked it a lot. Thanks for sharing!

I only make recipes on here exactly as written, but for one of the first times, I had to substitute ingredients...I didn't have any lemon juice, so instead, I greased the pan with lemon pepper seasoned butter and olive oil saute starter, and then threw the remaining cube into the frying pan and quickly browned the chicken in it.  I also only had 3/4 cup of sour cream, so I made up the difference with heavy whipping cream as suggested by other cooks...THIS WAS PHENOMENAL!!!  My husband and I were soooooooooo impressed, especially myself, as I stay away from the onion-soup-mix/cream of mushroom concoctions.  But this was amazing!!!  Thanks for the "souper" recipe, lol!!

This turned out better than expected.  Looked for a recipe for what I had in the house and this fit the bill.  Turned out great.  The dill really made this tasty.  As others suggested I did not add any extra salt because the onion soup mix has enough. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for some work colleagues and everyone seemed to love it! 
I changed a few things, I didn't have dill, so I subsituted rosemary, which is delicious, I cut the onion soup mix in half to save on salt. Added milk to thin it and added a tbs of parmesian cheese, because I need cheese in everything. 

It is extremely delicious and thank you all SO much for the tips. Yumyumyum.

We liked this recipe a lot.  It has a nice blend of flavors with the lemon and dill and very savory.  Lots of umami and great as a hearty dish to serve over pasta or rice, even potatoes!  I, however, would only use half a package or a quarter of the onion soup mix as mentioned.  I also added fresh mushrooms over the chicken before adding the sauce to add extra mushroom flavour

I made this and it's very very good. I didn't have a whole cup of sour cream so I made up the difference with heavy cream. I didn't brown the chicken and I only used 1/2 a tsp of dill (cause I'm not a big fan of dill). My step son who is ultra picky loved this and went back for seconds!

This chicken was delicious! I used a can of broccoli cheddar soup because that was what I had in the pantry. I also added 1/4 cup of italian salad dressing to give the sauce more flavor. I thinly sliced 5 red potatoes and layered them on the bottom of the casserole dish and put the chicken and sauce over the potatoes.

Followed recipe exactly but without the salt (per other reviews).  We were simply not impressed and will definitely NOT make this recipe again.  Gravy was way to thick and salty and overpowering taste of onion soup...not in a pleasant way.

This has an okay flavor. The best part is the sour cream--it really makes the gravy pop. I agree that the gravy is a bit thick so add a little milk or water to thicken. I served over brown rice.

The chicken was moist and tender, but the sauce was more like a chip dip than a sauce. If you make this, don't serve with too much sauce on it. Just remove the chicken from the casserole dish and refrain from scooping the excess sauce and plopping on top.

Not impressed. I felt the reviews were misleading.  The onion soup mix is the salt culprit.  I thought this would be mild and flavorful but all you taste is salt and onion soup. Don't waste your dill or your time on this recipe.

First I'll say that I made this dish with some modifications because I didn't have onion soup mix or dill.  As a substitute for the onion soup I used a leek soup mix.  I also added some frozen broccoli.  I served it over jasmine rice that I made with chicken broth. The chicken was quite tender & juicy but I must say I didn't care for this dish and won't likely make it again.  I don't know if it was the leek soup mix or what but at the end of my meal I began to want to gag when forcing myself to finish & not waste food.  It will be interesting to see what my teenage son thinks of it when he comes home from practice.

Nice dish, the thighs turned out nice and moist.  The sauce was actually a tad thin but nothing to complain about.  Next time I would go with a little less sour cream, it kind of overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients.  Overall very good though

i loved this chicken. i dream about it! that being said i didn't follow the recipe exactly. i used chicken breast and cream of chicken because that's what i had on hand. added carrots, murshrooms & potatoes. also the gravy is so good i added milk to get a little more. don't add salt, it's pretty salty as others mentioned. no dill because i was out, but i'm sure it'd be great. served over rice. this is a family favorite

This was delicious! I had Helavadip in French Onion 1/2 cup left so used that with 1/2 package of dry french onion soup package. I added a bit more dill and lemon juice and paprika and just tasted it before I put it on the chicken. I cut up fresh mushrooms and put that in too! Awesome!

This sure is salty.  After I mixed the sauce mixture, I tried it and didn't think it was salty.  Somehow after it's cooked, it's much saltier.

It's so yummy. My husband requests it once a week along with my home-made mashed potato. But I changed it a little bit. I don't use the onion powder soup mix. I used a can of French onion soup instead. It tests so great. :)

Excellent recipe. I did cut out the salt as other people recommended. I also added 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms and 1 cup of milk to the sauce. This made a great gravy for the mashed potatoes. My family loved it!

Super Easy and yummy.  I used cream of celery because I don't like mushrooms and didn't have cream of chicken - still good! Thanks for advice about halfing the onion soup.

I thought this recipe was very easy.  I didn't brown the thighs I just put them in a greased dish.  I didn't use any salt either. Since most of the reviews said the onion soup made it too salty I substituted French fried onions and crushed them up (@4 tbsp)and added a touch of onion powder. My 4 year old cleaned her plate.

Very good - the entire family liked it - even my picky teenage daughter. Had to use dry veggie soup mix instead of onion, and I added Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing mix on top. I think we'd all prefer chicken breasts though - the skinless, boneless thighs were a little too fatty.

yep, 5 stars cause it may be a canned soup recipe but it's good. My husband isn't usually a fan of soup and chicken, but enjoyed this as did my 1yr old. I think the dill and sour cream was the trick. made recipe as is but used boneless, skinless thighs.

I used chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I though this just tasted like onion dip that you would dip chips in over chicken.  We didn't care for it.

interesting concept. i used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs and left out the dillweed. it was a little bland and not at all what i thought it would taste like, but it wasn't too bad. i probably won't make it again, it just didn't work for me.

I liked this and so did my family. Our only complaint was that it was too salty. I didn't salt the chicken like it said to do. Still too salty. Next time I will try using half of the onion soup mix. I used low fat mushroom soup and light sour cream. I also used chicken breasts which I browned using Pam spray. I will make this again. Thanks

My husband & I love this for dinner.  I changed it up a little one night, I used Lipton's Vegetable Soup dry mix with Cream of Celery soup, and it was awesome, too!  A little tangy, we liked it like that though.

I loved this recipe and so did the rest of my family. It was very easy and it was different from your typical chicken casserole dish. I think the dill in the sauce is what made this dish.

I made this for my husband, and he LOVED it!!! I really only had to make one adjustment to the recipe. My husband and children are allergic to wheat, so we can't use any canned soup. Insteadm we make our own soup base and add water.  I was, however, able to find wheat-free onion soup mix, so that was fine. We love this recipe and will make it often. Thanks for submitting it!!!

I used only half a packet of onion soup mix and omitted the salt. Great recipe...quick, cheap and easy.

My husband is usually critical of most new recipes, but he liked this one as soon as he tasted it. I did make some changes based on what I had on hand, so here's what I did: Half the veg oil, and about 1/2 T butter. Just my preferred method of browning. I completely omitted the salt, pepper, and paprika. We were out of cream of mushroom, so I used cream of asparagus instead. I would love to try it with the cream of mushroom, though, since that's one of the reasons I chose this recipe. I also omitted the dill, as I couldn't see how it would possibly help the flavor, and I'm out of it anyway. I served this over our favorite sour cream/garlic mashed potatoes with steamed veggies.  This was a huge hit at our house, and I will definitely be making it again this winter!

I just made this tonight and we all loved.  I made it with Cream of Asparagus soup because my daughters don't like mushrooms. This was really good and easy. The chicken was so tender it fell apart.

Love it! I soak the chicken thighs in water and seasoning salt in a ziploc bag and put in the fridge for 1 hr. After, I rolled in bed of flour with onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper and fried it until brown.  I didnt have onion soup mix so I only used onion powder.The chicken came out tender and juicy and a little bit crispy after baking.  Serve with mashed potatoes and vegetable. Excellent Sunday dinner!

I liked this recipe, but I would not call it the best.  I think maybe next time, I will follow the advice of others and only use half the onion soup mix.  I am sure I will make it again though.

I am giving this a 4 only because my husband really liked it. He put his over rice. I thought the taste of the dill was a bit much. I probably will make again just because my husband liked it so much. My 2 year old also really liked it.

I do it a bit differently.  I double the sauce and use 1 onion soup mix, then serve it over pasta.  My family loves it. I've even doubled the chicken thighs and 4x the sauce for a larger crowd.

I thought this recipe was very tasty, but it was too heavy for my family.  Husband and daughter said not a keeper.  May be better in the dead of winter when you want that heavy stick with you kind of dinner!

I see others said this was too salty, but not for my family.  I guess it's just what you are used to.  We loved it!  I did make one small change.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, since I have a family member that can't eat mushrooms.  Turned out perfect!  Thanks for our new favorite chicken dish!

I made this recipe last night and it turned out well.  I did not quite have a full cup of sour cream so I used an additional can of cream of mushroom.  I also omitted the salt and basically browned the chicken with paprika, poured the sauce mixture over it and added a pound of crimini mushrooms.  Served over rice with steamed veggies.   Yumm!!!

EXCELLENT RECIPE! I served it for the first time to company (rather scary) and got rave reviews! As others have said, I used 1/2 the soup mix and the chicken was seasoned perfectly. My husband could not believe how tender it turned out. We will definitely use it again!!

Delicious!  Hubby and I devoured it!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and if I did, it would only be to make a little more sour cream topping so there was more to go around, especially on mashed potatoes.  I found a wonderful sour cream potato recipe that went with this perfectly, especially with the sour cream from the chicken.  Will definitely make again!

Very tasty and easy to make.  It was a little too salty (that's without adding the salt as the recipe states).  I will try to thin it out in the future and maybe add less of the onion soup mix.

This was just ok for me.  It was very easy, and an easy way to cut down on prep time is to not brown the chicken.  I used creamm of chicken soup instead of mushroom, since we're not a mushrooom house.  I served this with rice.  The kids ate it, but no one loved the large quantity of onions.  I also used a dill mix instead of straight dill.

So good! I browned the chicken in an oven-proof skillet, then spooned (too thick to pour!) the sauce over each thigh in the same skillet. I baked them for about 40 mins. The sauce was too thick for gravy, so I added milk to thin it out. Oh, I used Pampered Chef Dill Mix instead of dill, too. Wow!!!

I personally was not a huge fan of this recipe.  I used chicken breasts and served it over butter noodles.  It was just o.k.  I gave it three stars because my youngest son ate the whole thing!

It wasn't "blow your mind" delicious so, it gets three stars from me. It was good though. The salt content was just right for my taste. Nice dilly flavor.

Good family meal dish. I used healthy choice mushroom soup to reduce the sodium and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. This was quick and easy. Thanks.

This is similar to a dish I make quite often, but the onion soup mix ads a new spin on it for us. We liked it very much. It's great how quick and easy it is.

Great comfort food.  Easy and delicious.  I made a couple of changes due to previous comments.  I doubled the cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, lemon juice and dill weed.  It was not too salty and I had extra sauce for rice.  Will definitely make again.  Yummy!

My girlfriend and I LOVED this recipe.  We used drumsticks instead of thighs, but of course it still came out wonderfully.  You'll definately want to spoon the sauce from the baking dish over the chicken when serving.  This one's a keeper!

This recipe was amazing. My husband said right away this was the best tasting chicken he has had. Since so many readers commented on the saltiness I dared using the whole soup mix, I used 3/4 and it was super, probably could have used the whole pack. I forgot to season the chicken after I browned it so after pouring the gravy on a sprinkled each thigh with Pepper - this made it very tasty the thighs were so tender! I think using thighs with the skin is the key, absorbs all that gravy. I also spread the gravy on the bottom of the pan.

This was okay - nothing great.  I used chicken breasts and skipped the browning step.  I should've taken other reviewers advice and only used a half pack of onion soup mix because it was a little overpowering.

My husband and I both loved it, and it was so simple to make.  I served it over brown rice.

Delicious!  I did not find this too salty as others have.  However, I did not add salt as called for.  I also did not brown the chicken before baking, since I skinned the thighs. If you like onion dip, you'll love this recipe!

I thought this was great.  I used chicke breasts and I didn't have any soup mix, so I put in some onion powder.  Didn't need any additional salt, so I'd leave that out.  Very tasty.

This chicken was very easy to make, and quite tasty.  I will make it again.

I read all the other reviews first, so I made some modifications.  I only used 1/2 the package of onion soup mix, and didn't add any additional salt.  I also threw in a package of frozen artichoke hearts, and sprinkled the top with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  My husband loved it- he completely cleaned his plate and had me put the remaining sauce in the fridge to be pasta sauce on a later date.  However, I still didn't think it was great. My husband said 5 stars, but I think only four.

I used boneless breasts instead and thought the flavor was very good, but it was VERY salty. I would use only half the onion soup next time.

Barely ok.  Too salty and looked terrible.  The onion soup mix was overpowering. I will not be making this again.

This recipe is sooo good! Perfect for a cold winters evening. I took the advice of another rater and added 1/4 white wine, was very good! Served it with a side of baked potato and green beans. I will definitely make it again. Thank You!

Very easy to make and flavorful. I used boneless chicken breasts and added more mushrooms! Thinned down the sauce a bit with some milk. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again.

Always in search of an easy chicken recipe that can also provide a sauce for plain white rice and found that this one was very tasty, the kids loved it and there was enough creamy sauce to pour over the rice too!!

Very good tasting chicken and gravy. I only had Lipton's Onion-Mushroom dry soup mix on hand, and it worked fine.

This is a tasty meal. The Sauce was excellent great flavor. Next time we are going to mix chicken chunks from chicken breast in the sauce and pour over mashed potatos. We tried it over noodles this time and it was just terrific. Not only does it taste good but, it smells great baking.

I fixed this for main dish at our Thursday luncheon at my shop. It was a big hit and what we call "a keeper". I type it up and put it in our cookbook of our favorite recipes.

tried substituting ground celery seed for dill and that didn't work too well, but the kids still wolfed it down.
