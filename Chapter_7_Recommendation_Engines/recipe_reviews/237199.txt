I made this today for dinner. I didn't precook or smoke the sausage. I used the large link sausages and cut them in thirds and added potatoes and carrots with garlic powder, salt, pepper and oregano to add flavor. I also used a 1/2 bag of 15 bean soup and a 1/2 bag of black eyed peas and let it cook on low for 10 hours and sausage cooked just fine. Very tasty!

I hate to give such a low rating but I made exactly as written and this lacked flavor. I thought for sure that the 5 bouillon cubes and pound of sausage would make this extremely salty but if fact it was quite the opposite. I make a lot of soup and I never could put my finger on what this was lacking. Adding herbs would be a must if I ever attempted this again and I think using chicken broth in place of the cubes and water might have helped too. This was super simple and I think it has potential but it definitely needs some tweaking in my opinion.

There wasn't much flavor.  I added a few things to it to bring more flavor.

This is a very simple dish to prepare, but it lacks flavor.  The sausage gives it a bit of smokiness, but it cries out for salt, pepper, more garlic, maybe some hot sauce.  I also thought the broth was too thin;  I mashed up some of the beans to thicken it a bit and that helped.  Served with homemade cornbread and a salad---thanks!
