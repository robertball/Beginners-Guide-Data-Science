This was a very yummy recipe....with a few modifications.  First, I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream for a moisture texture, I used VERY ripe bananas, and used 3/4 cup of walnuts.  I also mixed the dry ingredients and the "wet" ingredients seperately before blending them and and carefully added walnuts last.  Also, my secret....SHHH!...after the bread has cooled completely, I wrapped it up in plastic wrap and let it sit (to allow flavors to blend)then served it the next day. YUMMY!

The first time I baked this bread, it was quite good. I made it again today and decided to try some of the variations suggested by other reviewers: I added extra banana (the riper, the better), 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Cooked it for exactly an hour, and the result was even better the second time around. The bread had a mouthwatering aroma, which filled up our home.

I tried this recipe but added about a half-cup extra banana mush and used half brown sugar. The taste was good, but the texture was lacking the quality I was looking for. It's just not my mom's recipe. It's light and fluffy, and if that's what you want, this is the recipe for you, but I wanted heavier and with a darker color and texture (and more banana flavor). I think beating the eggs first and adding the banana to the liquid, then blending the dry ingredients in would be better for texture as well. All in all, a nice light snacking loaf, but not what I had in mind.

Using some suggestions from previous reviews, I modified as follows:  I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 cup heavy cream and substituted 3/4 cup of flour for whole wheat flour.  This produced a dense and very flavorful bread.  I especially like the ease of preparation.  Thanks!

This is the best banana bread recipe I have found so far.  It has great banana flavor and moist texture that I like in banana bread.  I added 1 tsp each of vanilla, cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Next time I might try adding chocolate chips just for another twist to this great basic recipe.  Bravo!

Great banana flavor, easy to make.  I've made it more than once and everyone loves it.  Hard to overcook, too, which is always a plus.

My daughter helped me make this recipe, and though it was easy, the taste left much to be desired.  I don't know if it was just myself, but I only managed one tiny sliver before I couldn't eat it.  I think I'll keep looking.

I've had (and made)much better banana bread.  This recipe was kind of blah.  I will be switching back to my standard recipe.

I'm not a banana bread fan, so I didn't actually try this recipe.  But my friends all raved about it.  My sister shared some of the bread with her dorm hall -- it was gone so quickly!  Now I've had requests from all of her friends... Great recipe, and very easy to make.

This is such a simple and easy recipe, and it makes such excellent banana bread!  It is really a great "base" recipe, because you can customize it to your liking very easily, or just follow the recipe and get no-brainer, wonderful, easy, delicious bread.  I have made this twice now, The first loaf, I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees, and it was fantastic!  I think this bread is best after it cools down and the flavors have a chance to mature. Steaming hot from the oven it is very tempting to slice it up and dig in, (especially after your kitchen  smells so good while it's baking) but the banana flavor doesn't seem to  be well developed at that point...

Nice light, moist, cake-like texture, with a sweet banana flavor and gently crunchy walnuts. It had a crisp, chewy, perfectly golden browned crust.  I put plastic wrap over the hot loaf after taking it out of the oven and let it cool for a while to keep it from drying out much.  Rave reviews from all tasters!  

My second loaf, I followed the recipe except added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and some cinnamon and vanilla.  It was good, but I think I prefer it without chocolate chips...  For easy mixing, I put all my dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl and "sift" them together by running my electric mixer through it for a minute or so, then separately mix my wet ingredients (butter, eggs, and banana) together before mixing into the flour/sugar mix, then fold in the nuts and/or choc.

There seem to be a lot of complaints about this bread being dry .   I always cream butter and sugar very well, add eggs one at a time and the very ripe bananas alternately with flour, but do not overmix.   Has never been dry and my only concusion is that others may have overbaked it.

This recipe was easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I did add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients.  Next time, I might try to use melted butter for ease of mixing.  This time, I creamed the butter and added the eggs, banana and vanilla and mixed together. Then I added the wet ingredients to the dry.  I found it a bit too dry, so I added a little milk (by eye and feel--maybe 2-3 tablespoons) and it worked out perfectly.  I also used my new silicone loaf pan for the first time and I loved it!  It baked so evenly and popped right out of the pan!  You might want to try it :)  I liked it so much, I just ordered a silicone bundt pan :)

I made this banana bread according to the recipe (except I substituted chocolate chips for walnuts).  YUM!  It came out moist and delicious! I now want to buy over-ripened bananas just so I can make this again!

This was the 4th banana bread recipe I've tried within the last couple of weeks and I can finally stop! I was looking for a banana bread with a nice banana-y taste along with a light and moist texture and this is it!  I tweaked the recipe as the others suggested by adding 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/3 cup splenda and 1/3 cup brown sugar. It turned out perfect!

Excellent recipe! I added some vanilla and cinnamon for extra flavor. I also used about 1 1/2 c banana (2 lg bananas). It came out so well that I made another loaf the next day. My search for a great banana bread recipe stops here! It's a great basis recipe that you can add your own tastes to such as nutmeg and other spices or chocolate chips.

Delicious! Absolutely amazing!  I added a bit of cinnamon, allspice, and vanilla extract. I also sprinkled chocolate chips on the top!   I didn't need to bake an hour, only 40 minutes, so keep an eye on it!

I doubled the recipe but only used 3 cps flour.also added 1 c light cream,2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I will increase the bananas.  I loved the consistency and moistness.  Absolutely needs more bananas. Otherwise excellent!!!

Used some modifications from Shelle Belle, but instead of 1/2 cup of cream for added moisture, I used whole milk. Also used a blend of chunky goodness including 1/4 cup chopped almonds, 1/4 cup flax seed meal, and 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Took 55 minutes to bake.

I was looking for a mango bread recipe for my two ripe mangos. While looking at the banana bread recipes, I figured out I could substitude the mashed bananas for cubed mangos. It was a success! There were a few changes I did to the recipe to make it more diet friendly. First, I used 2/3 cup of eggbeaters, 2/3 cup of Splenda, 1 & 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. The two ripe mangos yielded exactly 2 cups. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and after baking it for 50 minutes the results were tasty and moist. Surprisingly, the mangos did not sink to the bottom of the bread after it was baked. I will continue to use this recipe for mango bread and banana bread. Next time I will substitude some soy flour for the whole wheat flour and add some flax seed powder.

This is now my favorite banana bread recipe.  It's so light and fluffy!!  I followed the suggestions of other people by adding cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  I used 3 bananas instead of 2 - I always like 3 better.  I also added 1/2 c. of buttermilk instead of cream (I was out).  It turned out fantastic.!  I may add some brown sugar next time.  It's not quite as sweet as I like but still super.

Excellent recipe. Thanks to other suggestions, I did add vanilla and milk instead of half cream. Although I also topped with crumb strusel topping from another recipe. You must do this. It will hide any long big crack in the middle of the bread and it taste great too. Recipe for topping is combine 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup flour, 1 tsp cinnamon. Cut in 1Tb butter. Sprinkle this crumb topping on top of bread batter. You can also sprinkle few chocolate chips on top of crumb. Bake bread as directed.

This bread is pretty good! It's so simple and so tasty. Smells fantastic, too. A great bread to whip up when I don't eat all my bananas in time!

I was just looking for a regular recipe for banana bread, since I didn't have any fancy ingredients on hand.  I got what I was looking for with this recipe.  Regular banana bread and it turned out really good and moist!

This recipe was pretty good.  I put in less butter than called for.  Also added chocolate chips.  I prefer another recipe I have that substitutes applesauce or yogurt for oil/butter.

Ok, seriously "the Bomb" and I do not leave reviews EVER! This is the second time I made this now and I did add the pinch of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla the first time and it was good but needed more banana. Today I made it the same way using more banana and real butter! (I use a mixer to blend the liquids first, then mix it together with the flour mix) Result was fan freakin tastic! Will never need another banana bread recipe!

Oh my gosh! This is so good! I'm giving it four stars though because I did add a little extra. To keep it moist, it definitely needs more bananas. I added 1 3/4 cups of bananas instead and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon for a little spice. Turned out great!

Just made this recipe and it is so moist. I took some other reveiwers advice and added vanilla, cinnamon and Nutmeg and used 3 bananas. I also added about 1/4 C of milk. I put a brown sugar streusel on top with walnuts and this is fabulous. My husband & I have already devoured half of it. This is by far the best Banana bread I have tasted.

Dont be scared when its about 30 mins along in the oven and it looks like a brick...it will come around!  This bread was enjoyed without nuts by a whole class of graduating seniors.  It's so easy and i think what makes it different is the butter as opposed to the standard oil used in other banana breads!

If you add 1-2 Tablespoons of honey it sweetens up the bread a bit. If you use new Bananas, add the honey.

This recipe is identical to the one handed down in my family.  Just like the submitter, I have been making this recipe since I was a child.  My Mom always liked to serve it with cream cheese spread on it, but I prefer it without or even warmed up with a little butter on it.  Most people like this recipe, but I notice that among those that don't, a common theme of "too dry" and "flavorless" come up.  My guess is that you are not using ripe enough bananas.  This recipe should be made with over-ripe bananas that have fully black skins.  Over-ripe bananas are very flavorful, sweet, and wet.  This is my "go to" recipe when I have a few bananas that have gotten too ripe to eat as hand fruit.  I freeze peeled over-ripe bananas in a zipper bag until I have accumulated 3 and then I make this recipe.  If I don't have enough mash to make up a cup, I scale the recipe down.  I never substitute less ripe bananas, because the sugar and moisture content won't be right.

Delicious! I make this all the time for my coworkers and they love it. Sometimes I do chocolate chips instead of walnuts, but it is awesome both ways!! I also add some cinnamon and nutmeg.

Great bread.  The baking time was spot on for me because it produced a slightly crisp crust on the bread, but some others might want to check on the loaf 5 or 10 minutes early to avoid that!

I baked this as a thank you for a friend. I made only one change--I used whole wheat white flour. Instead of one loaf (because my loaf pans are packed), I was able to get 12 regular sized muffins out of this recipe. 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they baked up nicely. Simple banana bread which was just what I needed.

Yum... moist banana bread! This recipe is a keeper. Did add some chopped nuts and followed another review and split up the sugar to 1/3 c. white sugar and 1/3. c of brown sugar and added a couple sprinkles of cinnamon to batter.

This is the first time I baked a banana bread and it turned out great. I used this recipe as it had the basic ingredients that all bakers have without the nutmeg or shortening like other recipes. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and made it with 3 bananas instead of a cup of banana. Everybody loved it. Thank you.

Tasted great! I wasn't sure how it would turn out in my Breadman bread machine. I thought I would give it a try. I used BatterBread setting 1pd loaf. I put ingredients in pan in listed order. It mixed everything for you and baked for about 1hr 10 min. It came out perfect. Family loved it and I will make it again.

i givethis recipe a four because it was almost there!! i altered the recipe after reading some suggestions from other users: i added a 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and an extra banana. however, i think it could still use another banana. even with the extra bit, it still was lackluster in the banana area. but the smell coming from my oven during and after it baking is heavenly! and it did taste pretty yummy, too! ^w^

This was my third baking recipe since I've started cooking -- and it's a KEEPER. I followed other reviewers by adding a teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. It turned out beautifully and oh so good. As a rank beginner, I heartily recommend this to those who want a success to show off to family and friends.

Very good recipe! Good texture to the bread,not a heavy banana bread at all!
I put 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar,1 tsp vanilla,1/4 tsp cinnamon,and 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice just for a little bit of flavor and it worked perfect! Wonderful B/B! Family loves it!

I followed this recipe to a T, using a 9x5 pan and 3 small/medium bananas (they had black spots around, but not overripe). The bread came out rather bland, probably because of the bananas, but it also definitely needed some vanilla. I used a dark pan, greased with margarine and flour and baked it for exactly an hour, and it was slightly dry, overbaked and had a thick dark crust, so be sure to put it at 325*F if you're using dark pans and/or greasing with butter+flour.

Nice and moist.  I used extra banana and some cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg like some of you suggested.  It seemed just a little dry so I added 1/8 cup or so of buttermilk. Great recipe.  I will make this again.

Wonderful.  Wonderful.  So much better than store-bought banana bread.  The loaf always comes out fluffy and moist.  I added some more bananas and some vanilla.   It also worked great in my toaster oven.

I usually have to make banana bread from a box because mine will usually weigh more than I do and doesn't cook in the middle.  This recipe was easy and came out perfect my first time making it.  It's a keeper.

That doctor is one doctor I'd trust!!!
This recipe came out perfectly every time I've made it. I've been making it for my daughters since they were about 1 yr old (they are 18 months now) and they love it, so does my husband.
One time, I didn't have quite enough bananas so I added pureed canned peaches to make up the missing bit, it was very nice too. I've been making it without the nuts for the benefit of the little ones. I have also used a bit less sugar with perfect results.
This bread looks great when you take it out of the oven, nice and golden!
Highly recommended!

I loved this. So yummy. I also poured a little bit of sugar in the raw on top of it and it made a yummy crunchy crust. But that was just icing on the cake, so to speak! Oh, and I didn't have any walnuts.

Used 1/2 cup coconut flour and white wheat for the remaining.  Used three medium bananas (about 1 1/2 cups), the 1/2 cup heavy cream recommended by others, teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/3 cup Splenda and 1/3 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon with extra sprinkled on top before placing in the oven.  Only needed to cook in my oven for a little over 50 minutes.  Yummy elegant taste and texture.  Thanks for sharing!

I was really disappointed by this recipe. It was not moist enough.  I prefer a moist and dense banana bread.  This is not the recipe for that type of bread.  I did add 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg like some other reviewers.  I think those were great additions.  I wish I had also added the heavy cream that some others had mentioned also but unfortunately I didn't have any on hand.  I think I'll be going back to my old recipe.

I used this recipe and with a little help from other reviews modified it slightly. I have to say it was some pretty good stuff! I think the only thing is it needed a little more banana but I think that it's just depends on how much you like your banana bread to have that banana flavor. I used 1 1/2 cups of banana and added the 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1 tsp. each of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon and it came out pretty yummy. It's definintely something I would make again.

Super easy and yummy!  My 3 year old and I made this recipie this morning.  I took the advice from other reviewers and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, as well as 1/2 cup of milk (lowerfat version of half and half!) and it turned out great!  Next time I think I'll add grated zucchini in place of the milk as it usually moistens things up!

Really good!  I added a SMALL amount of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the mixture.  I also used bananas that were a little overripe, which makes the banana flavor a bit more intense.  YUM!

This was my first time to bake banana bread (ever).  It turned out fabulously...the addition of vanilla really made it special!

Do this nice recipe entirely in a food processor. Pulse the dry ingredients very briefly. Be sure to reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. and be sure to add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. You don't want to drown out the banana flavor, just enhance it. Combine the eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla, melted butter, cut-up bananas and 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts and add to dry ingredients. Pulse just a few times to combine. I found that 50 minutes in the oven is quite enough to produce a beautiful looking and tasty loaf.

Great recipe!  Easy to make and delicious!  This was my first banana bread and I was so pleased with how it turned out.  I omitted the walnuts (allergies) but added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.

my hubby and kids love this bread I do add extra bananas which is about 2 cups and a teaspoon of vanilla.

we love it with butter and warm it in the microwave and add cinnamon sugar.

this has helped me put weight on my husband who needs it to fight his cancer.

I really think he likes the lightness of the bread its easier to digest for him.

I make this bread twice a week since I've found this recipe two loaves at a time and can't seem to keep that cake holder filled.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe I have ever used!  Instead of 1 cup banana, I used 3 whole bananas.  I use 1/3c white and 1/3c brown sugars.  And I add 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2c cream as per other reviewers.  Very tasty!

I have made lots of banana bread, but this one takes the cake!  Somehow it has a fluffier texture and prettier crust than any I have made before.  THANK YOU Carol!

If you switch the 2/3 cups of sugar to 1/2 cup of Splenda you'll have an excellent sugar-free version. Absolutely delicious!

I followed this recipe to the letter (but then added a few shakes of cinnamon into the batter) and my whole family loved it!  It was super easy and my husband, who is a chef, was terribly impressed.

This bread turned out beautifully!  I was surprised at how good it looked.  I was, however, a bit disappionted when I tried it.  It was a good bread but not as dense or sweet as I like it.  I am very picky but my family and son especially liked it.  If you are looking for a lighter recipe, this may be exactly what you are looking for!

I made this bread last night - we just moved here and are living out of boxes, so I couldn't find my measuring spoons or my bread pan.  I guesstimated the amounts of baking powder, soda, and salt - and used an 8x8 pan as it was all I could find.  The bread turned out fabulous! (I baked it about 20 min. less than called for due to pan size).  It was incredibly easy - my 2 year old even helped.  I will definitely make this bread again and again - hate  to throw away those brown bananas!

I made a few modifications to make this recipe a bit moister and flavorful. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup (1/4 c white & 1/4 c brown sugar), Increased to 3 tsp baking powder. Added 1/2 cup pureed pears and 1/2 c sour cream. Spiced up with 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. For variance on the flour I split 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour and added 2 tbsp wheat germ. This bread turned out great!

I am a busy mom. So when the instructions told me to bake for an hour and check it with a toothpick I set the timer for an hour. When the timer went off the bread was burnt on the outside and hard and dry on the inside. I wasted time and ingredients. This may be a good recipe but I wouldn't know. I recommend only setting the timer for 40 minutes and then go from there.

Simple
Basic
Kind of boring
(I add cinnamon and vanilla and just use this recipe when I lack the ingredients to make my favorite banana bread recipe)
Hard to screw up though and nothing 'wrong' with it, its just nothing special

I used this as a base recipe and used what was available in the pantry as had some overripe bananas that I did not wish to waste ( isn't that what banana bread is for?) So I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup of w/w flour, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar, 4 small bananas and from reading other reviews, splashed in some half & half and added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and a combo of pecans and walnuts. This came out as I had hoped , sweet but not too sweet and fluffy ( I mixed with a hand blender over 2 min) and just moist enough, not wet and not dry/ crumbly. I will save and make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe as is and it was really good, I then tried the recipe adding 1/2 cup of heavy cream like suggested and I have to say this is better. The bread was moist and by far the best I have ever tasted. I get compliments from everybody. I can only make this banana bread when I have company around or I will eat the entire thing.

I made all the same modifications that the other reviewers suggested.  I hate waiting for the bananas to ripen so I roasted them in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes which turned the skins black and carmelized the bananas leaving them very sweet.  Yummy!

A couple of changes made this recipe Amazing! 1/3 cup of white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar.  Also, the butter, use half butter flavored crisco and half regular butter softened.  Add 1/2 cup of milk to recipe.  It is Very Moist when it is done!

This recipe made a tasty loaf with a nice crumb.  I mixed the ingredients differently -- mixing the sugar and butter first.  I then mixed the eggs, one at a time and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  I took turns sifting in the flour mixture with the bananas, mixing after each addition -- adding the nuts last.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a couple grates of nutmeg in the flour mixture.  The bread was done in only 45 minutes -- but I used a dark baking pan so that may have speeded things up slightly.  This was the perfect recipe for those two overripe bananas that were sitting on the counter.

EXCELLENT! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Very moist, very good flavor and is amazing warm with a bit of butter. 

It is one of our favorites!

Great texture and consistancy!  However, I added a little vanilla, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg for added flavor, plus a cup of applesauce and an extra 1/4 cup flour.  Baked exactly 1 hr at 350 and it came out perfect!

This was really good. This is not the traditional banana bread I am used to. It's not as moist but the crusty shell makes up for it.

I have been making this banana bread for years. It's a crowd favorite and I've even WON in a banana bread competition with this recipe. :) 
The only things I change are to add MORE banana, add chocolate chips and watch those baking times!

Great banana bread.  My husband and I both loved it.  It does have more of a cake like consistency than that of a bread.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks Carol.

I gave it 4 stars since I had to add extra ingredients (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, milk) recommended by others to add a bit more flavor to it and I also shortened the cooking time to 45-50mins so it didn't come out dry.

Have won the heart of my man with this cake - who managed to consume 4/5 of it within 2 hours! Ice with plain lemon icing for a tangy contrast. Thank you Carol for this gem, which has made many hungry mouths happy : )

This recipe was horrible.  It was flavorless, dry and not at all like typical banana bread.  Even hot out of the oven, the bread was dry.

I loved this bread.  However I did use some of the recipe change suggestions as well.  I used canned pumpkin instead of butter, I used about a tablespoon or so more sugar, and used cinnamon and nutmeg, just a tsp each.  I also used an extra bannana and egg whites only.  It turned out perfectly.  Great moist moist texture and plenty sweet.  My husband had no idea that it had no fat.

I wasn't impressed after the first loaf, but it had such a great rating that I made two more loaves just to be sure. Not enough banana flavor and just a hint of a baking soda after-taste. I'm going to try Banana Banana Bread next

This is a good basic banana bread recipe. With a few tweaks, I was able to make a great loaf. I used 3 whole bananas instead of the suggested 1 cup, and substituted brown sugar for half of the granulated sugar. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup millet, and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. Yum! It's moist, delicious the millet gives it a nice little crunch.

First off I read the reviews and don't know what ppl are talking about cream, I don't see cream in this recipe at all. 

This is by far the best banana bread I have made. It has become my #1 recipe! Moist but not heavy. Great flavor!

Good, not great. I took other reviewers' advice and added both vanilla and cinnamon. Without the cream, it's moist enough for me, so that wasn't the issue. I might throw in a half cup of brown sugar in with the white sugar suggested and perhaps another half tsp of cinnamon.

I'm not even a huge banana bread fan but this turned out great and my family LOVED it! I repeat: THEY LOVED IT! The whole loaf was gone after supper that night and my boyfriend went out and bought some more bananas a few days later for me to make this again! Thanks Carol!

I made this last night and because I was rushed, I decided to skip reading all the reviews and cut straight to the chase with DEVLYND's added tips.  I'm sure the original recipe is great, but this was by far the best banana bread I've ever made, and I've made quite a few trying different recipes.  This one's the keeper.  Thanks folks!

It came out awesome the first time when I made it 2 weeks ago. The family just loved it.  So I decided to make it again, however instead of a double batch I'm tripling it because it goes fast.

I come to this recipe again and again despite trying others....

This is a simple to follow, easy to bake recipe.  My only recommendation?  Use bananas that are 2 days or so away from YOU throwing them out.  They'll yield the sweetest and best banana bread.  You won't regret it.  :D

Any other ingredients you care to add to make it your own?  Go ahead.  I do love the simplicity of this recipe.  It just works--and in my home,  my kids ask for this recipe again and again!

I chopped up an 
apple into small chunks and stirred it into the prepared batter before putting it in the pan. I also added a half teaspoon of cinnamon. I will make it again, adding more apples. It was delicious!

This was the best banana bread I've made by far. I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the butter.And used 1/2 cup sugar as my bananas were real ripe. The moistest bread ever !

I made this for a pot luck and everybody raved about it!  It came out picture perfect for me.  I baked it for 52 minutes and it was not burnt at all nor were there any uncooked spots in the middle.  I don't like nuts in my bread so I didn't use them and everyone still loved it.  Thank you for sharing this!!!

I've made this banana bread several times but just got around to reviewing it. It always turns out great. I use 3 overripe bananas. I also add 1/2 cup chocolate chips. One of my favourite recipes!

This recipe was a great starting point for a wonderful loaf of banana bread. To add a little excitement to it, I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla. I also added a little more banana. I brought the loaf to work and it was gone in an instant!

I don't know what I'm looking for in a banana bread, but I didn't find it here. This is only an average loaf, so I'm still on the hunt. I won't make this again. But if you like a good, traditional banana bread, try this and you will probably be happy with it. It's just not what I was hoping for.

This is the best banana bread recipe ever!!  I usually don't eat anything sweet with a fat content of above 5 grams ubt when I tried this bread, I just had to get the recipe and make it myself!!  I added cinnamon and it really gave a nice aroma and additional taste to the bread!!  I also used egg whites instead of full eggs and I did not notice a difference!  Fantastic bread and I highly recommend this recipe!!

I tried out three banana bread recipes from this website (this one, Cathy's Banana Bread, and Banana Banana Bread) at the same time in order to compare them, and I liked this one the most.  It has a fluffy, cake-like texture with a nice crust.  If you're looking for something more dense, this might not be what you want, but for me, it was perfect.

This was the most delicious banana bread recipe that I've ever had!  I made it sometime ago in the fall but forgot to post a review.  Since the first time that I made it and because of all the raving reviews I received, I now make it every week!  This is a main staple on our kitchen counter for after work snacks now. The only thing that I do differently is add a little bit of cinnamon to the batter.  I've never seen banana bread so moist!

This is such a simple, great recipe.  I've made it three times now and it's turned out very moist and flavorful.  I've also added 2 oz. of shaved semi-sweet chocolate to the mix to give it a hint of chocolate as well.

It is not too sweet or dry or moist.

if this isn't the best banana bread in the entire world, i give up!  i think i've tried at least 10 banana bread recipes from family members, friends, cookbooks and websites...and this is, by far, the best!  of course, i had to add raisins and more walnuts :)

All the ingredients are ones you'd already have, and it comes out perfect each time. I made this for breakfast at work and several co-workers asked if they could take extra pieces home. (There were no leftovers, however!)

Great 'base' recipe!  It came out more moist than any banana bread recipe I have tried. With the addition of vanilla, cinnamon and allspice, it had the flavors that I associate with other great recipes I have tried. Made this bread to give away, but have to admit, I kept it for myself!

This is a great bread! I will certainly make it again. I added a littl extra banana as well as a little vanilla, and it was wonderful.

I don't know what happened when I made this.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After 45 minutes I decided to check it and it was burnt all around the sides and inside was dry.  The recipe says to keep it in the oven for an hour!

This is a GREAT recipe.  I added a "little" ground clove, ground allspice, ground ginger, and a "dash" of cinnamon.  WOW!!  My 5 and 7 yr. olds could make this and the turnout would be fantastic!!  Thanks for sharing this, from both me and my family.

This is possibly the best, easiest and most perfect banana bread I've ever made! Hard to mess this one up, great for experimenting.  I doubled the recipe, using whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup of water instead of 4 eggs (I had none at the time), and replaced 1/4 cup of the butter with olive oil. I love to experiment! Great as muffins (cooked for 20-25 minutes).

This was definatly the best banana bread I've ever had.  I added a light powdered surgar icing mixed with banana's and a little lemon juice.  That really topped it off, everybody LOVED it!!!!!
