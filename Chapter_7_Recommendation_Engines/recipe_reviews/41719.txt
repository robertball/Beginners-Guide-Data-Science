This pie, according to my husband, is awesome. The apples really do help smooth the texture. I didn't have any tapioca, so I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the berry/apple mixture. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pie. This is by far the best pie I have ever made!! Your berries should be naturally sweet or they can taste tart in the pie....still good. I add a little extra cinnamon and some vanilla.  It is perfect. Look forward to baking this many more times. ps....I also use the Best Ever Pie Crust, it is so easy and fast to make.  I use half butter half shortening for the dough and it is delicious!!

Excellent! After making a Blackberry pie, I had a couple of cups of berries left over and tried this recipe, it was way better than the blackberry-only pie-perfect texture and very delicious!!

I come from a family of blackberry pie fans!  Grew up picking them every year in anticipation of the great pies mom would make.  My son likes blackberry pies, but not all the seeds.  Many people feel the same way-if this describes you, then this is the perfect recipe.  You can hardly taste the apples, they just give a little extra texture.  We all loved this.  I made a few for the freezer too!

The description says it all!  The apple and blackberry flavors blend together well.  My regular blackberry pie is always too seedy; the apples help make the pie more smooth.  I will most likely make a few more pies to refreeze so I can enjoy the fresh taste of summer in the middle of a Chicago winter!  The only change I will make is to thicken up the juice; my pie turned out a little runnier than I like.  Great recipe!

Love this recipe. I chop the apple slices into thirds so the apple kind of gets lost in with the blackberries. Nice not to have as many seeds as traditional blackberry pie. I use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar just personal preference. I have been asked for the recipe by several friends so I'd say it's a hit!

This was really good & easy to make! I used raspberry instead and Granny apples. I didn't have tapioca, so after the fruits soaked in the sugar, then the leftover juice in the bowl was mixed with a little cornstarch powder to thicken. Will definitely be making this again.

The blackberries do dominate the flavor of this pie-- a good thing if you love blackberries.  Made this with Splenda Mix and you couldn't tell the difference.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make again.

YUM! An excellent combination - why haven't I heard of this before?  This was on the sweet side of pie, although both my apples and blackberries were very ripe... I think next time (there definitely will be next times!) I might cut it down a tablespoon or two; I think that would go better with ice cream :)  Thank you for the recipe!

Baked at 425 F on the bottom rack of the oven for exactly 23 minutes. The result was a golden, scrumptious pie. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

SO good!  This has been a hit every time I've made it - I prefer raspberries to blackberries, and I like the sweetness of Gala apples the best.  Also, I've never used tapioca so I just substituted flour as that's what I had around the house, and I think it turned out great!  Overall a fantastic pie and I've gotten so many compliments on it.  Mmm!

A little too tart for what I'm used to in an apple pie.  Next time I think I would try to use a sweeter berry, and probably one without seeds :)

I used a frozen store crust, frozen blackberries and fresh granny smith apples (only needed 2 big ones). I brushed some egg white on the top crust and sprinkled some sugar on top before baking. This pie looked like it came out of a magazine...and got rave reviews on taste too!

Mine came out super runny. Next time I'd lessen the sugar and possibly add more tapioca.

Very easy recipe!  I love how the apples tame down the blackberries so the pie isn't too tart.  This one was a hit with the mother-in-law, she even asked for the recipe! I didn't have tapioca so I just used 1 tbsp corn starch.  I wiped egg whites on the crust and sprinkled with sugar.  Great presentation!

Being a NEW baker, I made this pie and loved it.  I used a deep dish pie plate so the 2 cups of apples and berries is not nearly enough.  So I increased the amount of apples from 2 cups to 4 heaping cups and berries from 2 cups to 3 heaping cups which made it more full to my liking.  I increased the cooking time another 15+ minutes......could have gone a little more. I also increased the cinnamon and sugar some but not alot because the apples (Granny) and Berries give alot of flavor anyway. I took one persons advise of adding 1 tablespoon of Cornstarch.   I think next time I will try 2 tablespoons....especially because I use more apples and berries.   Great tasting though and will make again for sure......

Filling is delicious but very soupy (a surprise considering the tapioca). I'll make it again but will use a lattice style for top crust to try to dry it out.

This is one of the best pies I have ever made. The filling is not soggy, but a wonderful texture and perfect balance of sweet and tart.  The pie was even better the second day, and I will certainly make it again. I usually make recipes exactly as written the first time; because of a dairy allergy, I omitted the butter. The pie was fantastic without it.

Delicious!  I combined this with the Blackberry Cobbler II recipe without the tapioca to make a fantastic apple blackberry cobbler.  Used gluten free all purpose flour.  I am way too lazy to make gluten free pie crust from scratch so cobbler was perfect!

Wow!  This is one of the best fruit pies my family has tasted!  Three of us managed to eat 3/4th of the pie after a lasagna dinner.  The only problem is it is so delicious it is hard to stop!  I can't wait for a chilled slice as breakfast!  The only changes I made were doubling the cinnamon, adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and using 2 Tablespoons of tapioca.  I also used 3 1/2 cups of apples, as that was how much I had after slicing 2 apples in the food processor.  I am glad I added the extra fruit, as the filling barely filled the dish.  This has now tied for the title of favorite pie (Cranberry Apple Pie I from this site is the other winner).  I'll be making this regularly!

This pie is absolutely delicious!  I took this pie to the office and it disappeared quickly with compliments.  I used fresh blackberries that were frozen and Granny apples.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good!! I was curious about putting that many blackberries as all the seeds tend to be  a problem so I cut in half and for the extra I threw in some freshly cut strawberrys. I made and oatmeal struesel topping and I think thats what sealed the deal =) everyone loved it. Great recipe

This was very good.  I used a deep dish pie plate and wished I'd put more fruit in the filling.  Also, the recipe didn't specify what type of apples to use(baking, tart or other).  I used sweet eating apples, thinking the blackberries might be a little sour.  I think it might have a little more flavor that way.  I used 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

Wow! Not only did this pie TASTE delicious,. but it looked b-e-a-u-t-i-f--u-l-! I did change a couple of things though. Instead of "fresh blackberries" I added frozen blueberries, frozen raspberries and a package called "frozen mixed berries" including blackberries, raspberries, and a couple other berries. I used a pre-made crust from Mrs. Smith's. I came out flaky which was nice and I also did NOT add a top covering layer of dough. I also purposely smushed some of the berries and it added a nice smooth yet crunchy kind of texture. The apples were a nice touch.. I used 2 whole ones, not peeled instead of 2 cups, peeled, cored.

I used this recipe for the first pie I ever made and my family LOVED IT!  I used the called for amount of blackberries and maybe a little more than the 2 cups of apples.  I ended up using two Granny Smith apples and two Gala apples to add a little more sweetness to the pie, and I didn't have tapioca, so I used cornstarch instead.  I also used a few drops of lemon juice on my apples to keep them from browning up before they got to baking, and tossed in a pinch of nutmeg.  Since I don't believe in bothering with making my own crusts yet, I used the Pilsbury Pie Crusts from my grocery store's refridgerator section.  I can't believe how well this pie turned out!!!  It wasn't runny at all!  The only thing I'm changing for next time is a few more slices of apple.  SO YUMMY!!!

This recipe blends the apple and berry flavors wonderfully.  I did use an extra cup of blackberries as the filling looked like a small amount for a 9 inch pie. The recipe is a definite keeper!!

Turned out great! Substituted 1 1/2 tablespoons for the tapioca, added a pinch of nutmeg, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown, and used mulberries instead of blackberries... so I guess I ended up with a completely different pie than the recipe! But oh, it was soooo good... :D

Yum!  I wasn't sure about the apples and blackberries together, but there were so many great reviews, and I had blackberries frozen from last summer, so I decided to give it try.  WOW!  what a wonderful combination.  Only a few changes.  I added some lemon juice to the apples, and I used more like 3 cups of apples.  When I put it into the crust it still looked like it could use more filling.  Next time (and there will definately be a next time) I'll maybe add another cup of blackberries as well, and up the other inqr. accordingly. My husband LOVED it.

Exceptional!  Next time, I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup...1 cup sugar wasn't terribly sweet, but it could easily still be reduced.  Very good!!!

I used "what I had" and it was fantastic! I had a scant cup of blackberries, a handful of red raspberries, and then made up the difference with mac's, red delicious, and empire apples. It does need one more cup of fruit than it calls for to made it thicker. So in the end I used a total of 5 cups of fruit. Would never have thought this would be so delicious but I will definately make it again and again!My boyfriend wants me to try it with strawberries instead of raspberries sometime.

I used corn starch in place of the tapioca.  I also made a brown sugar pecan crumb topping instead of the double crust. It was awesome. Blackberry and Apple are amazing together.

I think this is the absolute bomb. The only thing I added is one teaspoon vanilla, and put a cobbler crust on top (plain cake mix with drizzeled butter. Awesome.

I am so thankful I pick blackberries and freeze them.  During the winter time it is nice to have some summertime pie. I didn't have apple so I used 4 cups of blackberries, delish! Next time I will cut back a bit on sugar, maybe 2/3c or 3/4c.  hanks for the recipe. This is pretty much a no fail recipe.

Magique, thank you for an excellent recipe! I make it as suggested but with corn starch instead of tapioca.  I also make the pie crust (french pastry pie crust) from this website in my kitchen aid mixer. The whole thing comes out very well, always. See photo

This was really good! I forgot to add the butter before baking it though (I guess it wasn't needed because it turned out great). I used a French Pastry Pie Crust from this site and lattice topped the pie. I didn't need to cover anything with tin-foil and it turned out great!

The flavor was top notch, so very lovely!  It was a nice change from the usual apple pie (which I super duper love anyway) but had a specialness about it.  Was very watery, though, and was better served with a spoon than a pie server - ha!  Will try to thicken it up a tad next time.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and loved it. But I left out the Tapioca...which would have thickened it and made it easier.  But everyone loved it.

The flavors in this pie are DELISH!  However, I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it still came out pretty runny... any suggestions? I definitely want to try this again.

Excellent pie recipe!  I am not very good at the whole pie making thing, but you couldn't tell from this recipe.  It is almost fool-proof. Loved the apples and blackberries together!  Will be making this pie again & again.

i wouldn't have thought to mix blackberries and apples but it was the best pie i've ever tasted! tip: crush the blackberries and add 2 tablespoons of brandy.

I didn't measure my berries or food processed apple pieces very well, or cinnamon, or exactly how long the mixture sat. :P Hopefully it'll still turn out well. O an used cornstarch instead. UPDATE:: Huuuuuge hit!!!!! everyone had two slices the night I made it but my mom who I had to save a slice for. Wow..gone in maybe five hours?!? Or less. Thanks so much, Magique!!!

Pretty good, but you can still taste the seeds. I used about 2.5 cups of each and it was the perfect amount. Other than that I followed exactly. Will make again.

I won't be makin a plain blackberry pie again!  Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe, put a top and bottom crust in a 13x9 pan and used frozen blackberries.  The blackberry and apple combination is excellent.  I took it to a family reunion and every last bite was devoured.  I sprinkled the top of the crust with a cinnamon/sugar mixture too.  Can't wait to make it with fresh blackberries.

Made 3 times varying ratio of apple to berries.  Great every time.  I used small tapioca first time and maybe didn't let it sit long enough but still good.  The large tapioca, let sit, and good to go.  I too had alot of juice so I added an extra shake of tapioca.  I used different pastry recipes and everything from pie pans to 9x13 with no problems and RAVE REVIEWS.

I used this recipe as is, except for the size.  I increased by 1.5 to make a 9X13" cobbler with it.  It was great, everyone loved it.  I fixed the fruit mixture the night before so I could bake it quickly in the morning.  It was very juicy, so I did add a sprinkle more of the tapioca, being afraid that sitting so long might cause it to be juicier.

Fantastic! A great tasting pie. I made some very minor modifications though. I used a little lemon juice on the apples to keep them from browning after cut. Instead of on 1 C sugar, I used 1 C Splenda and 1/2 C sugar and put in some cinnamon as well.  I actually forgot to add the butter pats before putting on the top crust- I don't care because it was still great!

To top off the pie I brushed the crust with water and sprinkled sugar atop the pie. I did cover the crust the first 20 min to reduce the browness of the edges.  The filling was nice and thick and juices weren't running everywhere when you cut a piece. Having the apples in the recipe definately reduced having all the blackberry seeds in one bite which was nice.

This is great! I did change some things, based on the reviews. I used one golden delicious and one honeycrisp apple. May use less apple next time.  Added an extra teaspoon of tapioca (5 total), 1 tsp cornstarch, and a tsp vanilla. I reduced the sugar by maybe a couple tablespoons. I used two cups blackberries and one cup blueberries actually, and the predominant flavor is the blackberry. I made a lattice crust with an egg wash and the edges did get a little overcooked, despite my attempts to cover with a shield thingie. Note to self: Don't forget the butter before adding the crust on top! and don't forget some foil in the bottom of oven to catch spills! Great recipe! Thanks so much!

This is the only pie I ever make any more. I LOVE the basic ingredients but in winter I add cranberries to give a bit more tartness. Otherwise a little lemon juice does the trick. I weave the crust on top so it's pretty. No guilt with this pie-I use half stevia and half sugar and I can't taste the difference. More cinnamon works too, I use about a tablespoon. It's in the oven now. Thanks for this!

This is a good start to a pie, but lacks flavor depending on the ripeness of your fruit. I first made this pie following the directions stated here, and it was undercooked (there was no pie jam), the juice was watery, and it lacked flavor.  I repeated this pie again and added: a splash of bourbon, more sugar, much more tapioca starch, vanilla to the filling (and let the filling stand a bit more than 20 minutes) and it came out wonderfully.  I also did an egg wash on the pie crust for a beautiful effect.

I love the idea behind the pie but it isn't quite right. I read the comments and took advice from other bakers and made some changes:

I did not have enough blackberries and read that many people thought that it was too tart. I lessened the blackberries by 1/2 cup and increased the apples by 1/2 cup. I did not think there was enough filling so I added another cup of apples. 

I did not have tapioca so I substituted cornstarch, using half the amount. 

I added an egg wash and sugar to my crust. 

Results: Very tasty, but I should have cut down on the sugar and added extra cinnamon.

I allowed the pie to cool completely and it was still juicier than I wanted. The pie was also thinner than I wanted it to be. 

The egg wash made my pie too brown in some spots, maybe I did this part wrong. 

Next time: I will add more apples! Definitely not enough filling for my taste. I  will also  try it without an egg wash.

This had an amazing flavor but unfortunately my pie fell apart and was very runny. I didn't have any tapioca so I used cornstarch but I guess I didn't use enough. Next time I may try adding flour.

Delicious.  Made this three times. The first was exactly to the recipe, the last two time without butter. I do not believe the butter makes a difference, and the consistency was better without.  This is now a family favorite

I enjoyed this pie, as did all of my guests. I used golden delicious apples, and forgot to peel them first. Luckily, this didn't ruin the pie one bit. I used sugar in the raw, and skipped the butter to make it vegan.

Just made this for the first time (of many). Added a half cup of frozen blueberries that were in the freezer as well. Crust was great. Even though the ingredients were all fresh, except for the blueberries, it was a little liquidy so I cut a piece and put in a paper towel to absorb the excess. Super easy. Family loved. Will make again and again.

This pie was eaten almost entirely by myself...I love the apple/blackberry combo. The tapioca is a nice touch and the pie gelled nicely together. This is a keeper.

This was my 2nd tapioca pie. The previous one was all blackberries and half the sugar and it set up better. This was still worlds less runny than most fruit pies and I appreciate the lack of pastiness that flour/cornstarch confer. Thanks for sharing!

Apple pies have always been my favorite, but I saw this interesting recipe and decided to make one. I tried it out on my children and a neighbor. They loved it so much that the cook didn't even get to have a sample! So, I can't describe the taste, but obviously everyone else that had a piece loved it. I guess I will have to make two, or three, or four....next time!!! Great recipe. Thanks.

This pie was amazing!! I used Philsbury pie crusts and cut the top crust into a lattice, brushed with egg white and sprinkled with sugar - it was so pretty. Followed another reviewer's advice and added a teaspoon of vanilla and extra cinnamon, pie was  absolutely delicious

Perfect!!  Added a few more apples (I used green apples) and used coconut sugar as a healthier sugar.  I was going to just use cornstarch as others did, but read up on the superior texture of tapioca and dug out tapioca flour.   This was a perfect pie.  I made a lattice top and baked at 375 for about 25 minutes, and then an additional 15-20 minutes at 325 until I saw the apples/berries bubbling.  This is how I knew it was done. I had to lightly foil my edges as they were browning too much.  Yum!  Thank you!

This is an amazing pie.  I made it with mulberries and apples and it was delicious.  Any kind of berries would do even if you mixe various berries together.  Made it twice in one week it was so good.  Great with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

I really enjoyed this. I made it with mixed frozen berries, and I had to bake it a little longer, but it turned out beautifully. The only thing I would change is that it was a little too sweet. Next time I will reduce the sugar by maybe 1/4 cup and see if that's the right balance of tart and sweet.

This recipe is perfect as written in my opinion. I used Fuji apples. My husband said it was my best pie yet, I agree.  This will be a holiday favorite from now on!

The first container of blackberries that I bought to use with this recipe ended up being eaten before they made it to the pie, however they were a little too tart for this pie anyway and the second batch I bought was perfectly sweet. I added the juice of half a lemon into the apple blackberry mixture, for which I used 2 small gala apples and one pink lady. This pie was heaven. Yum. Perfect. Will make again.

I didn't have tapioca so I used 2 1/2 Tbsp flour and 1 1/2 Tbsp corn starch. I also adjusted he sugar down, usually about 1/2 cup. I make this pie all the time now, changing up what berries I use, and my friends love love love it!

This turned out really yummy!  It tasted really good the second/third day when the apples had taken on the flavor of the blackberries.

SOOOO good I could have licked the plate. I made this just as the recipe calls for. However, I did add one more tsp of tapioca per other reviewers. It did not seem to help. It was really juicy turned out to be more like a cobbler than a pie. Even so it was REALLY good!!!!

This is an excellent pie!  My boyfriend went back for a second slice 10 minutes after the first so it must have been good!  I made it exactly as written.  I used Granny Smith apples and felt that the amount of sugar was just right.  If you use sweeter apples you might want to reduce it a bit.  I used the all butter pie crust at elise.com which is amazing.
