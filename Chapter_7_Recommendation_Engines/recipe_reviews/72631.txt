Very tasty, a whole family pleaser. I will do a few things differently next time though.  1.  Salt and pepper the chicken before grilling.  2.  Use less lettuce.  Unless they're very small, two heads are too much.  3.  Add another tomato.  My wife suggested using less barbeque sauce in the dressing, so you might try adding the bbq sauce to the dressing to taste.

Excellent!  I used a bag of lettuce to make things easier.  I also left off the Fried Onions to make it a little bit healthier.  Next time I will add some crunched up tortilla chips for some "crunch".  I also added some red onion and cheese.  I used fat free ranch dressing and I couldn't tell once it was mixed with the barbeque sauce.  This makes a great and easy lunch!

I got all thumbs up on this recipe from my family!!!  It was incredibly easy to throw together...I did add some garlic powder blend to the chicken prior to grilling to spice it up a bit.  I also crumbled up some tortilla chips and put them on the salad instead of using the fried canned onions...I served it with the Waikiki cornbread and everybody couldn't stop raving!!!

Great salad with a nice Southwestern flair - perfect for a weeknight meal! I rubbed my chicken breasts with a little "Taco Seasoning II" from this site and grilled them brushing them with a bit of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce right before they were done.  I used a mix of romaine and iceberg lettuce and added some shredded Mexican blend cheese. Instead of bottled ranch dressing I used "Ranch-Style Buttermilk" Dressing from this site and didn't mix and barbeque sauce in it. Overall, very tasty!

Even though the fried onions would have been tasty & added a nice texture, I left them out to reduce the calories.  I also omitted the cilantro due to family preference. The 2nd time I made this, I used 2/3 cup of ranch dressing & 1/3 cup barbeque sauce because my husband likes a milder taste.  It was still good but I also thought it was fine the 1st time I made it, with the dressing proportions as written.

I also added some avocado and it was a very easy, and great recipe. One thing is if you want to save extras for the next day keep the dressing on the side.

I had been looking for a recipe to replicate the BBQ Chicken Salad at Mimi's Cafe (a great chain restaurant) and this was pretty close.  I made it exactly as directed.  Next time I'll add jicama, like Mimi's does.  Thanks for the recipe, Amy!

I loved this salad.  It was a nice change from the usual.  I omitted the beans due to personal preference but made everything else the same.  I used a bag of salad instead of 2 heads of lettuce.  The fried onions are a great addition.  Note - the salad dressing mixture makes a large portion!  Thanks Amy!  Will definitely make again!

What a yummy salad!  I just used one bunch of green leaf lettuce and that was plenty.  I will probably add another tomato next time.  Half a bunch of cilantro was enough also, but definately don't leave it out - it adds great flavor!  I also used crushed tortilla chips on top.  It was excellent!

Just an update, avocado is very tasty.  Also, to save time you cab buy a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking your own.

This was a really awesome recipe. I served the salad in a sourdough bread bowl--salad and bread in one! We don't like tomatoes, so I omitted those, and used crushed tortilla chips instead of french fried onions. I had some leftover rotisserie chicken, which made this meal even easier. Thanks for a great summer recipe!

This was very good.  I seasoned the chicken with fajita seasoning, used Mexicorn and used salsa instead of BBQ sauce for the dressing.  Excellent!

Yummy! A great way to use up leftover BBQ chicken! 

I used tortillas chips instead of fried onions and it was delicious :) Next time I'll add only 1/4-1/3 cup of bbq sauce to the ranch as the bbq taste was a bit strong. 

Overall, a great light summer recipe! Thanks!

Great Salad!  I served this at a work lunch party and a co-worker said she couldn't quit thinking about it and had to make it for dinner that night she loved it so much!  I marinated the chicken breast in grill mates barbeque flavor marinade.  Then cooked them under the broiler for about 7 min. each side.  I didn't use the French fried onion rings, and I added another tomato.  I took others advice and used 2/3 c. Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and 1/3 c. homemade Ranch dressing.  This is one of those recipes that you will love forever!  Thanks Amy!!

This recipe was so wonderfully delicious!!!  I agree with the suggestion to decrease bbq sauce, I used appx 2 parts ranch to 1 part bbq.  Also omitted cilantro and ff onions.  Will definitely be making this again (and again and again...) might try crushed tortilla chips on top.  I'm passing this recipe on to other people.  It's so easy and yummy!  Thanks!

this salad is mediocre at best why would you put barbecue sauce and a salad I didn't like it at all the ingredients do not go well together with barbecue sauce and ranch.

This was great. I dont care for cilantro so i didnt use it. I added a sliced avacado to the salad as well. This was delicious and great salad for left over grilled chicken. This will be a staple.

Excellent!  It seems like a weird combination of things but is really good.  I made as per the recipe except for minor changes, using turkey tenderloin instead of chicken and adding some leftover bacon.  I will make this again!

Very easy and very tasty.  Replaced onions with pine nuts.  The family loved it.  Took it to a pot luck and it was a hit.  Also used tyson frozen chicken breast rather than grilling myself.  Call me lazy...

This is my all time favorite salad, at home and in the restaurant.  I do a few things a little different, but it doesn't change the recipe.  I don't mix the barbeque sauce and ranch, instead I just drizzle them over the salad.  I go easy on the cilantro, because the rest of the family isn't too fond of it.  Two heads of lettuce is usually too much, so I just use one head of romaine.  And the only big difference would be to use crushed tortilla chips, like the restaurant does.    This is one of my go to recipes in the summer!

I like this version of chicken salad, but I added some iceberg lettuce (for crunch), and instead of just plain chopped tomato, I used pico de gallo.

I REALLY changed this recipe, but it was such a great concept I couldn't pass it up. I wanted a BBQ Chicken salad for wraps, so I omitted the lettuce, tomato, and cilantro. I cut the chicken (3 breasts) into chunks, added an extra can of corn (huge corn fan) and mixed everything together in a bowl. WONDERFUL on a wrap. Thanks for the recipe!

SO GOOD and easy!  Very tasty!  My husband loved it the most.  I marinated the chicken in the bbq sauce for 30 mins before putting it on the grill.  I also reduced the number of beans and used chopped raw onions instead of french fried onions. I used grape tomatoes (and lots of them) instead of a chopped regular tomato.  And I mixed 1/3 blue cheese dressing that I had in the fridge with 2/3 bbq sauce for the dressing.  Fantastic!  Will do it again soon!

So good!!  Unless your lettuce heads are unusually microscopic, then one head of lettuce is more than enough. I use two cups of the best beans in the world (refried beans without the refry from this site, left unmashed) in place of canned beans (pulled from the freezer), frozen corn in place of canned (we just thaw it first), and bake my chicken when grilling isn't convenient.

Great recipe!  So simple to make.  Very filling and different salad.  The french fried onions add the perfect flavor and texture to this salad.

This was actually pretty good! Did 2/3 ranch, 1/3 bbq sauce. Left out the fried onions and didn't miss them!

OMG, I love this salad! When I make a salad for a meal it is usually more on the greek side..feta, balsamic, bread, etc. So this was a WONDERFUL change. My husband LOVED it too! 

I also added some red onion, chopped cucumber, red bell pepper, shredded cheese, and topped with crumbled tortilla chips instead of the onions. I too, as mentioned by other reviewers, tweaked the dressing. I used 1/4 c. ranch and 1/8 c. BBQ Sauce, as well as a Tbsp or two of Frank's Red Hot Sauce. We like a bit of heat. The dressing was fabulous and it made enough for 4 salads and I don't go very light with my dressing. 

Needless to say, this is going into my recipe box and will be made again and again. Thank you!

I used a tablespoon of dry taco seasoning (low salt version) mixed in with the Ranch dressing instead of the barbecue sauce. The whole family loved this dish. I will make it again.

Loved it!!!  Used crumbled tortilla chips instead of the french fried onions, and added a little red onion.  Used about half of the dressing, which was perfect for our family.  We will definetely do this again!

This was delicious! I used a frozen southwest blend of corn, black beans, peppers, and onion. I left out the french fried onions because we don't care for them. I only used half a bunch of cilantro and next time I will only use a quarter, it was a little too overpowering.

The chicken would have been boring and flavorless if I didn't use another recipe for just the chicken.  I loved the barbecue and ranch combo dressing which tasted great with the corn and black beans.  Overall, it was a flavored chicken breast away from being a 5 star recipe.

Loved this salad so delicious.  I think it was even better than the one they serve at Panera Bread.  The only difference I made was I added green onions too.

So good! I followed the recipe exactly except I left off the fried onions. My husband said he didn't care for the beans, but I thought they were fantastic. Next time, I will just leave them off of his salad and put them on mine. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

yum yum yum! i use half a head of red lettuce and half a head of green, and also add an avocado. instead of fried onions, i crush up tortilla chips. i usually let each person add his/her own dressing so that the salad keeps longer. i love it!

My husband and I absolutely loved this!  Reason for only 4 stars -- Like other reviewers, I adjusted the dressing to 3/4 c. of Ranch and 1/4 of BBQ.  This made the dressing super delicious.  Also, I felt the french's fried onions didn't sound like they would go with this dish well, so we crumpled tortilla chips over the salad instead.  We will definitely make this again!

This recipe was fantastic!  First I used 2 packages of grilled chicken that you can get in the deli area.  Also I did not use cilantro (personal preference) as well I did not mix the ranch and BBQ sauce I drizzled them both on top of each salad.  The second time I made this I mixed the the ranch &bbq sauce into the salad and nliked it better that way. Tasted like a salad that they used to serve at Mimi's Cafe.

Great recipe! Wonderful summer salad!!

I dont use the ff onion rings but instead buy flour tortillas from the store and spray them with pam and salt them and then stick them on a pan under the broiler for 5 minutes. Once lightly brown and crunchy looking I cut them with a pizza cutter into strips and place them on top of the salad. Very "professional" looking! Tastes great w/ out too much onion.

Totally awesome. I too love these salads from popular restaurants, but never attempted them at home.
As other reviewers mentioned, I cut the dressing, 2/3 cup ranch 1/3 cup BBQ. I left out the french fried onions and added red onion. Delicious!

I made this salad for myself and two other people and we all gobbled up an entire plate of it!  Soooo good.  I used the recipe for Absolutely Awesome Bbq Sauce from this site and it made a fabulous dressing.  I also basted the chicken in the bbq sauce before grilling for some extra flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love BBQ chicken salads and this was pretty good. I used shredded romaine and iceberg lettuce instead of red and green leaf.  I seasoned my chicken with EVOO and grill seasoning before grilling it. I forgot the black beans but I added jicama, green onions, and diced orange bell pepper.  I skipped the french fried onions and crumbled up some tortilla chips instead.  I also added some shredded pepperjack and sharp cheddar cheese. The cilantro is a must and makes a BBQ chicken salad in my opinion. I will be making this again!

Very good. I used Wishbone Just 2 good ranch dressing to cut down on fat & calories. I cooked the chicken breasts on the grill with garlic salt & pepper. It came out great. I used pita bread to make sandwiches out of the leftovers. I kep the dressing on the side so it wou;dn't make the salad soggy. I also didn't use the french fried onions becuase I don't like them and I didn't want the extra calories anyway.

Excellent salad! It definitely tasted like resturant quality! I added purple onion and shredded cheddar cheese. I also used leftover grilled BBQ chicken. I mixed one part BBQ sauce to 2 parts ranch as another reviewer suggested. It was perfect! Thanks for a nice summer salad. This is a keeper in my book!

I didn't have barbeque OR ranch dressing (I live in Belgium and they have never heard of either)... So I replaced the two with STEAK SAUCE and BERNAISE SAUCE... It was perfect! My husband had seconds!

For carb conscious cooks, use a good low carb BBQ sauce, and slightly reduce the ranch dressing in the mix. I use Paula Deen's BBQ sauce.  It's delish, and very low sugar. Chris and Pitts original is also low carb I think- I can't find it in the stores around me, but I used to use it.  For taco salad, use a mix of salsa or taco sauce and ranch dressing, and either grilled or rotisserie chicken, or ground beef cooked with Ortega medium hot taco sauce, shredded cheddar cheese, and sprinkle some crumbled tortilla chips in. I've also used Franks hot wing sauce and ranch dressing for a spicy Western dressing, (easy on the Franks!), something like the  Blooming Onion dressing.  You can add shredded cheddar cheese or pepper jack for flavor. Ranch dressing is so versatile, it accommodates so many different flavors!

Very good and very fast/easy to make. I marinated the chicken breasts with Grillmates, the Southwest flavor, and broiled the chicken for 5 minutes under the broiler. I used 2/3 ranch dressing and 1/3 bbq sauce. I added shredded cheese but will leave that out next time because I couldn't taste it. I used 2 tomatoes instead of 1 and 3 chicken breasts instead of 2. I used 1/2 a bag of spinach and 1/2 a bag of mixed lettuce. Next time I will use even less bbq sauce and I'll add yellow onion and bacon. I'm trying to eat leftovers for lunch right now and even though I didn't put the dressing on until now, the lettuce is quite soggy. I will definitely make this again. My boyfriend had 3 servings! :-) Perfect for a week night meal!

We cooked our chicken on the George Foreman & seasoned it with chili powder to give it the 'blackened' effect. LOVE this salad! Fantastic & will do it again. Great sauce too.

LOVED IT!  I did change things just a little: 1) used leftover shredded chicken from chicken tacos last night 2) subbed a red bell pepper for the tomato 3) warmed the black beans & corn on the stove 4) switched out red onion for the fried onions 5) added some shredded cheddar cheese & avocado.  Thanks for sharing such a versatile recipe!!!

Oh my, YUM! I made one teensy alteration to this recipe and that was to use prepackaged salad mixes. Otherwise, I made everything else exactly as instructed and I could not be happier and more satisfied! It was so good! It tasted almost exactly like the BBQ chopped chicken salads you find at Wood Ranch BBQ & Grill or at California Pizza Kitchen. I paired this salad with a slow cooker chicken tortilla soup (also found on this site) and with cornbread. You will not be disappointed! Thank you, AMYEH!

This is a great, quick meal I use when I haven't planned ahead.  I love it!  I tweak it a bit by adding a small can of corn and I cut the dressing and lettuce down.  I also use tortilla chips if I want some crunch but only because I always have them.  Overall, super recipe!

This salad tasted and looked like one I would get at a restaurant, so good!  The cilantro is and must and totally makes the entire salad.  My husband also loved it.  I used fat free ranch and he never knew!  Good job Amy!!!

Good salad, however I felt the BBQ sauce overpowered the ranch dressing even though I added quite a bit more ranch dressing to the mix.  It could have been the sauce I used (Kraft chipotle).  Next time I think I will start with 3/4 c. ranch to 1/4 cup BBQ sauce.  I will also probably add sliced avocado.  Loved the crispy onion strips!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yum!  This was a great salad.  I left out the cilantro and French fried onions.  I used 1/4 cup of ranch dressing and 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce and kept the same amount of other ingredients to serve 2 people.

This is absolutely delicious.  My entire family loves it, including my young children.  In fact, my 12 year old requested this as her upcoming birthday dinner!  With good plate presentation it rivals any restaurant.  And super easy!  You can't go wrong with this salad!

We have made this a few times and love it.  I use whatever lettuce we have on hand, usually romaine.  If we do not have cilantro on hand it is just as good.  We are making it again for dinner tonight.

YUMMY! This is delish!! The perfect addition to a barbeque or party, also nice for a healthy, light dinner. Two heads of lettuce is way too much though- I use a bag or two of bagged lettuce- whatever kind will do. Much easier too! This has so much flavor! Do make sure to grill the chicken though, it really adds a nice flavor. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic before grilling. The BBQ sauce/ ranch dressing is yummy too. This recipe is a keeper!

THis was a hit! I made a few changes: 1. seasoned chicken breast before putting on the grill. 2. brushed bbq sauce on the chicken during the last couple of minitues of grilling for extra flavor. 3. used broken up taco shells to add crunch

This is an awesome salad!  It was too cold to grill outside, so I just salted and peppered the chicken, pan fried it and shredded it into the salad.  I made this for a friend for lunch and we both loved it.

Great salad! I left out the cilantro since we didn't have it, seasoned the chicken w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder and chili powder before cooking and crumbled tortilla chips instead of the fried onions. Perfect for a light meal, and we will definitely make this again

Great salad - but made the following changes per other reviews and my own tastes:  Seasoned chicken with fajita seasoning prior to grilling.  Added sliced red and yellow peppers.  Used 3 parts Ranch dressing to one part BBQ sauce.  I fried corn tortilla strips in oil and used them as topper instead of the fried onions.

Definitely add jicama, if you can get it, for a sweet and juicy crunch. Cucumbers will suffice too. We used frozen corn instead of canned, not cooked and barely thawed.   For a long time I haven't been able to eat this salad, but now (summer '09) there's a yogurt-based Ranch dressing (in the produce refrigerated section) that allows my lactose intolerant stomach to digest this salad again! Thanks for reminding me!

This is an amazing salad!  I added some onion and peppers (red bell, yellow bell, jalapeno, & poblano) for an extra component but it's certainly not necessary.  I also tossed the entire salad with the dressing mixture, which I though made the salad!!

pretty good...I just feel like it needs some spice.  I initially did 1 part BBQ to 2 parts ranch as others suggested but I think that was the wrong decision.  I added more BBQ after so I think its perfect.  That being said, if you are concerned that you won't like that much BBQ, cut it down and you can always add later.  Think I'll add a little hot sauce to the dressing next time to give it some kick.

Excellent,restaurant quality salad. I mixed the cilantro, beans, corn and tomatoes in a bowl and served the leftovers as black bean salsa (added red onion,lime juice and course salt.  Very good and easy to throw together.

Very good - we don't like *too* strong a BBQ flavor so only added one heaping TBS  into homemade Ranch, then tossed in BBQ glazed chicken legs (de-boned - used legs as it was all we had). Added red pepper and sharp cheddar. If you can use fresh corn - makes a huge difference.

I would recommend marinating the chicken in additional ranch dressing and brushing with BBQ sauce near the end of grilling--that would give the chicken some flavor.  The rest of the recipe sounds great and definitely worth a try!  I like the idea of the BBQ-Ranch dressing.

I thought this was really good. I did not have the Cilantro or beans, but still came out great. The mixture of the BBQ sauce ( sweet baby rays) and Ranch was a nice combination. Definetly will make again.

Yum!I put crumbled tortilla chips on top because that's what I had on hand. I also marinated the chicken in BBQ sauce for two hours before cooking and was very happy with the results. Will definitely make this again, thanks!

I just had this last night. It's really yummy. I didn't have any french fried onions on hand so I cooked up some onion rings and put them on top of the salad. It was a perfect combination with a nice crunch.

I only used one head of lettuce and added chopped green onions and cheddar cheese. Also marinated the chicken with tequilla lime marinade as I can't stand bland chicken. Very good and filling!

The cilantro is the punch!  My husband and I made this as our date dinner/picnic, and our conversation kept coming back to how good this meal was.  The sauce is a good balance of creamy and punchy.  We used a sweet BBQ sauce, but I think a hickory sauce would be even more killer.

This had a great unique flavor. I would recommend doing at least 4 chicken breasts due to the amount of lettuce.

I don't understand the picture of this one, but the salad is delicious. I marinated boneless chicken tenders in bbq sauce, garlic & green onion before grilling. I wll go 2 parts ranch to 1 part bbq for the dressing next time. My husband LOVED it and asked to add it to the rotation.

This was a good salad.  I thought the barbeque flavor was a little strong at 50/50 with the ranch dressing.  Next time I would try 1/3 bbq, 2/3 ranch.  Otherwise, it was great.

I absolutely love this chicken salad! I love the tang of the Ranch and bbq mixed together---2 things I would have never put together had I not tried this recipe, but it works so well together! I also love the addition of corn to this. This is a wonderful chicken salad that is very unique and sure to please! I made this many times over the past summer using different variations of the ingred., but I always added the corn, ranch, bbq sauce, and of course, the chicken.

This is a great summer salad!  I omitted the fried onions and added a bit of red onion as well as red bell pepper, avocado and tortilla chips on top. I also added the veggies in with the lettuce individually for each serving so that the lettuce doesn't get droopy for leftovers the second day.  I served it with some crusty french bread and a nice bottle of white wine.  A great summer dinner!!

This salad was so delicous. I just changed a few things...I used pork (leftover from previous night dinner) instead of the chicken. I also added shredded carrots and purple cabbage to add a super crunchy element . I also used southwestern ranc by Wishbone instead of regular ranch dressing. Thanks to the recipe owner as this is now my new salad to replace a meal!!!

The salad itself is beautiful! The dressing  color is a little off putting to us and the taste was just ok. I followed the recipe except for subbing romaine lettuce. Neither my husband  or I finished our salad. I kept thinking lime juice would have been a better dressing. Everyone has their own taste. BBQ ranch dressing sounded so good to me but I learned I am not a fan. If you know you like it, go for it!

I've been using this recipe for a couple years now and it's always a winner. To spice the dressing up a bit I add some drippings from the can of black beans along with some water from a jar of Marzetti jalapeños, as well as some cracked black pepper. I go back and forth between grilled chicken and Tyson's breaded chicken strips. People lose their mind over this salad.

I loved it. So did hubby. Great with a glass of Sangria. I added a large chopped green onion and each person could plop a dolop of guac on the top if they liked. Served the dressing on the side for every one to drizzle over. Some people were leaving off the fried onions. I say try it once with them on as they really do lend ymminess.

Daaaang!!! This salad was so yummy, my fiance wants to have it for my wedding reception next month. I made it as written except used a prepackaged mixed lettuce. That dressing is PERFECT for this salad. Thank you so much Amy. It will make my special day a little more special.

The recipe doesn't give lettuce And cilantro measurements. I added waaaay too much cilantro but it was still GREAT! I did have a bit too much lettuce but my family gave it a 10! Next time I would add some avocado. I did add tortilla strips that they sell in the grocery store. Gave it that extra crunch. I will definitely make this again and I think it's the perfect salad to bring to a party!!!!!

This recipe was totally delicious! I am going to use this a lot during the warm summer months. I did make a couple of changes. First of all, I broiled the chicken (8 minutes on each side) instead of grilling and basted it with some barbecue sauce when it was almost done. It was less of a hassle. Then, I didn't use fried onions. Instead, I cut flour tortillas in strips and fried them in a small amount of hot oil for about a minute on each side. Then I drained them on paper towels. Yum! Third, I also cooked and crumbled up some bacon and that added so much flavor to the salad- but I am partial to bacon! Lastly, I added some other salad veggies to the salad- cut cucumber, grated or sliced carrots, sliced red pepper. Don't leave out the cilantro- that's the best part! Enjoy!

Tasty! My hubby grumbled a bit (he's not a fan of salads), but I really enjoyed this. :) I absolutely LOVE the idea of subbing French's fried onions for the tortilla strips found in the famous chain's salad! I scaled this in half to feed two HUNGRY adults, and to make this a little more authentic, I made a few changes. To start, I subbed Iceberg / Romaine lettuce (bagged mix), added some julienned jicama and a generous handful of shredded Monterey-Jack cheese and cut way back on the cilantro (maybe 3 T total). I seasoned my chicken with Montreal BBQ rub and had my hubby baste it with a little BBQ sauce while he grilled it. When it was time to eat, I plated my salad a little differently (again, to mimic CPK's salad). I tossed my lettuce, beans, corn, jicama, cheese and a little dressing together (just enough dressing to lightly coat everything), then plated it. I surrounded each salad with chopped tomato and avocado and garnished with fried onions and chicken. I finished it all of with a drizzle of BBQ sauce and leftover dressing. To change things up next time, I think I'll sub tortilla strips for the fried onions and just add a chopped green onion to my salad. All in all, this rocked my taste buds and totally satisfied my craving. Thanks for sharing your recipe, AMYEH! This was PHENOMENOL!!! :-)

What a great summer night dinner. The chicken I marinated in Italian dressing, Teriyaki and Italian spices for a few hours, then we coated it with BBQ sauce while grilling. We went ahead and grilled the corn and cut it off the cob for the salad (super sweet Georgia corn). I only mixed two tablespoons BBQ sauce to one cup and half homemade ranch dressing, (Ranch Dressing II - on this site), it was just enough to give it a bit of tang, but not overpower the great ranch taste. The crunchy onions were a great topper and we all loved this salad...great combo of flavors.

Loved this delicious entree salad, so did my guests.  I used a rotisserie chicken, red, orange, and yellow tomatoes, and added diced green & red pepper, avocado, and shredded cheese.  I offered the fried onions and colorful tortilla strips on the side.  I made the dressing with lite ranch, no one was the wiser!  Colorful, festive salad for casual summer entertaining, loved this, Amy.

This is a wonderful salad! Made it for a gathering and provided several dressing choices, so I probably didn't stay true to the "barbecue" salad, but everyone loved it, no matter what dressing they chose! I did rub the chicken with salt, pepper, and olive oil before grilling. This will be a weekly salad at my house!

I loved the dressing, such a nice way to not use so much ranch and save fat and calories. I've used the dressing a few times now even on other salads. Thanks for sharing

My family loved it. I accidentally thawed out some ground chicken, so I cooked that up in my favorite cast iron pan with a combination of homemade taco seasoning & our favorite BBQ sauce. It was a hit and has been requested again soon!

Yum...great salad. Make as many changes as you like and it will still be awesome. I don't like cilantro so I used parsley instead. I scaled the amounts as well (we didn't need two whole heads of lettuce or quite as much dressing). Used a rotisserie chicken among other substitutions. Everyone liked this - even my 6 year old. Give it a try!

Yummy!  I used left over grilled chicken breast and served mine more as a chopped salad.  Added a handful of bacon bits, a handful of red onion and some tortilla strips.  This made a lot of dressing for my family so I suggest tossing as needed instead of adding it all.  Yummy!  So light and refreshing.  Thanks for a GREAT, EASY, REFRESHING recipe!

My hubby adored this. The only problem I had was that the cilantro was WAY too much. I only used half of the bunch. Maybe my store gets bigger bunches? Not sure, but the next time I'll add just a little and then put additional cilantro on the side so each can add according to their tastes.

I normally make a greek salad so this was a nice contrast.  I loved all the ingredients, including one recommendation to add onion and cheese.  The bbq should be added to taste. I cooked some frozen vegetables (corn and black bean), drained it, and it worked perfectly.  My husband loved it.

This recipe was delicious!  I ended up tossing about 1/2 of the dressing with the salad to lightly coat it and then added the rest on the side as a dipping sauce.  Before cooking the chicken I coated it in a light amount of chili, garlic and black pepper, just enough to give it some flavor and blackened the chicken.  I also used frozen corn (that I let thaw a little).  This recipe is definitely worth trying!!  I used low-fat ranch dressing and it was terrific!

Really great salad! I gave it four stars because I substituted my own dressing (about 3 Tbsn olive oil, 1 clove garlic, 1 jalapeno, about 2 Tbsn lime juice, salt and pepper to taste - puree) and I marinated the chicken (Jenny's Grilled Chicken Breasts from this site). The combo of the black beans, corn and french fried onions is perfect!!~UPDATE~ Made again using Ranch Dressing II and Marinade for Chicken. Added avocado. A combination of flavors that allows for lots of variety!

I was trying to imitate a salad I had in a restaurant as well and this we so very close.  I used a rotisserie chicken for convenience and it was an easy summer lunch for after church.  The restaurant version had jicama added and I was unable to find it at the store, but it adds a little extra crunch.  I hope to use that next time.

This was a delicious cold summer dinner!  I added chopped red pepper and a hard-boiled egg, used frozen corn, and omitted the cilantro (we don't like it).  I also used light Ranch and couldn't tell at all!  Next time I'll try fat-free to cut back on fat even more.  We used crushed tortilla chips in lieu of the french fried onions.  I mixed up a quick southwestern seasoning blend I found online and seasoned the chicken with that before grilling.  Yum!  We will use this one a lot this summer!

This salad was delish...gave it 4 for just a few variations (I think).  I used mostly spinach with a little fresh romaine mixed in, mixed up the black beans, corn and cilantro before putting on the salad.  I also seasoned the chicken and used barbecue sauce before cooking the chicken instead of dipping on the side.  Added sliced avocado and red onion, used salsa as a dressing and a dollup of low fat sour cream...the leftovers are even better!

This was an AWESOME recipe!! I didn't have any cilantro on hand, so I can't wait to try it with. I also added some smoky cheddar cheese chunks and it was DELICIOUS! The blend of the bbq sauce and ranch dressing was so tasty.My entire family raved about it, including my super picky 3 yr. old!! This will definitely be a part of our meal rotation. Thanks for sharing!

*** Great recipe - loved by even my picky eater.  When everyone had finished except my son, I asked him how he liked it.  He said, pretty good but it is missing something.  And as we tried to figure out what it needed, we hit on the French Fried onions.  Ugh - I had forgotten them.  He got a few on his last couple of bites and declared it was just right with that bit of crunch.  Definitely will be adding to my staples - it was so quick too.

I forgot the recipe st the store and I bought Thousand island dressing by mistake. Tried it anyway but used just about a tablespoon of the Barbeque sauce.  Since I don't like French dressing anyway. I thought it was very good and so did my family.

Altered the salad choices but LOVED the dressing, My family usually hates ranch but ate this dressing and regularly asks me to make more.  Thanks

I seasoned up the chicken with olive oil, garlic powder and salt and pepper. I also mixed all the "salsa" ingredients together with salt and pepper and served it on top of a bag lettuce mix. I used canned petite cut tomatoes since they were not in season. Really yummy. The salad is gone but I have extra salsa left over to munch with chips!

Left off the onions, added black olives and adjusted the dressing to 1/3 Baby Ray's and 2/3 Hidden Valley... Yum, yum, yum.

Fantastic!  I bought tortilla strips and used them instead of the french fried onions.  I also made the ranch with the dressing mix, skim milk and fat free mayo to make it lower in fat.  One of our absolute favorite recipes!

Simple and delicious!  Just what I like in a recipe!  We left off the french onion crunchy things to keep it healthier.  Be sure to add FRESH parsely, it made a huge difference.

This was a great summer salad!  I only used one head of lettuce and this made four servings.  I did use other reviewers suggestions of using 1/3 BBQ sauce and 2/3 ranch.  I may cut back on the cilantro or not even add it next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I absolutely would.  This salad is awesome!  I made it exactly as directed but just used romaine lettuce and added 1/3 cup barbecue sauce and and 2/3 cup ranch.  I used the french onions and liked them, but I'll probably experiment with red onions and other things instead.  I liked that extra crunch but want to keep the salad on the healthy side.  I used Fat Free Ranch which I don't usually like, but it still tasted great in the recipe. I am picky about recipes that I decide to make again and this is totally going into the rotation.  Thanks so much for such a great salad recipe!

We didn't do the proportions as described in the directions, and we left out the French onions because we don't like them. But it was awesome! We put it in tortillas as a wrap, and we're definitely doing this one again!

Really good salad! I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 2/3 C of ranch dressing & 1/3 C of BBQ sauce. I also added jicama. I think adding the french fried onion rings make it so much better! And Trader Joe's has the best!

Great version of a Southwestern Salad! The dressing sounded iffy, but my husband really loved it. It was a little thick for my taste, I'll thin it next time. I didn't have any corn, so substituted red onion at the last minute. Used a regular head of iceberg since that's what I had. Didn't top with onions or chips to keep it healthier. My husband really loved it!

Fabulous.  I made this 3 times last month, until I got sick of the repetition.  And as I sit here, I wish I had some in front of me! I do like to thin the dressing with water - the combo of bbq sauce and ranch dressing is rather thick.

Every member of my family loved this (8, 5 and 4 yr old and my hubby).  It was easy, light, fast and really good...and filling.  I served it with homemade corn bread.  The only changes I made were to eliminate cilantro and add chopped red bell pepper.  I also used Foster Farms grilled chicken pieces from the deli section (I didn't have any chicken defrosted.)  I didn't use the dressing to toss the salad, only because I knew my kids would prefer a different dressing, so I served them, then tossed the salad for the adults.  Really good!

This salad is amazing...I crave it!  The only thing I leave out is the cilanto as we don't care for it.  My husband said this was restaurant food!  The dressing is sooo good, it sounds strange but don't let it fool you.  Use a good quality Ranch and a good BBQ sauce.  I'm all for generics, but in this case, I think brand name makes a difference.

This salad tasted decent, but the dressing was a weird pink color. If I make it again, I think I'll just drizzle the ranch over the salad, then a little bit of barbecue sauce.

I loved this but would recommend doubling the dressing, so you can really taste it.  Who knew that ranch and bbq sauce would make such a good dressing?  This will be a repeat on the grocery list for sure!

Very Good. The dressing could use a little more spice to it, like chili powder or pepper or something. But I have to say that the  bowl was empty at then end. I did not use the fried onions, I just grilled red onions and put them on and also marinades the chicken breast in bbq sauce.

Delicious combination of vegetables with a refreshing taste of salad dressing. I love the ranch/barbecue sauce combo and plan to use it for other recipes. If you need to speed things up, you can use the precooked chicken strips (I think it's Pepperidge Farm that makes them).

This is a great recipe and tastes just like the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad that they serve at California Pizza Kitchen.  It was really good.  I can imagine this tasting really wonderful on a hot summer day with a good beer.

This was an awesome salad we didn't add the french onions or tomatoes; it was still great! We did add chopped celery which gave it a nice crunch and grilled red pepper. YUMO!

Very good.  Skipped the fried onions.  Also skipped the cilantro (my store was out.)  Loved the easy dressing.  Kept the dressing seperate because this makes a ton and would be soggy as left overs with the dressing mixed in.

I've been making a similar salad after I had it at a restaurant as well. I've never seen the french fried onions before, great addition! I like to add shredded pepperjack cheese to my salad, and have found that defrosted frozen corn works well too.

This is excellent!  I didn't change anything.  it makes a lot, though, and leftovers don't work, so make it for a big group; they'll love it.

This was simple and tasty. I marinated the chicken with a barbecue sauce, and that helped add even more flavor. We aren’t huge cilantro fans, so I would omit that next time, as it was a really strong flavor.

Oh my, how good.  The star of the show is the dressing!  I used Jack Daniels barbeque sauce and Bolthouse yogurt based cucumber ranch dressing. 
Because of "diet stuff" I made many changes: microwaving the chicken, leaving out cilantro, corn, beans,and onions.  I used a bagged salad mix as a timesaver.  To the greens and cut up chicken breast, I added a whole avocado and lots of tomato.  What a great dinner!  Although not very southwestern anymore.

I've made this a few times.  It's an easy dinner for a hot night.  I use chili beans instead of black and add avocado, cheese and onion for additional flavor.

I was skeptical about the flavor by mixing ranch and BBQ sauce, but, it was delicious! I used Sweet Baby Ray’s and it was perfect! I added cucumbers to the salad for a little extra crunch.

This was very good. I had to leave out the onions because my hubby can't eat them and I added sliced avocado. I think I'll try it next time with slightly less BBQ sauce.

Like everyone else, I made slight modifications. Seasoned chicken with barbecue dry rub.    Baked instead of grilled. Red onions versus fried. Added shredded cheese, crushed tortilla chips. My daughter loved it. Definitely a repeat!!

I made this particular recipe because it referred to a salad made by a restaurant. I thought this came really close to that recipe. The only changes I made was to add cucumber and jicama to the salad. I just had some on hand that needed to be used. Good recipe and I will make this again.

FRESH GOOD So refreshing on a hot summer night.
I rubbed chicken with Taco Seasoning and  grilled. I used all
that was listed and added mushroom and a few peas.
I was really concerned about the Ranch and BarBQ sauce
but wanted to try it. It was just fine. Served with grilled zucchini, and really enjoyed dinner.

Yum! . I had leftover BBQ chicken & I seen this recipe advertised & it was perfect to make! I forgot the black beans &  I think it would be the topper to this yummy dish! The fresh cilantro adds a great flavor! I will make this again soon with the beans!   :)

Delicious, full-meal dinner salad.  I made as written, but added avocado and cucumber because there was a half of each in the refrigerator that I wanted to use up.  The dressing is one of our favorites.  A popular restaurant makes this dressing for a Wildfire Chicken Salad, and the dressing recipe for this recipe was spot on.  As the weather gets nicer, our eating habits change and this salad will be a wonderful addition for a lighter summer dinner.  Thanks, AMYEH for sharing.

Not a huge salad person but I enjoyed this very much. I'll admit that I seasoned the chicken some before grilling. I had a little bit of blackening mix (paprika, cayenne, cumin, chili powder, etc.) leftover from some catfish I did earlier in the summer that needed used and it gave it an extra kick. This salad reminded me of the Southwest one from Mc Donalds but only better. In fact, if you subbed Doritos for the french fried onions it would be pretty close. This would go nicely with a tortilla soup and one I will definitely make again. Thanks Amy!

Let's just say I need all the help I can get!  This was a yummy recipe and very, very easy.  

Added some BBQ sauce while chicken was on the grill.

Next time, I may grill corn on the cob and use that just to make it a little more fresh.

Very yummy! I did make a few changes based on other reviews though. Instead of using heads of lettuce, I used 1 small container of organic mixed greens and then scaled back the rest of the ingredients to 1/2 cans of corn and beans. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts (what I had on hand) and rubbed them with taco seasoning before I grilled them on an indoor grill pan. I added green onions, shredded cheese and black olives just for personal preference as well. For the dressing, I mixed 3/4 cup ranch and 1/4 cup bbq sauce and it was PERFECT! Delish :)

Great simple recipe!  I cube the chicken first and then cook it adding some taco seasoning and letting the chicken simmer for 10 min. I use crunched up tortilla chips instead of the fried onions, and I also add avacodo. My entire family loves this!

I didn't like this at all. I must have done something wrong. It even looked unappealing since the dressing was brown.

Excellent recipe for a hot day! The chicken can be grilled outside while the house stays cool!

This is very good.  I used BBQ chicken breasts from the day before and low-cal ranch.  It was delicious - the cilantro really adds a nice kick. Flavorful and filling!

Wow - really good.  I marinated the chicken in Ken's Caesar Dressing for about 4 hours before grilling, discard the extra marinade.  I also substitued tortilla chips for the fried onions and left out the cilantro (don't like it).  Honey Barbeque sauce makes it a bit sweet, yum.

Good salad. I forgot cilantro and did nt have french onions, but it was still tasty. As others suggested I redused bbq sauce to half. Yummy. We will make again.

awesome recipe and so easy.  instead of the high calorie french fried onions, i thinly sliced an onion and grilled it.  much healthier and added a great flavor!

Loved this recipe. Pretty easy to make. Marinated the chicken in BBQ sauce for about an hour then put in on the Foreman grill. This tasts just as good as a restauraunt.

This salad was fabulous!! My husband and kids loved it too. I thawed out frozen corn instead of using canned corn. but kept everything else the same. Will make this again for sure!!!
