I loved this! I used Truvia instead of sugar and skim milk, which turned this into a Caramel Frappuccino Light. My newest addiction!

I honestly don't know how anyone used this exact recipe and got a "perfect" frapp.  Mine was a frothy Carmel milk.ff.

This was excellent and taste as close to Starbucks as you will get.  To make the perfect strong coffee for this drink use 2/3cup of your favorite ground coffee and 2 cups of water and brew it once and then run it through the machine again using the same coffee grounds.  You will end up with just over one cup of coffee.  Cool in the fridge or freezer before using. For those who prefer a creamer drink use half and half in place of the milk.  No need to stop at Starbucks I will be trying different flavor variations using this base recipe as a guide from now on.

This recipe is amazing!  Tasted identical to the original.  The second time we made them my daughter and I did a half caramel, half chocolate syrup mix for a mocha caramel Frappacino, also wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.  DD gives it 10 stars!!  I love the money I'm saving as I let her make these as a treat before an out-n-about adventure.  (She's 11)

The recipe was good but not my favorite. It tasted a tad watery with all the ice, coffee, and low fat milk. I have an espresso machine but opted to try the recipe as written. Coffee places don't use large amounts of regular coffee to make these drinks. If you don't have an espresso machine I would suggest buying instant espresso or brewing ales set amount (1/4 cup) of strong coffee instead.

I ended up using a ton more syrup, but then again when i go to starbucks i have the smallest scoop of ice that there is so mine drink usually tastes more caramely. 

this tastes seriously like a starbucks frappuchuno. I used Hersheys caramel syrup then added whipped cream on top. 

I' am over all super happy. Though I made a bit too much now i have a TON lol

Loved this recipe! We are over an hour away from the nearest Starbucks, between gas and the cost of the drinks themselves, its a rare splurge for me to get one. This is my absolute favorite there and this recipe is pretty darn close. I've been tweaking the amounts in it (I like mine a little stronger than this) but still 5 stars in my book. I do omit the topping, the drink is good enough for me :)

Yum! Made for my guests and they loved it. I did add a scoop of ice cream for extra creaminess....but it's excellent too without it.  I used Hershey's Classic caramel Sundae syrup.

I just tried this recipe I made almost everything as directed. I did not put a whole cup of coffee because I didn't have enough ice in the fridge. I used 1/2 cup brewed coffee and if you do have enough ice use 3/4 of a cup try cooling the coffee off a bit with a cube or two while you are placing the other ingredients in the blender. I also used my 1/3 cup homemade salted caramel I made a few days ago in the recipe. I blended altogether but before i poured it into my glass i poured some caramel down inside the sides of my glass then poured the blender mix inside. DELICIOUS

This was AMAZING!!!!!!!! I have to admit I was a little scared at first to try it, because I mean, I have been trying to find a recipe of a copy-cat Starbucks Caramel Frap and all the other ones were nasty. LOL , but, no needed to pay $4.90 on a frappe, when I can make a better one at home! :) I used Whole Milk, and instead of regular coffee, I used the Starbucks caramel flavored roast I also put some Vanilla Ice Cream in it to make it a little creamier! But, this is definitely a 5 star rate! Thank you!!!!!!! :)

OMG!  I'm in love!!!  I did make a few modifications.  Made strong coffee and added 1t of instant espresso. Added only a small amt of milk so the coffee was still dark. Since I used 1% milk, I added 2t of coffeemate.  Used 2t of splenda and 1/4 cup of caramel sauce.  Voila, perfect!  Sweet enough and icy and am making another one tomorrow!  Going to try sugar free caramel sauce!

Very good! Ended up making this for me and my sister when we were really craving Starbucks frappes! I had to add a little more ice to satisfy me though. I did not have caramel sauce, so I upped the sugar and it was perfect! It is also yummy to add 3/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup hazelnut coffee creamer, or any coffee creamer instead of 1 cup of milk! 5 star recipe!

PERFECT!!!!! I only make 3 eight-ounce cups (1 1/2 of the recipe), but always add a extra half cup of ice and fill a normal measuring cup to full (2 cups) (which helps with the milky-ness) and use instant coffee powder (1 1/2 tbs) with 3/4 a cup of water and mix and microwave it for 1 minute and freeze it for when I want to make the frappe along with the water in the measuring cup. When i'm ready to make it I put all the ingredients (which are adjusted) in the blender (besides the coffee and ice and microwave the coffee for 1 minute which melts it just enough for the coffee to melt but have a little iced coffee left.) After that, I take the ice out of the measuring cup and use a hard metal kitchen utensil (used for cooking) and break it on a tray and put the coffee and ice in the blender and use the crush ice and liquify options until the frappe is perfect and top it off with whipped cream and extra caramel! :) Hope this helps.

                              

EDIT: To defrost after putting leftovers in the freezer (make sure that the leftovers are in a cup, not glass) microwave the frappe 30 seconds and take a fork and scoop out the amount you wanna drink in a glass and add 2 tbs to 1/4 cup milk and mix it with the fork and add 1 1/2 tsp caramel and mix and top it off with the whipped cream and caramel and enjoy!!!:)

                              ,Annie :D

I just finished my frappuccino and I had to create an account just to rate! Great recipe. I topped with whipped cream, turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw), and a sprinkle of regular salt. Tasted just like Starbucks!

Response to the reviewer who said they got caramel milk: Your coffee beans were stale. I had this problem forever until I realized that my 5 pound bag of espresso beans was losing its flavor in the first few weeks after opening it, and after that I got tasteless hot water. Now I buy small amounts of beans and only freshly roasted.

I just left Starbucks and have been asking at the various locations about the perfect drink for a diabetic. Sadly to say, they don’t have any options really. Most of the frappes have a sugary base. My wife works at the roasting plant and no insight. So I came home and made my own version very similar to this but low fat milk and sugar free. Came out great. No more wasting money for me or sitting at Starbucks without a drink. Make my at home with my girls mark out each week. Thank you

This is very good. If you are not getting a strong enough coffee flavor try adding instant coffee to it. (1T.)

I just made these for me and my hubby and OMG it tastes just like Starbucks! I used Italian coffee and whole milk and added just a little bit more ice. No more $10 drinks, make it at home for 1/3 the price! WIll make again! :)

Very good. I added more ice, be careful it makes A LOT of servings, I would cut it in half. More ice helps a lot because it's just a cool drink with the 2 cups of ice.

I use Splenda (1 packet per cup) instead of sugar and vanilla coffee mate( 1 tsp. per cup).  I don't have a blender, so I mix it all together while it's hot.  Absolutely wonderful!!!  I don't add milk, and it is wonderful hot or cold.  I usually mix it up and put it in the refrigerator.  If I want 6 cups, I use 12 scoops of coffee.  If making 6 cups, use about 1/2 cup of caramel.  If you want it cold (already chilled from the refrigerator) add some crushed ice.  If you want it hot, heat for about 2 minutes in the microwave.  Enjoy!

I used half and half creamer instead of milk and strawberry syrup instead of caramel. It turned out very good. I'm definitely making it again.

Very tasty! Next time I'll cut back on the coffee a bit. Just a personal preference, I like coffee drinks, but I don't like a strong coffee taste.

I found out that freezing the coffee in ice cube trays is better. It tasted diluted with 2 cups of regular ice cubes. It’s so delicious!

Instead of using 1 cup of coffee, use 1/3 cup and use maple syrup instead of sugar. You may want to add a little more ice if you want the frappuccino to be thick and also blend for about 1 minute.

Pretty darn good!  The flavor, substance, and caffeine is super close and close enough to not have to spend $6 every time I want a Frappuccino from Starbucks.  The steps were so straightforward that it was easy enough to make some tweaks on the fly.   First off, I wanted to make 1 drink/serving at a time instead of having left overs. So I did 1 cup of ice, 1/2 cup of coconut milk, 3/4 cup of store-bought cold brew coffee, and went a bit lighter on the sugar and caramel.  — I opted with store-bought, pre-made cold brew because I don’t have a lot of time on my hands, didn’t feel like trialing making the perfect batch, and it’s pretty affordable for a large 48oz bottle!  
— the coconut milk is great, and light and lactose free! 
— I also bought pre-made caramel syrup, in the future, I’ll look for sugar free
— I didn’t have sugar...crazy I know but I did have sugar-free vanilla syrup so I substituted this (2 Tbls) instead. 
All in all, I love the drink! Great way to save money in the long run!

I halved the amount of milk and added extra ice as per other reviews saying it was runny and it still turned out runny. However, the taste is great. Just dump the ingredients over whole ice cubes and stir. I did eliminate the sugar as well, there's enough sugar in the caramel for sweetness!

While it's pretty tasty, I didn't get nearly the right thickness. I ended up having to add at least another cup of ice to get a frozen drink. ranted, I used whole milk, but you'd think the more fat would help it thicken up faster. But either way, I'm going to keep making it. It's pretty tasty in the middle of a heatwave with a heat index north of 100°.

This came out great!  I actually liked it better than Starbuck's because I don't like how bitter their coffee tastes.  I used a bottled cold brew that I happened to have and it worked out nicely.  I used two T sugar - three is too much in my opinion.  Made two good-sized servings.

This recipe was amazing!  I made homemade caramel for it and it tasted amazing.  Honestly better than the Starbucks.  Perfect blend of espresso and sweetness!  Would totally recommend

Starbucks is my go-to place for coffee. It’s the only place I ever buy my coffee at and I’m thankful that someone actually took the time to teach us how to make it at home :)

Tastes great, really easy to make! Finding ingredients is the hardest part. I do recommend you find a straw if you use whipped cream, though I have to admit, it completed the Starbucks feel. Invest in straws.

Used 2 generous tablespoon scoops per cup brewed on specialty brew along with the Starbucks caramel syrup and it came out awesome.  My daughter loved it.  No more having to buy frappes at the coffee shop.

What was great: 
The taste!
It makes more than Starbucks and for fewer calories!
I can adjust the recipe to make it fit with my nutritional goals.

What I wish was better:
The consistency - It didn’t get that frappacino slushy consistency. It was more like iced coffee. I did let the coffee cool, and I have a Ninja blender, so I don’t think it’s that!

Really tasty. I just used a caramel hot cocoa packet  and mixed it while the coffee was hot.  I didn't wait long enough for the coffee to cool down so it wasn't as thick as a regular frappucino.  I would make it again for sure!

I'm not really a coffee drinker so I made changes for my guests..used 10 scoops of chocolate ice cream 1/2cup coffee 4oz chocolate sauce about 1/2 cup crushed walnuts whipped cream raspberries to garnish.  
In blender add 
ice cream 
1/2cup coffee 
3oz chocolate sauce
Blend until rich thick add more ice cream if needed.
Pour into FOUR 8-10oz fancy or fun looking glasses add whipped cream then drizzle chocolate sauce over each glass. Sprinkle walnuts. Add your straw.
Garnish with a raspberry on edge of glass..
Sit and enjoy a refreshing tasty milkshake/frapp with your guests..
Makes four servings.
You won't be disappointed most of all your guest won't be either.

I prefer a less sweet version and leave out the caramel. Just a few spoons of sugar in the raw and it’s the perfect frozen treat.

I was concerned with all the comments about the drink being watered down. I did some slight modifications. I doubled the recipe but used 3 cups of ice, 2 cups of coffee, 1 cup of milk and 2/3 cup of caramel. No sugar. I pulsed the blender 3 times and that was it. It was perfect. It was just the right amount of sugar without being too much. I think I could have reduced the caramel to 1/2 cup and would have even better results. I do like sugar but not to the point where I feel sick after.

This tasted almost exactly like the drink from Starbucks. I used a little less than a cup of coffee, and slowly added in caramel (I ended up using about 1/4 of a cup), and the result was delicious! Well done!

Good recipe but I used frozen coffee ice cubes instead of just liquid coffee to try to thicken it up. I also used salted caramel apple dip for the caramel sauce and topped it all off with whip cream and more caramel sauce.

I followed two different recipes for this, and the other was super disappointing. So, I was so happy when I tasted this and actually felt like I had just come from Starbucks! And it makes two, so I can share it or save the other for later!
P.S. I stirred in sea salt to taste, then added sea salt and a drizzle of caramel on top of the whipped cream, and BAM! Salted Caramel Frappuccino!

Made it, and it tasted like the original, except for two minor things. It was very sweet, and seemed like it might have less ice than the Starbucks® recipe. Since I wanted to try a new caramel recipe, made it with Oh-so Easy Caramel Sauce. Tasted great, will possibly make again (if I have the time!).

Used Starbucks instant coffee and substituted sugar with Splenda. Did not blend the ice, just the coffee mixture and poured over crushed ice. Spot on For a Starbucked iced Carmel latte light.

I didn't have any caramel, so I used a chocolate drizzle popcorn seasoning. It was only a dollar and works REALLY WELL. Definitely recommend. Also used a kcup of maxwell medium roast coffee that tasted good!

I made this but changed up the recipe. I added 1 cup of almond milk, 3 cups of ice,  1/4 cup of caramel macchiato creamer, and 3 tbsp of sugar, and about a tsp of vanilla. I made a cup of extra strong coffee and blended the ingredients and it was fantastic. I recommend more ice for a thicker consistency.

This recipe is nowhere near "Starbucks caramel frap" it is frothy and has a lot more of a thin liquid consistency than the original frappucino. I took two sips and threw out the rest.

Really yummy! I used about 4 cups of ice to make it the right consistency, I also could've used stronger coffee. Other than that it's delicious!

This was a great recipe to start out with, but I made a few changes. I used whole milk,  a lot of sugar, and more Carmel than the recipe called for and I loved it.

This recipe is an OK base, and needs heavy modifications to be even remotely close to Starbucks quality. If you follow this recipe to the letter you will be disappointed. 

I'm going to start making this more often, and after a few tweaks I'll report back with a complete recipe.

Didn't taste exactly like the actual thing.  It was a lot sweeter and not a very strong coffee taste, but other than that it was good. I definitely would make it again.

The perfect recipe!! I've tried many other frappe/frappuccino type recipes but none come close to this. I use Starbucks caramel kcups and caramel ice cream sauce and I'm golden!

This was yummy! I replaced the milk with coconut milk and used Splenda rather than sugar. I also froze the coconut milk in my cup (for an icier, thicker drink) and used an immersion blender straight in the cup. I also used decaf because I made it in the afternoon. These are all requests I make when ordering Starbucks and I have to say it was very close. Thanks for the money saving recipe!

I tried used Carmel syrup and it was a strong Carmel flavor but I definitely like the Hersey Carmel syrup better. I am also using k cups and using a light roast was much better then using a medium/dark roast. I also brew the coffee the night before so that it's completely cooled.

It was very tasty!  I think next time I will try with frozen coffee ice cubes to give more of a coffee taste vs.ice. I replaced the Carmel for chocolate syrup and sugar for 2tbsp of liquid sugar. I didn't have low fat milk so 2% worked great. Good summer coffee drink

I started with the 1 C of milk and 2 C of ice and reduced the coffee to about 1/4 C which still turned out too liquidy.  I added another 1.5 C of ice which resulted in same consistency as Starbucks.

I made this for my husband, who likes blended coffee drinks.  He & I both like the consistency and the taste. The measurments are perfect the this blended drink.  The added sugar isn't necessary.  It's sweet enough with the caramel syrup.   I used a medium roast coffee, because he doesn't like the strong taste of Starbucks coffees.

This was a perfect time to find this recipe - our first 90 degree day of the year!  Very tasty, but I plan to buy quality caramel sauce before making this again.  I used Smucker's Caramel Sundae syrup - we couldn't taste the caramel flavor, but the drink was tasty and refreshing, none-the-less. After the fact, I remembered the caramel syrup by itself barely tastes like caramel, so what should I expect. I started with no sugar (figured the caramel syrup had enough), but after tasting, added 2 Tbs. sugar.  This improved the flavor greatly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I would recommend to add a bit more ice to make it more frappuccino like (i.e. thicker.) Also maybe some vanilla extract. this recipe tasted almost just like it but again watery and you definitely need to use Starbucks® brand coffee.

It was okay. My husband drinks a lot of frappuccinos and he didn't like the texture, but it was tasty and made 2 large or 3 medium sevings.

Delicious! Instead of 1/3 cup carnelian syrup, I used 1/4 cup Torani and 1 tablespoon less sugar. Overall very delectable!

I didn't have any caramel so I used maple syrup instead. This surprised me with how well it turned out. I also substituted he sugar for stevia. Delicious!!

This was amazing! I've made this a couple times before, and it was good, but i was craving it so I made it again.  We were short n caramel sauce, so i looked for chocolate syrup, but we didn't have any, so i added a tablespoon of coco powder, an extra tablespoon of sugar, and grinded it up. It was delish!

My four girls loved it! I used 2% milk, with the last 1/4 cup being heavy cream. Why not? And my coffee was crazy strong. I like more coffee flavor than caramel. 
So easy to make. It's in our favorites now.

I made this but instead of making ice cubes from water, i made ice cubes from milk. I followed the rest of the recipe and it tasted just like the starbucks frappuccino.

I used Stevia instead of sugar, but also a bit more caramel than it called for. If you put caramel in the blender and then add some more at after you pour it into a glass, it tastes even more delicious!
