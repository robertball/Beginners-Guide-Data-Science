10.29.16  Love granola on my morning yogurt, so I’m always trying new recipes.  This recipe is so simple to make and is very tasty. I'll never understand why people buy granola; it's so easy to make and homemade tastes so much better.   Might add a few more chopped pecans next time (personal preference), but there will be a next time.

Except for using slivered almonds instead of pecans, I made this according to the recipe.  I liked how easy it was to make, that I had all the ingredients already on hand, and I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to cook it properly without burning it.   I made it specifically to go with yogurt and fruit and for that it was actually perfect.  When I ate it by itself, however, it was kind of bland.  So if I were to make it for snacking I'd probably add craisins and maybe some brown sugar or something else to sweeten it a little more.

I was looking for a recipe made with honey and no refined sugar, and coconut oil.  I liked this recipe for that reason.  I knew i wanted to use up some shredded coconut and plenty on nuts, and a few raisins and dried cherries.  The recipe already included cinnamon and I added about 3/4 tsp Redmond salt to the liquids.  I found the proportions to be very good, liquid to dry.  Since I had added 2-3 cups of coconut and 2 cups of walnuts and almonds, both raw and chopped, I doubled the honey oil mixture and baked as directed.  It hasn't quite cooled yet but preliminary tasting tells be its not too sweet or oily and the fruit which i added to the warm granola after removing it from the oven has softened from the warmth.  I think that the granola will be a bit less sticky when completely cooled, but I did bake on two quarter sheet pans for an added 10 minutes.  Now its just what I was looking for for a snack for the group going out tomorrow together after we talk to a few neighbors.

Very easy. I will make it again, but add more cinnamon or vanilla. I thought it needed more flavor.

Made this as-is, except for more pecans.  I now have a go-to granola recipe!!  This was utterly delicious!  And I’m not kidding here—I was looking for a recipe that used honey, as we have bees.  While this was baking, a bee actually flew in the house, something they never do! So, it must smell great to them as well.

I bought some unflavored protein powder and use that instead of the flour for an extra protein boost.
