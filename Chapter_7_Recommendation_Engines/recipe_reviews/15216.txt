To jazz up this recipie a little I added 1 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp. crushed red pepper to the sauce.  I also marinated the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes.  These 2 things really added to the flavor.  I will make these again.

I used mango juice as well, but I doubled the amount of the mango juice and used honey instead of molasses, so twice as much honey and i used ritz crackers which made for a crunchy breading. The chicken turned out to be juicy and sweet on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Amazing

I added grated orange zest to the cracker crumb mixture along with chopped fresh parsley.  I also cooked them on a baking stone and they were crunchy but still lacked something.  Perhaps some type of dipping sauce....an orange marmalade based dipping sauce????  I will probably try this recipe again.

Only gave 4 stars because I used mango juice instead of orange juice, and had to add more crackers.  I would also let sit in fridge after 1st coating then coat with bread crumbs again.  Very tasty!

This was simple and the grandkids loved it!  I might even try this using Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs for a totally different flavor.

These were pretty good.  The only thing I changed about them was that in addition to the crackers crumbs, I added some crushed Rice Krispies and some wheat germ.  The kids never even noticed I snuck in this healthy addition-they loved them and gobbled them up!  I personally don't think they had enough flavor to eat by themselves, but with some honey BBQ sauce they were great.

This recipe was ok, although I did expect more flavor.  It was pretty plain, and I followed the directions very carefully.  I don't think I will make it again.  It was pretty basis and I couldn't even taste the molasses or the orange juice.

Absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have any honey, so I used a little lemon juice.  They were a BIG hit!!

My family really liked these.  Good flavor and crispy.  I didn't have rice crispies, so I used club crackers.  I also used olive oil rather than butter.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I really like this recipe. It was fast and easy and has a light crispy taste. Although I was looking for a recipe that compares to Applebee's Boneless Chicken Wings this recipe was very good.

I have a very picky 9 year old and he loved these.  I did use real egg. Cut the chicken breast into bite size pieces and deep fried them.  He said they were better than chicken bites and chicken nuggets.  Thanks it is a keeper for us.

Very good! I need more crackers than mentioned and will probably use some non-stick spray in the future but I will be using this one in the future!

I didn't have any crackers so I used Panko bread crumbs, they were plain so I added some orange zest and some sage to balance out the sweetness. Also just added some honey to the egg instead of maple syrup. Overall, they were pretty good very orangy, don't think I added enough sage! but were very tasty, I also must have cut my chicken pieces smaller than the recipe originator, because I don't think 8 crackers would have been near enough for the chicken. Only got 4 starts because the toddler wasn't too impressed, but who knows.. I'll try them again on her tomorrow!

Didn't have molasses do doubled honey. Needs molasses. Even still very tasty. Added some crushed Rice Krispies in there as well.Will try with different juices. So many great variations you can try depending on what you have on hand.
