Super simple to make. Really only takes a blink of an eye to throw together. I used homemade peach jam in the middle of mine, as that was what I had on hand. I recommend you do like I did and chill the dough for a bit before baking.

This recipe is great, except I had a hard time making the logs so I made small balls instead and created a type of thumbprint cookie by indenting the middles with a spoon and putting the jam in the middle. Delicious! Note...the cooking time is lessened when made like this with the baking time around then minutes instead of 15-20.

So smart!  I never would have thought to do this - it's basically a "thumbprint" cookie but with much less rolling involved.  You could roll the logs in nuts...however you do "thumbprint."  But it is faster!  And it makes a nice-looking cookie.  I drizzled mine w/ a milk/powdered sugar glaze.

These are an easy variation of a thumbprint cookie.  Their color and shape make them a nice addition to a Christmas cookie tray and they taste delicious.  I found the dough every easy to handle although I did make more logs than the recipe calls for simply to make them easier to handle.  They will spread, so don't make the rolls too fat--3/4" really is just right.  I wasn't able to get seedless raspberry jam and used red plum that was delicious.

This is another cookie that I have made for several years. I try not to make them too often or my waistline would suffer.
I don't know what the last reviewer did differently, maybe not enough flour or too much sugar, but mine always comes out like a soft playdough. Very easy to roll out and shape.
I have used different jams and jellies in the past, and all come out great. The only change I make is I  use baking margarine. As always, my rule is to never melt the margarine when making cookies, that's what makes them spread.

Mine turned out flat but that didn't stop us from devouring them. Great shortbread-type flavor.

The recipe was quick, and easy, and the resulting cookie has good texture and flavor. I wish that I had made thumbprint cookies instead of the log style, just so I had a more uniform look.

The cookies tasted really good, however, the logs really spread out.  I think next time I will use this recipe for thumb print cookies.

Just made these to use up some jam.  I used strawberry jam, and they are very good.  My husband keeps sneaking into the kitchen to eat more!

We must admit we added a little more jam than was listed but that was more of a greedy thing.  (we like jam)  But as for the cookies everybody we shared them with raved.  This recipe creates a wonderful shortbread and the jam keeps it perfectly moist.

So easy to make (not necessarily super quick, but super easy)! They taste very buttery and are easy to cut after coming out of the oven. Don't skimp on the jam!

I've been making these cookies for years as my mother before me.  It was a Pillsbury Bake-Off finalist from the 1950s.  As most reviewers say, when you have a craving for nice cookies, this is the one to make because it goes together easily and most folks have all the necessary ingredients.  If you have trouble making the logs, do it on a lightly-floured surface.  For the reviewer who couldn't get the batter to set up, did you use real butter?  You cannot substitute.  Recipe doesn't give an alternative.  I'm betting you used a

They taste wonderful! The dough was hard to form into logs (too sticky). I made the 1/2 inch depression and my cookies are falling apart in the middle, spilling jam everywhere. I think next time I'll use this recipe and just make thumbprint cookies instead. Definitely worth making!

I wasn't going for presentation (just happened to have the ingredients and wanted something sweet) so I mixed the jam in with the batter. Still very yummy, of course.

This cookie has a light delicate taste that would be perfect if the cookie came together right.
I don't know what I did wrong, and I tried the recipe twice. With the first batch I assumed my butter was too soft because the dough was more like a batter
I even chilled it to get it to hold it's shape while I formed it into logs
but once in the oven it went flat and spread across my entire cookie sheet.
The second batch did the same thing even though I know the butter was cooler and the dough-still very soft- held it's shape better.
It's a very good idea for a quick and simple cookie but I can't seem to get it to come together like it should

Wonderful cookies.  As someone else mentioned, like thumbprints.  Exactly like thumbprints, actually, without hte rolling into balls and thumbprinting each one.  I like them a lot!  Very good!  My only issue is that I can't cut on my cookie sheet--I have a silpat sheet--so I transferred to a cutting board, then cut them there. It was a bit challenging to transfer the cookies without breaking them, so I may make 8 smaller logs next time and go from there.  But definitely I'll make again!  I love thumbprints, and these are much easier and less time consuming than the other recipe I use.  Thanks for the recipe!
