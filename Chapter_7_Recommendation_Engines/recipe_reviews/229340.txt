Ok. I'm stacking the deck in my favor. It's my recipe, and I really like it. It is creamy, tangy and has a great texture with the bacon and green onions. The flavor that develops is so deep and delicious. It is one of my favorite appetizers for the Holidays, but I will make it anytime.

I pretty much just tried this because Doc was so confident about it.  But I have to say it is great!  I don't think I would change a thing but maybe a little less salt.  But that is just my preference.  Try it, it is worth it.

I love this recipe! I usually end up doubling it and making two per holiday. I get lots of compliments, people tell me that it is better then hillshire farms cheese balls. I do have some greenophobes in my family-they wouldnt touch anything that was that covered in green food so I mix the parsley and dill with bacon bits and roll it in that. Its a hit!

I have made this three times for social gatherings and it's always a hit. I'm not crazy about it rolled in the dill as it's too dill heavy that way but rolled in nuts or just sprinkled with paprika would be fine.

I love this recipe. Very flavorful and the recipe is very versatile. For my vegetarian friends I substituted bacos for bacon and for my lactose intolerant friends I used non dairy cream cheese !! Delicious both times. Definitely a crowd favorite. I love the kick of the cayenne pepper.

Maybe I'm just not a cheese ball fan...

I followed this recipe exactly, but doubled it because I made two. I brought it to a french-themed dance at the high school with over 250 students. A few teenage boys tried a little on croissants, but I ended up bringing almost all of it home. Let's just say it wasn't popular. Now I have both in the fridge, hoping my husband will eat it tomorrow while watching the Super Bowl so I don't end up having to throw them away. :(
