These are really good.  I used Chile Tomato Flour tortillas ( more for color than anything else)  I used my homemade Pico de Gallo which might have been a little more chunky than store bought which worked great - it was also made with a jalapeno, finely diced.   The sour cream base is a great counter to the spice - just a nice blend of flavors.   I made some of these with turkey, ham and roast beef.  They were all great and they are all gone!

This was a huge hit for a weekend at the lake! I made the roll ups and kept them uncut in the fridge in the tin foil. As a snack, I would take out a roll or two, cut it up, and serve. So easy! Everyone asked for the recipe. I even secretly made them healthier with 100 calorie whole wheat tortillas and low fat sour cream and cheese.

I liked this ok. I didn't have pico de gallo so I used drained salsa.  I don't keep pico on hand and I wanted something quick so this is how I would do it if I ever did it again just for logistical reasons, but I bet it would be better with the fresher ingredients.  I thought it looked a little soggy so I added maybe 2 ounces of cream cheese.  For ease in prep I just mixed the shredded cheese in with the rest of the filling.  I used jalapeno cheddar wraps and I think they were 10 or 12 inches, so I only had enough filling for 4.  As an appetizer roll up, they were good but not outstanding.  I did try one roll up with ham (ran out of turkey) and didn't like it nearly as well.  You have to choose your deli meat carefully with this because you don't want anything sweet or super smoky.

I missed the instructions to drain the salsa so my sour cream mixture was very runny. I had guests coming over and needed to get these made. I had a package of cream cheese, added it to the mixture and increased the taco seasoning to a total of 4 tablespoons. This thickened up the mixture nicely. I finished making as directed and they were a huge hit. I used low fat sour cream and cream cheese. I will definitely be making these again.

I made these for a baby shower without the Pico, added homemade ranch dressign with the sour cream. I also make ham and shredded cheddar cheese ranch and s. cream. I used a thin wedge of dill pickle and wrapped the it upp with the dill showing in the center.

I was looking for a potluck recipe for my teen daughter to bring to a New Year's Eve party. Came across this. It was easy, didn't have to stay warm, tasted yummy! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would do different is I would probably make 1 1/2 times the sour cream mixture or add another 1/3 cup of sour cream to the already existing mixture. I used spinach and sun dried tomato tortillas for color and flavor.

I made these for a house warming party, exactly as written.  Everyone LOVED them and couldn't stop commenting on how good they are.  I am planning to make them again this week for a work potluck.

Easy to make, tasted great and saved well. I made a double recipe, wrapped in foil and threw in the fridge. They saved well for the next two or three days. Great for lunch on the go. I used spinach tortillas instead of plain flour tortillas and I added some shredded tri-mix cabbage for some crunch.

I made this with Chipotle Wraps and used Pico I threw together myself with what I had on hand. The husband loved it so much he wanted one for dinner too!!! Definitely a keeper!

I also liked this, followed the recipe as listed. Will do it again,  do think that the use of colored tortillas would have added to the appearance. Also adding a minced jalapeno might have increased the spice but I used a rather mild pico de gallo so if I had added some spice there it might have increased the flavor. Also might add some cilantro as a garnish next time.

Love this recipe. I made it for a family reunion - every last one was eaten. People went back to seconds. I'm making it again to another reunion. This is my go-to recipe!
