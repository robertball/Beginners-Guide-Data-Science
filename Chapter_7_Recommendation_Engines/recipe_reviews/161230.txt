I posted the original recipe and recently substitued canned (drained) mandarin oranges for the mangoes, which can be messy to prepare.  I loved it!  Any type of greens would work well--spinach, Romaine, mixed baby greens.

A friend of mine brought this to a party last night, and it didn't last long. The entire group loved it, and she told us to come here and get the recipe. I bet I'm not the only one who did. The salad had so many unusual combinations that worked beautifully together! I did not put dressing on my first helping and it was delicious without it. I did put poppyseed dressing on my second helping, and wow. I am not a salad fan, but this one won me over!

We really enjoyed this salad.  Only things we would change are using grapes instead of raisins and we didn't care for the red onion in the recipe and would leave it out next time.

I have to admit that I was skeptical about this recipe--I don't like fruit/meat/salad combinations!  But it is GREAT!  The sweet creamy poppy seed dressing makes this dish amazing--even if you're not really into that sort of thing. I often use baby spinach and packaged bacon pieces.  It's a favorite--even if you're NOT a parrothead!

Even my husband who doesn't normally think fruit belongs in a salad loved this! I served it with grilled chicken which he sliced and put on top of his salad and he went bck for more. We used the poppy seed mustard salad dressing from this site and it was delicious. It has gone into my "recipes to make often" list. Great for hot summer days when you just don't want a lot of cooking and heating or a heavy meal.

Blueberries and bacon? Strawberries and tomatoes? I was a little hesitant to combine these odd pairs in a salad....but I was pleasantly in awe! This is my new favorite salad. I served it to my closest (most honest) friends and they raved about it.  I added spinach to the romaine to add a little color and served with poppy seed dressing.  It would be a great summer meal if you add meat or grilled chicken.

This salad was a huge hit with my family. We didn't even need to use the poppy seed dressing, as the juices from the fruit made a delicious dressing itself! I will definitely make this again!

SOOOO good!  I brought this to a tennis match and there was none leftover.  Dressing isn't needed as the fruit juices are more than sufficient.

I was attracted to this salad because of it's name – gotta love it!!  Well, I’ll start by saying that this is quite the busy salad!!  There’s lots of stuff going on here!!  I made this as written, with the exception of subbing cantaloupe for the mango.  Even though I had pretty sweet cherry tomatoes from the garden, I didn’t think they belonged in this, and would leave them out next time.  I doubt they’d be missed.  We liked this, but all that fruit really weights down the tender leaf lettuce.  I’d suggest a sturdier lettuce, such as Romaine.  And I wouldn’t toss this salad with dressing as all your fruit would go straight to the bottom of the bowl due to it’s weight.  Instead do what I did and “arrange” the salad on the plate and then drizzle with dressing, if using.  Although none was specified, I used some leftover poppy seed dressing, which complimented this well.  This was tasty and we enjoyed it, but I don’t think all five fruits are necessary.  You could have an equally delicious salad using 2-3.

WOW - this was D'LISH!!  Got rave reviews at the party last night, what an awesome combination and such a pretty, colorful Summer salad!  Our Mangos weren't quite ripe enough so I added some Poppyseed Dressing to the salad and it was PERFECT!!  Can't wait to make it again!

Strawberries and blueberries were on sale and an ingredient search brought me to this wonderful salad. I even went to the store to buy everything, but no mangoes, maybe not in season. But they did have kiwi and so I used that instead, left the raisins out. I wasn't sure I'd like the addition of the cherry tomatoes but I really did. What a refreshing salad with a different burst of flavor from every bite. If not for the bacon it was healthy, but you could leave the bacon out and it would still be great. I used the Tangy poppy seed dressing from this site. Next time and there will be a next time I might try some feta cheese also and make a full meal of it.

This is a fun salad that adds a lot of color to the table.  I took a few liberties with this like using fresh grapes instead of raisins and also adding kiwi since I had some that I needed to use. It made for one eye-popping festive salad! That said, I did not care for the red onions, bacon, or tomatoes.  The flavors did not blend and made for an overall odd taste.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect.

I absolutely love this salad.  I used mandarin oranges instead of mango and used poppy seed dressing. This makes a very visually appealing salad and tastes great too.

Pretty good, but there definitely is a lot going on in this salad.  I left out some of the fresh fruit, since I didn't have everything, and it was still very nice and fruity.  Good flavors, but I'm not convinced that creamy poppyseed dressing is best in this.  I think I'd prefer a lemon poppyseed dressing (but this is an aside, as the recipe just makes the suggestion!).  Thanks for the recipe!

Served this salad to my picky-eating family, then at a pitch-in lunch.  My family loved it and people at the pitch-in were extremely happy with it.  I brought home only a little.  I added sunflower seeds to the mix, and you don't need the poppyseed dressing if you'll refrigerate chopped fruits together and add the lettuce and onion late.  Or, I refrigerated the fruit with the onion overnight, and got a different flavor that was still very enjoyable.

This was full of flavor. With the juicy mango you don't need salad dressing!  It was a hit at our home.

We enjoyed this salad.  We eat a lot of salads with lettuce and fruit (fresh and/or dried) and nuts.  What was different about this one, for us, was using the tomatoes and fruit in the same salad.  Usually I use either fruit OR some combo of tomatoes and veggies (cukes; peppers; ETC).  I actually didn't notice the tomatoes, with all of the other flavors goin' on.  I used grape tomatoes (halved), blackberries instead of blueberries, and mandarins instead of mango.

I took this to a football party yesterday, devoured with many compliments!  I was disappointed my store was out of mango, so I prepared with mandarin oranges as suggested by previous reviewers, and they worked beautifully (and easily!).  I also subbed dried cherries for the raisins.  I used "honey-balsamic" dressing, it was delicious on this.  Thanks for sharing, this is a crowd pleaser and a keeper! http://allrecipes.com/recipe/honey-balsamic-vinaigrette/detail.aspx?

Made per recipe with a couple of changes. Used romaine lettuce and some spinach leaves and golden raisins. For the dressing I used 1/3rd cup pineapple orange juice and 1/4th cup white balsamic vinegar.

I made this for my son's grad party. It was a hit. I used mandarin oranges instead of mango's. I may have put too many tomato's in.  I left the poppy seed dressing for the side. Most everyone ate it without the dressing! I will make again.

Only change I made was to add mandarin oranges for the mango. Was a big winner!!  Did serve with the poppy seed dressing but really doesn't need it!

It was good. Kinda too sweet for me, I also added feta cheese to simmer the sweetness. I used pineapple instead of mango as it's what I had on hand. I also put a little of my homemade balsamic lemon vinaigrette dressing on it.

followed the recipe except: deleted bacon but added star fruit (pretty). also added arugula which was a nice addition -  was skeptical about adding tomatoes with fruit but was really delicious.  got rave reviews - did add Ken's light poppy seed dressing - this salad was delicious & pretty.  love the name too!

I made this with sliced fresh apricots, blueberries, fresh pineapple and mandarin oranges instead of the mango, strawberries and raisins, because that's what I had. It was very good! I think any combo of fruit would be tasty. I really liked the blueberries. My husband really liked it and he's a meat and potatoes guy. I used the home made poppyseed dressing from this site.

This salad was a hit. I served it as a side with salmon. I send a Greek vinegarette dressing. My guests raved. I substituted grapes instead of raisins. I will absolutely make this salad again.

I haven't made this, and it sounds wonderful, and numerous reviewers mention using a poppyseed dressing to use over the salad, which sounds delicious, but the recipe for the dressing is not included: as there are at least 170 recipes for poppyseed salad dressing on this site, could someone direct me to the proper recipe?  Thanks!

I used a mix of romaine and spinach, oranges instead of mango, dried cranberries instead of raisins, and left out the red onion.  I think it would be better with homemade poppyseed.  Didn't care for the store bought.

I have made this salad many times. I have made with mixed greens and just romaine - both are amazing. I made it exactly as written with mangos. You can buy bottled poppy seed dressing (marzettis)or make your own with mayo, sugar, poppy seeds, vinegar and milk - simple and delish!

I made this and thought that it was good overall. I would just omit the cherry tomatoes next time. It just had an odd taste with the salad because the other ingredients were sweet. I guess it's just a personal thing. You can just leave them out or in if you seem to love cherry tomatoes.

Ok, yum!! I am not normally much of a salad person at all but this was amazing! I hate to say I did change a couple things, but it wasn't on purpose. I love mangoes & was SOO looking forward to having them in this salad, but the store didn't have any when I went. :-( So I used mandarin oranges instead. We also ended up adding grilled chicken to ours because we like more protein, but I did try it without the chicken & without any dressing & it was yummy. But thank you to all who suggested the poppyseed dressing (I'd never has it before)- it really made this even better! Great salad, thank you!!

Best salad ever! We loved the juiciness of the fruit with the salty flavors from the bacon. This is definitely a new family favorite!
