This is a great recipe for a sweet salsa with a bit of kick.  I had some kiwis to get rid of and didn't know how to best use them.  I used green onions and a sweet white onion because that was what was on hand.  I also used agave instead of honey.  Next time I'll add mango & avocado - its a very versatile dish.  I had some guests over for mexican dinner night.  This dish made a great appetizer with tortilla chips in front of some fresh  fish tacos.  It would have been good with the tacos but didn't last long enough!  The cumin and curry really add alot so don't forget them!!!

I really love this salsa, its light, refreshing, and the cumin balances the sweetness of the kiwi perfectly and also makes it the perfect pairing for more savory dishes. I added to some red pepper flakes for color contrast and kick. I also used agave because I don't have honey. Lovely salsa and will make again.

This was nice on grilled fish but Very Spicy!!!!  I had to add extra honey just to cool it down and I had only added half of the onion that it called for. Not sure if we would have enjoyed with chips, but the fish is a yes.

I loved this recipe and prefer this as my Pico de gallo. It smells like avocado when being made.  These are the basic ingredients for the kiwi salsa shown and can be made to taste. I added chipotle seasoning.

I made this and served with Chicken - what a treat!  The salsa is excellent with just the right amount of onion and jalapeno.  The curry added a great flavor also.  Will definitely make again!!

This is the second worst salsa I've ever had in my life. I wouldn't ever try this again. What a waste of kiwi.

I can't handle spice, so I didn't add the jalapeño and it was still delicious. I did add more curry, cumin, and lime juice though. The recipe is a good base start! Thanks for sharing!

When I found myself with 2 cups of chopped kiwi left over from a social this was the perfect recipe for using it up.  I loved it with planked salmon.  I don't like curry powder so I left it out.

Delish! Could have eaten the whole bowl on its own with a spoon :) I didn't have jalapeño pepper so added pepper flakes to the mix. And used maple syrup in place of honey. Thanks!

Great salsa you can make, I did a yellow onion and a habanero, spicy but great tasting with the kiwi.

I thought this was really good.  I served it over Red Snapper that had been baked with garlic butter.   My hubby thought it was weird.
