I have to admit that I am a bit of an ingredient snob, so cooking something with condensed soup in the ingredients would not normally be my thing.  That being said I really liked this recipe.  I added a bit more broccoli & pepper, other than that I stuck with the recipe.  Thanks for a quick & easy dinner.

To me this was flavorless. I had to add alot of salt to make it taste like something. Won't make it again. Its totally lacking something.

I did 1/2 cream of mushroom and 1/2 cream of chicken, added chopped chicken, garlic salt, Italian Seasoning and cheese.  It was ok, but too much cream of soup flavor for me!

This recipe was awesome. I did add some fried onions to the top for a crispy crust.My husband won't eat anything with broccoli in it and he loved it! We are putting this one into frequent rotation at our house. Definitely a keeper (and easy too, for our family of 6!)

Surprisingly ok for a quick side-dish for a family w/small kids. A little bit better or at least a change from an out-of-box noodle kit. Didn't have egg-noodles but the elbow noodles I had in stock worked fine. Served w/chicken. Thanks.

It's a hit! Easy-peasy, quick, inexpensive, and my family loved it - all asked for seconds. Made recipe as-is.  Will definitely add this to my rotation!

This was just ok...definitely needs something.  Everyone ate it but no one asked for seconds.  Don't think I will make this again though it was quick and easy.

Loved this!  Even my 5 year old wanted seconds, did make a little more of cream of chicken for more of a sauce.  I also used canned chicken breats...the whole thing was done in 15 mine!!

My Husband and I loved this! I served it as a side dish and Hubby recommended I save this recipe. Instead of Cream of Chicken, I added Cream of Chicken & Mushrooms and a little more pepper. It was very good. We will definitely have this again!

I did not like this at all- in fact I did not finish my serving.  My husband said that it was good- not great.  I will not make it again.

Very easy and delicious!  I added some fried bread crumbs to the top to make for more of a casserole.  Goes a long way too!  Thanks

This was fantastic. I did cut up three boneless chicken breasts and browned them before adding to the dish for some protein. I also thought 2 cups of broccoli seemed to be a little skimpy so I doubled that. I loved it and it will be in my regular rotation.

My family loved it! Went back for 2nds and 3rds. Added about double the amount of pepper for added seasoning.

This was very yummy... my husband doesn't eat many things that are green, but he loved this!  My two year old twins loved it as well ( i love when i can sneak veggies in them).  I think it was a tad bland, but will figure out something to whoop it up a little next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was out of butter and eggs so I used the ingredient finder to look up a side for my chicken last minute.  My 3 year old really liked it. I thought it was good but not something I will crave on a regular basis. My husband was not a fan at all.
