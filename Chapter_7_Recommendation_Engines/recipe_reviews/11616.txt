The kids each gave me a strange look after they took a bite.  They weren't horrible, but I probably ever make them again.  Thanks anyway Kay ;)

Because of the negative reviews, I didn't use the recipe for the cookie, I just bought a choc cake mix, and added 1/3C oil, 2 eggs, and 3/4C Water at 375 for 10 min and they were perfect, I did however use the filling, because I don't like eating (or have my kids eating) shortening that's found in most whoopie pie recipes, despite reviews to the contrary, the filling is rich and delicious, and needs no liquid at all as long as you are using room temp butter.  I am giving it four stars for the filling alone.

I am sorry to say it, but this recipe had some downs. The whoopie pies came out flatter than a pancake- they really needed baking powder. Also, the icing was delicious, but because it was so thick it didn't stick properly to the cookie part. I had to end up throwing it all out. I am really sorry though!!!

My family nearly died laughing when I showed them these cookies! Flat as paper and the filling was in need of moisture of some type!

Maybe adding some baking powder to the cookie mixture would help them be more cookie-ish and not so pancakey. =)

I like this recipe because it uses butter, not shortening. More cocoa needs to be added (at least 1/2 cup) to make them more chocolate-y, though. I used half butter and half cream cheese for the frosting, too. I painted half of the pies with dark chocolate, melted, and that helped, too.

Something was missing from this recipe. The chocolate part was extremely flat! I tried adding baking soda and still extremely flat. I am not impressed with this recipe will not make again.

This recipe was ok. The chocolate part was very flat. I was looking for a more of a cake cookie. But overall it wasn't bad. Would never make this again though.

Very delicious.  Kids love to fill and put together.  One of the best whoopie recipes I have had a chance to try.  Kay is right "no one can resist".
