It's easy and fun to make and eat, and I suspect kids will love it 'as is'.  I found it a little bland, so the next time I will spice it up a little.  Instead of making one big pizza roll, I rolled the dough out very thin and made several smaller ones.  They were easier to eat that way, and I froze the leftovers. I'm hoping they'll reheat well for a quick lunch or dinner.  Update:  Freezing them worked really well!  After defrosting, I threw them in my toaster oven, and they made for a nice fast, hot meal with no fuss.

3.12.18  First, I want to say that this recipe tells you to brown the ground beef and onion but doesn’t tell you what to do with it???  Hopefully, Allrecipes will see this error and correct it.  I  assumed it was to be put inside the pizza roll, and it was the first thing I put down on the dough.  I just couldn’t see only ground beef and onion, so I did add some Italian seasoning, garlic powder,  and crushed red pepper flakes.  I did let the ground beef mixture cool a bit, but it still was a bit of a struggle rolling this up, but it did bake up looking O.K.  Be prepared to eat this with a fork because you won’t be able to eat it with your hands.  I’m not sure I’d use both cheddar and mozzarella cheeses the next time (just couldn’t taste both of them); most likely, I’ll just stick with mozzarella.  We love pizza in this house, it was nice having something other than a round traditional pie, and it turned out pretty well.
