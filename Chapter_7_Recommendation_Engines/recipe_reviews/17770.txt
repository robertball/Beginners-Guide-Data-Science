I like Amaretto, but am a bit of a snob when it comes to the brand, I don't think anything is worth drinking unless it is the Disaronno, and I can honestly say, this recipe is so very close to Disaronno that I will make this rather than spend on the real thing now. Thank you so much for this great recipe.

I figured the best way to compare is to do a side by side comparison :) I followed the recipe exactly and used dark brown sugar. Two shots side by side the color was slightly different but I'm thinking it's just my brand of dark brown sugar.  The scent of both was pretty dead on but Disarono has a slight rubbing alchohol leftover scent towards the end.  Finally the taste test, the Disaronno had a slightly stronger and sharper aftertaste.  This amaretto had a smoother, fuller, and a tad bit sweeter taste to it.  Surprisingly I'd have to say I like this amaretto more than Disaronno.  Give it a try.  It's worth the effort and ingredients.

This really is very good. I love to make a drink called blueberry tea but it can get pricey. This recipe lowered that bill. Brew an earl grey tea bag, add 1 ounce amaretto, 1 ounce Grand Marnier, and a twist of orange. Now I just need a recipe for Grand Marnier.

This was great with just one cup of vodka. Also, I doubled the sugar water mixture and cooked it about five minutes more after it reached boiling stage. This made it more syrupy and just right for Amaretto.

I changed this recipe up just a bit to make it a little thicker and not as potent. I did everything the same, except instead of 2 cups of vodka I used 2/3 cup of absolute vodka. I slowly poured the sugar mixture into the vodka til it tasted just right.
Very good!

Who knew it could be this easy to make delicious amaretto??  I will never buy commercial amaretto again.  I even used the cheapest of vodkas, and this turned out wonderfully.  I intend to give it as gifts!

Thanks for posting such a great recipe!

Very tasty!  I let the sugar-water mixture boil for 2 minutes to thicken it up a little bit more.  It was very easy to make, and although it still wasn't as thick as the "real stuff" nobody complained...they were too busy drinking!

Not quite as thick as store bought but with a good flavor.  Better for recipes than for sipping, maybe.

Incredible! So much like the real thing! It's easy enough that I was able to whip up a batch in no time for unexpected company. It works great in recipies too! It's so much less expensive than spending at least $15 for a small bottle of Amaretto and my old Italian family couldn't even tell it was homemade!

Amazing!  I gave it away to some friends who always drink Disaronno & they couldn't tell the difference.  They drink it with sprite or 7-up and it's great!  Now that I've tried it, I wish I hadn't given it all away.  Two tips 1. use DARK brown sugar 2. make sure the simple syrup is not hot before adding your liquor or the vodka will evaporate (10 minutes wasn't long enough for mine to cool down).  I experimented & used cheap vodka & I didn't like it at all!  I really didn't think it would make too much of a difference but it did.  I store it in the fridge and shake well before serving.  Great find!  Thanks!

Tastes as good as "the expensive stuff". Added a drop or two of red food coloring to finish it off.

I have made this for 4 years now...it's a hit every time! 
Hints: One 1.75ml jug of vodka is almost 7.5cups. If you change the servings to 45, it will adjust everything accordingly. This works great for a large batch.
Also, seal in airtight glass bottles (washed free of any previous smells/flavors) for best results. 
This can be consumed immediately, but tastes better and better as it sits undisturbed.

I get rave reviews on this Amaretto!  I don't drink as a life choice but as a host who wants to serve my guest something special and very tasty, may of them ask for this receipe!  They don't believe I made it until I hand them this receipe.  I save a VOX bottle and fill it up. It looks great and maybe taste better??  Can be used right after it cools down, yes, better when cooled...be patient...

This is the first liqueur recipe I have tried.
I really enjoy it with coffee, cola, and even ice cream so far.  I really don't know how it could be improved, but I really prefer to make everything that calls for brown sugar with dark brown sugar.

I usually only drink inexpensive Amaretto, and I was not sure that I liked the liqueur. However, to make this recipe cost me about $10, which is the cost of the least expensive bottle of Amaretto in a liquor store in North Caroline. This recipe changed my mind. This is a great Amaretto recipe, and I will never buy it again. 

The recipe does not say to let it sit, but I let it age for about 2 weeks before I used it. 

Great job, Marjory. It was amazing!

So simple, fast, and tasty!  I accidentally doubled the brown sugar, but I think the mistake wound up bringing the recipe to the "thickness" everyone else was looking for and gave it a the deeper amber color we're used to seeing with amaretto.  The hardest part was finding a place that sells bottles (I wound up finding a cool shaped bottle at The Container Store), but if I had planned ahead I might have gone to one of the many stores online.  Type  "empty glass bottles" into your search engine.

Really good, tastes just like commercially prepared. Because of dietary restrictions I used Splenda (brown & white) still very good. Will never buy Amaretto at the liquor store again.

Oh, Yumm! Made dark brown sugar by adding some molasses to light brown sugar. Quick cooled the pan by rubbing ice cubes over it, then took it to the neighbors for a taste test. Now I have to make her some for the W/E.  This is a great recipe & so easy! Thanks for sharing, Marjory.

Fantastic, this is just wonderful.  Why have I never discovered Amaretto before???  Plan on serving this to guests on Sunday.  Now I know just how easy it is to make I will make another batch to use in the various desserts that require it on this site.

OH YEA!!!  This recipe is great!  I am an amaretto lover.  It is as good as the expensive one.  The only thing I changed is......instead of just letting the sugar mixture 'cool'  I CHILLED it.  You probably could just make the sugar mixture and refrigerate it overnight and then continue with the recipe.  Next time I will use a 'better grade' vodka but the cheap one was really good.  I saved an Amaretto bottle (750 ML) and this recipe made about 1 cup more.  @ more than 1/2 the price of the store stuff.  Hope you all ENJOY  .........  I AM!

I love this recipe. I have increased the amounts to match the vodka bottles. My friends all love it. I use it many ways. In chocolate cake, in coffee, in orange juice, in cherry pepsi, and as a sipper straight up over ice. I had a bottle of the mass produced variety                 and this recipe side by side. There was no difference      in taste. This recipe seemed smoother. I  don't really care for alcohol flavored drinks. This is very nice for sipping on a cold night.definitely 5 stars.

This is seriously amazing. The only problem I had with it is that after I chilled the remaining drink and returned the next day, it was much stronger. I understand why, but if you are making this for the next day, you may want to add less vodka. Otherwise, it was perfect!

I made this last year during the holidays. For homemade it was really good. It was a little sweeter and the color was a little off from Disaronno, but other than that it was tasty. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar just a tad as I like to make Amaretto Sours and it was a little too sweet with the sour mix. I will def make again though.

O-M-G. Seriously, I'm an amaretto addict, and I don't care for vodka. But did this ever come out awesome!!! I just made the stuff-super easy! & I am so ready for a second drink! A bit sweeter than usual, but that just means one less step for my amaretto sours! Now i only need limes, water and ice-Yum to the Max!

I must admit I didn't like this too much. Tasted sweet but not enough alcohol to balance out. However, it does go well with cola.

I've never bought Amaretto myself, but my father did once or twice and I've had it mixed in drinks. I can't say how dead-on this is, but it's very nice-tasting. I made a 1/4-size batch, and didn't have enough vodka (I had 1/3 cup when I needed 1/2), but it turned out fine and with less of the alcohol-taste that makes me gag. This is great mixed with some ice cream and ice. :) Also excellent mixed with some of Janet's Coffee Flavored Liqueur III off this site, ice, and milk. Thanks, Marjory, for sharing!

I made this recipe then sampled along side amaretto I brought home from my vacation in Italy. Seriously, I could not taste a difference. I don't use amaretto often but when I need some for a recipe or cocktail for a guest, this will definitely what I use. Outstanding!

WOW!!!  This recipe is awesome.  I used a cheaper vodka and I was more than happy with it.  I actually ran out of almond extract, so I made up for the rest (1 tbsp) with more vanilla extract.  This was just too good to be true.

This is excellent. I make it every year and put in my Amaretto Disaronno Bottle and no one knows the difference. I also give it to friends as gifts in smaller bottles. Make sure you use a good quality vanilla and amaratto extract and also make sure you use dark brown sugar.
Light brown sugar just doesn't do it justice.
Thanks again

I couldn't believe how good this  recipe was. I plan to give it as gifts to friends.  Initially,  I used a tad less vodka, but kept adding more, and it remained absolutely delicious! Thank you for an all-time favorite to my collection!

I made a batch with some vanilla vodka I had laying around the house.  It turned out delicious.

Although I've never tasted store bought Amaretto this was a real hit at a college house party! I kept getting rave reviews on it and they were quite surprised that I made it. =) I don't care much for almond flavors but this was absolutely delicious mixed with Sprite. I also used this to make Tiramisu inspired cupcakes and they came it great and look forward to baking with it more.

Very tasty.  I'm not a connoisseur of commercial Amaretto, so I can't comment on how close it comes to the original, but I'll use this with pleasure.  I followed the advice of a couple of reviewers and used dark brown sugar and simmered the syrup for 5 minutes to thicken it.  For me, a cup and a half of vodka was just right.

To me, this tastes just as good as the kind from the store.  I even used cheap vodka and it turned out amazing.  It makes great drinks.  My favorite is an amaretto sour with ice, cold water, and lime juice.  Yummy!

This is so right on for an amaretto liqueur.  I make this rather than buy Disaronno. Mixed with ginger ale and it tastes like a cream soda or mix with Mikes hard limeade and it tastes great.

This is the only recipe for Amaretto that I've tried, but, regardless, I give it a thumbs up!  It's super easy and tastes just as good as amaretto you would buy at the liquor store.

I've never tried store bought amaretto before so I don't know how it compares, but it was really good and easy to make. I'll have to find a fancy bottle for it so that I can really impress my guests.

Just made this wonderful drink. And it really does taste like Disaronno except this amaretto is a lot smoother in taste. Made the recipe as stated. It's very easy and cheap to make and everyone love this one better. Thanks Marjory.

Easy to make and tastes nice, but the Almond extract separates from the other liquid as it's in a peanut oil carrier for cooking. If you have the patience it's worth making it without the almond essence, by soaking some skinless ground almonds in the vodka for 2 months before use.

I would give this a 5 stars if it indicated DARK brown sugar. I made this with what I had on hand (light brown sugar) and it was OK. Next time I will wait for the dark brown sugar before making again.

Excellent!  I accidentally added 2 tbsp of coconut extract bcz I wasn't looking at the bottle, then added the vanilla extract too!  It turned out wonderful!  I will be doing these for Xmas.  I also did the boiling of sugar water to attempt to thicken up.  Turned out excellent.

So easy, so delicious! I have made this more than a dozen times and never a fail. I have went as far as bottling it and giving it as gifts for the holidays. I like to use the dark brown sugar, and if available, 1/2 cherry vodka and 1/2 regular. All of our friends ask us to bring it to parties. This is definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy to make and tastes delicious! My adult son says it tastes like the Amaretto he gets at Trader Joe's. 

I plan to make some more and give it out as gifts.

It tasted like cough syrup.  To make it palatable, it needed more water and the water and sugar needed to simmer (1 hour) to make the simple syrup needed for liquors.

I can't believe how easy this was! I live the combination of Disaronno and white chocolate, so I thought I would give this a try. I took the advice of other reviewer and used dark brown sugar. I also used Smirnoff brand vodka to see if it would be good without having to use Grey Goose (my preference). It was perfect! No need to buy this at the store again.

I have to say that this is VERY close if not dead on to the taste of the real deal. I've done the blind taste test with 10 people.  Surprisingly 80% liked the homemade better!

No complexity, too sweet, thin, and artificially flavored. Besides, Drambuie is built on scotch whiskey, not vodka! And it uses honey not sugars. Scotch would bring a lot of its complexity along with it, paired with he right ingredients. But these are not them. If you're willing to spend money on expensive abstracts ans such, why not save up your pocket change and get the real thing!

This stuff is great!  Didn't have enough regular vodka so I mixed with Six Vanilla vodka, didn't seem to make much of a difference.  Beats spending $20 for real amaretto.  It is sweet so maybe next time a little less sugar

I used this as a basic recipe to make different flavor cordials. By using flavored vodka and using different extracts I made several yummy tasting drinks for my next party.I only gave 4 stars because I didn't make the actual recipe, I scaled it to make several varieties.

It was really good! I made it with a little bit more sugar at the suggestion of someone else and I think that may have made it too sweet! I also used vanilla concentrate from Dominican Republic on the second batch and that made the flavor so much better! You can find it at any Latin American grocery store, which is easy to find here in Miami! Overall, it was good, good strong flavor, and it doesn't need as much vodka as the recipe calls for.

Very good!  It's not quite as "thick" or sweet as DiSaranno, but it is still delicious!  I made an amaretto sour with it and it was very good.

Not cost effective to save $ because of the cost of the vodka.  Tastes just like the real thing though.

I used this amaretto recipe in my tiramisu and it was brilliant!!! Definitely just as good as the real thing at a fraction of the cost.

This is not a smooth drink due to the stoutness of the vodka but it has a great flavor.

Really tasty! Following other suggestions: (1) I simmered the sugar & water for a few minutes to thicken it up; (2) since many reviewers suggested dark brown sugar, but I only had light, I replaced ALL the sugar (brown and white) with light brown sugar; (3) added alcohol to taste - for sipping by itself, I used about 2/3 of the vodka called for

The flavor is great for sipping over ice. 

I tried soaking 1 package of Sunmaid Dried Apricots in the vodka for 30 days and using that for the base. Now that is outstanding!

Tastes great! I used mostly brown sugar and only a cup and a half of vodka! It even tastes better as it ages! Awesome in coffee!

The first time I made this I felt it was 5 star worthy but I think the key to taking it up a notch and making a truly wonderful amaretto is the alcohol. I taste tested several to find one that had no aftertaste and was truly a neutral flavor, it also turned out to be a  fairly inexpensive selection, Svedka. And no, I don't work for Svedka or get any consideration from them.

Better than the "real" thing! I have made this many times, and given it away as gifts. Friends are always happily anticipating the holidays, claiming this amaretto is smoother than the top brands! I double the recipe and make this in an 8 cup glass pyrex pitcher with a pour spout, in the microwave. I heat the water in the microwave, wisk in the sugars, let cool. Add cold vodka and extracts. Pour into bottles using a funnel. Definitely use dark brown sugar. Also, much better when served chilled.

I had my husband blind taste test this against Dekuyper brand. This recipe is sweeter and has less of an alcohol taste, but it does taste different. My husband chose this one as the better amaretto. This is a great recipe if you have the ingredients and need amaretto. I am not sure it's a cheaper alternative.  I suppose a lot of that depends on the quality of vodka you use. We used Smirnoff and that comes to about $12.30 for the 2 cups (and that's without addition of other ingredients). 2 cups of Dekuyper's Amaretto comes to about $6.15.

I LOVE IT!!!! I followed the recipe exactly it is very very difficult to tell the difference between this and Disaronno.  The only 'down side' is that  using Almond EXTRACT means that you will  find that the Almond oil in the EXTRACT separates and lays on the top but this is nothing as a quick shake before serving and its not a problem, maybe they meant Almond ESSENCE. Will have to try it to see it this makes a difference. Made this and bottled in Christmas bottles with ribbons attached for Christmas Presents which according to my son in law will be gratefully received!

I've made this a few times now and I love how simple it is.  I recommend less almond extract though.  I use 1 and a half tablespoons almond extract, otherwise the almond flavoring is too overpowering.

I am really impressed with this recipe! I swapped the amounts for white and brown sugar around so my spirit is the same colour as "the original one". I also added some glycerine to get that sirope liqueur texture, don't add to much! Start with just a little and taste. Taste is really good and will improve over the weeks! Here in New Zealand you allowed to distill your own alcohol! So great to make my own almond liqueur now Thanks for sharing UPDATE 26-07-14 after a few tests I noticed that alcohol% is to low compare with the 28% amaretto from italy so I replaced the 1 cup water with alcohol (vodka) as well so three cups alcohol, no water. I don't heat it! I put everything in my Kitchen Aid machine and mix it cold for about 30 minute's so sugar is dissolved as well ( longer if needed) The alcohol I use is homebrew 40% alcohol but with all the sugar and extract you around 29% I guess. You always can the one cup water replaced with half water half alcohol if its to strong for you. Not for us living in New Zealand :-) enjoy but drink responsibly!!

I used Whipped Cream flavored vodka when making this (for the 3rd time!) loved it!  Has a slightly different flavor, maybe sort of a almond cream soda sort of flavor.  All my friends thought it was awesome, will be making more for gifts and maybe using other flavored vodkas as well.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this with Finlandia vodka, since it's smooth and doesn't add a distinctive taste.  I had only light brown sugar, so I added a half teaspoon molasses.  It didn't have that little afterbite that the real thing has, so I added a teaspoon of brandy. That did it. I gave Hubby a sample of Disaronno side by side with this, and he couldn't tell which one was the real thing!  The only difference was that this is thinner.  I will try a reviewer's hint to use half corn syrup and half white sugar, or boiling for five minutes next time.  Love it!

To thicken, use 1/2 the amount of white sugar & subsitute the remainder of the sugar with Karo light syrup.  I do this for my Kahlua as well.  Thinkens it right up.
I also use brandy for my Kahlua instead of vodka - not so bitter. :-)

Smelled great and tasted good.  I gave these away in small corked bottles I found at a craft store.  I attached a recipe for Italian Margaritas and was sure to tell recipients to store upright and use within a month or two.  I'm glad I tried it.  Thanks.

Smelled great and tasted good.  I gave these away in small corked bottles I found at a craft store.  I attached a recipe for Italian Margaritas and was sure to tell recipients to store upright and use within a month or two.  I'm glad I tried it.  Thanks.

Couldn’t be happier with this recipe.  It was easy to make.  And it’s absolutely delicious!  I used dark brown sugar as many reviewers suggested.  And now have to do another batch - went through the first one in under a week. Thank you, Marjory!  I’m now very popular...

I just made this - actually changed it up a bit.  Used coconut sugar for the brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of stevia.  
Let me tell you this is fabulous!  I think it tastes better than what you buy, I will definitely be making this again, super easy too!

Added 1/2 tsp more almond extract and it came out wonderful. Tastes just like what you buy in stores. My friends have tried it and said it’s some of the best Amaretto they’ve ever tasted. They wanted to know the brand name. When I told them I made it they couldn’t believe it! Tastes that good!

Have made this many times since discovering this recipe. My husband's favorite drink out is Amaretto on the rocks. He thinks this is BETTER than top shelf brands.
So incredibly easy to make and so much cheaper.
Thank you Marjory!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it as gifts for wedding guests for my daughter's wedding. I used dark brown sugar for a richer flavor. Some reviews suggested that it is not as thick as the store bought  amaretto. If you let the simple syrup reach 219 degrees, the amaretto thickens nicely when you combine all the ingredients. This recipe has made it to our family cookbook!

This is a keeper. After reading the reviews I opted to add an extra 1/2 cup brown sugar and let it boil about 5 minutes. It had a nice thick constancy after letting it completely cool down - about 1 hour. I used a medium priced Vodka. It turned out great and 1/2 filled my other famous brand Amaretto bottle. I will make a double batch this weekend , as it  is better after aging and I'm getting low.  I love Amaretto in my Margaritas, it takes the sourness away.

Many reviewers suggest using dark brown sugar. That's fine, taste-wise. But keep in mind that the color of any brown sugar, light or dark, looks even darker once it gets wet. So using DARK brown sugar specifically for the brown sugar component, or no granulated/white sugar at all and ONLY light or dark brown sugar, will yield a much darker beverage than your store-bought amaretto. The color may be as dark as Coca-Cola. And if you go even further, and use a richer tasting, less refined brown sugar, such as turbinado, muscovado, demerara, piloncillo/panela, or the like, you will also get a beverage that's much murkier looking, and far less translucent (even as opaque as prune juice!), even if you hold your glass up to the light. Again, fine taste-wise, but rather off-putting visually. You sure won't be able to pass it off to your guests as an expensive import!

Very good recipe for amaretto. I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown and used vanilla beans instead of vanilla extract and I let it sit overnight before bottling it and it's pretty close to tasting like Disarrono

Actually, my daughter made this and gifted us with it on Christmas (she knows we love Amaretto and drink it often).  We shared it with our "Amaretto-drinking" friends and we all agreed ... this is as good, if not better, than DiSaronno Amaretto which is what we always buy!  She used Kirkland vodka (Costco) just as an FYI.  We'll be making our own in future rather than buying at the liquor store!

No changes to the recipe because I wanted to try it first and see how it came out. Love, love, loved it. I am a big fan of Amaretto so it was great. Gonna try some variations now and see how it goes.

I’ve been making this for many years, in fact I see my review from 2004 is here. This year, to switch it up, I made a double batch with 750ml of vodka and 250ml of kirsch to give it a cherry flavour. Very yummy! I even won a blue ribbon at the local fair with this recipe one year. Good stuff. Used Demerara sugar for the brown sugar.

I made this today and bottled it for a gift for my niece.  I did take a small taste though, so I could give it a rating.  The flavor was nice and I can only imagine the tasty cocktails that could be made using this amaretto.  My husband tasted it and said, "Wow that's good.  Where is ours?"  So I'm planning to make some for us too.

Very easy to make and is delicious! Also great for host gifts when going to a party or holiday at someone's house. I have made 2 double batches already. In fact both times I have made it has been a double batch. Reminds me of Sunday's growing up having a shot of Amaretto or Limoncello after every huge dinner!

Tastes great.  Simple.  Will be doing this for many more years.  Thanks for sharing.

The recipe "refilled" our 750 ml of Luxardo Brand Amaretto perfectly.  We used Greys Peak Vodka, which is middle of the road.  My wife and I are making the second batch as I type this - we are labeling it "Bath Tub Amaretto" which our family will giggle at for years to come....

I made this last week and gave it a taste with my brother.   We liked it very much, we both wanted a tad more "amaretto " flavor.  Added a teaspoon more of the almond extract.  Delish.

Best recipe EVER! I made this last year for my husband for Christmas,  he was amazed at how great it was! I bought an inexpensive decanter and it looked so fancy. We drank it with whiskey, soda and even hot chocolate.  The only change I made was to use cherry vodka,  I think it really enhances the flavor!

I love amaretto but don't drink often enough to justify the cost of the real thing. This is wonderful. I made a half recipe  and think that this will go quickly . Looking forward to sipping and to cooking with it. Thank you!

Made this twice.  First time used dark brown sugar and white sugar per others recommendations.  Turned out very tasty but was too dark.  Made it today with light brown sugar and white sugar and it looks exactly like "real"  Amaretto.  We compared the color  of our 2nd batch to our left-over "real" Amaretto and the color and taste  was spot on.   Follow the original recipe and you won't be disappointed.

I doubled the sugar,  tripled the vodka, doubled the vanilla and left the almond extract as is.  

Let it sit for 24 hours.  

I used premium vodka.  

My partner is not fond of the almond flavoring but likes my homemade liqueurs so I made this work.  

I let it sit in a jug and ready to pour in a glass,  full of ice.  

Very fantastic!

I love it.. The only changes I made was, I made it sugar free..I'm doing low carb and I love my couple shots at bed time.. This is very close to the real thing and 2 carbs per serving.. I used splenda for the sugar replacement(same measurements) and I used truvia brown sugar blend for the brown sugar.. Everything else exactly the same..

Delicious and soo easy!  I made this for strawberry shooters on this site.  Fresh strawberries will be in season in Ohio within the next couple of weeks.  I may have to make a new bottle before then!  I used turbinado sugar instead of white and dark brown sugar as suggested by others and think that is what I'll use next time too.  This stuff is great! Thanks for the recipe.

So glad I found this recipe! My husband and I really like disaronno and this is really close. I have to say I used the cheapest vodka available. And it was still good. Next time I'll up the quality, but even so we were pleased. It took longer to bring the sugar and water to a boil than I thought it would. But it eventually did and after that you just mix everything else together. Super easy.

This is an excellent recipe!  I added 1/2 cup water so the simple syrup was a true 1:1 water/sugar ratio and it's perfect - not too sweet, not too watered down, not too boozy.  I also let the simple syrup cool completely (about an hour) before mixing everything up.  I will be making a few more batches to pass out for Christmas presents this year.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!

Use dark brown sugar and make sure you boil it long enough. I personally would use 1/4 c less vodka next time. Otherwise, it's delicious!

OMG, this was awesome.  I made exactly like the recipe called for.  Used dark brown sugar.  I set up my taste test with Disaronno, since that is my go to.  Mine was a tad bit lighter than Disaronno.  It was also a lot smoother.  I normally have to wait for my ice to melt with the Disaronno to take the alcohol bite off.  I will never buy off the shelf again.  This recipe was amazing!

Used exact recipe. Low priced 80 proof vodka worked fine for me. Very easy to make, and quite delicious! I will never pay high prices at liquor store again. 

Look forward to letting a bottle age for a couple months, as suggested by a previous reviewer, that is IF I can wait that long!!! I am thinking triple or quadruple batches, for there to be any chance of AGING!  LOL  :O)~

Thank you original submitter for sharing a GREAT recipe.

Great for a pinch! I don't often have alcohol in the house, and needed this for roasted sweet potatoes. It would be a waste to get a whole bottle for just that. I was able to bring this recipe down to 1 serving to make the recipe. Brilliant!

Make this all the time. Love it in a cup of coffee at night. Also good with hazelnut extract instead of the almond. Make sure to use the dark brown sugar. It makes a big difference.

This recipe rocks.  Absolutely fantastic. Make sure you don't put a little too much vodka in comparison to sugar. It's a small batch, and in a basic glass measuring cup, going over the line with vodka means 1-2 oz more and it makes a huge difference in that perfect flavor. If anything, short the vodka a bit....and DON'T boil the sugar. I did, and it was OK on that batch, big difference.

Okay.  So I wanted something different to hand out for Christmas this year because I have tons of aunts and uncles and and cousins and it gets expensive to buy for them and their significant others, so this year I decided to do the universal gift of ALCOHOL!  This recipe is delicious.  I picked this one because there's so much more you can do with Amaretto besides just making drinks.  You can use it in cookies, cakes, etc.  I have always loved amaretto sours, but I have to tell you, this kicked it up a notch.  Thanks so much for such a delish recipe and one that I can be proud when I hand someone a gift and say, "I made this."

Made this yesterday. So very good! The only thing in this I will change next time I make it will be to reduce the sugar a bit. It's just a little sweeter than I like. Other than that, it's a wonderful recipe!

Love it! I was incredibly happy with how this turned out (not to mention: it is quicker than most liqueurs). I'm definitely making gifts of these! I highly recommend this! Thank you for an amazing recipe!

This is a great recipe, I used dark brown sugar since the recipe didn't specify. It gets better the longer it sits. I made it a week ago and have tested a small bit every day. The taste just gets smoother as it sits. Thanks for a great recipe

This recipe was spot on!. I can't believe how easy it was to make and how thoroughly it resembled premium commercial brands. I used my own home made extracts in place of store bought & let the amaretto mature for a few weeks before serving. Definitely use dark brown sugar!!!Starting a huge batch now for an upcoming family reunion.

Thanks for sharing your recipe, Majory!

This is very yummy! I may never buy Amaretto again. I used dark brown sugar and that gives it a beautiful amber color. This tastes especially good when stored in an empty Disaronno bottle!!

Omg! I absolutely need new glasses! I misread the quantities of vanilla as 2 tablespoons and I doubled the recipe. Then I only had 1 tablespoon of almond extract so this is not going well for me. I wanted to make this for my guests for Christmas but I don't think I can serve it as is. I made my own dark brown sugar with white sugar and molasses so that was not a concern. I was tempted to use a vanilla bean but was uncertain on how much to put in. I am so upset with myself for destroying this recipe because I was really looking forward to trying it. Better luck next time I guess but I will give this recipe a 4 anyway as it smells wonderful!

Outstanding results and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and am very pleased. It tastes just like Disaronno Originale Amaretto (the high-priced brand).

Yummmm. The only problem with this is, it just tastes like 'more'!
Really good sipped from a liquer glass, or added to coffee! Thanks for this easy recipe.

I own a bar and made this recipe, it was terrific my bartender choose the amaretto I made said " it was a lot smother than the other brand". Do not omit the almond extract or substitute it, it gave it that cherry scent and taste.

This tastes exactly the same as Disaronno to me. The only suggestion that I have is to use the dark brown sugar variety. This will darken the color to look more like the real brand name product.

Wow!!! This is an exceptional recipe. You won't regret making it. I will be making it often. I think next time i'm going to try using dark brown sugar to get a more caramel color. Thanks for posting this.
