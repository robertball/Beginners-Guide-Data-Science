This is more like a pie then a cake.  The yeast crust is a very nice change.  Makes a very large pan and is good for a large group.  Will make again.

I had a cup of shredded apples I needed to use up and put that in this recipe instead of the applesauce.  Also, I realized later I only put half the oil in, but decided to leave it like that (they say you can substituted applesauce for half the oil in a recipe....)  My husband said it was "extraordinary".  Usually he says things are "fine" or "good."  Hence the 5 star rating...

Laurel (reviewer) must have been reviewing another recipe because there is neither oil nor applesauce in this recipe.

I made this cake for my book club brunch and they just loved it and about half wanted the recipe.  It is delicious.  Ginny Wilde

I decided to forego the icing and dusted it with cinnamon sugar instead.  I would use a bit less tapioca next time to avoid a gummy texture near the edges - it was easy and delicious!  ... more of a pie than a cake, for sure.

This recipe is a lot of work for the result.  I thought it sounded fantastic and was really disappointed.  Maybe Aunt Lydia has some secret ingredient that is not in this receipe.

It's very hard to classify this.  Is it a cake?  Or, is it a pie, or strudel?  It's actually somewhere in the midst of these.  I can see why it might be called a cake, if frosting is used.  However, I chose to simply dust with confectioner's sugar.  It was very cake-like, kind of crumbly, and the yeast flavor was hard to detect.  My only change was to dice the apples, because I simply misread the ingredients.   A scoop of vanilla ice cream would be a delightful add-on.  I'm sure Aunt Lydia mastered the handling of this delicate, very sticky dough, but it was far beyond my ability.   I just patted the pieces together, and called it done.  The directions say to divide the dough in half, but actually, more is needed for the bottom and sides of the pan. Perhaps a more experienced baker would have been more successful than I, in getting the rolled out dough into the pan in one piece, even using parchment.  It was delicious, though, and DH approved!
