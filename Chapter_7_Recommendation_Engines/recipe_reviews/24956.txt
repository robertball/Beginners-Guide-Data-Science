I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out perfect.  I too cut the butter in half and I also changed the sugar to 1 c sugar and 1 c brown sugar.  I've made it with 2 c brown sugar too.  My family loves the richer taste that the brown sugar gives the caramels.  This is a very easy and fail proof recipe as long as you keep the heat on medium to low

I've made caramels from a few different recipes, and this one is my favorite. I do, however, tweak it quite a bit. First, I only use 1 cup corn syrup. I boil the sugar and corn syrup to 350 degrees, then remove from heat and add butter (only about 1 stick, usually less) and 1 tsp. salt. Then I add the cream to the mixture, but I heat it first. Add the hot cream in a slow stream while stirring constantly, then return to the heat and boil to 250 degrees. Comes out perfect every time.

I really enoyed this recipe "as is". I read several reviews were people had problems with the consistancy of the caramel.  245 t0 250 degrees is the standard for firm ball stage at sea level. If you are above sea level then you should use your thermometer to see at what temperature water boils at your altitude. You then subtract that temperature from the standard of 212 degrees that water boils at sea level. Using that differential, subtract it from the standard 245-250 firm ball stage and that will give you a more accurate temperature of what the firm ball stage is at your altitude. EXAMPLE: I live at 4700 ft. water boils here at 203 degrees. For firm ball at my altitude I shoot for 236 to 241 degrees. Also, you should shut the heat off a few degrees early as the temperature will continue to rise even after you remove it from the heat. I hope that this helps.

My husband, my coworkers and I really dig this recipe. The caramels are fresh, buttery, smooth and addictive. I changed one thing about the recipe, however, and added another step - first, I cook it just a little longer to 245 degrees as opposed to 245. Also, I found that if I "polish" the cut caramels with corn starch that they aren't so greasy.  I do this by coating each one in corn starch and letting them sit for 10-15 minutes and then wiping off the cornstarch with a cloth or paper towel. The starch absorbs the excess grease without changing the flavor or consistency. This also makes them less apt to stick to the wrapper or plate.

This recipe is very easy and results in creamy, chewy caramels that won't pull your fillings out. If you don't get them firm enough or cooked to the right temp the first time, don't be afraid to re-melt it down again and heat it up to the correct temp. These are also great with chopped pecans stirred in and look cute wrapped in wax paper wrappers.

Yummmm!!! I've made a couple batches so far and they keep dissapearing! I found that as long as it's heated to between 238 & 242, they come out so soft and chewy! For a carmel sauce, stop it at about 220-225. I found that I wanted to add an extra dash of vanilla. I add marshmallows to one batch and made Carmarsh and oh was that wonderful... same with the Pecans.

I've made this recipes soooo many times now it's hard to count and everyone loves them!!!  Instead of a 9 x 13 inch pan, I use an 11 x 13 cookie sheet and the size is perfect (plus you get a lot more)!!!  A couple of things - I cook mine to 240 degrees and I make sure that I line my pan with foil first before pouring the caramel into the pan.  Easy to remove and easy cleanup!  Great recipe!!!!!

I have now made these 3 times in a week.  The first time I had to change pans 3 times - make sure you have a BIG pan or it will boil over!!  Needless to say, they came out a little on the soft side.  I used that caramel as filling for my turtles - worked perfectly!  The next 2 times I used a 5 quart kettle.  The only problem I had was it seemed to take forever to get to 242.  I just couldn't wait.  Yummy - 5 Stars from me.

Well worth the time and effort, my family LOVED these caramels.  The first time they came out way too hard, so I let them cool, melted them down and brought them back to the right temperature.  I added pecans, and heating the mixture again didn't hurt the nuts.  Remember to calibrate your thermometer in a pot of boiling water, I live at a really high altitude and my thermometer was off by 12 entire degrees!

It would be good to find out approximately how long this needs to boil until it reaches the proper temperature, as mine took an incredibly long time.  I also wish I'd read the one further review that said to cook in an extra large pan - I had to ladle out some of the mixture half way through the cooking time because it was boiling over.  Also, what temp are you supposed to boil at (without stirring) as my mixture burned on the bottom?

I've been looking for a good caramel recipe for a while now, and I was very pleased with this one.  I, as some of the other reviewers, had to adjust the temperature to which I boiled the sugar mixture in order to ensure a chewey and creamy caramel, but my second attempt came out perfectly even though I didn't have any cream on hand (instead, i used a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and it worked beautifully)  The caramels are extremely creamy and smooth-- i'll most likely make them again.

This recipe was awesome! I've never attempted any type of candy before and didn't have a thermometer, so my advise is to use a big pot, due to it bubbles up so high on a low temp. I had to switch pots in the middle of making it. Once the bubbles go down it begins turning more brown and then you can begin to turn up the heat, I did the drop in cold water gig, and it was the best caramel I have ever had. I also made a major mistake, I thought I was supposed to put it on wax paper and let me tell you, don't make the same mistake, unless you like eating wax paper. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

These were so, so good! They reminded me of Worthers, but softer. I made this candy using my pressure cooker pot. It's large enough to accomodate the volume of the caramel since it expands so much during boil, and heavy enough to regulate and hold the heat. Also, if you don't like the texture you get you can absolutely melt these back down and try again. I made an entire batch of these and was just not quite satisfied with neither the texture nor the color, so I tossed them back in the pot for a bit, added some nuts and they were perfect! Finally, I don't have a candy thermometer so I had to do the cold water test. I read somewhere that you should start testing once the bubbles go from the small frothy ones to the larger more defined bubbles. Whether or not it was just dumb luck I don't know, but that's what I did, and it worked for me. Judi K, my tastebuds, my children and my co-workers all thank you for this yummy treat!

I changed this recipe somewhat and they were delicious.  I used all dark brown sugar for a richer flavor, rather than 1.5 cups corn syrup I used 1/2 cup corn syrup and 1/2 cup honey, also just 1/2 the butter called for.   I cooked it all in a heavy cusinart cast iron pot and it took about an hour or so.  It got rave reviews.   I've now made this three times all with the above changes.  Once I put two squares of unsweetened chocolate in the batch for chocalate caramels.  Yummy  This last time I made a half batch of regular and they are perfect.  I heated them in a 10 inch cast iron skillet which worked great.  Some have mentioned this mix expanding but I've had no issues with it expanding  too much.  Perhaps it's the cast iron containers I use which spreds out the heat more evenly or that I'm not pressing the issue by using too high of heat.  For this last batch I made it only took a half hour or less.  thanks

I  used half the butter that the recipe called for and no vanilla.  I was really pleased with the results.  When the caramel was cool enough to the touch but still pliable, I ripped off pieces and rolled them into little balls.  When the balls were completely cool, I bathed them in good, melted chocolate and left them to cool.  Wow! Little caramel chocolate poppers... what a treat!!

This is such a fabulous recipe! It is hands down my favorite, my go-to recipe for soft caramels. They turn out perfectly every time, and the ingredients are basic and simple and perfect. I make these exactly as written, except I usually skip the vanilla and sprinkle the caramels with some granular sea salt when they are almost firm. So delicious! I also like to dip them in tempered chocolate, and than sprinkle some sea salt on top of the chocolate. Absolutely to die for! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

I was scared to try these as I have never made caramels before.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used Margarine instead of butter.  They turned out great, They do take awile to cook I kept them at a low temp. Very creamy and held their shape well.  I will be making these for teacher gifts for Christmas this year.  A definate keeper!!

I make this recipe each year at Christmas and I follow the directions and ingredients exactly as written.  They are soft, buttery and richer than any store-bought caramel.  I agree with one reviewer that dusting the caramel with cornstarch and letting it sit 5 - 10 minute before dusting them off to reduce the butter on the surface.  I've also cut thin strips and rolled the strip into a snake before winding it around a pretzel rod.  Dip this in chocolate and voile', you have a chocolate caramel pretzel rod Christmas tree.  These always get rave reviews and while I choose low humidity cold days to make candy, & I'm careful with measuring and use an accurate thermometer, the result is I've never had a batch fail.  This is a GREAT recipe for those that are novice candy makers, too. Once you make this, you'll NEVER want store caramel again!

These were butttery and had a nice smooth texture, but they didn't take on the deep caramel flavor I was looking for.  I would try this recipe again with more sugar and less corn syrup, as 1 1/2 cups isn't really necessary to keep the sugar from crystallizing and it doesn't bring that deep caramel flavor.  
That being said, this recipe results in a nice light, buttery, caramel.

I have never, ever experienced homemade caramels that were this unbelievably delicious!!!!!!!!!!  The flavor and the texture were both PERFECT.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and all I used was one of those cheap candy thermometers you buy at the grocery store.  A word of caution:  Use a LARGE heavy saucepan; the mixture expands quite a bit as it gets hotter.

I had never attempted caramels before, and this recipe worked well for me.  I read many of the other reviews and used some suggestions.  I used 1 stick of butter only, and I substituted 1 c of brown sugar for the white.  I was careful to use medium heat to bring to a boil, but after adding the rest of the cream I slowly turned up to medium high, as it was taking a LONG time to heat up.  I went to 238-240 F.  I used a large pot as recommended.  I'll add these to my Christmas repertoire now!

I replaced the corn syrup with honey and molasis and I did not bother with a candy thermometer, I just checked for the hard ball stage. It is a good recipe for playing with, and I plan to make lavender flavored caramels next time.

This is a fantastic caramel recipe! I whipped this up one night when I was really craving caramel apples. I was able to size it down for just two apples (as I'm the only one in my household) and it still came out beautifully. So delicious. I'll definitely be making this again and again. Thank you.

These are sooooo good. Careful with the size of your pot, the first time I used a 4 quart pot, it is too small and when the mix bubbles up it goes over the side and makes a BIG MESS.  Tried second time with an 8 qt pot, worked perfectly.  Instead of the corn syrup, I used Lyle's Golden Syrup, found in baking section or syrup section at the market, it gives a better caramel flavor. Def grease the pan, I used parchment on the bottom, and buttered that a little.  Start at medium and gradually reaise heat after temp reaches 235, if you do on high, med high from the beginning, bottom burns.  Also, stir the whole time hitting the bottom, or mix will get brown flecks/burnt specks in it. As good as anything I have ever bought, and I am a caramel freak. Office staff gave raves!

First, I only use 1 cup corn syrup. I boil the sugar (1/2 brown sugar) and corn syrup to 350 degrees, then remove from heat and add butter (only about 1 stick, usually less) and 1 tsp. salt. Then I add the cream to the mixture, but I heat it first. Add the hot cream in a slow stream while stirring constantly, then return to the heat and boil to 250 degrees. Comes out perfect every time. Pour into greased 11 x 13 pan.

Great recipe. I make this all the time.I used half white and half brown sugar. I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp. of butter flavor. I cooked mine on medium heat, stirring often until it started to boil, then added the remaining cream and left it alone until it reached 248 degrees. This is a good temp for caramel apples. I'd probably cook it until it reached at least 255 degrees for caramels, though.

I made these for Christmas gifts.  They were delicious.  I will add a pinch of salt next time, and I will definately make it again.

excellent recipe-I am always nervous about making caramels because they are an exact science-cook them below the exact temp and they are too soft/cook them too long and they are hard candy. I followed recipe exactly and they were perfect!!! thanks sooo much!!they were a big hit at Christmas

Best caramel recipe I have found.  I like to use 1 cup of light brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar for a little extra caramel flavor.  Each time I make them, at least one person asks for the recipe.  It seems unbelievable that something this easy to make can taste so incredible

This wasnt very caramel tasting. It was good, but it tasted more like corn syrup than anything else. I probably will never make these again. They just didnt have the caramel taste I wanted.

Caution, just like any taffy like recipe - don't mix while cooking except to prevent scorching.  Use a wooden spoon. Keep the thermometer CLEAN and off the bottom. Make sure it is a formable ball rather than soft ball stage.  Turned out great using a slightly adjusted mix - less corn syrup and less butter.  Next AGUAVE SYRUP! INSTEAD OF CORN SYRUP!!!

The flavor of the caramel is incredible, but whenever I cook it up to 242 degrees, it's always too hard, so it's difficult to chew. I live at a high altitude, so that might make a difference. Next time I make it, I'm going to try cooking it to 230, maybe even 225.

WONDERFUL and so simple. One thing, though. My first batch was so greasy with all that butter. I just made my second batch, and I cut the butter in half. They turned out every bit as good as the first batch, but aren't nearly as greasy, or greasy-looking. This will be my signature candy every Christmas from now on. Thank you so much for this easy recipe!

I am so excited to finally find a caramel recipe that turns out perfect!  I have failed for the last three years trying diffent recipes (too hard, too soft and burned one year).  This recipe was super easy to follow.  The hardest part was resisting the urge to not stir once all ingredients were in.  Thank you!!

This recipe is amazing! I was unsure as to how high the heat had to be after adding the second cup of cream but discovered that if the heat was too low the caramel would (obviously) not heat to the correct temperature so I ended up turning up the heat!

Hmmm.  At high altitude (5800 feet) the carmel was overdone at 242 degrees.  Next time I am going to do the drop test sooner.

Excellent recipe!  This recipe has become one of my holiday favorites.  It always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I have been doubling the recipe (using a nice thick copper bottom pot) and adding several cups of toasted pecan pieces.

So, after reading other reviews, I decided to cut the butter in half, add 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and only use 1 cup of corn syrup. It came out DELICIOUS. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!! Seriously. I'm like, beyond novice at candy-making, and these smooth, buttery caramels are the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth. Not stirring goes counter to everything I know, but it WORKS. So completely delicious. I can't believe my first attempt at making caramel came out so good!

I subbed dark corn syrup (I always use this in caramels) and brown sugar for half of the sugar.  Resulted in wonderful, rich caramels.  I also sprinkle some with sea salt for salted caramels.  Yummmmmmmmmmy.  The basic recipe is incredible.  thank you.
I also doubled this recipe, which I don't recommend unless you have helpers for the stirring.  It took 1 1/2 hours for them to come to the right temp.  I now have arms like Popeye!  But, worth it!  Excellent recipe.

These turned out DELICIOUS, someone recommended putting cornstarch on to keep them from being sticky, and that sort of weirded out the taste--- so i wouldn't do that again- maybe i'll just dip them in chocolate- that'll solve the sticky problem

This is a fantastic recipe!  As a novice candy maker I found the ball test in cold water to be more reliable than the candy thermometer.  This recipe is a hit with the family during the holidays.

I am a big fan of homemade caramels and these were wonderful!  The recipe is simple to make and everone loved it.  My only advise would be to use a digital thermometer and remove right at exactly 242 degrees.  Any sooner and they are very soft, buttery and not as caramelly (but still tasty).  Any later and they are very hard to cut and chew (but still very tasty!).  I made these for Christmas gifts and they were very loved.

Can't quite find one reason why I didn't like these.  Didn't like the consistency, I expected a harder chew. Didn't like the corn syrupy flavor behind the carmel and they were too sweet to the point that they were not enjoyable.

"Super Nummy" was the response my sweetie gave to these! (He says he's a picky eater, but seems to like everything I've made so far)

Only modification I made was to use half brown sugar and half white sugar. Oh...and I couldn't resist stirring a bit while it was boiling. I'm visiting him and my candy thermometer is thousands of miles away so I used the cold water method (which I always do thermometer or not) and stopped boiling when it was kind of a firmish soft stringy ball and they are just right.

These are definitely mouth watering (literally) and I'll be using this for the caramel for Turtles this Christmas if all goes as planned.

This is a wonderful recipe! I'll be making these caramels again. I made them exactly as the recipe stated and they are perfect. Great flavor, not greasy at all, glad I left in the butter as called for.

Great recipe.  Since I was making caramel covered apples, I needed more than this recipe called for.  I made another recipe on this site (Chewy Caramel) and ended up combining both of them.  The Chewy Caramel recipe calls for brown sugar and I thought the combination of the two made a spectacular caramel.  I did follow others' advice and reduced the amount of butter by half.  This is a perfect recipe by itself or when combined with one made with brown sugar.  Thanks!

I was very concerned when I read the instructions to not stir after it begins to boil, but I made it as written and could not have been happier with the results.  My friends said that these tasted like the caramels that you buy at the coffee shop.

This is the first year I attempted to make any type of candy.  I started out with a carmel corn recipe that failed and was scared how this would turn out but it was perfect.  I even forgot to add the vanilla but they still tasted great and several people asked for the recipe.  Will definately make them again!

The flavor was great but they came out harder than chewy. I went to 242 degrees so next time I'll try a lower temperature for a softer candy. Very easy to make and well worth the time.

These are wonderful.  We made one batch and plan to make another today or tomorrow!  I did use a heavy, tall pan and was careful not to overcook them.  About 240 degrees gave us a chewy caramel.

This is a relatively simple recipe for making caramel. The only issue that I had was the cook time. It took forever to reach temperature! Will I make it again? Oh yeah! But the next time I will use a larger pot and expect to wait.

I follow the recipe exactly as written using salted butter.  It takes about an hour to get to temperature so be patient and make sure to use a larger pan than you think you need so it doesn't boil over!   8 quarts is great.  I won a Blue Ribbon at the State Fair for this recipe!

This is my favorite recipe...turns out perfectly every time.  I've made it with 1/2 cup butter with similar results.  Also switched to dark corn syrup and half brown sugar for more of a butterscotch taste.  Today I added 4 oz of bittersweet & 2 oz of unsweetened chocolate.  Tastes like tootsie rolls!

I boiled it to 246 degrees and it made a much better candy that can be wrapped in parchment paper.
It took about 30min to cook. 
over all GREAT RECIPE!

I ran out of corn syrup!  So, I used about 3/4 c light corn syrup, about 1/4 c dark corn syrup (ran out of that too), almost 1/2 c honey, and finished off the half cup with real maple syrup.  It tasted excellent, not like dark corn syrup, maple or honey.  It set just fine, though I had to use a couple tablespoons of maple syrup.  Nice and chewy, and easy to wrap in the wax paper.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and instead of 2 cups white sugar I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  Note: watch the temperature carefully, if it's too hot then the caramel will be too hard!  Next time I will maybe coat with chocolate and top with a bit of sea salt.

I have now made these for the 5th or 6th. time.  Each time , getting better and better.  My candy thermometer may be a little off, as 250 is too soft.  Good time though to start testing by dropping in cold water and feeling and tasting the consistency.   This last time I used about 2 cups of cashew nuts at the last minute, and I don't know how to describe the goodness.  This is one that you can honestly say, "You can't eat just one."  I STRONGLY suggest that you use parchment paper in your pan.  No grease necessary and it will NOT stick.  I also use a pastry cutter to cut into pieces.  I also use plastic wrap as long as I can fit on the counter, space the pieces along both edges and roll up to center.  Cut with scissors, then just tear pieces apart to finish the wrap.     As I write this I see it is 242 degrees on thermometer, sorry, it should be slightly above 250.  (MY thermometer may be off, but the water testing is the best)

These are so awesome and so easy!!My first try they were a bit too hard to eat, so I just put them back in the sauce pan, mixed in a little more cream and they set up to the perfect texture. Now that is a forgiving recipe. The color is beautiful. The light gold hue did throw me off, since I thought the mixture needed to cook more. Go by your thermometer not your eye.

These have wonderful flavor and are relatively simple to make but the temp is a bit off. I cooked to the reco temp and mine are still a bit chewy but kind of hard (I was hoping for a softer candy) so next time I will test during the end stage rather than relying on the temperature. With some experimenting this will make for a nice solid recipe =))

These are very tasty...at least the part stuck to my spatula was!  They are in the fridge cooling as I type.  I cooked on low so I didn't burn the caramels, but it took over an hour to get to 242.  I cranked the heat up gradually to get it to boil faster, but still kept it no higher than level four on my cooktop.

These caramels are delicious. They are a tad bit on the oily side, so next time I will cut down on the butter. I cook to 240 for a perfect caramel.

I followed this recipe to a T and ended up with a sloppy mess.  I was very disappointed after reading the great reviews as I ended up with a sloppy mess.  I made absolutely sure that the temperatures were exact.  Don't waste your time (or money) on this one.

YuMMMMMMMMM, tastes like "Werther's" (sp?)  Oh yummy, mine haven't set up yet, but the taste is amazing.  Definately don't take any shortcuts on this one, REAL BUTTER, CREAM, VANILLA  THank you for this amazing recipe.  Oh, and I used Dark Karo syrup, since it didn't specify.

absolutley awesome caramels. Only just starting with making candy and it i was very pleased with teh results. My first batch was way too soft tho, but that was my own fault. First time working witha candythermometer and cheated 3-4 degrees. Too soft, but did gave me awesome ideas about making it as piefilling. Keeping it in the freezer now to reuse later. Was patient on the 2nd batch and added some pecans with it. It was perfect. I did only use 2/3 of the butter tho, seemed plenty and it was.

Turned out a little soft but it was very tasty.  I added pecans and that toned down the sweetness of the caramels.  Very good.

This recipe tastes very delicious. It has a wonderful buttery richness. I halved the recipe and used an 8 x 8 pan, and it still turned out well. I didn't have a candy thermometer, but luckily I didn' cook it too longt; it has the perfect, chewy consistency. I will definitely make these again.

Yummy! I lost my mom's recipe for caramels and this one was just like it. You have to watch the cooking time, each year I have to make two batches because the first one never turns out right. (My candy thermometer was broken.) This is a great recipe! I'll make these again, each year for Christmas. They're great to give as gifts.

These are delicious caramels, but either they are supposed to be gooey at room temperature, or I didn't cook long enough. We have to keep them refridgerated. They also are not very dark, so next time we're going to substitute in some brown sugar and a little less butter and see how they turn out.

I've made this recipe twice, and so far I haven't really liked it. It had a slight caramel taste, but mostly just tasted like sugar and corn syrup. Very one dimensional. It was edible at least, just not very good. Also, despite cooking it to exact temp, it turned out pretty hard. Like, so hard I had trouble cutting it and worried that it would pull fillings out. I don't think I'll be making this one again.

For first timers, the main thing to succeed is to understand your elevation to sea level and test your thermometer to ensure it is accurate.
My glass candy thermometer had water at a rolling boil at only 180°F!! That's nuts because I'm at about 300 ft elevation from sea level, and if that thermometer was correct I should be at 5000 ft in the mountains!

I love the cream and vanilla in this recipe, it's a lovely buttery caramel! Thanks for the recipe!

Is a really good recipe. Everyone loved it and it makes a great gift for your neighbors. Adding sea salt or sugar on the top before cooking is a great idea.

These remind me of the SEE’s candy caramels so much!
Such an  easy to follow recipe! If anyone gives this recipe less than (5) FIVE STARS it has to be due to user error. Like in my case, I got ahead of myself & just read add the cream & missed the part that said one cup of the cream! I wanted to ask if I should continue, or what might happen, or if I ruined the whole batch & should start over but decided to press on (since most of the posts were from a dozen years ago!) & after it was boiling a while added another 1/4 cup of cream & waited & waited & waited! 
You don’t think it’s ever going to change color, it stays light for a long time. But I just kept watching the candy thermometer & doing softball tests in the water. & wahlah! I(I also had a small canning jar that I used just before it hit the softball stage for a caramel sauce to have in the fridge!) & right when it hit the softball stage I  took it off the stove, added the vanilla & poured over walnuts & it is the closest recipe I’ve found to taste exactly like the SEES Caramels!
I do have a feeling that once it hit the temp indicated, you have to time it perfectly  or you could burn it or end up with caramel sauce, which wouldn’t be a total loss!
I think  continuing to testing by dropping  it in water & watching the temp is key. And I think it depends on a  your stove etc. but someone asked how long to cook it. I think all in all it was a good 30 minutes before it reached the correct temp.  From start to finish.

It was fairly simple to make. I did have to leave it out for a night before it was room temperature. It was also somewhat hard to cut. But overall it had a great taste.

It’s delicious! My first time making caramel candy and this is a simple no fail recipe. I the only problem I ran in to is what heat to use, and how long to let us cook until 240. But I’m a baker by trade so I figured it out using the 1.5 parameters as a timeline basis and I’m happy as can be. I love caramels.

I used brown sugar, of course. :) I wouldn't even contemplate using white. I hadn't made caramels in a long time, so when I came across this recipe I had to try. Glad I did too! These are really wonderful. I am accustomed to using condensed milk to make caramels, but I think this recipe is better. It has been a long time, but yes, I think it's better. I was thinking to dip these in chocolate, but they are so good on their own. Thank you for sharing! Note: My 9"x13" cake pans are old as the hills, so I lined with tin foil and wasn't skimpy with the butter I used to prevent sticking. A bit of a problem at the edges because I wanted more of a toffee consistency so the candy set quickly, and ridges in the foil got caught up in the candy. It was a bit of a hassle, but I didn't want candies with sloping edges, and that's what I would have had if I'd used my glass pan. Parchment would have worked well, but I didn't have any of that on hand either! I think I'll have to break down and buy some new metal cake pans. The peeling teflon on those old pans is really scary!

Excellent base recipe--- but other reviewers comments made even better. Subbed brown sugar.  ! cup of corn syrup, followed the second cup of warm cream to be added after the first boil  Thanks for the tips on tested my thermometer. The tootsie roll approach worked when cutting it into pieces.( roll it then cut it) I used icing sugar instead of corn starch to remove the greasy feel  and didn't have to wrap it. Thanks every one good recipe and super tips.

Easy recipe with delicious results!  I probably cooked it a little too long as the color was darker than the caramels in the pictures.  I made a half batch in an enamel -coated pot. I t took about a half hour from start to finish. I added a couple of sprinkles of kosher salt to the mix. A half batch  made enough caramel to dip 8 medium-sized fresh-picked apples.  The results made the perfect fall treat!  This recipe will go into my files - with a note to myself to pull it off the heat before it gets too dark.

This recipe turns out every time. I use a 3-quart enamel-coated cast iron pot. Sometimes I use half white sugar and half brown sugar; sometimes I use all white sugar. My family enjoys the candy both ways. I allow the mixture to reach 240 degrees because we like soft caramels.

The flavor was  great. I think I may have cooked it a little longer than needed. I will definitely make it was again.

I really loved this recipe. I split the 2 cups of sugar with 1 sugar and 1 brown sugar packed. The caramel was delicious and soft. I think I should have cooked it for maybe a couple of more minutes but that will be next time so it would set better. But even though it was pretty soft everyone loved it and was gone very quickely.

Made this to dip with apples so I didn't allow it to dry. Tasted great and was grateful it didn't use any condensed milk.

I love this. I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar. The flavor is perfect. Use a large sauce pan so you can cook it without worrying about it boiling over. Make sure you cook this for long enough or it won't become solid and if you cook it for too long it will be hard candy. If you don't cook for long enough you can put it back in a pot and cook it longer.

VERY easy to make. The only alteration I made was with flavoring.
 If you mess up and dont heat it to the right stage you can remelt it and take it higher. Its a favorite treat of mine.  You can also use different candy flavorings. Ive used english toffee which tastes like a heath bar and strawberry.

Oh, yum.  Do not leave me alone with these, ha ha.  I was a bit anxious about making these, but they turned out amazingly well.  Great consistency.  Read reviews and tweaked by using half of the butter, 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar.  Made sure not to use a nonstick pan.  The caramel seemed to stay at 216° forever.  I walked away to tidy up the kitchen.  When I stopped obsessing, ha ha, the temperature slowly started to rise.  Took about half an hour or more having the burner set at 4 on the dial.  Will make these again.  May have to ;)  I intend to bring them as a hostess gift for Thanksgiving.  Not sure they will last till then!!!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Good recipe.  I don't know if it's the best since this is my first time making caramels.  I cooked until 244 degrees which in my opinion gave them the perfect consistency.  Soft yet not stick to your teeth chewy...at room temperature.  I wrapped them in some pre-cut parchment paper I purchased...from King Arthur.  It made wrapping the candies quick easy work!  One other thing that may avoid the greasy problem...which I had as well.  I literally scraped about a 1/2 tsp of butter off the top after they cooled.  I googled the problem and read if you shock the temp too much the butter can separate from the sugar.  It recommended adding the cream at a slow rate so you don't change the temperature too much.  I know mine cooled down quite a bit after I added the other half of cream.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I doubled the batch but didn't need to.  It covered 24 small to medium Macintosh Apples.  They were a hit!!! Thank you.  Note:  When you double the batch it does take a lot longer to get to the right temperature on the candy thermometer.

I've used this recipe half a dozen times and every time they come out better than I remembered them to be. There so easy I melt the butter first then add the cream so I have something to mix the sugar and karo syrup with. I put it on med for the first 10-15 min then drop it down to med-low and put the candy thermometor on the pot and let it do the rest, checking the temperture often. It took a good 40-45 min.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and used exact ingredients & measurements. My caramels did not set up at 242 degrees as recommended in the recipe. I was quite disappointed so I scraped the candy out of the pan back into the pot  stirring until melted. Then I cooked it to 250 degrees without stirring. It turned out perfect. After the candy began to set in the fridge I began seeing the excess butter on the top so I covered the caramel with napkins on the top while it finished cooling. Everyone loved them and I will make again!

This is the best caramel recipe I have ever made!  The past couple of years I have been making another recipe and it just didn't have the right flavor...this one is PERFECT!!  I used all the ingredients just as called for and I heated until 250.  I used this to make homemade turtle treats but am going to make another batch for the pure enjoyment of caramels by themselves!  This is the best!

This was some pretty good caramel! It was more than what I thought it would be. My kids loved it and keep asking for more. I added it to my apple pie and it was awesome. Next time I will add even more.

I used heavy cream that came from our goat Myrna.  I had never made candy before and was suspicious by how easy the recipe seemed and how the consistent the reviews were.  Despite some guesswork in heat level and timing, these caramels are absolutely the best I've ever had.  Their consistency is perfect and they melt in your mouth with hardly a chewing.  I stuck to the recipe but am looking forward to trying some of the tips other reviewers mentioned, hoping to make them less unhealthy.   No matter if I'm successful or not, these delicacies will be served in our family for a very long time.

This makes amazing caramels! Just as good (if not better) than the boutique caramels you buy for a high price. I made these and gave them in a gift bag to my colleagues for a Christmas present and they were a big hit. I did have to heat them to the "hard ball stage" as I followed the recipe exactly the first time and they came out too runny, but at the hard ball stage, they were perfect caramels.  I will be making this recipe every year for Christmas!

I have to admit that I cheated and stirred (only once or twice, I couldn't help myself!)after adding the heavy (whipping) cream the second time. 

The bottom of my pan required much scrubbing, HOWEVER, it was worth the effort. These are the most awesome caramels. 

Next time, I promise not to stir and see if that prevents the extra "scrub-time."

Mine turned out very oily, maybe if I had used less butter it would have turned out better.  They were even on the hard side though I followed the directions.  My kids did think they were great.

Excellent!  This was the favorite recipe I have made so far.  I did not follow the directions exactly, and this also was my first time doing the ball drop test since I had no candy termometer- it turned out perfect.  I added roasted salted sunflower seeds and the flaver combo was pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!
