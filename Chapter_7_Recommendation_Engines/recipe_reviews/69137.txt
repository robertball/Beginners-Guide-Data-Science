I did a search using the word "Irish," looking for a side to go along with reuben sandwiches for St. Patty's Day. We were most pleased! I'm certain this will be an annual dish, and I may even cook it during the year, occasionally. After tasting, I chose to add onion powder, lemon pepper, celery salt, seasoning salt, and garlic salt.  I also increased the # of garlic cloves, but that's just a personal preference. Thanks for a great addition to our holiday!

I served this potato dish for St. Patrick's Day.  Some people had corned beef and others had mushroom chicken.  These potatoes were loved by all their perfect.  My dad was kind of shocked to see the cabbage and potatoes together instead of separate but he said  he preferred the potatoes and cabbage together now.  It's a keeper.

Ok I didn't have any cabbage but had some leftover brussels sprouts I had roasted with lemon, garlic and dill. Boiled and mashed my red skin potatoes as usual with sour cream, butter and rice milk. Then I heated and mixed in my leftover brussels sprouts. Wow!! I can't stop eating it even though I'm full! I love Colcannon with regular cabbage and with brussels sprouts it's totally awesome. Then again anything mixed into mashed taters is pretty awesome! Give the sprouts a try, you won't be sorry!

This was really good, although I think it could stand to be a little creamier. Definitely season it generously with salt and pepper. I don't eat a lot of meat, so I actually had this for dinner tonight - it doesn't have to be just a side!

Mixing two of my favorite sides... mashed potato and steamed cabbage... how could I go wrong? This was great, easy and affordable. I didn't change a single thing about this one. No need to!

I have made this twice now and I have to say this is really delicious!! The combo of the potatoes and cabbage is perfect and something different yet so easy to make. It is a great dish for any meal but of course anything Irish, German or the like! I halved the recipe and made coleslaw with the rest of the cabbage. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Simple and delicious.  This pleases everyone in the family, age 10 to 80.  I've made this many times, and it's even good without the green onions and garlic.  Other recipes I've seen call for boiling the cabbage, but I prefer the steaming method here for color and nutrient retention.  It's just good, simple, Irish pub food.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is SO delicious, a big hit with the family. I made it exactly as directed with the addition of 6 slices cooked and crumbled bacon. The only other thing I did was to leave the potatoes somewhat chunky because we like our mashed potatoes that way. These are great reheated too.

A delicious side that I served with Kielbasa. This stuff fills you up quickly though.  I halved the recipe and assume it should make a decent leftover. The fiance doesn't like cabbage and this didn't necessarily mask it so she wasn't a fan.

I cut this recipe in half and cut the butter and FF sour cream WAY down. I used 1/4 c. hot FF milk to help make these potatoes fluffy without the added fat. This was a nice side to the Bacon Nut Meatballs, which I also found on this site. I wanted a colcannon recipe without ham or bacon.....this was a nice replacement.

This was really yummy and quick to make. I mean, it really isn't rocket science to put cabbage in mashed potatoes, but somehow the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. I'd totally make this again. Yummy!

I've been intrigued by the idea of colcannon since I saw my first colcannon recipe.  I like all the ingredients, but would have never put them together on my own.  My picky husband is out of town, so I figured now was the perfect time to try it.  I loved it!!  I had it with meatloaf (which he also doesn't care for a great deal).  The only change I made is that I had to add milk to the potatoes, as they were awfully stiff.   Could be due to the kind of potatoes I used.

This was terrific!  I have never had colcannon before, but my husband and I both loved it. I gave it 4 stars because I made the mashed potatos the way we always do.  The yogurt just did not help me get the right consistency for our taste.

Can't go wrong with mashed potatoes and cabbage.  I omitted the garlic; we are not garlic lovers, but that was personal preference.  Leftovers were very good, also.  Thanks for posting a great recipe.

Colcannon is a favorite dish of ours.  (Never had it until AR, but have made it many times since discovering it).  This is a very good one with the addition of sour cream, butter and green onions.  Served this as the side dish to 'Big Al's Chicken & Blackened Cinnamon BBQ Chicken', both AR recipes.  I thought it was better than both of the chickens.

I have made colcannon without  sour cream or milk when I need a parve dish and it still comes out terrific. I eat this as a main dish most of the time,but it goes wonderfully with crispy oven fried fish or chicken. Cabbage and potatoes are an excellent partnership.

Fantastic!  I scaled this down to 8 servings and made no changes to the recipe.  Since I LOVE cabbage, I'd increase the amount next time.  I used lite sour cream and was generous with the salt and pepper.  This came together in no time - I'll most definitely make again.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good! I usually spring for regular sour cream since using real butter is a must for mashed potatoes. Also a yellow onion works fine if you don't have green onions on hand. Goes well as a side dish for corned beef, meatloaf or pork chops.

This is delicious. After boiling the potatoes, I sauteed the garlic/onions/cabbage in an iron skillet, reserving the cabbage water. I added some of the cabbage water to the potatoes,  to make them creamy and added lemon pepper seasoning. Served with corned beef on St. Patrick's Day, (fresh fruit for dessert,) it was a hit with the entire family! We will make this throughout the year.

I will give this recipe 4 1/2 stars also.  Really tasty and a different way of serving veggies. Will make again.

I had to use regular onion (about 3/4 cup) instead of green onion and left the butter out but had some at the table.  I used , fat free sour cream, about 1/2 cup of milk for the potatoes and added leftover smoked sausage with the cabbage.  The mashed potato part was surprisingly delicious considering it was fat free, but the cabbage part was oddly sweet and had a tinge of bitter.  I think the sweetness may have come from sort of sauteing the cabbage before steaming it.  Next time I'm going to try boiling the cabbage since I can't seem to get it right!  I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe.

A really great recipe.  I loved it.  I only used half the amount of butter because I thought an entire stick was too much.

This recipe was great! I used chopped kale  instead of cabbage. My husband (who hates veggies) loved this recipe and asked me to make it again. It's a great recipe to sneak greens into your diet, and it's a great meal in itself.

Made this for the first time yesterday for St. Paddy's Day!  Was a tasty hit, even though I might have inadvertently "over caramelized" the onions and cabbage. This may have intensified the flavour in a good way. Will definitely try this recipe again, without "over-caramelizing".

Our family really liked this also! I used some fresh kale along with cabbage which gave a nice splash of color and more healthy ingredients.  This was a great way to use up some bounty from our farm share!

Pretty good; made it for St. Patty's Day.  I also added some tempeh that had been sauteed in liquid smoke to get sort of a bacon-y flavor to add protein for a main dish.  I don't think I'd want to eat it every day, but it is about as Irish as a vegetarian dish can get, so we may make it every year.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day potluck luncheon at the office, adding a bit of green food colour.  I must have done something wrong, because rather than steamed cabbage, I got mostly sauteed cabbage.  I followed the directions as written, but maybe I was supposed to add water...?  No matter, the end results was quite tasty.  A side note: several people commented that they couldn't even taste the cabbage, and that they thought it was all just skin-on mashed potatoes.

I love potatoes and cabbage but this did nothing for me.
