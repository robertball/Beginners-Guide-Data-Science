Antoher shape for this cookie is like a leaf with cut sides. Another favorite is to add a topping to this of powered sugar with evaporated milk, lemon juice, lemon rind and melted butter.

This recipe was helpful but the pine nuts were overberring.

This didn't really taste as I expected it to. I thought it would be sweet. I didn't really taste the figs, and it had an unusual smell. Unfortunately, I will not be making this again.
