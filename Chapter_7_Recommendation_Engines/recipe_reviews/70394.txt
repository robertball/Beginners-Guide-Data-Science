OK, here's the deal.  This is the best sandwich ever, but it has to be done right.  There are 2 essential and 2 secondary things people are missing.   Essential 1: real peanut butter - this means no sugar added (not sweetened factory goo) - it's just ground up peanuts (with maybe some salt and palm oil). Sweetened peanut butter spoils the bite of the cheese (see below).  Essential 2: hot sauce - the sandwich is to be dipped in hot sauce.  Not crazy habanero but-in-the-tub stuff, liquid-y hot sauce like Cholula or Tapatio.  It provides essential softness and flavor.  Secondary 1: sharp cheddar cheese only - preferably extra sharp, good cheddar (like Tillamook). The cheese has to compete with your good, real peanut butter.   Secondary 2: whole wheat bread - with the powerful elements of real peanut butter, extra sharp cheddar, and hot sauce, white bread just can't hold its own.  Enjoy!  Convert your friends - they will be appreciative, eventually. Oh, and it goes great with a fresh-from-the-fridge Pabst tallboy.

This actually is a great tasting sandwich. My kids and I love it BUT we don't ever use cheddar cheese. We always use american. I think for some of those who didn't like it, that might have made a difference. The cheddar is too harsh for this to me. Sliced american blends much better.

Prof positive that college students have way too much time on their hands.  I read this recipe and thought it sounded really bad, but I gave it a shot anyway. And it really wasn't that bad.  Kind of like a really good Dr. Seuss book.  I probably won't make it again but if you are feeling adventurous give it a shot.

I threw the sandwhich together, flipped it on my GeorgeForman grill for 5 minutes, rotated 45 degrees, 3 more minutes (gives it a nice diamond grill pattern) and done.

I'm not a fan of beef so this combo has been my stand-in for over 60 years. Also llike to add tomatoes, or deviled ham, or bacon. Both cheese AND peanut butter blend with everything, so why not experiment? Try it, you'll like it!!

I love these, I also eat peanut butter on my bologna sandwiches though (with mayo, cheese and peanut butter), people think I'm strange yes, I used American cheese (sandwich cheese) and it turned out great, I'm a peanut butter lover though, on waffles, pancakes..whatever!!

What an amazing disappearing act that my toddler played on this sandwich. I set it in front of her, she inspected it like a detective looking for clues, peeled the bread apart, sniffed, then took a tiny nibble. In the blink-of-an-eye I turned back, and the entire sandwich was gone! "It's in my tummy, Mommy!" she said, w/ a gooey-peanut-butter grin. OK, now onto what I think helped make it 5-stars (since Mommy made herself one too) - I used Whole Foods freshly-ground honey-roasted Peanut Butter, Jarslburg cheese, and honey-wheat bread. Bizarre combination = blissful comfort food.

Read the reviews and thought i'd take a chance. My kids love grilled cheese but didn't care for this at all. I appreciate going outside the box, though. Maybe next time.

It's easier to spread the butter one side of the first piece and slap it into the pan. Then spread the peanut butter on the slice of cheese and slap that on the bread in the pan. Then breat the second slice of bread and drop it, butter side up, on top of the peanut butter covered cheese. Bamo, done!

I actually discoverd this idea by accident... I was hungry and low on groceries, but had some shredded cheddar, PB, and wheat bread. I didn't toast it, but it was surprisingly delicious! After making a second one, I just had to see if I was strange or if others in the world had discovered this delicious treat! Sure enough... here it is! Great, easy, cheap, filling, delicious recipe!

This was fine for a change, but it's not something I would eat on a regular basis. I think the texture of the hot peanut butter takes away from the melty cheese texture, making the whole thing just too runny. The flavours were fine, though, and I enjoyed trying something different. Thanks!

Awesome! I didn't use cheddar cheese, which would probably have been better, but I used Muenster and it was still good. I used a whole wheat english muffin as my bread and it was very good!

I've been doing this for years! My co-workers used to laugh at me - makes a good, quick breakfast "to go", lots of protein and calcium to hold you to lunch!  If I eat it at home, I must have milk with it; somehow it just goes together!

This is just fine, but for a real taste sensation you need to try a peanut butter and egg sandwich. It will make your taste buds sooooo happy. Fry the egg and bust the yolk till just not runny and place on toast with peanut butter...YUM::YUM

I like grilled cheese and I like peanut butter. But together? Heck, why not! I was quite surprised, too. It was very good. I didn't fry quite as long as the recipe called for. Maybe my pan was a little too hot. But it called for a good sandwich. The peanut butter wasn't runny at all. I had to use American since I didn't have the Cheddar and on top of that I used 2 slices. Yum!

I went on a "weird pb sandwich" escapade today & tried this one.  Made it on sourdough bread with sharp cheddar cheese & you know what...it was actually good!  Hooray for trying new things!  :)

ewww! I like grilled cheese qute a bit.  I also love a piece of hot piece of toast with peanut butter. Mixing them makes for a disgusting combination. My dad made these for me as a child; I sat for hours trying to choke this down.  When dad left the room, I threw it away...hoping he wouldn't find out!

I love these sandwiches!!! I use multi grain bread and serve sliced apples on the side. SOOO yummy and gooey. I disagree that you should use american cheese. Cheddar is totally the way to go. It's like those cheddar pb crackers that you buy but bigger and gooey and warm. OMG, I think I have to go make one now.

This was okay. It was gooey and keep a napkin nearby as it is a bit messy too with the warm pb. Something different from plain grilled cheese.

Glad to see I'm not the only one who enjoys a PB and Cheese sandwich. My mom used to make them for me and I've been eating them for years. However, I never thought to grill them up w/ butter before...delish!!! I used to just toast the bread, but frying it up with butter is a great improvement. The slight sharp, salty, tanginess of the cheese cuts the sweetness of the peanut butter and balances it out nicely. I would make this again!

I book marked this because it sounded so absurd.  I made it because I had nobody else to cook for and thought, 'what the hell.'  I rated it 5 stars because it was OUTSTANDING.  I had to take 2 bites because I wondered if my taste buds were failing me or just horribly confused.  To top off the gross factor I grabbed a bottle of buffalo sauce from the fridge and filled a ramekin to dip the sandwich in.  Marvelous.  Hallie_Toronto, you are not insane, you are a genius, okay maybe a little insane to have tired this to begin with.

Surprisingly good. I used an organic peanut butter (crunchy) and an extra sharp cheddar on whole wheat bread.

I have been making this for my son for 16years.  I was told to do it from WIC due to his low iron count. I do use less butter.  I find buttering both slices of the bread placing butter side together then spreading the peanut butter much easier.

We made this because it was just too weird. it has turned out to be one of my sons favorite snacks! It tastes similiar to those bright orange cheese crackers with PB you buy, only very fresh and gooey! We just use american cheese and they are great! Texas toast bread is a good bread to use!! Wonderful high protein kids snack!

Just finished this and it was okay.  I wouldn't say it was delish or anything but, it satisfied my snacking need for the moment.  I used non-dairy, soy American cheese b/c of allergies.  It was different.  I'm not sure if I'll make it again but, I'm glad for the recipe anyways.

This recipe goes back at least as far as 1870. I was the favorite sandwich of Bill Carver manager of the Troy Haymakers One of the first Professional Baseball teams.

I eat grilled cheese everyday. I also eat peanut butter everyday...so I decide to try them together.

Not a big fan. Some bites went down easier than others. I ate the entire sandwich. I would not say it was gross, just not appealing to me. So, 3 stars.

I can't believe there are people besides my husband that eat this.  I don't hate them, but it's not something I'd make for myself.  My husband loves them, so I'm giving it 3 stars as a compromise.

Yummy!  This makes a great after workout snack--I use 100% whole wheat bread, real peanut butter (ground peanuts from Whole Foods), & a cheddar American cheese mix.  No butter--just toast the bread, add the cheese & pb, then broil til done.  Protein, fast burn carbs, & calcium--delicious perfection!

i LOVE grilled cheese and peanut butter sandwiches, but i prefer them grilled on pita bread and grilled with bean sprouts and tomatoes (and i really prefer swiss or colby jack cheese).  

either way, a great start to a really delicious sandwich.  : )

I love peanut butter, cheese, & egg sandwiches, but it never occurred to me to add peanut butter to a traditional grilled cheese. I found it blends best with wheat bread. Excellent sandwich so don't let the seemingly odd combination put you off of trying it.

It's good, but i prefer to make a standard grilled cheese with white bread and american and then just top it with peanut butter and pair it with a glass of milk. My father always topped his grilled cheese with peanut butter and it's just so delicious. and I never eat american cheese.

Meh, frankly I prefer a straight grilled cheese. Wasn’t bad but wasn’t outstanding either. Guess it depends on your personal preference. Wasn’t bad but wasn’t better than normal grilled cheese.

I like cheese and I like PB but I was having a hard time in mind thinking the combo would go together. So I tried it first w/o the cheese and had grilled PB. Pretty good. Maybe I'll work up to adding cheese to half of the sandwich next time.

I love PB, but I never thought of combining it with cheese. I gave it a shot, used real cheddar cheese, and it was delicious! I think using the processed cheese would've been a mistake. My picky kids loved this too. Good way to give them a little protein boost. I really recommend trying it, you never know if you'll end up loving it!
