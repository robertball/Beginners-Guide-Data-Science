This is soooo much better if you use 1.5-2 cans of orange juice concentrate and a bottle of cranberry juice cocktail. You cannot taste the vodka in this drink. Drink slowly because this will get you drunk very quickly!

Yowza!!!  This was WAY too strong for us.  I think you need to use frozen OJ concentrate to make this palatable.  We salvaged it by adding a 3:1 ratio of frozen slush to more regular OJ...

Altered the number of servings to serve 15 and put in a punch bowl for a Christmas party. Everyone loved it.
