Great stuff but made some adjustments (just trust me on this...the result is great!!). In addition to the chicken I added 8oz shell noodles cooked. For the sauce mix I added 1/4 cup sour cream and 1 can cream of chicken and instead of water chesnuts I added a jar of diced pimentos. The increase in the "substance" required me to increase in a sauce to prevent dryness! This is almost like a recipe my mom used to make and the addition of noodles/sauce allows it to go a long way! I have served this to my boyfriends family(not kidding they ONLY eat meat and potatoes) and they grudgingly had to admit that they loved this too and she even requested the recipe (my jaw is still on the ground). Thanks for helping me find a lost recipe...even though I had to make some changes!!

Very good. Been using it as a guide for years. I omit the mushrooms and add a can of cream of chicken soup (reduced fat). I use more onion and cheese (reduced fat). For the mayo I use reduced fat here also but usually add some milk now. Most of the time I shred the chicken instead of cubing it. Hubby insists that I add pepper also. I used to always do the crushed potato chips on top but here recently I have been putting crushed butter crackers on top as we have tried to start eating healthier.

This was excellent I did add a small amount of cooked shell noodles. The water chestnuts add such a nice crunch. I am not a Mayo fan so I did use Miracle Whip instead.

This is a keeper! My husband loved it. My picky kids (ages 1 &3) opted for chicken fingers but that goes for most every meal at our house. I love this recipe. It would be good to double and serve to a group of people or make for a potluck. It's fairly simple and I have made it ahead and put it in the frig for dinner. My Pampered Chef food chopper chopped the chicken up really small and I liked the texture of the casserole that way. I highly recommend this one!

What a find! This is absolutely one of the best casseroles I have made. I would double the batch so you could freeze one. We don't ever seem to have any leftovers since everyone goes back for seconds.

This was SO good! I didn't have any potato chips so I used tostitos instead and it turned out excellent! If you do this add less or no salt! I also added extra cheese. This is now a regular meal at our house and I now add different veggies to it too!

i used leftover chicken salad for this and it turned out pretty good. i recommend adding spices but this is a good base recipe and something i wouldnt have thought of making on my own. i added worcestershire cajun seasoning a few dashes of hot sauce and used french fried onions as the topping. i a m giving this 3 stars because my fav parts of it were the hard boiled eggs and french fried onion rings which werent even part of the recipe

This recipe is great but I would definitely use sharp cheddar cheese for flavor. I also found it a little dry and needing more mayonaise. Other than that it's delicious.

My husband is NOT a casserole man...BUT when he had this his response was "What was that casserole? That was really good!" 21 yo daughter said the same thing (but picked out the mushrooms);) Made it again and again and have had ladies asking for the recipe. This is great for a church fellowship dinner- pot luck style. I used more onions and chopped them rather than grated them. Great flavor. Also used buttered bread crumbs for the topping (didn't have chips on hand). This is a hit that we will use over and over.

Oh My We just had this and it was sooo good. Here are my changes. Sauted the celery onion (added more) and almonds (added more) for about 5 minutes with no butter in my nonstick pan. It makes the almonds more crunchy and softens the onions and celery a little. I diced the water chestnuts. My sauce was 1/4 cup lowfat mayo and 1/2 cup yogurt 1 can cream of chicken soup. I sprinkled it with curry powder and garlic salt. I topped with crushed corn flakes. Was delicious.

Delicious and very easy!! I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder salt and pepper before cooking it on the stove in olive oil. I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the mayonnaise and canned mushrooms. My boyfriend and I are usually not big on leftovers but we ate this dish for dinner then lunch and dinner the next day and were sad to see it gone. Will definitely make this again!

This was really good. My boyfriend doesn't like "creamy" dishes but I made it anyway and he LOVED it. Per Dregnik I used sour cream and a cream of ____ soup (I used cream of celery and cream of chicken and mushroom). We ate it over rice and it was great. Next time I think I'll shred my cooked chicken and eat this as a hot sandwich over some nice bread rolls. Thanks for making my partner a "convert"!

Very good with some changes: I added white rice (half cup uncooked about a cup cooked); some garlic powder about 1 tsp of hot sauce substituted cream of broccoli soup for most of the mayo but did add about a tbsp of mayo as well. About a half cup of milk to keep it from being too dry. Some parsley flakes and a touch of dill and ground black pepper. I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning while cooking and like many of the reviewers incorporated some of the cheese right into the casserole and sprinkled a little on top. My husband who hates water chestnuts didn't even know they were there (I chopped them up very fine) but loved the overall crunch. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't add the water chestnuts mushrooms and almonds. I added more onion about a 1/2 cup finely chopped then sauteed the onion and the celery until slightly softened. I also added black pepper and garlic powder. Served it along side crusty french bread.

I did not care for this at all. It was very bland and the warm mayonaise was a bit more than I could handle. It seemed like it was missing a lot of substance. It needed something--like rice or noodles or to be served on toast. Definitely won't be making this again.

A friend raved about this recipe so I wanted to give it a try. I started off making the recipe as directed but there wasn't enough sauce and it tasted a little bland. So before I put it in the baking dish I added some basil thyme marjoram and summer savory; and not liking the idea of a ton of hot mayonnaise I added a can of cream of chicken soup for additional liquid. My son Mr. Pickypants really liked it; but me not so much. Sorry! It was an intriguing idea.

This is delicious I've made it twice the first time exactly as the recipe and we all love it. The second time I added 1 1/2 cups left over precooked rice and 1/2 cup chicken stock it was great as well and feeds a few more or some to freeze. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is one of my "go to" recipes when having guests. It gets raves every time I make it and I have shared the recipe with several. The only change I make is to use 2 10 ounce cans of chicken breast meat as a time saver. Sometimes I leave the potato chips off if no kids involved.

This was quite good but I found it to be a bit dry. I followed the recipe as written but next time I will add a can of cream of something soup to make it a little creamier. I will also likely add 1/4 cup of sour cream per another reviewer's suggestion. I think this dish could easily rate a 5 with a couple of small alterations. Thanks for the recipe! By the way when I told my husband what I was making he turned down his nose and told me only liked cold chicken salad. He's changed his tune entirely after eating this recipe dry and all!!

I ve made this for years and years. It s always a hit. The lemon is a nice shot of freshness in the middle of the winter. (I don t use my oven during summer!). If I need to take it to a pot luck or need to make it stretch sometime I cook a cup of raw rice per the recipe chicken stock instead of water add it to the mix and add a touch more mayo and lemon. It turns an 8x8 casserole into a 9x13. Doesn t change the flavor. Just makes it stretch further.
