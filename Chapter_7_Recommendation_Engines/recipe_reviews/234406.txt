It was great, thanks for giving me a place to start! 
I did make some modifications:
* Whole Wheat Rotini instead of egg noodles
* 2 cans of tuna
* Chopped onion
* Chopped garlic
* Shredded cheddar cheese (just kept going til I had a nice, thick layer)
* Bread crumbs instead of crisps
* Fish Marsala spice mix

Served with a side of broccoli and Carlsberg Elephant beer. My first Tuna Casserole!

This is a great base recipe. I skip the milk and potato chips. Not necessary. I use shredded mild cheddar to top with instead of velveeta. I add thawed frozen peas into the mix and voila!! Just like Mom used to make.

I was looking for a recipe that tasted like my Mom's. This is it; delicious and easy to make. Only changes were to add an additional can of condensed cream of celery soup, a cup of chopped onions and a cup of frozen peas.

This was so easy and good.  My husband loved it too.  I didn't have Cream of Mushroom soup so I substituted a can of New England Clam Chowder.  For the topping I used shredded cheddar and crushed Sea Salt & Pepper chips.   Yum!

Loved it! Doubled everything. Didn't have any cream of mushroom soup looked up recipe here for base cream soup (Easy - flour, broth, milk salt n pepper) added onions, used shredded cheese and ruffles chips.  The chips made it extra yummy!  Hubby and picky kids all had seconds :)

I added 1/4 cup of onions, increased the cheese to 3 slices and used a 9x9 baking dish.  It was awesome!  Just like I remember having when mom used to make it. I'm saving this recipe for sure.

I tweaked this a bit, added in a can Cream of Celery Soup with the Mushroom soup, and some frozen peas...topped it with some crispy chow mein noodles!

Easy and good.  Based on other reviewer's recommendations, I made some changes.  Doubled the tuna, added one cup of frozen peas, a large handful of sliced crimini mushrooms, and used probably 2 cups of grated extra old cheddar instead of processed cheese and panko bread crumbs instead of chips.

Excellent flavor and creamy. I just added a few things for fun. I used Queso Blanco Velveeta cheese and 1/2 c. Finely diced yellow onion. About 1/2 cup of frozen peas and 2 tsp. smoked paprika. In place of potato chips I used Italian bread crumbs. On top of the bread crumbs I used 1 1/2 c. Shredded mild cheddar. It was fabulous! Definite a keeper.

Yummy comfort food! Skipped the Velveeta and used shredded cheddar because that is what I had. i also added mushrooms and peas for preference, but would have been "just like mom used to make" without those additions

Very easy to make. Turned out to be a favorite of the shut-in I'm taking care of because of the softness and creamy texture of the casserole. I used a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses and used lightly salted potato chips on top. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This was really good, inexpensive, and easy.  We added peas and drained canned carrots to make it go further.  We forgot the cheese,  but it was still good.  the next night we added American cheese an it was great.

I felt it needed more flavor or crunch. I wish I had put peas or a vegetable in it.
