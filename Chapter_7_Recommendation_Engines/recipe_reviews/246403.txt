Love one skillet meals!  Make sure to cut the potatoes into small cubes so they cook quickly.  I left the mushrooms out, hubby doesn't like them (silly man) but I know they would have been delicious.  Next time, I would add some diced red and yellow bell peppers.  Served with a flour tortilla, Pico de Gallo and avocado slices.
