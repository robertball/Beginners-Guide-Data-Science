Unless you feel like putting this recipe in the fridgereator for a day or two, it is not that easy to work with. I suggest rolling right onto the cookie sheet. The dough is VERY soft and will break when trying to move the cut cookies.

The dough was really difficult to work with.  They're pretty cookies, but they're not tasty cookies.  The taste of the cookie doesn't seem to meld well with the hard candy.  They're also difficult to eat, like eating shards of glass and crumbs.

I made these cookies for the  Allrecipes Allstars Canada Challenge #allweneedislove
I only had 5 oz butter so I scaled the recipe to 30 servings which was 5 oz total of fats, I do not bake/cook with shortening so I used all butter.
I weigh my dry ingredients, after making the cookie dough as written, it was so soft I had to add an additional 6 tbps of flour.
Increased the vanilla from 1/4 tsp to 1 tsp.
Used crushed cinnamon hearts for peppermints, ground 5 heaping tbsps, used 1 tsp in each cookie, would increase to 1 1/4 tsps as there were a few spots visible, nothing major.
The dough has to be chilled overnight, after I cut the large hearts I placed them on the cookie sheets then put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes then cut out center hearts then filled and then baked.
Used my largest heart cutter, yielded 18 cookies that baked in 10 minutes on parchment lined sheets.
I was really unsure about these cookies but I was surprised at how tasty they were with some tweaking.
