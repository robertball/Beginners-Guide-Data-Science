Outstanding!  Family loved them, no leftovers!
Bought some fresh beets today and came home and went to All Recipes for some ideas on what to do with them.  Tried this recipe,cut back to 1/3 cup sugar and threw in some cloves and cinnamon as I remembered those flavors from my mother's beets. This is a keeper.

I used this for fresh beets. Peel and cut 6 medium beets and steam in a steamer basket for 25 min. Reserve 2T of the red water and add to a 4 cup glass measure combine 1/4 C sugar, 2 tsp cornstarch, 2T cider vinegar and cook in microwave for 2 min. Whisk in  3T melted butter and cook in microwave 1 more minute. Add beets to 2.5 qt casserole and pour sauce on top. Good hot or cold.

Outstanding flavor.  My guests were crazy over the Harvard Beets and had to share the recipe and All Recipe Web site so they would leave me alone.  Needless to say, there were no left overs.

We all think our own Grandma's recipes are the best, don't we? And you are so right. These are superb! I used fresh beets which I had precooked and then reheated in the sauce as it simmered. Best Harvard beets I have ever had. The butter was the crowning touch. YUM!

Wow these beets were sweet.  I should have known when I put all of that sugar in the pan that something didn't look right.  This recipe seems to be something that is prepared for a group that doesn't like the taste of beets.  I won't make this recipe again, but if I were going to, I would cut the sugar down to about 1/4 cup or less.

Let me be clear here first of all.....I simply *do* *not* *like* beets...at all.  In my mind there is a  certain "ick" factor about red slimy veggies.  But my hubby absolutely loves the stuff, so I decided to make it for him.  First of all, it came out nice and thick but not too thick even though I forgot to put in the butter, salt and pepper at the end.    Quite frankly, it didn't need it.  Second of all, because I love my hubby, I agreed to try it.  You know, it's actually pretty good.  My hubby went wild over it.  The only other thing I did different (aside from forgetting the butter and salt and pepper that is) was I used the beet juice like others here recommended.  I'll make it again for sure....AND maybe even eat some myself.  A keeper!

I trimed the calories on this by using Splenda instead of sugar and margarine instead of butter. Doubled the recipe as this was not enough to really cover the beets. My husband doesn't like beets but he loved these.

I just made these beets. They were very good, however next time I think I will use less sugar and a tad more vinegar.

Recipe is very good.  I use fresh beets or ones that I canned from last summer.  The only thing I do different is I add a little bit of cinnamon.  That was my mom's favorite way of making them.  the rest of the recipe is the same as my MOMS.  Her 93rd birthday is today!

Easy, yummy recipe. I used 2 cans of whole beets, quartered them for recipe. I used 1/2 cup sugar and cider vinegar, added a little cinnamon & cloves, and just a little of the beet juice as the cider vinegar made the sauce a funny brown color. The sauce thickened right up, and I only cooked the beets for about 10 minutes in the sauce (they just need to be heated, really.) Serving with the cauliflower pie with potato crust for dinner tonight (recipe also on this site.)

This is what you are thinking of when you think of old fashioned pickled beets.  I find them a little too sweet, hence the 4 stars, but other than that, really good.

These truly are excellent!  I thought there wasn't enough liquid, so added a little bit from the can, but I was wrong.  I'll trust Grandma next time!

Very good beet recipe - simple instructions, readily available ingredients, easy recipe and very tasty - took to July 4th party - received lots of compliments - I had never made a beet recipe like this before - I only had fresh beets and I tried to cook them in the sauce (peeled and thinly sliced, but it took too long) better the second time when I cooked the fresh beets which I peeled and sliced  first (cooked until tender in boiling salted water) and then followed the recipe as directed. Yummy - definitely would make again.

This at least as good, perhaps even better, than the canned Harvard Beets I've always used to make my mother's Red Flannel Hash.  I've  made it for 40+ years and to my dismay   I recently found that this essential ingredient  is no longer available.  I searched online for Harvard Beet recipes, comparing 6 of the best ones and settled on this one.  I cut back the sugar to 5 oz. and substituted canned beet liquid for the 1/3 cup of water.  You can't underestimate my delight when I tasted it.  My Red Flannel Hash is once again happily simmering on the stove.  I can't wait to dig in.  Thank You So Much for sharing!

These were amazingly good!  I only used one can of beets, shoestring cut, since there's only two of us to feed.  I made the full amount of sauce, though.  Used beet juice instead of water.  I didn't see any need to simmer it for 30 minutes though, I just let it heat through and then simmered for 5 minutes or so until everything else was done.  I forgot to stir in the butter, so I just put a spoonful on top of my serving.  I will definitely make this again.

Great way to introduce beets to anyone. Made as written. And it is wonderful tasting. Sweet and sour at its best. I will cut down on sugar the next time to tweak to my taste. I am making this ahead of my Easter dinner and it will be in fridge for a couple of days and I think it will add to the flavor.

I had already boiled fresh beets and was looking for something to jazz them up a little. This was exactly what I was looking for. I had red wine vinegar on hand and used a little less sugar, otherwise followed the recipe as written.

This is very good. I added a pinch of fresh nutmeg to it as I find nutmeg enhances the flavor of many vegetables if you only use a pinch.  The grandma who made this recipe knew her business in the kitchen. We enjoyed it very much.

Most delicious harvard beets ever. I used fresh beets and doubled the recipe. This will be my contribution to the 4th of July picnic at a friend's house. I would only take the best there for all my friends to oooh and ahhh over. This will do the trick, thanks to Grandma! Gracie Jarrettsville, MD

I love this recipe. Just make sure you start it ahead of time because it is a little time consuming. But the vinegar adds just the right tang to beets.

I thought this was pretty interesting, but my husband really didn't like it. The cornstarch thickening the sauce does make it a bit off-putting. I followed reviewers' advice and cut the sugar to 1/3 c. but that made the vinegar too pronounced. I think 1/2 cup would be perfect. And this works fine with raw beets. Just cook them for 30 min., dice them and add them to the sauce. Save the cooking water to use in the sauce. Stir this regularly, otherwise it sticks to the bottom of the pot.

I'm sorry to say, I took one bite and had to throw it all out. I don't know if I did something wrong, but these were so gross.

Very easy. My husband and I liked this recipe. My son and daughter didn't really like it. Very mixed reviews in my household...will probably make again, much to my childrens displeasure:-) PS: I forgot to say when I first did this review, that since many reviewers said it is too sweet, I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup for 2 cans of beets, 1/6 cup for 1 can.

I followed user suggestions to only use 1/4 cup sugar and I’m glad I did! They were plenty sweet. I wish I had done beet juice instead of water because they turned lighter as they cooked. Overall just what I was looking for! I did add extra white wine vinegar for a little more tang.

Excellent recipe! I used fresh beets from the garden, peeled, sliced and cooked until almost done. Then added the beets to the sauce.

I made this just the way it is written except I use fresh beets. Loved it.  It was just like what I used to make when I was first married some 50+ years ago. I lost the recipe book (from Met Life)I got as a wedding present.  Now I must share with persons of like taste.

These were great.     I grow my own beets and sliced a beet (my beet was as large as a baking potato) and made the sauce exactly as the recipe says.   Will make again.  I think if you  Double up the recipe and use for a potluck it would be very  good to serve.    Very attractive dish.  The flavor is perfect.

I used fresh cooked beets instead of canned. The proportion of sugar is a little high. I reduced it to just over 1/4 cup.  I used 1/.4  cup  of sugar to start and then added a teaspoon at a time until I got the sweet/sour taste I was looking for. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. Absolutely awesome!

I tried this recipe, but used fresh beets from the garden, boiled them until soft, then grated them.  I did not find the recipe too sweet and it was very tasty.  Just the right amount of vinegar to give it the tangy flavor to tantalize the tastebuds.  Thanks for the great recipes.

Very good. I added 1/2 c. sugar as others said it was too sweet and I added 2 tbls. Butter. I'd try 1tbls. next time, I love butter but it was a little too buttery for my taste.

I just made these beets and I can't wait to eat them!  I had them over Thanksgiving from my father in law who is a respectable chef in the area. and his are wonderful - these are better!! Kudos to the suggestion of adding a couple of cloves and cinnamon and less sugar.  Can't wait to make again!

I used about 1/2 cup beet water from cooking fresh beets with 1/2 cup more water. I used 1/3 cup Xylitol sweetener and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar. It took awhile to get as thick as I wanted but, dang, it was good! A childhood favorite that not too many people have even heard of. I was raised in NY State - is it an east coast thing?

I do try to make the recipe as written before reviewing/making changes, but this time - I couldn't!  But it was as close as I could come, since I just left out the butter - none left in the kitchen!  I also had to use cider vinegar instead of white.  I have to agree with others whose sauce didn't thicken much, and it boiled - vigorously!  So next time I'll add a little more cornstarch, and since I just can't resist playing, I'll also add a little more ginger.  While I originally thought the vinegar was too strong, it's netter the next time around - so I'll just cut it a bit instead of a lot.  On the whole, way better than the supermarket variety!  I can't ask Mom how it compares, since she only made pickled beets - no thick gooey sauce.  Personally, I go for the sauce, so thanks for the recipe.

This was such a bit that even my beet hating husband are these and liked them.    I will definitely make these again.

I used fresh beets and lemon pepper instead of straight pepper.  I also added a cinnamon stick while everything was simmering.  Also, I used a longer cook time since In was using fresh beets.  Not sure how long but at 30 minutes they were not fork tender

i just cut the sugar  to 1/2 C and for us that was perfect. (we don't like things too sweet)  Other than that, these are fantastic Harvard Beets and I will make them again.

Adjusted recipie for 4 servings.  Very good! The 2nd time I made them I did adjust for our taste and added more vinegar and less water.  I also used a little less sugar: 1-2 Tbl. less than 1/2 Cup.  Husband loved them! It's a recipie I'd share with friends.

Loved this Harvard beets recipe.  While I know others have thought it wasn't needed, I found the butter added at the end absolutely made this recipe.  I did make a change - instead of white sugar I used brown sugar.  It gave it a slightly deeper, earthier taste, which was perfect for this fall vegetable.  I did not alter the quantities in any way.  I also used fresh beets rather than canned, so I could cut the chunks to the size I wanted.

I made it for a veggie for dinner tonight.  I cut back on the sugar, only used 1/3 cup and it was still quite sweet enough.  I will make it again.  Thank you.

This recipe was so easy to make and the results were amazing.  Sweet & delicious and popular with my guests.  Because I used fresh beets from our garden I did change the order in preparation by cooking peeled & sliced  beets from our garden to a firm texture then putting the other ingredients into a saucepan and cooking, then pouring the sauce over the beets & cooking for an additional 15 minutes.  I did adjust the recipe a bit by adding 3 additional tsps. of cornstarch and an extra 1/3 cup of  vinegar and 1/3 cup of  water  as  I didn't think there was enough liquid in the recipe to cover the beets.

Made as written. I bought canned beets that were not packed in any sugar. Read the ingredients, many are in sugar already. Next time I would add one more 15oz can of beets, otherwise if you are looking for Harvard beets, these are great.

These turned out absolutely delicious. I did cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, I used fresh beets instead of canned and I used my beet  juice from cooking my fresh beets instead of the water.  I used three medium to large beets. I cut the butter In half. They were sweet and tart and delicious.

I quite surprise with the taste of this recipe.Delicious.
Indonesian recipes didn't often use beet roots.
I changed white sugar into coconut sugar and reduce the amount of sugar into 1/2 cup but still too sweet for us.Next time will reduce it to 1/4 cup.
I used fresh beet roots and boil it until reach crunchy texture.
I changed white vinegar into apple cider vinegar.
Next time will make in less calories version.Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is very good ! I made it just recipe called for ! Decided to try this recipe because it was different from the one I used before, this one had called for butter and I really like this one a lot better because the butter set it off. Yes I will be making this again.

Fabulous!  I used freshly cooked beets from the garden.  I took a lot of people's advice and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup.  It's perfect and will most definitely make again.

I love beets but never had them prepared this way before.  They turned out GREAT!  Very creamy.  I did use fresh beets and boiled them beforehand.  I also reduced the sugar like others mentioned and I'm glad I did.

So easy!  I fed beets to a few friends and they were amazed.  Some of them had never tasted a beet in their adult life.  To me,  they were a little sweet, so next time I'll up the vinegar. But I enjoyed being the kitchen wizard my friends proclaimed I am.

Made this recipe tonight with beets I canned from last year. I did forget the butter, salt and pepper, however they were fabulous without the extras. I will definitely make this again as I have it as a favorite in my allrecipes box. Next time will reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup.

yes, we will have it again. We had it as kids and had fresh beets so we tried this recipe and liked it very much. Used fresh beets, not canned.

Agreed with the others--too sweet.  I added more vinegar--used apple  cider vinegar for added flavor.  Next time will cut sugar at least in half, decrease the water and increase the vinegar.  But loved the basis--I just needed a little kick start.

Too much work, and too much sugar, so I just threw in some duck sauce and balsamic vinegar instead. Tasted great.

Actually I would give this 3 and a half stars. The sauce was a little too thick but the flavor was very good. As for me I will be making this again but will tweak it a little until I get it just right.

I was looking for my Mom's recipe, and this was it.  I even got my kids to eat it!  I did use fresh beets, peeled and cut them and steamed them first, then proceeded with the remainder of the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

These were yuuummm yuumm.  The only thing I did different, was a little less sugar, so then I thought I should put a little less vinegar as well.  I also use the beet juice for water.  Very good recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

used fresh beets, just need to cook longer.  Never ate beets before, but I'll be making this again!  Followed other suggestions about less sugar, and I think they were right.

This recipe took me back to my PA Dutch childhood!  Wonderful aroma and taste.  I served it cold with the Old Bay Shrimp Salad.  The flavors complimented each other very well.

It's been years since I've had these delicious beets and this recipes was terrific! All my guests enjoyed the "different" vegetable I served.
