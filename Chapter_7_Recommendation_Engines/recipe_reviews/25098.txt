The cookies are awesome.  The taste exaclty like Mrs. Fields.  They do tend to thin out so make sure not to overbake. I also added 1/2 a cup more chips.  These were so good I don't think I am going to share.  Thanks for the recipe.

yes, very chewie. yes, lots of chocolate. but i do agree with some of the rest, way too sweet. i'm gonna try it again, but this time, i'll cut the sugar (white and brown) to maybe a half of what's suggested. :)

JoAnne, this recipe is fabulous..I am an avid cookie maker and I was looking for a new choc.chip recipe..this is great and it turns out nicely shaped when you use a small cookie scoop..I highly reccommend that anyone looking for a good choc.chip cookie recipe give this one a try..I will be using this to sell at a bake table and I am very fussy as to what I sell..thanks again!

Much too sweet.  I'm not sure how anyone could eat these.  And I wish people would stop saying they taste just like Mrs. Field's cookies!  Please, go out and buy a Mrs. Field's cookie before you make that statement.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe except for using all brown sugar and subbed light butter with canola oil for the regular butter.  I read another review and cooked for 8 minutes to get a gooey cookie.  Thanks so much for posting!!

These are much too sweet - too much sugar. Didn't use milk chocolate chips or we'd all be ill. Please look again at your ingredients.

Really liked this recipe.  When you're having a sweet tooth craving, this will definately hit the spot!  My only complaint was that they spread out very thin when they baked.  However, they still stayed chewey which is a good thing!

These are flat as pancakes and very cakey. The taste isn't bad, but the texture and presentation are bad. Won't make again.

I love these! I make them whenever I have time, because the ingredients are always in my kitchen! When making the dough into balls, try sprinkling some flour on your hands, so that you can form them without the help of a spoon. also, bake the cookies just at 9 minutes- they harden when they cool, so you have some really chewy cookies!

The cookies were so good and delicious.  They are my favorite chocolate chip cookies.  We would eat them all if we could because they are so good.  But, I have to serve them at a tea party the next day.

I would like to try this same recipe with a cup of chopped walnuts.

FINALLY - a chocolate chip cookie that spreads out, is chewy and not too thin. I have read some of the reviews - if too sticky to handle, simple rub your hands in flour. Don't flatten out too much - I use the back of a glass so they are still 1/4" thick. They are perfect for the way we like them but if you don't like a flat cookie, look for one that you don't flatten manually before baking. If too sweet, use something like Splenda for both white and brown sugars.

These are delicious. I made them a little smaller then the recipe suggests though, as I find they are too thin to make too big.

These are the best cookies I have ever baked. I baked them before I started school this semester. I shared them with my friends when I moved into the dorms and everyone loves them. They disappeared in a week, lol. Karatemom1 said they taste like Mrs. Field's, and one of my friends told me they did. The best cookie recipe I've ever used, totally better than any recipe you could find on a chocolate chip package, and better than any cookies you can buy in a store.

Came out pretty good. I just switched the sugar measurements- the white 1 1/2 cups and brown 1/2 cup cuz i thought more white sugar would make it taste sweeter. And i used a little less salt. Next time ill try using mostly brown like in the recipe and see how i like it but for the  first time making chocolate chip cookies from scratch it tasted near perfect! Amazing texture, chewy yet crispy too.

This is my favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies since I found it here last year.  Not sure about Mrs. Fields and I don't think it is too sweet.  The cookies come out pretty flat, but I like my cookies that way.

These tasted good, but they are way too thin.  I don't know if I did anything wrong or if that's the way they're supposed to be.  I just prefer a cookie I can sink my teeth into.  They really did taste great though!!!

Terrible!!!  Absolutely nothing to these cookies.  I don't know how it was rated so high by others.  Someone else stated they were flat as a pancake, and I would have to disagree...my pancakes are much thicker than these cookies!  I looked at the recipe over and over after making these to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything, but they were indeed prepared precisely as written.  Very, very bummed.

I had 10 teens in my home this weekend ranging from 13 - 16. I tripled this recipe and every single one disappeared.  I tried freezing some but the second day out they came and disappeared just as fast.  In fact a couple of the teens asked for the recipe. This is the best ever I've tried, I only had dark chocolate chips but they worked just as well. This will be my Chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on, Thanks!

Very tasty cookies after some adjustments. I used whole wheat flour, and instead of milk chocolate chips I used 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 Skor chipits. MMM delicious!!

With some minor adjustments this can be a great recipe. I browned the butter on stove in a pan until dark with a nutty aroma. instead of using 2 eggs, i used an egg and an egg yolk, so it would be more chewy and reduced brown sugar to one cup. after mixing all the ingredients up to vanilla, let sit for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. i reduced the amount of flour by 1/2 cup more or less and used only 1/4 teaspoon salt. semichocolate chips bake better so i used those, and i baked in larger portions so that they would be chewier. hope this helps!

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookies recipie! Here's a suggestion though.... instead of adding eggs, add about 1/2 to 2/3 cup of milk (just enough to get the right texture)and put a bit less than teaspoon of baking powder and baking soda. The result is delicious!!!

I made these cookies for my orchestra, and everyone loved them. I've never made cookies before these that everyone loved. I make these cookies pretty often now, and I can get about 50-60 small cookies per batch. We usually have eaten them all in a few days.

I've been looking for the perfect chocolate cookie and this was definately NOT it!  Like said before, the dough was too runny and the cookies came out totally flat!  If you like flat cookies go for it, but to me the perfect cookie is soft, chewy and thick...I'll keep looking and trying my own experiments.

I was looking for a new cookie recipe and using vanilla pudding mix caught my interest.  It was very easy to mix and the cookies baked up nicely.  My son gave them 2 thumbs up and an elbow.

These were more like famous amos.  Hard and crunchy, even if you dont let them brown. i'm looking more for a nestle  tollhouse cookie. i was interested in this recipe as it called for more brown sugar than white, most recipes have equal parts.

Made just like recipe says. Yummy! I'm adding a few words. I've been using European style butter and Dark Brown sugar. Also use the best vanilla you can find!

Very good cookies! I used 1/2 cup of butter, and 1/2 cup of shortening. I think next time I will try a whole cup of shortening. I think it thickens them up, cause mine were not to thin. They were very sweet, so I will add less chocolate chips, and stick with the semisweet instead of milk chocolate. However, sweet is a good thing in a cookie. If I wanted something unsweet, I wouldn't be making cookies!
