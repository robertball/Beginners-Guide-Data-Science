DELICIOUS!!  I shortened the amount of water after reading the reviews.  OMG, this cobbler was a hit!  The only change I made was LESS WATER.  I started out with 1/4 cup of water, threw in the sugar, cornstarch and fresh strawberries.  I kept the extra water near just in case.  After it all came to a boil, I lowered the heat and let it sit stirring occasionally.  It thickened up in no time so I threw out the rest of the water.  I followed the rest of the recipe and the cobbler was gone within 10 minutes of serving it.  My neighbor even took half of it home to share with his family because he loved it so much.

This combination of your basic ingredients was deceptively wonderful. While making it I told my husband I didn't think it would taste very good because there was no spice (like cinnamon) in it, just flour, sugar, and butter... not even lemon! I was getting frustrated because the recipe wasn't specific in the cooking time of the berry sauce and I wasn't sure what consistency it should come out at. My sauce got to a point where it was bubbling, but no longer getting thick. I also wasn't sure exactly what "dot with margarine" meant. I ended up slicing bits of margargine up and dropping on top of the hot berry sauce... that was how I interpreted that term. I thought the batter was going to be the worst, but as my husband says: "the cake is what makes this recipe!" I think the texture of the cake was perfect and I really loved how that brown sugar and maragarine glaze came out. The fresh strawberries had a tonne of flavour, it was amazing! If you are planning on having some cobbbler left over, try not to over thicken the berry sauce... it reheats double as thick (tastes just as good though). In the end, I'd say I don't think there is much you can do to goof this one up. Thanks for this strawberry recipe which is now hubby's favourite cobbler!

This would be less runny if the strawberries weren't cooked first and the water was omitted.  Unlike other fruit cobblers, I don't cook strawberries on the stove but simply combine the raw berries with other filling ingredients in a baking dish, top with sweet biscuit dough, and bake.  Easier and less pots to wash too!

I used fresh strawberries and made the strawberry mixture a day ahead.  If you're going to do this, it saves time, but don't add the water.  The sugar brings out the juice in the berries and creates its own "soup" as you've seen with strawberry shortcake.  It does take  longer to cook than the recipe indicates.  It cooked for 45 minutes and was still a little under-done.  Tasted good, though.

This is dynamite.  I also made it with cherries and it was fantastic.  I add a tbl. of cinnamon to the crust and another to the glaze.  In addition, I reduced the water for the fruit because it was a bit too watery (to 2/3 cup) and increased the cornstarch (to 1-1/2 tbl.).  Serve with fresh whipped cream and you are in heaven!

Well the taste is good but it's sooo runny.  I have made it twice and both times I ended up with a strawberry soup.  A yummy soup, but not a cobbler!  I am not sure what I could have done differently, I even added extra corn starch last time.

I was in search of a southern strawberry cobbler like the little place up the road made. This one hit the spot!!! This is my new favorite dessert dish. I used a pyrex glass pan to make this dish in. I of course did as others suggested. I used 3 cases of strawberries, which was approx. 6 cups of strawberries. I added a little bit extra sugar because of the extra ammount of strawberries so I say it was probably about 3/4 cup. I added what one reviewer stated, 1 1/2 TBSP of cornstarch, although I will probably add 2 TBSP next time. I did not cook the strawberry mixture and I left out the water as it was perfect the way it was. I did take the 2 TBSP butter and cut off little pieces to place through out the strawberry mixture once in the pan. I thought the dough mixture was just perfect with the ammount though. I baked it for longer which I thought was very helpful! I baked it for about 40 mins. I then made the brown sugar mixture which I added a little bit of cinnamon and vanilla for flavor...just a splash of each. I brushed the brown sugar mixture over top of it all. Then I baked for close to 20 more mins. Any longer and I think it would have burned but it cooked the dough part enough to make it non cake like. Through and through it was excellent and I will be enjoying this recipe for a long long time!

This cobbler is definetly very tasty!! I used 5 to 6 cups of strawberries and I made a half more of the biscuit mixture. If I were to make it again I would add more cornstarch and maybe a little less water.

Wow, this was AWESOME!  I used 5 cups of strawberries and just about doubled the dough. This fit perfectly in the 2 quart baking dish.

Delicious - I used five cups fresh strawberries, omitted the water entirely, decreased the cornstarch to a little over a teaspoon, and only slightly increased the quantity of flour.  It fit perfectly in an 8 x 8 inch baking dish.  For those who say it's too cakey, they should reduce the baking powder to 1 teaspoon.  It makes it more crumbly.  With these modifications, the cobbler yielded the perfect consistency.  Not soupy at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so yummy.  We made it in our dutch oven on a camping trip and topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I didn't add the water, as suggested in other reviews and it turned out excellent.  Not runny at all.  Also, I used 2 cans of strawberry pie filling, instead of the fresh strawberries, sugar and cornstarch. (To make it easier to make while camping). It was really, really yummy and so easy to make.

This was delicious but too juicy, so in hindsight I’d add less water, maybe even half as much – either that or more strawberries and cornstarch.  The brown sugar/butter topping was different, interesting and gave this cobbler a unique flavor I enjoyed.  I used butter, not margarine, but forgot to dot the strawberry mixture with it. Glad for that, as it didn’t need it.   While the flavor of this was nice, this recipe in my view needs too much tweaking to rate it any better than average; specifically, less water, or more strawberries and cornstarch.

The crust was a little cakey for my taste, but the flavor was good. But I'm still on the lookout for the perfect strawberry cobbler recipe.

A word of caution:  I used light brown sugar, rather than dark brown.  It can't be substituted.  The cobbler became much too sweet, which overwhelmed the strawberry flavor.  The strawberries seemed a bit sparce and the sauce too thin, so I would agree with the reviewers urging more strawberries, more cornstarch, and less water.

Very lovely summertime treat... Sweet and sassy, with a very, very yummy filling! Only recommendation: Use way less water! Trust me, you'll be glad you didn't add in all of it.

I used more strawberries and less water as suggested.  There was still way too much topping which was really cake-y and not very sweet.

This is why this web site is THE BEST - all of the reviews that help tweak a recipe.  Here is what I changed - I did not add water and I did not cook the strawberries.  I added sugar and cornstarch to the strawberries and then mixed up the batter.  I added vanilla to the batter and I also used light brown sugar instead of dark brown and it still came out great.  I skipped the brown sugar topping because I love cakey desserts and thought the topping would take away from it.  I baked it for about 30 minutes total, and it was fantastic!  It actually reminded me of strawberry shortcake.

It had no taste to it.  The topping was o.k. but the strawberries didn't have much taste.  I reduced the water like others suggested, but you would think that would give it more flavor.  It still was tasteless.

I added some more cornstarch to thicken it up and probably took it off the burner too quickly. Still turned out great!  Oh, also, I made 1.5 times the dough and dused two pints of strawberries.  YUMMY!  I'll make this again!

I wish I had read the reviews that said to use more fruit and either use less or omit the water completely.  I found the cake-like cobbler topping to be a nice change, and an especially good taste with the brown sugar (even though I used light brown sugar instead of dark).  I did add some vanilla to the batter and omitted the extra brown sugar/butter on top.

This recipe is "almost the reincarnation" of my Georgia grandmother's strawberry cobbler recipe.  She has been gone for almost 30 years and took the secrets of her southern cooking to the grave with her.  She never measured anything, and even with my aunts watching over her shoulder, they could not "get it" to pass it along to us.  My 77 year old father nearly became misty-eyed when he ate it.  Thank's for the memories!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I only used a 1/4 cup of water and it was perfect.  It was so easy to make that I made it when I came home from work. My entire family couldn't wait until it was finished  the entire house smells terrific.

Well, the flavor of the topping and strawberry mixture was good, however,  like others have said, it comes out super watery as written. I would try this again but would def have to make some major adjustments, like upping the amount of strawberries or doubling the cornstarch.

The only thing I had to change was that I put 3T of cornstarch. I did not read the reviews about using less water until after I made it, so next time I will reduce the water just a little bit. But the 3T of cornstarch did the trick. It came out perfect and tastes fantastic. I also served with vanilla ice cream.

This is so easy, and it is great with ice cream on top.
The topping is not like a regular cobbler. It is a little moist.

The topping turned out too cake-like for me.  I prefer a cobbler topping to be thin and crispy.  The taste was very good though.

This recipie was easy enough. I used self-rising flour and frozen strawberries instead of what was listed. It made the recipie a little more runny then it should have been. The flavor was great!

I wasn't thrilled with this cobbler. I've definitely had better. I didn't care for the brown sugar in the batter and the brown sugar and butter on top. The filling was good, but I would use a different recipe for the batter on top.

Oh Wow! This was so good!  I even made a few changes to make it low-cal and is was still delicious!  I used Splenda sweetener instead of sugar and instead of brown sugar, I used 1/4 cup of Splenda and 1 tbsp of sugar free maple syrup.  I did not have any cornstarch on hand so I used t tbsp of flour instead and it came out so yummy.  It was a little more brown thatn I liked but I think this was because of the Maple Syrup.  A little time consuming (that is the reason for 4 stars and not 5) but worth the effort.

Very sweet and delicious!  I did not cook the strawberry mixture and I used 1% milk instead of half and half and it turned out great!

Like everyone else seems to have done, I left out the water and increased the cornstarch.  In addition I added a little bit of lemon juice and a little bit of cinnamon to the strawberry mixture. When I put bits of margarine on top of the strawberry mixture I also sprinkled on  a bit more cinnamon. Now it’s pretty much like my original cobbler recipe that I was looking for.

It was okay.  Everyone liked it, but I would rather have a crumbly topping.  It was too moist for me.

I would make it again. Used less water. The only thing  I would do differently is add more cornstarch.

Did not pre cook filling.  Used 5-6 cups of strawberries, 1 Tblsp cornstarch & about 2 Tblsp sugar & 3 Tblsp water in bottom of 9" sq. Dish.  Followed recipe for topping.  Turned out great.  No need to make syrup & pre cook berries!
