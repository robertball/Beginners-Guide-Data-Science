I didnt have buttermilk so i also used regular milk and instead of baking it i fried it in a pan with some oil.  When it was golden brown i rubbed some BBQ sauce on it the fried it a little longer without burning it.  This made it have alot more moisture and flavor!

These were tasty and have potential.  Next time I'll pan fry them in a little oil as the baking method didn't adequately cook the flour.  Also I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk, and I used garlic salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in place of the garlic pepper.  The flour mix is really a matter of taste, it's the bbq sauce/milk/egg mixture that makes this recipe.  A great idea, it just needs tweaking.  It's reminicsent of Tyson's frozen honey bbq wings.

I found that if you preheated and baked on 425 your chicken will brown the way you like for it

great concept, but baking left raw flour on the outside.  I tried pan frying it the second time, and it was great.

Tried these for dinner tonight and they were a hit!  Imagine something EVERYONE agreed on!!  Didn't have buttermilk so I just used about 1/2 cup of 2% and it made a really thick batter to dip in.  Definately a keeper!!

All I could think when eating this was that this is a flavor mother nature never intended.  I like just about anything, but even I thought this tasted strange.  My 7 year old wouldn't touch it and my 15 year old said it tasted ok covered in mashed potatoes, but didn't eat more than 1 chicken finger.

I wouldn't even give this recipe 1 star.  It was a Waste of my Time & Money. It taste like i was eating flour, a waste of my chicken. My husband didn't like it either. I did not want to sign up just to rate this recipe but seriously do not want to have someone else waste their time & money on this recipe too.

When the man of the household can only say "mmmm" you know it's good!  I followed other reviewers who suggested to pan fry it.  So I pan fried them and then baked them for about 20 minutes at 375 because the breading wasn't completely done.  It is time consuming but the end result is very tasty.  And it was rather easy.

I tried this recipe and it was good but the flour didn't get done on the chicken, so I took them out of the oven and fried them. I should have read the reviews, then I would have known to do this in the first place. They do have a great taste in the breaded part though.

o.k. It was eaten, but not discussed much.  No positive comments.  That is how my family politely says let's not do this one again.

This was a a mess coming out of the oven. Floury yuck. Another poster suggested frying,  so next time I will. Also 1 hour would have killed these- I baked 30 min. Brushed BBQ Sauce on the floury chicken and put back in oven for 5 min.

I didn't make this yet but I do have a tip to offer.  You don't have to have buttermilk on hand.  Use 1 tblsp vinegar and one cup of whole or 2 percent milk and this will make a good substitute for buttermilk.  Let this set for 5 minutes.  I will be trying this recipe but I think I will go with some of the reviewers and fry them instead of baking.

I fried instead of baked it. Fried in pan with vegetable oil it was tasty crispy and great on a cold evening.  Followed the directions you have to use buttermilk.

Baking didn't cook the batter very well, leaving uncooked inside and out.  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll try frying them instead.

To spice it up a little, I used sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and increased the amount of garlic pepper by a lot. It was terrific. I made it just a few days ago, had the leftovers today, and am planning on making it again this week!

I made a few changes. I made my own garlic pepper seasoning (fresh Blk  pepper, cumin, paprika,  garlic powder,  onion powder, salt, brown sugar and parsley flakes) to place in flour. Marinated chicken in minced garlic, grated onion, a little salt and black pepper. Battered my chicken as the recipes stated, but with all the comments about the chicken being doughy I decided to fry my chicken  in oil instead of baking it.  This made a world of difference! Came out delicious!!!

I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted with 2% milk. I also used bread crumbs instead of flour. They have a nice flavour and crisp up. Better than store bought.

I fried it in a skillet until golden brown then applied bbq sauce and placed in the oven. It was different but really good especially if your batter includes buttermilk and an egg. Why would you even attempt a south dish if you're not southern enough to have buttermilk in the fridge :)

I tried it per the recipe and also had raw flour outside, and the chicken was dry. I couldn't taste the BBQ sauce at all. I won't be making this one again.

I substituted buttermilk for regular and it turned out great. yes there was a little extra flour on the outside but I don't find it a big deal. My grandma and my son loved it too. Some people don't like it but I guess it is just a personal opinion. I took the extra ingredients and mixed them added some baking powder and made a weird kinda bread haha.
