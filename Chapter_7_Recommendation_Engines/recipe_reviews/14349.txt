This is one of those recipes which allow for as much or as little liberties as you like!  I personally love to jazz this Italian pasta salad up with half moon slices of pepperoni, cubed mozzarella and smoked cheddar cheeses, black olives, small pepperoncini peppers, and little grape tomatoes!  It could be a meal in itself!

I really liked this and so did our company.  The second time I made it, however, I added a 1/2 cup of Cilantro and some cubed mozzerlla cheese.  WOW!!

Excellent pasta salad.  Has the perfect amount of zing.  I have tried 2 other pasta salad recipes from this site that took alot more prep work & were nowhere near as tasty as this quick & easy recipe. I omitted the green bell pepper because I thought the red one was sufficient.  Otherwise I followed recipe to a tee.  Thanks for sharing Jeanette.

The caesaritalian dressing mix is what MAKES this salad! I add orange and yellow bell peppers(along with the red and green), and sliced black olives for some real color.  Salami chunks are also a tasty addition!  Everyone always likes it!  Thanks!!!

I love this recipe.  We have a big family, and I am always cooking for a crowd.  This goes together in a snap, and because the key ingredients (of grated cheese and both dressings) are all equal quantities, it is easy to make a huge bowl or a small bowl without any major calculations.   As long as I put the same quantity of each in, the recipe comes out perfectly.  Once I have the pasta, cheese and dressings together, I use whatever produce looks best at the store--not just bell peppers.  Sometimes I use cherry tomatoes or a can of drained, chopped artichokes which is wonderful.   (BTW, I make it with the Dreamfields low carb pasta, and no one knows the difference.)  My much beloved nieces crave this recipe.  Once, when I sent the leftover salad home with my niece, her dad ate it out of the fridge.  She had a complete melt-down, laying on the floor, sobbing (20 years old!)   I'm sure it was hormones, but I like to think it was my salad.

Tried this for a potluck at work, co-workers loved it and got lots of requests for the recipe. It's so easy to do, I've made this several times and I've added black olives and  changed up the pasta, comes out great every time!

This is just the pasta salad I was looking for!  I left out the peppers simply because I don't care for them and it was still wonderful!  Try adding some shredded parmesan in addition to the grated cheese.  Yum!  Thanks for this simple and great tasting recipe!

Great starter recipe. You can add anything basically to this recipe. I added cucumbers, capers, yellow bell peppers, mushrooms and artichoke hearts. It was a crowd pleaser, especially for the vegetarians at our get together. Very important to make sure to chill ahead so the flavors mesh.

Made this for a Fathers Day bbq at my in-laws.  It was delicious.  I used tri-color rotini, 1 cup FF zesty Italian dressing, eyeball amounts of chop onion (probably about a 1/4c), sliced black olives (1/2 large can), diced pepperoni (probably about 1/2c), cubed mozzerella (8 oz block), sliced hardboiled eggs (I think 2-3), 1T parsley, some paprika, salt and pepper, and a shake or two of parmesan over top.  Sometimes my mom would add summer sausage instead of pepperoni.  Just like my Italian family makes it!  And now my Irish-German in-laws adore it, too. Thanks for reminding me of my family's recipe!

I had planned on making my own dressing but.....I ran out of time today. I used Smart Taste rotini, Newman's Creamy Caesar and Newman's Family Italian dressings. I did use all red pepper (we don't care for green pepper) and I threw in one chopped zucchini and two chopped tomatoes. I only used part of a red onion because that's all I had. This was an easy recipe for me to make to go along side a less healthy choice (kosher hot dogs) that I could throw added vegetables I had on hand plus it was economical for me (we're on a tight budget for a while) as well. This would be a great summer salad with cubed cheese and salami.

Tastes so much better the next day.  I use about 3/4 the dressing when mixing and then add more as needed before serving and usually add diced English cucumbers and chopped pepperoni.  Spring onions are a wonderful substitute for the red onion, and we prefer rotelle pasta to the rotini as it is lighter and has more surface area to cling to all the goodies.

My SIL brought this pasta salad to dinner the other night and I LOVED it!  She added small circles of pepperoni which I really liked in it.  I think what makes this recipe so great is the combination of italian and creamy ceasar dressings.  I will definitely make this and simply use whatever veggies I have on hand.

This recipe is 5 star - it's a very very good base salad that when left alone is delicious but allows for plenty of modification. Every time I make this my bowl comes back empty. I intend to make this for both a work potluck and our own thanksgiving meal because it's so easy to up the batch. I personally use a high quality italian, and a high quality creamy caesar dressing which I think helps - the first time I made it was with a value brand and it was okay, but nothing special. I don't usually do the amount of bell pepper but that's to my companys preference. I dice the onions very fine and I also add grape tomatos and sliced black olives occasionally. A very good, very customizable dish!

I like this recipe for its simplicity.  I make it with the two dressings & parmesan (reduced amounts) and set a container of it aside for the kids lunches.  I add their personal veggie preference before packing & their good to go.

The remaining salad is for the grown ups!  Whatever sounds good is what goes in - sundried tomatoes, smoked salmon, olives, along with any seasonal veggies.  Top with some fresh basil & ground pepper & you're set.

Great "make ahead" recipe.  Give it a try!!

We had friends over for burgers and I wanted a pasta salad to go with it - this is very good and the company loved it.  The only slight change I made was that I used bow tie pasta just because I think they are so cute.  Very good and will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe with great feedback from our guests.  I did at some sliced pepperoni as well.  I am always looking for "make ahead recipes" and this one is great. I added half the dressing and then about an hour before the party tossed in the rest.

The dressing is the secret to this otherwise ordinary pasta salad.  I used about half the dressing called for (1/2 cup Italian & 1/2 cup Caesar), and I found that the pasta was adequately covered.  Next time I may try to include different vegetables and meats based on my family's preferences (i.e. peas & hard salami).  Excellent pasta salad!!

I always get rave reviews when I bring this anywhere.  Several people have told me that they usually don't like pasta salad but love mine.  It's just a great flavor with the two dressings.  Not too tangy and not too creamy.  Just perfect!

This made a great summer dinner when we didn't want something heavy. The dressing is delicious!

We didn't have an onion so I omitted that, but added chopped grape tomatoes, sugar snap peas, and cooked shrimp. Next time we'll try chicken instead.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I had a picnic to go to and used 2lbs of rotini, 2 bottles of Italian dressing and 2 each of the peppers.  Forgot the parmesan cheese but followed rest of recipe and everyone just loved it.  There were no leftovers!!

Very good and a good alternative to pasta with plain Italian dressing. This is a definite make again. I omitted the onion because my kids don't like it and I added salami, totally delicious.  I used a store brand dressing to save some money and I used reduced fat to save some calories!

I really liked this recipe because it is super easy and  has fewer steps than many other pasta salad recipes.  I tweaked it a bit by using what I had on hand.  I had garden rotini pasta and used 8 oz. I used a frozen steam-in-bag mixture of broccoli, carrots and cauliflower (cooked per directions).  I then added 1/4 cup chopped onion and 1/2 jar of roasted red pepper. Lastly I added 1/2 cup each of the following:  Italian salad dressing, light Caesar salad dressing and Parmesan cheese.  This is an easy simple recipe that can be prepared with what you have in the pantry.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is heavy on the dressing.  Next time I would use less.  I've posted a picture - it looks great and would be nice for a summer potluck dinner.

This pasta salad is my favorite.  The recipe was easy to follow.  I used the Caesar & creamy Italian dressing, Parmesan cheese and added brocolli florets.  I did not add peppers or onions.
It has great flavor!  Quick easy side dish for feeding the family during the week.

yum! perfect! I too have tried several pasta salad recipes from this site and have found them lacking.  This one is easy and good!!  The caesar dressing is very strong at first, but by the 2nd day the flavors mellow and are spectacular!

This is a great recipe which I tweaked just a bit. I used 2 sticks of celery and also used only half each of the dressings as I think it would have been to creamy for my taste. The amount I used was just perfect and with the parmesan cheese it gave it just enough flavour. I think carrots would have also done well in here for added nutritional value. Thank you so much for sharing, I will definitely be making this many times to come.

Really good, I usually make pasta salad like this but I have only used Italian dressing. The Caesar Dressing gives it somthing different and is really good. I made it just as written but you could definatley add chicken, salami, ham or different vegis to it and it would be great too.

This isn't light, but it's really yummy! Reminded me of pizza somewhat. Excellent dressing combo, and the olives, which isn't my favorite ingredient most days, really make the salad. I am going to try a little lightening-up next time by thinning the dressing with milk (would help maintain creaminess too) and adding more pasta.

I have had difficulty finding a really good pasta salad recipe.  At last, I've found one!!  I didn't have a red pepper, so I just used the green, then added black olives and cherry tomatoes as suggested in other reviews.  I kinda eye balled the amount of dressings and cheese.  It was fabulous!  I couldn't stop tasting it before going into the fridge.

I made this for the hubby to take to a potluck at work. I made a double recipe and it was wiped out quickly. I added sliced black olives, and used store brand everything. Chilled overnight.  The red onion really made this dish a standout (all the red onions at the local market were huge, so I just used one). The mix of dressings is perfect - I think I like it better than a mayo-based sauce. This recipe is a keeper.

made this for 4th of july barbecue. prepared it the night before.  the following day, the salad is too dry and could not really taste the dressing.  even after i added another 1/2 cup of the dressing, it was still not a hit and no one cared for it much.

This is a great starting point for Italian pasta salad.  I made it last night using tri color rotini pasta and added sliced ripe olives, pepperocini, green onions, chopped tomatoes and finely chopped pepperoni.  It was a huge hit!  My daughter wants me to make it for her wedding reception!

Excellent! Pasta salad usually bores me - not this one! I made a double batch and used a bag of veggie pasta spirals to color it up - plus I added some cucumber, fresh grape tomatoes and carrots for additional flavor and texture. Hardly any left at the large cookout we took it to. Keeping this one!

The first three ingredients are key to this pasta salad.  The combination of the two dressings is a hit!  As long as you start with the first three ingredients you can add whatever you want.  I actually marinated sliced cherry tomatoes, sliced olives and mozzarella cubes in the dressing for a couple hours and then tossed with the pasta and refrigerated overnight.  It was still moist the next day.  This is a great versatile recipe.  Thanks!!!

I was leery of the Caesar-Italian dressing combo, but it works nicely together...Really just turns into a flavorful, creamy dressing.  Used green onions, since they were on hand, and freshly grated Parmagiano Reggiano.  Looking forward to trying tomorrow after flavors have time to combine.  Not my favorite pasta salad, but a quick fix if you're rushed.

This is a fun versatile recipe. You can throw anything in it. I used bow tie pasta, red and yellow peppers, olives, chicken, red onion, broccoli, and a three cheese Italian blend. Made a delicious dinner with it and my husband loved it.

I tried this recipe based on the dressing combination.  I really liked it!  This is a wonderful base recipe that you can add on to.  I like pepperoni, carrot and zucchini in my pasta salad!

I left out the onion and served the bell peppers on the side for individuals to add.  The mixture of Caesar and Italian dressings were a great twist.

Wow, what an easy, delicious recipe. We all enjoyed the taste of the 2 dressings together. While the pasta was boiling, I prepared and mixed the remaining ingredients and let sit in the fridge. The ingredient amounts are easy to rememeber too. I did add about a cup of sliced black olives and want to add mini pepperoni next time. Thank you for a great recipe.

It was good, though not what I was looking for.  I used bow tie pasta instead of rotini and I don't think it worked as well.

Oh, my! What a delicious pasta salad! 
I used a rainbow farfalle (bow-tie) pasta as I had no rotelle. I also used sweet onion, as I prefer it, and I used assorted colors of bell peppers. 
I used a store-brand Italian dressing dry mix that you make yourself.
I loved the combination of dressings! The parmesan cheese really gave it the final kick! 
If you want to try it with other ingredients such as a summer sausage or a kielbasa, then I suggest sampling some to the side before adding it to the whole salad. It really doesn't need much other than what was listed, imo. 
I will make this salad again and again! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Did as directed. Tasted great. Halved the onion and red bell pepper. Omitted the green bell pepper. Forgot the Parmesan but that would have tasted even better.

I changed it to suit what I had on hand. Added halved cherry tomatoes instead of red bell pepper and green onion instead of red. I also halved the dressing called for (2 c is overdoing it in my opinion) and added sliced black olives. Everyone in my family loved it! Will definitely be a summer staple this year.

Great creamy pasta salad that can be made quickly if you forget to make it ahead of time.It has a nice flavour to start and if you have an hour or so before you eat your meal it can sit in the fridge and develop a bit more fullness in flavour.

Can you ruin this great recipe?  I doubt it!  I thought I had all the ingredients.  It still turned out very well when I used only half of the amount of caesar dressing and upped the italian dressing to make up for it.  I also put in less green pepper and onion then the recipe called for.  Still tastey.  To bulk it up for a meal I added mozzerella shredded cheese and sliced black olives.  Thank you.

Very good. Just the right amount of dressing for the pasta. Thought it needed something, so I added some garlic powder. I think I might cut back on the parmesan next time by 1/4 cup. I also added 1 cup of frozen peas, and next time i'll add brocoli. Probably even better after it sits for a while, so the onion flavor can spread abit. Oh ya, I used calorie-wise dressings.

I made this recipe for a cookout over the 4th of July and received many compliments.  I did change/add a few ingredients.  I used thin spaghetti broken in half (just a preference of mine), added chopped up chicken pieces, black olives, grape tomatoes and mozzerella cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a great recipe!!  I usually 'tweek' before I make but not this time! I prefer it room temperature.  Very easy and quick to make as well as delicious. This will be great for those summer BBQ partys coming up this year.  Thanks for sharing! Update (3-24-09) I made this pasta for my Bunco night (12 ladies) and there was barely a spoonful left.  Everyone commented on how much they loved it!!

I'm not a big fan of pasta salads with mayo, so I wanted to try this instead.  It was excellent!  The two dressings work surprisingly well together.

This is such a quick and easy side dish for pitch-ins.  Normally, I leave out the green bell pepper and sub cucumbers because hubby hates them.  Also adding halved cherry tomatoes is a great touch.

Easy recipe to make and adapt to what veggies are in the 'fridge. The key really is using 1/2 Italian dressing & 1/2 Caesar. Used this at our Little League concession stand and it SOLD OUT IN 20 MINUTES! I've had tons of requests to make it again and again and again! Huge hit!

The combination of Italian and Caesar dressing is ingenious, goes so well together.
When making this though I was tempted to go by my instincts but didn't. Far too much pasta. I used 2 8oz packages and it was too, too much and so not nearly enough veggies.
The dressing was also barely enough (because of so much pasta) so next time halve the pasta and add way more veggies (any kind will do) and this would pretty much be a 5 star. Thanks for the idea.

This recipe was so good that it has caused me to leave my first review!  I just finished making it to feed 150 and though I spent hours making it all, it was worth it!  I will be making again!  The only change I made was I added tomatoes.  I think the other suggestions to add pepperoni is a great idea and will do that in the future.

Awesome! Doubled the recipe and it was gone in 2 days! The dressing definitely makes it. I used Ken's italian and Cardinis creamy ceasar.

It is a quick, easy recipe. But I'm not a fan of the cream sauce. I put less than required and I still didn't really like it. But maybe it's just me. I also sauted the green peppers, red peppers, and onions with basil and oregano. Adds alittle flavor to the veggies. Fairly certain that pieces of cooked chicken would taste wonderful as well. Also I did not add all the cheese to the mix. I just sprinkled a little on the top and mixed it in. But it was good.

Thought my husband would like it because he loves peppers and thought I wouldn't like it because I don't like them.   We both love it!  The peppers add a nice crunch to go along with the zing.

I am a traditional mayo kind of girl, and i did not care for this pasta salad. It was not bad, just not what i am use to. However, I gave it 5 stars because my son, who thinks mayo stinks, loves this pasta salad. And he is such a picky eater, that if he likes it it deserves 10 stars!

This is the best pasta salad ever. The creamy caesar and italian dressings along with the grated parmesan cheese are so tasty. I'll never use another dressing on my pasta salad again.

We didn't really care for this.  Perhaps it would be different is I tried different brands of dressings since they all seem to taste a bit different.

This is delicious!!  I've made it twice and we'll be making it for our vacation next week!  I added extra veggies...shredded red onion, shredded carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, chick peas and two types of cheese (sharp cheddar and mozzarella cubed).  

Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I replaced green bell pepper with a yellow bell pepper, added artichoke hearts, cubed mozzarella and chopped tomato marinated in Italian dressing, and half a cup of chopped cilantro and it was absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again.

My husband loved this, I did a little less so, but that may have to do with pregnancy nausea.  I added black olives, a bit of chicken (for the husband) and chopped avocado.   The avocado really did it for me.

The mix of the dressings gives it a nice flavor, I only used peppers as we aren't a fan or raw onions.  Still good, not my favorite pasta salad but I would make it again.

I changed this quite a bit, but it was great and was gobbled down. Instead of red pepper, I used cherry tomatoes. I added sliced black olives, cubed mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, salt and fresh pepper. May try adding pepperoni/salami. Will make again Thanks for sharing!

this recipe was a welcomed addition to the many pasta salads I make for the summer. I made a small amount for a test try and my family loved it. The combination of the ceasar and the italian dressings made the salad! I will make again!

I'm not super crazy about pasta salad, but when I saw this recipe it sounded easy,and good. I read the reviews, and a lot of people were saying some great things. We ended up going to a BBQ,and this was a side dish that I brought. I also put some extras in it,and used what I had on hand. I used only green bell pepper, white, and green onion, a hint of black pepper,and garlic powder. I kept the rest the same. I put it in the fridge for a couple hours before we left. BOY, was it a hit at the BBQ!!! Everyone wanted the recipe. And went back for seconds. I was very surpried at how well the two dressing tasted so well together. I will definitely make again for any kind of party!! Thanks for sharing, very tasty.

This recipe was very good. I mixed all the ingredients together to let them sit while the noodles were cooking. I also sauted the bell peppers in 2 Tbsp butter since I don't care for the crunchy texture. I also omitted the onion b/c I don't like them. The pasta was good at both room temp and the following day right out of the fridge. I think the flavors tasted even better the next day. Would def make again!

I made this once before for a potluck I attended and it went over very well.  The hostess asked for the recipe and she served it at a dinner she had subsequently, also to rave reviews.  I made it for lunch today and I guess it really hit the spot with my husband as he said, "The food was delicious!"  It's really a great recipe - very easy and we enjoy the taste.  You can chop up your veggies while the pasta is boiling.  I make it according to the directions except that I use a zesty Italian dressing instead of just regular and I've added additional veggies - corn, broccoli.

This was great! I used bowtie pasta and about 2 tbs of white onion, since I had no red onion. I added shredded mozzarella cheese and black pepper, too. Loved the dressing combo and we liked it best served at room temperature. Will definately make again.

Awesome pasta salad!  I only used red and green peppers as I don't care for raw onion and it was just delicious! It even kept very well the next day for my potluck and did not dry out at all. I recommend chopping the peppers into very small pieces.  They stay nice and crisp even the next day.  I got many compliments on it, especially from my husband who tried to eat half of the bowl the night before the potluck.  This one will most definitely go in my recipe book!

The flavors in this recipe are perfectly balanced, unlike a few others I've tried. The only things I added were half a cup of Parmesan/Romano cheese blend, and a small can of sliced black olives. A great, easy pasta salad! Thanks for sharing!

This is the very same salad that a bar and grill used to make, using garlic ranch, however, you can't get garlic ranch anymore, so thus the end of the salad.  But with this recipe it is just the same!!!  I added, peppers of course green onions, black and green olives, and parmesan and romano cheese, and it turned out just great!

A nice, simple pasta salad without all the veggies and meat that most call for.  The Caeser dressing gives a nice zing.  I chop fresh tomatos and toss on top right before eating.  Perfect lunch!

This was great. I was a little leary about mixing italian dressing with caesar dressing but it was really good. I used 1/2 a medium onion and that was plenty. I added a small can of sliced black olives and a package of diced pepperoni. These really added to the flavor. I also used 1/2 cup grated parmesan and 1/2 cup shredded parmesan. Then I topped the salad with some extra shredded parmesan. Will definately make this again.

Fantastic Pasta Salad!
I am picky about pasta salad: I don't like it when they are too oily and vinegar-y, and I don't like it when they are too mayonaise-y. This recipe is a perfect balance with the Italian and Caesar dressings. 
I read the reviews, and included yellow & orange bell peppers with the red & green (used 1/2 of each color), and a cup of cubed mozzarella. It was a big hit and everyone had seconds! I will definitely be saving this recipe for the future.

It's a super simple and delicious pasta salad. I loved it because it's so easy to add to it and it completely changes the taste. I swapped the onion for red onion, added lots of fresh dill and some crumbled feta. Delicious! Also because the dressing is all pre-made I always buy the expensive refrigerated stuff - you can really taste the difference.

I used Newman's Italian (full fat) and Litehouse Cesear dressing.  I let the pasta sit for 6 hours before serving.  My friends really like it.

This turned out great! It was perfect for my company Potluck. The only adjustment I made was using a hint of black olives instead of the red onions. P.S. Like others have said, it definitely tastes better the next day!

I've made this 2x now and I reduced the amount of dressing to 1/4 cup of zesty italian and 3/4 cup caesar parmesan yogurt dressing - delicious!!!  For me with the full cup of both dressing it was too soupy and the italian was too strong!  It's really yummy tho and I throw in whatever I have in the fridge so that's def my favorite thing about it

I've made this wonderful tasty recipe a few times! I've added provolone chunks, pepperoni, zucchini chunks, basil, cherry tomatoes, and sometimes ham chunks instead of the pepperoni, to the existing recipe. It really looks pretty and it's the first salad to disappear! Big crowd pleaser!

This was a huge hit with everyone.  You can pretty much do whatever you want with it. I added the little mini round pepperoni slices and black olives to it.

I don't eat this but make it for my daughter and husband. I leave out the red onion, they aren't the fans lol. My husband adds shrimp to his, he says its awesome! My daughter leaves out the peppers as well and adds chicken. She don't care if it's little strips, canned, or grilled. She loves it! It makes a great and easy lunch to take about.

Love it! Second time I made it, I was out of Caesar dressing-- left it out and it was still delicious. Perfect for adding your favorite veggies and/or Italian meats (mini pepperoni, salami cut into strips, etc.). A keeper.

I made this last night and it was great. I used red onion, green pepper, a tomato and cubes of colby jack cheese (what I had in the refrigerator). My friend loved it and asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a cookout, it was devoured so fast! Almost everyone there had seconds and thirds and all the girls wanted the recipe! It really is delicious and the nice thing is that you really can add whatever you want to it. I chose pepperoni, tomatoes, and peppers. Cannot wait to make it again this weekend for another cookout!

This is a great salad prepared as directed, but it is also a fantastic base to work off of!! The longer it was refrigerated the better the flavor, in my opinion. I added some sliced up pepperoni and it came out fantastic. Great to take to the beach!

Great dressing combination, great easy salad.  I used Cardini's  Caesar Dressing with Wishbone Italian.  I added items I like such as black olives, halved grape tomatoes,  etc.  This will be my "go to"
pasta salad.  Thanks.

This was great. Fast, easy, good. I cut back on the dressing a bit (probably 2/3 or 3/4 a cup) but only because I didn't have as much on hand as I thought. Didn't affect the flavor at all. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. My family loved it. I made some changes when I made it though. I added some mint mayonnaise and oregano. It tasted great. I also added tomatoes to it which give it a tangy fresh sweet taste.

My son loves this so much he asked me to make it at 2 parties.  You can really compliment it with any vegetable you want...I added olives.  The combo of the two dressings gives it a great satisfying flavor.

I love this pasta salad! The two dressings are the best part! I made the recipe as directed the first time. Peppers are not my favorite, though, so the second time I subbed tomatoes and cucumbers and kept the red onion. Fantastic! Even better the next day! It would also be good with a little grilled chicken. I gave the recipe 4 stars as it, but 5 stars with the tomatoes and cukes instead of the peppers. Also a very pretty salad for company or to take somewhere.

It was ok. Nothing to go crazy over. I think it could use more flavour...mind you, I didn't have the full amount of Caesar dressing on hand so I used a 1/4 cup of Caesar dressing, mayo and Italian dressing. Also added a hint of parsley.

I have always been a professed pasta salad hater. I made this as an option at a barbecue alongside a mayonnaise based macaroni salad, and my husband convinced me to try it once I mixed it all up. I really liked it, I was not expecting to, as I don't typically like Italian dressing at all, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I am making it this week as a side to a beef roast and I'm actually looking forward to it :-) I made it exactly as written, but may add some black olives this time, I think that would be a nice addition.

This recipe was a delicious spin on the traditional Italian pasta salad with Italian dressing. The dressing combination makes this pasta salad scrumptious. To make it a bit healthier I used yogurt based Caesar dressing, found in the produce section called Caesar Parmigiano, that was 45 calories and 2.5 grams fat per 2 tbsps. It went perfect with the brand name Lite House Italian dressing with similar nutrition information I used. I would highly recommend the Caesar dressing I used as full calorie tasting alternative to the actual full calorie versions, in fact it might be a bit tastier. At first I used the dressings in proportions given in the recipe and it was delicious, but to make it creamier for my tastes I ended up using about 15% more Caesar then Italian. I’m not a big fan of bell peppers, so I used my preference of veggies including broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, red onion, and black olives which were terrific. Next time I might add sugar snap peas. I brought some to share with my co-workers and they couldn’t get enough of this salad. This recipe is a great non-run-of-the-mill pasta salad base that you can dress up with your favorite veggies and add-ins. I highly recommend it as a fantastic make ahead lunch for work or to bring to a summer cook out, you won’t be disappointed!

This was a very good pasta salad. Not overly creamy like some others I've tried. I just threw on some sliced black olives and some mini pepperoni. I will keep this for my go-to pasta salad.

Added cubed mozzarella to it, but kept everything else as it called for and it was excellent! The Caesar and Italian mix was awesome together! Made a day ahead and it was fantastic the next day.

decreased parmesan to 1/2 cup, stirred in carrots, cucumber, 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 onion.  Also added mini pepperoni and a little shredded cheddar.  Now that is my kind of pasta salad!

OMG this is sooo good and easy to make.  This is a good base recipe and you can add a lot of different things to the salad to personalize it.  I added pepperoni, cucumbers, and cheddar cheese.  I could eat this every night and it was a big hit at our party.

Happy Accident - 
I usually make this pasta salad exactly according to the recipe, but I goofed this year...and I'm glad I did! I had 3 dressings on my grocery list - Italian, Creamy Caesar and Ranch. For some reason I thought I was supposed to add 1 cup of each to this recipe so in they all went. After I realized I goofed and the ranch was for something else I was making, my pasta salad now had a whole extra cup of dressing. So, I made up more rotini and decided I now had to add more "stuff" to this salad. In went black olives, green olives, cucumber, plum tomatoes, and more parmesan cheese to make up for my mistake and absorb some of this dressing. Amazing! Had the hubby do a taste test and immediately got "Mmmmmmm....." followed a few minutes later by "Don't you dare add anything else to that salad, I can still taste it and it's perfect!!" LOL! Giving it 5 stars even though I made changes, because it really is great as-is....but I'm glad I goofed and will now add all of these new items going forward. 
**I did end up having to add slightly more dressing after all of these additions and I used a bit more Italian and Creamy Caesar.

Delicious! I left out the green/red pepper and onion instead I added tomatoes (making sure to gut out the seeds) and added a little bit of Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb. 

I made it as a quick light dinner, everyone loved it!
Great recipe to have when you want to use the left over dressings.

This salad is so versatile you may add many fresh veggies plus dressing of choice (only 1 bottle).  Also, the addition of salad supreme from spice aisle kicks up the flavor.

Had some leftover rotini pasta in the fridge and some lives on teh shelf, so thought I would search for a pasta salad recipe. I liked the idea of the mix of dressings. I skipped the green pepper, added chopped olives and actually quick sauteed the onion and a small handful of sun dried tomatoes in the olive juice. I left it cool and tossed it all together. Used a little less dressing than called for and used fat free versions of each to reduce the calories. YUMMMMMY.

I loved this pasta salad!  I have never tried a pasta salad I really liked before, ever, until I tried this one.  This is definitely a keeper.  I will FOR SURE make this again!  The only change I made was to use half an onion instead of a whole one.  Also, as a note, Parmesan cheese is listed in the ingredients, but then never listed in the instructions.  Easy enough to figure out when to add it, but just thought I'd mention it.

This was very good. The blend of creamy caesar and italian was what makes this dish. My changes (for personal preference only) were to omit the peppers. I added two tomates diced, a quarter red onion diced, sliced black olives and fresh pepper. Delicious!

This Pasta Salad is AWESOME! I have made it a few times now, and EVERY time I am told how it's the best pasta salad people have had. It's so good and the combination of the dressings are delicious. I make it exactly how the recipe says, but I add sliced up black olives and also sliced pepperoni into small strips for an extra kick. Again, this is the best Pasta Salad and I will never make a different version!! YUM!!

This pasta salad is always requested at family gatherings and events!  It's great exactly as the recipe is.  However, to make it a little more flavorful I also add a small can of chopped olives and some chunks of salami and cheddar cheese.

This pasta was very good except the onion was too overpowering. Next time, I will make it with less onion.

I really liked this recipe as did my family. I used wheat pasta to make it a bit healthier and really loved the crunch from the fresh onion and peppers. This recipe makes a huge amount and certainly enough for a large gathering. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was so versalite!  I love it.  I adjusted my salad based on what I had on hand.  I used the two dressings, chopped white onions, cucumbers, chopped tomatoes, celery, kalamata olives and whole wheat spaghetti (broken into pieces).  It was so light and delicious.  Perfect for a hot day like today.

I really like this recipe, although I did add a few things. Used broccli, red pepper, cheese crumbles and cucumber. I only needed about half the amount of dressing it called for.

So great and everything I had on hand. I didn't add the red bell peppers (didn't have them), but I will next time. We added some corn niblets, did bowtie pasta, and sliced sausage to the dish. It turned out very very well. Everyone enjoyed it!

Good pasta salad, only change I would make is to chop the bell peppers very fine, but overall very good. I'll save this recipe and use again.

Good pasta salad.  I added pepperoni slices, which I will omit next time.  Loved the shredded Parmasan cheese on this.

Very good!  Everyone liked the combination of the sauce.  I only added a green pepper because red peppers are a lot more expensive around here...and also we don't like onion!

Excellent and easy salad to make plus it tastes delicious!!! As others have said it sounds like lots of salad dressing but it's just the right amount!!!
