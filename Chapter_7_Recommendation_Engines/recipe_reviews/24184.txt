Great mix! I like to add white chocolate chips to it sometimes.

I was originally going to make it for a friend who has a very limiting diet but it never made it out of the house!  My husband & I finished it off in record time.  I will definitely make this again.

Very nice combo...though "not me" had wiped out my macadamia nuts so I had to sub hazelnuts. Still looking for the macadamia culprit....LOL Thanks for sharing! First Faceless Frenzy Western Allstars 2012

This recipe has been included in our last three progressive Christmas parties and the bowl is just about empty at the end of the hour, as are the six or so other tempting appetizer dishes served to our 40 guests; which makes the Festive Nut Bowl a proven hit.

This was super fast and easy to put together and it all disappeared just about as fast.  Nice combination of salty and sweet Loved it as is but would try substitutions next time with ingredients on hand.
