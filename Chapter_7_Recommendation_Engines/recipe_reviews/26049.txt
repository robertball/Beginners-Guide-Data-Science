Perhaps I did something wrong, but I'm pretty sure I followed the recipe exactly.  My cake was very brown after 30 min, but it was still raw inside...it took 50 min to bake completely, so all the edges ended up being really brown (after 30 min I turned down the oven temp to try and prevent over-browning).  The cake itself was also brown on the inside, which I thought was strange.  It had an ok texture, but it didn't have much of a pineapple flavor and wasn't very sweet.  Maybe using pineapple in syrup instead of natural juice would have worked better.  I'd also do it at a lower temp. right from the beginning if I were to make it again.  On the plus side, it was easy to make and there wasn't much clean-up required!

A very interesting cake - mine turned out fluffy and sticky, a little chewy.  The top did get brown, but not excessively so.  The inside was a nice golden yellow.  The flavor was good, it had some nice pieces of pineapple but wasn't too sweet.  I cooked mine for 15 min at 350 but turned the temp down to 325 when I saw the top starting to brown.  I then cooked it for another 16 or 17 minutes until the inside was done.  Very, very easy.

I thought this was ok but it had an odd texture - it was too moist for me.  Also, I felt it tasted like it's missing something, a bit of salt might help that.

Was easy to make and tasty too.  It gave me an idea also to add to it.  I cut the pinapple in 1/2 and added manderine orange to it it also taste great.  When done I sprinkled alittle cinnamon on top and whipcream.

This cake is delicious yet so fast and easy.I dont have a sheet pan so I used a large spring form.I lowered the temp to about 160 and baked for 50 minutes.I served it with vanilla ice cream and a warm mandarin orange sauce.Both my husband and I loved it and it is something I will make again and serve to guests.For those of you who might like to try it this way,the sauce is simply made with a small can of mandarin pieces with juice,1/4 c sugar,1 Tbsp lemon juice and 1 Tbsp corn starch.Mix the 3 ingredients in a small sauce pan,bring slowly to a boil and allow to boil gently for about 3 minutes or until thickened.Enjoy!

I followed the directions exactly - how could I not?  They were simple and straight forward.  The cake caved in the middle, the top browned a lot, and the cake didn't even taste good.  I was trying to find a recipe that didn't call for butter/margarine/shortening as I was out - I should have just waited until I went to the grocery store.  I'm sorry for the negative review, but this just wasn't good.

Excellent recipe! I'm sure it would be great with cream cheese frosting, but still is great just as is - and a lot less fat!!

This cake is delicious.  However, the texture is sort of rubbery.  I've made similar cakes with the same result.  I'll continue to hunt for a basic pineapple cake with a texture I  like.  I didn't make the frosting, so cannot comment on that, but I imagine the combo is excellent.

This cake is one of our family's favs.  A suggestion of mine would be never to mix these ingredients with a mixer. Just put all ingredients into a large bowl, and mix together by hand. I cook mine at 350 for approximately 35 minutes.  The only question I have about this cake is why does it always sink in the center?  Been making it for years and it always has.  Is there anyone out there that can tell me why this happens and what to do to avoid it, if possible? 
 
For the frosting I've always made a cream cheese mixture.  Will tell you what I mix together. Frosting; 1 1/3 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 stick of softened butter, 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup chopped nuts.  Ice cake while still warm.   We love the cake, just wish it wouldn't sink in the middle.

I made this in a 9 x 13 pan, and it took about an hour and 10 minutes to bake.  I covered it halfway thought with foil when it started to brown, and turned the temp down to 250.  I too noticed that it was brown on the inside when it was done, and not as sweet as I had hoped.  However, it was very easy to make, and very tasty!

The cake is interesting...I made a few changes. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Since it was pretty brown after just 20min, I covered it with folio and continued to bake for an additional 25min.

A really easy and yummy cake! Almost spongey in texture, unlike most cakes w/o fat, which can be overly moist (good in some cases - ie brownies - but not in others). I cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup and also used pineapple in natural juice. I also baked it in a loaf tin rather than in a sheet pan, so I had to increase the cooking time slightly. This was perfect for our indoor picnic! Thank you Beverly!

Wow!  What a quick and easy delicious treat with the most basic of ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly as posted and baked for 25 minutes in a sheet pan.  It's a lovely brown on top.  I had planned to ice it, but it's too good as is.  A definite addition to the recipe box.

I think this is delicious, sticky and sweet... but my husband didn't like it and he loves all the sweets I bake. I brought some to work to settle the dispute and everyone at work liked it. 

The recipe appealed to me because there's no butter and I was trying to make something healthy and sweet. This hit the spot for me!

Spongy, moist and sticky.  The texture doesn't taste like eating a cake.  It took me 55 minutes to bake the whole cake.

My cake also came out brown. It was a birthday cake for lady at work and my first time baking it so I had to try it. Now I have to either make a new cake or find a plate to put it on. It's very big but tasty. I made my own buttercream frosting.

This was a very easy cake to make, and I had high hopes since no oil was used.  It came out looking nice, and it was very spongy.  However it's way too moist - I covered the pan with plastic wrap and the next morning the entire top of the cake came off with the wrap!  So, I couldn't use it for it's intended purpose (Father's Day picnic).  Also, since it's such a moist cake I was worried about it getting moldy in room temp, so I'd suggest others keep it in the fridge when storing.

We really liked this cake--not too sweet. It could not be easier to put together. I used it for an adult's birthday cake with Cool Whip on top. It will def. appear again in this household. Weight Watchers---4 points for a good size piece. Enjoy guilt free!

In a 9x13 coated pan, drained off 1/4 cup pineapple juice (using the rest), substituted 1/3c brown sugar with 1 1/3c white & no dipping in the middle... although that issue could be a natural sagging of the sheet pan or just the “coolest” spot. I can’t wait to taste it, it smells wonderful!!

Delicious cake! Wonderful spongy texture. I made using one 9x13 and one 8x8 pan instead. I added 1/2 cup shredded coconut.

It bakes up beautifully. I used fresh pineapple and did it as a layer cake, with a filling and a frosting using the Pineapple Filling recipe from this website. I’m having it with a side of raspberry jam and some orange juice right now.I bet it’d be good with coconut too.

I found this recipe quite easy to make. I only used one cup of sugar and it was sweet  enough. I used 14 oz can of pineapple instead of 20 oz. I baked it for 40mins and it was fully cooked. Golden brown on the top and quite moist in the middle.
I'll make this again.

I made this exactly as directed and it turned out fine. I wouldn't say it's a new family favorite, but served with whipped cream it was a nice light dessert in a pinch, and it was quick and easy. The texture is spongy, but it seems intentional and is not unappealing. It's very moist. I'd like to try it under some cut up fruit strawberry-shortcacke-style, or maybe even served under Bananas  Foster.

Even with chunked pineapple in a Bundt pan, it was still incredibly easy and extremely tasty. Got rave reviews by everyone who ate it!

I used a square cake pan, and baked longer...It was very delicious and simple ingredients (without butter?) WOW! I even over baked it a little, but it was still great.  THANKS for the recipe! Bam Bam!

This cake definitely needs cream cheese frosting. All in all, it's pretty good. The cake is moist, although not very sweet. You can't feel guilty eating it though!
