There are two good reasons why this recipe is a 5-star meal: First, at any given time, the average health-conscious person has all of these ingredients in her kitchen, which makes it so convenient. And second, the flavors and spices are spot on! I've made it several times as is and I feel like I can now mention my own twists on the original. One, replace the butter with equal amount coconut oil for a healthier fat and complimentary flavor with the ginger. Two, don't puree it! It is such a pretty stew as is! And three, the last five minutes of simmering, throw in about 4 cups of fresh, chopped spinach for a boost in color and nutrients. Take my word for it--this recipe is worth making!

Delicious! I didn't puree it, instead I just made it like a stew. Everyone who tasted it thought it was great. Def will make again.

This soup is sooooo great! I made it vegan by using olive oil instead of butter and also omitted the yogurt. I also cut salt by using low-sodium broth, and found that I did not need to add salt to season when it was done. Lovely, hearty, and filling. I really liked the mild sweetness with a bit of heat.

This was very good, although I made just a few changes. I used ginger powder, because I didn't have fresh, and I substituted olive oil for butter. I also added several cloves of garlic, minced, and a few parsnips I had left over, and I did NOT puree the soup, because I do not like the texture of pureed soup. I served it over a mixture of brown and white basmati rice. This made a wonderful, hearty, vegan meal.

This recipe was really yummy!  I was a little skeptical mixing apples, onions, carrots, sweet potatoes and lentils together, but it turned out be so good and hearty.  I followed the recipe to the letter and did not deviate on any of the measurements. My husband is not a big soup person, but he loved it so much, he went back for seconds! My kids, ages 5 & 6, loved it too! The plain yogurt added a really good kick, although it probably would have been good with sour cream as well.  I will definitely keep this recipe in the file. :-)

Delicious soup!! I changed the prep method up though. I coarsely chopped up all the veggies and apple and tossed them in a lightly sprayed roasting pan, I then lightly sprayed them and seasonsed them with all the spices. I roasted them for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. I then tossed all the roasted veggies in a pot with the lentils and vegetable stock and simmered until the lentils were done and then pureed. Turned out amazing and cut the fat having not used any butter.

I always put carrots in my lentil soup so when I saw this used apples and sweet potato it sounded good. I made a big batch using the whole lb package of those grey-green lentils and increased other items accordingly. I didnt puree it. Left other ingrediants in chunks which is helpful to know for those without a blender. The family wants me to make lots more of it this fall and winter!

This was so good that I didn't want anyone else to eat it but me! I made it for my roommates and they all raved.  I made it just like the recipe, and served it with yogurt and a sprinkle of paprika for a nice look Nest time I make it I might add more apple though. It would probably bee great with sour cream too. I also served them with a side of grilled polenta slices, I feel like the soup would be good with something crunchy to eat along with it. All in all I will definitely be making this again.

Love this recipe...so unique by adding the apple. I didn't have red lentils so I used green and I added some red chillies to give it an extra kick. It is very comforting and filing. Thanks!

A keeper! This was better than expected. I used olive oil instead of butter, chicken broth instead of veg. broth and cream instead of yogurt. Great for a middle eastern or indian dinner party. Will surely make it again.

This soup is awesome!  Much better than I expected.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I did substitue olive oil for the butter and powdered ginger for the fresh.  I also could not find red lentils, so I used the green.  The color of the soup was not appealing, but the taste more than made up for it.  I will try harder next time to find the red lentils, just to make the appearance better.  My husband loved this too and asked for it again tonight.  Off to the store!

The description is dead on: this is a wonderful cold-weather soup, and it just screams "autumn" to me. I know some people don't like pureed soups, but this one has an amazing texture once it's blended very smoothly. I modified this a bit... I make 99% of my soups in the crockpot because I am a busy student, and since this one is pureed anyway, it doesn't matter how mushy things get. It also allows me to leave out the butter. Instead of garnishing with plain yogurt, I added a can of coconut milk once everything was cooked soft and before I pureed it... that's just personal preference, as I really like coconut and curry together, but it went well with the rest of the ingredients and wasn't too sweet. All in all, this is a great soup, and will definitely make it again!

Good soup, with a nice mix of flavors that blend together well.  It's a little on the spicy side, but mildly spicy.  I may leave it chunky rather than pureeing next time, but that is just a personal preference.  I think I would like to double the amount of lentils next time to increase healthy protein, also increasing the vegetable broth or adding some water to accomodate the additional lentils.  EDIT:  I made this again, this time leaving it chunky and also using 1/4 cup more lentils, (extra 1 cup veg. broth).  We now think this soup could be 10 stars, preferring the chunky 'stew' over a puree.

This soup was delicious!  I followed it quite closely, except for some minor adjustments:  I sauteed the ginger with the onion at the beginning, I used chicken broth instead, and I added extra cumin.  Here's one HEALTHY AND TIME-SAVING TIP:  Don't peel!  The healthiest part of most veggies gets thrown out when you peel them, so just scrub the sweet potatoes, carrots, and apple instead.  It's just as good, and a tad healthier.  (If you're concerned about pesticide residues, buy organic.)  Thanks, Zhidaoma!

I only gave this a 3 star rating because although the flavor was great to me it is not worth the time it takes to prepare the meal.  I will save this meal for special occations such has family holiday get togethers or pot luck dinners.  Also next time I think I will leave it as a stew instead of pureeing it (pureeing it gives it a babyfood look and tecture).

Fantastic! And very flexible. I haD no red lentils, red beans worked just fine. A dash of cinamon and olive oil for butter I also added some pressed garlic, cayenne pepper. Greek yogurt on top! So so so good! Pretty sure you can't go wrong with this one! I just wish it didn't look like diarrhea when pureed, but with the yogurt garnish it looks ok. I pureed the whole thing too, I left all of the skins on, and it worked well. Going to be making this a lot! Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

So delicious! It tastes rich and creamy, but it's so low-fat. I substituted olive oil for the butter, and skipped the yogurt to make it vegan. I used quinoa instead of the lentils to give it more protein. I served it with crusty wheat bread. Really good!

This recipe is BLAND, just as I expected it to be, so here are a couple hints to take it from blah to WOW!  Anytime I cook with aromatics or ground spices, I sauté them before adding liquids.  A lot of these herbs and spices only release their flavor under high heat and/or fat. Adding them in with the stock before sautéing is basically just wasting them. So, take the time to slightly brown or caramelize (lightly brown, not burn) the veggies and apples, then add in the spices, ginger, and garlic and stir for 30 seconds, or until they are very fragrant.  Continue on with the recipe from here on out.  Purée or not, according to your own palate! I like mine as a stew with more texture, personally. Happy cooking!

Great recipe!  If you want a sweeter twist on this, add in an extra apple, 1 tsp cinnamon & 2 Tbsp brown sugar.  I pureed it and thought the color was great, it reminded me of butternut squash soup.

This is SO good!  I pureed it because I like creamy textured soups.  Also, I couldn't find vegetable stock so I used chicken bouillon cubes.  I only had two left (and was not going to run to the store a third time!) so I used 3 cups water to the 2 cubes--it still turned out GREAT!  Next time I will add more apple and less carrot--I don't like the taste of cooked carrots and you can taste them in some bites :)  Served it with fresh sourdough bread and a little plop of sour cream on top (instead of plain yogurt).  Love how healthy it is--Overall super yummy and FABULOUS on a cool evening.

Very good for a healthier option.  I used chicken broth (and less salt to compensate) but otherwise followed the recipe.  I made this for my sister's birthday and everyone seemed to like it, although they didn't believe me that I hadn't added cream, milk, cream cheese, etc. to the soup.  I did add the dollop of Greek yogurt which I think added a lot.

I didn't change a thing and the recipe was great.  Great flavor and the perfect amount for a family dinner.  We added some milk to thin and topped with plain honey yogurt.  Very good!

This soup is amazing!  It's the perfect mixture of slightly sweet w/ spicy undertones!  My children loved it, especially my little, one year old, sweet potato addict!  Good even during the Spring when the weather can be a little wet & cold.  The only change I made was I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.

Yum!  This was great.  I added extra chicken stock and extra lentils, as well as extra spices plus some hot sauce and apple cider vinegar.  Let it cook for awhile so a lot of the vegetables fell apart but did not puree as we like the stew-ness of it.  Great flavor, filling, healthy, easy, and inexpensive = 5 stars!

Very good and easy soup! I added a bit of curry powder and a dash of cinnamon to add a little more spice. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable since I didn't have it on hand and omitted the salt. I threw it all in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low and it turned out great! My husband even liked it, and he was pretty wary of the recipe when I first showed it to him.

Delicious! Used 2 tablespoons olive oil instead of butter. Also, I omitted the ginger due to a guest allergy and cut the black pepper and chili powder in half (again, for guest preference). Served with plain Greek yogurt and crusty bread.  Added approximately 2 cups of additional vegetable broth after pureeing and transferred to a slow cooker set on warm until serving time.  Will absolutely make again!

This was an amazing soup---  my husband and I think it was one of the best soups we've ever tasted!   Changes---  for health reasons, I did NOT use butter--  i used 1 TBSP of canola oil to sautee the veggies.   I halved the salt (used 1/2 tsp).  Used 2 cans chicken broth, plus water to get the liquid level to 4 cups  (I did not have vegetable broth on-hand).  We'll do this recipe regularly, since it was so healthy & delicious!!!!  5+ stars from me!

I was skeptical cuz' I'm not a sweet potato fan. OMG! This soup was amazing. I made it and let it sit for 2 days in the fridge. Reheated on the stove and thinned it out with more broth. My girlfriends went back for seconds. I left the skin on the apple and used Earth balance instead of butter.

One of the BEST recipes I've ever found!  Easy, and completely unique, soup.  I followed the recipe to a T, except used 3/4 c. brown lentils (instead of a 1/2 c. red lentils), and sour cream instead of plain yogurt as we already had it on hand.  Amazing flavors - yum!!!

Sorry, but I don't get all the high reviews.  I thought this was strange and bland.  I made it just like the recipe said and I was really let down.  I won't be making this again.

My family (DH + 3 adult children + 1 SIL) didn't like this soup at all. Me? I LOVED it. And I've got another 6 serving batch brewing in my crockpot/slow cooker as I type. DELICIOUS!

Awesomely delicious!  After reading some of the reviews and because of personal preference: replaced butter with coconut oil; did not peel anything; shredded the carrots and apple; used 3/4 cup lentils; 1/8 tsp powdered ginger in place of the fresh; no salt or chili powder; curry in place of cumin; cayenne in place of paprika; 2 cups vege broth, 2 cups chicken broth and 1 1/2 cup coconut milk in place of the 6 cups vege broth; and added fresh baby kale and spinach to the final product about 5 minutes before serving.  I know this is a lot of changes, but would never have put this together without the original recipe posted here and that would be a shame!  Thanks for sharing, zhidaoma!

Very good, and very good for you.  I thought it lacked a little flavor (kind of plain) but it's so nutritious I probably will make again.  My hubby loved it!
I added chicken broth to thin it out at the end, not water.  I added a little more salt than what was called for.

Delicious! This was surprisingly hearty and flavorful! I loved the mix of sweet and spicy! I modified this recipe to use what I had at home. I didn't have carrots, so I couldn't add those. I added celery because I needed to use it. I used regular lentils instead of red lentils. I used Red Delicious apples. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth. I added two cloves of minced garlic. I used less than 1/8 tsp of ground ginger instead of fresh ginger. I also halved the salt. This was a GOOD idea because it turned out being very flavorful. Anymore salt and it would have been too much. I did not puree it because I love chunky soup. Next time I might add a little more chicken broth (maybe 1 cup) and simmer it a little longer. Some of the lentils needed to be cooked longer.

Well, I have to give this five stars too! I wasn't really sure what it would taste like, since I'd never put sweet potatoes in a stew or soup before! But our temps dropped here, making it a good soup night. I found I had not a drop of broth in the house of any flavor, so ended up using ham base for the background flavoring. I figured ham went okay with the sweet potatoes, apples and lentils, so it should work. It did! I also left out the chili powder, since it didn't seem to make sense with the other flavorings. (I didn't want yam chili.) We had a pot of VERY yummy stew. I only did a little bit with the immersion blender, leaving the majority in small pieces. I added a little instant mashed potatoes for more thickness, and left out the yogurt (wasn't needed). I also added a couple dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce to enhance everything. It was very good, and we are having the leftovers tonight! I think this beats split pea soup. We'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing the unusual combination!

My family love this soup, I used green lentils only because I couldn't find red.   I added 3 cloves of garlic, because we love garlic.  This is a sweet-savory soup and its delicious!  I used a hand held immersion blender and it was not messy and no transferring from pot to blender.

5 stars!!!  I made this dish for baby food.  My 8 month loves this!  I did modify it by cutting the spices in half, just because he is a youngster.  I will make this dish for the rest of the family this winter.

Well, I figure it's time I update this review.

This recipe is a staple for me! It's always filling and delicious. Here's a few tricks I've tried:

Purple onion adds a stronger onion flavor, if that's your thing.

Veganizes easily - just swap butter for olive oil as you think appropriate - I don't usually need 1/4 cup, but YMMV. If you do this, you may want to add salt if you usually use salted butter. 

Yes, yams work fine!

Red lentils give the best color, but it's totally not worth the trip to Whole Foods to get them - regular lentils (that are $1/pound) just make it slightly darker at the end and taste just as good.

Smoked paprika is a nice touch if you happen to have it on hand.

I tried this recipe over the weekend.  I used olive oil in place of the butter and did not puree it but beyond that followed the recipe exactly. I have to say it is now one of my favorite soup recipes.  It was even better the second day. Often wanted to try it but was never sure I would like the combination.  I am so glad I did.  Love it! Love it!  Thank you for sharing it.

What a yummy soup! I subbed evvo instead of butter like others suggested. I pureed some for me, and left it hearty for my boyfriend, and served with sour cream and some corn muffins. I'll definitely be making this again - lots more times!

This recipe was lovely.  i didn't have any apples so I added unsweetened apple sauce instead.  It came out a bit too sweet for me so next time I'll add more lentils and less sweet potato.  I used olive oil instead of butter.

This soup is incredible, but I changed it quite a bit: I had extra pureed poumpkin that I wanted to use up, and added it instead of the 2nd sweet potato. I also added black beans instead of red lentils simply bc my store doesn't supply them.  The chili powder and cumin got doubled, and like another reviewer, I didn't puree it, but rather mashed it a bit to maintain some texture. DELICIOUS!

This soup is awesome. I didn't have vegetable broth, so I used half chicken and half beef (it was all I had - I thought it would be weird but it tastes great).  I also tripled the chili powder, but followed the recipe exactly besides that. This is also really low in weight watchers points :)  The only negative is that it doesn't look very pretty. My husband called it "baby poop soup". *sigh*

This is okay, but I won't make it again.  It's a very sweet soup and the flavors taste as you would expect if you blended sweet potato, carrots, and apples together. Definitely better before pureeing...after the puree, it is very similar to baby food.

I'm not usually a fan of pureed soups, but this one is fantastic. I used 1.5 tbs of olive oil to saute the veggies and cut the butter out completely. I also omitted the salt as the veggie broth has enough salt for me. Easily one of the best soups I've ever made.

I liked this soup a lot but others thought it a bit sweet.  I omitted the butter and used smoked paprika.  It was simple to make and a comforting meal on a cold day.  Thanks for sharing.

THIS IS A MUST TRY RECIPE! The only changes I made were to use regular lentils/organic, substituted 1/2 t. powdered ginger(but would use fresh next time), and 4 chicken bouillon cubes with 4 cups boiling water instead of the vegetable broth.  I did not 'add water to thin the soup' nor garnish with yogurt.  
This is a truly wonderful - hearty soup & it's super healthy as it does not call for cream as so many creamy soups do.

This was delicious! Only thing I didn't add was the red lentils (forgot to buy them) – but it was so tasty just the same. The suggestion to use a stick blender works very well, and you only need to puree as much (velvety) or as little (chunkier) for consistency as you want.

Loved this soup!  I did add an extra apple (unpeeled) and a can of light coconut milk. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I was concerned that the chili powder, black pepper, and cumin would be overpowering, but the spice mix was perfect!
I'll be making this again and again.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and pureed just half of the soup. I also used half olive oil and half butter.  Next time, I may use even less of both.  I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch today with some brown bread.

Edible but not something we would make again. We added some fresh rosemary and cilantro leftover from another recipe but otherwise made as written. Even with fresh herbs added, it didn’t have the depth of flavor we were expecting given the combination of ingredients. Finely had to add some other spices to make it more desirable.

This is so delicious. I did not puree it, instead I left it as a stew. The flavors are wonderful. I was hesitant about having the apple in there, but I loved it and would actually add a second apple next time I make it.

This is a hearty vegan soup.  It had wonderful flavor.  If I were to fix it again, I'd do like some of the other reviewers did and keep it chunky like a stew.  I think adding some ham might be nice also if you need a little more protein.

I thought this was going to be weird, but it was INCREDIBLE! Made it per the recipe. I have no blender lid so I used a potato masher while still in the pot. Made it chunky, think, and yummy!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The lentils didn't cook thoroughly, there ended up being too much sweet potato, not enough flavoring and it was overall just disappointed.  If I were to repeat the recipe, which I won't, I would suggest medium, rather than large potatoes, longer cook time and more seasoning.

This is delicious...So good that our 10month old twins downed nearly as much as we did. Not a huge onion fan so only used a half, will try the full next time. Also pureed only a portion, making more like a stew. Going to try more lentils next time.

One of my favorites! Everyone loves it, even my meat-loving husband. It's also easily made vegan and is gluten free so it's great for anyone with dietary requirements. The flavor is amazing. Using a stick blender makes this soup so easy to prepare too. It usually turns out pretty think, so I recommend extra broth to thin it out.

Also good not pureed, just mash a little with a slotted spatula. I put in a pear instead of the apple and it gave it a slightly exotic twist. My one and a half year old loved it too and it's practically a meal in bowl.

This one is a winner!  I didn't have paprika so I left it out, and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  The soup tastes good un-pureed, but it's not very pretty so I'd recommend puree-ing it if you're going to serve it to guests.

You don't need to change a thing.  This recipe is perfect.  Like a bisque but you don't get that "I just ate a pound of butter/cream" feeling afterwards!!!

I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because I didn't have any

This was really really good! My husband thought it was a bit spicy but his tolerance for heat is low. I'm only mentioning that in case you have the same type person in your family. I loved it...my kids liked it...I served with plain greek yogurt and also put sour cream on the table for my kids b/c they like sour cream on all soups just about. I used cooking spray instead of butter and it all worked fine! I will definitely make again!

Bursting with flavor.  I used our homemade vegetable broth mix.  4 tbs. celery seed,  3 tsp. thyme, 4 tbs. oregano, 6 tsp. garlic powder, 3 tsp. margoram, and 1 tsp. pepper per cup of warm water.

This is good. This is really good. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and extra virgin coconut oil instead of butter. I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken and I shredded the apple. Very healthy, and caretenoids have been found to help skin glow golden! My waistline didn't like it as much as my skin, though...when soup is this good I have no self control!

We were nervous about eating a sweet potato soup but we wanted to try a lentil soup and this was one of the top ones listed so we thought we would give it a try. It was suprisingly delicious, I cant say Ive ever had anything like it but it was definitely worth trying. We used shredded carrots to save time and a braeburn apple because of its flavor, but I dont think it matters. The best part was the subtle sweet flavor with a kick.

Excellent...Excellent. My whole family loved it, including 5 children ranging from 2 to 8 years old. The key to making this successful is to puree only half of the soup. You want the texture of the vegetables, so nobody is thrown off by the baby food puree texture. But at the same time you want to blend the flavors of the sweet(sweet potato, carrots, and apples) and the spicy (ginger, chili powder, paprika, pepper)...I did change it a lil bit but using 1 sweet, and 1 reg potato......A dopple of yogurt on top is an added bonus, use yogurt folks, not sour cream. It does make a difference. I served this over white basmati rice, and a salad for a full meal.

This was great. Loved the flavor combination. I wish I had used a larger apple or two small apples- next time. I used olive oil instead of butter due to personal preference. I topped with goat cheese as I did not have plain yogurt in the house.

Phenomenal.  Made it as stated, though I am sure i put in at least a tablespoon of the fresh minced ginger as I just can't seem to help myself -- i love ginger.  Comfort food at it's best.  Sweet, savory, a little bit of spice.  Amazing.  Wonderful.  WOW.  It's SO good.

Delicious! This has become my Fall 2010 favorite soup recipe. It is so versatile; I have topped it with sour cream or light cream cheese, chives, toasted almonds, you name it. I add a dash each of cinnamon and nutmeg and a few Tbsp of brown sugar b/c I prefer to add a little sweetness. I also double the spices. There are so many different ways to change it to suit your preference. 5 stars!!

Hum. I won't say it's bad, it's ok. It is healthy when you cut out the butter, use a little evoo, and I doubled all the spices and added an extra granny smith apple. I tried it over brown rice and didn't think that did much for it. I tried the greek yogurt and then tried some with feta. I'd say the greek yogurt suits it best. I think this soup definitely needs to meld the flavors for a day. Like I said, I doubled the spice, added some curry, threw in a handful of spinach for extra benefits...and it was ok. We ate it but not sure I'd rave over this one.

Very filling and soooooo tasty! Kids loved it as well.. I did put less chilli and pepper only because my kids are sensitive to spice.  We used sour cream and crushed sundried tomato wheat thins as topper. 5 star. Also I threw all this in the croc pot on low for 5 hours..then pureed.. easy peasy

This recipe was the base for all my left over Thanksgiving dinner.  I used left over sweet potatoe casserole, homemade applesauce, left over carrots, left over chicken stock, put it all together and it came out awesome.  Great way to get rid of the leftovers that stuck around the refrig.  I did already have the red lentils in the pantry.  Try it you'll love this!!! Nice and spicy...

Really good soup.  Very different.  I made the recipe as directed except I substituted sour cream for the yogurt (what I had on hand).  I needed to add a bit of extra water after the puree to get a better consistency.  The balance of spices and flavors is really nice. No one flavor overpowers the others but everything's in there.  My husband and I really liked it.

I thought this recipe was great. I used an immersion blender and blended it to a consistency that was still a little bit chunky. I wouldn't bother with blending if I didn't have an immersion blender, it would just complicate things too much and add too much work. With an immersion blender this recipe was simple and satisfying. 

Made two changes based on what I had:
1. used olive oil instead of butter
2. used water instead if stock

My husband and I found that it was not lacking in flavor or anything.

I've been meaning to make this recipe for a while and finally did so for (Canadian) Thanksgiving. Made this exactly as stated and my guests were raving. I boiled the soup for over 30 minutes so perhaps more liquid evaporated than if it boiled for only 30 minutes. The only thing I might do a little different is add half a cup of broth at the end because I found the consistency with only 4 cups to be too thick for a soup. All-in-all: don't delay in making this tasty soup!!

The kids don't do spicy so I omitted the chili pepper. And instead of using a blender, I just used a masher and left it lumpy. It was really good!

I rated this four star after making my changes. I thought it was kind of bland the way it's written. I added 2 tbsp of curry, more ginger, 2 tbsp garlic, 1 tsp garam masala and I'm not vegetarian so I used chicken broth but I'm sure veggie broth would be fine I just never have that in my kitchen. Over all great base recipe.

Excellent soup that even my kids would eat (which is no small feat).  For the grown-ups, I sautéed onions and kale and served it on top to add more texture.  Served with Italian chickpea flatbread and salad.  Super, easy, delicious dinner.

OUTSTANDING!  I had Dental surgery today and am restricted to a liquid diet for a few days.  I started looking for veggie based soups that could be pureed and tried this one. I have to say I wanted to eat the entire batch in one setting!  The only changes I made were to double the spices to 1 tsp each and increased the lentils to 1 cup.  I also added a tad more broth while pureeing it.  So tasty, and healthy!  Thank you Zhidaoma for sharing!

A great soup! I followed it, but left the fresh ginger at the store (duh!) so used dried, ground ginger. Didn't eat it with yogurt, either. This is so easy to make, and a stick blender whips it up in no time. I didn't eat it right away but stored it in Ball jars (this recipe makes two quarts) to serve later in the week. A perfect heat-n-eat recipe, the flavors blended beautifully and made a rich, delicious, stick-to-your-ribs lunch.

Loved the taste, texture, color of this soup. I had to switch out the chili powder and paprika for more stomach friendly herbs do to sensitive stomach and digestion. Toasted ground coriander,cardamon, and cumin seeds worked fantastic in the right amount with a pinch of cayenne pepper as a replacement. I also used coconut oil instead of butter; in addition, along with the fresh ginger I added fresh mushed turmeric root cause I am lucky enough to have it at my local co-op for more added healing power. "Thank-you" for sharing this tasty soup.

This is soooo good.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder,  I didn't have yogurt or sour cream but didn't miss it, might have been nice to have though.  I used a stick blender to roughly purée it right in the pot.  This would go very well with a hearty crusty bread and fresh butter.

Oh my goodness, I expected this to be good but I was disappointed...it was AMAZING!!!  Seriously, this is going down as one of my top soup recipes. (And I'm already considering making it again next week)  Yum! Thanks so much original poster!
Side note: I used coconut oil instead of butter and added fresh baby spinach in at the end.  Delicious!

Delish! Adults & kids liked this.  Followed the recipie, just used more sweet potato, carrots and the red lentils.  Used split red lentils - they cook faster. Oh, and low sodium chicken broth instead of veg.  Used my immersion/stick blender to blend everything together right in the pot.  Topped with some crumbled feta and/or Greek yogurt.  Easy to make and will make again! Yummy in my tummy!

I was really excited about the recipe because I wanted something really radical from our everyday meals but this one fell a little flat for us.  I tried it non-pureed first as so many people said they left it that way.  My husband and I both thought it was lacking flavor.  Neither of us finished it.  I decided to give it a second chance the next day by heating it up and pureeing it like the recipe stated.  This time it tasted much better and I think it is because you get all the flavors in every bite.  The problem then became that the texture and visual appeal was not fun.  It really did look like baby food and the kind that you feel sorry that your baby has to eat.  Don't think I would try this again but thank you for opening my eyes to new possibilities with flavor combinations.

I am not a vegetarian, but the combination of these ingredients intrigued me. I have to say it was fabulous.  Did not puree, and used chicken broth and light yogurt.

I made a couple small changes but overall I really enjoyed this soup! I subbed ground ginger (1/4 tsp) because I didn't have fresh and green lentils since I didn't have red. I also added 2 medium russet potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 can of (no-salt added) corn and 1 can of white beans (drained and rinsed). Last but not least, I'm a 'chunky soup' kinda gal, so I skipped the pureeing step all together. It was a very hearty, filling soup with great flavor. Definitely planning to make this one again!

I've done the recipe a couple of times and I really like it but I always use brown lentils because I don't know where to find red lentils. Also last time I didn't have sweet potatoes so I used half a butternut squash and it was really good.

I usually follow the exact recipe when making something for the first time AND the next time I make this soup I will do exactly the same.  This is such an easy and wonderful soup.  Maybe swap marg for the butter if you are healthy minded, but other than that.....perfection!

great recipes loved the simplicity of it too and the cumin gives it a great flavor along with the other spices,, i did tweak it a little to accomodate what i had but i give the recipes all the credit,, i didn't have sweet potatoes so used regular ones and i had only an apple so next time id use at least three because they really complement the dish,, and i had soy sauce with it to give it a great taste too rather than the yogurt that i didn't have...sooo yummm husband loved very much too thanks :)

this was very flavorful. I would increase seasonings.
however a little sweet. Maybe a tarter apple would help. All in all a very good  vegetarian dish. Left quite a bit of veg. un mashed. This was good more like a stew. Used greek yogert non fat. I could see other root vegi. Parsnip? I will make it again. More lentils. Garlic.

Love it.  Used a little butter, a little coconut oil.  Added shredded fresh spinach.  Slightly mashed it to make it a little more stew like.  Hope the family likes it because I sure do.  (update- big thumbs down from the kids but me and hubby LOVE IT!!!)

This was a refreshing change from the tried-and-true sweet potato+curry! I think next time I'll add in some apple juice/cider and another apple and up the heat.

This made A LOT and I got sick of eating it after a while.  I tasted it before I pureed it and was super excited, it seemed so yummy!  Then I pureed it and it was still good, just not as good.  I would make this again, as a winter soup, but I wouldn't puree it.  This soup is extremely hearty - a small amount will totally fill you up.

Love this recipe.  I pureed about 1/3 of the soup and added it back to the pot - made it nice and thick but still stew-like in texture.  We're a vegan household, so I skipped the yogurt garnish, and cooked up the veggies in some water instead of butter - for anyone looking to cut calories/fat, this is a great tip - you don't need to cook your veggies in butter or oil, just use enough water to keep the veggies from sticking, you'll never know the difference!

This soup was an adventure for me.  I've never really ate lentils, I am not an experienced soup maker, and I didn't even own cumin.  I was convinced I would not like it; however, I think it is delicious.  I did have to make some minor changes based on what I had on hand and could find at the store.  I used regular lentils and chicken broth.  I also cut the chili powder in half because I was concerned about it being too spicy.  Next time I make it I will go with the full amount of chili powder.

What an absolutly WONDERFUL soup.  I made some minor alterations, but the soup would be perfect as is.  We like our food with lots of flavor so I added additional ginger (jared paste-very handy),paprika and chili powder.  I blended with an imersion blender half way to puree.  I didn't have yoghart so I used about 1/2 a cup of fat free half and half.  To top it off I chopped some cilantro (always a delight). Hubby and I really, really enjoyed it and it will definatly make it again, probably when we entertain.  Thanks Zhidaoma....you tickled our taste buds.  We highly reccomend giving it a try.

This is wonderful.  The flavors are great yet very subtle.  I used butternut squash that had already been baked instead of the sweet potato.  I put it in for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Like others, I did not puree the soup.  I also used sour cream. My husband ate two bowls.

Made it exactly as written except didn't puree it.  Loved the flavors.  I think next time I will only use half the onion, add an extra apple (love that sweet potato/apple combo) and add extra ginger.  Needs a bit of additional color, so may follow another reviewer's advice and add spinach.  Didn't top it with plain yogurt, but that definitely would have been a good addition.

really good! I made a few adjustments-- 1 can of coconut milk added right before putting vegetable stock in. Let the veggies soak up the coconut milk for a few minutes and than added the stock. I also added about 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro, 1 chopped jalapeno , 2 garlic cloves, 1/3 cup toasted coconut (coconut on baking pan for 10 min in oven @ 350. check on and mix about halfway through) pureed the soup in batches. perfect! thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Mine turned out a bit salty but thankfully my husband likes it that way. I didn't have enough sweet potatoes so added butternut squash. Using the stick blender sure made everything super easy. Great recipe.

This was really, really not good. The only differences between how I made it and how it was written was I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because the store was out and I used olive oil instead of butter. I tried the soup both ways - leaving it chunky it was quite plain and pureeing it looked and tasted like hot baby food. I couldn't finish the bowl. I really am amazed at how many good reviews this has. I will let the chunky soup sit over night and try it again tomorrow, but I have low expectations.

Very good & filling!  I subbed green lentils (that's all I had) and my soup turned out fine--it still had a nice orange color.  I also subbed bouillon cubes (chicken flavor) for the broth because that's what I had as well--again, no problem!  The only thing I might change next time is using smaller sweet potatoes and adding a bit more carrot, as the sweet potato flavor dominated (I also might leave the skins on the potatoes--more nutrients that way, right?).  Overall, very tasty and easy, so I will made again. :)

So sweet and delicious!!!  I didn't puree it.  Instead I just mashed it a little with a potato masher.  Oh, and I didn't eat it with yogurt.  YUM!

Easy to make, cheap to buy the ingredients, even in here in Hawaii where the price of some foods like potatoes are much higher, and excellent tasting, this soup earned 5 stars from me.  It's also VERY filling.  Only thing I would change is the photo that goes with the recipe since it doesn't look anything like what is pictured when you're done pureeing it.

Terrific recipe!  Flavors were spot on.  I used homemade chicken stock instead of veggie and used sour cream as a garnish.  Husband liked it so much, he said I should add it into our regular rotation.
Very good!

Agree that it was delicious as a stew (not pureed)!  Also added extra fresh ginger and black pepper.

Used olive oil and made it like a stew. The sweet potatoes were so soft you could smash a few to sort of puree it. Used a pinch of ground ginger instead of fresh since I don't care for ginger. Din't use the red lentils either - used what I had on hand, which was brown. Still tasted great! Will be making this again.

Amazing. My husband was dubious because he's more of a meat & potatoes guy, but he loved it! The spices make it much more savory than we expected. He compared it to a chili flavor. Will definitely be making this again and again!

Like a few others, I was kind of on the fence about adding in apples. I am so, so glad that I stuck to the recipe (with the exception of taking the chili powder down to 1/4 tsp for my kiddos' sake)... This soup is awesome, and I will be making it again... And SOON! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is hands down, one of the best soups my family and I have ever eaten!!!!  My only deviation from the recipe was that I used dried ginger, but will try fresh next time - just out of curiosity to see if it's even possible to improve the flavor.  Will also make a double batch next time.  Excellent, awesome, easy, outstanding recipe!!

The BEST soup - beautiful color!  Can't wait to share it at work tomorrow.  I followed pretty close to the recipe but had to use what was on hand - olive oil, chicken stock, ground ginger, brown lentils, and I did add a splash of apple cider vinegar and a bit of coconut milk. Partial puree.  Divine!

Really delicious. Some minor changes: added a few cloves of garlic to the cooking vegetables, because everything is better with garlic. I had humungous sweet potatoes, so I ended up having to use more than the 4 c. broth called for, but I had extra on hand so it wasn't a big deal. For seasonings I added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to give it that winter taste, and a big splash of apple cider vinegar adds a ton of flavor. Lastly, I skipped out on pureeing it, and instead just used a potato masher to get a nice and thick, but chunky soup/stew consistency.

Great flavor: slightly sweet but hearty.  I used extra carrots (about 5) and didn't puree it.  It still looked tasty.  *Update  5/9/16*: made this again but used coconut oil instead of butter (because it's better for you and onions don't stink up the house when you cook them in it). This would make it vegan, I believe, if you don't top it with yogurt or sour cream.  I also doubled all the spices and added an extra 1/4 c of lentils.  Turned out very tasty still.  To keep the prep time down and nutritional content up, I only peeled the sweet potatoes and again didn't blend it at the end.  If I were to blend it, though, I'd do it in the pot with an immersion blender after letting it cool for a little while.

Where is the 10 star button!? This is fabulous and I'm sharing it with everyone. I honestly didn't change it too much, but I DID read the reviews first and decided to use olive oil instead of the butter because I eat vegan as much as I can. This soup is GREAT either pureed or kept as a hearty, chunky soup. I actually prefer it as a chunky soup and not pureed just because I really love the textures. I used two HUGE sweet potatoes, more carrot than called for, 2 apples and 1 whole cup of the lentils. Simply because I know how I like my soups and that is hearty and chunky and full of vegetables and lentils. I can't rave about it enough!

We made this soup for lunch today.  It was quick and inexpensive to make.  My husband and I really like this soup.  It went well with the broiled tomato sandwiches (also from this website).  My 7-year old lived it too.

holy. cow. I made this in preparation for when I had my tonsils out. I honestly had no appetite for anything... except this soup! It is easily one of my favorite soups. Next time I will try pureeing only half of it to give it some texture. It sounds like a strange combination but it is heaven!

Excellent!  I did not puree and used a pinch of cayenne pepper for some zest.

My husband and I LOVED this soup!  I took a risk by making this soup, as my husband is not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but he asked for another serving!  I added 1/2 a cup of lentils, like the recipe calls for, but was wishing I had added 1 cup.  I did not have any fresh ginger, so I used 1/2 tsp of ginger powder.  Also, I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth.  Like other reviewers, I did not puree it.  The soup is even better the next day!

Delicious and healthy.  I made as instructed except used 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter and twice the minced ginger.  I mashed the soup instead of pureeing it (make sure the ginger is minced small if doing this)I cooked it a day in advanced and warmed it.  It was thick so I added some lowfat milk.  It made a big batch and was surprisingly delicious.  Perfect with a salad and garlic bread for a cool fall day dinner.  Yuum-thanks!

Oh, my goodness.  Despite my original skepticism about the ingredients, I read the rave reviews and tried this recipe. I cook every day and try new recipes nearly that often, and I have to say that this is the BEST new soup recipe I've tried in years.  The first time I made exactly as suggested because I believe that every recipe deserves that respect :=) It was absolutely wonderful.  The second time I made this soup I tweaked as follows: First, I used chipotle chili powder instead of regular, and at the end, I added about 3/4 cup of lowfat half and half. Adding the cream made the recipe a little different but perhaps even more delicious.  Don't let the unique blend of ingredients and all of the necessary chopping deter you from making this soup.  I think you will love it!

Excellent soup. I was a bit leery about the combination of vegetables, but I made this for a crowd of nearly 30 and they all loved it. I used olive oil instead of butter, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and added a few cloves of garlic.

I made this according to the recipe with the exception of using powdered ginger instead of fresh.  I really liked it.  My children didn't care for it, but that was ok - that meant more for me!  It made more than the six servings listed in the recipe. The cumin and ginger give it an interesting flavour.  I will be making this again.

wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe but it turned out really good. the Chili powder stood out for me giving it a southwest flavor.  I didn't mind it but I might cut back on it next time so some of the other flavors can shine through.  Hubby said it was excellent.

Followed the recipe nearly to a T with the one exception that I had green lentils on hand instead of red. Very very impressed with this soup. The flavor is just amazing. Not normally a fan of cumin but it is perfect in this dish. I might try adding just a squeeze of lemon to it to brighten it up a bit next time.

WOW! I am a seriously novice cook, and this turned out absolutely delicious, even for me! Like some others, I subbed olive oil for butter (to make it vegan), and am thrilled to have found such a ridiculously healthy and tasty meal. Thanks!!

Great soup! Our toddler slurped it up and asked for more. If making for young ones you could make this less spicy, but we loved this recipe as-is. Don't even think of omitting the plain yogurt! Yum.

I made this without the chili powder or red lentils just because I had neither. I added curry. If I were to make it again I would add another apple and cut the salt if I were using regular-sodium broth. Very warming and tasty soup!

Excellent! Reduced the cumin, chili powder and paprika to 1/2 teaspoon each. Used chicken broth (water + chicken bouillon cubes) and had to add two more cups at the end.

This soup is fantastic - both my husband and I love it.  It's so creamy and delicous it tastes like it's bad for you but it's not at all.  It's also very easy to make.  My alterations - only use 2 Tbl of butter; substitute 5 cups of chicken broth for the 4 cups of water (then omit the salt); a few dashes of ginger powder instead of fresh ginger.  A winner!!!

A delicious and economical alternative to butternut squash soup!  Followed the recipe as written and it was perfect.  (No need to swap oil for butter... butter is better!!)

This soup is delicious and incredibly hearty. I don't puree it (because it's less messy), and I add one extra apple and some chopped celery. Definitely one of my favorite recipes!

Wow this is a great soup.  I have made this recipe for 40 university students, and 60 habitat for humanity volunteer construction workers with rave reviews.   While the peeling and chopping does take some time - it is well worth it.  Great vegan recipe as well - just use margarine or vegetable oil instead of butter and leave off the yogurt garnish.

This soup is so hearty and delicious. All my family members detest vegetables however, the loved this recipe! It has this sweetness about it too which makes it easy to skip dessert. Will definitely bookmark this one!

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have fresh ginger on hand, so I had to use ground, but I'll be sure to use fresh next time.  Will definitely make again.  (My 3-yr-old ate 2 bowls of it.)

Fantastic! Note: I used two large sweet potatoes and it made enough soup for 10 people.

Healthy and hearty soup using olive oil instead of butter.  I definitely enjoyed it; tad sweet though.  Splashed some tobasco sauce to balance out the sweetness.

Good.  Made as written.  Flavors seemed to setup after overnight refrigeration.  Needed some salt and onion powder.  Kids liked it OK as well.  To make it 5 stars, add much more fresh shredded ginger and Sriracha sauce.

Incredible soup. Didn't have ginger, but I used a dash or two of pumpkin pie seasoning which was nice. Don't use Feta, it's not necessary. Maybe yogurt, but it tastes delicious without anything else. Also, it might be nice with some cranberries next time.

I first made this about 4 months ago--it has grace our table MANY times since then.  Delicious.  It is great as a puree with rice, or as a stew.  I prefer it as a stew with some yogurt added, my husband likes the stew and rice.  Either way, this is a soup lovers soup.  Hearty, warm, colorful, guilt free and full of flavor.  Thanks!

This was very good! And it's so healthy, and the addition of lentils makes it a bit more filling too. I found it a tad bland the first day but the second day after the flavours had developed it was delicious. I think I will add more chili powder next time.

I've made this twice and given the recipe away twice. It is really tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I added an extra apple, just because and I used smoked paprika because that was one hand.

Absolutely amazing. I didn't puree it and it tasted just fine as a stew. I stirred in the yogurt at the table though and it made the broth very creamy and wonderful.   My husband HATES sweet potatoes, but he had seconds and asked me to make it again.

If there were more stars, I'd add them.  This is amazing.  Didn't have sweet potatoes, so used butternut squash instead.  Also used olive oil instead of butter.  Culinary heaven.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Amazing soup.  Just enough "bite" to keep it interesting.  Definitely a keeper!  It has the most amazing flavour!  Only change I made was use chicken stock instead of vegetable and threw in some celery leaves.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I found it to be very tasty but too sweet.  If I made it again, I might omit the apple, or replace one of the sweet potatoes with a regular potato.

I kicked up all the seasonings by 1/2, added a dash of cayenne and an extra apple, and this was an awesome recipe.  A perfect fall soup, which I've made twice since finding it a month ago.

I looove this soup! It was delicous although not enough to serve 6 for sure! The only changes I made were adding water (4 Cups) and some bouillon (only enough for 1.5 Cups not 4)instead of veg broth and omitted the salt as a result, I used ground ginger instead of the real thing and ended up adding milk to the soup at the very end before serving. I simmered my soup too long so the milk help 'thin' it out as well as cool it down a bit! You won't believe how delicious this was, I was definitely surprised. It's also extremely easy and quick to make!

This soup is delicious!  Husband who doesn't like carrots or sweet potatoes really enjoyed this recipe.  I added a bit more seasoning at the end (not much) and used a little more apple, but followed the recipe as stated.  It is very easy to make - just cut up vegetables & apples and boil until mushy.  A hand blender makes it even easier.  I added a good amount of water when blending to thin it out a bit... but the soup remained flavorful.  This makes a wonderful fall or winter meal.

Excellent soup and so healthy! I followed some reviewers comments and did not process this. It's less work and becomes more of a stew. It thickens a bit on it's own with the lentils as well as the vegs breaking down. Other suggestions that I followed were replacing the butter with coconut oil and adding chopped spinach 4 min before it was done. Both worked very well. I didn't have veg broth on hand, so I went with chicken broth and also used smoked paprika and powdered ginger. As the submitter mentioned, it's a  cold weather soup/stew. It's also definitely a nice change from the usual creamed pumpkin or butternut squash soups at this time of the year. I'll definitely make this one again! Thanks for the recipe!

My FAVORITE go to since I am a terrible cook! 

My aunt made this wonderful soup one cold Wisconsin holiday for us (along with another few soups) - I fell in love, head over heels, and have been making GALLONS of this stuff for two years now! 

I can honestly say I have never really followed the the recipe to a t because I like it spicy, nothing I cook turns out the same every time I make it (curse or blessing - I am not too sure), and I don't listen, which isn't helpful here but this is bork prooooof!

I add meat, tofu, yogurt, and all types of goofy things - it's always a pleasure and comfort to warm up a bowl after a cold day!

This is a GREAT recipe! I pureed only 4 cups of the soup separately with a stick blender, and left the rest chunky, having some of the creaminess of the puree, and the substance of the chunks. Want to try it as a totally pureed COLD soup, with a dollop of sour cream. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil. This is a wonderful recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

By far my favorite soup! 

After making this many times, I now add different veggies depending on what's available. As long as the spices and sweet vegetables prevail, it's a very versatile dish that can accommodate many additions (corn, spinach, celery, tomato, garlic, bell pepper, mushrooms, quinoa, chia seeds--you name it!).

Amazing!  I was skeptical, but with so many rave reviews, I had to try it.  This is a keeper.  We served with sour cream (out of yogurt) and it was "lick your bowl" good.  I did use red onions instead of white/yellow because it is what I had on hand and green lentils instead of red for the same reason.  I also did not puree it as I don't care for that texture.

The only thing I did differently was use purple sweet potatoes instead of orange and it was so pretty and delicious!! Very well rounded flavors!

I already had some baked sweet potatoes. So I roasted some carrots and onions till they were soft and over cooked some lentils till they were creamy. Then I threw everything (baked sweet potatoes, carrots, onions, lentils, veggie broth, ginger and spices) right into the blender until it was smooth. I also included some applesauce...and walah...another variation of this recipe without the oil and butter!

Made the recipe just as described (minus adding the yogurt as garnish). Found it very delicious! I didn't taste the apple as much as I wanted to and I wish the recipe gave a suggestion of the best type of apple to use. I'll continue experimenting with different apples, and will definitely be making this soup a lot.

What a refreshing flavour!  But then when we added a dollop of sour cream as we didn't have plain yogurt, the combination was spectacular! I was making a doubled version in my crockpot to freeze in tubs for later, but after I tasted it, we added it as an entree to dinner. My husband who isn't very expressive was raving about it. The only missing ingredient was paprika which wasn't missed. Thank you for sharing a sure fire crowd pleaser.

What a beautifully simple recipe. The balance of salty, sweet & spice is perfect. For lower fat I reduced the the butter to 1 tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Next time I'll add a full cup of lentils because I love them. Used my immersion blender for a nice velvety texture. I'm adding this healthy soup to my weekly menu. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic recipe. My husband ate it tonight and  said it was the best thing I've made in a long time. Yay! I made a couple minor additions/changes only to suit our taste; the recipe as written would have been great. We used coconut oil instead of butter, increased ginger to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp of crushed red chill flakes and increased the lentils to 3/4 cup to make it more stew like. Like the other reviewers, we did not puree it and served it over wild rice. Thanks for the recipe! Yum Yum!

Didn't have paprika.  Added garlic with veg.  Added enough milk to thin it out after I pureed it.  Delish.  Serve with salad & bread.

This was a super yummy soup. I am very glad I made it. I altered it a tad based off of the ingredients I had at home. I used purple sweet potatoes and green lentils. It was divine! I will make this recipe again and again!

Very flavorful! Did not have red lentils so I used green ones so the color probably wasn't as appetizing as it could've been. Like many other reviewers I also left it chunky.

Used red potatoes, coconut butter. Pretty good - could use a bit more spice. Blend with kale and spinach at end.

I made it in the crockpot, but can't see the flavors changing much using it. Rather sweet potato & carrot soup than lentil- though I should have known with only a half cup of lentils needed. Just not for me, even after waiting for the flavors to develop the next day.

Good soup, but meh.  Would've liked to see spices that complemented the apple in it.  I also had to add lemon juice to brighten the flavour. It was pretty flat otherwise.  Probably wouldn't make again, but I had all the ingredients on hand so it worked.

Delish!!! Was sweet and spicy excellence. As others suggested, I didnt blend- mostly out of laziness and also because I wanted some texture. Used coconut oil instead of butter and was out of cumin so increased chili powder and added some coriander seed instead. Also threw in some chili flakes because this house likes things spicy. Finally, because I want to empty the bag, I doubled the amount of lentils. I sort of think this recipe is foolproof. Either way, it was filling and tasty! Might forget about making dinner just so I can have this again.

This is my new favourite soup. So tasty and filling. I was making it for the first time so I didn't change anything except I left the skins on since it was being pureed anyway and also left out the salt because I pretty much always leave out the salt. It was fantastic as is and I will definitely be making this again. Probably many times.

Everything was amazing, and delicious until I added the cumin. It overwhelmed my soup, and I ended up throwing out the whole batch. I will make again sans cumin.

"Hey, give this a taste."
"Why did you make a whole pot of baby food?"
"Yeah..."
"Did you try adding the yogurt?"
"Yup"
"What about Sriracha sauce?"
"...Now it tastes like baby food with Sriracha sauce."
"Well then... know any hungry babies around here?"

This recipe really needs something to give it some kick. Way too bland and boring. Points for being cheap and easy to make.

Absolute favorite soup!  Kids like it it, and my husband and I both love this.  I stick to the recipe usually except I add a heaping 1/2 tsp of garam masala and use homemade chicken stock instead of veggie broth.  My husband likes it spicy, so he adds a generous helping of cayenne pepper (and/or curry paste) to add some extra heat to his.  This is a delicious and flexible recipe - a little more or less of something still works fine, as do regular brown lentils and ground ginger.  Have some extra red pepper - throw it in etc.

I loved this! Next time I make it, I'll have everything all chopped up (that took the longest time). I added about 1/2 c. water at the end. The flavor was perfect. And I added a dollop of non-fat plain greek yogurt too.

Do yourself a favor, and MAKE THIS SOUP!  I prepared this soup for our annual holiday progressive dinner.  Since I usually provide  the "soup" portion of the dinner, I wanted to try something a little unique.  I was very worried this recipe would be a little odd to most people (and my husband thought I was crazy for trying it on a group of 15 adults), but everyone loved it! I followed the advice of the other reviewers and did not puree the soup.  However, since I made the soup the night before the event, the soup kind of pureed itself a bit after sitting for 24 hours.  Like the others, I did not find red lentils, so I just used what was available.  When I make this again, I will add more lentils - they are so good!  I doubled the recipe and was so glad I did - - I had yummy leftovers for 2 days.  MY REVISIONS: I sprinkled a bit of pumpkin pie spice on my bowl of soup, which was very yummy!  Also - sorry vegetarians, but I added a pound of crumbled sage sausage to give the soup a little more oomph.  A great addition!

Four stars because I want to save 5 for the most amazing recipes.

Very very easy to do and a great combination of flavors - very well balanced.  What is amazing is how healthy it is and how easy it is to make.

I estimated out the calories and using 6 servings, it is only 300 calories per bowl.

this was great! i didnt puree the soup and added more lentils so it was more stew-like, also included kale and a pinch of coriander and ground ginger.

My family LOVES this dish! We have made it twice so far. It's delicious and healthy and my toddler eats it up. I like to add a can of pumpkin and I usually use a LOT more spices and a bit less salt than the original recipe calls for. Cumin, paprika, and chili powder are all good for you, so why not? I do it by taste but I would estimate that I tripled all three. We puree half of it to meld the flavors, but we prefer it more stew-like as well. We add Fage 0% Greek yogurt at the end. This is probably our favorite Autumn dish.

This soup is very good. I increase the amount of lentils and do not blend the soup.  I also use olive oil instead of butter.

Loved it!  A few substitutes due to what I had on hand and to make it vegan, green lentils for red, ginger powder for fresh, olive oil for butter, and it turned out delicious!!!  I did puree it.  Hearty, yummy, and easy! :)

Delicious and healthy, even my 8 month old loves this! Only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of vegetable. The plain yogurt when serving really makes it! Thanks for a great recipe.

The flavor of this soup was excellent...but the consistency turned out something like baby food and the family didn't care for that.  I'm going to make it again and maybe only puree about 1/3 of it and leave the rest as is.  Good soup though.

I love this soup!  I made it for my mom when she had dental work done and couldn't chew.  I wanted to make a hearty soup that wasn't creamy (she doesn't like anything creamy).  I made it again a few days later for myself.  I only blended half of the soup to make it thicken it, but still wanted some of the veggies.

I LOVE THIS SOUP!  Every time I make it I am surprised again at how fantastic it is.  Ginger is really great in it, but if you don't have ginger the soup is still amazing.  I only blend half of the soup, because I like chunks of veggies.  And it's so pretty before blending.   I also use more stock and cook longer (without changing the other ingredients) to get the lentils really soft.  But all in all, I LOVE THIS SOUP!  Thanks.

Followed this recipe exactly.  Was WONDERFUL!  Even my children love it.  They used it for their cooking project at school.  Everyone I make it for raves.  A definite keeper.  If you make a double batch, the leftovers warm up nicely.

I found this to be the consistency of baby food and a very strange combination of flavors.  I think red lentils tend to "mush" more than green or brown.  Will not make again.

Used just as much olive oil as needed to sauté veggie n apple mixture.  Added all spices at beginning while sautéing to really get flavors worked through.  Easy and quick to make.  Family loved it!  Oh, and used ground ginger instead of fresh...and don't bother peeling apples or potatoes, just cut into bite sized chunks and skip the pureeing too!

It's delicious soup and I'll definitely make it again but it needs WAY more liquid than it calls for. I had to add 3+ cups of water to get it the consistency I wanted. Otherwise... Amazing flavours!!

This is very different but good.  My sister-in-law made it for my family and at first I didn't think the kids would eat it but they did.  I am sure it is one of the healthier soup options out there.  We used Granny Smith apples and ginger in the refrigerated tube.  This froze pretty good too.  I will say I did start to feel like I was eating baby food after a while due to the texture.

Easy to make, extremely healthy and has great taste! I make mine in the crock pot and omit the oil and salt. It freezes well, too. I probably add a bit more ginger than the recipe calls for, but that's just my taste. Excellent with a bit of sour cream on top!

Loved it! I did purée it although it is a fabulous recipe either way. And versatile. If I ever feel like stew instead I can change it up. Loved the seasonings... Kept it mostly as is. Used a half onion and olive oil instead of butter.It was sweet enough for me without adding another apple as some suggested but also spicy. I did add a bite more chili and black pepper to increase this lovely contrast and I mixed in just a couple of tablespoons of sour cream although it probably wasn't necessary. Thanks for the great recipe!

The recipe was delicious. The spices were spot on and when served with yogurt it's just fabulous.  It's a little tedious to chop up all the vegetables, but the end result is well worth it.

Absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy to throw together. The flavors are complex but still subtle... sweet but slightly smokey, hearty, and just scrumptious on a cold day. I like to puree half the soup... nothing beats the gorgeous orangey gold hue and creamy consistency when it's pureed, but this way I still get some texture. 

The past few times I've made this I have bumped up the seasonings a bit, particularly the salt, pepper, chili powder and paprika, but that's purely based on personal preference. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to a T and it was a huge hit. And so so so good for you.

This is a very unique and unusual recipe. The main reason I chose it was the ingredients ~ a very healthy soup. It is rather thick, but the taste is good. I will probably make it again.

This was absolutely fantastic.  I omitted the cumin (didn't have any), substituted olive oil for butter, and added about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne.  I crumbled some goat cheese in mine--absolutely fantastic!

I did puree it down and added about an additional 1-1.5 cups of water, as I personally hate stews.

When I first found this recipe I made it every week for about 3 months straight.  It is SO good just the way it is.  My word of caution is to always measure out the ginger, because if you add too much, like I did last time it ruins it.  This soup changes flavor every day it sits.  The first day it gets sweeter, then it will get more tangy as the days go by.  I think it's best at 24 hours.

Great soup, especially for a cold winter day. 
I added a minced clove of garlic and about 3/8 tsp of turmeric.

Great winter soup; cheap and easy, nice to have on hand all week. I added a jalepeno, much more spices and a few more, and pureed it.

DELICIOUS.  I cut back on the spices slightly due to my family's preference, used brown lentils, and powdered ginger (due to what I had on hand.)  We served it over brown rice.  Even my sweet-potato-hating-hubby liked it!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!! I took the other reviewer's suggestions and substituted Olive Oil for the butter, and did not puree the soup. I served it with quinoa and a little bit of yogurt and it was delicious. You can probably serve it with any type of grain, next time I will use rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was amazingly delicious. I did take another reviewers suggestion and added spinach and a little coconut oil along with chicken stock. I was more than pleasantly surprised by the flavors in this dish. What a healthy meal. Wonderful...Thank you so much.

Delicious and fairly easy to make.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  The yogurt on top was a nice touch, complemented the spices well.

This was a fantastic soup - and because I used such huge sweet potatoes it really made a lot of soup!  I have been looking for a recipe with lentils and this literally hit the spot!  Thank you!

Excellent. Wonderful flavors. The only thing I would change would be to leave it chunky instead of blending. I loved it blended, but my husband would prefer the texture without blending.

Holy moly.   I'm a meat eater all the way - one who's trying to cut down on my intake of red meat and try the veggie world out.  This is amazing.  Followed the recipe to the "t" - wouldn't change anything.  Unreal meal!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger instead of the fresh ginger and I only pureed about 2 cups and it was still quite thick. One of the best soups I've ever made!

Love this soup. I used canned pink eyes instead of lentils. I also added a pound of polish sausage cut up small. One of the best soups ever. Flavor was fantastic. Sprinkled feta cheese on top too!

I liked this soup, but I didn't quite love it-- perhaps because of my own errors. I forgot cumin but went ahead with the recipe, and the resulting soup was quite sweet. I tried to make it a bit more savory by adding Italian seasonings and a bay leaf. These helped tremendously. I also substituted salt-free chicken stock for veggie stock due to some personal dietary restrictions. Although the result was still a bit sweet for my fiancee and I, the soup was still delicious and hearty. I would strongly agree with other reviewers who advise NOT to skimp on the yogurt or feta.

Simply awesome. This soup is super easy to make, but tastes like you spent hours on it. Perfect for those chilly autum and winter nights. This has been a real crowd pleaser, and now has a place at our Thanksgiving day table.

Excellent whether you puree it or serve it like a stew.  My friend suggested doubling the spice.  I like it either way. Definitely surve it with the feta or yogurt garnish.

I have the soup cooking on the stove right now, and it smells wonderful!  The only thing I changed was that I only had 2 carrots so I added some chopped celery.  Also added an extra 1/4 cup lentils.  I'm not used to cooking with lentils, but 1/2 cup seemed like such a small amount.  Hopefully it won't be too lentil-y  =)

I had to substitute many of the ingredients, and yet it turned out so delicious, I'd like share with others, similarly bereft of the "right stuff" what worked for my family. For the apple, I subbed a green pre-ripe pear; for the chili powder, mere cayenne pepper; for cumin there's really no sub, so doubled the ginger, for which I subbed dried for fresh; too lazy to make stock, so simply subbed plain old fresh tap water; and lastly, though we did have  yogurt, after trying some as garnish, we all  scraped it off.  The soup was so good without it, we agreed no need to   "paint the lily".

I am completely obsessed with this soup. I cut the fat completely by cooking the veggies in a little veggie broth before adding everything else. Worked like a charm, and it was ABSOLUTELY delcious. A hearty, healthy soup that I want to eat everyday!!

So delicious! My husband doesn't normally like soup and he scraped his bowl! I made a few changes... I cooked the onions and added fresh minced garlic with coconut oil, then added a little coconut milk when I added all the veggies and apples. I used chicken broth and red beans instead of lentils because thats what I had. I left all the skin on the veggies and apple. It turned out great. I will be making this again when my family comes next week. I think I'll get some red lentils before then. Thanks for the yummy recipe!!

A little bland despite all the seasonings added (even extra salt).  I'd recommend adding garlic.  Feta is really awesome on top.

Used twice as many lentils as the recipe called for (wanted the extra protein/fiber) - and it was still pretty fantastic.  When I make this next time I think I might use an extra apple tho.  =)

This is one of the best soups I have ever made.  The ingredients sound odd at first, but the flavors blend wonderfully. It was perfect on a cold fall evening.

Delicious! I followed another reviewer's advice and did not puree, but served as a stew over brown rice. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this. The first time I made it I used green lentils and felt like the color was still appetizing. The next time I used red lentils, and it didn't seem as hearty, even though I used more, so next time I will definitely use green again.  I also doubled the ginger, because I like it hot!

The sweetness of the apple pushed it over the top -- fantastic! The only changes I made were using green lentils instead of red (can be hard to find), and using half butter/half olive oil. I agree with treating it as a stew rather than pureeing it. Try using plain Greek-style yogurt as a topping, nowhere near as runny when it was put on the hot stew/soup.

This soup was great! I did make a few changes. I used chicken broth,and I added some dices chicken and apple sausage after I had blended it a bit. The flavor of the sausage complimented it nicely, and I knew my husband would like it better with some type of meat in it. I used an immersion blender, but left it a little chunky. Next time, I will add more lentils, but I thought it was excellent! Great fall flavors!

This is amazingly good soup. The only changes I made were to use chicken broth and add a generous sprinkle of cayenne pepper to make it nice and spicy.

Cooked this recipe twice, the first time without ginger (didn't have). It was awesome! The second time I prepared with out carrots (didn't have). Then I added 1 cup of coconut milk, which made it lil' too sweet for my taste buds. I did not puree as i like chunky. I will keep using this recipe.  Great flavor!

So amazing. It was really good even without any topping - loved this unique spicy sweet taste. I blended the cooked soup in a food processor but still had some lumps, especially with the lentils. I liked that texture mixed in the creaminess, so even better!

It was great! I added a couple unpeeled potatoes as well and just used water and some seasoning salt instead of broth.  I added 1.5 as much spice as prescribed. Super flavourful.  Next time I'll double the lentils for more protein.

The tangy spicy really sets this apart.  I went a bit heavier on the lentils.  Warm, savory, thick soup.  We both loved it.

DELICIOUS! My meat eater husband also raved about it and my 2 picky eaters loved it and loved helping prepare it :). I chopped up the onion, apples & carrot in a food processor before adding to pot, and mashed the potatoes at the end with a potato masher. Served with yogurt and bread.

My husband made this last night- it was excellent! The only thing he changed was to skip the pureeing. The mix of spices make the soup. As do the apples... well, and sweet potatoes, and the lentils... it was great.

This soup is addicting!  I crave it every few months and have probably made it 5 or 6 times now.  I have used chicken or vegetable broth and it turns out the same.  Instead of pureeing it I mash it with a potato masher and I love the still slightly chunky texture.  Sour cream is a wonderful garnish.  Delicious!

Wow - this was a really wonderful surprise.  I wasn't sure how the flavor would turn out with this mixture of ingredients, but the flavor was fantastic.  The only change I made was olive oil instead of butter.  Definitely will make again.

This is an amazing soup!!!! I love it! My husband and I couldn't stop eating it even when we were so full...and the kids both loved it! My 2 year old drank it from her bowl! The only modifications I made were halving the spices (not the salt) to cut down on the heat and it was perfect...I will make this over and over again! Thanks! :)

Dont understand the reviews because we were not fans of this although we like all the ingredients used. Just kinda odd I thought. Won't be making again.

I just tried this recipe and love it!  I added a little ground celery seed, and more lentils.  It's very fragrant while cooking and is a nice blend of sweet and savory.  I also didn't puree the soup since I wanted it to be more like a stew.  Excellent recipe!  I'll definitely make this again.

First had this at a school fundraiser and loved it!  Made for a skeptical mom & fiance who groans every time soup is mentioned.  Both found it as agreeable as I had.  So easy, especially with hand blender...might substitute half of butter with olive oil next time.

Oh yum! A new FAVORITE for sure!  I put unripened goat cheese on as the topping, as I had no sour cream, and it melted so delicately and made it taste just so much more amazing in my opinion!

This soup was amazing and so easy to make with an immersion blender! Don't adjust anything- the spices are perfect as they are. I left off the yogurt to save calories- it's great as is.

I made this mostly because 1) it's in the top 20 soups here and 2) it seemed nutritionally better than most of the winter soups I make (i.e., no heavy cream).  The unexpected bonus was that it was delicious -- will definitely make this again.

Great soup and very flexible. Threw in extra apples, a pear and butternut squash because I had them around. Served over brown rice with Greek yogurt and Asian chili-garlic sauce on the side. One ofbthe best soups ever....make sure to double the recipe, btw. You will be glad you did.

Thank you for sharing.  This soup has become my new staple and I make 2 batches as it freezes well.  

The spice is great per the recipe.  I like to add Cayenne, a bit of sugar to bring out the flavors, and a little nutmeg.  I add a little swirl of cream in it when serving.

Really great and hardy.  My 2 and 4 year old even loved it.  I like it better before the puree process personally.  My boys liked it better pureed!  Both ways are great!

This was good but a bit bland for our taste. I added garlic powder and more chili powder and a touch of cayenne. I think it could have used more on top of what I already added! It was healthy for sure, especially if you leave out the butter and use olive oil instead. I will keep it on file.

SOOOO GOOD! Like some others I didn't puree this.  However, I did take my potato masher and sloshed it through a few times to thicken up the broth.  Delicious served over rice! I didn't have yogurt on hand, but tastes fine without it.  I bet a dollop of sour cream would taste as good.  Thanks for this keeper!

Excellent, nutritious soup! I like chunkier soups so I only pureed about half pf the soup so it was creamy but still had some chunks of veggies in it. I thought I would need to add more spices but decided to try it as it was and it turned out to be the perfect amount of spice. Very healthy and yummy!

Great recipe! Only changes I made were to use about 2tbsp olive oil instead of butter and didn't puree it.  Nice and sweet - lovely recipe! and a nice change from the classic lentil soup, which I also love

Absolutely delicious!!!!!! If ever there was a perfect Fall soup, this is it. I love the blend of flavors. I made it exactly as described, stuck to the exact amount of spices, and it was amazing. The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 cup of whipping cream to the soup at the end, instead of the yogurt. Yes, the yogurt probably would have been a little healthier, and I am sure it would be delicious, but I loved the creaminess that the whipping cream added. I will definitely be making this again and again!!! Next time, I will make a double batch, and stick a bunch in the freezer, as all the ingredients will freeze perfectly. Thanks for one of my new favorite recipes!!

Wow, color me surprised! This is actually really good! After eating waffle sandwiches, cheese fondue, and pizza this weekend, my boyfriend declared that we needed to eat healthy. After a quick search, I found this recipe and I'm just amazed. I tend to be wary of recipes with this type of ingredient list but I'm glad I tried it. I kept everything the same, except I subbed a tiny bit of olive oil for the butter. Perfect!

This soup was so simple and delicious! The only change I made, was to use olive oil in place of the butter. It has a little kick, which I loved but if you don't, just reduce the black pepper and chili powder. Yummy and healthy!

I found it to be too sweet and not enough flavor. I added 1/2 teaspoon tumeric, a few extra dashes of everything else, some garlic, a dribble of balsamic vinegar, and two cut up stalks of celery.  I did put it in the blender for just a few seconds per batch and poured it over brown rice. Feta cheese was delicious in it.  Over all good dish, just felt it needed more of a kick.

I LOVE soup and wanted to use up my sweet potatoes and stew beef in the fridge. I made this per the recipe, except that I had a humongous sweet potato, so it was probably more like 3 in there. I used a stick blender, then added 2 lbs. of browned stew chunks, and another peeled, chunked apple. That all simmered for no more than 15 mins as my bread finished. I wish I had added two apples, as those bites of semisoft sweetness with the beef chunks were so delicious in the soup! This would also be good with any type of squash in there.   I didn't see a need to brown the veggies ahead of time, and would probably only saute the onions in the future.

DELICIOUS! I only had green lentils and they worked out just fine.  I only pureed about 1/4 of the soup and then mixed it back in.  Great texture and flavor.

This soup is so good! I am a semi-vegetarian college student and loved how this recipe includes lentils. I followed the recipe to a T, although next time I might use oil instead of butter. I definitely suggest not skipping the pureeing steps because it makes the soup feel a lot heartier. Mine definitely had some kick to it, so adjust spices to your taste. I can't wait to freeze a batch!

I have made this recipe twice thus far. Very DELICIOUS--and FORGIVING--recipe!  Changes I've made: Olive oil instead of butter (healthier) Extra apple Lentils &/or split peas (depending upon what I had) Omitted ginger (none on hand, & not a big fan of it) Omitted salt (doesn't need it with the broth base) Chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (that's what I had) Second time added some left over roasted garlic (blended in with the broth)  Sour cream mixed in at the end, instead of yogurt Only partially pureed the soup (left some chunks)  We are addicted to this soup! Creamy, flavorful goodness with a little sweetness and slight "kick." This will be a "regular" in our home! Thanks for sharing it!

This is SO delicious!  I made a few of minor changes.  I used 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 Tbsp. olive oil.  I used regular lentils since I didn't have red and powdered ginger instead of fresh.  I halved the pepper and really would be fine with omitting it.  I used Greek yogurt to top the soup (tastes like sour cream to me).  This is a hearty, filling, delicious soup!  The leftovers are just as good as the first serving.

Very tasty, even without the yogurt.  I didn't have any chili powder, so I doubled the paprika. I also used an immersion blender to puree it, which gave the soup a wonderful texture, and was very easy.

I love thick soups and hate chunks, so this is the soup for me.  The flavour is wonderful and it's great with either the yogurt or the feta on top, though I prefer feta.  Great with home made bread as a side.  It's also so filling that you don't need meat.

This is an excellent, easy to prepare recipe.  I actually had everything in my kitchen and had fresh soup ready for my hockey players in 45 minutes.  Even my picky 8-year old ate it without complaint!  That's saying something!

I made a three serving portion of this recipe and think it is fantastic.  I enjoy thick creamy soups and appreciate it's healthy ingredients.  The only two modifications I made was to omit the salt because I used two vegetable boullian cubes to create the vegetable broth, and I used some variety of brown lentils.  A very inexpensive and tasty dish.

Made ALMOST as directed. My partner and I made this together and had so much fun. I highly recommend this as a couples activity! As it turned out we only had a half of an onion, and although absolutely delicious we will use a whole sweet onion next time. I think a Vidalia onion would taste best. We used fresh garlic and fresh ginger. The fresh ingredients are key, however we both agreed that next time we will double the amount of herbs and spices. I suggest making it as directed, so that you can customize to your taste as some reviews report too much spice. AMAZING color, texture, nutrients, and taste. We used sour cream instead of yogurt. Yogurt, sour cream, or a creamy vegan alternative is recommended but not necessary. So good puréed! Not at all like a baby food. Elegant, gourmet, and heartier than expected. This can be served as a side dish, appetizer, or main course. As for servings: You know when you go to a restaurant and they ask if you would like a cup or a bowl of soup? This makes six bowls. I hope that helps. This is a dish that will impress in both fun and yum!

I mistakenly put in a full cup of lentils, but other than that.  I followed the recipe.  It's really yummy - very thick and filling.  There's a bit of a kick in the spices which I really liked.  It's a great meal for a cold winter evening.

I had just been to Whole Foods and had their Pumpkin Curry Soup.  It was scrumptious!  I found this recipe while looking to use my sweet potatoes.  I only had one and I had an acorn squash so I used that as my second sweet potato.  Instead of  ground cumin, chili powder, and paprika I used curry.  It turned out very good and I will make it again.  Very close to WF's pumpkin soup.

So YUMMY! A little bit SWEET with a RICH flavor. I used green lentils x 1 cup and added a cup of water and did NOT puree just for simplicity sake and it was perfect with plain Greek yogurt on top. The veggie chopping was a little time consuming but otherwise super SIMPLE!

This  soup was a success. Made it for company and they were asking for seconds.  I oven roasted the potatoes and carrots thought it might give it extra  flavour.  Next time I’ll do it according to the recipe and see if there is a big difference in taste. 
Used  canned lentils.  Topped it with a dollop of sour cream.  It was awesome.

It was very good. I loved how how healthy it was and it just made you feel like it was comfort food. And it was light even though it felt rich at the same time and you could make it as spicy or not as you want.   Yes I would love to make it again.

This is a 5+ recipe!  I followed the suggestions and made it as a stew adding spinach at the end.  I used green lentils but plan on making this again with red lentils.  My husband & I will be making this all year long.  Thank you for a fantastic stew/soup!

Delicious soup and my toddler loves it! I used my InstantPot to sauté the veggies and apple then used the soup function to cook it before blending and simmering. Definitely worth the time and effort!

I took a tip from WIKKED WERTZ and put everything in the crockpot except for the butter and it was great, easy and Weight Watcher friendly.  I used applesauce instead of apples because it was faster.

Really good! Sweet from the sweet potatoes and the apple and great savory flavors from the spices. I didn’t have cumin so I substituted a little curry. I added the spinach as someone suggested and a little rice. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious. I love it just as written but the second time I made it I cut the chili powder in half to placate the spice averse in my crowd.

1 cup of red lentil instead of half cup of lentil
Only peeledthe  cattots
Cooked in electric cooker / insta pot for 30mins on low
Second time making it. Today took to a pot luck luncheon with some vegatarian ladies. Every one enjoyed it 
Had greek yogurt, grated cheese & avocado for those who wanted it.

So yummy! I did make a few changes though.  I didn't have sweet potato so subbed in regular potato + pumpkin.  I also added a can of coconut milk and used green lentils instead of red.  It was delicious!

This recipe is pretty good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I doubled the recipe.   I toasted the pumpkin seeds and tossed with a little butter and maple syrup.  Yum.  I didn't have coconut milk so I just didn't use it.  The apple  saute was nice, just don't  over cook them.  It's nice to have the  crunch.

Good soup
Nice way to add sweet potatoe for kids
I would use less butter or replace w olive oil
Also taste Ian not predominantly lentil it’s combo sweet potatoes/carrot with light lentil can add more lentil if you wanna reinforce that flavor. 
Used half apple can omit and still be ok next few one
Added lemon juice and bit vinegar on bowl for an extra kick

Just like others, I’m not a big fan of puréed soups so I left it as a stew.  Flavors meld very nicely.  It’s got a complex sweet, spicy, savory thing going on.  Then you add the multiple textures and it’s a “party in your mouth!”  I skipped the dairy for health reasons but also didn’t feel that it needed anything more.

This is a delicious soup! I loved it and am actually glad it made more than I planned. I normally try to follow the recipe exactly but I couldn't find red lentils so I went with Red Beans instead (2 15oz cans). I also did not blend it though that would have been awesome as well. I just felt like eating something chunky soap instead of pureed soup. 

Love love love. I will totally make again.

This soup tasted nice and was very silky after the purée. I used an immersion blender and it’s worked great. I adapted it to make in my instant pot and it came out perfectly.

To make in instant pot: follow directions on original recipe only using the instant pot. Set to sauté setting for the first step. Once you have all that done leave it on while you add your spices, lentils and broth to keep things hot. Once you have that put together stop the pot and set to the high preassure setting for 15-17 minutes once it seals. After release pressure and carefully use your immersion blender in the pot. Remember stuffs super hot so try not to splash it on yourself or  you know stick your fingers in the blender while it’s going or any smooth moves like that.  After should be just fine.

I made this as written with the addition of 1 clove of garlic, minced and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that is what I had on hand.  I, too, chose not to puree the soup.  I'm not fond of soup being the texture of baby food.  It was just simple enough to take a potato masher and smash the soup to create some thickness while maintaining some texture with the partially mashed vegetables.  The flavor of this soup is interesting...I will make this one again.  It's going to my father-in-law as part of his birthday food gifts, but I tasted it myself just to make sure that it's tasty...and it is!

Came out perfect. I used baby carrots and feta cheese instead of sour cream as suggested. I also tried a serving with some chopped up cooked beets added in for the fun of it and it's delicious.  I've been eating this soup all week and loving it.

Used coconut oil instead of butter and added a couple cloves of garlic.
I tried it in the slow cooker the second time, do not try unless you cook the lentils separately.

Pretty good, overall. I do think the spices should have been added earlier than the liquid in order to heat them and bring out the flavors. To compensate, I added more spices, which resulted in the flavor I wanted.

That last instruction "add water as needed" is crucial - if you don't do this, it really does have the consistency of baby food. I added 4 extra cups of vegetable broth at the end, and the texture was perfect .

If you taste it before pureeing and the flavor isn't really want you want, I highly recommend continuing on and pureeing it. The flavors were so much better when blended together.

I made this for a large crowd and it was very well received.  I  doubled the  spices and used olive oil instead of butter.   Sauteed the spices with the vegetables before adding broth. I used a stick blender to partially puree the soup, leaving some small chunks of vegetables.   At the end I finished adding some coconut milk to the soup.

This is a go-to, especially in the fall and winter! I veganize it by just skipping the yogurt and using either Earth Balance vegan butter or olive oil. I would just echo the caution in the recipe about blending because the soup will still be hot (obviously) and it's easy to overfill the blender and burn yourself.

Wow! This was exceptional! The only major change that I would make would be to double it and share! I did add some tumeric and a little more salt but those were minor changes.

My husband would eat soup every day. I made without changes and it was a huge hit. Wonderful flavour, beautiful presentation and will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe but halved it. It is literally the first delicious thing I've made in over 15 years. I'm a horrible cook but no one enjoying this soup would know. Yea! Great recipe!

I thought it was pretty good. Added a bit of cinnamon on top of each serving. I might cut down on the chili powder and cumin next time but that's more of a personal taste. This soup had lots of flavor and is certainly a healthy, low calorie, low fat option for a hearty soup.

Delicious!  I made it just as written, except I only partially pureed it, leaving delicious small chunks of carrot and sweet potato.  Will definitely make this again.

New favorite soup!  I'm sure it's good as is but I changed it a little because my young boys usually don't like spice.  I sauteed veggies in olive oil (habit), and omitted the paprika and chili.  However, I thought the cumin smelled too overpowering.  Added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and a splash of maple syrup to balance it out, and OMG it was AMAZING.  My 4 year old and I cannot get enough.  Will be a staple this winter!

Great soup, I added much more water because I prefer it like that. I'm putting 4 stars because I feel it's a bit too much spicy for me. Next time I make this, I will put a little bit less chili powder and black pepper. 
Thank you for sharing this.

I loved this soup!  Made it exactly as written.  Delicious and healthy with a little kick from the ginger.  Nice winter soup, and nice soup to have if you are on a diet or even as a meal if you are not.  I hope your viewers try this one at least once.

It was a great recipe, easy to make in a pressure cooker/slow cooker. Next time I'm going to double the amount of cumin for a stronger curry type taste.

The only change I made was to throw in some spinach I had left over from a salad. This is one of the best tasting soups I've ever tasted! Wonderful! Oh, I didn't puree it - I left it like a stew.

This is so delicious! Since it didn't state what apples to use, I used Granny Smith apples and omitted the ginger because I don't like it. My son suggested I add Quinoa to make it a complete meal. I made a gallon of the soup and am so glad I did.

I used water instead of stock because I like to do things from scratch and didn't have time to make my own stock.  Because it's so thick, I added one extra cup of water.  It tasted good enough so that even my husband will eat it.  And it's also very easy to make, with ingredients that are all nourishing and easy to come by.  I'll wait a while, and then probably make it again when the days get colder.

this has a wonderful flavor.  the only think different I added was just a hint of smoked paprika.  It is warm and comforting.  perfect for fall weather.  a great 'cozy soup night' soup.  I think next time I would like to roast the carrots, potatoes, and onions just to see if it would bump it up a notch.  thanks so much.  will make it again.  It freezes very well and tastes better the next day.

I liked this.  I believe the negative reviews may be due to texture.  I didn't puree my batch, more due to laziness, just cooked it longer til most veggies were soft.  I like and am familiar w/the spices used, so I was prepared for how this would taste.  In fact, I added 4 cardamom pods to this along with a pinch of fennel seeds.  Will make again and vegan friend loved this.

This is a great soup.  Very thick. Very hearty.  The spices are great. I would even consider using it as a substitute for meat in tacos or chimichangas. I used regular green lentils because that is what I had in hand but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

This was fantastic! I am a "throw cook", so I have a very hard time not adjusting a recipe, even the first time I try it. I changed very little with this one. Since our daughter is lactose intolerant, I used olive oil vs. butter. Also, I used about an extra 1/3 cup lentils to use up what I had and then added about 1 to 1.5 t. hot Madras curry powder to punch up the flavor a bit. I also tasted it prior to using my immersion blender. I think it would be great without blending it, as well. However, I would recommend cooking it a little less to avoid the veggies being mushy. So hearty and delicious. Another good add if you wanted something a little richer (but less healthy!) might be a little coconut milk. Mmmm...thanks for the recipe! We will definitely make this again and again!

This was absolutely delicious! I hate when people say how they changed it, but I did. I like things more flavourful and less subtle so I doubled all the seasonings and add an extra 1/4 of lentils. So 4 stars for the original. I'm not usually a huge sweet potato person, but you can't even tell what it is! So healthy!

This was delicious, easy to make and healthy. As someone else said the ingredients are things you're likely to have on hand. I had carrots and Apple's that I needed to use. This was perfect. Instead of butter, I used olive oil, but everything else was the same.

Make sure to add the yogurt garnish (or sour cream in its place). The soup tastes flat without it.

Also, the ingredients need to be clarified for novice cooks. Apples and onions come in different sizes. Two large sweet potatoes and three large carrots NEED a large apple and a large onion (not jumbo sized from Sam's Club which meant that I had to pare down to 3/4 onion).  I noticed because my onions were huge and my apples were small. Novice cooks need the sizes for balance.

I probably won't make this again. I had to freeze this in servings because no one else in the family likes it at all.

I have made this several times and it is really, really good. I made it as written minus the cumin due to personal tastes. I make it in the insta-pot using the saute feature and then pressure for 20 minutes. It comes out perfect. I don't puree the soup. We like it chunky.

This is one of my all time favorites that I make often.  I'm a vegetarian and this soup is hearty enough to serve and satisfy the meat eaters in my family.  The only changes I made were to sauté in coconut oil and to add about 1/2 tsp of Cayenne pepper.  After it has simmered I let it sit for a while with the burner off before blending with my immersion blender.  Delicious!

LOVED this soup!!!  The only change I made was using Earth Balance "butter" instead of real butter, to make a vegan version.    Add I didn't garnish with yogurt.  Using my immersion blender made this an easy recipe -- much better than using a blender.  It was so creamy and absolutely delicious.  Huge hit with everyone in the family -- even those who aren't big on pureed soups.  I'd recommend making a double batch.

Delicious and different from other vegetable soup recipes.  I've modified it to suit my tastes.  I prefer the chunky texture so I don't bother with the puree.  I use smoked paprika instead of regular because it plays well against the sweetness of the apple and sweet potato.  I omit the yogurt topping and just squeeze a little lemon juice for acidity.

Wow! What a recipe!! Made this for a sick friend and didn't think I'd like it since it didn't have any meat...boy was I completely wrong! My hubby loved it too! I did a couple changes...used a total of 3 golden delicious apples and 1 cup of lentils along with 2 extra cups of broth. Left it like a stew and served with basmati rice as others had suggested. Fantastic and very filling even without any meat!! Will be making this again!

This is really, really good.  The flavors are perfect and the recipe is easy to understand with minimal mess.  If you have an immersion blender, this is a one-pot meal.  (If you don't, GO OUT AND BUY ONE!  It'll change your life!)  Also, don't omit the yogurt garnish.  It's optional, but so, so good.

So good.  So so so good!  I've made per the recipe, and also deviated at times by using my leftover Thanksgiving sweet potatoes and adding in onion, apple, lentils, spices, etc.  Didn't matter that there were random other ingredients included w/ the sweet potatoes, it was all just delicious.  With some toasted sourdough this is going to be a scrumptious dinner tonight.

This soup was delicious!  I doubled the spices and did not puree it as it was already quite soft in texture.  The sour of the yogurt was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the soup.

The flavor wag great but the recipe is a little vague on the ingredient amounts.  2 large sweet potatoes is fine but a weight range would make this so much better.  Mine turned out to be more of a very flavorful mashed sweet potatoes.  It also filled a 6 qt dutch oven.   I really liked the flavor though I used Chicken Broth (I eat Paleo not a vegetarian).

My husband and I love this soup.  But I did make a couple changes, only because I didn't have any sweet potatoes on hand.  We got loads of winter squash from our CSA this fall.  I had some cooked acorn squash in my freezer, so I thawed that out and added it to the soup in place of the sweet potatoes.  I also switched out the cumin for an equal amount of curry spice.  I added about 2/3 cup coconut milk at the end after pureeing.  Hearty, filling, nutritious.  Will definitely make again.

This is an amazing recipe.  It is the best soup I have ever had.  Changes I made because I did not want to go out - I used water and chicken broth powder instead of vegetable broth and I left out the sweet potato.  I added 3 cloves of garlic.  I wanted "cream of", so I added milk for the extra liquid.

Quick and easy; absolutely delicious!  The red lentils make this a little heartier than a lot of squash-type puréed soups, and it works!   The blend of spices is just right.  I didn't change a thing!

This soup is like having Fall in a bowl  :-)
My family liked it. But some of us didn't care for the addition of yugort.
I don't see using butter here necessary, for taste or texture. Olive oil would have been just fine and that's what I would use next time. Should cut down the fat and the calories when ever possible..

I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker! I found this to be a great recipe. I was able to use up lots of different veggies and I did throw in a little chicken broth since I only used mainly water. Great healthy soup.

I loved this soup, and it was surprisingly not too sweet.  I used half of the butter and 1/8 cup coconut oil and doubled the other spices as others have suggested. Other than that the only change I made was to add a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.

I really liked this recipe. I deviated from the original quite a bit,  I made it with 1kg of sweet potatoes, 3 huge carrots,  1 onion,  3/4 lentils and 3 apples. I doubled all the spices and used 8 cups of mushroom stock. Really yummy ??

I love this soup. I only used about half the amount of spices, and it worked well for me. The 1st time, I used a traditional blender, but bought an immersion blender soon after. It took less time and less to clean up after. I have also made it without pureeing and enjoyed it that way. While I usually have crackers with my creamy soups, I've tried this with chopped walnuts, for crunch and liked it .

I usually skip the yogurt, sub oil for butter, and found everyone from vegan to carnivores enjoy this dish.
I don't bother pureeing the soup. Without pureeing I prefer other lentils to red as the red kinda fall apart and don't add much for texture. Red lentils would be great if you plan to puree.

Really good with the yogurt.  Won't purée next time. It's great chunky. Like someone else mentioned I added 4c fresh chopped spinach in the last 5 mins. 
I omitted salt as there was enough in the veg broth.

Someone mentioned adding 1-2cloves of garlic. It's not needed but will try next time to see if it gets even better.

Could sub butter for coconut oil.

Amazing! I want to eat the whole pot! I added a bit more carrots and lentils. I used white sweet potatoes (not yams) and a Vidalia onion and Honey Crisp Apple. White pepper instead of black.  And I used coconut oil instead of butter as another reviewer suggested. Omg. I'll make this again for sure!

Fantastic! The yogurt does change the flavor dramatically and cuts down on the "sweet". Don't skip the yogurt! Very savory and very filling. It freezes and reheats easily.

This was great and we  loved it!.  Sweet potato gives that rich sweetness  to the red lentil soup. It was nice with Feta Cheese as garnish as that's what I had instead of the plain yogurt. A real filling soup!

I made this exactly how the recipe stated the first time and LOVED it! I made it two more times and was disappointed. My husband (I knew I married him for a reason) asked about the carrots I used each time and it dawned on me that the first successful batch had whole carrots in it while the second and third unsuccessful batches had baby and matchstick carrots in them. Those two batches completely lacked flavor. My advice:  stick with whole carrots!!! It makes a HUGE difference!!! We also leave all the skins on the veggies and throw in spinach for added nutrients. Definitely a family favorite! So now that we have the carrot issue fixed, our next attempt will be replacing the butter with EVOO to make it vegan! :)

I recently decided to try this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand, and needed to use them up. I was a bit worried that it was going to be a sweet soup, but it was only mildly sweet. This was a nice creamy rich soup.

I made this for a dinner party tonight and it was delicious!!! Everyone loved it! I used regular lentils as i could not find red lentils and it was soooooo good. I also didn,t have fresh ginger and powdered worked just fine. It was super good and used veteaable broth instead of chicken.  I added more spices than it called for because I like spicey1

Excellent! A 'large' sweet potato is a bit subjective, so I used more lentils. It needs enough to lend their nutty flavor for the best taste. I think my sweet potatoes were closer to 'ginormous'. Other than that, I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.

The adults and kids in my house like this soup.  I use water instead of butter to cook the onions, then add the other ingredients.  After peeling the carrots, they can be quickly chopped using a blender.  When we have leftover butternut squash, I use a mixture of sweet potatoes and butternut squash (instead of just sweet potatoes).  We usually serve with brown rice and red quinoa on top instead of plain yogurt.

As per usual on this site, I was searching something I could make with sweet potatoes and carrots. I found this lovely recipe and thought I would try it out. It turned out great! I halved the recipe, but making the whole recipe, one could definitely freeze a few portions. I topped mine with bacon and cheddar cheese for a twist on baked potato soup.

I love this recipe. I don't blend it, I leave it chunky. The yogurt is so good - I get a good whole-milk kind! (My husband eats it without, he likes spicy and doesn't like dairy). I top my serving with sliced avocado and it is to die for.  Trader Joe's sells a curry spice mixture, goes really well in this soup, and any lentil soup! I love that it's simple ingredients that I can buy a couple of days ahead. It is NOT time consuming. If it was, I wouldn't make it. It is so worth the little bit of effort! 
Adjustments: 
*2 sweet potatoes is TOO MUCH unless you are buying teeny tiny potatoes. One is plenty.
*I add a stalk or two of celery
*Top with avocado, YUMMM
*You don't need that much chicken stock. If you use that much, you shouldn't need to add salt (the spices and fruit/veggie combo is so flavorful!) I use part water in place of the chicken (1:1 or a little less water).

I like how healthy this soup is, but it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. The yogurt really helped, and I also added some cilantro which made it even better. I probably won't make this soup very often, though.

This was so great! I don't understand the reviewers who said it was so much work. Yeah, there was some peeling and chopping, but really? Nothing out of the ordinary, and a delicious, healthy dinner was on the table in an hour. Great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I chose not to puree it and leave it chunky like a stew- just a person preference. Great mix of savory and slightly sweet flavor.

My family loved this soup... particularly our 13 month old son.  My husband accidentally made it using normal green lentils and we used the crock pot but otherwise he says he followed the instructions.  This will become a staple in our home in the winter months.  Thanks to the author!

Love this recipe. I have made it several times. My preference is to double the amount of lentils and to not puree it. This makes it much more like a stew.

This was a nice nutritious and refreshing change of use for sweet potatoes, ala Thanksgiving. Was great as is but I might kick up the spice a little next time..also I did purée about half of the batch so it was thicker but still had a stew-like texture. A definite keeper.

I didn't  blend it, but chopped  everything fairly small l and mashed it in the pot with a potato masher when it was done.  The texture and thickness was quite good, not too watery, nor too thick. I increased the spices slightly, but could use more.  Yummy soup, how could it not be with such good ingredients?  I don't like leftovers, so I might halve this next time I make it for two people, but it's a good recipe size for 4, especially with bread or maybe rice.  The yogurt makes it seem a little like a curry, and really adds to the soup, plus cools the first spoonfuls to a nice temperature.

I've been making this soup for a couple of years now and love it! I just wanted to finally thank the original contributor.
My own touch is to add about half a cup of white wine when the soup is done. I find it cuts the sweetness and mellows the soup (but not the soup slurppers, not to worry...)

Only thing I changed was the serving size.  We made this for our food pantry at church. Needed 30 quarts. This soup is outstanding.
I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving.

Very tasty and healthy! I hate peeling and chopping sweet potatoes, so instead I cooked them in the microwave with skins on, then scooped them out into the pot while all the other ingredients were simmering (just before pureeing everything). It worked great and cut back on the prep time slightly.

followed the recipe exactly except used coriander instead of cumin as I didn't have any cumin. This was fantastic! Like many other reviewers I did not puree it..just mashed it with a potato masher. Such a complimentary set of flavors. I made it a second time and used more apple (I have an apple tree and was trying to use them up)..I used 3 and loved the result..also i used the smokey paprika and chipotle for the chili pepper. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Made a few changes:
1) Roasted the chopped sweet potatoes & carrots at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes. I covered them in a tbs of melted butter and 5 cloves of minced garlic. 
2) Instead of vegetable broth, I used Pacific chicken broth. 
3) Instead of chili pepper I used cayenne.
4) I used a Royal Gala apple rather than a Honey Crisp. 

Absolutely delicious! If I were to make it again I may cut slightly back on the spices because I didn't serve it with yogurt. I may try it again with the yogurt added, but I may substitute whipped cream cheese instead.

Absolutely delicious. Much sweeter than I would have expected without added sugar. I left the extra salt out and it didn't need it either. I also added some coriander as I really like coriander and cumin together but did the rest exactly as it says here. Yes, it takes some time but not too much and since I am alone I made the whole recipe and put the remainder in the freezer so I got food for 5 days out of it. Will certainly be recommending this to friends and family and making it again after I get through this batch.

Absolutely delicious. Made it for my daughter and her colleagues for staff soup day at her school, it was a great hit. As I had made a double batch I used 11/2 * herbs and spices instead of double and it worked perfect. However when I made again the following week for our church bazaar it wasn't quite the same and the only difference was I added more pepper than I should have, in error, plus I used a different Apple and bag of canrrots and this too could have added to the change in taste as some carrots are sweeter than others. Still very good though and one of our favourites. By the way I puréed and served with Feta.

I have made this soup to the delight of everyone who has eaten it.  I even get requests for it.  I love the healthy aspect, it's different and so delicious. I cut back on cumin, but that's it.  And I don't always puree it.  Its great either way.  It's so great to have a recipe that is a sure fire hit! Thank you for this recipe

I made this as something to hold the crowd over for a family dinner, and it was so delicious!  I skipped the purée step and am very happy I did.  The texture was absolutely wonderful just the way it is.  I didn't deviate from anything else, although I wish I had made more because there was none left to enjoy later!  This is a great cold weather soup that will be going into my regular rotation.

this was very good- I also replaced most of the butter with oil but otherwise made it as recommended.  Unlike others, I used the blender and it made it so much nicer- beautiful color blend and perfect for an autumn dinner.

I started off looking for a dish that could use my leftover gala apples but I didn't want a dessert. I made a lot of substitutions and additions. I wanted to use what I had on hand so instead of sweet potato, I used 432 grams pumpkin from my garden. I increased the apples to 454 grams and decreased the butter to 48 grams instead of 56 and made it margarine. I used 134 grams carrots, 194 grams onion, added 78 grams celery and increased the lentils to 1 cup (186 grams). I didn't have vegetable broth so I used 454 grams rice water and 454 grams potato water and added 4 servings vegetable bouillon, I added one additional cup of tap water. I didn't have chili powder so I used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. I used kosher salt instead of regular salt and ginger powder not fresh. I ate this both blended and chunky and either way it's fantastic, I did not use yogurt or cheese. This was so good, I can only imagine how good it would have been if I followed the recipe to a T! I will make this again and try future variations and perhaps even make the exact recipe! It's a keeper!

This was a hit with my family. I went half on the spices, except for salt, and used chicken instead of veggie broth.  Mine was pureed with some chunks.  It had a rich taste my family craves and it's pretty healthy. Next time I'm making a double batch as there was none left.

We love this soup. Meaning, me, my husband and all 3 kids. I didn't change very much other than double the quantities to make more of it. It's so quick and easy to make, it's a pureed soup, which is always preferable with my picky kids. It has just the right amount of "kick" which my husband always wants - and if you want a little more, add a touch more chili powder and ginger. The apple adds a bit of sweetness to it, without taking away the other flavours. It's filling and it's healthy, and for us, not a winter soup at all - it's an all year round soup in our house!

This is the first review I have ever done but felt compelled to give credit! I have made this several times and love it! I omit the onion as I despise it and I never purée. It does not look tasty but the flavors and ingredients are perfect together!

Delicious! I added a tsn honey to cut the heat and didn't puree it. Originally I made it for my 13-mos old but my husband (who hates vegetables) and I LOVED it! Great as a stew - served with toast.

Truly excellent flavor!  I've never written a review for a recipe before, but felt compelled to do so because this is so good!  I followed the recipe closely except for the following:  I added 2 stalks celery, used ~2x the amount of cumin and ginger, used yellow lentils instead of red. Didn't use paprika.  Garnished with Greek yogurt and cilantro.  And I didn't puree it - I generally prefer some texture and chunkiness to my soups.

This is really excellent fall/winter soup.  Will be making again and again.

Made this for the 4th time this afternoon and I finally have a winner! Used  a combination of butter and canola/olive oil to make up the 1/4 cup needed. Plus, I added a cup of broth to the oil. Then once it was bubbly, I added the spices for about a minute, THEN some granulated garlic and hot sauce, and then followed the rest of the recipe - used sweet Vidallia onions - and doubled the spicing (except for the salt). It REALLY helps. I used a full cup of lentils instead of just a half (which meant I needed to use 6 cups of broth). I also think that simmering at medium-low  makes a big difference to the tenderness of the sweet potatoes carrots - so you don't have to puree the soup to get the best taste.

I used to make a very similar soup (with carrots, sweet potatoes, and red lentils) every Thanksgiving, but it was missing a little something. Finding this recipe brought it into a whole new league! Everyone loved it. Thank you.

Wow! What a delight! I was looking for a lentil soup recipe and came across this gem. Thankfully it worked our just right that I had all the recipe on hand and needed to use the produce items. For my soup, I didn't blend it as the recipe recommends, but rather kept it like a stew as others did. I'm so glad I did! I love the texture and much prefer it to the creamy-style soups. I omitted the plan yogurt. The soup really didn't need it in my opinion. I used shredded carrots and green lentils as that is what I had on hand. This soup turned out LOVELY and it was super easy! Just a lot of dicing and throwing into a pot! Putting this one in my Keepers folder!

Every time I make this, people ask for the recipe. I use olive oil instead of butter, and I don't use the yogurt at the end -- it is great without it. I also add a couple extra apples. This soup is a vitamin powerhouse! 

This comes together really quickly if you feed the veggies and fruit into your food processor (obviously not if you don't plan on pureeing it). I thin it at the end with water as I don't like baby food consistency, and I top with croutons or peeled diced apple. There is so much flavor on this soup, and your house will smell like Fall heaven!

Made this tonight and everyone loved it! I subbed dry ginger for fresh and used broth from boiling cabbage to make golabki as my base. I did not purée the soup and threw some torn baby spinach in the bottom of the bowls, and yogurt on top..my family all commented on the unique flavour and healthy-factor. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely great.  I made both a veggie version and one with ground turkey.  Both were excellent.  THe mix of sweet and salty is really good.  You can substitute garam masala for seasoning as well.

This was wonderful.  The apple lent a nice sweetness. I added more broth to unthicken it and threw in about one and a half cups of frozen tomatoes (since they were thawed in my frig).  Low cal and healthy.  i'll make this again. I don't understand the 'baby food' comments, this is similar to any chunky creamy soup, without the dairy.

Had this for dinner, and my two guys, who were a little skeptical about no meat or cheese in what was for dinner, both gobbled it down. Like a lot of the other reviews said, I didn't do the puree, but just left it more like a stew. The carrots still had some firmness, which gave it a nice texture. Oh, and I used coconut oil instead of the butter to make it a little healthier. Very yummy!

As others have mentioned, one of the best things about this recipe is that I didn't even need to go to the store because all the ingredients were already in my kitchen. I followed the recipe with just a few minor changes: I ommited the yogurt and added a bit of shredded sharp chedder cheese to the top which complimented the apples really well and used low sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable. This recipe was a great way to cook up some mediocre snacking apples and was super easy to make with an immersion blender. I am definitely making this recipe again!

I was super excited to make this soup per the reviews...  I was sadly disappointed in the "lack" of much flavor, maybe I should have doubled all the spices.  Unfortunately, this is not something I will make again, which is sad because we are a Family of Soup Lovers.....

I have now made this several times and it is always a crowd pleaser! I usually use coconut oil instead of butter which has an added bonus of making it vegan. I also almost double the spices, reduce the salt, and if I don't have sweet potatoes on hand, I have used squash with great success! This soup is so versatile and loved by everyone I have seen try it. You won't be disappointed! Today I made a variation by adding red curry paste, coconut milk, and fresh cilantro... It was amazing! Sriracha also goes along nicely. I don't find the yogurt garnish adds much.

Just made this and love it! Only changes: I used half sweet potatoes and half regular potatoes, also 2 cloves of garlic and no ginger. I didn't puree, I just mashed a bit when done cooking. I also added a container of cooking cream after I mashed, and 3 cups of cut fresh spinach for the last 5 minutes. YUMMMM!!!

MARVELOUS!!!!!  I made it almost as the recipe except I added 2 star anise pods for part of the cooking time and a generous amount of chilli seeds.  I didn't have paprika in my pantry.  
I used more fresh ginger than the recipe, perhaps 2tsp.
I pureed the stew and the consistency & colour was wonderful.  I served it with a choice of white baguette or sourdough bread and a dollop of natural yoghurt for each bowl.  
I made it especially for a dinner party during winter and it was an hit.  Thanks so much for this little keeper :)

I was a little disappointed in the final product after reading the great reviews.  Preparation was labor- intensive with chopping up potatoes and carrots (using nutribullet) .  Family did not like taste of the blend of vegetables.  However, was hearty, chunky and filling.

It is just my husband and me. Normally when I cook, I freeze leftovers. This was SO GOOD that my husband had seconds and he begged me not to freeze the leftovers. The soup was gone by the next night. The soup was easy to make and very delicious.

I have cooked this soup twice.  More of a bisque.  Wonderful flavors.   Easy to make.  Company loves it when I serve it.  And it can be eaten with most food restrictions.  The puree gave it such a light, creamy and airy texture.  Thank you for posting this great recipe.

Love this soup! Extremely tasty and warming for the winter. I only put in 1/4 tsp of Chilli powder so my 3 year old will eat it. This will definitely be a staple in my house this winter!

I didn't change anything about this recipe other than the blending like stated in previous comments. I blended half because i thought it looked nicer, but i feel like the flavors mushed together, and it tasted a little more bland than the unblended soup. I mixed the two back together, and it was perfect.

This recipe was easy to make and tastes great!  My children were surprised when I told them it had apple as an ingredient.  We didn't have red lentils so used green in thier place.  My son added chiracha to his bowl to give it a kick.  I will be making this dish again.

Delicious! A wonderful, hearty mixture of sweet and savory that's just perfect for cold weather. I topped it with sour cream and it was wonderful. The only thing I didn't do was puree it (I thought it would take too long and I was ready for dinner!), but I think it would taste wonderful if you did.

I love this recipe!  I have made it about 6 times since coming across the recipe a few months ago.  The flavors are wonderful and it is so easy to make.  I follow the recipe too a T, unless I have extra cooked vegetables in fridge to use up.  Then, I just add them towards the end of the cooking process and puree them along with the other ingredients.   Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

A wonderfully filling and healthy fall soup with a lovely mix of flavors. I recommend leaving the veggies, apple, and lentils as is and skipping the pureeing part. That makes it more like a stew than a soup but the texture is much better. Thanks for sharing, will definitely be making it again!

I halved the chili pepper, since I didn't want it too spicy, and that was perfect for me. I also went with powdered ginger, and only 1/4 tsp since it was not fresh ginger root. The mix of seasonings is perfect. The reviews were incredibly helpful. I didn't puree it (didn't want more to clean), but I think it would be really good pureed. It is a great one-pot dish, with incredible flavor. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is! Also, I used butter because I ran out of my usual coconut oil.

This soup tastes absolutely amazing! I made a few modifications, some on purpose and some accidentally, but the soup turned out exactly how I had hoped it would. I love my foods on the sweet side, so I omitted the salt. I'm not a huge fan of ginger except with sushi, so I omitted the ginger as well. I increased the serving size to 10 servings. I ended up putting in 1/3 + 1/4 cup of butter to saute the veggies and apples for the first step. I used approximately 2 small yellow onions, 1/4 of a sweet potato, 4 medium-large sized carrots, and 1 granny smith apple. I stirred and cooked this mixture for longer than 10 minutes, probably more like 20 min. Then, step 2 - I stirred in 2.5 cups of red lentils, omitting the ginger and salt, I added in the ground black pepper, cumin, chili powder, paprika, 2 fresh large garlic cloves and 5.5 cups of chicken broth (boiled water and chicken bouillon powder). I boiled the soup for 10 min, then turned the heat down to medium-high for another 20-30 min. Then I added in 2.5 cups of low-fat milk and 1 tablespoon of non-dairy creamer. I used a potato masher instead of a blender to mash the veggies and apple in the soup to make it a smoother consistency, but didn't want to make it a puree so I skipped the step with the blender. The soup turned out to be perfectly seasoned and sweet and just the right consistency, not too pureed and not too chunky. I was a bit skeptical of adding the cumin and chili powder, but am glad I did. What a delicious soup!

What great favors. I always follow the recipe as written the fist time I make it and then make "my version". Not any changes wil be made for this one in the future.

I really liked this! Since I have TMJD I have to eat softer or pureed foods and this one really filled me up! Perfect mixture of sweet and spicy - and adding greek yogurt on top added a hint of sour. I did use red beans since I couldn't find any lentils at all at my normal grocery store. 
I highly recommend this soup.

This soup is amazing. I used half the salt and regular lentils instead of red. Otherwise I followed it exactly. Yum!

A friend of mine made this recipe awhile back, and I thought it was delicious! I think she may have added an extra apple though, because my end result wasn't as apple tasting. I originally planned on leaving it chunky, but I pureed a little bit just to see what it tasted like, and it was really good, but I also wanted some chunkiness, so I pureed half of it, then left the other half chunky. I also added a pinch of cinnamon. Turned out great!

Very nice combination of flavors. I added 2 stalks of celery, only because i had them in the fridge, increased the apples to 1 1/2 for sweetness, since my carrots weren't as sweet as i would have liked them. I tried both versions, stew and Puree. The Puree was by far the better choice. You get all of the flavors at once. Add a squeeze of lime juice, chopped spinach before serving... Yummy

This soup is amazing! I would make this soup again and again. Not only is it a wonderful side with dinner, a great main dish, but we also chilled it and used it as a dip the next day for apples at snack time. Absolutely wonderful! The first time I made it, it did not take the noted prep and cook times. It took far far longer. So be prepared, relax, and step away as needed.

This is scrumptious and I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, but the favors in this soup are perfect. I halved the spices, because I don't like food too spicy. My apples were a little small, so I added two. Perfecto!

I made modifications based on the following:  I looked high and low and could not find red lentils anywhere AND didn't have any chicken broth on hand.  SO I substituted black beans and plain old water.  And guess what?!  It was still scrumptious!!  That spicy undertaste with the sweetness of the apple and sweet potato was wonderful.  I'll be making this again.

I absolutely love this recipe!  

In order to make it more healthy, I replace the butter with coconut oil.  Together with the apple this fragrance and touch of sweetness adds such an amazing offset to the spices.  It just dances in your mouth!  This is a winter favourite in my family that I make over and over.

this was so easy.  Chop everything up, add to a crock pot on low for 8 hr, then use handblender to chop it up.  An easy, no fuss meal with great flavor (and I'm not a fan of pureed soups).

It was delicious! I did not have sweet potatoes so I used the red potatoes I had on hand. My 7 yr old son said it tasted like squash. My 12 year old daughter thought it was good but nothing to write home about. I THOROUGHLY enjoyed considering I love home cooked meals that taste like something from the restaurant. Give it a try...it's really delicious!!

MMM this was yummy and simple! I threw in some celery since I had it in the fridge, and used cayanne powder instead of chili and didn't use cumin (i didn't have it) It was so easy just chopping up some veggies and throwing them in! I even left the skins on (excluding the apple) so it couldn't have been easier.. Topped it off with a dollip of sour cream instead of yogurt.. Will totally make it again :) 
Those who said it wasn't worth the effort REALLY need to get an immersion blender, those things are amazing.

This was delicious! I only had one sweet potato, and I added some ground ancho chili, and I didn't puree it, but it was excellent nonetheless. Healthy, nourishing and sooooo tasty. All the ingredients worked together very well. I did use less butter than called for, but the taste was wonderful. Thank you for such a fine recipe.

Wow! What a savory, hearty winter soup. Wife said it was her favorite soup to date. I had to use chicken broth in lieu of vegetable broth. I added a potato and left the skins on to keep more nutrition locked in, nobody noticed since it all ended up pureed. Also used vanilla flavored greek yogurt. I think plain would have been better. Really healthy except for the sodium. I think I would hunt down some low sodium vegetable broth next time. Really left me full too with all those complex carbs.

A great soup for chilly winter evenings! The only changes I made were to use olive oil instead of butter, & I used an immersion mixer to puree the soup (rather than trying to dump hot soup in batches between a standard blender & the soup pot). The immersion blender really is a life-saver in recipes like this! I served this soup as a side; the rest of the meal included roasted carrots, parsnips, & brussels sprouts, brown basmati rice which I cooked in veggie broth, & boneless chicken thighs baked in a dijon-&-maple sauce. I'll be serving this yummy soup as a side in the future, & also for lunches with a hunk of hearty bread. So healthy, & the seasonings enhance the warming effect.

As suggested, I did NOT puree and I added 4 cups of spinach (chopped) 5 minutes before serving. I also substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth. This soup is very quick and easy to make--I already had all the ingredients on hand. The flavors are just right, especially with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt. It is my new favorite soup recipe.

Really nice stew. I didn't puree it, and added some leftover chickpeas I had in the fridge. Also put some coriander and garam masala in.

I made this last night and it was delicious.. Perfect blend of favors. Topped off with plain yogurt.  Only had one sweet potato,so just added a few extra carrots. I love using red lentils,used smaller amount of butter and added a bit of olive oil.

This was a great soup with fabulous texture. We pureed it because we wanted that texture, but I imagine that it would be good either way. We also used chicken broth because we didn't have any vegetable, and it tasted great!

I have made this twice now. I LOVED it the first time but my second batch came out so-so. I finally realized the difference in batches. The first time I used only 1/4 cup of lentils, instead of the 1/2 cup suggested and honestly I feel like the fewer the lentils the more the apple flavor stood out, which I prefer. This is a great recipe and was super easy to make especially if you have an immersion blender. 
I will continue to make this all winter long!

This is a pretty great soup.  I was looking at other reviews that suggested leaving the soup as a stew, but decided that the pureed texture was slightly more appealing in this case.  I added about 3/4 tsp of some good muchi curry powder, as well as a little cayenne for some kick.

This was nice and pretty easy to make. I used 2 Tbs coconut oil in place of the 1/4 cup butter and didn't have any issues using half the fat called for. I pureed half of it and left the other half chunky as I'm not the biggest fan of pureed soups.

This turned out fantastic!  I'll admit I did edit it a little, using olive oil instead of butter, adding the whole (14.5 oz) can of lentils, and substituting a bit of feta cheese instead of the yogurt.  But the soup was delicious!  Nice and thick, and very filling with a crusty slice of bread.  A great healthy winter meal!

I get excited about any recipe that is healthy and that can be shared by my whole family (me, my husband, and my 10 month-old son) without modifications. This recipe fits the bill. I ended up accidentally having to under-season it a bit when I realized too late that I was low on both paprika and chili powder, but that just made it more baby-friendly, and it still had enough flavor for the adults. My husband would probably have preferred this with some bacon sprinkled on top, but I thought it was great as a vegetarian soup. Definitely don't skip the yogurt on this one. I sometimes consider garnishes optional, but in this case the tanginess of the yogurt added necessary contrast to the soup.

I was feeling really lazy one day, but had all the ingredients, so thought I'd try making it a simpler way (had made it before the usual way with great results).  I just put all the ingredients in a roasting pan, and chucked it in the oven.  It was nearly as good as the usual way, only dirtied one pan, and required very little prep.  I was also able to use less oil (I subbed coconut oil - yum, but had used olive oil in the past with good results as well).  I also prefer it with more spices, as others have recommended, so increased the amount to my taste.  It was a hit, and for a lazy day, I'll be using the oven method again.

This wasn't terrible; I wasn't going to puree it like some people said, but when I tasted it I was wondering if it would taste better if I did so; so I put it in the blender, added a drop of plan greek yogurt and then it was yummy!  I also used black lentils bc I didn't have any red ones; I also left out the salt..not sure if I would make it again but it wasn't terrible!

Excellent soup!  
We halved the recipe, but went ahead and used the full apple.  This doubling of the apple is the only change we made from the original.  As I added the spices, I thought this might taste a bit like chili, but that was not the case.  It was nicely flavored, with a wonderful unique flavor!  We'll definitely be making it again!

Such a fabulous fall soup that is worthy of any dinner party!  When I read all the ingredients, I knew it would be delicious.  Use the red lentils so the color of the soup is a beautiful autumn color when it is pureed.  The flavor was perfect, but I think I will use olive oil in place of the butter next time to make it healtier.  Definitely a keeper!

Ah-MAZING!  This soup is so good and will be one of my favorite go to soups.  Serve with good whole wheat bread/biscuits for supper or perfect to have ready to warm up for lunch guests.  Everyone in our family loved the mellow, warm flavours of this soup.  We will be making this again, and again, and again!

Unexpectedly delicious.  I used a large onion, I slivered some fresh ginger, didn't put in the chili powder as I didn't have any, and I didn't have broth so I used water.  After boiling I threw in some sliced mushrooms as well. DELICIOUS.  I semi-pureed it, leaving some of it stew-like.  I also made some quinoa on the side to add to the protein.  I prefer it separately, though.  Absolutely un-improvable :) Thanks!

I love indian food and this soup with a few tweeks tastes like a vegetable korma.  I made a few changes.  I didn't puree it, and I added a can of peas as well as doubling the onions and lentils.  I also added a teaspoon of curry powder.  I served it with a plain yogurt and sour cream mix.  We loved it.

Delicious fall soup.  I followed the other comments and didn't puree the soup and used ground ginger instead of fresh.  Made great leftovers, too!  Will definitely be making this again soon!

Added a heaping tablespoon of garlic, a dash of cinnamon and some nutmeg.

I mashed the cooked veggies and ran a hand-blender through it. The consistency was varied, so it was nice.

Instead of broth I used water and about a tablespoon of coriander (I like reeeally thin soup so I added about 8-10 cups of liquid to the veggies at the end and just let it simmer)

Love the flavours. Awesome Fall soup. Adding it to my collection of soups for sure.

I skimmed some of the other reviews and adore the idea of coconut milk (or maybe even coconut yogurt!?) in place of the real yogurt for us vegans to serve it with.

Thank you for the recipe, Zhidaoma!

I substituted oil for butter, regular potatoes for the sweet potatoes (what I had on hand) and a full can of cooked lentils for the dried (added them near the end of the simmer-time). Turned out great! Perfectly spiced.

Excellent flavor! I would advise fewer carrots and more apples, though.

This is a favorite lunch. Quick easy and healthy. Greek yogurt on the top finishes it.

I've made this soup so many times and it continues to be a favorite!  I never blend it up, I prefer a chunky soup.  I like to add a little garlic to the veggies when they are cooking down and I go heavy on the chili powder, usually skip the yogurt.  Served with a crunchy piece of bred to soak up the brother - perfect!

This is my favorite soup right now!  I just love it!  Sometimes when I make it, I add about 1 lb of ground meat, which is fabulous for us non-vegetarians.  Also this last time I made it, besides the ground beef, I added about 3 cups of chopped kale.  It was wonderful!  The kale not only added to the flavor, texture and nutrition, but make it look nice too.  I only puree some of the veggies to make the broth thick, but didn't puree any of the kale.

Absolutely delicious! I used actual real sweet potatoes (the yellow kind) not yams, and chopped them pretty small in my processor. I added an extra apple which I think really helped, because the stew had an ideal sweetness. I used both Earth Balance margarine and olive oil, extra salt, and used Imagine no-chicken broth (which is amazing!). I also doubled the lentils. Did not puree and had it as a stew, which I'm really happy about. Overall - really, really  good stew, for vegans and meat-eaters alike!!

I am pleasantly surprised by this soup!  I've probably tried 3 or 4 different sweet potato soup recipes but this by far is my favorite.  The combination of the sweet potatoes, carrots and apple is delicious.  The seasonings are perfect and the apple adds just the right amount of sweetness.  I made this soup vegan by using olive oil rather than butter.

WOW!!!  This soup was AMAZING!!  We just finished supper, and I just had to rate it right away.  Unfortunately, my sons didn't share my enthusiasm, and my husband isn't really into soups with fruit in them.  But I like this so much that I'm going to make some more and freeze it for myself.  Next time, I'm going to add more lentils.  I put half in the blender and was really pleased with the way it came out.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Fantastic recipe! I served to my fiance' who says he doesn't like sweet potatoes or lentils. He LOVED this and has changed his mind about both ingredients. I used creme fraiche instead of yogurt and it was delicious.

I found this recipe pretty darn tasty as followed. Personal preference tweeks: i would add more lentils (up to a cup) for more protein. I think that the soup not pureed is very tasty, just make sure you don't cook your veg too mushy, just to the point of tender. and if you need to make it more hearty, some cooked chicken (either diced or shredded) would fit the bill.

I really like the flavor of this soup--it's a good spice balance and has a heartiness that's very nice. Instead of going the more vegetarian route, I added some meaty richness to the soup. I fried bacon, cooked the vegetables in the bacon fat instead of butter, and then when the soup was pureed, chopped the bacon up and put it on top. The soup needs something to counteract the sweetness of the apples and sweet potatoes, and the fattiness and saltiness of the bacon did that well. I also added some garlic in the original spice mixture, and a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper to bring sweet-cutting heat. If you decide to try the bacon, I'd suggest holding off on salting the soup until it's done. Depending on what kind of bacon you use, it can sometimes provide all the salt you need.

I was excited to try a fall soup with ingredients I already had on hand. However, this soup was just "meh." I followed it exactly except for vegetable broth (I used half chicken broth half water) but I don't think it would have made a difference. The cumin and chili did not blend well with the sweetness of the apples and sweet potato, in my opinion. Fed us for a night, won't make it again.

Simply delicious.  The only changes that I made were that I substituted olive oil for the butter, ground ginger for fresh and chicken stock for vegetable broth.  All substitutions were made based only on what I had on hand.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.....it's a keeper.

This soup was delicious! First time I made it, I only had one sweet potato and a rather old apple so I increased the carrots. The second time I had everything and it was even more delicious. Crusty bread and/or gluten-free crackers and you are good to go. Thank you for this yummy recipe.

This was great.  We didn't puree and it was nice as a stew.  We used better than bullion because we had it.  Everything else in the recipe we followed.  Served with Dave's Killer Bread and Trader Joes Creamline plain yogurt.

This recipe gets three stars. One for being a one pot wonder, one for being easy, and one because I liked the ingredients. I followed the recipe as closely as I could: didn't have fresh ginger or lentils. I substituted powdered ginger and used 1/2 cup barley. I mashed instead of pureed. Still I found it rather bland. At the very end I added a bit of thyme and sage, and poured the soup over left over diced ham. Eh. Still needs something.

Just made this soup for the first time and I must say that is it one of the most delicious soups I have made.  I followed the recipe except for substituting ground ginger.  I didn't bother to return to the stove once I pureed it and it was perfect.  A real keeper!

I found this recipe searching for a healthy soup to cook for Thanksgiving lunch.  OMG! this was awesome.  Easy to prepare and the taste was just superb.  It has a sweet flavor with a kick.  Just love it and my guests did also.  My favorite foods are soups and this will become a staple in my recipe book.

This is a delicious dish I've made again and again. It's really pretty simple to make, though the complex flavors have my husband coming back for more every time. I always double the recipe to have enough to last a couple days or freeze.

I was worried this would be boring with so many vegetables, but was I ever wrong! The basic combination of flavors and the way they are cooked gives a delicious flavor and texture. I roughly halved/three-quartered the recipe, skipped the cayenne and yogurt, and at the end of simmering stirred in a cooked crumbled Italian sausage. Delicious, comforting, and very easy!

This soup is delicious!! My friends and I have made it together for three years in a row.  It is amazing.  You don't have to completely puree it completely, but it's surprisingly good if you do.

I made this for baby shower luncheon for a vegetarian friend. It was a huge hit. I couldn't find red lentils, so I just used brown. I also added an extra apple. Yummy.

I made this soup in my crock pot and thought it turned out great!  Like other reviewers, I used the EEVO instead of butter, dried ginger instead of fresh ginger and low sodium veg broth.  I didn't have 2 sweet potatoes on hand, so I used one yam and 1/2 a butternut squash.   I liked the texture of the soup as cooked so I only pureed 1/4 and added it back to the soup.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this soup for my dairy allergic 2-yr old and he loved it. Just substituted butter for dairy-free alternative and didn't use yogurt garnish. I'd prefer more spice to liven up the natural sweetness of the veggies. I think next time I'd easily double the cumin, ginger and pepper. Great smooth texture, filling and satisfying.

Delicious!  I happened to have everything but the red lentils, I used green lentils instead.  I also used a mixture of broth that I threw in.  I love using up ingredients in the fridge.  This soup turned out wonderful.  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe! Changed a few things to what I had available and it came out marvelous. Currently living over seas and had to sub the sweet potatoes with taro root - works surprisingly well. Also we had beef stock instead of veg stock and it gave the soup a heartier taste. Pumped up the curry powder / pepper to give it a little kick. Added a touch of honey (use conservatively since the apples are sweet as well). Decided against the yogurt since the beef stock gave it a different tone. Even after I mangled the recipe it blew us away! My partner and I had to stop ourselves from eating the leftovers! Will definitely make again.

I love this soup! I also added a parsnip and only had one sweet potato, but it was still delicious. I have had leftovers for a few days and have even used it as a pasta sauce with some shredded mozzarella on top.

This soup is fantastic! Recommend using a strong apple (like a green Granny Smith) rather than a milder one. I also didn't puree it, but left it like a stew.

Excellent!  I used two golden delicious apples and added a bit of chicken broth (used up all my vegetable broth) at the end because it was a bit thick for my taste.  I also used the brownish/gray lentils.

Delicious!! I'm so happy I was only making it for myself and don't have to share the leftovers!  I did make a few changes, just based on what I had on hand: green lentils instead of red, chicken broth instead of vegetable, and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder instead of the fresh ginger. I'm sure the original version was just as tasty, but I was really, really pleased with how this came out.

So fantastic even the kids ate it without complaint!  Skipped the puree and served as a stew with a little leftover diced chicken sprinkled on top.  Easy, nutritious and delicious.

Excellent!  I'd give it more stars if I could because its so healthy (especially if made with olive oil, which I did).  I served it over brown rice and all five of my kids, ages 7 and under, gobbled it right up.  My 19-month-old twins, who had already eaten dinner, fought over my bowl until it was devoured.   I'm looking forward to playing with some fun variations (topping it with fried sage?  adding rosemary and garlic and a little more heat...?).

This soup was amazing.  So hearty and flavorful.  I will make this again and again.  I did make a couple changes though.  First of all, I used Beef Broth instead of vegetable because it was what I had.  Secondly, while I was pureeing the soup I noticed that the lentils tended to sink all together in the bottom of the pot.  So, after pureeing all of the other vegetables and most of the broth, instead of adding all the lentils to the food processor, I left some of them whole.  I mixed them into the pureed soup and it added a lot of texture.  My husband loved it that way.  I will probably leave even more of the lentils whole next time.  Also, my husband and 4-year-old found this soup a little spicy.  I didn't think it was at all but when I make it again I will put less chili powder to see if I can get her to eat it too!  Overall, an excellent recipe.

This is outstanding!  I made it as written.  But, added fresh spinach before serving, topped with yogurt, served with salad and whole grain bread.  Make it.  You'll love it!

I made the soup as is, except i completely forgot to add the lentils! the whole point of making this soup was to use up the 1/2 cup of of red lentils i had! dang. also i added two dashes of cayenne pepper. it was delicious.

Definite keeper. Thought I'd try it since I've had to find foods with little to no fat. Ho, hum another sweet potato, lentil recipe. Ho, hum that is until I tasted the end product. The cumin and chili powder are a great compliment to the sweet potato and apple.  I used a blender stick and left just a few chunks of potato and apple to give it a heartier texture than just a pureed blend.  As a side note, for anyone with gall bladder problems or anyone finding it difficult to eat fatty foods without pain, this is a great soup - just use a bit of olive oil in place of the butter. The seasonings aren't extremely spicy so they should be OK for most people.

Delicious! Used acorn squash instead of the sweet potato. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a few strands of saffron. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a good beginning. If you want a calmer, "comfort" soup, this is great as it is.  I like a little more zing. Next time I make it, I think I'll add a little more ginger and maybe a little more pepper. I'll serve it with a fresh, minced garlic sprinkle.  Tonight, instead of plain yogurt, we ate it with some raita left over from last night's curry. Pretty nummy. Also, if you make it thick, it's a great dip for a toddler's bread and thick enough to stay on a spoon.

This was really good.  I made some changes based on what I had onhand (no cumin, no carrots--used butternut squash instead, french lentils in place of red).  My advice is to not add the extra salt until you've tasted it just with the broth.  Mine was far too salty.  The yogurt really brings it all together.

I love the heartiness of this soup...a wonderful comfort dish!  I sauteed the veggies in oil instead of butter and would probably add some more spice next time.  It didn't have quite the "kick" I would have liked.  It reminded me of an Indian dahl, so I'm also wondering what curry powder or turmeric would do?--but since I'm a beginning cook, I may not mess with a good thing!

Delicious, quick, easy. I served it with a baguette and a bowl of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  I wouldnt change anything about the recipe.  I didnt find it necessary to add the yogurt.
