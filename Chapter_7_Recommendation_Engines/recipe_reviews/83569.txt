Im pregnant, and I crave tuna, this recipe is delicious, you have to put eggs in or it just isn't the same. I also added some sweet relish to this and gives it more flavor.

Delicious!!  I use two eggs and about 3/4 of a stalk of celery along with celery seed, salt, and pepper.  Since finding this recipe we haven't eaten just tuna salad or just egg salad sandwiches. We even use this mix for stuffed tomatos.  I sometimes add chopped sweet gerkins and just  love the simplicity of this dish.

This was the base recipe I was looking for.  I had never made a tuna sandwich....let enough hard boiled an egg.  My mom used to make them all the time growing up.  I changed up a few things though.  2 eggs was enough egg for me, 2 tablespoons of miracle whip and I replaced the celery with 1/4 cup of relish.  Tasted great.

It was a tad dry and it didn't have too much "zing" so I added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. :D

I like flavourful meals, in this case I am giving this recipe 3 stars, because I had to put more flavour in it, I added fresh parsley, green and red peppers and onion. But the main idea it's good. Thank you.

I'm very finicky about tuna, this is one of the only ways that I actually like it. Nice and simple recipe and I like the crunch with the celery.  My husband and I add a little sweet relish to ours as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have any celery, and I used 4 eggs instead of 3.  It was great for school lunch!  I would have never thought of using tuna mixed with egg!

I've had egg salad and tuna salad, but never tuna egg salad.  This is a good basic recipe, as other reviewers have said.  I also made a few changes: only used 2 eggs, added sweet relish, and some ground mustard.  The only issue I had was I didn't let the celery dry after washing it, so my salad turned out a little watery for my liking.

This recipe was pretty good, although I felt like it was missing something. Next time I might add some sweet relish and see how that turns out. Overall it was good. A good recipe to use if you want a sandwich but can't decide if you want tuna or egg salad - why not go with both! This would be a recipe that I would make myself for lunch to mix things up a bit. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

i made this early this morning so that it could get cold today while i do stuff to get my daughter ready for school tomorrow. tonight is meet the teacher so this will be easy to put together a cool dinner with. as is its good. i made it exactly to the recipe tasted it and it wasnt right and didnt  hold together welll  and so i  ended up adding another can of tuna and a  more mayo about 3 tblsp  and a big chopped garlic dill pickle and some minced onion since my daughter wont eat big chunks of raw onion and i love it in tuna. it was better. a cup of celery and only 1 tablespoon of mayo and this will barely hold together. With a few changes this could be a good five star basic tuna salad recipe.

Egg and tuna- a wonderful combination.  Good for small budgets, and you can make it with much variation.  I like it with sriracha hot chili sauce to give it a little kick!

This is my basic recipe only I usually don't add eggs which I do believe would make it better. One thing I do add is chopped black olives! Yummy!
I just LOVE to grill my sandwiches on Rye bread with a slice of Swiss or American cheese. Now THAT'S heaven!

Thanks for posting a good basic recipe.  I was making tuna salad sandwiches for a crowd.  I used  the big can of tuna, about 65 ounces, and needed help getting the proportions right.  This recipe calls for a lot of celery and I worried it would be too much but when you are making sandwiches ahead of time and don't want wilted lettuce, the celery gives the necessary crunch.

As others have said, flavors can be adjusted as desired.  I used half the eggs as that is all I had and added onion and dill pickle.

Very good base recipe to follow. I added another egg, 1 tbsp of horseradish mustard, sweet relish to taste, and a couple of tablespoons of a pico de gallo mixture (white onion, lime juice, jalapeno, roma tomatoes, and cilantro). Yum!

This was so perfect.  I made this earlier this week and I ate it everyday for lunch at school.  I had followed the directions 100%.  Very nice and refreshing.  I had added a couple dashes of hot sauce, it is a tuna habit of mine.  I love it no smelly tuna smell or taste.  PERFECT.  Thanks for the formula.

Great quick sandwich that I could throw together while juggling my morning duties. I was able to hard boil the eggs as I made breakfast, let them cool, then make the sandwich after I'd gotten the breakfast dishes done. I did increase the mayonnaise and I added a few spices to make it a little more personal (onion powder, garlic powder, dried dill weed, fresh ground pepper, Frank's Hot Sauce). This made four thin sandwiches.

Great!  This is my favorite kind of tuna salad!  I've never really liked celery, but for some reason, I love it in tuna salad!  I also added some chopped sweet pickle.  Made a wonderful summer lunch!

This brought me back to the 1970s when a roommate introduced us to tuna-egg salad sandwiches.  I don't think she followed a recipe.  I have made these sandwiches occasionally by just throwing ingredients together.  This is a good "starter" recipe--very filling--but I agree with the reviewer who described it as "bland."  I like my food on the milder side but even I think the recipe needs a little "punching up."  I followed the recipe exactly but found that the amount of mayo seemed insufficient.  I added another 1/2 Tbsp. but it still seems like it could use more to bind the ingredients together.  I was surprised there was no onion in it.  I will make it again but will definitely add onion and more mayo; if that doesn't do the trick I will continue to tinker with it.

This was a pretty good as a base. I cutted back on the eggs(used 2),added a bit of black ground pepper, some pickles (didnt have any sweet relish to the mixture, and a bit more mayo. I topped it on slices of french bread. I would probably add a bit of chedder cheese next time. It has potential.

Yes, I  didn't have celery. 
I used onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper and Greek yogurt dijon mustard. Broil on low add cheese for 3 minutes.

I make mine the same way except I don't put the salt or celery in it but sweet pickle relish and onions . Sometimes I add a slice of cheese and heat for a few seconds and you have yourself a tuna melt !

We had this growing up with sweet relish & eggs with it being  very satisfying. A tossed salad may be all that is needed to round it all out.

Yes. I didn't have celery so the green onions made up for it. And I added pepper, garlic powder a little bit of sriracha sauce and honey Dijon mustard too. The salt for me was optional. It really didn't need salt since the tuna has natural salt on it already. And I put about 2 tbsp of mayo instead of 1 since there was so much egg and tuna. But still was able to taste both without overpowering it. I just eyeballed everything to my like and taste. Love these types of recipe where I can put my own spin on it! Wish I had celery but ran out. Oh well. Can't wait to eat it. Made it the night before so I can eat it the next day for lunch. Had a little taste and it turned really good!

Fits very good but the eggs take really long to cook, also I added saracha to the mayonnaise, even so it is a really good recipe!

I will wrap mine in romaine lettuce leaf instead of bread..This is perfect for low carb..A dash of celery salt, minced onion,  mustard and tomato slice would be good too..

This is almost identical to what I make - I just also add some chopped up kosher dill and mustard.  Occasionally, I throw in some apple, too. :)  The only downside to this is that it's so delicious that I could (and occasionally do) just eat it straight with Fritos instead of putting it on some whole grain whole wheat with romaine.

I was so happy to find a basic recipe that I could follow easily.  My husband loves tuna sandwiches but he has been making them for himself.  Now I can make them for him as a surprise.

I added French's horseradish mustard to give it some kick to it. It's great as a meal because I'm not only in college, but also on my own. In other words, it's perfect budget and taste wise. Furthermore, I'm trying to maintain my weight at about 100 lbs-103 lbs. Above all, I like tuna!

I used the basis of this recipe, but changed it a bit.  I used 2 cans tuna, 2 hard boiled eggs, 1 celery stalk, paprika (instead of salt because we were out of salt), & lots of mayo (1-2T wasn't enough, too dry).  It needs a little something extra for zing, I'm just not sure what.  But the basic recipe is a good one, & I will use it again.  Simple, easy, & adding the eggs was a great idea!

this was ok. it's missing a kick, zing, zip, SOMETHING. i added dry mustard, relish, and regular mustard but that didnt do the trick for me.
