I have to say My family is a major fan of cheesy potatoes so when I stumbled across this recipe I was Ecstatic! I Love trying new recipes!!!! I did make some changes due to what I had on hand and i decided to try making this in my slow cooker:) cooked on high for 5 hours regular cubed potatoes & a mix of sharp and Velveeta cheese! They turned out DELICIOUS!! So creamy and ohhhhhh so flavorful! Next time im going to add crumbled bacon over the top!! Thank toy for sharing!
