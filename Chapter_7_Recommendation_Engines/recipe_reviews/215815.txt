I added 3/4 cup of this puree to spaghetti sauce and my family was none-the-wiser! It made the sauce turn from bright red to a little darker red, but nobody detected anything different in the color or taste of the sauce. It's a great way to incorporate an extra dose of greens into a family favorite, undetected by my not-so-green-loving kids. A great vitamin-packed puree!  I typically freeze these purees in an ice cube tray and then transfer the cubes to a freezer bag, then thaw them in glass in the fridge overnight or in the microwave.

I was having dental surgery and would have to eat soft foods.  Found this recipe while looking for something healthy that wouldn't need chewing.  This was actually very good!  I left out the peas but otherwise followed the recipe.  I topped mashed potatoes with this, but I can see it good for topping pasta.

This is a delicious recipe. I haven't made it with the ingredients called for except the broccoli. I've used broccoli, edemame, and kale. Umm!!
