This was a great way to repurpose leftover roast beef.  I chopped between 1-2 C of leftover bottom round roast in place of deli roast beef.  Everything else was as written, with white pepper in place of black pepper.  I baked it in a pie dish and it took close to an hour to set for me.  THANKS for the recipe!

I used part fat free cheddar (it’s what I had) plus some Swiss and cooked it in a cast iron skillet. Came out great. I also sautéed some baby portobello mushrooms and Vidalia onions to put on top once done. Next time I might try adding bell pepper, mushrooms, and onion in the frittata and substitute white cheddar to make it a Philly cheesesteak frittata.

I cut the recipe in half, but otherwise followed the instructions exactly.  This is an excellent recipe.  Very easy and very tasty.  I served this with a cranberry pecan quinoa salad and sliced peaches.
I made this again, using pepper jack and mozzarella.  I think it was better with cheddar, which surprises me.
