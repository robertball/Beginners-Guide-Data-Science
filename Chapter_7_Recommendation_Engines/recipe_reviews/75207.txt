This worked out GREAT!  I rubbed it on chicken quarters & grilled it.  The guys at the firehouse absolutely loved it...which was a surprise because when they saw me broiling the coffee & adding it to the mix I heard several cries of "I'm not eating that".  So, word to the wise...if you're making this for a picky eater, assemble the ingredients out of sight.

Good. Quite peppery, according to my son, but my husband and I enjoyed it. Used it on the rib-eyes.

A good rub should be a blend of ingredients that all marry to form a unique flavor all its own.   So many are kept secret for that very reason.  This was not the case here, unfortunately.  While the coffee was not apparent at all, the same can’t be said for the cumin, which was too bold. Too much pepper as well.

an outstanding rub. I used whole crushed cumin for some extra zip. I used this on a pork cut in the Philippines called "Liempo" (a pork belly cut) that resembles a giant, 10 ounce piece of bacon (though uncured). Put it on overnight, and qued it the next day. It was unreal!! My guests, (all Filipinos) could not believe how good it was, and begged me for the recipe, which I did not tell!! As they say here, "Secret!!"

We tried this tonight with pork loin steaks.  I made the rub as directed and then my husband spread some Miracle Whip on his.  He grilled them slowly (20-30 min ) with mesquite.  They were very good and not too spicy or peppery.  The one with the Miracle Whip was especially moist.  I put the leftover rub in a ziploc to use later.  Very good!

This was an interesting rub! I used it on beef for beef & broccli and it was a hit! Will make again to keep some on hand.

This was SO strange.  The flavor was great but it smelled like the candied nuts they sell at Disneyland while it was grilling.  It also had a chocolate-y flavor.  I think I put way too much rub on each steak.  I normally overdo rubs and they come out great- this one had lots of spice- save the extra for another day.  I only used 1 tsp black pepper (fine ground) and thought it was plenty.

The aroma in my kitchen during an easy preparation time was delightful. The taste was simply wonderful, will use over and over again !

Thanks for sharing.

Strong flavor, but it still manages not to overpower the meat. The crust it created was yummy!

Used this rub on a roast I slow smoked on the grill. People couldn't quite put their finger on one of the ingredients (the coffee), and they LOVED it. I will definately use this rub again.

Keep in mind to use FRESHLY GROUND coffee, not something that's already ground and sitting in your cupboard for weeks.  Otherwise the coffee won't be as effective.  I grind beans the day of grilling and put the rub on the steaks and then have them sit in the fridge for a few hours so it can marinade--I think that really helps.

Fantastic.  Interestingly, it doesn't taste so much like coffee but the coffee definitely gives it an earthy quality.  Keeper for sure.

Very good and interesting. I am going to experiment more with coffee to come up with some different combinations! We used this on porterhouse steaks. I imagine that rib-eyes would work well also. Thanks.

We loved this on our steaks! My darling man was skeptical at first but after he tasted it, he asked that we use this rub as often as possible. This is a keeper!

I tried it on steaks broiled in the oven, and wasn't impressed.  I may try it again at a later date on the grill.

The only thing I could say about this recipe even a little bad is that it's hot if you use too much.  I put it on my husband's steak pretty heavy and used less on mine.  We had strip steaks.  It was pretty overpowering  if you are sensitive to "hot", but used sparingly (or a little more), it is scrumptious.  We also had red potatoes with it, and although the heat overpowered the potatoes, they were needed to cool us down.  Have leftover rub and will make it again when I run out.

We followed the recipe exactly. The steak was a good quality cut. We wish we could concur with all these good reviews, but it is WAY too salty.  It may be a good recipe if you cut the salt back by at least half or more.  We were unable to finish our steak as a result.  I think the coffee rub recipe has promise, but with so much salt recommended, please cut back on this part of the recipe...

Tried this on grilled chicken breast. As is the recipe is flavorful but too salty. We'll either try to tone down the salt or spread the rub across more food next time. I think it will be great on pork.

I used this on a goat roast that I cooked in the oven. I wrapped the roast after rubbing the meat and stuck it in the fridge for a few hours, and the flavor was actually pretty good. Just hints here and there of coffee, and otherwise just a little bit of peppery bite, but good flavor otherwise.
