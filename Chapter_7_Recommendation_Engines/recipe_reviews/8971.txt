Good flavor and fairly easy to prepare.  I didn't have cloves, and it tasted fine.  Very "homestyle" looking.  Only thing, recipe does not provide a measurement for the potato water so be careful you don't add too much.  I think I added too much, but I took some of the water out and mixed it with a packaged chicken gravy mix and put it back into the pan.  Yummy.

needs A LOT of "spicin" up. i added different seasonings to the flour, fried it, then boiled the potato water 1st, added cloves, italian seasoning, season salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, and cajun seasoning. then i added about 1 1/2 - 2 tbs of cornstarch help thickening process then added the chicken and simmered for about 2 hours. and it came out GREAT! nice default recipe though, thanks!

This wasn't very flavorful-at least not to me.  I prefer to just fry my chicken (without a flour coating) and when it's done, add the potatoes, carrots, more seasonings and water.  DON'T remove the chicken drippings!!!  Not nice on the cholestrol but great on the tongue.

THIS RECIPE HAS SERIOUS POTENTIAL, I OPTED ALSO NOT TO FRY CHICKEN IN FLOUR, I SIMPLY BRAISED THEM IN ABOUT A CUP OF OIL IN A LARGE SAUCEPAN, THEN ADDED MY POTATOES, ONIONS, CARROTS, AND GREEN PEAS, GARLIC, BLACK PEPPER, CELERY SEEDS AND SEASON SALT FOR TASTE, AFTER A LITTLE DOCTORING UP,IT WAS A FAMILY FAVE, THE CLOVES ARE NICE.

Very easy recipe. I scaled it for 2 people and used 1 cup of the water from the potatoes (adding 1/4 cup at a time) and mixed it with a couple tablespoons of the left over seasoned flour and the chicken drippings. Once the gravy turned, I just put the potatoes and chicken in and stirred.

We loved this recipe!  My whole family loved it and will make it again.  Instead of waiting for it to thicken I just added a little flour to the potato juice to thicken it quicker.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was quite good.  It reminded me of downhome farm cooking.  It would be really good with new potatoes.

I added sliced carrots and frozen corn to this concoction and used enought flour to thicken everything up so it sort of gelled together.  For those who wondered how much potato water to save and use, 2 1/2 cups is plenty.  I think the recipe would be quite plain w/o the added veggies. With them it's delicious - it's a southern stew thick enough to eat on a plate with a fork.  Thanks!

Good flavor.  I used the small new red potatoes and added a little garlic powder.  I will make it again.  It was very easy.

Big advantage.... it is easy to prepare.   Tastes good with the following additions.   1.  skin the chicken. 2.  coat with flour in which paprika, garlic salt and pepper have been added. 3.  To thicken it a bit at the end, add some flour and water to the gravy.  The three cloves of garlic are JUST RIGHT.

I don't know what I did wrong but the gravy never thickened.  Perhaps I used to much potato water.  The recipe is not very specific to amounts.

I loved this recipe, I am German and this reminded me of grandma's kitchen.  Thank you for sharing.  For a little extra taste I added some chicken stock to the water before adding it to the chicken and potatoes and also threw in some chopped green onions to the chicken while it was frying for some extra color and taste. Delicious!!!

Tried this last night. It was very delicious , I didnt use the cloves and it still turned out very well. I think I let it simmer to much or I didnt use enough potatoe water, cause my gravy was a little on the thick side But all in all very good. I will make this again.

Was pretty good stuff.  I used all the potatoe water, added additional seasonings and flour to taste (definately needed), and let it simmer til it had the consistency wanted.  Good comfort food.
