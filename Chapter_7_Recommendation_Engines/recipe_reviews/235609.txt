So delicious. As our family is trying to get away from processed foods, I did use homemade alfredo sauce rather than a jar. (The recipe was from this site also, and didn't add much to the prep time) Even my picky eaters asked for more! I also used bowtie pasta instead of alfredo noodles because I had them on hand, and it made for a fun looking dish. :) This is a new dish to add to our rotation. THANKS!

I added a 1/2 cup of white wine and 3 garlic cloves (chopped), and a tablespoon of pesto just for added zip.  Wonderful!  (Be sure to cook the chicken until browned.)

This is a total winner in my house! I did substitute the alfredo sauce with a lower fat alfredo and it was absolutely amazing! I'm thinking of adding broccoli to the dish next time. This dish actually got my husband to eat spinach!!
