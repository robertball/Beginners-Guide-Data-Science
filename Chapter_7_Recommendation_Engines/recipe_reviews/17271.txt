This recipe couldn't have been easier.  I used a ready to bake french loaf dough from the store instead of the frozen bread dough the recipe asks for.  It was delicious.  Instead of using the bundt cake pan, I used mini-tart pans...making a lot of mini-garlic bread rings.  10 minutes of prep time and 20 minutes of cooking time later, I was king of the household.

Try it, you'll love it!

This was so good and easy to make. I let it rise in the bundt pan for over an hour and I had to cover it with foil, so the top would not burn. It turned out delicious, and there was not one piece left over. YUMMY!

It took a while for the bread to rise, but when it finally did, these came out so fluffy and light!!  The taste was a little bland though, I would add a little more seasoning.

Very tasty!!  I love having fresh bread with dinner, and this recipe hit the spot!  Crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside, with a yummy garlic flavour.  Next time I might even sprinkle some shredded cheddar in the last baking moments.  Yum!

AWESOME!!!!! First, I used the frozen dinner rolls (the ones that you have to let rise and all). Second, I didn't need nearly as much butter mix as the recipe calls for...I had ALOT leftover after dipping. Finally, only had to bake for apprx 15-20min at most. The result was very good, very fluffy and oh yeah...soooo easy. Will make these again and again!! Thanks Debbie!!

Great bread!  It was so quick and easy to make.  I only used 1/2 cup of butter and I thought it was plenty.  I divided the dough into about 2 dozen golf ball sized pieces and spooned the remaining liquid over all.  The smaller you make the pieces, the more flavor will be marbled throughout the bread.  That might help with some complaints of this being bland.

This one went over VERY well at my family dinner, it didnt last long. I don't have a bunt cake pan so i used a stoneware round pan and it was fine. I also used whole wheat dough to make it a little more nutritious and it was delicious!!

If I could give this more stars, I would!  The only thing I did different was add a bit more garlic powder and about 5-10 minutes before it was done, basted the top with left over dipping mix.  FABULOUS!!!

Yes - this was delish...however...I wish I didn't follow the other reviewers suggestions to reduce the butter to 1/2 c.  I say stick with the original recipe - if you are going to change anything maybe increase the garlic a bit.  This was easy, yummy and looked great too.

If I could give this one 10 stars....believe me I would. It was wonderful! A huge hit with the family. Hubby said that he could have just eaten that for dinner....smiles. He asked me....did you by any chance make another one? My little one kept saying...mommy...this is just too good. He and hubby battled for the last piece  :) The only thing I added....was not actually to the recipe but I put it on the side and that was....taking a small desert size dish and adding some balsamic vinegar and a touch of olive oil with some added spices and we dipped the bread in it. This is kind of the way that they did it in a great italian restaurant back in Florida. Try it....with this fabulous bread and you will be hooked too. Needless to say....I am making another one tonight! Thank you Debbie for a true winner!!!

This has to be the most awesome form of garlic bread I've ever had!  The best part about it was that I put the leftover bread in the fridge and heated it up one-three days later and it still tasted awesome!  It didn't get soggy or dried-out!

I scales down the recipe for 9 rolls and found out I should have made the full batch!!  The boys AND my husband gobbled them up before they even ate threst of their dinner!!

I took the frozen dough, let it rise for 3 hours, then added the topping and let it rise another hour.  It made the rolls super fluffy!! 

 Also, I let them set for at least 15 minutes after taking them out of the oven so that the bottom rolls keep the good stuff on the bottom and not on the pan.  Great rolls!!!

Dripped out of bundt pan and fire alarms going off but it was still really good. Would totally serve at a party or spaghetti dinner. Fun change from garlic bread. Easy to make, way too much butter mixture though.

I modified this recipe, using the suggestions of other reviewers.  I ditched the egg, and used only 1/2 cup of butter.  I also added about a teaspoon of fresh( well, bottled) minced garlic and also some dried chives in place of the parsley. I did have trouble with my frozen bread dough - it just wouldn't rise very much.  I have no doubt that if I could get my hands on some better bread dough then this would have been better.  Next time I will make some dough in the bread machine.  My young son really liked making this recipe with me, and it really didn't take very long. I will try this one again before giving up on it.  This would be good with pasta.

YUMMY!  I used fresh, pressed garlic instead of the garlic powder.  We really enjoyed this!  The bread did reheat well in the toaster oven.  Thanks!  This recipe is definitely a keeper in our house!

Tasted great and good presentation. Mine didn't rise at all it seemed in the 45 min. But still tasted good. Not very good as leftovers though.

Very tasty!!  I made garlic bread dough in my bread machine and added fresh, crushed garlic to the melted butter mixture(we love garlic!).  Not sure what purpose the egg serves, next time I will make it without......  Didn't like the cooked egg mixed in with the bread.  Otherwise, a keeper!

excellent taste and texture.  I used the remaining dip mixture and poured on top, shook up the balls and everything coated fine.  So different! I will make this again.

This went great with spaghetti.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with all of the extra butter mixture, so I poured it into the bundt pan (before baking), and was somewhat nervous as to what that may bring, but sure enough...it all absorbed into the crust and was really great.  I didn't realize that after it is put into the bundt pan it needs to "rise again" & really didn't have the time to let it, so I winged it baking it anyway and it was fine.  Next time I will use minced garlic, & homemade bread.  Thanks Debbie!

Wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.  There was WAY too much of the garlic mixture, don't make so much b/c you will be wasting good ingredients. Try making half of what it calls for. Probably will not make again.

What can I say?...Absolutely AMAZING!  This bread was so good, we couldn't stop eating it...even after we were stuffed!  Previous reviews were right, it does make a lot a butter sauce, but I used the extra to baste as it cooked.  I thawed 2 loaves, so I baked one as a whole loaf and basted the entire outside of the bread before placing in the pan, as well as basted this one as it cooked.  I had to cover with foil towards the end of the baking time to keep it from getting too dark, but that's typical when baking bread or anything with a crust.  This was a complete hit in our household, and probably the easiest, yummiest thing I've ever made!  Can't wait to make more!  And can't wait to post the picture I have of my wonderful bread!

I only had about 1/2 loaf of frozen bread dough to use (used the other half for a different recipe) so I did not use the tube pan.  I used a pie plate and placed a pam-coated glass custard cup upside down to create the circle.  I used kitchen shears to cut about 1 1/2 inch sections and slightly rolled into balls.  These were smaller than your average rolls but tasted great!

Everyone asks for this very easy recipe! I used frozen roll dough then put it in the fridge overnight. I just piled up the rolls in a tube pan and poured the extra butter over the top. It sat out for about an hour before it was doubled. I did use real butter and skipped the salt. Yummy!

Super recipe! Instead of buying dough I make it in my bread maker. I use the same recipe as I would for white bread only I use the Dough setting. When the dough is "done" I just tear pieces off and dip. Makes a great bread to go with stuffed shells or any italian dish! Thanks!!

It's a neat idea, but the effect just isn't reached. I do like the space in the middle for a marinara bowl in entertaining purposes. I made this recipe twice. The second time I refrigerated the liquid and spooned it throughout the bread which made it much better. Too much butter though...

This was good and fun for a change, but not spectacular.  The butter mixture was way too much and the egg probably unneccessary.

I also though that this bread did not have a lot of flavor.  I wish I would have taken other peoples advice and used less butter because there was a lot of the mixture leftover.  I probably would not make this again.

We loved this in all its buttery, garlicky splendor, and so does everyone we've served it to!  My hubby has dubbed it "Monkey Breath Bread," because it really does have a LOT of garlic.  I made it with 2 loaves of frozen bread dough, and added 1/2 teaspoon each of basil, thyme, and oregano.  It was GREAT!!

This was so tasty. I made it using the Cheese Herb Bread from this site. Snipped chives tossed in and doubled the cheese.........Yummy! Try starting the dough in your bread machine. The store-bought frozen dough doesn't have the flavor that homemade breads have.This is a keeper, Debbie. Thanks.

My four kids are resposible for helping to plan and make a meal once each week.  This was their bread choice for last Saturday nights dinner.  Well the 4 year old was given this task.  She did a wonderful job!!  She was able to help measure and rolled and dipped all on her own.  All the kids as well as myself and my husband really enjoyed this bread.  Thank you !

I just made these, and they are absolutely delicious! I made two small changes. After reading a lot of reviews saying these needed more seasoning, I added a teaspoon and a half of salt, and one tablespoon of garlic powder. First of all the extra salt was too much. For my preference I think the one teaspoon might even be too much. The 1/4 cup of parm cheese already adds enough salt. So the next time I make these I will only add half a teaspoon of salt. The garlic powder was good but next time I will use fresh minced garlic. Other than these two changes, I followed the recipe exactly. Some reviews also stated that there was a lot of extra sauce left over. The extra I just poured over the rolls about five minutes before I took them out of the oven, and they browned up nicely. These will be nice for Holiday guests. This recipe is a keeper!

This was really good and really easy.  I agree with other reviewers though, that the amount of butter needs to be reduced to maybe 1/2 cup.  I had enough butter mixture left over to make another batch, and I even put extra on top.  I used store brand frozen bread dough.  I am definitely adding this to my favorites!

What a fun and tasty recipe! I used 2 rolls of Pillsbury biscuits instead and had my 3 year old help me make the pieces into balls and drop them in the butter mixture which he thought was great fun. In the future, I would make only 1/2 the butter mixture - there is much more than can be used. My dough was swimming in it in the pan so I was a bit worried but it incorporated nicely. If you use the Pillsbury dough, you don't need to let it rise and it bakes beautifully in just 20 min. Really quick and easy!

We made the bread dough in the bread machine ourselves instead of using frozen...yet it was still really yummy. Garlicky enough, and definitely not for the faint of heart, although, it is quite good with pasta.

I'm rating this a 5 for the garlic butter mixture.  I had to modify the recipe slightly since I don't own any fluted pans, but I liked the idea of garlic "bubbles" so I used a muffin pan. I rolled the dough into 12 balls and coated them in the garlic butter mixture, then put an extra spoonfull (enough to cover the bottom) in each depression in the pan.  After rising I baked them for 20 minutes.  I did screw up though and forgot to add the parsley to the mixture, so I put a sprinkle on top of each "muffin" before baking.  I served them alongside "Bob's Awesome Lasagna" from this site.

Yum yum!  I followed this recipe fairly closely.  The main change I made was to use butter instead of margarine.  I also decreased the amount of butter and salt slightly and increased the garlic and parsley slightly.  It was quite tasty.  My only complaint is that it was too buttery.  I used 1 and a quarter sticks of butter.  Unless I'm converting wrong, 3/4 cups should be a stick and half.  I'd say a half cup of butter is even too much.  If you use salted butter, a 1/2 teas. of salt is enough.  I think in the future I'll follow other reviewers suggestions of using minced garlic rather than garlic powder.   Also, my supermarket didn't have any frozen bread dough so I used their fresh pizza dough.  It was good, but I think the regular bread dough would be better.  Wow, it seems like I have a lot of notes about this recipe, but I don't mean it to be negative.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it!  Thanks!

Oh my. . .what a treat!!!  I did use chopped garlic from a jar (and lots of it) instead of garlic powder.  Very easy, and the taste is incredible.  Best eaten while still warm, however.

This was easy and great! I made my own bread dough using the recipe from my Kitchen Aid mixer (French Bread)enough for two loaves (or bubble rings) - Instead of the parsley I used Italian Seasoning. I doubled all the dipping ingredients except for the butter and I still had some left over - husband LOVED it - kids loved it too and thought it was fun to eat (being able to pull it apart). If you're using a two piece bundt pan don't forget to put a drip pan underneath it. Will definately make again!

This recipe definitely called for too much butter mixture. I only used about 1/2. It didn't raise much in the pan, but baked up beautifully. All in all, a very tasty recipe. I will make again.

My husband and I tried this. The bread turned out chewy and way to dense.  I am not sure what went wrong but I think it was the pre made dough.  I will stick to making my own dough rather than follow a recipe with frozen dough.

Wow! What a find this recipe is! Made it last night in a fluted Bundt pan. I thought that the fluting would make the rolls look odd, but once they puffed up nice and light, it made no difference at all. I'm fond of making my own yeast rolls and other breads from scratch, but often there isn't time, and for those days this is the perfect recipe. I followed it exactly, though I was liberal with the cheese and parsley. Also, so many reviewers suggested chopped fresh garlic instead of garlic powder that I decided to do that too--I always keep a jar of chopped garlic in the frig. I threw an entire tablespoon of it into the mix, also based on reviews. You can buy white bread in loaves or rolls (little balls). The balls speed up this recipe even more; 12 balls of dough roughly equal one pound, which makes measuring very easy. I didn't even wait for the dough to rise. I threw the 12 rock-hard balls into the Bundt pan and mixed up the butter and cheese mixture all into the balls. Sprinkled a little more cheese and parsley on top because several reviewers said the bread needed more seasoning. I let them rise an hour in a warm oven. My family LOVED these rolls. They were truly delicious, pretty, well seasoned, more interesting than plain rolls, quick to make, and don't mess up my kitchen like making rolls from scratch does. Oh, they took only 20 minutes to brown perfectly. There isn't a doubt in my mind that I'll be making these fabulous rolls again and again. Highly recommend.

Enjoyed this recipe. It only took a little over half of the listed baking time, however. Also, there's a lot of extra dipping sauce when you're done. I'll do this recipe again, but I'll reduce the amount of dipping sauce I make to reduce waste.

Was very good. However, had tons of butter mixture left over, could have cut in half. I put the butter in the fridge and will use it again on another loaf. Also, need to double the garlic and cheese.

after reading all of the reviews and a little help from the exchange this is what i did to make ahead- used my bread machine to make the dough (best bread machine bread from this site), used 1/2 c melted butter, skipped the egg, and halved the amount of salt. i divided the dough into 24 pieces and rolled into balls. i nuked the butter mixture and rolled the dough balls in it. mine didnt rise very much until the baking part. i poured the remaining butter on top and  underbaked about 20 mins. then i let sit and cool to room temp. i placed in a freezer bag for the weekend. i pulled it out sat morning to thaw and baked about 15 mins on a cookie sheet. great w/ lasagna

WOW my family is obsessed with this recipe. it takes plain frozen white bread dough and turns it into something just fantastic. however, the butter mixture makes a lot and there is always tons left over when i am done. i also dont think that enough bread is used in one pan. i usually use about 1 1/2 lbs of dough in each bundt. this bread keeps really well too, so i usually make a couple pans at a time. great for snacking on and as dinner rolls.

Love the concept & ease of making. I rolled the balls small, a little bigger than marble size, but there still wasn't a lot of flavor. Definately need to serve w/some type of dipping sauce(butter & herb or marinara).

I loooooooooove this stuff.  I don't think I'll ever buy frozen garlic bread again.  Super Easy!!  I used Rhodes brand frozen bread, let it thaw about 6-7 hours in the fridge.  I don't have a bundt pan, so I used a 9" round cake pan.  The directions didn't say what size to make the balls so I made them about the size of a walnut.  The only thing I'll do different next time is to use less margarine (1/2 C at most) and to put a thin layer of it in the bottom of the pan.

Next time I will only use 1/2 cup butter.  Didn't have a bundt pan so I used a regular pan and they came out great.  I also used chopped  fresh garlic and added more parsley on the top for color before baking.  These rolls are addicting -- be careful!

I love this recipe.  I am sure to goup the balls up really well in the butter mixture.  When I am done, I take any of the left over butter and pour it over the top before baking. I use minced garlic for my family, but use the powder for large groups as many claim to be garlic "lovers" but really just like a hint.

This was great bread! The only thing I changed was the amount of butter I used -3/4 cup is way too much - so I cut it down to 1/4 cup and used about 5 or 6 cloves of garlic - otherwise its great,easy bread to make!

The fist time I made this I used the egg and it stuck to the pan.  I just made it again, using my own whole wheat bread recipe and no egg and it is a thing of beauty....tastes great too.  I used real garlic, and basil, oregano and parsley.

This was great!  I did make a few changes though.  You definitely need to reduce the amount of butter, as there is far too much called for in this recipe.  I added some additional garlic and also used oregano in the butter mixture and I left the egg out altogether.  My bread dough did not rise much, even after three hours, but it baked up beautifully anyway.   My husband just loved this and now requests it all the time!  I used a silicone bundt pan and they turned out great, came right out of the pan!  You won't be sorry if you try this one!

I love bread, and this turned out great.  The only thing I have to say is that you don't need as much butter as the recipe calls for.  I love butter, so I took all the butter I had left over and poured it over the bread and it was delicious, but just a little too buttery--I would recommend using only 1/2 cup of butter instead of 3/4.  And if you aren't planning on pouring the butter over the bread before you bake it then you should use even less butter than that.

I only used 1/2 cup of butter and that was still plenty.  I am not sure what the purpose of the egg was.  I don't think the end result was worth the effort or cost of ingredients.  I don't think I will make this again.

These were good, but I thought they were kind of greasy.  I think next time I'll reduce the amount of margarine to 1/2 cup.  My husband and sons really liked it.  It would be easy to modify this recipe to make cinnamon rolls....doesn't that sound yummy?

This is supposed to be a take on monkey bread, not sure what the other pictures show.  Very simple when you don't feel like making biscuits, forgot pre-made bread at the store and you have a couple frozen bread doughs in the freezer.

Don't make this with the pop,and fresh bread dough. It won't rise. I used fresh garlic, 1/2 cup of butter and fresh basil. Whipped in the egg and parm, then dredged the balls.  I added the left over "sauce" to the pan. Came out VERY tasty and crisp on the outside.  I'll make again with the proper bread.

This bread is AWESOME!  I added fresh, pressed garlic.  There was just enough flavor on the outside and bread on the inside so that it wasn't overpowering.   There was definitely enough "batter" to coat 2 lbs of dough.  Quick, easy & delicious!

YUM!  I made this in the "monkey bread" style, using smalled "balls" of dough in two rings around the pan.  My husband and I ate half the loaf for dinner.  I made this as directed, using just one stick of butter... it was more than enough to coat the little dough balls.  I've FOUND my solution for Texas toast.  We're making one of these every few days from now on!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Very yummy! I made fresh bread dough in the bread machine, then made lots of little balls of dough to dip in the butter mixture.  (More surface areas for coating!) I even used less butter (1/2 C) and still everyone loved it.

Just ok- I feel like I poured 2/3 of the margarine mixture down the drain....could have used alot less. After reading reviews about blandness, I added 1 tsp. Of Italian seasoning... I would prefer a slice of garlic toast next time.

I made a few changes based on remarks from other reviewers. I cut way back on the butter and added a lot more garlic & parmesan, and it turned out fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I just wish I would have added MUCH more garlic, as I felt the flavor was seriously lacking.  Used the Pillow Soft Roll recipe from this site and baked them in a 9 x 13 pan because I didn't have access to a bundt.  Also used fresh grated parmiggano regiano and it was a nice touch.

This recipe was delicious, and so simple!  I made the recipe to appear like the picture- with about 8 dough balls, however, the next time I make it, I will make the dough balls smaller- maybe similar to monkey bread- to better distribute the garlic/butter flavor.  This is definetly a keeper!

Twas very quick and easy, though not quite as garlicky as I was hoping for.  Next time I'll probably use garlic salt and the garlic powder.  My kids ate it up as is, though!

This has a LOT of the butter mixture.  Although, to be fair, I just realized I probably used more like a half a pound of bread dough instead of one pound.  However, I think it would be too much for one pound as well.  I thought about pouring the excess over the top of the rolls but didn't; was afraid would be too greasy.  The garlic taste is mild for me, so I would use more garlic next time.  However, I LOVE garlic and the more the better in my opinion.  I used my own French bread dough I had made in my bread machine, and I did use a bundt pan.  Made a nice circle in the pan after it rose.  Thanks!

Quite possibly the best bread I ever tasted!  I served it at a dinner party and everyone raved.  I used 8" cake pans and formed the balls smaller than what's in the picture.  I didn't need as much butter as the recipe called for, and I also didn't taste much of the garlic so if you want a really garlicky taste, try adding more.

Simple and easy. I thawed two pounds of bread and made 8 balls from each and I still had plenty of butter sauce left over.  We used real butter instead of margarine and it seemed to crisp the outter coating of the bread (margarine may have the same effect). 

I was trying to make a monkey style bread. We ended up with one bundt pan bubble ring and a 9in round cake pan "loaf" with the two pounds of dough.

Delicious! I used a stick (half cup) of butter, and it was PLENTY - and I'm a butter lover. Poured the extra butter mixture on top once the buns had risen. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I just used an 8x8 dish. Worked fine. Had to cover with tin foil part way through baking to prevent burning the top, though!

I'm only giving this one 4 stars instead of 5 because of a couple of changes I had to make. First, 3/4 cup of butter is WAY TOO MUCH... I used 1/2 cup and even that was a bit much. Also, excuse me, but no self respecting lover of garlic would ever use garlic powder over the real thing! It only takes a couple of minutes to chop up some garlic cloves!!! I used 4 or 5 cloves and it was perfect. Over all, this is a good recipe. Great flavor and easy to prepare.

This is awesome! My family loved it! I noticed some reviews stating it called for too much butter. So when making it for the first time, I used my 10-inch bundt pan with 1/2 cup of butter. It was perfect. The bread soaked up any excess butter, but was not soggy. Also, I grated fresh parmesan/pecorino romano cheeses into the mix. This combined with the butter and created a wonderful cheesey crust that everyone was fighting for! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe!  I spiced it up a bit though, added chicken broth seasoning and some italian dressing (I get creative. lol).  I overdid the oil a little, but it didn't deter from the taste.  I used a bread dough recipe from the site which ended up being too sweet, even with that, the garlic bread came out nice.

Okay, I REALLY messed with this recipe. :) I used three small cans of refrigerated biscuits (10 per can). I used ½ cup of margarine, maybe 1½ tsp of garlic powder, between 1/8 and 1/4 tsp of salt, and around 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. No egg, no cheese, although the Parmesan might be nice. I melted the butter and mixed in the salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. I dipped the individual biscuits in the mixture and placed them all around in a greased bundt pan, layering them until I ran out. I baked them in a 375 degree oven for around 35 minutes until golden on top and cooked in the middle (I poked the biscuits in the middle of the pan to check the doneness). They were browning on top too fast so I had to tent them with foil for the last ten minutes or so. They were golden on top and on the bottom (when flipped out of the pan onto a plate) and very tasty. Thanks, Debbie, for a good idea. :)

This was easy and had a nice garlic flavor.  I did others suggested and put the remainder of the butter on top.  Next time I will use fresh garlic and maybe add some parmesan chesse to the butter mixture for a different twist.

Everyone at my Christmas dinner table raved about this bread.  I did double the amount of bread dough which fit in my bundt pan.  I just baked it a little longer.  My husband and sons were fighting over the leftovers the next day.  Will make again.

I used a frozen bread load which I thawed.  My dough didn't rise much at all, after several hours.  I baked them anyway.   They were okay, needless to say a little heavy.  I also thought way, way too much butter, had tons of dipping stuff left over.  Probably won't make again.
