Fabulous. I found the flavour of the glaze wonderful but it was very thin. To avoid having to baste it constantly, I reduced the baste in a saucepan over medium heat until it thickened. I ended up with a glaze that went on and stayed on. One additional application of the glaze mid-way through cooking was all that was required. Also, if you've got the time, the pork can be made fabulously moist by setting the oven temperature at only 180 F. It will take about 3.5 hours for the internal temperature of the roast to reach 160 F (at which point its perfectly cooked), but it's worth it.

This is fabulous, I've made it several times, it usually takes around 2 hours in the oven.  The 2nd time I made it, I ran out of real maple syrup, so used 1/2 c real, 1/2 c pancake syrup and it was very sweet, so I added about 1 tablespoon of tabasco sauce.  Oh baby, it remained sweet but had a subtle kick, I have since added tabasco every time I've made it, even though I use only real maple syrup, really keeps it from being overpoweringly sweet.  The other thing I've done is to add in two loaf pans filled with carrots, onions, potatoes, and yams (cut into 1" chunks).  I then made up another batch of the glaze and dumped 1/2 over each pan stirred to coat evenly and covered with foil, I stirred them when before serving.  It was a heavenly companion to the roast.  I cook it in a round glass pan that barely fits the roast, this keeps the glaze from being just a burnt on goop at the end of cooking, so I have some glaze remaining to drizzle over the slices.

This was very easy to put together -a major plus for me.  I opted to go the route of the crock pot as one of the other reviewers mentioned and it was fantastic.  I simply placed the roast in the crock pot, poured the mixed ingredients on top, and let it cook on high for about 4 hours.  
I also used pure maple syrup and it was perfect.  I would suggest you make sure you're not using "maple flavored pancake syrup" if you want this to come out right.

WOW! This is absolutely wonderful. I had a 5# loin so I doubled the recipe, this made more than enough. I covered the bottom of the crock pot with glaze. Then dusted the loin on both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion granules. Placed the loin in the crock pot and then covered with the remaining glaze. Then when I returned home from church I ladled some of the glaze off and reduced it to make a gravy. I served this with mashed potatoes, corn and green beans. Delicious gravy! The pork came out very tender. Total time in the crockpot on high was 4.5 hours and there was not a hint of pink. Also, the maple syrup gave the loin a beautiful golden look without having to brown it first. I made the glaze the night before, placed in the fridge, so all I had to do before church was throw everything in the crock pot together, so easy! I made the glaze exactly to recipe and wouldn't change a thing! This is definitely going to be a keeper in our house; I can't wait to make this for company!

Fabulous combination.  I browned it in a pan with a little salt and pepper, then put everything into a crockpot on low for 8 hours.  My family loved it!  Came out tender as could be.
I've made it a number of times and each time it has turned out the same: FABULOUS.   

I have also tried this recipe in a loaf pan (helps keep the juice from burning)with pork tenderloins in the oven.  Once again, Fabulous.  I did baste it every 10-15 minutes and turned it over half way thru.  Lovely.  Really.

The first time, I made this recipe as-is, and it was delicious!!  The second time, I upped the oven temp to 425 for the first 30 minutes, then backed it down to 375 until  the internal temp was 160.  Doing this crusted the outside and sealed in the juices better.  This  one is a cold-weather favorite!

This was delicious!  My roast actually took 2 hours to cook completely.  I would recommend basting the meat with the juices every 15-20 minutes.

This is absolutely FABULOUS and SO EASY even non-cooks will be able to impress with this one! Yummy pork and even yummier glaze! ! I am a personal chef and have made plenty of recipes, but this one is a 5 star winner.  I used salt, pepper, minced garlic and sage to season the roast before browning and it imparted a wonderful flavor to the meat.  One tip I would offer to those who reviewed this recipe earlier and said the glaze did not "stick" to the meat, try patting the pork dry before pouring the glaze over the top.   This recipe had everyone asking for more!

I thought this recipe was great!! It is very easy to throw together & put in the crock pot. The glaze could be too sweet if you use maple flavored pancake syrup instead of real maple syrup. I only have the real maple syrup, so I thought it had an exceptional flavor--also the crockpot mellows flavors more than the oven baking.

This was an absolutly wonderful recipe.  My husband loved it and he usually doesn't care for sauces or glazes. I put only half the glaze on the roast at first and then basted it with the other half and it turn out great!

I have to say, this is the very first review I have written on this site, even though I have a couple recipes on here myself.  I had a 4+ pound pork loin in the fridge and saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I doubled the glaze because I had a larger pork roast and I decided to mix it in a saucepan and reduce it to thicken it up because I knew I was going to put it in the crock pot.  I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder.  I poured the glaze mixture over the roast in the crock pot and put the crock pot on low and cooked it slow for about 8 hours, occasionally basting it with the crock pot juices using a turkey baster.  When it was done, I sliced it about an inch thick and used the juices from the crock pot to pour into little dipping sauce cups.  Dipped each bite into the dipping sauce and I must say that this recipe is actually very, very good.  Simple, yet tasty.  I (personally) wouldn't do this in the oven, just because pork is so lean and dries out too quickly.  Had I not used the broth in the crock as a dipping sauce, I think it wouldn't be quite as good (simply because this cut of pork tends to be dry).  I will keep this one for future use for sure.  Very nice flavor.  Thanks for posting this!  Good job!  :)

This was delicious and smelled wonderful cooking as well.  Just one housekeeping note:  line your pan with aluminum foil...the syrup cooks down and sticks like the devil to the pan!

This pork roast recipe is a much simpler version of another maple/vinegar/mustard pork recipe.  I added my favorite part from the old recipe and it makes this roast perfect---simply rub the roast with around 2 teaspoons of sage and brown it on all sides in a little butter on the stovetop, then place the meat in a roasting pan.  Add the glaze ingredients to the pan you browned the meat in and bring just barely to a simmer, making sure you loosen any browned bits that had remained in the pan.  Then pour about 2/3 of the glaze over the roast and pop it in the oven.  When the roast is done u can add whatever glaze remains in the roasting pan to whatever you had left on the stove and bring it to a boil til it reaches a good "gravy" consistency and serve it on the side with the meat.

To keep things simple, I opted to go the crock pot route, slicing the roast in half lengthwise, then seasoning the roast (no spice in the sauce) with a combination of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper in even amounts, then from experience, placed the roast so it covered the bottom of the slow cooker and was immersed in the glaze -- not needing to turn it during the cooking.  I used very good maple syrup as many reviewers insisted made all the difference but reduced the amount to 2/3 cup.  Put in tbsp of Frank's hot sauce as some suggested and topped the roast with 2 cups of pearl onions and 4 cups of sliced carrots.  After about 7 hours I sliced the roast and served with the vegetables on the side, which turned out to be a perfect amount to serve 6.  Glaze was super thin and I wasn't in the mood to thicken for a gravy as a hot liquid needs some care...so I followed my intuition and reduced the glaze.  Wow!  Just a few minutes at a rolling boil and the watery glaze became thick and glossy!  EASY and a gorgeous finish.  I literally put this in the crock pot without touching it again until I served it with the reduction and veggies on the side.  I think I read EVERY review but didn't see this exact process.  I think my husband liked the meal better than I did -- he said the reduction was excellent and the veggies weren't 'killed' by the long cooking time.  I think I'll use Sriracha next time for a little more zing to balance the sweetness.  Great recipe!

Turned out great! Made in the slow cooker, used pork tenderloin, halved the sauce and added some cornstarch and some red pepper flakes too!

I used this sauce when cooking Pork Ribs.  OMG it was amazing.    the only things I did to the sauce was to reduce it to get it thicken & added some Tabasco sauce for kick.   I put it on the ribs for the last 45 min in the oven and they were fabulous -- even better the next day.  Thank you!

Great Flavor! The family loved it! Like many others, I chose to cook it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours, and then put it in the oven to roast. I came out with an incredible tender inside, and a nice roasted outside.

This recipe was great and very easy to throw together! My family really liked it but I found it just a tad too sweet and I'll likely reduce the amount of pure maple syrup down just a bit for future meals, as I will definitely be making this again! I pressed dried crumbled sage onto the pork roast and added 1 pressed clove of garlic as others have suggested and the smell while it simmered in the crockpot(another reviewer suggestion) on low for 4 1/2 hours was mouthwatering! I skimmed the fat and added 1/4 cup of instant potato flakes, letting it cook for another 15 minutes or so to thicken the liquid into a gravy. Yum!

I had to feed about 16 adults so I roasted almost a 6lbs of center cut boneless pork roast. I cooked it about 25 minutes per pound and it was 170 degrees at the thickest point when finished, the roast could be cut with a butter knife. I thought by doubling the roast size, I would also need to double the glaze amount, mistake......the original glaze amount will be enough for even a 6lb roast. I wasted half of the glaze.

This was heavenly! I followed some other's advice and browned the roast on all sides and then put it in the crockpot, covered it with rest of ingredients and then cooked on low for 8 hours. It was pull apart tender. I also took the sauce from the crockpot, added some cornstarch, brought it to a boil and made some super yummy gravy to go on top. Highly recommend this to anyone!!!

WOW, WOW, WOW.  I dont' give things 5 stars unless they are truly exceptional and I would like to give this one 10.  I made it exactly as written, but used my crock-pot, about 4 1/2 hours on high.  When we came back from church, the house smelled amazing.  This was so tender and delicious; it is my new company don't-have-to-turn-on-the-oven meal.  Try this, it is worth the investment in the maple syrup.  Thanks!

This in one of my new favorite recipes on the site.  It was so delicious!  My BF even said that if I ever opened a restaurant, this HAS to be on the menu.  After reading the other comments, I seasoned the pork loin with salt, pepper, onion powder and thyme, then I browned it on the stove before placing it in the roasting pan.  I also reduced the sauce before pouring it over the meat.  My pork was only a 1 and 1/2 lbs.  I cooked it at 300 for an hour and a half until my meat thermometer read 160.  It could not have been more perfect.  I served it with oven roasted veggies and butternut squash risotto from Trader Joes.  Thanks for the great recipe, Christine!

Update 12/5/2010: This recipe is still fabulous. I made it twice this week. One with the recipe as is and once with the recipe as stated below. I prefer the recipe with 2 tbsp vinegar (white, cider, or white wine) and 1 tbsp apple cider, and substituting spicy brown mustard for dijion. (p.s. I don't like spicy food and this doesn't make it spicy)
11/2010: This recipe has it all! This glaze was savory and sweet, the flavors balanced each other perfectly. We did have have apple cider vinegar so we did 2 tbsp white vinegar + 1 tbsp apple cider. We then cooked the pork loin in a slower cooker on low for 8 hours. It was sooooo succulent I couldn't stop eating it. A definite must try!

What a sweet and delicious glaze.  I did use the real maple syrup and the glaze was very runny so I just poured it all over the roast turning in the roast pan to coat extra good.  I did stuff some fresh garlic in various slits in my roast and that just added a great flavor.  I cooked my 4 1/2lb roast for 30min on 400(to brown nice) and lowered temp to 350 and cooked another 1-1 1/2 turning roast midway through.  I took the roast out of the pan and just put the pan right on the stovetop on medhigh and cooked the drippings mixing in a water/flour mixture until thickened.  YUMMY!  Served with mashed potatoes and it was a hit.  Def a sweet gravy so beware before pouring all over your plate.  Will make again and again.

We made this pork for dinner last night - and the end result was nice...but the sauce is quite thin and can burn quite easily.  We brined the pork before cooking and the end result was moist, flavorful pork.

I had a 5 pound pork loin so I doubled the ingredients. I had planned to make this in my oven yesterday but it was in the nineties here so I opted to cook it on my grill. I put half of the glaze on and then wrapped it in foil and cooked it on the grill for 2 hours. I used a sprinkle of cornstarch to thicken up the other half on my stovetop for anyone who wanted more sauce. This lent itself easily to bbq sauce today for lunch.

This was fabulous! Will definitely make again. Super tender! Critical to use real maple syrup. I also used stone ground mustard and rubbed the tenderloin with a mixture of salt, pepper, thyme, onion and garlic powders. I also slow roasted the tenderloin by starting at 425 degs for 15 mins, then went down to 375 degs for about an hr, then to 275 degs for about 30 mins, then to 200 degs the rest of the time til the meat was at 160 degs. All in all it cooked about 3 hrs for a 3.35 lb tenderloin. It was fabulous; my guests thought so too.

Very tasty. I cut way back on the maple syrup. 1/2 cup will make a thick enough glaze. I seared the meat first and basted throughout the cooking and put apples around the roast then thickened up the pan juices to make an apple gravy..mmmmm...

Absolutely delicious. We slow cooked the roast for the 4 hours as suggested by others, and it turned out so moist and flavorful. I made sure to turn over the roast halfway through cooking and pouring some of the liquids back onto it. It's also a good idea to reduce the sauce so it's a bit thicker. Amazing smells, we were "tortured" all evening. Wonderful recipe, will use again and recommend to others!

This recipe is great.  i used the crockpot method and the roast came out nice, however, I thinking roasting it would be even better.  I only had maple flavored syrup and used even though I was really worried about it being too sweet.  I did add a bit more cider vinegar and another tablespoon of mustard to balance the sweet syrup.  It turned out great!  I thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch and used it as a sauce to top the slices of meat, YUM!Don't bother to use high priced syrup in this sauce, it'll taste great anyway!!

We love this recipe.  I too ended up just placing it in the crock pot for about 5 hours on high.  I did lift the lid maybe halfway through to turn the pork loin over so the wonderful "gravy" would seep in on both sides and basted it a bit.  Wonderful flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this many times, and it continues to be a favorite.  The only change I make is to cook the syrup, mustard, vinegar, and soy sauce down into a thicker glaze, and I baste the roast with it every 10 mins or so.  It really sticks to it, then!

Very good and easy recipe. DO NOT COOK YOUR PORK IN THE OVEN UNTIL IT HITS 160. Cook in the oven until it hits 140 then take it out, cover with foil and let rest for 10-20 minutes. It will come up to temp and be the most moist pork you have eaten. I also let the pork marinate for 45 minutes, then boiled the excess marinade and basted throughout the hour. Great easy recipe.

So good! I took another reviewers advice and put the ingredients in a saucepan to reduce it before adding it to the pork. Since it was thicker it stayed on better.

Wonderful glaze. I do not like dijon mustard but still used the amount called for as hubby does like that style of mustard. It is not an overpowering mustard taste, just enough to enhance the glaze. Definetly use real maple syrup as I think the commercialized brands would make it over sweet. Leftovers made great sandwiches.

The glaze is excellent.  I used it on pork chops instead of a roast.  I reduced the glaze a bit on the stove, broiled the chops then glazed them and broiled a few minutes more.

Absolutely OUTSTANDING!  I did not change a thing--it is perfect as it.  I basted it several times during cooking to get the most out of that fantastic glaze.  Will make again and again.

VERY TASTY!!  Scaled this down to 2 servings and used this on a pork tenderloin, rather than a pork loin.  I divided the glaze and used part of it for basting the tenderloin.  Hubs grilled this, and basted during the final ten minutes or so.  After grilling, and while the tenderloin was resting, he grilled some fresh pineapple and basted it with some of the reserved glaze.  Still had a little leftover for drizzling when I plated the pork and pineapple.  DELICIOUS!  The glaze was thin, but worked fine for us.

This glaze was fantastic! Following the advice of others, I made a couple changes: I dried the meat with some paper towel, then  seasoned the roast with salt, papper, minced garlic and sage. I also added about 1/2 tbsp of hot sauce to the glaze, it added a great "kick" of flavour that cut through the sweetness of the syrup perfectly. I set my oven temp at 425 for the first 20 minutes, basting after 10 minutes-this created a nice crust that sealed in the juices; then I basted with extra glaze (I only used about a 1/3 of the glaze to begin with) every 10-15 minutes throughout cooking. To go with the roast, I added a couple loaf pans with carrots, potatos and yams tossed with the leftover glaze- delicious! Although, next time I'll skip the glaze on the yams- the sweetness was overpowering.  I'll definitely be making this one again, maybe next time on chicken...?

This was so good and everyone raved about it!  I added a spoonful of chopped garlic to the glaze mixture and marinated the roast overnight in a plastic zipper bag.  I also seasoned the roast lightly with salt, pepper, and onion powder before putting it into the bag with the marinade.  I served it with garlic smashed potatoes and broccoli cheese casserole.

Very good pork recipe! Just be sure to use 100% Pure Maple Syrup and not the fake pancake stuff. I added a few splashes of Tabasco and cooked it in the crockpot. It was wonderful; even my picky husband liked this one! It will definitely become part of my archives!

Wonderful!  This is the best pork I have ever cooked.  My only change - I did marinate the pork overnight using the ingredients in the glaze:  2Tbsp Vinegar, 2Tbsp soy sauce, 4 Tbsp Mustard, but only 2Tbsp maple.  It turned out great!

I am having a hard time deciding between 4 or 5 stars. The meat was very tender, everyone ate it and had 2nds...my 18 yr old had 3rds! I made as others had suggested, cooking in 180 degree oven for 3.5 hours; except that I was concerned it wouldn't be done in a reasonable time so for the the hour I cooked it at the 180 degrees, the 2nd hour I increased the oven temp to 250 degrees and the last hour or so I increased to 350 degrees. I don't know that I would say that the "glaze" stuck since it mine was very thin, but I used a very small roasting pan so it was half covered in the "glaze" and then I based several times while cooking (approx. every 30 minutes or so). I threw in a drained can of carrots the last 20 minutes since I had them on hand. Made baked potatoes and stove top stuffing for sides. Also, only had  just shy of 3/4 C. of real maple syrup on hand so used that and the other ingredients as called for. I did put in maybe a couple Tblspns of imitation maple syrup so like another poster, I added a couple of shots of hot sauce to keep it from being too sweet. My mustard I had was hot and sweet as well. I would likely use this recipe for a pork loin again.

I placed this in the crock pot on low for about 7 hours and it turned out very moist.  I did layer some onions on top of the roast and then poured the marinated over the top.  The only change was I did add some fresh crushed garlic to the marinade.

This was really, really good.  I had a solid pork roast and it ended up taking about an hour and 20 minutes, and I, too, had to continually baste it, but it was worth it.  I also attempted to cook the sauce prior to cooking it but it didn't get as thick as I'd like.  Still very, very good and definitely a keeper!  Thanks Christine!

We've made this pork roast recipe several times in the last month.  (It's so-o-o-o good in the slow cooker and smells amazing all day.)  I wish the glaze was a little thicker, but other than that this is a near-perfect recipe!

First, let me say I rarely give a 5 star as that is for "Thank God for this!" food.  That said, I followed the recipe exactly except I followed someone's suggestion to cook at 180 for 3.5 hours due to timing issues.

This didn't work on my oven at all.  Had to bump to 350 eventually as at 3.5 hours, it was only 120 with a thermometer for the called for size.

We will try again but follow the temp directions :)  Thanks for the very easy recipe.

I did this recipe exactly as posted, except I used Mrs Butterworths and I also cooked it in the crockpot.  YUMMY! I served it with my mom's Potato Romanoff recipe and the Roasted Brussel Sprouts from this website.  GREAT DINNER!  Will definately be making this again, but since there was so much juice/sauce, I will probably serve with rice in the future, and use the sauce as a "gravy" for the rice. YUMMY!

I’ve been making this for years. It’s hands down my husband’s favorite meal. I actually put this in my slow cooker with chopped sweet potatoes and it’s perfect every time.

Mmmmmmmmm!!  This is so delicious! Make it just as written. Don't substitute the maple syrup or it will be too sweet. Add cut up carrots, potatoes and sweet potatoes to the pan (or separately with extra glaze). My family loves this! Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! I would use a little less syrup. I did what another person said and did a higher heat 425-450 for the first 20min.

I made it in the crockpot, and it was amazingly tender and delicious. I cooked it for 4 hours on HI, turning it over about half way through. After I cut the roast, I drizzled the glaze over it. Easy and excellent.

This was a delicious recipe, and I took the advice of reviewers and used the crock pot on the high setting to cook it. I halved all the glaze ingredients (1 cup of maple syrup for a 2 pound pork roast just seemed too much) and this worked very well. After the pork was cooked, I put the liquid in a small saucepan and thickened it with a bit of corn starch. The pork and the sauce were delicious. This is a definite keeper.

AMAZING!  For Christmas, I made this and Fabulous Beef Tenderloin (also from this site).  This way by far my favorite!  The glaze was fabulous and so full of flavor.  I baked to 160 degrees but could probably have taken it out sooner.  The "pork council" says you should cook pork to 145, but that seems a little too underdone to me.  Maybe we could compromise and meet at 150 - 155!  I made a 6 lb pork loin and doubled the glaze.  I basted every 20 minutes, and the end result was beautiful.  Since the pork was $4.99 a pound and the tenderloin was $17.99 a pound, this will be ALL I make next year!

This recipe wars delicious and a definite keeper. I had everything on hand except for the cider vinegar using rice vinegar instead. As with many others suggestions I cooked my over 2bls roast for 2 hours and basted every half hour taking the cover off the last half hour of cooking to get a nice crust on the top. Served with some baby carrots and baby gold potatoes, oven roasted broccoli and salad

This was quite good on flavor. My complaint is that it made quite a bit of watery sauce and 1cup of real maple syrup is pretty expensive. I would try it again with only half the sauce to use less syrup

Wow, this was delicious! It's been a long time since I've tried a new recipe that warranted a 5 star review. I made exactly as written except I cooked the sauce the thicken prior pouring over the roast. I used a Boston butt since it was on sale. Worked perfectly. The flavor is unique and not too sweet. We had plenty left over and used the remaining meat the next night in House Fried Rice (found here on All Recipes). This one's a keeper!

A mediocre dish.  Way too sweet.  I added veggies to the pan and cooked them in the sauce as another reader suggested too.  It is good for the first few bites but eventually the sweetness gets to you.

My son & husband really liked this. I thought it was a tad sweet even though I only used 3/4 c maple syrup. It did carmalize real nice and made a nice saucey type gravy to put over the mashed potatoes that I made to go with it. I reduced the glaze in half on the stove before pouring over the roast and I only poured 1/2 of it over the roast and saved the other half for basting 1/2 way through cooking. I cooked the roast first at 500 degrees for a 1/2 hour, then reduced the heat to 275 degrees for several more hours. I did not have the "too salty" issue as others did because I always use tamari in place of soy sauce.

Ooh, this was great! It DID take longer than an hour, though. I put cubed potatoes around it, and they were good in the sauce, although the potatoes took even longer than they did. If you add a lot of pepper, it tastes fantastic but gets spicy! 

I boiled the sauce for a few minutes to thicken it up while the roast was resting. I think next time I would do that before baking like another reviewer suggested, so it would stay on the roast. (I did  dry the roast before baking, and that didn't help.)

Delicious!  Seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Then put it in the crock pot and in 4 hours it was done perfect.  Turn the pork after 2 hours and made sure to baste a few times.  Love this recipe.

I have made pork roast before but this recipe came out the best.I used everything for the glaze except the vinegar.I found that the mustard had enough of that and I reduced this sauce so that it thickend before I put it on,so it would not slide off.I only had to re apply glaze once more.

This is  fantastic as is. I used approx 2 tblsp course ground pepper. I also brined the pork for two hours in water with about 1/2 Cup of salt. I used a bonless 3lb tenderloin and  took it out of the oven at about 145 degrees and tented it with foil for about 15 minutes before carving. Tender and just a little pink left in the center.

Fantastic! The pork I used was almost 6 lbs... So I reduced the temperature by 25 degrees and it was in the oven for almost 2 hours. I took it out every 30 minutes or so to baste with the glaze. It was delicious! Made it for my in-laws for dinner and everyone commented on how good and tender the pork was!

Terrific glaze. In addition to pork, I imagine it could be used on poultry as well. Beware that the sugar glaze can burn on the pan bottom.

this was just ok.  The flavor of the sauce was good, but a little too sweet.  I might add a little hot pepper and cut back the syrup by 1/4 or so.  It did smell pretty good while it was cooking though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  The sauce was very thin and wasn't really what I would consider a glaze.  I used it to baste the meat periodically.  This went really well with Fried Cabbage I, which had apples and a similar flavor profile.  I will definitely make this again.

This is good but you need to make a double batch if you want sauce.  Added garlic and browned before roasting.  The only thing I recommend is to use a throw away pan as the clean up is a pain because the syrup likes to stick to the pan and everything is very sticky.

After a major bump in the road it came out Great. I did a 5 rib crown roast of pork with this glaze. Next time will inject with glaze. Cooked at 425 15 minto brown and then glazed every 10--15 min, served heated glaze on the side. Don't ask about bump :o)

I was unsure about the maple syrup and mustard, but it was delicious.

This was very tasty and extremely tender.  I used a combination of stone ground and regular Dijon mustard.  I also used white wine vinegar.  My family loved it!

Yum-my!  Didn't have a pork tenderloin so I cut up some pork chops, browned them in olive oil, then added the sauce.  Thickened it with a little cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken up the sauce, then let it simmer for 15 minutes.  Would be great over rice.  Really delicious flavors - even my two year old loved it!

This was an amazing recipe. I did have to cook the meat for a bit longer (about 1 hr. and 25 mins for just over a 2 lb. roast), but it was really flavorful. The sauce was a little thin, but I basted it every 15-25 minutes, as well as turned it once, and it was really a success!

Good, but a little sweet.  Would use less syrup next time. My boyfriend loved it. Something different!!! Here's what I did.  1) poked roast with knife to cook faster  2) Seasoned roast prior to cooking (garlic, spicey mix, onion, sage, smoked paprika, salt, pepper)  3) Quickly browned roast in frying pan  4) Added tobasco and a few dashes of ginger to the syrup, since I found it too sweet  5) slow cooked roast in the syrup sauce/glaze for 3-4 hours  6) Served with a medley of potatoes, yams, minced sauted onion & garlic, broccoli, carrots.  Added asian spices since there was some soy sauce in the syrup mixture

This pork loin was great.  My husband loved it and kept saying so during dinner.  I seared the loin after seasoning it (per another reader's recommendation):  generously pepper/salt, and a little garli powder and onion salt.  Then I put the loin and glaze ingredients in the slow-cooker for a couple hours til temp was 170.  Basted frequently.  Loin was moist and flavorful... very easy to prepare!  Served with yams and green beans.  Thanks for sharing this recipe and for other readers recommendations that I used.

This was awesome.  I basted once and then when the roast was done, I let it sit covered with foil for about 10 minutes.  Then I sliced the roast and let the slices sit in the sauce for another 10 minutes while I mashed the sweet potatoes I served with it.  Delicious!

So tasty! I also basted this every 20 minutes and served the extra juice from the bottom of the pan at the table. My guests spooned it over their potatoes and used their bread to soak all the extra juices! Mmmmm!

Good recipe! I wish the glaze had been a little thicker but the flavor was awesome and the roast was tender.  Even the kids liked it.  I had a 3.5 lb boneless pork roast and it took about 90 minutes to cook. Definitely a keeper!

This roast was "out of this world".  It is one of my favorites from this site. If I could give it 10 stars I would.  I made the recipe as stated with the exception that my roast was 3 1/2 lbs and I cooked it on high in my crockpot for 4 hours.  I removed the meat, which fell apart, out of the pot onto a plate and covered with foil.  I then took the juice and added cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  YUM YUM.  THANK YOU Christine L. for the fabulous recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Tried this with pork chops. Great marinade! never would have thought to try this combination!
Would recommend to give it a few hours to soak in before baking.

This was wonderful!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and upped the heat in the oven to 425 for the first 20 minutes (my roast 2 lbs).  I then continued cooking at 375 for 40 minutes, basting it every 20 minutes.  I also put sweet potatoes in the oven in a separate dish.  I basted them with the glaze through out the cooking.  Next time, I'll ust put them in with the roast.

Nice dinner. I had to double the sauce as there was not enough to cover and baste. I also had to cook for longer than an hour to reach the proper temp. I sprinkled the pork w/ garlic & onion powders, cracked pepper, and cut up sweet potatoes to put around the pan. Served w/ wild rice. BTW: I used 100% Real Maple and Grey Poupon Dijon mustard. Over a good meal nothing I'd serve to company or on holidays; it just was not very special. Thanks for sharing.

The only thing I changed on this recipe was that I used maple flavored pancake syrup instead of actual maple syrup because I already had it, however, I'm sure the real stuff would be even better!  This was very flavorful and juicy.  My guests loved it.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I put it all together in the Crockpot on high for 6 hours. My roast was just over 3lbs. When the meat was done I took the sauce out and thickened it on the stove with a little cornstarch. Then poured some over the top of the sliced pork. Not only is it yummy, but it also looks great on the platter.

Fabulous! I rubbed the pork loin with garlic and sage as others suggested, and browned it before roasting to seal the juices.  I reserved half the marinade and thickened half before covering roast.  It did stick much better and I would recommend this step. I basted every 20 minutes or so throughout cooking.  I added about 1 1/2 TBS. of Tabasco to the marinade.  The hot and sweet combination of flavors made the dish! I also sliced a red onion and placed in the roasting pan and baked the roast with some medium sized yams which I cut in half and baked in the juice of the roast flesh side down.  This picked up the wonderful flavors of the marinade as well. When the roast was done I combined the pan drippings and the reserved marinade and reduced it, bringing to a bowl and drizzled over the sliced roast.  I placed the red onions around the roast and it was a fabulous presentation. Also I served this with polenta, which also soaked up the wonderful gravy!

This pork roast melts in your mouth.  It turned out very tender, not at all drynad it had excellent flavor as well.  Not your average tasting pork roast.  (and it doesn't take off the wall ingredients either!)

I thought this was ok.  It was very easy and I had all ingredients on hand which was nice, but it was not the best pork roast I've made.  I probably won't make it again unless I get desperate.

This was delicious!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and rubbed the pork tenderloin that I was using with some garlic and dry sage.  I salt and peppered and used Mrs. Butterworths because I didn't have pure syrup.  I followed the rest of the directions and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed this.  He actually said it was one of the best things I have ever made.  It was VERY tender, and I also reserved some of the marinade and microwaved it and served it along side the sliced tenderloin, brocollini and white rice.  A keeper for sure!!

I should have folowed the recipe instead I read the reveiw and threw in a crock pot and added garlic and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. It was good but I think cooking in the oven and letting the glaze caramelize over the roast would be better. My roast was dry I let it cook on high for 4 1/2 hours. next time I will stick to how the recipe was written.

This was good, but not outstanding.  It was a little too sweet, even though I only used 3/4 cup maple syrup.  I made it in the crockpot, which was nice because it was easy, and the meat was super tender and juicy.

Absolutely delicious! I made no changes to the recipe, except I did not use real maple syrup. I thought that the sauce was wonderful just using maple flavored syrup. My whole family loved it, even all four kids. I will definitely make this again, it was a big hit!

This was spectacular!  I prepared it according to directions and because my oven was broken I cooked it in the crockpot for 4.5 hours on high.  This has become a family favorite and so easy to make.  (Great served over rice.)

While the pork turned out very moist and tender, I think that the maple flavoring was too much for my families taste.

I've made twice now..both times it was great! Here is what I do: cut the loin in half and sear in butter and garlic before adding to crock pot. I also add a chopped onion and petite carrots. cook on high 3 hours. Just before serving, I reduce half of the liquid to a glaze. I like to serve all on top of egg noodles drizzled with the glaze.

This is a very good recipe.  I used a pork butt 
roast,covered with foil  in a 300F oven for 3 hours.  The meat was soft as butter. The sauce is
very sweet so I only used half the amount, and
just drizzled a bit of it on the meat when serving.

The whole family loved this.  I tweaked this by thickening the sauce just a little at the end with corn starch and water. I will definitely be making this again.

I needed a recipe for baked pork chops and it did not disappoint.  The sauce tasted delicious, tenderized the chops and kept them moist. We also used the sauce on the rice. A simple meal to prepare over the busy holiday season.

After reading reviews, I cooked the glaze to thicken it, but it still burned.  I removed the burned glaze in the pan, basted with reserved glaze and continued cooking.  It tasted fine, but my kitchen smells of burned glaze ??.  I will try again in the crock pot.

The sauce is so simple and tasty, although I omitted the salt due to the soy sauce & cooked it down (in the microwave).  When I smelled the sauce, I figured carrots would be good in it.  So my final cook was in the crock pot with carrots on the bottom, then the roast and sauce.  Yum.

I’ve made this recipe several times because it’s so easy and tastes delicious.  I cook mine in a George Forman Jr Roasting oven, and it takes about an hour of cooking time. I try to marinate the pork for 24 hours to get the maximum flavor. It’s so easy!

This turned out great! I started my Sunday by finding something I could make with what I had on hand. I used a Crock-Pot and cooked in high for four hours. I only had pancake syrup but added a touch of siracha about an hour before it was done so it wouldn't be too sweet. I did reduce the sauce and drizzled it over the sliced roast for presentation. Awesome recipe and everyone loved it! Thank you for sharing!

Excellent. Made it with a pork tenderloin instead of a roast. Used the glaze to marinate the pork for 4 hours before grilling. Took about 20-25 minutes on the grill then let it rest under foil for 5 minutes. Boiled the reserved marinade and reduced it a bit to make a sauce. I would have drank the sauce but my family would never let me forget it! Will definitely make again.

I didn't make any changes except to decrease the temp to 325F after the first hour. One suggestion would be to include a reference on how to use the juices from the fat and glaze. I used some of it as a sauce to cover the servings and it made a huge difference.

This is my new favorite dinner.  Instead of a roast I make this recipe with pork medallions.  Cut into 3/4" slices the sauce covers and crisps more pork.  Be sure to cover your baking pan with foil.  I add a little corn starch to the remaining sauce to make a thicker gravy to cover the medallions with at serving.  This dish goes well with country potatoes.

Outstanding glaze!  Very simple to make. The only alterations to the recipe I recommend is to let the glaze slowly simmer on the stove until slightly thickened- about an hour. It adheres to the roast better and is delicious to serve separately at the table as an add on. My guests have loved it and also excellent on pork tenderloin roasts (both while roasting as well as drizzled on the slices when serving). A half recipe is sufficient for most roasts with plenty of extra for the table.

This glaze was outstanding.  Had only a 1-1/2# pork loin roast, so halved the other ingredients.  Slow cooker for about 4 hours on high, then put the roast in the oven for an hour on 325 to give it a chance to brown and get some crispy edges.   I was afraid it might be too dry, but it was perfect.  Poured the sauce into a small saucepan and simmered it for that hour and it thickened nicely.   This sauce would be excellent on chicken!

I omitted the soya sauce because of needing to make it gluten-free and I did not have GF soya sauce on hand. It was fine but would have more flavor with this ingredient. I used the full cup of maple syrup but will decrease to 1/2 cup in the future. Lining the pan with parchment paper prevents sticking and makes clean-up much easier.  Will definitely makes this again

Although I am not a lover of pork my husband is.  The flavor was great.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours and it was so tender and flavorful.  I also used real maple syrup and followed the recipe as directed.  I will definitely make it again.

After about 30 minutes, the glaze was bubbling and completely burned. I had to remove the pan, switch the roast to another pan and put it back in the oven with virtually no glaze at all. The maple syrup and the mustard it wasn't thick enough to coat or stick to the pork.  I'm going to try this one more time but as a crockpot recipe.

I added Rosemary to the sauce, seared the pork in salt and pepper and garlic powder, and put sautéed onions on top, then cooked in the slow cooker. Turned out fabulous!
Next time, I will probably add a bit of red wine to it, as when I reduced the sauce for serving, it was too sweet.

Definitely a keeper!  Delicious.  Only thing was I used a smaller portion of pork filet (500gm) and halved the sauce and so it took less time to cook.  Took it out at 40 minutes but would recommend checking internal temp at 30 minutes.  Of course use only real maple syrup.

This is my go-to roasted pork recipe. I've made as directed in the oven as well as in the crock pot. It's so easy and tasty - hard to describe - not barbecue flavor nor Asian. Mine has never become a thick glaze as shown in the photos, maybe because I have not used real maple syrup. But still delicious!

I'm not the worlds greatest cook in the world but I do have one expectation when dealing with a recipe.. That it jolly well better come out as good as it looks.. This was just great.. I had a slightly smaller joint and halved the sauce ingredients. I roasted the meat with chunks of onions and tiny baby potatoes, which were fabulous in the juices. I also pushed slivers of garlic inside meat as I like that with pork. I rubbed the sauce into the cuts I made in the fat on top (expecting crackling) and the sides... I basted everything very well half way through. A little over the hour to get to the 145 degree temperature. Succulent tasty pork.. Excellent! Made me look good and its in my recipe box for another time.. Now, all I need to find out is how to get good crackling as I cant seem to cook the fat on top of joints as I would like. Happy cooking...

I made this recipe last night and everyone loved it! I made a few modifications though. First of all, I used a 3 lb. roast and I didn't have Dijon mustard so I subbed spicy brown mustard instead. I also added garlic powder and Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning over roast. I doubled the sauce and cooked it on the stove for about 20 min. to reduce it down to a thicker consistency. I put the whole thing into a slow cooker and cooked it on high for 3 hrs. and then on low for 1 hour. I turned it over every half hour. Came out moist and tender. This is a keeper!

This was wonderful. I will definitely be making this again. I must confess that I did deviate from the directions a little. I rubbed the roast with 2 tsp sage, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp onion powder. Then I browned the roast in a frying pan. Other than that, I did follow directions. It was great! I made a gravy with the glaze left in the pan. Also really nice.

I rubbed a maple-spice blend on the pork roast, then poured on some glaze and baked. (My roast was 3.5 lbs, so I baked it longer than the recipe indicated.) The flavor was glorious! I didn't use even half the glaze, so I kept it and drizzled it over the mashed potatoes I made to go with the roast, and the leftovers. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

Sauce was very wet so reduced it until it was a somewhat thicker consistancy prior to use.  Had a 5 lb. boneless pork roast so I increased the serving sizes and ingredients appropriately.  Roast was very  dry.  would not make this recipe again.

Fantastic!  I served this instead of turkey for Thanksgiving, but it would be wonderful for Christmas.  Plus, it's so easy!  The glaze turns into a sweet and savory sauce and I basted the pork every thirty minutes to ensure good coverage.  My family loved it and this will go in my favorites file.  YUM!

Definitely do this the slow-cooker way (200 degrees for 3.5 or 4 hours), basting at least every hour. I used fake maple syrup. Not too sweet for us at all.

Absolutely LOVE this.  Another great pork recipe to add to our normal weekend meal rotation.  Our 2 year old eats this as daddy makes a sauce out of the glaze and drippings.  The only thing we need to change is making additional glaze so we have more sauce.

Excellent!!!  My family love this recipe. I'm from Mexico an we didn't find the cider vinegar. At the time we decide to make this recipe my dad was in USA and he went to a gourmet shop and they recommend to use Balsamic Apple Cider. We use it and was amazing.. We have 2 year making this recipe for christmas... Tanks

Very easy.  Word of warning, pan is hard to clean cover it with foil for easy clean up.  Drippings made a wonderful gravy for rice and the pork.  I would cook to 145 and let rest for 10 minutes. I like my pork with a hint of pink in the middle.  This recipe still needs 1 hour for cooking.

I was reading other reviewers who said that this recipe could be made in the slowcooker.... however I don't think I got the same results... my glaze tasted really good but became really runny... so i thickened with some cornstarch and made a gravy to serve over the meat... next time I will try making the recipe in the oven basting while the roast is cooking... good tasting glaze though gave the meat great flavor... 
I ate the leftovers on a sandwich with cajon seasoning oh my gosh was it good.... next time I make this recipe i will rub the roast with cajon and then cover it with the glaze... maybe give that a try...

Just served this to about 16 people.  They couldn't stop raving about it and all asked for the recipe. 

We made two roasts, about 3.5 lb. each. First we seared them in a pan.  Then each went into their own crockpot.  We checked the temperature after about 4 hours and it was already 190 or 200 degrees.  We should have moved it to low sooner.  It came out a little dry, but we added cornstarch water to the crockpot and made a gravy to pour over the carved meat on the platter.  

People could not stop going back for more.

Really tasty!  I was too lazy to reduce the sauce first as another post suggested but I found that it was thick enough as is.  My variations included seasoning the meat first with salt, pepper and garlic powder, and I added some garlic powder and ground cloves to the sauce.  The roast should be pulled out of the oven at about 150 degrees--I took mine out at 155 and it was a little overdone.  I think this sauce would be fantastic on a baked Christmas ham!  Great recipe and very easy!

If you are even thinking about cooking this, do it!!  The best hands down without a doubt.  Don't worry about the sweetness, it is not an issue.  I made scalloped potatoes with it which was a great offset to any sweet tooth.

I did brine the loin for two days , as it tends to be a tough piece of meat.  I added carrots and onions and cooked in crockpot for about 7 hrs. on low.....my wife now wants it almost every day.

This is really, really good stuff!!!

A wonderful way prepare a pork roast!  I suggest laying foil down in your roasting pan or the glaze that drips off will bake onto your pan and be hard as nails.  For a side, cut up some parsnips into 2x2.5 inch pieces and bake in a separate dish for 20 minutes, then give them a stir and brush on a little of the maple/mustard glaze.  It candies them nicely and makes for a delicious meal!

Absolutely delicious! I made it as described. Could be made with chicken I imagine, and would be good to put onions, carrots, and potatoes in the dish! I was liberal with the black pepper which gave it a nick kick.

I cooked this on Christmas for my family, and everyone loved it. I used a 6 pound pork loin, so of course it took closer to 2 hours to cook. I had plenty of sauce without scaling up, though! I had no Dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard that was in the fridge. Delicious, incredible, will definitely make again- soon!

I browned the pork roast with garlic, onion and some other root veggies then cooked the sauce mixture in the pan before putting it all in the crockpot.  Also added a large can of plum tomatoes to keep the roast slightly covered and moist in the crockpot while cooking.  It turned out amazing...

Awesome!!!!!! Most beautiful glaze and it was super easy to put together. Would work well with chicken and lamb too. I did change the recipe because I didnt have all the ingredients; honey in place of maple syrup, wholegrain mustard in place of dijon, and white balsamic vinegar in place of cider vinegar.  I also put one cup of water in the tray at the half way mark, it stopped the glaze in the pan from burning and made the sauce go further when we ate it.

This was very good!  I cooked it in the crock pot on low for about 8 hours and it was wonderful!  I didn't have dijon mustard, so instead used about 1T of Coleman's English mustard.  Hubby was a little upset I used so much of our pure Vermont maple syrup, but we buy it by the half gallon, so it didn't use too much of our stock.  I think the final flavor more than made up for it.  Delish!!

Oh, this is soooooooooooo good. What a great dish to impress the relatives and inlaws with. You have to use REAL maple syrup, just get over it and shell out the 7 bucks for the real thing. I promise you won't regret it!

Very tasty and easy!  I sprinkled the roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and sage and browned it before putting it in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes.  Reduced the temperature to 375 until meat thermometer reached 160.  I also basted it perodically.  I had no problem with the sauce being too thin - it thickened quite nicely by the time the roast was ready.

Excellent!  I only had the fake maple syrup so I had to use that instead.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I used my oven's built in temp probe and cooked it to exactly 160.  It was cooked perfect and came out very tender & delicious!  Also I cooked it in a 2qt glass dish, so the roast was half submerged in sauce, but I think that may be part of the reason it came out so tender (I also basted it a few times during cooking).  And all that sauce was delicious spooned over the sliced roast and carrots & potatoes I served it with!

My husband said it was the best pork roast I'd ever made. I doubled the glaze because my pork was almost 2x the size. I put it in a 9x13 baking pan and basted through out with the liquids. It smelled great!

This was a fantastic pork roast recipe!  Next time I make it, I plan to spice it up with a dash of hot sauce, but the blend of maple syrup, Dijon mustard and soy sauce together were wonderful.  My husband dubbed it a keeper after his first bite.

Only changes were the use of table syrup and white vinegar in place of real maple syrup and cider vinegar. We cooked some peas and carrots in the pan with the pork roast. It was okay, but the flavours didn't penetrate the meat well.

This glaze is wonderful. I basted the pork every 15 minutes. I reserved a little of the glaze and heated it up in a saucepan to drizzle over the pork. My husband could not get enough of it. He was dipping all of his side dishes in it. This is a very easy and delicious recipe. After reading many reviews about the time it took to cook the pork loin, I decided to cook mine for an hour and 45 minutes. I left it rest the full 10 mintues and it came out perfectly cooked, very tender, and delicious.

Tried this tonight for the first time and was very pleased with the results.When I poured the glaze over the roast it seemed way too much for the roast and if you only cook it for about and hour as the recipe states it is too much & too thin.However if you roast it for 2 hours at the end of this time you will have a thick beautiful glaze that tastes outstanding,also I kept basting so the meat would not dry out and it didn't.Will make this again.

VG pork dish. Pondered whether to put it in the crock pot but opted to follow the recipe and cook it in the oven. Only changes (as recommended by others): seared it first in a pan with vegetable oil, added a few splashed of tabasco to sauce, and thickened the sauce after it was done. Quite tasty.

I'm planning to make this tonight for some people I really want to impress.  I'm going to reduce the glaze to thicken it and will definitely add some hot sauce as other reviewers have done.  I think it will be mouthwateringly good and I can't wait to serve it!  I've read many of the reviews--it seems like it's a no fail recipe so I'm rating it a five in advance!

This was fabulous.  I used one bottle of maple syrup (12 oz).   Basted it about every 20 minutes.  Three pound roast---1 1/2 hours and it was tender, delicious.  My husband and son couldn't stop raving, especially my son.  I added some garlic but other than that, nothing was needed.  I will make this many more times.  Nice, maple flavor but not overpowering.

I followed the recipe as is with the exception of using my slow cooker and adding garlic and onions to the bottom of the pot.  I thickened up the pan juices with a bit of flour and water and found it a a bit stronger tasting than I would have liked. It would have been good served over rice.  Next time I will add a bit of stock to the glaze to soften the flavour a bit.  Definitely a keeper.

I've used this glaze many times for pork roast and pork tenderloin. I agree its thin and not actually a glaze. The type of maple syrup makes a difference. Using the real thing though expensive is worth it for taste and consistency (opposed to Mrs. Butterworth, etc.) This glaze tastes great and in my experience keeps the meat moist and infuses flavor. If you want a true glaze, boil it down on the stovetop as other reviewers have suggested.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars because of the sauce.  My pork came out dry and tough.  I must have done something wrong so am giving the recipe the benifit of the doubt and thinking it must have been me.  I may try this again in the crock pot but since I am not a big fan of pork probably not.  The only thing that saved all the pork I had left was the small new potatoes and the carrots. I could roast just the carrots in the sauce and my family would love it. The leftovers were good because I cut it in very small pieces and because I doubled the sauce I had enough to pour over it and heat it back up in a 350 oven. I know I will probably make half the sauce and roast carrots in it because we were fighting over the last piece of carrot.

Really enjoyed this one!  I didn't have any 'real syrup' (surprisingly, sigh!) so only used 1/2 cup of the Aunt J lite.  Also used a hot honey balsamic vinegar in place of the cider and also only had full grain dijon, so used that.  After reading some reviews, I added a few good dashes of hot sauce (Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce) which gave it a nice spiciness to the sweet.  Overall, very yummy and I could see this tasting great on chicken too!

This is absolutely wonderful!  My family loved every bite and enjoyed the extra "juice".  I let my roast marinate for about 4 hours before baking.  This time I'm trying in the slow cooker!  Wish there were six stars for this recipe!

This recipe was amazing! After taking the roast out, I set the corning-ware that I cooked it in with the left over sauce on the stove top and added about 2tsp of cornstarch, heated it up and thickened it to drizzle over top, worked great! The left over sauce would also work nicely with baked salmon or ham too!

What a delicous recipe.  I've made it a few times and everyone loves it.  It's a perfect dish for entertaining with. I also put it in on 425 degrees for the first 30 minutes and then lower the temp. down to 350, the maple syrup caramelizes nicely.

Now here's what you do with this great concoction of flavor.  4Xs the glaze and use it as a marinade - about 12-18 hours in a freezer bag in the fridge. Then set up the grill for indirect medium  heat (I elevate a small cookie rack over the main grill for best results). The tenderloin gets done fairly fast.  I use the thermometer and cook until its as done as you want.  With some of the marinade reserved, I heat it up and use it as a sauce.  Slice thin and serve over a bed of rice.  Yummy.

I actually made this a few years ago.  Great recipe.  I have also made a turkey and put this glaze on it.  Wonderful!!!!  This year, I am putting the glaze on the ham for Thanksgiving.  Expecting it to also be a big hit.

I couldn't believe that something so easy could be so delicious.  Made this as written and couldn't have been happier with the taste.  I did though double the sauce so we'd have plenty for pouring over the meat and the starch I served and turns out that is the best part, the sauce.  I would highly recommend at least doubling the sauce if not tripling it.  Even my 9yr old picky son had to have seconds with extra sauce on his!  This is a must make! Thanks

YUM!  While I was whisking together the maple and mustard glaze, I wasn't quite sure that all the ingredients and flavors would taste well together.  I did the 'ole "finger dip" taste test and the glaze was very delicious.  I marinaded several boneless pork chops in the glaze for about 8 hours, then baked at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes.  The pork chops were moist, tender, sweet, and absolutely scrumptious!  Great recipe!

The amount of sauce was way too much for a 2 1/2 # roast.
To make it stick to the roast I had to reduce it slightly on top of the stove, but that made it stick to the roasting pan making a mess.  The flavor of the sauce does not penetrate the meat.  If I made it again, I would either do it in a slow cooker, or just reduce the sauce and serve it over the sliced meat at the table.
It also took at least an hour and a half to get the meat to 160 degrees.

This is a great recipe that can be used in many different ways.  I decided to use it as a glaze for some pork chops.  I used 1/2 cup syrup, 1/4 cup mustard, 1/4 cup apple juice, and 1 tsp of cumin with 1/4 of a white onion, diced.  Heat the sauce over medium heat for five minutes.  Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat with some olive oil.  Sear the chops for 2.5 minutes per side, then transfer to a roasting pan, cover with sauce and place in a 350 over for 10 minutes.  The chops were juicy, the sauce was amazing, and they make great leftovers!!

This was such a great marinade for this kind of cut of pork. I didn't have the time to cook it on the oven so I used my crockpot.  It was great moist and tasty I would'nt change a thing.  It fell apart like a pot roast in the crockpot.  I will have to try it in the oven the next time.  I am sure it will just as great but with a different flavor.  Can't wait!

This will likely be the only way I do Pork Roasts.  Very good.  Only thing I had to change, was I did not have real maple syrup, so just used syrup.  Very tasty.
I basted every 20 minutes or so, just when ever I went into the kitchen, and it took about 2 hours to reach 160.
Really, really good!

My whole family loves this recipe! I cooked it for a family event and had many wonderful compliments. I have subsituted the real maple syrup for the the processed kind and it still tastes good! Next time I'm going to buy real maple syrup for it. 

It does take longer than an hour to cook this, though - probably around 2 to 2 1/2 depending on the size of your pork roast!

I wasn't real impressed. I must admit the sauce tasted and smelled fabulous. But you couldn't taste the sauce in the finished product.

I took the reccomendations of others and rubbed the roast with sage and garlic, maybe that helped, maybe not. Either way, I won't be making it again. I think I can make a better pork roast with garlic salt and pepper.

This was a pretty good dish. I added about 1 tablespoon of tabasco sauce as per one reviewer had suggested and it did give it a nice kick to the pork, but next time I'll omit it. My family enjoyed this dish and I will be making it again.

Great! Per other reviews:  Brown first with a rub of powdered sage.  Prepare sauce in the browning pan. Save 1/3 of marinade to pour on top of sliced finished roast. It was a little sweet, but we will definitely make this again.

I'm trying to cut down on sugar, so I used 1/2 regular syrup and 1/2 sugar-free syrup along with lite soy sauce.  Cooked in crockpot on low for about 5 hours.  I agree with the other reviewer who said this is good with sweet potatoes.  Mmmm...good!

Very tasty and as usual I had to change it...I had a bottle of cinnamon pancake syrup I wanted to get rid of so I used that and kept basting the roast all the time...so good!

We enjoyed.  I forgot to defrost the meat, so I just threw it frozen in the crockpot and let it cook on low for 8 hours.  Loved the sauce and the meat was so tender.  Served over white rice.  Thanks

This is truly excellent! I used the ingredients as listed, but I cooked the roast in my Crock-Pot. When the roast was done, I thickened the gravy with a bit of cornstarch. I found that the sauce didn't really taste strongly of any of the principal ingredients, but rather was a wonderfully mellow blend of them all. I served this with mushroom barley pilaf and roasted acorn squash. Fantastic, and perfect for a chilly fall day. Thank you for sharing!!

My husband loved how tender this was and my five year old ate three helpings. It was really flavorful, next time I will try in the crock pot, but definitely use real maple syrup!

The whole family loved this recipe.  The combination of the sweet and salty with the pork is terrific.  I wasn't sure about using the mustard, but followed the recipe and was glad I did.  The first time we used boneless pork chops, the second a boneless pork loin roast.  Both were great.  Watch the amount of salt you use carefully since the soy sauce has so much in it, too.

Glaze was yummy, but a little thin to stick to roast.  I added sliced apples in the bottom of the pan and they cooked up in the extra glaze.  They were incredible.  I roasted it at a lower temp for longer and it was very tender.

This is going to be a regular dish in my home!  The sauce was delicious and the pork was so juicy.  The glaze didn't stick to the pork loin, so I reserved half and basted it regularly while it was baking.  I poured the last of the glaze over the loin when it was done.  I have a very picky 18 month old daughter who is allergic to milk and eggs, so I have a devil of a time finding food she can and will eat.  She ate a fair amount at dinner and ate even more when I heated the leftovers for lunch today.

I raise pork and I am always looking for pork recipes.  I used a bone in pork roast and added a teaspoon of Montreal Steak Spice Seasoning instead of pepper and salt.  I started out by cooking it for 5 hours in a crock pot on high with half the sauce/ basting every hour.  I then removed the meat from the crock pot and put it in the oven at 375 degrees with the remainder of the sauce poured over the top and baked until nicely browned.  I must say this recipe is outstanding and I cant wait serve it at one of my dinner parties.

This recipe was great.  It uses simple ingredients that you already have in the house, no long marinating and everyone loved it. This will go in my recipe collection -- I will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Great glaze.  I like to take my pork out when temp reaches 155 then let rest for 20 minutes.  This comes out juicier not dry.

SCRUMPTIOUS!  For the holidays at work we were given a choice of a ham (blech!), a turkey (not again!  We just had turkey for Thanksgiving), a fruit basket (I'm underwhelmed) or a pork roast.  I have never cooked one of these before and figured I would give it a shot.  I checked off "pork roast" and joked with my husband that if it came out bad - there was always Chinese food like Ralphie's family (Fa Ra Ra Ra Ra.. Ra Ra Ra Ra!).  I found this recipe and liked the fact that I would not be chained to the stove all Christmas morning.  To everyone's absolute delight, this was one of the BEST Christmas dinners we have ever eaten!  I made the glaze the night before and could not believe that all I had to do was pour it on and stick a thermometer in the meat!  It was juicy and tasty and everyone is looking forward to the next time I make it!  This is a keeper for sure!

This is an excellent pork recipe!  I don't have that much experience cooking with pork so I was a little apprehensive, but this recipe is really easy and the the results are amazing!  The only changes I made were a combination of the tips posted 1) seasoned the pork loin with a salt/pepper/sage/garlic mixture     2) heating the sauce ingredients in the same pan before adding 2/3 of it to the pork in the roasting pan and 3) combining the sauce from the roast with the leftover 1/3 in the pan to make a gravy.

I used a rolled loin and it came out well.  I did have a problem with the glaze burning on the pan so I had to improvise a deep foil pan.  The taste of the glaze is very good.

The glaze didn't stick very well to the roast. Rather, it cooked off only the bottom of the pan making a real mess. I wouldn't make this again.

Made this for Christmas dinner and everyone said they liked it.  I am a picky eater, I thought the glaze itself tasted amazing, but when the roast was done, you could hardly taste the baste on the outside.  I thought that when my guests were going to sit down and eat, that the meat would taste dry to them.  So I quickly mixed some more of the marinade ingredients together and made a gravy to go on top of the pork and everyone LOVED it afer that.  I even had someone call me the other day to ask what was in the "sauce" I made that I put on top of the pork.  Other than not really having my marinade stick to my pork, I thought that this was a good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow. This recipe was fantastic. I only had about 3/4 cup of pure maple syrup, so I had to use a little pancake syrup. It was still delicious. We deglazed the pan with red wine and served more glaze on the side. I served this to a group of people with mashed potatoes and a salad, and they loved it. One of the guys had recently returned from a deployment to Afghanistan. You can bet he cleaned his plate!!

This was so easy and tasted great - even my 2 year old and 9 year old loved it. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots, both of which were good with the extra sauce. This recipe is a keeper.

Followed the suggestion of reducing the glaze to thicken it and then roasted the meat for 10 minutes at 450, reduced heat to 250 for about 90 minutes (I had a 3-1/2 lb. roast), poured on some of the glaze and then basted every 20 minutes or so. Pork was perfectly cooked and delicious.

We totally loved this.  I doubled the glaze and thickened it a bit with some zantham gum.  It was delish!

I served this for a holiday party as a modified pulled pork sandwich. Was yummy and well received in general, though maybe a little too sweet. Overall good, though I wish the glaze had thickened up more without extra effort. Will make again with some small tweaks.

It was ok. Not what I'd call a glaze. A glaze should be thick and stick to the meat.  This is a very thin liquid. Liked the flavor though!

Very disappointed.  This was not a glaze but a liquid that slid off the meat and burned on to the roasting pan while cooking.

This pork was really good once it was finished, however I made a few small changes.
Instead of maple syrup I put corn syrup (and a bit of table syrup to give it a more maple taste) because I had no natural maple syrup AND to thicken the glaze up as some reviewers pointed out (though it would probably taste even better with real maple syrup, i don't know).
 Instead of dijon(? I forget what the recipe says) mustard I put regular yellow mustard and it turned out great. I also added some garlic powder/salt (very little) instead of regular salt just because I like adding garlic to everything.
Also I should mention I used Thai soy sauce which was pretty salty- it's better to use that instead of VH soy sauce or whatever you usually buy. The asian stuff is the REAL stuff.

The cook time is definitely off, so my cook time was about 2 and a half hours, and for the last hour or so I turned the oven up high. The pork was also very white so I think using actual maple syrup would darken it up and give it that roast pork look.

Easy and delicious! Browned the pork in a cast iron skillet, added glaze, and put in oven. I was a bit short on maple syrup so added a tablespoon sorghum molasses.  Basted meat once from glaze in bottom of pan. Baked potatoes and butternut squash in the oven with it, and dinner was warm and ready after picking up the crew on a cold night. Let meat rest then sliced and served glaze in a ramekin on the side. A keeper.

Love it. I seared the roast and then cooked it in the crockpot. I added carrots after about 2 hours and the sauce made them taste heavenly! I will definitely make this again. The maple was pricey, but well worth it!

This is also an excellent recipe for pulled pork when you make only half of the sauce and cook on high in a slow cooker for five hours.

I made this as posted, except that I did reduce the glaze in advance. It was excellent! 
Today I made the leftovers into a stew by adding to the slow cooker the veggies in my refrigerator today: onions, carrots, garlic, asparagus, zucchini, and more of the sauce.

This was pretty good.  I added some garlic and onion powders and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the marinade sauce.  I marinated the pork for about an hour in some of the sauce and cooked it on the grill instead of the oven.  I seared it and cooked it the rest of the way in a disposable aluminum pan on the grill and basted it with the sauce every 10-15 minutes.  The sauce reduces and makes more of a sweet soy sauce taste and I didn't get much of the mustard taste in this.  So next time I may double the mustard and omit the vinegar.  Overall it gave the pork nice flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good recipe!  I made this in the crockpot and  followed the ingredients mostly.  I say mostly as I didn't have Dijon mustard so used 1/2 spicy brown and 1/2 horseradish mustard.  I also added some minced garlic (as another reviewer did) and even added a little garlic chili sauce for a slight kick. I also put sliced onions in the bottom of the crockpot before I added the roast.  I'm only giving this a 4 star and not a 5 because of the sweetness.  While really delicious, flavorful and moist it was quite sweet.  Next time I will reduce the maple syrup amount.  If you like super sweet then it will be fine just as is.  In the end the family loved it and will make this again!

This was an amazing dish. We had a small 1lb. pork loin roast, so I decided to cut the glaze ingredients in half. I wish that I had read the reviews, because I, too, noticed that the glaze was thin, and I didn't think to reduce it prior to roasting. Instead, I basted it several times while roasting it. It only took an hour for that small of a piece of meat to come to temperature, but it was juicy and tender as if it had come from the crock pot. I'm going to try it with a full loin next time.

I used the long, skinny pork loin by the way.

Maple syrup is expensive... I made half the amount and had plenty to use as a baste several times while cooking.

This sauce is amazing. I didn't need as much meat so I made pork medallions on the stove. I served it with baked sweet potato and steamed veggies. My family loved it.

01-16-16 ~ A nice recipe for a pork roast.  I cooked the glaze on the stove top before starting the roast in the oven.  I added sliced potatoes, carrots and sliced a large onion in thirds.  I started the roast with the fat side up and basted it a few times while it baked.  I used the low and slow method as I had to leave the house for a bit, and knew it would be fine at the lower temp.  Once it was done, I let the meat rest, sliced it and laid it back in the pan on the veggies and basted it again before serving.  I served it with 'Sweet Coleslaw' and 'Pumpkin Cheese Bread' both from AR.  Dinner was rounded out with a piece of rhubarb pie and ice cream for dessert.

This was tasty! I modified it a bit based on what I had in my kitchen and added some seasoning as well. I used:
- 1c maple flavored syrup
- 5 Tbs honey mustard (found the sauce to be a bit vinegary with only 4 Tbs)
- 2 1/2 Tbs of cider vinegar
-2 1/2 soy sauce (omitted the salt because of the soy sauce)
- 1/2 tsp or so of cracked black pepper
- 1/4 tsp marjoram
- 1/4 tsp thyme
- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
-1 whole onion sliced

I placed the separated slices of onion on the bottom of my roasting dish, set the roast on top, scored it, and poured the mixture over the top and baked it for about an hour and 10 mins. I did baste it once and my onions nearly desinegrated by the end, whixh was expected. I agree with the other reviews, the sauce was thin, but I made a lovely gravy with it so it didnt matter. I would make this again and really enjoyed my modifications.

Great flavor! I followed the recipe exactly, just using the sauce to marinate the meat for a couple of hours beforehand. Then I used it to baste the pork a couple of times during the cooking process. The only problem I had was my own fault. I slightly over-cooked the pork; I should have used a meat thermometer! My husband still loved it, though, and I'll make it again. Next time, I'll use a thermometer...

Followed other reviewers advice and made it in my crock pot; seven hours on low. I put a slow cooker liner in my crock pot first . Saved a ton of time with clean up and kept the sauce from burning. I made the recipe exactly as it states and the sauce is pretty thin, but really flavorful. After it was done cooking, I made a gravy with the sauce and drizzled some of the sauce over the pork. It was awesome. My husband had two servings. Would totally make this for company. In addition to the first night, I cut up the pork for sandwiches and made grilled sandwiches with cheese and the sauce. So good after a late night at work.

Have made this a few times now. I sit it on a bed of onions and apples which is amazing. I also use whole grain mustard as I don't like Dijon. Made it tonight with pork chops on the stove. Fried the chops in garlic oil until almost done. Fried the onion with salt and pepper until soft, added the apple and deglazed the pan with the vinegar. Put the maple and mustard and soy in, brought to the boil and heated the chops through. Served with crispy potatoes and steamed veg. Plates were licked clean. Going to try it with chicken.

The quantity of glaze is way more than needed for a 2-1/2 pound roast, and it needs more than 1 hour to cook. It is pretty tasty, though, so I might try it in the slow cooker next time.

I cut the maple syrup by 1/3 and substituted natural apple sauce for it.  The best part was the next day!  We thin-sliced the leftovers put them on a baguette with drizzled Sriracha.  Then sautéed another round of the sauce for side dipping!  Better than the dinner!!!

I didn't have Dijon mustard so I just used regular mustard. 
I had about a 4 pound pork roast. It took aprox. 2.5 hours to cook. (I increased the heat to 375 degrees for about 30 mins cause I wasn't sure it would be done on time, but I think it would have.)
I added a couple of small onions on top, baked it inside my cast iron dutch oven, covered. I basted it about 3 times in that 2+ hours. It turned out pretty delicious. 
We had company over the first time I made it and everyone really complimented it! My hubby was especially pleased. :)
After it was done and had sat about 15-20 mins, we cut it into slices and let the slices soak in the juices. They were moist and full of flavor! 
Thanks for the recipe :)

If you have company coming, this is your recipe. Use your thermometer and let it rest, it will be so tender and juicy.  I make no changes, it's great as is. My teen son came home an hour after we ate, said he wasn't really hungry. I went in later to clean up and half a tenderloin was gone.

I did not have any soy sauce.  I substituted Worcestershire sauce instead and the recipe worked great even with that substitution.  Love this.  My husband loved this.

I used old fashioned mustard and apple cider because I didn't have what the recipe asks for and it still turned out delicious!  Super easy to make.
Like the  other reviewers said, the syrup is very runny. The next time, I will try reducing it by boiling it beforing adding it to the pork.

Made this tonight and the family loved it.  I had two pork tenderloins that I put salt, pepper, garlic salt and dried sage of and let it rest for about one half hour.  I then got my heavy black iron skillet and heated it well and used a small bit of oil in it and browned both loins on both sides.  Then put the maple sauce over it all and stuck it in the oven for 20 minutes at 350.  Pulled out at 145f on meat thermometer.  Let meat rest on a cutting board while I then boiled the sauce and it thickened quickly.

I made this with dark corn syrup instead of maple syrup (it was all I had).  It made for a nice thick glaze that stayed put while the meat was cooking.  Flavor was great!

This was a hit!  I made a few mods to cooking temp/time, preheated oven to 400, cooked 15 minutes uncovered.  Basted, put lid on and lowered to 350 for 1.5 hours. Cooked to 160deg. Took out of oven, put on a plate and covered tightly with foil. Rested for about 10 min while I finished the rest of dinner. 
Had quite a bit of sauce in roasting pan so I thickened with a bit of cornstarch/water.  Delicious!  
Served with scalloped potatoes that baked same time as the roast and a pan of oven roasted zucchini/peppers, which I did in oven after taking out roast.  (turned up heat to 400 for a quick cook).
Definitely will make again.

My first attempt at a pork roast was an amazing success thanks to this tasty recipe. This will certainly become a regular at our table! Thank you for this one. The glaze was a bit runny so next time I will try to reduce this a little before putting in the oven, still was absolutely delicious!

This has to be thee best pork recipe I've tried, and trust me I've tried a lot! I LOVE my pork! Sweet with some tang, I love it on my mashed potatoes as well. I put this in my slow cooker for 4 hours on low since mine runs hot. Once it is all done I make a gravy out of the sauce by just putting it in a pot on the stove with some flour thrown in it. I believe my husband likes this much better than his mothers pork loin recipe, he asked for this one over hers! It is a for sure keeper!! Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night and followed the recipe.  We didn't have prepared Dijon-style mustard so I used grainy mustard.  Hubby liked it but I wasn't a fan of the mustard 'grains'.  I tried to reduce the sauce as I had extra but it wasn't think enough for me. I then added a teaspoon of cornstarch and the sauce ended up being TOO thick! Haha! This one is a keeper!

Ten stars! Very easy to prepare. I mixed up the sauce in the morning and put it in the fridge.  Once our company arrived, all I had to do was place the roast in the pan and pour the sauce over it. Everyone loved it. I will make this again and again.

Made in the crock pot (4 hours on high), but the sauce seemed very watery. I also added two cut up onions and some baby carrots which may have contributed liquid. Pork also seemed a bit dry but maybe that was the cut I used. May try a shoulder or butt next time. Will also try in the oven as I'd like a crisper outside!

Made this for Christmas and it was a hit.  My husband said it was the best Christmas dinner of all time.  I used the crock pot method mentioned in the other reviews.  Just browned the pork roast, put in crock pot on medium for about 7 hours

I have made this several times in my slow cooker and it always comes out delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I omit the salt, and the last time I actually forgot the pepper.  It was still wonderful.  I served this with stuffing, carrots, and fresh sliced apples.  I placed the apples on the plate and the maple sauce got on them a little bit, which made them even more delicious.  Even my picky eater loves this recipe.  This is a family hit meal that I will make often.

This is a keeper!  Amazing flavor.  I had all the ingredients in the house with the exception of Dijon mustard. I used Guldens Spicy Brown and the flavor was very good.  My DH said that it was of restaurant quality.  I will be making this again.

Pretty Good. The house smelled amazing as it cooked. I used Kroger pancake syrup because I didn't have real Maple. I sliced the roast and put it back in the oven. Mistake.....the juices ran out and mixed with the thick sauce. Still good but didn't get that "gravy" style sauce.

Excellent, my family is still raving about it.  I was hesitant to try it since I am not a big fan of maple flavor but oh my goodness, this is great.  I followed other suggestions and cooked the glaze down a little to make it thicker, put foil down in the pan and cooked it in the smallest pan I could, 8 x 8.  I used a sirloin tip roast from Costco, perfect fit in an  8 x 8.  I basted it two or three times and did what a reviewer said, cook it at 425 for 30 minutes and then down to 350 for the rest of the time.  This did give it a nice browned top.  The only thing my family said I need to do next time is double the glaze, they wanted to put it all over their meat!  Thank you for a great new family recipe.

Delish! The only change I made was cooking it at 425 for 40 min and the remainder at 350.(I had a 71/2 lb bone in roast) basted 3-4 times

I'm sorry, but this was awful. Had planned it to be a second night of pork fried rice, but the glaze just ruined the flavor of this meat.

This was good. Need to brown roast first to caramelize otherwise brown but no crunch. Did what another reviewer suggested and doubled marinade and baked potatoes/yams/onions/carrots in separate pan alongside. While not awful they would have been a better contrast tart and tangy rather than sweet. Too much sweetness even with maple syrup. I added cayenne but there's better options out there. Hot and tangy would have been bette and provide some contrast. Also needs served with something green. Hate all beige meals!!! Next time will do the pork to 150. 145 is always too pink for our family even after sitting out. Will do again but lots of changes needed. Try the pork tenderloin with plum sauce recipe instead !!!

Cooked this using a spit. if you're intending to make crackling, remove skin before marinating ( I marinated for 24 hrs) Score and season the skin and replace it ready to cook. You will need to tie it back on to the pork. 
(leaving skin on to marinate will result in blackening of the skin and it won't crackle. but is still tasty).
A little bit of work but well worth it.
Added sage and parsley.

I halved the amount of glaze I made and it was still enough for my 2lb pork loin. I also added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon, the juice of 1/4 an orange, and after reading reviews from others about the thinness of the sauce added 1 1/2 tbsp of corn starch. The sauce thickened up nicely, but I still had to brush the sauce back on the roast as it melted off. The sauce was very nice. Was sweet, but not too sweet. The meat was nice and tender. My husband enjoyed it too and said he would enjoy having it again. Next time though I will line my pan with foil because the sugars in the sauce are going to be a hassle to clean.

I made this recipe for guests and it came out awesome!  Everyone loved it.  Couldn't wait to make it again.  This time, I put it in the crock pot as another person suggested.  It completely changed the flavor and texture of the roast.  Meat came out dry and the glaze/sauce was way too watery.  Even after trying to thicken up.  Stick with the oven method and it will be wonderful.

Loved It!!  Followed Butterfly Flutterby's notes (thank you very much), but I did my roast on Low for 8 hrs. I made extra sauce and heated it up for a gravy. It definitely makes the difference using real maple syrup for flavor and coating the roast. Great with red smashed potatoes with skins and carrots tossed in honey. Will definitely make this one again and try the sauce on pork chops.

OK,I added fake syrup. It was OK, I like recipes with sweet and mustard flavors. This one just didn't add up. I have a hard time seeing how real syrup would have made a difference.

Absolutely wonderful! I am a lazy cook, so I took the easy route. I threw the meat and the glaze in the crockpot on low for 6 hours. After 4 hours, I put in some peeled baby carrots and a sliced onion. Came out absolutely delicious. Yummy!

The best pork marinade I've tasted in a long time.  I was skeptical with the maple syrup, but combined with the other ingrediants, its out of this world good.  My hubby couldn't stop kissing me!!!  I let it marinate overnight and I think it made it even better.

Really, really good!  I cut the marinate in half for a 2 lb. roast and it's still enough.  I baste once or twice while cooking.  I also used a dijon mustard that had mustard seed in it.  Next-day sandwiches are super!

wonderful glaze! I actually used a sirloin roast because that's what i had in my freezer. I my knowledge is it a leaner and not as tender piece of meat (?). So my final product with this recipe was tender enough to eat but quite as tender as I'd have liked - but I think that had to do with the meat I used, not the recipe/cook time. I'd definitely recommend using REAL maple syrup. I was a little generous in measure in the mustard, soy sauce and vinegar and more conservative with the syrup. If you do it the other way around it could be too sweet. Also, I pierced the meat liberally with a fork to help flavor absorb then I cooked it in a small baking dish that barely held the meat and sauce. The meat sat down 2/3 covered by the sauce so i only turned it over once during baking rather than basting. This kept the glaze in the bottom of the pan to use a sauce rather than having it thin out and burn (it does burn easily!). Serve with sweet potatoes (drizzling the glaze over them too is awesome) and a green salad or veggie (I used grilled asparagus). YUM!

Sickly sweet.  I thought with the mustard and spices this might be more mild.  And this took far more than 1 hour to cook for a 2.5 lbs. roast.

What a fantastic combination of flavors!  The tang of the vinegar, the sweetness of the syrup and the zing of the mustard blend into delicioso plus!  I followed the recipe exactly as shown, except I didn't have enough real maple syrup, so I used half real and half Aunt Jemima's.  I blended all of the ingredients and poured them into a Ziploc bag with the pork roast, and refrigerated for about a day.  Used my meat thermometer and basted the roast about every 20 minutes or so; took it out when it reached 160 and the roast was perfect.  My daughter likes her meat plain, so I cut her a "virgin" piece from the center of the roast.  The meat was tender and juicy with great flavor.  Thanks so much for this recipe...it's a keeper!

This was great!  I cooked it just a bit longer (10-15 min) and had a really moist roast that was well browned on the outside.  It smelled wonderful while cooking and was quite easy to prepare.  Will definitely make this again!

The sauce used on this roast was awesome. The only thing I did different was bake it at 275 F with a probe inserted for 160 degrees.  And it was tender and juicy. The best!

I added the 1 tablespoon of tabasco and cooked in the slow cooker with potatoes, onions and carrots.  My husband found it too sweet and couldn't eat too much of it.  Unfortunately my kids thought it was too spicy with the tabasco sauce so I had to throw most of it out.  I don't eat meat, but tried a small bite and thought it was okay.  Probably better suited for those with a sweet tooth!

This was delicious IF you like a sweeter glaze.  I definitely recommend putting the Tbsp of Tabasco in the glaze.  It helped cut the sweetness a bit.  I also made a half batch of the glaze and poured it over a loaf pan full of cut up onions and potatoes and yams.  I baked them next to the pork in the oven.  I would recommend stirring the vegetables a couple times while baking.

That's a keeper!  Definitely guest worthy and I only used cheap syrup.  Next time, I'll go for the real maple syrup to see what all the fuss is about on the other reviews!  =)

Terrific!  I made it in the crock pot (high about 4.5-5 hours) with onions and carrots.  I didn't add the salt and pepper to the sauce (using it instead to season the pork directly, along with some garlic powder) but otherwise made the sauce to recipe.  As another reviewer recommended, I ladled some of the sauce out of the crockpot and reduced it on the stovetop to make a yummy thicker gravy.  I served this with the roast vegetables from the crockpot and hot buttered egg noodles and my family loved it, demanding that I make it again less than a week later.  Yummm!

Absolutely delicious! I bake several pork loins and serve this at church suppers. The maple syrup isn't cheap, but it makes the recipe. I, too, cook my sauce first to make it thicker.

I only give it two stars because I used store bought syrup instead of pure maple syrup, so the taste could have been my fault.  It had a weird smell and taste to it.  I didn't like it at all.  Sorry.

Really tasty and very easy. I halve the ingredients--except for the pork--and that's plenty of sauce, I think.

I made this roast for the first time tonight and it was amazing. The cooking time was longer than an hour in my case. maybe I just wanted to be extra careful. I made glazed carrots and potatoes with the roast and used the leftover drippings as sauce. Even my son who is a very picky eater hat 3 helpings. An amazing easy and delicious dinner. This recipe is a keeper.

This dish was amazing.  I browned the roast first to help lock in all the juices and to give it a little texture on the outside.  I also tried what some other reviews suggested by reducing the liquid mixture first as well as adding the tabasco.  All ideas were perfect. This dish was AMAZING.  I will definitely cook it again but this time, I will invite several friends over.

i would give this a 4.5, needed a little more mustard to cut the sweetness. also, made more than enough, had plenty of extra. i like the suggestion that someone else made, to cook it down before hand, and you dont have to baste as much. otherwise, very tasty. my family loved it!

This was surprisingly (to me) perfect.  One hour and delicious pork roast. I added a sliced vidalia (sweet) onion around the roast and some small new potatoes cut in half.  I also added sliced mushrooms (10) the last half hour or so.  We enjoyed it very much.  Might cut down a bit on the maple syrup next time as it was a tad sweet, but it worked!

YUMMY!!!  I am not normally a pork lover... but this was GOOD!  I didn't have cider vinegar or soy sauce available so I substituted 2 tbsp balsalmic vinegar and teryiaci (sp?) sauce.  Husband raved and I had trouble not going back for thirds!

This is a definate keeper.  My family all loved it.  I made the glaze into a gravy with a tablespoon of flour and water.  Excellent.  My picky eight year must have had at least 3 helpings.  I made half the glaze as I had a smaller roast.  Must use real Canadian Maple Syrup!

This recipe is fabulous!  I put it in a crock pot rather than the oven.  Before placing in the crock pot I rub the roast with a mixture of 1/4 c. flour, 1- 1/2 t. salt, 1 t. pepper. I brown the roast in 1 T. olive oil on all sides then, place the roast in the crock pot, pouring the rest of the ingredients on top (oh, I add 1-1/2 t. Green Pepper Tabasco Sauce).  I use the low setting, and 9 hours later, perfection!  Thanks Christine, my family adores this meal.

Who would have thought that maple and mustard would go so well together?  This turned out fantastic.  The only change I made was to use Chinese hot mustard instead of Dijon because I didn't have any Dijon, and I only used about 2 to 2.5 tablespoons because the Chinese mustard is pretty strong and I didn't want it to overpower the dish.  I also cooked this in my crock pot, as others suggested.  2.5 hours on low to start, and about 2.5 hours on high to finish it, turning once an hour.  The roast got a beautiful brown crusty glaze on the outside that tasted fantastic, and was literally falling apart when I took it out of my slow cooker.  Will definitely make again.

I am a single dad with 24/7 366 custody of 3 boys ranging in age from 9 to 18. All 3 of them said to keep this one and make it again. I did put some hot sauce in it to tame the sweetness with my oldest weighing in at almost 300 pounds he likes sweet things and this was up his alley. You couldn't taste the hot sauce at all. It all blended in together nicely.

I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend is not, and I'm often looking for new recipes I can make for him by throwing some ingredients together and baking something in the oven while I make myself a meatless alternative.   I used local organic maple syrup which made this dish a bit expensive, but it was very easy, and my boyfriend claimed that it tasted "gourmet" and devoured every bite.  I have since also made a pork chop version of this dish to rave reviews as well.  I can't vouch for it firsthand, but it's a frequent request now in our house!

Fabulous! I marinated the pork in a ziplog with the maple and mustard mixture for about 1 hour, took it out and grilled it. Came out very tender!!! Definetely will make it again!

Followed recipe ingredients exactly as listed and then tossed in the slow-cooker on high for 6 hours. Meat was fall-apart tender!!! Sauce thickened nicely & I basted every 45 mins. Served with green beans & rice. Family RAVED about this. Next time, I'll double the recipe because everyone wanted more!!

This could have been marvelous, but the glaze burned in the bottom of the pan. I had it on a rack in a fairly large pan.  Perhaps that was the problem.  I'll try the crock pot or a smaller pan next time.

This was very tasty, sort of reminded me a bit of sweet and sour pork, just minus the pineapples. I reduced the juice down to make a gravy and put red potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the pressure cooker, then put the rack, then put the pork in a glass dish on the rack and cooked on high pressure for 30 min, wow. It was good. We didn't have any leftovers.

This was exceptional and a huge hit!  I used pork tenderloins and did as one person suggested and sprinkled with salt and pepper and seared it in minced garlic first.  Then I placed in a large casserole dish in the oven at 380 (because I was cooking something else with it), cut up an onion into quarters and threw that in too, basted once in awhile (didn't really need much because it ended up sitting in the marinade and juices)...came out extremely tender. Delicious!

This was the Best pork roast I have ever made.  My husband devoured it last night.  Only made a couple changes only because I had to use what I had in the fridge.  I cut up sweet onions and put on bottom of crock pot and then used a Hormel (roast flavor) roast patted dry and needed to use Spicy Brown mustard (all I had) cooked on low for 7-8 hours and then thickened sauce in a pan on the stove with cornstarch while the roast rested, then served on mashed potatoes with asparagus on the side.  Delish.  Will for sure be making this again and again.

This was loved by the kids which I was suprising, they turn their noses up to most new things. I followed the recipe and gave it a 4 star because I found it a little sweet for me, I may try again decreasing the syrup and increasing the soy.

This recipe was a hit. I trimmed all visible fat off the meat and cooked at 300 degrees for about 3.5 hours turning the meat over and glazing every 90 minutes.  It was so tender and the glaze adhered to the meat very nicely.  I made extra glaze for dipping.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

De-lish!!! The glaze does start out very thin, as someone mentioned, so there's no spreading it over the roast. I poured it over then let it marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours before putting it in the oven. The glaze thickens as it cooks. I basted about every 20 minutes or so. Mine was a 4+ pound roast and it took about 2 1/2 hours to get done. I put potatoes and carrots in for the last half hour or so. My whole family loved this. It's a bit rich and real maple syrup isn't cheap these days, so I probably will save this for special occasions from now on. But what a treat!

My husband is still licking his fingers, finishing up his dinner. I followed the instructions but basted the pork loin every 15 minutes as someone suggested. It took about 2 hours to cook through, but it turned out juicy and tender. We'll definitely be making this again.

I am giving this 4 stars but I would only give it 3 if it were up to just me. My husband gives it a 5, but he didn't have to cook it. I used a 3 pound roast. I know it's slightly bigger than the recipe states, but, seriously, after 2 and 1/2 hours, it wasn't up to 160 yet and it was still raw in the middle. I needed to serve dinner because my husband was starving so I sliced it up, layed the slices on a cookie sheet, glazed them and put them back in for 15 minutes so they would be done all the way through. I guess I would make this again since my husband liked it so much but I really didn't think it had much flavor. I don't eat a lot of meat because I don't like "meat" taste. So, when I do eat meat, I like it to have a TON of flavor. This really just tasted like meat. If I did this again, I would probably use the crock pot on high for 3-4 hours. I would also cut the amount of glaze in half. I basted every 20 minutes and still had about 1/2 left over.

I don't eat pork, but I made this for my husband and sons - they all said it was a keeper! Since it's almost impossible to please them all with the same recipe, I'm guessing it's really good. I followed another suggestion and roasted some vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, onions and celery) in a separate pot with some of the reserved glaze - yummy!

This is a nice recipe.  I made as written except I added some garlic powder and onion powder on the roast before pouring the glaze on.  I thought the glaze was actually quite thick because of the syrup, but I did start off with about 1/3 on the roast and then basted a couple more times.  Very flavorful, although I cooked some carrots with it and didn't like the glaze on them.  Next time I'll do them separately.  My roast was done in an hour (carrots weren't).

I took the advice of others and basted my pork roast every 20 minutes.  I made another batch of the "glaze" 1/2 way during cooking time b/c I was scared all the glaze was evaporating....I'm glad I did b/c we had plenty to pour over rice which was excellent.  Will make again.  Thanks!

tried this recipe tonight and got a thumbs up, I used a rack of pork, cooked it for 2 hours, basting with the sauce every 15 minutes didn't add any salt in the sauce as the soy sauce makes it  salty enough for us....fantastic will be using thie recipe often.

Made this tonight and I must say it's not very good. First of all the "glaze" is not a glaze at all. Using the term glaze, implies that it is a thick coating that will stick to the meat. This is not the case, it is nothing more than a thin marinade. After about 20 minutes, I could tell all it was going to do was burn on the bottom of my pan, so I decided to slice up my loin into chops. You could taste the "glaze" somewhat, but the meat was very very dry. I would highly recommend that you marinate this and then boil down whats left before cooking. This should reduce it greatly and turn it into an actual glaze!

This is by far one of my favorite pork recipes! I to use pancake syrup (never seem to have real maple on hand), I also tend to  change it up a little bit with some crushed red peppers, carmalized onions, and I place garlic halves inside the skin of the pork. I only baste it 1 or 2 times and I also don't cover it, and never had a problem with the juices!

Excellent!  Without a roasting bag, I used a roasting pan with lid.  I also used yellow mustard for lack of dijon.  I never would have come of with the ingredient combination on my own.  Thanks!

Pork turned out very tasty and was a hit with my family.  I did make a couple changes: 1) Left in the oven for an additional 30 minutes 2) Used regular yellow mustard (didn't have dijon available  The dish turned out fine and everyone in my family enjoyed.  One change I'll try in the future is to seer the pork prior to putting in the oven to have an even juicier cut.

It was okay. The flavour was good but it didn't leave me breathless as I had anticipated. Served it with brown rice and brussell sprouts.

I had my very first dinner party and made this dish.  I have never cooked pork tenderloin, ever before.  This recipe was so easy, and delicious.  I got rave reviews from all my guests.  One of my friends said she never likes pork, however she liked this so much, she had three pieces! Great recipe:)

I love this recipe. Just tossed one in the oven to serve my MIL for Easter/birthday dinner, we'll see how she likes it! Even my husband, who "doesn't eat pork roast" has been raving about the maple/mustard glazed roast since I made it a few weeks ago. You'd have thought I'd done a magic trick or something, "Maple and mustard?! Who knew?" Anyway, I've made this three times now and I use pancake syrup. Shoot me! pure maple is really expensive and ime the pancake syrup works,too.

This is fantastic. The meat was tender and the flavor was excellent. My husband and teenage sons loved it. I did not baste it or cover it. The meat was moist and tender and the juices did not burn in the baking dish. After the tenderloin rested about 5 minutes, I slice it and laid the pieces back in the juice to soak up the sauce. I also spooned a small amount of the sauce over the meat. I didn’t find a need to brown the meat first. The original recipe worked perfectly as it is. This is a very easy recipe that would be great for company and easy enough for beginners.

This recipe was AMAZING!!!!  and was great served with roasted red potatoes. All my family loved it, I have cooked a lot of pork, but never with maple syrup, what a wonderful idea!  I will pass this one on to friends/family. Thank You.

Outstanding.  I doubled the recipe (but not the pork) and it was fantastic.  I didn't have real maple syrup so I used pancake syrup.  It was a little sweet, but outstanding.  Next time I will buy real maple syrup and try that.  I cooked it at 200 for an hour and then turned up to 350 for an hour.  I basted every 20 to 30 minutes.  Will make this again!

I ended up doubling this recipe and used a 5lb Pork.   I figured I would have left overs!   They only leftovers I had was from the drippings I used to make gravy :)

This recipe is OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD! I slow cooked pork loins (185 degrees) and marinated them every hour or so with this glaze. When they were finished cooking, I put them under the broiler for 5 minutes or so to crisp up the outside. Served the pork at my husband's birthday party and people raved at how good this was!

I decided to try this out for a Sunday dinner.  My family loves it!  I am not a big pork roast fan, but this recipe is incredibly delicious.  Several members of my family wanted to drink the leftover glaze. :)  I will be making this often.

I just made this for my family. It was a huge success! I didn't have any cider vinegar so i substituted rice vinegar, but don't think the result was altered at all by this. The maple dijon mustard glaze is amazing. I'm so tempted to try it out on some other meats!   All in all this is a fabulous recipe. Even my younger brother who is typically a picky eater, loved it.

My Husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. The flavor was very good. I did reduce the sauce a bit before adding to the roast and baking. I also reserved a little to add at the very end. I think next time I may try making this in the crock pot like some others suggested. Will difinetly make again!

This was extremely easy to prepare and very tasty.  I didn't have good maple syrup on hand, so I used pancake syrup.  It was a little sweet and not as thick, but still great.  I basted frequently.  Next time I might add a little crushed red pepper to kick it up a notch and balance out the sweetness.  Definitely a repeat!

This was a awesome recipe.I used a 2/12 pound boneless boston butt pork roast and I took the sugestion from someone who upped the heat in the oven to 425º for the first 20 minutes and then continued cooking at 375º for 40 minutes. I also had to cook it for 30 minutes more due to the internal temperature was only at 140º. I also roasted some onions in the marinade while it was cooking. Will definately make again.

This was some slow-cooking deliciousness. I have a roasting pan, but I was too lazy to get it out last night. So, I set it in the slow-cooker on high and let it go. After I browned the meat, it developed a beautiful crust and was absolutely delicious. The menfolk were mighty impressed!

This recipe was great! I made it for the first time for friends, which is always nerve racking but they ate every bite of my 4 lb roast! I also cooked it in my slow cooker. It took about 4 1/2 hours for a 4 lb roast. I will definetly be making this again!

This is great. I followed the recipe to a T. However, I would suggest putting down a piece of foil on your baking sheet. The sauce burned on me and my baking sheet. Luckily I was able to save and man was this super tasty and tender.

I basted the roast several times, but the glaze did not glaze it at all, it just burned on the bottom of the pan.  It is too thin and doesn't stick, so the pork had no flavor and now I have some serious srubbing to do.  Not worth it.

EXCELLENT!  I have to say that I have never had my husband RAVE the way he has about this recipe.  He said over and over that it is "THE BEST" pork recipe EVER.  The only thing I changed was..I did not have Dijon mustard on hand, so I had to substitute with Honey mustard dressing.  I also had to cook my 2.29 LB roast for 1 hour 35 minutes.  It turned out soo yummy.

Maybe I did something wrong.  The glaze burned up in the oven (even with me basting it) and stunk up the whole house.  It didn't turn out tasty or juicy as I had hoped.

This is an amazing dish!! I usually can't get my kids to eat pork roasts and they loved this! I will be making this again. I put it in the slow cooker on low for about 8 hours and it just fell apart. I sliced the leftovers and it made great sandwhichs!!

FAB-U-LOUS!!  I was a little skeptical at first because of all the maple syrup, but it turned out delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was, the only difference was I marinated overnight and slow cooked it in a 285 degree oven for 3 hours.  I could barely get it out of the pan because it fell apart so I served it shredded with a little of the leftover juices drizzled over the top and my husband and family went nuts over it!

This was excellent!  I did it in the Crockpot and was very pleased with the results.  The leftovers are very versatile.  I shredded up the roast and mixed some in with the liquid for a maple "BBQ" pork sandwich which was VERY yummy.  I also used some of the shredded pork in spagetti sauce.  The sweet went well in the sauce and my kids asked for seconds and thirds!  I'll definitely make this one again!

Used it for our 5-family meal exchange group.  I used cheap pork loin medallions which were a poor choice :-(  But the flavor was GREAT and everyone loved it.  Get some nice loin and trim it well.

A very nice, easy recipe.  The only addition I made to the marinade was a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic.  I even froze the roast in the marinade and it thawed and cooked beautifully.  Like some of the other posters I cooked mine in my slow cooker...thank you!

Very good. I used a 3 lb roast and cooked for 2 hours - that was a little long, I think next time I will cook at 325 for 1.5 hours. The sauce was great, I marinated the pork in the sauce for about 6 hours - I think I will try it on pork chops.

Made this recipe the other night and my husband loved it. I did not have cider vinegar, so I used White Wine vinegar, don't know if the changed the flavor any but it was really good. I also added garlic powder to the marinade and put everything in a plastic bag along with the pork roast and marinated it for about an hour. This made the sause thicker, so I did not need to add any cornstarch. Will definately make this again.

I'm very happy I found this recipe. It has a wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, with two exceptions-My roast was a bit under 2 pounds, so I cut down the cooking time and I rubbed garlic powder/salt/pepper on roast before pouring over liquid. 
My family is very picky and all three said "This new meat has a great flavor". The roast was tender and very flavorful-Great Recipe.

Amazing!  I added a tbs of hot sauce as suggested by other users and then simmered the glaze for a gravy after the roast was done.  This was moist, tender and very flavorful.  Everyone from my picky sister to my hispanic brother-in-law to my eat-anything man enjoyed this dish!

This turned out way better than I thought it would. When I was mixing it, it looked like such an odd combo of tastes that I was sure we'd be ordering pizza in! But its great! I added a bit of tobassco like someone suggested below and will do this again. When you roast it with veggies it waters down the glaze a bit so I suggest doing your veggies in a different pan. Oh and by the way... SUPER TENDER AND MOIST!

FABULOUS!! I am not the best with roasts, or pork, I always seem to overcook it- I made this recipe because I wanted to try something different. I used a meat thermometer so that I wouldn't cook it too long....it was the best roast I've ever made.  My whole family including my boys (6yrs & 9yrs) gobbled it up and my husband thought it was fantastic. The only thing I did different, was take all the "sauce" from the roasting pan and add a small amount of cornstarch and water to thicken it up (was a little watery) and we used that on the side.  We really didn't need much since the meat was so tender and flavorful, but it was just such a nice touch. I will make this again really soon!

My family loves this recipe. It is simple and elegant. I have made it several times and never had a dry roast. I do baste it about every 20-30 minutes while cooking and it does take longer than 1 hr.

This was sweet and delicious! I didnt have cider vinegar so I used white (it was fine) and I didn't have any dijon so I just used Frenches and that was also completely acceptable. Wonderful treat, very sweet, I will be making this again
Note: Because I was cooking other items at the same time, it took an additional hour to cook the Roast all the way through, but I think that was on my part.

I was a bit hesitant after reading this recipe.  It seemed like the meat would be so dry without being covered.  I decided to make it following the directions anyway and boy was I wrong!!  My family loved it!!  It was tender and the sauce was so good!!  We didn't think it was too sweet like some others had thought.  My finicky 4 year old had 2 helpings!!  And really that says it all!!  She usually won't even try meat!!  She kept saying, "Delicious!!".  I will absolutely make this again!!

I used a pre-marinated pork loin (honey mustard), so that added some flavor.  Had I not, the would have done some sort or rub - the glazed doesn't impart much flavor into the meat.  The glaze is an excellent compliment to the pork loin.

This was so wonderful and delicious! I used this on a pork loin tip; I only had 1/2 cup of real maple syrup, so I added the other 1/2 cup of Mrs. Butterworths, it came out great. I loved the aroma of it when cooking. Definately a keeper!!!!!

I made this with the same ingredients and changed only by making in my crock pot.  I cooked for 90 min on high and reduced to low for the remainder. My husband thought it was OK--a little sweet.  My son enjoyed seconds, however, it was too sweet for me.  I will try the shredded pork left over recipe suggested and see how that turns out.

I would give this a 5 but my boyfriend said 3.5 so I guess it gets a 4.  I thought this was so quick and easy and it makes great leftovers.  My roast was 2.5 lbs and it cooked for about 1.5hrs.  I did think the glaze was very runny but I just basted the roast every so often while it was cooking.  After the roast was done we cut it up and put it in a big serving bowl and poured the sauce over it.  Yummy.

THis was really good!  I bought sliced pork and put all this in a crockpot and let it cook on low for 4 hours.  I made gravy out of the sauce it was in.  When cooking this in a crockpot, I would use only 1.5 pounds.  You need to double the recipe if using more than 1.5 pounds of sliced pork.  I would also add some water to make the sauce go further, and I added some Brown Sugar for a sweeter taste.

This was easy, and the glaze tasted great, but the flavor didn't get into the meat as much as I would have liked.  The roast was a little dry, but that may be my fault.  Next time I'll use the glaze on porkchops instead.

This is good and the flavor was GREAT.  Next time I will double the sauce and make into gravy as others suggested.  I did mine in the crock pot on low for 8 hrs as some others suggested and I think mine was way over done.  Seemed a little dry.  I just put the sauce over it and that helped.  Will try again but not in the crock pot.

Fabulous!!!!  Thank you so much for this great recipe.  This was one of the best pork dishes we have ever eaten!  Even my 3 and 6 year olds cleared their plates. Will be making this again and again.

I've made this recipe several times and my husband really likes it.  I know it says to use real maple syrup, but I've had just as much success with the "maple flavored" kind.  You might decrease the amount a little, since the imitation stuff tends to be a bit sweeter.  But we like it alot just as is.

I liked this a lot but my husband wasn't fond of the sweetness.  Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the salt and used low-sodium soy sauce.  Will make it again but not ofter.

Great! I did however, not have dijon so I used Deli Mustard/Guldens and added garlic. I used a sage seasoning mix when I browned the roast as someone suggested then proceded to cook as reccommended. I saved about 1/4 of the basting liquid and reduced it and poured over the meat after slicing.

Tender and tasty.  As other users have noted, the glaze is thin.  Used red wine vinegar, instead of cider, and 'roasted' on the grill in a pan.  Reserved half glaze and basted when almost done.  Good flavor. Maybe next time I will thicken the glaze with cornstarch to help it stick.  Much of the sauce ended up dried up on the bottom of the pan.  Would be better on the meat.  ;o)

i used my crock pot for this. Glaze was more like a sauce in consistency, but excellent. The meat was falling off the bone tender- served it much like pulled pork, since it wouldn't slice. Everyone raved about the taste.

Cooked in large corningware and the meat was 1/2-3/4 submerged in sauce.  Added sliced apples and used the fake maple syrup (Aunt Jemima).  Everyone liked it, will probably make again.

I used a pork tenderloin for this recipe and took the advice below and seasoned pork with salt, garlic and sage before placing 1/2 glaze over meat.  Then filled the pan with root vegetables to roast.  Before putting in the oven, I mixed flour with leftover glaze, heated it in the microwave and then spooned over meat.  Found it stuck better once thickened.  Execellent recipe and very easy to make!

This was very good. I increased the mustard by about 2 Tbs.  I sprinkled the roast with freshly ground pepper and didn't add any additional salt (soy sauce is enough).  It made plenty of sauce.  I basted two 3 lb. roasts during roasting and thickened the remaining sauce on the stove top.  I sliced the roast and drizzled the reduced sauce over before serving.  Everyone raved!

This was easy and I was able to spend time with my guests as it cooks itself.  I did end up rubbing the pork all over with sage, s & p as suggested by earlier review.  Pork turned out well and I had left over glaze to serve to the guests.

I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked this in a slow cooker.  I rubbed the roast with salt and pepper, minced onion and garlic then put some glaze on the bottom of the cooker to coat it and then poured the rest of the glaze on top of the roast.  I let it cook in the slow cooker for about 4.5 hrs for a 5lb roast and it was amazing.  The pork was so tender it just fell apart.  This was my first time making a pork roast and everyone who ate it was just amazed.  Will use this recipe again.  Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe.

This was good - much better than the normal dried up pork roast.  Sweet and savory.

Delicious and easy. Even my picky kids like it. I had to bake the roast an extra 1/2 hour. I also poured only part of the glaze on the roast intitally. Every time I checked it I poured more glaze on top. I am glad I lined the pan. The glaze scorced on the bottom.

I served this at a dinner with some friends, everyone loved it.  I didn't have cider vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar instead.  The pork came out great, nice and juicy.  I poured the left over marinade on grilled asparagus, what a treat! Thanks Christine!

This is sooo good - you won't be disappointed! I agree that only real maple syrup should be used here, otherwise it would be too sweet. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I pierced the roast all over before pouring the glaze on. I also basted it during cooking as others suggested. It turned out perfectly delicious. Thanks for sharing!
