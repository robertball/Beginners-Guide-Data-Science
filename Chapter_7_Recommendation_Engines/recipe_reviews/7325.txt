Since this recipe received such mixed reviews I wasn't sure of the a good end result, however I mixed it up and baked it in a 8-inch diameter cake pan and after tooth picking it several times ended up leaving it in for around 15min+ the original time. However it was such a great cake, the icing that goes along with it is complementary and I received compliments on it. 

So my tip is not using the given time and tooth picking it until it is done.

This is just like the sour cream cake my mother made. The first time I made this, it was dry and overdone, but after cutting 5-10 minutes off the baking time it has turned out perfect. Check by inserting a toothpick in center for doneness. I use a pint of sweet cream, sour 1Â½ cups with vinegar, and use the other 1/2 cup sweet cream in the frosting in place of the milk. Wonderful, wonderful cake! Moist and rich, and the frosting is like creamy fudge. Kaye

What in the world did I do wrong??  Could not mistake the OVERPOWERING baking soda taste that left a TANG on your tongue.  Sadly, I had to throw the whole cake out.  What did I do wrong?  I could have messed up....

My family and I enjoyed the spongy texture of this cake. Based on other reviews, I checked it at 25 minutes and found that it was ready, otherwise it would have been overcooked at 35 minutes.  

I didn't use the icing recipe, preferring to make an easier-to-prepare cream cheese icing: 8oz cream cheese 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa and 1 tsp vanilla extract whipped together until smooth.

I have made this cake numerous times and it was ALWAYS a success!!! It is very moist!!!! However I did add a couple of things once just to spice it up....I made it a 3 layer cake and filled the layers in with chocolate and pushed some crushed oreos around the edges of the chocolate frosting and sprinkled some on top as well....it was gone in a matter of minutes...NO LIE!!! But the cake recipe itself is one i swear by!!!

I doubled the amount of cocoa in this recipe and I loved it.  It goes well with Peanut Butter frosting.

I was so disappointed especially after reading the positive comments. I followed the recipe to the letter. I do agree that the cake isn't overly sweet, but the cake has a gummy texture, it tested done with a knife. I also don't think there was enough of a chocolate flavour to the cake. I was more pleased with the frosting but I would use less shortening I found it a little greasy. I found putting the saucepan in a bowl of ice-water and using my electric hand beater an effective way to cool and thicken the frosting. I don't think I will be making this cake again. But nothing ventured nothing gained.

very easy to make and delicious! Cake itself is not that sweet, and having the frosting is essential; the guests would pour as much frosting as they want to adjust for their taste.

This cake is good, and it is moist.  It just didn't have as much chocolate "punch" as I was looking for.  I will make it again, though.

So simple and so delicious! I made this for a get together with friends and family and I had more than one person comment on how yummy the cake was and go back for seconds.  I used a cream cheese frosting that really complimented the flavor of the cake, but didn't over power it.  I really like how not extra sweet this cake is.  I will be making this one again!

I was very pleased with this cake. My family loved it. I used fat free sour cream. I bet it would have been better with regular sour cream.

Make a different cake, but the fudge icing was spot-on!!
Perfect balance of sweet & chocolate for my taste, the salt & vanilla notes further enhanced the balanced flavour.
I also substituted unsalted butter + a tablespoon of coconut oil, for  the shortening.

It had no flavour of chocolate and was very dry. I will not make it again. I cooked it only 30 minutes and thought it was not done enough but took it out of the oven anyway . It was over done.
