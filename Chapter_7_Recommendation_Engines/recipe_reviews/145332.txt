These muffins are very tasty...The only things I did differntly were;added an extra spoonful of peanut butter and only 1/4 cup of oil...I also cooked them at 350 for 20minutes...They are kind of hard to get out of the pan though..very soft

These were o.k.  My family ate them and said they were good however they did not eat them with the same zeal as all my other baking.  I also found there very fussy to make and had to clean my oven after.  Not Fun!  I would suggest that when making them reduce the amount of jam filling the the center and stretch out the batter to make 14 -16 muffins as they really rise and overflowed the pan and the filling oozed out too.

These turned out fantastic!  They are not over sweet, just sweet enough.  I only put about a tsp of jam into each muffin, and I did not sprinkle the sugar on top.  They turned out very nice, the tops were perfectly crispy.  Great quick easy recipe, I made these while my newborn napped!

I followed the exact recipe and these were just OK.  Nothing to rave about but not that bad.  I probably won't make them again.

AMAZING! These are so addictive! I want to eat 5 of these in a row. The jam didn't stay right in the middle, but I knew they wouldn't, and they look fine if it doesn't. I suggest baking them at 350 degrees like others have also suggested. I did, and they turned out perfectly that way. I also mixed all the sugar in with the batter, instead of sprinkling it on top, and it turned out fine. YUMMMYYY!!!

Family loved them. After reading about jam-splattering issues; I made wells in the batter when filling cups half-full, put in the jam, and only topped the muffin cups with enough batter to cover and "seal in" the jam, not all of the remaining batter (I had 1 and a half cups of batter left over for the next batch). This is a bit more time-consuming, but the jam stayed in the muffins and did not splatter. 

I agree that the muffins could be more peanutty, so the second time I added a 1/4 cup more pb and some honey-roasted peanuts for a little crunch.  Just make sure you serve the muffins with a big glass of milk!

I live in Colorado about 5k from sea level, and I have had problems with homemade muffins before so I am not sure how much is altitude or the recipe. My muffins were crumbly very crumbly. And the peanut butter muffin part was very thick. Just didn't have the right balance. But we still ate them all!

These are pretty simple to make, and my kids really liked them for their after school snack.  I tried just a bite, and found them to be a little dry.  Overall, a good recipe.

they do taste like PB&J sandwiches, not too bad...but I don't fancy the mess...the spilling of the jam makes my muffin tray really tough to clean.

I only used 2 teaspoons of baking powder--I made no other changes. When filling the muffin cups, I was careful to fill the muffin cups with only 1/3 cup of batter before spooning in jam. I then divided the rest of the batter between the 12 muffin cups. Baked at 350*, these muffins were done at 22 minutes. I got exactly 12 biggish muffins out of one recipe. The family enjoyed these. NOTE: I was able to use store-brand peanut butter in this recipe. Sometimes, when you bake with non name brand peanut butter, you get unsavory results. Not so with this recipe.

I made these muffins for my husband and everyone at work and they constantly beg for more.  I am however more generous with the peanut butter than what the recipe calls for which makes it even better

My 11 year old son made this with some help from me.  The kids LOVE them.  I added more peanut butter and cooked at 350 instead of 375 and they really came out perfect.

Wow!!!! Soooo good! Made these delightful muffins as a "mom and me" project with my four year old son!!! We both loved them! I found that I didn't have the jam explode at all .... also I found them very moist and good!!!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe! I did add a spoonful or two more of peanut butter and cooked them for 20 mintues at 350* as per a suggestion in one of the other comments!!!! I will be adding these to my regular recipes!!!! Thanks for this great recipe!!!

I didn't care for these. The muffins were super dense and the jam ran out of the muffins. I didn't think that the flavor made up for any of the negatives in this recipe. Not worth making again.

I've made this twice, and everyone loved it. The first time the jelly exploded everywhere, and it was stillna hit. The second time, I made little wells and then covered them with the remaining batter, and the looked perfect. No explosion. I never use baking cups, I buy stop n shop brand cooking spray WITH FLOUR and spray in the cups and all over the top. No matter what I cook, nothing ever sticks. I felt even with the suggested amount of jelly, they are a little dry. I think I'm gonna mix jelly in the batter as well as in the center next time. I'll let u know how it turns out.

The flavor was dissapointing.  Use more peanut butter instead of the added oil.

Very Very Yummy!! Children really enjoyed. Had small amount of spillage onto oven bottom but my 3 and 4 year old helped so some where fuller then others. I should have used muffin cups can't get them out of the pan to well. Absolutely love them!!!

Love the taste of these muffins! Not too sweet, and good PB flavor. Nice moist texture, too. Cooking temp seems high to me - burnt them the first time around at the minimum cooking time. Will be baking them at 350 next time. I didn't have ANY spillage problem like another reviewer. They just puffed up nicely.

These were ok. Mine also spilled out the top and I didnt even use as much jelly. If I were to make them again I would half the peanut butter and even less jelly too. They were good but just a bit too much

These weren't bad, but they weren't very good either.  I don't think the extra oil is necessary.  The muffins are very heavy.

Being a diabetic, I made these muffins with splenda and sugar free jelly but the taste was still wonderful!
