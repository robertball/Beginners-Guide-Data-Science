Very good light dip. Disregard the nuts if you want less carbs/lighter dip. Even better if you use honey mustard it really adds to the sweet peppers.

I was intrigued by the ingredients in this recipe. I made it as per the instructions but it didn't turn out well at all. It was very bland and too runny. I'm not sure what happened but I don't think I'll make it again.

I love this recipe! I use it for a sandwich spread on whole wheat bread This time I made it with jarred red peppers because there were no fresh ones to be had. It came out fine but slightly softer so I added more cashews.

This recipe is ok. I made half the recipe with cashews and half without and the recipe again without cashews and both tasted about the same. I put in more cashews than the recipe called for but I still could hardly taste them! All in all it's a decent spread but not quite what I was hoping for.

Great low calorie spread. No one even knows it's made of tofu.

Great tasting spread/dip. I had some on burger and some I used as a chip dip. I did add more cashews. If I hadnt been having this with salty chips I would have added some salt... aside from the soy sauce

This came out really bland. I ended up adding garlic and about triple the soy sauce and Dijon and the end result was ok.. definitely not what I'd hoped for but not awful.
