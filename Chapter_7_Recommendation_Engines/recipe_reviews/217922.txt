This recipe was very simple. After I topped the oatmeal with the pecan mixture in our bowls, we just poured a little cold fat free evaporated milk over the top and ate it like that, instead of yogurt. We loved it. For us, there were no leftovers. Between my two boys and I, we ate every little bit. It was wonderful.

Wow - this is really good and very filling! This makes a lot so you'll definitely have enough leftover for future mornings. But, if you like carrot cake that won't be a problem! I cut back on the ginger and added some vanilla. I used a combination of walnuts and pecans, plus since I like things a bit sweeter I used vanilla yogurt vs. plain yogurt. I may add a little crushed pineapple to the reheated oatmeal for even more of  a "carrot cake" taste and to up the sweet factor. Thanks for a great recipe!

What a great idea! So Yummy.  I didn't have steel cut oats, so I cooked all the ingredients except the oats, until soft, then added quaker oats and cooked for the time listed on the package.

Really good and really filling. It needs a little something I can't put my finger on, so I'll peruse the other reviews and see if someone has already found the answer. I may even need to double the carrot! Next time I'll also add a little less apple. It tastes fine, but it overpowered the carrot. I also cut the raisins. 
It was nice and easy to make it the night before, and reheat it for about a minute and half the next morning.I just have rolled oats instead of steel-cut, and halving the recipe and adjusting a few ingredients yielded me a nice, full breakfast. I dolloped it with nonfat Greek yogurt, and it was a nice touch. I'll certainly make this again, but try - just for fun - using instead a dollop of nonfat cream cheese! Both option sound awesome to me. 
I cut the ginger in half, cause even though I love ginger, it seemed like a bit much, and the ginger flavor I got was perfect! Subtle enough that it wasn't overpowering, but as a ginger-lover strong enough to give a tasty zing to the dish. 
Once I find what this needs, I'll update and re-rate this review accordingly. Until then, I still say this is a great addition to my breakfast rotation!
UPDATE: Definitely double the carrot! Also, the tip of adding a little pineapple juice is a small change that makes a great difference! Highly suggested. I also tried topping with nonfat cream cheese that I whipped with a few drops of vanilla. That was SO good! Fat free whipped topping prepared the same way would be good too!

This sounded so good, but unfortunately, we didn't care for it. The ginger overpowered and gave it a rather pungent taste and left an aftertaste.  If I were to make this again, I would completely omit the ginger and maybe even reduce the amount of nutmeg.  The other ingredient that overpowers are the raisins.  I reduced the amount to 2 Tbsp. and still felt as if all I were eating were raisins.  Had I added the full 1/2c, the entire bowl would have been nothing but raisins.

Steel-cut oats are great for a big batch that lasts all week. Usually I make mine plain and 'accessorize' by the bowl. A whole batch of one flavor is a big commitment! Thankfully I love carrot cake.  The flavor is pretty good - with the yogurt, you really get a carrot cake essence for breakfast.  This is not at all a sweet oatmeal - not like how most people enjoy a packet of instant oatmeal.  I suspect many will add sugar (or sweetened yogurt?) to the final dish.  And I personally will use half as much nutmeg next time - it was overpowering to me (and possibly increase the carrots).  But overall a great change from the norm.

So delicious! I mixed in a teaspoon of cream cheese to give it even more of a carrot cake feel.

Yummy!! Used my Zojirushi rice cooker and put everything in up to the pecans.  Delish and easy for my family who eat breakfast at different times of the day. Family ate it all the first day, but should keep in your cooker for at least 2 days.

Tastes just like carrot cake when you add the yogurt just not as sweet as the real think.  Will keep in my frequently made file.

I combined all ingredients except the pecans and yogurt, and left everything in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours.  Added garnish in the morning and it was DELICIOUS!

I have to be honest, I'm not great in the kitchen so I'm always reluctant to cook for others. However, after eating my first batch of this oatmeal I felt comfortable feeding it to my family. They enjoyed it as much as I did. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really liked this, except I like my oatmeal pretty sweet, so I added an extra Tablespoon of brown sugar and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  Will make it again!

Really great recipe to kick off a cold wet morning. Hearty and filling. I was hesitant at first about making the entire recipe as six servings is a lot, but then I realized I could make it and keep it in the fridge to reheat for another breakfast so I went ahead without scaling it down.  I made as written but did not prepare the pecans, instead just topping with some chopped walnuts. For me, it needed some sweetener mixed right in, as well as vanilla yogurt instead of plain. I would add a little vanilla extract next time as well. I wasn't sure about the spices as they seemed too strong at first, but after a few bites I was loving it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used oat groats instead of steel cut oats.  The apple and raisins made this sweet enough without sugar.  I made this dairy free, so avoided the butter and yogurt. This great spicy smelling cereal made breakfast fun!

Pretty easy, really. Just a little bit of prep.
My changes:
Less ginger and nutmeg per other reviews 
Added 1 tsp of vanilla and about 1 T of brown sugar
Skipped yogurt 
Skipped sugaring the nuts
Served with coconut milk from a carton and chopped walnuts. 4 yr old ate 3 bowls after crying about it containing carrots, LOL

This recipe is very delicious, I love carrot cake and this is exactly what carrot cake oatmeal should taste like. All the ingredients compliment each other very well and I definitely recommend this recipe especially if you are busy most mornings, you can make one batch and it will last you a couple of mornings!

Very nice.  I cooked my oats in a mixture of water and coconut milk (cutting back to a little over 3 cups, because I like it thicker).  I cut back on the amount of spice but did add some cardamom and allspice to the mix...probably about a teaspoon and a half total spice mixture.  I should have chopped my apple more finely...my apple pieces didn't get soft enough, and I added a good dose of vanilla.  My time was limited, so I skipped the pecans (I will definitely try them next time), and I didn't use the yogurt this time, either.  This is a keeper for me, though, and I'll definitely make again.  Great idea!

Oh my goodness this was delicious!!!  I added a little bit more brown sugar and butter (to mix with the brown sugar) and used walnuts because I didn't have pecans in the house, but wow was this ever good!  I would eat it every morning, and just might do this! :)  Thanks for sharing!

This was fine, but nothing special.  I typically make steel cut oatmeal with chopped apples and cinnamon; we like that better.  I think this recipe is lacking in the spices; might try it again and double the spices.

Mmmmmmm Love this recipe!  I don't change a thing, but have varied the nuts depending on what I have on hand.  Slivered almonds and walnuts work well too.

Great idea since steel cut oats are bland on their own.  I will make again with less ginger.  Also, I will remove the pan from heat when adding the brown sugar to the pecans.  I got a burnt sugar effect though husband loved it. We all liked the extra textures of the apples and pecans.

This was very good. I used almond milk instead of regular milk. I agree with the comments about the ginger. I just sprinkled a little in and it was still a pretty strong taste. Next time I won't add any ginger.

I thought it was yummy.  I used quick steel cut oats, and used much less ginger as another person suggested.  
I ate it with a drizzle of maple syrup and cream- delicious.

YUMMY!! The only thing I changed was replaced raisins with cranberries only because my husband doesn't like raisins.  tried the yogurt on top but preferred without it.  My family stirred in some brown sugar and had extra helpings.  Definitely a keeper!  THANKS U for sharing

Loved this!!! Like a lot of you I modified it a little... I used wheatberries instead of oats and currants instead of raisins. I also added a capful of vanilla and a half tsp of pumpkin pie spice inplace of the individual spices. I did however still add the tsp of cinnamon. I followed the advice of others and doubled the shredded carrots.  Turned out fantastic!

I do *not* like oatmeal.  I try to make myself eat it, though, and I thought this was wonderful.  I had to use regular old fashioned oats, so as others had suggested, I simply cooked them for a few minutes before adding the oats.  I do wish I had used a better apple.  I used Red Delicious (all I had on had) and while it gave texture, it really didn't add much flavor.  Next time I'll use a Granny Smith or other tart apple.  Thank you so much for recipe.

This was very good. One of the spices seemed to come through a little too much but I couldn't pick it out and I think I would like a little more carrot. I used empire apple and the only change I made was using dried tart cherries (I don't care for raisins much) I don't care for "regular" oatmeal and love instant so I was hesitant to try this but this was a good pick for my first use of steel cut oats and definitely a keeper. I should also say that I have never had carrot cake so I can't compare the flavor.

Loved this! Did use a touch of brown sugar for an extra sweetness.

Great recipe!  I made this in a small crockpot.  My husband has cancer and has to have something in his tummy before taking medicine so I make oatmeal, put it in the fridge, and he warms it up every morning.  This is one of the better recipes I have found for a variation.  We didn't add the nuts or yogurt but I bet it would be great!

Never serve a new recipe to company without trying it first!  This was watery and somewhat tasteless.  It was slightly better the second day.  I used mostly cinnamon since I don't like ginger, but I added pumpkin pie spice.  I made a topper of cream cheese, vanilla, and sugar, which did add flavor, and which has become my favorite bagel spread!

This turned out FAB-ulous!!! by far awesome. I have to thank some members on the forum for help with locating some recipes for my vegan/vegetarian SIL and celiac MIL. I prepped this recipe for a road trip vacation with the family...so it was easy to assemble, easy to follow. And totally easy to make. This was a total hit with myself, my inlaws and one of my kiddo's....the flavor just popped, the fruit just tantalized the taste buds, it needed just a tad bit of sugar in my bowl, but no butter was needed, and used a coconut milk non-dairy based yogurt to top with the pecans.....It's going to be a staple. It was just raving good! I can't say much more on how excellent it is and turned out. TY TY!!!

Great way to get both fruit, veggies, and a whole grain in first thing in the morning in a not-too-sweet dish! Didn't have steel cut oats, so I used old fashioned,adjusted the oats to water ratio, grated the apple along with the carrot and cooked it all up in the microwave for about 2 1/2 minutes.  Didn't use butter and dry roasted up some pecans.  Added the brown sugar to plain fat free greek yogurt.  Only took minutes to prepare and a very nice sweetness from the fruit.

I am not a fan of oatmeal but my Hubs is.  To try this out I made half the recipe, cutting back on the raisins to 2 T.  I also cut the nutmeg to 1/8 t. and the ginger to 1/4 t.  I diced the apple (about 1/4” dice) to make sure it would soften during the cooking time.  Be sure to stir from time to time and more often towards the end of the simmering time, or it will begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, and could burn.  I skipped the glazed pecans this time, but I’m sure they’d be wonderful with this.  I froze this in individual microwaveable containers.  Thaw and then microwave for a quick breakfast.  Hubs gives this five stars, so I’m sure I’ll be making it again.

LOVE this!  I did cut back on the nutmeg (probably only used 1/4 tsp.).  Since I didn't have plain yogurt, I decided to use toasted vanilla coconut yogurt, which I thought went well with the other carrot cake flavors and it added just a touch more sweetness.  Thanks!

Really pleased! I had regular old fashioned oats (not steel cut) so I used 2cups oats and substituted the 4 cups of water with 2 cups of water and 2 cups of milk to make it a little creamier

I always appreciate when people put themselves out there when they share a recipe because you never know how people are going to respond. I really like this recipe(love steel cut oats) - would not have thought of this combination of ingredients.  After reading other reviewers' comments, I doubled the amount of shredded carrots, cinnamon, substituted golden raisins, added 1 t. vanilla and 1/4 t. allspice, while omitting the ginger and nutmeg.   Oh my goodness - delicious! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I'm adding to my breakfast repertoire.

Used 3 1/2 c almond milk in place of 4 c water because I had it. Cut the ginger in 1/2. Placed all ingredients in my slow cooker, cooked 7 hours overnight - maybe cook 6 next time. Made 4 servings. Everyone added their own brown sugar and/or sugar coated nuts. The nuts really made it great.

I don't like steel oats, so I used regular ones.  I didn't have an apple and I cut down the amount of sugar.   I really liked it.

Easy and adaptable.  I made it with regular oats as I didn't have the full time for steel cuts oats.  I cooked the carrots and apple in some water first and then added remaining ingredients with extra water to finish.  Kids enjoyed it.  They liked the pecans, of course!
I added a little brown sugar to the oatmeal mixture as well, but I don't think I really needed to as I think raisins add enough sweetness all by themselves.  I did notice a review saying too much raisins which I never find to be true as I LOVE raisins and their sweetness but go with personal preference...I used cinnamon and nutmeg after reading reviews about too much ginger, although a little ginger probably would be good if you like ginger. 
Easy to make as little or as much as you like...

Very easy to make and delicious. I made it per recipe and did not change anything. I added Smith apples that give little sour taste and keep crispness. Great option for breakfast that can be made in the evening and taken to work.

A wonderful twist on just plain oatmeal. I added 1/4c flaxseed ,doubled the spices & vanilla & used almond creamer instead of yogurt.   Thank you so much for the great recipe.

Was very unimpressed!! I let simmer a little long and still the shredded carrots were very crunchy! It was just overall bland. No one in the house finished their bowl.

Very good! The flavors taste very autumn! The spices are a tad overwhelming so I might cut back on them a hair - but they are so classic. The toasted pecans make this fabulous.

VERY GOOD! I normally eat plain steel cut oats every morning and decided to switch it up. this was great! I added a bit more brown sugar and a bit of vanilla. I also used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and walnuts instead of pecans. 
The next time I make it I will probably only put in 1/4 teaspoon of ginger. but all around good!

I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. I expected it to need more sweetness, but it didn't. I thought I would not like the plain yogurt topping, but I did (used plain nonfat Greek yogurt). I didn't think the nuts would add all that much flavor to the recipe, but they did. I cut the recipe down to 2 servings. The only other change I made was to grate the apple. This made a delightful, filling breakfast...one I'm looking forward to having again tomorrow morning.

I didn't have steel cut oats, used regular oats. I liked this but my husband didn't. Next time I'll cook the carrots a bit longer than the oats. I think pineapple would be really good in this. 
I didn't have yogurt, used a bit of cream cheese in mine.

tasty way to use up some SCOs I purchased for another recipe. The type of apple will alter the sweetness of this recipe. Very tasty, filling breakfast. I added a splash of maple syrup and a bit of crushed cloves at the table. The dish seemed to be screaming for some syrup. Thanks

I think the reviewers who said it was too
Spicy or too many raisins must have used instant oats
The steel cut swells up and makes around 4 cups so I actually thought the cinnamon flavour was a bit mild
I did add a little extra sweetness but that’s it 
This a nice change from packaged chemicals and sugar

Not bad, but not great either. I didn't include the raisins as I don't like them but otherwise followed the recipe as well as I could - would've been nice to have an actual measurement for the apple as the apples I have right now are quite small so I put in just a little extra but then it seemed like there was too much. Any bite WITH apple, that's all you could taste. And any bite that didn't have apple or pecan was rather bland. Perhaps a bit more spice and maybe a touch of brown sugar would help, and maybe even a bit more carrot - I couldn't taste it at all except for one bite that happened to have a large clump of carrot in it.  Regardless, it was significantly more effort  than I want to put forth for something that's just ok, and I don't feel any desire to play around with it further and try to perfect it

Variations: I used rolled oats and after adding them to the boiling water, adjusting the temp to simmering, immediately started adding the apples, etc. I added extra brown sugar (~ 1/2 tbsp) to the oatmeal mixture and lightened up on the ginger. I also only used about 2 cups of water.

Delicious!  I added another teaspoon of cinnamon but other than that followed recipe.  I only had walnuts so I toasted them in place of pecans.  It is super easy.  My husband and I had a bowl for lunch!  I will be making this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good and healthy.  Mine didn’t seem to resemble a carrot cake taste but I would definitely make this again.  Instead of plain yogurt I will try vanilla.

Yum!  This was sooo good!  I made the recipe as written except left out the raisins and threw a few in when reheating it.  Had it with 6 oz of plain Greek yogurt with mixed with a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla & 3 packets of Stevia.  Added butter spray and lite pancake syrup at the table.  Will make again!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This is such a tasty, filling breakfast that when I eat it I’m often not hungry until around 3p.m. I add some shredded (unsweetened) coconut, 1 tsp vanilla and I add evaporated milk after it is cooked (instead of the yogurt). I also increased the carrots to 1 cup . Ginger can be overpowering so I omitted it. Not a huge fan of raisins so I didn’t use it.

Very good. I wasn't sure this would be sweet enough but the fruit infused a lot of sweetness into the oats. My kids added more sugar, but I was fine with it just the way it was!

These oats were great!! Made for a perfect fall breakfast and filled me up fast. I added some apples on top as well as a little whipped cream and some cinnamon sugar. The only thing that I have to critique is that it didn't really taste  like carrots or carrot cake. I would also say the servings were on the smaller side. If you are making it for 3 people put it up to 4 servings, for 4 people 5 servings. On the whole it was super tasty though!

Wow.  I can't believe a recipe with so many excellent reviews was so bad!  Yuck!  I made it yesterday, tasted it & almost tossed it.  However, I added lots of honey & some milk.  Made it almost palatable.  Very, very bad.  Will NEVER make this again & will be very skeptical of reviews from now on.  Again, yuck!

This was a really tasty breakfast! It cooked up a lot quicker than the recipe said. I love that it has no refined sugar. The raisins and apples add enough to make it sweet. Instead of toasted pecans I just put some chopped walnuts on mine with milk.

Disappointing when first finished & still warm. Improved by adding brown sugar & milk to rewarmed leftovers. Next serving used greek yogurt with additional mixed fresh fruit. Won't make again as written.

Made as written, excellent!   Didn't have greek yogurt used regular vanilla yogurt and while the flavor was good the thicker consistency of a greek yogurt is better suited to this.

I'm trying to cut out sugar, so I liked that I could omit that from the recipe and it was still great.  I stuck with just cinnamon for that classic apples and cinnamon flavour with a carrot cake twist.  I didn't have time to make the nuts I'll have to try that soon; but it was great without it too.

I was disappointed by this recipe, as it tastes nothing like carrot cake. I followed the recipe and after one taste it tasted like nothing. I added brown sugar and butter to the oats. Still nothing like carrot cake. I added more cinnamon and nutmeg , and decided although it was good enough to eat, still nothing like carrot cake. I don't know if you could doctor this recipe enough.

yum. We really flavored it to our liking. I cooked the apples and carrots in butter first. I just wish we had some pecans to go with it. next time we'll have pecans and I'll take a pic BEFORE eating it all!

I love the flavor of this recipe. I personally like a thicker oatmeal, so next time I probably won't use as much water, but otherwise the recipe is perfect! Though I did wind up mixing the toasted pecans in with the rest of the ingredients to save myself a dirty bowl... I will definitely be making this again.

Very yummy and healthy breakfast. I didn't have steel-cut oats so I used rolled oats instead. Not as much fiber but quicker cook time. Warmed my tummy up this morning ??

Absolutely delicious! I had no trouble with the amount of ginger as one reviewer did; I love the spiciness of carrot cake and did not find it as strong as that. This is, however, a great breakfast to cook up on the weekend - who has all that time in the morning on a work day?

What a great different way to eat my oats! 
I skipped the butter and nut step and the raisins Just because i wanted to make it more healthier to my 21 day fix diet. I did however sprinkle a smaller amount of brown sugar and some walnuts on top along with a dollop of plain greek yogurt.

I used almond milk instead of Yogurt, I wasn't sure about the texture of yogurt, and it couldn't have turned out better.  

It's full of flavour and the spices blended so nicely.

Followed recipe except for using walnuts and substituting cream cheese (softened with evaporated milk and vanilla).  I was really surprised that it was sweet enough when all ingredients were put together.  Thankfully I resisted adding additional sugar because I'm trying to cut back sugar intake.  About 1/2 serving is very satisfying so there will be a lot of leftovers for the rest of the week.  Great recipe!

I will make this again.  I pre-cooked the oats in the water for 10 minutes the night before and left it covered overnight on stove, then continued with recipe in the morning.  I used only 1/4 tsp. ginger and added 1/4 tsp. stevia to oats.  I also added 1/8 tsp. stevia and a dash of vanilla to the plain Greek yogurt.

I knew we would want a bit of sweetness, so I put 3 dried dates in the nutribullet with one of the cups of water, then began the cooking.   Next time, I'll put the carrots in At the beginning so they have a bit more cook time.  The spices were perfect.  We skipped the toppings, to eliminate the sugar and fats for this meal.  We loved it and I will definitely make this again!

This oatmeal was very bland and not sweet at all. Had to add sugar to make it edible. Name was misleading.

Very good. Only change I made was using pumpkin pie spice since I didn't have the individual spices. Will definitely make again.

This was really yummy. Had it for a lazy Sunday brunch. I did change one thing though-I used dairy free cream cheese instead of yogurt because I didn't have any. Also, I did cut the entire recipe in half though because  it was just me eating it and it turned out great. While I think it's amazing as it, I might put in more carrots next time just because, hey, its' carrots for breakfast. Can't wait to make this for my boyfriend who loves carrot cake! Thanks for the recipe!

Used three shredded carrots and skipped raisins. Used fresh ginger.  It was ok. The nuts are essential. Didn't care for warm yogurt. Still prefer apples. We ate some- very filling- but will not take time to make again.
