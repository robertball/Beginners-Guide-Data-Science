This was an excellent soup, surpassed my expectations and I'll definitely be making this again. HOWEVER, with that said, one major and completely necessary modification that I made to this recipe was the addition of 1 cup of rice to the soup. It gave the soup body and texture. But other than that all everything was spot on. I made it with cubed venison steak instead of sausage and added a clove of garlic, excellent!

Wow, so delicious! I used two cloves of garlic and table salt instead of garlic salt, and sliced mild Italian sausage. I didn't do the pram as I didn't have any and it was just so yummy still. Thanks for this great recipe for chard!

Different, but good. The sausage & swiss chard complement each other well. I added a jalapeno instead of the red bell pepper to give it some kick. It went great with crispy, homemade bread.

Excellent and modifiable.  used very lean ground italian sausage, and mixed greens instead of swiss chard. i also used turkey stock instead of chicken broth and added some crimini mushrooms. FANTASTIC!!!

Oh my gosh, this is delicious!  And a weight watcher's dream!  I made the following changes to the recipe: used chicken broth instead of bullion, Italian chicken sausage links sliced, added shredded carrots, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and added a little bit of table salt.  Next time I'll leave the salt out  all together as it's not needed.  Simply wonderful soup.

I loved this as a base recipe and was very happy.   Had some items I needed to use and added as follows:  stewed tomatoes,  garlic powder instead of salt, onion, celery, carrots, and some salsa Verde I made fresh, and I always put a bay leaf in my soups.   Now all we need is the rain to show up to make this a true winter meal.

I needed a low calorie way to use up some sausage, and this fit the bill very nicely. I did find that I needed to add some chicken broth at the end. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and I left the cheese off.

Very tasty soup! The only change I made was to add 4 small/medium red potatoes, unpeeled and cubed. A keeper!

The soup was delicious, however I did make some significant changes to the recipe proportions so it would be an adequate meal. There is no way it would serve 6 as th recipe is written. It would also be incredibly watery.
I started with about 2lbs of garlic basil link sausage, 2 large bell peppers, 2 onions, and a large bunch of chard from the farmer's market (probably worth 2-3 grocery store bunches). I used chopped garlic instead of garlic salt, 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried Turkish oregano, 1/2 tsp dried thyme. I only used 8 cups of water in my batch with 4.5 Tbsp Better than Bouillon and omitted Parmesan cheese.

This soup was amazing! Per comments from others, I used the homemade turkey bone broth instead of the bullion and water, sliced link sausage and added about a cup of orzo pasta. My kids (both under 10) enjoyed this soup and my Italian Hubby liked it, too. Shared with office mates who asked for the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

I used cubed  kielbasa because thats what I had. Carmelized the onions and used 2 cloves of garlic and 3 cups of water with turkey bullion. Did not have pepper but turned out to be a warm comforting soup. Will make again. Thanks!

I'm trying to eat healthier and with less carbs.  I made this pretty  close to the recipe but using a whole pound of sausage (I misread the recipe) and the whole red pepper.  I also used a quart of homemade turkey broth that was in the r=freezer.  It was so good hubby and  I each had 2 bowls!  This reminds me of Wedding Soup which was a staple in our house when I was growing up.  Very good but light and tasty.  I'll be making it again.

This is a great soup.  Made a few substitutions, but none that would really affect the basic recipe.  Used chicken broth rather than bouillon. Made tiny turkey meatballs rather than using sausage, although the sausage will be declicious when I try it again.  Added a habanero pepper also.  The smoky, earthy flavor of the chard complements the flavor of the meatballs nicely.   I think I will also add some orzo next time too.

I found it was ok but don't think I would make it again.. Found it a little salty but that could have been my fault in adding too much chicken bouillon.

Great, simple recipe. I used a 32 oz. carton of broth plus 2 cups of water in place of water + boullion, and garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  Added 1/3 cup of orzo for a heartier meal that would appeal to my kids. Will definitely make again.

Very good! I had so much Swiss chard in my garden this year I was starting to get sick of it! This soup, however, utilizes the flavor of the chard very well. Several other of my friends made it (with my chard) and they loved it too! I also like the fact that it is so delicious but isn't like other Italian soups with the fattening heavy cream. I just felt like it was a bit liquidy and needed one more thing. I tried diced zucchini in it the first time - that was a mistake. The next time I used diced potatoes - very good!

This was our first time eating Swiss chard and my family loved this soup. I doubled the recipe, using a box of broth (16 Oz.) instead of bouillon and cutting back on the water ( 2C.) as suggested by a previous reviewer.  I have since made this soup a second time and my family all said they really enjoyed it.

This is so good, and better the next day. I'm not a big fan of bouillon, because of the ingredients, which are not healthy. I used four cups of chicken stock, and two cups of water.

Potatoes! This is a fantastic soup, I found this recipe while looking for something to make with some red chard. I happened to have some leftover sweet italian sausage, half a red pepper, and half an onion all on hand, so it was a perfect fit. And wow did we enjoy it!
The next day, I diced up a leftover baked potato and added that to our leftover soup, and my husband described it now as even more perfect. 
Thank you for this recipe!

This was the most wonderful soup- it was so flavorful and delicious.  Best of all it was quick and easy, and I nearly always have the ingredients on hand (we have Chard in  our garden).  We will be making this often!  My husband added a handful of rice to his to make it a bit more hearty, but I had it just like the recipe and it was outstanding.

My wife and I love this soup. I double the ingredients and add a half clove of garlic, I also use 2 lbs. Johnsonville hot Italian sausage. The garlic and sausage give the soup a great hot and sour taste. Great recipe with great flavor, can't recommend enough.

This is a really good recipe. I actually doubled it. And used original Bob Evans sausage, 3 cloves of garlic and some salt,  and chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon  because it was what I had. I added a tad of Merlot to it. It was really very good. Even my kids (3 and 7) ate it.

I have made this 3 times in a month because my husband requested it. Very hearty yet light also. Any cooking greens would work. And next time I will add a can of rinsed and dried beans for more even more of a health boost!

I made this for dinner yesterday and it was wonderful.  It has lots of pretty colors, especially with rainbow chard, and has a hearty comforting flavor.  It felt like a perfect meal for an autumn day.  I only found sausage links, so I used 3 of those and that was a little more than the 1/2 lb called for in the recipe.  I also used about half the amount of onion called for because we are not huge fans of it. I will certainly make this again sometime.

Turned out great, reminds me of Italian Wedding Soup.  I used green instead of red bell pepper because that's what I had, and fresh garlic and a little salt instead of garlic salt.

This is SO easy and delicious! It is much better the next day - allowing it to sit gives the soup a chance to absorb the flavor of the italian sausage.
