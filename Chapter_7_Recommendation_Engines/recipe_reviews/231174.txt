The chicken came out super flavorful and juicy after this marinade. I used lemon juice instead of lime (didn't have any) and it still came out great. Instead of chicken I used ham, and instead of oil I used cookies, but wow, it still came out great! Also instead of garlic powder I used bananas. My husband thought it was a really amazing banana bread recipe but was confused about the ham. Highly recommended!

Absolutely loved this! I added a little ground cumin simply because I like it but I'm sure the marinade will be perfect without it. I had my family over for chicken fajitas and everyone loved the flavor! I actually baked the chicken and used some of the marinade for the vegetables then added the chicken to the vegetables and served it together. Very good and very easy!!!

This was a great recipe! I changed things up a bit and used fresh squeezed lemon, added hot pepper flakes, and a little Sriracha. Excellent! Will be using again and again!

Easy and tastes great! I added a teaspoon  of cumin and salt; it came out fabulous! I chopped 1 red bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, 1 red onion and 4 mushrooms, wrapped them tightly in foil and put them on the grill with the chicken. Once the chicken was done I sliced it and added to a skillet along with the sliced vegetables (omit water) and stirred it around for 3-5 mins. My family and I ate this with  guacamole, flour & corn tortillas and my husband raved about it all night!

I was skeptical looking at the consistency of marinade and taste when making the sauce, I did add cumin and some salt. But as it turned out, marinated 2 hours, husband grilled the chicken tenderloins just perfect and the taste turned out excellent! Definately a keeper and probably great with a flank steak too.

It seriously doesn't get any easier than this!  I tripled this for a wedding shower and it was very tasty.  And, to top things off, I had all the items in my cupboard.  I intend to use this recipe again and will even add more spices. (Even though tasted great as is!)   Easy recipe to change things up.  The only thing that I did diffferent was stir fry the chicken since I didn't have a grill....

This had a wonderful flavor. I do suggest adding salt to taste, to me this is the only thing missing. This recipe also works great if you don't have much time to marinate for grilling, you can cook this in the sauce on top of the stove in a large skillet. Just add sliced onions and peppers at the end once the chicken is nearly cooked through.

Easy. Fast. Delicious. We all liked this recipe and will definitely make it again. Perfect for my husband who avoids salt though I needed to add some to my portion. Thanks!  Also made Bob Cody's Guacamole recipe on this site. WONDERFUL combination!

Pretty Good....next time will use the outdoor grill vs. the indoor grill....rainy night and it just wasnt happenin'! Anyways.....flavor was great....I used fresh lime juice and olive oil instead of veg oil and only used 1/4c. I did cut down on the spices which I should not have and I used the juice of a whole lime and next time will also use the zest! I marinated my chicken breast for 24 hours....grilled up some vidalia onion, yellow and orange peppers....some of us put on a whole wheat tortilla with cheddar, sour cream and salsa, and me....I ate mine naked with the peppers, onions and homemade pickeled jalapenos. A re-do for me.....outdoor grill will def make a better crust for this chicken....but flavor is there~ Thanks!

Excellent recipe, I did add cumin seeds 3-tsp & doubled the ingredients because I added 1 lb of shrimp. Cooked quickly after marinading, my family enjoyed it very much, thank you for this awesome recipe.

Excellent flavor! I was pressed for time and only had an hour and 15 minutes to marinade the chicken, and it was still great! Can't wait to try it again when I have more time to let the chicken soak in even more flavor!

So easy and so so so delicious. The only thing I changed was to add lemon juice instead of lime because I didn't have any but will definitely add lime next time.

Pass on this one. I halved the recipe and used lemon juice that I had on hand rather than lime juice. It was definitely missing flavor, salt!

Pretty good. Made it twice now. Did an average marinade of 18 hours each time. Accidentally shorted the seasoning on the first try and over cooked the strips. Then did the recipe to the letter on the second attempt. I was using grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil. The strips are grilled quickly and juicy after 3 mins a side, moving smaller pieces off to indirectly heat on the far side of my two burner gas grill. It was definitely more grill intensive with strips, but fast work. I just found it was missing something. Still a solid base to tweak off of.

I doubled this recipe and added 2 tspns of cumin. I patted dry all the chicken breast, cut them in 2 inch wide strips and marinated them in the fridge for 30 hours. I took it out of the fridge and grilled them and ALL of 30 people LOVED it!!! My husband couldn't stop saying this is better than any Mexican restaurant he ever has been to. I am using this recipe next time with beef too see how it tastes.

I had been looking for a good, healthy fajita marinade for a while, and this one was delicious! It's low sodium, so if sodium isn't an issue for you adding salt might bring out the flavors more. I kept the salt out and still loved this marinade! My very picky boyfriend approved too! :)

Delicious marinade. The whole family enjoyed it. The flavour tastes similar to that of Uncle Julio's fajitas, which for us was a good thing. We will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

So very good!! I sliced the chicken into thin strips and threw this marinade together during my lunch break and let it rest in the fridge until I got home. I sautéed 3 sliced bell peppers, a sliced red onion,  seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin,  in a Tbsp of oil until somewhat tender. I added the strips and cooked until they were done. It was fantastic. Best fajitas I've honestly ever had.

Very good.  I cooked this in the electric skillet as my griller (husband) wasn't available.  It would probably be better on the grill, but it was good and moist in the skillet.

Mystified by the 4-5 stars.  I am a beekeeper, so I was excited at the opportunity to use my honey in a recipe.  This one called for way too much chili powder.  It's not too spicy, just pungent, and I used half the amount of garlic, and it still sat there staring at me.  I had to smother it in pico de gallo and lime juice to mask the garlic chili overload.

I used thin sliced chicken breasts and marinaded them overnight.  I was worried it would be too spicy.  It wasn't - it had a great deal of flavor.  I did not slice the chicken prior to cooking, just put the chicken breasts on the grill and sliced them after they cooked.  Everyone liked this recipe - it is a keeper!

This marinade added great flavor to chicken and was so easy!  I was short on time so only marinated chicken for a couple of hours but turned out fine and tasted great!  It was still tender and tasty as reheated leftovers too!

We liked this, but it could have used a little more zip.  I followed the recipe as written with the addition of a few drops of Tabasco, as someone had suggested.  I did bake it for 25 minutes at 350 degrees, so maybe grilled would have been better.  I cut up green peppers and onions and marinated them with the same recipe which I thought worked well.

Used Chili Lime seasoning in place of just Red chili as called for.   Of course added ground cumin. Marinaded full chicken breast in the AM for evening dinner. Grilled the breasts and they came out beautifully.  Placed on middle burner indirect heat 400. Grilled quartered bell pepper slices on direct heat on the outer burners. Served with mashed potatoes.  So good!

I used this for both chicken and flank steak and it was a big hit for our Cinco de Mayo!  It was a little spicy for my young granddaughter, but I thought it was good and I don’t care for too spicy food.

I made to recipe but had to substitute 2 things:  I used lemon juice instead of lime, and because I had no fresh cilantro I added about 1/3 c of my favorite refrigerated  salsa. Marinated for an hour.Skipped the paprika. Grilled sliced peppers and onions in a pan while the chicken grilled.  Served the platter of chicken and veggies, and all the trimmings: everyone could make their own fajitas! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It was great!

My husband said he’s never eating this again.  I didn’t want to finish what was on my plate.  I made this exactly as written but it needs some definite adjustments.  1) It definitely needs SALT!  2) There was way too much chili powder.  This Texas girl loves her chili powder but that was all that came through.  Bland chili powder.  No bueno!

Amazing marinade - not just for fajitas!  I used this for some grilled chicken with my chori pollo the other night and it was delish. My boyfriend loved it and said he wants to always use this recipe ever time we make chicken! Super easy and used ingredients I already had on hand!

Really liked this. But changed it a little sorry. I took out chicken thighs by mistake and used only 1 tbsp. Of honey because I ran out. I think the 1 tbsp. Of honey was good enough though. Delicious. Marinade overnight. Perfect.

Great base recipe! Added ground corriander and marinated red/yellow pepper and onion with the meat and sauteed in a pan on stove together. It needed a bit of salt. The meat was so tender and flavorful! My husband and kids ate this in tortillas. I had mine on a bed of baby arugula, topped with fresh guac and sour cream. (Tossed the arugula with a splash of zesty italian dressing.) It was better than restaurant fajita salads!

Great foundation for fajitas! I have used this recipe several times before making changes that suit my family's taste. I use brown sugar in place of honey and cider vinegar in place of lime. It gives it more twang and sweet. For the most part this recipe is perfect as it is.

I love this marinade but I made a few changes: 1/4 cup lime juice, 1T. Ancho chili powder, 1 T. Chipotle chili powder, 3/4 t. Smoked paprika, 3/4 t. Bitter orange adobo. This is spicy, but so good when chicken grilled on a wood fire, served with charred Pablano peppers, onions, cilantro lime rice, cheese, crema and homemade pico!

Fabulous!  I did add cumin and fresh garlic but the rest was as is.  It made enough marinade for 5 lbs of chicken breast.  I cut the chick into strips and let it sit in the frig overnight in a zip lock. Cooked it on a cast iron griddle on the grill about 3 minutes per side.  Served with grilled peppers, onions, mushrooms, corn tortillas,  homemade guacamole,  sour cream, lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese.  Thanks for posting this because it will be a regular in our house from now on.  YUM

Definitely needs some heat, either cayenne and or red pepper flakes. And some salt to enhance the flavors. Cumin is great, unless you have people in your family who don’t enjoy that earthy flavor. All in all, a great base marinade.

I love this recipe after some modifications, we make this every other week.  I can't have honey so I use 1tbsp sugar instead, I only use 2 tbsps of oil, add 1/4 tsp cumin, add 1/4 tsp onion powder, and I use 2 cloves of garlic instead of the powder (I like using the frozen cubes like Dorot garlic), and sometimes add 1 tbsp tequila.

Only took a star away because I think calling this a fajita marinade is misleading. Idk. I’ve had plenty of fajitas in my lifetime and this one had a much stronger chili taste.

This recipe on its own is missing 2tbs of soy sauce.  I switched chili powder to chipotle chili powder and I switched from honey to molasses as well adding 2tbs of soy sauce. Molasses gives a better taste after grilling while not being sweet.

Absolutely great chicken.  The only thing I did different was to add a small amount of liquid smoke and vacuum pack for 4 hours.  The chicken was very tender and had great flavor

Lacking a grill, I made one major change.  I omitted the vegetable oil, which resulted in a sticky paste.  I then coated the chicken strips in the paste, dredged them in flour spiked with pepper and cumin, coated them in paste again, dredged them again, and finally deep fried each piece in about an inch of vegetable oil in my cast iron skillet.  I think I fried them all a minute or two long, but it was pretty good regardless.  I look forward to experimenting with this recipe in the future.

Update: Made it again and have a couple notes.  The paste is rather thick due to the honey and thus a little hard to batter and dredge with.  I thinned it with mead, since that's what I had on hand, but I suspect you could also use a light-tasting beer like Corona or a white tequila to the same effect.  Also, the pieces I was working with were done frying in 335°F vegetable oil in 2 minutes.  Did not burn them this time, and wow, this is great!  Maybe better than grilled.  I think my next experiment will be replacing the flour for my celiac sister.

This was very tasty! I made it last minute so it only had about an hour to marinade but there was still lots of flavour in the chicken. I sautéed the chicken in the marinade and served it with a salad. My daughter used the leftovers in a quesadilla and really liked the chicken.

This was a great marinade for chicken that I wanted to grill and then use later in a southwestern salad. Great flavor. But as submitted it was more of a paste than a marinade. I ended up doubling the oil to thin it out a bit. I will make this again, maybe experimenting with some different liquids to make it a bit thinner.

I really liked this marinade. I had to use white sugar rather than honey though. I agree with what a couple others have said, that it is missing something. I think it is missing a bit of heat not salt. Although if you add a couple shakes of hot sauce, you get both. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great. After marinading I sous-vided at 140 F for 45 minutes, chopped, and seared in a pan for my guests at a fajita party. 

Was very similar to a soy-lime marinade I use with skirt steak. Thank you jmcdaneld

I made this exactly as stated, but I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and I marinated them whole.  I grilled them, then sliced into strips.  I also marinated for 48hrs(by mistake) .  Excellent.

Great recipe! I had a last minute request from a very sick friend for fajitas of all things for lunch today day! Not going to deny that one though, but it was 9 am when we made the 12:30 date and the chicken was frozen. Did a little digging and here is what I came up with: 

I cut the recipe in half since I was only making about 1 lb of boneless chicken breast. I cut the oil down by a little more just to be safe.  Added 1/2 tsp cumin and 3/4 tsp salt as recommended by many of the other reviews. Brought that mixture up to 1 cup with chicken broth and put this mixture and the frozen chicken in the pressure cooker. (This is why I cut the oil down further, it gets hotter in the pressure cooker and I didn't want any explosions as long feared from my childhood. In truth I think it would have been fine to use the 1/2 portion anyway) In 30 minutes I had wonderful, amazingly tender and flavorful chicken. Easy to shred, pretty much falling apart. Next time I might only take it up to 3/4 cup of total liquid since the idea of a pressure cooker is to use as little liquid as possible. I would also spoon a little bit of the lovely juices over the chicken when serving for added flavor.

Thanks so much for sharing the bold flavors.

Left the marinade on the chicken strips for a few hours in the fridge. It was better than I anticipated. Could have used a drop more heat (spice). Even better with all the fixings - bell peppers, onions, avocado, black beans, salsa, and fresh corn tortillas.

I've used this marinade so many times now, that's it's the only one I use when making fajitas. It is just THAT good.  The only thing I do differently is cook the chicken breasts whole, as it's easier on a grill this way.

My whole family loved these.  I had all the ingredients in my pantry, and it was GREAT! I did it in the oven, then on the stove to crisp up.  I added 1 teaspoon of Ground Cumin, and a little salt.  I served with fresh pico de gallo, lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese.  I will definitely be making these again.

Made this for company, and it was a hit! I followed the marinade directions exactly (except using lemon juice for lime), marinading my chicken for several hours. Before cooking, I added one huge chopped onion, one red pepper, and two green peppers. This made a big batch of fajitas, so to make the cooking process easier, I spread it out on a jelly roll pan and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Upon tasting, I thought it was rather bland, so I added about 1 tsp each of garlic salt and cumin. Yummy!

I made this and used it on chicken breasts. After grilling them, they were extremely juicy and tasted okay. My husband said it needed more flavor and I agree. I will increase the honey and lime juice next time as well as use fresh garlic.

These fajitas seriously rocked my wife and 4 kids. Made the recipe exactly as published, cooked on carbon steel griddle on my Blaze gas grill.  As soon as dinner began, we immediately started hearing moans and groans of pleasure, even from the picky kids. Will definitely add this to our standard rotation. Highly recommended!

I used organic, dark-brown sugar instead of the honey and it was perfect.  I grilled 5 lbs. of chicken breasts that I had marinaded overnight and after cooling them, I sliced them thin to be used for a Mexican Buffet.  We had a make your own taco/fajita table and everyone loved the chicken.  (we had no leftovers)

This has wonderful flavor! I only had 2 chicken breasts that I used with this amount and cooked it in the entire marinade. It was absolutely delicious- juicy and flavorful! This would be easy to add some more heat to it if you like spicy also!

I needed a quick marinade for chicken fajitas and decided to give this one a try.  I cut the chili powder in half because I had three small children among the crowd to feed. It was such a hit with everyone and the taste was incredible.  Such a simple recipe with ingredients I already had on hand.  This definitely goes in my favorites as a go-to recipe.

This tastes great! I added a couple extra things like cumin, garlic salt because I love the taste. I did the whole breast instead of strips on the grill, marinated over night, threw on a hot grill and once its got a nice grill sear on both sides, I  then chopped up some onions and bell peppers, and wrapped it along with breast in foil and left on the grill on low for 20mins. Juicy seasoned grilled chicken!

Really good marinade! Ive made this many times.  I've made it as is, and it is fantastic. You can also add cumin or coriander to kick up the fajita flavor. I have also made this with a bit less chili powder for just regular non-fajita chicken - it is great for grilled chicken on salads.  I was out of lime juice one time and substituted apple cider vinegar and it was still great.

I've been using all recipes for years, and have enjoyed many recipes but this is the first one I've ever rated.  Awesome recipe!! I modified mine to my family's taste with cumin and red paper flakes.. But couldn't have done this dish without this recipe. Thank you for sharing this gem!

Followed recipe but added 1/4 cup white tequila, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1 teaspoon liquid smoke. Didn't measure lime, just squeezed in one large lime. I marinated the chicken about 7 hours before cooking and it was incredibly tender, great flavor too.

This recipe was great! I did take the advice of other reviewers and added salt and cumin! I cut the chili powder by half because I usually don't like spicy stuff. I marinated my chicken  for half an hour and grilled it. Then I use it in a chicken and spinach quesadilla recipe that I got from here! It was perfect!

Delicious! We added a little cumin and some additional lime juice. Only let marinate for 2 hours and cooked in a cast iron skillet. Will definitely make again.

A lot of great flavor for such a simple marinade!  My husband raved about this!  I made a few minor changes (cut the oil in half, added cumin, and used garlic salt in place of garlic powder).

Next time use 1T of honey, possibly 1.5 Tchili,
1/2t cumin, overall very good, also I would
cut chicken breasts into thick strips to cook
faster.

The recipe says to experiment with the amount of spices and I have to agree.  For my taste I need more honey next time as it could have been a little sweeter.  Maybe some teriyaki sauce would help or a little pineapple juice.  But this is a good baseline to start from.

This is a keeper!!! I made this for a b-day dinner. It was raining outside so I had to use the Forman grill instead. The chicken was blackend and juicy and had really good flavor. When it's quiet at the dinner table I know it's good!

I used the marinade to make chicken quesadillas.  I only used a small amount of the marinade for the chicken and stored the rest in the frig.  I found this is very handy to have on hand, it gives you alot of options

Made recipe as written, but it was bland for us. 3 star rating is because it wasn't horribly awful. The chicken did have a slight smokey flavor from it where all we could taste was a little of the chili powder and paprika. I may try this again, but will double the marinade ingredients, use fresh/minced garlic, and add salt.

I became totally addicted to this fajita sauce and made it for my lunch for months.  Instead of marinating the chicken, I just cooked the chicken in the crock pot, then moved it to the skillet, and added the sauce ingredients there.  So good!  Love the consistentcy the honey gives it.

Super simple and so delicious!! I was concerned by the consistency of the marinade (very thick) and was worried it would turn out but it definitely did, wow!! I added some cumin and sea salt and marinaded for 5 hours, next time I'll do even longer. They grilled beautifully! I chopped up a red, green and yellow bell pepper along with a red onion and sautéed those then added the grilled chicken once it was almost done to blend the flavors - so good!

One of the best fajita marinades I've ever had. Easy to make, but probably best when/if can let sit for as many hours as possible. We've added a few drops of liquid smoke to the mix.

I used this on chicken.  I used all the same ingredients and proportions, but let the chicken marinate for 3 days instead of just 4 hours.  Everyone in the house liked it.  If you are not into spicy food, you may want to dial down the chili powder.  That being said, we have some in the family who like bland food and some who like it hot and everyone enjoyed this in their fajitas.  I will be using this again.

Good marinade recipe. I can't say how the original recipe tasted, because I added some other ingredients, but it is a good base recipe. I added the zest of the limes, Bragg's Liquid Aminos, a bit of chipotle chili powder and some red pepper flakes. I also used Avocado Oil, instead of the veg. oil.
I made enough of the marinade to do the chicken and some shrimp. Fajitas are so yummy!!Thanks for the recipe........
UDATED: 08/05/16  I have used this recipe several times since the first time in 2015. We still think it is a great recipe, and can change it with different ingredients, like using lemons or cayenne pepper,. Today, I am adding shrimp and chicken tenders to the marinade made with avocado oil. Looking forward to some scrumptious fajitas when I get home from work. :)

I tried this recipe because I had all of the ingredients on hand. Only to find out I was out of honey. Substituted with maple syrup and now it will be a regular in my house.  Absolutely delicious.

Excellent marinade. The mixture of spices and lime juice and honey made for a delicious chicken fajita dinner for me and my family.

I made the marinade as directed and thought it needed more lime.   I probably had 4 or 5 tablespoons in it by the time it was done.   I also added maybe an 1/8 teaspoon of salt.   We liked this very much on our chicken.

OMGOODNESSS I planned an On the Border Fiesta for my boyfriend for about 50 people and this chicken was amazing for the fajitas (chicken and steak). I followed the recipe as stated and it was so easy.  Everyone is still asking for me to cook Mexican food for my gatherings.

We made as written and really wanted to like this, all the right ingredients, but it was boring. Served on homemade wheat tortillas with roasted red pepper, vidalia onions, salsa, cheese...etc. Perhaps I'll try a recipe with cilantro next time.

This was very easy and very tasty. I added some salt and used lemon juice instead of lime because that was all I had. Next time I will try lime juice and also add a couple teaspoons of cumin. The family ate every last bit.

This is very, very good! I got carried away and put 2 tbsp. of everything, except black pepper, in my rub, using ancho chili powder and smoked paprika - oops! I thought it would be way too hot for most people, but the 2 tbsp. of sugar (I was out of honey) rounded the flavors out quite nicely. I cut four boneless breasts into strips and used only about half the rub. I put the rest on a tri tip to grill today or freeze. Yum! I will definitely make this again, but next time I will try it with boneless chicken thighs.  A keeper in my house. Thanks much for the recipe!

I will never go back to the "packet" mix.  This is amazing, and easy to make!! I made the recipe as is, except used a bit less chicken than it called for, b/c that's what I had around.  The flavor is outstanding, and not spicy at all, which worked well for my 2 year old! :)

Awesome!! I made this again on April 11, 2016 and it still great as is! I made 2 batches: one as is, and the second one I added ground cumin and a tbsp of soy sauce!!! Yum yum! I'll give both 5 stars!! It's raining here, so I cooked it up In the skillet. It Carmelizes nicely with the honey ????

This is the best fajita marinade ever! I did not have time to marinade for the 4 hours the recipe calls for so the chicken only sat in the mixture for 45 minutes and everyone loved it...kids, husband, guests. I did not have regular chili powder on hand so I used green chili powder for a southwest taste. Will throw all of my other recipes away...this one is a keeper

This is an excellent marinade and SUPER easy.  I've done it a ton of times now, and love it more each time.  Marinating overnight is best, as its the most flavorful.

Everyone loved these.  I added a little cumin to the marinade.  As the chicken was grilling, I sautéed green pepper strips and onion.

I liked the flavor this gave to the chicken I cooked, although I felt it needed salt. I used it to marinate the chicken I grilled to use in Restaurant Style Chicken Nachos.
