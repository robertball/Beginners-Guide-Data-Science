I made a quick homemade barbeque sauce for this recipe. I used BLSL chicken breasts instead of bone-in chicken breasts. I wanted to make it stretch a little farther so I cut each breast in half and lightly pounded it each breast with the tenderizing mallet. Doing this meant that I had to double the ham and cheese. I made no other changes. I did not try this myself but my family liked it. My husband said that next time, he'd like to try this with bacon instead of ham and in a hoagie.

I am only giving it 4 stars because I had to modify it a little.
First, I used small boneless/skinless breasts because we prefer them. I seasoned them with barbeque flavored spices and baked them for about 10 minutes before adding the barbeque sauce SHREDDED ham and then GRATED cheese.

This was a great recipe that my husband and I both enjoyed. I will definitely add this to our "rotation" of easy weeknight dinners.

I, like others, also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and thought it turned out fine.  I poured the barbecue sauce over the whole thing and added shredded ham and grated cheese and baked it all at once. My husband loved it.

Huge hit! I made a couple changes. I used BLSL chicken breast and cut them in half, I then rubbed them with BBQ seasoning. I stuck them in the oven for 15 minutes and then coated them in BBQ sauce and stuck some cut up onions in the pan. While that was cooking for another 15 minutes, I fried up some bacon till they were rubbery, but not too crispy, I then put the bacon on top of the chicken along with the cheese. I let it cook for another 15 minutes. And it was perfect. Everyone came back for seconds (even my picky grandparents) I will definitely be cooking this again.

The easiet recipe one could ask for and pretty good and nice-looking too.  I wasn't expecting it to be, but it actually came out very tender and moist.  It's not BURSTING with flavor, but the flavor is pretty good and if you spoon the extra sauce over the chicken after it's baked, it helps.  I'll make this again.

Hubs liked this. It was simple to prepare and all I did to tweak was use boneless chicken breasts and sprinkled them with garlic salt before cooking. Easy and oven baked, Thanks for the nice meal, we liked your chicken recipe.

The first time I made this it was with boneless skinless chicken breasts. Turned out ok but rather dry. The second time, I first marinated the chicken breasts in some of the barbecue sauce for a couple of hours, and it made a huge difference - very moist with a lot more flavor. The only other change I made was to add the cheese and then broil - way quicker than returning it to the oven for 10 or so minutes. I also use whatever cheese I have on hand - extra sharp Cheddar, Swiss, Provolone or a combination. Good stuff. Thanks!

I used boneless chicken breast like many others.This was very easy to prepare.I spiced up the breasts a little before baking, then followed the recipe the rest of the way.This is an easy and different way to have chicken on a busy week night.

I love the ease of this recipe!  I use bone-in chicken thighs and follow the recipe as written.  It's become a regular part of our household dinner rotation!

I mainly used this as a base recipe I bacon wrapped my chicken instead of ham (husband hates ham) and threw some sliced jalapenos on top (husband loves jalapenos) and it was AMAZING!!!

The flavor blend was really good . How can you go wrong with BBQ?  I must have used the wrong cheese, though because it slid off the meat and into the sauce.

I made this recipe and I thought it was delicious. It was easy, quick and had an amazing flavor. I will certainly put it into the rotation. I used very large boneless breasts and they cam out very moist. Great go to recipe.

Loved it the first time.  Second time made a few changes and it was even better.  I marinated breasts in BBQ sauce a few hours.  Topped the chicken with more BBQ sauce than listed on the ingredients.  Used shredded cheese (that's what I had) and used Canadian bacon in place of ham.  Husband loved it!!!

I just found this recipe and like others before me, I kicked it up a bit - hubby loved it and we are adding it to our regular recipes for 2014 - I used BLSL chicken breast and mixed it with BBQ sauce to simmer - used the big size hamburger sesame buns, toasted - with thin sliced ham and Swiss - it could'a used more BBQ sauce and a smear of mayo on the buns - we did ours "open faced" and with those exceptions it's a hit!!

LOVED this easy recipe, that was a hit with my husband and teenage son, alike!
 
I used boneless breasts to cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes/10-15 minutes, and seasoned the chicken with a sprinkling of: Oregano, garlic powder, Tastefully Simple Onion Onion and pepper before baking.
