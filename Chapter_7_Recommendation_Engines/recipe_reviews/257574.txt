WOW I can not say enough about this recipe!  It's a great twist on the traditional lasagna!  I omitted the peppers just out of preference and I use a mixture of ricotta and cottage cheese.  I will make this again for sure!

Really enjoyed  this recipe!  Itâ€™s so good.  It freezes well too, which is really great because I made a double batch.
