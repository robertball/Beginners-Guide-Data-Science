This was a big hit.  My brother even asked for the recipe, and I don't think he's ever done that before.  We live in the Buffalo area, so the bleu cheese in the recipe resonated with me.  So many wing-dip recipes call for ranch dressing.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce for that authentic Buffalo wing taste.  I found that it needed to cook just a bit longer or at a slightly higher temperature to get it nice and hot all the way through.  15-20 minutes was not long enough.

I used Sriracha sauce for the buffalo flavoring. Instead of bleu cheese crumbles on top I used Cabot cheddar

Followed the directions,  except I only used maybe half of the buffalo sauce. just made sure to choose brands I knew Had good ingredients, then I felt good about eating it. Didnâ€™t last long at the potluck table, it was a hit.

I made this for a gathering of my Allrecipeeps, and it was a big winner.  I baked bone-in skin-on chicken breasts seasoned with Papa's Seasoning blend from this site and then shredded the meat (makes gloriously tasty moist chicken).  I couldn't find the Marzetti brand of blue cheese dressing so used a different brand.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Be sure to warn people who can't handle spicy heat very well because it is spicy.  But oh-so-delicious!  Winner!

Fantastic yet simple recipe. Aside from the shredding of the chicken, this was as simple as dumping the ingredients into a bowl, then baking. If you are reading this, give this a try.

ONE WARNING: Warn your guests that this dip is hot. Spicy hot (and maybe temp hot, too).  We had a guest load up their tortilla chips with the dip expecting cheesy and was taken back by the heat. It is a wonderful flavor, sure to please, but make sure your guests know what they are getting.

Will make this again and again. Perfect dip for those who like buffalo chicken! Only comment on the recipe is "3 chicken breasts" is too vague for me. We have 1lb breasts and 3lbs of chicken would be a bit too much. Wished it was stated in cups or better yet ounces.

Loved it! I'm used to making buffalo chicken dip w/ ranch, so this was a nice change. I topped the dip w/ some shredded cheddar and more blue cheese before baking. I did play around w/ the ratios a bit b/c I didn't want to make THAT much. Everyone loved it~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
