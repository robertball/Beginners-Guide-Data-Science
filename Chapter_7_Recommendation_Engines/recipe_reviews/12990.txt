I almost didn't write a review for this one because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I was really happy with the results so I decided to share what I did.  With the onion, I added some finely chopped carrots & celery.  It adds a little more flavor and a few vitamins.  Plus kids hardly notice they are eating a few extra veggies.  I cooked the veggies, potatos, and sausage on the stove in just one can of chicken broth.  After I mashed the potatos a little, I transfered everything to my crockpot, added one can of evaporated milk and the velveeta cheese.  It was easy to let it all blend together in the crock pot and I didn't have to watch it.  We left and when we returned, it was nice & thick and just needed to be stirred a little.  I used only one can each of the broth & milk instead of two.  To make it a little thinner, I might add a little 2% or a little more broth next time.  Like other reviewers, I cut way back on the butter used to saute the veggies.  I think a couple of tablespoons is sufficient.  I also used a little less sausage and chopped it smaller than bite sized in order to appeal more to the younger members of the family.  This one is definitely a keeper with these modifications for my house.  I love any recipe that allows me to have the crockpot do the cooking while I'm away.

With modifications, this is a very good soup, especially on cold nights.  I added some garlic (2-3 cloves) to the onions while I sauteed them in the butter.  I also added bits of smoked sausage BEFORE I added the stock.  Gave the soup more smoky, hearty flavor.  I also added a pinch cayenne (red pepper flakes or Tabasco would be good too).  Finally, I used 5 large baking potatoes and only 1 can of evaporated milk.  It made a ton of soup, and my picky boyfriend ate 2 heaping bowls!

This is my all-time favorite potato soup recipe!  I've been using it for a few years, but I did make some changes.  I use dehydrated onion and leave out the margarine completely.  I also use beef broth instead of chicken (I've made it both ways and we like the beef best).  I know it would be less fat using turkey sausage, but the beef tastes so much better.  :oP  I normally slice and cook the sausage separately and drain it well to remove quite a bit of fat before adding to the soup.  Make some homemade bread with this, and you've got a stick-to-your-ribs meal that is true comfort food on a cold winter's day.  :o)  Thanks so much!

This soup was a hit with my family, and I enjoyed it quite a bit too. I did make  a few changes, in that I used whole milk instead of evaporated, added minced garlic while sauteing the onions,used only five potatoes instead of six, and added chopped broccoli to it as well. I also didn't bother to peel the potatoes, and didn't really mash it all that much, since I prefer the potato chunks. It was relatively easy to make though, and I will definitely be making this again when we're in a soup mood.

This was really good; my husband & two children liked it a lot.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it didn't have enough of a "smoked" flavor, when made as directed.  I ended up adding some liquid smoke & next time will use smoked cheddar cheese in addition to the Velveeta.

I loved this recipe!!! Even my husband loved it and he doesn't like soup OR sausage!!! I did make some slight modifications-thanks to the reviews already posted :) I only used one can of evaporated milk. I also sauteed the sausage with the onions and added about a 1/2 T of minced garlic with the onion. Instead of cooking it all on the stove I moved it to the crock pot when it was time to add the cheese. I also added 1/2 bag of shredded mozzarella and shredded cheddar to it. It cooked on high in the crock pot for about an hour...until all the cheese was melted. This was definitely easy to make and tasted wonderful!!!!! Everyone LOVED it!!

This is SOOOOO good! Perfect for the fall weather. I took PrincessApril's advice and sauteed the sausage prior to adding the broth. Like others, I added a few seasonings (cayenne & garlic), for my taste, as well as celery. Absolutely fabulous! Thank you Karin!

I was looking for a new way to use smoked sausage when I found this recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  Very good.  The second time I made this with less fat and it's still good.  I omitted the butter and used a pan spray.  Fat free evaporated milk, light velveeta, fat free/low sodium broth, healthy choice smoked sausage.  Yummy.  Only problem was the milk curdling during reheating -- don't know if the full fat version does that.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! A friend of mine use to make it when we worked together. Its been about 4 years and I finally found the recipe. The only change I made was I added steamed broccoli to it at the end. It adds the perfect missing ingredient! I didn't mash up the potatoes too much I love chunky soup. I bought fresh french bread for dipping in the soup. It was amazing! I even made it for my baby shower and put it in a crockpot so people can serve themselves and about 4 people asked me for the recipe. :-)

This soup is so good!  My family loved it.  I increased the quantity of processed cheese by a 1/2 lb and only used one can of evaporated milk cause I ran out of room in my pot.  No cornstarch necessary.  I garnished the bowls with a hand full of grated cheddar cheese and chives. Loved It!!

Added garlic.  Tasty, but not terribly special.  Needed something more...not sure what.  Will make again and experiment a bit.

I just received 7 thumbs up for this recipe from my children(3 thumbs from the 4 year old!). So, I would have to say this was a raving success at my house. I will be putting this in my recipe box and using it often! I also followed some of the changes with 1 can milk, plus I used regular shredded cheddar cheese, and a little garlic. Otherwise it was straight from the recipe.

I'm going to rename this "Naughty Potato Soup" because it is SO not for the health conscious but so addictively yummy! I tweaked the original recipe a bit to fit what I had on hand by substituting ham for the smoked sausage, red potatoes, and half and half for the evaporated milk. I also didn't realize I had bought 2% Velveeta so that may have changed the consistency and flavor a bit. I still thought it was pretty tasty and served it with steamed broccoli to ease my conscience about the gobs of fat in the soup. If my family approves (they haven't tried it yet!) this will definitely make the list for easy weeknight recipes.
NOTE: Be very careful after the cheese and milk is added. It will scorch to the bottom of the pot if the heat is too high.

This can be made lower in calories and carbs by substituting cauliflower for the potatoes and using fat free evaporated milk and 2% extra sharp cheddar cheese. I recommend using a turkey smoked sausage, too. This is VERY good and using cauliflower you don't fall into the mushy trap that you sometimes do with potato soups.

Thought this was very good. I tried to then make it with light Velveeta but ruined it. Original version was the best!

I was looking for something to do with smoked sausage that I had on hand and found this recipe.  I immediately knew my husband would love it - and he did!  I made two changes - I used 1/2 lb smoked ssg - and that was enough - and because we like a little kick in our food - I used 8 oz of regular Velveeta and 8 oz of Mexican Velveeta.  It was delicious!  I also used 1 can of reg broth and 1 can of low sodium broth but that's a minor change!  Wasn't sure about the size of potatoes to use so next time I'll use 6 med-large size instead of 6 small-med size.  I guess it would be good to have know the best amount to use in cups rather than # of potatoes since they differ in size. Even my picky 6 year old liked it!  We loved it and will be making it again! Thanks!

I made this last night for dinner, and it was pretty good. I used about 2 tbsp butter to saute my onions, and added about 1 tsp minced garlic. I also tossed in my sausage with this mixture to cook it up some and release some of it's flavor - it smelled divine. I used 8 small-medium potatoes cubed, but probably could have used another 2 or 3 after seeing what I had once they were crushed. I used a 32 oz carton of reduced-sodium chicken broth and after adding it, felt there wasn't enough liquid to cook the potatoes, so added maybe another cup of broth - a mistake. By the time the potatoes were cooked and crushed, the soup didn't thicken, even with the cheese added. I wound up mixing about 3 tbsp cornstarch with 1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk (2% lowfat) and using that to thicken the soup.  It was very thick, which was fine for my husband - he loves it that way. My son liked it, but doesn't care for smoked sausage, so ate all but the meat. All in all it was a very good soup, and will add it to my list of regulars. It was nice to have a change in pace for meat - we usually stick to pork chops, chicken breasts and ground beef. The sausage was a different but good choice.  Next time I might try using red potatoes, and making a roux with butter and flour, and adding my milk to that, then the milk mixture to the soup. The crushed potatoes give it a strange texture - not bad, but not as smooth as I would have liked.

Really good & hearty! I sauteed the onion and smoked sausage together in the butter. Added a package of frozen extra sweet corn niblets(steamed in microwave for 5 min. first) and instead of peeling and dicing all those potatoes I bought a 2 lb frozen package out of the hash brown section. Let that simmer in broth until the potatoes were tender mashed it up a little and added the cheese, milk and pepper. I also baked a loaf of pre-made multigrain french bread. YUM! Thanks for the great recipe. Charley

This was an OK soup.  A little bland for my tastes but my husband and boys LOVED it!  I served it up in the Italian Bread Bowls (on this website).  I will make it again, but maybe add a little garlic in my serving.

This was ok.  I'm not a big fan of smoked sausage, but my hubby is.  He has been bugging me to find a soup where I can use it, so I tried this one.  I used butter instead of margarine and added a little more cheese.  Next time I don't think I'll mash any of the potatoes.  It gave the soup a strange texture and there were no "chunkies" except the sausage.  Could add most any veggies here.  A good base.

My husband and I really liked the taste of this soup.  I ended up adding another half pound of sausage.  I think the next time I make it though, I will use half of the chicken broth so it's thicker.

This recipe is awesome....a hit with the whole family!  I recommend using light velveeta and substituting less 2% milk(to desired consistency)for the condensed milk.  The extra fat and calories won't be missed in this super rich, delicious soup!

This was great. Love, love, love it. I didn't use the margarine, just threw the onion and some celery in the broth. The rest I kept the same. Husband said this is a saver and I agree. Great recipe.

This was a tasty soup.  I like the salty, smoky taste of using the sausage.  I used my slow cooker for approx 2 hours on high.  I microwaved the cubed potatoes for about 3 mins prior to help soften the potatoes ahead of time.  I did make a novice mistake and let the soup continue to cook after adding the evaporated milk.  This ended up making the soup grainy.  I still tasted great and I will make it again.

Delicious!  I used low fat evap milk and it was thick enough to not use the corn starch.  Because the sausage is what provides a lot of the flavor I'd suggest cutting into smaller pieces so that you get some in every bite.  Next time I'm going to try with smoked ham and maybe some bacon bits.

Used turkey brats, casings removed. Added capful of liquid smoke; grated carrots, 2-3 cloves garlic; used rosemary I had on hand, and added some thyme. Fat Free evap milk worked just fine.

I  almost gave this five stars, but not quite.  I loved this soup.  I did not mash the potatoes because we like our soup chunky.  I used two tablespoons of cornstarch with water and it was perfect.  If I had semi mashed the potatoes I probably would not have needed the corn starch.  Without question I will make this again..

I used hot Italian sausage which gave it great flavor and a little kick. I would definitely make it thicker next time though.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and it's been perfect every single time.

I've followed the exact recipe twice, and both times were phenomenal. I've also made it 2 other times with substituting the sausage for crumbled bacon, and with cubed ham. Also just as phenomenal. 

It's a very easy and quick recipe that anyone can make.

I sautéed the sausage and patted dry before adding. Used 1 lb. of Kielbasa and it overpowered the other flavors. Probably depends on the brand of sausage but I will cut it in half next time. As others have noted you need to monitor the heat since the cheese will burn easily. Did not mash the taters......we like the chunks!

I made this today for Thanksgiving and it was quite a hit!  I added celery and garlic when I sauteed the onions.  It was pretty rich-- next time I might try it with whole milk instead of the evaporated milk.  But it was a big hit, nonetheless!

I was trying to find recipes to use smoked sausage (I love it, but hubby isnt a big fan) I picked this one, because hubby loves canned potato soups. Anyway, its a fantastic soup, I only tweeked a couple things; first I used about 2T of olive oil instead of 1/4c of margarine. I also sauted and drained the sausage before I added it to cut the greasy taste (I also used 2 13oz pks, so it was more sausage) And I used closer to 10 potatoes, so that we would still have alot of bigger chunks of them when it was all mixed. All in all this is now a staple in our family's menu!

Loved the recipe, although I made several changes.    First of all, I cut the recipe by 1/2.  My favorite change was an addition of 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, as suggested in a similar recipe on another site.  Added the perfect touch.  Other changes were due to what I happened to have in my pantry:  -Substituted fresh potatoes for canned, sliced potatoes, drained. (I used 2 cans for my half-recipe.)  -Substituted processed cubed cheese to a 3-cup bag of shredded cheddar.  -Used half the butter, but added a little olive oil to increase the smoking point.  -Used a shallot instead of an onion, and added the cut up smoked sausage to that to brown it a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I noticed that using the potato masher turned out to be key here.  Really helped thicken this, although I did use a bit of corn starch paste at the end as well.    This turned out to be the perfect thick, hearty sausage-potato chowder.  Will make again!

Let me start off by saying that I'm rating this recipe off of the fact that I used 2% Velveeta and fat free milk. Based off of that, this just fell flat. It lacked flavor. Won't make again.

This was a great recipe! What I did different was add a 3 oz. jar of bacon bits from the salad aisle of the grocery store instead of sausage as well add about five chopped up celery stalks, and one lb. of cubed mild cheddar. When browning the onions and celery, I tossed in a whole cube of butter also. I didn't need to add any corn starch because it was the perfect consistency

Very good and very simple to make.  A hit with everyone in the family-- including both the toddler and the preschooler, which is a feat!  I think the potato masher step wasn't really needed, since I like a little chunkier of a texture.  I'll try it without mashing next time.

This was very good. I had some trouble mashing the potatoes with the sausages in the way, though. I'm sure that can be worked around, though. It was almost too rich- I couldn't even finish my bowl.

Wow!! This soup is GREAT!!! My whole family loved it....We are going on a diet soon so I won't be able to make this that often. However, this will definately be a REWARD meal...
