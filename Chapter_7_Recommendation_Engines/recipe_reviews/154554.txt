This is a 5 with changes.  I followed the recipe as directed and didn't like the texture.  I added a can of coconut milk, about 2-3 tsp of garam masala, additional tsp of tumeric, and about 3-4 Tbl of ground cashews (to thicken it up).

Fantastic.  Very flavourful-very spicey.  I served it over rice with a bit of non flavoured yoghurt.

This curry tastes just like the curry at an Indian restaurant! I added a little madras curry powder without the green chile peppers in the dish to add a little more curry flavor.

Ground turkey was used in place of the cubed cooked variety.  I only used 1 pepper, and the meat mixture was hot enough for me!  Great taste!

One of the reviews mentioned adding coconut milk.  When you do that, it becomes more of a south Indian/ Sri Lankan thing...which is fine but it sweetens it a tiny.  When I was SO into cooking Indian, I was making more of the North Indian/Pakistani foods.

I liked a different option for left over turkey.  I did add more curry and some celery to with the onions. It was a little thick so added a little chicken broth.  My husband said just ok.  Yes. I will make again.

Very tasty, I didnâ€™t have garam masala so used all purpose seasoning, and some coconut cream and had it with turmeric rice. We all enjoyed it

This was a nice change from your typical turkey leftovers.  I added coconut milk as another reviewer suggested to give it a bit more sauce.

This is great as printed. The only change I made was to use about a half of a 4 oz can of green chilies, as I didn't have fresh.  I'm sure it would be better with the fresh.  It is quick and easy and a really good use for leftover turkey (or chicken).  And you can make it as spicy as you want by adjusting the amount of spices.  It is great the next day, too.
