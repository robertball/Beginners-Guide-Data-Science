I gave this a 4 star because it was reltively tasty, and very low in calories.  I was looking for a fast, low calorie recipe and this fit the bill. I could not find shrimp consomme, so I substituted vegetable broth instead.  I usually hate reviews where people change the recipe (especially things that clearly effect the taste) and then review it, but I had no choice in this case.

The flavor is good but there isn't much substance. Add some noodles or rice and you have substance and a 5 star soup to compliment your Asian meal. I will use this often. Thanks!

Tasty simple recipe. Couldn't find shrimp consomme either so used twice the beef broth instead. Cut the size of the broth to a quarter of that in the recipe, but used the same amount of dill and green onion so there was lots of flavor. also added low carb shirataki noodles.

This soup is ready in a flash, which is great!  I agree with other reviewers that it needs something more.  I added kale when the shrimp went in, and I though it was a tasty and healthy addition.  I also sprinkled shredded parmesan on the top before serving.  I will make this again.

This is a very nice soup, about 3, maybe almost 4 star.  However, it is SO simple to raise it a star, even two, by using fresh shrimp, added JUST late enough to cook properly, (it just takes a few 3-4 minutes!) to cook.  If you are worried about having enough shrimp flavor, sack up some clean (no legs!) shrimp shells in small square of cheesecloth & add at the beginning of the heating process.  Remove when they have improved the flavor, & definitely (as you probably can guess, before serving!  (LOL!  Ask me why I state this!!). I would add fresh chopped scallions on top, for garnish.

I made it first by the recipe and it was good, except I couldn't find the shrimp consommé, so I used beef consommé instead!  I then added some of the items from other reviews, kale and noodles, it was really delicious.

Family liked this one.  Followed advice and added Chinese noodles. Also added imitation crab for more texture.

It was good. I couldn't find the shrimp consomme so I used seafood broth instead. I added mushrooms to it, and used Tony's seasoning.

I added chow mein noodles to make the soup heartier.  For me it was low on flavor, but my 9 year old loves it.  I will definitely be making this again.

This turned out amazing. I did mine in a crock pot and added spinach. I didn't put the noodle. The flavor combination is amazing.

It was tasty! My hack for the shrimp consomme was using an equal amount of Trader Joe's heart vegetable broth to what is called for with three packets of seasoning from shrimp flavored ramen. I also added a package of frozen mushrooms.

I made this for a girls' night and was surprised at the response I got. the only change I made was to add some noodles, because I felt it was missing some substance. I don't particularly care for dill, which is why I rated it a 4, but all the ladies said it was delicious, and one of the girls went home and made it the very next week!

I would do this alittle differently....a few fresh shrimp cook them and use the broth, also use the frozen, use some noodles and mushrooms ...... there are several variations that this recipe could drizzle into our imaginations to create ....thank you!!!!

I added crab to this but it came out very salty.  We added some soy sauce to it to cut the salt and it helped but was still strong. I will search for other ways to cut the salt but keep it tasty.
